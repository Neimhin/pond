0,2021-09-07," ex-friend family would drone this. last thing said stopped talking heated argument vaccine effectiveness was, “oh please, tell ‘the Nuremberg code’”, stopped talking haven’t spoken since. couldn’t take anymore. I’m exhausted. super spreader hub

AKA, Wal-Marts, churches, all-you-can-eat buffets. It’s technologically possible cover US billions autonomous, wasp-sized drones detect you’re vaccinated looking face, inject vaccine they’ve storing tiny -90C freezers inside drone bodies?  Businesses capacity limits 15 months. Much time 25% 50%. greatly reduced ability make living many closed.

Schools opened everywhere way here. problems opening schools last winter areas little problem now.

I disinclined anything. spend bulk time AZ here, ignore mandates.

I get people dying problem, reacting point making horrible place be. 80% people vaccinated, people still living fear. needs balance cost benefit. analysis needs shared community transparent manner. reason, health departments important bother. guess busy saving lives.

The reason difference level education community drove higher vaccination rates, nothing else really made difference us Flordia, Texas place.

I sure spouse's occupation related anything discussion.

In end people die everyday range things. vaccinated, probability dying covid extraordinarily small. Vaccines effective, widely available free. choose get one, making choice. point, unwilling modify life accommodate poor choice. percentage fully vaccinated (both shots 1 johnson&amp;johnson) adults USA? time kind thinking early 2020-- year data work from, abundant PPE proven protocols protect transmission, course multiple vaccines... Many people this.  That's link gave, shows Beta multivalent vaccines quite measurably better Beta Gamma wildtype vaccine does. wife said day:
""I know fight Facebook. people never learn impacts directly.  sucks ton people die needlessly, way learn.""

Shes right. stopped fighting post moble vaccination places times finally figure shit get vaccine. know trust? lot reasons people would take normally, reasons might affect susceptibility COVID. Slides 29-32:  Joe Biden authority “shutdown” country. 

It’ll probably vaccine mandates booster availability. Perhaps federal vaccine app something thought US lot higher 75% keep getting Americans asking Ireland slow 85% funny governments always try cut healthcare say money. now? mental gymnastics, I'm sorry hard understand.  Yeah. people actually learned material taking tests good study habits, much loss even taking break. actually learn material, many subjects come back years later still good. cram night exams study specific exam, even short break lead forgetting material. least grade levels (like 6th vs 7th grade), much difference adjacent grade level exams. I'm sure. Either Pfizer Moderna. Much mandatory. look NYS healthcare staff (I work healthcare) mandated vaccinated Sept 27 mostly unvaccinated nurses / nursing assistants (who make far massive % unvaccinated health care workers) need jab keep jobs. Mine quick painless even realize got poked first. Yes, sounds fair me, didn’t get vaccinated COVID get bottom fucking priority hospital care.

Choices consequences, get vaccinated don’t need go hospital.

Disabling replies eventual mental gymnastics you’re spouting. allergy symptoms fatigue, fever, body aches, cough, diarrhea, runny/stuffy nose, fatigue week. tested exposed work, tested developed symptoms. works medical field, wear masks. medical field, vaccinated early, maybe efficacy wearing off? know. That's people wonder stat. people getting unauthorized booster shots, would wrongly recorded new first doses. hit 75% adults, need get 90 likely never get there. know several people got breakthrough infections still symptoms. Great simple explanation, rose-colored, clear pragmatic. I've saying months people seem almost hope things turn catastrophic. Evolution goal people acting like covid somehow trying become deadly humans evil something affect. last thing covid would want kill carriers fast effectively. Um, ask nurse staffing pandemic- ALWAYS purposefully understaffed. Often dangerously understaffed. 

Since Covid, staffing levels fucking insane dangerous. 

So no, isn’t hyperbole staffing needs increased drastically, even without Covid I’m glad I’m one feels way. got booster CVS like week half ago. part online form getting third shot, check why, go get it. write immuno status pharmacy added third dose cdc card. So, another lockdown? want go back Also remember kids unvaccinated. case one asked cared. Pharmacist confirmed booster everything. take immunosuppressant Crohn's, cared less. think pharmacies near doses* know with. Florida.*typo true conspiracy theorists really feel tickled. Unionize strike wages are. answer.  Yeah authorized booster due immuno status require anything state it. Prolly thinking 'well can't go lower'  sometimes wonder Swine Flu mid 20s. 2010 tail end pandemic. felt like going die probably gone hospital one night, young stupid. boyfriend time (now husband) caught wasn’t even feeling quite bad little smarter second time around went doctor sooner doctor almost sent hospital. 

Between two us hardly left house month. never felt sick after. experience huge reason taken Covid seriously. don’t want feel way ever again. Getting use bathroom took every ounce strength had. felt way week recovery slow well. 

Sometimes experience things take action. sucks it’s human nature. omg that’s sad. poor kids. wonder people didn’t feel anything vaccines well? Like side effects.   don’t think we’re going see lower case numbers side winter. Hopefully I’m wromg People forget breakthroughs aren’t even common! keep hearing talking point vaccinated catching spreading virus much everyone else, simply isn’t true long shot. way think taking knee anthem ""disrespects"" flag. much work completed hand well. clear, think post-9/11 changes theater. TSA theater. 

I don’t want theater. don’t want people spraying disinfectant every five feet eternity. want see build smart contact tracing, vaccine programs, etc. 

If 9/11 analogy I’m pretty sad future. think lot fact Middle Easterner pay TSA Pre Check get asshole fingered fly. It’s stupid pushing back TSA goons wiping breast milk bottles like wife. It’s stupid. 

But people continue cry fear we’ll get theater. I’ll gladly go work company. one things know mu way less transmissible delta therefore seem huge threat right now? People family members dying. That's good motivator scrambling push boosters? think risk little higher people realize. Weird thing say. Nobody's gonna stop wearing mask working pharmacy job. mandatory everyone else, assuming COVID's control point. everyone works home control workspace. live tiny studio apartment space proper work space. there’s plenty distractions including garbage trucks outside screaming children walking building.

Moving option right now. actually closer Nuremberg code violation state gave prisoners ivermectin without telling them. I'm sure anti vax brigade arms .. day now...   many businesses closed 15 months? I’ve San Mateo County whole time. don’t remember anything closed 12+ months. School closures sucked, yes, we’re seeing Delta schools still can’t quite get right. 

I friends SIP. What’s specific Bay? 

You consider mortality costs COVID relatively low here. know may think much that, disinclined right moment?

As spouse physician thank good I’m North Carolina like buddy even Indiana like hospitalist friend. He’s watching death death death meanwhile Delta thanks efforts county local health officials. Here's imagine. got pretty sick times kid, imagine. Really made want never get sick again!

Plus one time food poisoning thought gonna die dysentery. Holy shit awful. End travel ban people UK, EU Brazil enter USA. least let vaccinated people enter. faaaaiiirrrrr Governor Abbott even visited pediatric Covid19 wards show cares? That’s basically me. I’ve become depressed working home (I’m actually medication), lot difficulty focusing home distractions like TV, feel connection colleagues anymore. also proper work space cannot afford larger apartment due astronomical cost living Canada single people.

I want go office least one day per week. think auto-immune disorders historically counted early access. life threatening moment, I'm currently steroids, considered eligible, right? Fucking. Finally. Evolutionary pressure towards lesser lethality, disease. talking timescale may extend past lifetimes.

Covid kill fast enough inhibit spread, pressure become less lethal significantly overstated. Delta became less lethal, may even slightly *more* lethal. reap sow. Define social distancing here. still see friends family? long? 

If everyone group vaccinated, shouldn’t we? wait kids’ grandparents die first old age let see kids? kind logical risk calculus. age also correlates wealth ""That's built wall!"" Feeling pretty frustrated. kow someone fully vaccinated along whole immediate family, they’re sick COVID one extremely ill. 

It sucks people everything right get stuck shitty situation people won’t get vaccinated take precautions.  Great, isolation. Unlike people don’t enjoy WFH all. one go home to, rarely ever see anyone else. real lockdown. federal government never done lockdown. punted states. wear masks social distance. There's reason to.  gonna comment LA become lot safer saw comment. relative found easier ignore everything pay attention issues. way stress fear. work well her, underlying emotional response.  I'm teacher.

I've wearing mask since first training session, I've kept on. colleagues acted like reason cautious all, even listening superintendent explain even 8 teachers REASON, school would shutter. 

In district that, two weeks ago, voted requiring masks even high transmission, already 5 positive teachers, 7 positive students, 11 presumed positive, juuust high school.

School started last week.



Board met today voted masks. 



I freaking baffled ignorance I've seen... educators. Ha, NYC here, went back office June 2020. Currently 4 days week person. live crazy (I'm fully vaxxed wear masks time out) people realize hospital like 300 beds includes labor delivery, 100 people hospital covid said 90 percent unvaxxed. Friends hospital say crazy there, unfortunately people strokes accidents going die people. 

The conspiracy people crazy get ""jab"". lost friends end worth selfish. giving way much credit. Pretty much everywhere south good shape manageable covid waves. live wear masks indoors unless there’s vaccine mandate (bars mostly), otherwise limits. Hoping go football game. long hurt people, that's fine. Spreading infectious diseases allow exemption, especially someone people cannot legally flee from. religious beliefs important, change careers. tell said “fuck it” without saying “fuck it.” 

If defective car seat, toy, cereal killed many kids one year, would massive outcry federal agencies recall product, minimum. 

It’s somewhat rare child die communicable disease United States, 400 pretty big one-year total single respiratory illness. 

Also, “few” deaths happened schools closed prior delta variant. Hospital resources stretched thin many parts country time cases RSV also spiked among children. Hospitalizations children exploded older people gotten vaccinated, delta causes severe sickness OG Covid did. 

We embarking massive experiment kids. guess least places, it’s going go well. Probably 70% 12 population get vaccinated able federal government can't anyway shutdown country. world talking about? felt something similar Pfizer. advice: take easier days, immune system likely still working create antibodies even traditional symptoms.

Eat well, stay hydrated, get enough sleep. workout, maybe intensely.

As myocarditis, idea. gets bad lingers, call doctor. I'm sure time frame symptoms even exact symptoms are, rare luckily. Recently got vaccinated took 2 weeks running times back normal. basically getting wiped run. Even use inhaler, happens couple times year.

Don't worry it. fine. Thank sound reason &amp; kicking ""sweet butt"" back gear. needed swift, painless, reminder. you, hesitate. Test negative. :) resonate mind. awesome!❤ due respect, much people experience long Covid heads, simple issues like hypoglycemia misinterpreted. significant immunological systems get triggered don’t turn “off” allowing body return normal functioning pre disease. devastating, cure doctors Stanford elsewhere getting closer, doesn’t happen Covid - it’s real condition. 

I don’t think media hyping - think first time showing truth behind post viral conditions (which largely overlooked) reality horrendous. trying get psyche someone fully vaccinated feeling like need booster bad enough trick medical professionals. Come next door New Mexico. Housing still somewhat affordable, there’s decent job market especially film industry - red green chili everything. It’s elderly, immunocompromised. Many elderly aren’t qualified yet, even though probably should.

Pharmacies aren’t checking though. say need it, you’ll get it. There’s excess doses.  number one killer police officers US far Covid-19 idiots. get vaccinated real vaccination card idiots! (Repeated emphasis.) South africa arguably sadly best reported ones many fucking times people need learn almost always backfires leads general distrust authority detrimental long term effect whatever short term benefit lies bring?  lot people immune Delta becomes easier another variant take variant different enough immune system recognize well.

That's one reasons delta took first place--it infect people immune older strains.  elaborate? guess might’ve one ones gulf war? However might thinking depleted uranium ‘debacle’  Scientists everyone else brain: Vaccine good.

Antivaxxers: No.

A shady study: Ivermectin cures Covid.

Antivaxxers: **I'LL TAKE ENTIRE STOCK!**  Twitch collectively beat Pokémon Red, society can’t hit brake pedal. Nice job everyone 😭

Edit: immunocompromised person, fucking terrifying. No, high school sports thing either question fellow Health Care Workers around world especially substantial portion population vaccinated.

I know arrival new variants, Cases rising even pockets population high vax rate estimated Vaccinated population may develop severe completions question is.

Are observing majority patients develop severe covid get hospitalized even vented unvaccinated people new variants causing severe complications Vaccinated folks well (compared numbers vaccines)

This means supposed taken 'questioning authenticity vaccine' certified Medical Practitioner certainly anti-vax. enquiring efficacy vaccine new variants country awaiting almost inevitable next wave.

I asking whether expect mostly unvaccinated population less scenario last wave vaccination rates extremely low.

Any welk reviewed studies welcome have.

Thank You, Hope well. I'm imaging officers Supertroopers. Yes no. It’s apples apples comparison countries. Sure, we’re investing total dollars, that’s partly healthcare costs skyrocket compared countries. 2018 data, Australia insulin costed $6.94. UK, $7.52. US, $98.70.  expert, I've read, covid unique features presymptomatic, lesser extent, asymptomatic spread. also get people mild cases. features mean less evolutionary pressure towards weakening, since covid's deadliness limit spread much might otherwise. done hissy fit yet? want formal letter drafted apology? remember March 2020 like? People hoarding toilet paper. research R0 virus. firm confirmation virus spread. require direct exposure? touch fully aerosolized? disinfecting surfaces HOPE main communicable vector. 
 
**You're judging actions vacuum information now.** what? people hear pissed? Grow up. Guess people screaming ""see, Fauci lied, can't trust anything!!!"" 
 
Whether intend not, ""one people."" no, go ahead keep telling people Fauci lied. I'm sure lead better outcomes. Mild yet wiping week seems bit contradictory, unless we're using medical meaning mild, adds confusion. Absolutely. live Portland, according county health website zip code 95% vaccination rate amongst people eligible vaccine. don’t remember exact numbers counties, east go closer inverse get. think ur honestly kinda stupid u dont get vaccinated, youre honestly example reddit superiority complex Yeah pretty much everyone know real life thought process covid: get vaccinated (duh) let’s get back normal. It’s unfortunate immunocompromised can’t run society cater long-term.

I’m sure seems heartless that’s I’m right That’s awesome hear. drowned sorrow misery it’s nice hear post covid success story Agreed. SARS-CoV-2 proofreading, flu mutates well year year many parallel strains recombine produce new unseen strains. sequestered certain animals, others good species jumping, still others good killing host. variations arise recombination make ""the flu"" fucking hard stop. Coronaviruses recombine SARS-CoV-2 nowhere near plentiful even without taking proofreading account.  Isn’t also research showing Ivm causes issues sperm lol, family member concerned mRNA vaccine causing birth problems totally onboard ivm showed him..   Get “done already”? isn’t even vaccine tested approved school children yet. You’re saying inject kids adult vaccine untested children, hope react well? “science”? Staffing. enough hospitals, let alone hospitals field hospitals. Yup, thought sarcasm implied. share, 70K piece. 9 days. Covid transmission confined Auckland, almost within households, daily cases continuing drop, last 24 hours bringing 15 new cases. Modelling shows R number 0.4. Lockdown restrictions eased again, country, except Auckland, returning Level 2. control yet, measures worked we're track return covid zero soon. 

Vaccination rates high, million doses administered last two weeks, meaning 33% eligible population fully vaccinated 63% least one dose. New Zealand fastest vaccination rate country. Covid endemic, means inevitability. Masks social distancing obviously 100% effective, limit spread. Also, imply masks social distancing go forever, quite frankly.. ridiculous. I’m still mad I’m Magneto 😡 Eat well, drink tons water, sleep, drink water. Food helped lot personally

Also, Advil Tylenol fine, main recommendation take either right *before* getting shot ensure strongest initial immune response. Even then, problem, best wait take needed. landed moon? must’ve drunk They're planning move stars constellations. Panhandle (PHD1)

Had hard time finding this. personally know handful people already gotten third shot. that’s required waited month last shot apparently. one turned away.   Sure could governor abbot willing make happen. could call tx national guard build extra field hospitals time wanted. 4 days ago said Texas quote ""doing great"" hundreds people die overwhelmed hospitals. yup. This. 1 trillion percent different definitions bearable. Also, one gubernatorial election away becoming Texas given time. like though. assume every kid healthy kid. Every person reacts differently virus.

That seems like bizarre way interpret science. Obviously would mean every person react differently vaccine well.

If shown kids overwhelmingly extremely safe virus, effects children vaccine huge question mark, would think rolling dice vaccine better option known data likelihood need it?

My 11 year old caught Covid early asymptomatic. around outbreaks several times since then, natural immunity held up, even school’s recent Delta outbreak. Im worried someone going tell I’m mandated dump vaccine top that. would feel find would fine, adding vaccine child healthy antibodies turns medical problem long run?

Even *extremely* pro vaccine doctor doesn’t recommend vaccinate her. Ivermectin help covid. Plain simple. say ""nobody"" NZ Australia except one state, well probably bunch non - Western countries (I'm western barely read news know much outside bubble.)  I'm gonna trust pros one. Two problems:

 * Prescription drugs side effects. situations exactly FDA approved drug for, side effects generally harmful benefits.

* Since highly politicized drug, many doctors prescribing Ivermectin label, causing legitimate parasite patients able get it. means covidiots stay too... God dammit   Yes, need make coastal elites pay

/s didn’t choose wrong. Either decision tough homeschooling another year kids won’t friends virus serious risk low right now. 

At point nearly every kid going get Covid parents get breakthrough cases that.  Mewtwo made lab. Coincidence? 7 day average 420 Aug 29. Yes, gap weekend, see data resumed posting already Sep 7, 7 day 292. Since 7 day average, matter cases pushed today, still averages properly (though cause slight blip upward next weekend rolls 7 day window). 

Of course, possible might take another day data catch weekend, keep watching. might aspects too. Maybe less people getting tested days (maybe making 5 day weekend vacation). 

Also, want clarify said wrong, strictly referring data. mean necessarily agree state ""doing fine"" (there's aspect looking couple numbers). referring purely case number analysis. bad weeks like MN winter kind person loves snow? making sure people show site aren’t previously vaccinated? Given whole booster talk wouldn’t surprised people dropping get third dose whatever  Me?

I really feel like spent much time learning new stuff school reached (maybe?) sophomore year high school. . . .

Apparently, everyone else learning doodling notebooks first 10 years? Vaccination rates similar. UK's far age-skewed.

The UK also never scaled testing.  think know already tbh guy sciences! Haha, ya gotta right? Good you, looking family keeping everyone safe. Great job!! Part Ohio ""Right Try"" law individual's treating physician recommends use investigational drug, product, device last option available individual, attests represents individual's best chance survival, agrees either administer personally furnish issued prescription individual investigational drug, product, device

Where treating physician defined ""Treating physician"" means physician primarily responsible providing medical care treating eligible patient's terminal condition. ""Treating physician"" include patient's primary care physician unless physician treating patient's terminal condition physician primarily responsible treating terminal condition. patient may one treating physician

In short, key part Ohio law patient **and treating physician** agree treatment. second part, seem case here.

It's important physician recommend treatment, instead one currently responsible treating patient recommend treatment. distinction important, protect patients snake oil salesmen. know critically ill families difficult spot, often desperate. also know throughout history, vultures prayed desperate families. 

""Right try"" laws often multiple clauses designed protect patients snake oil salesmen. designed strike balance giving critically ill patients access experimental medication protecting patients. Yeah there’s definitely passion coming through.   Probably touting vaccine still effective serious infections. update international vaccine passport since nations require travel. 

They let FDA approve boosters first can’t really anything there. Maybe could pass law could sue unvaccinated person. could also set website could anonymously report them.  That's really true, certainly less likely deadly strain evolve post vaccine pre vaccine. possible mutation would make spike protein effective selection pressures same. introduce antibody resistance spike protein via vaccine open possibility mutations less effective benefit avoiding existing antibody resistance becomes important really good spike protein. thought viruses generally become transmissible less deadly tho Guess full FDA approval serious matter many folks. ya know, Reddit wrong that, shocking. True, I’m cancer survivor puts high risk category.  Interesting. that's true learned something take back part original comment. still work covid.     Got 3rd shot too, I’m immune compromised. think mean people without immune system problems. doesn’t start October actually go ahead it. They’re gonna increase date vaccination.

If front everything, might panic, honest, sure half nation would still divided, virus probably would politicized.   This. talking guy 80s COVID vaccinated months earlier, said ""Without vaccine, guess would worse off,"" said ""Yeah, dead!"" Instead recovered home. They're also erasing fetuses (fetii?). Seen plenty stories pregnant women aborting dying along fetus covid. Baby killers /s  article says 700 active cases 20 new ones yesterday Auckland.

Also pandemic wreaked havoc mental health, lot long COVID symptoms like fatigue brain fogginess also symptoms depression. 
 
I've almost certainly never COVID, still definitely felt overly tired unable concentrate anything certain periods last year half. spoiler alert....he one.  sounds like giver far know proper studies turned blank, eg work. People looking ages going work we'd seen positive results now. widely available cheap long approved human use given patients quite places remember. Sadly real evidence helps.   Oh. Right. really good comparison.  Thanks! even started convo facts not, going anywhere. respectful other, stubbornness full form.

... hate Fringlish.    Montréal, we'd say, ""Pas d'jab, pas d'job"".

Franglais Montréal poutine steamies smoked meat. mean, episode Family Fued like 20 minutes. I’ll stay home watch it. think equivalent. know boosters helpful, know approved, government going back forth start.

So people waiting announced start date weeks instead. there's controversy whether boosters had, generally. know should.   clicked link took white page ""because they're idiots"" written it. Weird. chance kill let slip. happen climate change, much worse.   still think that's part ""cure"" Yes 1918 masks idea global usage mandates outside 

Also believe masking social distancing lasted weeks pandemic. response very, half-assed compared we've done COVID. Joe Rogan obnoxious woke meat head 4 times US's population, per capita basis they'll need way people die they're hitting half US body count. what’s benchmark wear masks anymore? even one? loud minority get even louder  Chinese government probably opportunity, although think governments would fumbled well already this, recommend put ozonium ass.

Feel free google translate this: That’s actually lot better expected. Seriously. feel like 1918 Flu would nothing throw stuff today. Wow. love account. Sometimes people need hear they're loved, needed lives. Kudos leveling dad see family needs wants lives. Beautiful stuff. OP, think matters much. case whether systems reach other.

So 1918 sure could take 2-3 months arrives NYC Johannesburg get Johannesburg think quickly escalate unprepared 1918. time SA realised it, would way almost every city township SA.

Do know took Spanish flu longer? OK ""General Health anxiety"" 
Love you! Lol. stop antivaxx forums, making sick head Booster shots yet available general public. IIRC last time looked post-viral fatigue observed viruses, cases eventually clear months. makes sense we'll gradually see people dealing ""long COVID"" recover progress away last winter's surge. slow figure things out.  Source? antivax friend takes hydroxychloroquine pill month stave covid. pill gets Mexico. person knows somehow gets Mexico sells her. know what's vaccines she'll trust street drug foreign country. 

I hope sugar pill knows actually is.   mean needed look history see going turn out.  Faced overwhelming evidence, world population didn’t needed avoid massive climate change. Faced overwhelming evidence, half democratic populations world chose ignore/mock evidence Covid….and it’s likely stay. think real hope vaccines get even better, therapies treat get developed. state, county, county shop in. It' misinformation, facts ground live. we're ignoring whole mutation possibility huh? Sure, let's 6 months guess! Hopefully mutations become immune vaccine!

I mean, wearing mask worth it, right?  Screw him. Really. done. entire family guy vaccine dad wouldn't. kept saying believes God dies believes God saying time. sat dad chatted him, calmly must add. explained may think ready go, think mom ready along? think grand daughter ready grandpa? Idk man, son know I'm ready dad. got thr vaccine next day 2nd shot last week.  state. county. neighboring county go shop. Half unvaccinated also half refuses wear mask. 

Good luck them. FACT: Ivermectin drastically reduces sperm count due oxidative stress testes. Antivaxxers removing gene pool likely lead broader vaccine acceptance higher IQs. California Correctional Officers even lower.  books always described terrorist attack natural disaster temporarily overwhelmed local hospitals. reality lot worse persistent threat national scale. neighboring hospitals transfer overflow to. Everybody busy trying keep facilities afloat help coming. Watching coworkers slowly fall sickness burnout. think talking USA. cat much bag (mass infections across China, Iran, Italy) time reached American shores. 
 
A lot governments failed spectacularly course pandemic, Chinese government failed first failed hardest IMO. needed fda approval mandate it. it’s approved they’ve done so. feel like people take take current society granted. It’s like never studied pandemics affected past empires, realize many nations couple hundred years old, even aware early death part life recently. also seem helping long haul well, thing people much likely get. oh...thats cuz theyre stupid fucking morons! That's evolution works... We’re talking country 80% 16+ individuals vaccinated. significantly blunts transmission importantly incidence severe disease. That’s goal.  I'm nursing student right now... I've seen travel nurses making 240k+/yr going desperate hospitals. funny, remember British politicians (or Scottish? can't remember exactly) using country (Chile) example reopen second wave start 2021.

They can’t answer gained tho södermalm I've seen multiple times getting bars checked police fucking meter measure distance tables. idea packed wrong, probably never go out. Bars/restaurant literally around 20% people pandemic. Whoever says anything different know they're talking about. don’t know, who?   Actually quite lot covid money come thin air, believe not.  good article.  Floridians drives crazy amount effort system puts hiding obfuscating covid data make seem like everything ok far off... I'm guessing bother fact check response. actually often higher 99% state state. Here's light reading ya, Fine me! US QR codes record movement people could advise needed test? Australia. daughter works part time considered essential service. people enter business use smart phone connect state gov site advised QR code shop also date time person's phone number. person infected know certain times. makes contact tracing easier. contacted business video surveillance knew cashier. advised go get tested deep clean store. federal level government paying vaccines information available Medicare website, federal vaccinated dr entered vaccine info eg lot number date medicare details government website. people phones Australia. access information state website well. course lockdown moment. sure protocols place open up. advised already anyone coming Australia must double vaccine. people come Australia longer times health check. go doctor somehow doctor able send relevant information Australian immigration department. passenger issued electronic visa stamped passport computer system immigration control. cannot believe USA behind Australia Europe. smart phone would work things since feel piece paper good enough. registered phone number email address state government also manages driver's licence. thinking tell phone numbers mobile number not. Perhaps issue cards like driver's licence security features. 
When vaccines take relevant information including contact details, insurance numbers? I've never seen typical states. guess meeting stipulated clapping, talking, audible shows support went combination 'praise sun' 'jazz hands'. Give people 10 bags blood, 5 vaccinated, 5 unvaccinated, let figure which. That's EU also treats people produce food, claim product unique.

That's French shallots longer protected name, they're small onions, there's difference.  packed bars restaurants Södermalm every single weekend. even go inside witness crowding indoors right outside street. remote part Sweden? Maybe cities better Stockholm. number people getting vaccinated could stop dead tracks percent would keep going up.

Yep, boyfriends friend college died it. funeral tomorrow perfectly healthy, fit thirty year old pre existing conditions. waste. particular section article cuts like state's crisis guidelines complex, give hospitals legal ethical template use rationing guidelines, patients given priority scores based number factors impact likelihood surviving health deemed need care likely benefit put priority lists scarce resources like ICU Others dire need lower chances surviving given “comfort care” help keep pain-free whether succumb illnesses patients serious life-threatening medical problems face delays receiving care resources available.

There 3 people need ventilator ICU bed. 1 bed. 1 patient judged likely survive gets bed, 2 get painkillers. 2 get painkillers live die based luck. likely die. bed becomes free, process repeats.

Wanting partner unnecessary. 

Tourism is. tourism.   Good, hope people get vaxxed there's blood left  shouldn’t unnecessary travel everyone vaccinated.

“Wahhhh, want travel” mentality part damn problem. question when? wait another year, way wait five years example Another stat using total number vaccinated denominator? vitiligo yeah think count


I want one anyway Chances Vaccine complications &lt;&lt;&lt; chances catching COVID case bring severe. look county maps per-capita you’d see rural areas even harder hit. death cases.

I really think people focused NYC rural areas relatively blindsided “We first case Mu back May,” said Dr. Wesley Long, medical director diagnostic microbiology Houston Methodist clinical pathologist.
Long said doctors didn’t refer cases so-called “Mu” variant World Health Organization designated variant last week.
“Once declared would Mu variant, went looked saw cases dating back way till May,” Dr. Long said.

Oh no, dreaded cases there. Meanwhile Europeans can't even visit US reason. ”When relatives employees apply death benefits, asked disclose cause death, know employee covid deaths anecdotally,” Calzadilla said.

So probably more, ones they're aware of. true, would go get $1000 don’t know it’ll help, local public health pretty impressive graphs difference vaccinated unvaccinated (especially page 4, hospitalizations). I’ve made huge mistake exact thoughts first cases started showing Wuhan. Meanwhile, everyone making jokes saying big deal. Who's fucking laughing now.
No one. 

I'd also like point study published 2007 researchers predicted would another 'sars/coronavirus' outbreak future China shut animal makers continued keep disgustingly poor conditions. Australia also gonna fuck us effect vaccination wears off. brain kept trying make first sentence work ‘Family Guy’. 

Also, good job. Terrible idea, lead conspiracy theorists home schooling children make even deranged.

Just make vaccine mandate everyone. Don’t get vaccinated, pay fine increases every month tbh, side long term effects Ivermectin well known, human approved drug treat parasites conditions (part list [WHO essential probably fuck COVID. seen reasonable evidence contrary. 

Now, take horse dose Ivermectin, know coming you. done letting people take it? believe original quote full “And harm none, thou wilt” though perhaps 311 put best: “Do thou wilt shall whole law/ violate rights another/ respect space sister brother”. new America joke? S’ok. “One day it’ll diappear, (spreads fingers say ‘poof’) like miracle.” Scary shit. Thank taking care kids. get exchange? US never gives away anything Africa without getting something back. *This* story stops Facebook memes. see you’ve played Pandemic. Sucks guy getting access ICU another reason people covid there... vaccine Coronaviruses already development ten years prior outbreak. think Coronavirus lab center Wuhan? water wet many adults country, bunch whiny spoiled brats children. covid pandemic fucking trump pandemic, sure worse im leaning trump. Ah yes... know what? That's exactly kind reasoning going Wuhan cities China affected ""it's China, biggie"". rest history. man scored 50 points single NBA game. Goes show matter rich athletic used be, virus get you.

Hope gets better soon. Sometimes forget lots people never even seen snow, heard silence mid heavy snowfall. yes omg air amazing crisp cold clean. 

I'm Canadian though....so real winter. family double vaxxed yet everyone currently sick, worse others. useful come treatment ideas top comment get COVID sooner later, mitigating factor vaccine. doctor hinted organised network anti-vaxxers work, rather isolated individual cases.  Lol April 2021 paper extremely date? fucking world. age, worried getting caught pot, id get caught skipping school, guys got hide vaccination shot...I hard time accepting shit real. hope wake straight jacket lab coat guy trying explain im back reality went bad place again, much. 

You need sit parents tell grow fuck up. US citizens allowed travel without checks flying back home huh?

Why supposedly safer go vacation Italy, Spain, Greece, Europeans safe?  Thanks proving point. Despite environment culture close Norway Denmark, Sweden much much worse. Context important here. can't compare country apple apple (comparing Sweden India US would make absolutely sense) compare bit better countries virtually similar parameters others. front, Sweden dropped ball big time. - given we’re hearing already knew… wants bet never mask free air travel late 2023 *at best. What’s solution then?  Good.  Stop spreading Russian propaganda Australia much larger island, initially managed get covid control (there multiple small outbreaks). current mass Australian outbreak occurring unwillingness government lock cat got bag.

Like, hear outbreaks American communities churches still congregating, including hugging whatnot. seems like behaviour blame geography. son got second week middle school. couple days sniffles mild fever. Covid(last Dec) got pfizer shots catch it, despite kid getting face every day. wondering Ivermectin craziness came from, read case ivermectin, scientists found medication could kill SARS-CoV-2 virus laboratory setting.


So basically jumping untested remedy, ""you can't trust testing"". You’re one ranting Americans refusing vaccinate ignoring role international travel played prolonging bullshit. 

If country doesn’t handle covid, participating international travel. US included. Absolutely ridiculous thing hasn’t well controlled can’t even understand why. point unwilling modify life accommodate poor choice.

Jesus, selfish way look life. can’t get vaccinated due allergies medical issues. deserve suffer people’s “poor choices” well?? Holy cow.

Honestly, would say caring personal comfort midst global pandemic a”poor choice” itself. exactly US STILL hard time moving past pandemic—because people like don’t give damn refuse simple things help situation, like wearing mask.

Lol ajay bisht government said dengue, I'm supposed believe it? 

My 4 month old nephew given dengue positive report UP. mother doubts authenticity report. mentioned 2 children single bed treated hospitals.

Sincw Dengue start infecting kids more? International travel, coupled individuals lying vaccination covid status (like fake test results used get people India) main factor pushing spread different variants.

You know can't keep travel shut forever, people families loved ones seen almost 2 years.

Just set decent way people verify vaccinations (like european system), people tested PCR test travel.

There needs exit strategy try live around this.

A system checks, still something.  What’s changed that’s making Americans get vaccinated now? last saw plateauing anti-vaxxers en masse.

This great news. even national message. Folks Portugal started isolating back Feb/March 2020 even mandate, saw happening neighboring Spain. People stopped going out. Restaurants many non-essential stores etc closed clients staying home, able close knowing financial aid State. already weeks mandate, people knew hoax civic duty. national mandate helped reinforce legitimise this. know Germany's 3G rule says natural immunity lasts 6 months. Florida, Las Vegas big cities finding otherwise. totally feel way live ‘safe’ state Australia. Premier (like Governor) shut borders we’ve cases since last July. We’ve vaccines available ages since last week, progressive roll started 16 weeks ago health care workers immune compromised persons expanded 12 since September 1st.

My state already 60% vaccinated, people lining around street get one. Meanwhile, states, people spreading antivax propaganda spreading disease, refusing cooperate quarantine. Fuck people, put last health treatment lists. Funny thing HIPAA applies healthcare workers insurance workers. Also depends live work. counties/cities much better contact tracing compared others. got COVID County PH office asked businesses to, names/phone numbers people I'd contact with. even called wife tested positive, said random person contact tested positive. lockdown speak England. currently see curve less free-running mode disease *already*.

The ""e^Rt"" model extremely oversimplified various reasons, seems somewhat appropriate beginning new waves, clearly see numbers happens England completely, entirely different ""e^Rt"". thus valid extrapolation all. Yep, humans reservoir, could eradicated. However, already know we’re not. (RIP mink farms.) …how think variants countries circulating globally? isn’t US refusing vaccinate: that’s separate issue. 

International travel, coupled individuals lying vaccination covid status (like fake test results used get people India) main factor pushing spread different variants. tell club went weekend amount poor health communication could fixed taking health communication 101 could fill ocean. seen possibility everything dependent human behavior decisions governments. possible eradicate virus still is. cost gone (and continue go) way up. Worldwide vaccination everyone followed lockdowns wherever virus manages multiply despite vaccine (indicating escape variant) would it. erased smallpox far less capabilities  We'll probably end periodic booster shot active strains. think memorial day weekend good bellwether possible hold safe public events. many places huge gatherings, interesting compare numbers well preventative measures worked.  goal removed

Um, think health department psychic something? It’s novel virus continually learning about. expect health departments set kind “goals” don’t even really know virus can/will mutate future? wear damn masks hopefully eventually lower infection rate degree start assume normalcy (if that’s even possible, again, one really knows future holds). It’s hard. highly contagious viruses strike fine line deadly infectious are.

As really deadly, kill everyone spread hospital giving blood transfusion, really doubt know vaccine status donor. Tracking would difficult.

It’s therefore safest assume blood comes vaccinated donors. don’t want blood transfusion that’s choice, although prognosis may much worse without it. try deny kids transfusion reason, hospital put court quickly won’t know hit you. meant over, hospital SC hot mess. mitigation measures still contract tracing quarantine exposure. We're backed could several days find close contact really pretty useless. ""Try find way speak 13 per cent,"" Legault said. ""It sound like much, still hundreds thousands people reality experts say variant contagious, worried whole 13 per cent could end hospital.""

&amp;#x200B;

ok honest question.... really assuming 13% people none already covid? mean literally 1000+ cases covid daily year contagious say unvaccinated people whos say 12% 13% unvaccinated already covid antibodies it? Biden power 7 months seen massive rise cases. vaccinated tho? Killing host nearly always bad thing spread disease therefore disease tends evolve state kill host. Someone sick dying less likely go around public infecting lots people someone carries disease feeling fine, coughing little.

We also evolve bit better suited dealing covid, poor immune systems, poor lung health unfortunate selection genes deal specifically kicking covid body might die genes less prominent gene pool, meaning fend covid left.

Good luck family. It’s hard parent right now. Eating maskless, humanity! even read wrote?

Good story fake tests I'm sure that's large proportion, much larger natives do!! politically motivated- people getting vaccine aren’t anti-vaxxers. won’t get Trump, desantis, et al, fox newsmax told Covid big deal. take getting vaccine badge political affiliation totally side conversation this, disagree. don’t single friend would lie vaccinated &amp; also willing meet indoors. fair, also don’t single friend unvaccinated. 

Would people lie get restaurant venue? Sure, small private gathering friends? You’d pretty low life friends… clear, think lying get public space also reprehensible, easier fathom.   Someone another comment called ""pfizermectin"". Got chuckle me.  feel awful medical staff. situation in. Must absolutely heart breaking them. Breakthrough cases happen 1 10,000 vaccinated people so, no, everyone get it, probably large majority world population never get it.    Good thing stop spreading save economy. like keep damaging forever.  Good. new normal then.  Yup. I’m fine quarantine. I’m right now. I’m going fly. 

If it’s going protect people, wouldn’t it? It’s annoying people getting infected lot worse. extremely rare worried it, get shot hospital medical facility treat something happens.   caused loss smell and/or taste (most likely CNS level)... quite bad still, people give fuck. vaccine card labels two Pfizer vials LOT#. didn’t have: name, RN pharmacist signature, birthday, medical ID, one dates crossed previous day also offered vaccines current day written in.

I've certainly considered this. tried getting booster doctor physical last month ""current CDC recommendation mix match, j&amp;j currently authorized booster dose."" work in-person underlying health issues. I've mainly held concern needing show proof full vaccination boosters *are* authorized. mess. That's fucked up, make 50-60k (depending OT economy) high school diploma. Nurses making WAYYYY that's case. would help administrators teachers treated school nurses better. makes want cry. school administrators (in case anyway) basically leaving mandatory masks vote among parents. decide important safety protocols! WTF. administrative decisions would consider putting fucking parent vote?!

Now four kids home Covid, breakthrough infection too. 

Assholes.  too? Wow truly lost nation… write SPH form shot had, didn’t seem like one checked. Call primary care let local contact know call periodically check Ahhh thanks detail vaccination rate isn’t evenly distributed. areas high rate others low. It’s low rate areas getting pummeled Delta. Wow. Something actually mattered someone. take day now. LOL. 

Glad know test negative. Covid big deal vaccinated, mask/distance, stay vigilant symptoms. Really. Compared many bugs bring pandemics, managed. Unfortunately, tens millions managing. all. (sigh).

As reasonably healthy, somewhat in-shape, 30 something known pre-existing conditions, got vaccinated soon freaking could.  problem QR code it’s one way validation system. like paper card, whoever wants verify it, can’t.

Not really. Like piece data, include cryptographic signature contents QR code. Changing contents data would make signature invalid, would immediately apparent someone scanning it. generate signature, need private key held relevant health authority. verify signature valid, need public key derived private key, freely shared public.

So someone comes QR code, scanner read data, read signature use public key health authority verify signature authentic matches data. long private key securely stored glaring bugs implementation, QR codes can't altered forged without cooperation agency holding private key. public key stored scanner app simply downloadable central server / website. first case, entire process validating QR code done offline.

This method cryptographic signatures EU Digital Covid Certificate works. generally, technology digital cryptographic signatures confirm authenticity message common many internet standards.  Yeah South Carolina passed law prohibited mask mandates schools. someone US, wish Facebook laughing reaction this. Haha, no, happening US. wish! caused one fingers fall eyes stop working, nobody would’ve played around.

I believe anymore, frankly. We'd bunch one-eyed, 9-fingered conservatives screaming personal freedom lose digits, ten fingers = 10 = 5g * 2 = 5G SQUARED, TEN FINGERED PEOPLE SHED 5G PARTICLES equally stupid shit. I’m sure every district schedule. Schools friend lives opened Aug.26. mask mandates. cows mode transmission human animal! “…but beautiful moment time created lot value shareholders” SARS-1's spread also largely inhibited pretty much every case would symptomatic contagious, much easier know isolate.

MERS really contagious enough spread, still around middle east, deadly also quite rare. predominant source infections would camels. yes take care camels could well carrying MERS.  Delta found deer, cats, dogs, animals zoo. It’s getting animals humans giving them!  Remember Portugal 98% ay point Again, comparable comes climate, population density, culture, start pandemic country (time react) etc. France okay compared similar countries, Sweden squandered advantages compared comparable countries (had time react France Italy, lower population density, population better compliance etc). Right, outside disarming entire populace eliminating black market guns, shootings preventable.

""buT MeNtaL hEalTh SoCial WorKers blah blah blah"" EU system open countries participate in. that's already happening. countries work closely together EU (Norway, Iceland, Switzerland) added rather quickly recently Ukraine joined well.

The EU DCC QR code contains nothing basic info vaccine along cryptographic signature local health authority vouching information correct. verify signature, scanner needs fetch public key health authority. that's what's stored EU servers, sets public keys participating countries.

So participating system require upload information citizens EU server. manage national health data locally submit public signing key EU system.

There's legal stuff arranged regarding participation system, technical point view, easy countries join. can’t believe parents care little kids get vaccinated. could ruin kids life give 0 fucks.

That's world ended Delta. Nothing inevitable virus. many times wrong 21 months? continue act best knowledge instead fear mongering future.

Last year County live switched hybrid full person, saw 70% increase positive tests within 2 weeks. Social distancing probably biggest mitigation measure taken away year, aside places mask mandates Schools. 

I would also say, kids bringing Schools increased activity outside Schools without following proper guidelines huge issue too. 'To serve infect"" China hiding severity yes. POTUS praised China efforts dead one? Nah brother moron he’s vaccinated Fully vaccinated end March. Considering getting booster week going vacation country getting married next month.

&amp;#x200B;

As September 2, 5 million children tested positive COVID-19 since onset pandemic. 252,000 cases added past week, largest number child cases week since pandemic began. declining early summer, child cases increased exponentially, 750,000 cases added August 5 September 2. 
 
The age distribution reported COVID-19 cases provided health department websites 49 states, New York City, District Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam. Since pandemic began, children represented 15.1% total cumulated cases. week ending September 2, children 26.8% reported weekly COVID-19 cases. 
 
A smaller subset states reported hospitalizations mortality age; available data indicate COVID-19-associated hospitalization death uncommon children. 
 
At time, appears severe illness due COVID-19 uncommon among children. However, urgent need collect data longer-term impacts pandemic children, including ways virus may harm long-term physical health infected children, well emotional mental health effects.

The results phase 1 2 clinical studies show drug safe effective preventing disease getting worse, neutralising virus reducing inflammation patients.

It proved polyclonal property XAV-19 makes treatment effective SARS-CoV-2 strains discovered date. 

This polyclonal antibody also create immediate immunity prevent viruses entering cells. important difference monoclonal antibodies currently used treat patients early stages infection. 

Phase 3 clinical trials XAV-19 carried France European countries like Greece, Bulgaria, Romania Spain.

At meeting, Odile Duvaux, Xenothera's Chief Executive Officer, said were willing co-operate Việt Nam conducting phase-3 clinical trials country.

She also expressed company's goodwill co-operation, particularly those relating technological transfer Việt Nam could produce XAV-19 future.

In late May year, French Government signed contract medical laboratory reserve 30,000 doses XAV-19, designed stop patients becoming seriously ill treatment approved use emergency.

Deputy Minister Health Trần Văn Thuấn said meeting Việt Nam appreciated promising results first second phases XAV-19 clinic trials.

Việt Nam willing co-operate laboratory phase 3 clinical trial technological transfer country could access additional COVID-19 treatments, he said.

As many 446,118 people city were immunised the Moderna vaccine between August 1 and 15.

The recommended interval first shot second Moderna is four weeks.
According Ministry Health, Moderna vaccines storage. country far depended on donations Moderna.
According city's Department Health, the Moderna Pfizer vaccines use mRNA technology similarly high efficacy preventing symptomatic disease.
Previously, number of people city whose first shot AstraZeneca received Pfizer second shot AstraZeneca supplies ran out.  

The city aims have all people aged 18 and receive the first shot September 15, and the second shot end year.

Also far remember, one promised end this. many people said reason take vaccine...

Which really excuse want take it. goalposts moved immediately FDA approved it.  Soon DeSantis require companies hire covid-infected cough clients. also shut latest episode Tom Segura Ivermectin made better (""it's possible. knows?"") anyone anti-Ivermectin hates Trump something.

Never mind Joe also took bunch IV drip treatments Ivermectin took OTC kind antivax idiots poisoning with.


I watched like Segura. Rogan going liberals ruining America (while also chastising ""covid became political"") medical BS made quit watching show primary use ivermectin?

Livestock dewormer.

Because livestock get worms lot often humans do. mean, Joe Rogan look like inquisitive anemic turd.  Joe Rogaine getting something wrong. 11. prevent 40% infections though… love joe rogan  No, referencing see came conclusion around 82% mid-May. Given that, must around 85-90% now. 

Delta continue hurt unvaccinated, increasingly small population seronegative. Unfortunately Delta infectious spread continue despite this, we're peak terms healthcare system impact (so long YANV - yet another new variant) simply seropositivity - vaccine infection - greatly reduces hospitalization rates. 

The fact states got hit Delta hardest earliest - e.g., Missouri Florida - clearly peaked indicative that. Hospitalizations trailing states. behavioral, lot comes seropositivity saturation. again, unfortunately appears Delta persist even seropositive population, strain hospital system much ratio severe cases infection plummet. taking care conveying opinions?

Ok, there’s thing called free speech. someone went certain treatment, there’s absolutely reason quiet it.

Regeneron Ivermectin proven help people many illnesses. fact think harmful indicates may need research medical trials. Guessing couldn’t figure make read someone else’s - “he every right use whatever treatment wishes fight illness share people listen podcast follow social media”


That’s giving medical advice. pointed relevant fact:

*Mu steady decline since July*

Anything else 24/7 media cycle looking hype something, regardless facts. I'm old enough remember Beta variant supposed big bad wolf would blow vaccine defenses. ragweed pollen count super high me. I'm sure much physically near also know matters still global trade travel, daily flights major airports US South America. inevitable find cases US whatever variant going around South American countries. fact outcompeting delta variant US means really cause alarm. good finally genomic surveillance check this. essentially claiming statistical association covid infections covid hospitalizations. know association. Okay actually use super glue pinch. friends (who doctors) done that.  IDK consider South America poor? Anyway really good vaccine rates, beating quite rich countries.  Vaccines still work pretty well, that's great news ask time evidence benefit treating covid. one taking drugs ""might "" work doctor prescribing violating ethical best, Ivermectin offers marginal benefit outcomes

**There evidence this.**  believe they’re referring anthrax vaccine. understanding it’s still required certain personnel, either combat roles people deploying combat zones. Perfect description I’ve seen looks like goon one Batman games who’d shout “ITS DA BAT” like ended getting Canada. We've seen lot AZ Pfizer much Moderna Pfizer outside Canada. Actually mine way around Pfizer Moderna  definition listed MMA dictionary? ""Who's foolish? fool fool follows him""?    South America pretty goos though. One interesting things Rogan he's known completely different kinds people completely different things. agree, frustrated taken long Definitely never tuning podcast ever again.

haha yes pedantic all. definition MMA fighter someone competed mixed martial arts. He's never done that. comment replied linked video Joe training say makes MMA fighter, clarified. Shocking… yes Yes YES! absolutely problem, needs shut fool mouth shit impacts general public safety. 

If told dumbass followers jump cliff protect Covid, did, he'd jail. side effects ignorance slightly less obvious make less harmful.  Nope Mu variant 49 states, time story across major cities. Though might bad compared Delta. Thank first person point also human dewormer different concentrations. It’s fucking drug.  COVID impact reproductive system certain cases?

Either way, COVID convinced really live Idiocracy pandemic started, joked Turkmenistan's reply pandemic. Florida! That's like Disney level evil! Journalists (and anyone big public followings general) also taking care conveying opinions could harm mislead people COVID… wild. know. Thanks info :)  refuse roll window unmasked cop. yet even news people still insist getting vaccinated put people danger increasing possibility new strain vaccines might work.  started 2002 PPVs - commentators that.  remember first TV deal certainly then. mean tell UFC commentator medical background panders audience isn’t good person receive medical advice from? I’m shocked! got told people applied trials. People act like fill chemicals random trials vaccines pretty sure going work  silly.

I get medical advice nobel prize winning scientists like Dr. Luc Montagnier Michael Levitt.

Surprisingly, agree Joe ... According Abbott, better everyday! Less irony self fulfilling prophecy.  CDC SUCKS messaging. 

The disinformation spreaders twist everything suit anyway. hand silver platter?   That's NBA Champion successful Corky's Ribs BBQ franchisee BIG Joe Kleine you. - Wayne Gretzky tracking like Israeli data, Israel reporting long since vaccination. Weakening immunity 5-8 month period also contributing, massive booster shot initiative. I've seen way many people using single aspect Israel's hospitalizations statistics  argue vaccine helping.   wouldn’t really call “checking legitimate health concern affects certain percentage population” covering bases even personally weren’t affected it. Seriously, it’s like people don’t get people could different experiences also important, again, guess that’s theme pandemic. We’re great giving shit people aren’t known us. want echo chambers people act like lemmings? thanks. 170 million+ vaccinated, 40 million confirmed cases, cases missed due testing unavailable/asymptomatic/other, seems like reaching sort herd immunity. missing something? agree enforceable mask mandates, resulting mass shootings victims would overwhelm hospital systems. I'm sarcastic.  here. Usually heavy. periods Pfizer doses charts heavy clots. Makes sense, religious convictions strong put life around danger course give pay. I'm sure devote followers faith. No, dude. plants.  It’s cool don’t personally find alarming, personally find concerning people willing write women off. assumption people dumb know bodies whether something abnormal? Like wouldn’t taken things account? Women AMAB people make half population took long spot take seriously. Medical science society general need better. pretty embarrassing.

Here decent write it, Haha!

I roommate actually celiac disease would become incapacitated ate gluten. 

That’s legit. That’s real disease. 

I’m talking years back, suddenly sorts people zero digestive issues hopped “gluten-free” fad without needing to. 

I remember people afraid eat foods thought gluten despite zero allergies gluten. Flashback last winter numbers really boomed….. can’t wait see happens winter   Yup. liver big part immune system, damaged liver = weakened immune system.

Alcohol also bone marrow suppressant, bone marrow another huge part immune system. That's fine! you. 


I wearing mask cases go back down. I'm fairly extroverted like seeing facial expressions, smiles, striking conversations etc. one decent republicans office, i'm sure shorten tenure. mean you’re fully vaccinated chance serious illness low..

Let people want

The unvaccinated die out, vaccinated return normalcy Thought would interesting personal anecdote given gloomy news be:

My grandparents (a little 90) got vaccinated Pfizer February. contracted COVID week ago. grandmother dementia, anxiety, high blood pressure, history diabetes. grandfather Parkinson's.

Both suffered cough fatigue. grandfather started feeling better, went exercise stationary bike get up, sent hospital. hospital, doctors said issue directly COVID, way dehydrated exercising. top that, apparently infected second cold time COVID.

Despite age underlying conditions, grandfather short hospital stay, grandmother minor symptoms lasting week. soon quarantine lifted, eager start going lingering symptoms.

Anecdotal, vaccines really work.  Agreed. concerned winter surge? 

I know question probably asked hundreds times here, serious winter season expected terms Covid dangers? strange.  Proof this?  Could elaborate? GF allergic gluten (allegedly) it’s quite annoying. make separate dishes everything. 🤦‍♂️ early many saying real way make vaccine quickly mutating Coronaviruses related common cold, also can't keep enough made effective vaccine for.  


Then BANG developed vaccines! Bang... virus kept mutating rate like common cold vaccines might become obsolete year span. bang. also certainly 10 years left. 

Unless something massively changes, soon, really don’t. problem. one wants believe climate disaster right around corner. It’s always pushed far-off threat, next generations problem. isn’t. We’re dealing extreme weather daily basis. New York flooding speak. Texas froze last winter. 

10 years point optimistic. least quality life diminish point lockdowns mass covid death good old days.

Denial isn’t helping anymore. wish could hopeful future, it’s hard ignore writing wall. data Utah. googled ""utah breakthrough infection data"" first result.

When organization research analysis, *they* primary source. citation article reading, veracity what's written based trustworthy organization is. That's said good idea work then; way know sure organization trusted. NYT remotely perfect, they're widely seen rather trustworthy, think feel need cite sources specifically might (although say *exactly* got data, share link). I’m epidemiologist degree public health epidemiology research degree. 

This isn’t correct. 

It may become contagious virus unlikely mutate become dangerous. Probably 2 month lull followed another big winter peak sold indoor high school/ NBA / NHL college games. infantry US army. dropped zones everyone wants kill them. difference Army throw jail years shoot innocents. police pat back shake finger.

Without consequences, amount training prevent police violence. held accountable shitty decisions kill rather drug across hostile court room even bruising suspect, nothing change.

An American soldier shoots 14 year old boy gets demoted put trial. American cop kills 14 year old boy get hash mark cruiser. need consequences. need take military LARPing gear though, would technically defunding. pay upkeep training tanks MRAPS. take those, cut funding default. vaccine causes immune response. far body concerned, it’s similar. Im used heavy ones one way beyond normal. Didn’t notice clots time. super heavy. Like going change every couple hours. woke sleeping 6 hours pjs pants soaked. Good question! honest answer scared side effects. pro-vaccine scared death bad reaction first came recently managed overcome anxiety go it! wish done sooner? course! alas, anxiety controlling factor life. What's resign shit? Fine put jail. May well start naming variants idiots spread fake info. Don, MTG, Rogan agree need get world vaccinated, fact simply logistical capacity so. vaccines require cold chain tech deliver them, that's feasible yet.

Besides, vaccine arm mean someone abroad get vaccine. zero sum game. logistics, far nation made truly good faith effort vaccinate even large percentage third world. Something like 2.5% Africans received vaccine IIR. Boosters US change math.

The bottom tier people trust advice. slow uptake every aspect disease. I'm ""abolish WHO"" nut anything, hesitant take guidance gospel given track record pandemic. Remind again: second wave 1918 flu kick off? Trumps really issue, he's partisanship pawn. GOP real problem people keep voting in. genuinely remind gluten-free people years back. 

People absolutely panicking avoiding gluten despite living entire life eating unknowingly. 

And happened someone *sold them* idea afraid gluten.   Good bot yall define long island Nassau/Suffolk only? Figured Brooklyn/Queens considered well since across east river. 
* someone mentions long island say personally picture Montauk beaches Best metaphor Mu I've heard: 

""If Delta variant 20 foot crocodile swimming pool, Mu variant 21 foot crocodile neighbor's swimming pool.

It's anyone's guess friend's husband bad case. Like said, random virus. say fine folks wind [subreddit likely auto-mod filtered here, deals covid deniers die covid] frequently mention eating days time winding hospital, think they're weak, like entirely different level. fact he's eating fine good sign. basically Rogan put words study author's mouth. cool. Reddit: ""quick need pivot 'ivermectin drug livestock' mantra. forgot take 5 seconds google find also prescribe humans, look like stupid hive mind internet trolls""  True, seems worse  Monoclonals scale way vaccines infusions take much longer, monoclonal sites handle 300 people day vs 2000-4000 vaccination sites. every state trying use monoclonals stop surge also news stories long lines infusion sites. admittedly dumb question seems legit lol  100% boat here.

Shooting shit podcast science, agree. Rogan isn’t science. People really shouldn’t listening somehow don’t realize that.

however, calling misinformation think untrue clear listen podcast. He's described bunch friends got different reactions it. extremely severe others much. much knows bad be, us. Board-certified* doctor Yeah cause immune system sucks. used like podcast years ago. got super popular surrounded ""yes men"" dick think wrong. surround people call bullshit become giant pile shit. Also stand-up never good.   Better doctor.  certainly opinion something understand. Read majority posts Reddit taxes, everyone ideas - vast majority understand even basics. 

You suggesting large following due current health crisis - obligation society express opinions? think short term likely get worse, although America largely segregated political opinions. However, definitely imagine becoming schools longer active pandemic would anyone even argue dumb ass celebrity loud mouth? definitions moderate drinking 1-2 drinks per day, places recommend per week 'optimal' health, course different people tolerate alcohol differently.  
This definitely area emerging research, lot study definitely needed; trying word carefully give nod fact saying ""neutral beneficial"" kinds lifestyle studies notoriously tricky (especially dealing self-reported behaviors. Obviously goes well beyond scope thread, wanted point binge drinking definitely bad immune system (and, huge stretch say could certainly contribute getting sick, even vaccinated), moderate drinking really bad (absent underlying conditions, consult doctor, etc.) maybe 100 years ago, days we've got people yelling nurses doctors saved lives superspreading. like old days got little diarrhea started writing case killed you. quarantine hotel, moved back US live Mother's ok challenge MSM narrative.

Oh lord, one ""MSM narrative"" people. smh Kind layman's thesis kinda feel like northeast/midwest still gotten real wave delta likely peak winter. Hopefully vaccinate prepare well enough then. think lines Gottlieb saying well. I'd also dare say south probably big dip cases/hospitalizations slight rise winter, anything like we're seeing think. Versus last year winter big rise cases especially Dec/Jan. good thing highly vaccinated northeast though case numbers probably high likely rough comes deaths maybe hospitalizations. Completely disagree. There's plenty evidence support acupuncture. Here's one meta analysis chronic pain showing superior placebo sham acupuncture. learn yourself? No, wasn’t. doctor Japan said based study different African countries, countries used ivermectin lower reported mortality rates covid therefore studies effectiveness covid. fact study Japanese gov effectiveness ivermectin found ineffective. You’re repeating misinformation Joe did.

That’s separate Joe took horse dewormer thing, Joe take horse dewormer, took doses humans normally take it’s still drug meant kill parasitic worms humans horses. vast majority doctors won’t prescribe drug humans doctor prescribing drugs label uses, case treating covid, opens costly lawsuits misinformed people buying doses meant horses suffering consequences. that's surprise, real question is- deliberately getting wrong actually understand? 100% this. Instead vagina steaming goat milk cleanses DMT therapy elk meat diets. think issue simply saying kinda worthless.

Like, putting disclaimer beginning sentence ""I might wrong"" ""I'm idiot take grain salt"" really enough.

You also willing follow sentiment correcting find new information.

I would problem Joe Rogan willing admit wrong correct putting accurate information.

But can't say ""Don't listen me, eating live bees good health"" move onto new topic dumbass audience dies hundreds bee stings.

The Spanish Flu became less deadly people died could transmit dangerous strains. less dangerous ones always became dominant time strains killed hosts caused strict quarantine

The selection pressures made COVID pandemic begin ones grant ability become *more* deadly (as happened Delta) without dying out: asymptomatic transmission, variable symptom severity delayed onset symptoms

You could argue COVID selection pressure become deadly people immune (through vaccination natural infection), causing greater symptom presentation ages spread within bubbles easily jump bubbles goat drinks mountain dew. Humans drink goat.   mean, Israel extent... Great! make masks optional get back normal now? know lot virus point render lockdowns obsolete IMO. least would everyone would mask get vaccinated. 🌽 gotta leave overnight. least popular.

I think wearing mask been, will, become normalized US, already elsewhere.  

When young, *nobody* wore bicycle helmets. common not. big deal see someone without bike helmet, also big deal see someone wearing one. high hopes mask-wearing common bike helmets. There's built mechanism giving 3rd shot risk first. first get original shots, first hit 8 month trigger.

But break get started month like want. Wait long people eligible time shots start. Might work Florida. really known self preservation. feel cheated. got first shot Pfizer two weeks ago get boost mobile data. 5g chip implanted second shot?  Good hear!  Also, selection pressures made COVID pandemic begin ones grant ability become *more* deadly (as happened Delta) without dying out: asymptomatic transmission, variable symptom severity delayed onset symptoms

You could argue COVID selection pressure become deadly people immune (through vaccination natural infection), causing greater symptom presentation ages spread within bubbles easily jump bubbles That's federally funded program article mentions that. also provides overall risk country 1/5,000. bay area risk would far smaller 1/10,000 Florida risk would far higher.

Sweden got lambasted early ""lax"" policies looking pretty good now. wish CDC would track near real-time many vaccinated, many infected many neither, thus still risk. Every study see turns something based old data representative Delta times.

Between massive estimated infection rates half country fully vaccinated, think large percentage population left immunity. Apparently depending live given current developments. catching quickly substituting natural immunity low vaccination rate. [It's also expecting half year vaccines started good guy came work gotten first shot getting second wife flipped says poison gets near infect vaccine. go back second since old probably going get virus die nut ball podcast telling wife fucking poison. Yeah life can’t stay locked down. Also clarify, live Bay Area normal means going fully business vaccine checks get bars/restaurants/events. zero hesitation go eat indoors go drinks live. also don’t mind wearing mask though think it’s bit theatrical times (ie eating indoors vaccinated people). point you’re fully vaccinated don’t dependents aren’t don’t see would restrict activity. also allows feel like they're something survive. all, doctors basically told lay bed wait die. pretty sure last year near beginning, sick 3 weeks really bad flu, tests sort point masks even discussion. Covid beginning break story. year later got antibody test said antibodies, lot family got infected, coming one family member got exposed hospital staff treated something else. transmitted household. ended isolation family members tested positive experienced covid tested negative whole thing. chance get vaccinated around.

Anecdote worth one thing: experience seems agree covid previously though antibody test didn't. got vaccinated soon could after. Antivaxxers seem far louder actually represent. I’m cool didn’t choose wrong. best family do. child likely suffer minor illness super immunity future infections. interested RNA Biology grad school thinking questions getting vaccine. answered answer many kind terrified me, still got vaccine way right now. think completely unknown since ongoing (in vitro vivo) research Zika virus vaccines I'm really looking forward see data. active RNA lab now, I'd happy work it. Actually, it'd great RNA biologists organize discussion sessions could ask questions directly. I'm sure gets asked time around here, long COVID cough take go away? breakthrough case weeks ago cough symptom still kicking around. seems come I'm engaging conversation. Even SC cities 50%  amazing many people realize this. Viruses automatically become less deadly time. helps spread better. Average time death weeks, 24 hours like Spanish Flu becoming current flu. That’s said first second shots

Who said that? told spring 2020 *if* vaccine successfully developed, know long immunity last: unlikely years, possibly year, possibly less year.

Hope second doesn’t lol  UK determined kids little risk Covid even vaccinating them. perspective. kid gets exposed virus mean anything bad going happen. non event almost every case kids, likely become immune. Extinction event talking less 50% 1st world county's populations vaccinated

Did read fucking paper? 

There nothing supports claim it’s replication error causes mutations. assuming lot concept barely correlated virology new virus. don’t believe random shit internet without actual primary source behind it. virologist noone authority make assumption. getting fucking annoying fucking idea talking can’t even properly process source provided right front you.

Stop replying exact unfounded guesses spouting. It’s waste time.  study showing made outcomes marginally worse, doctors stopped prescribing it. (appropriately dosed) ivermectin (relatively) harmless easily available, demand shifted.

Bravo NZ Yeah ""like flu"" expression great mean whole range different things.

""like flue"" mutate maybe seasonal intermittent event even likely less severe influenza maybe correct.

 ""like flue"" mutate way influenza viruses technically less chance give covid replicate, law large numbers apply, mutations occur.

Yes still 30% globally first shot also realistic close fully vaccinated become regardless means 2, 3 shots.

We probably produce better vaccines/treatments later right highly contagious virus still exist vaccinated people everywhere fact even vaccinated might still spreading virus. Good lose mother too. may idiot, unless complete nut trash, still mom help it. Hopefully. think lot people lying getting third doses, artificially raises number.

Delta numbers still real low. People think covid alpha strain new beast....

I work factory, northern Ontario, 125 people across two partially three shifts. People 24 7 working. 

Only cases whole time, got away somehow masks like 5 months beyond everyone else....that's attitude here. 

Also mask tough guys, clearly anti Vax. 

Just waiting.... 

People let guard down, starting believe ""fake"" rhetoric ""where deaths, know anybody directly"". small-town minded grasp coming East coast. South North every state, destination Ontario. I’m sure insecurity sort plays part it. doesn’t bode well decent chunk population feeling threatened insecure societal political trends…. Well duh Brownies ""brownies""? 😁 Living legal state, might really effective getting people vaccine centers!  Yes okay run outside without mask on? 

Always been. Im Iraqi Christian I’m tell thousands years culture DNA taught us translate good book survival… point near future (months) virus run immune naive individuals. Everyone antibodies vaccination infection. take lot teeth virus, although still seems continue circulate due high R0. Lol, felt hit nerve fingers, felt like hit bone. Sucked, bad luck. Still, I'd rather feel like going cough death again.   It’s problem long *other* people suffer die. Yep, scientists know possibly learn seem think too. It’s contrast compared see reality everyday.  countries shit, yes Sure, spreading asymptomatically longer mean disease necessarily going less severe. Again, decoupling part mentioned, lack evolutionary pressure around severity discussed. Whether strain evolves also happens less severe certainly could happen -- one said anything ruling out, evolutionary pressure so.

Having said that, Delta contagious severe, assume enormous viral load. also shorter pre-/a-symptomatic spread period previous strains, yet out-competed those. Last year March 2020 indeed make much fun anti-vaxxers end going centers take jab afraid ridiculed die covid. Right now, 1 5000 per day. translates 1 14 per year. course, that's going average caseload 50 cases per 100,000 people right (about 1 2000.) surge areas, going higher, enough immunity, caseloads going fall likelihood breakthrough case well. *I would like thank community FUCKING getting vaccine*. hope see everyone next pandemic bubonic bacterial resident plague v3.0 hits us people start licking rats prove government lying pandemic. never saw credible post saying that. buried comments. would challenge find present math supporting 1/5000 per day.

The type data found example, cases Los Angeles County recent period time, 25% vaccinated people. 160,000 new US cases yesterday. 25% would 40,000 vaccinated infections. Compared total population that's one vaccinated person every 825 people US got infected half fully vaccinated, number comes 1/412. Compared claimed 1/5000. I'm saying numbers right, LA county might well representative country.  I'm saying used published data. I'd like see published data supports 1/5000. People say whatever want one checks internet spreads true. could well anti-booster people wanting vaccine go global. know exist. Staff anti-vax nurses got fired getting vaccine. used EMT, tell ""survive it"" very, different ""feel normal again."" many accident victims survive, months years pain, body functions never again. extremely date, majority vaccinated vaccinated since published. grasping straws, fearmonger Wow, that's insane, thanks source fun! 

:( Yep, 110 million donated US thus far: already Solidaritätszuschlag still paying reunion east west Germany.

We've known many many months point. CDC likes lie non-stop like come right say it. disease endemic we'll deal multiple new variants yearly--for rest lives. Yeah needle small really feel much all. jabs surprised little actually felt. Definitely less noticeable than, say, needle draw blood sample. Guess lockdowns stay, too, wonderful new government powers. coincidence. Hey what’s Venmo? know it’s much I’d like buy coffee something. Texas: wait til children born take lives... meh, 94,000 cases reported children last week. it’ll fine, let kids breath, yada yada… 25% American adults remain total a-holes. country US donating vaccines to. among unable get vaccinated, huge portion children anti-vaxxers. parents won’t willing let get vaccinated. Many ones screaming keep kids unmasked.

The fact 30% country unwilling get vaccinated ridiculously huge problem. Even assuming every child vaccinated, that’s ridiculous amount people.

While they’re unable now, doesn’t change fact parents still unwilling vaccinate it’s available. Except triaging. Deciding best chance surviving treating first. I'd rather  When? Would accept Ozzy?

I'm going rails crazy train.

Except Ozzy stupid, dude vaccinated happy Good also passed good milestone: [4 million vaccine doses million New Zealanders first dose, including 366,000 shots last week.*  Maybe, remains seen. also (thankfully) spreading quickly. really, truly did. There's lot changing factors, presence vaccine (remember pandemic unvaccinated point), kids person learning, governments holding dropping containment measures, brand new areas planet places like Africa exposed...but get 100% available population degree antibody/T cell immunity either natural infection vaccination (preferably latter), look see COVID risky completely novel population. There's many moving parts fear particular outcome. almost bit arrogant virus going whatever wants behave novel ways make history. might potentially still pressure evolve less severe. Yes, spread asymptomatically. even better would could spread asymptomatically longer. mutation allows may end causing less likely cause significant illness (such might happen immune system regularly wipe spreading period actually cause lot damage).

Ultimately, know do. level decoupling severity infectiousness, still lot ways one effect other, rule option completely. doubt it. would mean admitting failed. haven’t reformulated shot yet true booster smaller dose stuff ya already got. yes, people straight lying get third shot. That’s can’t wait see everyone’s face 100% vaccinated lol  C'mon this. Keep going (besides massive amount data derived every coronavirus) Huh? fully vaccinated aren’t ones “dying left right” 47% people unvaccinated 47% people “unwilling get vaccinated”. It’s 30 something % people *unwilling* get vaccinated 10-15% *unable* get vaccinated.


That’s clarifying  call flip-flopping backtracking could really gaining new information made realize current strategy flawed, willing admit change course. Leaders medical experts unpleasantly surprised much throughout pandemic. best way communicate understanding situation public, understanding constantly changing?  ? Flotting air though time really ""living"". Besides, many non-viral parasites least life stage leave host, towards another. Let's say ""Taenia"". someone liberates feces Taenia eggs, goes infect another being... said, leaves hosts body. vaccine get? plays slight role chances well. reason covid could mutate become like flu release new mRNA vaccine people get Pfizer moderna.

Pfizer moderna still high enough rates effectiveness wipe covid out. 

The problem people refusing vaccine distancing distrbution ;)  Exactly. time last year different world. Right state US life 100% back normal. Concerts, sell sports games, schools masks, etc. MasKs DoNT WoRk!1!!

/ugh Business closures 15 months, school closures 18 months, shelter place orders, mask mandates list goes on. vaccinated area country one lowest case rates still mask mandate. effect pushing back offices reopening, many postponed events like weddings, origination meetings, etc. also created sense fear community completely unnecessary. add health department projection mandate benefits metric, goal removed. health department's leadership embarrassment. 

The cost immense take years us recover from. counter point hospitals overwhelmed, start seeing higher death rates covid across board. 

So stress hospitals millions cases, expect medical staff burnout, lack supplies / beds, mortality rate covid diseases / conditions / accidents go up.

People don’t seem grasp exponential growth. high transmission area quickly grow become overwhelming. issue take would expect countries would ourselves?  I....don't think news..... goat meat spent night praying porcelain gods front porcelain thrones…  would expect breakthrough cases common couples close proximity participate activities expose high amounts virus. good reason actually, last time unauthorized vaccine legitimately terrible side-effects. Thats usually end nothing… Earl goes town errands... hope pandemic ends soon. feel sorry mental breakdown dieing.   get shit say Chinese government last time checked, contrary, elected fucking buffoon botched COVID response. That's we're talking about.  Right ABBA drops fist studio album 40 years, coincidence? Also would dangerous hypothesis use headlines. general public would ignore lockdowns confirmed “its like flu” However without vaccine much flu. always thought FAR longer 10 days. like 21 30. Probably 30. saw another"" anguished plea ""from couple werent vaccinated politics. overweight, frankly husband fire fighter, dont know passed physical. good 100 lbs overweight. know he's tall guy big boned beyond pale, say someone tall, big boned overweight.

Damn Texas bad every way symptoms?

You still get infected develop COVID.

That's important distinction right there. COVID Disease, status. AFAIK traceable amounts virus mucose (which gets neutralized quickly antibodies since they're faster respond known threat) test positive develop illness, whole point vaccines.

It’s also really important note method infection HPV uses extremely slow, may explain immune system vaccinated individual seems fight nearly 100% time.

It's real happens them. hero worship pretty disgusting. People followed career time know long history making decisions based financial gain, goes back decades coronavirus even twinkle bat’s eye. 

Make mistake, politician. fact saying right things right great, don’t mistake deep desire whatever best people. It’s largely combination politics covering ass, lucky happens align science time. Give call Glassberg pan out. mean like US Mexico moved quickly isolate eliminate H1N1 virus back first emerged 2009, locking entire regions anyone knew deadly would be, case covid? Oh that's right, work like that. response essentially let spread, US everyone else got lucky worse, covid was, although CDC say killed 150,000 half million people. People forget, want China acted know back December 2019, know later February 2020.

Compare timeline H1N1 response (Wikipedia's account it):

In April 2009, outbreak influenza-like illness (ILI) occurred Mexico United States;\[27\] CDC reported seven cases novel A/H1N1 influenza promptly shared genetic sequences GISAID database.\[28\]\[29\] similar timely sharing data Mexican isolates,\[30\] 24 April became clear outbreak ILI Mexico confirmed cases novel influenza southwest US related issued health advisory outbreak ""influenza-like illness United States Mexico"".\[27\] disease spread rapidly, number confirmed cases rising 2,099 7 May, despite aggressive measures taken Mexican government curb spread disease.\[31\] outbreak predicted year earlier noticing increasing number replikins, type peptide, found virus.\[32\] 
 
On 11 June 2009, declared H1N1 pandemic, moving alert level phase 6, marking first global pandemic since 1968 Hong Kong flu.\[33\] 25 October 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama officially declared H1N1 national emergency.\[34\] President's declaration caused many U.S. employers take actions help stem spread swine flu accommodate employees / workflow may impacted outbreak.\[35\] worked 80 hour weeks years. sympathy working hard. know many physicians work 80 hour weeks routinely. couple surgeon friends work 12 plus hours every day six days per week. extremely well rewarded hard work. sure physicians well compensated work too. not, consider different role, maybe family practice better suite them. feel bad health conditions tend need emergency healthcare. Hopefully put unvaccinated tents something Idaho don't, today least. following moderna years ago still trouble delivering mrna without fucking animals livers shit 2017 lol. wonder lipid discovered stopped giving everything hepatitis I’ve already seen age groups doesn’t account everyone become part group since timeframe took counts from.  know medical normally falls provincial, given national (and global) issue, seems would better federal government handled this. Say one travels different province? say home province one all? present visiting different province? piece paper enough circumstances, leaves hole counterfeiting. pharmacists generally know what's up, know booster sensible path forward, like vaccinations. That's pretty telling example hints origin conspiracy theory thinking. people drawn truth, isgoing everybody else thinks getting feel like something nobody else gets. him, ahead curve science originally seem validated rational scientific thinking (which obscure time). Instead emboldened rejection ""mainstream"" ideas. probably coincidence scary story latched onto beginning 2020 happened correct. downside? *dies covid 2055, also dying heat exhaustion walking outside 10 minutes* think one stupidity lack empathy.

But get degree. point feel like people need lay bed made. Particularly people party preaches rugged individualism self reliance. worst now. 

High chance child get mild illness.

Good use masks. Maybe, that’s half picture. read Boston 80%+ Asian-Americans Vaccinated 45% Black population gotten vaccine. I’d surprised Trump got 30 votes demo Boston. point don’t care motive getting vaxxed; You’re equally part problem. young lazy still hope reach. Anti vaxxers likely lost cause part. Anyone looked 1918 Flu variants changed would've seen commonality...respiratory viruses jumped animals humans, infect every organ body, use water droplets transmission. Plenty articles came late 2020 early 2021.

COVID19 correction gene made ability branch variants unknown quantity probably less influenza...the world successfully came hiderance. part yes, assuming big enough R&amp;D budget. Facial recognition already there, autonomous drones already specialized military usage, wasp-sized possible efficient embedded software advanced nanochips. IBM already developed [2 nm 50 billion transistors, enough compute power drone. -90 degrees probably feasible size, J&amp;J vaccine seems realistic. assumes size dosage combined size drone equal lesser typical wasp. Im sorry bro! mom seems frustrating..  thought vaccinated meant exposure coronavirus still produces good likelihood testing positive, body antibodies fight virus far effectively someone vaccinated. wife isolate

Oh get tested. plenty vaccines developed pass trials. One developed Australia, example, caused people get false positives HIV tests, abandoned - others problem already trials too. I’m really curious see things go NBA season cases still high. Preseason starts less one month.

Sorry rub salt wound, Sonics fans. OK, need one now. Even antibodies bit lower still strong T/B cell response would prevent severe illness ""High population unvaxxed""
Last heard 90% vaccinated, made mandatory. would call ""high population unvaxxed""  Same, kids little older. didn’t send back today holiday weekend. I’m connected lot classmates’ parents social media. saw vacations Florida, adventures crowded venues nearby. couldn’t send kids sit next kids could ‘contagious symptomatic’ window. appealed district switch us remote learning did. kids remote dedicated teacher, plus me. won’t fall behind academically, yet heart broken them. deserve normalcy interaction friends.  Everyone know using conformation bias justify waiting get one dose vaccine. tired this.  got this. Keep up.....   newspaper affiliated religious group.  Schools opened month ago. It’s kind shitshow. Yes, covid, also Radom bugs blessedly didn’t really circulate much last year everyone masked spaced out—yeah, everyone got sick something first weeks. Students parents alike. Welcome bugfest. turns people, except immune compromised / elderly, need boosters, soon. think that's trying determine. data Israel, I'm sure comparable enough answer questions. Union fought required vaccinations.   could walk get free booster tomorrow? Would legal consequence? actually protect 2 doses?

It actually seems like half decent idea lol, it’s like 25 percent people rushing get (or ever willing get it) there’s gotta tons vaccine stock sitting there. there’s negative side effects makes even safer, get booster? downsides? probably won’t don’t feel like it, see it’s tempting. though foreshadow panned years studying bacteria viruses survive... I’ve given up, kinda wish I’d die point cause really reason keep going Well luckily flu shots protect people getting it. Let's hope covid gets weakened due vaccinations Yes. amount misinformation going around pretty nuts. 


Media know communicate things fearmonguerers agenda pushers interpret way spew fact. 


You absolutely right reaching seeking answers.  


And welcome! Stay safe! :) Everyone gotten common cold. June July IIRC. That's definitely America. Certainly people refuse take vaccine stupid people actively wish unvaccinated people catch covid die. stupidity baffling Thank making laugh. Science hipsterism Damn long get jabbed one work better other? Like Advil Tylenol Yeah, are. Facebook good way get survey people, landed page full Ivermectin Hydroxchloroquine enthusiasts. group people convinced prayer covid pill cocktail save them. convinced hospitals issuing medication want covid pay. make sense. mentally gone. think nurses make $100k regardless covid. prioritizing donations countries vaccines booster shots here.   counter pain relievers work great. Plus age group remembers first hand time things vaccinate (polio, measles, small pox, TB etc.) could kill friends family. Vision times. Hahahaha really question? people think going disappear like magic act. Makes sense. guess goes ways depending situation. Grumpy cat takes crap one! Maybe best I’ve ever felt. Quit drinking. exercising regularly. Always strong sex drive. reasons well, feel like million bucks, tbh. Yeah, example 35 babies died Rock n Plays 5 years kind inclined sleeper banned illegal sell. 

It’s bad can’t somehow institute similarly decisive measures virus. Standardized testing stupid anyways. children going adapt, capable. think points one many flaws education system. still school superintendent dead set good scores would give school grant money, little actually educating kids. mother law works education (develops curriculum state) vehemently trying push kids things way covid, testing like long well. Glad made it! Burnout among healthcare workers places surges way past normal rates burnout. fact you’re equating doctors burning mass death overwork “Im tired working marketing” tells need know. You’re solipsist. 

I’m sorry didn’t want mass death like Texas right now, didn’t get go Coachella. Must hard. 

Tell schools parent two. many kids have? Anyone check Cancun? Lol. obvious start.

Thanks, unvaccinated morons. May get vaccine resistant variant (*will) make. actually unlucky virus isn’t deadly. would easier people take seriously, isolate tougher spread it, die it. Instead people show symptoms carry like normal dont think threat, are. anything alleviate side effects second dose Pfizer? haven’t gotten yet, want prepared case get fever, chills, aches, etc. medicine shown make day two side effects comfortable? Hospitals profit organizations. hotels run near capacity profitable. We're living two Americas ever before. way people act college classes *much* different way people act grocery store. I’ll curious see natural infection/immunity vs vaccine efficacy long give antibodies argument evolves next couple months study Israel, etc. think little sophisticated that, basically agree. merging entertainment, marketing, press, political institutions, social media amorphous blob can't tell one part begins another ends eroded people's trust complex nuanced routes peer review, fall back familiarity. suddenly find world ""I moron"" gives someone confidence framed diploma wall, simply relatable. That's generally call worm, virus. making donations top priority. People burn professions. I've changed careers couple times myself. bad shut schools 18 months. hadn't, perhaps would new grads ready fill in. 

It minor inconvenience want go grocery store. unjustified mandate many events cancelled. want participate things, luck. major life events like weddings others part living social life. 

Are elderly parents vaccinated? so, probably need protection unless comorbidities.

Yes, know delta variant contagious prone breakthrough infection. None really matters community 80% plus vaccination rate, mention people got immunity recovering community largely continued masking without mandate. 

As spouse physician, I'm sure know covid poses little risk children. in-laws may put different situation might mean makes sense cautious, mean everyone mandated cautious. point I'll happy majority heard immunity. I've lost sympathy hold outs point. point arguing people anymore. US massive population, large country. places hire population density higher vaccinations versus rural areas. Plus, south vaccine hesitancy, compared northeast west coast. 52% definitely progress. south dragging rest country father part late group. took losing brother, uncle COVID convince him. :( Moderna set start human trials experimental mRNA HIV many fucking times people need learn lesson “noble lie”? Ain't gonna good.   makes sense realize ""apathetic"" people scared needles admit it.  random mutation could occur bypasses vaccine works (by creating antibodies spike protein). happens, occurs mutation makes lethal, tear population new vaccine created.

The likelihood happening low, impossible. Considering what's sold OTC really there, surprising.  lot people long Covid recovering. takes time. There’s even subreddit long Covid recovery. Right hope they're past peak, another surge Labor day. quote Metallica? Huh, TIL Slavoj Zizek listens Metallica. That’s think. Glad got him!

My dad saying similar stuff sharing antivax links. 4 year old say “Grandpa please take medicine doctors telling take? love don’t want get sick.”

He got vaccinated next day jokes got son shouldn’t emotionally blackmail again, keeps sending antivax posts (I don’t know why, everyone 12 family vaccinated already). Hmm...perhaps start selling cod liver oil give snappy brand name, like **CODVI** something. know, short ""cod vitamins"". Vitamins vitamins D, give **immune system** **boost**. $100 bottle! people experience long Covid heads

Yes. agree. never said long covid people's head. Everything aside: good. hate needles got vaccine.

I'm also afraid heights gone free climbing, though, probably great source.  results cardiologist visits? wife going same. also 29. Oh understand country could get position debt sits 85% GDP. guys ever going pay off? ofcourse grey areas, discussing conspiracy dangerous.

Parroting disproven theories COVID, could harm thousands people, much dangerous imho.

I'm advocating silence everyone makes wrong dangerous statement, becomes dangerous give megaphone like reddit influence public opinion.

That's called 'deplatforming' 'silencing'. Freedom speech still respected (and Reddit even abide strict freedom speech laws, that's government), still yell idiotic statements town square care. Moderators also freedom set rules platform remove everyone abide rules. proofreading gene gets knocked out. ಠ\_ಠ news, water wet. already number significant mutations  Bruh

Sick burn! also totally cheated ""democracy mode"" thing :(

Would way interesting left IMO lol, npcs using moving goalposts part argument now? 
If nobody sees problem that, well. I'm sorry, lost. 
This going painful winter get saline. idea we'll Fall/Winter. Every shift come we're holding intermediate/ICU beds ER 4-9 hour wait times. 30-70 waiting room South Africa 40% reported deaths less 5% continents population. Covid outbreak really 8 times deadly elsewhere Africa? Considering one stronger medical systems Africa unlikely. far likely that, due relatively strong healthcare system, actually recording Covid deaths something approximating real rate. Sadly, means Covid deaths parts Africa likely several times reported figures. Except kills him, qualify charges manslaughter. said covid zero entire way through, states disagreed - even tried force states re-open start eventually conceded states demands.

&amp;#x200B;

As far outbreak goes, Western Australia, Queensland, Tasmania indicated may keep borders closed internally well next year (Tasmania saying they'll re-open 90%\_. Victoria keep closed everyone hits federal vaccination targets, South Australia saying they'll granular border approach they'll shut border selectively depending outbreaks states.

NSW state that's keeping border open, odd one entire way pandemic, hence finds situation in. got swollen lump injection site times. pretty sore.

Nevertheless... 

5 stars. Would again. rate virus mutate, mutate, become mutable? know progression works? R=5.08 40k/day triple December; they'll become 3.5m/day week. Well, yeah, course no, however mathematically wrong lockdown.

Remove lockdown/social distancing/masks *everyone* get Delta *by end month* ≈100% chance. Hello I'm back. Looks like 7-day average 150k cases per day (300,000 reported today, always higher beginning week).  I'm quoting comments. countries like US others available extra supply vaccines *OR money send vaccines countries* so.

not it’s humanitarian thing (which *should* reason), also it’ll help slow mutations overall help global supply market.

So get 'nearly guarnteed' conclusion? Thank    Man it’s sad we’re back point again… invent saying. looks exactly imagined info doctors live tweeting ivermectin patients, natural selection purest they’ve getting cases Mu since may, delta skyrocketed.

Agreed. flew Asia northern europe literally minutes borders closed everyone fully aware dangers, testing, masks, quarantine, nothing.

People say China locking earlier would prevented covid entirely, considering first cases Europe already October 2019 would literally difference end quarantining Wuhan earlier countries took zero measures towards containing cases entering borders.  Thanks Greg. delta, nearly guaranteed encounter perhaps even end year. Especially since still spreads vaccinated people. Sunblock reduces chances getting sunburn. put sunblock spend dawn dusk sun, might end sunburn.

It's sunblock work. behaviours put high risk, wearing sunblock emboldened so. still burned less badly, recover quicker, compared used sunblock, though.

That's vaccines. Places high vaccination rates relaxed restrictions gatherings increase transmission. like going sun put sunblock. Sunblock plus sun still means higher risk burn staying indoors shade sunblock - mean work pointless put on.

People begging go sun, got sunblock, went it. Totally expected see increase sunburns compared everyone staying indoors.

And understand concept multiple variables. I'm entirely convinced swine flu. Right started getting Europe playing massive international handball tournament, days got really sick. parents took hospital, doctor listen word saying, putting wrong things journal told take aspirin stay bed. Later realized basically every single symptom, would make sense catch people form world gathered one place.

This time around bothered talk mother one weekend told bed complete exhausted (total lie). got home Christmas told check gotten covid, make happy went quick test. showed weak positive. basically sick since pandemic started, came complete surprise me, considering swine flu plus really nasty bout pneumonia years back afraid lungs exactly top shape. least every single person know got vaccine soon made available.  saying vaccines allowed infected continue spreading disease they're designed for? That's true all.

Yeah no. got shit completely fucking useless, often actively harmful. Banning flights China virus already spread around world accomplished nothing (and setting policy consider testing people contacted someone traveling China moronic), amounting little racist/nativist posturing. kept insisting months didn’t need bother anything else done good job stopping flights China pathetic.

It's good path thought. However, needs include timeframe infection probability truthful relevant guideline. example, compare ""probability getting COVID next 12 months times probability side effects COVID"" ""probability side effects vaccine"". Not, ""side effects COVID"" ""side effects vaccine"". get vaccine 100%, get COVID (esp. 'the version vaccine protects vaccine's protection still relevant') isn't.

Chances get COVID next 12 months, need new vaccine 12 months. path map possibilities often conveniently left calculations. said Oil commenters beyond help reason. needed comment feel grounded. I’m baby 8 weeks, can’t imagine dying COVID. asked parents going get vaccinated boundaries husband set was, vaccinations = seeing grandson. 

They told go fuck myself, didn’t really expect anything different. don’t want deal bitching later realize aren’t kidding. fastest vaccine rollout history prior COVID mumps vaccine. took 4 years. take 10-15 years. idea talking about.

As soon people figured kids instantly dying fast adults, declared kids dont get COVID matter do. insane. That's viruses work.

We know childhood infections cause sorts lifelong recurrent issues, reason whatsoever assume kids *won't* longterm consequences COVID. can't know consequences decades.

Chicken pox seem bad - kids get fever itchy rash. virus lives dormant nerve cells life reactivate times stress debilitatingly painful shingles severe chronic pain called postherpetic neuralgia.

Measles seems like another fairly straightforward fever-plus-rash virus kids. decade later, survivors develop subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), neurological disorder disables kills them, way resembles initial infection.

So are, brand new virus know kills disables adults children acute time scale, people pretending there's chance kids develop major consequences time?

Nobody would conceive shingles would observing first child chicken pox. Nobody would conceive SSPE would observing first child measles. although bacterial viral, another example would scarlet fever - nobody watching kids develop bad throat infections would say, ""Hey bet there's gonna thing called rheumatic heart disease that's gonna fuck kid 40 years.""

We absolutely idea COVID kids look like 30 years. rushing find out. Mountain Dew conferred COVID immunity South would lowest infection rates US. Moderna  comments section tells need know Texas. Z  town achieved 90+% vaccinated, recently cases spiking again. vaccinated people getting delta variant. suspect new strain = new spike trend continue time.

The raw amount deaths lower per cases though, significantly lower. disease overwhelmingly kills old people. Old people vaccinated. Old people vaccinated largest driver deaths. second group older vaccinated people. good god though, took like 5-10 minutes waiting. (in chair, phone ffs) Shot took like 2 minutes, sit another 15 minutes make sure bad reaction it.

Nonsense. test done 3 days travelling, lots stories fake tests, sorts risky behaviours like going restaurants eat maskless lots tourists maskless, coming places might new variants hotspots.

Tourists pleasure seeking, want pretend covid, playground, real place. shit see do, trying enter stores maskless, using sanitizer Like Cuomo thinks turn botched covid response job oval office. That's detached reality politicians are. presumably update study’s website issue press release release preprint interim outlets reporting JCVI (the UK scientific advisors vaccination) review latest data study tomorrow, it’s unclear findings made public knowledge yet (depends much detail JCVI provides announcing decision third doses, study authors provide press release preprint soon Government’s vaccines advisory committee review crucial data study Covid booster jabs Thursday decision third doses could come end week, Professor Saul Faust, chief investigator Cov-Boost trial University Hospital Southampton, told initial results study reviewed Joint Committee Vaccination Immunisation (JCVI) week, committee set hold meeting Thursday. officials also confirmed presence what's known mu variant virus, described highly contagious potentially able evade vaccines.

It looks like south midwest needed good kick ass Delta get vaccination program. wish happen due misinformation politics. Hopefully, continue increase.  uncle, 2 lung transplants suspected case pneumonia (sans covid), waiting ER Dallas bed since yesterday afternoon. He’s careful entire thing are. first dose bad? heard people tough reaction first, hardly anything second. One theory heard strong immune system hyper-reactive first dose that's second dose phase them.  stupid part school vaccines *are* mandated, pretty much everywhere. People faxed measles, mumps, rubella, meningitis, tetanus, diphtheria, pertussis singling covid vax oppressive, they’re *already* vaxxed. anti-vax crowd small niche this, almost entirely focused Andrew Wakefield’s fraudulent autism research. 

Personally, think person doesn’t vax kids pay “covid coverage premium” taxes. societal cost pandemic reached point it’s lowered US GDP. disagreeing. pissed misinformation drug all.

Dumb question anyone national news press conferences talking many flu strains/variants turn year? seems like people understand flu vaccine works well flu B well others. Seems common sense covid vaccines would varying strengths varying strains I've lot people yell suggesting situation happen. are. happening.

The patient likely survive going vaccinated one. want us leave won’t anyone vote them! Hurray! Good job everyone Good, let's get restrictions futile point either get vaccine accept whatever consequences come way. Enough enough US also 42% obese back 1970. Obese people much less healthy. donors well financially invested monoclonal antibody treatments he's pushing mobile treatment centers. 70% 2 doses? That's awesome! Im Victoria, Australia spent 210 days ( lost track exactly) strict lockdown since March last year. 
The idea able leave house ship something food shopping 1hr exercise.....Heaven!!! 

Although WFH tax rebate pretty awesome year

Edit; forgot real reason replied ask, hospital fatality numbers you? get 2 plural appropriate anything 1? would thought knew comment realize I’m sure. Many people would still lockdown, attending events wearing masks vaccines weren’t around. Hang on, know song!

🎶 Come see real thing, come see real thing, come see... sucks type things talked developed pandemic plans infection control nurses. It’s worse ever imagined vaccination mask refusal! 
Governors right thing prevent harm! It’s hard cry defeat! can’t, stay strong don’t die survive!  Yes! tired headlines spinning everything negative light causing panic. I’ve coughing blood year half- fun lol k?  even insurance issue? Even UHC many beds staff.  1400 schools 35 states shut down/virtual right now, according news. Things getting bad… really hope big speech Thursday comes something, something soon. Numerous articles written India’s questionable testing numbers (as far back last fall) it’s hard say. China? Don’t even count lack full transparency. Jmo  Well hopefully got vaccine. Also o2 dropping low visit er happen sooner later. least call primary care Dr get opinion. DONT GO DOCTOR UNLESS KNOW COVID AWARE COMING.   worry plan involve shutdowns schools businesses again, etc. really rough extra unemployment over, government shuts everything again, people NOTHING. Could anyone share insights , greater 60% full dose vaccination rate UK US, US much higher death count day compared UK. seem represent population difference death count climbing towards previous peak. Genuine question. Check breakthrough cases /r/covid19positive sound different symptoms  hypochondriac 700,000 tests? second dose Pfizer pretty bad people apparently.  duration pandemic, much information gotten smart folks r/coronavirus.

I ask you, regarding Biden's new 6 step plan. feel involve states / businesses, schools etc., shutting again?

One thing saw yesterday, White House stated cannot mandate vaccines onto citizens. without option, option would complete, total lockdown virus stops surging, right? asking total layman, troll, trying start trouble... Even breakthrough infection mild could put immune compromised wife risk, may able gain adequate protection vaccine. see total win Back one several plausible hypotheses pandemic might develop. almost certainty, enough data back it.

Strange many people understand difference. Go doctor hopefully got vaccinated 5 months ago. PUDDING DON’T GET JAB?! guidance. catch different variant well within six months. numbers calculated based age 16+ population. numbers article based total population numbers. Odd. got Moderna one painful shots I've ever received. got vaccinated back March Virginia moved got second vaccine Washington. lost vaccine card. get replacement? Washington keeps records can’t find anything Virginia guess organ transplant patients cancer patients fucked guess. Good bye quality life. Especially organ transplant patients. Coming hot apple paste. would call parent next board meeting. Name shame. He's billionaire. Billionaires exist. He's hated anything does. got money exploiting hell millions people. waiting travel restrictions ease fully vaccinated.. Good. Nepal enough troubles without importing cases Covid.  That’ll it. cousin caught it, hospitalized made through. wants vaccine. realize would give fewer people shorter time period right? stories children coping Covid symptoms long term got pressure finally approve pfizer vaccine another age group, move 5 older, essentially covering elementary school children. Yeah, one silver linings covid didn’t kill young. Sadly, also meant didn’t take seriously, since many victims “were die anyway.”  think saying acted logically, would eradicated virus back normal now. 

Countries like NZ, Taiwan actual proof would have. 20 minutes potentially save life? eh... wait.




^^^^^/s There's point climate change self perpetuates even nothing bad. We're point. Melting polar ice releases greenhouse gasses causes ice melt cycle repeats over.  We’re fighting useless war middle east anymore, maybe finally put money good use. know random recently heard crazy facts covid vs Spanish flu. 

Covid currently 6-12 million deaths worldwide, mean age death 70.

Spanish flu 75 million deaths mean age 27. Vaccinate more, lockdowns. blunt stop-gaps didn’t vaccine. wrong telling last part? believe them? Go feds. wish getting Novavax US. overheard grandma zoom meeting church. trying educate members vaccine correct misinformation. Another church town registered official vaccine location early year. That's addition things like helping people need food storm shelter tornadoes last year. 

I worry stubborn 'god save me' types, seem like many churches going things right way. I'm religious anymore good gotta mention threads like this. Every summer last 5 years set new record breaking temperatures brought drought wildfires it. live northern canada, seen summer go 33C 40 years (and even weekend) month 45C summer. bad 48% US doesn’t wanna take goddamn shot. Bunch children. Yep! Plus bunch anti-vaxers die, helping denominator side equation!  name many zip codes statistically almost 100% retirees aren’t considered least middle class? sure can’t. 

Obviously low income poor people, don’t really congregate communities almost everyone else old. 

So again, aiming hit older population first, would probably lead clinics higher income areas.  Viruses automatically become less deadly time.

This, much this. There's little pressure virus mutate something less deadly infectious, spreads well is. People die COVID generally days weeks spread virus becoming hospitalized, intubated, dying. SARS-CoV-2 variants escape
neutralization vaccine-induced humoral immunity  They'll start giving bleach enemas next   Great, moron anti-maskers flooding since NNN ban. sounds amazing. would love link seeing it. going one grand unified exit restrictions. locale specific, people start voting feet. AZ/TX/FL, I'm sure lot states, life 98% back normal. NY others trying vaccine passports. Meanwhile, side world, Aus trying hard revert prison nation.

If can, choose live place levels restriction suit you.  Uh oh, goes narrative. Hmmm…could explain Finland many people unvaccinated proportion Florida represent?    sound catching en français: ""Pas de jab, pas de travail."" might change teams now. dallas fan entire life hasnt paid anyway lol   many people dead former surgeon general making fun masks Fauci saying necessary 

I'm surprised downvoted oblivion speaking God-Emperor-Fauci  far know, cure virus. mean treatment regimen--well, vaccines far best preventative, viruses really, really hard treat. nature, mutate become contagious/less deadly--they impossible keep (see annual influenza booster evidence that). Two weeks Labor Day gatherings US kicked wave 3. started slow right Thanksgiving Christmas, holidays kicked reversed course pushed us new heights. hope Biden’s upcoming COVID address nation about. Labor Day gather spread start things getting really bad 2020, coming fall much hotter last year. Instead demanding hospital try every witchcraft someone heard somewhere, free sign paper take husband home, that, gave whatever wants. site linked e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Yes, theoretically possible vaccinated person spread COVID, infected so. vaccinated person something along lines 5000 times less likely become infected unvaccinated person. obviously therefore translates significantly lower probability vaccinated person spread COVID. Another variant would've taken place. Without enough population vaccinated time, leaves nice cushy field hosts virus become contagious. would've exactly are. I'm joking. I'm prophet doom suggesting things things *likely* happen, think ignore real possibility catastrophe everything power defeat pandemic, nationally globally. Waiting 3-5 days exposure usually enough time show positive it’s enough vaccinating would enough, give up? Duh, anyone pays attention virus spreads mutates knows it’s never going away. Republican state, worry unborn ones forget live ones. good data soon. [Cov-Boost UK expected release initial findings month, potentially early week.

The study testing reactogenicity (side-effects) immunogenicity giving booster weeks full vaccination. vaccines tested boosters Oxford/AstraZeneca, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna, Novavax, Valneva, Janssen/J&amp;J Curevac (plus control group given placebo).

UK rollout 43.3% Pfizer, 54.2% AZ 2.5% Moderna, data 2 doses Pfizer followed Novavax booster come this. It’s proven safe human concentrations. Quite opposite horse concentrations.

Open hearing counter-arguments you’d like post some. Yes, they're weakened immune systems allows larger viral load become infected making spread. Also vast majority ICU overweight, greatly increase burden healthcare system. trying point ridiculous ppl say ""derrr hospitals turn away unvaxxed derrrrr"" slippery slope there.

***oh shit, he's vaccinated, guess gotta wait***  That's wonderful. Way brave! Texas major metro areas like Houston, Dallas, Austin, etc. Florida Tampa, Orlando, Miami, etc.

The northern part Idaho state large population centers. Spokane Washington side border, Boise towards south. normal times small town hospital get critical patient, would treat enough could ship one cities better medical facilities available.

However, COVID rampant over, locations capacity take in, small hospitals left fend themselves. Add absolutely abysmal acceptance vaccines area, almost inevitable would reach point.

We could’ve done dammit! could’ve done more! That's wrong. misremembered reddit headline day. 10% *hesistant*. way 10% Americans getting vaccine microchips shit. we're sitting 10% vaccine rate work. 

I think take area granted. 100% department vaccinated, 95% County work older age 12. lying said two different worlds. 'do', tendency report bad story much higher unremarkable one. mean, no? drunk driver injured accident, still gets treatment hospital.

Morality, stupidity, greed, etc aren’t factors hospitals judge treating something immediately life threatening.

It's hard, wear one work 12 hours day   virus doesn’t need inherently deadly kill people. kill people infectious. also kill people fewer protections place. kill people hospitals overwhelmed. Random?

Cite, please?  Yikes. Good luck. know elderly people went pharmacy said doctor advised get immunocompromised given third dose. also know someone works local hospital doctors given third dose. It’s sounding easier easier get without lying. Why? really 25% America dumb.. far? Antibody testing think/know it. Pretty simple. means 25% Americans still brain Flu vaccines weak compared COVID vaccines. produce cell response, hardly B cell response low levels antibodies. surface virus looks slightly different due antigenic drift (mutations), antibodies bind well left less unprotected. COVID vaccines hand produce much higher levels antibodies also strong B cell cell responses. B cell cell responses last much longer. Possibly decades. even surface virus looks different due antigenic drift, still protected severe disease due B cell protection.

As pancovid vaccines, already know people previously infected get current mRNA vaccine shots produce antibody protection currently known variants SARS-CoV-2 also antibodies bind SARS-CoV-1 also instance RaTG13 bat coronavirus Pangolin coronavirus (I can't remember name). also see third mRNA booster shot people SARS-CoV-2 naive (they (yet) infected) produce much broader antibody spectrum.

In words, seems already long lasting pancovid vaccines.   kind thing that's hard discover prove - exposed get sick.

Not hard prove all; think exposed get test. obvious takeaway article mask mandates still need thing still lot unvaccinated people there. Paywall isn't. get treatment massive bill without insurance(you could suppose). mention CDC stopped tracking (unless hospitalized dead) right delta came around. won’t ever really know   honestly don’t judge Chinese government strongly it. plenty things blame Chinese government for, COVID response wasn’t terrible.

It essentially local officials (who eventually got fired) hid virus, discovered days. within weeks realized virus super dangerous locked half country, kept lockdown months, virus gone.

I’m going blame entire nation local government fucks corrupt. It’s certainly institutional failure, blaming whole country seems heavy handed, leads people (not - don’t think you’re - less nuanced/low information people potentially), express racism Chinese people fit sub. this? Ugh bad I’m baby like 6 weeks. got pregnant vaccines rolled thinking would be, over, infinitely better. hospitals area 90-95% full flu season hasn’t even started. hate this. Michigan parent here. doesn’t take account kids opt take test could take test *in-person* worst surge cases state vaccines available 16. still hybrid learning time, wouldn’t even school day anyways. minority, all. 

Not trying dismiss issues associated disrupted virtual learning, pointing whole process dumb results gigantic asterisk them. test results year going reflect actual learning lot last year’s. Covid probably fully staffed hospitals. Hospitals always understaffed purpose make money, push drs nurses safe do. 

Now deaths medical staff (which don’t think talked enough), nurses/drs/techs leaving exhaustion ptsd, critically understaffed. much fear mongering, nipah new unknown virus, showed years ago entire outbreak controlled span couple months..and it'll much easier control possible outbreak we're already isolating covid. would less damaging host would less inclined isolate stop activities go bed, causing spread more. would less damaging would also become less deadly. spread 6 people kill host, killing perfectly good colony viruses well rough host slightly get infect 6 people?

If version kills infects 6 people one gets 12 people suddenly 6 people get 6 makes 36 infections deadly strain, 12 people get 12 making 144 infections less deadly strain. Suddenly less deadly strain much larger much present. example course bit simple bit limited, short explanation evolution virus. yes, kick virus subsequently die longer contagious that's none virus' concern, that's way people dying anyway.

And still fatal diseases, diseases always lethal first appear, new diseases appearing. Usually originate species, diseases might change completely whenever swap.

We've got stuff like influenza, originated birds. Birds get disease pretty much inherent affect much. strains adapted well humans damaging spread really fast. also strains really poorly humans, kill 50% humans get really spread.

There's Q-fever, predominantly spreads lambs butis really hard transmit person person.

There's MERS, Covid's older relative, MERS hopping around middle east killing 50% people get it, lot people get though people reall spread it, camels do.

There's aids, rumoured found way humans sexual contact primates.

And now, course, covid, rumoured originate pangolin I'm sure anything proven yet.

They're ones ""did research"", part complicated want feel special also belong feel powerful. It’s old either. Sept 8 (Reuters) - Switzerland tighten curbs public life Monday requiring people show COVID-status certificate access indoor spaces like restaurants, government said Wednesday, trying quash fourth wave infections straining Swiss COVID certificate provides proof vaccination, recovery infection negative test There’s underground illegal places everywhere, I’m talking legally.  Another example failed leadership.  goatee. corresponding shaved bald head. drive F250–way wickeder F150.

Also, I’m vaxxed, gladly masked, taking shit seriously since beginning.

I’m rebel. beds filled hospital unvaccinated idiots, yes, situation. blessed Dr Malone invented mRNA technology. listen more. irrelevant. flat many patients. could happen country even socialized system. lack UHC makes worse cause base issue. Chiropractors ambulance chasers' sidekicks. Even opposing players right? Right?!?! likely undercount. Infrastructure medical care horrible much subs sharia Africa. 

But looking back trip Kenya took 18 years ago many young people, like everywhere. remember curiosity picking local newspaper looking obituaries crazy see lot people died we’re Mid 50s younger. never seen anything like life.  

It stands reason overall younger population many people making 60 70 hypothetically end situation limboing mass Covid fatality bar.

It reminds read book called Emperor maladies history cancer. author world renowned oncologist reflects curious absence cancer historical literature. allow ignorance diagnosis possibility factors whatnot says logical explanation likely due fact cancers happen particular age range age range exist large population percentage worldwide time recent history. It’s numbers game. 

These interesting thoughts ponder. 

In end it’ll take decade tease out. Trust basic tenant society. betting 99% folks understand shared responsibility 1% won’t make big impact.  boyfriend got Covid back January never got it, three people house never got either. Well let us know happens. meantime continue deal the...the multiple severe strains... let's take example then:

an unvaccinated 25 yrs old comorbidities medical history

or

a vaccinated 80 yrs old comorbidities (obesity/high blood pressure)

considering factors, likely survive ? prioritized ?

let's honest read article, says guidelines, patients given priority scores based number factors impact likelihood surviving health crisis. Vegetarians rise up! Last time checked, chiropractors ~~aren't experts virology~~ real doctors. Lol good one That's fair. Repeat customers best them. went specific issue, afterwards also started stretches home keep issue coming again. doubt plenty would prefer keep coming years. Exactly. Delta's become prevalent quicker flu strains 2-5 years becoming dominant vs. 1 year Resistant bacteria’s MRSA, ESBL VRE transmitted food overuse antibiotics. Everything travels recirculate food, health systems. risk COVID MU strain won’t much different careful. never thought would say please give MRSA worry about. days over! There's one starts Face ends book. That's main carrier misinformation. isn’t insurance issue. basically war triage, it’s us saying would happen. 

If 1 dr treat 20 patients safely (but currently treating 40 overwhelmed), 80 patients need dr, it’s money that’s issue. It’s lack resources treat multitude sick people. 

People see lack “beds” think need put literal beds treat people. hospitals say “beds” mean space includes access drs, nurses, techs, medical equipment, etc. can’t wave wand trained medical staff. mention many staff died last year half, many leaving due exhaustion ptsd, less normally Covid.  EU solution also adopted Non-EU countries Norway. Guess ventilation technology needs get better fast. Clusters occur.  authorities reported Friday detected three cases Mu variant Korea.
All three cases overseas travelers Mexico, U.S., Colombia. arrived nation since May year.  matter once, he's fat, sedentary abd unvaccinated now. mention 50 ain't young.  What? that’s accurate.

Flu like 2-3 years, Polio like 1.5 years - we’re talking introduction vaccine candidate widespread adoption.

Flu created 1942, deployed military 1943, deployed civilians 1945.

Polio created late 1952, deployed early 1954. much schooling need order properly use term ""here there""? Or...everyone vaccinated catch covid eventually either survive mostly immune, die. 

I think anyone going avoid coming contact Delta.  think would opposite.

Sharing blood disrupts microchip tracking, *CHECKMATE*, Bill Gates! still say talk doctor actually listen advice rather going people Internet saying   people physics therapy longer lasting impact. Many people chiro end weekly monthly decades, Chiropractor wants obvi. thanks China 🙏🏼 kindly. Chickens sure Luckily, always made sure keep distance camels. Never trusted them. matter host dies not. long spread 6 people irrelevant die. universially ttrue fatal diseases. 

Covid evolutionary pressure less deadly, spreads plenty host risk dying. going switch vaccines?  Documented snakes, hamsters, really anything touch breathe air. Yeah can’t imagine people like “you 99.8% chance dick fall off” ""A lie gallop halfway round world truth time pull breeches on."" idiot.  Brand new sentence material    open medical records.  best friend’s family got struck. parents infected, they’re vaccinated, seems mild. little boy, however, seven Downs. He’s sick, too. Thank you, moron Florida. We’re terrified little boy multiple heart surgeries belt. Super Troopers! Give weeks, Delta begin unwind probably around Halloween

Mu already beginning, every state people treating like ""it's Delta I'm worried""

Which irresponsible frankly ignorant people US said Delta Indian problem chances low wont get here. 

Give weeks, already ramping   vaccinated got COVID before, studies showing immunity might better vaccines VOCs. Imagine spending rest life anti-vaxxer subjecting time, places go. going get worse, know that, whether agree not. pathetic existence. turned newt!

More testing needed

Also today, health minister Nguyễn Thanh Long sent urgent dispatch COVID-19 hotspots country - Hà Nội, Phú Yên Province south-central region, 20 provinces cities southern region, including HCM City - telling speed COVID-19 testing, key measure time localities stay social distancing, lift restrictions soon avoid prolonged lockdowns.

By September 15, households in high-risk and high risk areas tested least three times (once every 2-3 days), using either individual rapid antigen tests RT-PCR diagnostics with pooled samples.

In areas, households tested least once, using RT-PCR diagnostics pooled samples.

It's noted sample collection taking place homes or residences tested people.

Medical personnel staff working healthcare facilities and essential businesses tested COVID-19 every three days.

Health authorities also urged consider providing training demonstrations residents take samples themselves, guidance health workers. — VNS proof antibodies. vaccinated pregnant, advisement OB. Admittedly, April, enough data feel comfortable recommending -- especially since worked home.

I shocked many pregnant women going doctor's recommendation. daunting something doctor's recommendations pregnant. get told avoid many things *because kill baby,* whole situation daunting scary. remember feeling torn awhile, took discussions doctor friends sway then. Apparently joe rogan upset media reports taking ""horse dewormer"" threatening sue cnn.  know getting downvoted. definitely viable scenario.   definitely give uninformed opinion fucking medical issues.  get another dose vaccine later point, booster shot. Wtf talking about? Whether officially recorded one change is. Professor Fauci people eating horse paste: ""This time use that!"" mentioned news story people Johns Hopkins personal friends. Didn’t think story you. Thing is, noticed many anti vax people heavily pro vax areas lie avoid shunned, regardless around. I’ve paid attention taken note people are. yes, shun them. Oh well.   WONT SOMEONE THINK CHILDREN Reread post. still think that’s argument want go with, logic change mind. logic won’t work, it’s debate. Nope. Death normal. Already move. This. nice throw money cure keep dying otherwise. 90% rest population could say ""No big deal, I've got stack $100 bills right here. I'll right rain morning.""

Joe Rogan suck bag dicks.  FDA approval means doctors option use off-label. So, doctor give booster want so.

He’s doctor  Ummmm... China's vaccine mRNA seems okay. also developed earlier western ones.

I'm 67% sure went mRNA route Trump others throwing money saw opportunity develop technology. 

Not saying bad thing apparently they're actually close HIV vaccine it, yeah... I'm sure technology integral simply producing vaccine. maybe decide shut things get (are getting) people killed speak.  agree, hoping strikes made material gains treatment options  remember people scoffed idea 100,000 dead Americans COVID-19. think we've finally gotten point we've given predicting many people die disease.   Gyms without masks open... Hardly COVID restrictions place one wears masks anymore. would expect? History cannot save us present. I'm tired statement forms, clearly DeSantis like care nothing judgement history.  Great take - especially last sentence. parents boomers, lean right politically, think anti-vax weirdos completely insane selfish. folks grew kids still getting polio dying completely preventable diseases today's standards. polio vaccine considered god damn miracle back then. generational divide Covid vaccination pretty wild think getting shot solely based age demographics. totally crosses political spectrum personal values. There's subset people middle years never experienced pandemic/epidemic lives completely dumbfounded approach it, eat misinformation, trust anything except social media bubble. wild.

I living/working South Korea 2008 20xx Swine Flu (H1N1) huge deal there. esoteric threat since definitely contagious Covid, Koreans still took precautions simplistic sense (wearing masks public transport, offices, etc.). dumbass 20-something fully grasp either, decided mask public transportation flare ups H1N1. Felt weird, got quickly realized norm there. People Asia generally wear mask feeling ill take public transport. Parents send kids school mask kids seems unwell. about, ""Hey, I'm feeling good. I'm wearing me."" Life continued normal Korea Swine Flu present government enacted restrictions (mandatory quarantine visa holders arriving, testing, etc.).

Anyway, I'm glad got Swine Flu. shit joke either! comprehend lead singer band love (Broadcast) died tail end pandemic. damn, really? Swine Flu? Kind puts perspective thing real safe matter much ""trust"" immune system. Chiropractors quacks.  Don’t know? vaccine doesn’t go restaurants.  I'll getting booster shot tomorrow.

The good news get COVID. ordered test days later negative.  Even TN, we're 59% ages 12+ one dose (this versus 73% US). definitely higher, terrible might expect. also higher urban counties rural ones.  Mild felt like bad cold fatigue. 2024.  

[here   Hmm really answer question crazy unstable things

This essence referring to. I’m sure “the light end tunnel” makes worse better honestly. seems approach greater system taken.  Or, know, get vaccine. seeing 1m doses per shows ~750-800k  exactly situation hoped avoid earlier shutdowns, mask mandates, social distancing. deeply disheartening see US largely given trying mitigate effects pandemic. substantial minority US population seems vehemently opposed receiving vaccine - best chance one avoiding severe illness. 

But current wave Delta-variant infections severe because, order really suppress it, everybody ought minimizing movement homes masking do. Also, start pandemic, need testing, contact tracing, monitored quarantine.

It realistic expect things now. barely done past. showed none intelligence South Korea, Australia, even Vietnam used repeatedly crush waves infection. result, seeing terms overburdened hospitals EMS taste likely see 2022. misinformation killing them. rates quackery chiropractic unfortunately high. try science based, even quick check local chiros websites youll find lots promoting stuff like homeopathy acupuncture, claiming treat stuff like asthma.

It'll interesting see comes research. far, mu variant doesn’t seem spreading quickly: accounts fewer 1% COVID-19 cases globally.  mu variant “is interest us combination mutations has,” said WHO’s Maria Van Kerkhove. “But doesn’t seem circulating.”  U.S. “paying attention it,” isn’t considered immediate threat, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, top U.S. infectious disease expert.

It also makes feel even horrible animal rabies already did…what horror. It’s heartbreaking, actually. 

That’s it…Next time go camping I’m wearing snake boots Kevlar suit. Seriously, thinking every time now. live MA, got vaccinated, got positive result

N protein antibodies terribly useful neutralizing virus either inside virus. best useless worst causing auto-immune disease. can't fight virus n protein antibodies. fear thing, worst Delta yet come northeast. may highest vaccination rates country, also highest population densities country. latter terrible disadvantage pandemic.  Roll tide curious too, cdc information? mean one shot better nothing (aside J J shot) helping getting herd immunity. think get point, anyway. Yup, that’s immune system trained fight virus. I’ve similar reactions flu shingles vaccines. great number won’t booster. Biden still waiting CDC. Best case we’ll start boost front line medical workers nursing home residents mass, Thanksgiving  course, heard efficacy infection drop Israel study, first time heard big drop efficacy severe disease/hospitalization.

If that's case, need booster shot.

They talk topic around 22:30 podcast. Narrator: parade went without crowds. don’t think it’s full 50%. think dumb ones bullhorns. back normal September 2021. live NY, recently went long Island work. Less half places went dinner asked proof. live upstate upstate dont give shit. spend alot time PA well also give shit. north east dont really care either keep reducing cancer deaths, like reduced half 2020?Will guy got shot 3 times head still alive avoided covid? Definitely try coffee, might help hurt :) basically live espresso made sure least one shot.

If help, advil make migraine bearable least. Luckily first day headaches gone, yeah weird fingers expect all. Even toes hurt bed chills came, lots people said felt too. inflammation guess.

Feel better! :) Resign? dawg, time legal action. troopers need J-A-I-L think there's two ways take person said, one joking one serious.

If person joking argument likely based CDC FDA acting US rather actual science. CDC FDA stickler following rules much possible, far countries, fighting anything deviates rules delaying second doses mixing different types vaccines. joke booster part ""rules"", CDC FDA would ignore WHO.

There's also partly serious argument ""fully vaccinated"". People calling boosters view us already fully vaccinated, able live life fullest booster might change percentages points. view favorable taking boosters immoral. hand, people calling third shot view us partially vaccinated, still moral obligation minimize contacts wear masks vaccinated people still spread disease cascading effects cause hospitals become full. much complicated situation, could argue country's responsibility citizens first even could help another country bit more.   been, less, since around April May 2020. couple outbreaks dozen people  type work industry certainly makes difference, collaboration reason office always hard sell me. think issue lot companies still adept setting remote workers success. also distinct lack effort put forth mamagement adapt current technology.

 work field deemed essential hybrid in-office work. little change productivity, collaboration, meeting effectiveness yet reasons hear fully remote working possible. live world constantly connected communicating people screens technology use. Yet comes work white boards, water cooler talk in-person meetings way forward? data simply comes remote work driving lack productivity teamwork. opposite proved true. 

My final thought this: enjoy certain aspects coming office, given opportunity. done enjoy working remotely. Hybrid-remote, me, still in-office work. also option. viewing either or, one side wins situation. three options available moving forward, focus companies encourage continued collaboration essential. different people, capable important contributor company working home.   Wow, troll wild. bad literally nothing pathetic, miserable, stupid person like could ever say upset me. fact, gave good laugh great lesson engaging obvious idiots! Lol Thanks contribution conversation. live NJ, really hope get surge fall/winter, won’t nearly bad previous waves. advantage high vaccination rate, also disadvantage high population density. population density huge reason hit hard first wave April 2020.  sound like loser  covid-19 gone there? (barring outlier cases, etc.)? Assuming US, immune suppressed, already eligible third shot. may may asked details condition—my mother law asked, another family member not. guess rich people already got booster shot They've never party serving Kool aid everclear guess that's good?

It's always crying assholes...have shocked toss ""big strong men running me"" it. Possibly, general absurdly studied area health. general, makes logical sense immense system would affect menstrual cycles. know mine couple months post Covid vaccine, back track now. Mu easily outcompeted Delta. vaccine helps catch Covid 20x less often

In New York City recent data shows fully vaccinated people 2.2 3.1 times less likely unvaccinated people catch COVID-19.

[Graph one location, doubt order magnitude general case. used call ""Best Lie"" prices actually lot better used be, price match lot stuff. they'll also still try sell $60 gold plated Monster HDMI cable, lol. skipped two cycles second Pfizer. horse medicine, goats soda next logical step treating coronavirus. Yes, head pounding know mean fingers hurting! It’s oddest thing. course, I’m coffee addict haven’t today, could explain headache lol. I’m glad recent one easy you! factors might play significant role data might interpreted? example, something like higher percentage vaccinated people cities, highly populated areas also disease spread easily? I'm fishing anything specific, curious things might play numbers beyond baseline vaxxed/non-vaxxed. last big event required vaccination. I’m sure November. It’s mostly families go parade kids can’t vaccinated yet. sure! going lie. fan Lamont became governor. seemed like another touch rich guy string touch rich guys nominated parties. he's least shown manage health crises better called leaders country.  isn’t super surprising even unexpected. Ovulation easily delayed type strong immune response, thus causing disruption menstrual cycle. see process occur illness stress. best friend 50s edging toward menopause. hadn’t cycle 17 months…until two days second Moderna. really pissed. Thank information! I’m post menopausal, uterine cramps vaccines. idea saying then. act like large events restrictions, isn’t true. disappointed people didn’t get sick outdoors concert? imagine many different factors play like long since inoculated, viral load exposed, personal health immunity, etc.

But one thing seems remain consistent, preventing hospitalization even death thankful for. second shot, food tons water helped lot along one advil. Make sure eat even hungry, really helps.

Those symptoms lasted less 24 hours, week aches stiffness groin fingers oddly enough. Still uncommon, immune response. stay super hydrated, eat full meals least snack throughout day, maybe take vitamin eat veggies, water water water lol.

Plus tylenol advil (either work) hurt. Oddly enough, third shot Pfizer *way* better second me. minor headache day, whereas second shot gave awful migraine. really sad barely 1 year w/o period figured fully menopause. got second Pfizer dose spotted 4 days. Nothing since then, thankfully 1 million people gotten unauthorized third dose, that's probably undercount.  Color shocked. Actually, 1 million people gotten unauthorized third dose, that's probably It’s looking like recovery natural infection vaccination going push seroprevalence ~80% pretty quickly. Delta going immunize people whether want not.

Getting immunity though vaccination obviously preferable since lowers risk death hospitalization order magnitude. really mental gymnastics prefer infection replicating virus rather couple shots.

Cell-mediated immunity more
Long-term antibodies really decrease effects subsequent SARS-cov-2 infection. dunno. Maybe next year? Surely virus naturally die manageable level us vaccinated treat like flu. also looks voters.

Just ask redline Baltimore. I’m fully vaccinated (Pfizer) last 3 cycles since time length intensity. also major side effects jab except sore arm instances. 🤷🏻‍♀️ chief also encouraged air travels last year reluctant call covid pandemic. really responsible global crisis? Well, US completely suck... There's pretty big disconnect internet real life right now. I've living pretty much like normal Michigan, lot people are, too. weekend went Bob Evans crowded almost exclusively maskless people, workers customers both. There's little afraid anymore. I’m there. Yes every epidemiologist virologist said concerned could like flu. one time knew definitively weird people trying make point like matters. one said 'listen us, stay like flu.""

There ""waiting proof."" one knew enough covid make statement confidence. Rush Limbaugh said covid discredit Trump make Rush Limbaugh good source. think realize much changed hospitals past two years stemmed us going ignorance experience dealing wirh covid. Yes, happen sick, stressed, even diet activity level changes significantly. Sometimes I'm travelling period comes unusually early late. 
I personally find overly alarming vaccine may changed women's cycles, definitely studied. 26% vaccinated (160) sample size 601 hospitalized. 

Yeah ...I'm entirely comfortable stats (in immunocompromised / vulnerable cohort). figured publication going make bold statements like ""1 10,000"" chance getting breakthrough infection would probably least provide link data brought conclusion. expand exactly data comes beyond one sentence dedicated it. 

Believe want buy ""estimates"" completely hard accept NYT said so. tried Google search Utah data admittedly spend much time find anything minutes.     I’d get tested Obviously comment simplified case

obviously wrong corrected Long Island part NYC, Queens is. kind ties back covid.

We *extremely* fortunate live do, modern medicine able treat prevent many severe illnesses. able live lives largely free ravages disease, unless get exceedingly unlucky.

As result, many us completely unable fathom kind damage disease *can* - hence antivaxxers antimaskers like.

So long people able read disease understand important take precautions (like you), things work well. Sadly, however, far many people think direct experience somehow relevant, think personally impacted it, means precautions warranted. unfortunate, understand expected higher degree surface transmission (an educated guess based similar viruses) thought increased use masks public would result increased transmission. 

They changed recommendation could see primarily transmitted respiratory droplets.

There also paradigm shift filtering incoming air protect filtering exhaled air protect others, forget fits timeline whether really factor recommendation.  Love idea ""layman's thesis."" Mine optimistic. think Delta rise places previous outbreaks widespread immunity, fewer communities made largely immunologically-naive bodies. states experience absence wave; experienced wave everyone else favorable weather conditions, started rose slower already falling. kind flattened curve will, believe, inoculate states could've much worse wave. see evidence places like Maine Illinois, *are* pretty bad waves, unvaccinated counties. anywhere covid go. Americans like blaming foreign countries problems. one thing I'd add caveat crime rates vary widely based geography, careers listed much. risks cop inherent job. They're function violent crime gun ownership rates, vary. Worst frat ever. People becoming numb scary delta, media fearmongering 'mu' now, despite present US peaking July, dropping (tanking) prevalence since Delta started emerging. non-story. almost year ago, also found covid got vaccine protection.

they also referring plasma only, news item. There's great passage Jared Diamond's book *Collapse* last tree Easter Island.

Everyone could see trees used up. yet, despite obvious, people kept cutting trees.

Tragedy commons. clear, rate breakthrough cases still around 1 10,000, means even 40% recent cases vaccinated, still 1 10,000 vaccinated population.

There huge vaccinated population US, around 180 million, even rate 1 10,000 that's 18,000 cases.

Many people misinterpret headline mean 40% vaccinated people gotten virus nowhere near case.

Cases 10x common unvaccinated, lead serious illness. Like Americans ever needed help.  Hey, news article January, must certainly accurate now.... much support lockdown(s) believe taken best path forward, I'm going pretend every country could done same. many factors involved. first world, low density pretty big plus countering Covid. article Jan 2021. refers convalescent plasma.

Convalescent plasma shown ineffective treatment C19, article ancient COVID19 information standards. Thank reassurance. hate they're going this.

State health departments guess? reliable it? available online see it? twitter thread shows breakdown cases state strain, showing Delta wave dominant almost everywhere including men take account people uteruses whole lives, say something up, they’re irresponsible hysterical. It’s funny, women reporting start, knew significant blind spots research re:pregnant women, yet people still, year 2021, decided act like women simple know bodies. Stunning. really sucks happens. small arms probably didn’t help. painful flu shot ever, nerve pain arm couple days. Luckily last Pfizer shot felt pain free. almost elated done hardly felt it. Can’t say night symptoms started hitting though. Portugal poor country, despite whatever pretty picture news try paint abroad. us RELY solely public healthcare simply ""tough out"". still complain (as should), mostly want it, less ahah  sound like getting rabies vaccine would reasonable precaution you.

It's still exceedingly rare, put heightened risk.

Once vaccine, worry free :) Put request r/dataisbeautiful  also north/mid-east masks required places months. never understood vaccinated people need wear masks. Breakthrough cases 1 10,000 range. I'm wearing mask prevent 1 10,000 risk seems pretty pointless. mean Javascript*. Java different thing supported browsers anymore. :) study valuable, however uses particles particles ""approximately 1 μm mean diameter"", smaller many respiratory particles transmit Covid.

There larger particles considered ""aerosols"" still ability hang air extended periods time inhaled, mention ones sometimes feel skin talking certain people can't seem 'say it' without 'spraying it'. Imagine one people running around conversations contagious. could wear mask time.

Anyway... masks poor job filtering aerosol particles may still provide adequate protection exhalation larger particles, therefore statistically lowering chances infected. Colleges interesting relatively closed environment, people go stay close proximity months go home.

K-12 schools different people commute would spreader hot spots. suspect every region see bump cases soon K-12 schools open. **Most** children low risk all. FWIW, I'm one people would pretty much fine wearing mask public foreseeable future... I'm curious grounds they'd sue, specifically make choice give one, one, available ventilator to? \[Replace ventilator scarce item could save *only* one life.\]

I get people try sue anything want, I'm really struggling seeing grounds even come close legal victory there. like Patient B would ignored either, rather would probably receive palliative care nature help last moments less painful.

People listen says follow lead. son friends vaccine skeptics Joe Rogan. swears ivermectin vitamin B12 suppositories effective COVID treatments, it’ll hard convince otherwise. havent investigated fully. think younger healthier vaxed ppl getting hospitalized all, comorbidities still risk vax.

But show transmission still totally possible vaccine.  Happened 20 year friend Trump elected. always bit stupid, lives Florida, bought Russian propaganda.

He's type calls web designer actually designs wordpress websites. better ignore things can't preform research?

 waste time going school actually learning peoples research?  high enough vaccination rate. schools opening up. things combined Delta…..boom extremely high hospitalization rates.   Right, saying ""I used Ivermectin believe vaccines work"" followers knows ignorantly follow every word sure seems like coerces dong right public well being. 

Maybe along line yelling ""FIRE"", ""He's got gun!"", full theater without basis fact, reasonably knowing people could maimed/killed statements.    agree. Extensive testing requirements among players still allowed COVID cases. Extrapolating number fans, allowing test place vaccination result *hundreds* cases among fans. stupidly irresponsible policy shows teams trying maximize revenue actually care fan safety. People stay away policy changed vaccinated fans only. Testing good enough.  agree disagree. debate 3 true friends 25+ years positions anything. used 4th list, handle fact disagreed new alt right shit, constantly would try debate show light. would lead punches thrown. Sucks too. Known guy nearly 30 years went fucking rabbit hole came back racist science denying asshole know separate dogmatic dribble chilling friend. yeah. science part it.  Joe Rogan getting something completely wrong, wow often happen?  People really dumb, accurately overestimate smart humans are. Humans generally gotten much smarter, better educated specialized, better education always result better critical thinking skills.

Its weird people consider realistic/pragmatic, yet scenarios like people unrealistic influence self proclaimed idiot have. turns people really dumb enabling someone like Joe calling idiot blaming people listen harm good.  literally is. aware many views gets across platforms? aware compares average mainstream media news broadcast? (They’re dwarfed comparison) even hugely impactful movie tv show? beats forms media EVER, certainly individual human beings. choose believe alcohol reduced severity breakthrough - alcohol disinfects! :-)

In seriousness, high doses alcohol [has certainly suppress / strain immune system. Remember *vaccine* actually protecting Covid, immune system. still need responsible stay healthy. Joe Rohan look like Gargamel? saying didn’t break ankle, bone sticking out, covered ace wrap 5 days? weren’t hospitalized iv antibiotics set bones back alignment splinted 5 days swelling went enough could surgically repair ankle?

I say someone also messed fibula dislocated ankle, mine wasn’t open skipped er went ortho set bone splinted sent home 5 days allow swelling go could reattach bone ankle joint.

I’m curious, hospital course may similar without covid  one taking medical advice him. people watch show guests. fact checks goes unbiased opinion. People mimicking Joe listening doctor on/talked about. 

I'm curious people asking got better 3 days took. put your's other's lives risk understand science. don’t know downvoted, agree it’s likely Delta variant, work insurance company least 5 variant strains documented tracked. Though it’s going keep mutating people don’t get vaccinated follow proper safety measures. long mutations continue arise pandemic simply go on. stores reserves second dose. I'm amazed moment lost respect him. know moment? Almost certain democrat minorities getting affected. slice electorate leans dem avoiding vax. also know minorities getting hit hardest poverty/underlying health conditions. first time allowed spread disproportionately affecting democrat areas. assume data shows something similar. However also think people dumb af people affected may even people voted base crazies always votes without failure. think bites ass honestly, hopefully.  state (Missouri) 54%, 46% fully vaxxed 😒 hope told dad part health two year old responsibility. think really contributing? thought fair amount vaccination there. sad see need approach people believe stuff lowest level possible. Evidence useless stupid ignorant know evidence is. want reaffirmed everyone fine there's nothing worry about. people stupid scared reason with. Joe getting way much exposure, that's wanted.
Stop giving asswipe stage.  Rogan ever gotten anything right? saying complete bullshit?  Trump family still roaming free, would surprised change anything...Do you? Seriously?

Seriously?   social media comments ""stop spreading fear"", ""stop lying"", ""it's flu"", etc., etc., etc. sad thing is, morons turning friends neighbors doctors nurses, going need help they'll screaming rights. mean sure, lot people take Rogans medical advice likely always will, would disagree scientists experts. Social media proliferated virologists, epidemiologists, immunologists, doctors, etc blown past year half so. Specifically Twitter, lot experts fields often communicate science lay person informative, engaging, digestible threads often transparent informative official public health institutions.  wife’s period way off. period comes goes routine various lengths times.  Imagine willfully spending time someone stupid literally think know professionals working field. Depends are. US pretty vast, condense vax rates general percentage see news filled hospitals various states, states aren’t near hospital capacity aren’t likely reach it. doesn’t really make sense expect take restrictions needed lower vax states.  Sending good vibes grandma Coronavirus cases showing new signs slowing across many parts state, led improvements Southern California San Francisco Bay Area, areas rural Northern California Central Valley continue struggle much higher rates hospitalizations, according Los Angeles Times data analysis. study exists hints Ivermectin might positive effect? would take single reputable piece data even *suggest* positive effect make OP's ""At best"" statement true. say Ivermectin offers marginal benefit. said ""**IF** *anything* positive, marginal.

Police officers come #22.  Labor day weekend house  degree medicinal scientism real better sentence forming effects Alpha Brain. ""I'm stupid."" ~ Literally Joe Rogan.   Yes! First step commenting Reddit threads him.  he's wrong this, may wrong trans-medium alien spacecraft.  FYI, probably study you’re referencing. July, effectiveness infection considerably lower mRNA-1273 (76%, 95% CI: 58-87%) even pronounced reduction effectiveness BNT162b2 (42%, 95% CI: 13-62%).

TL:DR; Delta became increasingly prelavant, Moderna 76% effective stopping infection, Pfizer dropped 42%. 

(Results we’re different states/regions study looked, Moderna always came top). 

I’ve seen hypothesized places likely primarily due combination larger Moderna dose, longer interval doses. 

Keep mind *both* vaccines still 85% effective preventing hospitalization studied period. “Joe Rogan getting completely wrong”, say people Joe Rogan talks virtually anything. 18 months I'm still using crappy surgical mask

What reliable place buy KN95 style mask?  Well reason don’t think they’ll get even won’t bad. get bad. That’s perfectly reasonable response, even first refusal entirely unreasonable.

I agree it’s infuriating, don’t think people die refused treatment they’re fucking morons. That’s terrible precedent. talked trash California set move tax free Texas hit big pay day. foo credibility. Joe Rogan trash It’s probably nothing. I’ve read people ran fevers 24-36 hours. 102 worth checking case. Hope feel better soon.   No, deems someone expert proper education, time practice, endorsement peers… amount people audience. Cmon man basic stuff. He’s podcaster likes mma, working out, smoking weed. He’s evil deity who’s kill people. crazy talk. nothing compared climate denialism going us.  going suck joe rogan recovering well fan base going use proof  misinformation spread clip saw? prescribed ivermectin doctor, also doctor Japan studied affects ivermectin treating Covid. Everyone wanted get real sick it’s sad wtf wrong people. sick like day, 99.9% people fat old.  Finns could read comment steam, would furious! Naahh, he'll fine. There's huge market fear there. Fear addicting. Fear makes dull life seem alive. Fear incites anger blame lets people forget faults. He's stay unfortunately.  Can’t even call joe rogan moron :(  Siouxsie Wiles (NZ microbiologist often TV here) media presence explain complex things simply. knuckle-dragging morons attacked mercilessly. don’t see anywhere near much 2020. popular say wants. CNN jealous views. Dudes talking whack shit years, that’s point show. fan take everything medical advice. need end 24 hour news cycle don’t bother covering shit like this. even dumber Trump's bringing light inside body question. birth control, finished cycle week Moderna shots. began bleeding two days dose, lasted 3-4 days. incredibly unusual me, so. monoclonal anitbodies also manufactured cell line kidneys fetus aborted 70s. would think would REALLY opposed it.  podcast, Dr. Fauci said preprint study Israel indicated efficacy severe disease drop 98% mid 70s . seems big news me. one hear study? PR departments promise cure everything within 5 years. latina dropped sanders cause lmao works, hounds guests annoying repetitive questions casually accept nonsense comments order move on, spends rest show gaslighting listeners nonsense ""experts"" ""accepted"". No, happening long Trump continue forever.  would that?

CSI it. Outside American South/Midwest, deniers Covid's seriousness Greece anywhere first Joe Rogan spreading misinformation years think he's bad person per se....he ignorant. would actually listen intellectual guests discussing expertise okay second guessing woo woo opinions, would much better host imho....but dude believes BS invites cracked guests like Alex Jones, actually sells advertises products therapies modern day snake    100% big fan podcast beginning used talk stand earning stripes road yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah. saw comedy act learned funny. carry weight though. successful podcast time. reach vast many listeners put trust says (for god forsaken reason.) dispelling myths falsehoods promoted platform done hope least people swayed reason. interview treated covid last straw listening show. First raided walk-in medicine closet. would expected guy takes many supplements. Problem is, Joe Rogan doesn’t fucking care. It’s keeping name headlines that’s needs. Best thing utterly ignore him.  I’m gonna sit medical degree talk medical degree discuss best ways fight COVID (or something like that) - Burr Burr. I’m guessing didn’t take advice sort equitable *material* relationship relevance category compared to.

Do exist? Obviously. make category describe them? Sure. useful reason so???

What reason? practical value believe served? 

Surely insisting vaccinated carriers relevant impact mutation comparison unvaccinated... Right???

I honestly trying come scenario policy change could come exhaustive look vaccinated carriers, *only* possible solution would re-mask/quarantine everyone regardless vaccine status. already something gets lot discussion. arguments social economic, scientific.

So again, reason try pin vaccinated carriers?  That’s well documented fact. Check history books W wheel you’ll see right there! he’s well aware, be, lull soft-headed listeners false sense security. He'll apologize fans think he's great capacity admit he's wrong. Post viral syndrome thing. really massive consensus long Covid much worse. course, something labeled Covid, people far sensitive ti similar also different. Conspiracy theories Jews spreading propaganda, complaints ""liberty"", discrimination, surveillance, long term side effects, extent protests surpasses see US, like 100k+ people protesting 6+ weekends row. France probably highest degree vaccine skepticism world. also love protest. sound reasoning actually... is, want make case turn away unvaxxed need hospitalization. support that? frustrating constantly explain nuance sped-up testing timeline ""new tech"" new all. 

This kind false equivalence though cuz particular mRNA vaccines ""new tech"", tested long term effects humans. previously studied mRNA tech ever tested humans (until mass rollout middle pandemic). ones tested animals similar virus bleak long term get data stress point vaccines safe, especially long run, maybe vaxx-hesitant stop hesitant finally get vaxxed. 

But see here's problem statement. think would've better get longterm data first, rushed mass rollouts middle pandemic? probably would help curve skepticism. see business perspective companies would want rush product out, especially get shielded liability. think good thing, especially past studies implications ADE longterm. I'm talking variants ultimately made China. I'm talking first rounds virus, saw images people dying street Wuhan read first hand accounts young, healthy Chinese people dying. imagine particularly viral strains covid ended early deaths. access data China I'd happy read it. Yeah, well people choice lose weight. want diet, go it! masks mitigations, can’t leave personal choice going last rest decade longer? quite terrifying people forgot social distancing im talking people invade space rather people wondering whybyou walking away someone gets close realize even you’re vaccinated give virus others right? Source long Covid unique affects everyone? think spreading fact going increase number people considering taking off-label ? entirely possible people fence would consider taking seeing misinfo, feel prevalent. understand want fight disinfo rather encourage use IVM, I, however, wonder viable strategy. Ultimately, believe poltical harm done continue, matter outcome clinical trials. Lmao nobody talking ethics I'm sure going make spirited defense ""if ignorant narcissist breaks bunch rules resulting *preventable fucking death*, actually cool good, nobody fault!""

Not single one likely spent day lab, version research always seems involve searching counterfactual evidence, posting social media. Slurms, MacKenzie ?  Yeah plus Pfizer’s tamiflu equivalent antiviral COVID going approved soon. counter going really make large difference pandemic. It’s never? Now? one highest peaks contagious variant we’ve seen? Hmmm see well worked What? Also mellow yellow drinking fountains. saying guess mayo clinic slightly older data see state 75% w/ 1+ doses. Still, hopeful. Yay.

A big thank volunteers, hospital staff, people convince relatives, health care providers (and anyone else forgot) made happen. It’s HUGE milestone. Half one percent, 1 200 kids active covid week school started?! Eep.

I glad hear weekly testing mandate reopening, glad seems helping slow spread. shots included pamphlet list possible side effects serious concern. else need? 100 percent. given enough time. That's key thing. protection limited time. show data I've seen. Yeah, fave thing pandemic people making Science heads. that's bullshit reasoning know it. right spread deadly virus. world year get collective s**t together eradicate virus, world whole failed. don’t understand steps immediately deciding “unallocate” person ICU bed. sounds likely give rise aggressive pushback family members home, anticipating countdown. Also, hospital place send patients leaving ICU?

I like sounds fair like good people. unvaccinated Covid patient could easily tie bed weeks poor chance survival. No. look numbers make conclusions , based seen, 20-30 age group vaccinated, risk likely lower that, though course always chance. never said people worried belong risk demographic reasons concerned. said think society whole really prepared virus , structurally medically, simple people inconsiderate selfish. awesome news. I'm hoping there's 5-11 vaccine soon. 5 year old nephew started kindergarten worry 75% adults = 100% grown-ups noticed little italicized *in vitro* abstract there, right? Fear evolutionary response service survival. 

If fear keeps kidney damage brain damage resulting appreciable IQ drop, thank ancestors (and privilege working home). seem less prevalent summer though, think general hospitalization lower summer. people, especially elderly, get sick winter due depreciated immune systems lack sun energy. think streetlights emit low doses solar energy tbh. good immunity system.   healthcare workers US somehow limit hours service? yes, hospitals lower ratio healthcare workers patients?

For example nurse clock leave second nurse 20 patients ICU?

There much healthcare workers job. leave different jobs drastically damage healthcare quality? Yes, people would locking even without government restrictions. sure hell wasn’t going restaurants last year now. Yeah, first glance pretty worrisome, I've heard average ages hospitalized trends higher vaccinated non-vaxxed population. area live skews little older (I'm 41, lot retirement villages/communities neck woods). 

I've seen even higher %'s vaccinated areas, still, 16 vaccinated people hospital rural Tennessee town virus vaccinated against, older not, tells we're definitely still thick it.  Would ensure they're backwards, embarrassing state existence.

Actively antagonizing public health makes bad luck humiliating. me. whole damn point let hospitals get overcrowded. point hospitals aplenty, it’s time go back work “Yes tailor cure you… 12 doses monthly, $50,000 dose. cash card?” - future, probably stick hair care... Exactly. reason rest us vaccinate.  tl:dr dum wish U.S. would better job tracking this. ‘Not sick enough stay hospital’ isn’t comforting me. unvaccinated folks dying help drive rates vaccination! Party till drop. anyone know people previously handled statistics comparing vaccinated unvaccinated populations?

I don’t think adjustment made. 

And that’s true, mean much higher hospitalization death rates unvaxxed likely much higher unvaxxed previously infected? Hopefully we'll get better understanding treating that, too. kids vaccinated **who’s parents care them**.

Unfortunately lot people fit part That's soooo 2020...am morbidly curious 2022 bring...I predict suppositories...butt what?... way go it. They’re sure applies everyone exact situation yet, they’ve able test people. Chances good though!  Well eventually everyone exposed. Also said 20k 1m 100k Well using masks vaccines slow spread makes point weaker. Yes 1918 masks idea global usage mandates outside US. 

There isn’t unabated spread, mean strains get around world faster, won’t create herd immunity fast enough mask mandates place. 

Plus vaccines creating herd immunity spread slowed even more. 

This nothing masks, necessary prevent overpacked hospital system. 

But imagine poorer uneducated countries struggle spread global interconnection.

It took 3 years Spanish Flu die out, getting close mark. I’d expect SARS-COV-2 impact us heavily at-least one year herd immunity really dampens infection. Mother-in-law could’ve told 11th grade bio education lol  also, proven people catch one varient? 


I know ever even suggested.

 We're sure delta took 'slots' someone'd covid sickness. may alpha able spread general masking practices, delta is.

I'm entirely certain suggesting here. Well coat never glossier, gallop improved poops wiggle anymore...oh yeah, apple flavor!! got j j would presumable counted fully vaccinated   might seem way think that's product everything hyperbolized media. nonsense anti-vax protests divisive click bait going pushed front center article saying ""trust vaccine ticks 2% month month"" inflammatory enough make know several people currently blaming vaccine XYZ health issues currently experiencing

But seeing people quietly skeptical decided last month ""okay guess probably get one."" seeing hardcore anti vax people changed mind they're embarrassed admit overreacted. bad news real time experiment long term health. debatable boosters even needed begin with, are, would high risk populations, elderly health conditions immunocompromised. I'd contact doctor least vaccination clinic assuming need it. Surprised took long, time. studies raised hopes among researchers, others skeptical, noting observational studies, gold-standard randomized, controlled available evidence shows association — causation — even results mixed, said [Walter professor nutrition epidemiology Harvard T.H.

You're right hard dates. 2022/next year slated point border changes made reason doubt that. trial starting year. think would surprising exact dates, hard predict pandemic look like months advance. Moderna Pfizer?  Doctor's authorization play sports thing? Schools pretty much went back days ago England. far control probably eye storm. US pretty free lockdowns since end May. Vaccinations make big difference, though see, 100% effective. Nonsense. fact, went back today. cool, anything value add insult attack spelling. English native language way.  lazy ""Oh fuck I'm going get fired get it"" crowd rising couches. holdouts job saying things like ""I'll get eventually"". Well work requiring order ditch mask seated desk, they're sudden asking get one. NYT article posted earlier today  problem (and real frustrating moral gray area) going come two identical patients differ vaccination status... going come vaccinated cancer survivor best, slightly overweight, slightly alcoholic anti-vaxxer thinks pandemic fake simply decided ""We're still sticking eight months,"" chief medical adviser White House told ABC ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz. ""However, we've said, even original statement came out, we're gonna go standard way (Food Drug Administration) looking data Advisory Committee Immunization Practices. although we're sticking eight, we're remaining flexible, data tells us differently, we'll make adjustments accordingly."" That's false statement. sure get information Delta less deadly. research back up? 

Delta become transmissible also caused double risk hospitalization.  Delta deadlier original variants, according UK Mods: see post history Bury you’re head sand. read science pessimistic rate vaccination effectiveness live similar area. live large county, one highest vaccination rates country. relatives listen to, believe in, much disinformation propaganda spread there, smart enough know getting vaccinated right thing do. Much problem stems people stopped thinking themselves. stories daily people families regret decisions comes getting vaccinated. Fear needles reason get vaccinated late August. think like delicious chocolate brownie vaccine idea lot better.  guess probably unpopular kids getting virus school almost inevitable, going impossible keep masks restrictions 100%.

You’re talking people fed diet factual sounding bullshit decades. accept climate change is, always been, real, would accept they’ve lied years people trusted. people lied climate change, else lied about? 

The simplest thing continue believe reality wrong. Otherwise, turns world view just, well, bullshit. bad. next year population's immunity increasing lot. drive probability breakthrough infection dramatically. I'm bitter knew required intense action governmental bodies involved (*especially* China) *very first* signs something novel spreading, wanted chance stop becoming international crisis. remember extremely concerned heard first cases Wuhan, subsequently lost hope ability curb virus lockdowns lagged behind case numbers way damn far. accepted going end.

Can imagine literally could weeks, could've localized single city? People far negligent/short-sighted late recurring theme century, seems. Many kids simply can't learn way either get easily distracted class disorganized. meeting Zoom vs. in-person meeting different.

I know many kids developed problems, anxiety, depression, isolation, etc. lack socialization around peers, much time home parents. drives lot kids (and parents) nuts. first thought read headline. took words right brain. I'm fairly certain immune system develops wide range antibodies range proteins virus. would really weird develop spike protein conditions natural infection. suspect one-dose stats good indicator vaccination. 

The stats gap one-dose two doses always seems large stats; either

* large percentage people getting vaccinated shots (every time see stats),
* lots people took one shot bother take second.

With relatively small time period shots (in US) much suspect lot people bother shot #2.    heard drs treating long COVID UK, think *may* genetic link get long COVID get MS That's true, good communication requires knowing audience. audience includes bunch extremely ignorant, stupid people, adjust accordingly instead assuming say stuff educated, intelligent person would handle fine. worries. meant said respect you.

Absolutely. see 2% vaccination rate African countries ... that's realize still going very, long time. folks someone present way exit positions gracefully. tell delta whole new virus, different last one, makes sense mask get vaxxed, might better outcomes wait admit wrong, last bit never happen. cant tell bad news hypochondriacs convinced COVID kill us rest us they're demand ridiculous restrictions forever scary number go up. headline reads like Quebec workers would still work get paid.  yea I'm pretty sure. telling people ivm basically bleach putting autoclave.

They like: yo fuck. nothing like bleach, I've lied to, sounds like could work, left trying hide me. yea think much likely tune morons like Alex Jones feed lies.


Basically good position, lying ALWAYS weaken it. get caught lie, everything say also sounds like one. arguments ivm self-medication good, need make shit saying easily verifiable people still unsure believe. really simple opinion.

Yes that’s evolution natural selection provided wikipedia source one wikipedia doctors. said don’t listen reddit experts care primary sources. one provided wikipedia source evolution natural selection. It’s simple. Provide source related virology. keep jumping place. 4 variants concern lot mutants get ground, couple getting ground now. Thanks sharing article. study based cites similar 2-4% long covid infected kids. think considered rare based circumstance, that's also dependent individual exposure current rate spread community.

I agree mitigations great balance risks. feel situation we're constantly assessing risks amid many individual factors, including incomplete dynamic information, personal risk tolerances, kids ages personalities, communities doing, schools doing, changing infection rates, capabilities finances, etc etc, exhausting, think conclusions come individual there's necessarily going right wrong (for responsible parents anyway). We're situation handful bad choices trying decide best bad choice us. Thanks additional sources. I'll add EDIT top level comment. court found Le Van Tri guilty ""transmitting dangerous infectious diseases"" eight people, one eventually died. 
In early July, Tri, 28, reportedly travelled motorcycle Ho Chi Minh City home province Ca Mau south country.  
At Ca Mau, Tri found lied health declaration form asked recent travel history, also failed comply isolation rules. 
Tri later tested positive Covid, found transmitted virus members family well staff welfare centre visited.

This infringing someone's freedom, kind makes whining anti-maskers look like toddlers throwing temper tantrum. Sshhhhh read headlines here. FYI - Best test 5 7 days possible exposure. earlier virus likely won’t show even it, false sense security. Later virus may longer nasal cavity growing elsewhere.

Originally Louisiana, living Tennessee. get 2 perspectives this. Tennessee feels half half. Businesses willing force vaccination bigger cities significant portion vaccinated individuals still masking.

As Louisiana...things look less great. see new conspiracy theories Louisiana acquaintances friends social media feed every day, last visit home, masking vaccination encouraging among know.

""I can't comprehend something unless happens MEEEEEE!!!!!!"" Yeah I’m talking groups ineligible, are. It’s enough time everyone eligible ample time get vaccinated wanted to. rate vaccinated people 5 months higher young people 5 months post-eligibility. unfortunate decisions made… Florida high old people, old people, regardless demographics, highly vaccinated.  get tested due sick coworker (likely food poisoning, test anyone symptoms since work thousands public).

About 2/3 people drive thru center parents testing kids. glad actually testing. Hopefully they’ll keep sick kids family members home. Every person stays home instead infecting another helps.

Most schools barely even enforce mask mandate, much less kind quarantine. number climb jobs require bright side Long term thinking, go!

Chiropractors often snakeoil salesmen move allows hospitals allot scarce resources like intensive care unit rooms patients likely survive 

Well, that's going lead really nasty conversations. poor medical staff hard enough time. 

I hope bring extra security in. imagine bozo pulling gun doctor doctor give ICU bed unvaccinated grandma, would prolonged comatose life three days anyway. unvaccinated adults took razor blade safety net. Here’s hoping premiums go roof. Thanks everyone Youre hero, thanks going way beyond duty. dont owe anyone anything, find job better mental health, youre right quit. america treats nurses respect PAY deserve! Well delta transmissible, natural immunity spread, along vaccinated. 

Should enter full endemic flair ups. do?  ppl gotten vaccine, followed stay home orders bend rules wherever could, think would reality. real chance dissappear blew it

The worst part this; would ppl get vaccine already definitely doesn’t sound like normal skunk behavior

It rabies. definitely normal skunk behaviour.

Rabies melts brain (literally) causes hyper aggression. There's thought - brain capable longer - rampant, thoughtless aggression. That’s one way look it. 2-10 years vaccine silly. isn’t 1880.  Yeah, seeing it, sorry. QR codes like 5G chips.

/s condition take vaccine?

I’m 17 male vaccination appointment days I’ve coughing month. I’ve seen doctor 3 times ate medicines. recover lot 3rd time cough came back again. I’m sure could lungs? visit hospital check vaccination ask conditions right vaccination? wonder many family members lying, saying didn’t get it. Yep could told that. line bunch issues impossible get entire world even country matter page. Lol yeah, MN probably good option that's case 😅 r/nursing felt bad skunk, also furious it

If helps, literally right mind. control actions. Already past half first dose, right? *Geez* forget effect people avoiding hospital surgeries getting postponed. means people sicker end getting treatment need. People lose fing minds hear this. want talk raw numbers, point cutting employment resulting poverty equal deaths prevented isolating.

In opinion matter move forward meant answered science morality issue. Might well argue gun control. Right. man made antibodies. unable understand measures contagion binary. work 100%. Yet useful.  seems like people disregard everything mask, others think nothing necessary beyond vaccination, others think useless 100% effective. know disease Rabies compelling case euthanasia.

I mean lots times euthanasia warranted, it'll always debatable.

Once rabies set brain though... there's debate. Put poor fucker ASAP, spare hell. get appendicitis Maybe like wife Europe app QR code, that? “To me, natural antibodies better man-made antibodies.” 


I mean antibodies man made. made them. Stopped listening guy read line. doesn’t listen talk. I've learned lot countrymen honor whatsoever. 

They gained honour bombing shit Islamic countries. movies PTSD erected sacrificd ... honour  anecdotal course, local drug store said 50 first time shots day, good portion people hiding shot family - parents spouses whatnot. shame feel like hide it, good news. Texas: State loves embryos, hates children. Possibly. However, lot places would lock super hard order prevent hospitals breaking. used think people really stupid. Like 95% people dumb maybe couple % smart. came realize issues dealing with. I'm back thinking right begin with. bad variants currently fucking us sideways  I've lived entire life man, become rich tech boys playground one priced day day. love = use political gain. Minnesota last month, authors found Moderna vaccine (also known mRNA-1273) 76% effective preventing infection, **but Pfizer vaccine (known BNT162b2) 42% effective**.

Bear mind protection severe illness death remains strong studies (including Israel's) contradiction Canada's data here. Shooting foot big deal Idaho though actually misleading. 

Covid polymerase low error rate, add, mutations would significantly alter spike protein point memory response prior infection/ vaccination would longer recognize. 

Flu recombines h &amp; n proteins within animal hosts (birds, swine) cells coinfected 2 flu virudes, vaccinate every year. Covid near scale. 

The chance give covid replicate, law large numbers apply, mutations occur. Get vaccine end nonsense late. It'll like playing Russian roulette decade. Mother barely icu completely wiped out. four kids. It’s fucked seems Floridian part, 

No, didn't. real life, childish video game press win button that's it. start spreading misinformation masks unnecessary. still are. C'mon man gonna put people can't part healthy, normal society?  Sister Kenny treatment. 1924 born parents couldn’t get us vaccinated polio fast enough. 

A close friend mom’s died iron lung polio giving birth healthy baby early 59s. try survive like everything else.

So get point pet peeve mine. Viruses don’t brain desire purpose. They’re like animals people. aren’t “trying” anything.

I think personification viruses people can’t understand impacts asymptomatic spread virus. real impact virus human behavior humans feel symptoms. symptoms virus mutations random rolling dice virus replicates spreads human behavior influence mutations able infect replicate. Instead humans selecting less severe mutations replicate, virus spits whatever mutations occur. virus isn’t selecting mutations. thought purpose (it’s like photocopier sometimes glitches animal reproduction) can’t chose reproduces. happening Italy last March, heard. least similar measures.  That's actually true. However Taiwan's case, expected 2nd infected country due many people go back forth Taiwan China. 

Taiwan understanding situation, acted appropriately suffered seldom amounts cases first year. lived pretty normal too, considering safety nets place. difference I'd suggest vaccine helpful student particular, quite helpful community (teacher, parents, students parents, etc). Well, fight malaria take hit like thought would. Shame two. Ah see, it’s always personal stories anecdotes sway people most. Best could recommend talk doctor research chances anaphylactic shock herself. think sometimes people need “discover” realization own.
  
As long follows reputable sources degree make aware safety least turned fellow trooper, supervisor actually took seriously. Way better usual ignore &amp; sweep rug response.  Oh bad, assumed also American. understanding situation US many states giving vaxxed citizens QR codes, but, not. centralized wish would be. talk quarantine? No. stop strawmaning me. Sweden burying head sand (which pretty much buried entire pandemic) thinking ""now things back like before"". shouldn't. Things change Europe want avoid future (because happen again, matter when) includes mindful certain things (masks sick place crowded, especially winter, working home feeling unwell etc). include though laws make sense scientifically politicians control populations (with pandemic excuse afterthought). older inactivated virus vaccines take months months months culture. 

mRNA vaccines influenza likely accurate.

Antigenic sin bigger concern frightening implications - diseases immunized one strain actually aids different strain, get infected, making way way way worse. believe biggest example Dengue fever. it, get infected one strain, might mild illness. later, get infected different strain, immune system goes apeshit.   

grateful got  Apparently Idahoians much social gave credit crazy comes convincing nutjobs get R value 1 hope underestimating people here. would mean humans‘ mental capacity really low. yellow card created show vaccination cholera, yellow fever, typhus, smallpox. Diseases considerably contagious deadly COVID.

But sure, could use updating, perhaps sort verification method. Nice, projections exactly I'd hope see real world study. Maybe use news sky blue Everyone know getting boosters I'm Ok sending mentally ill people home die. mean? still don’t know you’re proposing otherwise deal got mine Netherlands carry time Dutch phone application. recently relocated back Austria need visit old family doctor transfer Austrian certificate case get third shot. Dutch certificate alrrady accepted rrstaurant. ask this. couple friends unis supposed 100% vaccinated yet case numbers steadily rising. I'm going vacation weekend...  It’s hard. argued someone else can’t simply nothing, either. 

It’s hard. 

One hand: would pull lever lets people back office nationally maybe leads 10k deaths? willing COVID Thanos? I’m sure am. 

Other hand: choice? Eventually go back human. mean eventually picked pieces every virus disease. different. again, wanna pull lever?

Weighty stuff. single good answer. take mild mean bad enough require medical intervention. Well, tried respond thoughts that, bot thought uncivil. guess pretty much says it. can't stand watching kids suffer... sister (vaccinated) said: still living normal lives around here. Couer D’Alene biggest major city Idaho hit hard. hospital is. Kootenai Hospital can’t keep up. I’ve Couer D’ALENE several times last week two, far good. Washington side seems holding okay. vaccinated people side border. Thanks thinking well being. Maybe misunderstood. I’m criticizing NZ’s response all. think sometimes people forget get eventually suck degree. long vaccinations super high, shouldn’t terrible, also know problems antivax sentiments there. 

Throughout pandemic, wish I’d there, (UK). However, husband actually looking job (prob starting year everything), honestly don’t know want go living hell kind lesser degree there. waves start may much me. lot mitigation measures simply theater, even masking 100%. There's many kids teachers crammed together far long. either accept elementary kids going get Delta variant next months hopefully we're looking approval time winter rolls around, 1 vaccines fasttracked approval children, go back virtual learning vaccine approval. so? Maybe sources studies pointing direction Sweden good? far I've read opposite. Yup understand yellow card is. Yellow card wasn’t designed something contagious deadly. understand lax yellow card is. need something stricter thought processes place. knew. everyone called us conspiracy theorists mocked us calling flu.
now look y’all. new flu still living overpopulated nation/earth. congrats grasping concept evolution everyone! Give people $1,000 stimulus get vaccinated country vaccinated fair, Taiwan NZ relatively small island countries makes much easier control movement population. exactly looking for, check two videos site: shows modeled projections COVID19 spread schools without mask mandates. Also, technically, unvaccinated person dies, increase vaccination rate. terribly written, uninformative article full useless metrics. expecting new numbers efficacy infection. Instead got hand-waving statistics abuse. Im fine 1 Pfizer shot? need held accountable crysis remember first meeting covid saying, wait weeks see going... fail hard case can't believe it. That’s pretty much Tibet.  Last time checked, chiropractors aren’t experts virology. It’s super super rare. coworker went anaphylactic getting second dose. survived still hospital. 
So she’s freaked out. 
I keep telling COVID 1000000x worse. really thinks won’t get wears mask.

I’m frustrated bc got vaccine, whole family got we’re fine. truth people selfish takes one love dying. America fucking trash.  Exactly sad part fellow Americans doesn’t know like live country cant get helped. People spoiled think could whatever want. getting real bad. people realize serious late. gets bad government need declare marshal law would also love know this. district taking excellent measures- masks inside out, tests available in-school week students, parents volunteering keep kids distanced unmasked lunchtime. would love see measures work prevent spread.  attitude Psychological Reactance fascinating. It’s term worth googling reading articles it. think r/nottheonion mean always bad? Breakthrough cases matter number vaccines? wear masks around people?

(Am fully vaccinated. isn’t speaking vaccines. It’s hoping things would normal now.) Texas trying dismantle society one law time.

They strange view meaning governing. I'm Austin drinks kangaroo friends last week. complaining lockdown like Australia...while bar me... I'm Austin drinks kangaroo friends last week. complaining lockdown like Australia...while bar me... used be, Abbot attracting antivax crazies like mad. feel safe here. vaccine card (“yellow card”) what’s traditionally used document vaccination travel purposes. It’s pretty unsophisticated (no QR code etc.), probably design sorts international standards lowest common denominator … locales may sufficient internet, smart phone proliferation allow robust method. paper document doctor’s signature accepted.

I would like foolproof/fakeproof system, always holes people scam. vast majority people comply though. 

Here card: Back almost 1m doses per day

Would please link source? I'd like see exact thing looking at. Thank you!  let good sigh relief. started laughing joy. good news. 'Cuz past months, bad news bad news. uplifting me. Can't wait end. thought majority Americans would anti vax. I'm surprised.  either treated uncontrolled hiv, active cancer, lying get label use vaccine. I’d wait it’s proven necessary effective, legally medically approved kids pediatrician full shit. essentially active influenza cases Texas last 6 months. We’re inundated RSV though number critical Covid cases small children gone absolutely bananas last 2 weeks. literally peds inpatients beds left entire state. see sustainable. Wouldn’t without Covid certainly isn’t now. bartender well known frequented bar city died covid. 38 yo vaccinated. next day 60% increase daily vaccination city. week ago. 400% vaccinations day previous death.  Tic tacs!  like access knowledge us normies don't.

Just 3 million mouth breathers. I'm seeing many vaccinated friends get I'm sure believe this. experience side effects? side effect sore arm. Unfortunately agree. people close work (or workED) ICU they… same. don’t know ever *will* same. barely people anymore. sounds awful say, it’s real- less person shaking, sobbing shell looks like human. Totally completely broken inside out. really feels like already dead. 

One gone leave meant work next month. don’t talk it, mere mention panicking floor crying. It’s scary watch. 

Lack sleep huge part. don’t sleep, don’t sleep *well* get rest. don’t time eat properly. emotional break. 

I going go medical… wanted help people. don’t think I’m equipped whatever see 12 hour, 16 hour, etc shifts. Last year talked every day, don’t talk it. It’s like unspoken rule aren’t work, *don’t bring up*. 

I asked closest friend (who nurse, doctor): “please quit. can’t help anyone like I’m seriously scared you. Go back school something, anything.” 

They said: “I know, supposed do? still rent. People still going die. We’re already understaffed- someone stay them. can’t let die alone like that.” 

…shit’s fucked. It’s totally completely fucked. 

I know could go “front lines” help people theory but… really can’t. can’t. don’t care money put education. doesn’t matter anymore. Maybe timeline I’m helping people seeing it’s around just.

I keep watching nutty people local school board meeting claim there's evidence support masks schools control spread.

What’s obsession rushing kids crippling student debt depressed wages anyway I've already seen free NYT articles month. need go medical school fully understand implications getting getting shot. Literally, impossible truly give informed consent *anything* without physician. generally accepted statement last paragraph constitutes informed consent. delaying months months getting vaccinated, contributed statistical body generated new variants large number cases (and deaths) we've seen recent months.

Acknowledging can't grasp statistics huge step, end, faith expertise people understand things don't. virus parasite. Yes, shares *some* functions parasite there’s reason it’s called virus parasite.

Source: every medical journal existence Yeah article touches that. I’m wondering view can’t. sure. It’s back normal packed stadiums music festivals. limited mask compliance throughout pandemic half country activity opposing it. We’re middle delta surge hoping we’re peak. 100k+ range new cases last 1-2 weeks. Last week 1200+ daily deaths range. covid hot spots, hospitals crisis mode struggling keep up. Kids back school starting get sick. It’s TBD whether they’re getting severely sick. seem getting hospitalized haven’t seen data indicating large number children dying. normal put blinders on. completed 5 days peeing Freedom deathly ill.

Why people protesting seat belt laws? seat belts PIN keep FREELY ejecting car wreck. Go get freedom.

Oh, child, family conservative vaccinated. Even work, 1 fucking pill month shit. 🤦🏻‍♂️. friend seem understand science works one bit. right. time months ago. can't read it. paywalled.

But obviously correct chance ""1 5,000"" rather, ""it depends. depends things like local community spread personal exposure have. Even things like age, etc. Labor day would like word information kept them, case? (appropriately dosed) ivermectin (relatively) harmless

Or...it may cause reproductive recent report showed 85% male patients treated particular centre ivermectin recent past went laboratory routine tests discovered developed various forms, grades degrees sperm dysfunctions including, low sperm counts, poor sperm morphologies (two heads, Tiny heads Double tails absence tail’s, Albino sperm calls), azoospermia poor sperm motility \[6\].

Depends sport though. never get one swim team martial arts. Big core school sports like Football Baseball I'm sure mandated.  Much less you.

PS: Natural selection go min-maxxing. benefits *more reproduction*. virus host dies, virus goes ( that's they're called obligatory parasites ). host = virus = reproduction = mutated gene create variants. Hospitals / Insurance needs jack rates offer discount vaccinated. choose stupid, stupid tax. think people lied said first dose mostly immunocompromised third dose wasn’t approved back early august. Like husband, transplant wanted booster kids school starts. don’t think people lying saying it’s first. They’re probably lying saying immunocompromised now.

I know probably doesn’t make sense you, ask try patient trying speak someone like afraid .1%. see. damn suck seeing people fun locked home :/ even something basic dining restaurants. also putting risk. booster doses match first shot doses. getting less active ingredient booster. lie, get big bad first shot. anyone EILI5 RNA biologists knew sequence create know accurate?   telling people year half I’m even scientist. (Wasn’t spreading misinformation, obviously said think it’s gonna like flu” lol.) Helen Clark saying rich countries (which includes New Zealand) donate poor countries, people donate New Zealand. anyone publicly admit anything unless forced? US federal government effective top leadership.

The first year pandemic wherein federal leadership (president appointed officials) continually lied everything, blundered repeatedly tried cover up, blocked marginalized career experts jobs, actively getting states’ way without providing coordination support really set tone. US federal government legal authority helpful disaster like pandemic, provided leaders ball. 1 5,000 comes [this NYT posted early morning.  know southern US (intentionally) done everything wrong response Pandemic. But, expert consensus seem region peaked declining. watch IHMS covidestim two credible sources. 100k right cheap nurse Seems like insecure conservatives trying hardest prove they’re stereotypical Californians. put another way, cutting nose spite face. mean 70+% adults US least 1 shot so...not really. concentrate stupid small, loud, really obnoxious areas.  statistical phenomenon called ""simpson paradox"". 

This post clearly explains want perspectives/explanations literally google ""simpson paradox israel"" get bunch discussion it.

&amp;#x200B;

There also second piece counter ""makes things worse"" argument, that's fact PCR testing can't distinguish ""dead"" virus someone's nasal passage thriving spreading virus. vaccinated people get tested show similar viral loads unvaccinated people, likely virus obliterated immune system. unvaccinated person high viral load plenty symptoms, vaccinated person high viral load symptoms light symptoms.

Hope helps. Vaccination way. Also, lot children adverse effects, that's bad too, independent anti-vaxxers.

Why FDA actor shit here? Perhaps Pfizer larger trials children begin with, especially trials designed myocarditis discovered potential side effect adult doses. seems like Moderna always behind Pfizer regulatory process. Things improving. Vaccination rates going up. bit bummed still people trust vaccine ever reason. * World scientists denounce WHO's Tweet open letter: [""Clinical Infectious Diseases: Time Address Airborne Transmission Coronavirus Disease 2019 evidence airborne transmission: [""Lancet: Ten scientific reasons support airborne transmission SARS-CoV-2""

They'll multiple plans based various models covid they'll choose right one time correct. things mutate deadly becomes deadly kills host well happen virus goes extinct oh wait fucking host!!!!!! talking establishing religious institution forming subdivision New Orleans? Go USA!! agree well however happens runs nasty long term effects large percentage people it, asked list everything treated with, what's meds. seems boosters think people poor countries get first dose prior boosters people rich countries, boosters matter. saw recent stat estimated 1 every 5000 vaccinated individuals experience breakthrough case

What mean? rest entire lives? eventual boosters not? account possible vaccine-evading variants? compare unvaccinated people? stat meaningless without information. mean hell, lysol indeed kill virus petri dish. Also helps kids already required vaccinated 5 diseases. Enfin ! give analogy that's relevant, think 9/11, change brought about, live changes now.

People scared. People overreacted. political economic turmoil several years after.

Now expect long lines extensive searches airports. plan around think much anymore.

In 20 years, people think twice wearing mask getting annual booster shot.  one thing constantly keeps getting forgotten downstream damage happening hospitals icu's get overrun people stop heart attacks strokes infections like bloodstream infections people need critical care lots things well. mortality rates diseases gone thanks covid overflow. deaths attributed mishandling covid people they're supposed masks vaccination. Anti-vax anti-mask people killing people statistically. Fractional manslaughter. Indirectly causing people die would simple things society asks needs do. major hospital system already authorized every single employee (over 80,000) schedule get booster shot, waiting CDC/FDA guidance.

Anyone general public schedule visit local pharmacy, attest immunocompromised condition without questioning, receive shot.

There enough data Israel study support safety efficacy booster shot, many vaccines would likely tossed anyway. here! 1991, remember glory days Cartoon Network ton looney tunes! sudden disappeared! got crappy cartoons here’s thing.

I don’t need go medical school get help need get shot. needed physician patience listen specific concerns talk me. argument human rights bull, trading one right another. right die covid-19 vs right wear mask take vaccine.

China maintained zero-covid strategy, everybody criticizes China's approach violating human rights. years

More like 6 weeks quarantine lifetime masks precautions... ended lifetime masks precautions *anyway*, grasp people first place unless stop assuming good faith motives... suddenly makes sense. You’d surprised. not, point. 

I acquaintance fully believes this. She’s ICU nurse, too. lot families district pissed school board voted make masks optional (the governor since mandated schools state). I'm pretty sure psychos know live throw tantrums guns shit. Isn’t entire Spanish flu statement conjecture?  county 37%, 33% month ago.

I'm wondering happens winter though...  Dun kirg effect would think high.

My husband camp. still got vaccinated first day eligible (hes high risk), poor guy stressed. seizures nerves. tried finding could lay advance, took calling several places week find out...maybe. got found yes, yes could semi private came adorable juice box!

I definitely imagine someone isnt high risk afraid needles, knowing lay anything, could make someone hesitate.

I imagine someone wasnt  Isn’t expected? Increased infectivity mutation, decreased virulence. Like Spanish flu mutating something benign, covid-19. Viruses resulting host death almost always evolve become less serious. host death bad continued spread present energy source.

Even vaccinations strains trend towards less deadly. However, evolution still random, trends trends. I'm willing bet it'll annually like flu shot.   post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

Aside measuring one dose, distribution causes remaining 25% adults yet start vaccinating makes last quarter *very* uphill walk.   Yup it’s back normal part. places requiring masks (transportation mainly), places need proof vaccination, schools spreading kids out/masking, lot work home still.

Killing life force ( acquiring maintaining deadly traits ) quite opposite ""spreading"". *do know* nature mind anything, sorry wrote like that. Besides, saying virus cant get selected contagious capability based ""fulfillment"" said ""box""... doesnt make sense. course, biological physical ""barrier"" wish spreadness peak could say that, COVID-19 point? generally considered safe.. 80% adults 1 dose. We’re closer 55-60% total population fully vaxed western / north eastern states, 40-45% lot southern / mid western states. 

I really hope you’re right isn’t shit show.  think need take look places again. strategy successful. Sweden better choice.  It’s freight train coming wayyyyyyy hey! Yeah similar problem knowing much, reassured looking trial data lol. right, completely unknown.

And look mRNA constructs good rules thumb (like longer polyA tail longer transcript lives), specifics part truly interact still tested vitro make sure exception rule.

A panel would cool! I'm field per se periphery one would love ask real RNA biologists. don’t care unless it’s child. sometimes even then.  Today 31st Birthday, hell lot better 30th Birthday, since could mingle people, thanks Pfizer COVID-19 Vaccine. 

Thank you, science!  little. kills small percentage people even takes while, lot time spread that. 

Meanwhile, opposite selective pressure - thing makes infectious also makes deadly (i.e. higher viral loads). okay run outside without mask on? Since I’m outside there’s limited ventilation. fine right? live small town many people walk street run. Great job! Province likely hit 80% double vaxxed week; it’s crawl last month! I'll receiving 2nd dose next week Friday. 🤗 seem prefer womb abortions Texas It’s head bro. Chill take break.  NO. SHIT.
Is fund for?! said got funding way scientifically qualified. Geesh friend ICU COVID wife kid negative far. wife takes hydroxycloroquine auto-immune condition has. negative symptoms Covid one genome piece, flu 8. may mutate, strain flu added ability recombine 8 segmented genome segments strains result lot greater potential change.

Covid flexible flu. one. blatant misinformation, that's ok long makes covid seem worse.  Thanks, hate Turn Java browser try again. really cant judge kind decisions outcome. made best risk assessment could available information. 

Its like going all-in winning hand poker.... opponent draws 1 10 card win, doesnt mean wrong, unlucky.

Even now, odds remain strongly favor. young healthy extremely low risks serious illness. realize little comfort worried angry parent, please dont beat best possibly could. [Moderna's shows exact opposite. beta-spike booster gave 2-fold improvement neutralization versus beta wildtype booster. multivalent booster nearly well, best Gamma.

Of course, care Beta Gamma anymore. claim repeating test multivalent delta booster vs delta, data published yet.

We phase 3 studies, phase 1 data shows multivalent better. deadliness, specifically, whatever mutation resulted higher deadliness, strictly improving virus' reproduction, could expect diminish time

A higher viral load increase transmission lethality. appears that's case Delta compared previous strains, fact. federal government shut country first time? went ahead scheduled young adult sons told time there. may lazy, great following simple instructions. cancel everything move like 2018? Hospitalizations running steady last two weeks, declining significantly: interesting see happens labor day holiday school year progresses. surprised factors push trend up. happens, things get worse. point article available capacity advanced care use. People dying directly covid lack resources caused covid hospitalizations.    Despite half country fully vaxxed still seeing second largest surge far. period least amount damage. hell tell numbers hit worst period virus? way profiteers healthcare industry, far left leg went numb month. still right. Uh. always been. Vaccines take well case existing endemic coronaviruses flu absolutely wreck people.

This new situation virus. sick week, beginning august 25. Three days pretty bad. Mainly shortness breath, weird chest pressure, bad sore throat. Lost sense smell almost week. Ten days since lost haven’t gotten completely back it’s 90%. It’s 13 days since first feeling symptoms I’m still pretty tired overall recovered. I’m 40, BMI 20 go gym 3-4 times week. 

The person got infected 23 division one athlete vaccinated time me. got sick day sick longer go hospital. She’s still tired leave apartment otherwise symptom free now.  rogan told 😅 People local sub keep thinking new mask mandates eradicate virus still enough unvaccinated cause healthcare collapses.

It's really disheartening see people expected outcomes still expected one well year now.

I think cope bad information they've gotten (and reddit help). also it, started one college cared got infected class members. kinda sick lasted one week okay. Thank fking stars got Good immune system.

So har covid vacinated mean double protected lol? Glad ok. fucked choice make. asked dude talking Denmark whole time. Anyways Sweden nightlife even slightly close before, probably go much notice going empty places before. There's nothing packed right now. Seats inside way less before, can't move around time, must sit. know possibly think anything packed. Could anyone shed light following: someone infected Covid (for example delta variant) recover fully time period unable extremely unlikely catch variant again? so, time period could still carrier disease? Blaming Chinese government practically useless (authoritarian governments behave predictable ways; might well get mad Pope promoting Catholicism) also pretty weak excuse complete lack preparation / slow response many governments around world.

The Chinese government *saying* nonsense officially, publishing implausibly low case numbers. arguable whether due lack testing, early incompetence regional government, active cover-up, it’s kind irrelevant (at beginning pandemic thought misleading numbers nefarious seeing incompetence, poor coordination, lack resources led gross underestimation case numbers around world, can’t really say Chinese unusually poorly world standards, even standards set parts USA).

But actions widely available information coming unofficially China, abundantly clear end January (a) Covid incredible threat (b) Chinese national government taking Covid incredibly seriously. shut much national economy, shifted huge number medical personnel across country address situation single province, built temporary hospitals insane speed, tried source N95 masks anywhere world spare one could found dramatically retooled local factories make masks various things, invoked national emergency powers (of scope unprecedented history public health) shut internal external transportation, force social distancing, quarantine sick, etc.

There pictures enormous rooms full extremely sick people, videos people dying street, teams workers hazmat suits disinfecting streets, videos people getting barricaded apartments, etc. etc.

Not long start pandemic, Chinese shared virus’s genetic sequence, within months published (very effective) protocols used best hospitals wealthy Chinese cities. Etc.  Sweden. think mentioned Denmark anywhere. read passing 20 30 percent north American (white tail?) Deer population antibodies.   Covid. stay now. Sorry archive site keeps giving “server error” report. live western Australia, think peaked around 20 cases? basically covid free since began    Yea, real, fuck guy negativity. prick isnt solution. Encouragement happy getting done one way another is. apocryphal boiling frog. There's research it, people surprisingly quick adapt ""new normal"" even changes.  think mean vaccines. US drug companies super inflated prices medications. money obviously going somewhere  stats mention ""adults"" only? available teens. want make percentage look bigger? comment back everyone busy blaming China.

They literally locked equivalent entire state, point people allowed outside nearly purpose. Americans audacity say done done faster, year half pandemic, can't even convince politicians population keep masks grocery store accept safe effective vaccine.

Tell know country governers legislating schools *can't require masks* mid-pandemic would responded faster firmly outbreak novel virus?

It's absolute nonsense. time window halt virus, everyone failed, Americans failed much harder average, they're position criticize. Ooooh, tell more, please!?   fellow Americans doesn’t know like live country cant get helped.

They do. live America.

Or consider extreme medical debt treatment “help” problem US Google data says 53.6% completed vaccination. comparison Canada vaccinated 74% population one dose least 68% completed cycle 2 doses. Almost happens France. Spain 74% population recieved 2 doses... 

I mean great 75% one doses gap huge respect countries probably US respecting 4-5 weeks span doses maybe vaccine relatively smaller impact (?) kids talked class got whole class trouble comrades fighting pandemic. can't stand hoes 😩 Exactly. US already pays equal healthcare western nations, even put even money healthcare there's telling going inefficient parasitic middlemen anyway.  didn’t feel first shot barely felt second. doesn’t help matters articles vaccine show someone getting exaggeratedly wincing.   imagine literally could weeks, could've remained localized single city?

People say this, type scenario never possibility first place regardless. time first public death covid recorded Wuhan Jan, virus already Europe several months.

Literally way scenario could possible would China closed **everything** already October 2019, months first signs infection Wuhan.   Pregnant woman one largest unvaccinated demographics Ireland, high uptake country, disproportionately represented hospitalisations.   Gov Abbott : eliminate rapists

Maybe Covid quarantined kid many viral infections I’m technically retired, foreign places. flew NAVY, retired. feel like really Republican vs. Democrat thing, Chaffee gotten involved first place, least publicly put name part order stop Foley. would argue particularly UNLUCKY virus deadly - made people take seriously prolong pandemic. 

Had faced black-plague-level death rates, people would stayed fuck home party.    live get printed vaccine certificate stamp approval get second shot. either use that, use qr code link one 3 government app electronic vaccine card, 3 apps link government health care records, way fake Would many vaccinated recovered? thinking would mean would even closer full coverage.  yet phafma companies refuse let countries manufacture vaccine. Well thanks Swede want go back Sweden least able haha 😅 point still wrong, scenario nothing wuhan beginning pandemic. asked proof vaccination entered Spain like 3 weeks ago. That's basically happened Ebola. Swedes permanent resident, no. carry virus same. vaccination rates slowed significantly things open again. US could done *a lot* better. someone chronic fatigue syndrome 20 years, afraid long COVID everyone, especially young adults kids. don’t know yet percentage survive COVID go become disabled. get frustrated see parent groups wanting kids go maskless school. don’t kids probably wouldn’t even want child school unvaccinated delta variant.  No, all, ban entries countries high infection rate, variants concern, there's need covid test eventually vaccine certificate travel. Completely different story. Learn think.   Louisiana smh Thank much. makes perfect sense. read many news articles makes head spin. appreciate taking time explain that. They're feeling better finally quarantine. Thanks again! dad booster almost month ago immunocompromised 8 month mark. really expected roll boosters lot people now. Based personal experience/observations people know, pretty clear vaccine's effectiveness decreases time vaccinated beginning year lot breakthrough infections vaxed later. Well regular nurses deserve too. making 50-60k. hospitals paying travel nurses instead giving nurses raises. It’s dumb fuck.  Lucky sense everything place vaccines created quickly. mRNA research at, 10-15 years development, there's way would implemented fast was.

The initial projections 2-10 years develop vaccine, even could. Lives always risk. question accept risk. Every time sit behind wheel car life risk. upgrade safest new Lexus SUV every year? Risk never 0. go outside sun risk cancer. 

I live one vaccinated counties US. behave someone TN? Risk personal regional. 

We better thought process “don’t see anyone ever matter live.” Now, administering Ivermectin prisoners telling cures COVID-19, hand... Yeah would vaccination rate including unvaccinated people died? would rather say: hope them. reject vaccine, really alternative, desperately look something else justify needing vaccine. able escape previous immunity mean outcompete variants.

I may pay $15 burger crazy taxes... dang really imagine living governor believes trying make COVID situation worst best political career. watched Utopia Yes, said, “making announcements across Africa”

110 million doses population 2 billion(well 500 million Africa 2 billion still waiting first dose) definitely exercise soft power, especially given segments US public exacerbated pandemic.

I’m saying it’s unwelcomed, it’s Marshall Plan it’s nowhere near commitment US HIV GWB Obama. (Mostly Bush) 

 I’d like see US step commitment matches opinion itself. last 4 years, US lot ground make up.

US quite time, peaked several months ago. strain detected somewhere, mean outcompete another strain. Ever since Delta started progressing US, 'mu' decreased basically oblivion.

As another person much smarter quoted another noticeabl United States since least early April, peaked 1.5% new reads July, crashed thereafter (according data outbreak.info). Mu going outcompete Delta, would already done it.

No one knows, can’t good. Vaccinated people starting take greater risks. unvaccinated never stopped taking risks begin with. I’m sure mean? It’s news Boosters slated month..   think, local officials hospitals ask directly Federal help, like happened Alabama.

It really depends whether think need accept changes fleeting increase risk. enough vaccinated fleeting. 

At point accepting restrictions tiny increase collective safety stupid resisted. TSA hasn’t made us safer. would forever COVID policy. 

We shouldn’t radically change society all. wouldn’t adaptation, would reaction. already losing brain cells hearing countries trying year ago, people STILL it? amount mutation we've seen final nail coffin ""strategy."" never gotten cold lost sense taste? 🙄 didn't. never chance. definitely made worse though vaccinated, advocating rights oncoming trains brakes think get hit.

The point analogy compare COVID restrictions TSA fingers ass make sad future. Simply there's going back. That's nature change. contention claiming there’s new data suggest 90%+ efficacy infection yet didn’t link elaborate said data despite fact contradicts numerous well-structured studies? credible. recall vividly basically 30 minutes every week elementary ""teaching test"" mock standardization questions format State standardized end year test (including talking eyes forward etc). teach us anything practical. like 30 minutes SAT prep State elementary exams.

It’s going get worse always assumed testing would catch 1 4 infections, guys make sound like 1 5 (just 20 million cases end 2020 really 100 million infections). they're right, extrapolate assuming similar patterns, 200 million infections (!!). could also get estimate infection fatality rate. Covid already killed many Americans year last year. IFR stayed similar,* even gone slightly thanks vaccines, basically double infection estimate reason 200 million Covid infections occurred far. still think closer half population rather (upward 160 million) infected far, way know sure -- assuming repeat infections people, total infections people infected.

* Similar assuming Alpha Delta, caused two big waves U.S. 2021, actually deadlier original; they're infectious (and seem deadlier infections means deaths). No, blame immigrants abortions. Like always reason rural people are, per capita, getting vaxxed far less.

We know reason, sub rules talk it. Vaccines would suppressed original strain. would challenge find present math supporting 1/5000 per day.

It came presumably. Yes, degree seasonality COVID19 future, likely keep pattern we've seen US. Waves likely happen summer South, waves likely winter North. coronavirus spread via aerosols easily spread dry indoor environments. South, people spend time indoors summer AC on. North, winter everyone inside, dry anyway. Lol Mississippi understand hesitancy fear answer that, based quick google searches, would say number people died getting COVID vaccine 1 1 million people Astra Zeneca (the one bad press dangerous, Pfizer zero deaths country), versus number people die contracting COVID 1 every 50 people contract COVID (roughly, based known cases).

Admittedly I'm taking account age risk factors broadest sense, COVID 20,000 times deadlier even vaccine bad press. hope assists internalising statistics making sense them.

There's age category could fall risk one unlucky people dies COVID higher risk one unlucky people dies vaccine. Well, people probably starts fear needles looking excuses avoid getting shot, lead rabbithole misinformation. No, they’re parasites. Look parasite is. probably right! forget [other big   Good. That's thing table anymore (not federal government power begin with). guess focused vaccine mandates (which I'm for). think it’s anti-establishment anti-intellectualism. longer history justification. Honestly, 240k+ year breakneck work tons overtime literally risking life ungrateful unvaccinated morons (on top ones actually deserve help) nearly enough. nurses earning every damn penny. wonder variants would turned without vaccines. Would Delta variant all? Safer variants? dangerous? 

I heard sentiment Delta born situation small concentrations low vax rates surrounded large concentrations high vax rates. wonder that’s true variant competition would fared weren’t lucky vaccines. like NC. Weather nice- hot summer it’s unbearable manageable winters. everything beautiful beaches mountains western side state. Good schools state well, that’s important you. Thank you. kinda sick politicized got sides. thing matter work not. sounds like theres chance nothing conclusive yet.

Also go without saying, there's huge difference prescribed it, trying treat horse paste... Send unvaccinated home. Problem solved. He's technically wrong. check 7 day average, SD peaked week ago going down. course, last year similar peak-then-dip early-mid September. shot up, real peak made early September one look like tiny blip. telling what's going happen next, moment heading down. statement stands, need people get vaccinated ASAP. get variant requires new vaccine, we'll need people take vaccine ASAP too.

The solution get vaccinated, regardless covid doing.   Called way back first flattening US vaccination rate. Take bow humanity. I’ve never heard site links to. Zenodo.org?

Has anyone else used site cite It’s insane think still happening country it’s ridiculously easy get vaccines even choose one want. Oh no.  hope mutates becomes mild. Cause one chimeric virus cooked lab, triggers auto-immune diseases. know government delaying release information (for nefarious reason).

The government delaying release information boosters useful. government already stated boosters useful. addition, there's reports Israeli government utility boosters. fact, US government even currently allows people compromised immune systems get booster now. know boosters also coming pipeline general public. disagreement early booster people government think boosters available public. early boosters think able get now. government thinks available September 20th anywhere 6-8 months last time they've vaxxed. Coughing evolved Weezing   Really depends are. Places like US, UK…I’d say so. never shut country can't believe cries heard deaf ears     Cops 50 states same. Poor Florida must jealous.

My doctor examined putting pressure center chest, specifically costochondral joints located. hurt. pain feeling within areas chest. inflammation. said it’s serious go away prescribed anti-inflammatory meds. Yeah remember January 2020 parroting Chinese propaganda saying need concern human human transmission. Said need stop flights China.

The Chinese could stopped internally. could given us months head start. didn't.

Politics fucked things up. average person trust people now? long Meanwhile people Taiwan were/are flying overseas (many US) get vaccine shot. Something something...cultural differences? universities already fuckin yikes! I'm sure Marjorie Taylor Greene get right constituents dying all.   Learning shit hard way. Classic  upside, potential promotion go roof! I’d say around 20% population immunity idea commenter you’re responding severely lacking context. Yes, theoretically vaccine introduces selective pressure virus mutate escape it. full story, think original commenter quite irresponsible presented it, couple reasons. First, vaccine reduces viral loads ability virus replicate, means orders magnitude fewer opportunities mutations occur. Next, mutations would occur arguably important protein virus circumvent vaccine. biological systems, it’s way way easier likely introduce mutations break things introduce mutations make things better. fewer opportunities replicate case small mutations likely destroy virus help, likely would take heck long time circumvent vaccine. there’s more! Let’s say virus gets mutation beats antibodies. still guarantee variant enter cells efficiently infect people. two different interactions really hard balance. let’s say variant succeeds everything. another trick sleeve: groundbreaking RNA vaccine technology. make fresh vaccines variants quickly next tool fighting changing virus. may think constantly need updated vaccines, that’s handle flu vaccines! Yes it’s another thing do, works wonders! 

To add credibility, Ph.D. protein biochemistry, focused changing protein/protein interactions evolution. hope helps alleviate concerns. commenter responded one responded failed add ton nuance would inform actual biology here, felt context necessary.   Ironically, governance going cause brain drain intelligent people move literally State. long term Texas super fucked. country root well, it’s music ears.

For example, saw calculation right now, Washington state, pretty good, roughly 1 10,000 chance catching every day, would, average, mean get every 30 years.

So, unless vaccinate whole world, I'd assume adults would eventually get it. chain (walmart, cvs etc) they'll info file. guess Delta would die ""x"" amount people either got effectively vaccinated (good vaccine, booster required) certain amount time.

Not post Wikipedia.


If car primary sources comment sections debating anything. majority studies read also posted /r/covid19 want stick primary sources enjoy.  sure get tucked around comment section spewing comments   think would've better get longterm data first, rushed mass rollouts middle pandemic? 

Are moron? No, **don't** think better let millions die variants evolve people understand vaccine safe. 

No vaccine ever negative effects manifested multiple years later. link proposed mechanism even happen, link it.

Edit: nevermind, bother responding. Checked post history know never discuss good faith   Breakthroughs going hard gauge people less likely going getting tested symptoms they're experiencing justify going ER doctor's office. Especially mass testing sites much less thing general. want live restrictions forever? vaccines keeps people hospital that's need. Otherwise going restrictions masks *forever*. 10 years people still dying Covid didn’t get vaccinated. vaccinated individual important things worry choices people make.  You’re Convincer-In-Chief^TM now. Finally got first dose Sunday! Even anti-vax mother, works nursing home mandated threatening quit despite working last 15+ years, finally got first dose well! ... ""weak"" people dead mean. Can't quite proud that. Agreed. 

Unclear question trying answer next months actually get data next months...

In meantime, long covid thing. good way get get infected. Yes. read it. 


It’s doesn’t change know mutations replication. speaks mutations happen replication errors. want go talking ill informed am, continue so.  

I never suggested expect reading comprehension ability sufficient read digest studies. understanding based reading somewhere 200-300 studies related covid, vaccine development mitigation.  outlook changes information warrants it.  don’t care wrong don’t stick something don’t want wrong.  changes new information comes should. 

But everything appear repeat evolution covid based vaccination false far I’m aware.  Mutations become prevelsnt nothing viruses “need” adapt vaccination instead replication errors combine new mutations weaken effects current vaccination cause dominant strain.  checked county stats ... even 31% least one shot. Ugggggg.  actually think opposite, media would believe breakthrough infections common vaccines basically become useless preventing infection, misrepresented stats places like Israel claim huge reduction protection infection.

But recent studies places like Denmark placed protection infection 80-90% range, saw recent stat estimated 1 every 5000 vaccinated individuals experience breakthrough case (the vast majority mild. vaccinated, even 6+ months on, still highly highly HIGHLY protected). many epidemiologists currently opposed idea boosting everyone, see necessary. actually live Washington, go home I'm sane state. work Idaho. would move heartbeat financial position unfortunately I'm financial position help her. I'm 30 used way less careful health, I'm literally leaving America afford go doctor frequently possible. 

Those toilets analyze piss cancer markers can't come fast enough lol ANTI-Vaxxers:


ThERe FlU AnYmoRe! Look stats. Hundreds millions vaccinated. mRNA vaccines killed people. However, virus left path desolation wake. Anxiety one worst comorbidities, right overweight, puts even risk catch virus. likely die it, possibility that's far greater risk dying vaccine. could suffer long COVID though. That's something uncommon people age. Get vaccinated, really. also reduce risk infecting harming someone love. Mutations tend fan out. Selective pressures help promote certain strains others. Delta deadly covid basically unimpeded last year. year vaccine may see overall less deadly strain next year.     Virus real, think. government. Vampires. chances one virus randomly developing mutation resists vaccines high. problem long countries millions active cases, sooner later odds side virus.

The effective way stop new vaccine-resistant strains developing use available lockdown social distancing measures eliminate many active cases possible, breeding ground new strains.  ""No jab, job, jib, mainsails antivaxxers"" values billionaires deserve handouts need, poor people deserve starve.

Good know! Fascinating, thanks link. ""Adult"" important word. Kids reservoir like vaccinated.  study study proves previous infection providing better immunity fully vaccinated(without previously virus). ignoring natural immunity f suppose going based science? example, would young male (Although rare, young males shown likely heart related side effects vaccine) young low risk previously infected rush get vaccine? focusing vaccinating individuals previously infected. judging ones infected studies showing stronger immunity people fully vaccinated (and previously virus). sister. Still working dad.   symptoms since? Brain fog? Harder breathing? ED? don’t remember rushing weird ass sororities. Yeah, we're seeing reports nurses offered $100k temporary contracts point, think Delta wave end, I'm sure another one different strain (I know necessarily point many people keep thinking we'll reach herd immunity vaccines natural Obviously people who've recovered Delta strong immunity Delta.

For long? Given Delta requires high antibody titers prevent infection, convinced Delta run new hosts able reinfect hosts antibodies wane 10+ weeks. course, need data this. looking population seroprevalence insufficient Delta children require high antibody titers prevent infection, like common cold possible keep getting infected/re-infected. Hopefully T/B cell immunity helps keep cases less severe, great solution debilitating long covid yet getting infected first place (it's unclear 50% long covid reduction seeing vaccines due high antibody titers not). Nope, wrong. Republicans, like usual, damage.
Suck don’t think it’s implication. people panic act like animals. That’s Fauci two recent administrations said whatever generates least reaction. 

Everyone going touched every strain point lot people always going die, primary message you’d see cults conspiracies already have.  repeated time time vaccination prevent infections enough would curb emergence new variants. adding non-pharmacological (masks, social distancing) mass vaccination could that. literature full papers hinting this. virus going away least make emergence worse variants less likely.

Stop trolling. hate life people stay home quarantined rest life, option, act like rest world live miserable life forever.  people burned lungs bad enough can't work going long world. much likely get bacterial pneumonia problems. There's reasonable evidence infection gives least good immunity vaccination. really hard stats keepers tell previous infection exists, since positive tests good metric that’s true, mean much higher hospitalization death rates unvaxxed likely much higher unvaxxed previously infected?

It affect vaccine efficacy numbers well, potentially dropping dramatically taken account. percentage unvaccinated previous infection approaches 100%, expect vaccine efficacy go negative taken account (and infection gives protection vaccination). Iirc, get 5 stars hardest difficulty viruses fast spreading deadly since kill everyone year. higher Israel everywhere else Delta emits virus particles, spike protein mutated evade vaccines. 

It also timing issue, antibodies dropping right high viral load variant emerged.

Fuck covid. bottom introvert heart, thank you!!! created fantasy Yeah, guess coincidence first vaccine sites set wealthy areas low rates spread. Yes, lot people gathering holidays, they’re vaccinated, masking distancing outdoors, likelihood spread goes way way up. Go look IHME’s historical data. 

Two weeks July 4th, spike. 
Two weeks Labor Day, spike. 
Two weeks Christmas, spike. 

Also worth nothing, Labor Day kicks season lot 3 day weekend federal holidays push heavy hitter holidays. Labor Day 2020 spike never really dipped much. always holiday keep pushing us hire. 

Moreover, 3 day weekends holidays also coincide fall weather starting set in. weather gets colder, people begin gather inside, add fuel fire. Feels like me. can’t social distance job. wear mask, customers don’t. 🤷‍♀️ sold mandatory mask mandates inside playground kid’s Bay Area school saying “this best chance keeping schools open year” district already quarantined dozen classes 2.5 weeks in. 

Almost pushback parents. get it.  That's symptoms like people anyway though fair  25 year old brother. He’s the, “I probably asymptomatic, didn’t I’ll get eventually, get eventually won’t bad.” Masks mandatory everywhere bars closed. Restaurants hotels require vacination certificate. Next month restrictions lifted masks still required inside.
Although masks required, many turists young people (specially Night) use them. person describing character novel, real life billionaire. That's certainly Musk.   people care COVID despite evidence repeated warnings. really think care credit scores? ""Let's fuck around and"" ICUs full antivaxxers using resources medical staff needed cancer patients, car accident victims, etc? Well they're wrong. risks exponentially low always vaccines kinds since they've thing. people studying craft literal decades even literal decades research vaccines including Sars variant vaccines COVID vaccine came from. last sentence really shuts whole idea rushed vaccine. want them?

Edit: Two sentences last one added. Gotta catch 'em all!  Jersey City. town really well whole thing. First free testing, vaccine distribution, vaccine uptake. 
Even highly-vaccinated areas pretty much everyone masks stores common courtesy.  hear you, personally, struggle hold things like given aggressive contribution fighting climate crisis. me, saving planet priority, otherwise highly questionable billionaire working direction, they’re ally. opinion, feel free hate away. 10% US population like entire population Canada. lot people. Pablo Gonzalez, address local motel 6, burner phone, ID. think hitting important issue. Choosing get vaccinated people working 
own best interest. think messaging problem, think information problem. people getting information? What/who trust? deeper questions need answered solve large sums willingly unvaccinated. Blaming unvaccinated ad nauseum clearly unproductive probably works counter getting people vaccinated. symptom greater problem.
  
So people believing (objectively) true things vise versa? seeing sources information echoed back day day? think social media feed looks different yours? look different yours? simply subscribed different news sources, something deeply rooted/innate (social) media using echos back content engage more? would happen? mean like Asia mask? Yup. Hopefully like *forever* yes. People put mask symptoms, people respect 1m distance context (which fucking fantastic). That'd great. sounds like basic respect politeness restrictions, honestly. Probably not....they claimed allowed to. false. put another way. We're fucked. Even COVID mutate something nastier, bile hatred spews anti-vaxxers anti-maskers **will.**  timeline offered general public? 1-2 years? 5+ years?

Since people die cancer, emergency use authorization this? Can’t least see sort federal program makes testing convenient available school system? 

We can, ""states rights"" means states want implement school testing. governors legislatures forbidden mask mandates. states refuse Medicaid expansion. school boards voting free lunch programs. states ended expanded unemployment coverage. states publicly manipulating data. states push vaccination force hospital give ivermectin hospitalized covid patient. see states willing implement school testing program.

I feel you. agree response states governors horrible. Founders afraid much centralized power specifically explicitly limited ability feds interfere matters internal state. Why? Dumb Fuckery Stupidity, that's why. They'll flick blood nearest Democrat start pointing fingers   Really, this. sick people saying can't take vaccine (not medically educated) understand everything. Virtually every single credible medical scientist recommends vaccine. course small percentage morons medical field well like every field. I'm beyond worried someone care actually need hospital care, able get garbage. relatively routine things need get done coming up- FUNNY ENOUGH also point personal endangerment thanks TX malicious abortion ban- even know whether possible. disheartening. I'm trapped here, too.  Vermonters proud response Covid-19, embarrassment (if allegations prove true).  people get flu shot early flu season (its efficacy drops months)   agree hard. time, doubt whether personal-use automobiles going away anytime soon, think awful environmental impact construction second tier problem compared emissions-caused climate crisis. believe me, emperor humanity, virtually eliminating cars would literally first order business.  numbers still studied, around 19% get long covid. recently heard science podcast 10% get long covid that's debilitating able go back work. article provide details. title provide summary. mean, statistically also MUCH higher risk dying Covid, plan matched well Desantis’s approach vaccinating higher risk first, sure, we’ll go money thing. making ppl sick? making stupid comparison?  Ha! can’t remember. long time ago yes, 75% eligible can. want poo poo news, least vs groups get shots. Saying 61% total pop acting like 40% get it, children can, going jump considerably. Considering CDC tracking breakthrough infections, basis call claim false, fair can't definitively prove either. change one credible thinks vaccination eradicate covid, draw conclusions that. 

The rest said *can* proved absolutely true. I've thinking now. many people scared needles that's it?  /s People SARS-CoV-1 scarring lungs 15 years later There's message one hospitals mentioned original story refuting Sequoyah treated patients due complications related taking ivermectin. includes treating patients ivermectin patients visited emergency room received medical attention appropriate. hospital turn away patients seeking emergency care.

Another said seen ivermectin patients ""overrun"". control calls spiking.  many fully vaccinated ? Nitpicking statistics give false sense hope. Even make hesitant feel like really don’t need since “75% shot” feel information outdated.  


Australia may begin opening borders [early based vaccination rates.  


New Zealand plan well (linked others) 

both countries transitioning ""Live Covid"" model, also wanting hit vaccination goals that... frankly pragmatic want save lives.  


Australia feels like rushing, NZ, population comfortable taking time right needless death suffering here. Important note, articles back August well. can't find recent numbers, I'm sure higher now. Central Virginia here. situation. :-( One local elementary schools opened last Tuesday. Wednesday one case first grade. Today four.

Emergency school board meeting tonight! Anti vaxxers terrorizing doctors France death threats.  Bezos: Hold champagne  Err take hundreds years? I've heard lizardmen charge government good again. Hospitalizations impossible hide. can't mess like testing numbers death dates. either COVID not. Yes clearly we're nice enough assholes send *death threats* public health officials can't lot stuff, lot places ask certification vacine/negative test, dancefloors still closed night clubs, parties etc come back (in october) gonna asking certification course everyone wanna get shot, makes lives easier, without lot people even consider “In fact, antibodies even able deactivate virus engineered, purpose, highly resistant neutralization.”

Put. That. Shit. Back. exactly. mean... government transparent reasonable us. frankly, one transparent governments world... trust government large. 

Honestly, think true secret success pandemic - simply trust politicians most, respond by... \*gulp\* mostly honest us.  Antivaxxers really ghastly people, they?  theory experts done work concluded immunity helped booster. booster perfectly safe. know booster exact shot first two doses. know government delaying release information (for nefarious reason). big brain move lie say never got first dose get extra delta strain immunity compared suckers dying left right regular full vaccination. Good luck life. well. I've wanting check Kootenai National Wildlife Refuge, that's gonna wait while. (Maybe long while.) I've heard Texas obscuring data delaying reporting make situation look better is.  That’s booster shot. like whole “masks don’t help” Fauci saying start. Let mention I’ve always taken virus seriously disagree someone life-long tenure studying things like infectious, respiratory diseases decides tell everyone basic, common defense things useless. mask debacle good example. I'm sure really made right call lying bit masks doctors nurses could some.

In retrospect end equipment shortages long time. wonder percentage masks used donations early days Yes, that's right. better vaccinated possible opening up. plan year.

 
Frankly, see NZ listen countries failed keep people safe. death count entire pandemic 27 right now, hopefully rise much outbreak. economy hot, full employment (and labour shortages), without sacrifice lot people. trust NZ government handling pandemic whole hell lot better 95% leaders rest world. need nut stay Fortress New Zealand early 2022, it.  


We already plan, released week latest outbreak, well ahead plan vaccination. So... comfortable running race, rules. need US 666k deaths, UK 133k deaths lecturing us properly deal pandemic.  


And yes, open, yes, need deal covid. dispute. making sure people protected possible that? seems like obvious move.  


Opening like inviting Vampire house two hours Sunrise. Let's get many people vaccinated, use deliberate pragmatic approach opening up.   even close enough.

Because delta variant R naught value 5-8, vaccination rate need reach ensure virus dies 80% vulnerable population, includes 16.

Our vaccination rate population mid 50s, nowhere close enough stop spread delta.

It's gonna long winter.  brother sister-in-law's (she happens nurse) entire household caught Delta variant...5 people total. brother 43, SiL 44, son 17, daughter 24 boyfriend 25. relatively healthy. would say portion laziness get vaccine, majority reason trust it. really threw SiL, medical professional, told trust vaccine got it, bad.

It hit one right another hit like ton bricks. changed tune bout. (they) admit wrong think thing serious. entire household received second jab last week. wrong people? CDC estimated 1 million people gotten unauthorized booster shots back August. virus might reading this! give ideas!  Well, Geneva Convention establishes indeed say whatever want somebody long preface ""With due respect...""  think thats strictly true. mutation actively increase organism's fitness level pressure due things like genetic drift opportunity cost organism use resources towards advantageous mutations. 

So deadliness strictly improving virus' reproduction, could expect diminish time, especially specific expensive mutation resulted virus' deadliness. Obviously virus deadliness part associated spreadability virus' spread destroying host cells. reducing deadliness favor mutations increase spreadability could expected outcome. got pretty lucky vaccine man No, weren’t masked. mask outside school playing neighborhood kids yard. Obviously delta variant different we’ll change things Friendship ended. Horse paste best friend America, “they” refer “us”. Get involved community change want. really Q-anon cultists it. 

I research fucking school board candidates — don’t publish information — cult loonies think run school simply don’t want wear mask. Vaccinated patient likely survive, based data currently have. not, well, get vaccinated, die. shown vaccines reduce hospitalisations, advanced care death lot. body, choice. 🤦‍♀️ That's polite way saying they're soft head. Almost like brain worms need treated ivermectin. Nice Number going up. Good. 😊 came climate change.

We also tent hospital erected needed, either. May turned mass vaccination clinic. [One shot two-dose vaccine actually still it’s absolutely worth recognizing. totally blows apart notion around bad vaccine hesitancy really is. 

I wouldn’t count kids aren’t eligible. point replying way suggest vaccine hesitancy isn’t dire media seems suggest, implied claiming “only half country vaccinated”. Yeah. That’s true, intent portray accurate picture enthusiasm, it’s best take look actually allowed get it. Texas's hospitalization average literally declining week straight. human race go even long covid. Lives get shorter what's one life grand scheme of.... anything? Auckland still lockdown. Still injecting bleach, light. Like answered earlier: yes, scientists scientific journalism explain things awful lot lacked explanations.  moron? No, think better let millions die variants evolve people understand vaccine safe. 

Are you? demographic dying pre vaccine pandemic, demographic dying post vaccine (people obese and/or underlying vaccine ever negative effects manifested multiple years later. link proposed mechanism even happen, link it.

Lmao might want look FDA recalled vaccines. remember Gardasil commercials kid HPV... interesting US beginning assert soft power post-Trump world. Especially US begins booster shots Americans. 

647k doses country 44 million lot. represent 1% population getting vaccinated. But, fact US rolling announcements across Africa tells number important US, action is.  


I think rich nations going need front get past pandemic, good start. Lotta people die. one really give shit. Eventually combo vaccines better anti-virals take care it. Tbh, I've hearing US healthcare, kinda sound like fucking bargain. “My knees hurt. Damn vaccine”

“Jerry - don’t exercise 75 pounds overweight. Don’t think might answer knees hurt”

Inb4 - I’m fat-shaming, I’m overweight, trying point obviously erroneous conclusion messaging actually place 



Let give example recently watching Dr.Fauci CNN talking Jake Tapper Florida governors statements vaccines. 



Dr.Fauci talking always going 3 vaccine type deal rushed it. 


Is really going 3 dose vaccine entering time Covid going flu?  That's bad, mkay.  Jesus buddy, save vax rest us 

(well I've finished mine months still) Lambda mutation seems evading vaccines level. COVID-19 required zero sacrifice humanity. 
Stopping global climate change require immense sacrifice everyone earth, including companies governments. 
Even could convince individuals, government company willingly stop producing - nature. Better late never. People need stop calling people got dose late.


I see various subs someone said first getting 2nd shot soon, see lot downvotes Pro vax subs. need stop. evern that, less 40 study. others thrown already sperm issues without taking ivermectin. What's happening community anyone studied onchocerciasis immune response disrupts sperm production? know guy frequents grocery store work at, said got booster shot already. Didn’t clarify how, said got someone else mentioned thought elderly shrugged said didn’t want wait. idk, maybe he’s high risk. Maybe don’t check? leaves 25% completely spoiling everybody else (and killing others) 


The rest get second shot ASAP 
PLEASE great! definitely good step right direction. Ghana's population 30 million people, represents 2% country's total population vaccinated shipment.  


The rich countries world going need keep donating vaccine higher amounts want globe able move this. Lol, feee chocolate brownies - I’d like 25 boosters now!  ""Fact: Covid19 airborne""

And? 
 
Do know airborne means? still believe airborne.  
 
There three main divisions: droplet, aerosol airborne. Measles airborne. much smaller lump genetic material, float indefinitely air. flu likely droplet. Heavier chunks material fall quickly air. 
 
Covid19 still thought dominated droplet transmission. However, recent evidence suggests certain settings, also considered aerosol (while still predominantly droplet). _not_ make airborne classified virus. 
 
Stop trying act like know better entire body worldwide scientists. transmission blunted, cases high? Honest question. don’t know answer guess vaccines aren’t enough? would firebreak needed transmission low? question, don’t know answer. Oh yeah, recall vividly watching unfold. 
Unreal. 
I’ve 40C 90% summers Japan, know well danger misery kid hear brings. assume adults got vaccinated vaccinate children approved FDA. People embarrassed admit screwed find way justify bad decision. seems insane, people, admitting fucked avoided cost. Anybody insight joe Biden may talk Thursday?

Sadly 95% family unvaccinated. brother big supporter Alex Jones realist thinks earth round vaccines save lives. sad thing is, come point may choose freedom functioning healthcare system. Look states hard pressed find ICU bed right now. permanent state going forward would leave everyone terror dying treatable injury illness.

I want go back restrictions, god knows don't.

I want live fear available ambulances kid gets knocked car.

So answer? Long term, investment healthcare, naturally--though government disinclined necessary degree, also would trouble finding enough trained people staff it. short term? idea answers are. pretty awful, really. Yes. will.

If people handle total war years, decently paid healthcare staff figure out.  question is, accepting unvaccinated patients? Shouldn’t turn away? trying everything sink cabinet. Next fabuloso maybe easy off.  That’s part makes someone good communicating - make even stupid people understand degree. That’s art. 

Some scientists like Brian Greene good that’s rarity. religions really weird ideas medicine. Jehova's Witnesses example want give receive blood transfusions.  simply enjoy wearing masks 8 hours without harangued, brow beaten called burger flopper? reason lose people part reason still going. ""I'm sorry, saying meow?"" Christmas one least amount new cases Europe (particularly, thanks harsh lockdowns restrictions imposed time). 

Thanks government took risky decision trusting people giving freedom travel across country meet families Christmas. January proved horrible decision launched Portugal top charts, making worst country WORLD, regarding new covid cases. government imposed harsher lockdowns started vaccinations February.

Since then, new cases slowing dwindling vaccination numbers started rise (thanks excellent job covid vaccination task force, took care vaccine distribution management, general acceptance vaccine portuguese people) finally coming present situation almost everyone vaccinated. Where's source? posts link reference CDC, Guardian, NYT, etc. removed ""misinformation"". Anything even vaguely critical policy, especially Fauci, gets removed. Meanwhile everyone claims ""follow science"" jump every negative rumor like variant sick kid single rural hospital filling etc. must awful everyone's mental health constantly consume negative information every day. Yeah don’t necessarily think CDC great media creator Desantis actively promoted covid friendly policies. Norway centralized vaccine registration system (SYSVAK) around since 1970ies. go via Health Department webpage see every vaccine ever taken. Public healthcare, private, matter, report system. complete coveres every citizen here, getting vaccine data matter legality.  take little mutation take effect. always bad terms mortality rates. Absolutely doctors.... doctors who?.... Yes!.....but says.....the doctors! That's who! ....Yeah know Who, know friends names same. doctors said vaccinated asymptomatic unlikely carrying viral load, let alone enough infect someone else. heard Dr. Monica Ghandi say interview day. Thank sharing this. Yes will. It’s whole transmission circle ⭕️ that’s happening right eyes!  That’s great seeing little it. According TV6 news website COVID numbers went 5 entire weeks ago 530 past week, 4 deaths. death numbers remained low even case increases. Overall could worse huge flood tourists coming absolute disregard distancing, mask use, etc. style reporting people getting, pandemic would solved now.

90% ""news"" people get hyperpoliticized rage bait people know they're talking about.  Covid-19 allowed transmit worldwide massive scale, virus new humans, it’s low-hanging fruit pick become suited spreading among human hosts. 

But we’re able go pandemic state, endemic state transmission suppressed comparable flu? benefit Covid virus, SARS-CoV-2 (I’ll call SARS2), significantly lower mutation rate influenza. SARS2 feature uncommon RNA viruses, mechanism correct errors made copying genome. SARS2 sometimes undergo recombination events, it’s nearly frequent influenza. 

Also, current vaccines targeting virus existed year half ago, original Wuhan strain, it’s still effective typical flu vaccine.

I won’t make prediction, I’m leaning towards optimistic end. also fancy next generation vaccines development, efforts successful, that’s something could change game again. heart attack patient, stroke patient, vehicle collision patient. go ICU, share insufficient resources. disagree 12 month time frame. see good B cell cell response vaccines indicates vaccines probably give long term protection severe disease. instead look time frame decade more. would say one highly likely contract virus coming decade+. vaccines look significantly less risky catching COVID. Capitalism  capitalism But, vaccinated? else equal, vaccinated patient likely survive. Clearly else always equal. 2 counties scan 50 percent People vaccinated unfortunately train many many people, that's people hold outs “I couldn’t live there. Doesn’t get really cold?”  
 
*Gets hit hurricanes, floods, earthquakes* chance vaccinated sick without underlying condition.  serious disease animal besides Homo Sapiens? think either misquote misspoken phrase said English. watched press conference yesterday hear statement. issue really there's million people (including 0-11 group) unvaccinated. Considering quickly Delta spread, people easy targets lot get sick time; cause problem really matters: overcrowding hospital system.  big brain time ! cows probably give cows.  sure level confidence, since fake cards distributed various markets.

The CDC estimates 35-40% **ALL** Covid infections completely asymptomatic. one major causes early spread, since people still contagious despite even knowing it. situation patient could prevented almost cases getting vaccinated. feel healthcare workers thrust upon them.

Let antivax throw fit get mad want. right thing issue mandates. thought too, asymptomatic people needing wear masks prevent spread feel like testing regularly help even more. Reinfections variant extremely rare, evidence getting infection provides better immunity vaccine. Maybe I'm missing something, would affect statistic? people would already considered 1 shot true lol Never said 0 effect, arguing one feel right.

You're confidently wrong, good luck that. Whatever works better traditionally you.  Think they're afraid needles want admit probably go work police department. reminds Catholic Church moving predator priest new parish.  kind thing that's hard discover prove - exposed get sick.

Friends mine (a couple) vaccinated, went Florida, started show symptoms, got tested, ""lost"" result (!?). drove home instead flying thought might contagious including hotel stay, GF cooped car hotel room 14 hours symptomatic. got back, got tested, positive, negative, got treated, fine.

So almost certainly exposed never got sick.  Nobody except Danny DeVito  1 10,000 vaccinated people get virus would colossal waste time.  imagine perfect  scientists say case COVID-19 vaccine boosters point weak. might necessary people, could divert much-needed doses away others. 4 August, World Health Organization called moratorium boosters least end September. “Wasting resources boosters already protected severe disease really make much sense,” says Laith Jamal Abu-Raddad, infectious-disease epidemiologist Weill Cornell Medicine—Qatar Doha. “Down line, probably, would need think it. really, don’t strong arguments right now.” Super conservative Christian area. called typo.  Yes, vaxxed friend got breakthrough case. live girlfriend catch despite sleeping together tested positive sharing several hours car day got tested. basically four days moderately awful cold symptoms. comments upvote patient likely survive going vaccinated one.

that's entirely true

Ah makes sense. attended sold concert required proof vaccination negative covid test. crowd 30,000 wife get sort breakthrough infection concert super spreader event. 

People online living life vaccinated person seem skewed view really goes public. massive underground forgery gangs going crashing gates across America. think heavy moderation banning left people certain viewpoint become echo chamber them.

It sad see people vaccinated, young healthy afraid leave houses. new misinformation -- people safe think aren't.  really feel like it? Unfortunately unless get birdjesus Helix come feels like may never beat elite four lol. theory, yes.

If look DNA (or RNA whatever viruses carry) transcription factors viruses use compare humans, viruses tend make much mistakes due something call sloppy polymerase (or least Netherlands), likely evolutionary benefit allows virus evolve adapt faster. essentially yes, viruses mutated mutating faster.

Can go much faster now? think that's unlikely. virus come point balance. would mutate many ""offspring"" viruses would order worth ability mutate faster.

Do note information based general viruses clue specifics regarding covid, I'm assuming similarities. goat DC metro area everything pretty normal since late May. delta maybe 25% retail places require mask entry bars restaurants etc still open.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* chose expand Medicaid. administration. kept record various pharmacies/sites actually providing vaccines.

Having fake card anything. wife household two positive family members get sick. tested negative multiple times symptoms. got 2nd vaccine shot January still holding up.

I'm seeing thing friends. kids getting covid school bringing home spreading among vaccinated family members. really hit miss odds favor. CDC, check thier website. covid patients friends family, would imagine. Also society large, since part proper training would PPE use avoid gralthcare workers constantly catching covid patients spreading it. Opened right labor day Delta variant however much virulent transmissible previous variants.

This bit contrast saying. virus following flu pattern. different indeed precautions taken people, it? OK lockdown masks/distancing still place, right? many people, experts included, assumed early would another SARS-like outbreak (which nasty contained several thousand known cases), would like influenza. pandemic planning assumed new influenza strain would likely candidate cause next. totally useless repeating doctors experts said throughout pandemic (I.e. mask wearing, this). wondering even work day simply sit copying others research results announced world oh found? guy work shouting ivermectin works despite wife vet knowing better. can't reason anyone. lost hope people. lost. They're giving unconsenting prison populations. Sounds like forced sterilization extra steps get worse. Currently 93% country donors. yeah.

Edit: measure antibodies. actually vaccinated might measurable. live winter - BAD weeks, feels like never ends, really bad

I used work company based Minneapolis years traveled NC multiple times year. Nearly every year would start snowing October chance snow storm let late April (which still possibility snow storms).

January one year high -5. news said exposed skin 10 minutes outside would guarantee frostbite, even less time wind chill. outside actively trying harm you, really place wanted live lol

The locals downplayed basically said stayed indoors majority year. Mu dies down, another one behind it. speak anecdotally. sister ICU nurse major US city. vast majority patients unvaccinated. vaccinated people she’s seen organ-donor patients. immunosuppressants probably don’t respond vaccine majority population does. thought goats soda immune covid. Well, guess technically are. Soda sure. Absolutely. vast majority people less half percent chance dying fully vaccinated acceptable risk, ones fear distancing (downvotes incoming). even harder empathize knowing cases deaths due antivaxx crowd. whats moble drive f150s nobody going anywhere. assign blame whoever, change outcome. Fact world (as whole) screwed up. now, that's important.   disagree...although may people sneak system help promote people get vaccinated keep good percentage unvaxxed away. also probably swear protest NFL screw it...don't let door hit unvaxxed ass way out. Hate say it, thing going continue mutate reek havoc decades. going end variants. One going dangerous next, while.human beings continue act ignorant.    think PTO bigger deal people realize younger groups people. lot younger people know aren’t scared COVID personally (and I’ve multiple friends remark really want Covid quarantine paid 2 weeks) getting incentive PTO really helpful group. see reason test asymptomatic vaccinated people. It’s complicated. difference developing country things aren’t even available people money education. Rich people places literally fly abroad sometimes get medical treatments. mean, America wealth stratified even drugs readily available geographically remain inaccessible economically.

What’s going hospitals becoming first kind inaccessible addition second kind. instead ambulance trip leaving massive bill, ambulance might even show now.

Alive crushing medical debt still surviving. Dying heart attack ambulance important things save life means dead. it? depends answer (going sleep read article now, sorry) def guaranteed get sick even exposed. show symptoms get tested. don’t, don’t. due respect, get implies fat. Alpha definitely emerged Southeast England. variant appeared US went cause major problems internationally? Beta appeared South Africa, Gamma appeared Brazil, reigning champ Delta appeared India.

I’m Canadian, it’s I’m butthurt US implicated. given US, South particular, handling things, wouldn’t surprised see extra-dangerous Son Delta appear spread worldwide. might “Florida Variant”, “DeSantis variant”.  March 2022 almost here. RIP us.    Same, soldiers vaccinations slapped stickers card sent way, identification it.  Well I’m fine starting 50, sister didn’t get raise nurse two years bc covid. hilarious bc much travel nurses getting paid probably even hospital. leaving nurse dermatology office. she’ll travel nurse year.  Exactly, stopped waiting around things used to/wanted do. There’s always going risk life since I’m vaccinated risk relatively low. It’s acceptable risk actually enjoy life again.  he's removing vaccines little kids need go school too? Right! Let's vaccines all. 

Stonks toddler size coffins go way up! Yeah 1100 positive students COVID first 12 days school Greenville county alone** two deaths 15 years old. true. hospitals North Idaho offer level care similar I’ve worked around country. Doesn’t matter, still get flu vaccine ever year even they’ve flu makes less likely spread it. Even they’ve covid, immunity guaranteed permanent. Vaccines always required medical field. anti vax hospital disease incubator. hospital budgeting. guess thought travel nurses temporary regular nurses permanent. Hospital admin try get away can, guess. don’t know inner workings it. magic solution guy said return normal life. said, happen could handle another year restrictions. Since obviously won't, I'm living almost normal life mask inside crowded areas preventive measure limit contact covid vulnerable people. thing many activities still go normal despite vaccines available. delta current concern, goes away what? epsilon variant on... Vaccinated people profession? Testing every single vaccinated person across country seems woefully inefficient would screw test supply. I’m taking US btw. It’s atypical federal government take part healthcare general population way, normally records handled states. Michigan online database app check vaccination status, states don’t.

Since initial rollout handled US Military (i.e. states), left states track put piece paper. says? wonder whether ginning fake cards distributing selling them.  Pretty messed stuff.  friend’s daughter got covid. Neither her, husband, son got covid zero chance weren’t exposed living together. start consider vaccinated people get tested weekly help slow spread virus? Ah shit typo lol thanks man shit started months ago CDC decided put TERRIBLE messaging resulted articles like PEOPLE SPREAD DELTA VARIANT, SIMILAR VIRAL LOADS VACCINATED UNVACCINATED""

Nobody CDC said, hey, say, ""while vaccines still limit transmission, event breakthrough case, much less likely infection unvaccinated, breakthrough case spread disease""

Instead put vague statements easily misinterpreted mean vaccines nothing stop spread COVID.  tried that. People listen; government refused facilitate anyway. cover severity virus China near time outbreak? really? Absolutly abysmal numbers compared Germany example. 11 aren’t required it’s enough vaccinating would enough, give up?

Considering lockdowns saved single life UK deaths per capita Sweden, yes. Um….the people won’t vaccinate won’t vaccinate kids. don’t think grasp many parents actively protesting mask mandates schools. It’s like want kids get Covid based administration vaccine registration vaccine? Asking many people fake registration. Bullshit. First, tracked breakthroughs long time. Second, many organizations are. There's dozens sources show effectiveness infection 0... that's complete lie. 

And reason nobody thinks vaccination eliminate social distribution problem getting 2 shots booster everyone, theoretical impossibility. Still #16. Denmark leading way 14 tests per person (population almost 6 million, 80 million tests). Meanwhile US less 2 tests per person, putting 31. They're also proper Drs.  Yeah, different state got J&amp;J shot. think helped low vax area - said pharmacist didn’t ask questions gave shot. (They sister husband.) alpha. Delta absolutely killing much younger people, ICU’s filled people 30’s 40’s dying delta.  Fair question brought internet news media hill. aren’t ppl antibodies I.e. infected survived, counted vaccinated population? 

Study shown robust immune response. 17x antibodies, thus wouldn’t reinfection even rare who’ve had? . think help us ID problem areas make distinction. 

I really don’t like “the hill “ said fair argument. certainly thought chance early eradicate everyone masked vaccines we're deployed quickly.

After ball rolling anti masking anti vaccines lost hope quickly. humanity can't anything nice. forgetting people rural areas still filling hospitals. get car wreck, heart attack, etc, feeling effects low vaccination parts state. Probably won’t roll number 76 80% I’m receive second dose.

And took long? I’m really go outside world type person, also random bouts IBS keep around bathroom times… PTO big one friends, us mid 20s. either allowed pto, ""allowed"" it. Nobody wants spend one day week possibly take another day lose money, along pissing boss coworkers pick slack. I'm immuno compromised got back April, one small subgroup uptight vaccinations. people denied simple care that’s resulting deaths large group people irresponsible. Sorry, doesn’t work like that. side needs make effort too. We’ve generously patient here. don’t want die. don’t wish death severe covid infection anybody, right now, swarming hospital. Instead violin speeches empty questions, team red emphasize truth what’s stake. 9/11 seeing friends basically hippies, talk enlisting.

I tell friends I'm throwing hat COVID vaccine trials?..... act like I've completely lost mind. chance what? cat bag end 2019.

in personal finance world, people often say ""the best time start saving today."" already shown Rogan’s take anti-vaxers article. response even now, “You take medical advice Joe Rogan?”  Joe lying flip flopped, doubt got vaccinated. guy says trusts immune system spends $100,000 cocktail treatments doesn’t explain happened immune system. people stupid impressionable think blame (most though) people intentionally spreading lies misinformation. hard anyone keep things days.  40% reduction odds infected fucking fantastic. fuck talking about? agree children get vaccine approval. Hospitals full still way many unvaccinated people. 

You catch even vaccinated - odds severe illness, hospitalization, death lowered exponentially. 

Breakthrough cases happen, yes - fully vaccinated folks get sick, die. like someone could die flu. 

Nothing life perfect, there’s plenty good news. choose keep things perspective. Remember, “news” wants attention. want eyes screens mouse clicks. Pay attention scientists say, ignore anything sensational. thought thing time committed fucking crazy. nod. Definitely put shit.  eh picking hairs. Dumb people don’t always make decisions themselves. 

If (joe) republicans trump didn’t make fun masks prevention, none fools would vaccines. date, 74 million children United States, 300 COVID deaths thousand serious illnesses. Hospitalization numbers look worse, Dr. Roshni Mathew Stanford's Children's Hospital says numbers inflated.

Granted, pre-delta, everything I've read far increase hospitalizations children simply due sheer volume. rate changed. IIRC, goal 70% fully vaccinated end June. 
It's September, we're yet. I'd love good news side feel good.  He's really bad track record throughout whole pandemic, wonder many died due false information Rogan spread. roughly 20% covid positive vaccinated individuals spread one person 60% sharing single person. Delta R0 well 1.  Joe Rogan one many reasons. main reason brother fallen misinformation propaganda, matter sources. Dealing dad moment, hope families smarten up. People without kids don’t care kids. It’s going get bad October. Around Halloween. soon windows close.  Vaccines reduce odds symptomatic infection; reduce rate hospitalization much more.

Although 26% hospitalized covid patients vaccinated underscore need boosters eldery risk. Right? NEVER funny. Whenever actual comedian on, like Joe Kleine interviewing Michael Jordan LeBron James. wave lawsuits nearly half dozen states, families students disabilities joining legal battle masks schools. Complaints filed Tennessee, Florida, Utah, Texas South Carolina argue **restrictions mask mandates infringe disability rights** children disabilities forced choose health hear time, 'Oh, kids preexisting conditions ones get sick die,' "" Schwaigert says. ""Well, that's kid. child. lot preexisting conditions, matters.""

This argument “masks personal choice” holds water. Smokers quit dealing horrible cravings nicotine. Obese folks drop weight stringent diets exercise months/years. Diabetes cannot cured though.

But HIV? Diabetes? could cure two shots, prevent shots, people would line droves. something can't disprove.  people supposed resentful?

Basic human dignity guess old family member? Yeah I'm well aware I'm downvoted lol. Reddit appreciate spinning back

jk obvi  selfish. Asking millions people wear masks, socially distance nonsense gets dreamed protect cannot get vaccinated selfish.

No, reason still vaccination rates. live area 80% vaccination rate low case rates, yet still mask mandate. opposed spend time parts country avoid it. Risk severe illness children significantly low. Risk aggregate flu children. agree, let's get kids vaccinated, let's avoid overstating/exaggerating much at-risk children are. seems like person would find arrested  case long Covid. point feel like that’s legal copout himself. point fact constantly says he’s moron anyone tries sue him. viable explanation what’s going Israel? It’s strange they’re highly vaccinated yet experiencing massive surge. numbers showing people testing positive hospitalized etc. I’d like see data. expect? comedian. problem many listeners forgot part think kind fount knowledge.

Fuck every person perfectly capable getting vaccine, doesn't. “My immune system handle it” :gets Covid, buys medicine poors can’t afford: Dude opposite guru.

There’s reason many conservatives like him. didn’t tell want hear wouldn’t listen moron science background science wrong? kidding!  Ya think?

Joe never MMA fighter. champion Taekwondo practitioner growing up, later started training kickboxing found brain damage great career option. Joe fight though.  Joe Rogan said Ronda Rousey would beat Floyd Mayweather fight. people prolly even listen podcast, Joe Rogan finds articles research done scientists doctors ignored mainstream media discuss guests.

Nothing says corona, vaccines, medicine science behind idea, that's saying says 'Don't listen moron'.

Me personally agree everything says, like listen peoples opinions things make mind it. 

But guess everyone time research listen hours long podcasts, get info clickbait headlines.  Really? Give break. Delta. It’s whole new ballgame weeks bad Minnesota. relieved warmth Milwaukee left Minnesota. cold there.  That's eating shit fun ""stories"" useless ""stories"" people taking vaccine dying/suffering severe side effects. Stories/anecdotes effective tool developing informed view.

There much misinformation fear addicts covid deniers. people literally call CDC data ""dangerous misinformation"" sufficiently line bias.

The put rough political position, especially US president started trashing deflect blame himself.

How figure out? recommendation people drink bleach lightbulb enemas? proposal nuke hurricanes? part repeatedly trashed scientific medical Fauci scientists, including CDC itself, public speakers. [...] giving policy advice.

Dr. Fauci’s job duties consist (a) directing medical research infectious diseases, (b) giving policy advice America’s political leadership, (c) giving information FDA heap shit [...] need [...] get way.

This really bad take. attitude direct cause current societal Vaccines would super effective containing way back April may last year

Vaccines cannot rolled entire US world population without substantial evidence large-scale clinical trials demonstrating safety effectiveness. vaccines rolled faster past vaccines history: companies making got special dispensation multiple stages process concurrently rather serially (as usually done), much speed process without compromising it.

Arguably FDA radically different relaxed set rules pandemic compared normal times, different standard safety efficacy think large proportion unvaccinated likely get sick, that’s something argue changing next time, something could easily changed fly 2020.

Personally think biggest fuckups FDA quickly authorizing instant, ideally at-home Covid tests. Instead insisting test sufficient accuracy make perfect clinical decisions, goal pandemic get people tested easily often possible sick identified quarantined contacts traced Scapegoating things hindsight

You think Trump “scapegoat”? don’t think understand word means. pandemic need jabbed. wait, mixed martial arts? Iirc Texas already sending patients states, problem Texas big place, sometimes enough time get state hospital. Plus hospitals also filling up.   immediately blamed CNN like programmed bot vaccine definitely keep hospitals ok territory that’s probably do.

Last Updated: May 29, 2021 shite. Joe Rogan moron. Good article. Thanks. I'm refute comment. let get breeches first.   Yeah… agree. He’s got loads issues, one. thinks getting vaccine isn’t masculine, yeah… he’s idiot. Man shit even come from? Life beyond frustrating right now… Thank comment! comes Mu... That's Joe Rogan bigmouthed idiot. 70+ you’re taking Joe Rogan’s advice anything, deserve get. Read comment know fuck I'm talking about. 

A 40% less change infected _great_ **you personally**. importantly, drastically lower chance getting severe disease now. Hooray you!

But **the large scale virus**, i.e. pandemic whole, _it mean anything_ terms curbing spread. Even everybody world vaccinated, 40% fewer people getting infected absolutely nothing stop even slow spread virus delta infectious is.

Again, CDC shifted vaccination message broad scale ""prevent spread"" individualistic ""protect hospitalization death"", ""keep hospital system unburdened"". Read slides posted. understand US can't allow vaccinated people visit, time long passed excluding vaccinated people. I'm Colombian huge probability variant got 3 months ago highest peak mu, got covid original God knows one let tell u mu worse toke bed hospital 2 weeks almost went ICU. afraid delta general mu big problem all.  happens “both sides”. story isn’t favorable preconceptions.  gonna say, every city Europe need worry unvaccinated Americans trying get in. Unless Carnival Cruises makes stop something.  want hear aliens DMT trips.

Exactly. Exactly, like he's supposed exempt ball busting Tough guys afraid masks! idiots would call ""propoganda"" also varying opinions shape Earth, Moon landing. would depend state’s governor, think, don’t think governors idea. Living AZ know sure governor won’t put lockdown. issue is, Joe's problem people trust qualified people? Like, sane person going trust Rogan's opinion things everyone knows knows nothing about, people think response qualified person gonna change idiots' minds.

Chances missing inflatable cushion low. Chances dying becoming injured smoke inhalation someone rescue pretty high. much terrifying jump, question best option. other, totally unrelated news, state rabid anti vaxxer ivermectin proponent got appointed board health Plural means greater 1.

In case it’s thousands, 1000s. 

In 1500 one thousand extra five hundred tacked on. 

Technically number greater thousand isn’t thousand greater contains one thousand. need least two thousands pluralize. Free ICU capacity mean lack triage.

Soon, though, run people immune previous infection. causes R value suddenly drop lot without external measures. Exactly. I’ve seen several people solidly, “I won’t get vaccine!” thinking horrible thing would happen due it.

That… hard position hold half people know got vaccine, boss breathing neck get vaccine, 6+ months everyone personally know vaccinated doesn’t seem single problem, non-vaccinators dying left right Yeah I’m glad we’re getting transmissible variant escape vaccines too.  Age co morbidities factors. vaccinated also significant factor. It’s clear day odds greatly improved you’ve vaccinated - however you’re old immune compromised may held well time - providing third doses populations. think like 220 230... who's counting.

Alternatively, right job listing offering nurses $50k Last time checked, chiropractors experts anything Pre-Delta proper mitigation practices (masks, etc.), kids low transmission rates. harms closing school significantly greater risk COVID.

Unfortunately, people heard “go back normal 2021, mitigation unnecessary”. People throw word around lot, hero so. might saved lives. NSW Australia hit 75% adults first shot well gives hope us getting back normalcy

I'm really sure else federal government point. So, er, die blood loss guess... exactly infecting 1000x amount people flu, CDC estimates flu infections 9-45M year. 18 months Covid roughly we’ve seen 40M infections U.S. many vaccine. 1000x infections? would mean every single person U.S. would getting Covid like 40+ times year. Even infects 2-3x people flu (which would ton) still won’t mutate faster flu. says Covid mutate like flu likely stay: avery bad news hospitals intensive care units full COVID- 19 ans different Variants patients!. course is. It’s human coronavirus mildly lethal. common cold 200 viruses, 25% coronaviruses. COVID novel coronavirus. 10 years everyone times vaccines updated. Eventually lethality goes down. 

People die common cold induced viral pneumonia. Somewhere along line discount that. COVID going suck next 5-10 years there’s light end tunnel. saying endemic strains mutating rate quicker common cold meaning getting rid thing mitigate consequences. Life expectancy going get lowered covid main killer old people foreseeable time. 

Once enough time passes human race lived disease enough time hopefully closer common cold now. 

Alternatively medical advances happen worst case scenario accept higher mortality rate...   strain inevitable.   Long covid hell, vaxxed cuts one's chances 50% (that is, case breakthrough case). Still scary. troll. They're small onions.

But French harvest love, hand, happy dutch farmers harvesting small onions machine, 10x efficiently, also allowed call small onions 'shallots'.

It's known viruses diseases. one. see Black Plague meme? Like… Black Plague ppl like, know what? I’ll go live life. Fuck plague. Lol Nah, protected anyway could. Idk ppl make huge deal vaccine. Especially FDA approval. 🤷🏻‍♂️ don’t pay attention much though. Lol both.  [Then  sharp stomach pains yesterday evening got terrified appendicitis!  may asked FDA booster shots given right full dose. know got one volume starter shots.  CT took pandemic pretty seriously - good job 2020. loosened bit spring year - got walloped Delta. I'm sure they'll going forward school year starting - lot fatigue (like everywhere else) - slightly higher vaccination rate neighbors (NY NJ) - hopefully increase month next. give up. said COVID mutate like flu? mother minority (and lives states). deep vein thrombosis that's reason vaccinating. deeply convinced incredibly small percentage die complications vaccinations even statistics persuade her. even spoke two doctors (one UK based, one US based) convince her. frustrating, accept choice contracts Covid, also consequence. survived MERS initial Sars (and would expect she'd inclined get vaccinated NOPE!). Fortunately, homebody going risk anyone herself. step-father pilot sooner later, contract know that's going turn out. people wearing us cases started going back up. like 20/day whole state months. went back 200/day, people masked masks we're required week ago. us vaccinated take seated. Unvaccinated take eat. there's still motivation get vaccinated... plus takes away testing requirement, nice.

But clear, personally got waaaay back March. Woah mean won’t investigating per usual  shortness breath can't sleep normally breathing warrants seeing doctor / urgent care. position would go Urgent care / ER immediately. instant got Wuhan. get vaccinated reopen. ever time distance learning would NOW. watch Dr. Vuong YouTube. Today, talking college football even high school football. Says without doubt alone cause spikes cases over. 

We obviously still ride!  many experts screwed beginning. vaccines AAP pushed kids return spread narrative kids low transmission rates. got people think “why vaccinate mask kids then.” it’s late change narrative. Almost know do. I'm physical therapist doctorate, never refer ask others call doctor. Every chiro right front door. issue... would bet that's least part it. Although read CDC still estimates number around 1.3 million, small fraction increase would attributed that, estimates correct. become ok hurt others simply based religion?

Uh. Pick history book see organized religion used reasoning accelerant majority conflict species. ""the right side"" Religion used justification view ""ok"".


Its obviously ""ok"", Religion warps mind, people replace facts logic feelings faith. dulls people's ability question, replaces blind following. People have, throught history, continue crazy shit religion justification.


Organized religion (which cults entrenched history) stamped prejudice. well damn, right. days confused Bones get covid

Checkmate. one reasons delta took first place

But it’s primary reason. primary reason multiple times transmissible much higher viral load. hypothesis mu could really bad could lead high number reinfections among people a/b/g/d, well there’s really much evidence support that. vax slows hospitalisations long haul cases, cut chances long-hauling half. Still scary immunocompromised. ""plz get vaccinated. stop oding Ivermectin"" trusted whole truth, series half-truths contradictions. Greece previous minister health doctor still unvaccinated, suggests facebook patients use ivermectin, calls vaccine ""experimental"", arguing monoclonal antibodies instead.

And people wonder stuck 60%.

Please someone drop nuke us. Right, boils lucky, hear you. point longer care people die..... exercise lot dead people. way know exactly behind increase. I'm guessing number factors including full FDA approval. guess I'm unwed mother? Better go tell wife. awkward. Sounds like grounds divorce. Unless likes married person would flip like personal medical decision done rationally documented possibility harming others. think need religious belief that.

There religions anti-vax rule; America, dare question religions beliefs, become catchall justify bad behavior politics. Yeah, logged government App see tests weeks ago, stopped counting 30 someting tests I've taken. free course.  yet people blaming individual behavior biology virus. 

It’s weird bait-and-switch. terrible idea psychology perspective. people resisting vaccine sort conspiracy theorists believe nothing good free.

A much better strategy would say 'starting 3 weeks, vaccines cost $500'. state send squat. paper vaccine certificate. I'm Florida btw, really... Surprising. Mass casualty exercise exercise military done many casualties known ahead time everyone saved. Thus, people quickly triaged survival chances. low chances get least resources care kept comfortable possible til pass. 

Great scene pearl harbor done.   Primarily socio-economic anxieties since, well... lingering since recession '99--to say nothing Great one '08. diapers Reagan, dude's administration created Rust Belt.

Anyway, desperate people turn desperate sources. good time snake oil salesperson job, said, get vaccine, lose mask. majority us got vaccinated soon could. Guess what? We’re still wearing masks. Lol Got part, right?  mean honestly gross simplification part. 

The UK US better worse culturally led world beter part 20th century feel though failings spread enabled countries failing.

But answer question, Iota first identified California, made far variant interest. Yeah guess possible effective sociopath us bamboozled. Always was… dude dumbest person News Radio show fucking Andy Dock it. Reddit: joe rogan can’t opinions agree saying 100% yes better treatment people would get honestly point people themselves. obviously doctor show entertainment. want real information virus things done maybe take advice JRE. want advice fitness, shrooms, weed sure maybe even got best yourself. 

Maybe I'm thinking wrong way hey I'm personally taking horse glue telling anyone to.   neighbor put house market, it’s Ohio 🤣 So? People get listen want. want force people listen him? keep saying scientists need communicate better. No

I agree people need better education

But disagree this. amount public education (as currently have, describing) fix problem. Science hard, medical ethics hard, public policy hard, human tendencies hard. Even re-structure public education system around ideas problem solved (though still things).

What need rebuild communities. need focus community leaders, adult education, community ethics, information flow. social problems going complicated nuanced we're going able school science class, think ""when ever need use life?""

The solution mess lie science class. lies art classes. communications, writing, history, philosophy, ways learn understand humans work, learn make reinforce social systems insulate us con men grifters.

This purpose higher education supposed be. STEM hard possible get big bucks. you’re worried baby / 12 life don’t go Seahawks game. complain sake complaining. fantastic policy balances economy health conscious. Take bitching SEC stadiums restrictions / requirements. Joe Rogan talk show Great effective treatments, fucking matter hospitals get overwhelmed people bother mitigate spread. Joe/his crew posted clip. show humility? really get hate circlejerk surrounding him. 99% people would say dumb incorrect things conversations recorded 9 hours week w/e is.

Edit: say watched anything recent maybe gotten worse, idk. tense.

Advertisers, too. Constantly.  believe told Joe body also hot (98.6 degrees freedom units) sauna (150 195) able kill virus “bullshit.” Joe clearly still didn’t accept opinion Dr. Osterholm. wanted believe bad.   Honestly, I’m starting understand listeners considering Ivermectin now… really needs go back focusing meathead punching enthusiast. really good commentator, thing good at, since pandemic, he's started getting worse even that.    tell listen him

I hate argument. calls dumb/tells people listen like twice year - hundreds hours recorded conversation.

It's like starts every show disclaimer. idk podcast sucks

his stand pretty funny imo though lol Yea definitely isnt doctor scientist. wrong good less week testing negative porcast again.. study posted week ago so, allegedly comparing various types immunity levels amongst varying degrees vaccinated people well vaccinated + recovered. Wish I’d saved :( Ah yes, everyone knows baby born immediately sent school! Comparing large pool vaccinated people small pool non-immune unvaccinated. non-immune unvaccinated driving this, less 20% population accounting 60% infections. \^This person gets it.

You really need several courses stats scientific study methodology understand even begin see valid study not. know ton specific discipline too. San Antonio Express-News requires login. press release Joint Base San Antonio seems story: [ARNORTH military hospital support FEMA begins Idaho, Arkansas, expands know joking, looks dictate medical expertise. mind elaborating findings ? won’t able see till later Lol exactly thinking  2,400 New Yorkers hospitalized COVID Hochul's latest report, marks 200% increase since Aug. 1. rapid admissions increases jolted state last month, though, appear stabilizing. Deaths lagging indicator, number may continue rise, data shows is, even core viral metrics decline stabilize comparison, August 1st Florida 10,700 people hospitalized Covid [Florida coronavirus podcasting MMA comedian playing fast loose scientific facts? quote Bill Burr (a significantly better comedian) Rogan's podcast: 
 want start bullshit. I'm going sit medical degree, listening medical degree, American flag behind you, smoking cigar, acting like know what's better CDC. watch news every two weeks. I'm like 'Mask mask? Still mask? Alright, masks.' That's give fuck about. Makes sense. personal thoughts would since thread going viral article going viral, clearly next internet drama. People love would watch reaction video, maybe many.

Ultimately really care. get people do, really affect end day. really depends are. 

Somebody else already talked NYC. I'm Washington DC area, things tightened Delta got going.

In particular, parents desperate kids go school person year, means everybody mask again, that's price they're willing pay.

Sure, there's lunatic fringe anti-vax, anti-mask nutters running around making noise, least here, they're charge.   HeLa cells That's generous take.

I really care Rogan views himself. reality even thinks he's created environment fosters unbiased intellectual discussion, he's done opposite. many fans believe even understand word say, merely listening smart people talk somehow also makes smarter.

It's dangerous completely invalidates need genuine education. He's redefined means think critically simply listening ""both sides"" drawing conclusion half eaten crayon.   like person said - immunity created basically grinding infecting organisms proteins sending lymph tissue immune cells ""study"" make antibodies correspond them.


Naturally immunity fragments viral proteins get sent. Vaccine part spike protein codes sent.  Since Rogan conservative? purposely cushioned position changing ""horse dewormer"" ""livestock dewormer""

I. Never. Said. Horse. Dewormer.

At point would like give screenshot something prove obviously I'm getting through. 

It's like think one person conversation, despite posted subreddit thousands subscribers. 

When someone tells missing point, maybe consider missing point. goal use democracy/freedom speech tool attack system itself. Obviously put even squeak governments, ramifications severe. Even true, conclusion suggests better let people die Covid. logic put bullet people contract covid prevent risk spread. Remove unvaccinated. made choice, live die it. still wear masks everytime Im indoors smaller area. good time go events like that, double vaccination recieved supposed good gets. He’s confident moron, trained respond types. okay satan 

Maybe focus better education teach scrutiny real thing know ever tested positive COVID, know ever felt ill, know ever took medication.

For someone coming ever increasing fire bullshit saying covid, saying took everything pushes saying worked great works viewers.

Considering he's dumb fuck routinely talks shit reason believe even COVID.

The fact taking steroids time taking shit took counter productive suppress immune system think even shitty doctor would less willing prescribe everything one go. could gone multiple shitty doctors knows, charlatan's word things happened. 

AFAIK would want immune system strong possible fight COVID active immune response COVID control take prednisone help deal cytokine storm overly large immune response. CHIROPRACTORS MEDICAL DOCTORS. This. He’s bright dude he’s successful enough people don’t want call bullshit. pro vaccine wish everyone would stop idiots get move on. argument people ignorant fact monoclonals offered free charge aren’t kind “elitist cure available rich people”. state using computer system 1990s runs DOS DMV system. pensions still paper.

The pills gonna literally ivermectin.  Pat Sajak wingman.  Agreed, principal. think go bottom list triage situation scarcity. meet kid parking lot every day eat instead inside everyone. school like hassle, feel like lunch time highest risk. know that's option many parents. really sucks kids situation. lymphatic drainage massage may time-consuming costly face-rolling predecessor, it’s pseudoscientific links may make long-lasting, lucrative service.  one listen Joe Rogan anything. dumb guy fried brain drugs alpha brain. Now, he’s dumb guy ego thinks knows shit. Plus, mean, he’s comedian isn’t funny. isn’t even good actual job, would take advice things qualifications in?

I honestly idea guy fans. stopped menstruating 1st Pfizer shot, months ago. Going see Gyno soon worried since doesnt seem causing issues want kids. unfortunate, governor aggressive promoting vaccinations, even though he's pachyderm party.

But people listen... seems harm worth considering matter plays out.

It's understanding covid relief act passed earlier year able used stopgap time being. least that's heard NPR days ago. Yeah. he's older brother someone knew loser thought enlightened.

Except got famous. there's social media.

Loser Contrarian Extraordinaire correct answer. Steroid rot?   shhhhhhh ruining circlejerk  Gainesville actually pretty good vaccination rate remember lol Still great show whole cast amazing. yes, Hartman terrible loss.  point Joe Rogan responsible deaths people think he's credible source covid information. blood hands.  Micheal Osterholm, made accurate predictions bad COVID could get March 2020, remained best voice subject date, even becoming part Biden transition team consulting COVID.

I cannot imagine dense leave conversation end taking horse dewormer vaccine Osterholm assured Rogan way this. people got it. LITERALLY love conspiracy theories. Like killed Kennedy, really attacked world trade center, mk ultra controlling Charles Manson. diet coke drinking leading trans people Satan even much me. Liability reasons not, true. He's scamming people. core, Rogan entertainment purpose fully believe he's aware that. speak highly educated people ask questions humble enough realize higher authority subject. scamming, he'd go rants even bother opinion others. Try r/eyebleach attempt unsee. \*News Radio 99% ignored inventions rightfully ignored fucking stupid.

And that's situation Joe Rogan. ignore without second thoughts absolutely zero reason assume would one come anything smart. better sources pay attention chance hearing good ideas information much higher. Thanks permission lol Furthermore, paper claims majority mutations indeed random (purifying selection removing mutations detrimental virus), indeed positive selection towards D614G (and related) mutations. main idea however due adaption virus towards humans host, rather due vaccines.


Thats directly link study supplied.. extinction event happened march 2020 long vaccines natural immunity existed..

you obviously reading comprehension skills required debate this.  Warning science speech IPCC report.

No. That's ""shit hitting fan"" Warning climate change longer realize. screaming ""it's basically late, let's see save""

You cannot wait science proof everything. Sometimes - example new virus - educated guesses based past experience enough act on.  feel inclined wear mask indoors. one stopping promise. post locked comments veering topic. article fact checking one Joe Rogans claims leaky vaccines. 


“Read responds: “We're talking different virus different vaccines. details biology really matter lot. chicken vaccines worked with, first-generation vaccine, definitely reduced disease, severity death.” unlike COVID mRNA vaccines, chicken vaccine “didn't stop transmission all.” one key differences studied Read’s paper current situation global pandemic. “Those [vaccinated] chickens kept churning virus weeks weeks weeks.” Again, key difference. “It’s different virus SARS-2. key issue transmissibility.”

More transmission increases likelihood mutation. Thankfully, COVID-19 Vaccines reduce transmission reduce opportunity mutation.

“Think what's happening evolution,” offers Read. “Mutations occur anytime [virus] replicates. replication, variants generated. moment, vast majority replication happening unvaccinated people. tell majority cases hospital unvaccinated individuals. evolutionary action happening moment.” 

Are mRNA vaccines ‘leaky’?

Rogan seems think mRNA vaccines quite leaky breakthrough infections. Read points vaccine 100% effective. Although still need data determine leaky are, rate breakthrough infections vaccinated people remains statistically low enough consider mRNA vaccines highly effective preventing infection.

“We know moment leaky things are. conceivable actually close non-leaky. I'm amazed good mRNA vaccines are. They're incredibly good.”

Read’s concerned misrepresentation research causing vaccine hesitancy.

“The study tweeted thousand times last night, according metrics,” says Read. “I physician England reach Friday asking [clarify] patients using paper argue vaccination.” Calling question effectiveness vaccines never intention 2015 study. “I genuinely shocked. I've work 20 years vaccines might drive evolution viruses. There's nothing 20 years work argues favor withholding lifesaving vaccines. shocking me.” adds, “There 600,000 Americans dead far. vast majority deaths vaccine-preventable. There's single scenario would argue favor using [vaccines] save next hundred thousand. one scenario.”    one problems solves itself.  Remember Phoebe saw Chandler Monica across street? Yeah, that's clicking link. listen Joe occasionally interesting guest. said dumb monkey would never take medical advice him.  shit. F'ing quack HeLa first immortal cell line, others today. think mABs made plasma cell myeloma, HeLa cervical cancer. I'm also biologist though.  said already plan got it. knew doctors call treatments get. told everyone “if young healthy you’ll fine” probably poured tens thousands dollars medication at. 

The anti-vax people watch show type people complain people mooching government anything contribute. 

Anti-vax people sucking country dry millions probably billions dollar hospital resources. They’re costing us way “homeless” can’t shut about. vast majority people watch show selfish closed minded people country. They’re fucking dumb can’t even make statement something think everything perspective.   slight pinkeye, goodness eyes crusty every morning. 

They also itched nearly two months felt better symptoms.

But throat first symptom. literally said COVID treatment plan ready go got sick. 

Why would someone need place something “immune system could handle?” becomes straw breaks camel’s back?

Oh, kidding? Twitter didn’t even mark false Rolling Stone article misinformation, won’t anything curb Ding’s alarmist garbage.   doesn’t pal around incredibly smart people. Where's LimbRemovalBot need him? Perhaps control group drinks sugar water balance sugar/carbs 1-2 alcoholic drinks study group drinking.

Everyone thinks got vaccinated &amp; spews dumb ass shit clout Well see ok gives medical advice giggles says I'm dumbass comes stuff. proceeds speak he's expert field.  restrooms constantly packed also outdoors?  certainly go far. would say good science hard hard get money do. talking using anti-parasitic drug treat virus maybe there's good reason hard get money science there's really good reason think would actually anything.

I mean hell let's try statins, maybe statins effective covid. anti-malarials; oh wait already damn thing. 

I mean see downside looking treatments, least start ones might effect virus plausible mechanism effect virus. think anyone expressed sort mechanism ivermectin would effective covid. miss something? Filters required MEL, every time plane flies past life filter filter removed documented pre-flight MEL signoff. 

Do really think airlines skimping filter replacement COVID? 

Even were, airplanes still best air turnover rate [any environment regularly find Even air filter removed recirc still used, still getting completely new air every 4-6 minutes. 

Your typical commercial building turns outside air one every half hour. Unless Class office space, guarantee best getting MERV-8 filtration without UV sanitization basically useless stopping aerosol spread. Class A, there's maybe 50/50 chance got MERV-13+ and/or UV light treatment recirc.

I people taking safety seriously. wear N95s. makes sense you. saying relative risk basis, airplane place need double PPE. immigration line, security line, gate boarding area goggles may come handy. “Oh, shit?” says America Yeah anyone taking medical advice Joe Rogan won’t care actual scientist knows he’s talking say. last 60,000 person event NYC required vaccination, outdoors wasn’t superspreader event that’s talking about. man sells stadiums made millions dollars comedy. criticism Rogan stick. Totally! arguing masks all, simply stating children significantly low risk serious complications related covid. would anyone ever take out? definitely quackery medical professions chiros acupuncturists RNs MDs.

His goal continue keeping echo chamber open followers keep pockets lined. Hell, one vaccines even emergency use anymore  He’s interviewer. Someone says one point, discusses another discussion rather someone TED talk 2 hours.

I'm DC metro we've restrictions summer, schools actually opened 2-3 weeks ago here, level vaccination generally high end. think we're likely worst it.

We'll see areas school opened yesterday. almost certainly going surge cases that. given level vaccination think little increase hospitalization fatalities.

There pretty good data wave cresting parts country, even low levels vaccination. think gets enough attention crucial, areas 30-50% vaccination still seeing cases decline. must explanation, theory areas restrictions reaching point lot people immune exposure, like Sweden.  dummies also wear mask head too? #maskpride stated beginning second estimates based statistics three places reported detailed data Covid infections vaccination status: Utah; Virginia; King County, includes Seattle, Washington state. Sorry hear. Yeah, mother (59) vaccinated got delta variant kicked ass. Didn’t hospitalized miserable. Uncle mine, got from, vaccinated died. Albeit lifelong smoker alcoholic. 

I’m concerned children since old enough vaccine yet. This. 

It's funny seeing Reddit Redditors doom, ""shut everything down"", ""stay home"", ""we need lockdowns"", November 2020-February 2021 mode people highly vaccinated city largely (even overwhelmingly) took pandemic measures seriously back living normal lives, socializing gathering fully vaccinated friends. pandemic measure taken myself, friend group group whole mentioned wearing masks indoors non-socializing reasons.

It's honestly funny mind-blowing radical difference many Redditors regarding COVID going back lockdown mode calling lockdowns compared people took pandemic measures seriously still kind living life normally largely. 

Just another case Reddit Redditors matching general public at. data NYT using get ""estimates"" getting breakthrough infection?  don’t see it’s difficult whole classroom wear masks protect even one individual.

Yes, critical stuff probably taken seriously can't picture harried maintenance tech (who thinks covid flu) taking non-critical short cut...

You write authoritatively that's nice world clear cut as
you often proclaim. doubt done much hands maintenance. 

And high air turnover rate also means relatively high air velocities mixing. happen sitting near anti-vaxer fake vax card nose exposed loosely covered, cooties flying past faster air current / impingement protection regular eye glasses face shield reduced - hence goggles.  happen near carrier next variant- low odds? Sure still that's I'm taking extra precaution...

For me, air travel represents highest risk - work home.  thank much confidence aircraft maintenance shall spend $20 (looking like ~$10) goggles.

So here's another aspect touched - relatively low humidity / pressure airliner cabin increase decrease likelihood covid infection via lungs eyes? Honest question, know answer... Ya I've looking Bonafide. considering NIOSH Harley mask even little expensive.

I'm sure buying Amazon. sounds like right thing, isolating testing contacts.

Delta pretty shitty deal with; NZ managed guys too! think important question is: cares? frequently happen? assume often realize  Correct I'm wrong queens/Long Island considered NYC like it. law works ways, ways like.

I agree in, fact, case, found loophole... described think probably correct.

Now would like Gov. fix it... really much control whether cop going face mask not. Vaccines reason why. Majority county fully vaccinated. knew restrictions would end vaccines widely available adults. Let unvaccinated adults keep getting Covid. 3 months kids 2-11 years old access vaccinated. Michaelthecoder pretty much got intentions probably intentions upvoted. 

Its partly joking CDC insisting 3rd shots immunocompromised boosters, rather delayed part normal series. assume emphasizes immunocompromised getting people getting third shot, rather reaching gotten two shots emphases importance group getting extra shot. 

But really consider 2-doses fully vaccinated purposes controlling disease anymore (although think reasonable CDC/FDA wait clinical data saying such). long large portion population even gotten two doses, controlling spread disease important protecting them. US like countries like 80% 2-shots 90% eligible people 1 shot, boosters important. large part US point hospital breakdown, that's one politically viable solutions available. unreasonable expect someone crisis take basic steps try mitigate crisis someone else worse elsewhere. Unless time traveler, hell would know long term prognosis point. know, please share information future. Actually, yes. reading news today studies showing people covid get vaccinated kind super-immune. system able sucessfully fight even mutations better. good sign.

Joe Rogan always vector disinformation adopts narrative suits personality lets show act platform kinds unfiltered BS. take show seriously, might fine. unabashedly entertainment first. show takes seriously anything properly frame conversations they're having. 

It bad took turn. used really enjoy show, format, open talk guests. genuinely got see side people interview. Joe many many great episodes. Somewhere along way veered mess today. I'm sure still interesting episodes, point I'm done watching. ""Gondor calls aid!""

You one quibbling usage irrelevant terminology. stating lie facts debunking ivermectin. Tell people antiparasitic evidence support use covid rather bringing irrelevant terminology around horses livestock.

The fact is, Joe Rogan take horse dewormer, livestock dewormer, dog dewormer. want pedantic, took Human dewormer. accurately, took Human anti-parasitic drug. Yeah Joe fucking ivermectin cured bro, definitely monoclonal antibodies.

What get pushing bullshit narrative man. thought punched head many times he’s shit intentionally Go tell families deceased people lost sense smell (some friends still fully back year). guess that's small price pay society enjoy drinking shitty priced beer bar Östermalm...

Nearly every single libertarian (and half Republicans) I've met genuinely believes hands fiscal/tax policy create prosperity everyone.

Certainly there's survivorship bias lack comprehensive economic/social history there, genuinely believe make everyone better. That's evil, misguided good intentions. curious: vaccine have? What? guy fed horse dicks morons living doesn’t understand vaccine science? I’m shocked…Shocked!  need discussion 1st amendment limitations speech impacts public health. 

There already limits - can't defame someone example. Can't threaten murder people, etc.

A reasonable limitation want discuss things MUST provide equal time public policy experts like AMA discussing subject equal time.

Also needs REAL teeth like 10 years jail time fines percentage revenue. Yep. Sigh. Yeah, steroid abuse earn Gynecomastia.  what? tax returns?  think rare cases caused erectile disfunction issues. think might damage circulatory system. know wife minor cough pretty alarming cardiac symptoms.  You’re right, referring story &amp; social circle. doubt person’s “bubble” unlike mine though? I’m friends vast sea vaccinated like-minded liberals trust betray claiming they’re vaccinated they’re not.

My poor brother machinist &amp; works mostly (unvaccinated, irrational, conspiracy loving) trumpets. experiences whole different reality. It’s awful 😞 Looking forward JR Variant.  never said doctor knows shit say dummy. ppl listen take advice seriously? Idiots. um...Rolling Stone recent eye protection *technical* source - consider smart honest - sadly increasingly endangered...  elitist say everyone basic understanding scientific thinking scientific process. Would call elitist believe everyone ought know basic arithmetic? No, people can't function optimally modern society can't fucking add subtract shit. Science, critical thinking, greater extent, computer literacy gotten point - cannot live optimally without it, pandemic made clear. vast majority population sucks scientific thinking. That's uncomfortable truth, elitist statement. Stop coddling people. willfully ignorant literally educate free online nothing proud given pass.  He's worst. Spreading misinformation deadly. even treatment. Many people hardly get symptoms covid doesnt mean trivialise disease. lot worse many people. basic empathy. wasnt bad mean cannot imagine might worse others. Yes, 75% 70% PA's total population least one dose vaccine. Nobody talking adults willing learn. people say education answer, usually take mean ""the adults already fucked up, let's least try fix next generation adults"". Anyone still back /r/WuhanFlu, (because COVID really understood yet, suspected flu), one original doctors involved initial outbreak's dying words believes got infected eyes, hospital staff PPE must protect eyes well? 

That guy local hero time, nice see claim vindicated.  Oh mean like Lambda variant coronavirus, first identified Peru spreading South America, highly infectious resistant vaccines original version virus emerged Wuhan, China, Japanese researchers Social media. It’s social media.

When 9/11 happened almost entire country united maybe 5-10% thinking government conspiracy shit.

With covid, social media turned 5% 30%. It’s really simple. Good, want vaccinated wasted idiots likely die covid anyway. what? libertarian UFC douche isnt giving good medical advice!?!?!?! One thing consider: regeneron nearly available vaccine -- cheap. cheap either: $1500 per dose, cost direct consumer, vary based insurance. also simple shot, IV infusion. could definitely cost clinic time. I'm still skeptical claims outside china mid december.  see sub in, though think ""purely political"" stretch, say RW I'm gonna argue, bad! study small done delta.

Which suggests March-June time frame, vaccinations (for 65+ widely available) Delta became primary concern. I'd like see similar results June-August. Better lift knuckles floor google ""how understand studies"" something. Man, fuck Forbes.com. site ad-cancer steroids. Hope symptoms stay mild go away quickly. worth, natural vaccine-induced immunity supposedly really protective, good shape get lingering symptoms. world ours, half evil. literally Trump did. Tucker Carlson lawyer response.

To paraphrase 'no rational person would consider Tucker says factual news, he's opinion show host. Therefore he's responsible repercussions anything says'

I agree that. think moral obligations misinform, especially comes public health crisis' Joe Rogan Goop men. wonder come this? problem medical research testing females enough. Honestly, got vaccine period change. guess good cover bases though. 🤷‍♀️ He's con man looking sucker audience money. he's utter ignoramus. Probably both. OK, maybe Farva. nothing.

It looked like hundred cases testing availability. cat bag long time anyone even knew country. Medical workers national guard, think things non medical workers could lighten load. Anyone could call around hospitals seeing bed available. wouldn’t flipping people bellies (proning) physical strength medical knowledge?    Joe Rogan fucking idiot Raging Elk .........that joke, threat. I'm even fan, happened catch saying I'm telling would nearly impossible genuinely misinterpret threat. bet could wave wand get number doses administered 99.5% doses gone livestock America.  Cases hospitalizations Israel nowhere near levels last winter. appear already peaked started decline.

80% eligible population still leaves 20% get sick. foremost problem social media exists diet nonstop infotainment. There's much put still scientifically worthwhile. Meanwhile Joe Rogan churn crap nonstop there's limit fiction.   tactic, give lots advice expect impact change peoples mind ever get called point boilerplate ""oh dumbass, listen me"". Fuck Joe Rogan. He's fucking hack. he’s amateur professional. 🤦‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️ Anti vaxxers read say “see, it’s vaccinated killing everyone” wrong, feeling states spokespeople constantly saying one two things ""We capacity soon"" - think might mean ran capacity weeks ago lack nurse staffing, speculation. 

The thing hear lot ""If anything we'll trouble"", rarely ""We're serious trouble, overrun"".  

I think hospitals doctors want play politics image ""we'll handle anything"" whereas fact, not, not. People die, dying, triage full ERs. would stick message instead ""in 1-2 weeks we'll trouble"". Sounds exactly like someone would say getting completely right. Hmm... Curious!  told immunocompromised wife's sake. seems fall category ""also Covid side effect"". several friends caught Covid said messed cycle several friends said vaccine messed cycle. guess end putting category myocarditis cases (possible vaccination also happens even actual infection).

I'm obviously one woman triple Pfizered issues here. Joe Rogan know shit, feels like half people thread know shit either. Biden: lol k  think distinction matters, ivermectin appropriate treatment COVID-19  Wow be? I'm shocked. true might wrong topics too.   never MMA fighter. Absolutely shocking... Joe Rogan neolithic troglodyte. He's reason. 

Your brother dumbshit Joe's fault. news, sun rose morning  Would also say peeing public pool personal choice? I’m trying change minds, point nothing will.  It’s pedantic correct someone saying guy never competed mma mma fighter.  That’s people presume mean.  knows several disciplines commentator fighter.  Fully agree, clear desperately want get vaccinated.  
My point I'm changing lifestyle much (and quite bit) based national/state vaccination transmission rates. 

As in, state may high level transmission medium level vaccination, county direct contacts low rates high vaccination. such, I'm willing play outdoor soccer lived different county/city. Even he'd give platform people deserve it, never call wrong. 

Dude grifter. I'm going go limb say worry, unless highly contagious environment, like covid ward something. couple decades period we're in, marked rise internet, long studied future historians time humanity took significant intellectual step backwards. 

Joe Rogan typical case study, one millions. stupid person found forum spout nonsense online, heard millions people. nonsense infectious. plague. people become stupider. Multiple example million, Facebook, Fox News, on. 30 years ago, stupid people voice, local barber shop, street corner, rambling letter editor local newspaper. Now, they're *everywhere*.  wear mask unless required. I've fully vaccinated since April. Mostly, yes, really try neutral ad hominem stuff. Although, definitely otherwise reasonably intelligent people that, whatever reason either inundated misinformation bother try cut noise.  


But yeah, mostly idiots. time.

He definitely isn't, ever be. Hawaii even bigger difference 75% first dose 56% fully vaxxed. Illinois 66% first dose 52% fully vaxxed. 

As far PA goes, like month ago article posted lot people apparently missed second shot, PA’s second dose data tracking also hasn’t good, like I’ve heard people double dosed state still reports single dose etc. 

Nevertheless, PA’s second dose rate actually climbing now, good thing. man, break simple fucking goal posts keep getting moved. Im critical care nurse Ive explained every layer immune system, anti bodies, immunity, mRNA vaccines development years theyve studying corona virus since last sar-cov1 outbreak vaccine completely safe still NURSES think vaccine cause autism children.

Unfortunately choice vaccinate little education becomes political. becomes emotional decision. It’s telling 35 yr old father three left behind three children whose wife currently icu covid well. People likely get vaccinated based anecdotal reports evidence community data scientific facts world. Fully agree, clear desperately want get vaccinated. 

My point I'm changing lifestyle much (and quite bit) based national/state vaccination transmission rates. in, state may high level transmission medium level vaccination, county direct contacts low rates high vaccination. such, I'm willing play outdoor soccer lived different county/city. catch slippin' usually far East knowledge ( Traditional Chinese Medicine Ayurveda)

Shortness breath means needs seek medical attention rule myocarditis. panic, mostly precaution.   Rogan best actively sought professionals understood subject better did. Nowadays seeks doctors/studies confirm whatever already believes, even odds medical community's general consensus.

""9 10 doctors agree"" Joe invite 1 doctor show.

Add he's surrounded podcast guests afraid disagree fear retribution Joe's rabid fanbase Joe himself. basically happening. Friend mine TX kept kicking road getting vaccinated, blame specifically feel bad they're antivax issues fears never got shot it. he's home sick covid went ER given meds turned away told basically come back things get worse.

That tagline podcast. Fringe topics he’s popular. Hey-aaaaaaAAAAHHH!

Fixed  post locked due off-topic discussion per Rule 8 r/Coronavirus. Please remember keep discussion focused COVID-19 - off-topic political discussions better suited subs. Thank understanding. Guys listen doctors, get hard is. Hear out, topless women muscular men speedos providing accurate scientific news?  Get shot die. Seems simple. show entertaining interested guest. like MMA, might like episodes featuring MMA figures. like certain movie, might like episode featuring actor author, etc. gotcha, cant even begin understand collective trauma things like tuskeegee experiments people. 


so...honestly im gonna touch 10 ft pole. 


nice username, btw. got pretty lucky vaccine man

*So far*...I work people already saying they're getting boosters. :( saw people reacted thought toilet paper going run out, right? Imagine said ""masks work shortage, please save professionals"". People would going around raiding supply trucks every nurse/doctor country would dead  I'm reading book building business tips tricks standing crowd.

Rogan utilizing ""Be passionate one sided subject, matter what's right wrong"" trick.

He'll lose fans vaccination science side he'll gain hell lot anti-vax, religious, conservative sides.

He's already made money Spotify, he's showing true colors hot headed, macho man instead seeing sides coin asking questions like days old.

Here's hoping Spotify reconsiders contract falls spectrum. services blocking misinformation, Spotify step too. let him. tried post response CNN's covering ivermercin use, naturally removed moderators:

Joe Rogan CNN's covering ivermectin use: ""They're making sh\*t dipshit Michael Osterholm Nicholas Christakis show, explaining great detail answers questions. Instead, listens Alex Jones Jocko. fucking idiot. it, guys!!! don’t?? M. Carvalho, superintendent Miami-Dade County Public Schools, said Tuesday employees died covid-19 year unvaccinated.

There go. Get vaccinated, die. Even underlined. It’s always cringeworthy starts ranting solid work ethic comes writing comedy.

About people don’t understand amount time dedication takes get “our level”, he’s sitting discussing top echelon level stand ups like Chapelle Prior etc.

He’s commentator podcaster. pretty damn good, least last years, those. stand not, yet seems convinced he’s one greatest ever lived. ""That good guy, Joe Rogan! He's telling people take drug doctors write prescription they're resorting taking doses meant livestock! Way stick Fauci, Joe!""   ""Mission accomplished""  Even pandemic, lot nurses treated. Underpaid overworked undervalued.  think took 6er leinenkugels handle fireball they? Mine painful 😖 Imagine that. guy played pretty convincing idiot Newsradio is, fact, idiot. Rogan literally says himself. affected second dose Pfizer. finished period week before, came two days second dose. |: 

For record, always incredibly regular entire menstruating life. weeks early something that’s happened before.

It happened back normal. strong reaction dose 2 knocked ass 4 days, figured stress body kicked period starting early. And, didn’t, what?  Joe one stoned Gen Xer says dumb things occasionally says something smart. one times. Although, seems good medical advice times.   thing Rogan actually qualified speak *MAYBE* MMA Combat Sports. 

Taking medical advice dumbest fucking thing.

And I've said I'll say - Rogan actually terrible podcast host. gets pretty decent guests audience, audience early adopter put lot effort podcasts many podcast options. 

That's pretty much it. interviewer he's pretty terrible, especially considering big names gets number episodes he's done. can't think single person done job long - seems enjoy - still bad it. ask, bring wheel sauna going kill covid? drink horse water. Horses drink toilet water. People really dumb, accurately overestimate smart humans are.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  No, Joe wrong. Maybe need reread article. addressed “leaking” pretty thoroughly.

To paraphrase, said vaccine 100%, know Covid vaccine slow transmission thus slowing evolution, possible transmission mutations vaccinated far surpassed mutating occurring within rampant spreading among unvaccinated people, lastly - 40+ years vaccinating chickens, learned slowing transmission way slow mutations, accomplished vaccination.


Also, referring *first* generation chicken vaccine, one they’ve updated every 10 years keep effective. He's stand comedian 20 years. netflix specials tours around time. think understand term ""medical advice"" means. seems like think means advice medical nature. Medical advice specific term generally given ""doctor-patient"" relationship. thinking personal advice medical information. Professional fields specific terms place protection client's protection. ""mechanic"" fall ""professional field."" Well didn’t change world go.  people really dumb enabling someone like Joe calling idiot blaming people listen harm good.

And yet, letting dumb people dumb shit probably good harm reeeaaaalllllly long term.  think saying here. fully vaxxed little risk serious outcomes,

I suggest read recent literature median antibody level generate Moderna. Get back happily consider conversation. Please look true risks would sacrificing see them.

I already one COVID funeral. know risks. Seems like societal problem I'm trying stop calling people stupid comments like make hard. Ah shit happened Ben Bailey? He's head mouthbreather charge broclub quite time. new.  show is, MLM insecure ""alphas"". rule thumb, someone hired moderate comments, comments. shock voice penny dropped someone bullshitting sauna treatment telling.  advice matter? Southern ""Politeness"" myth worst contingent color church go best. Joe Rogan fuckin monkey. parrot hes currently with, hes left devices flings logical poo walls thinks “look expert too”


Hes spent long talking intelligent people hes mistakenly begun believe one. lot people decided doctors corrupt pharmaceutical industry. media controlled state propaganda. free thinkers experts podcasts YouTube.

A lack knowledge information leaves gaps fill fear paranoia. disagree. way ‘bad guys’ (anyone interested propagating lies) use PR advantage. exactly what’s happening. 

If uneducated populace that’s responsive *any* PR, we, society trouble.

The solution ‘better PR’, it’s better education everyone. Joe Rogan worth hundreds millions real job decades.

&amp;#x200B;

Why hell anyone care say? know he's wildly disconnected reality people live, right? think New York too. Bet covid balloon year. like show, honestly believe ego gotten best thing. They're big state, that's gonna ba-

*checks state population last census*

Oh **god**. vaccine research good. research women's health also good sorely needed Depends stupidity level kid. 

My 1 yo high stupidity scale jumps couches, runs around crashing everything tries eat rocks. 3 yo scared everything. Based sound logic, 1 yo likely go hospital due accident vs Covid comparison 3yo. everything I've able put together horse de-wormer correct, Rogan may facing, permanent blindness/blurred, organ failure, specifically kidneys liver leading death, COVID become pneumonia, right? missing anything? lot topics hard. 

That doesn’t mean discouraged deterred thinking talking them.

Discourse good society...The owner research make reaction video YouTube actually giving logical rebuttal. People would watch. 

I get point guess thing Joe Rogan going share opinions add disclaimers state end alls followers. He'd extraordinarily stupid understand massive platform influence has, whole ""I'm dumbass haha"" schtick really lazy cop-out avoid accountability case says something stupid. Yes are. Tell one source says without ""not living organism"" BS.  I'm unfamiliar him. guy reference meme comments obscure hallucinogenic drugs see around reddit? know start statement fucking stupid Yep agree I’m boat. make T-shirt.   Tulsi Gabbard year. guy self proclaimed liberal openly stated going vote Democrat Biden nomination. guy literally right here. He’s damn podcaster who’s turned benevolent leader people don’t even listen him.  Thanks reply. ""Joe Rogan wrong"", obvious news 3. Lmao. job isnt inform, job entertain. US vaccine database maintained state level. California New York QR code. sure elsewhere. think New York app California separate app though upload Google Apple wallets. Vegan here, reporting duty. 🧐 Yeah valid point, especially health conditions IUD. Telling woman wait potentially months get vaccine probably best approach hindsight vaccine hesitant people fact many women (including myself) would've gotten vaccine ASAP anyway. would good understand may get bleeding randomly get vaccine something similar though also going assume airliner air filter maintenance variable...

You work much airline maintenance you? Maintenance incredibly regimented. air pressurization system flight safety critical (although technically MEL'd flight plan stays 10K, feasible flights doubles fuel consumption) strict maintenance requirements. Alabama couldn’t close borders even wanted to. 

Frankly whole form government practically antithetical zero-case pandemic response. Remember constitution written 100 years modern germ theory came about. Joe Rogan never took blows head living.

He involved amateur taekwondo, couple amateur kickboxing matches, practiced brazilian jiujitsu recreationally.   Start using bullshit them.

""I want monoclonal therapy know what's it."" ask question ""what's it?"" head explode.  Ummm still listening who? (World health is, band) mean really provided us useful guidance? Yeah that’s reports showing, ideally get 2/3 country vaccinated mutations wouldn’t result severe consequences. keep wondering many people aren’t taking seriously spite evidence reported tragedies. someone tries pay attention health, I’m always interested considered “moderate” drinking studies. 

I’m study, defined moderate monkeys kept BAC 0.04%, maybe equivalent 1-2 drinks human.  can’t figure *often* monkeys drinking.  drink every couple hours day, getting 0.04% day?

Also, seems weird “no drinking” control group given sugar water, instead water. wonder there’s case made “moderate” alcohol consumption better sugary drinks. 

Don’t get wrong, would much *like* moderate alcohol consumption good health, overwhelming scientific consensus less better comes alcohol. hope convince brother take vaccine. two cousins dearest aunt passed away yesterday covid. vaccinated. I'd crying angry time. Please convince brother take it. people crying lmao dude can't believe I'm waking this. country done dude. get vaccinated? ItSa tAcTIc  Cro Magnon survived 30000 years. he's running show make another 50.  “Joe Rohan getting completely wrong,” expert topic Joe Rohan discusses.  that's cover ass supporters take advice eat Tide Pods kill Covid.  See this? exactly we'll never get control. country pretty much decided pandemic months ago. Freedom speech doesn’t mean words falling Rogan’s mouth well-informed incapable causing harm. 

Just freedom speech doesn’t mean u/oposse *have* appreciate whatever misinformation spreading. mean, that’s correct pronunciation. almost went cat joke, thought funnier.  fair, Joe never took blows head living. free shit  ""He's getting answers earpiece. He's smart!""  get people cling Joe's every word (love dislike him) realize main goal entertain. watch show mainly guests hear 'average Joe' take popular things going on. take word says he's scientist he's giving perspective information he's seen.

How people even maintain friendships believe agree someone every single point discussion. Thing never professional fighter capacity. competed US Open champion taekwondo tournament 19. acts like tough guy saying immune system take care covid soon gets takes every pill medicine cabinet well Ivermectin. proclaims Ivermectin worked hes fine now. would bet house would felt better amount time taken it.

He hides behind phrase ""I'm comedian would listen medical advice?"" seems unaware statements likely led people dying Covid.

Water weed dune hair bapa?  Lol fat redditors always mad rogan ""Joe Rogan getting completely wrong"" Says

literally everyone every subject besides MMA. Yep .. noone gives shit anymore lol. 8 days ICU November arguing get Moderna shots available age group made superhuman?

Im Goku now. He's starting fear life without followers hanging every word looks like. Yeah disagree that. I'm saying disingenuous use dad brother's quick recovery evidence vaccines working. anecdotal, account factors like age health. plenty solid evidence efficacy vaccines, using anecdotal evidence like pointless basic science point, everyone vaccinated one less variable (non vaccinated people) probably protection.

I think maybe skeptical, it’s good skeptical things vaccines medicine pretty solid science. 

Biology hard that’s people like Joe business commenting it, unless allow researcher time answer question forum. watchers get corrected information don’t walk around misrepresented data minds.  struggle child TK means go school next year. make go giving social interaction risk new infant brother older mil keep home undeveloped home? Nothing says risks blindly judge let start calculations get back *Beep boop beep boop beep* true. dunno, even good parents kids go astray. grandparents great-- raised uncles kind, functional human beings. mom always bit... touched. 

Rogan part bad science crew helping spread misinformation YEARS.  Would love know affects long vaccine's effectiveness lasts. COVID get vaccinated, protected longer 5-8 months they're mentioning now? Yeah, stopped following Rogan 9mths ago. friend told shining uv light throat going kill corona.  knew would easy tho. Wang Guanfa[Chinese expert came Wuhan coronavirus saying controllable thinks infected  Ah shit, somehow antivaxxers use reason get now.  imagine long term people get used become less dangerous adapt species. 

However I'm afraid anti-any-solution people make worse happens. fear virus, fear people like react it. Honestly think Joe Rogan type person. podcast (and comedy) really public presence, leads otherwise private life seems like way.

I think sees kind ""truthseeker"" ""curious mind"" years bias become wack he's failed recognize guests usually polite directly call nonsense.  207.5M single dose don’t really see terribly significant. 

Let’s say we’re 4 million received unauthorized booster, that’s (4/207.5)*100 ~= 2%

So, drop headline 75% 73%, I’m still impressed.  hospitals absolutely swamped now. 75% people vaccinated, it’s pandemic unvaccinated. hate talk this, you’re seen anti vaxxer, shushed fear might prevent vaccine hesitant people getting vaccinated. Getting vaccine makes odds covid better everyone get it. Recognizing vaccines don’t work well we’d hoped delta still need careful, wear masks, could possibly get sick die even vaccinated anti-vaccine. 

In example, 1/135 people who’ve breakthrough case covid died it. 
From article: given getting breakthrough cases lot common thought, isn’t pandemic unvaccinated. Basically masks still extremely important protecting death covid, cannot rely fact vaccinated. Still vaccination important also, odds even worse you’re unvaccinated. articles like start popping know we’re near peak (of wave) fear baked market. wave ends growth takes toward Christmas everyone visits families sat holidays last year….profits soar market follow. Buy 5%+ dip get 5-10yr demographic set American economy drives global growth positive. scheduled get second dose Friday recently surgery couldn’t get out. planning getting today recently exposed. symptoms 10 days getting second dose? Maybe laziness areas life stems lack motivation, case apathetic seem like good word. motivated get vaccine obvious reasons. certainly appeared chance apparent much asymptomatic transmission much pre-symptomatic transmission virus causes. Prior that, still appeared window incredibly strong quarantine measures contact tracing + testing could find us way zero COVID.

Now likely eradicated way eradicated smallpox.  Sheesh “This life on, waves,” said.

Um ok. guy's got hell crystal ball. scoring means chose vaccinate want to.

Vaccination, age, stuff. source, please? could significant problem. anyone think going away?? think kinda figured that. things going NYC? I’m sorry city got hit brutally hard 2020. study Molecular Biology Biochemistry 100% correct point everyone exposed SARS-COV-2 result milder infections follow primed immune systems. 

Unless spike protein changes widely, unlikely spike protein must still fit ACE2 receptor, antibodies might less effective. vaccines booster shots game changer. Look 90% patients hospital vaccine. 

With time herd immunity COVID become milder disease. unlikely antibodies won’t respond new SARS-COV-2 strains many mutations spike protein handle without loss function. agree, current delta strain viral load 300 times original strain, also reaches lungs quickly pneumonia common. absolutely indication starting mutate less deadly variant. heard old people co-morbodities struggling covid unvaccinated fit, even never know. 
Unlike flu, covid significant incubation period matter mutates deadly variant kills hosts, it'll still spread host dies. sounds like liberal version conservatives get vaccine take weird anti-parasite medications. little troubled hospitalizations vaccinated people 20% range. seems higher places.

But umbrella metaphor still works here: might still get little wet carrying umbrella rain, definitely still want umbrella. Well, yes, prognosis based previous data viruses, pandemics, etc. new election bill signed, he's hoping voter access marginalized communities restricted enough matter

Edit: [Added USA Today story Idaho lowest % vaccines given. Even lower Mississippi (who seem motivated last wave get vaccinated). Even parents nut jobs sacrifice health safety political obsessions.  schools, area least, strongly recommending students get vaccine, outright requiring it. Jesus that's scary. Luckily daughter turned 18 beginning year able get vaccinations time. also vaccinated yeah understand line thinking honestly. Something like pandemic binary answer. simple shaming blaming portion people unvaccinated vaccine even provide sterilizing immunity.... think world ready transmissible virus deadly certain portion population.  Government pays, people job right now. saying day one. Mathematically, expect viruses high spread low lethality win time.

But mean cannot both, higher lethality high spread. thing Ebola like lethality, lets hypothesize twice hospitalization like studies shown 2x, 3x... contagious get much death. tweaking little bit algorithm get much deadly virus. friend 40s (othereise healthy) covid Feb. still enlarged heart lung scaring. Unfortunately way convince people. That's well good people actually get vaccinated, tactic simply work places lot vaccine hesitancy. way get place responsibly remove restrictions high vaccination rates. Otherwise end like certain states US, worse.   statistics take account single dose j&amp;j vaccine? Like people grouped first shot people second shot people? People tired.

Absolutely exhausted constantly pander people despite shown time time wrong continue persist.

It’s hard feel sympathy people willingly choose put position cheer every single effort stop measures would help.

I’m empathic person, honestly believed showed people evidence, put there; eventually they’d come around.

COVID broken regard. don’t condone person saying……but understand it.  problem taking animal dewormer. take compounds intended livestock dose.

If prescribed physician, that's different. top this, real treatment method covid either. I'm sure believe argue along lines, I'm going waste time engaging pointless debate reddit. is. problem till hits someone know. Right. Unless happen celebrity. politician. sports star. it’s pretty much guaranteed I’m sure nothing fact people paying attention 👎🏻  Part reason think I'm going children can't bear think raising world like this. least new normal warped ceaseless spew Russo-Trumpian bullshit  cruelty?

Right, right. It’s bug; it’s feature you’re Republican days. reason would lot *most* advantageous contagiousness mutations remove asymptomatic transmission. COVID already airborne virus respiratory system, mutation results sneezing coughing early infection possible would quickly become dominant strain. would also put pressure virus become less severe.

It's like mutation simple anything, answer ""I see why"" aspect.  Yeah totally there's vaccine resistant smallpox polio strains ravaging communities. Whenever spell reassuring stats like *for vaccinated only*, without giving equivalent unvaccinated, red flag something least somewhat misleading.

If assume 80% efficacy symptomatic infection Delta, unvaccinated person 1 1000 per day risk getting infected, 69% chance avoiding infection year. would never spell NYTimes article. literally opposite article says. 1 5,000 1 10,000 depending are. in-laws constantly throw Mexico, India Africa (yup whole mess countries there) examples Vitamins, Ivermectin, Hydroquinone, Zarthramyacine, zinc.. treatments turned things around. mother laws sister lived Kenya 35 years us visiting saying things. 

Then spew garbage cannot donate blood spike protein injections immunocompromised. 

A quick Google see false.

Crazy crazy crazy times. Finally taking seriously eh? buddy young lazy “friends” convincing get one. Mad lad actually sent photo vaccination card hour later. 

I said “Look, mate, would rather sore arm day risk ending ICU tube throat?”. super hesitant something.  Austin chiming in. Applying jobs basically anywhere else. incorrect. pointed many times, long incubation period symptoms start gives virus time spread kills (if worst cases). means evolutionary pressure become less deadly. 
Also, OG strain less deadly, compared Delta Alpha well. great analysis kind sad posted 14 part Twitter thread. really wish people would read things like scientific papers even web sites. amount ‘Darwinist’ arguments best evidence anti-vaxxers innate difference intelligence. They’re products environment, lot vaxxed people lucky live better one. Delta less deadly, according sources trust get info from. contagious. Wow virus worldwide likely stay? shit!  coming say known since May 2020? ever get point seasonal like flu/cold/stomach bug? know things go around year technically, get much worse winter. year-round COVID freakout shit mentally exhausting largely people given preventative measures. need summer vacation order mentally healthy. 

I fully expected COVID us forever form fact rebounded summer actually got WORSE last winter height threw loop. think live like forever. “Clearly vastly dangerous vaccine” 

And know how? think chances breakthrough infection certainly higher we’re led believe clearly they’re job keeping people hospital dying.

I live Alabama vaccination rates abysmal local numbers [speak thinks COVID safety protocols unpopular really are.

They really unpopular among base, far right Republicans. They're ones vote primaries, re-connect them, pissed earlier mandates  least enough people get slows crawl/annual vaccine. 

It go like forever, wonder there's threshold go, ""this normal""? normal future? sure.  difficult think best approach discussion vaccination would via street epistemology (search YouTube).

It much complicated reciting facts people. 

Also recommend podcast smart episodes 213 209.

Credit resources belongs redditor. remember saw it. Thank you. story behind name it’s funny sounds. Actually married don’t know like 15 years something. Covid conscious surely got shot feel comfortable go get burger that's exactly is. 

The ""team mentality"" modern politics makes Primary lead bat shit people getting office. areas data sources distinguish vaccinated unvaccinated, previous infections, do. track show rates illness, hospitalization death around 8-10 times higher unvaccinated.

My home state Virginia bang hope make sort difference, whatever dedicating life raise kids better human beings me. plus side looks like vaccinated drastically reduces risk long covid. possible boosters mRNA fairly closely analogous actually getting flu, however ironic is.  would panic, even worry. Kids little risk virus. Good news gets better she'll likely immune. Good luck.  Coworker mine anti Vax. work 2 months since catching covid. care he's truly good man, coming. india reached 50% think prone magical thinking already accept beliefs proof require unexamined ""faith"" certain conclusion. go intuition listen people think way thinking. fall neither category. immense fear anything medically related. I’ve anaphylaxis double pneumonia experiences fueled  health anxiety. cannot step foot doctors office without severe panic. can’t even take antibiotic without looking negatives seem always outweigh positives. know vaccine good need get misinformation read fuels fire. know covid awful real don’t want catch knows could end dead hospital. also end severe allergic reactions dead shot too. it’s double edge sword. Hard everyone understand I’m saying think I’m bozo. That’s reality people severe health anxiety. I’m 26 makes world difference. walked Walmart listened woman arguing pharmacy worker vaccine safety asking fill card required job. worker calmly replied stood listened 10 minutes went back forth woman finally caved.

It gave hope even spite woman's protests bosses put necessary pressure help rest society. That's true. virus still major damage despite significantly increased treatments we've learned since last year, thanks pointing out.

I've utterly stunned effective masks eliminating flu covid still rages on.    midst summer peak school started 1st week August. seems opening schools required weekly testing actually reduced overall spread here. typical southern states minus Florida surprisingly 5% behind California companies manufacturers currently prioritizing COVID vaccine products? sustainable continue type laser focus? 

Genuinely asking. keep without sacrificing medical products, production development, that’s fantastic. found office 100 employees less 25% vaccinated. there's nothing say convince single one good idea. total # got shot natural immunity? Great news! Chrome dinosaur? dustbowl crises sparked creation Department Agriculture would assume would spark creation American National Heath device. keep forgetting country really doesn’t give shit population.   Yes quite possible. long virus keep reproducing host dies, there's necessarily evolutionary pressure make less deadly. going impression early days news read virus coming China, seemed take young, heathy people higher rate (I thought) we're still seeing today. course ethics plays role here. 

You're assuming guy selfish asshole not, say, trying maintain income. Lots Vietnamese rely grey market/small market hustles make ends meet. 

It's funny we're assuming authoritarian regime necessarily acting good faith individual asshole. 

What broken rules nobody gotten sick, would okay then? broken rules gotten someone sick anyway?

Yes, ethics matter this. Especially since virus endemic never going away, gotta understand ethics pretty soon. think imprisoning people certain contexts ethically correct fine. viruses? get son Covid test today, dental procedure later week. talking scheduler boosters asked wanted get one today. literally appointment hour get it. called back make sure it’s “ok” get it, vaxxed April, again, said yes. (Mid 30’s, Ohio, immune compromised wife). thought this, think handled also contribution severity first wave's issues. know medicine throw it, convalescent plasma therapy, lot (still do) idiotic therapies (horse dewormer hydro-whatever-not-workin). Hospitals know put steroids less, none all. Mask? mask? much confusion.

Sadly know much lot folks refuse listen partly due politics partly used doctors knowing do. got paranoia going.  I'm angry right now. We've done everything supposed do. vaccinated. wore masks. stayed home. child showing symptoms got call school saying someone class tested positive. worn mask every day still symptoms.

I know.. could kept home homeschooled. goes tiny private school fewer 400 kids 13 grades. basically child (her sister adult live here) mental health suffering. hot spot liberal area. hard decision make, apparently chose wrong.   polls early process showed 65-70% going flatline, people said simply take it, probably amount convincing going good.

At point stop accommodating people everyone chance get vaccine need move on. can't held back people deal consequences. problem anti-precaution crowd generously 15% population. word ""FACT"" even mean? wish made feel better county still less 30 percent one dose, 25 fully vaccinated. frustrating. got first shot recently, single breakthrough event made finally get it. ever opposed idea getting eventually, wanted see affected people give time reveal short term morbidities presenting right away.

Between anecdotal stories people knew gotten data becoming available online, plus Delta coming along causing huge spikes numbers again, realized sure ever gonna ""safe"". going gain anything continuing wait prolonging risk catching old fashioned way.

For worth, work home kept exposure outside world limited couple trips grocery store week wore mask everytime went (and still do). forgot kuskogee whatever reason Latinx giving create body mutations spread

If ""more"", mean ""less"", sure. R0???

Shouldn't RT? don’t know parasite you? Winter always scary time vulnerable population. Weather hazards, cold general, increases risks stroke, risks serious bouts flu, mainly sun helps assist immunity systems fighting viruses, radical temperature changes bodies contribute shock.


Considering vast majority deaths include comorbities, winter always dangerous time people covid 19. also suspect cold means indoor activities opposed outdoor, may make spread lot worse, well. 

Plus, things like coughing natural cold weather, such, easier spread virus even asymptomatic reacting weather.


There lots reasons flu hits hardest winter. Since operate similar fashion, brainer would occur covid 19. Well things considered - would still love pandemic haha. Thanks asking, hope you. I've seen pretty bad sea lioning here. ""dude engages professor ten minutes prove point rest class roll fucking eyes"" level mean masks social distancing. Getting Covid infection inevitability. This. Exposed mean 2% chance die. There's data stuff, understand anyone trying argue point. got sick immune system prepared, sounds like fucked didn't.   Person live COVID. got tested Thursday tested positive. That's got rapid test day, symptoms. would assume days prior. Except Delta worse original, Lambda Mu coming. covid's forever means masks distancing staying home forever. even got people get multiple times. means new booster shots every months spite fact still get sick spread die anyway. stayed home wore masks, kept distance, got vaccinated soon could. everything right, never get live normal life again. choose believe. Personally, less fear since I've vaccinated. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

I’m point ignoring type reporting needed, cuts right bullshit. You’re reading much headline, they’re saying would mutate viruses mutate, mutate *rate* flu.

Further covid may lower mutation rate, it’s infecting1000x people flu, well chances rate mutates increase

Additionally article sourced saying opposite saying, they’re wrong study looking function two viruses, they’re accounting many people COVID infecting vs flu.  LoL  True, [other   This! horrified Dec. 2019 first heard spreading.I knew would make China moment. Also keep mind even *physically* beds doesn’t mean enough people staffed take care said bed. dunno, flu still fucks us yearly. that's per day, 3.5-7 percent chance next year. people call high, that's definitely opposite high either. CDC card worked fine me, including parts Spain already requiring proof vaccination travel. Conveniently, CDC card also Spanish. 

But agree something like vaccine card everybody makes sense standardization. train filled FREEDOM, though, amIright!?! Coronaviruses SARS-1 MERS wasn’t case. Likely deadly.  New Zealand great well way eliminating delta. Wtf talking about?  don’t care.   Yeah they’ve done excellent job, vaccinations impressive past weeks. Hey man, whatever takes. bad delta you? okay? really idea get deaths manageable levels people brush another statistic. Fuckin deal. FWIW science isn’t really something one believes in, science stuff prove, belief stuff can’t prove. ^(so basically get yearly vaccine like flu shots people want get sick right??)

Hoping superhuman immunity now, come variants XD

JK stay away variants I'm keeping mask wonder inevitability everyone eventually positive coronavirus point lives, either without symptoms. Covid vaccine misinformation. Pfizer full approval 16+ still emergency use authorization 12-15 year olds didn’t full year data yet (children trials started later) another possible grain truth could warped. Even new Zealand. Yes less. still reappears None matters people vaccinated.  allergies — specifically ingredients vaccine? I’m pretty sure that’s likely reason one would go anaphylactic shock.

Holy shit that’s terrifying No. states do. states database gets record provider (clinic, hospitals pharmacies) administered shots. states issue QR code based records, essentially digital version vaccine cards also given you. problem QR code it’s one way validation system. like paper card, whoever wants verify it, can’t. state gives record individual requesting it. good example bank/debit card transaction. swipe card pay $1000 purchase. Merchant connects bank inquire verify account enough pay amount. Bank gives thumbs up, transaction cleared. QR code, merchant allowed connect bank verify. bank basically says worries trust debit card holder since issued card. many flaws gaps US current system it’s crazy. Even provider submits record state, mistakes. pharmacist wrote wrong info, state record shows missing doses wrong name. order correct it, take picture vaccination card 🙄. could photoshop image anything.
I can’t see international travel ever normal without worldwide effort. can’t imagine landing Chang Mai giving vaccine paper card, expecting know trust Walgreens is. FYI Walgreens big pharmacy chain states, also act market. vaccine paper card handwritten info like name vaccine, lot number, name, birthdate, shot given (Walgreens) store number.

Yup. Influenza A. actually around time covid starting up. Got tested found out. gotten flu vaccine bed two weeks. true. Adding this. Inconclusive definitely isn’t common result. Like mentioned above, it’s likely pre-analytical issue collection transport/storage. human DNA referenced above, addition detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, called internal control. fails multiple times testing, means collection wasn’t correct, interfering substance, sort enzyme got chewed DNA/RNA (this refrigerate samples, prevent enzymatic breakdown). internal control failures aren’t cause inconclusive results, list issues quite long test/instrument dependent. isn’t medical advice inconclusive equivalent “presumptive positive” 1 2 SARS-CoV-2 targets detected.

Even everyone handled one utopian level somehow prevented mutation 100% vaccine rate/eradicated it, would next one sooner later. 


I one eagerly awaiting seasonal mRNA flu/covid combo shot. 1970, U.S. spent $2000 per person nationwide healthcare... 2019 dollars.

In 2019, U.S. spent $11,500 per person nationwide healthcare, 2019 dollars.

So investing money healthcare systems time. U.S. spends money per person healthcare country world.  priority remain power, matter what. Hey, warned. Maybe muppets employed OAN, Faux, ..still.. vaccine vaccinate unvaccinated. person, prison?? Ah see, idea distinctly remember told we’d lock two weeks, it’ll easter, election. Let Delta die down, wonder Mu start taking hold. Exposure viral load primary factors developing COVID. exposed work laboring environment kinda makes sense.

Also possible immunity wanes past 6+ months observed elrderly sick far. Young healthy population still holding relatively okay.

Answering question though, 'rare' sense found percentile people get infected vaccinated. impossible uncommon. 

As \*fully\* vaccinated population continues grow, vaccinated breakthrough cases simply there's people happen. matters actually number hospital ocuppancy vaccinated vs unvaccinated. already 95% unvaccinated people. 

Regardless, fact symptoms mild (i.e. hospitalized) great news shows body defended virus well.

Hope get better soon.  Dewormer work Shenanigans  got breakthrough infection. Wife fully vaccinated. Daughter bright Covid hint school one week. healthcare workers burning out, getting sick dying places like TN? It’s pertinent nurses doctors walking away hospitals places. I’m glad wife didn’t deal wave wave overloaded ICUs sick patients.

Almost everyone works desk jobs office (engineers, finance, customer service, etc.) vaccinated. go factory floor talk techs completely different story. Um…..you realize admitted airborne right?

I've looking statistics on, say, vaccinated individual positive individual live house, odds breakthrough there? doctors/nurses? room symptomatic person hour?

Statistically, breakthroughs definitely rare, increasingly unlikely encounter symptomatic COVID patient. do?

Anecdotally seems like there's ton prevention there. Entire vaccinated families getting sick, vaccinated couples getting sick, vaccinated nurses getting sick. Basically situation repeated, prolonged exposure seems (anecdotally) like sheer viral load consistently competing vaccine.

We'll see though. shit Sherlock remember hypothesis came out. Everyone job excited get exposed absolutely everything (including TB Heps) figured would pretty safe. 

And part, positive case rate lower expected type work, amount severe cases much lower average. 

So, personal non scientific experience, heavy exposure coronavirus based colds help. love presented opposing view, backed fact, play solipsist card. Healthcare workers specialities must deal death regularly. Yes, might others. also moment shine, contribute learn. step others can't. try different speciality suppose 7/11 hiring. 

There mass death occuring Texas anywhere else US. Deaths up, yes. states 25 percent normal year. healthcare worker can't handle that, wrong profession. 

I one daughter. friends also children overwhelming feel do.

Bottom line, I've moved covid people everyday. version bad need buy body bags run stock instead TP hand sanitizer GPUs, guess isn’t bad standards. Possibility universities going virtual again? obvious advantage Beta containing candidates

A virus kills 187 worth even tiny shred drastic measures, even general acknowledgement existence basically. virus kills 237 children deserving nonstop news coverage, shutting schools isolating kids? vaccinated population isn’t significant competition  looked Minnesota required vaccines public school state law. imagine trying update law current political conditions? think remember reading try avoid anti-inflammatory meds like Advil Tylenol 24 hours shot. dangerous reason, people thought might make vaccine less effective. 

Not sure accurate something might want look Difficult say. Data Chile show growing virtually pace, example Wait recommended get booster.

Covid low rate impact kids. Vaccine tiny risk well. one tiny risks may higher other.

""The JCVI said children low risk virus jabs would offer marginal different vaccines marginal benefit huge. know case, hope school vaccine mandates become thing kids get vaccinated

I looked Minnesota required vaccines public school state law. imagine trying update law? 

There provision allows commissioner health modify immunization requirements recommendation United States Public Health Service's Advisory Committee Immunization Practices, American Academy Family Physicians, American Academy Pediatrics.

We'll see take training wheels new vaccines variants roll out.

Look New Zealand. started great hold long. Imagine much difficult would USA response problem centers around fact better studies strongly support vaccines masks treatment alternatives

I 100% agree. Vaccines strong data supporting efficacy. vaccinated myself. said, think wrong-headed notion studies anti-virals possible therapies infected individuals (at point vaccines can't help). important studies way ivermectin right now. knows show. existing ivermectin studies small, observational, poor controls.

I looking forward finally get authoritative studies done around ivermectin.  Things bigger Texas.

They even hit peak yet... Chew y'all... Agreed, thing right develop vaccines quickly. Much rest poorly executed best. know two pregnant women aren’t vaccinated. Why? I’m sure. actively think much risk in. haven’t seen evidence causes infertility affects pregnancy way. seen mothers dying and/miscarrying covid. say ""87.5% unvaccinated"" counting people reasons besides coronavirus? imagine able treat vaccinated stroke victim different unvaccinated stroke victim, right? Osterholm said aerosol transmission pretty much Day 1 got antibody test done broke COVID spike protein antibodies. bunch later none former.   think legit message needles vaccine.

I know ANYONE even felt go arm. know using extra small needles what, one least painful (actually, painless) needle pokes anyone every experience. ooh interesting. know fact Novavax boost Pfizer effectively? ordinance allows exemptions employees medical conditions “sincerely held religious beliefs.”

So never mind Lately related saying nobody needs handouts govt help life COVID, stands history's largest recipient government handouts, totaling billions.  Necromancy? wife vaccinated, two boys 4 7 can't be. wife exposed COVID starting mild symptoms. guidance act home keep kids safe? distanced wife today started symptoms. completely isolate house even mild symptoms?   OR, could invest healthcare systems. Build hospitals, train doctors nurses, etc...

The amount money put healthcare systems law Nature global vaccination rate far USA. Currently US rate 113 doses administered per 100 people barely moving upward; global rate 72 doses per 100 people catching fast.

Right now, US 39th highest vaccination rate world, behind Ecuador lower countries like Mongolia, Bhutan Cambodia, way lower Malta, 159 doses administered per 100 people. Unless trends change, US going finish looking like 3rd world country. I'm sorry mother. hope remain safe. considered moving area thinks like you? good question, you’ll struggle get answers to.

Restaurants bars open, restrictions number people per table. Discos still closed. Shops comercial establishments limitation number people inside, manageable. Public events like concerts, plays, football matches also happening limited number people audience (I think 33% football matches, instance). 

You need show vaccine certificate order dine indoors restaurant, spend time hotel similar accommodation go public event, like ones mentioned above. alternative take quick test entrance wait result.

Instead, many western countries fuck way past containable. 1) Federal program. passed 1972, sponsored Hubert Humphry (D-Minn). Texas State program. 

2) Texas keeps voting politicians make attacks program (Republicans). example, Trump (whom Texans voted for) tried cut WIC budget last preliminary budget proposal released Trump White House Thursday calls cuts program aimed improving nutrition among low-income women children, potentially placing key programs jeopardy. cuts proposed similar sought recent years House Republicans targeted social welfare programs federal savings.  budget proposes cut Special Supplemental Nutrition Program Women, Infants, Children, known WIC, $6.4bn $6.2bn. program, aimed reducing infant maternal mortality morbidity, provides food vouchers low-income pregnant women, nursing mothers, children five years old, well breastfeeding support nutrition education.

The Flu vaccines weak compared COVID vaccines. produce cell response, hardly B cell response low levels antibodies. surface virus looks slightly different due antigenic drift (mutations), antibodies bind well left less unprotected. COVID vaccines hand produce much higher levels antibodies also strong B cell cell responses. B cell cell responses last much longer. Possibly decades. even surface virus looks different due antigenic drift, still protected severe disease due B cell protection. 
 
It kind ill-founded comparison flu vaccines lack understanding antigenic drift role various parts immune system IMO causing lot discussions fear currently see. 

I'll copy&amp;paste second part comment also applies indicates single booster shot could set us broad long term protection variants even coronavrius outbreaks:

""As pancovid vaccines, already know people previously infected get current mRNA vaccine shots produce antibody protection currently known variants SARS-CoV-2 also antibodies bind SARS-CoV-1 also instance RaTG13 bat coronavirus Pangolin coronavirus (I can't remember name). also see third mRNA booster shot people SARS-CoV-2 naive (they (yet) infected) produce much broader antibody spectrum. 
 
In words, seems already long lasting pancovid vaccines.""

&amp;#x200B;

So based (and much more) particularly concerned mutations conclude, least, safer choice still far get vaccinated. History written winners. He's favourite run president. Gop making near impossible lose next election.  Also, liked use ""refusenik"", lol. getting shot. take 2 days PTO afterwards due high fever. one wanted lose sweet, sweet Chinese tourist money Chinese New Year.   submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* co morbidities factors. vaccinated also significant factor. It’s clear day odds greatly improved you’ve vaccinated

that's point states article well, several factors play, vaccine agree significant patient likely survive going vaccinated one

but blank statement going point made makes sense. going stuff read online obviously could incorrect. CDC recommends self isolate much feasible. Mask car driving text site, etc. Good luck! Works me, I'm gonna give bit time going there. Things seem... interesting several regards. Great news, absolutely overshadowed announcement today COVID never eradicated. what's biden going say covid speech tonight? study small done deemed ‘breakthrough cases,’ namely patients fully vaccinated tested positive, evaluated illness severity. Among cohort, found 25/54 patients asymptomatic (hospitalized non-COVID-19 related diagnosis incidental positive PCR test SARS-CoV-2), 4/54 mild disease, 11/54 moderate disease, 14/54 severe/critical illness,” median age severe illness 80, said. half overweight, cardiovascular disease, half lung disease half patients would fully representative everyone breakthrough cases, everyone studied sick enough show hospital treatment. Plus study cover time Delta variant dominant circulating strain virus.    Excatly rural Alabama. college football games packed stadiums. Stay strong! Remind right thing. hard ppl around act like back normal. gets pissing contest started governors say ""if follow CDC we'll cut funding"" fed says ""if follow CDC we'll cut funding"" Joe Rogan? wrong? say. /s Ah, rare extra arm piece. Never seen before, feels like first time seeing Pokemon! non controversial incredibly easy comply considering vaccines free widely available anyone country. vaccine passport basically proof complete degenerate moron also talking fans. opposing players tested throughout week part NFL Covid policy. get worse. WHAT!? get medical advice Joe looks like someone put Frosty snowman magic hat overcooked ham. be?! Yea office mandated week FDA approval. happening. Even Covid worried states support lockdowns. realize mu another letter Greek alphabet? funny “Delta, Lambda, Mu... worst frat party ever... serves Corona.” FB meant *fecebook* ?  Delta upped rates $200/month unvaccinated. wholeheartedly support way, hope lots employers follow suit.

I’m happy prospect *my* rates going cover staying home, masking up, getting vaccinated, whole family done. worked within 3 feet positive case every day week tested. masks work too.    wonder gone, people continue care others doubt it. Obvious dont give shit unless effects us personally. Humans take inhaled steroids, walked pharmacists asked get third dose it. said, “that qualifies” gave within five minutes. 3rd dose Moderna. say first two shots reaction. one kind felt bleh 36 hours. real bad symptoms headache kind tired/achy. covid vaccines absolutely amazing, among effective vaccines ever developed, held well known strains. got swine flu seasonal flu time, even though flu shot. I'm sure helped lot, even though still sucked really bad - fetal position high fevers days + meds.

Being cancer stem cell transplant survivor, I've definitely felt way worse. goal feel anywhere near again. Get vaccinated revaccinated. Vaccines like hepatitis &amp; B last many years. get revaccinated stuff get kid transplant.  Nah, really. Lots countries quite okay regard. course, world binary. long covid symptoms people experiencing totally result anxiety caused catching disease caused global pandemic. really idea part plan, wondering myself. think would impose shut down, government looking get economy moving.

The easiest way move forward would vaccine mandate, though WH stated authority.

I'm thinking sort employer incentive require vaccines, mandate required testing unvaccinated. 

Really sure country move forward without vaccine mandate, political chess point. frustrating. wife started feeling ill 4 days ago, starting general fatigue sore throat. Yesterday started developing cough shortness breath. sleep upright last night uncomfortable getting full, normal breaths.

Today, cannot taste breakfast coffee. tried experimenting dollop peanut butter spoon said it’s like putting paste mouth without taste.

She fully vaccinated going get tested today. fully understand government works. think bottom line federal government’s strategy pushing vaccinations isn’t really working well—unless plan trim fat letting conspiracy theorists succumb covid. 

Back 2020, Biden promised us wouldn’t wave white flag let Covid run unchecked. one reasons voted him. I’m seeing white flag guise “states rights” personally experiencing overwhelming surge community state experienced. He’s going need figure accept folks may feel inclined show next federal election it’s state elections really make difference. CT much cautious. friends live there. Even daycares cautious. Take pandemic seriously. Unlike Texas live. Extremely frustrating. kind comparisons making. half US gets flu vaccine year (approximately) means 50% us satisfied 29-48% effective theoretically many people seeking covid vaccine Reddit area, Chattanooga, TN, delta breakout clinician told me. Nothing got ugh""fucking variants"" here. Good news vaccinated one whole year 6th October get 3rd. back recording data giving blood!

Despite negative shit going think atleast mitigate problems. also potential long covid symptoms head.

Definitely happens. someone who's clincally diagnosed anxiety, many long covid symptoms see symptoms anxiety.

Not saying long covid real, first time lot people experienced **real** anxiety Unpopular opinion: I'm fan Rogan thing qualifications discuss experience Covid. Yet seem matter. Boosters available everywhere immunocompromised. walk in. Im currently Austria watching system action. one scanning QR codes. They’re barely glancing screen, could photoshopped image QR code taking Rickroll one would know difference. 

My CDC card accepted everywhere that’s asked it. 

Everyone criticizing CDC cards using QR codes, code doesn’t shit one scans verify authenticity. Yep, new normal  bill burr also said somthing effect ""im gonna let dumbass self take advice dumbass medical experiance"" joe started banging masks. +1 bill. He's even good interviewing, check Louis Theroux episode, Louis takes school. Good, let em die stupidity. need waste blood them. agree, challenging time year parent live generally many random things going around, plus fall allergies. Pediatricians urgent care clinics swamped area, many places running short tests. Jfc least held event field outside something? Oh doubt, stating heard, whether agree. Dumb ass doctors plentiful days. circumstances would probably get soon, especially traveling.

I fully vaccinated early April plan get line booster November/December available. intend travel immunocompromised upper age group.   think media picking him

It's picking he's one listened voices planet he's sharing dangerous advice.

He responsibility. Ghost Busters boosters available anywhere? I’ve fully vaccinated 3 months definitely want safer side immunocompromised. Thanks!!  Boosters sensible general public US yet vast majority non-western world still completely unvaccinated due lack supply. got vaccines first governments paid drug companies make them, everywhere else world poor bargain big pharma relying charity wealthy nations vaccines. Covid continue spread mutate there, get vaccinated new mutations keep popping up, every mutation effective vaccine last, they'll spread here. specifically advised third dose reason! Kelly: “I swallowed tapeworm last night. It’s going grow 3 feet inside eats food don’t get fat. 3 months take medicine pass it. Creed sold me. It’s Mexico.”

Creed: “That wasn’t tapeworm.” lot kids indeed; another factor large religious minorities (both Arabs ultra-orthodox Jews) low trust and/or religious prejudice vaccines.  People know listen Joe Rogan talk media bad isn’t one influential mainstream members media time. That's absolutely right ‘Joe Rogan Getting Completely Wrong,’ Says ~~The Scientist Conducted Vaccine Study~~ anybody semblance knowledge/experience topic Joe Rogan discusses Hmmm. scientist conducted vaccine study podcast? Checkmate, loser. 

/s countries successfully kept covid done grounding halt. say lmao. Eurosnob. 

I said nothing cultural diversity states (European US). making statement immigration. know many Europeans deeply racist clue defend dog whistles. see news “how bad” race relations US, we’ve race conversation lot longer. 

I’ve got family living Germany lived Spain, fairly interested European cultures. I’ve got pretty good idea things there, better Europeans opposite direction. There’s way match last winter’s levels vaccine. 75% adults isn’t enough end it, it’s huge amount. Plus previously infected… eventually virus going run hosts.  Joe invite comedians interesting people entertainment industry. Go back actually made podcast great fun. 

Or least stop public strong opinions shit know anything about.  baffles anyone would listen mindless dolt..... Cheers that. Partially unvaccinated still dying!! except stopping unvaccinated cop tries pull over? mean, still pretty bad, though. man could barely stand up. Lying fact make seem like bad mean bad. Felt same, dumb purposefully dishonest. dude preaching doesn’t know what’s vaccine, people need live healthier improve immune system, etc. gets sick everything possibly immediately get better instead relying said immune system. HEY! record? try hide can't walk flight stairs without getting breath Sure Jan. Straight jail hope comment gets upvotes deserves everything kitchen sink... oh yeah, vaccines, one thing actually works... oops! thinks he's rational, thoughtful voice reason god damn little self awareness honestly embarrassing He's way organized critical thinker. Roganism smartass reactionary ad hominem arguments based random high-bias data filtering. dad lives Oak Ridge, yea, lots unvaccinated people. got vaccinated soon possible, lot people without protection. think might need start PSAs showing COVID infection looks like hospital. Probably talk international vaccine passport works, maybe incentives businesses mandate vaccines, probably info vaccines serious health &amp; boosters needed. bed counts - distraction. REAL issue almost cases staffing. enough staffing keep adding beds. SUre set triage hospitals, 1 nurse 2 bed ratio ICUs run with. many nurses, many quitting (for reason - almost like job worth lives). like Rogan think pretty good job interviewing people talking people. said cannot stand brings little news articles quick Google searches acts proof trying convey guest audience. That’s biggest reason cannot listen regularly.

I think media picking blowing ivermectin horse dewormer medication proportion people need quit thinking articles proof. Hell article pretty shitty headline also pretty clickbait well describing illnesses primarily affect individual. Anti-vaxxers spreading COVID others, taxing medical system, thing. good doggy, youre told. heres donut Man quote applicable every single minute every single day isn’t Yeah drive topic stuff that’s mind guest even audience Can't collectively ignore meathead? COVID care much bench. bet life told people comparing anti-vaxxers could get two little jabs issues cured/handled they'd it. Rogan one best spinning back kicks there. definitely ""great"" things. vaccinated would huge part story. don’t mention he’s unvaccinated save embarrassment. Every story national figure seriously ill follows pattern. 

If vaccinated CDC would reporting outbreak case serious illness elderly, obese underlying issues. Thanks detailed response! Western self interest predates capitalism Please Dr. Balls said.  JFC. know many vaxxed people ignorant vaccines science anti vaxxers happen ignorant different way happens positive outcomes. isn’t anything new it’s prominent ever stuff makes conspiracy nuts trust you. studies basically conclude ""this may marginally help"". studies conspiracy nuts referencing. can't fight disinformation outright disregarding position. friend antivax main talking point days media lied Rogan taking ""horse dewormer"", can't argue with, lie. got prescription doctor. change fact likely useless compared monoclonal antibodies took though. mention two $1,000,000 lotteries didn’t increase vaccination rates. government dumped $1 mill two people good reason. Two happy people suppose. 

Next discussion point, limiting drink sales 10pm lower Covid giving exemptions? govt throwing shit wall nothing sticking. geddit bubba don’t c+p comment NFL players currently 93% vaccinated, pretty impressive imo correct. wish different may seem like obvious conclusion science, need get receipts. move higher higher vaccination rates (at least many areas) going important. actually think bit blind spot right now, especially light fact many vaccine 'hesitant' people simply see personal benefit believe vaccination necessary healthy people. much focus 'breakthrough' infections think important people understand means get infected normal, healthy individual with, without vaccination make benefits getting shot clear 'low information' individuals.  Love Yanks think culture across different states diverse comparing Europe Asia lmao.  1 4 people stupid? Yeah sounds right. *not* 25% referring (them's dumb hell). people seriously saying may quit.

They won't. Mississipi casino around 150 employees recently imposed vax mandated. Company reported 1 person left rather get it. They're puffing chests. mandate comes, they'll get stop talking anything COVID related - benefit Louisiana, US, world. good news Kirk never good enough bring Vikings success anyway. Feel free root guilt free.  That's alternative.  Yes one big issues us sending kids school parents know kid sick 

Yes parents need work, IMHO parents automatically granted sick time kid covid. 
If keep circle jerk, sending sick kids in, school cases continue rise   attention seeking? podcast hardly ever appears anything else except maybe stages comedy shows closed events. Abbott intended hate fact article exists: Scientists responding Joe Rogan validation Joe Rohan’s opinion may carry validity. Tbf it’s easy to. We’re isolated rest world, many people haven’t even met someone outside continent. Doubly interior country. 

Not different Europeans Asians xenophobic many Americans. US many cultures, identities, peoples multiculturalism almost second nature.  Rogan used really good interviewing people. would ask good questions actually let person interviewing talk something. “made big,” head followed suit downhill ever since. thinks interviewed various famous intelligent people experts also makes intelligent expert. stuck letting interviews primarily guests show, might actually still worth watching. stands, isn’t worth watching more. geddit bubba don’t c+p comment love Joe Rogan think story great huge success. said nobody taking medical advice him. every right use whatever treatment wishes fight illness every right share people listen podcast follow social media. People need held accountable actions. take medicine, even prescribed doctor, read entire label make sure correct dosage understand side effects. feel like controversy subject started suggesting possible alternative vaccine crazy scenario ivermectin attempted treatment got covid vaccine preventative measure. Totally different options. Nope. surprised many people get without. Let's try this, recommendation proceed kids? masks, social distancing, vaccination schools? Yep, designed, trialed, authorized based efficacy symptomatic disease. great prevent significant portion infections too? Absolutely! fact aren’t perfect take away marvels science medicine. Yeah clinical trials showing useless best. doctor might dumb is. Joe Rogan incorrect? Inconceivable.  New tampoons used? Asking friend...that likes tomato soup... Maintain good zinc levels, you’ll less chance dying. Doesn’t stop catching though listen Joe Rogan like show. I'm sorry hear that, means wish diminish concerns fears parents regarding children. real. 


I'm advocating thinking risk practically relation data tells us. Anecdotes not. be, know it’s coming too. FBI investigation. resigned try show courts accept responsibility regret done try plea bargain.  Covid makes harder breath cumulative total number active cases.  Would mind sharing go keeping entertained day? sometimes struggle finding things kid, day day... Dumb jock doesn’t understand science homework. stores reserves second dose. Peppermint *sometimes* help catch early enough headache starting think it’s feels cold put temples, helps. mostly go straight Advil. There's app called Docket slowly getting state health departments sign up. Last checked New Jersey Utah. 
But easily pull vax info directly New Jersey Department Health, nice. oh **JEE-ZUS**. Eyebleach please. Memory flame thrower/disintegrator please.    Considering COVID-19 stay, it’s safe assume everyone’s odds coming contact eventually basically 100%

Not even remotely worth risk illness, hospitalization, death

GET VACCINATED Problem Rogan outsized reach. Misinformation impacting larger society. Even getting infected stopping bullshit. used listen him, occasionally defend him, pre covid, criticism received far warranted. Post covid, can't stand him. used enjoy podcast guests on. never regular guy conversation interesting people, made listen. 

Its persistent downplaying covid claiming know medical professionals turned ever tuning podcast again. Read entire comment responding, bud. great! Due date 4 days! That's true. kids, especially even like kids (sensory issues), think duty keep safe best can. hate idea kids potentially going long term potentially lifelong health problems virus we're literally months away able get vaccine. Wait you’re telling shitty stand-up comic that’s obsessed combat sport’s doesn’t know vaccine scientists who’ve done peer reviewed research it? daughter’s best friend still isn’t getting sick Christmas 2020. She’s chest pain difficulty breathing every time tries exercise. I’d rather risk long-term illness children could keep together months. live Canada though mentality quite different (though mass originally). messaging protecting kids. Wondering overly noticing shortness breath he's child? intend snarky, perhaps normal bit physical exertion going stairs. sounds like observed possibly short breath, him. saw Joe Rogan clip yesterday calls CNN reporting took horse dewormer spreads Covid disinformation. proceeded talk took ivermectin ivermectin proven work doctor Tokyo, meaning admitted taking horse dewormer spread Covid disinformation. things since began. plans stop.    first 1200 1500 (?) pretty cool - mostly Art Bell Part 2. 

Somewhat ironically, Rhonda Patrick may last carryover things pretty good.  american, rate much Republican opposition ones vaccinating etc. thing make ""conspiracy nuts"" trust giving conspiracy. Jesus Christ, looks like Robert Di Nero got stung bunch hornets Bless itsdr00 disingenuous focus conservatives show, make sound like he's shadowy arm Fox News.

He Bernie Sanders presidential race, Sanders (refreshingly) allowed speak length topic wanted.

That's one example. many, many more. Sanders example alone pretty damning whole ""Rogan political conservative show"" false narrative. I'm going listen either, they're friends I'm going fault Tom going friend's show. Tom started saying bullshit Joe would different. Looking peace mind. daughter (20), (45), step son (30) vaccinated without incident. most, mild symptoms day. 

My son, 16, got first pfizer yesterday. yet 24 hours. arm hurts pretty bad body aches. Neither concern me. bit breath climbing one flight stairs. That's start get worried. 

I know heart issues rare. told let know gets worse chest pain. point worry shortness breath? I'll honest, despite overwhelming evidence vaccine safety, can't help worried him. also know, horror stories swirling around much anti-vax crowd, probably worry point. places contact tracing efforts earlier varying degrees success things like dine restaurants. places never made attempt relied people contact trace tested positive.

I Hawaii work still attempting contact tracing. Unsure anything show though. Yep. I’m done. Got breakthrough Delta within 2 weeks kids starting school (who wear masks well don’t issue them). sucked hasn’t required medical attention. still wear masks public follow recommendations double vaxxed delta natural immune ass isn’t going “2 weeks flattening curve” more. lol someone get guy paste  Jinx! owe liter cola.    …and they’ve changed channel watch “Ow, Balls!”   Joe Rogan either lying getting lying getting better quickly.  inaction harm?

And doctor's refuse patients often? refusing administer *specific* requested treatment based judgement? still lot ongoing studies this. characterize evidence ""conclusive"". better way put evidence inconclusive. best, Ivermectin offers marginal benefit outcomes, conspiracy nuts characterizing it. reputable authors reputable journal. American Journal Therapeutics ranked 13,400. It’s academic equivalent vanity press. reputable author, reputable peer reviewers, solid methodology meta-analysis, it’d published Nature, NEJM, Lancet, entire world desperate cheap effective treatment COVID. quality studies meta-analysis poor (the large Egyptian study retracted) can’t combine number bad small base size studies get good large base size study. Garbage in, garbage out. autism community especially victimized Anti-vaxxed quacks decades. awkward parent finding classmates’ parents crazy ones.    know. imagine scientist said it.  Ew think administered vaccine doses world based mRNA. China's sharing Sinopharm vaccines like crazy. I've seen doctor explain another thread Sinopharm actually best world consider shelf life, storage requirements cost. mRNA options over-engineered accessible people developing countries. many people world vaccinated mRNA allow logistically. Twat wanna repeat? Rogan spreading misinformation business model. He’s enriching indirectly contributing human suffering death.

His excuses « just moron » « just asking question » relief moral responsibilities meaningful way.

Edit: word. Literally zero barriers entry, show information spoon fed small easy understand chunks.

Science too, called K-12. People pay attention. also much easier preacher there's really one thing Christians learn church: ""God all"". Individuals need legwork get that. Hell, many Christians know who've never read Bible? They're thing junior year biology matter there's nothing church really need learn. near much used be. 


Hospitalizations flattened despite continued increase deaths still super low, almost unchanged cases low mid-summer. Anybody good article debunks risk fertility getting COVID vaccine? Talking female hesitant get vaccine Yes is. lied hundreds millions people right called liar hundreds millions times. depends still asymptomatic phase not. spread people fever would EZ mode. Yeah, lot people going travelling game heavily anti-vax areas. I'm sure next podcast, Rogan correct everything said wrong, clarify points make people hesitant take vaccine. 

Right? - Michael Scott I'm disappointed acted exactly thought would, rather I'm disappointed karma real getting Covid come Jesus moment needed rest us. need someone like get seriously shook enough change tune. low level radio hosts nobody cares enough. literally Joe Rogan/Ron Desantis/or Mega Televangelist actively caused people believe lie, need get someone care get end ICU wakes hell up. Everytime one assholes gets mild case throw money strengthens message right, nothing fear. really shitty universe can't throw us bone make karma real Covid.  wall wall coverage probably equal total viewership average show. 

This dumbass platform regular media dream about. Definitely Farva Waning efficacy time, delta variant infectious mostly. Look slowly deaths rising vs case numbers. It’s bad, nowhere near before. Also they’ve recently rolled booster program, helping. happened US Alex Jones gonna sell super flashlight 🔦 put bag blood would destroy microchips vaccine particles. Profits! forgeries noticed date/time field cards filled as: ""right meow"". 
Also health worker administered shots one ""Dr. Jonathan Chimpo"", could located comment. posted yesterday; make feel better. Um...Joe Rogan 911 truther? Funny Guy, credible. thinks really smart though.   hospitalizations severe illness unlinked case counts 
 
No, still linked, even 100% vaccination rates. president pulled crap order challenge federal election process &amp; incite full-scale armed riot capitol building, allegedly. 

Once set precedent half country begging person makes feel coolest literally think tell every morning... anyone try make money boost fame using approach? Proven success. think statement little unfair. people without kids insisting kids school in-person, continuing play sports, without mask mandates. Yes meant. Nate's got point though, gotta admit.   clarify: lack case reporting Labor Day Holiday. Misinformation cancer society. stories doctors nurses people refusing believe Covid literally ventilllator spending last hours life locked away family. Remove unvaccinated first. Thank you! bizarre reason

We humans bad future recognizing effects actions. common story cancer doctors sees patient late stage cancer recommends aggressive chemotherapy. patient, afraid predictable consequences chemo instead resorts snake oil. disease progresses, patient returns doctor tells window treatment passed death sentence already signed. Patients worldview crumbles.

Risk management future things humans equipped deal with.  people can't get treatment specifically antivax people taking ICU beds? 

That also sets terrible precedent, right?

People treatable medical conditions dying specifically antivaxxers clogging medical system. seems really wrong too. Good news, use nips poke ‘em news, water wet.  think he's con man. spent good part life believing moon landing faked. think he's legitimate moron. someone watched podcast, read article, vaccinated, hoping achieve comment?

This kind thinking reinforces echo chambers. Stop it.  Practically every show. band mates fans, unfortunately, displeasure podcasts played road trips.  distinctly remember listening several UFO related podcasts distinguished Navy pilots explaining saw, Joe would casually ignore hour repeat nonsense questions like ""but could aliens, right?!?"" officer finally said ""sure, maybe"", Joe would go tell listeners nutjob alien theories.  Dating advice fake taxi guy? Oh, that's accurate? MSM narrative? Man sad ,I huge respect blindly believed shared said video mentioned. hearing news,from going check facts myself. Amazon Can't melt exist?  think he's even MMA fight, merely commentator. Wait lymph node massage nodes removed?

Sounds legit. shit, Joe Rogan fucking fool tool fans even bigger fools even less useful tools. It’s ridiculous suggestion vaccinated people subject testing outdoor event. assumed bitching 12. Overton window.

Do first,   He’s conservative issues liberal others results speak itself.  *slaps head

It's smooth! True! would take advice subject someone incredibly successful subject? dumb right? Says expert field Joe ever talked about.  Exactly! JRE I've seen since James Hetfield episode. 

Burr get away he's known Joe forever Joe actually looks him. Plus Burr talks everyone like lol. mean, gonna take way, 12th man also jabbed. say unsafe, said vax negative test best combo. said kid school?  He's multiple times 2019 Jan 21. never commented political beliefs... commented quality guests Covid compared pre Covid. 

How many podcasts done year?  Taking medical advice comedian deadly pandemic. could possibly go wrong? 🤔 think you’re missing point. Saying, “Rogan prescribed ivermectin doctor treat Covid” misinformation, literally happened. Saying, “a doctor Japan studied affects ivermectin treating Covid” misinformation, it’s literally true. seem conflating two statements mean “ivermectin cures Covid” doctor Japan, joe Rogan stated. last experince chiropractor giving false hope claming able fix back. never want see chiropractor ever again.    explains many people listen him, guess.  always hilarious people talk condescendingly something simple anything but. place cesspool desire bad news. 

Why recent report [NYTimes risk breakthrough case 1 top voted post here? fact live high vax area 1 10,000? reality getting hospitalized 1 1,000,0000 initial headlines contagious overblown misleading?

You want know why? y'all like fucking miserable misery loves company. Go get vaccinated live life. shit stay. seriously take greater risks others' safety commuting vehicle going life vaccination. 

Should also stop driving jackasses want wear seatbelt? major details event, including public viewing locations access/vaccination rules crowd, announced closer event. Macy's says volunteer participants staff vaccinated, participants staff wear face coverings additional protective equipment needed, social distancing place interior/exterior parade operations, overall reduction number participants 10-20 percent (approximately 800 1,600 fewer Nothing, know of. pointing silliness argument. 

Had thinking cleverly though, would said disappointing [Mike Man wish rip new asshole idiots. end result 50 years war experts government. trust experts institutions people left con men snake oil salesmen. got Thursday morning, think started feel better woke Saturday. probably 100% Sunday, laying bed day also take toll.  Yes scientist podcast? Probably not. miss conspiracies ""Who really shot JFK?"" ""Is Hitler secretly living Montana?"". Cool fact those: two men discovered deliberately didn’t patent discovery. guys gift humanity, going “hey…these cancerous immune cells produce antibodies forever, make produce useful ones!” not. constant belief ""new"" ""other"" information makes smarter others. 

Before social media, idiots. ""enlightened"" others hive-mind with. 

I've lost could count point. Yeah, think need defund police, need change narrative.

Their training feel afraid life, fire center mass threat neutralized. tell job dangerous world, people sworn protect actively trying kill them.

We need train de-escalation instead threat neutralization.  He’s expert people listen like is. That’s problem. 

He’s entertainer he’s probably responsible hundreds thousands Americans getting vaccinated. It’s outdoor event requires vaccination testing. safe that? kid going school indoors significantly dangerous going outdoor event. something joe rogan strictly advises against. hate you. Go put makemesuffer wonder Joe would reflect responsibility knew many people dead something said entertained show pivotal moment determining choices leading deaths. much like CSI shows entertainment factor, indirectly made life extremely hard. Tbh probably regular stretching improved well rather dude's work.  savage experimenting 200°F saunas? seems good brain.  brushed 'if drink would've fine' mentality

I watched clip morning.

Un fucking believable. five minute ivermectin ad started with. ""People say crazy taking it, what's crazy quickly recovered"". may dumb ask people tell covid card false info?  Purge unclean holy fire?   sound kinda mad.  Sounds like it’s way Yeah would died didn’t that! Covid deadly  lot acupuncture woo-woo unsubstantiated fuck, areas like chronic nerve pain interactions acu seems really help people. Anything outside chronic pain relief though youre pushing boundaries evidence.

Source: dated acu couple years, date doctor. Delta Northeast long everywhere else country. I’m pretty sure least 95% cases NE Delta started go along rest country, albeit much gradual curve. schools opening could cause significant spike cases here, opened last week we’ll wait see causes significant spike not.    Everything got worse Phil Hartman killed. must say, everything went smoothly app. Delayed, vaccinations correctly registered people, many logins first day crashed etc. works great. Sometimes also show driver's license passport confirm information. Also, vaccinated also get temporary qr code get negative test. disagree last part, tell experiences (I worked GIS lab years data scientist) scientists want get data masses, though want listen. large part lab creating info papers easy read possible. Literally interns dedicated creating coming designs  good thought ponder day. Thank :) least try fix next generation adults

Which inter-generational culture wars. address problem, kick road hope kids going fix it. I've hearing song dance 35 years now. extra insult injury children try take work adults existing adults say that's childish nonsense culture war even harder. heard trend India countries delta hit US. huge, huge spike inexplicably, rapid decline afterward. waiting decline. also ridiculous keep bringing Tulsi Gabbard made entire career 'democrat goes Fox agree Republicans' sort example liberal guest 95% democrats/liberals view secret conservative. brother loves guy, brother moron.  think Midwest/Northeast seeing start Delta wave now, started (or start) going back school. Right Maine, Ohio, Iowa, parts Illinois Indiana seeing larger larger case numbers. looks like south, waves lasted 2 months starting decline, many places started seeing increases month ago, another month wave hopefully declining states also. think another smaller wave starting around Thanksgiving going February due holiday gatherings cold weather, believe likely last significant wave US - kids probably start getting vaccinated large chunk unvaccinated natural immunity  Without bothering read article, let confidently say, ""No shit""    mean subluxation exist? mild dislocation/joint laxity. therapist treat CVA patients shoulder subluxation time.   don’t need expert tell eating heart de-wormer isn’t safe human consumption. fault people audience properly making good medical decisions. every opportunity listen professionals medicine, people actually help them. Rogan doctor, cannot possibly treated one held accountable respect doctor. allowed show, speak whoever wants, share opinions. anybody anything says responsibility.

Maybe I’m missing something regards free expression speech opinion. want listen free so, idk blame anything personally do. credentials. dead helps too. Im like 99% sure he's vacced? need foreign intervention cause division. Let's admit least 50% americans dumb. Fair enough. see Joe egomaniac seeking attention, think that's motivation podcast. mean dude survived lot toxic things, like personality.  preponderance evidence benefit. seems pretty clear me. preponderance evidence matters science, evidence pointing one way evidence pointing other. calling scientists liars!? Kind surprised answer wasn't, ""everything"".  happens stupid people think they're smart given voice. Cough Trump Cough. ask healing crystals? disappoint. Actually that’s exactly least implies clip, referring second time, said Joe spreading misinformation Covid referencing saying doctor Tokyo recommended use ivermectin, isn’t said. doctor recommended study ivermectin based reported numbers Africa, didn’t study ivermectin official study ivermectin conducted Japan found ineffective. Furthermore Joe goes claim refusal doctors acknowledge ivermectin due type conspiracy keep emergency use status Covid vaccine, also disinformation Pfizer vaccine FDA approved weeks now. people recover covid quickly even without medication.

A lot people even get symptoms. need talk something common? Subluxation exist? literally said jaw dislocaged, subluxation nothing mild form joint dislocation definitely exist.  evil deity who’s kill people. crazy talk.

No, he's dumb ape huge platform attracts dumb apes. Literally monkey see, monkey do.

Treating guy largest podcast platform, recently signed multimillion dollar deal, ""a podcaster likes mma"" pretty disingenuous. understand sway fans, right? understand term **influencer** means, man basic stuff.

Like using vaccine virus?  still hold. Every ecosystem nature tends toward equilibrium every ecosystem also eventually fails. Expecting normality return die-off safe bet context societal collapse global ecological collapse happening, once. entirely possible (but guaranteed) strain many people dying conflicts stemming would exacerbate failure broader systems. 
 
Of course retrospect every die-off natural phenomenon ""needed happen"" person making assessment group survived, definition. Simply assumption held true thus far means guarantees continue true. genetic line fails death, saying ""needed happen"" little comfort. mean Joe Rogan *self-proclaimed* idiot? Huh. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* told dumbass followers jump cliff protect Covid, did, he'd jail.

No. all. even little bit. doubt could even bring civil suit someone telling something reasonable person would ignore yet chose do. 

Rogan relevant qualifications claiming any. 

With limited exceptions yelling ""fire"" theater, one getting jail time saying stupid, ignorant vile things America time. even people millions choose listen to.

Republicans fiscally conservative, socially conservative. Libertarians fiscally conservative, socially liberal. Literal opposites half spectrum. medical advice would take Joe Rogan creatine supplement shrink balls least. really breakthrough didn’t seroconvert? pockets even somewhat decently vaccinated states, uptake low. bet add lot combine them. Southern Illinois bad, county shameful. shows virus numbers. Something tells you, personally, **need** people ""ridicule mock"" makes feel superior willing throw wide net around everyone keep satiated. vaccine. Impressive confidently full shit. Yes, unfortunately human way.  case....on one side shit ton people dying hospitals overrun unvaccinated people. dodging question. Note said ""livestock dewormer"". going quibble whether dog livestock: stahp.

None changes central fact: balance evidence concludes ivermectin nothing covid.

Why quibbling livestock, dogs etc fact central issue?    high risk pregnancies. America’s you’re drunk. Take look mirror fix please.

-World Big thing today im another year, Facebook social media giants fined billions roles... Name iconic duo ""Joe Rogan"" ""getting things completely wrong"" would funny ass meme. Joe Rogan Pineapple rings cherry eyes.  Human ivermectin, people go buy horse paste.

He actually part, show highlights circulating. Personally, I'd liked see spliced since fairly important distinction.

(This argument anything else said, wanted help pointing one part totally correct)    point considered traitor country? He's literally promoting spread covid F pay respects ... can't even tell yo mama joke   Great, know Joe Rogan looks like he's taking shit. ""Having self awareness know I'm dumb means I'm least smarter dumb people realize!""

*Proceeds exact dumb thing rest* username obliges us acquiesce. lot strawmanning going here.  This. first started listening swear good interviewer. different kinds guests asked interesting questions long form interviews without putting opinions everything. point lost quality show suffered severely. right, reality, anyone get booster shot want vaccine providers seem asking proof immunocompromised requesting doctor's note. 

But, really desperate third shot even proven necessary general pop? 

I'm blaming feeling way think we've reached sad place fully vaccinated people questioning efficacy White House, media [screwed messaging    ...the article says Idaho already You’re missing something here. might professional chef, amateur chef that’s still chef. amateur MMA fighter trains spars. I’m suggesting you’re dug narrow definition it’s odd hill die on. Yeah that's fair point think right dismissiveness pushing people rabbit hole. posted link best combo relatively recent medical-related source. heard Becker's search seems for-profit hospital industry magazine.

Does anyone know authoritative / recent sources? tried searching CDC site.


I'm going traveling airliner months shopping eye protection wear. (in addition N95 mask) consider airliner confined space variable ventilation. 

The airlines say air filtered that's great right ""in"" air vent ""out"" / return vent, exposed exhale everyone upstream.  

I'd consider IMHO face shield fine intermittent / distanced exposure airliner, I'd thinking *cootie air* ^^^tm could easily swirl eyes...so goggles...  remember News Radio. pretty funny show.  bad respiratory virus first presented pink eye November 2019. know pretty early, makes wonder. He'll never again, much Kool-Aid.  ever friends someone abused psychedelics know help. can't expect narcissist apologize. anyone related people watch decline real time. relatives definitely brainwashed sitting front TV pumps outrage porn 24/7.   Dude data masks work. can’t people get fucking vaccines Yes. let Rogan hear ""But he's honest drunk driver! Always tells ride home plastered is! Let's ride him!"" Well expecting that. Read many times older people didn’t good amount antibodies shortly second shot. means people could died got infected. It’s actually sort good news Anyone wouldn’t get without “/s” also doesn’t know “/s” means.   mean, morons think he's getting anything correct. scientist saying opposite ignored anyone that's actually listening Joe Rogan. also doubt people take seriously ever exposed opinions actual scientists. Anyone half brain knows stay Trump eats fast food day knocking death's door. got monoclonal antibodies treatment saw miraculous results.

Rogan specifically said nobody take vaccine meds let natural immune system handle things.

Then gets covid takes every expiremental treatment sun, still bashing free non experimental vaccine.

Meanwhile hospital family works at, 100% hospitalized patients unvaxxed. You’re wrong, come eventually he’s unvaccinated. recently saw sort government PR, think COVID even, included phrase ""A truckful yeet"". pedantic here? MMA started early 90's, Joe retired fighting 1988. Joe consistently pushes back idea he's ever MMA fighter. It'd like cooking dinner, telling everyone chef. reason felt worth mentioning common misconception. So...are saying democracy work? people voted in. could remove him, seem want to.

Do want live state ruled ""experts"" instead representatives? would lot advantages -- sounds like sci-fi dystopian novel.

That said...I'm Republican happy hell Newsom pandemic. Never thought I'd say that. Florida keep DeSantis. necessarily “wholesome,” reward bank - thanks posting! $5,000 entry fee refunded proof vaccine.  “Beds” always means “staffed beds”. That’s one reason numbers fluctuate. shit. make lose respect? Isn’t lack sleep alcohol proven leave immune system compromised? issue way said it?  give dogs ivermectin heart worms. also taking horse dewormer? disingenuous call that. Joe Rogan took version approved FDA human use. Yes   Understandable, see - hopefully it’s available soon see there.   FB comments cesspool. TikTok really bad too. exposed twice 8 10 days ago. Everyone vaccinated one got sick. Indoors, masks, person infected symptomatic next day saw him. Vaccines still highly effective even reduced efficacy. Thank you. would cause spread, unfortunately.  Didn’t bunch types move Texas? thing many things science proven yet, especially anything related COVID. That's scientists, talking anything related pandemic, sound unsure - lot shit know. Even stuff like masks, long time know anything not. 

And fine - science eventually figure stuff out. need make decisions now, based incomplete unproven data. means becomes question belief - trust numbers scientists put forward trust odds give you, trust shit someone made youtube clicks?

The answer personal many people. many reasons one might choose mistrust scientists. I've run many people who, presented scientific data, say ""I trust data!"". amount reasoning managed convince them. personal preconceived notions scientific community, really hard break.

That's need foster belief scientists. need make people comfortable idea many things know sure, still good estimate right decision might be. best argument make people ""If thousands scientists independently reach conclusion data, means conclusion/data likely right."" people used uncertainty, scientific process stuff. They'd rather trust someone 100% bullshit made up, trust someone rigorously verifies claim therefor sounds bit unsure himself. Extinction event  Even based stats Sweden performed subpar Finland, Iceland, Norway Denmark.  is, think, lot behind COVID vaccine refusal instead taking horse paste found cousin wife, six kids, unvaccinated caught virus. Wife hospital week pneumonia. four kids still live home it. 

Idiots. never took pandemic seriously begin with, never locked down, never masked. I’m seriously considering never speaking people again. hope they’re okay, course, hand made fucking bed. 

I feel bad kids. right still hung one day over-reported Floridas numbers...how 500 days they've under-reporting them? general sending men battle.. kids teachers. Grow fuck up!! Archive.is down. 2 zero 2 4 

That's motive. mama wide, one pocket Europe China good point think underscores big tragedy see occurring across America,"" Miami-Dade County Public Schools Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said though community, 98% individuals gotten least one dose vaccine, still lag specific individuals represent ethnic minorities 13 school employees died African Americans unvaccinated, according families, Carvalho vaccine mandates illegal Florida, best thing Carvalho offer incentives teachers get fully vaccinated, including $275 stipend employee shows proof vaccination, First tragedy, farce.  Could anyone help out?

Yes: Doctors healthcare staff. Vegetarians clean vegetables well! eating even organic! I’m infection control nurse. prevention begins education!  Surely sarcasm. love comment gets instantly deleted use swear word

but articles like allowed  speaking behalf study No, he’s sure hell complicit taking advantage stupidity. I'm located midwest, swung cases Mu past weekend Delta. lot maybe 50 cases Delta enough county health department freaking ""we prepared Delta Mu simultaneously infecting unvaccinated strained healthcare system""

Alpha barely around location, Delta, Mu lesser extent Beta. Mask wearing sure, distancing going happen. hospitalizations severe illness unlinked case counts, there's real reason region like New England adhere strict prevention measures. Unless goal eradicate virus, believe that's possible bridge sell you. 


The risk calculous changed. like think Minnesota ""canada-lite"" way passive-aggressive state (unfortunately).

But: YES! omg 😍 absolute silence snow best. Cant blame them. police getting hell knocked news lately. cop knows another cop something illegal blow even more, doesn’t anything it, pretty much stupid gets. 

Credit misspelling name vaccine like lady tho.  **What would assume reading headline**: patients currently Mu variant Houston Methodist. Oh no, Mu variant going take world.

**In actuality**: Nope, doctors retroactively determined 50 cases dating back May Mu variant cases, since variant recently designated variant interest. Mu least several months thus far failed gain much ground Delta. reason believe contagious Delta. varying opinions Ivermectin including Japan who’s Heath minister advises anyone sick take it. Japan traditionally conservative medication America propose precisely article says doing. Provide care based patients need likely survive.  Great, def. tell breathing. probably chest xray pulmonary function test assess her. Please delete didn’t say wasn’t true. I’m pointing could point reduced risk breakthrough infection. Thousands dummies started citing article statements CDC order say vaccines don’t anything. Rogan wrong EVERYTHING. Anyone listens dumbass. Yeah mean, winter joke, certainly tolerable live-through-able. Lol might get flurry October think we've snow stick ground October since blizzard 1990 (maybe 91?) freak like 2ft dumping snow early-mid April (I want say polar vortex 2018? east coast got absolutely completely buried snow.) usually pretty well melted April get *possibility* occasional flurry (...up memorial day).

Minnesota everyone 🤣 idk, think people forget consider option enjoy sharing opportunity arises. never said anything amounts though you? said ""well one thick paste horse version tiny pill"". move goalposts.

Regardless, still matter said: That’s isn’t taking horse dewormer. 

How know form drug took? different chemical paste form anyway. chemical, often used horse dewormer sold OTC, sometimes used get rid worms humans rx only. Whoa, calm down! need sausage. Oregon activated NG help like two weeks ago. Joe Rogan fuck up. bearing anything surprised gets even much attention gets. Idiot. two-thirds vaccinated infectious disease experts eat indoors restaurant, almost half attend *outdoor* sporting event, course people reading going think breakthroughs big deal course they'll want boosters.

Eating shit probably kill me, still it.  According Mass. Department Public Health, 0.53% vaccinated individuals state tested positive virus since vaccination. Deaths among vaccinated individuals 0.004%. 
 
And mind you, numbers get better everyone vaccinated. sounds like magic ticket freedom me. Vaccine hesitancy singular thing keeping us returning normal (wise) precautions we're still taking direct result &lt;100% eligible adults vaccinated. Yup, also interesting nugget placed middle Despite alarming rise cases, still appears severe illness due Covid-19 uncommon among children time, according AAP.

As parent, like know child likely end hospital broken bone, something COVID related let play friends. makes managing risk difficult can't compare anything.  It’s funny hear people attack Rogan misinformation posting misinformation. Congratulations article's title literally ""Vaccinated People Breakthrough Infections Spread Delta Variant, CDC Says"" 100% true whether want believe not. There's nothing misinterpret there.  matters pressing. Clusters mu mean much can't outinfect delta.

There still alpha running around well. depends are. state Rhode Island, example, performed 4.5 tests per person, testing free entire pandemic. totally forgot hosted fear factor mentioned it. go IMDB remember show, still don't. watched show! also called knuckle dragger went right Rogans head like pompous ass best friend travel nurse currently working 3mo contract would pay twice yearly. good news anywhere? vaccine came suddenly ""things changing better! 90%+ safe getting infected!"" 


Now seems every headline ""hospital's full"" , ""you catch COVID vaccinated"" , ""Breakthrough cases dangerous expected"".  amazes someone like still given platform distribute false information also paid millions it. MASS ACTION needs taken Spotify. Anyone show distributed needs get removed. Boycott assholes. “Nobody taking medical advice here’s medical advice”.

That sounds like something lawyers remind say every awhile keep sued.  Lambda others past delta around outcomepting delta.

Each letter mean worse, newly identified spreading. [Interesting article yet [you still experts saying actually find likeable thinks he's way smarter is.

He's guy found success couple different fields thinks he's expert everything.

He's friendly dumb oaf taken seriously outside legitimate lane knowledge (MMA).  hate says this. far world's popular podcast producer people listen say whether Joe thinks not. needs hold accountable bullshit kills people. Depends gets elected higher office. victors get rewrite history, least bury facts long gone. wedding February fiancé definitely getting booster prior wedding. would absolutely get one situation!    Nah, become true leader horse people. brave stupid people facing terrible plague. Dumb Dumber ruined Snakes? going prove one since I'm pretty sure mammalian virus.  Fact matter everyone going exposed one time another Covid virus. Choice is, person wish vaccinated exposed. Good luck!  Yes, combination of:

(1) GOP governors, congresspeople, local leaders, media, Supreme Court justices, members public become entrenched anti-vaccine, anti-mask, anti-social-distancing, anti-remote-learning, pretend-the-virus-doesn’t-exist position, feel can’t give without admitting fucking badly year half, instead deal cognitive dissonance pretending roughly 1 million dead Americans big deal.

(2) Delta variant (first noticed India), significantly transmissible original version Covid Alpha variant.

If look around USA, counties cases, hospitalizations, deaths less inversely proportional vaccination rate. Compare orange green maps: San Francisco Bay Area, Delta variant blazed part unvaccinated population hit wall run. Unless virus evolves escape vaccines, probably another dozen deaths maybe hundreds hospitalizations here, nothing extraordinary compared diseases. soon 5–12 year olds vaccinated pandemic pretty much here, life fully return normal.

By contrast, rural GOP-leaning counties near California–Oregon border, GOP-leaning counties CA central valley, low vaccination rate (30–40%) Delta nightmare: hospital beds left, lots really sick people, school outbreaks causing quarantines closures, medical workers completely exhausted exasperated, etc.   much listen JRE Joe...

I like hear lot guests say. Yeah, ain't exercise, real. Rogan still somehow riding 4 seasons Newsradio best thing he's ever participated in, 20 years show ended Northeast really hit hard Delta yet. think still room run. Higher vaccine rates stricter mask policies might enough hold off. Schools putting large numbers unvaccinated anitbodies together.

This site projects New York, instance, peak November. scroll hospitalizations click map, advance timeline see spreads north. Death + hospitalization rates project lower south   vaccine always information always talked keeping hospitals able stopping infection. information like April.

And vaccinated people could catch even OG SARS-COV-2, never 100% preventing infection.

Delta way worse due higher viral load. Wasn’t one main drivers telling people vaccinated wear mask found viral load vaccinated individuals unvaccinated. Meaning still transmitting virus back peddle mask mandates. supposed believe, scientist dopey stand-up comedian MMA commentary guy?  get tornados/severe storms, cold, hot-hot heat, Red River valley floods almost every spring, really bad.

I've never experienced earthquake mind, one scariest things imagine, hah! Like I'd way rather put cold weather worry earthquakes sinkholes hurricanes (but that's 😊)  News could also interview experts instead telling everyone what’s online people feel. Give facts unbiased way change peoples minds truth. one reported vaccine FDA approved gave scientific facts  He’s never fought MMA. competed Taekwondo high level younger amateur kickboxing record 2-1 retired fighting 21. He’s never competed MMA.  paying bill? It’s legal responsibility. shouldn’t moral responsibility aren’t vaxxed. ""Joe Rogan getting completely wrong!""

Do idea little narrows subject? Hey… said it… Cool. Thanks letting know. 70/30 Connecticut. yeah, makes sense.  Kicking high gear. Apparently rate spread 4th highest country now. Experts manipulation. They’ll double getting vaxxed taking horse medicine. 

Maybe try reverse psychology tell get vaccinated. Michelle Obama come podium tell everyone Ivermectin part balanced diet. Agreed, used somewhat objective broscience kind way would listen / open experts would on. listened episodes, latest episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick, listening anymore all. eyelids look like knuckles. Pinnacle health, no??? Hard say CDC messed up. new virus one knew facts start.   get frustration, thinking people dumb sounds elitist lead strong distrust resentment scientific community. 



You know church popular? preachers extremely good communicating welcoming masses people feel show week part community. Literally zero barriers entry, show information spoon fed small easy understand chunks. 9/11 easy ""other"" blame, ""proper"" response (massive use military force) something America gets excited about? getting downvotes probably right. figured confirmation bias case also kind hard deal many stories breakthrough cases, anecdotally know meds?  three lost pretty sweet gig.

Vermont drowning pension obligations. top pension recipients Judges State Troopers. State troopers retire 50, pension 50% top 2 years salary. get promoted ever, that's 50k lifetime pension starting 50 years old. good job get promoted, retire double that. Based pensions VT currently pays, many troopers retire young significant pensions.

On top that, despite thin blue line bullshit, VT state trooper safe job. rarely die job, do, crash cruiser, got shot. far safer than, say, farming Vermont.

Lot's law enforcement jobs actually quite safe, offer great benefit packages. VT State Trooper certainly example that.  hardly walloped spring compared states.

[NYtimes Connecticut covid cases Probably little column little column B. course, licking Legault's asshole since beginning like fucking turd. Holla lose 2 3 people shift cover technically chance  Yep, agreed. Definitely black white, strong points sides. 

Either decision make people either side mad.

I'd still say mandate, given precedence vaccines, slam dunk.  take son peg tube replacement yesterday. told pre-op nurse fully vaccinated, shared belief vaccines driving virus mutate.  Apparently anyone get booster lie say they're immunocompromised. know true first hand, also surprise me. like pharmacy tech random CVS going give enough fuck try call someone that. hate scientist rebut meathead punching enthusiast became famous making people eat donkey penis TV. says time though. Same, live next door Texas. husband works construction. says vast majority coworkers unvaxxed.  all. I've known one since kid. see every years back gets wrecked. normally one two sessions, I'm good. insanely good reviews he's like everyone. minoxidil Hospitalizations (24 states NYC reported)*

Mortality (45 states, NYC, PR GU reported)*
Among states reporting, children 0.00%-0.27% COVID-19 deaths, 7 states reported zero child deaths
In states reporting, 0.00%-0.03% child COVID-19 cases resulted death mean like white people first? wrong. professional athletes required role models either. used name people like Joe, we’ve forgotten it. used call people sell outs. dude selling whole country promoting anti-vax bullshit. 21 days? good scientific reason 14. 

And go across different county see family, paid leave?

Interestingly, Pfizer-breakthroughs know *not* feel like mild symptoms.

My brother, like conservatives, trusts people trying sell things. coercion involved? case referencing, legal issue coercion. He's betting he'll pick enough national votes primaries killing voters Florida matter. all, voted Democrat.  Always been. I'm constantly amazed people discovering this. I've seen trust fund kids get deep psyches, almost always start believing bullshit. God complex, think world revolves around them.  stand comment.

You’d think scientists universities medical journals etc would enough intelligence notice problem address PR, marketing, etc. 

I numerous friends academia complain incessantly action taken government citizenry stupid apathetic anything... little projection. people knowledge don’t take meaningful action. that's makes horrible dangerous person.  It’s actually bummer. used listen almost every episode even topic wasn’t something necessarily interested in, interview usually still interesting. slowly listened less less went Spotify end it.  Neocons far libertarian get. making people live way want to. Jesus, hell going people right now? can’t serious.   Jesus, must infuriating epidemiologist/virologist see.

I feel like make new standard publishing scientific articles time social media: layman’s abstract. it, author try basically ELI5 paper proving, theorizing, you. also bulleted list things paper categorically support prove… like “vaccines effective”. fact necessary tragicomedic, apparently that’s society.

Tangentially, basically opinion Joe Rogan fairly recently, recent antics (you know, spreading information that’s categorically incorrect pandemic) made strongly dislike him. closer 60% viral infection prior covid triggered long covid symptoms. think it’s lot common viral infections previously realized. said gotten much better.   excellent points. agree. would sooner point unvaccinated key part problem, necessarily vaccinated lax social distancing masks.

I mostly addressing scenario areas high vaccination uptake (like mass). step 1 : ask peer reviewed study claims risk fertility

step 2 : wait

step 3 : hope social security still around find one Oof. bullshit he’s spouting profit gonna come back bite him. widely discussed social media. I'm glad they're finally going research this. Issues seem specific mRNA vaccines issues range late/missed menstruation even menstruation women who've gone menopause. seem effect fertility. read first hand accounts  cult leader liable telling followers drink poisoned kool aid meet God?  catch slippin'  always new variants new headlines anxious No, didn't. Re-read three definitions wrote, read quote article (you actually READ article, you?) 
 “Current evidence suggests virus spreads mainly people close contact other, typically within 1 metre (short-range). person infected aerosols droplets containing virus inhaled come directly contact eyes, nose, mouth. virus also spread poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, people tend spend longer periods time. aerosols remain suspended air travel farther 1 metre (long-range).” 
 
Aerosol. Oregon law, local municipalities issue vaccine mandates firefighters police officers already federal state rule place requires it, per email deputy city attorney Heidi Brown. city believed requirement came August 19 Gov. Kate Brown issued vaccination mandate state’s healthcare workers. city felt Governor’s definition health care workers broad enough cover police officers, receive medical training. city attorney’s office advised city move forward citywide vaccination mandate included new guidance related Governor’s vaccine mandate, delivered city late Friday, said police officers likely exempt state’s vaccine mandate. guidance said law enforcement “probably not” subject governor’s orders providing medical care “likely fundamental part job.”

They found loophole. Looks like it’s governor fix doesn’t seem like would difficult. Donkey. Joe’s small part horse smart knows that's going happen, yes, need communicate better way people actually listening to. need pr firm communicate good scientific information meme way get shared followed. People like sensationalist shit, boring headlines says something works please take it

The issue is, scientists careful present findings way allows thier findings viewed, understood thier experiments replicated verification. deal absolutes. 

So screeching mob demands know something, soundbite give without qualification. ""yes no"" answer. degrees certainty based current available knowledge information.

There time education revered educated appointed/elected held accountable falsehood gravity decisions based thier work lost them.

Now, political erosion public trust general populations disdain educated education general, suddenly hard know trust comedian regularly shouts ""I'm fucking duuuuumb!""? 

The answer degrade quality scientific information presented. answer educate population enough know know cannot trusted **IN ADDITION TO** total halt bald faced lies public severe punishments betraye public trust rather early retirement traitors get. really gonna act like understand brought dogs? echoing talking point okay call everything ivermectin ""livestock dewormer"". purposely cushioned position changing ""horse dewormer"" ""livestock dewormer"" even though media tends use former rather latter. Either way terms wrong.

I brought dogs take lifestock dewormer, take heartguard, contains ivermectin. Joe Rogan took ivermectin approved Humans FDA.

If hard time nuance, think making right decision exiting conversation. good day.   We're seeing birth Rush Limbaugh's successor Right? doesn’t make sense. matter power hungry people are, don’t shred humanity? many deaths okay with? Joe Rogan know shit fuck  There’s zero variables. think qualify get tested boom. get card like vaccine card marked safe. 
What talking about?  know evolution happening unvaccinated honestly? Also, even U.S. ones essentially herd immunity, countries vaccinated citizens mutations happen anyways evade MRNA vaccine like Read saw happen chickens mean need realize vaccination thing need hang hopes really... case, Betteridge's law headlines wrong /r/rarepuppers   think parents understand risk quite low individually child gets sick. However don’t know yet much worse Delta also could see hospitals totally overwhelmed massive spike cases happening areas, case children may able treated properly. would increase chances poor outcomes. 

Also innocent child dies poor choices adults really one many.  :O  start realizing protect serve motto branding, makes sense

like always going get best buy particular big box store shall named. good luck suing them.  somebody say name? said oddest way ""masks help please save medical professionals"" help medical professionals need them? Alright someone, anyone, mission accept. Whichever Arkham game easier mod, mod Rogans face unto goons. I’m actually ok this. 

Hopefully replacements better officers.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* numbers reported seem really high would someone knows able confirm accurate (from article):

“Over past three months Anne Arundel County, 30% people hospitalized COVID-19 fully vaccinated.

There's similar timeframe trend neighboring Howard County, health officials said roughly 30% 40% people hospitalized COVID-19 fully vaccinated.”    Imagine breaking life long friendships ""the science"" Hoping higher vax rate NE helps. southern states 50%. believe lot NE states 70% help! Fingers crossed bad we'll see cases start subside again, hopefully good! obviously people can't disagree anymore.. sounds like perfectly logical reason throw away 25 years friendship.. comment one voted 😔  imply Fauci mandatory vaccinations? mandatory ""businesses/schools requiring them"" mandatory government mandate capable person get one... make lots lots persecution complex.  Wiki says it’s largest city “North Idaho”, whatever means. there, replying thread wasn’t part would anyone listen Joe Rogan comes health?  fair, also personal choice.

You choose required vaccines school enrollment, choose home school enroll child school vaccine requirements. Rationing? Free Market solve issue, won’t it?  measure state world headline frequency. Look data.  seem different he's always been.  says liability reasons. knows full well he's scamming people trust him. mine's irregular I'm also 44, crapshoot perimenopause vaccine. sometimes 2 weeks apart, sometimes normal 28 days. got 2nd vaccine 30th March So, Joe Rogan ibmecile? knew? /s  repeat myself: rise vaccine resistant strain covid inevitable. mean current vaccines useless, though Delta shock. means we'll need boosters every year, like currently due flu. Joe Rogan comedian? Waste effort. convince one get vaccinated.    What?! don’t accept Joe Rogan’s Google Doctor Certificate evidence education training make medical decisions advice? Eric Fiegl-Ding useful screen door submarine. mean still around? living rock? gotten bigger bigger made money. mean, lymph massage great, especially nodes removed due cancer, feels great. friend talking something like juice cleanse lymph nodes? that's weird.  getting medical advice anyone entertainment industry making mistake. exactly one type person receive medical advice medical professional, 1 1 someone “Dr” next name TV. Medical advice Joe Rogan travel advice cash cab guy. WCGW? went absolute bender

I choose believe alcohol reduced severity breakthrough - alcohol disinfects! :-)   almost like wherever live ""pick poison"" disaster, speak. shit, said entire world unison minus Rogan fans. honestly struggle understand basic math complicated many people. example like comment question states ""death normal"". seems US peaking around 25% death wise compared last winter's peak, cases might peaked around 60%. see exactly story play every country significant vaccination natural immunity coverage. playing exactly every credible scientist predicted. One way another humans acquiring immunity. via vaccination, many via natural infection. Unless something significantly changes virus, we're going experiencing less severe outcomes time goes by.

In words, unless goalpost cases, reason lock down. less less reason time goes by. *shocked Pikachu Face* ""Joe Rogan getting completely wrong"" says expert, professional topic. unvaxxed people problem counties always stay home though :(. get spread kids vulnerable.  Everyone talking absolutes idiot. might idiot accidentally correct side issue, still idiots.

One person recovering Covid taking Ivermectin **IS EVIDENCE**. might shit evidence. might evidence explained variables.

How fucking tough make constant, simple declarations???

""Ivermectin probably jack shit Covid. question ethics doctors prescribe it. People taking horse dewormer idiots."" See? silly absolutes make easy dismiss.   Even Joe Rogan calls dumbass says take advice him… REALLLY dumb refund parents? sad considering even 75 years ago turned country dime support war effort World War II. think would happen social media, apathy droves, conspiracy theories misinformation, corporate interest mixed fucked political public policy? chance. Always trust experts that’s advice. Joe Rogan represents jocks decided wanted try smart. Yeah Fauci wore mask, got vaccinated started wearing two masks. send confusing message. Knowing audience trusts live that, responsibility responsible says got tired, relax. Accupuncture bs, use Tens unit. Ok that's step 1. arrest them. Wow comments extra. Woah. Sure is. Although agree people taking drugs might work. think evidence yet say conclusively work all. think larger trials need conclude Canada something like that. Freedom Expression reasonable limits, like obscenity, hate speech, defamation. I'm pretty certain spreading misinformation harmful public health protected Freedom Expression Oh missed that, yeah definitely agree there.

Really hoping take giant leap forward accessible treatments happens Thank you! one says everyone like kids appreciate looking anyway! Taekwondo kickboxing MMA. would like calling Michael Jordan retired football player they're sports. Yep. Exactly this. Uh yeah. get medical advice comedians used take blows head living ..../s Fraudster We're going see eye eye this. know probably mean well, one missing context here. common misconception Rogan competed UFC/MMA. stopped fighting either things existed continually pushes back idea he's MMA fighter. trying make matter language, not. Sure, call anyone ever sparred trained ""MMA fighter"" point words stop meaning anything?

Colloquially, amateur chef person cooks really well. Professionally, amateur chef called cook. Likewise, ""amateur MMA fighter"" professional term fighters competing within amateur circuit amateur organizations (EAFL example). want colloquially refer anyone ever punched heavy bag MMA fighter, that's cool. conversation wether Joe Rogan MMA fighter, definition pretty useless. Especially man publicly disagrees you.  Aside legal viewpoint, agree Joe liability, moral imperative avoid sharing deadly misinformation platform. bears responsibility saying dangerous things without sufficient evidence, even legal liability so. vaccines safe effective. Breakthrough cases happen approximately 1 10,000 vaccinated people. even get it, illness far less severe. We're way safer 6 months ago.

There still large unvaccinated population they're getting virus. Good news also becoming immune. Would better got vaccinated generally get once. Gee, comedian, former reality tv show host, fight commentator doesn’t know science medicine ? Wear glasses mask keep considering googles 12 family members.  Well, clearly BENEFICIAL EFFECT people say shit. 

We're stupid dude. ""But said one sentence sprinkled!"".... around evasive, damaging rhetoric. Sorry dude, we're stupid. happen? It’s fucking insane. went date weeks back, $100 date (which never offered split check, that’s another day), starts rambling vaccine, population control, rest talking points usually throw you. thought people internet. bizarre.   cult leader liable telling followers drink poisoned kool aid meet God?

No. They're responsible murder. Coercion depending circumstances. saying ridiculous things. think we’re pretty much page, see you’re pro mask wearing even. It’s crazy thing still spreads like crazy even highly vaccinated places like Mass parts Canada. Jokes *always* go right Joes head, he’s bit dumb comes jokes thinks studying comedy like it’s discipline make funnier, reality he’s never funny.  Laws thee, me. “novel virus”

novel = new, unusual desperately need employer mandates everywhere. example, back everyone briefly decided loved essential workers put risk everyone could buy hamburger whatever, seemed like least understood job put risk. risk still requiring vaccine would lower everyone. probably least charitable way possible approach situation. People change minds way Israel first getting population vaccinated many countries caught we're boat. like US 30%+ population reluctant get it, approved kids either. pension age raised 67 maybe, willing work 68? doesn’t matter keep opponents voting you. that’s exactly we’re seeing republican controlled states doing. Republicans aren’t trying win democratic election, they’re trying win single party authoritarian regime.    far tell [Lymph Drainage actually legit. went massage therapist recent surgery, came highly recommended physiotherapist, reduced swelling noticeable amount, even right first treatment. Yeah, know that's totally anecdotal, maybe debate whether worth time money, like *nothing*.

That said, I'd totally open anyone providing sources showing lymph drainage massage quackery. know there's lots going about, best knowledge lymph drainage massage least legit form massage therapy. course not, asking question allowing expert answer appropriate.. questioning experts work, without allowing rebuttal same.. public leads people questioning work.. JAQing off. Well shit Joe Rogan getting wrong. He's former fighter turned comedian. think cool he'd take responsibility words, saying ""I'm moron"", real reason take responsibility. wants audience bunch anti-vaxers that's right guess, clearly benefiting monetarily mean good him.  …what terrible analogy. really feel like post political nature. discourse US insane, development social cues children visually impaired important caution instituting mask mandates reasonable. adults without disabilities masking time, bars gyms shut severely restricted, masking primary schools required. 

In US, course, that's going happen given high transmission is, sane option children wear masks.   Purposefully divisive capitalistic media cause distrust make people seek alternative sources. Look countries high trust government, they're vaccinated.

Those people likely believe someone shares distrust. trust blindly trust doctor without forced research best leads things like this. Joe ask dumb questions experts would pretty cool actually.

Joe's audience dumb dumber is. people need simple concepts explained them.  chiropractors taught viruses exist. part one. Point air vent front face, creating positive pressure   without light bulb rectum? tried arguing “you’re probably gonna throw away anyway, what’s difference”. guess found one nurse area that’s following rules. sky blue grass green Pretty sure that’s he’s all.

Also,
“It noted accusing one's opponent ""just asking questions"" common derailment tactic way poisoning well. Asking questions invalid.”  Thanks help. O2 90 10 minutes morning since returned normal levels. told doc said keep monitoring it. I’m receiving monoclonal antibody treatment tomorrow. know anything that?   get medical advice guy self described “an idiot one listen to.” you’re WAY immune am! Naturally acquired antibodies Covid-19 infection vaccines acquired antibodies less effective Delta variant. It’s rhetorical device sole purpose stressing point making people think actually knows something. Wait, thought us equals? podcast, doesn’t mean word important anybody else’s. 

And regarding Tylenol, apply personal research aspect said took? Tylenol potentially dangerous allergies sensitivities guess nobody ever speak taking it, correct? always level personal accountability taking medications taking sincere medical advice someone classically trained comes risks. Also possible cite endorsed medication manner prescribed it? 

And pertaining son friends, perhaps better education properly verify medical substances treatments necessary. Following someone’s lead falls within level personal responsibility. Verifying medical professionals license good practice ensuring body safe effective. 

Rogan entertainer consumed form entertainment education. someone wants live lifestyle similar him, prerogative. blaming anything total control actions disingenuous deflection responsibility. It’s also emergency use, part reason Joe wouldn’t take vaccine. apparently vaccines hurt us medication bizarre reason. Seems like boy cried wolf type situation. think whole misinformation era stems reporting Trump. Anyone liked trump constantly bombarded articles hating mundane things. 

Eventually stopped giving shit things said. ‘Joe Rogan Getting Completely Wrong'

&amp;#x200B;

This could applied many things. ""Oh no, gave complete control product, unfair!"" financial magazine.. financial magazine talking sponsoring medical article.

""Forbes also reports related subjects technology, communications, science, politics, law.""  see mention reporting medical.

Does raise eye brows?  scientist ever taken MDMA?  anyone take seriously even give straight answer whether even vaccinated? science truth would give info. Instead, remains vague it. Duh?  kind spoiled ass MF'er thinks Frat Party serving Corona literally anything better PBR Nattie Ice grounds ""the worst""?! course care money, gave complete total control podcast included batshit crazy shit he's saying last year half.

You take account vaccination rate age determining efficacy. so, efficacy numbers actually look REALLY good still. ""Joe Rogan Getting Completely Wrong"" name show. well person invented wheel ignored first  party advocated seniors ""ready sacrifice economy"".

I guess Children. 

In meantime, fetus important, potential mother's opinion count.  It’s actually like million Americans died COVID since March 2020.

[Estimation excess mortality due COVID-19](http://www.healthdata.org/special-analysis/estimation-excess-mortality-due-covid-19-and-scalars-reported-covid-19-deaths)

This study estimated 912,345 excess deaths U.S. March 2020 May 2021, time period 	
578,555 reported COVID deaths. proportion held today, would 1,027,000 excess deaths U.S. compared 651,000 reported deaths.

This largely line saw last year, total deaths increasing 500,000 despite 345,000 reported COVID deaths. Total deaths jumped 3.3 million stable 2.7-2.8 million 2015 2019. point spotify becomes culpable, suppose use defense fox used tucker effectively say, ""no reasonable person would believe anything joe says"".

Except reasonable people ones tuned in. It’s called JAQing off, it’s gross. friend wants come Arkansas hunt later year asked vaccinated said no. argued bit said reasoning vaccinated wasn’t political I’d shocked wasn’t political told well can’t come aren’t vaxxed old parents (70, 71) one still recovering cancer. People delusional believe shit evidence. sent “medical journals” haven’t published reviewed peers. random dude Twitter tweets anti vax stuff happened guy? swear used explore ideas outright peddle shit. used thoroughly enjoy crazy shit show got completely behind half  “New studies find people COVID 2020 later received mRNA vaccine mount exceptionally powerful immune response, likely protects circulating coronavirus variants — well ones may emerge future.”

TL;DR - Even you’ve covid already greatly benefit get vaccine. window closed. Finally convinced MIL two weeks ago contracted vaccinated still rough go. FIL still won't. Fox News ""infotainment""  system would considered war crime.  Joe Rogan is, always been, fucking moron, anyone took anything said seriously. gold. Add list.  So….your saying…science needs like better social media presence? recently left last job felt unsafe anti-mask/vax beliefs (and body piercer/tattoo artist, get close clients)… another big reason left beliefs as: clouds aren’t real, Vatican withholding secrets universe basement, trans people possessed Satan drank Diet Coke. Yeah, read last one right. Diet Coke makes people trans, apparently, gave us Diet Coke? Satan… apparently.

I fucking hate conspiracy theorists. used occasional weirdo, fun, it’s half population. sounds like future presidential candidate mate ate huge bowl actual human feces survived COVID. 

**THAT EVIDENCE**  Good idea, might triggered further.   Amazon  What? think guy selling mushroom pills named Alpha Brain scamming people? way... Desperation stinky cologne. fucking idiot listens Joe Rogan (podcast host, former host Fear Factor, WWE commentator, medical scientific background) actual fucking doctors scientists beyond saving. Nothing could possibly convince otherwise save absolute near death.

And even that’s guarantee pronounced image’er emgur? Sort of, entirely true. mABs cultured cell lines. Shocking idiot, self-proclaimed one well, would get wrong. keep consumers addicted quarterly bonuses coming drip-feed marketing control wrapped holiday tradition interrupted? I've snorting horse tranquilizer still gotten COVID. I've snorting stuff years, even. Although I've heard stuff find usually actually cat tranquilizer vets deal cats often horses. TIL Bernie Sanders conservative thought fair amount vaccination there.

Nope:  Seems like stupid reason end 25 year friendship palled around incredibly smart people much convinced himself, smart. enjoy Carl Zimmer. He's written great books genetics (She mother's laugh) viruses (a planet viruses). He's writing NYTimes Covid beginning March 2020. he's bestseller &amp; NYTimes column. gets little traction Twitter although get fair amount me. good science communicators still nowhere near influential pop-culture celebrities. I'm unsee juice  pretty much group friends podcasts (still listen ymh 2 bears) Brandon schaub fighter kid live streamed going 20 mile bike ride day testing positive (before knew really passed airborne) saying can’t shed virus asymptomatic start end able even laugh anymore. eat pieces shit breakfast??......No, pfffft Coke Zero still alright drink? Cycles always predictable, unfortunately. varies lot  Joe Rogan moron. Listening vaccine advice like listening pet turtle vaccine advice clouds aren’t real

They're real birds.  ""The MEDIA tell this!""

""Where *you* hear it, then?"" Oh god media really hate boner Rogan  vulnerable infection really stay home anyway  FrEeDoM! deflect criticism, currently enabling. really believed continue give medical advice. tell you. vaccinated covid 3 weeks ago. Yes has. 97% sequenced cases Delta NYC. difference higher vaccination rate combined greater natural immunity getting slammed first last year, there’s less growth fewer resultant hospitalizations.  following super closely, Reddit posts definitely said Joe took horse dewormer, crazy lol. seems like actually took chemical comically small dose compared ivermectin get say, feed store rural america. needed scientist tell us this? Idk, took calling thumb  yeah mean that's it, right? Like ain't even worth point.  admission, Rogan moron.

That's ""admission"" - that's moral scapegoat need take responsibilities consequences words actions. Fuck Rogan.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's plenty access high quality scientific information, shortage excellent educators transmitting it.

The issue, imo, people prioritize entertainment things.

They'll listen Joe like show right. Screenshot article straight Office, lookin like Michael Scott like flu wrong respiratory infection, similar complications, similar comorbidity. stressed enough flu actually kills thousands year prior mask mandates. avoidable deaths. top that, covid way contagious making deadly.  think agree add on: need improve science literacy, job shouldn’t scientists. busy really commit unfortunately. need expand disciplines bridge gap science public. Creates jobs connects STEM liberal arts. 

I also don’t think it’s fair professionally appropriate call general public stupid. Remember they’re funding us whether like RIGHT access understand data. Both. I've heard multiple vaccine stories, unusual getting sick. Likely something either stressors immune response, it'd nice know results study. feel like conspiracy theorist got romanticized, shows / movies see theorists grab whole rooms attention sometimes right close mark Also bring travel pack wet wipes dollar store, it’s really convenient able wipe hands. cause Rona even hands get sticky I'm glad folks like getting first though! mom autoimmune disorder getting 3rd Sunday (she's thankfully managed dodge COVID whole pandemic despite essential working pharmacy). Agree, still populated state think Rogan agenda, man say stupid shit sometimes.  It’s Pat answers complex problems.

Guess advice didn’t stick right people pay attention K-12, stressful environment filled work, tests, grading variety subjects - along maintaining social network - fighting students' attention.



People learn plenty Church, whether think valuable information subjective. can't argue way information presented much easily digested wider audience. got covid hear contact tracer 5 days called tell time take info phone fill survey text ask I'd all. asked *who* thought got from, basically. Something something perdition something something good intentions. Yeah, gotta point. science communication times pretty frustrating... fight outside training, many many many many years. Hes martial artist commentator (and comedian/podcaster/entrepreneur onnit part-ownership). couple black belts taekwando fights decades past qualify 'mma fighter', rather martial artist ;) Social distancing, suppression mask wearing need continue minimum 6 months year longer us hope eradicating much dangers associated here.

Where pull number time of? Six months year certainly wouldn’t even eradicate Covid US, let alone rest world. point isn’t avoid ever case Covid ever, it’s gain control virus people inevitably catch symptoms mild negligible, vaccines still largely do. Dude work thris field thid shity virus, deadly beginning. companies play results keep patients coming becauee gov pay also wanna vax maximum reduce number humanity. Oddly enough gets triggered, discussions completely calm lost got checked agent traveling country needed quarantine 14 days sayin' shit like ""welcome soviet Canada, starts"". Even though knew coming Canada would would happen first 14 days.

Like ""soviet canada"", people ever checked quarantining travellers, citizens checked point pandemic ever asked govt ""please stay home please wear mask indoors"". Even citizens checked on(which weren't), pandemic, every day life. Except asked made mistake fixing LMAO edited last comment well. didn’t even go hospital. simply bought needed pocket. narrative something like “if you’re healthy, young workout, need. Nothing. 

But, got tons disposable income throw look. worked”  topless women muscular men speedos providing accurate scientific news

I intrigued...  got second dose Pfizer yesterday terrible night: fever 101, horrible chills body aches. got fever 99.5 morning fell asleep, it’s 102.3. normal worry? Everyone know said sore arm. Scientists responding Joe Rogan validation Joe Rohan’s opinion may carry validity.

This makes absolutely sense sounds like something Joe Rogan would say podcast justify Ivermectin. I'm expert lymphatic system anything, though surprised does. provide link. mayo data break age. percentages jump substantially remove kids. 3 week long period 1st dose. seriously annoying. Thankfully, I'm back normal now. Sorry hear that! Stay safe remember: 

A disciplined mind leads happiness, undisciplined mind leads suffering.” – Dalai Lama worth, prominent Covid scientists (e.g. Eric Topol) going nuts, begging gov't start compiling data national level.

From statements, take situation that, yes, data exists, but, no, collected analyzed. maddening.

”It’s virus, it’s tiny thing. You’re much bigger virus, aren’t you? Dont afraid talk it.” watched clip talking buddy CNN accusing taking horse de-wormer (ivermectin). stated got DOCTOR pondering ""do need sue CNN?"" joke (I assume). Either way, whatever taking prescribed. Now, REAL morons ones buying ivermectin stores meant horses using shit. know qualities ivermectin humans, know uses humans. Also, reality fun, time reality boring. pandemic social distance, put mask, take vaccine wait ? Nah, they'd much rather imagine there's virus 5G towers, vaccines microchip whole covid thing actually coverup something else. lives need dramatic, otherwise entertaining.  mean that’s response reads, “no don’t (need improve)”. 

Totally agree there’s literally fatal levels stupidity ignorance deal with. there’s big fat chunk population reached keep trying. I’m actually 8 days since symptoms first began  parents fuckin' stupid, yeah, gonna hard save kids. likely they'll end stupid well. long term thing would take generationS (plural) work. Yeah I'm avoiding anything 72 hr requirement showed less 48 hours exposure, 4 vaccinated people work infected. Things went shit spotify. used get live podcasts!   also possible person infected multiple strains exposed multiple strains once.

When happens, possible two strains virus swap genes process called antigenic shift theory could get hybrid variant infectiousness Delta vaccine resistance Lambda, Mu new variant. Usually university this, use underpaid non-scientists inevitably get things wrong. Joe Rogan’s show massive source pseudo science. 

Nothing wrong little chat people dumb door there’s millions listening even dumber thinking show full facts … bad combo. way hold parents responsible toddler gets access firearm.

Spotify giving Rogan platform, endorsing brand idiocy. Still better alternative ""I'm expert, listen me."" Remember immune system comprised lots lots Benjamins Ok, agree, even plausible thought process. 

It's equivalent advising people feed sharks immediately sharks future might learn fly.

This people getting conned wrong guy mic, people willfully malignantly burning everything sight ground home grown acts terrorism. fixed it?

When people say fixed something, absolutely implication trying right along, except delusions  think people would saying instead upvoting me. might projecting, sweaty. It’s getting real hard keep going. control till everyone decided done pandemic. callouss it’s real hard. Please get vaxx. Fuck joe rogan. Popularity scientific correctness apart. Again, fuck joe roqan. Makes perfect sense. would same. vax rate low infection rates extremely high, I'm taking careful measures accordingly. Sadly, town small, overpriced college people come go state even overseas, cringe thought spreading must going on. virus seems largely ignored here. want take moment us think back simpler time years ago flat earthers dumbest group people knew about. Pretty tame harmless bu comparison.  Thank sparing trouble. Elk meat kettlebell exercise kills virus guys Joe Rogan lot far-left beliefs, mostly socialized medicine UBI. lump far right. He's brand idiot. love family despite opinions vaccines really hope get make it.

Just think saying here. fully vaxxed little risk serious outcomes, even without booster, yet would willing never see relatives stay ""safe"". Please look true risks would sacrificing see them. maliciously throws shit wall tries piss people get worked him. truly want defeat stupidity, completely ignore him. 100% communication, Reddit posts, news stories. ignore him. Drives type person absolutely bonkers. It’s going keep mutating regardless. SARS-Cov-2 never going away. freaking moron That's anyone, comedians. spend enough time person, whether person medium podcasts, see really are. think ""straight-A student"" much it, I've seen thing intelligent people. flaws. watched clip told story getting/having it. said flew town, massive sold arena show, drank night long (likely crowded) pool hall. sure, 4th drink gave COVID. dummy. Joe Rogan idiot. Bet hes gonna come say DMT cure covid next something equally moronic. totally, weird intersection Chakras MMA    Elderly people understandably excluded trial. given data now, booster shots vulnerable populations clearly prudent policy. Even 7-10x decreased likelihood severe infection risk still high unvaccinated 50 year-old.  Ok, doubled this, I'll bite. 

If education answer, then? DMT 20 years, Mushrooms, Ingesting RIGHT media sources melt anything Hi all. **I request data chart.** I'm interested data **showing community spread changed colleges reopened**. I'm imagining chart X axis something like, ""days start school year,"" Y-axis ""cases per 100k"" 0 case rate schools opened. So, lines begin origin, different lines different colleges (or counties?) trend right, likely rising around 2-3 weeks school starts. anyone seen kind chart effect? Thank you!   (30F) similar experience well. Normal cycle whole life (except birth months, expected). Missed period month second Pfizer shot back April, little heavier/ painful ever since resumed. Still glad vaccinated!  point gave knowing it. nothing realistic trying never even table. Plus alpha certainly possible, Delta it’s totally different.

Plenty countries maintained 0 little cases totally control. *And then, people United States pushing mask mandates children. data using extraordinarily skimpy--in fact, essentially nonexistent. hearing CDC say things like 'maybe delta variant damage kids,' information presented publicly damange done kids... reason told damage kids can't scare adults enough. cannot scare adults enough, we're going mask kids.*

Here, read. I'm going copy/paste seems deleted exceptionally common, people run animals carry often. Skunks especially, bats.

Let paint picture.

You go camping, midday decide take nap nice little hammock. sleeping, tiny brown bat, ""rage"" stages infection fidgeting broad daylight, uncomfortable, thirsty (due hydrophobia) snort, startling him. goes attack mode.

Except asleep, he's little brown bat, weighs around 6 grams. even feel land bare knee, starts bite. teeth tiny. Hardly enough even break skin, manage give equivalent tiny scrape goes completely unnoticed.

Rabies travel blood. fact, blood test even tell got it. (Antibody tests may done, useless ever vaccinated.)

You wake up, none wiser. notice anything bite site all, assume lightly scraped something.

The bomb lit, nervous system wick. rabies multiply along nervous system, virtually damage, completely undetectable. literally symptoms.

It may four days, may year, camping trip likely long forgotten. one day back starts ache... maybe get slight headache?

At point, already dead. cure.

(The sole caveat Milwaukee Protocol, leaves patients dead anyway, survivors mentally disabled, seldom done).

There's treatment. 100% kill rate.

Absorb that. single virus planet 100% kill rate. rabies. symptomatic, over. dead.

So look like?

Your headache turns fever, general feeling unwell. fidgety. Uncomfortable. scared. virus taken time getting brain finds vast network nerve endings, begins rapidly reproduce, starting base brain... ""pons"" located. part brain controls communication rest brain body, well sleep cycles.

Next become anxious. still think mild fever, suddenly find becoming scared, even horrified, occur know why. rabies chewing amygdala.

As cerebellum becomes hot virus, begin lose muscle coordination, balance. think maybe good idea go doctor now, assuming doctor smart enough even run tests necessary days left planet, odds they'll able tell loved ones died later.

You're twitchy, shaking, scared. normal fear knowing what's going on, virus really fucking amygdala amplified hundred fold. around time hydrophobia starts.

You're horribly thirsty, want water. can't drink. Every time do, throat clamps shut vomit. become legitimate, active fear water. thirsty, looking glass water begins make gag, shy back fear. contradiction hard hot brain see point. now, doctors put IVs keep hydrated, even that's futile. dead second headache.

You begin hearing things, hearing thalamus goes. taste sounds, see smells, everything starts feeling like horrifying acid trip anyone ever on. hippocampus long attack, trouble remembering things, especially family.

You're alone, hallucinating, thirsty, confused, absolutely, undeniably terrified. Everything scares literal shit point. strange people lab coats. strange people standing around bed crying, keep trying get ""drink something"" crying. week since little headache completely forgotten. Time means nothing anymore. Funny enough, know bat felt bit you.

Eventually, slip ""dumb rabies"" phase. brain started process shutting down. much turned liquid virus. face droops. drool. unaware what's around you. sudden noise light might startle you, part, stare ground. really slept 72 hours.

Then die. Always, die.

And there's one... fucking... thing... anyone you.

Then there's question corpse. mean, sure, burying right thing do. fucking virus survive corpse years. could kill every rabid animal planet today, two years now, moist, preserved, rotten hunk used-to-be brain gets eaten animal, starts over.

So yeah, rabies scares shit me. fucking EVERYWHERE. (Source: Spent lot time working rabies. Would still get vaccinations could afford them.) would friends people deny reality spread dangerous propaganda? He's tried comedy. mean he's comedian. That’s legal defense Fox News uses crap Carlson says. He’s entertainer watched responsible people believing says. 

When you’ve got audience millions give weight words expert it’s irresponsible disingenuous hide behind occasional disclaimer entertainer. Cool Blues aint thing uterus apparently apart immune system vaccines causing temporary change period immune reaction seems line that. Although it’s ridiculous vaccine research someone consider periods tell unvaccinated people mutations occurring weird certain...

In opinion, Unless testing vaccinated people generating contagious contacts, simply know, bet delta new variants happened vaccine. 

But unless contagiousness mutation study vaccinated people way know vaccinated people moving freely vector mutation, especially people vaccinated. contagiousness new variants. People Arkansas pretty belligerently anti mask best apathetic vaxx. Wouldn’t suggest. Reminds one scene Animated Series bad guy walks Batman room glares him. Bad guy quickly closes door, turns around, walks away, says ain't seen shit. 

Smartest villain entire series. Even hospitals empty, want going reason, that's point. 

Broken bones, stitches, hospital bound due COVID.... one things likely other? I’m really surprised someone like Joe Rogan getting wrong. /s    So? one popular shows television NewsRadio.  recent weeks, officials throughout Central Valley, produces one-quarter nation’s food, sounded alarm toll pandemic.

""The virus obviously even close bad thought would be""

""SO got covid immediately threw everything kitchen sink it.. [lists absurd drug cocktail]"" heading ""good news""! Playing dumb interviews actually good way spread information audience. host don’t accept good information continue say stupid shit, aren’t good job informing audience. Contact tracing, I've sick couple times, launched covid passport May get test every 72 hours could go gym bars/restaurants. got vaccinated end May I've one test since then. ones talking go google South Korea UK’s cases. wat  I'll agree. like hides fact he's entertainer. However live place people get news memes facebook. So, abandon hope.  proved point. Nobody getting vaccine advice Joe Rogan. person exist stood said following Joe Rogan vaccine advice. Like, literally happened. Waste time even think would. Go ahead downvote folks, truth. Less time spent nonsense ( obviously media tool even bring news media) better faster get right. Look idiots butt hurt get sicker. Ya'll lowest low. Guy gets day could madder.  tactic held responsible. reality says incredible weight. knows that. He's fucking stupid aspect. social leverage heart negotiation Spotify. better go tell husband never got married apparently kid? 🤨 TRT? HGH? He's brand idiot.

he definitely that.   problem expertise based trust. people knowledge assess certain claims science takes years study order get it. people believe say much sway public opinion anyone else. Given growing mistrust people media organizations surprising we're seeing.   agree critical thinking skills necessary overall, also think certain degree constitutes expert largely determined societal level--something good education helps instill larger level across population, even people stupid.

For instance, suspect part popularity antivaxxers well-founded distrust large pharmaceutical companies disaster American healthcare system. antics Sacklers mean vaccinate children, make determining trust difficult. difficult ensure people society parse subtleties context go long way properly regulated pharmaceutical industry actually trusted. Idahoan here. What's really crazy people anything it. People going around nothing happening. work university I've instructed teach class like normal year, except masks. there's 50 students room normal class. Half students vaccinated. local hospital build temporary covid ward deal extra cases full couple times already overflowing soon.

People done even trying stop Covid point. plot Last Us? moment, happening unvaccinated. That's majority cases are. That's majority transmission. Every time virus replicates, mutate. evolution is, right now, occurring body people vaccinated   OP taking something Rogan said sarcastic/joking tone made established fact. far know, committed suing really knows. 

 originated recent episode. [Source: first 30 seconds. Yep, sudden racist far right ideologies, anti-vax, holistic medicine, thinking Canada going way Soviet Union peace officer checked quaranting travel. since pandemic. 

Yeah, that's took. Shocking right?  Thank anecdote. felt terrified fall asleep entire time covid one else understood meant. body would jolt awake like something wrong like sure would wake up. one worst parts. fully vaccinated 6 months caught 3.5 weeks later I'm still foggy headed, sore/fatigued, experiencing nosebleeds almost every morning.  knew made mistake corrected would act like made mistake. Cmon man stop disingenuous think issue went interviewing intellectuals thinking one. distrust ""authority"", yet authority people echo chamber. He's kinda gone Eddie Bravo beliefs. Yes, think too. cold chain primary issue, think halting booster shots fix that, plan improve cold chain logistics  one funniest threads ever Considering infection rate virus, would've appeared sooner later. throwing towel, realistic. Fever certainly possible side effect vaccine. fever roughly 101 6-8 hours broke second dose. 

It’s safe take Tylenol/Advil reduce fever need. get concerned, call doctor.  also took monoclonal antibodies, far best treatment option covid. reason take Ivermectin. precovid. last ~2 years he's gone rails. forgetting much time passed. start fire Glad hear it, stay safe! Whether likes not, highly influential public figure. intelligence audience bearing responsibility society.

Every public figure responsibility speak carefully accurately speak all.

Unfortunately, many unable unwilling live that. know people lives antiquated views (even horrible) deep know good people? point realize winning over; although feels like moral failure fight back. feel like that's what's happening Joe Rogan. still can't help admire way lives life. he's become rhetoristician dangerous ideas; especially comes health. idea racist grandparents isolated family (mostly) Grandpa one successful podcasts ever problem is.  area masks even required school. fun watch numbers increase exponentially schools nobody seems give shit send daughter cesspool. Luckily kids, including friends, wearing masks feel awkward... still worried she'll get sick. Probably going bring downvotes unnecessary '/s' I've ever seen... already using vernacular created purely intention sarcasm. do, recreation requires lungs working properly imagine sitting sauna going quick swim cold water treated cure Nordic countries.

That’s probably way base based stereotypes though. Bill Burr called year ago. ""Oh tough guy, exposed nostrils throat"" OK, person article making pretty bold statements, right? said evolution happening unvaccinated community that's majority cases are. There's way make statement absolute certainty, irresponsible say so. fine wanted wait evidence need boosters young healthy, they've sitting data starting impact elderly risk now. 

If talking new version vaccine, safety studies another developed nation, yeah case data. Here, evidence justified booster vaccine month ago minimum elderly high risk. CIA knew something Wuhan November 2019 least.  China held alerting world happening late. Case counts declining winter.  respected self awareness honesty *before* entered pandemic. like not, pandemic changed things everyone, ignorance isnt nearly benign used be. show reaches millions people instead either A. Avoiding talking covid completely B. Going extra mile properly educate listeners, chose run mouth things understanding of. important Rogan opinion everything right anything. brother isn’t vaccinated either. Watches Rogan. nothing (may reinforce every often), he’s moron well lol. anything, already bum life working out. Covid excuse now. he’s knee deep conspiracy… It’s absolutely correct word use. problem refusing use least 2-3 weeks last year met criteria labeling such. US centralized vaccine registry. individual provider keep record it. Ah yes, bald moron cherry-picks information horribly conducted studies specifically invites guests echo idiotic world views validate spineless worshippers. ashamed actively injected discussion business first place. cannot cured though.

Remission type 2 diabetes [possible weight [considered intervention occurs within years onset always says he’s doctor take medical advice him. don’t get people thing he’s giving away medical advice No. Ivermectin approved humans. horse paste not. 

Having said there’s still insufficient evidence say whether Ivermectin work covid. studies conclude ivermectin positive inconclusive. Patients using ivermectin also used therapies time like regeneron may vaccinated… 

not whole lot data ivermectin thing confirmed unvaccinated used treat successfully body choice. know common anti-whatever talking point really want understand sake optimism. Wtf going Isreal? First model nation high volume vaccine uptake seemed going well cases hospitalizations apparently skyrocketed higher ever been? like 80%+ eligible population already first dosed least?  Depending WHAT?

Is state US really contact tracing point? Looks like guy ice gum commercial Thank Jooey\_K  there's never opportunity Covid ""Zero"".

New Zealand seems handled pretty well.  think good comedy requires real intelligence introspection.  successful comedians making fun constantly. people take seriously like come on. comedian Surprised pikachu face. necessarily opposed vaccines. They're opposed following rules enforce others. That's big perk job one selling points. 
I would bet lot cops avoiding feel obligated use position avoid *any* rule regulation can. principle matter!  
New York City general took Covid seriously beginning implemented sorts measures combat city-wide, even could wear masks distance. know *never* wore masks? NYPD. pro ivermectin, clinical trials use done areas world. think would better acknowledge state ineffectiveness based evidence rather repeating ""horse dewormer"", exactly true. balanced places like Denver (where live) 80% vaccinated lot people still voluntarily mask. That's metro area 3 million people. 

I moved South Carolina thankful get ride thing here.    Country. Literally (nearly) country. place contact tracing program Hawaii. unfortunately anything else mentioned.  “I fever last night took Tylenol fever gone”

Did give medical advice?       point easy ""other"" antivaxxers.

More harmful society terrorist organization.

I Yeah know sure feels like    ahhhh. thank you. Dude comedian. scientist. 

If expect real information…you’re idiot. enough stop spread virus completely guarantee people contract COVID.

At least two doses Delta. limited data third shots seem provide least short-term immunity even asymptomatic (detectible) infection Delta. guarantee even then, enough give herd immunity (if people would get shots shortages depending location) unlike 2-shot many people putting much emphasis vaccinations roaming around freely letting guard down. though - vaccinations magic ticket freedom all.

Especially people risk. unfortunate messaging ""if vaccinated, unmask go back group activities"" right Delta reached hear strongly countered message longer reasonable advice. original advice made sense people 70+ first place still several million active cases country. distancing, suppression mask wearing need continue minimum 6 months year longer us hope eradicating much dangers associated here.

Some people would find easier put restriction tied specific goals set national level (to adjusted variants change). challenge would multiple criteria go decision: hospital stress, vaccination rates, new case numbers, active case numbers, previous infection immunity levels, etc. country, think point since March could reasonable restrictions yet. Even lowest point year, still millions people infected. meant least largest events requiring proof vaccination masks 

But parts country today good enough vaccination rates low enough hospitalization rates could go pretty limited restrictions (such requiring vaccinations go inside anywhere including schools regular testing staff residents long-term care facilities) that's fair... like 0.5% margin. Lot idiots sure, even close 98%. vaccine works fine, plus it’s getting outcompeted oblivion delta. It’s “just starting spread everywhere”…it already said it’s declining.

If you’re lying awake night worrying beta gamma, there’s reason lose sleep one either.  want scientist UFC commentator one night. say “great! Now, everyone stay fucking lane!”  Same, without sensory issues. 👍 stand this: can't add points intelligence *and* charisma ykwim?  Insert Ham gif 30 Rock   play like Spanish flu? Oh dear God, why?! said podcast today vaccines work. Wtf even. know people got covid end last year, didnt get vaccinated right away. believed still immunity covid. people getting vaccinated. think portion newly vaccinated group. covid, fine, im immune need shot? Maybe closer herd immunity think. least non delta. Come bro. 100s dollars much. Look much pretty much every medical treatment US costs. Hell, covid vaccines obviously subsidised, can't treatment also be, especially expensive?  state wasting oxygen. admit using term like ""unlinked"" maybe inappropriate misleading. link hospitalizations cases *absolutely* changed signifigantly better. ~70% Mass population (not eligible, population) fully vaccinated

This translates infection probability vaccinated: Pv =X* 0.4/0.66 = 0.6 X 

for unvaccinated Pn=X*0.6/0.34=1.8*X

(where X total number cases divided population)

So, vaccination lowers chance infection almost 3x... horrible day eyes. Like, mean problem effect ever problem like moral/ethical failing? Cause definitely first absolutely latter. constantly says he’s moron 

Except knows MMA 99.99999% world.

Has succeeded comedy acting millions failed.

Has built successful podcast date.

I complain would like Elon Musk saying: ""Hur dur I'm idiot chimp know love electric cars outer space. I'm responsible shit goes bad! knew idiot let it!""

Eventually Joe admit podcast influences lot people.  Call doctor, meantime rest sports exercise/exertion several days (rest first thing mentioned treatment vaccine-induced myocarditis, easy start resting). Joe Rogan happens people confuse question asking intelligence. pinch, actual cuts too! guy said immune system handel COVID fine second go COVID ran hospital ever treatment could possibly get? This, got covid weeks ago. Felt pretty sick couple days, nothing *too* bad fine day 3. 

Meanwhile unvax neighbor hometown hospital forever probably isn’t going make 😞 PEOPLE ACCEPT 
that proof Negative Test EQUAL vaccination.

We need vaccination proof getting in.  That's fair enough point. edit post additional information. personally can't stand calling anything ivermectin related horse dewormer feel weakens argument use.  get degree science communication now. Unfortunately still young discipline, experts get respect visibility deserve. couple friends - one got relegated writing press releases English company allowed touch social media (mistake!) Another worked dream job major government organization, quit frustration boss let job unfettered kept screwing up. Man, show fun listen to, needs stop “I’m fucking idiot, don’t listen me” talk. That’s saying “not asshole but” acting ass. damage still done audience take literal. Basically, it’s unvaccinated. really, usually given patients asked it. Joe Rogan mult-multimillionaire checking hospital.

He paying round clock staff, nurses, equipment, etc home 3 days, maybe more. That’s cost came from.    Thank you, you’re lords work. Can't wait see top r/rareinsults later  He's really turning pun thread __un-porcine__ say least.  tough man image ""drug good"" message appeals lot 12-25 year old males. huge market.   Yes! started wearing glasses work them! Entropy inevitable seems r/JoeRogan already working furiously discredit enjoy memes 2nd grade reading levels.. course read entire thing  Louis Theroux absolute king interviewing, bloody legend! Part philosophy viruses exist.  would keep eye contact doctor. side effect rare obviously hard worry. can't stop worrying make appointment go urgent care get EKG evaluation.

My kids got covid vaccine 16 18 neither side effects. However, son later got MMR booster kicked ass, fever 103 sick 2 days. problem understanding ""communicate better"" means. yang, gabbard too. would say guests lean left since left. honestly don’t know hell going on. interviews sides, gives equal footing talk. possibly seen bad thing? Joe Rogan GOOP men.    saw mentioned Ben Shapiro. case know, Ben Shapiro grifter hack. find anything he's said compelling, keep mind also says things like like build. Arabs like bomb crap live open sewage. difficult issue.

Ugh yeah that’s tough. wonder they’ve keeping stats stuff, would love dive data Holy shit rogans brain must completely melted point. believe even asked twice. Joe Rogan getting something wrong? I'm shocked tell you, shocked! 

Seriously though idk anyone gives time day he's approachable Ben Shapiro  Making mandatory workplaces, events travel seem direction we’re going in. 

It’s personal choice wear clothes, nobody’s going force you, good luck participating society you’re dead set them. comedians supposed funny? I’m mechanic. give advice maintaining car automotive advice personal advice? Dude wtf lol cloves kitchen work at. gonna ever lol there's enemy rally ourselves, deal well self-accountability.

This Trump trying hardest pin COVID China, could channel anger onto country personally viewed enemy. Yeah haven’t read much either  It’s still soon smug things looking up.

“Health officials leery suggesting reduction disease sustained California given factors reopening schools, children staff returning classrooms time since pandemic began 18 months ago.” brother likely adult ruined show wasn’t even popular years ago. Sounds like almost smart Joe Himself. Aug 30, 2021, CDC report 173,000,000 fully vaccinated people around 10,000 Covid related hospitalizations around 2,000 Covid related deaths.

The risk hospitalization death covid vaccinated person wildly, fantastically low. hope helps.  agree, can’t state fact, clue that’s true not. Yeah, don’t think guys really care accuracy.  going listen word say don’t even require vaccine employees. Found covid variant really hope people attendance vaccinated all. get willies every time hear big, crowded event. It’s entirely possible.  interesting post details vaccines origin delta variant. people taking meds always bring India, virus mutated unvaccinated lol “let’s look India” horse meds cure rona Gosh, can’t foresee circumstances could happen…… Like Alex Jones. ""Don't take kids away act.""

Or uncountable people got away ""well reasonable person would believe me."" I’d expand anyone believes feelings serious issues outweigh 99.99% scientists doctors telling them. caught clip Tom Segura, guess first podcast ""back"". Seemed super misleading claiming ""Look me, feel great"" response media's reports Ivermectin &amp; taking it. guy took host stuff, I'm willing bet Ivermectin zilch cure him. Also funny hearing started taking meds day tested positive; medicine stand-by something boasting weeks prior around, ""lifestyle"" kept safe.   fact aren’t perfect take away marvels science medicine.

This anecdotal experience, every person rags vaccines 110% effective preventing forms disease people conveniently forgot/ never knew yearly suite Flu Vaccines far less effective (40-67% effective preventing ILI vs Covid Shots 90%+ effective preventing serious illness Covid).

At first tried explain like influenza covid shots, gave nearly giving concussion facepalming hard.. Hey, heard guy blows goats. true? dumb, relate him. kind brain trusts people, concepts. hinges buzzwords understanding ""mainstream"" thinking usually wrong. 

They're dumb, exposed many grifters entire worldview grifters.

Like Republicans HARDCORE Democrats.  Well anyone really surprised? Im ‘Murica, freedom speech argument irrelevant me. Spewing misinformation severity covid downplaying toll virus health, short term long term extremely irresponsible.  “Evolution, moment, happening unvaccinated. That's majority cases are. That's majority transmission. Every time virus replicates, mutate. evolution is, right now, occurring body people vaccinated. Rogan completely wrong trying deduce anything else.”

I understand say that? Can't still transmit contract Covid even vaccinated? might see symptoms little. still infected infect. virus still replicating vaccinated, means evolution still happening. Maybe argument made unvaccinated infected people causing evolution, case make argument instead. Saying things like completely ruins credibility.  could go wrong. outdoor event, great number poeple already vaccine someone translate English? haha  got heaviest period life getting fully vaccinated. Almost called dr concerned extremely heavy was, remembered side effect. actually scary though. could that. first child profiled article cannot/ wear mask, every child school must wear one protect him? Bad choice example. Let downvotes come, exactly type child home schooled. rest children suffer day masks one? Bunch people punching air screaming take Joe Rogan seriously taking everything says seriously outraging lol.  many tests? Close contact someone sick? regular periodic testing? Symptoms?

I've gotten one (USA) looks like man enjoys mentos Fucking trash world live people need even respond level ignorant misinformation. Rogan deserve platform spew bullshit probably responsible plenty deaths pandemic.

There lot people need thrown prison.   heard Joe Rogan, read article now. listening silly dmt guy make everyone mindless sycophant can’t think own? Mmm   love literally one got everyone pronouncing ""mew.""  Hmmm yeah. got went Iraq. 96%+ current covid hospitalizations unvaccinated individuals.  


right now, one type person getting vaccine.  


I live city, least, minority populations majority vaccinated, rural counties around us feel pain. Similar situation. Keep going bro, protect kids. Keep mind we're talking binge drinking (i.e., benders). [Moderate amounts actually shown neutral beneficial terms immune function. 

We'll leave bacon this, there's argument made potential ill effects deprivation there.  one shot J&amp;J. far I've heard much compares others regards breakthrough infections.  vernacular 

Are sarcastic? really dumb drive drunk, yet make laws it.    8+ days 102 fever rough measure

Even ""mild"" still affecting people like particularly nasty influenza infection... weak fever absolutely brutal.  learned ways studying Alex Jones. knows he's market he's capitalizing on. 

American Idiots. [poultry] industry hammered virus. made discovery 1960s way vaccinate saved industry fortune,” says Read. “[It] kept many, many chickens dying horrible deaths. absolutely terrific. 10 years, evolution caused problems required different vaccine, developed quickly. held another 10 years. **the third generation vaccine chicken nuggets still cheap.”**

Burying lead. 

DO TENDIES!!!  Rand Paul least actual doctor. Yeah, people influenced anything. friends, families, book, video, etc. It’s person individual form thoughts. wouldn’t listen Joe Rogan take word gospel. I’d listen agree least think it. least he’s guy sharing opinions world, discussing freely, opposed conglomerate networks funded people deliberately lie profit. People wan’t harp he’s ALWAYS stuff used celebrate hypocrites imo. It’s fault average person stupid they’d go overdose something without medical supervision based said, meanwhile unlike media twisting be, human grade Ivermectin that’s approved human use things research currently effectiveness Ivermectin inhibiting covid cells replicating cavities body (the way worms parasites would them, example).

But that’s besides point. think could put disclaimer video people, fault catching covid treating effectively?   Nah fear factor gave joe bulk money UFC/spotify.    could go wrong Cool comment. like made confirm 18 erotic image. don’t think I’ve seen anything less erotic time.   much time spent sauna.  Andrew Read scientist question. keeps low profile, far tell social media all.

He obviously antivaccine guy, authored papers like ""Why drug resistance readily evolve vaccine resistance not?"" ""get vaccinated PSA back early days vaccine rollout chicken paper loved antivaccine movement, gave interesting accessible hour long interview American Society Microbiology back 2018.  highly recommend anyone looking general understanding correction pedantic material, irresponsible. real ""vaccinated carrier community''. vaccinated people carry, qualify demographic even loosest methodology. 

 practically nothing world free exceptions low-order possibilities. people making reddit posts. communicating information regular people. Regular people need 15mins caveats disclaimers keep jumping yelling ""gotcha"" generalized statement.

If indepth back forth someone, might little technical. trying fix fuck up, fast.   ""But Thanksgiving?!?"" turned ""But Christmas?!?"" turned ""But New Years?!?"" 

And 150k people died. tell experience training study design interpretation medical studies yes problem. I’m going get full lecture statistical analysis first foremost one major flaws study calculating power, establishing number needed study arm determine statistical significance. yes number treatment arnms, problem. well conducted study simply throw 6 different treatments wall see sticks. conduct study hypothesis null hypothesis. wonder one 6 treatments anything. single best type study always going double blind randomized study, clear inclusion/exclusion criteria clear statistical analysis protocol prior study starting. 

Also want lot “hundreds” participants arm. That’s whole point literature analysis. decisions make medical practice serious consequences people’s health don’t take shitty trial say hey looks good enough. fully scrutinize study incorporate practice.

As far principle study goes, release part protocol early data actually see study conducted would valid not. necessarily mean fear factor good I'll add really dumb think handful people get science medical news stand comedian. shit going ways! people think we're smarter animals, least animals smart enough avoid disease.  expect? comedian.

Hold now. Always. comes medicine make people go school 8+ years become doctors. Healthcare personal choice, understanding healthcare conversation actual experts person. peddling coronavirus misinformation fault person peddling it. people think Rogan giving expertise, responsible that. makes sense highly vaccinated state. bolded, right sentence transmission increases likelihood mutation. Thankfully, COVID-19 Vaccines reduce transmission reduce opportunity mutation.

It's right end moment, vast majority replication happening unvaccinated people. tell majority cases hospital unvaccinated individuals. evolutionary action happening moment.”  Like said small slice getting vax. problem they're loud obnoxious like crazies. agree surprised people's vax status, especially politics line similar mine. Freedom speech applies every human being.

In opinion view it’s irresponsible. others simply countering/questioning proportion fear around covid. I’m saying spreading misinformation good responsible, also can’t ignore many mild outcomes. times conflicting information one side ever got main narrative one would able think question anymore. That’s opinion.

Let opinion.  even 'education' sense understanding scientific reasoning, people need taught trust experts. That's trade-off living vastly complex society person possibly grasp components, medicine, construction, programming, etc. social framework US far deteriorated (in part due lack basic education) people longer so. Or, problem he's monster suckered can't accept it. putting alternative. actually needs both. Vaxxed negative test ftw! Vaccines give magic immunity card. Anyone catch COVID, vaccine body fight much quickly effectively (less damage respiratory system example).

This effectively means period transmissibility much much less. medical professionals also advocate wearing masks, masks work best reducing transmission airborne disease infected person.

Joe works absolutes, stops ""vaccinated people still transmit disease"". Life black white, 100% wrong, missing **LOT** nuance, likely, misrepresenting purpose. message portrays is: vaccines work. logical fallacy, medically disingenuous. Honest question here: wrong beat Covid ?  get wrong, knock glasses makes feel better. that's plane circulation really works. ""Everywhere"" plane return vent - essentially constant line vents sides plane. place air goes. [relatively distributed throughout plane actually circulates back cargo bay exiting plane recirculating HEPA. worried, sit aisle seats (or widebody, center seats) least ""touches"". 

An N95 fine plane personal protection. I'd worried stagnant air airport (security line, boarding gate, jet bridge) plane itself. Planes completely safe (contrary airline marketing nonsense), safer almost relatively crowded areas fact air recycles completely every 2 minutes (as opposed couple times hour spaces). People do. Science doesn't. That's pop scientific headlines sensationalist bullshit people misunderstand get angry actual scientist speaks says ""no mean all."" sign fight anti-vaxxers? *”I never roller bladed.”*

*”You don’t body type dude, fucking knuckles would scrape ground.”*

I don’t watch Joe’s podcast much anymore, Bill Burr one favourite comedians. small segment podcast one funniest things I’ve seen long while. want Bill Burr back material lol, thankfully though, podcast also really good laidback. Tbf immunologists disagree notion third booster.

As annual, we'll see months. Oh man he's almost year since first shot already Well mean Satan plot whole ""new coke"" idea let Coke switch sugar corn syrup. gotta give credit one. 

But Diet Coke? fuck? think Coke run actual Satan? Satan Worshippers? 

Please please ***please*** tell drink regular Coke too. That'd fucking hysterical. 

""Satan uses Diet Coke make people Trans, regular Coke company made machines totally okay work Satan.""

At certain point gotta cut people life become stupid. There's fixing them. drank diet coke penis fell off! must exhausting trying keep fantasy world going. Rogan got covid vaccine.

For anybody confused, called ""*jogan*"".

It's recurring meme Joe Rogan podcast constantly. 

Similar ""*joke*"", except based reality way, rather attempt humor simply presented fact.

It's totally lie though, because, ""hey man, I'm asking questions okay, I'm comedian, I'm *jogan*"". would take advice stool fucking through, he's shown proficient I'm saying there's room improvement, certain people there's language technique use make understand complex topucs. (many?) people beyond repair.  something happens women get sick sometimes? vaccine? rare seldom seen, ""double nipple"" Rolfcopter. 

No. ""The Vaccine Study"" - “Rogan entertainer consumed form entertainment education.”

That sounds lot like Fox News’ lawyers claim Tucker Carlson’s program. Like Carlson, Rogan large audience believes trusts him. responsible promoting bad information. knows impact words. may able held legally liable he’s still responsible says. feel like people got excited prospect pandemic ending summer happen, (at least US) kind collectively decided say ""fuck it, let's pretend over"" decided okay people continue get sick. Sounds like likes thrill contradictory. lived dinosaurs

Some people think Flintstones documentary. Excuse ignorance, Fear Factor? Oh, say so.  responsibility spread misinformation daily conversation. Certainly somewhere 0 100 million downloads month  That's solid retort That's news. News would Joe getting something right. think might something else Littering and…………Forging vax cards. Man pandemic really put US vs Mentality motion  Adding edit acting like right along doesn’t play turns conservative media figure either completely full shit unimaginably stupid entire time? Wow I'm fucking shocked. this?! Problem isn’t format information, content. Truth constrained reality, imposes fixed boundary audience appeal. Lies boundary, rearranged say whatever receptive. work 28 year old guy kids claimed COVID lockdowns/masking way make people dumber rely government more. conclusion kids back school. without masks/distancing, COVID get kids sick. Definitely that. Hes completely different human made popular. Fame fortune change you. greed. money fame caused it. always famous, never remotely famous become last years. Gone days underground roganboard. Yeah I'm regretting username. He's going downhill. free cost drive thru monoclonal treatment sites texas. defending idiot seems like people don’t realize easy free monoclonals covid positive people. Well mostly yes, people naive t-cells response, any, infection inoculation produce antibodies, there's still chance. tiny chance - i.e. tinier someone age (43) needing hospitalized due influenza.

I'm comfortable going now, double vaccinated, even one vaccines great (astra zeneca). make three safe? /s 

If vaccinated, protected severe disease hospitalization.  last sentence there. damned true? Lol ain't. That's science works. objective data time anyone talking definitive early speculation. Warning science speech IPCC report.

This science works. find new things coming up, always takes truth lot longer surface meanwhile billions nutjob conspiracies spawn ""fast science"" really bs.  would like report murder, dead.  Yeah, Germany like too. Brought Macy's! headline could 'Joe Rogan Getting Completely Wrong' would make sense matter topic about. sides carry court ultimately decides underlying issue, however long may take. meantime, state withholds funding? seems harm worth considering matter plays out. People believing various cleanses ages. Colon cleansing around since 1800s. completely agree able know everything choose experts listen form opinion topics fully understand. spot expert know (s)he's trustworthy? need minimum knowledge critical skills needs taught. No, limits unofficially. depends get sing. literally ongoing. can't cleanse lymph nodes drinking something. lymphatic fluid work way. Massive projection. Jesus christ.  idiots think virile they'll power ED. Great, that's good news. Monoclonal antibodies hurt help early stages.  Well technically cremated would hospitals full right now, want going reason. resign? (can't read article paywall).

Shouldn't charged forgery something? ...yes, joey. heat helps. good. Gold star participation! Yeah, plan masking game even though it’s going awful outside Indeed, anyone refuses vaccine given monoclonal therapy. can't think grounded reason take one violently refuse other. shuttle resources away responsible members society. absolutely fell love entire state, would live anywhere could there. 

Honestly crazy state week whose state government seem actively fucking hate citizens.  literally brings doctors every podcast lol  Even Joe Rogan response himself. lawyers probably made say something says words. get vaccines / boosters stop worrying getting live life. why? can't see stupid senior mother wont get vaccinated, catch non-symptomatic vaccinated person like me, one might end dead. can't eachother's lives there's point staying connected. 

Saying stupid shit like ""More people die car accidents smoking COVID"", help case. 

Sounds maybe like give user name y'all connect. Lymphatic cleansing? What's unusual that? take medical advice celebrities already flaw system Texas comments next level. read perfectly fine article Houston Chronicle. byline happened image author next it, Black woman. Half comments toxic dump accusing author diversity hire things nature. Southern politeness quickly evaporates behind shield anonymity. totally wild read, North East. It’s like Internet would like, 50’s.   article example.. misrepresented research, questions it.. millions followers. followers believe said, won’t seek information researcher wrote paper misrepresented. 

No offense, read article? 

Don’t pay attention votes, go day settle wherever do. Well really nervous obviously go considering fully vaccinated game outdoors, likely ok. want safe, always wear N95 mask game. Sure may idiots, still deal them, king idiot leads still making more. say wrong? Crazy think happening vaccinated state. Good. It’s outdoor event city majority total population vaccinated spike hospitalizations. don’t even like parades we’re exactly overrun here.  Well RIP me, Fort Collins? check out. Thanks.    Cry harder  ""just asking questions"" Completely agree. still understand psyche Joe Rogan.

He'll take HGH, Tren, Testosterone, Insulin bunch shit working bunch experimental treatments / anti-parasitic medication 

but take vaccine???? stopped watching Rogan moved Spotify. get feeling he’s going become Kanye podcast world. Started original likeable slowly mutating unlikable douchebag. Uh it’s Dr. Joe Rogan, “Jamie pull fake degree..” r/brandnewsentense  scientists, communicators science brand? disappointed mommy. Wasn’t one main drivers telling people vaccinated wear mask found viral load vaccinated individuals unvaccinated. Meaning still transmitting virus back peddle mask mandates. Joe Rogan overly-inflated internet troll Ironic want kids taken away parents Sandyhook fakes actors real grieving parents lost children encouraged base harrass point many take drastic measures make harrassment stop. 

Sandy Hook wake call many many many people far right insane conservative base getting. right deny tragedy, saying fake, want admit awful things happen. Hell Sandy either numerous school shootings since even denied politicians represent areas. Like cruel dense person be. 

Their Covid response taken extreme. bad thing that's killed hundreds thousands U.S. alone. Better deny admit awful shit happens society need change respond things. 

Because change scary, even scary deadly virus kills people mostly respiratory system sure let's take fucking horse dewormer cause two systems interact ton. 

It's becoming impossible even get people admit problems all. Let alone need fixed. even discuss fix them. 

It's depressing.  SARS NCoV-2 infects cells ACE-2 receptors, common cells mammals particularly respiratory tracts, digestive tracts, parts body. That's virus keen infecting anything breathes.

The danger able infect spread large number animal populations makes virtually impossible fully eradicate virus since it'll always stable host populations nature. Another risk many animals, particularly wild animals like deer, bats, rodents also hosts unknown number coronaviruses even know yet. such, risk that, lets say NYC Sewer rat infected Covid well yet unknown rat coronavirus that's similar enough covid two viruses could swap genes genes rat coronavirus, harmless rat, cause even severe illness humans finds way back infecting another human.

That's honestly possible source SARS-2 virus begin with, bat mammal infected one coronaviruses got infected one known unknown human compatible coronaviruses, swapped genes got hybrid coronavirus goes cause deadliest pandemic since 1918. really crazier getting medical advice Facebook memes? actually put call in, hoping anecdotal stories. taking ibuprofen, that’s around.  That’s basically way advocates circumcision. “Getting circumcised helpful preventing spread HIV, live country high rates HIV.” People already proudly posting memes featuring pictures Rogan physical peak UFC captions saying took 3 days “beat covid” horse drug cocktails, simultaneously shaming everyone made fun him. 

I haven’t bothered look whether got covid three days cognitive dissonance people deafening. literally allow another thought enter brains doesn’t fit narrative. vaccinated carriers make demographic? absolutely do. Vaccinated people tested rate unvaccinated. exactly criteria ""demographic""? totally. Ya juice cleanse. mean many things combined way mindset changed much since pandemic. weird. changed source know needs hear vaccines work, pandemic unvaccinated point. Throw case numbera/statistics want vaccinated person living highly vaccinated northeast, pandemic largely rear view me. Nothing said media people internet going stop living life. still mask required beyond part refuse suffer poor decisions unvaxxed people. u/Dr_JoeRogan went college early 90’s. graduating, hung around little bit moved Aurora (Denver suburb). felt like Fort Collins CSU student life ended feeling place. 

YMMV

For it’s worth, live Austin moving Taylor soon. Texas sucks lot ways want keep voting convincing others vote well. still hope Texas turn around! read it, opinion didn’t change much. would also listen Joe Rogan talked since people internet quick villanize something someone.

“ “I would delighted, say, get point vast majority evolution that's going vaccinated people there's vaccinated people around. get position year something, keep good eye evolution happening. right problem unvaccinated.”

Personally concerns this. whole tone article dismissive doesn’t quote seem short sighted you? Even correct vaccinations promising solution right now. realize that's option yet people kids 12 right? Um, talking about? nothing Fox News tucker Carlson. Unless Rogan fox’s platform partnership Carlson. stand corrected. Let’s stay topic. 

He entertainer… licensed, credited, appointed disseminate anything. thoughts show long form unscripted conversations people. personality may well act, means real. adult, able distinguish stuff. country free speech, done nothing wrong.  Saying opinion makes guilty? Right, point one holistic medicine salt lamp people, refuses vaccine, addition taking Joe Rogan's mindset well far right ideologies since pandemic. 

It's things combined ruined things. never ran fever, hurt contact primary care physician. taken tylenol ? 'psychology design' gave us ""material design"" use massive amounts wasted white space total lack texture/shadow/color differentiation function links/buttons white-on-white?  Scientists actually get encouraged write obnoxiously academic language.

Like university duck points writing casually. conspiracy you, promise (i couldnt care less you). asked saw peoples comments, edits go order. saw comments first would asked. enjoy bad can't learn things germ theory like ""but horse dewormer helps right""   See it’s hard believe logistically people selling masks Amazon exact medical supplier professional health organizations. 

Anyways, that’s exactly said that’s main reasoning tell people fashion cloth masks exact reason, ya know, like everyone said weeks later anyways. DeSantis... true cro magnon. Hold minute…you’re going stand tell Joe Rogue’n isn’t board certified virologist?!? that’s true, ever become host fear factor leading voice best flavor cattle deworming medicine? way speak knowledge virology? context upvoted downvoted. seethe, wrongcel. seems like artificial problem. countries excess offering boosters sharing excess, there's shelf life storage restriction problem means can't easily shared world. sentiment ""yeah got shots keep job, I'm getting more"" unfortunately line work spreads around different ""crews"" work together like damn virus. cares Joe Rogan thinks studies? would like taxes though.  fig leaf Joe's behavior

absolutely. Joe knew getting blasted hard called buddy said ""help make funny"" I'm planning wear goggles - actual wearing non-issue - wear safety googles metal working years ago wore military ballistic goggles eyeglasses. Finding comfortable model minimal eye glass temple cutouts take couple hours shopping fitting.

It's like I'm going get full filtered / forced air hood...

I'm also going assume airliner air filter maintenance *variable*... great opportunity try Tidal, haven’t looked back since. Wait, since Republicans fiscally conservative? lot people dumb. also need dumb people vaccinated. Fewer people giving bad advice dumb people dumb things would help.  remember endorsed bernie sanders headline clickbait barring obvious circumstances? try seeing periodical access local library system! numbers summary represent cumulative counts since states began reporting.

I agree recent focused data would great started pandemic hit. closest friend started talking different conspiracies. Next thing know he's actually convinced world flat humans lived dinosaurs. believe evolution, vaccines, masks, list kept growing. 

I've spent last year trying demonstrate logical fallacies provide sourced information contradict almost every argument has. managed steer away creationism flat earth COVID misinformation strong. 

A weeks ago asked would take agree take vaccine told 'nothing change mind'. fact could stand way beliefs ... Statistically covid 19 concern baby. Babies practically immune. course plenty things focusing on, congratulations! kinda disagree. chance getting spreading COVID vaccinated low enough reproduction rate would well 1 even precautions.

The problem say ""vaxxed people wear masks"" nobody wears masks.   SHOCKED Joe Rogan would fail understand nuances eccentricities data draw correct conclusion scientific study.

Are sure we're talking Joe Rogan here? live Denmark probably least 30 tests since pandemic started.  do, it’s “who could seen coming, please send thoughts prayers.” again?"
