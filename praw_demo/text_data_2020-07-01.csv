0,2020-07-01," think lot current leadership wouldn’t gotten bad someone charge responsible sane. Georgia’s response reopen full. relative believes plandemic numbers inaccurate receive money based many cases deaths reported.. what’s good rebut? insufferable. 

They might it, well. 

There widespread mask usage. Dont think government started campaign it, might higher usage? do.

We president directly contradict medical experts.

We high ranking officials follow public health protocol.

We leader ask LESS testing.

The response adequate. people upset about.

The last thing want Trump start mandating things. want step aside let science, politics, govern move forward. I'm commercial property manager, majority tenants report sales. fucking decimated last months. there's leadership top, states start coming creative solutions economic problem. leadership void 100% responsible catastrophe. Well, we’re talking Spanish flu, suppose they’re correct. Pass word Yeah thing people pre-symptomatic 27 days proof people fail test 4 times get positive.

Even though easier say ""yeah want travel, pay quarantine"" really smart idea people lie compassionate circumstances NZ turned positive covid.

It's cheaper easier government pay it.

Also illegal force someone pay enter country residence another reason charging people quarantines. digging financial state found spicy tidbit independent auditors report. sheds little bit light temporarily suspended nonessential patient services closed consolidated certain ambulatory locations. possible, Children’s adjusted staffing resources expenses response reduced patient volumes revenues. Children’s experienced higher cost certain medical supplies able reduce fixed expenses response reduced patient volumes revenue. Children’s recorded unrealized loss fair value investment portfolio due decline global financial markets. Children’s cannot reasonably estimate length severity pandemic, could adverse impact consolidated financial position, consolidated results operations, consolidated cash flows Children’s 2020.

So add stock market list reasons. I’m sure similar story hospitals, compounded *massively expensive hospital* started building. It’s anecdotal. studies pointing covid causing lung abnormalities inflammation even asymptomatic patients, aren’t necessarily sure means long term. could mean nothing, sure, people aren’t asymptomatic young age (and yes exist) still sick experience lung issues short term. 

Not mention hard evidence virus cause blood clot, even asymptomatic, lead heart attack, stroke, PE, etc. normally healthy patients suffering these, even don’t know virus. 

And comes college, it’s students. I’m sure college community. community college handle outbreak college spreads surrounding community? I’m sure answer yes lot schools country. spread like wildfire college campuses. 

I don’t know you’re going beatings continue? It’s simply concept. don’t wear mask public continue spend time around others, spread virus it. could catch someone else spread it. don’t wear mask. we’re wearing masks protecting one another, disease spreading, we’re going lockdown hospitals can’t handle it. 

This situation much one persons risk assessment. trying insensitive, fairly common see dead bodies street India? Like, enough seem normal...

Swear I've read before. ok, let try increasing sarcasm levels, lets see detect time.

Only socialists wear masks.

Did work? Seriously though. covid. nearly passed today finished. Month lockdown half-assed, GOP leaders actively worked sabotage it. That's get weak leadership said October goes well things would operation would no-one fit enough work. virus makes people sick incapacitated. think people hospital well enough work choose lay around instead? death rate would skyrocket 10% would mean one ten people would die whole population get it. They've brainwashed years strong practiced propaganda network problems opposite party's fault. concept worldwide problem beyond capable thinking. know repeat taught think. fellow Canadian, hope ever stop manufacturing medical PPE ever again. US attempting stop shipments wake call us. produce raw materials N95 masks, time bring production home, good.

I care need subsize rest time. FAR important National Security rely allies. small market own, vitally important.

I'm hopeful vaccine approved, Canada able quickly produce distribute it. 3rd world country coat 1st world paint  I'm super curious two deleted comments replying said.. It’s late masks many parts Texas. back March “shut everything” stage. 

Masks little bit control let people move bit. shit hits fan hard gotta keep everyone home. Masks get control far slowly. scenario every single person gets covid (over course year) 

Is less scary scenario total economic collapse. 

Of course scenario could lead scenario B. that’s sucks. sister rad tech &amp; po’d Davidson Co. mandating masks public. “I guess won’t going there.” (Her daughter lives there.) comment makes sense. lower testing lower percentage since everyone. one state double percentage show flawed data since low testing. know rapidly growing testing low. Oregon acting like poverty state bad handling this. Lock downs don’t fix social distancing it’s mass testing. Places don’t issues anymore mass testing see it. Can’t test feel like Oregon tell lower percentage don’t test. half amount!!! want 7.5k wheat please. Tens thousands, maybe hundred thousand took streets maybe 3-5 days. 

*tens millions* ignored pandemic, refused wear masks, congregated bars restaurants two full months. 

Tell me, likely cause explosion? people test, positivity rate syncs total rate population infected. less people test, number rise, stabilize time. keep slowing testing, positivity rate eventually become volatile test count becomes small accurately represent real rates meaningful way.

Like test 10 people only. going low high, accurate.

If test 10,000 people, going give much better idea much population may infected. mandate it’s suggestion? doesn’t make sense.  fair Washington mandated mask statewide.  Governor literally said right announcement enforcement said rule. far I'm aware state enforcing mask policy. Exactly! Especially considering China lied numbers nearly every step way. directly contributed Blasé attitude made things terrible are. ...And group crowds around grave Steve McStevenson, crying tears never expected someone age actually die virus known kill people, left flowers, paid respects, gave pot Steve's family help medical expenses Steve racked hospital. 

They ran play Russian Roulette together. Riverside live. obviously cannot wrap head around science.

This it. number family members never day high school, can't understand what's going on. gatherings strictly prohibited 50 people though? might wrong, think marriage broke lot lockdown rules. register spike graph line continuously grown upwards. US consistent quarter world's new cases, like least 2 months now. used even higher proportion, seems Brazil trying shoot moon. I’ve already wearing mine (I’m teen haven’t go public stores much since parents mostly stuff.) I'd argue cunning form intelligence, know audience play people well etc. people start dying, people care. that's hope point. many take americans start caring anyone themselves? simple common courtesy toward human beings, wearing mask, woild halve numbers. Maybe different daily reset time worldometers (GMT 0:00) Quoting one heroes, Isaac cult ignorance United States, always been. strain anti-intellectualism constant thread winding way political cultural life, nurtured false notion democracy means ‘my ignorance good knowledge.’ lmao. actually Go INSIDE McDonald's? meant perspective employee, shareholder. recently first checkup years telehealth, mess. asking needed, like ""I need everything. tests show whether going die tomorrow? need those. know need, doctor."" locked eight mine away incase also become sentient. I'll take headache &amp; mild moderate fatigue corona virus day. 

Happy hear progress made. we're nearly fat though. compare 538 _aggregates_ historical performance, selecting older forecast dates - overlays actual trajectory. trajectory stays within confidence bracket bill $3,000,000

Wait fuck, no. Oh shit. No!

Wait insurance.

Oh thank fuck.

Your bill $5000

I mean, that's much less bad. Okay feels like working maybe?

Europeans: five fucking thousand dollars? that's health insurance pay $400 month for? Ah, virus killbot pre-set kill limit? Ohh one talk. held hands CCP tried downplay first? like crimimal pointimg finger another that, 

Thanks playing Yeah. like breath breath in. big cycle life. Please assumptions. many, many people dying getting hospitalized equal ""Getting fucked?"" Bet don’t feel way women’s bodies. not? eat time. food risk low I'm looking forward vaccine developed much quicker usual. Even though low severe symptoms parents died disease

Wait. What? think C-19 overblown *but* parents died it? them?! world talking about? Tomorrow: US reports record high 60,000 daily cases
The next day: US reports record high 70,000 daily cases


This scary, I'm tired living like rider driver doesn’t mask it’s covering nose ask put getting accepting ride say thanks cancel ride? 

Its really feel like approaching situation. personally would ask go there. want put mask asked once, I'll cancel ride move on. less excuse get angry losing trip/pay official policy. said, cancel ride reason, would probably walk somewhere else placing another ride request case driver turns kind psycho would run someone car cancelling I’m female definitely see someone saying ok putting one we’re driving there’s hostility, danger resentment building car you’re locked someone rocker starts showing anger you’re car. 

Honestly, think people carry hand gun and/or bottle pepper spray personal protection. typically carry large enough purse (or fortunate enough found pants actual pockets), tools specifically designed breaking car windows could carry you. said, hopefully none turns necessary. believe majority people sane (hopefully) chances ever needing use tools situation like one describe fairly low. think driver likely encounter customer gets violent mask policy way around. Especially since driver working company time using personal vehicle. addition wanting keep job, easier identify rando offers ride. thing hope gets COVID survive it. Canada gonna break NA wave middle finger adios. mean essential oils colloidal silver protect me?!? ^^/s US number one something thought jumped pig human human human. anyone confirm deny? hear country protested fact decided stay safe home protect masks public ? Why? Ah, see, confusing spiritual things real world application. 


BTW fault Pascals Wager believe wrong reasons, logic wrong. think keep cases nursing homes nows? Sure, better procedures, PPE, better testing, flood areas outside nursing homes going get eventually via staff. I’m trying racist BLM movement BLM protest Shibuya 2 weeks ago, cannot say social distancing correctly... people already suspecting might cause. Maybe clear, collective message leadership virus dangerous treated respect. 

Instead say it’s flu, disappear months, worry death rate going down.  

Boomers boomin. Tigers well. They'd quarantined automatically charged it, regardless symptoms get get. Sill waiting someone show statute make orders violating.... I'm curious too, I'm testing gonna ensure compliance? Make us wait line 6+ hours? pinche barbosa good part inside McDonald's need take shit. clean toilets usually free charge, least Europe. Technically Sweden, Finland Switzerland third-world countries. talk technology used called ChAdOx1? Part time scientist, full time memer. somewhere read retrospective articles? Someone condensed summary different groups saying, like timeline popular articles month.

Just looking Reddit would interesting enough. google search ""coronavirus before:YYYY-MM-DD after:YYYY-MM-DD site:reddit.com/r/[SUBREDDIT NAME]"" sometimes yields really interesting results. keep changing dates almost like timeline certain communities moving goalposts instead admitting wrong. Happy cake day, it’s worth Hold on, despite lockdowns still track worse initial 'worst case' projections, misreading that? Uch website slooow.
I still get nightmares... compile Tuesday, actually. least Worldometer reports it. 

I'm certain Worldometer matching reported deaths happen reported - every county actually reporting date death. I'd amazed every hospital reports deaths centralized system within hours, probably lag time, places may inconsistent. 

The numbers looking back, difference really minor analyzing longer-term trend. anyway, 7-day moving average best way track it. Masks mandatory 3 months CT say impressed well hearing people states refusing wear masks. weird 2 weeks, would weird see someone wearing mask. miss any?

Bill Gates wants control world's population vaccine needs death toll exaggerated. appropriate. That’s Billy Mitchell uses initials arcade games. forgot /s admit tongue cheek funny ""They're bad"" Seems like hand wavy way hide name one wrong. think thing keeping GA numbers low metro Atl actually right thing long 

Looks like stopped Dunno hostile.. seem revel fact dumb. said dumb things, named tunafister, deny now? dumb too, okay, peaceful ending conversation. Good day sir. least safely there. Taking each-other.

I would incredibly happy anything remotely close provided kids next year.

(Im teacher) Hm, US not, state federal level, track excess deaths? even talking dude wins internet today 🤣 yet whatever reason, mexico seems high death rate.

I know deal is, overall death rate wide variance even accounting demographics deception. 0.5% several, 10% several, that's factor 20. Lmao what? Please stop throwing around nonsense. clue getting this, saw ridiculous comment looked paper back claims. think second, disease could cause damage lungs degree weeks symptoms? common fucking sense moron, isnt happening stop spreading lies fear. McDonald's smarter Donald. Hm, knew? get tacos?  Congrats  competent President would message. Wearing mask make economy keep moving. either wear mask face crippling depression businesses close. small businesses already struggling, can't even imagine many would go close another 3-6+ months. added third layer inside winter, find thick theory? came that? That's shit argument gotten benefits since started claiming 3 months ago. fact seen taxpayer dollars even heard state federal government plan solve unemployment crisis. That's what's making want work. lack health care, hazard pay, sick leave, opportunity, employer supplied PPE, state testing, watching federal government rob country blind.

This shit country people what's making want work. Fuck living paycheck paycheck, can't even now. 15 confirmed cases Latah County, 5 possible 

They got emergency order requiring masks California?? wont force still 'force it'

I easily see companies hiring banned travel vaccinated. jaw dropped protestors masks. people especially r states going wear masks. Also, we've known 20% hospitalization rate WAYYY high long time. 

Using NY's serosurvey alone placed like 4%. 

ICU like  North island Bolivar Peninsula, unincorporated Galveston County beach. That’s closed.

That’s pretty much last beach Louisiana.

To south Brazoria County. don’t think they’ve closed yet, they’re close becoming last open beach Texas he’s good guy like Hulk. Don’t feed tacos midnight. Fake news. saw China inject troops...

I’m kinda nervous guys gals. Oh see, that's new well since I'm USA know difference mindset north south USA.

Hey least positive rate high, good luck people Oklahoma! thanks info Colleges reopened summer already, cousin back fujian classmates California going fully reopen. going stages. testing, cases. Magic! virus disappear everybody’s wearing mask, he’s “open to.” fulfilled daily responsibility president! /s USA reported one day half total cases Canada entire pandemic. That's insane. live PA, people happy angry Gov. Wolf, personally think enforced much much earlier, guys probably want hear opinion Well remember H1N1 going around, base vaccine mandatory, sooooo.....yeah kinda is. hey, one guy store earlier gave stern look wearing mask. Social pressure works, right guys? Little, Late. Look death count.  answer somewhere north 130,000 smart money masks intial link doesnt matter dutch anyway nobody read it. This. reopen there’s virus, can’t spread. takes super spreaders open environment really take hold. Oh absolutely batshit people Facebook feed say otherwise No, shitty music. 671 deaths. seems like trending though, right? 2k deaths per day months ago? younger people getting infected now? *Cough. Cough.* Covid Yeah... kids fun. 

Wish could take 2 year old stuff again. Hopefully none us get sucks life affected it. (not discount actually affected. Still sucks) pay time though. I'm still waiting Soros-bucks 2 years ago! Yep. probably small cost relation $2 Trillion spent CARES act, relation devastation economy. reason Mexican positivity rate high capacity mass testing. bad thing. mention already awful health many people living rural areas. speak second language. Learning common mistakes part process Texas here. Yesterday city passed “STRONGLY SUGGESTED” mask mandate, you’re required wear masks businesses...but suggestion. There’s penalties fines comply. It’s equivalence saying “pretty please” So, post shit link indicate quoting another source? Sloppy. Without vaccine, there's way economy bounce back like wants.

With talks oxford vaccine ready fall, would think would right that. See something, say something. People also still going willy nilly without care world. u have, parents would throw cliff trump told to. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* use 2 layers African wax prints. Highly comfortable breathable. TB frequenting since called back May completely gutting dining room, sure goal is. Replacement reduction what. Dammit. can't argue speeding cause accidents. Bus cops? Like security guards? thought ""Trump's aides debate new virus approach"" would something novel public health measures. no, like ""Get Trump *something* pandemic!"" ""No no, keep well away whole issue!""

Could anyone ever imagined US president terrible job something important? Omg fucking idiot. anyone talks tell want fight him. Holy cow US 50,000 corona virus cases today ... Canada 100,000 ever! 
The US literally half Canada’s cases one day. That’s frightening. photos Gov Wolf marching protests without mask

Any examples? recent photos see Google show noticeable blue mask walking people. 67 new cases Canada today. Pretty incredible country 38 million people. hope keeps up. say ICUs completely capacity? one mentioned Houston they’ve started trying move certain patients facilities. eventually, way Arizona Texas trending, ICU beds taken similarly saw New York earlier on. moving. get bed/vent. won’t. often work? College age adults - humans even finish growing brains age 25. sad. Pretty much everyone gets damage even asymptomatic. one maybe going worse case get hospitalized. worse long term effects. maybe one might die. child I'd fuckin mad. Almost Europe moved on. take another month two US Social Media realizes Europe back normal. US States demanding wear masks go walk park Vienna packed bars people Paris street parties. Volunteered helping dementia patients.  underrated. Vanilla? you? want wear mask, probably take seatbelt, stop wearing helmet riding motorcycle, go shooting range without ear eye protection

it seems rural PA...if said would already say, ""I already things"" without missing beat. blueprint flatten curve! need see this. “But muh rights” killing us. Literally. sure know lot people restaurants. Even able see they’ve meal. Yeah husband's ICU unit reopen covid unit hospitals network filling sooooo. OK see  Coward good news, I’m hoping it’s 100% time around enforce hard 4th. beaches near Galveston Texas? immediate fear kinda goes people flocking beaches one shut infringes many rights. Illegal go outside without mask? Bullshit total authoritarian regime. Cancer cancer say? Interesting. reopening continues, soon  texas big city. test delayed every day week hopefully test tomorrow. Idk say 2 hours appointment. Staying home. 4 places appointments connections owners one facility. go walk test center 9-1 days.... run early 30 min plus away work 5am-2pm hour break... working home hours impossible go usually ten day result test(work company yeice busy usual rn). Also im going around people especially texas may give may spread it. kinda ridiculous. Hospitals also ideal go to... symptoms improved daily im risking it. couple terrible days sunday monday still better worrisome worrisome(flu symptoms, sore upper back, lungs, labored breathing standing,) im young male ideal BMI exercise lrior health issues).
 took precautions sadly Texas dumb. didnt go public places last 2 weeks... Seeing bars loaded 2pm people suppose home- assume(Unemployed restaurant employees making 1k week time get drunk). home buddy. stupid state. Ignorant really. 
Hope get rapid test tomorrow really reals. refuses wear mask public himself, though pictures exist wearing one. Haha truth man. I’m messing ya. ordered Adidas two days ago order shipped today. looks like still add cart website least. sure means actually stock: [check sad miserable must be.  Parts Spain 60% population antibodies. NYC 20-25%. watched daily, amateur chart analyst, apparently. Cases broke normal range June 18th. date things fundamentally changed, dates right low going (the 12th 17th), still peaks previous weeks. Everything normal June 18th, things really explode late last week.

Chart analysis something daily stocks (and coronavirus lately), things much easier read guess, know something ""out character"" occurred. 12th 17th range bound stuff, 18th break-out point, we'd expect deaths begin rising (but delayed basis, could 3 - 4 weeks breakout point, data Iran's second wave/surge indication). Hallelujah!  keep wondering one. 0.2-0.4% death rate wont collapse medical system. isnt plague. VANILLA ICU dont know situation countries netherlands secured doses ofxord vaccine soon get doses, mass vaccination program begin.

The entire population vaccinated matter weeks. Human nature. God bless America Would bad thing? Either wear mask outside time, read specifics order know criteria? Fuck dildo head Try determine next stock market crash this, PUTs. Good luck. average, peak deaths happened 2-4 weeks peak new cases. Deaths flattened US, like new cases 3-4 weeks ago started going rapidly. 

There delay actions new cases, new cases deaths. source like that’s trying get accurate guesses cases death? Adding excess mortality whatnot?

Because like said, I’m sure it’s way official count, wonder much more. think charging leave goes international law worth effort housing hundred/thousand people fortnight easy government there's grey area covered governments. Really..... bc two biggest factors id think many people virus many people test. think people peak hospitalizations deaths? title makes seem worst day yet not. factor theres tests administered. combination number tests administered huge factor many positves get. We're capturing higher percentage asymptotic mild patients compared hospitalization bc administering tests. Bill Gates working reforestation, cheap contraception, carbon recapturing, disease eradication, food supply proliferation.

Can live Billgateistan? They're going neverending cycle people getting sick. Get sick, recover, antibodies disappear 10-12 weeks, get sick again. United States COVID-19 founded. We’ll likely lose Americans died WW2. 

It helps president isn’t side enemy. decided going children many years ago climate denial much, much more... even imagine much going sour.

Surely police adults now! ER nurse here. work Los Angeles county area, confirm icu completely full &amp; holding patients ER due saturation patients / admissions.

Drastic measure morons understand  Ok conceded argument comparing India US totally stupid idiotic. Thats enough me. Thank you.

But ok ill compare China Population density third India whose per capita GDP India 5 times large. India developing country dont work starve. research happened migrant workers month ago encouraged spread now. Chinese system completely different. Holy fuck clueless. Everyone forgetting AZ even though probably worst shape! confused too. I've heard many people going ""neener neener protect wearer"" but... filters one way, could filter way too?? think reasoning deeply flawed rush judgement like comment people even know... Human sacrifice, dogs cats living together, mass hysteria! No, way lose credibility compare people beaches, restaurants, bars people protests they're equal. Nobody worth listening suggesting protests impact spread, obviously did, they're simply suggesting impact significantly less many claim protests outdoors protesters wearing masks protests still worth supporting despite impact spread. hypocrisy acknowledge one largest civil rights movements history bunch people can't stand able go bar Friday night equivalent. never realized much behave like animals logical beings now. mean guess knew know bad.  compare World War Damn, almost like going congregating large numbers bad idea. yet Italians managed it, they're touchy-feely. I'm pretty sure person knows son better lol 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭  well stated. No, lol. common days companies offer 401k contribution matching unless ultra-competitive environment like bay area. aunt recently posted video talks Obama set ploy ""deep state"" take away rights.

A family members agreed her. Fun thing reunion planned next summer. **So** looking forward it. lie cost thousands, maybe hundreds thousands, life. So, mean infections rise people tested? remember experts saying weeks ago we'd see huge influx positive cases would due increasing tests. Well, apparently plenty people half brain believed everything health authorities said without questioning logic. Authority-bias all-time high. no, people everywhere. problem US, theyre actually ones power American Dystopia. ability compel America (or country) actually anything. can't blame Math teacher bad job slept every class, never opened textbook, skipped every bit homework. 

The business.

The death counts primarily American, result American incompetence. people ignoring virus going restaurants clubs remind partiers top skyscrapers welcoming aliens demise. It’s pretty sad see curve wa flattening suddenly started go back people got complacent.

Doesn’t help leadership top isn’t taking seriously.

Hopefully things get sorted again, curve goes back again. 

Is happening states starting open, also states lockdown still going? USA NUMBER 1 ! /s risky playing outdoors basketball? I'm talking full court, 5 vs 5.  
Say wash hands immediately avoid touching face. Take shower first thing getting home Protestors wear masks without pandemic. Always have. Social distancing, that's really thing India. That's are. There's thing personal space. I'm sure easy ""they're stupid"". MUCH WINNING! 


Getting tired it... can’t really hide high numbers 

Hi, Tianmen Square Massacre death count would like speak you. “It’s ok Dr. Fauci don’t need help, got “ insult developing countries. People countries 1/100000th wealth live lives poverty people cannot even imagine, much greater sense public community responsibility, selfish arrogant. 10 years learn longterm health consequences wish never went party  death count rising fast well. fast missed 
123, 456 body count. Suck Brazil. USA #1 misleading headline. Nothing changed. Asian Arab markets fucking awesome right now. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Humans yet make vaccine Coronavirus including SARS2.

I can't wait nine months gonna take people realize pinning hopes vaccine futile Young people easy target. messaging (overall) virus disjointed day 1. blame them? supposed educate youth. feel like shafted future say voice. videos I’ve seen partying make sad...not mad. expect know better - adults set better example? Easy targets...and lame. care. it’s disservice everyone count out. Hey completely hear saying. One never get lost fall victim media. It’s always messy place. Staying true science means, 6 months still short time done proper research matter lack finalized information. However, known many viral disease linked many neurological damage increasing ones susceptibility conditions. 
All I’m saying people quick dismiss danger COVID human body, matter young able may be. again, ignorance bliss lol. 

A study touching neurological possibilities COVID: Sadly, sub inundated try keep sanity ! eyes focused US. Italy pretty much gone worst, US hand beginning. Roaring 21 weird time Georgia smaller percentage positive results antibody tests compared viral test. lazy dig states reports. USA! USA! USA! couple days ago, forgot mask home. pulled walgreens asked someone parking lot grab store employee me. employee came out, gave 20 asked bring change box surgical masks. 

It hard. America. country stupid. people might be, many collectively. certain country response thats shameful pathetic. interesting country keep telling us kids catch spread anywhere near much adults justification keeping schools open. despite reason assume would catch less, would less severe. Thats thing human nature. things get bad, think point things bad we'll forced fix them. Unfortunately, point usually never comes. Humans get used worse circumstances ""as new normal"". evolutionary trait makes humans extremely adaptable. get used living less worse conditions eventually, forget good things used be. 

This true Easter islanders, instead dying massive deforestation, transitioned eating available worsened living conditions. could grow much food trees. could build canoes fish. ate rats farmed low amounts food colonisation eventually wiped out. 

I suspect also true humans climate change. Things get bad matter we'll forgotten good things used be. We'll get used living climate change, hoping someday things get bad fix it. lot us die new normal. Hope I'm wrong. generally like many posts level downvotes one odd. Guess touched nerve. EU countries saw outbreak much earlier much denser, helps spread virus lot. ever fucked most, likely see heavy impact. realized shit serious (well... us) went full lockdown weeks, managed hold back exponential growth, almost completely virus-proof exception there.

The US hand much preparation time much lower density (in comparison: density US 100 times lower Belgium!). US every chance succesful Coronavirus control, yet trew every possibility window. States went lockdown really necessary yet government prepared, destroyed economy, unable economy can't tank people it... Yet, capacity 3,5% population hospitals. even close.

So still massive risk That's way it. vaccine works, ethical issue, damage done. work, therefore ethical issue. Ethics aside, way empirically demonstrate vaccines work. Period. I’m upstate New York relatively unaffected area, like think it’s literally everyone town wears mask. grocery store, picking takeout food, even going walks, always. People *don’t* wear masks get side-eyed really badly. I’m really proud community getting together, worry relatives AZ FL right now. 

I hope things get better I’m honestly loss lower massive numbers areas many people refuse wear masks. It’s hard comprehend wouldn’t. People lying contact tracers since first case Bay Area gentleman Hawaii. Try remember many people US, large US is, fact every State like country policies actions vary States. 
It's really simple as, ""everyone stupid"". should. Yeah extra foot person next accomplishes nothing. you’re flying right now, you’re acknowledging accepting risk. Good see people starting call security theater genuinely makes sense. least year I'd say, people combing data. takes nine months baby born, three month pattern less babies born appear get reported on. need go look reasons there's less babies born. yeah, could vaccine... could lot people decided postopone baby making uncertain times, people loosing jobs like that, often can't even partner hospital, meere presence risks health time vulnerable... would get speculative really fast, would take years sorted out.

But, boogus unlikely example, probably myriad things look for. horrible behavior time, even now. :( cold makes worst - COVID doesn’t like heat. Might contact tracers ask people protests inhibit ability tell whether protests contribute? I’m wrong colleague taking seriously now? 
Towards last days going office started freak getting paranoid longer joke. Nothing safe. calculated risk. get airplane, need understand higher average risk catching this. Blocking middle seat basically nothing make risk lower.

Believe not, people willing hermit rest lives may reasonably compelling reason risk getting airplane. current gen though? Millennials gen z 0 power. 

Fwiw hope hate me. 100% serious I've told go back Europe even though born here. Well, admit saf**er** leaving middle seats open, anyone even slightest amount working brains already figured. covid diplomacy! Death everything... lots people survive permanent organ damage. Even mild case leave permanent damage lungs. Hi! think removed error, find anything sub new US record posted this, article minutes old. Thanks! Yep. Anyone know work home? Thank NYT I’m going one bring single full time working parent child 6. Boom. Mic drop walk stage. mean, depending scope ""at point"" he's necessarily *wrong* humans SARS-CoV-2 get ""news"" ""information"" fox news rush limbaugh, even worse, president. India ""outdoor"" USA. Beside service industry, lot industrial commercial activities happen open, outside shops.

What's fucking USA boomers going bars restaurants.  doesn’t mean completely stops spread. go risk spreading infection all! Go Texas! Everything bigger there!! indication good education improves education how? IRONMAN! AFAIK, mandated paid vacation US. people get 10 days. Wow .thats mindset cost thousands new yorkers life's. Glad blood hands Oh yes. man absolute shit career criminal. asked friend mine they'd ever heard him, response wanted know say something good him. He's kind man would think nothing robbing grandmother (and probably did).

Amazing. ***AMERICA THIRD WORLD SHITHOLE.*** using itchy butthole? friend wondering. JHH cumulative case count China: 84816

My ad-hoc linear model R: predicted.cases = 16276+(1544\*days.from.today)

So: 84816=16276+(1544*days.from.today)
1544*days.from.today = 84816-16276
days.from.today = (84816-16276)/1544 = 44.4 days

So optimistic scenario would see taking 44 days reach one china's worth cases day. course, model *linear* virus increase linearly spreading, exponentially. 

So exponential conditions need know long taken double: today 52,000 new cases, 27,000 new cases 10 days ago. increasing every since. lets say doubling time 10 days (it likely less). hit China's case load day in: 
cases.per.day = 52982*2^{days.from.now/10}
52982*2^{6.5/10} = 83137 cases per day

6.5 days 10 day doubling time. Unfortunately lockdown we're climbing steadily again!

Good luck fellow reddittor  Known wise. ""But deaths way down, number new cases really matter.""

I've seen posted social media.

Nevermind there's lag diagnosis death.

Nevermind daily deaths \~300 week ago closer 700.

Nevermind went 300 daily deaths 2,000 daily deaths 2 weeks early pandemic. India, single person tests positive building, lock entire street enforce police (china level lockdown, US freedom bullshit).


We enough tests, thats definitely one way dealing it. dead people streets.. rapid surge new cases among children newborns age 9 gone relatively unnoticed – **in part lack transparency state agencies**\- per article beliefs* Yes people actually belives 62M Americans voted assclown. look areas hit hard coronavirus (NYC, Lombardi) death count makes literally impossible IFR low even 100% population infected. part “did Trump tell people ingest Clorox?” loaded? 

You exlained comment originally decided respond facile handwave intentional ignoring several salient points. either write proper response continue get referred back comment. give shit takes 10 years. bow gaslighters. We're beginning phase right now. Pooling new testing strategy. Much rest world months. America: could seen coming?

World: WTF wrong people?! Altoids worst. Blaming California hoax one players summer basketball league. sounds like tough old bird probably get would survive did. People pay attention unless deaths spike back peak US previously saw. Hollywood. June 3rd. Mexican here, fever 3 weeks ago went take test, negative cost $3,300 pesos, ($145 usd) that's almost half month salary avarage worker, there's massive test here, people symptoms take test. That's many positive.   And, like ours, they're usually minority electors go make dumb shit policy. Unfortunately electorate rigged represent majority. Going per capita, Italy Spain 575 607 dead per million. US barely catching 400. Even France 450 Sweden 500 dead per million.

What kind leaders running countries? Canada does. much alot people , leadership making right calls, tons screaming overblown, goverment conspiracy, masks kill people types people Lying tends lead mistrust. It’s like public would opportunity snatch masks already gone. pushed non mask message pretty hard flimsy reasoning like masks dangerous don’t know use properly. Believes * Nah, thing Britain Brexit. seeing restaurants businesses everywhere employees wearing masks. I've reported one weeks ago, change today. Boyfriend works QT mask-mandated Texas city. QT said they’re going “suggest” mask wearing customers employees force business out. someone says no, they, workers, required go “Oh okay.” continue working. 

QT also says would rather pay fines acquired neighboring Dallas actually, y’know, enforce fucking rules. Something-something “Bad look business.”

Companies dumbasses death us. Also, FUCK you, Chet. Greedy piece shit. Dumbest fucking state country. People like assuming world ending often times isn't.. 

Man disingenuous hundred thousand + died millions negatively affect financially personally. Yeah there's Vanilla Ice 2020's throw away. Keep trolling. I'm taking hours head space, thanks control. Makes feel good knowing angry dragging hours. Probably could spent time self reflecting hypocrite change. US: Hold Corona. Haha ok, that's enough though interesting thought phase 3 basically. History judge swedish method right path. Im Western Australia havent community transmission months swedish method wouldnt make sense short sharp lockdown march combined slow opening locked borders internally meant 0 transmission. dumb luck part isolated meant many cases initially watched issues overseas could tailor accordingly. talking years without vaccine would nothing though That’s side things people reddit social Media aren’t talking about. Sure another closure lockdown fine ensuring least compensated amongst us going suffer. People going lose everything we’re celebrating it. Earth would factor exponential growth model viral infectivity? **Why even make model?**

If there's one thing know certain COVID-19, virus *not* experience linear growth. know exact rate, know obviously reproductive rate 1. average, one person *will* infect one person. That's indisputable.

So, purpose model seems predict rate infection, based primarily one things we're sure *is wrong*. So, what's point model?!

Here's clearest proof model wildly inaccurate: take model, plug numbers day, get completely different answer. Let's take numbers March 15th, US 36 new cases. 

Good news! looks like going take 25,190 years virus infect entire US population. get PUA - math us diff - basically get half max state unemployment + $600 - regardless actually making. 4th already here...since got work last Friday. Gotta celebrate independence least week before, 4th Friday Saturday. 6 weeks now, much like 6 weeks Memorial day telling time. Nice south fan masks, putting mildly. employees forced wear case they’re usually worn around chin neck (with exception chick-fil-a always good job). Maybe lack mask compliance isn’t helping. fucked yesterday. cousin's birthday invited last minute thought going party went. Turns out, like 10 people showed up. sticked 3 hours, even though wearing mask, really social distance. fucked I? Tulsi Gabbard proposed exactly House Resolution 897 back March. followed crickets. judge would order talk. honestly know legally enforceable. live philly walk almost every day. day I’d say things 50/50 night maybe 10% You’re correct. However, that’s it’s going handled. we’ve doubled tripled hysteria fear new tactic “don’t let ANYONE die” surface may seem like right thing say realistically 150,000 people die everyday around world. 

Anyway, I’ve resigned mostly accept USA won’t reopening year moved trying gauge devastating corresponding economic collapse be. 

We seem adopted strategy “vaccine bust” also comfortably leading world deaths. suppose result bitterly divided nation insists everything must political. Even Masks. mean.... Winnie Pooh (a cartoon) outlawed China so... YES sure, means MAYBE?

Not much good ""test"" since neither result spell relief.  think looked raising R value different states made 

Most heavily populated states going back 1. urgency learning much possible widely virus may spread parties, officials said, tip people cooperated least one large party planned area Fourth July weekend. Oh, virtue signaling anything. Gotch you! capability mass test we'd already open, whatever reason can't figure get amount tests necessary happen. recently Ohio testing something around ~~20,000~~ 5,000 day state 10 million people. can't reopen testing little. even bother typing sending this. everyone ever knows society live requires us work alive. Sometimes Uber option make ends meet. Southern Indiana here. Nobody wears mask. Take things really radical place: inoculate young healthy. take actions expose potential infection, actually put needle infect them. Someone needs inform Mexican people trump’s magic solution problem: testing, cases! believe 20 states made mandatory wear mask. others guidelines nothing place.  Maine I’m from, it’s 50/50. I’ve working retail summer since April, I’m shocked people dismiss everything “just flu” seem find every loophole governor’s executive orders wear mask socially distance. It’s infuriating especially since coworkers part refuse wear masks all.

I think I’m lucky Maine mostly rural state, it’s matter time get big numbers too. put odds NBA finishing season slightly Glenn Robinson coming retirement lead championship. good thing virus revealing people's true colors. Keep mind today done 595,917 tests Mexico, population around 127 million. means tested LESS .5% population.

So quite literally 100 people, tested .5 them. approach government took testing really bad cases clearly stupid idea, we're already 6th country deaths, 10th cases we're track beat countries like Italy probably even UK. Try zero weeks. happening Mother Russia intensifies visualization ends month. Go little underlying models doesnt look rosey. See YYG Exactly. They're probably business less staff. Less liability potential lawsuits too. last spring training game AZ... game learned: Tom Hanks corona, Rudy Gobert corona, NBA cancelled Trump cutting travel Europe. wild, surreal night. told mom might last game going see played while. 

I don’t see possible sports leagues keep players staff safe months. assumed Americans vacationing hardcore  considerably less median household income $59,039. middle pandemic need people working - need home get virus control - extra $600 makes possible folk still pay bills, eat keep roof head. NY hospitalization figures crushed 400 per day NY peak, couple weeks too. trying put perspective. NY really bad shape early complete 180 done much better. Texas starts pivoting soon, similar NY, hopefully turnaround faster. goes AZ. Idk FL though. NJ bad NY turned around too. Ok I'm sorry coming like ass case.

My question then, provisional death counts data match provisional death counts data? I'm thoroughly confused. would actually funny pandemic. 

Right now, tragedy. one beliefs you’re lib filthy five day old troll account buddy. Counties different mandates. mask requirement since April. People wearing them. get big deal wearing mask. want get sick, wear one. want spread disease, wear one. selfish to. That’s life expectancy works, plenty elderly people developing nations. instance, people hear average life expectancy medieval era 35, assume everyone age 30 white haired elder needing cane. absolutely people living 80 now, it’s many infants children died, along young men war young women childbirth skews average life expectancy much lower. developing countries now- lot children die brings average down, doesn’t mean elderly. Same. high boob.” kids went almost exposure, following unprecedented shutdown schools March, returning activities include day camps, sports trips playground.

The age bracket (0 9) useful figuring what's happening here. much daycare (&lt;6) , much playgrounds etc (all ages), much day camps seems they're mostly reporting daycare outbreaks article. Addressing spread different age groups environments probably requires different approaches. evidence significant contributions spike protests. Getting tired repeating over. want shit man....waiting turn like worst shit imaginable. say Senate hearing Fauci crew pretty much dismissed vaccine favor therapeutics getting us shit, even thats gamble hefty price tag boot hospital stay. 

This gonna long haul situation man...

And Im giving two pennies but, going go well, dammit......

We got DICK 4 months - 5 u count february.  administrative fine, would need sued forced pay Imagine that. new information regarding new virus, comes new medical safety protocol. It’s almost like science something... Trump doubled stupid telling WSJ people wear masks promote public health, signal disapproval him. warms heart. Though incredibly fucked Mongolia heavily hit Navajo Nation US government. Makes feel sick American, honestly. someone explain science possible one person get 100 people sick. Obviously guy sick short literally coughing everyone coming contact every single person. one person produce enough virus infect people virus know ? Realistically work gloves leather hands contaminated put on, essentially wearing thick skin animal virus going easily (if all) pass glove. work gloves mesh nylon gloves like kind dock worker might wear, that's different story. 

As far worrying hands contaminated goes, real issue keeping away mouth, eyes, etc. Getting virus bare skin cuts not, big deal. Getting mouth/nose big deal. 

One thing might help relax little think virus terms load exposure. people get sick tend people exposed virus heavy load period time. Like people sing choir practice room hour infected person, share office them, live them. chances somebody getting person coughing side parking lot touching shopping car touched hour ago sitting sun super low, especially person wearing mask gloves touching mouth/eyes/nose without washing hands. 

It's shitty deal public right now, especially many stupid assholes this, also want nervous breakdown thinking every time person sneezes somewhere parking lot work good dead. That's kind stress want walk around every day. least concert last 3:46.  I’m absolutely confident aren’t planning. actually gave shit, would’ve done March shit started really hitting fan. fun drinking bleach, youtube doctor example loaded question, “when stop beating wife”, contains assumption beat wife previously. That’s makes loaded question. question “did Trump tell people ingest Clorox” contains assumptions. don’t even know loaded question means. It’s past curfew dude, go bed parents find you’re still online. nuts. took big hit, economy. science denier. Yes, scientists said get again. develop vaccine need vaccine every year doubtful 50 % effective. virus cause organ damage. probably affect longevity. severely affecting children. 2 cousins it. need try live damage suffering. Meanwhile want blab herd immunity though magic last forever. Keep dreaming. Maine. 50/50 whether people wear masks one turn away wearing one. Source testing? thought testing actually going well asked elementary aged kids trust kids school keep hands washed masks on, said afraid go back. Wow exactly like us Texas  mean rain parade true healthy necessarily protect you, bodybuilders often healthy. Big muscles correlated health. Strength training good you, many bodybuilders pretty awful organ health (particularly kidneys/liver) due supplementation/steroids extreme dieting use maintain image. better test everyone! Unfortunately mess testing much ration gets tested timely fashion, happening many places, think testing change medical outcome priority. Considering school year hasn’t even started already outbreak bar nearby you’re right.

That’s I’m telling people it’s going spread. MSU everything stop it, President background Infectious Disease knows he’s doing. issue authoritarian state can’t regulate people campus, spreads there, they’ll bring back campus way add feet distance?

Chicago case demographic data doesn’t support idea careful enough though. 18-29 test positivity rate trending higher portion confirmed case also. easier data access using link apply filters see bit. I’d guess it’s magnitude socializing aren’t wearing masks public stores Couple thoughts.

The market invest parts economy equally. Clearly, now, investment shifted losers (like airlines) winners (like Amazon). part economy continue well despite rise new cases, market concentrated that.

Secondly, can't discount strong jobs report. Why? Even states closing back again, many not.

Sweden is, knowledge, first country world *enacting* ‘starter’ policies seem moving towards enacting broader ‘immunity passport’ policy (a [other countries seem *planning* similar *enacted* Sweden). Granted, dipping toe water this, cautiously too, seem like step direction. 

Immunity passports REALLY bad idea. issued [guidance advising them]( [Nature article good overview immunity passports are, frankly, dystopian]( fact, version “immunity passports” played role Margret Atwood’s Oryx Crake trilogy, dystopian triology.

And say it, irony citizens US took seriously without essentially begging/pleading government officials, probably could avoided lockdowns social distancing / masks help stem rate infection *from beginning.*

A tragic comedy errors around, yes CDC Fauci deserve criticism confusing people effectiveness masks beginning. whole problem now, fact message muddied beginning good chunk many stubbornly opposed wearing one. undermined credibility, even reasoning time sound.

Probably not. many Americans selfish caught cult personality yeah that’s referring to, eastern half PA close Philly NYC we’ve taking situation seriously western part PA. Well stats alone, lump 8000+ deaths heart attack states.

And vast majority would survived hospital care, even gotten COVID-19.

Fear isn’t rational people running lives via stats feelings.

Because regardless human feelings, universe sorts things numbers.  No, worked births, deaths marriages registration, realise always way. discover something mean existed. Yes headlines today misleading. yeah unreasonable orders cause many follow. make illegal wear masks want people wear them. Agreed. happened people keep blaming too. 

I get could made better concise statements whole thing media intentionally boiling complicated subjects misleading headlines worse.  Welcome death cult America, everything made votes matter. haha fake like Taiwan's email  Florida shows us lot things. hate auto mod.

Does media incentive continually push fear so-called spikes surges? numbers quantify ""surge"" ""spike"" NEWS 9 - completely arbitrary words numbers behind them?


Do good news stories non-overloaded ICUs falling death counts bring fewer views spikes surges? People like always point BLM protests never mention “re-open” protests actively masks social distancing measures.

I already wrote thread. need repeated times, enough wrote 99% persons heart attack survive without hospital intervention.

But problem people 1000 different medical problems, heart attacks. Hand sanitizer pussies. Move along. problem here. /s Keep going Florida!! high go?? agree. general scientific literacy shockingly low among us! hope society manages one day manages document detail various messaging, planning, intervention failures. rural America need masks too? stores rural America people go to?

But yeah, I’m NC definitely support dumb idiots. Staying home. since march.  saying 2000 10000 people screaming could spread coronavirus scientific basis right? inconvenient talk negatively protestors. science cant even apply? science? like scream racist people cant talk? Right now, *who* people believe, *what* believe. That's united consistent message important. everyone doctors, government, media, sports celebrities, religious leaders promoted use masks we'd much higher compliance rate.

We logic reason day, takes us far. people follow people, ideas. It’s almost like energy could directed representatives cut additional funding suffering businesses ‘lazy’ unemployed, know. would require caring others solely one’s self. Sooo. It’s even noon. That's medical reasons, moral judgment anger. 

If anything, society benefit vaccinating people reckless. 

This sounds like people want universal health care, want exclude people support universal health care policy.  Kind defeats purpose. Ya baby! Beat that! Herd immunity come! Would require 100k tests day Oh no! Disney go buisness without you. Trumps job make sure governors send old people back nursing homes, remind like 45% deaths. workers live Florida. think depend largely whether reinfection happens, immunity works regarding different strains. could get million. could even pass million.

I'm doctor, know antibody test also large-scale efficacy tests (Phase III) give thousands vaccine tell go regular lives, later bring back test COVID-19. say, 200 people placebo got sick, 14 people given vaccine got (since vaccine may 100% efficient), vaccine would positive effect. Yup, lot's suppositions zero studies! Congrats! huge increase testing. hospitalizations going up? Maybe assume going happen exactly like happened every fucking time like NY Italy idiot skies limit!  LMFAO 5% beyond crazy. favour lax restrictions mask wearing even statement nuts. course is. Greed always plague humanity. one wants give something ""free."" Influenza COVID all. wife disabled 4-year-old daughter.

I hope he’s gone never know. Fox conservative outlets social media bubbles live entirely different reality, they’re usually kind people vote every election, without fail. definitely election, gladly open defiance Coronavirus many simply believe problem even exists. rock vs. hard place situation sure, simply opening regardless mean eventually America gonna stuck it, monstrous economic losses already suffered nothing. right?

The best thing done Washington get thumb get proper income support package assembled places like Florida properly lock without costing many people everything. looks like Florida flattening curve, along y-axis.... Unemployment numbers drop people kicked off, states 12 weeks. Also, worked Universal Disneyworld, parks disgusting. People touching everything. virus field day. could get behind.

Thank insight!  president makes size turds political. gonna YUGE.  Yeah really don’t get man entire process ordering bars antithesis social distancing. Everybody lines like pigs trough squeezing together get bartenders attention, yells orders directly bartender face. Unless bouncers spreading people out, sounds like nightmare, impossible.

The way bars safely table service only. bar know that. can't make money ignore protocol. 

This say protests bad, bars worse. That's incredibly high rate😱 Hybrid learning still exposes students families coronavirus. Damned damned don't.

I’m patri0tic, means like country lot don’t want live anywhere else. doesn’t mean like everything country approve current government. doesn’t mean I’m opposed reforms either, fact support many don’t think USA living potential right now.

If instead unquestioningly devoted USA thought #1 matter what, would make nati0nalist, patri0t. People confuse terms lot don’t mean thing. depends see jobs virus biggest problem. seems solve neither risks. believe we’re smarter species planet. I'm confused. always meant ""posts"" general meaning - comments I'm pretty sure guy content removed 

The ones I've seen trolls managed make angry enough break rule one replies - usually rule number 1.

Even know typical troll behaviour aimed tricking breaking rule report you, still sometimes easy forget heat see next time poster gets critiqued? 

Thank (accidentally) admitting critique aimed poster, rather content articles posts arguments.  They're addicts fantasy experiences. That’s dangerous game. gets asymptomatic we’re even screwed. Yeah, number ""boating accidents"" likely increase. Dude , asked another poster thought Tiananmen square see sino ton downvotes. One guy asked felt slavery, past. Lol. guy post saying doesnt believe virus originated wuhan. mind asking, that?

Ignorance? Political bias? Resentment goverment? Lack education? 

Honest question. still op still forgot change accounts. think important piece think countries use shared air conditioning ventilation like south. I’ve seen many classes outside open windows Europe, something wouldn’t able here. lot concern we’re seeing spikes south due everyone inside AC right now. 

And like said, MASKS. hospitals fill up, school still debating parts buildings teachers wear masks (I think answer everywhere unless you’re eating). There’s also lot implication students won’t asked wear them, somehow I’m expected still show up. thought Hawaii closed borders, successfully quarantined visitors, pretty much contained covid early on? never true something changed? Got both, pretty easy actually. daily new cases double size every week. 

The number infections doubling every 13 16 days 

example:  6/12 total cases 70,000  6/28 total cases: 140,000 Lol, spikes heard last month half protesting. Nope we're worried people getting together backyard outside 4th July correct. They’re already mass producing it. US already secured 300 million doses delivered end year. recently start hospital work. admitted *and* relevant symptoms. They've also stopped furloughing workers accidentally exposed virus, told self monitor temperatures 🤦‍♀️ wont even test employees. report individuals retesting? Many people tested negative positive. 

The hilarious fact loving hinge TEST NUMBERS UP!!! OMG WORLD ENDING!!! I'm Portuguese. one firsts hit shit. locked 12th March and, opinions, including mine, lockdown started ease 18th May. business owner. I'm husband father. took serious financial hit April May.
I doubt priorities are.

The government aided layoffs, family assistance financed companies condition maintaining jobs.
About 15 per cent GDP tourism services. crashed 90 per cent.
Jobless rate less rose 50%
Exports crashed, lot business halted.

This said WAY better situation US Brazil. carefully slowly coming this.
I sure economy suffer less theirs. Hell, companies good June...
Simply put, took seriously others.

For sake, please take seriously, isolate, lockdown necessary.
If not, regret it.

And use damn mask... mean, lots people going read this. spread accurate information important. I'm sorry like whatever dont like someone expanding idea that's exactly healthy conversation look like. Yea, definitely. Georgia’s fairly open long time people go another company, bail company falters! There's point comparing them. Two different circumstances. I'm explaining kids probably traumatic experience ever had, especially they're old enough remember life used them. worse person attended party got infected knew sick! WTF? Why???? hospital minor procedure week felt terrible nurses said 150 cases peak, can't even imagine Florida's hospitals staff going go through... reminds friends's father contracting work Florida...

America become worlds strongest superpower? seriously, many people (not obv) extremely stupid?

Like doi doi stupid. People = Patriots.

I can't take that... HIPAA actually nothing wearing masks, neither ADA. People also using N95's filter exhaled air, whole point mask (which cause negative health effect). I’m Missouri neighborhood pools open since June 1st. limit(30 smaller pool 50 bigger pool also chairs spaced 6feet apart plus lifeguards keep count doesn’t crowded also one hour limit capacity others enjoy pool also bathrooms limited one person sanitized use). knowledge one caught coronavirus pools capacity 3pm-7pm weekend(we go 10am-11am weekdays ones typically sometimes may people stay apart). don’t see issue pools long limits amount people. ""...where appointed the Senior Executive Service and granted a top secret security clearance.""

He tell truth, entire story, actually going even wanted to. Tom hospital. intentionally vague symptoms minor calling ""case blahs"". famous person like came yeah ""yeah really bad"", lots people would taken heart. national coin shortage we've got going on, banks would love you. Finland keep seeing feedback travel quarantines unenforceable, true. big deterrent corporate travel. local govt demanding quarantine upon arrival there's point sending employee meeting, training, sales pitch, etc. Sure somebody comment crackerjack small company gaf rules large companies go local regulations. 

Business travel large proportion frequent fliers, even affect private travelers all, think affect overall amount interstate travel, good thing Congress, Senate, local office... pretty much political appointment comptroller... don’t to. Kids touch things belong you. easily spread. 138/10,000 chance receptive anal sex, 11/10,000 numbers assume protection, prophylactic medication, currently treated HIV believe anybody says things like ""most Americans"". Hockey work decided stay Canada.

Yeah, masks already part uniform. know! Let’s stop testing altogether! Oh course. Still silly protests global pandemic. Wearing mask make anyone immune catching it. fewer overall deaths means uncounted Covid deaths Phrasing! half country obese. Fuck Pence, fuck Trump, &amp; fuck supporters. Traitors America then, caused chaos. wants chaos. Long $USA!

Oh wait... wrong subreddit. course disagree. quite leap conclude experts changing minds conclusively proves earlier statements hide collective malicious intent.

All put singular focus masks ignore everything else gratify anger frustration. I'm willing play ball. really going let Disney kill everyone's parents Also right schools open. mean tested positive !  I’m pretty sure told quarantine two weeks?  maybe say ok u tested positive .  
  guy either way idiot. Indeed, following orders. I'm gonna watch hell covid miniseries 2040. Get supplies weeks hunker down. Good luck. Comment age well. someone works school, trying picture months, can’t. 

Temperature checks 800-3,000 kids every morning? Bus social distance? Classroom social distance? Hallways social distance? Cafeteria? Playground? happens kid who’s taken bus fever? happens someone front office gets sick... tests positive COVID? elderly teachers substitutes, already short is. 

When baby, got serious, rare infection. immune system collapsed. doctors asked mom living. said worked elementary school. doctors told needed find new job would bring home germs worked school. Schools full germs. Can’t wait EVERYONE gets 🤗😍👻 comment sounds like you’re trying obtuse purpose Alabama college students states' fifth graders. far enforcement goes, think anyone seriously expects thoroughly enforced, quarantine NY/NJ/CT. see ""message"" type announcement. 
 
If keeps small chunk people high-infection-growth states reconsider travel plans, that's better nothing. 25% fewer people coming Florida Texas better 0% fewer. introverts interesting hobbies prevail! Guidance administration???

What happened? Yeah run president good. 😂 Fuck Walmart. fantastic news company... accurate quickest test it?? huge news. piece guidance use awful carefully language.

""UP 30% patients required hospitalization""

""May""

""Can""

Then switches focus known consequences ventilator care long term sedation.

Millions people contracted COVID-19 survived point.

Maybe 2-ish% people require hospital care. to, maybe, 30% fraction level lasting impact?

It would seem low side that. Otherwise, articles faces stories must surely 10s 1000s permanently severely harmed? 10,000 (or number) cases, median age cases one relevant important things care estimating potential deaths hospitalizations 10,000.

The median age 35 Florida positives different scenario age 60 whatever NYC months ago.

Median population age Sumter County Florida around 67, Seminole County around 38, example, covid19 positives Seminole reportedly median age 26 two weeks ago.

Seminole 16 deaths 2,202 cases.

Sumter 17 deaths 317 cases.

All ages spread viruses ages, lower median age Florida suggests younger areas like Seminole spread places like Sumter, equals better want lower amount Nice, nice, baby! Honestly, I'm sorry struggles. hope continue find strength persevere. Hahahahha sure hit beaches bars weekend!! Would percentage population per day make sense per 100k? feel like lines scale prospective trials already done haven’t positive. realize everything related HCQ going get lot attention, retrospective study isn’t valuable controlled clinical trials we’ve already had. Texas Florida showing oddly lower death rate states. Texas classified 5200 deaths pneumonia statistically that’s beyond belief. It’s likely 4100 \*pneumonia\* deaths actually \*pneumonia due COVID19.\* Deliberately deceptive. even fully read studies? 3 looked through, discuss effectiveness facemask preventing infection wearer. one saying facemask going stop getting sick, meant prevent spreading others. Bezos liberal conservative? Like going office work load horseshit least half country? meant next summer. like said would reopen Easter, meant next Easter. get secret decoder ring mail? Sequels, remakes, etc. mention evolutions monsters get faster &amp; kill quicker. think we'll find permanent damage frightening number cases - double digits percentages least. i'm talking disposable masks, cartridges. cartridges valved (emphasis valved) respirators, exhale (where moisture is) go cartridges, whereas disposable, non-valved mask, everything goes mask itself. know fuck assumption made i'm trying ""get wearing mask"", wear respirator everywhere, relax downvotes suggested piece cloth get wet exhale 12 fucking hours. WOW NEW RECORD!!!!! Much appreciated. tried Google Anatoly name produces lot results. like googling name Jeff. Idk man...Hawaii arrested people broke quarantine. I'm sure much less enforceable NY, asking intend break quarantine, don't. going pay people’s bills 65% population get January (to achieve herd immunity) 30M people per month? Right? current testing. Remember lots infected earlier. study, contrary thread title. model, still r(t) less 1. Exactly. swear, people get percents work something.

I want go record saying think US taking seriously enough. said...

15,000,000 * .05 = 750,000

That's ""only"" 75% million. Contrary poster you. that's whole country. million dead Florida alone. agree fuck track trace.. infected would best knowledge tell officials inform people contact can't even convince people wear mask, good luck getting install government surveillance devices lmao climat, like clamato? like tomato juice? grammar spelling hot either maybe chill lmao.

NY, TX, CA, FL populous states. Yet deaths staying constant 60. . .  disagree, us really anything, states actually try, us MN leading way nation, even us succumb virus point shows number reported pneumonia deaths year vs average years 1999-2018. data solid gets. Hoe Lee shit. Hopefully help curb numbers pressure states follow suit. entire nation would mandate masks would much faster many people get stay us. man's leadership killing Americans. Said nobody ever? run tests, curve flatten right?

/s 100% agree. said March, mask folks. would never become stupid political stance. time became weary, would 2nd nature. Instead, got everyone accustomed wearing masks, sprung change. Lmao. kid yet that's people really rationalize things. dumb people? UK here, say that...  difference without distinction? Obviously early say sure, that's numbers seem say far. know city protest-related spike everybody predicting, cases already low anyway. 

Also, protests largely confined spaces, open transmission seems much lower enclosed spaces. No, think reporting countries necessarily consistent either, hence point. Florida really well previously that's good, someone better figure what's going wrong now. Best wishes mate. Hopefully things turn fine. comes boys!! Fuck guy!

Edit: constituents must wondering what's going right told something completely opposite 4 fucking months. Glad it. FUCK guy others following suit next week complicit deaths 130,000 people score political points. Fuck 'em all! see many people saying sub lately. hesitance say young people better?

Yes - people ages disobeying orders/not wearing masks suppose average age corona patients dropped much spreading like wildfire among young people? Young people aren’t wearing masks still insist socializing sans mask. “I’ve heard it’s like getting chest cold”

Over over. Article start May? age well. Never said BLM symbol hate. every reason angry. pretend didn’t hand causing covid spread. 

And yes, denier comes protesta causing spread. person average intelligence need study see mass gathering people wearing masks contributed spike cases. time energy even producing study waste. 

Next you’re going tell need cite source proving water wet. mean I’m
Sure think think might be, since don’t study can’t really sure. 

Lol. Keep supporting lockdown don’t stop getting unemployment. Don’t worry, rest us grown ups keep working. Trump already received Nobel peace prize?

Seriously though, interview trash. happy chemistry professor weighing in. someone pisses cop belligerent sovereign citizen lite they’re going get fined bet Well good news zombie apocalypse probably deadly there, denture wearers people osteoporosis. mean “the government doesn’t want give holiday pay”. Yup. Take drive Atlantic Avenue Virginia Beach see point made loud clear. places even employees masks. health department can't enforce it, I've seen. Cases rising area.

My old boss lets anyone without mask bc ""we can't ask people medical exemptions."" I'm sure one.  yup literally yesterday Isn’t we’re doing? mean agree we’re failing, seems path we’re on. Read details. barely matter. get wrong, better nothing, good enough.

[The Actual Governor control opening opening state? Abbott hidden bunker LT Sociopath charge? Come on. Betteridge says make love elsewhere. There's plenty sides wear masks. almost feels like fibonacci sequence. next thursday see 23,000 new cases. Americans value human life all. simple. problem massacring civilians whatever country currently decided hate. let tens thousands country die lack medical care every year. Oh, see. Wearing face covering public proven one effective ways slow spread COVID-19,” said Governor Abbott.

Lmao Abbott acting like cares science public safety. doubt enforced either way.  Unfortunately Gov. Abbott dollar short day late cold, cold. won’t. Fox Need came favor today too. So, yeah. Corona blm protests disappear day election. coincidence bro. Read details. barely matter. get wrong, better nothing, good enough.

[The Actual what? point ""like Wuhan"" underinformed statement, already ""like Wuhan"" best. see barely anyone masks Kroger Meijers last time went, neighbors wear huge 4th parties...and partied lock down. need move part Michigan live lol Yeah know states like could find fault line right place use unimaginable amount explosives would actually possible somehow separate state CONUS?

There literally nothing good news. Fox News running 24/7 infotainment COVID-19 dangerous cold, masks mean suffocate die.

Density Fox News viewing highly correlated county level increases COVID-19 cases second wave. know countries EU, Belgium, Austria, Czech Republic Poland largely open and, part, long now.

Pretty sure Germany Denmark largely open too. Yeah think we're bad July sure got month new cases increase, like 2-3 weeks. Also, almost doubled deaths week compared last week, upcoming week good indicator trends be. 

And deaths new indicator beating virus? financial costs, long term health damage, remedial actions still TBD. thing still massively unknown, also people getting sick surviving right way handle either. guess that's whole pull bootstraps American mentality. nypost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Wow... congrats guess. Abbott right thing month would made difference protesters wearing masks proven reason spike. I'm agreeing Sounds like Americans soon dying regular beds then... shouldn’t worry much schools, least elementary school. Denmark, discovered kids dont really spread disease like do. 

Disney world fucking nightmere though Didnt Fauci say US doesnt even enough needles distribute vaccine nationally let alone able get enough vaccine stable deaths means number deaths? number deaths led COVID one top causes death country?

Further, even mortality rate falls, people get COVID, think that's going overall number deaths? NE bring numbers business usual. listen kooks. Spoiler alert: 99, 998 okay.  Good. may governors never live down. He's elected separately. technically really need answer governor Trump wants people medicare save money, know old people dying cut cost, making look like gop saved bunch money. 

That's they've pushing re-opening, people get 'offered' back jobs choose getting sick working, getting unemployment insurance. fucked! Related study Yale, *[Estimation Excess Deaths Associated COVID-19 Pandemic United States, March May mentions gap reported COVID-19 deaths estimated all-cause excess deaths varied among states (Table; eFigure 3 Supplement). instance, California 4046 reported deaths due COVID-19 6800 (95% prediction interval, 6100-7500) excess all-cause deaths, leaving 41% excess deaths unattributed COVID-19 (Table). **Texas Arizona even wider gaps, approximately 55% 53% excess deaths unattributed COVID-19, respectively.** contrast, better agreement reported COVID-19 deaths excess all-cause deaths Minnesota, 12% unattributed COVID-19 ... Brits took crowded pubs chant “f*** coronavirus!” 

The pubs Britain even re-opened yet. Since dont believe problem, i'm wondering concept many pneumonia deaths common states exploding covid case counts, many pneumonia deaths reported year. Florida thousands pneumonia deaths mroe year time last decade least, significant percentage change.

As ""waited two weeks nothing's happened"" deaths trail 2 weeks behind reported cases. two weeks starts now.

Celebrating death count low cases TIME HIGH like throwing party half time Superbowl. celebration bit pre-mature. might lead, team carrying *all* momentum. RI rowdiest BLM protests country. NYC huge dense. serious protests too, idk Connecticut...but 4 states best country.

Get rhetoric. work. proven practice work quite well. perfect? No, nothing is. essential part plan, minor inconvenience. cousin Florida got COVID recently, even though wore mask social distanced. doesn’t seem super severe point, can’t taste anything understand hospice care is. Here's comment explaining what's source? one making extraordinary claim here. Back stop polluting internet. Worrying us bogans lot like americas rednecks, hard rely lockdown properly/follow proper precautions Fucking ooooooooh.... gets Never late. Write legislatures. He's called virus' bluff moved life. majority world...apart basement dwellers reddit apparently. Honestly surprised took long get That’s true, separately elected therefore easily odds sounds like something Monty Python, belongs beside parrot sketch terms infuriating bullshit. sorry Americans deal terrible health care system think 'freedom' thing. vast majority US citizens favor re-opening started. polls remain high support mask wearing lock downs. (TLDR: 70%/30% split favor maintaining difficulty politicians not. media loves report minority folks protesting makes good television. common sense medical workers, tattoo artists piercers. required masks prevent droplets infecting you. biggest fear blood works way saliva etc. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* see number tests % tests resulting positive increasing, indicating spread can't solely explained increased testing. assumption lockdown NY effect, much evidence support that. Ok, turn FL, Texans fill beaches! Well completely wrong seems conflating county jails state prisons. know fact Pennsylvania 0 private prisons yet source puts private prison population PA 0.1-10%. source unreliable. 

Even account county jails, vast majority private correctional facilities are, private corporations still small minority incarcerated population. 

It's Boogeyman left likes use. actual problem. Talking takes away actual issues criminal justice reform. Solution: pay someone $1000/month you.  Oh makes lot sense. Thank No, need shutdown vaccine. That's silly hyperbolic funny talk. Whatcha follow CDC/WHO guidelines. 👍 don’t think legally binding ... Gross negligence alleviate liability. secondary exposure? individuals sign waivers? mandate enforce quarantines. Insurance companies damn sure give travel coverage either. !remindme 2 weeks somebody politicize mask? Serious question btw.  think enough people learned basic game theory.

Options; Wear mask  | Mask

REAL; Protection     | Covid

HOAX; Uncomfortable/Waste time| Freedom breathe

You pick column youre in. pick? Let’s talk that, it’s convenient right /s I'm also saying China good, though Article pertains Mongolia sovereign last checked. Yep, checked, still is. Yeah work healthcare organization LA even surge like, 35 inpatient covid patients. We’re losing money due lack office visits. hear it’s getting bad San Bernadino though. talking party. I’m taking me. don’t agree everything party says. think politicization masks atrocious awful hurts America. 

I ask question didn’t answer - what’s science I’m rejecting? must rejecting sort science you’re using litmus test, right? Number 4 friend working Starbucks drive thru. Business usual mask covers coffee bean smell. Number 9 friend got furloughed retail job went back online classes full time! Yay number friends! finally stupid working intended. father lot Mexican friends business partners. situation seems, biggest problem wealth gap. Many Mexicans afford quarantine avoid virus. large portion cannot. entire livelihoods depends day day jobs. contact, furthermore people live close towns villages. It’s difficult quarantine practice social distancing. medical infrastructure also damaged current president well. worse part money isn’t answer. father ready donate lot money help people nothing address massive inequality poor medical infrastructure. North Central PA? current doubling rate anout 2 weeks stays constant 100k per day mid month...and thats likely baked already. Odds wont shut stay rate increase till end month 200k per day?

That sounds completely insane ""If ~~slap~~touch here, close."" learnt something new today, thank you!  Tons tons people heard decided ""oh, happens coastal states; happen here. 

Experience makes harsh teacher. We're going repeat New York's curve different states different times. Thank you! Finally someone gets it. taking getting CBSNews articles, Huff Post news articles, etc. etc. etc. putting together own.

I enough college health/medical classes belt say CoVid overblown especially compared viruses pre-vaccine past.

Even though low severe symptoms parents died disease, caught someone 'exposing us visiting us' 'from us going out' rehab center Dad shipped home said rehab center without CoVid test done Mom I. still job even i'm 'feeling unmotivated'. didnt, would get fired  ""and provide common Defence **general Welfare** United States.""
I dunno, feels like providing general welfare could argued include pandemic response Part lower testing cases growing rapidly state either. Oregon amazing job least 40 states far. guess shutdown till vaccine correct? Everyone reddit said longest time need lockdown slow spread give hospitals time. course cases going go opened, everyone knew that. Hospitals better treatment plans resources. Places like Nevada don’t need shut current data. Appears many “success stories” 
Are overrun like everyone else, 
Korea, Japan, Australia today 2100 cases hour selfish childish comment I’ve ever seen. really hope sarcastic. Well, better late never guess ... Yeah may request moved guess political, makes absolutely sense me. Even masks work well, bad wear. I'm liberal state liberal city that's probably difference. Obviously, I'd rather wear one, understand freakout. Good luck Florida. far deaths low, that's good. every young person hospitalized suddenly saying regret actions underestimated severity virus? question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies. Now, properly respond entire comment move on. think 500 deaths day around low point give take. even 500/day annualized make 3rd largest cause death. deaths/day certainly going up. wonder one it. didn’t say “with sugar top!” Britain compared this? Probably nearly bad, right? God get South Park episode it’s funny anymore 😫 responded entire comment. respond question: Trump tell people ingest Clorox? I’ve already seen paragraphs long non-Answer question responded multiple times. answer : Trump tell people ingest Clorox?” Answering typical copy paste something I’ll take “no”. Speaking experience, they've reporting mostly people straight died needed hospitalized only. 

They've mixing lately, stated reported 20%+ fatality rate raised eyebrows international medical community. going argue you, true. 

I’m probably bitter right feels hypocritical sense. Guess I’ll ignore country stripped rights millions people within past day frightened adhere treaty. Funny year ago number American deaths disaster astronomical. ""oh 3k many"" become desensitized humans around us risk getting sick &lt;2% oxygen decrease.

My mom disown almost 36 years, take crap. 70+, divide we're experiencing really fucking hurts. blame Facebook (all social media's curation - mean, last time (nonspecific) found way /r/conspiracy? know pridefully hijack controversial sorts now, too).

I decided going children many years ago climate denial much, much more... even imagine much going sour. it’s roughly 3.3% need hospitalized right? so, roughly 2.5 times official numbers, that’s 4150 hospitalizations day rising. Asian countries generally prepared pandemic huge contract tracing teams PPE stockpiles medical workers. 

I've noticed that, Toronto, people wearing masks go much closer people. mask effective may actually harm good. Forsyth County Parks Rec Georgia resumed classes sorts masks required. Lunacy. Dumbest shit I’ve read yet. Gavin Newsom nothing model leader right now. California spiking little right much room surges. Anyone saying anything contrary simply arguing facts. real number likely already millions. Even U.S. number deaths likely 20-30% undercount. 

Mexico ""poor"" country compared U.S. actually par China terms GDP per capita. Imagine countries like India 20% money per person Mexico multiple times population density dealing. 

Half million cases confirmed country 1.1 billion kind density? Horseshit. Numbers China, populous authoritarian nation world, likely bullshit too.  Going lot people’s identity everywhere. Ignoring article, worldwide death rates pronounced increase vs past year. directly tied observance COVID-19. debate directly attributable not, combination indirectly attributable directly attributable deaths due COVID19. 14 day quarantine problem case. structural problem building (and/or elevator) caused unknowingly infect family downstairs her, family unknowingly went infect others.

That's home quarantine banned China, except Shanghai. [tag Finnish. 🙂 That's well good one friend, four friend nine friend? please get closure numbered friends? 41.0 minute delay fetching comments.

Maybe talk little bit source we’re going stop happening again... could walking right worst disaster world seen yet virus Texas.

I really hope able lower cases soon hurricane season far off. cousin Mexico said everyone town carrying like normal. Government anything.

Only safety measures place local Cartel. safety checks entrance town. also ask business town, turning away outsiders. Along care packages food essentials.

This Cartel culture continue issue. step government failed people.

Another cousin doctor genuinely fear what's ahead him. live northern Baja... selfish idiots LA OC SD come spread awesomeness country can't handle even good leadership perfect response due infrastructure resources...   college students tho ? Much hate Donald Trump, think anything says rubbish, remind article read believe either. maybe thinking? ALSO, quite hard get hospitalized, health system collapse: enough beds, supplies, etc.

Its collapsed, actually under-used. hospitals near live counted COVID hospitals, designated 1 2 floors COVID patients, leaving rest ""normal"" patients empty.

For sure arent enough supplies, theres lot space many hospitals Ive told couple doctor friends mine. Ehhh, maybe? would need compliance, deaths ensuing overwhelmed hospitals would monumental. want cases, know stop testing. /s think people skeptical contract tracing could used pandemic ends think valid skepticism. Ever since NSA spying us, I'm skeptical government says treat citizens actually treat citizens.  murderer. Congratulations afraid murdering people.

This funny. spot anything short terror allowed around here. I've heard said good; test, means it.

Of course, person say pretty dumb. That’s politics you. actually empathize Newsom. opposition sides, us want shut health safety vs. anti mask wearers claim rights infringed on. Would love buy ticket China madness could see good here. Yes, can: primary care doctor, Steven Pondek viewpoint based information coming across desk.

The latest news stories Johns Hopkins Hospital website subject CoVid.

The latest news stories USAToday, Huff Post, etc.

If want specifics? Sorry: you. No, rich dumbass idiots. blame problems full shut back March/April. half assed many places deemed ""essential"" have. like China even Europe literally everything shutdown, would've ""flattened curve"" could've this. Switzerland scared made wearing masks mandatory public transport new cases exploding. reported 137 new cases yesterday. Lmao idiots everywhere, US major idiot charge federal government, lots idiots charge certain states. 

But Brazil idiots charge, Mexico does, others too. Interesting. What’s medical science reject? I’m conservative must rejecting something, right? Enlighten me. basically turning dollars dollars? 50,000 daily cases it'll take 11 years reach 60% 13 years reach 70% infections. Lmao absolutely play football year. Baseball hockey well also important remember peer reviewed studies say contagious. know point prevalent branch mutations. may entirely due hitting Italy NYC got nailed actually contagious strain.

Lots researchers tried stop false narrative materially different strain simply don’t know probably isn’t likely. rare confirmed case group selection. document shared suspicious spike pneumonia cases recorded year? CDC maybe? even based article think zero influence death numbers NYC? chose first city US get hit multiple things wrong, fault virus completely new. honestly think picking outlier IFR makes sense? im craving n bad rn AMLO MALOTE! 
DEVUÉLVEME EL CHAYOTE! countries going access generic version way cheaper. 

The U.S. pay $70 million develop drug, it’s obvious would have”dibs,” Gilead could allow generic version sold “wealthier” countries they’re selfish greedy assholes. Thoughts prayers Get fucking US. Surrounded controlled complete idiots anyone survive it, still America.

Expect much much higher. killed 2 4 times many people flu last season already. remindme! 3 weeks seems fairly socially distanced me. Maybe pulls he's closer people. That's do. Better get gene pool make babies. Yeah... Stay away... We're full. Fuck off. passed Illinois. shitshow way long. Even now, cases increasing sit home reading dog. Canada continent? don’t phds Bronze Age book that’s never wrong There's way fewer staff children, double number infections ... schools reopen, pretty much expect every elementary school teacher get COVID. Things going worse Florida Governor refuses anything. country 54K cases today 7/1. Please don’t complacent, wish best. numbers high average American dumbass can't wear mask follow simple rules. need 70% immunity make plummet. even 30-50% would gradually bring down. Places hit hardest like NY, Lombardy, etc aren’t recovering virus “moved on,” everyone decided wear masks. It’s also many people aren’t able carry it. Make famous, everyone! Guys funny anymore, seriously. need help? citizens foreign countries help you? stupidly politicized it, so-so believe around time NY gaining cases, assumption healthcare workers would need masks average Joe. pretty much face covering + social distancing + common sense trick, us US excuse wearing mask.

It’s easiest thing currently it’s gets way easier shot stellar treatment still manage mess up. feel thing help us currently Trump starts wearing one advocates (mainly ads MAGA masks). gives masks green light supporters, they’ll hopefully follow droves fringe aren’t wearing masks. serious issue abscesses places teeth right sometimes hours severe pain exposed nerves due neglected infections even sure go call fix mess mouth. likely gonna need oral surgeon rather dentist transportation biggest issue. pandemic made whole cluster-fuck situation even worse. built cabin jungle ride pandemic out. isolation rapidly driving insane. feel like whole world going experience collective PTSD pandemic governments’ “response” it.

I’ve lost trust people, government, money even friends (who partying like everything fine). can’t deal gaslighting. Atlanta native here:

Wife PhD prof Emory, lots friends local medical people

Things bad yet. might/probably get bad soonish. 

Although plenty elective surgeries going one considerably less per COVID. 

Really none local hospitals profit yet need stay water; hence lay offs

Having real national direction state/municipality guess might happen. resulted shutting little need layoffs backstop. 

We sit spiraling case number think quick hospital overload. 

I doubt Atlanta shitstorm within 3 weeks Yeah stores started enforcing way counties mandated it. places even offer mask forgot there's really excuse Nope. people even stop going school. Logos (low-goss) open thru closures. believe untouchable.  newly diagnosed patients die get test results - take days sometimes weeks die. Unfortunately surge positive results inevitably followed surge deaths, 2 weeks later Well already listed bunch, ignored go bizarre rant constitutional crisis created yourself. posted government work supply chains, provide guidance, raise awareness, coordinate testing, perform studies, work governors/mayors, many things. Social distance. Assume cotton mask much firm numbers memes featuring N95 numbers petri dishes Facebook. Good comment! Good remember real cases probably higher mention - tests closer real numbers probably.  


What concerning slope rise new cases hospitalizations. easily get hand pass 250k... Actually chart shows hospitalizations time? remember getting arguments, idiots demanding immediate ""proof"" Florida spike cases. next week people saying ""it's week, where's spike? LOL ISNT ONE YOURE WRONG!"".

Idiots understand relationship cause effect, viruses incubate transmit instantly. **Paging Dr. Pinsky.** Can't hide positivity rate though Except wasn’t using ppe correctly...that part lawsuit filed employer. simple google search would told this. saw news morning work.

... like real? age Google, ignorance wilful. mean link different article? Unless missed it, one included discusses practices increased spread covid, treatment practices. Thanks! old! argument basically America failed virus war

Diplomats given Karen arguments like worried separated kids. Idiots. Right. Italy done unless intending fully lock vaccine available? see perspective absolutely way knowing whether case. would suspect true number total infected 2x+ larger simply testing primarily captured tested hospital January February. Leaving many untested minimal symptoms asymptomatic. unknown time either, reported Sitreps month February, IFRs reportedly estimated SitRep 30, Feb 19, 0.3-1%, suggesting several times cases reported order adjust CFR level whatever value then. currently sits 4%. Speaking feds, going intercept shipment Jared Kushner auction off? countries people. shame public sphere.  cure, scientific report. USA: “Hold Corona.” commend shame financial situation. government lot blood hands. One check given people since pandemic started criminal! good news. Trial error. Stop immediately move testing. difference US political leadership divided even clear courses action like wearing masks. change soon you’ll see sides claim always favor things. hope kind. roughly 1900 members.. I'm hoping eradicated end year. Well anyone caught using protective gear automatically guilty spreading COVID. fine tune details later. cannot comprehend humans literally stupid.

Having showing great lack intelligence common sense. Tuesday, 950 reported positive cases COVID-19 — 307 children 643 staff members — 668 child care locations. Statewide, 12,207 licensed child care operations open, total reported coronavirus cases risen 59 cases mid-May 576 June 23. It’s basically never referred way. “Breathing tube” almost always means endotracheal tube/ventilator semantically. never say someone oxygen nasal cannula “on breathing tube.” Technically breathing tube tube helps breathe, number different types, way use US refer vents. headline written way generate clicks.

hell, google “breathing tube” majority first results referring intubation vents. It’s use term. Gilead licensed Indian pharmaceutical companies develop generic version drugs they’re allowing certain countries generic version. 180 countries buy genetic version. “wealthier” countries buy Gilead higher price, that’s version that’s sold out.

I going educate access internet. wilful ignorance annoying.

Unfortunately surprise me. EXTREMELY irresponsible. 7 audience members could potentially start small localised spike. That's dangerous mentality global communicable disease. :(  Thats fucked. run small business we're turning away people wear mask. We'll request wear one not, dick one, we'll give one. Karen, we've several of, claiming HIPAA can't talk can't wear mask, leave. People also get upset ask people wait outside 10 store. Thanks, America! lot people afraid get medical attention last months died. friends dad died heart failure that’s happening least month convinced would get virus went doctor. flu, bro. serious. public need masks.

As far masks go, I’d say it’s 50/50 customers employees moment, though people wearing March, April, May. manager pretty severe breathing issue can’t wear mask work (she actually pass job, there), apparently means can’t enforce anyone else “it wouldn’t fair.” still wear one time unless I’m eating break.

That's covid specific hospitalizations. opposite leader last guy get onboard that’s Trump. less tests before? Wtf u guys doing? 4 year old. still lacks basic common sense lot things she’s cautious listens warn dangers. #NotAll4YearOlds That’s acute full-on cardiac arrest.

Many people present ER cusp, full-on heart attack avoided.

You also count stroke patients, etc. protests attended GA friends went ATL high mask usage OMG, course confirmed crap. making assumptions, said, quote acknowledges!!!

So it? undercount not? can’t tell trying prove? fortunately websites [one top accredited collect publish data.

and no. 5 percent. long way respond 'yes'. Half year later people still masks issue... Wtf wrong people USA?? find hard wear mask?? live Colorado Michigan quarantined parents started go drinks colorado back march. lot bars started selling drink kits everything need make 6-10 drinks. spendy would totally picnics dinner parties. Title misleading. requirement ""indoor operations"" cease, RESTAURANTS MUST CLOSE. Lots outdoor activities continue usual. new me. wouldn’t allowed get medical appt. tested positive previous infection antibodies? recovered CoVId infection free 6 weeks still wouldn’t allow get work done? Why, why, baby? Hey report Uber well. need know. Take picture see again, proof

I’m driver (*was* pandemic) clear stand issue. wide gulf ""hoarding"" ""preparing go shopping longer normal"" Yup. Therein lies conundrum. [This different see numbers? Makes sense. best testing tests costing money mention whole states falsifying numbers thing ya go. drugs tested pregnant women, it’s considered unethical. Consequently, doctors give almost nothing pregnancy. say prove? said findings study, definitively proved anything. also don’t think we’re gonna get anywhere talking circles like this, think I’ll bow go back forth longer. looking first peak new case new deaths work difference?

You understand new cases peaked much earlier first peak cases reflects increase testing capacity rather actual peak new cases right? even read said? Since rating bad service poorly “cancel culture”? quit gaslighting military unsure people's longterm health aquire COVID-19 makes sense sensitive people enlisting, military assuming extra risk. policy also reversed someone shared press, probably means revoke partially political optics giving substantial credence idea COVID-19 serious illness, President actively stated opposite. life! company transparent ive known poorly, expected. really much company really could, hard feelings them. leave us hanging dry welcome come back things get better. Well see next chapter plays out! Thanks comments! Well, that's good hear. airline flight? Thanks again! depends driver still. friend got uber last week without mask app told needed one. Driver still let ride car.  number saw cases beginning explode 41 percent new cases younger. point cases doubled. means there’s still vulnerable people getting sick used be. Look media sucks sides, there’s fear mongering, there’s opposite takes specific metrics prove point too. tell watched Fox News. fact cases exploding, hospitals rapidly filling capacity hot spots, things continue get worse, proven take steps needed control it. Almost every country thing figured except us. There’s reason that. beaches shouldn’t closed. I’ve seen pictures day opened, seeing yeah need closed people can’t trusted. Yep. It’s bit counterintuitive many thought heat would kill it. indoors seems preferred environment, extreme cold hot seem drivers people tend congregate inside. 

Btw, nice big heat wave coming much America... long ""Triage"" established overwhelmed hospitals . plane ride different transportation people take - like bus subway, example. fool attend concerts, coronavirus not. [well see might meant Arizonan, far off. Heat detrimental cognitive tasks, almost everyone talk to, coworkers, family, friends, almost particularly worried virus.  


I expect see bloom total disaster. kind based political parties completely would say based socioeconomical classes poor vs rich sorta thing, right left policital party backed mostly poor so, right political party backed mostly rich criticizing reaction federal government. 
Honestly right power probably EXACT thing left would criticize way.
So yeah, matter side end people care facts much feeling right. Yeah pretty much throw caution wind tell. live Oklahoma (they state north Texas) pretty damn lax here. work home, partner, still works scheduling hospital (non clinical). go errands take time time.

Unfortunately Oklahoma, population 4 million, administered 320K tests (with 14K positive) taco, 5x5 really poor conclusions drawn:

Penetration cloth masks particles 97% medical masks 44%, 3M Vflex 9105 N95 (0.1%), 3M 9320 N95 (&lt;0.01%).

A 56% reduction penetration viral particles medical masks, yet claim masks don’t prevent spreading virus:

Conclusion: Wearing masks reduce SARS-CoV-2. Nope, authoritarian bullshit Yes. did. SMH. Unlikely. original clusters traced back travellers Europe China, virus infectious earlier clusters would noticeable.

I utterly convinced beginning March. felt sick since swine flu 2009. symptoms except cough wet, dry, get tested time. everyone house except husband sick, band fell ill within week too. I've since tested negative antigens though husband, knows sick with. I’m sorry you’re going that. I’d also preparing worst somehow holding hope best...that’s incredibly reckless behavior don’t understand many taking like joke point confirmed cases fairly useless metric taken isolation. couldnt post link, posted already. though hardware store montgomery county today saw guy mask pulled eating bag chips standing next another guy talking. bother wearing mask? eats chips hardware store? good thing dead people pay taxes then. Wow. far best summary situation seen. Well. Done. HIPPA wearing masks.

I think may translation issue, HIPPA Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act 1996 pertains medical records confidentiality. 

Just wanted explain know is. Glad took additional steps. Hopefully people take seriously, listen science.

Which science? pop science models assume masks work proof [randomized control studies even CDC shows masks dont mechanistic studies support potential effect hand hygiene face masks, evidence 14 randomized controlled trials measures support substantial effect transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza

Mechanistic studies, also known droplet studies models, real world. RCT studies much closer real world show substantial effect. see whether means deaths labeled COVID related loooots excess mortality. hit 20 years. ditch party whenever want still keep sweet sweet gov cheese starting age 60 long pensions still solvent then. 

Thanks well wishes. Best luck yours. Fake news. Trump always wore masks asked country so. Basic math tells covid December?  work highly related field. multiplier using project infections 2.5 nationally. big brain time. : ( like welcome back party lie can't brushed aside. caused untold damage. recovery lie nearly vociferous enough.

Beyond lie, repeatedly softened message offend Trump. People needed hear truth. believe Yale study, 200k died, many many come. could prevented proper advice rapid action. Cases broke normal range June 18th... I'd say pretty soon deaths trending up. starting go week, probably things get bad here, fortunately. they're still going 2 weeks, miraculous maybe something fundamental virus treatments made things lot lot lot better sudden.

We'll see. no, expect deaths trending yet. Soon though expect that, sure, doesn't, yeah, time get bit optimistic! literally said im self quarantining moved back flight, youre presumptive kind ass.

I disabled person auto immune disease history stroke. know risks, thanks  breathability worse synthetic? need buy better cotton mask? I’m somewhat new Reddit...is possible vote comment stupidest thing someone said? Uber drivers reporting refuse ride passenger wear mask, removed platform. Right? go Facebook feed, think Tom Wolf Antichrist. mean similar protests see crazy jump those? I'm airplane right now. 100% masks. middle seats (I actually gave row lucky). service kind. Nobody touched bag done anything. air recirculated HEPA filters every 3 minutes. really seem different activities see link, least Google translation Dutch. LOL. correct call-out, u/XC_Stallion92 dodged question. Look book Job. What? politic said WEARING MASK? REALLY?!

EDIT: oh well, think know meant now, could say something like that? wtf You’re hood human. Thank buying conscience ego. Cheers! someone lived Ithaca, god yeah city desperately needs money students bring. population literally doubles school session businesses based around Chuck e Cheese ball pits used like hot mineral bath.

Only, minerals poo pee particulates. assume mortality numbers come government? Can't fudged also? think it’d beautiful We're talking whole country. We're talking NY though. taking preventative measures.

What stupid comparison way. sudden become obese, gradually gain weight! doctor tells need start losing it. United American packing flights. JetBlue, Delta, others not. Shortest article ever. Previously, according De Gouw, researchers thought 20 percent people infected Covid-19 ended hospital. appears 3.5 percent corona ""If look number people tested, found positive hospitalized, appears many people mild complaints. picture,"" says De Gouw. Lmfao genuinely want get now, summer, I'm working home. way could get it, avoid spreading others, treat controlled environment, able treat elderly family members later line inevitably get it. I'd also avoid getting fall winter flu season peaking along infections bound occur covid. criticism plan know much immunity built getting it, say think confer least immunity likely last least year two more. I'll rather take chances get wait cold flu season. Inb4 thread locked [Arizona 1 months definitely protests. woke virus infect people protesting, they're trying earn living walk beach. tried run today mask. swear god thought going pass out. ended going home coming back trail near house empty.

Unless involves real cow. overly bright fairly incurious, them. Unless talking food TV shows, eyes kind glaze over. go hog-wild maskless walmart. Well Canada certainly moving 67 new cases recorded today. domestic economy rolling full steam ahead even peak cases... they're killing everyone either. listened science, needed do, stayed course. America full many anti-science snowflakes literally can't handle inconvenienced order save countrymen. current America could never rise challenge sacrifice like WWI WWII did. shameful. approach would constitute new approach. see last job December 2016......what past 4 years? Jesus Christ Two weeks ago steadily 18K. giving perspective looks someone outside US see complaining airline distancing seem think still need flying.

A mask helpful also putting situations important - isolating engaged behaviour might infectious key controlling virus. times crisis, normal every country protect citizens first. like airplane, turbulence. first save **yourself** putting mask, helping **others**. 

It happens strongest economic country world, afford buy supply. Europeans Chinese rich are, would done thing. nothing ashamed about. Moscow, Idaho? Ive seen comrades her,e ever use dive-through.  guessing numbers? made up? Agreed.  logic goes ways. *Not* attributing Covid gives illusion less people suffering dying pandemic are, giving fuel conspiracy-hoaxers nothing worry about. 

PS original reply got removed used word “Covediot” i. really Ediots. quarantine mean possible people house, go works 1st necessity primordial ones, like health, food, etc; reduce mobility can.

Oh mindset? People south see news (well news) go masks such? thing

Anyways, thanks info! sister indoor volleyball tournament Phoenix Saturday. there's that. Well got shit stain politics. länder want kids 2 years 6 years up. Maybe could strike sort deal ""herd immunity music fest"" folks. Built control group antivaxers invariably attending too. Sorry dude hearing synthetic (or real plasma) antibody treatments ETA available ? thought going intermediary step vaccine approved less rigorous trial requirements approval. maybe realize lucky been. good it. earlier protests haircuts people way bad depressed lonely months. Well create model exponential growth factored in. 

Like said purely current figures right now. 

Nobody knows exponential growth be. Professionals can’t even figure out. It’s total unknown. magic 8 ball would accurate predicting numbers point. 15th time took current facts right now. Jeez.. Reports lung scarring [3, 4, 5], kidney issues [6, 7, 8], heart damage [9, 10, 11], neurological disturbances [12, 13, 14] serious, ongoing health complications-across ages including without underlying health issues-are described increasing incidence. become clear demographic immune. We’re susceptible possibility several months (or years) rehabilitation, decreased functioning, chronic medication, monitoring. Skim [15], [16], [17] you’re unnerved yet. mentioned passing along title comment. Maryland 50% restaurant capacity bad enough. 100 percent feels like major mistake. hit 100,000 daily so.... like taxi cab. 

what kind barrier would suggest fit wide variety cars used uber drivers? Wow that's like total amount cases country since outbreak started late February. Roll COVID. Instead locking 100% onset. stil ain’t normal , live Belgium , roughly 45 new infected Winning! agree goes “both ways?” internet social media prevalent area people find groups think way themselves, amplifying ideas emotions. Consider demographics internet social media think it’s logical draw conclusions groups affected echo chambers others guess get money back one day lol Yep, Anti Mask league returned. research seems indicate dodnt all. US Dr.’s note though. Can’t get people back work stay home kids. Two weeks meme point That's true. That's also dickwaving stats pointless incredibly destructive, every country toolset measure data like say. sexual assault -- countries liberal definitions (like Sweden), others don't, much apples oranges compare them.

Yet entire sub subsumed self-loathing propaganda comes stats. probably banned moderators, god knows much pressure keep pig sty clean. sure Murica though.

*nobody* sure Murica point. lol  next step expanding use method involves securing corporate funding.

Why everything gotta corporate private funded? pay ass taxes federal money (the largest part paycheck tax) nothing us? cant feds say ""alright, lets use money this""? lol  Probably easier going divorce lol mom school bus driver I’m worried dad. Science empathy. India Bangladesh probably can't afford tests.

That said, India's 9% test positive rate still fairly low compared countries there.  Ooooh juicy, thought $2k don’t $2k per day much better Since when? That's true all. There's 5x many tests per day couple ago. ER went 7 day turn around couple months ago near unlimited 30 min tests. We're testing away people before. Every conveniently ignores massive elephant room. californias got alotta people dont wear mask literally cant breath. 5 mins, get nauseous light headed. dont wanna see happens 10. Guess 100 less guests funeral... still probably 5000 strong turn though amazing one piece facial hair destroys look.  Translation: believe reports China that's negative Korea's recent outbreaks nowhere near scale March, crushed. Korea dance stage virus. Significant mitigation measures, clusters keep popping up, nothing near scale initial outbreak. indication they'll overrun like everyone else. There's indication they'll anything even match initial outbreak. sure: Remind 6 months.  careful. might *be* available jobs point future. going devastating innocent children start dying weakened immune systems. fair, last Wednesday number deaths March. think aware local get tidbits information.

The good news point view gossip official reports pretty much corroborate vastly different, least comes coronaviruses.

For example, heard grapevine confirmed case one commercial complexes (CapitaMall Grand Canyon), hours later got information official information sources, also reported entire commercial complex shut people involved tested nucleic acids environmentally sterilized. begin gain complex technically evolving slowly billions years. Nah, first health bar... still round one. Sauce? going something Mr. President keep ignoring deaths skyrocket well? going herd immunity AKA fuck old people strategy? day feels like dystopian sci-fi novel. Jesus loves you. wants understand exponential growth. Yeah, like refuse jobs unless pretend notice often murder people. Roll out. It’s safe. Fuck it. Inject everyone. worldwide clinical trial. LOL, record Florida fired data scientist fake numbers. America lies like crazy. Hmm.. Covid, I'd taken grand catch ""normal cold"", sure.

But understand Covid point? $10m. least double that. Bride hit jackpot lol. Got assets day even need file divorce fireworks cancelled doesn’t mean everybody know won’t kind party/BBQ celebrate day.  lived lot different countries... nah, might countries dumb US, it’s almost like Americans seek opportunities showcase stupidity ways set apart nations. Reddit generally even know life China gone *completely* back normal. There's still quarantine incoming travellers, vast majority citizens back every day life like before, exception masks temperature checks everywhere. 

Reddit also thinks China lying somehow absolves US total incompetence. quite obvious lied numbers, absolutely undeniable virus control China. billion people going back work, shopping, taking leisure trips, going restaurants etc etc. Even CCP would able hide hundreds thousands deaths would occurred things control. Impeach Trump.  Protesting middle pandemic? Nah isn’t cause wont fans stadiums. games think still maybe. 65,000 apalling enough dumbass? Damn, dude. I'm pretty sure it. But, never even knew thing.

How often 'get stuck open' qualify? intentional. cant believe many people dont understand concept spreading germ via cough sneeze. intentional. Corona virus: 1 
Humans: 0 Yes, can't consider tests per million, also need consider positive test rate. country 1,000 tests per million, 10 turning positive results, can't really say needed testing.

The United States leading tests, also fairly high positive rate. Stores like nobody wears masks like walking death chamber. even joking. everybody wears masks places benign, sick people walk without masks day every day air filtered properly (it probably isn't) easy place get sick...

Crazy nobody wearing masks seeing waht happened NYC...  bot wrong, include g option end. Probably lol. Idk, people said thing protests weeks ago they’ve basically said didn’t seem impact cases Yeah dropped ball sure. I’m getting ready live fact death natural part life pandemics part nature. Coping tough sometimes  stupidity, abject poverty, high population density illiteracy. Stupidity also present amongst population, reaches poor, skyrocket number. people think told anything, even save lives wrong.

Do people refuse keep speed limits wonder..? Unexpected Catan! Death RATE* hospitalization RATE still dropping though

Either people getting help sooner, virus mutated less deadly, doctors know better treat disease, masks/distancing reducing viral doses creating less severe outcomes.

*Gross numbers still high concerning. ""Importantly, SARS-CoV-2-specific cells detectable antibody-seronegative family members individuals history asymptomatic mild COVID-19. ""

So least people antibodies still partial immunity. know many though, seem full immunity Yep, right. completely misread comment, came away entirely different idea actually said.

My bad. juts wanna point I'm sure part worldometers correctly updated right all. example France updated since months. stuck there. take worldometers sources numbers. would suggest masks then? Researchers think different antibody tests good idea, haziness Legit question, death rate getting better worse? India 12 times population density US. really think makes sense compare two countries? Oh, cool. Hopefully EU bans Americans permanently. Death rate lagging indicator though. higher rates infections may lead higher rates death later. I'm starting wonder whether time jump ship nom nom nom nom nom easy comparison. country high population density states. Areas less dense, like live, badly affected deaths hospital weeks.

We also seemingly measuring death differently much people hate Boris seems pretty transparent following scientific advice. 

Naturally there's fuck ups. big one lack protection care homes account half deaths. also enough testing capacity day one. probably locked week earlier, needs analysis over.

However, there's also positives. furlough scheme impressive we've ramped testing massively. lots fear around hospital capacity (buildings converted quickly), ventilators (new ones acquired) PPE (a issue, global one never horror stories) solved.

Honestly, horrific numbers horror stories countries. back expected precovid death levels. used comparison show views inconsistent, say wearing facemask bad slavery. logic 101. Extreme examples used show inconsistentcy. ??? media ignoring this? checked BBC, CNN, MSNBC, Bloomberg, NPR, NY Times local news website every single one COVID articles within top 3 stories. Even Fox News story bit page. It’s literally anyone talking months, saying it’s front page news? are, I'd argue toddler experiencing it. alive it, lacks capacity understand, probably even remember it.

Her biggest worry sneaking icecream freezer watching Peppa Pig. Tbf Britain americs europe Total past 3 days Gotta pump numbers up. Those rookie numbers in racket.   mad joke want get tetsted statistically tested died covid often hose tested. see take things seriously. Everything said fallacious contains real argument.

LOL... projecting. Antibody tests horribly inaccurate. today story FDA advising ""immediate"" antibody tests wrong 40% time something. Hmmm two weeks? Isn’t 3% cases? read average onset symptoms 5 days. Twitter pretty progressive liberal compared Facebook IMO Yeah time 1940s Americans entered Europe exactly welcomed there. open. close. Like want pretend ""Look, tried.""
How about, literally teach science let's use science support important decisions. record - subpoenas force someone talk, force appear. Remaining silent totally fine. breathing front client kissing taboo sex without condom. fake news know ! Deep state !! ChinaFlu hoax! think bars theory plausible, given [half cases Florida don’t know got it, Texas [only reaching 1 5 contract tracing, I’m sure say anything definitive it’s coming from. fucking country deal people.

Nah. America alone. countries sort problems.

In 2019, Samoa lost 39 lives measles outbreak following anti-vaccination campaign.

In Afghanistan, Taliban actively resisted campaign immunize children Polio.

So, America good company countries science yet well-accepted among population, extremist religious views prevalent. nowadays masks hard make many excess machine left china (some people even bid machine cz profitable selling masks now) experience child says much larger portion become uh...totally loveable... disease vectors.

Good time 16 guess Expressing frustration criminal negligence might help, actually makes angry. you’re probably right. Thanks. :)  many Americans dumb, arrogant beyond belief proud fact disobey logic. reason deny facts means 'freedom' makes 'greatest world'.

Humility, compassion caring others never values admired country - loud, strong/independent aka listen anyone, selfishness arrogance.

No country attitude. Soooo.. happened announcement? Whoa slow ... contest. they’ve fed disinformation nonsense ruling class, encourage proles get angry public health officials preventing working, rather angry system that‘s providing material support it’s unsafe work. compared protest zones non protest zones compared state case data. little confused asking read it, yet say bullshit. start pandemic, many like ""so grandma grandpa prone then. Ok mask me, time party"". tables turned. Idk maybe like didnt protest. talking sjw wanna libertarians. Hasnt guy proved liar? big factor spike last week (a) Nono. need outside help. likes shares curing citizens. Nice try mr./ms. Knowitall right stick dick blender too, mean should. people literally able helped. rookie numbers shit!! We've known fucking centuries. 

&amp;#x200B;

Too little, late. everywhere already. shown even people asthma terrible issues wearing masks. uncomfortable reason. America fucked every single thing far atleast one thing right? last week, needed provide full contact information able dine restaurant sit drink WA. 2 active cases time.

Now that's relaxed, bizarre one measures makes everyone feel confident things handled somewhat responsibly. boggles mind ""health threatre"" minimum, given much TSA etc burdens domestic flights already. infectious disease though? ""welcome home"" read article number live animals fish butchered there? It’s meat processing. put 2 week reminders people saying that. even gotten reminder yet... still time get worse. :/ True, they'd vulnerable deadly mutation, \*if\* one happened.

It's also possible they'd less able implement social distancing different time year, meaning could time peak R0 higher due different behaviours, meaning people get infected overall.

So quite one-way bet, close one. progress... US? Sounds good me. Hunting regulations similar reasons, maintain balance within ecosystem, leads quality meat healthy wilderness. 

I lucky live place local small farm raised meat readily available, quality incredible. better. y’all think caused surge? Let's keep way! time release anakin slaughter youngins. Yeah mom authors state: 

"" used detailed phylogenetic analysis, ancestral sequence reconstruction, molecular dynamics simulations examine Spike-RBD’s functional evolution, **finding surprise** likely possessed high affinity human cell targets since least 2013. ""

This quirky way say: ""we found this, make sense"". means relevant fiding article SCV2 evolved since 2013. obviously (we would definitely, definitely, noticed it, especially Asia, extremely aware cautious Sars-like coronaviruses).

The news finding make sense, not. authors know this. tell really think virus. many articles misspelling 'protesting' 'partying'?  apparently happened second bump Iran. Young people bump positive test results, ~6 weeks later deaths older vulnerable populations started rising, younger cases started filtering groups. Yeah basically sums up. America done for. mother.  Netherlands supposed keep distance inside/outside couple people. rule thumb keep 1,5m distance, lot discussion whether actually something not. sources help understand helps not,and why? Advice: I'd waste time trying argue literal brickheads Anyone half brain knew beginning masks offer degree protection makes sense. masks protect medical professionals course protect everyone - evidence right there. mask use negatively impact health medical professionals (e.g. Oxygen saturation levels), neither affect Karen Ken.


I watched US video people arguing mask use city meeting whatever (I wear mask reason wear knickers; God's breathing system). fucks sake, procession stupid was. felt sorry embarrassed them. Disgusted people ignorant would given public platform express views instead educated. Free speech one thing facilitating spread magical thinking could serious negative impact. ""Herd immunity"" would good strategy vaccine. Allowing population get sick sake economy inhumane. Especially thousands die survive end long term health issues.

What nation akin WW1 generals sending troops top straight machine gun fire. Sure - may eventually get side - cost? Yeah diplomat willing bend quarantine rules likely social distance maybe even wear masks. 13,000 possible people Covid, number could easily cause another wave China ruin progress they've made morons understand dealing exponential growth. understate positive test results deaths factor exponential growth still catch eventually. delaying inevitable making mess bigger. delay short helping way either. Wait getting health insurance $400 month? Please tell Fuck GM. Seriously, asshole. Definitely less painful grammar. ""I love 'em. Always have. best masks. They're great let tell you."" wrong event, wrong move, wrong time, wrong people.

that's fucked US currently. wonder data age-adjusted. Basically big number undiagnosed people nothing new. Wuhan around 3% antibodies. German RKI guesses non-diagnosed cases around 4 8-fold official number. percent need hospital still enough overwhelm HCS spread mitigated. Watching outside Americans collectively acted children past couple decades. typical country reacts things seems getting worse time. Close eyes pretend doesn’t affect you’re America. house can't catch fire already burned down, either.

I house. America. world's shit hole country. First cases go almost 0, everything opened, people become completely carefree comes second wave. Plasma donation centers paying higher rates quarantines. 400-500/mo first time donors. Something consider. Dude see 500,000 dead end sight one organization whose job address issue complete failure, don’t know tell you.

If organization trying effective rather playing politics, many things could done.

Any business run way would demand accountability management shakeup. get away it’s bloated organization trying protect existence rather job.  Ok, let's Sweden's fatalities going down. 

But that's whole story. Even though people seem prefer keep that.

2. Sweden's fatalities barely got Denmark's peak level.

3. Sweden's downward trend seems slowing down.

4. Meanwhile, Switzerland Denmark bought fatalities two orders magnitude. Italy, excess deaths taken account. That’s good point Dr OsiyoMotherFuckers lots places people far apart.

""...where people stay long distance"", even! Kia Ora cuz 😀 See cases Florida?

Florida potential eclipse New York. rip apart bullshit right here, much disinformation even funny.

There DIY instructions homemade masks/face shields clear back March, possible make mask fucking cotton T-shirt. 

Observe behavior countries around China initial cases came January. countries immediately went hands deck, immediately top it, immediately masked up. Japan practicing mask wearing since Spanish flu, pretty much muscle memory then. 

I guarantee clothing section store would focused first make mask cotton shirts. might looked stupid first, would soldiered brought virus heel got access masks. 

If Fauci said make homemade masks instead, bet people would stocking shit could JoAnn's Michael's get material could masks. Hell, there'd huge market cotton masks there.  im glad see u give credit ninja turtles song Someone explain concept test positivity rate probably previously fine because, hey, send Houston. effort govt people actually address situation. Instead denial, lies boasting. Shameful.

This showing signs improving. wdym ""ran tests"", testing capacity overwhelmed already? Right, opposed mortality. sure joke is.  Meanwhile Germany: +500 cases per day nationwide lol Texas go blue thanks Trump’s supporters following mask policy trump administration project 82000 august (back april) data model got type wrong; daily new cases instead total deaths. Looks like USA right target meet that. Ahhh Africa USA. NUMBER 1 everything. saw Love 90s group tour local fair years ago...he awful. 

Salt n Peppa hand lit. research bullshit, actually test anyone covid?? Restaurants really need team share spaces. assume lot equipment could easily shared. 

I kinda think opening central take hub (kind like take out/delivery food court) would work well. Cram bunch kitchens one non descript building.. delivery people able deliver multiple restaurants one route. Whilst true, think Trump's reactions lit fire people. said [do many would done. gave hill fight on.  Oral herpes cases county hit time low US, shit UK Brexit. Anyone ounce credibility came report said leaving EU bad idea accused part '[Project quickly dismissed. even senior politician say '[people enough heard kill young people(often). Add feeling indestructibility youth famous bound problem. hotel 10 mins away home room service pool. one day thing. That's called staycation cause that's felt like... Pretty dumb understatement year Could mean that:

Treatment getting better

Weakening strain

Have reached tipping point yet.

Guess find soon enough pizza overpriced? Woo!!! USA #1 USA #1 USA #1 MERICA!!!! many americans responsible university rankings though? friend mine said harvard medical school run asian students / scienticts. disgusted he, CDC &amp; ""top"" sources said masks necessity. clearly attributed anti-maskers fueled needless divide. Outright saying public walking face coverings global pandemic criminal. 'm glad acknowledges fuck now, come on.... get lied ENOUGH know who.

How anyone wonders go point nobody knows believe anymore beyond me. non believers ( ones stilling going out) ones needed &amp; news outlet step confirm still credibility. rest us masks &amp; lock downs back Feb. 

Watching whole ordeal unfold day day mind blowing. Good.

Everyone needs quit working. One massive general strike demand better protections pandemic. fact four months UBI, rent freezes, hazard pay, mandatory (read: enforced) mask wearing insane.

The government capable this. let anyone tell otherwise. Weirdest part they're starting human trials vaccines month. think meant mindful virus general sell seeds stinging nettles... buy those. grow like weed really hard get rid them, least Germany. people talk early receive proceeds fines rest.

You want pay people breaking law?  Also area, went past bar day one including servers wearing mask absolutely packed.  No, don't. Try stacking better Last Week Tonight episodes. known powerful enough convert people. 15.000 swedish residents usually commute Copenhagen work every day. never barred entering.  


Since may list exceptions long includes kind work related travel including applying jobs, people study Dk, people want medical treatment, going funerals etc. people close family Dk people property Dk. 

&amp;#x200B;

Claiming intermingling Danish side complete distortion reality.  


I know blame repeated Swedish media swedish politicians over. doesn’t however make true. wonder big part caught protest? It’s minority. good percentage state idiots. agreed. must retaliate. fuck 7th fleet doing? sail straight east coast China bomb shit country. Who.int pizza speak you, good friend. main concern death numbers UNDERREPORTED. Although, admittedly, death rate lags...the current numbers deaths doesnt make sense. likely 200,000+ tomorrow. Ooh, true, read tests 20% false neg rate. Maybe 20 good evading positive test fewer escaped actual virus. Well paul rate.

More significantly im pretty sure passages books Moses sick people housed edge camp people stay away got better. 1 don’t think virus even trigger sneezing proactive defense mechanism.  never said infects old people. Source? looked said 1-14 various reasons happening, one included. choose include others? perhaps, may biased certain reason? “Covid infectious all” good place start. ? tests findings. tests = also false positives. 
It’s positive numbers. It’s hospitals able cope intensive care. I'm sorry, speak pizza. people still protesting without caring human lives? needs evidence scare people? guys canceling fireworks? good news coronavirus needs short distances time propagate, since concert 3 minutes 42 seconds performs one hit, virus might much damage. said people, slow testing. Well...once start throwing around scary word triage - know (you, me, friends, family) screwed. Fact. muh freedumbs! Wow great see 3rd point ..while understand possible virus weakening knew heard something along lines can't figure head weakens ...definitely complaining weakening...great post btw one thing said misinformation? gave CDC's chart told personal experience.  lied, Korean expert Korea said ""N95 best, N94 good too, cloth mask...well thats better nothing all""

And cloth masks common Korea. older greater risk. 

Newborns like safest age group right now.  favorite argument brother gave ""when someone farts, smelling underwear pants? Poop particles! much larger virus. obviously wearing mask dumb bc gonna go it""

I know enough topic argue, I'm least smart enough know much, know college definitely get pink eye someone farts face pants on, absolutely bare ass naked. masks may 100% certainty, definitely actually helps ""Depraved indifference human life"".

Look up. want achieve herd immunity young people getting virus help get us there. 99.999% recover. 

I bet able get asymptomatic data blm protesters Los Angeles would charts. use LA example massive protests Hollywood Blvd saw people travel throughout LA county attend. That’s thousands people carpooling cars taking public transit. That’s recipe super spreading event. covid 19 death toll seems accurate.  Facebook vile website ran sick person Pfizer already announced price line vaccines. north may avoiding spike right it’s cooler, states region enforced mask policies stay home orders/recommendations months.  everyone (US)rushing buy guns... know understand... Ah worst President hand, pandemic UK nearly over, starting (again) US Yeah we’re essentially back peaked before, we’re back square one essentially, rest first world getting back action. 

And people STILL support trump. Stuff like makes misanthropic I've fear. kind detachment logic compassion factor aging? really risk getting mindset get older? something unique current older generations? Maybe grew time lead common water gas, affected brain development crucial ways something. dunno, really concerning could age. Yeah. agree. thinking MLB shortened season you’re right nature sport football much different MLB even sports. Hell even hockey spread except brief moments checking around net. ask : Would Dog Bounty Hunter tattered shreds respect turned dust sure   probably safer hospital anywhere outside tbh. Hospitals screen require everyone wear mask. contract tracing staff instructed ask protests. Yes? realize competition?  Chur again. Keep mind message came day, Wuhan MHC's announcement situation saying basically info contained email. Basically email equivalent asking ""hey gais, watching news?"" also apply bacon???

&amp;#x200B;

🥓🥓🥓 praise bacon 🥓🥓🥓 Yeah don’t get wrong, I’m hoping find way pull off. miss sports much football favorite, see lot challenges make difficult so. Here’s hoping figure Nope. stay home. people like avoid topic, wonder think noticed? Tell folks Yakima. They’re gonna fill hospitals Seattle. New Zealand's Health Minister resigned failures. 

Any new administration sack Fauci immediately replace him. Scared open Qld boarder read this... man it’s great Aussie right now. Sorry good people. Caught America mess Well...

If kill hosts harder spread. Also make hosts show serious symptoms also make harder spread since non-brain dead hosts start take measures spread. 

Evolution also works virus many generations short time frame. means actually adjust conditions time strains dont force host bed/hospitial actually slight benefit strains.

 
An example mimikri... even work ""blind"" animal cant see camboflage - depends amount animals get eaten vs eaten predetor Chinese woman gets coronavirus: cries shame social distance.

Karens USA get coronavirus: fuck I'm wearing mask \*coughs you\* scene NBA doctors run onto court cancel entire season big part inevitable movie. Exactly. Scariest thought world Trump/Musk ticket. would never happen Trump settle VP. Anyone else feel like coronavirus basically last 40 years climate change discourse occuring 6 months? Austin limits tests people symptoms tests, hence regularly 30%+ positive Sorry predicament, know research studies Japan found forest bathing (simply hikes forest, sounds like life right too) helped improve immune function. Welsh privileges revoked. Got it. mean important ever since chances getting infected higher asympomatic people walking around. top that, resources starting get strained certain locations. dont want sick hospital right now. Chinese woman gets coronavirus: cries shame social distance.

Karens USA get coronavirus: fuck I'm wearing mask \*coughs you\* US reported cases 2 days China, country 4x population, reported 6 months. Smaller class sizes means teachers. find additional teachers middle national teacher shortage pandemic. 

They’re going end class sizes large unlicensed adults taking role teacher. I'm worried experiencing pressure chest although feel like outside chest. also started using minoxidil apparently also cause chest pain. know virus. Last week, went meet friend pretty much exposed risk exposure public around 5 hours. opened economy force us back work

There really much choice considering federal government's lack response. Staying closed means people businesses going bankrupt. States neither funds power provide long term economic stimulus residents business sectors faced choice: reopen people get sick money starts moving again, stay closed many people get sick people businesses go broke. 

The feds forced states predicament, save ones never cared first place. feds refused provide meaningful long term financial support every person business. feds laughably unprepared something been.

If live stupid state, blame federal government abandoning responsibility. True even China hid 95% deaths would still less deaths US Well least agencies trying best, e.g. yet make vaccine Coronavirus

Vaccines types coronavirus infect certain non-human species exist. think safe say missed point. Entirely. Fantastic question. cases grow hoping postponed later. needed distract people latest horrible thing got caught doing. fair points. several YouTube videos celebrity media doctors making absurdly wrong early statements predictions covid. Pick wrongheaded media doctor probably find video putting foot mouth. Yeah, comorbidity rate Texas frightening. third state obese. third state hypertensive. tenth state diabetic. 

Combine fact past decade enormous number rural Texas hospitals closed, people every little Texas town driven nearest big city shop, recipe disaster. 

There mountain bodies through. made worse lot ill-advised behavior July 4th weekend. 

A tragedy playing real time, Texas big part next act.  company work claimed essential saying since supply essential businesses like target walmart means must essential, produce yard furniture. act like hero. bad feel 5 people expendable.They probably mind shoes see works abused. know long-term means I'm glad got him. People seem think funny not. hesitated replying think wont change mind this, goes.

No one anything gain asking everyone wear mask. popular case, however nature science. 

If go water three minutes must wear breathing apparatus. choice. 

If jump airplane must wear parachute, choice.

Nature kill dont.

Now, going crowd without mask might affect right away eventually. Nature infect you, infect others many die.

Its nature science one explaine away, demand away, ignore away. 50 k cases one day? Fuck, Ireland worried 11 new cases...... authority imply always right. Experts make mistakes. surprised many studies end revised retracted. Relying gut feeling ""half brain"" ""questioning logic"" mean infallible either.

The trouble know who's statements matches facts observations who's statements unless spend time effort find applying empiric research scientific methods. Neither experts glass orb skips able acquire future knowledge today.

Here's crucial difference sub academic world: latter literally training, funding, time mission apply methods directly situation hand. sub tries makes sense world intermediate reporting is, best, second third hand information.

Having ""half brain"" mean much capacity - things experts - verify statements methods. 

All end relying hindsight bias. ""See, right along"". course were, evaluating past based know today. even knowledge may still lacking ways even begun consider. intents purposes, odds might stacked experts right initially.

Does mean blindly follow whoever claims authority? course not. due sense awareness little know biases would go great way either.

Saying ""Experts say x. know that's true, neither know fact I'm right. leaves gut feeling I'm gonna go y."" perfectly valid well. package somehow knew better experts. didn't. lucky reality aligned gut feeling. Fastest solve I’ve read today... *so far*. stuck increasing rapidly: What? *presentation* science absolutely political bias. makes difference. 

Meanwhile study probe one thing study B prove opposite (with studies mentioning “caveats” small section end one reads, especially headlines) suggests science foregone truth seem believe is. laws physical. mostly field studies finite subjects, prove hypothesis. Often studies based 15 20 patients, place. come accept acceptable practice. cheers! Nope, that's outdated stat. Burger Bob go hide blanket 2015 mean. know know. Surely pun intended right?!?! 🎶*you wanna see, people who's denial same, wanna people think covid's lame*🎶 Futurama reference Hey loud people FAVOUR face masks?

They get dozen lunatics normal people keep quiet... council going think lose jobs make mandatory mask order. happened, changed tune? C'mon buddy. Tests per million useless metric order increase it, would start testing entire country. even need it. Coronavirus bad 2-3 states. rest states till control. much better indicator positivity rate. 

If wanted get tests per capita per million number US(which would involve testing need it), would need somewhere around 122 million tests impossible. seems tha staff killed him? Honestly Hamburglar smarter Donald. part city live in? Virtually everyone wears one I’m at. india goes lockdown like privileged countries poverty wipe population covid. counting pneumonia heart attack stroke covid deaths. may may caused virus. data scientist look trends give better idea total will, experts accounts, much higher is. Thoughts prayers translated 

I’ll thinking I’ll hope something done 

Science facts isn’t always best approach things, look eugenics retiree boomers care themselves. Oh. Thanks native speaker. article didn’t say anything Florida reducing testing. getting from? way. opened shit happened? Impossible. better drink backyard friends? bar. Please. particles question can't get out, obviously similar particles can't get in.

Kinda. Cloth masks aren’t much filtering sense mean it. Unless you’ve got well fitting mask, it’s like baffle. air goes corners. COVID fluid droplets, breathe out, it’s directly cloth gets trapped, even flow hits mask diverted outward. breathe in, get less protection, filtering. issue isn’t material per se, fit. Put simply, protects others lot protects some. need line today's deaths number new cases 14 days before. NEW CASES!!!!!! BS? know around 37 friends 11 states work healthcare. They’re absolutely marking cause Covid. 

Get grip move merely name calling MO. live Pittsburgh honestly I’m seeing OP talking about. Masking pretty much universal anywhere I’ve gone city. It’s surrounding counties people idiots. Prob gonna get downvoted, least dumb racist people die stop infecting gene pool Except rate infection Czechia low, thanks quite drastic measures early time now. possible ease combination targeted contact tracing isolation. cringe level highest order! European flair.Turkey part Europe. See worry most. wife back work parents mine. made clear early anyone us gets infected going play blame game shame them. 

Of course think hoax state/employers done everything possible follow guidelines. Unless reply with.. ah yes know problem.. 

.. yea better run.  That’s way psychology works. Right anti mask lunatics revolting fudged information. Meanwhile there’s surprisingly large part f population still wants stay home, equally stupid. false debate blanket reopening blanket closure hurting everyone. 

Report correct mortality rates. Report cautiously Covid fatalities (where people died Covid couple Covid symptoms four fatal diseases). Showcase masks work reducing viral load, eradicating virus would dumb. reduced viral load leads mild Covid best way build social immunity. Speak seroprevalence antibody tests showing us. don’t need fear this, fight off, don’t need stay closed everywhere hurting people bottom strata society big time, people rely weekly daily pay, need wear masks data shows help. 

This kind approach Germany Japan taken despite late game too. Japan nearly half population USA tiny island. Germany shown clear coherent sharing data help people perceive threat accurately. Then, instead revolting mass closures, want partake economy therefore participate sensible gestures masks. 

Right US caught battle draw it. Info shared clearly fascination “cases” liberal side fascination “this hoax “ uber-conservative side. 

Both equally stupid. He's afraid orange rub face. Ask son. anyone remember COVID still China, multiple AMAs Q&amp;As ""sub approved medical professionals"", saying masks useless nobody go buy masks. government's instructions so?

I remember one guy answered questions AMA Indian name (no disrespect Indian culture remembered). right thing, statistically speaking ok worst case scenario brother positive mother spreads family least best. Behind every tragedy family lot ""if only...""'. reason scared unless youre afraid truth. ask people ""recovered"" 4 months ago still completely fucked up. long ""recovery"" go? Unknown, far, stopped lot people. information reported, someone let get reported. People really understand governments work they. Peer pressure. laugh. need grow spine. disappear dead. Yes. Brits drink much bad teeth.  ok thankfully. 2 1/2 weeks back normal.

the cyto storm associated COVID, even mild symptomatic patients, causes life long injuries organs. suggest family full check up, need hospitalization something else.  glad well, friend

Keep awesome! Oh great, Jared's case. sure done bringing peace Middle East, cure COVID. yet people still go protest, don’t understand it. Bingo. someone could seen coming naw would called doomers ignored.

This poor man first many come. :( Probably not. Italy testing bad cases time. 6000 per day different Texas had. Also, treatment much better Feb March. said that, still looking like Texas going really rough 2 3 months. Italy NYC rough, rough nonetheless. maximum 24 cases per 100,000 population.

Last week, death rate mortalities five year average, despite 600 deaths covid death certificate. this, gather Covid actual cause deaths. 

So, many cases then. surprise absolute NOBODY lick sense. Children spread viruses bacteria like wildfire. small children know bring shit back kids regularly infect household. Man you’re stupid haha *Hippocratic You’re putting words mouth. That’s exactly asked stop spreading misinformation. Clearly separate opinion fact. wrong. head start Fucked. Sociopath. current rate, 9/11 every 2-3 days Original Source: says 153K test completed gets better statistics, However early 120K Results show 0.24% Positive believe PCR people also tested ELISA Antibody tests gave 0.84% positive. Last Week Positive rate PCR around 0,27% increased testing decreased 0.24%. also states herd immunity possible Antibody tests might reliable check immunity. Ah, herd raises head moo nonsense us again. repeat herd immunity requires staggering number people get infected large percentage staggering number end hallways floors, cars, parking lots, house dying hospitals 3 4 hundred percent capacity. end hospitalized, still really sick gonna absolutely kill economy cannot work months. So, please, stop herd immunity. work...unless vaccine. European here. WTF Lieutenant Governor? Sounds like job gatekeeper. That's one positive thing! misnomer. Saying cases tests true, means accurate data now. change facts.

All shows previously appreciation true state affairs ""Pretty dumb."" = Putting dick meat grinder stings little. Spain 45.000 deaths. Today I've talking two persons died hospital considered death COVID. (Area: Ciudad Real - worst place world together New York). states still staying open.  never said isnt real, one died New york wasnt badly hit lol. Using CDC's statistics, trust disease doctor all, show inconsistent misinterpreted entire thing is. dont see conspiracy see incompetence ways yes, used political gain wings. cant explain minnesota didnt see MASSIVE spike, cant explain states including Washington hit first hard 0 recovered reported. expect beleive everyone got washington still sick 3 months later? doctor, really one would know patient dies multiple causes death listed write tested positive covid put covid list counts covid death 
You also know really doctor, high lethality everyone, ita high lethality exact group flu is. Old people, immune deficient, preexisting lung conditions. Yes, thinking landmass. Admittedly best comparison case. someone turn ""Don't thread me"" spigot. anti-maskers killing people Yeah im terrible machinist, hold tolerances size red blood cell. I'll get better one day. screening positive rate among asymptomatic patients 10x higher among Hispanic patients overall rate. really interesting. I’m ICU nurse haven’t left house except go work grocery store week since late February. perspective almost us take seriously bozos crowd. aren’t ICU haven’t seen viral pneumonia actually someone close, including putting body bag long struggle. I’ll admit, I’ve worked real morons. One may exposed last week stupidity. I’ve let anger go pretend *everwhere* contaminated. don’t let anyone use stuff keep safety goggles head use. Well look honestly population popularity destination death rates would see probably handling covid better country . Imo what's really happening virus changed deadly 1st was. thing really blows mind look prison numbers .I 0 clue prisons get overrun cases almost average 0 deaths ( yes exaggeration insane low actual rate prisons) could possibly going prisons allowing inmates beat virus straight positive asymptomatic. 
Thank much well thougt well written response!!! mean landmass? would relevant?
Literally zero US states many people Germany. 
Californa largest state 39 Million inhabitants. Germany 83 Million people.  Melissa replied “What mean? he’s paralyzed brain injury doesn’t quality life?” asked. doctor replied “correct.” 

This happens triage rules. triage rules come state, local federal govt decide money important peoples lives. I'm karma awards appreciate appreciating post. 

Have good day, mate! handled badly part. good now.

America meme Depending many people willing sacrifice. Herd immunity means 180 Americans infected, happens slowly enough fatality kept 0.5% means 900,000 dead people, get sick once, closer 5% fatality (because one would able even get oxygen) looking 9 million dead people. shit different day. Virus care. There's options. others pointed out, lag time cases deaths, deaths may increase coming weeks. Additionally, initial increase US, much spread concentrated relatively small geographic area, meaning fewer hospitals deal cases. increase much distributed among states, meaning hospitals slower overwhelmed. I'm guessing really combination these. Wow, that’s insane. 25 total amount infections country That’s actually true inaccurately reported. happen know woman well number people attended party, know immediately notified guests. quickly fact able quarantine households exposed. Actually...he is....we didn’t covid-19, definitely coronavirus. Sure, that's true flu, mention, flu- much easier spread (especially know it) much deadlier high-risk groups, justify taking extra precautions.

The past months, coronavirus one leading causes death United States. healthy mindset want change that, especially nations around world shown can. obnoxiously-wealthy person country basically get live alternate reality. update update it. implying update we'll see ""looooooot"" excess mortality, set classic 2 WEEKS timer me. Virginia clearly run idiots. everyone start taking virus seriously pipe dream never open Maybe likes saying Worcestershire sure hell cannot say word save life. 

I bet practiced saying weeks. sounds 
cookoo mean? Last week worst week record. week Pace blow away.

I think might ""over"" covid see big deal anymore.

It's bigger deal ever, says statistics. Shave armpits call smooth Texas Arizona's ""lockdown"" lenient Ontario's stage 2 reopening.

Nah feel like SF obviously San fran lol I’m versed abbreviations New thing bad old thing good took days find blood donated antibodie.  think Austin, Texas city small operators run App Lyft Uber allowed. years ago id read researching potential Uber IPO. Drivers got keep much larger share too. Research: clue China's numbers accurate (and believe are), response much drastic US's. love right-wingers accuse China telling truth numbers wheel around also accuse China implementing drastic containment measures infringe people's rights. course harsher restrictions going lead lower numbers - even reported numbers fake, I'd still bet money China's real numbers still lower America's.

The fact even China's numbers 10x worse letting on, they'd still much better US... fact numbers would need **30x** worse reporting **on par** US's numbers... myth really annoys me, virus infection fatality rate 0.03% people 40 years, selective pressure evolve less contagious strain. pronounce it? LatinEX LATINex? Im thinking latter I've seen written. agree. going get lot uglier, fast. That's weird article though, I've seen cards never thought government agency. They're clearly informational cards, even claims wrong (which article even address) Reading like New Zealand? No... Russia? No... Idaho. Or, maybe fact gallivanting around bars maskless? I’m quite fine, quarantining. I’m bored want know look forward like maybe tasting food months. great user name even though patulous eustachians great irl. mean, dude scumbag along, I'm fine whoring around playing golf living like spoiled trust fund baby.  That's VASTLY preferable constant incompetent actively malevolent meddling.  remained entertainment figure.  mean, think aside stoking narcissism degree would like, would actually happier way. We’d probably need 70% population vaccinated, 100 million wouldn’t Fair point, last week particularly great week Arizona regarding deaths though. Iran, country second wave chaos March/April low #s tests data lags ended, showed 3 - 4 week lag cases ticking deaths ticking up, yeah we'll see, right, Arizona seeing higher numbers right around (if go Iran's example/charts). said, last week disaster, great either, let's see goes out. Gonna need put little Ice it. sympathies America. hope get handle soon.   9 moved hospice ONE day one nursing home lot. doubt follow. it’s millennials fault. it’s fault.














And don’t like that. wanna spoonfed government media guest. refuse listen lies. Musk's companies notoriously shitty places work

You base made bullshit internet. laugh think engineer, logically vapid. know entire state Pennsylvania defunding police. Til.  
Defunding, course, literally translating ""No law enforcement ever way, different branch write enforceable tickets carry fines breaking laws."" theres plenty, search anti mask league believe called little, late Florida. Full speed ahead trying throw bandaid debacle? children, boot? Worse Sweden. Thanks, guess get next big experiment (without consent). would hope sub would wear masks even then, yeah. chance moron sneezes purpose family something stupid. Nothing inherently people follow recommendations. doubt beaches people spacing enjoying outdoors, theres also beaches everyone partying bunching going purpose socializing, enjoy outdoors own. bars similar feel less ""essential"" still drink right without bar. ""allowed"" go beaches outdoors, go party, people abusing that. real reason people go bars people drink, even though bars great job trying follow guidelines, hard especially people drunk combative right now. whole point leadership place top bottom, instead supporting people bars cant work, turn give green light open back cohesive plan basically telling every business things, good luck enforcing sow discord misinformation. bars im mostly talking catch 22 workers pushed into. wrong beaches, would say thats good example leaving people hold accountable right going yield mixed results, unfortunately virus dont kind room error. Cases deaths.

Like south arrogant. laughed back April May ""haha we're fine!"" Well fine now. admit doomers right? school public space...? it?  20 passed 90 got bonus test Masks protect passing virus, contracting think mine paused reopening still decreasing cases, based fear dickheads Florida al coming north. That's honest sad truth.  administration shown us best hope lack interest issue hand, since active involvement part worsen situation.  miserable situation best hope leadership nothing....  end they’re clearly inaccurate either way accused fear mongering less two hours ago reporting number new confirmed cases coronavirus today, right sub.

Some people go great lengths mental gymnastics convince everything fine. Unfortunately live state people still taking seriously. 4th coming cases already rising, join Texas Florida 2 weeks live town 50/50 left righ PA. OMG, every post Facebook, local group, fight masks, even nothing masks. upside, number people masks exceeds oppose, man right leaning people dug in. blitz intended muddy waters covid reporting. correct answer explosive diarrhea. Ice cream, chest hair, tacos. sticky shit got hairy. coronavirus' 1990s

But steal Queen David Bowie, debut album back then. problem dont know long immunity may last yet. states fuck around actually contained virus door dining may allowed reopen. fact US still contained whilst developed countries appalling 9 nothing. nursing homes lost 30+% residents. likely cards nursing home. I'm sorry, yeah, that's rough. :( think she'll get though, maybe follow email? Try phrase feel, like much miss want safe, use lots ""I"" ""You"" - takes sting it. 

And hang there! kids chew theirs... countries make coronavirus testing free change? last thing want someone avoid taking test he/she cannot afford it. Remember Obama tried give people affordable healthcare, hot mess was. fucking stupid us Georgians apparently are, gives false sense hope creates (also false) impetus open. 

I read someone's complaint today doctor's office asking wear mask. nothing help others still complain. honestly understand it. fuck up, guarantee it. love this. Thank you, Mongolia. Seething mad hypochondriacs r/Coronavirus give life. genuinely funny shit come with. Right. mean PPE disaster first 2 months non-issue medical workers now. Canadian government announced practically independent PPE production countries stopped shipping PPE Canada we'd still fine supposedly, case \~4 months ago.

Where there's money made, may take months private sector get us quickly chasing dollars. give free masks. 

Hey, dear, mask?

No?

No worries. one!

Cost $1.... happy... I’m happy... there’s drama... pneumonia cases covid related counted total pneumonia deaths still counted covid deaths covid death toll? want clarify this. theoretically, pneumonia deaths examined/tested covid, right. Med examiner friend Chicago working like crazy analyzing cases covid deaths. agree that. would intersecting know effective penetrating cells would mean reproduces faster? achieved full idiocracy levels. club, social, athletic group college campus going prone level absurd binge drinking activities. Butt chugging may bit intense, rapid alcohol consumption long staple college life, Greek not. Nordic countries critical towards Sweden, Nordic countries also visiting Sweden one degree another. 

It's kinda like wanting cake eat too, hypocrisy intrigues greatly. Uber makes massive amount money, invest driverless tech paper report income taxes.

If wanted needed could pad pockets much wanted tomorrow. visited European countries, MyTaxi app called actual taxi. I’m assuming developed Uber started taking share customers Taxi industry adapted. got excited thinking maybe taxi game changed US (since years since actually booked taxi), dice ): Hopefully make something similar well! Remember freaking 100,000 cases total US? Remember assured would cases? Remember opinion kind mask liked wearing best? Remember Michelle showed arms? Remember Obama played golf? I’m pretty sure decimal typo. 50,000/328 million 0.015% 1 6600. says Wednesday, July 3rd flyer lmao That's week ending June 13th, cases went lot.. Well put way, even terrifying. See tomorrow headline RemindMe! 3 weeks mods still insist forum apolitical?  Mods need realize pandemic situation CONSTANTLY intersects politics major way. 

I know I've many posts removed, many others likewise, simply talking exact kind thing linked article talking about.  makes sense me. That's opinion.

It could also mean patient declaring premature victory virus dismissing it. I’m asking family live state travel TX pandemic. Yeah.. people assume China covering tons numbers talking ass. Either assume China MUST order virus gone pandemic (not case) like CCP. anti mask sentiment. repeating societal response Spanish flu. anti mask league thing philly massive parade wave 1. Yeah, 10% quoted WSJ scary. 1 taco enough superhero Sounds like virus tendrils Alex Mercer Prototype! saying reason curse solid. Evil witches think like non-evils. rate continues maybe two Nope, issued judge. issued local city attorney something something seasonal flu bad. Double double, animal style He's though. Needs take CTO role stick that. Leave ""accidental"" stock manipulation political bullshit bullshitters. Well can't really comment get pulled let say, good luck America.

Thoughts prayers. get fined. actually fuck. Fauci tv couple weeks ago saying infected people wear masks better wear one unless symptoms sick. Goddamit. he's ironically talking mixed messages need masks avoid another spike. fuck.    





Secondly. Everyone already knew shit beginning telling people masks useless.  It’s like massive amounts people gathered streets starting late May something people (righties) fail realize NEW virus haven’t experienced new research information, comes new protocol. think it’s flip-flop festival political reasons. They’re fucking dumb it’s best converse. family get tested unless symptoms. 

If helps any, that's us handled like April. They've recently opened Frontline workers, elderly, without symptoms.  murderers. Elon fan fuck off. small arms people point really dont know government stupid. don’t...they already identified partygoers..how identifying individuals may exposed deadly virus infringe rights?


I’ll answer you...it doesn't. legally able serve subpoenas. Freedom kill innocent peoples spreading shit? 

ALMOST countries freedom right know why? care LOT STUFF without worrying catch death put step outside.

That's freedom brainwashing (who mean nothing but...yeah.) break record. Look World look USA. 

""SO MUCH FREEDUM"" CDC's IFR estimates significantly higher still ridiculed many experts seeming unreasonably low. 

I'm expert also board months data seems show IFR well 1%, especially younger groups. could possibly IFR influenza sheer number death already have? working Donald? Pretty bad real people US. Elon Musk tremendous piece trash never innovated anything someone else lay groundwork first. genius, rich narcissist. Maybe. Instead saying things like ""young adults,"" could please write truth? Young AMERICANS. SK, Japan, Taiwan, New Zealand, Iceland, etc, young people proven care. strictly US thing, along Brazil. No, went one hostess per day last Friday reopen scaled back 50% capacity. live South Texas btw. local mask order apply restaurant patrons. Employees yes, however. know. Insane. double work. Also, I'm exactly sure stuff was. bottle said ""Germicidal Detergent"" tried read label told get back station. Basically, mixed water yeah that's it. saying. Typically matter thing time Mexican here, also people stupid least city 80% pople never stayed home, although lot business closed, folks continued lives continue gather party, know infected levels really high hospitals collapsed Mind naming one new delivery method know avoid? happened 03/07/2015? It’s basically US back April :/ ones getting sell 10 20 count deliver 2-5 days US. That's lot money medical bills future. Every hospital gold toilets. may ask, ""How go Vanilla Ice driving Bobcat?"" say, better question is, ""How go driving Bobcat Vanilla Ice *again*?"" mean asshole boss.. Nook

I owe Tom Nook many Bells. I'm seeing pattern here. driving factor dismissing virus either lack understanding works narcissistic lack concern others. bet vast majority would fall one two categories. may lead lower death rate initially, potential increase deaths line. Young people threatened disease known spreaders. younger demographic infected, higher infection rate, eventually leads increase infection older population. think need wait see there's shift.n still going magically disappear. still really believe huuglie. /s Didnt say gonna die. rate lot people could've preventable. survived doesnt mean everyone will. I'm healthy 23 year little risk, dont give two fucks myself. I'm worried parents family members gave greater risk. congrats antibodies got enraged heard Florida 1,600 contact tracers yesterday. hell doing. should’ve priority #2 testing. 

Our country horrible. I’ve never ashamed American. Never. Lyft already done live. varies lot. Chad age expectancy 59yrs, Brazil 71, Mexico 76, Afghanistan 52, Angola 61, India 61, Venezuela 71, etc 

So big gap life expectancy developing countries, low Ballveries steel. Arizona right next CA NV fuck quick tests widely used elsewhere highly accurate pretty cheap too. reconfirmation still carried out. brother rushed Italy consulate right Italy went quarantine Nova Scotia. 

Not test anything “Ya got it?” return trip. quarantine never allowed test. drive rental car, like refer “plague-wagon” back dealership exposed idiot boss driven entire eastern seaboard states. told quarantine never allowed test either. 

We’ve come long way since started. actually looked data? there's little correlation positive tests deaths point. look numbers sweden instance; deaths fallen precipitously new cases stayed constant. would surprising deaths US rose significantly. much given kills 1%. Though probably larger factor hospitalizations since patients community spreading much hospital setting. mah McFreedom. nice selection data. Total cases per million would paint different picture… asian, confirm.

paracetamol cures cancer. Could him? seems hard take anyone seriously genuinely suggesting IFR . 01%.

Why? Let's get  true. don’t enforce people Pittsburgh give shit. again, death curve decoupled cases curves ages ago. I'm arguing tick again, idea deaths going skyrocket basis numbers we've seeing. left-wing indoctrination public higher education real working. Bingo. likely 20 million infected states 200k March April pretty likely. yeah, U.S. better insane increase like seems. That's inductive reasoning. Sadly Mexico don’t assistance like country does. don’t work don’t eat. 1k deaths today, though. R/blackpeopletwitter posting like hell PA resident. Remember PA us two big cities lot banjo between. Philly might ok Pittsburgh already complying part rural full arms straight defying. Damn ... Darwin give up.

Why now, many hardest-bitten supporters finally so? quit caring first 100 deaths. We're far gone people, constant back forth caused Americans completely disregard use face masks using precautions. Deaths continue come droves, end summer we'll well quarter million dead, end year half million. Spring 2021, COVID killed people U.S. 12 month period Cancer 2019, making new leading cause death United States.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's put perspective second. virus even exist time last year, leading cause death United States less years time. misunderstanding data. live CT, striking distance see number cases CT (+58 yesterday) versus Arizona (+4682 yesterday). total number CT deaths less one days increase cases AZ. (I know AZ 2x population CT, even still, amount new cases CT 0.000016% population versus 0.0067% AZ's population).

I wear mask 8+ hours day, count fingers number people seen come place employment wearing mask, half end visibly feeling peer pressured leave (without anyone saying anything them). Many customers commended us cleaning distancing practices, point second nature employees. 

Lamont debating opening bars phase 3. Restaurants opened indoor seating 2 weeks ago. hate phrase ""new normal,"" true. Since majority adapted ""new normal,"" miles ahead states hopefully continues case. still posting? Bye! danger deadly contagious is. 

When couple million people get time. states passed mandatory mask wearing law?

I'm ignorant here. guess assumed places this. know live Washington, wearing mask punishable $1,000 fine. study say dying Covid19. Florida: Hold ventilator! That’s amazing! got recent tat back Dec know I’ll donating ASAP! Make sure remove tire iron first. That’s absolutely fair point original comment it’s high far prognosis - chosing *not* many tests possible real problem it’s self.

Got love astroturfing  Australian here.

Seeing side world makes utterly baffled. 1st world country fucking inept containing virus beyond point. country already highest amount cases world many states still people strolling care world. That’s something documented since Wuhan January. Patients ventilators seeming stable, “cytokine storm” event occurring huge battle (is?) treatment manage event coincided massive downturn health. Dumb, dumb, dumb, Dumb-dumb-dumb-dumb Articles like act lie US massive country. states particularly northeast ended first wave. paces getting first wave now. homogenous. sue living fuck government. got hit hard early paid price. active cases plummeted.

Ours rise. ample examples handle chosen ignore it... 10x population still trouble reading. 

Read cited literature. It’s summary layman’s terms wider audience understand. It’s pretty clear people stupid right now. many people going actually read manuscript? format article makes easier everyone understand. 

It’s difficult understand. I’m sure planning mounting stead different way. I'm CT well honestly shocked struggling. saw couple making AT&amp;T storefront (shocking own) crazy folks yelled dad wearing mask Lowe's. Can't imagine much worse would elsewhere  Ah ok, good point then! can't start sleeping virus it'll come back bite ass. right that.I think they'll get control though. article saw said transmission asymptomatics presymptomatics rare. one employee definitely messed up. guys death rates skyrocket week two? Shut every hospital? elsewhere news - 

The number daily Covid deaths fallen steadily last month currently lowest point since  Came say this. guy clearly knows talking about. Nobody, mean nobody, claim really honestly think masks don’t work. 

There STILL motherfuckers FB spewing 'masks work' bs along faulty studies, testimonies supposed doctors (one case turned butthurt oral cosmetic surgeon).

Hell lot better 85% accuracy tests got rushed market . 
28/29 29/30 test samples extremely good .  Thank People dont realize much really go. We're best 7-8% usa need 60-70% maybe achieve herd immunity. Let sink in. Sorry hear it. happy mom taking seriously. They're perfect degree. They'll look back fondly they're CEOs someone brings attention board intentionally spreading deadly pandemic students, they'll issue apologies resign disgrace morons. One slow burns... Skin cancer deaths US per year still pale comparison virus claimed already months (around 20,000 forms skin cancer vs 130,000 far COVID-19). Outside fast growing/spreading melanoma (which much rarer kills less people squamous cell carcinoma), could skin cancer right now, still wait year lockdown hiding coronavirus get treatment fine. 

The things want put would symptoms heart attack stroke, aka medical conditions occur rapidly things normally schedule appointment get looked at/treated like skin cancer.

Normally, people save 2-3 months weather hardships we're Month 4. many companies gone bankrupt point.

""They"" also said wear masks... also wearing masks makes look fatter orange. bars caused it, gotcha, makes perfect sense lol Again- cfr. cfr tell chances dying contract virus. ifr does. one saying ifr 5% anywhere near it.  month ago people gloating ""doomers"" pointing falling infection rates proof never serious... fair January everyone would already gotten would make sense worst I'll take pandemic authoritarian government thanks.   approach works lab. real life. 

Huh? already working real life. there's one thing Florida's known for, overwhelmingly young population. Remember types didnt listen younger something dangerous. turn fair play. Nah, that's he's ""open masks"" thinks they're ""good idea"".

His various handlers probably finally told alone no-mask island.

Edit: envy poor SOB job inform that. Extra income cities. saving grace we've yet see Trump draw crowd 300,00 yet.. seems highly unlikely many show up... No, seem missing point. percent positive rate biggest key indicator large orgs like CDC focus on, total number tests positive. trying alarmist sticking point CDC already said moot compared important focal statistic, percent positive. I'm getting it.  At, rate 20,000/day next Thursday. It’s sad see people need forced logical thing. WWE essential business florida btw shit, ongoing since January high gear since March well know. Cute response sidesteps stated facts though. One liners willful ignorance must bliss. George Carlin quote. try correct George - oh wait dead 12 years

And actually terms IQ average median going close same.  ""Most people (about 68 percent) IQ 85 115. small fraction people low IQ (below 70) high IQ (above 130).""

It's like public health officials known, warned, pandemic inevitable since 2003. plenty time put plans place.

In three days nobody fucking care park open. single person. kid dies, nobody suprised. Nobody care. Nothing happen.  Really hard sign away constitutional right. said. simply stating can't look number confirmed cases draw massice conclusions it. 

Rt takes testing population account. number confirmed cases that. It'll buy couple cases Busch Lite. Bussssssccccchhhhhh. comment relevant person replied said? Deaths hospitalized patients fallen, average hospitalized patient four times less likely die April (see link below), excellent news, potential downside hospitals overload, time around beds slower empty; March/April hospitalized patients died quickly, survive continue require care, means next patient cannot admitted. scenario pans out, going need massive patient transportation (which have), lose progress made improved treatments past months. Trump wears mask cameras aren’t there. know what's interesting? 

When look that, automatically think number decreasing, automatically think dates descending order, least did. 

But look closer ascending. I'm teacher behaving similarly. I'm nervous total catastrophe could going back school. I'm Michigan. we? 
I'm left I'd still wear mask pandemic even right-wing president told us so. Cos finally started saying maybe something mask phenomenon also suspect decent number people “mild” cases continue damage lungs parts body long time. insignificant.

I know ""decent number"" is. I've tried find info best tell, lung damage thing nearly common people making be, permanent. also really anything compare to-- flu-like diseases also cause lung damage we've never noticed x-ray every single flu patient? Read details. barely matter. get wrong, better nothing, good enough.

If God real someone want with, actions heart important whose church attended not. wish beholden fear. covid thing starting get serious. Allegheny big spike right people want flock damn casino. 🤦‍♀️ Lol beaches staying open fort Myers. picked wrong time come back Florida Czechia. Naples, Miami places closed beaches Fort Myers staying open It'll probably initially rolled higher risk groups. nurse working around COVID everyday hadnt caught then, likely much inclined vaccine general population.

Then we'll see there's horrible side effects groups, roll everyone else. Lmao! heat kill it. shit exacerbating Demographics. anti mask people Jacksonville Tampa. look two regions vote explanation. pray real USA knew stand ashes chaos. 🙏🇨🇦🇺🇸 US keeps schools closed, opens theme parks? nice priorities... watch movie? live Texas... Texas: ""We're reaching upwards 6000 cases per day""

Florida: *hold methpipe* half population United States dies this

By""this,"" mean SARS-CoV-2? get points, CFR nowhere near 50%, even pandemic, everyone catch it. death rate even lower account asymptomatic carriers.

Of course, nothing good comes this, good chance significant minority infected come long-term permanent complications. also surprised see death rate essentially close low double digits many unable access care need; however, coming bubonic-plague-like death rate. That's still least 250,000 new cases daily  Rock like COVID plague. anything hopefully they'll start boycotting facebook cos infringes rights Thanks, guess? wear mask. hard. boys. Freedumb intact. TBF man worn mask long time already. Balt County, myself. Yeah, we've ""done good."" going suck seeing numbers shoot right back up, I'm hopeful happen. neighboring states seem okay, able keep numbers down. Makes sense. get something positive though... clever people even bother looking effort immediately went let 'em burn. 3 months ago, holy shit get yelled saying here. Now? agreed upon. See, people change. get numbers manageable level? Lockdown get everybody buy wearing masks. Preferably mix both. Like everyone wearing masks keeping certain things closed  Mexico city awesome. drank tap water ok. street food.

Not good time go. Florida want bailout New York coronavirus issues. wonder FL ask bailout now. Help, I’m caught loop! Eh, yeah. guess depends specific office culture too. Yup works governor’s office. “leadership” Texas god damn appalling. another one Obama Derangement Syndrome. outbreaks daycares. think rent mortgage holidays would helped people pressured want reopen could focus chilling. almost like 'research' agenda.  responding directly comment... Classic Florida man response! I'll bet amount money care wager 900 beds nearly enough. They're going set makeshift hospitals started already they're idiots.

This happened before, like month ago New York. going go exactly way nothing changes. saw Italy New York there's excuse they're unprepared.  People fleeing Idaho precisely Blaine County massive spike cases early on. People fleeing places like Washington go vacation homes Sun Valley. Weeks ago states started reopening, concern rising number confined cases, seen. I'm Ohio pretty flat couple weeks reopening started seeing another surge. Florida also seen similar plateau got sudden surge again.

I hope deaths per day follow trend, I'm holding breath. Thought going pic Trump hugging. Taiwanese like most, quite proud distinction China. hilariously obvious fluff piece straight Taiwan brag it. It’s extremely likely Chinese government lied case amounts. Can’t trust anything say it. If! Mhmm lovely lifelong lung scaring intubated ventilator... Sign fuck Doc!  guy publicly flouting masks. He's public figure. People trust him.

Look, people right start taking seriously even survives, I'm surviving. high profile GOP figure one 120k counting people die something change? Fuck yes. Let happen.

Honestly, I'm thrilled got sick, one thing that's changed 85 year old dad's mind going huge 4th July party Arizona weekend. Herman hospital might saved dad's life. big change Lt. Gov. saying grandparents volunteer die. took long make Executive Order. get “good news” flair this? Needed done least trying hide outright.

...anymore. feel like won’t even hear stories? far honestly feel like actual human toll virus mostly ignored, coverage broad statistics response. worry mother wouldn’t feel bad got it. Rude, sure, play stupid games etc. Except stupid games could, usually do, terrible ramifications. 

As stuff comes covid lasting effect body, less understand people maintain ‘it’s flu’ rhetoric. That’s honestly scariest part it. don’t know long term effects virus vs know flues come go (so long you’re healthier) without leaving bedridden months. Could last months could last years someone rougher case might ever fully recover normal. deny protests cause spread.

I provided article says far, appear has, difficult tell yet.

Shocking can't admit wrong month ago claimed BS numbers control people like refuse take seriously.

But hey, support President, agree damning things like pandemic big deal BLM symbol hate.

Lol. numbers must really bad Wiser words never said. hell happening country?
This utter BS Saw idiots FB saying “illegals” caused spike AZ, guess us along. Yeah aroind time.

That's NM putting small numbers. They're one poorest states nation, reaction swift ubiquitous. everyone followed NMs lead, US would much better shape. us teach college classes REALLY WANT open back fall. I've family LA get tested without symptoms. actually thought governor telling people go get tested even without symptoms. It’s helpful stat also additional shifting unknown variables denominator.

People seem underestimate nerve wracking face deadly novel virus. going take us years learn about. Many people catch might immediately realize much virus damaged body, regardless whether ICU mild symptoms all. We're still learning things like HIV, SARS, MERS years/decades discovered, going take us long time learn ways SARS-CoV-2 works. told nurse local hospital 3rd July almost always busiest day year. work trucking company. warehouses several big cities across country. Miami warehouse really problems moving freight. State open people much business. Regardless Governor says people buying stuff. Cries Texas It’s insane! Cant 9-9-9 way Corona, Herman. without financial incentives reopen, American people large weren’t going comply strict stay home orders.

We know tons anecdotes actual traffic data.

Lots people done less 3 weeks.

So kind get commerce people like wait longer go end people ignoring lockdown anyway, go ahead get started opening back up...

The gov pushed lax lockdowns harder wouldn’t fly populace. even lax pushing lots people limits 3 short weeks.  wait till theres real hurricane. Yeah, yesterday's numbers. think OP misunderstood chart. usually mountain bike secluded areas...

outdoors near trees  Again, talking individuals becoming broken, humanity not. Western North Carolina fucking shit hole, I'm sorry That's summer camps vacation family for.  guy little melanin people would empathy. Black disabled, we'll see people defend starving dying man 6 days. Sociopaths.  yes, know. meant joke Fuck yeah, Florida, smash records!!!

Wait. stocks gonna blood bath soon mean, gathered Orlando yet. players tested positive quarantined continuing testing well. far get Orlando concerned, constrained bubble somewhat steep punishments leaving. think country disarray, definitely think restart is. opinion wearing mask? It’s deaths haven’t spiked. do, nobody gives fuck. Cool! love shattering records!

What also enjoy governments posting many unique new individuals tested total tests were. Also news new tests came public access open testing sites. 

It's pretty straight forward. could get tested approved, ok tests limited. tests open public everyone shows up, course number positives going up. like actual positive people lower, tests provide higher values now. important thing rate infection here, number.

Headlines stupid fuck baiting antibodies, cells well.

Actually, number cases (I've seen 40%, 30% 20% three published studies), depending infection severity, actually produce protective antibodies, seems 90%+ produce cells offer least degree protection amount time.

To answer OP's question, produce cells antibodies response initial infection; also create various 'helper' cells specific disease reexposure body mount rapid and, hopefully, effective response.

Think immune 'memory', immune memory marks difference primary (initial) secondary (subsequent) immune response. Yep. 
One graduated. 
One start college. 
One goes small chrisitan school - know going yet. said. pretty simple opinion...I look single elected official guidance keep family safe. going wear masks public, going avoid sitting inside restaurants, going anywhere crowd people right thing. suck, bet...we planned whole summer water parks, beach trips, couple visits Orlando. find insane anyone would expect elected official best interests mind. Part repercussions state tax budget come tourism dollars. State fucked either way. STILL WAY BETTER MURICA reopened far away initial NYC outbreak. guess virus CA WA experienced outset less contagious strain China, whereas reportedly 8x contagious strain Europe hit NYC spreading like wildfire. 

But also, Florida hit population equivalent 20K cases California, Arizona hit equivalent 24K yesterday things much worse places California. opposite. number higher spite reduced testing hate see it. Thanks FuzzyPine (I like too)

It day kicked addictions mine replaced good habits. Relapsed times I'm good place :) *surprised Pikachu face* mass testing site near runs tests 9am every day. still test symptoms.  Thanks, that’s good hear. fear it’s little late, provides glimmer hope fewer Arizonans might die unnecessarily. Yet people still want go bars beaches. Fucking idiots. Generally, people dying naturally shun food. starving. organs failing feeding actually make things worse. 26.00×10^13 going packed people wanted take advantage less people due virus scare. 

""Nobody goes anymore. crowded.""

Open hear opinions. that's good point, financially speaking, back benchers NBA *alot* better NFL counterparts, per year salary career longevity. 

NBA's minimum salary almost twice NFL's (900k vs 480k)

But yes, may come time teams face payroll issues - surprisingly large portion team's profit comes live attendance (depending market) reaffirm misinformation. History written yet, right?

We need speculate stopped publishing data. Here's CEO explaining right here: Houston Methodist CEO Dr. Marc Boom stressed new data reinvented — figures projection models — simply reformatted effort make clear reaching 100 percent capacity ICU moving target. TMC hospitals combined 373 beds, instance, become ICU beds “challenging” “doable” amount effort, Boom said, reassignment trained staff would take TMC facilities’ combined 93 percent ICU capacity Sunday report 72 percent, chart shows.

The latest estimates find put [31.2% ICU beds used COVID let's assume covid real threat ICU beds, instead [constant rate hospitals furloughing staff due economic bet extra staff would help right now.

And lastly, high hospital capacity normal. Look [hospital capacity past decades. [They're nearly call/calls can't really clarify felt way.

But know several mayors publicly pleased DeSantis. I'm sure put mind figure way hold title. fuck still fucking problem fucking July Hopy fuck you’re melodramatic. Trying compare kid play video games watch TV surviving holocaust. Get grip. asking i'm implying scientist lie, said study data science myself, confused feel (mildly) offended? Seriously dots there, try connect them.

It unethical scientist lie, also irresponsible imo speaking technical jarson average joe expect understand perfectly. ""there's evidence happening"" worded differently yet carry meaning includes ""we know"", ""more research needed"", ""we enough evidence draw conclusion yet"". mean there's reason government comes across like developing country dictatorship times.

It's many developing country dictatorships trained, armed, installed US... America fucked.. Thanks Trump know Sweden different approach case numbers steadily trending upward month daily deaths continue decrease. Might see something similar happen Sun Belt? Holy shit, checked sub guys rockers. I'm sure government give powers would gain us pandemic passes. UFC one two cases Covid fighters removed isolated immediately. It’s testing goes down. Vince apparently cares profit health staff.  I’m fan Dana White, rest UFC done amazing job thus far. Oh gosh! Sticky Blood Syndrome. Syrup! Ugh! pancakes me, either.

Something I’m learning people go 30, 60, 90 days don’t get follow-up. Maybe X-ray, lucky CT, ECG rapid heart beat.

Definitely, hospital experience unusual pneumonia extra vascularization needs tracked better defined. Interesting, care providers also initially reporting “stickiest mucus” pneumonia (I hate word! it’s going syrup). 

This different, sure, long-hauler/post-CoVid. Many people test positive months out, there’s speculation/recognition results may indicate active infection. They’re contagious usually, least. issue mild cases, equally lengthy intense symptoms - I’m talking non-ICU, likely not, unhospitalized - different you’re seeing - mild cases never tested positive don’t antibodies, symptomatically consistent clinically diagnosed CoVid. may may also confirmed positive exposure. So, bottom line, talking two distinct groups....If symptoms began 3/16 mostly improved, end June, sounds lot like experience long-haul “post-CoVid syndrome” group. I’m using Post-CoVid context formalized name long-hauler. Post-ICU experience. 

Cause confusing, right? That’s basic bottom-line CoVid, think. soon think getting handle something, trends speed different direction! there’s definitely something blood/cytokines/inflammatory issue, there’s definitely something post-CoVid - acute, intense period illness resolved remains lingering often debilitating symptoms people. medical community focused critical survival needs “sticky blood/mucus pneumonia” group. Unfortunately, lack validation protocol long-haulers hampering recovery difficult psychologically, well. 

Most importantly, thanks you’re - it’s got tremendous load hope you’re celebrated appreciated - everywhere! Stay well!  So...can move oxford trial july instead wasting precious time. situation getting better states. Honey, I'm heading bar.

Hope still awake get back. may surprise you... mean sure nitpick like that, general bunch guys standing outside away eachother. Also, infield meeting cover mouth nose glove anyway percent positive results ranged 8.98% 18.51% past 2 weeks 16.78% yesterday

Who'd thunk? Florida represents nearly 20% cases reported across country today?

That's scary. care wear PJs multiple days row.

There people change PJs every day? Life luxury. Shut Fauci. protests led massive spread....and medical personnel OKd it. masks 100%....you still distance stay away huge groups. happening. Yup. I’d also add state state basis, nothing stopping people NY flee areas like CT turn brought cases clusters states. issues Logan lot international travel don’t think NY fleeing really hurt us bad, CT I’ve heard that’s big reason spread happened there. weren’t even putting 14 day quarantines place like CT, NJ NY hardest hit states now. Truly, America First  Check Netflix. two programs, one called number blocks called alpha blocks. oldest learning lot repeated watching youngest picking well. Texas restaurant bartender here. confirm co-workers dropping like flies. roommates bartenders servers different restaurants even Lubbock every restaurant 3-15 cases now. 

My roommate tested positive day ago tested negative. Thank god management smart enough let self quarantine days *do* need open schools, can’t operate like were. district proposed something think could work. open plan, parents choose sending kids school, e-school kid’s teacher classmates, virtual school (homeschooling). second tier also includes physical school, 4/6 schedule. kid would get school 4 days every two weeks, e-school 6 days. decreases capacity giving kids need/want in-person learning/socialization. last tier e-school virtual school. 

We really need look options getting kids campus. might need look extending school week day fewer kids building given time. Idk answer is, in-person education essential. Never mind people undiagnosed covid called flu. strange change definition something fit people start see people it. Almost like cases autism expanded definition 🤔🤔 We're basically Borderlandsing ourselves. Yep, Florida one blame themselves. doubt they’re COVID parties week. WOOHOO, BEAT TEXAS! WE’RE # 1..... Instead order, Kemp personally ""urging"" people wear masks. Yeah, help! Interesting, Windows understands flag symbols translates abbreviations countries names sincerely hope recovers. also hope cooperates closely health officials try contact tracing. hope becomes repentant previously ignorant pandemic hygiene becomes enthusiastic promoter correct pandemic hygiene!

Probably wishful thinking latter part, hope recovers nonetheless. Yeah. Sometimes gotta get away. think actually office home ready go, I'm using dining room walk time, like I'm never truly away work. think well, lot initial surge caused young people socialising death rates much lower among younger people. high numbers society really dangerous matter time spreads older community death rates rise.  making points like original comment, removed. that's way phrased original comment.

Hell, workers lunch restaurants albeit economical ones. sandwiches :) think situation worsens tests shift towards hospitalized cases more? less negative tests? Exactly, quick stunts relevancy boosts easy internet exists. middle ground containing Covid-19?

Mother nature compromise. nothing.  plus would thin herd little bit elderly people health issues, effectively making population stronger less demands taxes resources (not that's huge issue anyway, still plus long run). 

Seriously take good hard look yourself. can't see problem need seek help. Well, *all.* second wave, first wave needs wave infection describes large rise fall number cases. isn’t precise epidemiological definition wave begins ends.

Hmm, argument lie necessary people would acted really badly knew truth ALSO truth obvious everyone aware it? track real life trolley problem.

They worried rush buy masks enough doctors nurses. doctors nurses got sick, even people would die.

they lie save lives, way. Cool, useful chat suppression bot, reddit. said president's name. Cases mean shit, death numbers *do* shoot women children *are* still employed  They'd likely perform closer 750k per day see 100k cases per day Hard imagine differences would work way wouldn’t Florida’s detriment (example number travels FL height pandemic highest). Also don’t forget talking Western European countries many part EU. 

Do want actually discuss Florida’s superior statistics aren’t meaningful substantive way not? don’t think much offer want hide behind attitude indifference.

The sad thing people literally die others need normalcy. Dude, guys don’t care film beating John Rando reason. think care opinion mask usage? We're looking 100k+ positive days ahead, tested (and reported). There's already evidence positive number could 10x what's reported. many instances mild symptoms test positive know personally would never think get tested symptoms people describe. wrong.

I'm done. want accept reality, want keep pretending world wrong. Vaccines work, cause autism, stop dumb. point still ""when"", ""if"".

The American government taken seriously period. Assume you’re still basing assumption initial stories referred differences deaths released. now, Florida’s reporting procedures data relies transparent. I’d bet access info Florida testing reporting department health’s website many countries states.

Do think poorest countries reporting numbers accurately Florida? That’s absurd take. reality hospitals never come close overrun. Idk pains people admit Florida’s deaths per million people outperforms many countries Western Europe. That’s Florida’s nursing home abundance. Florida hate something find interesting. know part DeSantis Trump ally (they’re bit dum dums), act like whole world laughing Florida data shows they’d reason brain buster. live world 99% planet equates Florida “Florida man”, product LIBERAL open records laws (no one cares part though) completely writes various parts Florida beautiful incredibly diverse culturally, much diverse many Western European countries fact. Doesn’t fit narrative guess.... well, could sworn higher months ago. perhaps treatments become better. lot people going die still (and may long-term effects people's health) healthcare system overwhelmed. better get mean toward staff need emergency care

Not sure that’s great look RNs, you’re implying you’d provide inadequate treatment someone thought rude (not actually think would, think it’s bit startling you’d even casually entertain that). goal convince people understand perspective, statements like you’re going effective.  Yeah. He’s way optimistic. 10 days ago admitted knowing everyone wear masks made statement intentionally lied wanted save PPE medical personnel. individual hospitals busy could send surges hospitals area. TMC network many hospitals entire network going surge capacity.

Lol I’ll bet left nut happens tomorrow NYC extremely population dense yes, NYS whole, no. Florida super developed, hardly inch undeveloped land save glades.

That's insane. can't even tell difference different users dumbass. almost like exponential growth something Sorry hear that. Good luck you. daughter waitressing till last week closed restaurant. actually relieved it. survival rate people admitted ICU isn’t super high begin with. remember reading one article early (maybe NYT?) compared covid survival rate normal survival rate believe around 30% normal fatality rate *for ICU patients*. words, always sickest people last chance survival. true Netherlands well. Paracetamol cures everything. Kinda sad 64 deaths day ‘only’ Yeah. Problem is, aren’t here. They’re taking cues really faulty information sources fueled ideology. 

Makes wonder, magic number makes people wake up... like guy article...

The sad truth people don’t give things much thought hits home... that’s part culture prides individualism else. Uh, he’s advocating masks months. say that. already immune systems - well, us. taking granted, actually - people immuno-compromised passing Ron DeathSentence. 

That notwithstanding, devastation immune systems intact. nothing improve immune system limit pandemic. *plenty* public health perspective even governmental perspective doing. 

Please stop person arguing proactive safety. county one first affected (Seattle, King County) US also one best responses. Indeed used immune systems - also wear masks, social distance, shut programs, promoted skepticism casual advice \*ahem\* generally respect thing demands small sacrifice.

Context matters. Experts policy makers knew less March, world full panic mode pressure mounting, know today.

Here's thing.

There people yelling ""But lied"" much willing simply take sound bites conveniently ignoring murky complexity reality substituting truth explain happened. makes believable narrative channels due sense powerlessness anger entire situation. that's does.

Others, like me, certainly accept narratives face value shared public, though. Especially narratives risk hurting foundations important instutions who's mission essence - still - safeguard public's health.

As said, want hold people accountable, start politics ideologies created circumstances landed world first place.  stunning take Disney ran slots season pass holders within 30 mins. pa covid sub full nut jobs pushing hoaxes mods basically nothing it. kismet work expected outcome surprise here, Texas Arizona state rushed reopen Well ends month Even left 100% unchecked come close wiping population. doubt majority people believe end times virus alluding to. maxed normal capacity make beds. mystery conspiracy there, normally need beds available. shortage physical beds, critical thing ICU nurses monitor many beds becomes issue quality care standpoint making decisions gets care.

Had kept stress hospitals so's grandma could lot better care may died, end critical mass 24 year old going attended 90 year old. virus would *only* kill 2% population whatever mean want to.

I'm really sure arguing trying point end day, less people die get care need. pretty simple.  Theme parks also like 90% fixed costs. can't scale decreased demand guess covid isn’t bad.  whole state going fall pacific Andy Biggs worst fucking person Arizona named Joe Arpaio change mind don’t know Trumper

The choice obvious. Leave behind look back. supposed news? Anyone US head straight virus already knows this. Fuck manager ""I'm clock wear mask still talking employees work"" According latest data, total number tested Serbia last 24 hours, 80 percent infected Tonight, meeting Crisis Staff, President Serbia announce final decision profession new rigorous measures suppress epidemic capital.

I good context directly article.

I know nothing what's going Serbia. idiots bosses coworkers. hiding avoiding them. stay home work quickly home stay in. can’t forget time wore bike helmet riding bike. outrageous! think humans dumb internalize something can't see. remember holed apartment harvey seeing i10 water, face bad was.

With even hospitals getting bad people sick still ton people know person sick.

Plus harvey political, heavily politicized. unfortunate think going outside detrimental health. Rock land county wealthy county New York, kids parents paying this. No, 50000 normal Arizona, say? I’m guessing might regret long. Jk, they’ll eat up!

So, covid19 new drug banjo duels?  going say, think there's airport reservation accommodate 767 lol Raw numbers least. testing positive rate going like Florida's is. indicates growth infected people. Raw numbers part story. Look positive rate hospital admissions fill rest.

Even believe ""we need get heard immunity"" best get deaths possible? agree keeping hospitals max capacity still goal. Eh, think it’s mostly elected leaders tribal allegiance. Trump championed mask, conservative governors would have, entire house cards might imploded rapidly surgeon general said masks nothing stop spread general public. Maybe part reason 45 actively downplayed virus directly resulting loss American lives. guess watched superclip ""All President's Men"" say embers disease would disappear soon. actual plan given, hopes prayers!!! Florida governor entered chat think Funeral Directors Florida TV special called ""Thank sociallly distancing"" convoys hearses visiting beaches amusement parks handing coupons cheap caskets 3 2 cremation specials. get news information headlines half baked studies, life wild ride. rumor widely circulated couple months ago based January data Moscow. However, actually non-COVID pneumonia, owing anomalously wet windy winter.

Nowadays main problem misclassified COVID, excess mortality causes health system overburdened plus people afraid go hospitals. I've seen estimates number preventable deaths causes might 1.5 times number deaths due COVID even (and happen country runs beds) I'm driving 3 hours sandwhich bullet another revolver. last week, it’s empty. Maybe 20% capacity. lot people all. masked definitely 6 feet apart. Subways also closed 1AM-5AM sanitation, still clean stations even 1AM There’s definitely evidence point towards that, especially uptick coagulation/thrombus related symptoms illnesses. 

The confounding thing patients severe immune responses tend likely throw clots, especially cytokine storm. labs indicative clotting risk like PT, aPTT, D-Dimer skewed there’s systemic inflammation.

So it’s tough really zero whether virus inducing thrombus creating inflammatory state promotes it. 

If anything absolute MAJOR takeaway don’t understand virus disease state well all. risk exposure, morbidity, potential mortality worth it. say ‘only’ 70%? ...so mean 2/3rds, supermajority cases? ...bruh means it’s extremely helpful tool catch idk 70% cases. Yeah grow lot faster kids. Growing single parent household, mother worked time simultaneously went college.

By time oldest sibling 10, take responsibility ensuring got school mom leave early work ensure got bed mom work nights. summers day camp could walk worked. Even though mom worked constantly always made us lunches school camp.

She also rely heavily parents help sometimes would go stay weeks time summers camp happening.

By time teens mom graduate college gotten job good school district things dramatically changed (for better). don’t answer question antibodies disappeared 2-3 months doesn’t mean person doesn’t immunity anymore, T-cells save “recipe” antibodies case get sick again. You’re right, concerned. concerned without sub filled hundreds posts Americans shocked consequences actions.
If tomorrow, days new post exact thing higher number comments exact same. definitive Slavic response Coronavirus $600 SUPPLEMENT, still get normal unemployment too. Especially hospitals capacity, America position Italy friends EMTs baby. told getting someone watch baby would take one entire paychecks one going quit. [meanwhile - Tampa Bay Lighting (NHL team) school 95% parents say intend send children school maximum possible amount time.

Yeah, always refuse say someone obese, even obviously are, obesity known comorbidity. eventually come around issue statewide stay-at-home order. way let virus run course, given hospitals overrun. People denied care, nothing change that. 

The thing take action **now**, dramatic impact inevitably hospitals reduced. past 3 months, went herd immunity &amp; immunity levels denying herd immunity we're trying flatten curve back immunity lol friends mom tested positive month ago. ended feeling mild symptoms overall everyone fine. Last week, took test came back negative today (not antibody test). agree definitely probably time got tested. allowed hang leave house? would like see outdoors restaurant something don’t want risk anyone, including safety Holy shit. whole new level ignorance stupidity. words describe this.

Ten years? Come fuck on. pandemic isn’t special it’ll go forever ever defy basically everything know pandemics. Even spanish flu really problem couple years. ten years COVID probably still exist, likely effective vaccine least treatment. We’re going locked “every months” end time. little faith modern medicine that. 

These wild claims aren’t helping anyone fear mongering frankly disgusting. Check NYT charts. Florida shit-show. believe limos separate A/C systems driver sealed customers allow smoke. could useful information someone. thing offend everyone “order” meat packing plans opened wasn’t actually mandatory. meat packing companies president played such, apparently media could bothered check this. Hey, outdoor transmission! Also, see fewer ""influenza"" deaths year, since much country socially distancing - therefore catching flu? People dont get it. permanent. Slowing covid 19 poorly thought idea. slow forever kill exposure. 

We’re choosing live forever apparently. first study found significant population detectable antibodies C-19 specific cells it, indicating they've previously exposed virus fought without need develop antibodies all. 

That’s really right interpretation data (plus would *extremely* weird develop strong cell response without developing *any* antibody response). 

Having cells react SARS-COV-2 doesn’t prove infected. fact paper (and couple previous ones) shown blood samples pandemic also SARS-COV-2 reactive cells. people study actually tested positive virus, nearly antibodies cells. “at point” leaves open lot wiggle room technically correct 2022. already going up.....

thats general consensus measure cases/deaths... That's explained Collection complete data expected time initial report, reliable percentage deaths due P&amp;I anticipated U.S. Department Health Human Services region state level within two week period. data earlier weeks continually revised proportion deaths due P&amp;I may increase decrease new updated death certificate data received NCHS.

They data yet, reported numbers (very likely) much lower actual numbers. Check back weeks. FL, understand heat. 

I would still prefer hot windows open recycled AC air.

Stay hydrated, use wet rag. Stay safe. Floridian, agree dear leader. mean, coronavirus sort disappearing here...or tests? Pish posh, cares. Let's party!  Subsidized? read somewhere (the US) contributed like somewhere around 7% funds. rest private funding. 50K cases bad, way many variables testing levels cohort age draw much comparison NY/NJ earlier year yet.

The metrics matter hospitalisations deaths. Hospitalisations heading well states, deaths still falling holding nationally. falling death numbers NY/NJ might masking newer deaths south looked nationally. may seeing effects better treatment younger current cohort. Plus time lag course.

Anyone got graph climbing states shows cases, hospitalisations deaths last month? USA numba one!! B-b-b-but thought best testing?! that's whole new perscpective playing, honestly agree play golf, give public health welfare administrations large budget, let chairs make decisions point, hes passing responsibilities risks others, whilst anything pointing fingers things go wrong. seems like productive person.

he shouldnt biases leading combating virus, lackluster response leadership affect populus negative manner. oh, yeah, sure use unemployment, complain making 4k per month it. 400 million US UK. 2 billion worldwide. PA lame pulling alcohol sales. Texas know count - knows. Big Mask covering up.

Yeah, Fauci needs retirement investment pay off. bingo. boyfriend got sent back work, even though CA slowly pulling back reopening, able afford stay home time around things worse. went deep debt make first SAH, stimulus barely scratched surface needs. struggling, federal government simply care. i'm terrified he's going bring virus home we've painted corner, choice. i'm higher risk feel though virus could kill got it. everything feels hopeless can't imagine future looks like. Apparently discussing likelihood achieving normalized distribution respondents group political protesters purely political response. bot idiotic.

The problem comes information non-respondence definition know whether there's bias respondents. Meanwhile community pre-selected prosecution demonstrated actual court cases actual venues, matter trust authority paramount determining whether numbers reasonable.

Meanwhile lack temporary correlated peak sufficient demonstrate lack circumstantially caused peak temporal domain.

So knowing there's peak correlated protests means know whether protests caused peak separately factor.

Meanwhile also know there's temporary correlated peak cases reopenings.

And know there's correlation anti-mask protests region regional peaks.

So point accuracy detecting absence peak? Oh, see wrote may caused confusion. stuck meant imply tests means positivity rate comes capturing wider # cases expanding net. go up, probably logistics ground restrictions gov get tests.. Hope helps! long take publicly available? surprise all, I'd appreciate sources  might want look graphs. I’m Oregon, topped peak number cases somewhat successful shutdown. comes roaring back unless you’re careful. also mask mandate. That'd pretty interesting clever way play that. Yeehaw ride em cowboy. That's way show em buckaroo Unsustainable surge capacity. sustainable surge right according chart saw today. Probably seeing lost many sales, need staff inside registers out, people likely choose dine much pull say, ""I'm going let here."" cancel ride right front them. rarely escalates beyond that. crap gets posted online combative passengers exception rule. husband got sick January pneumonia tested negative influenza a, b, strep got antibody tested tested negative. think general bugs world getting worse particularly bad cold flu season last winter.

I'm kidding, canceled MB trip missing y'all much. Maybe we'll think October, America would get shit together. then, say mountains 😭💔 revolting. masks... I'm going hunker house starting mid-December, step outside drive parents' Christmas Day spend time them. plan same. mean, assuming COVID-19 still threat, do. Good Jesus Sorry, referring leaking bounty. clever way play, exactly Russia wants force.

That Russia wants divide us done past understand reasonably well. DeSantis wants go home darn it! Roll tide? Wow sounds great, I'll head weekend fourth! Thanks tip!  Yeah, parties nature dangerous, regardless they're indoors outdoors. kind people would put health &amp; safety first stay vigilant kind buzzkills risk attending parties dozens people first place. Yeah I'm sure anyone supposed ""help"" us lol. Unless somehow convince millions Americans wear mask virus hoax. People 1917 Spanish flu epidemic better sense wore masks. century ago It’s really same, come sealed bag pre-packaged stuff like cookies bottle water. people take masks then, don’t get put back till plane lands live LA. ‘staycation zone’ includes Beverly Hills, Venice Beach, Hollywood, Malibu. probably wouldn’t feel way lived Minnesota something. Okay. “Many fatalities likely caused coronavirus confirmed.” Literally quote gave didn’t assume deaths covid?? many highly paid faculties universities overcharging students years. say let collapse. testing increased last week, dnt test like 1 million yesterday? puts positivity rate \~5%. mean deaths still decreasing right? also say extra deaths happened COVID.

People died Karen called cops count too.

I also note we’re July 1 used data May 30. Assuming paper finalized least days ago, used mortality data less 30 days old.

Coroners, medical examiners, process often revise findings well past 30 days. Like test results finally come back. (The patient dead implies low priority processing anything.) Yep, outbreak Victoria, Australia max 75 cases yesterday 10 postal codes got near lockdown restrictions applied. States like Georgia, Florida, Texas Arizona still acting like bad. It’s safe fly right now. federal government laid plan quite clearly. ""Hey states, take care shit."" 30% chance protect, 1% chance maim LA choice another hard lockdown. See data here: http://file.lacounty.gov/SDSInter/dhs/1074931_COVID-19ProjectionPublicUpdateENGLISHWEBSITE.pdf They’ll still drive necessity since drivers need money, especially time like this. like almost always allow underage riders.  way 2020 going could indeed aliens one gave does. explained test two specific antibodies, one indicates active infection indicates previous infection. order appointment negative both. Report Uber please fellow driver needs be. Take photo next time well proof Wow barely?! Better late never guess federal government plan. states. disappointed believed Trump would crush virus I'm sorry loss. funny lot pressure federal government Mexico City open, did, one day, peak cases got revealed day governor like ""nope"" closed next day, federal government happy insisted everything control.

As general population well......a part believes real follows recommendation, part believes real care, last part believes real still believes ""it wont happen them"" life go on. yeah, feel exactly safe right now. girlfriends Chinese understand problem I'm completely prejudice discrimination kinds. Chinese Gov't fucked thats Americas btw Gov't terrible shit like selling weapons Saudi Arabia bomb kids Yemen etc. nothing Chinese people think gov't abusing eroding Human Rights I'm going stop saying raising awareness issues people racist sorry. Driving windows cracked safer son.

Flying safer girlfriend. bug, feature according President. yeah, would ""nice"" make unemployed millions people would working butt off. hopefully that's going happen much longer. entitled certain wage made wage past. really curious though, grocery stores pay well minimum wage. target $15/hour minimum, walmart pretty close that. aldi costco supposedly decent places work well. see reason stay home virtual prisoner.

B/c still give someone \*does\* live work someone high risk group. lived isolated society healthy &lt;40 year olds sure, going public without taking appropriate precautions, number people sick go good one.

If people high-risk groups able lock isolate properly relatives done, we'd much better position, that's reality. death rate virus currently at? Going look like madman 2033 still wearing mask. INDEFINITELY! believe researchers made bad choice biases results.  modeled expected number weekly deaths based historical pattern deaths, adjusted differences season's observed influenza-like illnesses historical pattern influenza-like illnesses.  counted positive differences.  deliberately ignored negative differences, changing zero analysis.  would expect social distancing started March would push influenza-like illnesses historical pattern, that's exactly happened.  Influenza-like illnesses fell dramatically starting middle March, approaching zero first part April.  researchers acknowledge this, chose ignore it, arguing would bias estimate unreported Covid-19 deaths upwards.  ignoring negative differences, expectation weekly deaths higher late March early May, biasing estimate unreported Covid-19 deaths low.

In words, lot deaths would caused influenza normal April caused influenza April, social distancing quickly stopped spread influenza. Instead, people dying Covid-19, spreads easily influenza. Due limited testing, many deaths attributed Covid-19, researchers estimated analysis assumed influenza deaths still normal, weren't.  people socially distancing, influenza deaths low compared normal flu season.

If objective really ""to estimate burden deaths related COVID-19 United States March May 2020"", estimate look excess expected deaths expectations. expect influenza deaths way down, account ignore it.

These details researchers' method explained eAppendix. Supplemental Methods ""Adjustments influenza confirmed cases time series"". please articulate specific question.

and could, include 200 words unable find information. Hoping undetected case rate equally high. increased deaths people die things can't get bed, ambulance time saved. measured graph surge still partially responsible deaths. isnt america subsidizing medicine research tho? someone give breakdown much research cost, paid what? Yeah read comments fuck knuckles Twitter news tweets anything Covid masks. love medical issue political/religious issue. I’m done social media anymore... haven’t twitter least 3 mos today.

Shut down. dad (who travels AZ, TN, SC work) PA holiday weekend sent said stopped inside gas station nobody wearing anything People GA driving factor, rules lifted. turned people go back normal straight away. Maybe much negative press opening early? Eventually people see cases going think safe start going back normal. Wisconsin similar story. opened things back see huge change people's movements.   Oh, would perfect. driver's license know drive. proud folks around Philly handling this. [Smarter Everyday - Social Media part video series, episode dedicated general online “news”, FB, Twitter, Reddit, slightly random one multi-domain war. reddit video made right Covid getting big early March.

New symptoms popping up, tests results making state health departments well isolation should’ve ended. literally cases investigated released day, people missed many days work should’ve. companies intimidating employees getting tested finally test everyone find majority “positive” test minorities. Many minorities could speak English Spanish, that’s struggle own. can’t read. think see going. never control. virus evolving, we’ve gone SOB, coughing, fever, chest pain diarrhea, vomiting, extreme weakness without SOB fever. virus evolving catch up. amount Karen freak outs we’ve seen past month time highs.  used drive Lyft. There's rational reason expose risk like right now.

 


But absolutely to, would make rule unlock door mask on, take mask ride, pull ASAP, get out, stop put back on. Damnn Florida gov even want show up. least driver cancel tell company. passenger, learn, find way spread cancer. husband applied March.. got approved 19th June debit card 2 days ago. long aggravating process many.

This tipping fucking joke abolished. Waiters make $30k-$40k. hard job requires skills. relative REGISTERED NURSE WORKS SENIOR CARE AGENCY freaking Facebook, claiming cloth masks don’t work preventing people spreading COVID she’s willing get arrested wearing one. Airlines lose money flight less 90% full. air travel drops, cancel flights try keep remaining flights full. Uber announce ban rider (or driver) refuses comply requirement entire duration ride. We've seen videos (and maybe person) crazy anti-mask crowd bunch people around. can't imagine stuck car one trying get comply exit. serious person conversation. Goodbye. Well, still need beat 55k record Brazil Well said agree, perfect solution. feel calling 9000 positive paint clear picture without amount tests percent positive. Initially started testing could get tested certain country recently certain symptoms. would look back guess % positive would high. Now, places require little requirements. God layers deception bullshit transparent “ plandemic” . Damnit people easily programmed even stating clearly asymptomatic people typically spread covid 😂🤷🏻‍♂️🤯 starts looking like Americans sort pick n choose information governing bodies deem “ factual” . research, don’t believe one source. Look potential conflicts interest many unfolding amidst global scamdemic . Thats fine, anyone gets sick, ask god heal spot! /s He's wrong know. eventually disappear infecting enough people reach herd immunity. Many people die happens, honestly never chance prevent community spread seems like spreading China back January, China hid severity long enough horses left stable. 

This pretty much like wildfire. stop eventually matter do. prevent lot damage right action.  Better get San Diego ASAP I’m sure didn’t include us too, going work resturant quite scary.

Especially hear front house staff party place every day never learn. ElOn MuSk SmArT CoOl It’s scary beautiful. Probably wise decision, given national trend point. Always better safe sorry. Eh. could 4 rounds shutdowns failed restarts wait vaccine. public health perspective could work. ain't Karen. That's psycho Can’t wait feel bad drivers low key. They’ll put Karen tantrums “tHeRe rIgHtS”. Yeah, influensa numbers lowered social distancing face masks reduce spread I’m home social distancing Can’t blame Hah! Made list, took comment context, neat. Made seem like advocating business owner affected lockdowns wind going bankrupt business anymore, meanwhile...

I saying business owners open violation state-mandated orders close punished removing business license, allow law-abiding business owners markets.

How completely insane terrible comment? seems logical. can't follow laws, legally operating business. Middle East? hear things get bad Saudi Arabia. wouldn’t trust filtration systems indoor spaces. likely recirculating air. really scary number unknown infections. take 10x estimate (which seems middle road), 50k days actually probably relate 500k actually infected. sick enough go get tested, people capable spreading virus. mean half right. positive rate atm hovering around 6-8%, around 20% peak. true infection rate peak almost certainly higher now. many tests back would get positives.

But positive rate currently rising that's still really good news. flying regional airports flights per day, pretty likely see low load factors. government requiring airlines keep operating routes get CARES money. I'm fine mask mandate enforcing it. way coming individuals less careful. government closing business affects many people trying work patronize business want safe, affecting viability entire industries. right cannot continue. Suburbs also. act like virus gone Can’t really guarantee that, masks help give details activity likely nights spent hiding alone bush outside. likely everyone got infected briefings sleeping barracks. find hard believe 100% course spent outside. Worst part countries Italy Spain hotspots back April control now. cases decreasing cases till around 3 weeks ago. Since increased doesnt seem affiliated , post weeks ago, reposted since many people considering flying again, risks seems airlines trying mitigate (who knows really protective) study article nothing pneumonia deaths. link study referring to?  Hey, remember Australia fire? Simpler times. remember going one tourist trap area bumper boats. That's correct. Paypal founded Max Levchin Peter Thiel. Paypal already success bought small competitor order clear field terms agreement Elon Musk would able call founder Paypal. 5yra know true toll ""recovered"" COVID19 smug kids happy. Good know zero argument faced facts. Sucks suck bud. Nope. 

I'll give answer. 

For 1,000 cases 10 weeks, 500 cases 9 weeks 250 cases 8 weeks. 

the 500 cases 9th week double 1,000 10th. 

Which people hard time kind exponential growth. stays really low just.... explodes.

Not wearing mask puts everyone else risk. decade since I've forced going bible school believe Philippians 2:3-4 says something like: ""Do nothing selfishness empty conceit; humility mind regard one another important yourselves; merely look personal interests, also interests others."" 

If refuse listen fact based science implore read everything selfishness scripture, exactly putting mask is. Selfish. Good guess let’s see plays disagree. Aside point lied saying didn’t need shouldn’t use masks (instead transparent health care limitations needs), think Fauci clear cause effect. I’ve understood outcome since Italy, even sort spike NYC. people can’t learn Fauci, endless healthcare workers making pleas, NYC, willful ignorance. really thought implied. loop. reason SD included? ? Effectively distancing? Um I'm sorry is. mask wearing. 19 20 people wear masks Malaysia. Every single store country requires temperature checking self registration contact tracing purposes. Every restaurant public transport blocked seats maintain social distancing. importantly, people well disciplined, know pandemic is, listen Health DG doctors, terrific jobs well. Yeah place people actually go inside McDonald’s nyc hope give shit Brits either, leaches us since WW2 sure what's ""today"" worldometers. example today's number [worldometers counties LA county reports 1978 Ventura county reports 356. respective department public health website, [LA county 2002](http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/media/coronavirus/locations.htm) [Ventura county skeptical reported numbers without clear governmental source. People reporting numbers like wild west. students true heroes I'll pass getting horrific virus.

horrific? need stop reading subreddit...its warping reality afraid virus. suggest /r/COVID19 good dose reality. city Planet Fitness fiasco anyone wondering. Masks far per usual. airline? I've heard american united back full flights can't adjust walking speed already tripping falling. hand, one’s never made it’s pretty decent lockdown project - can’t super picky stuff’s available. There’s TON amazing breads made natural yeast, mention pizza, etc. Yes are... realize see lung scarring long term complication imaging, correct? People also organs kidneys fail ending dialysis. That’s long-term impact. Also, COVID cause blood clot, leading strokes. Strokes cause long-term impact. doesnt mean total number infected higher means found them.

I never said that. said (for third time now) number CONFIRMED CASES CORONAVIRUS US INCREASED 50,000 TODAY RECORD... Florida Texas known lie ass deaths. knows.

But come back 3 weeks we'll see. Systematic erosion public education use weaponized psychology/marketing tactics increase tribalism fear. Santiago Chile went full quarantine 2-3 weeks quarantine started cases went up

I hope guys better people here, go reason (they use masks least though)

EDIT: said hope someway quarantine USA, right? heard Raid: Shadow Legends. 24% u got nearly 5000 cases day extremely alarming. Every time go high chance u get virus. business level, June strong month push companies hire industries ruined covid. goes away move back April purchasing patterns. really can’t see IFR 1%. Given many people asymptomatic/mild, 1% even seems high. exactly that. That's know Florida well all. Yep, that’s epidemics work. hit densely populated areas first hardest, aren’t controlled they’ll eventually become endemic disease hits everyone pretty evenly. Take seasonal flu, example. get Idaho. course people fleeing cities already infected speed process.

I do, however, think people attempting escape virus going Idaho smarter mother’s friend flew Texas month ago attempt escape shutdown order. understand, even he's dumb enough actually believe this, actually say publicly? Pretending like problem clearly problem surefire way lose re-election. anybody team tell this? Goes freedom enjoy defend life? wearing mask ruins others. Also, literature cite medical reasons go masks either old, specific, involve COVID-19. e.g. paper masks influenza common cold another one surgical masks surgical environment. We're dealing COVID-19, influenza common cold. They're citing stuff like 2005. bother sort forward citation search? Anything cite related COVID-19 even literature, report. look, cite Yahoo! article evidence masks cause death... lol 


I'm even convinced even read abstract articles lol really read articles get rather detailed - titles necessarily tell conclusions authors. probably forward citations well make sure missing anything showing previous claims true small important overlooked detail. Gotta understand conditions well: transmission hospital setting different transmission virus, vaccine treatment, general public. bet study even saying masks effective, probably something like comparing different types PPE something finding something better masks good idea. 


I felt need write since lot people believe citing one two articles enough justify something. go references section article, see like 20 references many them. I’ve looking covid patients nurse icu. 

even test negative, take two weeks, patients deconditioned take months discharge them. 

Most Trachs. sever ARDS paralyze 2 weeks. lost muscle mass. breathing muscles weak. need massive amounts rehab. 

Take look nurse got covid fantastic shape before. looks like half man. 

Most patients looked older, obease, copd, heart disease, and/or diabetes. None left hospital walking. needed go rehab facility Take will, flew back florida michigan last week, two days later developed symptoms went get tested waiting results. quarantined florida entire time (have house there) wore masks. potential long term exposure airports planes got sick.....needless say wish would drove.... cultural. state, police said wouldn’t enforce it, didn’t resources, caught on. 100 percent stores, 90 outside social distancing isn’t possible. Rural PA (Bedford County). Masks businesses uncommon. Compliance 100% 25% either. know totally believe masks, also going yell poor minimum wage schlub charge store policy. mask wear it. fully covers nose mouth. try follow six foot thing. Again, store employees mostly set policies get paid enough yelled Entitled Jerks. William Wallace, particularly oppression, going nail sticks up, here. There's like 20mins left day think probably it. Virginia went ahead phase 3 reopening today. Restaurants go full capacity. shit stupid. Currently 40% Americans considered obese.

Exactly this. contact tracing never work US. People hide stigma. lowest amount deaths Wednesday since March 25th (even 26k cases two weeks ago). Kudos healthcare professionals. Everyone circumstance...work starve. happens different speeds. parents worked hard inherited money, delay working longer, eventually money runs back choice. Even 1% billionaires provide kids literally infinite inheritance, even takes several generations, end right back at...work starve. can't even learn ourselves. See NYC No, you’re right, didn’t. That’s hadn’t evolved yet. Except really true deaths lag case numbers. deaths starting climb again. test positive? It’s mistake.  dragged pandemic going cause far, far economic damage locking harder curtailing would have. New Zealand extreme case, it’s consumer spending bouncing back even faster expected. US spending tanking due reasonable fear. 

Beyond that, mass mask adoption would allowed lot economic activity continue. Goldman Sachs released estimate federally mandated mask wearing would protect 5% GDP hit. 

Not wearing masks literally knocking trillion dollars US GDP. one actually forces anyone work, money live society. better jobs available, going live street feed light Yeah dude saw image thread we’re surrounded red. 

Me weekend: people fit wearing masks refuse get vaccinated. Also yes Ya Florida somehow pneumonia deaths since March last year. Weird works.  USA! USA! USA! USA! Well title really spreading misinformation. Mexico also testing people already hospitalized covid19 conditions Honestly US ever subsidize medication, would COVID vaccine. It’s best interests Trump things able get back normal November, he’s able give free vaccines whole country October might actually reverse tide win. Even ignoring election, economy hurting I’m sure giving free vaccines make money charging exorbitant amounts nobody getting vaccinated Total tests per day pretty much same. left best part. also circumvented courts put pedophile back house infant son he'd admittedly molesting.

Let's also forget Doug knew pedophile transfered Montana.

Doug also blamed parents girl put path pedophile ""Protecting"" her. 12 22. also blamed open letter. People fucking right make people deathly sick. Oh yeah, I've seen too. I'm trying reassure he'll fine. I'm glad voted him. Though said worried general consensus (I work hotels COVID-19 hot topic) Americans start caring majority us lost someone know someone has.

/s Can't wait DeSantis' reelection, realizes voter base listened receives 6 votes due essentially killing everyone.   popped earlier. 

The US wants China let in, China refusing bend quarantine rules, demanding full 14-day government isolation quarantine. Given things are, think China gives fuck America wants. 

Legally, diplomats summarily removed failure follow local laws, failure follow host quarantine seems valid reason. guy studies fabric name Weaver

Coincidence? Florida already fudging numbers substantially, ya, happens. time probably lot recovered cases happened december - february didn’t get counted didn’t know test it.

so total probably balances making current case mortality rate still accurate. America 2020 truth dead believe whatever want. Find idiots believe confirmation bias party!! fed government gave $70 million develop drug want charge ridiculous amount. Wealth health Texas' unofficial motto now.

We dont coronavirus vaccines. never made any. one first. holy hell... That’s say die next 2 years we'll burning extinction next 200. Good plan! weird articles like ""news"" written issue Europe...

Nothing new :-/ Looking visual graph daily cases since March it’s clear true beginning exponential spread/growth cases (with confirming spike % positive). Logic dictates haven’t seen associated growth deaths yet. hope death trend much milder case % positive trend, we’ll see July progresses. may make things little easier understand reopener. maybe this
http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-04/26/c_139008212.htm

Or feeling like math strong point, find extensive testing confirmed deaths shows 18000 deaths 250,000 confirmed infections 7% CFR.

It seems like area rife innovation. strange US waking late. live Eastern Europe required wear masks beginning April. like 3-5 new cases Covid 19 daily controlled clusters.  get they’re saying they’ll open now, things keep exploding like can’t see happening. **Same regular schools,** NFL season, hell NBA NHL supposed resume later month. Serious question, university held legally accountable push forward opening turn severe hotspot? college kid forced pay tens thousands year education *and* forced place COVID going huge risk I’d pissed

No, meant one. first comment thread, since reading doesn’t seem strong suit I’ve gone ahead put letters **in bold** highlight initially said thing regular schools. hope helps definitely say he's good playing audience exploiting facade buffoon British politics. Intelligent definitely adjective I'd associate Boris. Cunning exploitative would lean towards. he's handled covid looks like company sent macro business strategy planning marketing department completion. He's completely utterly depth dealing crisis. Compared trump who's depth tasked form complete sentences, he's quite moronic look Germany see grass absolutely greener elsewhere. miss it, entire team missed 🤦‍♂️ Sounds like excuses poor handling countries covid response. blue here...not red. HGTV paying enough? really make sense though, much travel counties time. NYC outlier due treatment practices proven harmful ok walking dog wile neat anyone? I’m glad state taking action make people wear masks 'scapegoat', escape goat. escape goat funnier. deaths would start go weeks would’ve like, 5 days ago.

But afaik it’s usually estimated people get hospital days 8-12 die, it’s usually days 14-20. would barely able see increase, considering death information take week updated, can’t yet see case spikes starting around 12th resulting spike deaths. Nah they’ll play, without fans probably. Maybe delayed. They’re already playing soccer Europe. NFL still months away mention I’m sure schools colleges require read first two words title know talking city.

There something mind numbingly embarrassing party. little bubble mean us leftists see hypocrisy. huge disservice party/America unware. precisely China switched strict government isolation quarantine versus voluntary home quarantine. takes little disease spread quickly widely. China known making numbers make look good, pretty standard so. Good brought up, many speculations countries undereporting stating actual numbers. 

I also read articles covid related deaths declared due causes. 

Unfortunately hope. There's way us find what's legit what's not. It'll take years actually look back check count. don’t even words comment. know it’s old post sincerely hope aren’t parent think children’s emotional well insignificant.   Covid really surprise. fact global pandemic magnitude 100 years is. likely. leaves bitter taste think may long term issue constant peaks troughs definite long-term vaccine comes out.

At least I'm handling better co-workers. Doug Wilson would call Muslim, say illegal, probably put cross. church cult, religion. feel goddamn defeated right now, know I’m alone.

There math set forth beginning used scare family friends OVER:

“ONE person average infects 2-3 OTHERS! Repeat 10 times. Think shitty multilevel marketing schemes NEED ENLIST 3 OTHERS take world!” cried. 

And DAY, still say “I don’t know believe!”

It really shows much America willing sacrifice follow hope/cause/reaffirmations want believe — true. Lol @ believing anything outta China sky-high results easy explain -- though easy fix. Latin American nation stubbornly shunned wide-scale testing instead runs exams sickest patients.

It’s exactly according article. believe 50% rate weighted function total population way. don’t know rest country, said closing bunch testing sites Texas. live Memphis. Things bad here. People wearing masks, usually, though always. worst offenders state Eastern Tennessee. went Pigeon Forge Gatlinburg, one maybe 2 people wearing mask crowded streets, crowded restaurants closed tables, crowded stores. looked like last summer, pretty much. living rock past months know pandemic. hope finally realize blame him. spelt 'shuffle' wrong. showers hard

But working class offspring barely literate immigrant educated Mississippi public school system time rated 50th 50 states could figure something privilege education money couldn't.

Because think Ashley Taylor Bronczek really needs hear that.

Tell I'll happy give tips next party. Since clearly ability figure herself. Yeah USA handling poorly can’t imagine what’s going India Bangladesh Meanwhile Florida take telling someone wear mask assault shit MASKS KILLING US!!! state fucking dumb. Propaganda... Stop spreading lies make China look better. Another Swine Flu jumped humans earlier week China That's assume linear growth. growth exponential. Let's take case India, rather curious case (lockdown place cases still exponentially growing):

If India keeps growing cases steady rate 3.5% per day, seen past month _with_ lockdown place, reach herd immunity February.

By October November 2 million new cases _every day_.

The 13 year angle makes sense infecting maximum 50,000 people every day. number sick people increase, number people _those_ 50,000 people come contact with....until get exponential growth.

This best-worst case (where exponential) naive assumption, way. worst case comes pass (India lifts lockdown, hope given up, it'll even faster. much.

In case, assuming exponential growth bloodbath. God help mankind. not. really matter anymore. personally know 8 people got virus pretty early, 3 counted towards total needed hospitalization. 5 told going registered critical state.  “OMG always make trump”

“OMG nobody found way blame trump yet will”

That whole point initial lockdown. stay shut forever. goal never eradicatation. Oh yeah. I’m around ages kids throw parties...but would never anything stupid. 

Kids like give generation bad name...I times unhappy say generation kids...they’ll probably regret decisions get older actually brains fully grown developed. Fucking hell....

Swedes masters hypocrisy think that's good laugh? Wait see cult members try pretend he's always favor masks. county 13 cases total. people aren’t wearing masks much should, responsible ones are. new cases someone brought came play volleyball. LEAVE COUNTY ALONE! scary part didn’t give shit coming back ny highs. 

Just stay fuck home ffs. deaths high? stop downplaying covid slimy rock Well one thing there's lot money and/or job security whistleblowing. blacklisted chosen profession can't good ol' wallet. can't say anything I'm personally involved, ""hey wife's friends nursing school told X want remain anonymous"" exactly carry lot weight credibility.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree. don’t see necessary virus high survival rate. Measles, mumps? Maybe. COVID-19. could argue elders risk don’t take it, take since ones risk.

In opinion, choice. feel like making mandatory completely unconstitutional defeats purpose freedom liberty free will.

And you’re right. live New York, licensed gun owner, won’t scared use rights threatened, that’s second amendment made for. dare New York government try something like this, right defend rights. course different situation, huge party already broke code young people acting foolish isn’t likely reasons aren’t complying (the reasons wrote), general can’t say blame anyone doesn’t want risk someone else’s job. Personally got wouldn’t names give, oh person pharmacy, person walked outside. 
I don’t go parties stuff mean long hardly safety nets worker protections (as time passes Corona relief stuff dries up, companies calling workers back, don’t come guess there’s plenty unemployed), expecting 100% compliance unreasonable I’d say. Florida need stickin' masks Yeah IMHE wrong every step way, believe deaths stay low It’s particularly surprising me. thing modern society simply don’t need know things. whole civilization, better worse, set make really really easy survive. Can’t support yourself? Others support you. Ate much food long physically can’t get bed take care bodily functions? Modern medicine nurses help you. Got legs? predators here, you’ll fine. I’m hating fat people disabled, I’m pointing examples simply don’t need self sufficient lot different ways 2020. 

So, knowing shit? Also totally optional, course. absolute dipshit wouldn’t able reason way wet paper bag, modern civilization covered. don’t need know anything. Modern laws protect taken advantage severely. Modern medicine save get sick hurt yourself. Highly specialized modern careers allow make living without knowing anything anything. Etc. slam religion hard, obviously religion certain extent encourages try find optional shit yourself. Religion holistic self-contained approach life, somewhat attempts answer everything itself. Sometimes also actively encourages followers seek information outside itself. 

So no, moron gets podium tells masks interfere Gods breathing system, I’m surprised. remotely. guess no... Sometimes think split west pa, pa, east pa different is. guess philly pit similar whole central area wtf. Plus erie madness north Fireworks unsafe combined different type alcohol. Also, seems like viral load talked lot. Surely mask would help comes viral load/exposure? know World Health Organization United States entity right? American Academy Pediatrics recommending kids go back school Fall. reason keeping kids home worse (e.g. social isolation, poor learning, etc.) hurts Black Brown children especially more. trust scientists. michigander, completely agree you. president like governor, fewer people travelling Michigan better. Dew wait hospitals get overwhelmed that’s death rate goes dramatically. idea death rate double case rate growing exponentially joke. fooling yourself. Take virus seriously love god wear masks.

Source: hospital worker considering third even virus cut wifes income half, hard thing financially. even directly due expenses children. I'm home 5 days week full time dad thing outside full time job. Sounds weird, work 24 hour shifts, makes sense. 

The biggest problem us actually cost housing. close buying first home house poor result, there's way avoid it. 

We thinking buying investment properties farther away continuing rent cheap place longterm. Sounds crazy much prices jumped 3 years ago, may option avoid living check check indefinitely. RIP single guy feels women appropriate age completely repulsed me, seems easy. Isnt extreme cases? Regardless, ya fun. see Rand Paul embarrassing fuck Fauci? Dude couldn’t answer majority questions thrown admitted entirely qualified. Think we’ll figure then? I’m doubtful Denmark recommends danes dont go sweden Americans showing rest world stupid are. think countries struggled like Right, ones far along. like Oxford well.
It helps repurposing existing vaccines literally throwing everything they've got it. It’s well known president germaphobe. first moved White House took issue long serving support staff way jobs. one case disliked maids touching bed lined bare hands. saw entire staff go crash course re-training adapt new presidents expectations. details still fully public staff served many presidents distinction complaints.

So HW doesn’t want public know often public stance towards testing control coronavirus isn’t direct odds it’s handled regards life. Meaning WH hoards massive supply testing kits tests retests everybody like paranoid crazy multiple times week keep president safe bubble. really doesn’t need mask one coronavirus anything getting near hasn’t sterilized screamed out. Perhaps he’s seeing there’s limited quantity kits testing capacity it’s course better you. probably closer truth means he’s probably even bigger asshole everybody thought that’s possible. Nah air Force literally could pay go sit packed sporting event people yelling cheering 2+ hours. friggin way, never people wrong idea: freedom comes responsibility. isnt *way out* responsibility. 52,609 new cases July 1. 
There July 2, still July 3.

I last week too, ""most cases ever"" Wednesday. keep going Thursdays Fridays. predict much reliably. say looked good it. Sort like lone ranger. amazing guy. Learn history see design windpipe wraps around rectum cool outgoing materials, get restricted large load passes by. Never gonna happen states. We’ve told generations we’re special individual butterflies. Show humility quit acting belligerent fact people's lives hands.

I completely agree. Everyone feels entitled ""view"".

Covid19 give shit view. dumb government still claiming there's community transmission lol. Yeah, that’s ticket 

Such ignorance Trump get burders now? Jam clam out. trendy. good job hiding stories. think people making stuff never hear Hmm. Yeah. I'm sure dealing 100% rational people. Maybe want fun parties stop. obviously think virus risk serious compared ""real"" consequences missing work fun. Unfortunately still early Kentucky's outbreak, surges states. Deaths usually follow infections 2 3 weeks. Hopefully figures hold though.  defending people getting courts involved horrible idea. feel like huge conversation criminal justice reform, week later everyone cheering truly unprecedented overreach. fun games someone thought saw party (or made shit up) investigation facing fines nothing. held legally accountable knowingly endangering people masks. Jesus. helps others, helps you. mixed messaging hurting consensus giving fuel deniers. I, one, never understood could one way street helps one direction ineffectual way.  downvoted oblivion weeks ago pointing care would rationed beds full. Doctors would forced deny care older/sicker patients younger/healthier patients get care need.

Texas reached capacity week, admissions still rising, beginning. Unless caught protest - contact tracers told cannot inquire further.

It's difficult understand attending event thousands cannot inquired about, party we'll subpoena fine give names..... really seem like trying fight virus much punish specific activities. yes, New York fuck around, come selectively want trace. remember Obama wore tan suit. Except Mexico neither Central South American. So.....? everyone surprised virus causing health problems point. Pointing fingers regurgitating ""snear snear wear masks cases cases cases"" like get it. Cases going up, humans humans, getting angry segregating it? 99% people survive probably less 5% see adverse affects. Unfortunately people accepted ""shit happens"" saw coming decades. slow never stop it. cant even stop HIV, normal flu, cold, Donald Trump, shitty people becoming wealthy. \*surprise pikachu\* Yeah popular top name Pharmacy. Sick people come medication every day losers coming rubbing boogery hands pin pads surfaces. stomach churning.

Look hospitalizations, control plus Florida trying keep actual numbers deaths DL. SERE deploying Iraq '08. anything like that. Healthy smart ;-) we? fireworks shows cancelled around here. Hey hey wait sec get carried away lmao. Oh nice, dad happy see haha. That's good, Germany pretty proactive yeah. quite bit open adhering guidelines set Health Ministry we're still cautious part. Yep hope numbers stay low! Quit yer Bullshit. know yesterday's american academy pediatrics report kids really spread covid. /s I’ll take “No duh, Alex” $800 win. FAKE 
/s Yeah, US media building idea Mexico going hell AMLO. Get prepared greater north border interest ""saving"" Mexican people... 👀 said airline “expert” days ago 30% reduction flight capacity; leaving middle seat empty, revenue made way. cases :D point, epidemic going much longer United States, course testing performed United States Japan. still epidemic going Japan well, I'm sure also would conducted much tests. Another misinformed American think really get unless designed tight seal? example blue surgical masks lots people wear really get tight. Even reusable cloth ones I've got nose piece seal well enough prevent glasses fogging up, means there's gaps. would say time learned treat Covid better, cases end morgue. US cases much later Ireland. Mike Ditka cure coronavirus Da Bears win every game least 50 points.  Yup, especially cases us discovering viruses long became widespread.

Notable ones includes HIV, isolated 1983, circulating since 1920s. recent discovery [coronavirus first identified 2005, traces since 2001.  BLM March. worry July ....🤷‍♂️🤪 might missed joke. concerned addition serious point following might happen. 😑 you, Hitler?!

Edit: guess need /s took 4 months US get 1% population infected. Shit, I'll give 2%.

Now long take get 80% (more less what's required herd immunity)?

By calculations 40 times that, 160 months. 13 years.

And that's take account immunity might last months, 13 years whole new generation born, reach 80% might take 20+ years.

No, hope vaccine and/or treatment. knew lying beginning yes people stupid need told wear mask professional. Americans got passport traveled little they'd see masks common Taiwan, South Korean, Japan. fact I'd say wear masks often there's pandemic there's pandemic here. Ok back point, can't say whether right thing time. I'm guessing calculation made time since PPE high demand. arguing him, guessing reasoning was. fuckin despise government, manipulate information make look like everything control official numbers even considering results given States. check site [http://iigea.com/amag/covid-19/](http://iigea.com/amag/covid-19/) . compiles info presented States Fed Gov. difference \~17k cases 1.5k deaths. find simply ridiculous. States like Nuevo León reported 11.7k cases far official number considers 6.2k... Thanks done, sir. fact anyone assumed first wave joke. That's Mexican president exactly . many friends family members Mex horror stories get far worse here. time deceased burned backyard. Sad times. Yeah hes wrong outdoors point putting bandaid gunshot wound calling good. Dude needs take real measures, fast.  he, hopefully. havent done enough study trust one particular one others matter, that's exactly i'm looking 538 also warm, sunny coastal states summer lot people wanting go beach bars. recent surge limited there. like 30 states seen recent uptick, including blue ones like Illinois. NY Times animated map article current spread throughout states.  know. Back testing capabilities limited accurate Depends whether wearing masks type mask eye protection wearing. see confusion now. yesterday, ~5000 additional new cases, BUT, also additional 3000 cases backlog previous days. “total” 9000, true new amount yesterday 5000 people care old people teenagers. Irresponsible nice word Can't come back fall never goes first place!

*points forehead MAGA hat on* Washington County? Thank God Ny banned florida afraid isnt silly. appropriate attitude.

Fear necessary; understanding virus, assessment risk behaviors help mitigate spread. aggregates look leveling off. That's i'm looking 538, take one extreme position Nah, COVID tests. However, see confusion now. yesterday, ~5000 additional new cases, BUT, also additional 3000 cases backlog. “total” 9000, true new amount yesterday 5000 Impressive indeed also goes Poof shoot lysol cornhole. It'll like dream. lysol beautiful let tell ya E  Holy crap, 15% !!!!!!! Damn. still governor nothing. insane! I’m confused causes wave. people taking precautions something virus itself?

let's see wake assume I’m card carrying conservative. Couldn’t truth. 

The massive tax cuts top .01% shameful, said much happened. 

Keep throwing logical fallacies though. May odds favor question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies.

Clearly hooker. NY State says gatherings 10 okay. early twenty somethings party 100 people. host already showing symptoms least eight people infected.

These selfish dumbasses lying contact tracers. straight hanging them. 

And large party area, know least two others taken place.

This happening 30 miles North New York City. already 600 Coronavirus deaths Rockland County.

Now party goers subpoenas looking $2000 fines.

On bright side: New York fuck around. come you. damn release vaccine already..releasing prematurely prob good harm point. not. look numbers failing elderly.

This sound good. plan work everyone? distinguished infectious disease medical expert realize virus spreading non-use masks amongst population wouldn’t slow spread virus place strain medical professionals? Yet instead telling US residents wear masks, Fauci repeatedly,on national TV, told everyone masks useless normal citizens. VAST majority masks people wear today still aren’t N95s, lies later ‘justification’ protect medical professionals? science wearing masks didn’t change past 90 days I’m actually appalled anyone would naive enough believe otherwise. What’s justifiable stretch imagination lied American public prolonged period time virus spreading exponentially. shake head frustration, knowing months years look back wish taken heed articles like . Even young healthy susceptible long-term COVID-19 consequences cause permanent organ damage.   watching “fall Rome”. slow motion. Asshole headline hard-right radio outlet. wear masks around people, yourself. station deliberately provocative. Getting really tired distortions. Eh... sub saying sort thing months now. freaked Florida beaches Spring break nothing came it. Deaths trending downward cases going up. Another Mexican here.

The situation getting dire, mostly terrible mixed messages federal government giving population.

Our president adamant covid big deal federal budget going big astronomical good projects. Like tourist train going destroy way many acres jungle trees. F U K ? confirmed cases: ✔️

Disbanded pandemic response team: ✔️

40m unemployed: ✔️

Crashed market: ✔️

Dogshit leadership: ✔️

Selfish citizens: ✔️

No end sight: ✔️

Two scoops ice cream, one wave coronavirus: ✔️ hiding numbers sense control number tests administered, real scope epidemic never known. 

Another problem lack testing, even attending doctors 95% sure patient covid died it, counted statistics unless actually tested positive. others said, get test need obviously symptomatic already even guarantee..

Edit: clear death count clearly inaccurate, even subsecretary health (our Fauci, Hugo López-Gatell) said much various times. Yes, useless like previous president sadly shit right? Interesting herd immunity actually achievable, definitive word pronounced post Covid-19 recovery immunization duration. shit deceitful. Confused screaming!!! assuming testing facilities capacity Likely 20k based rate. live Florida one seems care pandemic point lol reduce virus spread again? 

Does gathering spread not? one seem answer without qualifying worthiness cause determines it. See simple is? 

I’m saying it’s worthy cause. I’m saying think 20k people cramming LA streets didn’t cause spike clearly performing Olympic level mental gymnastics.

Do get now? say visited second home, says took family beach. understandable is, time Coronavirus' exploding across country going kill quite lot people get control, right Florida even trying. 10,000 new cases day state population 21 million, counties quarter tests come back positive, allowing ANYTHING absolute essential open nuts, economic consequences damned. We've decently big fuck-ups recent vaccines... go first, I'll look distance. Hasn’t already multiple reports don’t test dead? they’re already treating suspected COVID won’t waste test find cause wouldn’t change treatment? Never mind pneumonia death caused COVID isn’t counted either. Shit’s whack yo. see, know 'freedom' crowd got way. Apparently Google Wikipedia valuable skill sets whatever teachers do. personal observation take grain salt. one interesting subset non mask wearers nyc really attractive women. sure why, early mid 20s don’t seem wear much. United States perfected messaging us across every political sphere, identity, group membership. irretrievably fractured country pretending one big dysfunctional family that's simply case. time break smaller countries. agree. whole situation brought light toxic US politics become. made wearing mask political. also somehow made political question whether good idea largest protests US history middle pandemic. nuts can't find anyone saying ""wear damn mask no, though cause, time protesting streets"". Yes, said ridiculous number that's joke. Right. mom librarian (masters degree), didn’t extra stuff. always worked part-time non school related job summer soon old enough left home alone (to smoke weed, run streets, fight like cats dogs w/siblings, etc., ideal). use local town example lockdown flaw. citizens work essential jobs. Plant, manufacturing, medical. Lowe's, Walmart, contracting jobs deemed essential. said entire town looked like business usual exception closed restaurants. 
And people wearing masks? Pretty much anyone essential work establishment. Got plant work day? Take mask walk Walmart. 

From start Lockdown meant ""essential employees"" stay place business duration lockdown. Martial Law enforced closing retail, gas stations, fast foods. Treat like month long post Cat5 Hurricane went through. would upvote Comment evidence supporting premise, not. appears people racism also people believe science wearing masks. getting close point need call spade spade. people problem idea others know what’s best them. bad, it’s true. Life uh, finds way dying, staying alive. don’t see issue Texas: Hold beer! Geeze man......I hate everyone Florida right now. good thing everyone Alabama afford doctors bills hospitalization. totally facing tidal wave medical bankruptcies set chain reaction debt defaults..... experts predict 100k per day June? epitome frivolous activity absolute lowest priority reconcile conflicting messages American Academy Pediatrics saying need re-open schools ASAP deputy director CDC director claiming we're still beginning pandemic potential seriously spiral control US one guy, Spider-Man. once, never wrestled again. Better avoid next 2 weeks.  I'm sorry. terrible. hope get counseling even though know intellectually your/her fault counselor really help see clearly peace. Also still feels way therapist help find ways make living amends, even family. know still early there's lot healing done too. I'm glad okay. stock market never cared stability nation. core mission. core mission concentrate capital, allows development requires economy scale, spread investment risks around.

Note feds print money .. never run out. concern printing money inflation. economy, inflation risk nonexistence. fact, talking deflation risk right now. come back haunt us economy good again, always raise interest rates slow economy inflation result. either this, people dying drinking cleaning alcohol. Can't US normal one fucking time? seems like they're testing seeing similar rate positive tests. seeing young people getting sick they're dying rates elderly. 🤔 also going refuse testing people dying ""pneumonia?"" beautiful little angel :( That's quite conclusion jump to, particularly world seems like many people still think masks self-protection. someone know seriously ill. 

I'm going say ""both sides same"" generally speaking, personal experience motivates humans better abstract concepts. trust members media telling careful, personal experience left might convince stop asshole. college program Disney 

What that? Ahh, today's infections magical number based infections within last 14 days, standard max incubation period, meaning 10k tested positive today, infectious long 12 days ago.

I get lost statistics. thinking like this:

Your 13,800 people infected first 10k people infect another 19k people (13,800 x 1.38 = 19,044), add another 13,800 people original 10k infecting day 2? real number day 2, 10k people, 13,800 + 19,044 = 32,844? so, hope so, pretty grim. math 12 days 10k people infectious day 2 infection, builds pretty fast. Like, ""477k 12 days"" fast, that's calculating based 10k \* 1.38 = = = = = = = = = = = = 477k, which, again, count original 10k people day2, day 1 2 people day three, etc.

I hope botching whole lot. Nobody ever accused floridians intelligent Lol, numbers perfectly reflect situation quarantine observed many people. It’s almost like it’s spreading exponentially. sort model predict things. joke Donald Trump That's exactly see it. (Short term) profit made either way. cares economy collapses due pandemic ravaged workforce already milked enough uber rich ride waves instability? need masks doctors 

That message put enough PPE protect everyone needed reserve health care professionals first. federal government months prepare pandemic hit, could put plan place produce PPE part broader national response strategy, didn't.  mean little debate party wants less regulation straight white rich men.

Not sure get 50% population vote interests top 10%. buy idea temporarily embarrassed millionaire either. think gives average person much credit critical thinking skills simply dont possess. think lot easier hide bigotry misogyny behind ""traditional values"" convince people Jose sneaking across border better life good reason give billionaires tax breaks. got diabetes, there's way hell going parties right now. going parties anyway, come on, known high risk. 

Not excuses sociopathic ""friend."" USA ! USA ! USA !!!!!  Looks like Floridians getting math lesson Floridian here. I’m thinking nailed it. DeSantis made clear doesn’t want lockdown avoid costs. Wow, site shit show right now.

 I’m 27. horrified 10 years younger squad think biggest risk going bathroom stops. Pay extra attention safety precautions try use bathroom places clean frequently (rest stops restaurants usually better gas stations, varies place place).

In terms risk people, quarantining two weeks trip two weeks minimize that. September also ways away, guidance/the situation might change then. Keep eye news stay informed.

With proper prep work, moving low risk activity. think delay long careful. course. behind apartheid Atlantic slave trade too. likely testing enough people get large enough cross-section sample.

But also probably testing right people (to degree), meaning focus contact infected people keep contained. Testing probably 100% random.

That could mean maybe rate growth general bit lower rate infected people found testing. would good news… well good get infection rates :/ believe Floridias positivity rate going despite increased testing -- bad sign. learned read partly playing “Wheel Fortune” DOS/Windows 3.1. Don’t underestimate benefit game have. kind brain dead behavior isnt point. point people act like starving people death. starving death. died within week cancer. literally signed DNR 2 months prior lucid. refuse feeding tube placement upped pain meds level basically comatose. kidneys already giving point. breathing already labored. starve death.


Shame implying starved sister death. hope never watch loved one die cancer. Please wear mask take recommended precautions, could niece daughter. makes smile mask. Congrats!

Wait. High hospital capacity normal, sign efficiently ran business. Plus, people ICU covid patients. estimated 20% Houston. [but thought health officials said mass gatherings spread faster crowd. actually trying argue scientific fact? ‘whole causes don’t spread covid’ camp? lot assumptions go that. New York still holds US record highest number cases per 100k.

If seriously think Florida hit 100k per day regardless lockdowns, would basically require 100% state get infected. lot people got shoved back employers refuse enforce sort safety policies. agree wholeheartedly. wad told (haven't factchecked though) Wolf's approval rating gone like 60% 45% thanks correcting me. literally know friends (most middle aged kids, married/divorced) like amusement parks. Different crowds guess. Good move. Arizona, moved from. Gotta pay somehow, elective surgeries people want go hospital get treated, cant afford keep ER ICU running staffed. And, related news, scientists announced playing fireworks dipping hands gasoline may hazardous. want count South America North America single continent also count Africa Asia one continent Deaths take 3-5 weeks contracting virus, take 2 weeks reported Florida. trail new cases significant margin. official data often significant delays reporting, data within past two weeks updated frequently. can't believe nyc headlines cases country. Given density way life here. proud state once.  we're also consistently declining. we're measures USA put place. AFAIK, European countries reopened bars retracted closed again. hope real football still comes Europe. *Africans wanting clean water* fuck!?!?!.... Kids start school August!?! weird. Can’t wait Tables, Ladders &amp; COVID events! Y'all fucked remember release data know find it. people downvoting don’t like truth? really don’t get it. That’s daycare providers generally watch one child, that’s income comes from, *multiple* children. no, 5 dollars per child hour isn’t underpaid. Again, shouldn’t get line business can’t handle it. afraid even see 4th July COVID infection bump 7-10 days weekend. No, that's works. 

A cross section give accurate _relative_ percentages, _absolute_ numbers.

This poll 1,000 people understand percentage people intending vote candidate, idea total numbers (they pair percentages previous turnouts past elections make projections).

The cross-section give indication rate-of-growth, can't tell accuracy many total cases there. people saying we're trained use n95 mask ones walking around nose poking they're even wearing mask all. important reminder Dr. Kohli heart doctor trained expert field. pool? Pretty sure death penalty universal healthcare, stop crowd.

The people run churches ashamed themselves, putting revenues ahead safety - they're literally going get parishioners killed, they're fine it. could least get wear masks hold services outdoors weather better, would lessen careless disregard safety. whole new level youth recklessness. It’s horrible kids. Schools don’t know it, kids falling behind development. Also lot kids don’t someone watch them. going packed people wanted take advantage less people due virus scare. 

Said people also post social media there's many people. Unironically. No, using correct data bunch hand made ones bring also keep disposable masks car case. Yeah, got test done Miami Saturday, I'm still waiting results. Yeah FL got turned away sore throat. &amp; next impossible schedule appointment since busy already. legal basis compelling someone talk contact tracer? give accurate information even one decides talk contact tracer? 

After all, someone forgot he/she went? talking party alcohol, unreasonable someone drank much forgot it. 

To clear, believe everybody *should* cooperate help stop spread covid-19. also concerned government overreach extrajudicial punishments supported laws. legal basis contact tracing, solution pass laws support them, rather rely ""pressure"" government. someone put hospice there's assumption they're going die soon take radical measures make sure they're eating enough take radical measures make sure they're pain last hours last days.

“Positive cases” refers active infections, diagnosed PCR tests. 

Please stop spreading misinformation.  forget people reported pneumonia flu.

Haha, that's hilarious. Maybe people little corner world didn't, assure world taking seriously longer that.

It's fucking ridiculous tin foil hat shit think Chinese released purpose vaccine ready go could make yuan. realise thier economy also crippled right right? much think might make vaccine?  Death rate usually lags infections weeks. We’ll 9/11 every day much longer based current infections. Germany like 400 cases per day number growing anymore kinda feels like over. new mass outbreaks churches meat-processing plants. live San Francisco, real estate prices dictate house kid. can’t both.

Hysteria running around yelling sky falling curling balls depression. also fear worst case scenario. prepare, vigilant. deaths mentioned tail ends quarantined cases. new cases' deaths still unknown, still rising breaking records every.single.day. 

Did read Corona party put money collection, invite someone Corona whoever gets ill tested positive get money. second, third 20th got it? corona say, well infected one since that's rule, I'm gonna go infect bar then.

I live near Sonora lot Americans going medical tourism town stocking huge amounts hydroxychloroquine. Travel bans gonna origin specific, passport make sense That's us Action, words. TBF, write sentence like story story showing higher expected proportions asymptomatic/low symptom people lower death rates earlier projections change look open country?

it's hard take question ""honest"" obviously loaded come foregone conclusions. study, parameters listed, tests mentioned, track *every country location world seen this*. So, no, ""story story"" supporting want believe, one either. 

But I'll take if/then, pretend embedded loaded question this, were, fact, honestly curious. 

1) leaving critical information evaluation. example, masks hospitals February March, means getting more. We're currently gowns wildly low gloves, curious.

2) means, paying attention, need treatment would unable get it, even space hospitals. even take account ran tubing one point, pressors, fentanyl, we're nearly hydromorphone now, using fentanyl's place. last bits information *also* demonstrate prepared treat onslaught new cases.

3) fact, shut down, business continued done usual hospital, would've entire medical systems collapse back early March, even without wild covid cases, supply chain down. still down, functioning somewhat better before.

4) Lastly here, order take economics question full accounting, need know exactly surviving covid costs...as in, get twice? costly 2nd time? creating new batch health-crippled people meantime? Spoiler alert: get once, surprising amount people left permanent, life-altering damage, even among heavy disease burdens.

The best means treating sick country prevent new cases, people act like spoiled toddlers refuse simple things allow us prevent cases shutdowns. Looks like website wants worldometers traffic advertising dollars. got wanted. Give people masks!

I'm actually watching tng episode Cohagan right now. Lots folks US getting charged $4,000 tests due lot BS/Insurance fuckery.

Yeah makes fucking sense. I'd rather selfish American stupid European. stats mindlessly believe everything Trump tells you? mean block happens 

when turn religion

into mausoleum

&amp;#x200B;

they want everybody die side mandatory mask laws overriding state laws, yes obviously do. Nobody arguing that. I'm definitely not. 

The CDC exists. Clearly government thinks controlling disease part mission.

I'm saying government something unconstitutional, many consitution paths could take would improve situation. lack taking actions people upset about. 

Stop misrepresenting arguement. arguing something everyone agrees sound right/smart. working, common fallacious tactic.

Also, least used sort logic/line thinking. said anything useful informative replies. Yeah America suffers world suffers. Americans aren’t buying worlds crap world suffers. ridiculous take. martyr, victim hero Watching outside, situation America absolutely terrifying. people still acting like inspite knowing around 50K people testing positive daily? can't understand mentallity people right now. simple. simplist things put godamn mask visit somewhere thats home. 

I honestly thought back March going hell Canada. Thankfully, leaders Federal/Provincial/Municipal made politicking it. noticed FB, Insta, etc, EVERYONE personally knew said/shared wear mask stay home. look USA wish pull lot foodsource depends North Carolina, considered new hotspot, probably why. I’m sorry, liquid knees?! surprised too, trying go people wearing masks. uncomfortable there.  like ""Bar lives matter"" people TX, ""my body, choice"" slogan work shitty choices affect people's bodies well. you’re might well wear hazmat suit haven’t physical checkup years. want need one, I’m terrified go hospital right now. wonder many million Americans feel like suffer health complications fear. It’s going disappear...you’ll see guys. Like magic. disappear. *clicks heels three times*


/s I'll take word goes Supreme Court, otherwise everything said meaningless since government often whatever wants, enough people care, goes deemed constitutional not. No, fully expect answer no. I’m aware antibiotic indicated virus. 

However medical care Mexico pretty iffy, especially things involving federal governments guidelines people go pharmacy medications without seeing doctor. Azithromicin nearly antibiotics available counter. question whether azithromicin commonly administered Issue charging people quarantine lie symptoms?

Quarantine get tested days 7 12, tests came back negative (the first confirmed case NZ tested negative 4 times row) get symptoms day 13 lie want pay $2,000.

Then risk wasting government spending, shutting economies etc literally nothing terms government budgets. Check 

Some peole definitely suffer long testing negative. data 6months people recover. may issues road.... even supposed work wearing mask? People exercise outside home. Hope Iran gets wanted man. Dang at? See, I've trying go Publix see mask usage there, last time went, shocked. Edit: Italy done wave 2 hits. Absent vaccine herd immunity it’s inevitable. tsunami even come way shore yet. say, do? second slope greater first slope? Anyone numbers those? curious lazy  board game based principle? even sure trying say, snarky like ""looks like read all"" added stuff fact. time traveller. 647 deaths per million, way lower America's 395 deaths per million obviously! le superior Yurop! ppl allowed go back forth U. S. Mex ? bet they're pro-lifers making chant moronic. multiply lot testing still isn’t great guy deleted comment i’ll response here.

We currently stair one getting ready stair two. Apparently talk staircases waves 2020. world fucked China Swine Flu jumped humans. China biggest threat world along, way originally thought... new reality least years know there's lot things pessimistic about, still see lot people downplay idea good vaccine anytime soon, get it. there's strain good news throughout whole thing, progress vaccine much quicker initially anticipated. Seems like one thing we're actually bullish going forward. ones Arizona never reopen

Maybe part Phoenix. McDonald's near house (north phx, near Scottsdale) open dine-in, even expanding dine-in hours, couple days ago went back takeout only. certainly matter counting it, well what's contributing increase. example, increase testing lead increase total cases. However, death rate increasing necessarily bad thing. fact, scenario would good due revealing lower death rate percentage.

I'm saying case, I'm sure. showing increase total cases necessarily bad. remdesivir use anakinra? Thank much. can. testing ? dipshit.   I'm Philly. run miles every day. could run mask entire time gets uncomfortable, especially since run glasses. usually run mask see someone coming ahead me. I've tried various masks think neck gaiter best thing wear take run. Uh huh trend now? there's line 2 weeks ICUs fill or?

ICUs filling way reliable measure positive cases FWIW. Hopefully people start stopping spread deaths start trending up.   Shit like this... probably helping   US set record new cases today. time asking ass holes pretty please stop spreading virus destroying country passed. people like looters worse. nice bait post Deist explain way:


To God, nothing. God got plans. Since God created everything, God within everything too. Since God got plans, prayers nothing it. fact since powerful everything controlled too. evilness goodness decided us, God command them. control destination limited. power natural powers storm diseases...

When see another human pain, one tested us. either help get away helping human. Either way choice already made birth. brain, natural.powers things cant choose. tragedies happened, including genocides massacres, happened God let happen...


So, humans, God good. fact, God indifferent. God controls lets everything happening. death life controlled it. us, death scary. reality part reality. fact, living much suffering death. Maybe even more. angry God tragedies made humans like angry weather sending lightning Hitler kill him. 


God care wants know bad are.


So humans believe God good? God encoded us idea good let religions spread around world altruistic ideas them. authority upon everything natural herd/pack instinct encoded respect ""the big strong person"". God encoded brains wants too. 


Free limited. humans cant change basic laws physics. play biology yes cant entirely change too, must play according rules. rock hurled us earthquake, would die. 


Only way achiave ""help God"" humanity. Praying much different meditation. Like meditation, praying relaxes indoctrinates you. Humanity must know universe around turn use salvation. Even Abrahamic religions agree it, messiah angel human. 


I dont believe specific religion thats think.

My rights important life! know you’re certain you’re correct please, please realize you’re not. You’re wrong realize late, all. Trump today made statement hopes virus “just disappear” that’s second time; one making mock outrage attack trump, man fool far head thinks surface sky he’s level ground. He’s delusional, still believe MSM picking trump things dire. would laughably pathetic people still whine mean journalists wasn’t serious. Approaching 150k dead matter months trump spends time golfing tweeting incorrect damaging bullshit, confuses people like leads compare wildly viral disease fucking hypertension. thousands dying day remind thousands people die day natural causes old age?

Please rethink position. You’re wrong side history. Duh, else gonna pay golden parachutes? Negligence. Ignorance. Obstinance. asymptomatic. Classed non-hospitalized low-symptomatic. Pretty broad non specified group. focus 2% need specialized healthcare. forget leave elder-elderly die rather tubing bit, probably left diagram. Im defending stats method dutch use. Im describing. stats specify whatever method rivm using. evidence home made cloth masks work offer protection. another failure government communicate. Surgical masks offer protection. Feels like knew 27,000 them, weren’t uncounted swear, fucking country deal people.

No, Germany, too.

Luckily, asses saved sane government. folks made tremendous difference

Yeah get? dumb motherfuckers god damn moronic flyover states coming tourists bring diseased ass kids fat asses. 

Why

What point 

We’re still banned countries 

Now you’re going come make us sick, even though things stay safe 

America fucking joke believe number future infections adjust current number deaths. No, opposite - deaths follow current caseload delay 1 month.

Hospitalisations already going up. think means? explains alternative facts! Population 7 million 300 cases day, opening everything hardly contact tracing mask wearing, along lot virus deniers. comparable all. foresee problems Generation Z grow up. people think told anything, even save thier lives wrong.

Or anyone know symptoms anything protect others. shit. Given numbers exponential growth factor, given entire US infected year less? 

Has someone worked math? Pizza Hut's largest franchise went bankrupt. mean something. ever arguing that? Even wouldnt increase # accidents, would increase severity lead serious bodily harm could people. say treated joke. county green phase. know PA green means lot stores places open normal normal gets pandemic. Haha, fucked.

Back March law instated everyone wear mask. live shit tier European country.  I’m convinced kinds people either mentally ill way literally borderline retarded. least one things Normally I'd agree take poor bastards them. come jail sentence Similar Daenerys kind forgot Iron Fleet. “Highest record” today new day? surprise.. Shocking.. bright side rest world got sorted got supply chains running run stuff. 3d printing respirators seems progressed. Preventing bacterial infection weakened state. Yayyyyyy......

I wish could move state nonsense. anyone anywhere else though :/ think is? People following strict lockdown rules? Fall? 2022? 🙄  fucking delusional Yet San Diego still open. Yay! Wearing mask hard Trump product tribalism America. Trump could push liberal policies like M4A left would push back it. That's subpoena. It's​ attorney gets judge signs paper orders show court talk, usually witness.

Ignoring one bad usually consequences. [I guess I'm thinking Ganges river thought heard accounts normal see dead bodies trying insensitive. correctly remember read river. 

The remote source found old forum. There's shame culture handing death differently, that's thought India. shit ton testing right now?
Isn't death rate dropping considerably? Asking friend. elementary teacher here, Midwest state ""relative"" control (which still good all), I'm terrified go back. want parents notify final decision kid July 10 - seems ludicrous fast things moved since March control virus now. 

They offering in-person (with low-effort safety know schools muster), online. even consider half kids go day, fixes distancing, busing, lunch issues once. Best plan saw state every day Monday-Thursday, elearning Friday.

We surge surges school starts, 3-4 weeks later know things work, spread parents grandparents easily, lower-income, increased rate spread among families. hit hurt hardest. ""Finally""? California everything closed since like February. areas opened beaches social distancing requirements little bit ago lot places start opening restaurants spacing masks, cases barely started curving upwards (as opposed straight) closed again. death rises come infection rises, give weeks.

People saying weeks weeks. Georgia start opening up? deaths going like crazy? evidence astronauts die space without EVA suits too. 42% New Yorkers overweight obese. Nearly 35% Texans obese alone. diabetes hypertension wonderland even among young people . bright side, vast majority anti-maskers T-rump s-upporters. dead T-rump s-upporters = net positive. picture talking like Gollum/Smeagol does. completely failed duty. look half million dead people (that far) evidence badly failed. knew would terrible needed early, strong messaging specific warnings. high ground catastrophe. job. Fuck guy. 

He get virus bar. symptoms day went bar. brought virus bar shared drinks people. 

He claims authorities told mention name bar went to. He's lying. want sued people infected. 

Now he's self-promoting, pretending want help people sharing cautionary tale. really gave fuck people, would published name bar people would know quarantine get tested. 

He's hard find Twitter want tell sack shit is. Winter coming. He's *open* it. want to, agree it, stop bugging it. Survival fittest....they using COVID weed process see ""strong faith."" There's vintage commercial [when EF Hutton speaks, people Goldman Sachs speaks, Washington listens. Convince get DNR will. That's I've done people front lines. they’re dumb hicks live cow shit think makes free Family Guy prayers.

This US got days.

Y'all may wanna try ""science facts"" sometime. Yeah no, people India dying streets. multiple videos/stories people dying home, way hospital outside hospital get bed.

It mostly left states choose want deal strictly want follow guidelines many states massively reporting cases/deaths straight fudging numbers make look good. /r/moronavirus bunch states pneumonia deaths roof. Covid death rates grossly reported. understand that. People tend trust countries familiar with. people reddit consider China hostile country. I’ve lived countries long time. One major differences is: China Collectivism America Individualism. happens important factor pandemic containment. World Health Organization Thursday decided declare the[ Wuhan coronavirus global emergency, despite spread dangerous respiratory infection China least five asked confirm report, spokesman told RTHK ""preliminary investigations conducted authorities found clear evidence human-to-human transmission novel coronavirus identified Wuhan. evidence limited human-to-human U.S. officials seized email argue the [WHO ignored early coronavirus could likely transmitted people. weeks following Dec. 31 note, echoed Chinese officials “[no clear evidence human-to-human even as [cases even say masks news early days, mid-late January. KNEW getting serious, even random guy China. Cases go quick without human-to-human transmission.

Oh mention naming. Sudden comes China PC, one cares Ebola, Zika, Japanese Encephalities, German mesales, etc.

We acted fast Asia, everyone wear masks dispite government &amp; saying need to. See numbers? They're heartless.  lots wear proudly, they’re different breeds dumb. California really tight last three months well. reopened fast Oh White House fantastic job comes testing quarantining HIM. That's matters him. 500 new cases? Basically every single state US that, right? Masks protect others, also help protect wearers degree. you’re risking life see Vanilla Ice 2020 deserve whatever get Yup. two weeks anti maskers. Somehow. It’s horrible idea visit places it’s treated joke. It’s definitely least double point. number many able test. Really sorry hear :( - there's bright side imho definitely ton research forthcoming surly better treatments. whole planet touched this..... effectiveness masks doubtful anyway? AFAIK, entity managed keep Corona control masks alone, plenty places managed less get rid Corona without masks (PPE health pros excluded).

There seems quite fixation masks, suspect give false sense security. bright side, vast majority anti-maskers Trump supporters. dead Trump supporters = net positive. due respect going none die, even ones get infected CoVid?

Let's face it: deaths happening, including parents, due CoVid itself. due CoVid 'novel' virus g'damned idea treat compared flu colds doctors treating years!

If mother gotten sick month... I'm almost certain would survived know treat CoVid much better even May. toe curling approach. I've got supply masks intend use them, interest going pub never really went lockdown.

Missing gym days kids. 

But home gym go plenty walks locally, hope collective stupidity set us back months would said Arizona month ago early, NEED LESS PEOPLE earth friends med/dental virtual only. oddly enough, undergrad ‘hybrid,’ hold person classes. doesn’t mak sense me. It’s hilarious watching leftists try pin Trump despite huge spike lining directly timing protests. Hundreds thousands people streets close together *chants* crying loud. would like say same, reddit friend. Life Time Corona brought see depths humans selfishness thoughtlessness. stupidity. Trying work things change paths.  hospitalizations rising? hospital like 3 Covid patients hundred back April Waffle House need worry about.   ""Tackling racism damaging virus society coronavirus pandemic world currently undergoing.""

The virus starting manifests said protests weeks ago? gonna rise cases lefties. Wear masks. Makes sense. Close Hospitals people Hospitalized. Maybe he’s learning money can’t solve every problem. I'm skeptical that, even though data support it. Plus, there's immuno-compromised person house. We've stupidly careful. Wuh-stuh-shuh Reported numbers US, 60 people get infected coronavirus minute. that's today. rate go up. Well Gettysburg license plates country, probably would've stroke. Dude giving bus tours Gettysburg even think right. pointing fact past Harrisburg like pandemic exist. read more. Yes. think feel sick probably aren't.  Look oil pulling. may help. Please research though.  Deaths lag cases hospitals better treating disease now. us really *experience* anything, man? Nonono, TRILLIONS. Unfathomable amounts money. way last. Also, aren’t rent freezes stopping soon well. fucked situation going get much fucked yo pretty soon. Especially US continue breaking single day records infection rate continues rising. nonsense? masks, wear one, example, frikin POTUS, one powerful individuals world! I'm wearing mask 3 months already (I'm EU though) yet see Trump wear one.

Sadly matter says large extent, cult followers anyway. said beginning, shoot somebody Times Square. one could argue basically indirectly killed quite bit people either comments hydroxychloroquine (remember old folks drank aquarium cleaner), overall chaotic response COVID, giving mixed signals constantly. least that's looks like Europe. absolutely critical thoroughly stretch reaching much did. 

Just wow. Governor Abbott allow enforcement.

Actually forced cities stop enforcing. 

Interesting fact: people want wear masks fine following rules. cities follow Abbott's rules? fair... lmfao get fuck outta here. know one failure % positive tests inaccurate. Easy mislead manipulate number.

- test people show symptoms % number high. Science doesn’t political bias. wrong, nobody lives billgateistan. heard country anyway. People like problem. government want it. test shit H1N1 eleven years ago, fact man charge today's pandemic sidelined back due incompetence. deaths go too? What? Nobody knew bad would be, US would completely fail every possible way. shares can, always individual countries respond. fair Americans retarded enough believe virus exist long protests, remember protests reopen? I've never seen population allergic responsibilty American population, country populated run cowards liars funny narcissistic can't even see yourself. know entire world laughing fucking stupid shame many people die order prove it. Oh boy nurse Covid unit March April. Everyone buying cheap flights cruises  1 death tragedy, 1 million statistic SC’s governor said today... seriously doubt work. tell paper two separate groups. study big group antibodies sub group antibodies detectable T-cells. didn’t even know NZ - Aus travel allowed yet. IFR basically voodoo right though right, unknown number infected? know, said wild shit worked him. big gamble, think he's got choice stick guns. logically inconsistent argue men guns (police) take others guns. way guns right hegemonic relationship, government aguns, oppress others guns. Remember thought Italy fuckin doomed numbers could never happen us? matter? Same. toll isolation tween's mental health profound. Go outside, maintain distance, ride bike, maintain relationships. AZ. Love call everyone sheep blindly following advice ri ght wing tubers. Germany said please wear mask. week realized far many people wear one made mandatory. wear one places like supermarkets can't buy groceries “It’s Small World” takes new meaning midst pandemic. Well #1 news source USA lot people killed US high schools 2018 (or 17?) total losses branches military combined year. 

Thoughts prayers. 

The president tweeted white power last week don’t see anyone saying needs resign Immediately, removed. 

The US earned this. Lines hours long get tested TX, hope Yeah it’s basically, really like favorite product. Product A, customers buying product B. Well customers always right put effort selling product B.

It’s “Hey I’m Karen demand give customers always right.” See tomorrow. number 1 baby 视频

 Hamilton Free Press can’t spell Tennessee. top brass states taking seriously. government inept world wide pandemic, citizens follow league unfortunately. want believe propaganda bad media portraying, that, fucking numerous people come contact probably infected know it. Nvm, 7 backers already exist vaccine, works, production massively scaled up, new backers bought focus increased. Right lot time mean several months. full-scale market selling food, meat processing plant. what's wrong fear mongering warning something actually frightening? Sadly virus doesn’t kill idiots would make genius virus. wonder many false positives. Tell families died panic, world ending, fine. Time close everything down, go back quarantine. Reopening dumb idea, protests help either.

I think needs laws enforced wearing mask. Thats vaccines work. wasn’t

The vaccine testing modified MERS vaccine took years developed.  Lmao, seen coming. Classic. time, actually true. 

Also ""No clear evidence"" ""not possible"". 

More importantly China reacted found clear evidence transmission - locked Wuhan Jan 23, rest country Jan 25.  Real heroes wear wool. Who's ready 3 million deaths Corona? Really? shitton vehicles border cities plates US owned Mexicans, find hard believe, maybe isolated incident. really think mask main reason this? Idk everyone keeps saying 'mask' like vaccine. preventive measure.

Don't mistaken, everything amazing amount people crowds yes including protests.

Honestly, can't outraged time criticize protests gathering. lose credibility. It’s even worse realize US received highest grade developed countries pandemic readiness. best placed stomp thing even came trusting general public right thing. Oh, give break. I'm mask wearing, calling ""murder"" virus know asinine. hate trump, he’s symptom larger problem. Fauci isn’t clear anything. It’s nonsense talks day day out. 

Social distance, don’t wear mask (for weeks-months least ), kids get anyone get get sick die (ignoring 50%+ dead nursing homes various states like 0.00something % kids)... etc. 

His information overly basic, untimely, fails practical often etc.  talks data day isn’t precise anything people go elsewhere information.  

I certainly don’t trust much. Indeed probably 90% people believe whatever random science article find read fauci fails give anything informative. coworker leaving US permanently take care families India due COVID, think really serious... draconian quarantine measures

For fucks sake stop calling draconian. every country done. US months ago. Enforced quarantine harsh draconian. standard fucking procedure combat worldwide pandemic. seems. sense anything coming went rounds rinsing filtering. One hospital systems work outbreak nursing home last month. 50/70 residents infected question is...why sudden surge? still wear mask go outside. wear gloves I'm going grocery store. stay home that. go eat friends time wore masks said worried catching it. Would really? bandana sweater around yr nose mouth would worked fine could get yr hands legit mask. Concerns supply chain definitely part public messaging, it’s obvious since virus landed US wearing mask public necessity. Thousands people would saved initially full mask-up message promoted day one. it’s clear lot messaging geared “keeping order” unprecedented crisis, MO ultimately cost lot lives anyway.  Good news they’re mass production test trials complete, widely available. blow stimulus check overpriced Apple product China? Thats even good example point though, decent comparison months ago. 3-4 weeks first BLM protest people effectively chosen die die. 70 year old person attended die, take 3-4 weeks. cater fact rate increasing people it, faster spread, think unless reduce infection rate zero one day number deaths 3-4 weeks massive, still increasing.

America fucked, laughable going take millions people dying proved wrong, proved wrong though hope held accountable. takes 1 disease following normal guidelines humanity could extension event? old teachers, one thing. 

My nephew coming Friday see grandparents. I'm rather pissed brother posts pictures kids hanging kids. yelled socially distance touch grandson. attitude long enough miss him. I'm overreacting. could die! Seriously. going ask question. I’m talking me. take comparison. 

So believe anything coming China. Yeah definitely scientist Youre thinking SARs, swine flu infected millions relatively less lethal really looking forward Pfizer COVID19 chipping process new tracked lyfe. 
^/s reatrded idiotic governer said doesn’t believe science expecting ? get US numbers? I’m seeing anything high? Corona sure brings stupid won’t last. popular, source pride. Anti-intellectualism litmus test tribe. free countries stupid? Thoughts prayers go us here. Look Florida council video nut jobs talking rona 5G Freeeedumb China far believable America? least Americans show things UNFILTERED via social media. two would say America hiding. can't find read right now, I've read effectiveness typical cloth mask cut exposure others 30%, prevents 90% transmission. discrepancy due mask preventing propelling droplets far all, droplets reach mask, good chance making through.

Since many people militantly wearing masks, looking upgrading one ones antimicrobial properties specifically increase effectiveness exposure others. experiencing current pandemic? much generalization yet I'm sure balk generalization segments. Well, testing throat samples, sort implying fluffy bj dangerous route. old tried tested thigh-tickler may still safe. know. personally ready give Saturday nights unless know sure problem.  Who’s still 4th July party? Anyone invited provided don’t wear masks! -covid Remember almost funny.? - I'm right beside you. Mass deilliousion?  heartbreaking hurts. Temp checks defeated OTC fever medicine. China restricted sales fever medicine height pandemic Thank you. Stay safe there. God. What. The. FUCK?!?! I’m ATL area. decide kids don’t mind asking!”? Virtual face face? ""I take responsibility"" Nah, makes sense. people infected = people dead = people somebody died infection = people understand dangerous virus is. Well, statements needed lot unpacking mostly healthy people *evidence* would help (you know, ignoring evidence Asian countries, cough, cough). Exponential growth. Always keep mind. One way another, yeah. 

Can imagine Trump got write history books? guys low disease prevalence. night able hitch. Anyway would really worth it, good luck friend. unemployment $600/week federal government. give pay weeks work starting April. Would nice big fat $5-6000 deposit federal, that's even adding state unemployment. Get friend help you. worth it. Let government something right. still hiding/fudging real numbers many states. Hiding Covid deaths pneumonia, slowing testing efforts, etc.

Shit even worse reality. remember said would go away summer flu season haha giving Trump enough credit dismantling pandemic response team, calling hoax, messaging it’s worse flu, it’ll go away summer, masks aren’t necessary, supporting open protests, many things contributed us today. Na would need work 8 hours day 5 times week someone actually translate OPs post. get away wanting life glamorous time -- isn't. fact, important things downright boring, invisible, tedious. good public health system exactly that; also critical. public officials need get back necessary work need's sake, stop wanting name face plastered public domain, includes spend money. Count deaths idiot Well, even random guy China, know. 

And do.

Taiwan, succeeded preventing major outbreak despite proximity ties China, warned December 31 human-to-human transmission, Vice President Chen Chien-Jen repost??? /s  I’m sorry. hope sister stay safe. I'll give go simplistic way: virus replicates spread. ""think"", process replicate accurately possible. Sometimes though, error replication alters traits, example could result new copy makes easier spread. two copies, one easier spread, one bit harder. Obviously would expect one easier spread spread faster, enough similar mutations get new strain time. game probabilities.

It concept evolution. Let's say humans 1 million years ago could eat potatoes whatever reason, 1 100 born mutation let eat potatoes. Initially matter point food shortage happens people digest potatoes survive. many years, humans new mutation exist, evolved able eat back virus. virus deadly hard spread, could disappear pretty easily, however could mutation point makes virus less deadly, allows spread further. time, new strain would become prevalent. Note case covid-19, virus deadly begin with, long incubation period, new strains guaranteed less deadly really necessary evolution standpoint. Yep people say wasn’t serious people aren’t dying anticipated numbers lock downs mask laws. Idiots idiots. Partly, larger part falls president continues signal supporters masks optional. America stop fucking blaming young people problems shit show given us.

For fuck sakes would think illegal born 1990 here... Reminds ""bug-catching"" AIDS parties. 

These imbeciles idea long term ramifications even ""asymptomatic"" case be. looking great. US still dont anything serious this, number see today rookie number. laugh probably have. Thanks brightening day! No, Texas could be. could also official statistics FT uses quite bit delay whereas government quicker put COVID deaths.

I'm Norway official total death numbers three weeks lead time, stop people misreading data claiming seeing lower total mortality normal.

Of course could also overreporting, would easy example someone dying flu nursing home confirmed COVID cases. mean, point, let nature take course provide harsh life-lesson believe liberties taken away wearing mask pandemic? Would anybody really mind? basically survival fittest - common sense = survival. muzzle works Mr. President. Lockdown. Quarantine individual isolated. important none poor response officials get reelected. Otherwise validate things get worse. easy challengers next elections, much ammunition sling. there’s people resisting masks 🤷🏻‍♀️ sometimes everything’s got takin away kids can’t stop fighting Highest record far!

I'd bet break tomorrow friday, 10 1 break sometime next week. Even odds double within next week. We're doomed. IFR ages 20 49 .009% 90 1 million ppl die age range. .1% 49 64, 1000 per 1 million. 5.6% 65 older. 

If get though good wear mask protect elderly. I'm EU, guess US, idea : mexicans restaurant = mexican workers = illegal immigrant = undeclared work = botched work ? 
No idea true... Sadly possible whole world needs it, healthcare workers vulnerable get first. New Mexico closed state borders. I'm alarmed, what? Stay safe brother. Texas: Hold cowboy hat mean, said would dissapear heat too, ""like miracle"" Yesterday got abusive PM's suggesting today would go 50k US.

It 100k per day week so. Good question. I’d like add more: fly Thailand? (I thought airports closed.) infect others way? Also happened Thailand chart pneumonia cases deaths? (I can’t find google more!) Chill 50,298? MAGA! UK we’re wearing masks, apart busses trains. 

Out government science advisers saying evidence support face masks isn’t particularly good. say masks often used improperly give false confidence, offsetting benefits. 

Not sure believe rest world seems something different. least it’s political argument though! Bay Area seems ages wearing masks. Us northwest would also like bubble. Actually, west coast experience FL kinda one wearing masks , young old lol. numbers believed, mostly people. thing weird somehow ""OK"" thing. still large percentage people survive come permanent damage simple fact people ""at risk not"" significantly increase risk ""at risk"" populations exposed. So, y'all still worshipping Elon idiot? Final count 51,097! body, choice love hath man this, man lay life friends

John 15:13

Jesus even said  tomorrow 🙃 small Central European country reopened 2 months ago since almost restrictions fallen. People everywhere without masks, restaurants full people. cases already almost 0 per day, massive increase again. Start second wave. think soon massive restrictions again.

Only vaccination allow normal life again.  Agreed, Sweden bashing threads talking like swedish beat minorities, LGBTQ+ going lining old people firing squad, incredible weird see, definitely someone immigrant Sweden super grateful I'm here. suprising. Schools nut butt. can't imagine hotracking boat atm. really know treat flu colds. tamiflu reduces length flu couple days taken onset symptoms 48 hours onset. otherwise... kind supportive care. 

I'm sorry happened family. virus fair. Cheers, keep eye right first time: **are** five years old. parents? know online late?  

""cake day"" real thing. pretend sort special event baffles me. mom Exactly, places open. one physically force going out. Home school, online education programs, delay year. Finishing school one year later big deal compared health. 


Imagine kids getting covid damage lungs, brain...etc. hopefully long lives ahead them. become adults look back it, would want risk deal side-effects many decades. 

There isnt much worth risking virus outside survival. work eat, make sure keep medical coverage family needs, shelter... yea to. education... no. many safer options putting kids back crowded school environments. fingers America gain collective spirit overcome betterment neighbors, see happening, unfortunately. :( 

Nope.

Americans ""rugged individualists"" picked bootstraps donchaknow? card rooms? Like casinos cards like poker black jack? cal Self rightouness ass. want shit over. Instead bunch turbo douchmonkeys refusing cooperate.

And idea literally "" nothing die.""

People dont ""Know COVID"" order use protective gear. using way saying, dont give fuck get end spreading others could die it.

Simple that. * 4th july coming up
* parties full swing various places
* music concerts there
* looking real possibility 100k+ cases per day boys USA might fewer deaths per million large country.

??? Bad bot Germany good thankfully. 5.900 active cases &amp; 500 new per day.
But that’s maybe people distancing, wearing masks... has, weight matter? remember someone reddit telling USA lucky president otherwise numbers would ""look like Italy's"". Prior lowering % increases typically matched similar change deaths weeks later.

that's actually true all. THIS. much this.

At beginning protests etc., people constantly remarking ""we expected huge outbreak, happen!"" course exponential growth tediously slow first, frighteningly fast picks speed. ""First nothing all, once."" great really. believe average Indian much better immunity diseases major parts world, people grow clean places already immune various diseases(read Hepatitis B). Plus much younger population. fear running money businesses slump, much major cause concern people. Jan 14, didn't. watch weekly updates influenza (like symptoms) self-reported RKI (Robert Koch Institute) Germany. weeks lockdown started=fldrop flat compared previous years. particular younger kids main spreaders flu (not covid though). School/kindergarden closure huge impact here. Months ago talks little much. Alberta (Canada), hear lot much hurting economy little going much worse. disappointing watch southern neighbors treat nothing. blame political members citizens.. can't believe still conspiracy some. 

That said, American neighbors, hope learning curve governing bodies importantly, hope get least amount loss possible. people, divided many different things end day, trying live lives want shortened anyone. Stay safe folks 🇨🇦🇺🇸 Uhmmm excuse me, America #1 bad thing. ^^^/S someone US, hard believe. case number death toll high, surely people find unacceptable? Yet seems like nothing done government. enough mandatory mask requirements, enough testing, enough serious physical distancing enforcement. going on? Someone something already. Maybe Europe older wiser? Australia pretty dumb too. know, trying think situation would like Hillary won, can't really see much better. people sane reaction situation would still - even so, possible, coming her. state governors taking seriously would still place. think Donald helped situation all, really see improved much picture. people like AOC said, removing Donald fix much people support him, policies, racism/sexism, etc still going exist. dont drink, talking him?

Maybe gained christ much attack that. Ah yes, marbles exemple. Thats herd immunity works, benefit herd immunity enough herd immune enough contagious get it. takes generations cycles build herd immunity. ""We've tried nothing, we're ideas!""  I'm pretty sure Vietnam well, rich country. Herd immunity starts effective 70-90%. Lets say even 50% effective, that’s ~160 million people. Even considerably generous fatality rate 1% that’s still 1.6 million deaths reach herd immunity. current measured fatality rate higher that. 

The actual fatality rate would much higher nation’s health system simply cannot handle many critically ill people short periods time. 

So yeah, know you’re advocating it, reaching herd immunity within year vaccine available would bad thing. qualify, can’t even make post office get unemployment card supposedly come mail. It’s 15 miles live, don’t car hitch-hiking (while extremely widespread island) completely gone due pandemic.

I’m going try walk tomorrow guess. Life’s real hard days. Beating people refusing wear masks bad either dying Northeast things reached critical mass hospitals became overwhelmed come pass. things starting reach critical mass point hospitals longer able treat people quality care need ensure best chances survival. Crazy one said protesters positive Covid. Due process always applies matter trivial obvious case is. Damn, thats kinda impressive. country yesterday 1 case case tests per 1 mil quite alr (around 23, 600) couples 80+ sitting super close one another masks social distancing whatsoever. **Motherfuckers death wish.**

You might wrong. Maybe they're ready call day life. Obviously Reddit phds, hows even question? Stop d00mer buying fear mongering “experts” /s fair, minority people put Trump office - us knew good fit. 

I know electoral college exists prevent ""majority rule"" ""minority rule"" led us path disaster. fear electoral college might give us another 4 years circus... mean surely it’s both. Anything everything involves people near causes spread. virus doesn’t care that’s politically motivated not. Can't speak states, Georgia nowhere near hitting capacity, especially rural areas. They're either troller bots can't seem accept facts Santa Rosa gyms open limited capacity limited members. Won’t way long. dad brought attention papers Ecuadorian doctors used Chlorine Dioxide cute COVID-19. report done Univision (Spanish speaking US channel) various researchers found 90%+ effective reducing symptoms drastically. Anybody know anything it, seems kinda strange one reporting it. hospitaizations capacity now?? masks absurd 

Genuinely interested : makes say that? wear one outside slight reduced changed contaminating somebody? dont understand either. huge coughing fit protection, huge coughing fit holding shitty 2 ply tissue mouth. shitty tissue still gonna better nothing. Quit saying masks anything. know bend backwards appease them. level stupidity never fails amaze me.. I'm liking silver lining there.

Just keeping been, washing hands, wearing mask keeping away people 2 wins far. came. maybe people countries dont mind looking country successfully deter virus learn them, i.e china/korea/japan etc. 

something seems like taboo US. brainer....mask helps ways. Aside infecting others, occupy ICU beds weeks, recover live, others suffer die get access healthcare. Next news: **""U.S. army seizes PPE Navajo nation notice""** think golf really dangerous all. distant activity, outdoors. Pretty fucking pathetic (lots of) Americans can't handle months solitude avoid spreading potential death everyone interact with.

What's interesting hospitals shut months. Elective surgery mean optional, means scheduled. expected hospitals overwhelmed anyway. seeing hospitals spiking headlines almost month deaths still dropping. I've asked health care workers claimed hot spots hospital cases patients coronavirus coronavirus? answer yet would explain deaths climbing different levels SERE training. A,B, C believe. friend mine went one actual torture he’s really BDSM said loved it. ""heart attack"" usually refers myocardial infarction (lack blood supply heart tissue due coronary artery obstruction - painful, heart keeps beating, lead tissue death heart). infarction causes cardiac arrest (heart stops beating) get crazy high death rate. roaring 20s July 14th it. Reminds joke : 
Mom dad always said work harder school avoid working McDonalds later. 
I worked harder I'm unemployed McDonalds judged overqualified. I'm actually glad experiencing Washington state. early epicenter, so, large, people listened seriousness this. i've wearing mask since march10. live rural area lately become controversial issue like rest country, due politics. state, got see hospitals fill early seattle. smart people taken notice. sit here, bunkered down, wearing mask go pick groceries, get gas, work site needed. feel bad people heard months, see affect feeling economic repercussions stay low nothing happened geological area. get back work, make living. convinced virus exist communities. it'll harsh reality soon. can't fault make living either. US, even states individually, made mistake managing micro-geological scale also macro scale. either shut down, shut hitting community. trump failed us even bother plan anyone could follow. clear, point, cuomo good anybody could experienced something like lifetimes. I'm sure well worldometers handles duplicates (one person getting multiple tests) really must awful winning hard. time celebrate 4th July lol Also Philly, agree go store it’s nice seeing everyone masks on, many wrong
In beginning NJ NY obviously hit hardest, got hit pretty hard think that’s probably why. Compared 10’s thousands deaths NYC makes sense wouldn’t much attention shone us, 1500+ deaths first two months number scoff at. remember hearing ambulances almost non-stop, hope never becomes case Honestly total cases really mean much comparatively. Italy really bad body count total cases.

Even approaching similar case totals italy nearly 10x deaths texas. thing comparing NJ texas, number cases nj 15k deaths texas 2.5k.

The virus still relatively harmless without commodities. seems policy risk demographic gotten better minimizing exposure resulting less severe cases recently. Could wrong, likely take texas catch death count infected. Hey!
Chunky pero caliente. studies would peer reviewed published, yet. people don’t care right wing nutjobs. It’s 20% country that’s brain dead enough care Covid. It’s lot it’s minority Seems likely point.  Glad they're willing help, fucking embarrassment help necessary. administration leaving people die undermining virus response. Could like cruise ships. ceiling high developed nation, measure per capita US nowhere near top. Stop deluding yourself. Disinformation That's mind boggling. city 439 new cases past day, 1,236 day that. absolute mess here. We're hoping people stay home fourth July, Memorial Day Indicator we'll likely witness another spike cases. live country beat Coronavirus back mask wearing outside public transportation. 

Blaming 'mixed messaging mask usage' scale US outbreak dishonest. mixed messaging got control. (The rule masks public transportation appeared June 1.)

you're piece trash human record numbers, USA literally winning every fucking day Yes Americans don’t embrace “believe” science knowledge: vaccines, climate change, god maybe even gravity parts! point trying make here, I'm loss? Right, mean, \*our\* rights? Like right use hospital overwhelmed people, right healthcare workers safe work. rights get virus? honestly think see selfish are; goes heads seems. Or, it’s data past four-five months. And, look relationships number new cases deaths whatever period like (two weeks, one month, etc.) “Hey 25k new cases multiple times past four months plot deaths certain time periods see pattern based exact number”. Crazy know. Best luck you! EU here. favorite chinese restaurant still resumed seating still takeout-only mode. 
They repurposed double door entry sas take food, pretty ingenious BTW. live country beat Coronavirus back mask wearing outside public transportation. necessarily see swift near-full re-opening done wise, we'll see takes us.

But anyway, blaming 'mixed messaging mask usage' scale US outbreak dishonest. mixed messaging got control. (The rule masks public transportation appeared June 1.)

In US, mainly disastrous political response meagre lockdown blame. I'm nursing student, tell fun news viruses pretty much non-existent. 

Your odds getting flu norovirus small hell, get lower increase enforcement public mask wearing. 

There's silver lining. lungs could get torn up, least odds getting stomach bug wayyy down. 

It's much, something. idea I'm getting voted people inevitably pass covid 19 people die. disagree mitigate risk topic header 'Young adults unconcerned coronavirus ""may killing people,"" doctor warns'

We know May - will. USA deaths totalling 160,000 covid 19 deaths taking consideration counting average death rate. 160,000. Let sink in. UK 60,000 average deaths. crazy figures virus unknown future consequences like Fauci keeps saying. imagine 18 months time 10% suffering lifelong dehabilitating problems. let die forget Super PACS. corporations declared individuals ""Free Speech"" rights allows dump huge amounts money campaigns every election cycle Americans used pretty-please approach quarantine they’re surprised it’s actually enforced also means less sick, still infectious people going there, knowing they're truly infectious getting best treatment possible. die, even worse, they'll infect new people even die, too.

There basically effective strategy involve testing people might sick risk spreading disease, e.g., contact high-risk area. 

Everyone behave sick, especially symptoms. However, plenty people reluctant unable get tested therefore infect people otherwise would have. hope you’re dad that’s dad joke. ""Muh Freedoms"" - florida man y'all still receiving 2, 000 Canadian dollars government aid every month? 

Someone know got sick work pay bills. lot people really want stay open, can't afford shutdown. better getting nothing, one time $1200 stimulus check we've received since March. Unemployment benefits increased ended (myself included) workplaces reopened, people actually deemed ""essential"" never stopped working (they also get hazard pay lot businesses). 

I leave job super safe covid measures basically pressured either report immediately resign position. city one leading hotspots United States trust management's approach (as is, actually call OSHA company back February numerous safety violations). left, want chance giving at-risk family members (one diabetic one asthmatic) covid. 

While feel okay months, I'm upset senate continuing delay second stimulus package millions people struggling pay bills. Hopefully something soon, otherwise even people forced choose health paying bills. can’t contact trace effectively without sharing location data. 

You can, german app exactly that. Thank you, thought thing. problem back February Fauci cdc said wasn’t necessary wear mask didn’t help. incorrect fauci admits it. 

The reason said didn’t want run masks knew already shortage Nobody said ""all doomed"" though. Moreso implied country, going total mess.

Here's hoping not, although numbers rate increase hospitalisations concerning regions say least. blame on? Like said, blame Facebook circles subjected to... However, also see rhetoric best friend's mom Fox News.

If willing answer, I'd love hear think mom believed/s that. usually eat raw meat. Cooking I'm pretty sure proven kill it. dont inhale lick packaging wash hands well after... like would anyway handling raw meat. Yeah, see _him_ wear one? # HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

# AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH Deaths COVID flat 500% increase pneumonia fatalities. Technically could true, person get's tested 1200 times. Also, live country beat Coronavirus back mask wearing outside public transportation. necessarily see swift re-opening done wise, we'll see takes us. 
 
But anyway, blaming 'mixed messaging mask usage' scale US outbreak dishonest. mixed messaging got control. (The rule masks public transportation appeared June 1.) thank Black Lives Matter these. would guessed... Lmao America shithole look Netherlands. one wears masks apart public transport. first shortage, even right maybe 5% people wear masks stores. Although scientists even advising use masks here. there's also protests riots, like Germany. Haven’t reports get covid-19 you’ll end underlying health issues it’s cleared up? thanks that. yeeehawww\*cough\*cough\* Yeah, US getting destroyed most. coincidence US actual adversary China? think so. Spain's numbers closer 47,000. either way please stop 28,000. Holy fucking shit. insane Actions speak louder words ever  Dangerously stupid. video woman breaking emotionally today (2) noon Shijingshan Wanda Plaza received notice positive nucleic acid test eating ramen restaurant sparked concern.

&amp;#x200B;

Beijing Youth Daily learned Shijingshan plaza Wanda Plaza Shijingshan, Beijing, July 2, 2020, 12:50 p.m. female customer, Xie Mou, received positive nucleic acid test results China-Japan Friendship Hospital, field epidemiological personnel quickly control patient West Square open area, reporting local police authorities control movement people scene, blocking scene. Customers Ajisen Ramen lunch. staff closed merchant killed, scene personnel contact.

&amp;#x200B;

According Shijingshan Health Committee, today 13:00 noon, District Center Disease Control Prevention received report immediately went Shijingshan Wanda Plaza, person claiming tested positive nucleic acid, Shea, conducted on-site investigation treatment. Xie transported hospital fever clinic investigation, Wanda Plaza site controlled, initial determination close contacts sent Shijingshan District centralized isolation medical observation site management.

Also according CCTV news, July 1, Beijing one new confirmed case, male, 44 years old, address Fengtai District Lugouqiao Street Dajing community.

That's case everywhere also know people 60 IFR less .1%. 

You foolishly ignore virus **much more** infectious influenza. ypu could quote said that? countries we've seen whistleblowers come say they're forced manipulate data China US.

Perhaps might happening countries, far uniquely American circumstance, given authoritarian openly corrupt political party leading country.

To say ""all countries it"" heavily undercuts fact government actively lying population pushing economic reopening cost people's lives. Italian here, still looking star-spangled smartasses said happened Italy *third world country* (8th economy world) *poor hygiene standards* (we pretty much *invented* personal hygiene).

You guys *four friggin months* prepare get shit together.

The tragic loss innocent lives obviously saddens me, still, pretty much chose hubris path pandemic, think would happen? Straight? Every single location protests every single day months?

Because that's equivalence youd have. Tens millions ignoring scientific medical advice every single day case 1. protests cities around country case 2. dont think theyve set month long constant 24/7 protests match behavior case 1. Again; headline completely misleading. 9000+ cases didn’t originate one day. Approx 5800 tested positive Tuesday. 3000 cases came backlog added Wednesday’s tally. yes, technically 9400 cases, isn’t one day Couple things 

Final death data always 6-8 weeks slow. Second average deaths based average several years. Third average adjusted differences age distribution population. 13.999 pound rock going hard throw. You’ll ninja real close nest guess still make people sick enough need hospitalisation enough numbers (and know can) still overwhelm hospitals effectively shut ICUs new entries capacity maxed. it‘ll real bad time heart attack/gun shot wound/fall/car crash/fire/drugs overdose/whatever else.


It still cause massive wave knock deaths even doesn’t kill directly. Believe plenty country too, thankfully normal people outnumber here. I’m American northern Italy, I’ve telling family south since February take precautions stay home saw bad things get live. 

Did listen? Hell no. One family member hosted parties throughout stay-at-home order, enraged like didn’t even give damn living here. state one ones experiencing huge spike, do? Threw big party again. 

And several people work HEALTHCARE. I’m totally baffled behavior. point I’ve stopped saying anything obviously don’t care say. 

As saying goes: lead horse water, can’t make drink. rely HIPAA wearing masks

I don’t understand this. privacy health records influence mask usage entitled? hope hospital keeping safe can. Big love Europe - Italy pulling impressive numbers now. really hope guys title led believe going African Karens anti-vaxxer nonsense, actually justified concern vulnerable Africans exploited treated human guinea pigs rest world. lived India several years, including last swine flu outbreak. brutal reality all-cause death rate high even fairly large pandemic get lost noise. example, city lived in, Mumbai (you may know ""Bombay""), sees average year 25,000 people die dysentery. Add malaria, dengue, malnutrition, etc. there's much ""older fragile health"" population left begin with.

TLDR: going hard India get good numbers there's whole lot noise higher ""normal"" death rate. 395 vs 210 deaths per 1M population. Still quite difference. Although current pace seems worse US Seriously, duh! first wave getting started. like people cannot accept reality. like people think wishing makes so. WTF? douchebag. Fuck ice source shows numbers hospitalizations? DIY instructions homemade masks/face shields clear back March, possible make mask fucking cotton T-shirt.

So 2 coworkers ended getting covid, one doctor, CNA. CNA even showed work sick still vitals every single patient hours sent home. doctor believe showed symptoms home took 2 week leave doctor also close contact days leading showing symptoms.

after 2 weeks returned work, another weeks past single patient, employee showed symptoms.

I'm surprised can't find comment ANYWHERE thread, interesting important observation despite cases US growing exponentially since mid-June, deaths still steadily falling: 7 day average deaths 560, lowest since March. Serious critical cases also fell slightly previous day, although hospitalizations going up.

This surprising, even though testing since previous peak, positivity rate tests increased since mid-June. Hence, would expected rolling average deaths would start going now, shown signs stagnation far.

From observations, concluded long exponential growth cases contained next weeks, US hit hard second wave infections first wave.

AFAIK Belgium five times many deaths already point time. consider infections grew exponentially, approximately doubling week, takes three weeks average infection fatality, Belgium may 5\*2\*2\*2 = 40 times many infections locked down. way around, Sweden may 1/40th infections Belgium onset set measurements.

Take care States protests seen rose cases hospitals seeing increase. Who’s news outlet? Fox? going in... now. That's true all. idiots abound corners world, American Idiot particular virulent obnoxious strain taken broad root country. 

I think America's woes traced supposed infallibility constitution sides isle. America gets credit early democracy stuck around, constitution system govt much stuck permanent Beta. amended constitution eight times past 100 years, every case tiny revision. Ultimately, there's much individual laws case-law underlying constitutional framework updated anymore. 

Switzerland's current constitutional lineage, example, dates back 1848, revised numerous times since then, latest substantial revision taking place 1999. Yeah. whole world, USA knows. Oops. would typo 16 hour shift. Thanks. Fixing. Deaths come later. No, I’ve even called 3M Texas here, also, city similar thing. mayor preacher strongly believes people actually care health well-being others. Unfortunately, consideration people doesn’t exist self-entitlement roof midland. 

Not mention, “BuT MuH FrEeDuMzzz!!!” adapting less lethal contagious strain.

And considering heightened handwashing, social distancing, face masks, putting direct evolutionary pressure virus contagious possible overcome passive social defenses. stock market never real economy.

The real economy people buying selling goods services. fact stock market propped GDP fallen cliff blows stock market myth wide open.

The stock market measure wealth wealthiest 10%. measure healthy economy. paid profit insurance companies. decent societies healthcare systems situation like go massively budgets gov signs check public health.


This pointless argument, whether health insurance private public whether private hospitals remain solvent nothing other. Medicare-For-All nationalizes health insurance, still relies hospitals separate, private entities. single-payer systems Canada, Taiwan, elsewhere (government-run single payer health insurance mostly private hospitals). contrast say, NHS Britain, VA system US, hospitals also government-owned government run. 

What proposing government bailout/relief hospitals, that's perfectly achievable current US system, also required even Medicare All. insurance, private public, going pay hospitals procedures never happened, hospitals unable procedures exactly becoming insolvent. People still wearing masks also super easy make new account sadly. receiving food something definitely disagree with.

If disagree agree. One many double negatives think looks like USA, Brazil, even India completely given trying contain Covid-19. US re-opened still getting 20,000 new cases day, accelerated 40,000. Brazil never shut down. India kept numbers low middle May, gave up, seems India's government going let rip through, come may. sad frustrating. Covid-19 stopped. Look countries East Southeast Asia. That's one big chunk world 2 billion people Covid-19 contained. Would nice would get severed company. He's malignancy need excising. Surprisingly people ignore redirect anything say pretend happen.

There's really point wasting oxygen idiots Santa Barbara closed bars indoor dining too.  America shithole country. talking tests. Tests updated ALL. know comes France side, see lot people making conclusions based numbers even updated months. Sweet Georgia Died Sticking head sand probably good alternative wearing mask though. Bit harder breath though.  mean overall IQ going Denmark proof masks needed society already big home life, abided goverments guidelines.

Denmark largely ghost town while, see people shopping, everyone took good distance, nobody ever wore masks. Thats total confirmed country Netherlands since started Huh? Unemployment benefits States tied fired lockdown. Canada, yes, it’s tied. it’s not. think hit rate referring percentage tests given return positive. I'd put money us already seen highest death count days. cases bars protests, demographics 99.7% chance surviving. Trump weren’t president, he’d still tweeting things. would like evil shadow Twitter president, criticizing everything Hillary did. We’d levels non-compliance masks social distancing, possibly worse.

Also, say Hillary effectively shut country early February, 10,000 deaths instead 125,000 counting. Everyone would saying ranked economy “nothing.” Fox News come from? inability read beyond liberal newspapers doesn’t translate alternative Fox. 

1. Hospitals incentive cite source death know several friends healthcare across American states frenzy internal dictat quite simple. Mark Covid move on, even person died 4 Comorbid issues fatal themselves.) 


2. CDC’s pathetic guidelines “assumed Covid” (which require Covid mentioned death Covid symptoms...like “Will COVID-19 underlying cause? 
The underlying cause depends upon conditions reported death certificate. However, rules coding selection underlying cause death expected result COVID19 underlying cause often not. “


3. Comorbid attributions Covid. Many fatalities annual stats diseases Covid. basically never know many people US died *of* Covid merely *with* Covid. guess would 60 70% reported fatalities, well within range annual casualties influenza/pneumonia respiratory ailments. 

The data collected US woeful. CDC acknowledged, example..

1. False positives testing 
2. Muddling testing antibody testing 

The Yale comparison “this year higher” *average* last years. Why? Surely also compare seasonal spikes like 2018 influenza burden twice much 2019, still pandemic. 

My point way many discrepancies data real picture emerge end year. Maybe. Meanwhile US shown inability manage anything methodical precision (as UK). many goblins data. string comments wholesome Utah 4th 24th (Pioneer Day) assume disaster around *lot people* want blame protests, evidence support it. Covid blowing places reopened early, places big BLM protests. probably protests take place outdoors nearly everyone wears mask, general public tends avoids areas protests happening. Nobody wants blame protests far, protests shown contribute anything. Theories explored NYC people masked, protests outdoors, NYC greatly lowered number infected people loose time protests hit. China study concluded getting infected outdoors difficult protests, especially masked people, may underscore study's conclusion. Deaths lag behind hospitalization, treatment improved somewhat. They're sick listening experts. think that's see home country starting losing deck. Everyone knows America holding pocket aces. Hit rate meaning percent tests positive. 6.7% way high. means we're catching anywhere near cases. Germany still testing symptomatic people

That true all. [Everybody get test free Germany, even without symptoms contact infected COVID toes thing Lets let thoughts prayers crowd proceed see works them. I’ll hole, far far away kook’s prefer expunged. It’s natural selection. joke, I've heard multiple independent healthcare workers actively encouraged ""accidentally"" perform tests incorrectly bring negative results. providers apparently actively punishing workers submit many positive tests. getting closer silver play button ""we added extra 'ding' totally different song"" terms lifestyle things running. roughly 10 new cases past month, overseas quarantine. thats state almost 4 times size texas.

I hope continues die here. Cinemas festivals begun starting back revert back everything shutting people getting sick would horrible . brutal form population control perhaps? 

India sure needs something curb rampant overpopulation, using covid-19's way it. Yes privatized healthcare! We're go debt got sick expensive medical bills. Try change people freak fuck out. Ask pay fire department gallon water used put fire say course not. brainwashed media work third shift amazon amount people take mask go manager. lot smoke together break(ofc mask). people don’t care think it’s fake what? still go work drink play

The sad thing lot countries successfully reopened exactly things without spike cases. dont. Use head. even much thinking read. well definitely ""under pressure"" Well, population 331m (USA) vs 83m (GER), roughly 4x, number new infection 50000 (USA) vs 500 (GER), 100x . Sweden fairly sudden change testing strategy tbh, explains almost stepwise change ~500 ~1000 cases per day. testing changed USA, different different states.

I'd expect mortality rise significantly coming weeks obvious waves rising several high population states. probably go high first wave though. year two look back time laugh laugh... well, obviously us. recall grad school student living NYC prior return back China. got infected NYC. big carrot hurt someone really badly used improperly. like perfect tool behavior change. Walk quietly carry big carrot. That's brilliant. Ignorance, stupidity, selfishness. insane protests began May 26th. media protest supporters pushed pandemic background. Many Governors supported protesters. Combined reopening, gave younger people impression virus longer serious threat. telling kids spread viruses? way dude listen yourself!

We’re keeping prayers daily, terrifying. 💔 Enjoy downvotes People going friends drink party bit different people wearning masks protesting. doubt people hanging family friends, cooking out, playing pool, social distance wear mask. street definitely hospital floors among covid patients. choose stay outside hospital instead sharing bed patient. many laborers leaving cities going respective villages, deaths counted all.

Yeah, you’re downplaying bud. know mutates get right?  don’t test sheep, we’ll cases! Yes please. I’m CT lowest numbers country now. don’t want dumbasses Florida coming ruining worked hard for. It’s even worse realize US received highest grade

By who? Obviously asian countries much better prepared. hindsight also experience. Looks like NFL intent killing main source income like certain political party go nameless. Science facts, including Covid, don’t penetrate right wing ideology. Umm testing positive nucleic acids signify? Covid? first time since March 9, active cases 100 Fuck I’m getting it. I’m im CT know wear masks social distance.  alarmed. cares 1 person dying much less 25... Lol, analogy doesn’t even make sense. food 6 days? Wut India young non-obese population. ""It's killed 120 million people USA far.""
-Joe Biden “Young people die thing” lol delusional something? actually read studies quoted notice two things:

1. first studies consider whether wearing mask protects *wearer* infection. consider whether *infected* people wear mask might reduce risk others becoming infected.
2. rest studies compare N95 masks vs surgical masks without comparison non-masking. Knowing N95s effective surgical masks preventing infection prove masks ineffective general.

None studies listed actually consider scenario we're now, whether universal masking reduces risk spread Covid-19. I'd say VIC second wave. controlled way better USA ever did. Hotel isolation fuckups VIC would like NSW expect.

Waves days lot smaller faster due speed world works, like Spanish flu 1 wave year. *laughing nervously* 

Everything okay. Everything okay. Fuck country insane. Everything okay. One group wore masks. believe socially distanced. US far many cases professional contact tracing now, need education testing centers contact tracing yourself, teach people let everyone close know symptomatic/exposed, tell everyone isolate/test result positive, effectively turn every willing individual contact tracer. mean crowded place people laugh, talk, lose inhibitions want hang people pandemic? possibly problem. /s Thought rich people building apocalypse homes nuts. makes sense now. two days ago Trumpie Texas trying tell isn’t spike there.  Seriously dumb shit.  ya, wtf mean? restaurant closed?

it’s easy say platitudes paint average people morons, simple. Yea needs ban gyms. Nothing germs going around close crematoriums public whilst lockdown huge backlog ashes collected *all* people died time, COVID LA county getting 2k cases daily week one largest protest rallies Ah yes I'm sure immigrants loving Alabama this. testing much better NY before/during peak, that's consolation. Since spreading slower NYC (R(t) closer 1.5 3), also think peak bad. whole state is, cities/communities may suffer more.

But probably take longer resolve, since leadership/mitigation nowhere near strong. lower 1 R(t) is, faster - less mitigation go low NY. can’t imagine happening. think ca’s leadership wise enough keep border crossings tight leash done punching face US. realize you’re fucking piece shit moron supporting thousands people dying? could said tie shirt around face like mask help. Instead said FUCK MASKS. Fauci directly responsible thousands deaths. hope enjoys thought goes sleep. Yeah, work sometimes, it’s really social consensus parts PA COVID-19 isn’t hoax. mom goes support group family members addicts, publicly run, hasn’t attending none wear masks. always knew right wing conspiracy theorist stuff degree, they’re technically pretending lie health conditions - aren’t even that, they’re saying feel like don’t need masks (despite county 35% case increase past 2 weeks). It’s absolute bullshit, they’re incompetence trying set Zoom meetings combined total lack empathy (or judgement) means mom other, sane members group miss it. California higher population everything states. Despite always voting blue, state huge red population well.

In addition that, hard hit areas large Latino populations (shown vulnerable due living situation maybe communication). human transmission got sick fast opportunity, little opportunity, spread it. MERS bad design evolutionary standpoint virus caused it. started kids calling “The Boomer plague”. I’m convinced instead “The entitled ass hole plague”.

Its absolutely feeding America arrogance political combativeness. mean willingly put mass unemployment next cold virus discovered years? thanks Us redditors?

It’s sham. Living cold war must fun. They’re saying portrayed bad relation reporting test results. 15% positive 70k tests shows cases looks worse 15% positive 45k tests. cases already here... dont data show it. Vanilla Sings Dings!

Concretely, *single bit evidence* massive increase excess deaths people stressed losing jobs? Here, let help out: similar increase excess deaths 2008 recession? not? Everything think happen, happening now? Last four weeks case counts worldometer:

June 17 - 26,257 (25% higher)

June 24 - 38,434 (46% higher)

July  1 -  51,097 (33% higher)

I find numbers interesting, think important quantify last three weeks increase had. Crazy times. case obvious, percentage increase prior weeks number. go outside without mask. read article, specifies must wear mask outdoors public area unable maintain 6ft distance. media skewing hard making sound way strict is. Good one. you. assume splitting political parties virus political. I'm liberal.

It takes 18.5 days average die 7 days report deaths according CDC.

Wait... needed study tell us that? Well actually, 4 year olds definitely adults reason say ""well theyre 4, cant helped"" fact helped, called parenting. Letting child actively participate dangerous behaviors without attempt correction supervision could considered neglect abuse. Allowing bad behaviors go unchecked leads spoiled entitled adults. 4 year olds rambunctious others main thing person, child adult incapable understanding someone elses words understanding consequences, lack empathy. forget whole developmental process developing kids think time they're like preschool age started develop degree empathy (usually helped interacting children) start instilling rules boundaries kid like 4-6. kid learns people exist, arent main protagonist. actually serious personality issue child never realizes arent center universe. Naturally shouldnt forceful asshole it, since kids learn pace. really isnt much expect child hear listen. mean like dont kids, work kids (nursery 5th grade) middle school high school though. stories parents say fairly good listening (not didnt like totally break leg like 2 climbing crib, arm 4 slipped fell bench standing on). like saying wont get sound reasoning child kinda accurate. Kids fairly intelligent. Ive never understood people think kids incapable understanding things ages 3+ till they're like 7. Kids arent gonna perfect, naturally. doesnt mean cant told ""this dangerous XYZ"" cant expect actually listen. Toddlers get wild pattern need serious guidance. Tbh way sound seem like type wouldnt make toddler apologize store stole something, bc would reason wouldnt comprehend happening it'd worthless experience. Maybe I'll horrible mother viewpoints really dont/cant agree kids dont sound reasoning, interactions baby cousin toddler, phrased bit differently adult would. Kids cute like though.

2. Greatly increased testing capturing large number milder/asymptomatic cases went un-confirmed previously, portion sick people among new cases currently smaller.

3. Better treatment - report UK said probability death 1/4th April hospitalized patients, probably due better ventilation management, anti-coagulation anti-inflammation treatments.

My comment/question:

1. Zangmeister exclusively tested particle sizes SMALLER Jie Zhou reckoned infection capable. Sure, Zhou used Flu virons, SARS CoV-2 ones, two size inhalation transmitted.
2. Zangmesiter's study bashes *Konda et al 2020* some. sure Konda tested particle sizes range indicated Ferret/size study linked (Jie Zhou et al)
3. Zangmesiter's study contains ""SARS CoV-2"" seven times, anecdotally. Nothing study specific viron. Jie Zhou mention SARS CoV-2 despite published middle current pandemic.

That’s want see deaths vs year vs last total averages. broken cause see excess deaths category Makes sense cause article likely nonsense based 3rd hand info. Sounds like somewhere else. That's takes. medical authorities would bother looking outside box, particularly regard high levels vitamin D, epidemic would handled within 3 weeks. r/NobodyAsked family haven’t house except groceries 3 months. Despite quarantine easing up, know damage still isn’t done yet I’m surprised many people actually going “government says it’s okay now”.

Aren’t Canadians also receiving regular stimulus checks government worry returning work? I'm constantly reading news stories Americans taking COVID-19 seriously large gatherings parties place, I'd say that's also probably helping much. silenced political post lol wimps. Beleive world run systemic racists enforced corrupt police u law trust everything exact goverment says anything else. Checks out. Lt Governor, think. goes show people politics keep mouth shut pandemic let professionals talking.

Texas track completely obliterate New York’s COVID-19 record. I’m glad don’t live anymore. would scared shitless point. Aye know. still healthy person dying corona rare. covering face. patients receiving certain treatments, staff wear surgical masks. Anything covering mouth nose decrease rate transmission. lull around Memorial Day still low amount cases (comparably) social unrest didn’t, they? think combination many factors:

Italy many old people. See distribution age death.

Italy probably less tests, although verified yet regards California specifically.

We learned lot virus since then, new ways treat it.

With said, still clear long term consequences virus are. Sad, 21 years old. universities think safely students campus fall definitely need reconsider. trumpf say time celebrate virus defeated it!

don't believe fake niews media believe retweets fakebook

/s Tit tat sarcastic. lot fewer right six months ago, still incredibly old population. That’s happens people basic idea human body swept away conspiracies see social media. Suddenly people realize can’t breathe wearing mask it’s unconstitutional 🤦🏻‍♂️ fucking irony nuts. ones refuse masks ones screaming reopen calling people names etc. 

If let us stay quarantined instead pushing reopening early economy, adhered health guidelines could actually reopened got want faster. mess shockingly enough silent majority want go spend recover economy.

Like want way fuckers treat gonna drag fucking stupid 50,000+ cases one day folks still wanna refuse wear mask.

When over, hope it’s sooner later, cannot forgive purposefully dropped ball practicing basic sanitation practices. 

Also separate note, it’s wild see folks come shit protests. get argument backed sources, there’s LOT accounts seem come shit protesting, make comments subs mock folks take virus seriously. thousands protestors literally every day month NYC. spikes. Turns people wear masks helped. protestors wear masks, blaming spikes. Lying lying. lied thought benefit lying (keeping supplies first responders, etc), normal people lie. limited supplies.... give treatment 30 year old normally healthy person also small children works normally healthy better chance survival leading healthier life post recovery... give someone paralyzed since 2017 trach give treatment would still bed bound, still require airway, can’t care themselves, less likely chance full survival considering baseline unable anything himself... happens often, honesty, exactly trying avoid, lack resources leading deaths... guy already hospice care, people don’t know hospice means please stop commenting... wish people medical field would refrain commenting decisions heath care workers. presented situation two patients dying time, choose one best outcome. one quadriplegic 3 years lose 99% time. 

TLDR: right decision doctor, non healthcare people haven’t situation please stop talking, wear mask, stay home. smart go college, need remember tell pass test. Well basically strong arm people reopening business force people go work obviously gonna ""tremendous"" numbers. think thats partly point though. thinks going untenable admits really good place much worse start there. probably lot people people considered enough. Telling people make cloth masks wear admitting masks work.

If masks work, masks better filtration obviously better, people would still hoard masks medical professionals needed.

Even now, hospitals can't get amounts proper PPE need. wife first back March. stay home work wife working shit. Hey, let’s blame people wearing mask “cult”. Let’s blame mass protest going alllll. Jesus man. expect anything you. you. 

They're real life. Ok.

I watch TV Twitter. read news. news documentation/representation events real life right.

For fucking real ... We're less 100 cases/week here. Hell we've days new cases. Rural America fine. need worry big cities. could get president actually something think we'd fine overall. Yet dumb mother fucker basically silent. go hospital get sick. Instructions unclear. Proceeding kinds alcohol cancel out. someone Harrisburg- blue dot amongst sea red blue shores Pittsburgh Philly- please no!! That's bullshit. shitty decisions make life expect people forgive you.

You absolutely wrong going know COVID. Nobody gives shit want normal life. wearing masks Mexico? Right?! Like days really want award moming working teaching cooking working working cleaning fuck shit. It’s hard. stand you, keeping fighting good fight sis. #SpotTheAltRightIncel Almost everyone, including older folks, talk talked afraid even getting virus.

so fearless, brave Colorado nice hear. That's plan least. even COVID. true PA. Try another “muh rats” argument. gone exponential. We're rate 50,000 per week. Newsom needs shut entire state down. father pretty major surgery. They’re continuing go (though say they’re wearing masks). upset won’t go allow near granddaughter. tried staying info says “1/8th 1%! point love life”

My brain hurts trying deal it. Yeah really doable parents work home multiple days week. working home, sort help kids online school work. 

I'm MN numbers okay right now, hear school look like fall end July I'm betting it'll hybrid model. work school age care summer kids can't social distance reliability. 3-7 kids classroom even tiny number, telling move apart every couple minutes. I'm entertaining them, trying teach shit! infection Sweden OVER. began decline back April. burnt out. clearly read comment all. 

Sweden KNEW would deaths. clear. point risky Denmark likely vaccine arrive year one will. Denmark go hard lock suppress it. 

Like said unless virus naturally burns Oxford vaccine works Denmark terrible spot virus reemerge Denmark either go indefinite lockdown Sweden Denmark simply kicked road 6 months. 

Sweden done. over. 

Denmark basically pray Oxford's vaccine prove efficacy within next months. PA also actually enforce this. personal responsibility. seen stock market? Cha-ching!! I’m sorry hear that. worked small photo studio years 10 years ago. sweat ass every time we’d shoot can’t imagine trying mask. heart goes people work among big groups. forgot /s. /s means satire Haven’t everyone observed slow gradual leak seriousness disease? I’m afraid of, scientists race find cure vaccine slowly learning severity virus human body. understand trying cause panic slowly releasing virus affects body. 2020 fucking mad lad MURICA!!! taking seriously quarantining Yes. [Now new cases 

*Data Public Health England 14:41 BST 2 Jul 2020*. eyes constitution law. NYC law literally says gatherings 50 people. Nothing “no gatherings 50 people, unless you’re protesting. also, protestors still spreading coronavirus, many aren’t wearing masks. simply want laws applied Americans equally. depends live. live California. Unions state politicians. states ban unions 'right work' laws. There’s ton older people Naples building lot assisted living offense, friends shared pictures protests bragging people wore masks, neither 100% enough. coming place actually wears them, really stand out. Minneapolis memorial especially dozens maskless faces every picture...  


While think cause explosion, change fact really damned reckless. I’ve read plenty symptoms never seen “white spots throat.” first thought I’ve suddenly come done w strep? white spots throat soreness, symptoms. curious symptom folks had? Can't touch face blow hands off.

*Taps head stump*  headline wins r/coronavirus Whatever, “Latin America” then, get meant. allowed who? lol  Wait use Wikipedia college? scared this.  delusional fan-fiction right day coronavirus history,

lol Sure symptom, he's president. truly believe would 25% compliance president wore mask gotta admire commitment anything else... /s Plano? Well hello neighbor That's like, half Canada's total cases. That's lot. *confirmed* cases, include asymptomatic people get tested. sure difference is, wave wave country does. Please explain Hey guys know, texas hates too. Hes charges. Hes asshole. 

Right battle conservatism. extreme right would fall flat earth. push get rid Abbott succeeded would fool get probably throw mandatory nothing flu parties. 

Almost extreme conservative funded oil guy lost power influence 2000s. Yeah states Feb March . want sound wrong US general direction people getting big worry could see people also. restaurants shops open till mid March cases pretty high. 

In India slightly different , knew handle gets hand shutdown international travel time cases 600 went full lockdown time less 1000 cases. 

In India lockdown strict , would say strict European countries mentioned earlier virus got slums things started increasing flu cold common India people react early also testing low actual 1000 might way higher. 

Now India cases ever since increase , steady increase, doubling rate around 15 days , bad mainly restricted measured. 

Now unlock mode started also methodical ( paper) even 1% population adhere talking 13 million people happening. 1% error happened throughout also.
Now raised china like lockdown implemented something practical democratic country like India government funding sand power also it. 

We handling perfect. strongly believe certain aspects government good enough comparison richer countries like Europe population smaller , less dense also right comparison.

I personally got apartment since returned US late March . Even groceries delivery system gets required items safe protocol. working class afford work home even lockdown lifted. going restaurants eat malls shop majority population can't , go earn living. talking 800+ million people. peak coming only..I personally expecting peak India somewhere oct- Nov. cases would 200-250k per day i.e testing support it. 

The good aspect relatively young population maybe death rate might lower many countries hurt us sure.. Yes, ironic it? Every nordic country said varient 'we're risk big 2nd wave, we'll see small cluster outbreaks contain' Sweden talking big second wave. Tegnell warned recently. lot people died. post? great. 

I wish way reward people diligent social distance quarantine, easy access vaccines. Kills think asshole refused wear masks constantly went would equal privilege vaccine. feel you. I’m single parent five year old - school cancelled since March, summer camps cancelled. work home job demanding phone-based, poor kid get basically attention day. multiple immunocompromised people direct circle, none really provide childcare, I’m basically stuck half-assing working no-assing parenting literally end sight (and play dates allowed either).  hoping things would get better fall, idea kindergarten even happening.

It’s awful. I’ve considered quitting well-paying job get kind break able give poor kiddo attention deserves. seems insane it’s potentially come but...here are.  you’re old enough blame parents way are, 100% responsibility fix. people friends. It’s hard understand. excuse people age. filth point. millennial here, boomer ass parents generation pushing back masks mostly ironic. may end herd disability instead herd doubt they'll reach that. Maybe really tried to. much like immunity, aren't. Thank god that!  I'll never forgive bowing low Japanese Prime Minister. feel much I’m Hernando county it’s bad go inspection Tampa/St Petersburg man tell 1 every 10 people following recommendations, going peoples homes work gives feeling unease. ran 20 inspections last 2 weeks one homeowner wearing mask people house it’s really sad. know areas nearly bad south us eventually going see areas get close bad south FL. Swag I'm excited see people doomsday prepers actually use doomsday shelters. Maybe add big brother esque drama might academy award winning flick course number cases relevant, number indicative much problem virus per region. 

2.5 million cases nearly 120,000 deaths over-hyped you? needs happen personally wake realize COVID-19 significant problem? Literally valid. nation wide one minded attention span can't seem grasp important topics common adverse effects studies remdesivir COVID‑19 include respiratory failure organ Symptoms may appear 2-14 days exposure virus. People symptoms may Shortness breath difficulty breathing



Well, shit. No? Trying see good 63+ million right-leaning mouth breathing pieces shit pretty centrist me.

I'll take called wrong another one. ""diligently followed best practices CDC recommendations.""

Im fuckin sick people saying this. putting people together inside area, FOLLOWING BEST PRACTICES. Yeah, he’s knees. fucked C19 knows it, last thing need get complacent give up. patient vote! begun 63 million what? I'm sorry post snark. There's much argument reply know expect say. 

But since see state American intelligence badly 'house fire' think agree. understand opinion go TV social media, important remember news feeds carry massive survivorship bias. Twitter reddit real life. imply trends statistical reality. slippery slope...though kind feel way. Anyway imagine healthcare first responders, military , govt employees rich get first.

the us military 1.4 million people

health care.. 2017 estimate 16.7 million workers

 fed govt 2 6 million depending count the

So lot vaccinne dosages right there,

Then maybe risk elderly etc. essential workers.  Protesting dangerous business. Wow. really sorry happened you. waiting break... way get Americans wear damn mask they? 12-18 months March 2020 seems like commonly cited time line I’ve seen  Great, way spread virus. real. He's vocal advocate increasing pandemic response plan decade. He's another billionaire. Gates one I've seen life take strides improvement future America. waiting pitfalls buy property pennies get even wealthy economy strengthens back up. He's part make sure people shelter home. Ok, Swedish site present facts figures. 

NEXT! wave ripples ocean meets shore. then, rise fall depending conditions.

This wave still sweeping across US. south/southwest part first wave, initially New York New Jersey. want anything, simply nothing left do. Intubation last resort, that's ruled best move onto palliative care ease suffering. unprecedented situation, even make plan build model unprecedented situation world seen recent years? Pox parties ensure children got mild form virus controlled conditions. like... plague party think fixing systemic racism getting s***-faced two different goals. would hope would able read one worth supporting one not. Fuck shit. constitution go away virus 0.5% death rate. saying world pretty disingenuous given comments World Health Organization announced asymptomatic spread possible week.

You know darn well guys go parties COVID-19 date says. Everyone told wear masks quarantine. guy people died it. make excuses guy. neither. They're starting see lasting lung damage even relatively mild cases. someone worked frontlines SARS also two pulmonary embolism hospitalizations past two years (and I'm old), let say worth it. risks high idea much benefit immunity gained. 

Catching purpose terrible idea. Absolutely. Leading example part responsibilities fucking President, he’s making catastrophic mistake he’s doing. 

Even stupider, missed opportunity sell red branded face masks something like “MAGA” base would eat up. run election, makes nothing sense course didn’t it. failure set example huge part many obstinately refusing wear mask, he’s going blood hands said done. Fetch breastplate stretcher! ^^^right  Haha. kid RN job secure. Ignore coworker kid ill covid... Curious bc get tested, swab feel like? took seriously get go heard reports lasting damage lungs lost someone COPD I'm almost militant it. weeks think I'll wearing mask around house. Relatives Florida places coming visit 90 year old. goes bad I'm gonna bring every word say involved. could arrive anytime old fucker thinks lunch time. Lol. we’ve reached herd immunity disease spreading higher rate? load big brain bullshit. Stop using words don’t understand. really. 

You making huge assumption fear going outside. 

Experts agree waving metal rod lighting storm may get struck rare case, that, take shelter storm gets closer. immediate threat gone, go business...Never afraid getting struck, yet minimizing risk exposure.  Absolutely awful. God bless could take longer two weeks \`cause people stay ventilator awhile expire. strange worse ever yet vast amount people act though Covid-19 even real thing. disturbing. widespread victim blaming I’ve ever seen. 

Entire generations Americans made adulthood defunded education systems, think it’s coincidence people ever make “individual choice” ignorant? There's hiring anybody schools next year, least California. Ca, budgets frozen state--based last year's attendance, even less money local revenue. public school going operate $450k less year last year. going fewer teachers next year, more. Asymptomatic still roughly viral load infected, difference showing symptoms coughing sneezing like sick person. still spread talking touching faces contaminating surfaces hands. Anything transport water droplets still infectious clearly sick person. Agreed. I'd get cold four times year got extra 8k year it! work part though? food gets cooked sell nobody makes mess eating restaurant.  kill hundreds mink Norway become infected. really weird virus. Yeah, exactly hard find articles showing Norway major staff shortage healthcare. Four words Google get plenty. 

Norway, healthcare, workers, shortage. potentially 2,000 deaths day Maybe, mean least family at, big city either. Wife baby Apr 27. last day work Apr 15. maternity leave app still processing. money comes overtime that's gone. saved tax return, almost 6k got $3400 relief check would screwed right now. still job 40 hours, thankfully. Can't imagine like people still waiting money, unemployment, kids. tend agree, also know media forces actively trying downplay virus. face competing messages (and lack discernment trusted), it’s necessarily unreasonable people look local governments guidance what’s safe. That’s say government failing us – far many places basing decisions factors public safety. lot restaurant owners threat threat profits. happily send people back front lines collecting money safety homes. sounds great yes, bought rare plants seeds Etsy myself! President decided make so. Thank god countries like Denmark, Finland &amp; Norway saved image Scandinavia.  

Keep mind that, unlike Sweden, countries extreme superiority complex terms much good boy international level. PR image matters Swedes, rest well sake well president people say work. people wrapped entire identity around strongly never admit wrong. ‘Murcia! county Sherriff joined “selective enforcement muh rights” club. Hopefully, city police department doesn’t follow. witnessing Herd Impunity even remotely clear since April cases increasing daily increase cases par smaller US states opened early, like Carolinas point track unmitigated disaster. evident live post-truth era people like make claims support obviously flawed arguments. feel way make true. doctor make right call? Yes. understand triage necessary.

Did doctor good job building trust medical professionals member public? No. boyfriend going die COVID doctor told going happen, I’d far less trust medical professionals would going in. ""We're sorry ma'am. son severely constipated. choked death could perform enema.""  Every country world accepted virus NOWHERE near deadly predicted, left NEVER admit that, hence push testing. We're testing people symptoms, hell, we're testing people sake testing point part pathetic leftist political agenda. countries stiff armed testing population rate us, would similar statistics too. every country realized virus kills less flu, scaled back testing completely unecessery (should start testing everyone flu every flu season onset symptoms whatsoever anything, contact flu carrier? HELL NO). left finally admit petty accept America made choice 2016.

Also, viral loads way down, even people testing positive literally risk anymore. Facts data filtered politics that's massive mistake cost lives. hate guy wearing mask isn’t “all do.” Wash hands stay away others couple things done. Even case masks, see many people wearing fabrics face. STOP AIR MOLECULES TRAVELING ALL!!! know bunch NYTime writers. hang NYC elite, probably find working class person interview. Usually interview friends friends types articles. evidence far states otherwise. Swedish model based assumptions, science. employee multiple employees infected spreading everyone right? way many people exposed one customer one night. welcome! glad others find interesting. :) ignore fines. technically middle ""flatten curve"" strategy? something change? *rages Jersey*

Seriously b NY done good job,but NJ done much better (last checked NJ RI seeing number new cases go down) Cuomo loudmouth (who savior pandemic telling NYC close schools) ""New Yowk"" everyonejacks thenof amazing. reminds movie...  29 Oklahoma, able buy nice house 1500sq ft(1800 now) good part town 82k couple years ago. wife able stay home mother two kids live comfortably 60k income, that's putting 1k retirement month well.

Though mostly nerds. recently converted garage gaming / anime room. hobbies outdoors, Oklahoma works great us. understand everyone, everyone going able find good work theres less available. Oh fuck getting pregnant. people kids Obama’s prosperous presidency forced give livelihood rich people continue managing empire via zoom. want us go back too! Good thing mandatory masks! Oh wait schools exempt mask rule hundreds thousands kids packed building almost 8 hours day everyday perfect way spread... fucking point lockdown lock people are. given notice days think would happened? People would panic would start going homes spreading disease infrastructure place. talk shit things know understand sure, mostly children idiot boomers. would guessed passed stupidity... #hoax #freedom #mychoice That's still worse 1982. Worst recession since great depression. least moving good direction    Come on. people fighting encourage mask wearing / social distancing largely giving pass protesters (if outright endorsing them) protesters far biggest culprits whole fiasco.

What moron. protests leading spikes NYC would fucked. cases hospitalizations keep falling. case? Great comment. people already supply shirts. Canada building border wall, US going pay it. people made bad decisions present exacerbate outbreaks example failure. countries staved outbreaks maintained strong economy successfully locked institute contact tracing examples failure... fail later.

Nice alternate reality you’ve constructed objective policy consequence policy judged future you’ve decided inevitable... evidence. Got it. whole point excess deaths measurement comparing place itself, control variables. That's people use it. Remember people falling streets screaming agony windows. see that? teacher wonder thing. Everyone’s answer always “camp” work privileged kids. don’t even get regular meals, much less camp. think lot taken care grandparents aunts uncles.  still reddit lol figures Swedish. quite possible majority critical Swedes foreign born. 

Yeah, I'd heard Swedish arrogance *mostly* joking thing sometimes Danes Finns esp. real irritation. never took seriously episode. 

[This video Swedish eye opening me. really tied lot things I'd heard / experienced together. 

Well, hopefully silver lining debacle Swedes generally become bit humble... tbh hold breath given incredible arrogance that's display. whole culture narcissistic? Seems like it, complete shrill, irrational bleating criticism causes indicative narcissistic injury. confusing different things. 

One:

Medical supplies deliberately kept first line healthcare facilities U.S. federal administration.

Two:

This experts coming television March April stating public enough scientific evidence conclusively assert masks - cloth otherwise- offer additional protection wearer.

Medical equipment, disposable surgical masks, short supply supply chains adapted cope sudden massive global demand. Experts state general public refrain using N95 masks urgently healthcare workers.

Prove conclusively - evidence - one two tie scientific experts ""lied"" communication public media. right stop
Covid-19 hear one listening

Light immune system die like chump. media loves give coverage like represent half population everyone thinks country full nutjobs.

It's really like 20% nutjobs think normal. we're using that, thing work I'm amazed doctor know better. Welp, new day new record.

Within weeks reopen we'll see new outbreaks pretty much every major city. find sad idea ""saving economy"" required opening up, economy can't function pandemic even shit open! Jeez ridiculously stuck employer? regular webex meetings clients random barks kids don’t make instantly disown us. Like children. think wonderfully horrible misogynist Poles? know cases increase available testing, positive-case percentage low - you’re testing people, certain amount people test positive.
 
Whereas places like Arizona, Texas, Florida, positive-test count skyrocketing. spikes due increased testing, rather increased spread. 1200 cases day? UK sighing relief promoting pubs Saturday little Britain independence day!
Boris wants Trump every way How?

With testing? PPE?

You’re forgetting hard New York hit back March. weren’t nearly enough tests first responders let alone thousands people nursing homes. 

By time you’d test everyone everyone would already it. 

I get it’s sucks. friend lost dad nursing home Connecticut. it’s like many great options table.  Remember idiots CDC published information Asymptomatic cases spread virus? immediately retracted it, people still pass shit around?

That's big part now. Thanks, assholes. parent’s neighbors it. parents quarantined 95 year old grandma. neighbors think caught church. Also Florida. work closed someone tested positive. haven’t working since March. Apart condition suddenly worsens around day 10-11 get ventilated. need check numbers. exclusion zone 2600km2, smallest state(rhode island) 2678km2 Maybe help ... engaged replied That's bullshit 

You keep trying make case something I'm telling think bullshit. get it, dont faith people masks. Big deal, wrong think people stupid. 

I've already told think people discount others. social spread infection longer traced, strategy testing tracking effective, according [Anders KI [professor Anders , among . 

\- still societal spread volume today, 2,000 new cases week, difficult infection tracking import cases beginning, says Per Follin.

In March, Smittskydd Stockholm played central role actively infecting people visited high-risk areas. according Per Follin, virus may entered Sweden via people countries Italy, China, South Korea Iran. 

\- retrospect, learned Austria many cases many travelers French Austrian Alps. focus northern Italy. also talk earlier spread England United States.

**Did track people Austria?**

\- No, part case definition time.

Svenska Dagbladet reported [many taxi drivers drove home travelers Arlanda fell ill . never infected.

\- discussion, infection tracking.

**Should done that?**

\- found cases, important find got symptoms, taxi driver considered infected.

Per Follin worked 20 years clinical infectious doctor, became infectious surgeon 2008. First Västra Götaland, last four years Stockholm region. Corona pandemic arguably intense period professional life, says.

\- strenuous hectic period. also exciting dynamic period. probably never unpredictable virus terms spread.

 world's media paid attention Sweden's corona strategy. reporting positive decision never shut society, others critical high death rates. Sweden five times many deaths rest Nordic countries combined 

Per Follin believes Sweden chosen good path.

\- think communities chosen severe restrictions hard time keeping infection away longer term. comes sooner earlier.

However, work protecting elderly worked hoped.

\- fact received distribution elderly housing setback.

**Could done something different?**

\- easy look back, aware happening SÄBO business could active earlier phase, would wished been.

**How think pandemic develop?**

\- hard say. think pandemic last. seen end event yet, hope return normal business soon. may certainly waves, occur difficult predict.

(end part 2 article) could, know, *lead* country lie virus going away magically? Wear damn mask? Tell people need pull together country tough time? Improve healthcare instead trying take away millions people need ever? Care people statues?

People like part problem we're facing. small-minded. know, almost adorable way. Awww, pet trolls. They're consistent almost like clockwork. Sorry using flair Latin America, flair ""World"" getting applied, flair named ""North America"". Please concentrate news, flair pick order post news. got joke. 10 beers, 729 days, $30 later.... sort understand resentment post. 

I’m dead serious tho, borders need stay closed... even northern states much better, hope guys northern states keep southern Folks well. 

They don’t seem give shit both. Still do.

Edit: even switched jobs middle pandemic couple months baby. article garbage. Lol  9 

9 

9!!!!!!!!!!!! surprise. always, rules apply them. Assholes. actually massively huge news Dipshit chief sure talked putin quite bit beginning outbreak. hard discern someone bumbling response outright trying make worse. Man oh man... beginning calling kill million people... think great. Lol.

How know many people actually died covid? know people financially incentivized write death certificates percent occurred? I’m out. country joke. Anyone half brain

Ah see met average American yet Honestly point accept fate let spread. wasting way much resources community simply give fuck.  *justfloridathings* ""Grandma, Lt. Governor Texas said need die enjoy freedom!""

*sobs* ""Oh sweetie! I'd known important freedoms you, would died years ago!"" Jesus... Soon enough, guy gonna snap lash ""Hey fucktards! love grandmother you? act accordingly"".

Should done couple months ago. he's pissing wind. Florida Florida Man states. r/news rarely allows C-19 related posts. kinda get why, think big news. lol ""roars back"", that's restaurant service industry people getting job back, soon work again. Hardly roaring, maybe whimper. Pathetic title reuters.  Yeah, point NYC heavily skews almost every population stat NY state. like 4 room house 10 feet water 1 room 1 foot water three saying room 3 foot water level.

Florida consistently dense across lot state lot state connected along major highway runs Miami. gonna continue spreading like mad. No. He’s saying work together. way open economy follow public health measures. aren’t opposite forces. I’m worried people associating masks getting virus. 

The level incompetence play America telling. entire generations people unable think critically anything. 

They parrot talking head saw tv believe informed.  Deaths lagging metric cases, death rates likely rise week so. one freakin planet pushing herd immunity probably even heard term prior Coronavirus. hitting herd immunity quickly / ever conventional means, ESPECIALLY easy virus spreads. Roll Tide. Roll virus. Maybe need “nanny” since whole thing made evidently clear majority people act like children: selfish, entitled, sense real life consequences. what?

Any new empirical evidence prove disprove claim? Sounds like covid sausage party. point inject everyone it. strong survive. I’m updated coronavirus news. Hbu? even test more, death rate change. That's I'm saying. point numbers numbers? testing more, death rate lower, we'd seeing death rate drop. not. assumption. Locking everyone stop spread fine. would done opened back slowly everyone board masks, social distancing prioritizing movement also adequate testing ppe, would waves lot places. 

By letting lot different people decide different things massive infighting it, testing still great place, mostly wasted everyone's time killed lot people necessary. Dense ""this dense motherfucker""? yes. fatality rates also dropped like brick. young people general, young, good looking women, notice them, guess look young attracrive girls lol. death may wakeup call everyone needs? least pic induced coma? can't blindly link every excess death COVID directly, certainly excess deaths people getting help sadly. cracked up, 9 year old week I'm like can't nothing watch youtube video's day. ""earns"" youtube time reading, artwork, physical activities etc.

I let stay jammies, make change every 24 hours.

I never thought standards would reduced changing clothes every 24 hours getting least 5 minutes sunlight solar noon, are. Well shit going Vegas, baby!..... staying! He's right everything else far. stable genius Yeah 50,000 positive 70,000 tests means way, way actual cases confirmed cases. Even 20% considered high, 10% pretty good. week ago reported 33k tests reliable. [Article knows going Florida.... Test every athlete support staff days game reliable test, rapid test everyone game day, use precautions travelling, entirely possible. Hey, record cloth masks work fine! N95 catchphrase caught start hard get, expensive, much efficient regular ones. They're still shortage everyone get hands them, *should* left frontline workers :). 

Cloth masks found catch droplets fine, long they're double layered.  American gave upvote. backwards nation world. guess Trump meant winning. summarized this. vice racist now???

Watch video allowed comment here? Cool! 

I’m willing bet 95% accounts sub aren’t real. Probably accounts turf r/politics reality actual cases around 10x higher based antibody testing. around 7% worst guess? best lot people beat without producing antibodies could 10%? entire population September rate. mean...  infection peaks 2 weeks behind test results.  

And deaths 2+ weeks behind infections. 

Time tighten seatbelt, summer going bumpy ride. Arkansans allowed request absentee ballots due coronavirus concerns. good. They'll paid either way (just slightly less). guys rich enough extra million dont matter much youd think. Bro test less less cases. It’s simple science bro Well, guidelines still anyone who's infected must self-isolate. There's biological evidence virus weakening. drop deaths almost certainly driven access care. March swamped bad case immediate danger sent home, get admitted. combination receiving better care average hospitalized case almost certainly milder. China also sent people quietly strip Canadian stores distributors masks. I'm hoping wider culture shift wake this. Particularly personal health concerned number Florida lol.

And makes psycho reading post history determine a.) Full shit b.) utterly wrong predictions continued pandemic led c.) Attacking legitimate reasons gather OUTSIDE wearing MASK promote interaction INSIDE buildings recirculated air like bat shit crazy person beginning experience end cognitive dissonance denial. :) matter, medical professionals trying make silly pedantic argument masses instead leaning public terminology saying ""The Second Wave here, y'all better careful"". Yeah think there'd rule sub that, appears isn't. 

I reported misinformation since we've come long way mask front since then. 

Here's recent article studies included PDF format. beginning chinas totally number 80k(ish)... we’re inching towards day. It’s unbelievable. Winter least prevent people going fucking beaches. Morally wrong answer, yeah, factually correct answer. Schools **are** starting back up. think important keep mind 50,298 *confirmed* cases. Testing per capita increased lot recently better testing atleast partly amount cases increased now. disagree sentiment, 817 dead district

I thought sounded high.... got accompanying article, probably misread sentence. hospitals still people die reporting weekend? mean die weekend get lumped Monday's numbers instead? 

There seem large spike Monday number make non reporting Saturday Sunday, would Sat/Sun death none? hospitalizations going up?

Florida twisting numbers, like they've twisted overall deaths coronavirus far. So, problems March still now, people acting likr pandemic over...  they'll go smaller town hospital capacity handle surge cases. Yes, works governor’s office. Put “Died cold” headstone Fucking ooooooooh..... gets  really hope we're mess WWE Nah rich tend incredible class solidarity. they're winning California Florida included others though. He's one said 80%, he's paradox unreliability we're supposed decipher falsehoods, yet he's top expert. Nomad going explode try use logic it. governor lieutenant governor Texas separately elected, case two don’t seem like much.

Abbott wasn’t one said seniors sacrifice themselves. Could share using please?  I've thought back March, worth it. First, avoid indefinitely work home. 

Second, think hospitals get overwhelmed. Even NY hospitals get overwhelmed (individual hospitals did, state level system enough capacity). idea dealing back then, thinking dozens cases beginning March, tens thousands. 

Now though, see outbreak coming mile away testing capacity exists. numbers look scary now, keep mind reporting 30k cases day back day real number probably closer 300k. NY/NJ reporting 50% positive rates testing. report 50k today actual number likely much lower 300k enough tests test anybody feels like it. National positive rate 10%, even hotspot states around 20%, places rolling back reopenings already. Remember people stupid, stupid. loosen shutdown fatigue, get scared see headlines saying might die ICUs filling start wearing masks staying home. self-moderating system. Please tell seriously suggesting this. Things obviously bad. wonder many Texans wear one??  maybe stay 750 deaths per million! 🥇 Stonks go up. Remember well. /r/Wallstreetbets never learned.

Economy great? Stonks go up.

Economy shit? Stimulus. Stonks go up.  Yeah. try prevent deaths everyone eventually die anyway.. 











/s case get  wouldn’t say left starting gate, first case long long time ago. agree judge it’s said done. think people highly critical Florida premature since, I’m moment, they’re outperforming countries folks critical. Dude, person moved Texas year ago—people don’t listen here. 

No one wears mask even hospitals reporting surges. I’m cooking, working home avoiding contact costs. hell wrong them? travel lot I'm signed embassy alerts number countries. entire State Department recommending Americans basically continue guard _follow rules_. Every county world right rules. go party?

This another example US failure leadership. complete insanity.

Edit: get wrong. want grab beer, burger, celebrate 4th too. Lt. Governor, Dan Patrick. fair, Abbot, person says Costello(also goes name Dan Patrick) dare besmirch HUEFNURF egg slicer. Summer bad too. Hurricane season, fire season. feel like they're taking baby steps toward locking again. kind stuff helps going stop virus. happening Minnesota?  think pretty clear run twitter considering account tweeting party line garbage minutes going hospital. think there’s sub dedicated people confusing Liberian US flag lol disagree. information people heads buried sand otherwise paying attention, see. People shouldn’t dogs Yeah. really doubt many new jobs *better* lost, least. can't wait first freedumb party member file lawsuit. Yes cops assholes try mess people consequence people would wear masks everywhere. what? schools kindergardens havent big spreaders anywhere... 9-9-9-19 takes years consequences economic collapse manifest. Therefore can't know consequences one. look historical examples -- spoiler alert -- ain't pretty. There's reason Weimar Republic succeeded Third Reich. Depends are, age 40-45 risk death hospitalization virtually zero matter what.  Except high school students ready level independence, either. missed opportunity sell red branded face masks something like “MAGA”

YES! frustrating, golden opportunity profit natural disaster let slip fingers apparently he's even stupid pig headed greedy corrupt.   50,000 new cases per day

Growth rate 5% per day

After 200 days:


1,101,323,289 cases.

Exponential growth fun! That’s move right direction. enforced. unaware took precautions honest.thanks sharing pertinent information civil manner  did. People choose believe/care. Yep... think many people skipping skin cancer screenings, name one example something kills lot people every year. didn’t even think meant get ill. People’s businesses failing anyone made like $50k isn’t getting anywhere near normal pay even extra $600. 

Plus people laid off, furloughed, etc., don’t health insurance anymore get sick, may even worse orders need actually enforced. PA required masks businesses months now, enforcement, mask use super low.  Also, state income tax means state goes broke without tourist dollars. media nothing report virus spread, things going world regarding it, like covering daily briefings white house over, despite us hitting record spread. know say media politicized virus unless think existence virus political. US behind testing per capita compared lots countries higher rate positive tests per tests completed. shows infection spreading US countries. Maybe pushed shields compliance would higher. much comfortable masks. cases growing since June 1st deaths stayed stable? wonder is? 

And bring whole 2 week thing true cases started growing since little June lot 2 weeks. legitimately re-open Disney murder booths entrance Euthanize people. 

Eugenics get really bad look, historically, done like voluntary basis would work first saw show, wondered hell someone could deny smoking hole &amp; Cherenkov radiation open core. 

I don’t wonder anymore. Funny coincidence there's significant overlap states experiencing surge? think old Greg Proops joke Britain happy send citizens new world America wearing belt buckles hats. Exponential death Looks like decent chance exceeding 651 deaths week ago. It’s 20% positive rate pandemic means virus control continues spread. better question many asymptomatically currently spreading others eventually get tested go hospital die. number snapshot time shows badly AZ terms public policy personal responsibility. ""professionalism"" important aspect read letter attorney quoted entirety? good.  seems much likely got rally started symptoms 2 weeks later. response related covid-19 related themselves. think so, theyre getting tested quarantined enter bubble Go away, gamergate griefer. Victim blaming really good thing doing. estimate common sense average American declined much last 6 months I'll take one face value.

That happened elected Trump me. Oh really? happened governor’s office statement important things living? senior citizens sacrifice themselves?

I guess stupidity blew faces. \#JustLibRightThings infectious potent getting worse. top number daily cases NYC peak?  Ohio Play shitty games, win shitty prizes. highschoolers? missing something? specifically said daycare elementary that's referring to. know spread highschools teenagers.   US somewhere 20 40 million infected date, 6 12 percent population, herd immunity depends 70% immune. would need hit 231 million, additional 191 million 211 million infections. 

We 211 days end January. would need add 905,000 1,000,000 new infections per day January 31. assumes immunity SARS-COV-2 long lasting.

Get busy everyone! /s Governor Greg Abbott today issued Executive Order requiring Texans wear face covering nose mouth public spaces counties 20 positive COVID-19 cases, exceptions. Governor also issued proclamation giving mayors county judges ability impose restrictions outdoor gatherings 10 people, making mandatory that, certain exceptions, people cannot groups larger ten must maintain six feet social distancing others. possible death rates lower wave cases younger people steroids doctors starting use work (some may reduce deaths 30% go ventilators). still, number still excess preventable, know takes weeks rise deaths follow rise cases. We’ve seen play everywhere past several months. Today's number came 10k LESS tests prevous day.  many total tests? numbers somewhat meaningless without context. wise underestimate Florida man's power. love it’s bars parties spreading virus according sub. try say protests causing covid spread, people make dumb excuses like “bUt WeArInG mAsKs” “RaCiSm hEaLtH iSsUe.” come consensus mass gathering spreads covid? got email landlord reminding residents ""no fireworks premises"" rule lease, asking stay safe weekend. Already, I've seen heard groups people setting premature fireworks outside window (as per usual, every year.) worth mentioning that, week ago, everyone notified there's least one positive-testing person living here.

I've always felt live generally mature respectful city, insubordinates anywhere go (in US, anyway.) hope July 4th bring many types together en masse. mean, course that's going happen... Maybe say, hope try get another fist one already hurts enough is. **I saw chart indicating US one lowest mortality rates world. course, see MSM would reinforce well Tr.ump handled pandemic.**

**Here's 6/25 link referencing CSSE, Johns Hopkins Yeah insane. Cases going continue increase, hospitals overrun dramatically, going stop extreme measures. extreme measures imposed, wait 3-4 weeks effect noticed.

Remember, numbers week ago, since testing results take long process. 

I 100% believe one worst events past century US. new cases two weeks ago, long take get results, ie, positive tests administrated? Oh man, great /r/agedlikemilk material idiot Looks like Undertaker right business *safely* MD friend ground rounds hospital least 3 patients showed positive COVID admitted lied intake symptoms. it’s see articles like Eurocentrism, idea Europe enlightened continent isn’t new hasn’t played well past Ah ok. I'm also HEZ start 10 days you. Hah...lots folks *not* social distancing, seems like..... like that, suddenly disappear! Can’t wait day. Hell, saw hill like “How hell supposed drive that?” Move Florida six degrees south? call blowjobs, you. Time open FEMA camps. fucking idiotically American phrasing? SHATTERS RECORDS know price getting vaccine. Still open talk closing again. Makes sense given sparsity medical care there. See, I’m fan Florida mean, people want get sick, freak out. think going half million.  Absolutely shafted California almost double population? day equivalent would around 19k day match Well maybe slowed testing, would fewer cases! Seasonal flu vaccines 40 - 60% effective part variable number flu strains circulating season flu vaccine always matched well ends actually spreading. Florida man never fails deliver. Thx brief sudden exhale nose chance. doubled stock market important people. can’t back now. let run it’s course say, “see dealt still kept economy going.” piles bodies covered tarps.  scariest part today's number came 10k less tests previous day. monthly events different parks for, mainly adults go drink overeat gormet foods. There's YouTubers cover it. Y'all laughed said season likely happen. I'm likely right every day.

When start work together going worse florida’s used that, already 2001  Guys worry blown proportion. Less 1% US population even less die. /s article decent summary direct references primary studies first [study] found mask mandates led slowdown daily COVID-19 growth rate, became apparent time. first five days mandate, daily growth rate slowed 0.9 percentage-points compared five days prior mandate; three weeks, daily growth rate slowed 2 percentage-points.

And exact publication numbers actually gone Mt Tabor, actually technically mountain hill used volcano (even pathetic 640' ), would give pass. would also town anymore.

They went couple neighborhood streets found random corner view wanted know mountain called. closer restaurant going meet thought massive altitudinal adventure. answer look for, thank anyway tired I’m seriously concerned long term implications young people, studies seem indicate might long term lung damage younger adults, early know. Dying isn’t issue worry about. Yeah, I'm idiot look time posted. lol Disregard!  Lol phase 3 without even publishing phase 2 study. ^ Best possible response That's good news. main concern exploding areas, bounce back end summer early fall start packing back indoors. still first wave US overall, second wave Northeast states things temporarily control. insane. Michigan people able get tested possible exposure local bar, even without symptoms. results 24 hours. WTF Florida Florida tremendously flat. highest point 105 meters sea level.

\**Laughs Dutch*\* 
 
Yes, let sink second... yet ex. thing struggle grasp too.

There's part says herd immunity closer thought. I'm reminded Lazio, ie Rome, saw barely cases ticking time bomb.

There's whole conflict hard hit places seem okay, why? frustratingly, antibody tests giving much confidence, actual second wave would answer questions obviously anyone wants see. feel slight missing piece though, really understanding Europe much better general, diverse set nations. Direct link:  Yeah, America 330 million people. EU 550 million people. Maybe should....shut wrestle? Let's give everyone travel voucher tax credit sides!

::wipes tears:: oh man. good one... post stats Sweden Mouse prefers loyalty paid blood  really sounds like preemptive attempt shifting blame unto younger people failings tbh. grilling golf important piece, especially ""if scared, stay home"" crowd. workplaces reopen require us in-person instead remote, choice stay home. warned months socially distance went party. sympathy type shit all. like user name. bacteria generally degrade cold weather, viruses generally warm weather?

Or bacteria evenly split degrading warm weather degrading cold weather? Nice handle. Also: r/antinatalism. Yup time people left houses FL since March protests. There's like, entire society going business usual day every day months anything. used think conspiracy theories fun. Aliens, big foot, ect... turned misinformation weapon political gain; deep State, Reddit far left conspiracy, ect. Golf might OK. Seems far least Welp, even states strict lockdowns, required masks, slowly reopened seeing spikes, really discouraging 3 months life went nothing, forced stay indoors PA, almost back 1000. Honestly dont care anymore. one scary things asymptomatic people antibodies gone months early studies. Unless future larger studies disprove i'm optomistic asymtompatics enough immunity 'safe'. Hopefully i'm wrong wrong wrong. tag 2020, we'll know. much winning... must really really ignorant can’t tell difference two.

Edit: Ah, didn’t notice they’re different flags. case get answer, I'd like tack follow-up question: ICU practically synonymous ""on respirator?"" ask see statistics track ICU mortality, also ventilator mortality, wonder they're talking set patients. He's terrible job. He's bad communicator zero backbone. JH Damnit Yea, Miami Broward hunkered got hit like every major city US re-entered lockdown. Two outbreaks happened Miami. What's happening before, Miami really cases Florida.

Now, spreading rapidly across metros third, sometimes second largest state country. No, society ask stay fuck home. Thanks putting people risk, including nurses take care family. Florida magical place...

Even operating Florida, also surge cases. getting slammed bookings. Someone called liar day able source claims blogs travel agent pages, Disney isn’t officially releasing numbers don’t to. Tons travel blogs Disney specific blogs reporting almost completely booked end year. Travel agents reporting hours hours wait times get barely rooms available. reduced capacity, sold doesn’t mean sold last year time, appears available snapped fast. firmly believe country taken pandemic seriously, could sports back. Now, they’re going try hardest push sports $$$$ expect epic disaster. enforce quarantine though, forces people plane flight state. way truly enforce quarantine scale. can't lock everyone house/hotel prevent going store. honor system. RIP USA possible, inevitable. federal government shown either incompetent care enough stop this. probably both. states best can, strong weakest link. absolute best case see happening removing moron chief, hopefully gaining least 3 senate seats, giving new regime 6 months begin undo harm inflicted. puts us year away relief, that's probably even realistic. think really depends. kids pick easy books, current reading level, books fun. books without advanced vocabulary concepts advance learning. balancing act. 

Anyway, kids read lots books want school! torturous give homework, especially eschewing formal schooling. thought 14 days timeline display symptoms yet still spread virus? I’m mostly confused probably AC unit closed ventilation system. suppose there's chance could building central air...but would unusual. easy enough find out. Wednesday, 1 July. WoM showing today's (incomplete) numbers Thursday, 2 July.  think stock market indicator not-seriously Americans taking this. keeps going like nothing wrong. He's secretly hoping quick reunion Undertaker. Assholes fight right assholes, part identity. I'm tied every fucking decision world based money. species dumb. fact, feeding someone they're end life actually make dying painful stressful. natural shun food dying.   read already appear can.

What else expect do? makes ""dehumanizing"" even ""wrong"" give person like that? job, help actively refused. ny’er flerda sunsets always gorgeous feel like every night guessing literally ignored sourced found something thought contradicted it?

Please read sources see says *annually*. Ya'll gonna wear masks start staying home gonna continue stupid? Go Florida? Woo? We're number one! We're number one!

That's picture, along red MAGA hat, truck rebel battle flag wife know tips scales 200 pounds. Yeah, see happening either, look complacent traitor Russian puppet president... bar pick arms higher that, think they'll ever point. Nothing like compounding serious capacity issues stupidity. Medical staff Florida Texas already beyond burnt out. Spot on. Albeit cannot speak financial situation, Triage means all. fact resources limited. real world simply enough medicine everyone. Period. Hardly ever human history, case. 

This mean, real life. real death life choices people make pandemic. 

At point, resources low, hard choices made. want blame Federal Government shitty handling, agree 100%. would also say Americans pretending Covid joke like flu, taking seriously also blame. Young people ones less likely die, ones likely receive treatment. it. 

Don't downvote me. messenger. deaths lag 3 weeks behind detection. NYC basically gone infections deaths real total. Florida ramping infections numbers missing bulk people die. NYC death rate go hospitals got overwhelmed, happening Florida.

So Florida may end lower CFR NY, data almost meaningless. may become force readiness concern don’t want talked loudly.

Any peer competitor worth salt already people inside informing them, withholding info american people disservice. Omar coming. totally see coming. ohio, amusement parks open. amusement parks SUED governor wanting stay closed mid july... seem pretty good precautionary measures, cautionary really get you’re talking 40k people day? everyone gonna follow rules. it’s complete mess wanting open cases started rise again. keep telling y'all cut FL push ocean NOOOOOO, one listens me. there’s evacuation order. Hospitalizations definitely trending 6/10 chart. Also new hospitalizations ICU admissions, well deaths. preserving health lives around wearing scrap cloth across piehole much effort person choose believe disinformation makes life convenient them, person letting know trust worthy sensible.

Cherish feeling bafflement. shows moral ethical sense people sadly, case dangerously, lack. Yep, probably right. thing stands way Florida reach max testing capacity, sometime.

After test positivity rate going skyrocket. reading right Florida reported 10k cases today? That's just...insane... Build wall along florida land border want see hospitalizations hotspot stands far hospital capacity.

10,000 20-something year olds symptoms, minor anything, mean absolutely nothing. It’s flag Liberia, many dumb patriots use emoji (🇱🇷)instead US flag emoji (🇺🇸). Better look percentage tests come back positive.

[From see beginning June 5% coming back positive, 15%. actually think all.

DIsney world one places house 30+ teams relative isolation. Disney world probably one places enough room actually train too. SUre, probably outdoors soccer pitches. still. There's still quite basketball courts too. Plus orlando magic's training center real stadium.

Disney always place youth tournaments held. basically crack.

Vegas hotel space level training facilities such. least better doubling week we're seeing states. facial mask recommended Netherlands, believes social distancing, holy grail USA? belief belief Democracy odds other. Yep, two week ban. 99%?

If 1% dies, would 3 million Americans. 5% equals 15 million Americans. kid would read books volition got computers read bunch non-fiction technical books/manuals/articles. I've never really fan fiction books.

Some kids pick book accord, those, probably try ""forcing"" least give books try. someone said book ""too grown up"" me, I'd probably think ""eh, probably boring, going bother read it"", would rather playing video games basketball. number confirmed coronavirus cases U.S. climbed all-time high 50,000 per day Thursday, infection curve rising 40 50 states reversal largely spared yet another alarming indicator, 36 states seeing rise percentage tests coming back positive surge blamed part Americans wearing masks following social distancing rules states lifted lockdowns past weeks.

It looks like we're putting eggs imaginary ""vaccine coming fall"" basket. weeks? Florida never really shut down. measure that? Like okay, work M&amp;A, convince company purchase another company, present synergies, revenue improvement opportunities valuation pay well best way pay future acquisition. essentially get judged amount value bring company, relatively easy quantify. something similar operations manager manufacturing facility, produce year last year, odds made impact worth salary. look results easy see improvement value literal earnings generated.

You teachers, especially continue push elimination tests meant ""grade"" teacher. Now, judge teachers say, success putting students ivy league schools (stupid example know) community would likely willing pay teacher he/she offers desirable result others may not.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Im suggesting way fix btw, believe holds people back valuing teachers fairly (whatever may be).

Edit 2: Also Teachers union doesnt help bargain collectively allow higher merit teachers paid similarly aged counterparts. Yeah one happens president, made political mother says media blowing proportion manger thinks government conspiracy. problem sheep dumb think administration shitty try point right way It’s perfect positive that’s really telling. Everybody getting muddled reported new cases it’s misleading different numbers tests conducted. Well, ultimately State directive, plenty states follow exactly New York did. that, still defended decision reversal. 

Don't get wrong, think Cuomo ok decent best. definitely excellent implication. 

Source: people take seriously ones underlying condition known someone took hard died. people take seriously seen people covid issues, covid issues, care. personally believe things blown bit proportion, coming someone covid, felt like flu 2 days felt bleh another 3 fine. got tested work, felt like flu. Yeah, around call ""air herpes"" acts like herpes Lyme. Infects different organs (heart, brain, lungs, eyes) areas body, lives hides long time re-emerge immune system goes down. Affects individual differently. Triggers autoimmune responses, even disorders. like blood disease sure.

Scary stuff. think apply flu. article hiv change, said sentencing changed make equal sentencing spreading communicable disease (previously harsher). think gets punished unless like vengeance std scenario something. 

Our culture seems care getting others sick normal cold/flu season. I've actually met people think immoral stay home work despite sick. 
I think abhorrently immoral go work spread around ""common cold"" line American culture there. doubt also bullshitting real numbers. definitely higher reported. I've learned climate change never going dealt US. can't get shit together something killing people short term, there's way able make sacrifices necessary long term problem. GO FLORIDA!!! NUMBER 1 BABY!!! TBTB12!! common first name bit made chuckle. University Alabama one top law school country. think ranked number 13. 
But stuff like tells list might entirely accurate. sounds right Alabama...remember, Trump loves uneducated Nice b8 Hurricane season peaks September. Oh lying public justified? fair, made plan reopen things flatting out. guess they’ll delay reopening new info, never know... Based previous trend, 15K underestimate. Perhaps also huge student loans well parents pay whole thing them. Pandemic teaching hard way.....stuff happens control. Personally, refuse kind debt. fact, moved city lower cost living. result, paying half maybe even less half would paying never left. Leaving person die wrong idea something dehuminizing. get point. He’s denial. 

I friend working delivery right now. Last week entered restaurant pick order, wearing face mask, every patron ridiculed “afraid”. 

It’s going madhouse weekend. imagine “beach lives matter” protest. lot friends deemed essential workers line fire, Gov DeathSentence thinks age they’re partying. No. It’s older groups demanding friends show serve them!

On top look work likely settle get, put front line. like enough worry much. New York cases deaths state decimated nursing home population. I'm wondering why/how friend tested without symptoms, also even bothered get tested going ignore positive diagnosis? friend real piece work.  clearly said number CALLED e next 2 days going worse since probably results 2-3 days ago. stated regardless ABC / NBA tv deal, Disney's sports properties Orlando, FLA requisite facilities scale caused NBA believe could run tight ship. I.e., athletes living within like square mile, away families, advanced biometrics. Ooh yeah, state still playing game. It’s amazing single state cases entire countries. We’re bunch fucking morons deserve what’s coming. parents' neighbor's son family live Florida. cases started ticking last month state, son telling mother, ""We really seeing cases here,"" even could see numbers ticking up, up, up. Now, apparently, stopped saying cases, wife still kids signed participating activities. think they'll family actively anything one gets sick. ridiculous.  like eating McDonald's time time, addictive junk food. restaurant near crap hygiene, went wearing masks properly even mask sight half employees. That's hard going back. go back lockdown, alternative. Lock vaccine developed, NOW. feel pain.

 -Colorado Yeah buddy florida got tested Saturday getting results Monday ridiculous Porta Rico still want state? Maybe switch FL.  Well I'm waiting vaccine live life. muh mansion Last week like 140k tests week 70k. I’m talking processed results, suppose matters anyway. Underrated. wtf lakh cant write english like everyone else???? something eat what? yet, countries managing *much* better US. think weird contrarian bandwagon many Americans frequently latch onto roll ditch. estimate annual. estimated deaths caused *seasonal flu* *flu season*. quote article also season US, runs October May**, claims tens thousands lives every year. season CDC estimates that, mid-March, 29,000 59,000 died due influenza illnesses.

Any estimate see Seasonal Flu deaths counted October May, count reset. That's flu season lol. 

My point point compare two unless restrict Covid deaths October May.... extend influenza death counts far extend Covid counts. Yeet  Sounds like it. Education needs giant reform. I’m glad finally see deaths EU USA. Well done. 

While previous statement true, actually said deaths Europe USA. Breaking records Greeks break plates!

OPA-sy Daisy!  come full circle.

You guys making baseless accusations, knowing sub accepts Google translations, refusing offer better one.

I know would happen OP made translation made single mistake... guys would demand mods take down. OP stick accepted translation method think accurate offer corrections.

But guys refuse it, simply know translation good enough people understand true meaning article *that* want see here. conspiracy theory. I'm giving benefit doubt here, large influx types comments lately comment states ""*I* know believe this, check conspiracy theory."" comes across concern trolling I'm deleting comment. That's *trans*form America. 30% Let’s realistic: many people country fucking idea exponential growth even means. got me. probably /r/NotMyJob situation. new. that's always move. 10 times 13 years. yard sale one place take money new place fill home best local thrift stores offer u/remindmebot !RemindMe 1 week Basically runs Texas Senate lot influence state budget ""get one cent 1st double every day"" start one cent every day get double amount previous day. Dont worry theyre next Actually not. Elective surgeries big money makers hospitals, cancelled surge. 

The confusion we're hearing talking points hospitals empty. specialty staff equipment handle COVID cases (ICU staff, ECMO, vents, rotaprones, PPE, negative pressure rooms, etc) spread thin. Staff handle elective procedures laid off. People avoiding emergency rooms doctor's visits, staff would handle inflow needed much.

Unfortunately can't shift staff create ICU capacity. expertise. mUh rIgHtS! really strictly locked March 13 May 1st, start venturing again. kids getting depressed seeing friends stuck inside. go orthodontist appts braces maintenance. son needed non emergent dental surgery. son get back dance training person proper flooring. 

The truth is, people can't lockdown forever. feasible. practice reasonable social distancing mask wearing. Right, I'm saying probably caught rally. timeline adds perfectly (although much quicker symptoms hospitalization much slower onset he's honest onset date; either way, 12 days infection hospitalization reasonable). See UN warms harshly enforced lockdowns. really hard throw stick front wheel society without serious damage didn’t intend to.

In town, example, even “too soft” lockdown, food bank forced close liquor store not, head shop. wasn’t intended shows isn’t possible foresee effects well-intentioned disruption society. Imagine many people’s cancer wasn’t caught early enough due doctor’s office visits pushed, etc. catching cancer early everything! Think tens millions lost health care coverage. dependents. health care isn’t good mortality. Think effect spiking alcohol drug consumption right now, shortage Zoloft spike demand. many kill? much life steal average victim? many children raised single parent homes result? Health, education, earnings outcomes tend poor children single parent households. Covid doesn’t often. average age death someone covid-19 78-81. They’re still right though. According COVID Act it’s infection rate that’s .9 threshold rose .95, everything else still green. NJ well rose 1.00

Hopefully get back down, really would like seeing lot green map. Give us something hold lol Another shutdown? IMO 14 day quarantine problematic states enough. that, keeping restaurants bars closed it.  won’t take responsibility cases takes credit temporarily low death rate?

Maybe he’s taking credit he’s sweeping COVID deaths pneumonia deaths rug. sign up? I've done many embarrassing things life, I'm glad hell contribute gut-wrenching daily new case. Wearing mask sucks worth saving others. Without mask, much better serial killer. order kind flawed. you’re church something worship don’t wear one, always say medical disability wear one. It’s something, Karens Chads easily loophole know downvoted correct.

The regular part-time/full-time employees presumably live near parks like employee company would choose live near work.

The college program one brings students across world puts Disney-provided housing, suspended indefinitely. Thanks! Yea we're ready we're going buy regardless, complain there's excess stock available save 20-30k.

I'd much rather pay bit still economy decent jobs come it. bet seasonal like 1918 flu, go away summer. Except flu 1918. infectious people 2020 congregate inside summer due AC. aware EU already *is* mostly reopen? Ahhhhh threw ""I could wrong""

Complete total exoneration!!!!! Staying home reduces rate spreads, preventing health care resources overwhelmed. pointless all. Hey, hey, hey now! also dying stick libs. absolute dipshit wouldn’t able reason way wet paper bag, modern civilization covered.

Enough bashing president.  Let's say right. Let's say symptoms manifest sooner.

Let's say instead showing symptoms 5 days infected, show 2.

If growing shedding viruses time, going infect people 2 days would 5.

So even right symptoms manifest sooner (and reason believe obviously fucking doctor) point still stands good news.  make money Get used headlines schools throw caution wind reopen. Jesus. many trainers/coaches/other personnel infected?

This going shitshow. national numbers lull originally impacted states dropping faster newly impacted states rising. look overall graph see drop new cases.

But yeah, states one wave either rising falling right now.

WA mostly holding steady, guess wave plateaued. two young kids, almost 5years 8months, wife work home full time. tough.

My parents amazingly healthy, ages underlying conditions make COVID worse. work 50+ hours week live far enough away visiting day feasible.

My inlaws live little closer, retired, time world help childcare. actually staying us 3 nights week pandemic helping baby. Unfortunately, medical histories read like list COVID comorbidities; obesity, diabetes, heart problems, asthma, immune suppressed, seen months. 

It frustrating. headline catches everyone's attention (click bait). details say glamorous (the guy sedated ventilator time discovered) full disclosure, also 8 year old son desperately missing interaction kids. get it. Kids NEED school.

If get vaccine 2-4 years, none going matter COVID burn countries (even ones well now) get level heard immunity. However, I'm good bit optimistic vaccine front. think good chance (95%+) working vaccine 2021. unemployed ones yeah Italy Europe, know? Also, proves point. Mortality lower lower viral load overall. Viral loads weakened UV light. people feel ""take"" responsibility. world watching guys responsible. must affected someone close Oh jfc Yea, probably... probably saw article saying masks could help GDP lol. Interesting, place work, older crowd seemed disappointed younger crowd happy.  increasing number cases fault. unrelated news, low fatality rate absolutely result actions. Super crazy worst hit countries planet right wing populist governments #Heros Wear Masks Yep Haha legitimately believe conspiracy theory Vince shitty testing procedures he’s miserly also add case load cause wrestling declared nonessential knows survive (honestly thrive, record profits already year WWE AFAIK) without running shows AEW end cannot run.

And yet criticizing people voicing concerns concede valid.

I'm vaccines. Neither residents African countries.

But vaccine human trials elsewhere. favor those. favor eliminating every avenue physical contact human beings though.

Yeah nobody enjoyed it, people kicked screamed, guess what? went 4k cases day consistently 500 past 2-3 weeks. We’ve reopened good amount things still managed maintain low numbers massive lockdown.  I'm watching rope playgrounds weekend Philly hope stays way Right, people propping literally dead, might deep, recovery slower (and perhaps healthier). mention large portion Americans probably antivaxers point anyway. give zero shits virus right now, try convincing get vaccine.

Fauci, CDC, saying wear masks months now. are.... ignoring science medical guidance. Fauci fucked up, admitted it, move on. News like make people low guard dismantle mask Hopefully finally gets people’s attention.

I’m dumbfounded people still believe hoax, nothing concerned about. Nailed it. Disney largest employer state. numbers, statistics, facts? Good. happens complain “my freedoms.” 

We many cases playing fuck fuck this. exactly swimming money Scrooge McDuck style - without rent, many going creek many paddles rest us.

Very much depends upon landlords talking about. major cities, rental units primarily owned one half dozen companies. cannot imagine paid mortgages years ago. Provided property tax holiday state they'd probably basically problem either.

If even go far banks pause mortgage payments interest...then even larger slice landlords fit bill. Mortgage holiday + property tax payment holiday means banks holding property essentially holding debt making much profit time.

If truly worried making money, pump full cash 2 trillion dollars Fed (like fucking anyway).

I understand everyone thinks ""lowly"" landlord renting unit owns personally pay mortgage, majority landlords fall category, proportionate response means whether they'd ok. Someone said retarded saying that, upvotes me. ""We're already making bank lockdowns, we're moving sale another moment making much now"" sue anything, even win. Also, people rarely ever follow results headline-grabbing lawsuits.

I hope family crowdfunds massive lawsuit former friend. headline might scare people off. Congrats Everyone~ academic biological difference asymptomatic presymtomatic states? Yes obviously, real-world practical difference one documentation paperwork (she even speaks this) use literally anyone except technical team WHO.

Ughh, obviously useful anyone trying contact tracing infection, even thinking it. pretty much entire intended audience WHO: countries health regulatory agencies. 

Are really implying clarify use terminology they've used years papers statement made ""Asymptomatic transmission rare"" (yes even using well explained definition) line current body knowledge. cites unreviewed data yet makes firm claim, poor messaging hands undoubtedly got people killed.

You claim that, nothing assertion made ""unequivocal statement"" ""presymtomatic people rarely transmit"".

I think pretty ironic complain people reading transcript pretty obvious read word least pointed clear fact it. 💀 I'm sure pedantic use English language messed invalidate this: know sub. Thank you. Yes that's *after* OC Karens behaving terribly choice. CMs huge pushback they're definitely paid enough deal people trying break rules.

OC still shit together. Newsom finally said enough announced yesterday he's shutting dining rooms, movie theaters, unnecessary places counties. its* head SE Oakland here, everyone seems well too. Certainly occasional exception, rare enough definitely notice every time see someone Meijer unmasked. Like ancestors shouted ""State's Rights"" mean State's Rights. mean local control. God revisionism absolutely terrifying disgusting time.

There's reasonable way contact tracing 50k new cases every day. Let's leave golf too! Literally physically distanced sport is, haha.

I'm trying understand note. process conducting national study. far IIRC Bergamo, hardest hit city (+538% mortality previous year) highest 57 per cent whole population antibodies. safe assume South situation strongly differs virus never really got intensity Right, right. people seem follow the, ""I can, will"" doctrine. Ugh, I've arguments people online ad nauseam Splash Mountain stuff. tell live weirdly sheltered life arguments stem from, ""well, ***I*** understand ride rabbit bear even racist, like it."" Like, except throw hands walk away? Vaccines nothing eradicate disease. extremely rare us eradicate disease, even type virus. 

And 30% hospitalized, very, small percentage get virus. even then, results dubious. particles trying get much much smaller why. particles getting micro droplets. particles trying get much smaller droplet nuclei left airborne droplets carried evaporate. Blind people dont think themselves. like call others sheep sheep. Sheep lead slaughter. tiny percentage do.

There always rare awful exceptions disease.

Even Strep usually quite minor kills couple thousand year US alone. one day back Feb China put 14K single day due several days backlog. crazy day, still see blip graphs. 

Anyway, here’s wonderwall.  really old articles share us? I'm Northeast lived California couple years found living different expected. People seemed independent, sociable, impersonal, headstrong back home. mean hospitals reach capacity ventilators death rates start raise. We've months work better practices treating serious cases. better death per 1 million rate would pathetic point. Trash new one. Can't say GOP governors shit? trying give accolades worst response *they suck donkey dick?* OECD data says Canadian teachers 15 years experience average $67k/year (US Dollars).

US teachers experience earn average $64k/year. also get state pensions teachers union among largest Wait what..? get work done, shouldn’t business also caring kids. intentionally getting self quarantine harm others? currently literally killing people. Florida first? fries smarter too.  It’s asymptomatic carriers really driving opinion. carriers much less likely get tested. Still waiting explanation 20k person gathering, people wore masks chin straps, logically spread virus. Either mass gathering not. It’s either safe not. sure going beach worse. 

The argument protest good cause. anyone show study virus woke enough realize person mass gathering? Wait hospitals already crammed actual hurricane season happens feel sorry Americans. deserve kind governance.

Don't feel sorry us. live democracy-one half us even vote. like current government seized power military takeover. article single amino acid mutation protein virus envelopes binds cells, makes infectious (and viral load, ie amount virus detected test), version virus become common world compared other

If entire state Florida catches Covid ends getting within month COVID scare ends there, may actually change everything deal disease. might end following florida model let disease run rampant.

In alternative everyone could die hospitals overwhelmed. Don’t fret. in-laws took invitation looking forward frivolity.  Even states like [Pennsylvania, Colorado, cases significantly fallen since April seeing rise I'm saying get least profit month. mean, math dude deposit 5.3 million dollars, I'm pretty sure could convince bank come pick up. lawyer hadn’t travelled. worked law firm NYC. still aren’t sure contracted it.

1.	Social distancing precautions thought necessary actually don’t matter much spreading virus safe reopen large outside gatherings.
2.	This false due fact contact tracers banned asking protestors many didn’t get tested they’re young asymptomatic. work county government leaders yet tell us masks mandatory. Signage still says masking optional. already went cliff years back. We're waiting ground give us sweet, sweet relief death. Also, that's lot people possibility life-long affects fair, assumed vast majority coronavirus cases go untested unregistered. even though America registering 50,000 cases day, likelihood real number cases far higher, probably closer 500,000 cases per day.  rephrased like often, it'd probably scare people abstract percentage !remindme 1 week don’t see strategy anything herd immunity. sugar coating it, dancing around question.

He 50s diabetes, appeared overweight well. going out? Probably not. ultimately choice make, yours, governments, anyone else’s. chance. even hit 2 % yet. Please send help. Apparently can’t (or won’t) help ourselves. “even strict lockdown, 50 percent country locked down.”

The lockdowns state state quite strict. mean? People arresting left house? mean something else? mean overview entire country? seems like one putting numbers, would easier provide source, since presumably already seen it, shithead Yes! show definitely along lines humor naked gun. fucking cackled it, soooo dumb hilarious. VP vows to** ~~‘keep opening up~~ **let America** ~~’ U.S. sets new record coronavirus cases~~ **die**.

This happening actually. Leadership USA letting citizens die. 

Your suffering. 

Your death. 

Your ruined lives. 

All mean anything - allowed continue happen. 

This 'man', claims follow God, God strictly preached protect need, letting everyone die. Throw IL too, look chicago specifically daily cases super low still. 52% us don’t CA numbers little misleading due massive amount people here. look cases per 1 million, actually middle pack relates infections.

Its like difference pissing kiddy pool olympic swimming pool; theres piss one way worse. death rate lags infection increases, rise dramatically hospitals overwhelmed, happening. Here's raw data hospitalizations that's week old! think meant millions. look mask protect disease yeah simple thing ethical so

If look foot door irreversible changes western governments require citizens do, real argument ethics obedience

It's complex issue way know true bombarded lies, half truths truth. Certainty beyond grasp society right now, fear powerful incentive cede control uncertain times Michael Osterholm answers: states re-opened surging others reopened not? really know. ~~OP~~ parent ninja'ed comment, first reply originally wrote, second ninja edit.

And yes, replies angry fact explaining exponential growth implied February work. mean, California sherifs said concealed carriers prosecuted wearing masks. 

And Carry whenever wherever can. 

And wear mask. 

The law (or Facebook post misinformation based on) says cannot wear masks intention hide identity. That’s clearly what’s going right now. 

Grow up. Keep carrying WEAR MASK.

If get arrested subpoena me. Getting virus still bad even chance death lower like use words :)

Less jokingly, problem air travel travel general makes movement pandemics highly non local. longer find simulations internet. covid19 stuff. reasons isnt good idea. First, really know long immunity lasts. believe proven cases reinfection yet, ends immunity lasts short time infection, people would intentionally killed reason. Second, convince people go intentionally catch virus may kill them? unlikely young people severe complications, still happens. Third, whole reason slowing rate infection hospitals keep up. Places US already struggling hospital capacity, thats without people intentionally getting virus. “...from wall” Texan, god wish us. :( 5% death rate. way many people die.

How forum ignorant this?

IFR 0.6% lower.

Look joking.

CDC national virus institute say thing.

99.4% survives.

You look infection fatality ratio.

The ""death rate"" gives really misleading idea.

Please beg read it.

Look IFR!


I putting family danger. reasonable third party risk.

But understand think think 5% dies.

That absolutely ridiculous.

IFR many people got infected die. also counting cases miss.

The problem obesity bad health corona.


And old age.


Are American? would explain it.

That woman wants VP lying you. dutch government careful lying population. indoors air conditioning. know anyone else, I'd rather become another statistic. Percent positive rates climbing significantly. yes they're testing more, testing ramped recently, higher percent people testing positive. What’s vanilla ice? seem angry. Lot /r/FloridaMan going around million people dead. It’s one listening it. work county government weren’t told need wear mask work. walked past bus stop bunch people sitting picnic tables waiting bus half masks on. one going follow requirement police aren’t going enforce it. Yeah, unfortunately numbers went that. I’m ABQ noticed high amount Texas plates recently... really hope changes things. Lol made laugh. cherish laughs bleak times Congrats! You’re jackass- realize people families. You’re saying try protect people?

Jesus Christ. There. answer actual question. Good job Florida. know I’m probably minority here, I’m risking health Florida’s financial health.

That’s say, open, really wonder many people show up. Former FDA chief said expects real number cases increase per day least double we're catching right now, holy shit. Almost. know people back Asia, deal swine flu, avian flu, God knows else.


So protocols already there. trust Asian take places anyone else cause restaurants still screaming ""just flu"", Asian places closed week reopened like biohazard air locks. mean cares many cases are? many people dying many would've died anyway something similar within reasonably short amount time? There's also eldery woman went viral lockdown measures made depressed.

She'd rather die live like that. Well, thats boys! Pack up. Nice job florida! Crushing records ! That’s nice you. I’d “NOPE” way outta quickly. precautions taken, wouldn’t take like 33 infection cycles affect entire world’s population? source “people went bars first weekend”? 

I believe you, need backup argument. trying use OpenTable’s numbers, they’re used restaurants. think Trump hoping New York like surge crash nationwide close herd immunity elections roll around manipulate news cycles like usual. state making effort stop virus. counties mandating masks shutting places, state makes half-assed mandates like closing bars, make 50% revenue food. Spoiler alert... nobody checking part state almost every bar serving food stay open. 

I work retail blown away many people coming state right now. state wants keep tourism money anything halt coronavirus spread. stay there! safe honey. I'd fly help we're little busy Southern California that, friend, fundamental problem democracy. entire purpose government make people need want; wanted need, government would necessary. Yet government chosen people based want. one sees paradoxical nonsensical nature system? looking ways slow next 2-3 years, big picture, leads deaths. I'm looking ways make terminal vectors, disallowing spread ending disease fewest deaths. Well boomers believe everything computer screen may help tiny bit MAH FREEDUM! **reddit** politicizing virus? joke? Trump GOP politicized day one. made wearing fucking mask political. Geez, don’t wish death people Could literally move New Zealand. Pay govt quarantine players arrival.. huge stimulus local economy.. win win. It’s even far fetched Janes Cameron done cast Avatar Again, Mexico lot cases field workers wanting get tested losing job. border essentially closed long time. Dude can't avoid bumping someone Disney; many people staring stuff walk.  Oh, no. I'm sure we're distraught. possibly losing election due economic decline hard decision

If would supported lockdown took care American workers would landslide. Even people enthused Biden, *really* hate trump.

Instead administration decided engage domestic terrorism. thought still cases spread golf. least highest likelihood safe sport. Time build wall dentist office cancelled cleanings. routine every 4 month dr visit waived well follow appointment new medication. say shut down, mean March? numbers weren’t bad virus starting spread Would mind including number tests this? Nice  governor blamed increased testing yet? That's many cases Canada TOTAL. rented cabin weeks ago. us kids. course stop go bathroom eat 7 hr drive. wear masks, eat car, stay clean. 

That's ask anyone. time needed social distance one trip Walmart groceries weekend. 

Am going go beach bar? Absolutely not. I'm locking house either like there's zombies roaming street. Disney opening based reservation system first days already booked parks. passholder preview days next week already fully reserved. expect they'll meet reduced capacity close days. Universal pretty busy. Busch Gardens less so, that's locals park hot AF right Tampa. Locals wanting outside.

The real fly ointment quarantine requirements. Right travel NY/NJ/CT FL requires 14-day quarantine end. expect states also institute quarantine travelers coming Florida, impact amount guests. Plus, big time year European visitors happening, either.

I've got Disney trip booked October. Waiting see things shake virus parks, I'm terribly hopeful moment. Wear. A. Fucking. Mask. Please. Thanks. far food thing goes, like refused give food anything. u/Wellthatbackfiredddd explained well another part comments patients come us options tried. try provide best quality life.  ends happening patients tend stop communicating, stop eating. offer liquids food usually turn eat small bites there. per power attorney directive force feeding giving saline drip iv considered life saving measures ‘medical intervention’ literally lose license give hospice patient signed DNR saline drip. given patients morphine aspirated medication hence us give morphine anus, imagine us trying give water barley take lick morphine.  yes painkillers process impending death faster. However ever seen actively dying patient without hourly morphine? Go half hour past time you’ll hear loudest whispering horrifying scream.

Im sure whole thing able FaceTime husband about, highly doubt left alone. Hospice workers selfless people there. always certain party, it? ok, nothing Ops comment, around choosing eat pay rent. What’s stop lying you’ve contact with? Absolutely one said that. Stop putting words mouth fit narrative continue arguing facts. 65 5.6% IFR.

Wear mask stay away elderly. really simple. absolutely problem lockdowns.  Florida likely under-counting around 50%. multiple counties ICU beds right now, state wide. note deep shades red throughout map people blame lately. actively voted in. don’t genius figure best interest America’s best interest. feel like time two parties stood something general (one agreed other). time one party selfishly what’s best “us” one wanted generally equality all. one party “let’s trash place fuck everyone” dumbfounded Exactly. Fox News, crying loud. reminds stuff we've seen ...

 

I've noticed tons generations throwing parties, refusing wear masks negligent. Reopen anti-mask protests, noticed older generations, kids. people generations acting stupid.

And people thread eating up. parks open undoubtedly contributed spread coronavirus within state. 

Disney opening Food Wine Festival day one Epcot’s reopening. means people walking around park eating drinking face masks down. isn’t cautious, it’s insanely reckless irresponsible, simply make profit. 

Florida arguably hotbed world right virus. None parks need open, impossible ensure virus spread circulated throughout parks.  FAMILY. FUN. PACK. 
!!!!!!  I’m telling anyone chosen kids overpopulation, it’s effect environment general sense world supportive place raise one. pandemic falls one categories. Perhaps them. i've gotten rhabdo twice, usually something leads death. i'm almost positive covid made worse friend. Alright ill keep mind, thank reply! Surprisingly yes, varies lot. government really good job spreading awareness running campaigns, message reached everyone well. Indians tbh sense personal space, yet adopted social distancing pretty well.

I live Bangalore, equivalent San Francisco terms people's education levels, awareness, etc. called silicon valley India similiar startup culture &amp; crowd. People really good wearing masks. Nearly everyone wears them, even poor uneducated folks do.

Can't say every place country. recent case marriage groom severe symptoms yet went ceremony. died 2 days later. 100+ attendees marriage funeral tested positive.

As though, people become careless decided embrace covid. good. going explode unless authorities take measures again. would died white well circumstances. **COVID-19 SPEEDING TICKET!** get 2nd chance! End life. treat like get away first time kind risk. Mentality people way off! stupid. Neither he. private citizen showed hospital denied care FOR-PROFIT hospital ran supplies beds care people. medical insurance part conversation Disneyworld reopening. insane. It'll interesting see really see many fools still want go. Ha, like America cares. American soldiers cause sorts trouble overseas, usually gets swept rug. get info literal president, gotta give benefit doubt No.

My understanding two barriers.

The first funding. Florida state tax. consumption tax which, lockdowns, diminish. need stay open make ends meet need close save lives save money.

Congress needs step up. Without it, understanding idea non-starter.

The second DeSantis receives lot dark money support lot people want close. So, whatever argument made needs compelling dark money.

The model projected hospitals would overwhelmed really terrified state local leaders. That's triggered lockdowns. Something tangible like would probably helpful.

And pairing medical costs state would absorb immediate long term chronic complications like strokes, amputations, organ failure might compelling enough case, too. They’ve literally done 4 separate days already (all within last week). course it’s upvoted.. think contact tracing waste resources? According test report testing period 20 April 12 June. Maybe thinking report preceded latest?

Source Swedish: [Report Tegnell's statement numbers lower expected press conference June (18th think), see source first comment.

I hope worst Sweden, wouldn't? architect Swedish response says early tell...maybe hold declaring victory. I'm married point view, newer sources, I'm happy pleasantly surprised. Well problem children weakened immune systems like diseases even kids going chemo  alligator could probably form better response current Florida government Sure long you’re rich.  explain *why* we're going full herd immunity? might kill old people? People need respect virus realize deadly contagious is. average flu Great scheme round idiots confirm that. Weather's going nuts year Corona Ice. use hacksaw cut Florida rest country, cartoon style? Fuck...so like haven’t even killed first wave white walkers there’s coming. dragons? dragons, mean Asian measures....oh told never listen Asians becoz USA #1 rest world bullshit us I'm afraid corona. stay inside care health. Yes, scapegoat based science, racism. COVID grabs ahold tightly schools originally said (NC) we've seen clusters blooming across state last weeks. governor giving 2 weeks DPI make statewide recommendation. seriously doubt back normal schools mid-August. 

So hold hope state also change direction. Otherwise, may see drop enrollment due parents pulling kids schooling home (or small groups parents). school system also online 'academy' graded like normal school. Kids enroll instead standard school - think fewer course options HS, like APs.  good point! meant start charge, scare them, imprison them, dismiss charge later.
It's something protests times, hand dispersal notices charges, dismiss whole protest group. stops things get hand put anyone jail.

I understand certainly problems US education system doom gloom throwing money fix problems rarely works. [Dude people hosting COVID parties. Whoever wins game gets COVID win people placed trust dear leader become plain stupid. % positive bro mean ""Russia worse"" somewhat given. saying Sweden comperable Russia? Man, hard Sweden even think that's apples oranges comparison. Russia always cluster f, Sweden expected be. Sweden expected perform like Nordics, yet didn't. 


But guess right: case Sweden trending towards Russian Model Nordic Model. disastrous effects, potentially creating long term herd disability. Imagine middle Contagion Matt Damon took kid Disney World. moreso agreeing comment seemed say daycare immoral behavior. kids regularly watched someone parents bad thing. ALWAYS like this. modern day daycare used nannies wet nurses. formula breast pumps really need wet nurses. I'm away work, legally entitled time pump. Daycare basically nanny...just home watching child. Yup, it’s super fucked argument “Oh died Covid? Well must underlying health problems” absolves guilt McDonald's even open, bet schools/colleges either. Online be. many times need learn lesson?

If don’t control virus, control you.  also extremely difficult get test one wondering got number? refresh [latest state report](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf) Florida every day. Today appears second highest ever reported NEW cases. 

The number new cases 9,558. believe ""over 10,000"" records new repeat positives, 11,550.

To clear, extremely bad, false headlines give ""It's hoax!"" crowd ammunition. gasses contribute smell particles. sounds lot doable think. Phase II approval, roughly 40 percent vaccines approved. 5 candidates would likely yield one vaccine Ok, please provide sort cite scientific evidence. quite lot way Especially boldened part true. lie? know many perfectly normal intelligent Americans I've certainly spoken plenty, fuck also many frighteningly arrogant unintelligent ones!? Canadian used reading Americans dumb things, even article made double take.  I'll bite. think comment section for? talk weather?
Also month 7-8 covid 19 need expert see f'ed America. look countries see worked. graph like punch gut. 
It doesn’t like 😭 Lol RT pure Russian state sponsored propaganda. 

Stop. overall population density lower, sure, could fit 322 Belgiums US. probably many areas size Belgium within US densely populated Belgium itself.



Not say response US incredibly awful, comparing overall population density 2 countries vastly different size pretty meaningless. COVID-19, significant also COVID-19, continuously giving back forth back forth forever, never giving bodies time needed fight virus good? India cracking hard cases growing, that's obvious. hope giving up, like Americans. thinking?! show anything. That's community decide bothers that's problem. get vaccinated get sick anyway nothing either. stop worrying people put faith instead double putting faith vaccine. never going shutdown level would eliminate virus, reason widespread point. country short closures bend curve followed rapid phased reopening.  Instead kept everything closed long, exhausting funds patience encountered situations public health authorities eroded trust. Everything said true, sorry hurt feewings. Worth.
Turn off.
When need turned on, make sign agreement abide COVID rules permanently lose power water.
PROBLEM SOLVED. Yeah freedom win? comes home you... choice, widespread hospital capacity already thin. Wow, disrespect Jason Isbell. stopped using hydrocychloroquine interesting thing source (and lot state level coverage) reporting numbers deaths getting harder find.

Another article posted minutes ago reported additional 67 deaths FL, one, obvious main big paper sites (Miami Herald, Orlando Sentinel, Holy shit. health insurance actually function way? poor bastards. mere notion Disney opening Disney World 1.5 weeks abhorrent.

Norway's fault we're humble. restaurants, beaches open, fireworks shows still happening surf supposed pretty big + hot weather. Also lot people head TJ cheap fun. work healthcare even know horseshit! people agreeing nonsense? found answer here: quote: ""New Data NYC Resident Deaths Outside City

Lol following posts? Can't help notice accused defending someone never did, like last time. said they're tiny minority, they're right. 

Stay wrong stay mad, liar. Stay safe let actions affect judgement. got flack saying yesterday I've seen heard visiting parents Stokes county, nothing going convince sizable portion population take seriously. 

Sorting reading controversial another way gauge sentiment 20-40% population. can't Russian propagandists trolls. lot people truly feel way nothing going change mind point. fact, information get counters views, dig heels.

What happening right unavoidable. lesson learned hard way. Honestly, bad someone knowingly HIV continuing unprotected random sex. different, true. However, hospital nurse at, unless Covid patient getting aerosolizing procedure, wear surgical procedural masks them, N95s. facility, N95s reserved respiratory therapists wear times everyone else wears aerosolizing involved (high flow nasal cannula, intubation, nebulizer treatment, certain oxygen masks, etc). Otherwise, plain surgical procedural mask Covid patients. vast majority time Covid patient, wearing procedural surgical mask. minimal positive employees facility wide thus far, large Covid 19 patient population. Yay....Florida (man) leading way! Knew could it! /s say time said now. 5 months since America could claim panic buying reason fir shortages. go store America today still N95 masks. explanation deliberate intent allow spread. Ditto. Due January. financial ducks row waiting vacation start trying. Covid cancelled vacation international travel foreseeable future. Looking ages, fact want 2 kids, job stability, decided go it. Didn’t make sense us put life hold indefinitely. It’s ideal time, perks (never wanted big baby shower anyway). Plus, life ever work perfectly? nothing triage. Hospice care patients get invasive treatments even patient hospital. confirm, everything great there. 

Hope well matter are, Beijing or.. Nice alarmist garbage here, Less 500 Covid patients ICU medical center right now. nice Fauci next 

Didn’t bother vet models shut country with

Was job 40 years totally unprepared

don’t wear mask, wear mask 


Nothing politician lab coat 19% amount state tested far believe , 14.5 number positive tests ran yesterday (around 70k) Sadly one told biology. kids long jobs invented. anyone taken pet vet since started? cat due vaccines I'm worried even wear mask wash afterwards could still come back long fur. would well bath 3 day quarantine afterwards. work hospital treat patients gotten Remdesivir intubated. feel like piece news leaving things out. RemindMe! 20 days Wonder don’t everything?

Just please don’t steal stuff y’all, consequences please don’t. 

Oh yeah, don’t doesn’t work know that... might tempted call states kind hole, hole people dump excrement. 

Might be. Yuuuup going hot surf big, plus SD still firework shows scheduled! easy see think people coming here. see cure first eating tide pods... hoarding Toilet paper sudden demand spike created shortages. Half TP market commercial overnight entire demand went retail side. China emergency wasnt present conus. Absolutely, best wishes speedy recovery! Imagine experience Wuhan doctors could shared China open situation.

I hope countries remember happened @ start handled (including WHO) it? Texas deaths stagnant. CA FL. AR seems trending upwards system also 2 weeks ago. read similar push back several years seatbelts cars mandated.

And every year see people ignore evacuation orders hurricanes happen,

This protest 100 200 people 472,000 county  

. **0424%** That's.. what? sure state words. even 10th percent guess I'm actually confused all. Esp Sweden. Sweden basically nothing? worse US Sweden? Definitely harder raising neuro typical child. He's actually even diagnosed yet. process takes forever here. suppose appointment May, but, well.... things happened lol. 

I love little guy though. He's challenging he's much fun. We're fortunate many people told us appears high functioning spectrum. I'm planning next 15 years around close resources needs giving whatever help him. He's already smart I'm hoping find productive way use focus. every new case mortality rate falling. Gonna get point severe winter flu. That's call lockdown question. I'm sorry stated facts, stocks? already available information DECEMBER issue. Choosing get pregnant February require hindsight. I'd like personally thank governor Ron DeSantis pursuit greatness, ever increasing covid-19 numbers, paving collective way 60k confirmed cases day. instrumental we, country, achieve 100k confirmed cases single day. list never made much sense me, might well inconsistent they're it.  US least million deaths unless lock down. Houston averaging 2k cases per day month ago, hitting highs ok 8k plus. 50% nationwide city specific. City/state specific much worse. America First! Michigan better most. Michigan around 250 new cases day. perspective, 2 states included travel ban Florida Cali, around 5,000 new cases day.

Michigan absolute peak 1750 new cases day.

The travel ban Michigan really make sense me. incubation period estimated incubation period (the time catching virus symptom onset) 5-6 days average, ranging 1 14 days.""

Nothing suspicious, died next day posting Facebook message, least ""couple weeks"" party... roughly 1/20th size us 50k cases roughly half bad US per capita US testing roughly 3x per capita. also higher positive percentage well. peaked 234 deaths per day would like US rate 4,680.

you decide whether better, worse, great news money/debt people get pay back later universally form higher taxes likely. affect lower classes harder again. Double whammy :) 

 /s

This another great example broken tax system (among systems). Fed creates ""magic money"" disproportionately benefit already wealthy sectors, reminds classes debt money need collect form taxes. 

In words, may time talk it, really matter debt today ever US. sent hospice left alone 6 days, starved, left dead.

That sound like palliative care meant ease suffering one post say 19% one say 14.5%? childcare ""bubble"" never necessary first place.

The requirement (and expectation) parents work full-time outside home fucked us point. Children US growing literally seeing parents nights weekends (if that) - meaning putting upbringing infant children hands rando childcare facility.

That never be. See next week new record criticism based political interests, points made research easily debunked. IFR consistently remained 0.4% - 0.9%, since February. Dozens studies confirm this. Diamond Princess cruise ship, every person tested, every infection, every death known. several towns Italy, Germany, China, Sweden, serological tests surveyed every single person infected. 
 
This well accepted now. 
 Deaths result COVID positive tests metrics worth looking laypeople. 
 
No. CFR useless, reason people think COVID overblown, scientists wrong, much less lethal now. heard numbers like 3%, 5%, news reported much better numbers getting. simply testing improved. Lay people comparing countries using CFR, thing measuring actually testing rates. Hat Kid: ***cannot help, sick*** agree more. would worse winter coming. 40% America declared overweight/ obese. You’re 16x likely hospitalised 6x likely die.

Compare South Korea, Japan, average diet consists rice, fish, chicken vegetables etc. Makes wonder countries faired well. 950 pesos? dont know live city cheapest option. 70? That's generous. would like wouldn’t ya psychopathic nihilist People said racism bigger problem virus.

[Over 1,000 health professionals sign letter saying, shut protests using coronavirus concerns - CNN

The protests started May 26th pushed pandemic background. Many governors supported them. protests combined partial reopenings gave people false sense security.

Maybe slow testing. [US hits another bleak coronavirus front page CNN right discussing exactly this. guess get you’re saying may element political spin many stories disagree haven’t addressing dangerous situation is. Victoria, Australia recently ordered 100,000 asymptomatic tests result 36 infections one day amid increse positives. brought 1000 troops door knocking hotspot suburbs. also locked ten suburbs people leave either essentials work(if suburb) care loved one. Don’t know NY specifically. sure relates comment. talking testing people insure currently virus. said ""Happy Holidays"" instead ""Merry Christmas"" Disneyworld Florida one. Lol. Give up. Time move new blame game. What’s next racists blame? spreading pretty quickly Florida, extremely humid right one gives shit US complete failure handling crisis.
Can please focus Europe actually took thing seriously look responsibly reopening now? 
Like get it, America fucked. What’s new? Yeah there's huge difference scale - though time fight would fall apart guy positive theoretically would get pulled games? gonna interesting see looks practice. yeah obviously way different UFC's plan, pointing leagues gonna easy time getting tests.

Seen shit before. knows we're calling wants flake he's ghosting. hes gonna sweep whole fucking weekend that's *he* wants I'll get reply Monday morning like, ""o sorry phone died"" I'm seeing like 95% compliance KOP, least Walmart, Wawa, Wegmans (the 3 places I've months). I'm proud us actually.

The 5% people wearing mask incorrectly. tell last time one places saw somebody completely without one. number excess deaths causes 28% higher official tally U.S. Covid-19 deaths months.*

I running numbers earlier day, found add massive rise ""pneumonia"" (or flu) deaths, end extra 25-30% covid19 deaths under-reported hiding stats.

So even CDC numbers, analysis 28% extra vovid19 deaths money.

I'd also like see analysis deaths even recorded ""pneumonia"", like people die elderly care home. difference trailing rolling averages? know China's rep great right hope vaccine testing Brazil goes well sake Brazilians. surfaces touch car + aircon recirculation 100x problematic mask (or lack thereof). inside buildings.

Masks fine precaution, acting morally superior one laughable. guess we'll see quickly Kemp implements DeSantis method...it's foolproof way bring numbers down! that's true, even friends 21 year old  correct worded wrong...I referring 13.56% 
either way important number percent positive...you use percent positive based amount cases tests. 
100 cases 13.56% 
or 
10000 cases 13.56% 
Its thing second looks far worse 10000. Either way percentage really high really bad. sees governors mandating masks realizes he'll soon alone Nomaskland, nobody paying attention him? It’s we’re slow, it’s people making important decisions don’t give shit. Final Destination happens. don’t understand less housing people houses dying. Thank actually valuable perspective. People like assuming world ending oftentimes isnt. I'm Schuylkill county walmart earlier today. Maybe 50% people wearing masks.  take offense don’t issues it- totally get medical fatigue/exhaustion!!! Look spoon theory- use lot helps people understand. 

I wanted share “fun fact” related field! Feel better ! happens every hospital south mason dixon line east rockies reach breaking point time? know takes least 3 weeks case load start dropping- happens 1/4 country cannot go hospital reason 3 weeks? Good luck you. Who's team? that’s putting nicely...  Lucky live Northeast. one person gotten car without mask. Worst happens they'll see wearing mine go ""oh shit forgot mask"" run back inside get one. People get shamed ""odd one out"" wearing mask. India nearly bad testing now. They're less week away #3 absolute number detected infections though... Well unemployment low right now. city needs hire bunch bylaw officers start handing fines. reckon earn wages back 10 fold.  Big Gretch rescue it. I'm old enough remember losing touch old friends norm. found long-lost childhood friends family members FB, way leaving. sure hell mean see idiotic posts feed think they've fallen rabbit hole. 

I rarely log FB all, tbh. place post occasional funny thought serving rolodex (those certain age know I'm talking about). Hey.

Cool.  confirm Pennsyltucky. whiners first complained virus hoax, governor shouldn’t close businesses, killed elderly didn’t enough, businesses open whine masks.

The whiners don’t understand wearing masks keep businesses open keep folks employed. people rant needing wear mask, fucking run over. Yes. Because, nature society, always contrarian. It’s Americans best; contrary. Something something Trump re-election something something   That’s meant, English native language didn’t come well guess ..

A different take I've got mine. grocery stores need government tell right thing right thing. could enacted safety procedures excess literal nothing required government choose to. pity workers, one else. Scary data. Things continue get worse action isn’t taken. Demand’s never going go down. Every day, humans, homes needed. Without even factoring foreign buyers, it’s obvious never buyer’s market. plus lot AZ empty land I'm convinced Trump pee himself, let alone 'strategy'. reason think are? like exponential growth particularly difficult understand, opened without decreases cases anyways.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m referring part say “which mostly going prevent people getting sick you, protect you.”

The protection people equal, based material used. Take mask, $1000 fine endangering driver, normal cleaning fee clean car droplets. Thank you! It’s certainly scary hell here. Also infuriating county judge Harris County willing shut everything again, can’t dumb ass Governor posse decided long time ago lives don’t matter. Thats current generation leaders literally never wanted anything prosperous people lives single generation human history.

The people made hard sacrifices 1914-1945 build gone. false, go eat alone time. catch virus easily. already know 1 LA person coming SD. County stats show restaurants #1 place get it. You’re fucking idiot. Whatever happened stupid people playing explosives us favor removing gene pool quickly? wearing masks keeping least distance pretty low risk I’d accuse fear mongering sadly might correct almost economy starts shut people start freak might lose job. guess managed original shutdown better could avoided multiple shutdowns. ship sailed anyhoo... delivered.

As repairs, screwed. many still love PC Android. I've wanted add Apple stable need options customize experience ability fix upgrade computer myself. Oh one THOSE? No. There's nothing beyond Worcester. Stay out!! Look top. I'm glad Arizona going get medical help. There’s exponential growth factor, there’s also issue spin. GA reopening, Kemp Albany admitting SW GA totally overwhelmed. NE Augusta alone two outbreaks among nurses patients hospital staff tried cover well multiple reports doctors tests “vanishing” numbers messed with. it’s big ignore. There’s way numbers aren’t higher. good part inside McDonald's kid video games  They’re ICU capacity already. Frankly it’s already late want avoid bloodbath. option left see percentage population susceptible. Jajaja stop drinking early, true want 3M masks  different saying let's become obese data shows diabetes issue? preventive care. entire country would upstate NY followed instructions think safe say don't. takes one person fuck set us back another month. seen like clearly tired dealing this, I. There's one way fix it. asked simple question, loaded least. didn’t expose falsehoods, statement “Trump tell people ingest Clorox”. failed expose statement false hood. show said that. I’m saying **if** necessary find way. Spending billions dollars save millions lives 10s 100s trillions dollars brainer. infrastructure investment would wind reused vaccines future it’s wasted. Probably little. friend mine took trip California, came back said he’ll finally wear mask saw serious taking compared her. I’ve trying tell wear one since March. aware. However, study prednisone, would probably prove even effective. Why? 
Hyuck hyuck measks arrr baaad, teerump rooles aind blue lives mattuh

Oh aind ahm uh raciest buht ah see theyr point handout pay taxes lol. gonna total less $2,400 get, calm horses. Ok, hospital left Cleveland 100+ admitted, line door testing. cherry picking fun? fact cases go up, hospitalizations follow. 

What curve flattening going on? drive bars 250-500 people masks every time go get curbside, seems like things spiking mitigation, opposite talking about. 

Just want pandemic over, nothing make true. look graphs show this, read detailed, expert analysis is. Rejecting know better absurd. walk around day meeting assholes, asshole, speak. Probably overrun hospitals triaging ICU status. county gone 70% 80% 90% ICU occupancy, rising. We've called health emergency begging people stay home wear masks. exactly stuck, 15% like second highest day Go Trump! This.... forgot /s egghead, four-eyed epidermis colored charts fancy letters told that, reckon. Well colors need red, white, blue, letters need 'U', 'S', 'A'!  I'm beginning wonder they're refusing acknowledge anything avoid liability, also makes wonder there's case made--if so, hope eventual class actions workers customers. drivers passengers deserve safe environment, Uber responsibility ensure workers customers alike. 

As writing response, ticket closed without word. No, months various people avoiding hospitals chest pains gradual climb.

The heart attack patients don’t arrive generally die quickly.

And know lot shown didn’t.

That’s certainly discrepancy.

In addition lower traffic meaning lower fatalities accidents there’s likely deaths causes gap what’s normally expected.

But months people fearing ER definitely kills slowly. hows testing though? YoUnG pEoPlE saying Trump's done great job. wife work separate hospitals increase substantial, whatever numbers read, I'd take grain salt. come work us see getting hand, first hand Current covid hospitalizations per 1 mil population

New York peak: 940

New York now: 45 1.8-2.8 times neutralizing antibodies chadox-vaccinated patients compared recovered patients. Small sample size. sickness injection. sub fine baseball football coming, given data says mass gatherings outside  worry hard-hit areas closing beaches make beaches remaining open crowded, push people bars, restaurants, indoor parties. Bars lives. kill people alcoholism bad cops kill innocent. testing increases March account lot increase cases seen. example antibody testing NY shows around 4 million cases there, 10x confirmed number via testing.

You testing much back werent picked up, testing picking lot cases. expected deaths rise case increases actually lower last week far trending overall. 

No need panic yet. Wear mask, keep distance, wash hands. read thread responding to? Yeah it’ll probably poorly enforced. I’ve using Uber Lyft since 15. 49,752. counties left report? Santa Barbara report anything yesterday. would students bright enough get Cornell? wish true. followers care. rather deal ""let evil liberals"" win.

They chance victory firing voters chose vote 2016. need give reason get there.

If know someone chose vote 2016, get case. give pass. That's definitely gonna husband's favorite too! Lol.

We local bar visit frequently, obviously though, make drinks best I'm excited able get without go sit down. 😂 Meanwhile people packing bars speak. balls he'd shut down. definitely. frustrating part people piss away sacrifices everyone made last couple months. one-way car rental driving possibility? mostly agree, really phenomenon nowadays: Gates screwing us pandemic, Al Gore getting rich hoax (\\s), etc. Yeah saw articles earlier thought you, seems they're using misleading headlines. Here's full LA times article anyone paywalled: here's source scientific study article hope true well, historically rises cases deaths lagged 7 days, bee 2 weeks since start rise cases. free riiidddeee, already paid! weird LA taking seriously considering liberal area. People Bay Area still taking seriously overall, feel like Bay Area last part california still taking seriously That's amazing allows deliveries in. kind though. know god protect sit train tracks see would much different. downvoted recommending hoarding. stop it. Considering kings island opens tomorrow, friends lying Even conspiracy (that it’s ploy save Social Security) bit far fetched — even worst case scenario, it’s unlikely enough elderly people would die save program significant amount money. Plus, savings likely offset millions COVID survivors may drawing SSDI decades.

The real conspiracy ruling class okay death toll 1-2 million, ultimately means afterwards still 326 million Americans around continue buying stuff, dead won’t around complain. Well I've read number cases might 10 times higher currently reported, kinda makes sense. risk infecting loved ones make believe.. got it. wonder who's funding this. benefits? (Other Putin.) article:

Researchers found excess number deaths normal levels also exceeded attributed Covid-19, leading conclude many fatalities likely caused coronavirus confirmed. 

Hello?! Read 10 times come tell didn’t assume excess deaths COVID. actually prayed (He doesn't.), he'd praying disappears.

Not cares people getting sick dying.

But hurting him: re-election chance. Trump cares what's what's good him. think last time ate inside McDonald's kid. go drive-thru times month, though. Brazil starting make us sweat, went full speed ahead. heads up, going criticize people dumb maybe good idea use, ""too,"" properly.   Nothing complain here. $4400/month UI nice lasted, I'll fine base rate ($2000/month). I'm sure find something suitable runs Feb.  Placebo? Texas didnt meet federal requirements long shot opened up, reason covid virus spike... duh. lt. governor trying make people forget didnt listen shuck blame away... abbots fault pushing reopen, everyone dead ill texas know blame, Gov president obviously worships... Honestly, give chance respond. angry slammed door walked away. Let's pour one international residents. Found George Bush’s reddit name. Ah gotcha! Yeah started well month ago well (at least think that's was, time feels like loop moment). fantastic. Ordering margaritas mexican take new favorite thing. SC native, I've always said Myrtle Beach plague. never thought statement would literal. Me, too! think so. anyway, chinese tourists want come spend money allow China, plays benefit. friend lives Berlin, New Hampshire. hard make German jokes whenever talk.  playground good toddlers. anytime lately future obviously. normal times. Imagine downvoting someone disagree them. Agreed fellow doctor. Hopefully one day instances like much common coming future would agree you, except scientific studies say true. assumed protests would cause spikes. also assumed Trump rallies lockdown would cause spike. science saying happen.

And provide sure seem think know lot virus. see medical degree? 

Especially great ideas “Let run young people, barely harms them” “these ‘long-term effects’ bullshit”

You truly seem understand nothing COVID. Pure ignorance. think know better healthcare professionals? You’re talking someone works COVID unit. **Fly drive?**

I posted reply below, thought post independently since distance different:

My GF considering driving LA SF back (800 miles, total) get 24-yer-old son, flying son one-way SF LA. keep telling flying son back alone safer option, especially since flying time hour.

Driving: would car (no symptoms, unknown infection-status) seven hours. would wear N95 masks. four-door sedan (Ford Fusion). would backseat. assume would least two public bathroom breaks per person gas station.

Flying: would fly solo SFO LAX N95 eye-protection. 3M respirator P100 filters goggles could FedEx him, think would wear them. Flight time hour. Unfortunately restaurant owners choose greed human lives.

If places open everyone working blood hands. Louder ever. knows who's charge. Best ad I've seen yet.  Bare numbers tell full picture even they're reasonably accurate. dig reporting specifics (e.g. there's lot variation countries attribute fatalities coronavirus), speed testing turn-around, statistics excess mortality antibody testing any, region-to-region variation bigger countries, that's assuming data intentionally mis-reported. obviously want continue bagging China maybe go back r/China_Flu . know give shit anti-Chinese resentment, justified ways, contributed racism family experiencing US. get random comments ""fucking Chinese"", glares complete strangers, way look. yeah, know words contribute hate affects people around world. US going horror show 4th July factored this. could relatively handled monumental cataclysmic failure current administration paired widespread prideful ignorance staggering level we’re heading path suffering dysfunction scale seen US soil century.

The winter going absolutely brutal beyond words Thanksgiving Christmas exert toll. think problem aren’t great protecting *you*. everyone wears one, protect others, slows things lot regardless whether wear correct on. 

The people care informed. rest blindly trusting trump. Wrong. prove anything. said ‘think’.

They start assumption excess deaths due COVID. say ‘most’ gap excess COVID direct indirect COVID. 

There implicit assumption excess deaths must COVID. not, comparing actual Covid deaths vs excess deaths?

My gosh, isn’t hard see. daddy Xi/Pooh military. You’ll take right rear. Also, time GA reopened, everyone thought wild places weren’t opening even allowed. FL, TX, AZ opened suddenly seemed like everyone relaxed again, felt comfortable, started going out. Yes, protests literally thing that’s changed US last 6 weeks so. funny title focuses ""the virus disappear"" (which could defended, technically true), focusing ""we're good"" (which blatant lie...).


Although... I'm 2nd thoughts... maybe uses royal ""we"", true la-la-land he's well... Lord gonna work mysterious ways. good luck enforcing it. volunteers ones writing tickets? ...She’s like Black Mirror fanfiction bit... think worry would PR cuts ways depending who’s listening.

I think it’s employees’ benefit. Really promising results. Significantly, looks like vaccine works lower doses initially expected. press release contains update production expectations, targetting 100 million doses 2020 1.2 billion doses end 2021. numbers double previous projections. Great news. Antibody testing somewhat controversial moment. technically yes, positive antibody test could help confirm suspicion patient previously infected, factors make accuracy questionable. different categories antibodies, within those, antibodies may overlap coding. Even antibody may specific certain bacteria virus, look quite similar others terms structural makeup. 

When test antibodies, targeting specific markers would linked specific virus (in case, COVID-19). problem is, COVID-19 specific strain Coronavirus, family viruses containing 1,000s strains. top that, coronavirus strains share similarities viruses similar shape size. Since antibody testing new, specific markers haven’t yet readily identified consistent way, higher risk antibody test could falsely positive actually identifies antibody someone may different virus.

To compare something simpler terms, imagine warehouse full 1,000 piece jigsaw puzzles. Every puzzle except 1-2 pieces make unique others. Now, given photo specific puzzle tasked find exact match. may able rule several unique tag puzzle, others look similarly enough make harder find right one. isn’t perfect analogy, helps make biochemistry practical.

I suppose didn’t need give long-winded explanation, hate paternalistic nature “Yes/No Im doctor hurr durr.” want someone say, tell do. want someone learn something themselves, tell way. case, hope helps answer question.

Tl;dr - COVID-19 Antibody testing still somewhat unreliable now. get better testing improves, wouldn’t recommend moment. Almost 100 ICU's taken too.  took action Friday mandating masks statewide. Hopefully start. disagree basically everything said except first sentence. Yes, connected; yes, important consider, yes, absence 1 2 others must go on. I'm seeing that's relevant.

Allow try again. 3 cornerstones equal right? Otherwise would have, say 2 cornerstones 1 minor supporting structure. I'm claiming patient value clearly clinical expertise, patient value clearly research evidence.

Similarly, evidence clearly value, evidence clearly expertise.

Similarly, expertise clearly value. Following exact trend, expertise evidence.

.

I'm saying clinical expertise important useful. Clearly is. Im saying I'd rather random joe treat rather doctor. Clearly don't. I'm saying evidence, that's i'm saying. I'm excited! :D point that's people saying past two weeks two weeks on. man, thank kind post. means lot. like there's much want say since close epicenter whole ordeal. literally living Korea, first country majorly hit back february family China. now, know getting downvoted makes feel bad lol. company going first company wide person staff meeting (usually 3 hours) safety protocols spacing, masks, could remove mask speaking people could hear you.

I really don’t think people grasping masks for. Massachusetts also show ZOOM held. Coincidence? think not! Evolution amazing That’s opened bars 😉 UK economy tatters. 6000 high street job losses yesterday. going take years UK recover. Hopefully Americans start wearing masks Americans businesses start falling wayside. lying lol? look numbers yourself.

It everything number 50,000. read wrote understand lmao!

If test more, find cases. doesnt mean total number infected higher means found them. Sorry yeah that’s meant original post. meant see could endanger drivers. chiming I’m issue dash cam general.  nobody takes seriously, racist bullshit People color, except get call everyone makes happy.

Imagine trying call white people People color Whitx, they'd take tiki torches guns. Trump gonna sign McXecutive Order force open. 621k today vs 512k last week. 

8.5% positive today vs 7.6% last week. entitled opinion. Let point actually good estimate risk contracting coronavirus taking flight days, can't reliably judge whether worth not. Oh oh. got this:

* 500 cases - 5 weeks
* 250 cases - 2.5 weeks

I’m right aren’t I? It’s cool don’t need congratulate smarts. best smarts.

Edit: apologies, assumed satire palpable enough necessitate clarification. Honestly good wifi, usually pretty clean decent area, get coffee breakfast sandwich like $2.50. definitely worse places spend lunch break nearby. Well, guess choice go drinking indoor bar! TIL Moscow, Idaho.  RemindMe! 2 weeks ""check thread"" fiancee received $1,200 each. answer next question saved I've known since March company losing big going get laid off. I'm claiming lol, I'm saying I've read articles saying mutating little parts it. Google coronavirus mutating. guess tell strains China vs Italy whatever.

And FYI, I'm really good medical stuff believe largely understanding half sentence. I'm trying learn here. ""mild infection"" still including lung scarring multiple forms later health impacts. we're viewing months out.

There studies finding 50% possibly even asymptomatic cases still lung damage, minor enough noticed, massive impacts lung capacity later life. Fuck I'll early adopter

Fuck hell care 10% recipients died I'll still take rather wait another 6 months Case counts grim milestones. It’s infectious virus IFR people 60 we’ll .1%. cases increasing again? really since it'll mean another slight rise deaths. slight good news rise deaths probably bad levels saw April. sure that's good news I'll give that. point control. excuse isn't. One major hospitals area driving thru testing wound tested everyone wanted/felt need get tested. get tested got $0 bill due government funding. didn’t SOB chest pain fever, etc. reason wanted get tested bc severe migraine kinda mimicked signs/symptoms. Arms legs feeling like weighed 1000 lbs lost sense taste around 3 days. miss part large gatherings? 

 *ain't nobody got time fo dat*  Okay, yeah. I'll pass, thanks! I’m SB please stay home don’t need ppl spreading here. mention 4th July celebrations cancelled already. 

Stay Safe Stay Home please. \o/ funny thing economic distress actually leading ultra rich acquiring wealth thru devaluation various assets owned poorer people can't sit survive current crisis financially. cancer screening put nearly three months now. screening brought specific reason, routine one. POSSIBLE could end death (unlikely). 

But reason still COVID, right? screening (a damn colonoscopy, I'm looking forward to) would done coronavirus. Pittsburgh area seeing somebody wearing mask like seeing unicorn Jeeez. bet everyone super understanding health issues, too, right?? \**internal weeping*\*

Do doctors think flu/swine flu combo may set domino effect? 

I've got Idiopathic Hypersomnia, there's whole lot information (for example, I'm treated Narcolepsy, have), thoughts matter mostly risen theoretical reason. Preachin' choir here.

In teens, ended hospital two weeks viral pneumonia caused influenza. lungs permanently scarred, coupled pectus excavatum, 60% lung capacity. 0/10 recommend, affected whole rest life (I'm almost 45 now). 

I almost died.

The anti-maskers it's-no-worse-than-flu crowd infuriate me. You, PERSONALLY, part problem. Fuck property value. Alabama: folks mind bottom socioeconomic development long great college football team. Anyone types words ""*Taxis fine""* never use taxi, worry money.

Call cab, even busy city, knows it'll arrive? Maybe late night, arrive, hunt one manually. Want travel kilometer two? Guess that's $20. Longer? Literally worth taking.

I even use Uber phone, obviously place market. Taxis basically legalized robbery Uber/Lyft services came along.  see, define threshold mandating masks lockdowns (illegal earn living) oh let’s forget suspending freedom religion (although that’s probably pouty). I’m sure made protesting illegal last month, temporarily suspending freedom speech, people would come undone. Look , wear mask whenever public spaces counter argument, people also stay inside feel unsafe venturing outdoors. main point I’m concerned restrictions defined, even little. Every American should, IMO greatly concerned government restrictions implemented discretion. also believe diligent part safe keep others safe. Yep, tennessee went 400 day 2 weeks ago 1000 day, 1800+ Nah, parents 70s several co-morbidities would feel guilty forever gave them. Though depends prevalent is. He'll change mind week two. man consistency, policy, beliefs, morals. He'll say first thing comes mind, regardless is, try convince he's wrong, harder he'll push it.

I guarantee, weeks aides trying get wear mask refusing, woke morning said ""I've got great idea, wear mask!"" acted like idea along. Georgia seem bad others. 'open' LONG time Atlanta never really opened allowed to. (besides protests..) I'm saying shining star means think general things better many Southern states

Most surge rural counties lower density probably explains took long numbers start going up. Death rates GA pretty steady along April 1st terms 7 day moving avg. It’s mild infection people. Protect nursing homes. Wear masks. Close bars fine. don’t allow 100k people streets protesting either. gonna out? Thanks this. remember early African country 0 cases asked health minister said. “We tests”. suspect accurate way compare countries even challenging. made hungry double cheeseburger. Goddammit. :p

I anything come box since started. restaurants. getting old. would 500k infected today. exactly it. Folks know actually making money drive-thru, takeout delivery ever dining room open.

Labor %'s levels seen 5+ years. sad thing could easily spin religious people. Oh discovered this, God awesome making us smart! Oh look totally wrong regarding X, praise lord giving us wisdom see truth!

I'm atheist science geek, I'd totally OK that. believe God made us everything, hey God also made ultimate puzzle, universe live in? Cool man, thing get it. Let's talk common ground have. 

But particular group religious, type go full crazy ignorant it. sad. Idiots. People rural areas also need realize time lot cases late. Deaths staggering rural areas taking precautions. There's one small size hospital two rural mini hospitals county. There's approximately 25k people county. doubt there's ten ventilators three hospitals. I've heard one hospital even ventilator. three hospitals life watch critical patients. hospital without ventilator send kid broken collarbone. give anything pain anything help him. That's poorly equipped are. 

Most rural areas similar ours. takes hold rural areas, death tolls rise pretty fast. Yet people around seem think rural means safe. Please ignore ignorance, pays that?? LMAO really expecting last sentence! Fair enough guess! instance doubt could come play power benevolence god, lean ""mysterious ways"" explanations. 


You explain away anything, regardless horrible internalizing idea happened to; teach valuable lesson, restore faith, punish deserving, prevent larger horror. Since literally impossible point know *graciously* saved from, optimistically retain faith. 


In childhood(Southern Baptist), reasoning usually leaning punishing unfaithful, they'd use negative life experiences shame people deserved whatever happened holy warning. 5th Dentist paid lobbyist industry causing issue. shit true illegal drugs. Totally unenforceable. Occasionally catch someone, often simply chance. Meanwhile bet advocating legalization drugs time soon... hard job. say ""yes/no sir"". take order customer POS, food pass customer, check POS customer back. pure service-sector job skills. requires providing good customer service, pretty much every service job.

EDIT: CoL. waiter live downtown SF, want find 3+ roommates. Waiters able afford roommates. Instead waiters get paid less customers keep money. googled curiosity take away excess deaths study pneumonia related. deaths kind study goes far admit way knowing many excess deaths directly Covid19. couple major factors play. Cry snowflake Also surpassed global record 195 855.

We could synchronise grim 200 000 world/ 50 000 US Milestone. Hidalgo trying, even though Abbot seems happy throw money wrenches way. There's good ones left. Nah. believe happening. think big deal. 1000 people hospital 30M. understand (and experienced first-hand) fewer orders drinks takeout person sitting restaurant. 

We already drinks home, grocery store. need figure going southern hospitals collapse time- things going get badly quickly. valves? guarantee you: prize money involved ABSOLUTELY taking seriously. would need build crazy amount testing facilities order possible. Depressing. hey! save money gas going out. Exactly like that. I'm seeing 6,307 worldometers Seriously folks, drink home like self-respecting alcoholics Lol allow it. Apparently spectator sports still illegal SC right (inside events cool though) even real college, cousins go fuck 4 years? Ahh genetic. seems like never ends. think thinking person would see happen many times it. baked DNA guess snake acts like snake. TWO WEEKS WAIT EVERYONE DIE they're meeting soon. cute. good news? No? calling out? Poor baby. fragile ego. talking going fourth July one bdays near future. They're lying.. specific. awesome see Radio real local news!! History said would happen. shit envy jobs governors right now. matter they're going ton people screaming either enough much. varies population demographic country.

Singapore 44 k 26 deaths. reputable testing regime None anything fact number new confirmed cases coronavirus US 50,000 today record normalize increased testing compared earlier year see things right worse deaths way down.

You lying.  You’ve reported. qualms expressing opinion. Literally conjecture though, may want point out. virus definitely disappear doubt  say uber paid it. said logo probably ordered distributing drivers. honestly care paid.

I would show picture, take one (oh no, karma lost :) can't find online. announcement cars aviable - called uber shield want look it. side committed side fervency belief eradication doubt

Please, spare us ""both sides"" enlightened centrist bullshit. Yes, humans general often strongly-held beliefs tend form groups shun outside views, apply here. side equally-valid viewpoint/argument climate change pandemic. One side backed facts, logic scientific consensus, not. one side currently living reality, guarantee side that's constantly tearing environmental regulations screaming masks government overreach. Same, got notified today covid killed company. last paycheck yesterday! Oh perfect timing cause renewed lease can't afford UI. think social media cable news back then, helped limit spread crazy ideas. priest blow virus away haven’t seen data likely get “real sick”, case fatality rate. dying doesn’t mean symptomless case. “Mild” case means didn’t require hospitalization - worst agony life 2 weeks nearly drowning lung fluid, left chronic illness lung function 65 year old still “mild” case. Nobody reported things common people 20s). get mad labor accepting better deal employers refuse match it? workers supposed accept whatever crumbs tumble way? Congress based $600 thought acceptable amount live US. Anyone making less exploited, fault people taking bag. Mission accomplished!!!!!

/s They’re contractors (1099) - obligation health care contractor. Uber following law. 

The issue fact rely private companies private health care instead universal care. they're actually turtles disguise I'm definitely repeating thread, vaccine approved last hurdle

It producing vaccine, producing glass vials, tubing, syringes, etc. get people. numerous articles explaining this, recently last week. Even vaccine fall, physically means transport administer Keep up, might get designated antifa. what’s wrong America. 57 / 8076 = 0.706% 1-day case mortality rate

2,499 / 171,031 = 1.46% case mortality rate total

That seems ridiculously low. went cases. know majority young people, still feels off. ~7.4% overall. 

Nationally: 127,299 / 2,624,873 = 4.85% case mortality rate

A state large number cases national average. what's messing Texas? MLB intends start playing soon. bet manage two weeks playing. Yeah here, Australia least makeshift barrier would, I'm mistaken need ADR approved meet relevant specs.  


In crash barriers become deadly, use plastic sheeting, suffocation risk etc etc.

&amp;#x200B;

There's reason standards. Dr Fauci warn US could soon see 100k cases. continues rise may well right. don’t think subordinates change mind something like this. Somehow feel someone views nearly power equal adversary. normal mind tricks worked would switch claimed invent masks May numbers cdc talking heads spit would ‘lives trump masks’ saved. many tests done today? compare earlier year need normalize testing rate. maximum amount get per month florida $3,500. opt taxes taken get max $3,150. Im getting 3 checks month, $2,400. Let tax money work hard times dude. Ive worked hard everything point, im mooch. someone got caught bad spot pandemic.  Exactly. *did* stop mask mandates West Palm direct quote resident recent town hall meeting Patterns repeated. lesson learned. comment right people, Pennsyltucky. thing going countries percent population 65+ relatively low. 7.2% Mexico 4.4% Guatemala. Italy (was?) 22.8%.

But clearly spreading quickly countries still going problem, doubt. #PulledACrosby like 1 flu worth basically It’s state Ohio website somewhere get Spectrum news updates numbers daily released State  humbly suggest Karens around long, long time getting attention now. May odds favors?  guess stop worrying it? Hopefully staying away everyone party like that.... definitely upper percentile grandmas.  even Vanilla Ice 1990's, except punchline sellout losers. tf still bottom 10 states testing per capa putting numbers... cases started rising around 3 weeks ago. deaths lag. reckon middle month end month we'll see deaths rise. Probably levels saw May since think mainly young catching now. we'll probably see slight rise deaths. Either way definitely good news especially countries badly hit April/May seen steady decrease cases. *Excess* operative word cell phones. what?  Tryanny!

SLASH OBVIOUS. report him. received canned response Uber, maybe someone actually read it. 2008 toddler? 14 interested housing markets? Pretty impressed!  Yeah I’m calling BS one. Worldometer lists official tally 6301, quick check major counties numbers suggests it’s likely around mark. Yesterday saw post stating California’s total 8300 one day, yet ended 5600. day stated high 7000’s, ended low 6000. There’s source that’s stating CA 9000. 

Also, posted 6 hours ago? That’s counties even report even reopenings cautious venture out. don’t trust fellow man take responsibility. Oh absolutely. 3/4 household would potentially really hard time virus. locked down. Ah. Well, true month ago, least Florida. 

BUT! now, I'd say 90% patients come us least *foggy* idea got it, proven positive case exposed to. Additionally, testing timing seems 1 week exposure. reason? Family, pushing testing due fear, symptoms, employment requirements. Problem: taking days find testing center. cannot get DOH ( lines busy) even know call DOH. Problem: 1 week might good testing, *for 1 WEEK persons interacting family members, coworkers, friends.* *not* wearing masks family friends. 

Finally, people unaware must go home stay away others; I'd say half going back work continuing associate others. Makes sense me.  wife getting paid much much that, mean concerned much people getting temporary basis unemployment PANDEMIC Lol

The people making decisions incomprehensible wealth whatever gap someone receiving unemployment wife, laughing us squabble kinds crumbs making bank. deserve better, let's focus real power fucked crises bad. *(If anyone wondering, direct quotes West Palm residents)*  Oh, read Secret. explains lot.  World Meters US 50k new confirmed cases coronavirus today, record. 3 year old.  It’s nearly glorious you’re thinking. thoughts then? 1 year entire country infected? 1 month? 2 years? 5? based what? 

As said, I’m speculating purely current facts today, right now. taking account speculative exponential spread one see future. pandemic uptick people falling windows... Thanks reply! I'm leaning toward son flying wants drive ways. def. hit high notes. want add American Aquarium. every way? No. Hell no. 

In significant ways? Yes. comes virus, amazing people complained much CCP's information Trump administration completely derelict/absent/lying it. [This CDC data, going even accounting 63% U.S. deaths reported within 10 days date death, significant variation states.  CVS   feel pain. Quite literally, actually. I've tested lupus like 4 5 times. end day, really seem matter new pre-existing autoimmune disease, still left treating whatever shitty symptom decides pop rather able prevent them. use site, maybe others comment trustworthiness.
http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/ People Pittsburgh actively coughing eachother wearing masks scarves  It... didn’t? rising second wave worse! crap stressful! Peruvian Flute Band help? Holy shit, I'm starting think there's pro-china bot here, downvoting everything makes China look bad. hell downvoted too?

Not weld houses shut, basically made illegal sick. suspected coronavirus, literally put quarantine box, shipped off. 

NOBODY wanted get sick cuz stuff like that. personal health safety. basically arrested. made extremely inconvenient sick, people naturally believed ended making people sick, could held legally liable. I'm working Korea right now, company bulletin saying went nightclubs hit coronavirus report authorities, would lose job ever discovered sick coronairus. asian countries got people board. made financial legal repercussions serious.

And then, discovered people thought visited gay night clubs days off. night club Seoul potential 2nd gigantic wave gay night clubs gay saunas. Thus, nobody wanted self report. everybody HR nice long list gay/bi swingers working HQ. 

and Now, never write anything without sources.

Article regarding Itaewon nightclub scene: attest, gay community Korea thriving relatively quiet part society. gay, there's LOTS ways get action. 

And here, i've uploaded video JANUARY suspected Coronavirus case Chinese airport, can't remember one. kinds videos circulating even back then. NOBODY wanted get another Alabama thing.    Let's go full contageon It’s Trump, I’m surprised all. man doesn’t mental capacity deal this. Hopefully he’ll stay Pence attempt salvage remains. I’m fan least he’s willing publicly wear mask. roads lead back orange.. Sadly, no, Karen’s quite resilient. 😉

Their victims? There’ve several year, stats going back lacking.  Would dangerous go indoor mall walk only? Keep distance, enter shops? really hot live, mom wants go walk somewhere.. Also, apologies advance, english first language. Possible scary real, sent text everyone austin days ago testing limited people symptoms again. 

Again, bad scary, rate technically jump higher test symptomatic people. 

We remember every positive test means roughly 10 positive cases haven’t counted. That’s scary part. got wanted! Congrats!  know Georgia report recovered cases there's way anyone track that. mean, guess subtract dead total cases would recovered, wait while. given everyone 600. way fair everyone. Fyre festival 2 Looks like Dr fauci may right US could see 100k cases day. take advantage lockdowns early aggressively testing contact tracing isolating. whole point lockdown, across nation.  Corona-virus baby! *moviephone voice* NEW RECORD, hot new competition 2nd July take even higher?

Tune tomorrow results!!!

(Mask wearing European here... jokes aside, I'm worried good Americans I'm seeing masks, crying w local reporters feel hopeless like problem wanting social disance wearing masks. almost insane think get shunned mask wearing still stage 5 reopening I've heard people asking others take steps back...) feel ya. Good luck work, hopefully something comes through. long term effects covid? like whole asbestos thing 40 years later find population bad really is? 

There's second wave... third fourth wave? contained time? 

How close we, realistically finding cure covid? developed 2 strains 3 strains... close developing 4 strains? realistically develop cure covid develops another strain/multiple strains? 

Masks... effective DIY masks? effective surgical masks? I've read odd things said neither effective full virus masks masks effective keeping people safe covid virus taken eyes via droplets, gas sweat etc infected person... true this? safe effective masks keeping us safe?

*I'm SA, Australia. infection case awhile. partner quarantined multiple times since covid started works warehousing area. I'm largely affected want know situation questions regarding situation.* :) I'm amazed number people pro life certain lives. Unborn perhaps common, elderly neglected, immigrants, prisoners, infirm... Aka least HIV deadlier spread legally California. Allegheny resident here. think one main problems shutdown/healthcare system super effective things right get-go went red. Unfortunately, led lot people believe virus big deal, worse - hoax. Even one friends nurse like... ""The virus bad thought was. afford relax."" church (of 250 people normally) meeting in-person since went yellow they're hardly following guidelines. Definitely masks main sanctuary I'd say majority people coming one, room prefer wear masks. I'm worried congregation voiced concerns, seem unwilling admit there's real risk. Seeing comments reading article, incredibly grateful job have. company work absolutely great. ball getting us office folks working home. repeatedly stated they're following local, state federal reopening guidelines, they're following ensure every employee safe. probably means we'll continue working home year. 

My wife worked part time salary. Seasonal part time taxes. able stay home three kids help home school work job day.

I know I'm incredibly lucky many people worse off. whole thing really highlighted shitty lot things US. kids, wife job. free all. wasnt set way, lack leadership, lack president brain, can't even bring wear mask. lot 0 capacity first place though. looking good they're setting records day, they're going building field hospitals soon. racism/prejudice. Gates propoganda ridiculous, get Africans keen test subjects given fraught history.

As usual education always key. Officially fall semester, unofficially, faculty staff warned plan whole academic year. Daaamn. 
My brother went work isolation gig NBA playoffs Disney 3 months. They’re making quarantine 7 days hotel room set arenas n stuff. 3 meals day delivered hotel room. Can’t leave receive mail. Wild stuff man. !remindme 1 week We're #1! We're #1!  single parent household, confirm. Especially child pre-k (going kindergarten) literally sit make sure goes school work. literally don’t time anything else I’m tending her. reap sow... speaks distant we've become other, think. hard let people bubble, hard trust people, hard take initiative. seems working well them, though! say sometimes stressors that's expected right now. I'd really love see take off!  Great point! think one biggest challenges U.S. lack consistent messaging leadership risks virus advantages wearing masks.

Imagine this.. could actually see virus particles coming someone's cough see virus floating around air, want cover mouth nose socially distance others? course would!

So think one reasons lack compliance plain simple lack understanding second amongst others lack belief science experts saying.

-Dr. Kohli agree, also feel like new set issues would arise. There's reason there's literally news articles leaked messages hospital admin Texas think handle increases they'd expect next week. Yeah 450 ICU nurses, doctors, staff manage beds coming from? thought steriods prevented coronavirus. I've wondering tentacles causes growing red blood cells blood vessels leading clots.

 Well point, comparing Sweden Russia comparing apples oragnes. Sweden best compared Nordics, fails miserably comparison. think evidence higher case rate Germany. basically intensive care beds taken COVID-19 patients. days single death attributed COVID-19. hidden cases, hospitalization data excess death rate show that, right?

Lower testing probably reflects lower prevalence symptoms summer. Less people want get test, presumably less people experience coughs / fevers etc. wanted could get test. people (e.g. nurses) get tested anyway. Still case numbers keep going down. used think like you. assured people pandemics naturally end short term affairs. look around you. Everywhere they’ve opened up, comes right back. virus relentless unlike anything we’ve ever seen. really hope pray right, I’m worried you’re not. call fear mongering disgusting also call deniers disgusting denial lead bad choices get people sick.

We’re handling well. honestly think are? hit 50k new cases yesterday man. 50k. Think that. We’re longer even trying slow spread society. makes optimistic 1-2 year ordeal? Seriously going half year far makes think it’s nearly over? We’re setting daily records new case counts without showing signs subsiding. 

Again really hope you’re right everything see telling we’re going new normal, stuff isn’t going back way before! really wish anything it’s not!

Our best hope vaccine. type mitigation completely rejected. Hospital administrators advocated staff Thank taking time answer questions!
How convince someone take seriously? Even event know person spent significant time with, car, tested positive symptoms. simply don’t understand many us don’t care could vectors disease vulnerable populations. forget factory/manufacturing work, ""suitable"" women. I'm thinking mostly textile industries. useful, thank you. According article ""He contracted coronavirus staff member nursing home."" least information presented already hospice. went nursing home, hospital, hospice. listened idea symptoms even loss smell taste. still went without mask, got hairdresser sick even went visit best friend best friends pregnant daughter without mask. matter know still wasnt following guidelines exposed people. Exactly tell us follow guidelines! Also, tested positive doctor flat refused test said stay away still wanted come next treatment could've possibly infected cancer patients! Kaiser ridiculous. go get county test confirm refused test. median salary teachers masters degree nationwide $65,000. median salary nationwide person master's degree field $78,000. quite gap.

I lucky work State district quite high paying, meaning near top salary scale, exceed national median people level education. fact, however, means teachers country graduate degrees yet make less 50k. first-grade daughter playing Animal Crossing couple hours daily, reading's actually improved ever expected since wants understand dialogue game. 

I mean, ideal, least getting benefit it. mean Picard  article :

""The mask be-all end-all,” said. “All things need put together.”""  Year?? semester “Who watch nanny’s kids watches mine??” Maybe... watch together fall? r/antinatalism sad thing really Picture condition. Gasping breath dying medicated comfort. Eating never option issue. wasn’t earlier. found Oregon day first case NYC. Oregon closed schools day two NYC. read Wikipedia articles want. many news articles well. nothing far FL
 
They're lying it. muzzled coroners coroners #s added higher ""official"" death toll. suspiciously high number pneumonia deaths. 
 
And there's conflicting numbers rumors surrounding properly counting deaths long-term care facilities published numbers... also really want another reason money. I’m work due COVID. wanted kids closer age it’s going happen sucks. Could lot worse, still hard. :/ waste words. Education decline decades, dogma unchallenged critical thinking replaced it. He's pointing finger, completely unaware pointing system applying beliefs. can't argue delusion.

It clear for-profit system *can* fail Italy's socialized system has, right now. Neither system resilient pandemic surges like see here.  You’re right. probably survivors Tide Pod challenge decided bring idiocy next level. talking bro- laterally hospital empty. capacity they'd covid patients sitting floor waiting room laying tables behind desk. conspiracy bro, one's actually sick want money... something like that... 
^that's ^a ^big ^/s ^if ^anyone ^is ^curious Liberal states cities better overall they'll willing react outbreaks reimpose lockdowns pressure. economic pressures open numbers go still there. States balance budgets. Period. They're looking mass layoffs losing essential services can't figure things too. mention enforcement requires buy data point to. I'm safety, federal government needs send way money. 

But CA good example dichotomy. They're resurgence, they're reacting much sooner stronger Florida huge outbreaks. also false *entirely* call conservative/ liberal dichotomy. We've seen governors exceptions make surprisingly good (Dewine closed many things early Ohio) bad (Cuomo fucked nursing homes regrets that) moves, we'll continue see too. 70% people aspirate fluid deep sleep? Source please. someone thinks strep, probably see primary care provider. could predicted this?! promised, opening new “good news” thread (much needed right now, would argue) new milestone previously considered plausible reached Italy: entire country, less 1,000 patients remain hospitals (963 today). those, one also add however 83 patients ICUs (still declining 5-6 per days).

Italian values peak (end March): 4,000 ICUs, 28,000 hospitals, 700-900 daily deaths, 82,000 self-isolation, around 6,000 new daily cases, 105,000 active cases

**Today 07/02** currently active cases: 15,060, 83 ICUs, 963 hospitals, 14,015 self-isolation mild symptoms without symptoms. 30 deaths, 201 new cases. (Of active cases, 9,827 Lombardy)

Since February: Total cases: 240,961 total deaths: 34,818 total recoveries: 191,083

I keep updating good news milestones reached rather everyday keep attention higher everyday getting better better although occasional clusters far however contained.

Several regions reported **zero** new cases: province Bolzano, Aosta Valley, Calabria, Molise, Basilicata. **Two** active cases remain Basilicata, **three** Aosta Valley

Next milestones plausibly reached: 0 ICUs, day 0 deaths, 0 active cases region, less 10,000 active cases total. think eliminated completely numbers high, optimistic go 10,000 active cases reach 0 several regions South. really wish countries took notes. Remember, main effect lockdown halt virus south Milan, result largely achieved.

Now positive notes: new cases keep remaining 150-200 daily go further. Half new cases Lombardy. However, consider 1) 1/3 cases identified following antibody tests (if antibodies must take regular test, test positive considered new case, although clear whether contagious). 2) new cases mild require hospitalization. reason happens uncertain would deserve treated different topic. 3) Consider declared recovered Italy must test negative twice row, process takes sometimes months although thought people contagious two weeks experience symptoms. also means new identified cases could contracted covid two months ago rather recently (as antibody situation Lombardy shows).

I hope Italy keeps guard keeps mandatory masks order keep situation control. less 1,000 hospitals good news!

Edit: Spelling Yeah there’s global pandemic happening everyone make sacrifices right now. 

Why hard understand? apparently faculty staff Florida State. Damn. really wanted nba restart work it’s looking good. all.  Sweden something similar nearing capacity denied access care elderly, leaving die.

u/TenYearsTenDays Yeah positive percentage stays basically even double testing still bad. would freezing testing levels seeing percent positive climb. mask game, certainly way ahead us, too. mandatory inside. mostly everybody agrees that, people wear outside.

Also, beginning Pandemic weeks government advised mask-wearing. Probably, even enough medical staff. sorted out, government switched around. First saying might help, first papers pointed case, made mandatory inside.

Luckily, relevant anti-mask movement. article list official accounting day day activities either. go grocery shopping? visit people? make sure wash hands touching public doors? way much room doubt right call someone murderer facts sparse.  Guys guys, please relax. Didn’t hear great jobs report today? We’re reopening stronger ever virus gonna go away! email real. initially claimed email false bit. Yeah, successful scientist decades experience 'may' know little do. MAYBE. We've routinely hitting 8k 10k new cases per day LA county. Well, turtles original movies made Jim Henson. long it’s WWF I’m cool it. believe +10109 number comes FL residents non residents. FDOH report includes residents. look delta today yesterdays total case #, get something closer +10000. data reporting little “Young people”, “people Alabama” really similar categories, least buries lede substantially. Good question. I'm using surge spike characterize happening Colorado. seeing uptick cases however.  would say surge cases start go exponential fashion.  12% increase week. Household transmission guarantee. information research. Additionally, Fauci stated virus odd respect transmission. Known infected close contact vulnerable people spread infection. infected people known ""super spreaders"" infect abnormal amount people themselves. 

Moral story.....just friend's mom mean it. remembering scene I'm thinking Peggy. starts going John got headaches. Hank started worrying because, well, spells Peggy know. guys go talk front Bill's house Hank asks bothers anyone ""know Nancy Dale doesn't"". That's Bill plays stupid goes ""Nancy's affair John Redcorn? first I've heard shocked mean shocked that's mean APPALLED"" (Play play inflection added needed intensity excitement reader). people still dying droves feel sorry that. don’t deserve live country run villains populated bootlickers absolutely abysmal reporting. guys needs read get upset.

What doctor act compassion. Remdesivir save man. Intubation save man. Remdesivir even improve survival- reduces duration symptoms (has anyone actually read studies). density people theme park far less density grocery store nobody believes shutting down. medical professional said businesses going spread virus it’ll ones aren’t forced jump hoops order stay open. Grocery stores may say requiring social distancing one way aisles aren’t exactly held accountable Who's winning? People. bunch bastards. would like walk Cub find everyone inside wearing mask. AZ itself. can't lack leadership go crying Feds help. Federal government made pretty clear individual STATES gonna handle pandemic. one coming save anyone. part keep safe. get complacent, stay away people wear mask. Myopic Greed Yes too, people really wanted test! know NY state anyone get test?

I live Europe get free test symptoms now, beginning enough everyone, stories people faking symptoms get test, paying hundreds hundreds private company it. Bro, take basic logic course, comparisons use extreme examples, shows logical inconsistency. perfectly shows Dunning-Kruger effect. want call there's limited resources? tried preventing months ago people wanted freedoms. want call price freedom? thoughts mine want share models:

1) model perfect, definition. full intelligent scientific assumptions, assumptions nonetheless. 

2) Models meant adaptive. one biggest inputs models human behavior, keeps changing. inputs change, outputs change.

3) Models meant predict worst case scenario. good model makes us change behavior future predicted model never actually realized.

-Dr. Kohli really gonna need source something that... 21.5 million people live Florida. know, us. Sounds like you’re reading watching news aren’t. point it’s bit ridiculous say “covid isn’t thing” 125,000 dead *minimum*. It’s really sobering think it.

Yes do, trumploon, yes, indeed, simply quoted entire statement matter proof told people “ingest post proves you’re you’re trying gaslight others 

""No U"" valid argument, actually told people Clorox. Insane.

Your traitorous, senile, pedo-endorsing, racist, authoritarian, narcissist, pathologically lying, impeached-by-the-house cult leader suggested injecting disinfectant using UV light inside body might valid medical approach.

I used blatant rhetorical hyperbole explained much. rhetorical instrumentarium matches his: kindergarten.

But, appears need subjected phase 2. see I'm dealing terminal case.

He lunatic lunatic science-hating supporters. *AVGN entered chat* equating shelter luxury expenditure ludicrous Someone said we’re 3rd world wearing Gucci belt Sounds like sports. fuck question? Answer mine. Trump tell people ingest Clorox? answer I’ll answer yours. unconstitutional impose sort quarantine, according governor Cuomo. 10 days sickness turning point. Temp citation: iirc, 80% begin slow recovery day 10 need treatment. remaining approximate 20% end taking turn worse day 11 end hospital. half end needing ventilators go recover. remainder need ventilators 50/50 chance survival.

So, start see hospitalization spikes 11 days case detection spikes regardless. Whether death spikes bad, depends availability adequate care severely ill.

But case incidences actually hideously underreported, hospitalisations reality likely blow predictions based present known cases.

It's three months since last spike, hope treatment options better, less invasive mobile before, take burden resources. Otherwise things going get real interesting June 9. Next.. Yeah man, put helmet springy shoes angel wings party city jump five story building , chances dying ""very low"". actually google fangfang was, thought might talking falun gung second. idea fangfang nobody talked her. can't read chinese, communicate verbally. may posts extended family group chat notifications cannot read anything anyway. 

anti fangfang sentiment seems ""logical,"" going making money, American money. could huge plethora reasons, real fabricated, people internet like that. But, yes, support her, even though read works. see general masses might like it. 

You're right. maternal side definitely supportive CPC, part ones land seized civil war. paternal side indifferent. got hong kong passports kids upper middle class. rich means actually kind rich objectively. reading articles fangfang wrote, say, words echoed hearing family well friends teaching english china. scared virus government. annoying locked also genuine fear punishment obeying.

anyway, said, course, majority Chinese people significantly trusting like CPC course, people would know.

The situation US terms varied opinions absolutely different China's. never meant imply situations same. 

But definitely initial strong objections government safety restrictions, like think people would react modern ""democratic"" country. 

I think rallying anti-mask especially anti vaxxing would ever thing. science pretty convincing. people made facebook group saying otherwise, would hit crimes disinformation.

Like also one big questions ""faked"" moon landing documentary shown fox back 90's. US government really faked moon landing, letting fox air documentary. kind thing would seized chinese government producers jailed lol.

&amp;#x200B;

ANYWAY, 

All trying say original post whole culture wearing masks prevalent article trying make be. also factor fact definitely people willing listening higher ups saying eventually following whatever policies set place. 

I think essentially point well, it? 

People definitely inconvenienced laws Chinese people definitely selfish would want protect best interests. Nobody wants go lockdown. factors INCLUDING used wear face masks, listening authorities, clear consistent voice authorities, strong government enforcement policies contributed current health policies country. Yeah...but got phd Exactly, Trump lite. He's evil, fucking idiot. (I apologise idiots everywhere comparison)  least NHL highly considering season Canada. say good, clear deserve host it. Good thing love Jesus much bunch go meet soon. generation sucks Imagine signing lmao state benefit 275 week max - live major metro area major state. get slightly less half - standard rate EVERYONE PUA (gig workers etc) regardless income (some may get full exact half amount seen ) + 600. 

Like said PUA calculation half state benefit + 600 regardless actual income - PUA fed program self-employed. People wear mask... wear mask? Thick skull means stubborn thou. called gent strawmanned 3 times without putting single argument, even attacking strawman. Rude, perhaps, fairly mild imo. conversation going anywhere anyways. 

I want mention ""you rude therefore wrong"" rather ad honimem-ish, though get point keep mind guess.

.

I trust doctor more, heuristic. lying bed somewhere wuhan febuary, somehow conscious dying, i'd probably trust experimental drug doctor anybody else. think talking whether experimental drug actually works, doctor thought might worth bringing up. Unless doctor good reason think so, case said reason, fact doctor thought so, noteworthy.

I think there's much disagreement regarding trusting doctors politicians random joes. slight disagreement seems why. believe doctors, actually trustworthy (as opposed best bad options), always secondary sources (as in, referencing study, etc). Ideally referencing primary sources, doctors focus.

In words, comment replied read ""Seriously. understand FEELINGS important 'statistics cases actually rising'"" rather 'what virologist thinks'. always case NY fuck!? branch in? worst thing get blood drawn coworkers. 🏅 Great reply, thanks. Hang there, US head straight. There's large complete moron contingent causing trouble.

Has AMLO really useless whole time? following much. Michigan checking Vernors pot! Somebody going explain math Massachusetts. 8,000 dead, 6,900,000 population. much respect Fauci he's he's partly responsible this. lied. Yes, North Dakota try contract tracing, many residents shot shit real quick. That's live currently. state continues large numbers primarily eastern side state. But, ND immune shit like many people think. got 80th death today. Take advice Florida man..... WNYer too. I'm afraid say though people starting either get sick care. Guy work yesterday saw mask on, wearing his, goes ""why still wearing that!?""  hot enough Texas Hope stay safe Texas - least we're already halfway 2020.  Appropriate response. Trump def would guessed Brazil would higher age death Mexico... damn probably count excess mortality numbers US accurate year two now.

Yep. longest time Hurricane Maria official death toll 64. number Trump kept repeating offer ""great job"" doing. George Washington University presented study official death revised upwards 2975. in-line many ground medical professionals believed be. Awesome. really hope realities enter public discourse more, soon. Florida comment may made explicit, idea would 'return work bonus' paid whatever maximum time period person could received unemployment insurance. state pays unemployment benefit six months went back work month two, would receive four months enhanced payment. 

I ardent supporter universal basic income, 1) that's addressing 2) politics art possible; and, least now, finding way get around GOP resistance continuing enhanced unemployment insurance 'return work' payment may achievable.  Universal Basic Income currently realistic short term goal U.S. I’m currently rural PA. Besides grocery stores, walk shop mask on, people look like you’re alien. People Pennsyltucky pretending virus never existed.  Bro survived less 12k year 20s. I'm boomer either. 

It's hard program equation take figures website spit exactly receive normalize unemployment regular wages. super basic math calculus trig. thing Texas done close bars?

I'm Collin County people wear mask public.

Sorry get chest. 50 higher risk category several reasons, despise people would attempt bully trying protect myself.  Unless information we've learned treatment increased survival rate, variable missed. 

I think IFR lower anticipated also highly skeptical low. Yeah that's gonna change soon unfortunately. Hospitalizations almost 60% last week Thank you, Pennsylvania. Protect us.


- love, New England. inject lead antivirals then. Trump said sun would kill virus! happening? Apple taking seriously, gotta give ‘em that. security guards well employees managing entrance stores. NY, masks already mandatory. Apple also taking temperatures, offering hand sanitizer gloves querying customers “Why today?” Guess trying screen windows shoppers. That’s many saying past several weeks. one listening. Heck, one found. everyone go?

Hey, would interested Governor chance? Itxs true U.S. also. Oh worry I've felt way time lol... still staying home besides working twice week. benefit living America, I'm wishing best folks Australia! wish well friend, stay safe hope everything turns best possible.  tiny church 200 miles away infected 200 directly hundreds spread community La Grande, population 13,000. Article Hopkins showing 1237 cases per 100k, works 337 cases half single church. 

This church Idaho going kill people. okay, man? problem tested one day negative next day catch positive. That’s makes hard control especially people following recommendations. comment sections made lose even hope humanity. Let's math show why!


NYC population = 8,400,000 roughly 

NYC covid deaths far = 17,757

If made crazy assumption everybody NYC covid, would IFR be? 

17,757 / 8,400,000 = .0021 = IFR .2%


Now, essentially guaranteed people NYC die covid (sadly), meaning IFR go .02% baseline.

Edit: fixed typo pointed below. think lupus actually multiple diseases personally, especially since hard diagnose almost always diseases (I another nerve issue another autoimmune). problem fatigue tend treat much besides lifestyle changes. quinacrine life changer stopped producing it... That's kind messed use disinfectant meant carts. give hand sanitizer? good habit sanitize removing gloves, even they're impermeable unintentionally contaminate skin process removing them. They've reducing testing places like Florida remember We’ve got guidelines, consequences don’t follow them. Hearing lots sides, places report others don’t.

Edit:definitely give props right thing reporting closing it. mostly feel really sorry small business owners. close, lose livelihood, stay open, put people danger. fun decisions making. I’m sure Jesus would preach sermon mount online times like these. Grew Altoona, parents still there. regularly tell they'll ones wearing masks get dirty looks stores. Following along old high school circles Facebook depressing. groups shitposting proud wearing masks pictures Trump congratulating comments. spending time outside social distancing wearing mask somehow going protect everyone? Healthcare workers die lack concern. They're stuck middle need voice opinion implement policy sake. Many idiots see Trump wearing mask say, ""look wearing one. fearless leader."" truth is, Trump scared shitless catching covid makes everyone around wear mask also get regular covid test every day. Trump knows followers ignorant foolish. also care get sick die. Reddit phds agree guy. fact, we’ve preaching since January. He’s newbie compared us. :) RIP It’s basically feeling hit snooze phone one morning... (well, thought - oops!) wake up, look phone, see work hour ago. Damn! Turned alarm instead snooze!

That brief moment you’re jumping bed... that’s feeling right there. It’s beyond alarmed. planted veggie garden February chickens literally left home except since march 13th today job decided safe come back. I'm AZ. Wtf job? people Canada too. simply ignore whenever say fearmongering. obviously cannot wrap head around science. know things get worse get better. new normal must work together get it. No! Stay home!! encouraging people congurgate. Create restaurant chain requires customers word orders math problems. math bad accidentally order 1500 tacos, they're legally obligated pay all. 'Murica stupid, make bank. acts like isnt getting worse people act like causing outbreaks... idk point.

oh trust... droves time! hooker thing condom protecting you, wear masks protect others. I’ve one bar since March. wife anniversary. went wanted fish chips pub reminisce honeymoon. Monday. opened 3 PM, got 3:10 ones entire time. still felt edge. can’t imagine going Friday Saturday night right now. would full panic attack. Melbourne went back lockdown double digit cases. Texas, it’s still fire there. Indian here. cities affected well. least people following mask wearing there's hefty fine wearing masks affected cities( including mine). 

Also hospitals populated cuties getting overwhelmed there's :( get one that’s 1% effective get 100 times Stock market 🚀🚀 Yeah months ago got comment banned “fear monger” said “just wait surpass 25k deaths, really going start going downhill.” It’s valid. point. I’m merely talking guy died didn’t homework. talking gross missteps illustrious administration. 1000 data points. 

His inability (and friends) take serious, killed him. Him. don’t even wanna go attribute conflicting messages politics. chose lead ignorant life choices informed killed him. Fucking seriously? good lawyers  Probably water/apple juice/apple juice water. buy syringes. buy bottles certainly print small labels covid vaccine Thank you. can’t get past paywall. #Translation:

The waiting time planned operation increased significantly since care forced re-prioritize due covid-19, reports Ekot. long queues expected continue autumn.

In mid-March, 113,000 people waiting surgery. Three months later, week midsummer, queue grown almost 60 percent 180,000 people.
Above all, orthopedic operations, knee, foot hip joints, postponed. barbecue, ie entirely outdoor party? either caught outside using bathroom...? didn’t say good thing. sister getting married 3 weeks. one groomsmen. tell think wedding? Don’t think it’s enforced though, people go around Florida problem. sure out/in Florida really must’ve something.

Fixed. I'm well aware. knowns unknowns real players. We'll see. Coupled racial issues country has, could nightmare too. ton evidence African American people treated worse doctors prioritized less. Studies shown doctors take black pain less seriously. One wonder white person position guy still alive executed state. Man fucking cousins really number intelligence live go hospital annual check-up? states really well. 
Like first state case spotted Kerala initially Kerala highest numbers lockdown strict managed control it. state populated ( i.e 40 million people) really good. smaller less densely populated States impacted. main epicentre Mumbai city 20 million population extremely densely populated half city slums. also biggest city India. lot internation travel initially brought lockdown implemented cases less 1000 spread slums that's that.. lockdown happened lot workers mumbai states, even though transportation available people without money survive..around 200,000 workers went back States intially walking 1000s kilometres. 

So situation India short tough compare places . density population, overall population, size country.. 600,000 cases curently 500,000 4 big states ..so controlled else long jobs big states people need travel die hunger. 
The businesses big states need people business also..so controlled unlock going state state.

I fan current PM amazing reach respect among majority people people listen blindly therefore wearing masks, staying put long really depend whether survive. cases spike northeast, that’s true start second wave. Amazing happens testing fully available people actually go get tested. “I need eat”. Grocery stores open upon last check. 

Agree people avoiding travel much possible. 

People also need options things outside virus proven less spread. Bars restaurants? socializing talking loudly. No. Keep closed. Pack picnic. Wow, insane. usually seem get every couple years spend 1.5 days asking god take me. comes like brick quickly hard comes seems go away.

Glad hear recovered! “One good friend” lmao wtf shit. 
Now expert bc one dumb friend can’t think herself?

Stfu. Cases fairly pointless.

What hospitalization death numbers? anything relevant. Agree. people like everywhere. Trump either. Try bringing Obama's record liberals.

We teach history kids. teach American propaganda. news constant propaganda America force good world.

And people believe go online make fun Chinese banning Pooh. Fauci said 100,000 day probably cards Kick office. Expect politician? Lol, that's good one. reopened early required people wear masks near beginning pandemic, we'd much better off.

I many plans summer longer go many people think wearing mask violates rights. mean, ""normal"" pneumonia seriously fuck lungs over. ""I'm surrounded assholes!"" Thought first surpassed number US deaths Vietnam war people would take seriously. obviously naive me. amazing people fighting open hair salons, bars, restaurants. Yet, open schools. 

Every time American shouts ""freedom"" ""constitutional rights"", hear ""money"". Ah yes, lack transparnecy. Always good sign. Also probably [bulk Sweden's excess death toll included official COVID figures probably comes from. That’s county near called Plano did. literally thought, “suggestion? What’s fucking point then?”. much seems politically motivated move short list, fellow Michigander - less traffic coming right better. Backed real things? fed's money printer begs differ. Money massively diluted. pumped corporate markets. protects wealth richest diluting small savings average person. 

The wealthy keep wealth USD savings accounts. Everything hedged high yield investments, collateralized loans, corporate ownership, precious medals even Bit'coin. Money printing harm wealthy. least stages. literally transfers value them.

If think existing monetary systems need backed anything public trust/use, need spend time learning monetary policy blockchain. exactly build blockchain that's backed pegged value yet every unit asset retain usable transferable value. See Bit'coin/Ethereum thousands others.

Some blockchains use shit monetary policies greedy central banks steal money/value holders related asset printing units (Same printing dollars). Though, digital systems money easily designed forcefully give authority monetary decision back public. Running monetary system puts public first really foundation good system. That's good monetary system needs backed by. blockchain networks money dying entire banking financial systems built them.

Once public loses control monetary policies everything always comes down. matter when. tempting turn printers average fiat currency dies 27 years. problem either nothing. US trying cake eat too. need another full lockdown. Im Michigan 20 something crowd seemingly purposely social distancing. Big boat raft parties day, basement keggers night. Oh live summer homes parents. beginning. Remind July 27th hit 150K cases day.  keep hearing shit load people either mild symptoms none all. already working likely. I'm sure theres enough people continue. understand saying though. Also made doesnt even matter lol. one die fake virus?  Man, it’s almost like Covid mimic whole bunch mild reactions—like allergies, case effects chemo—and it’s better err side caution limit social interactions! area we’re talking affluent suburb. doesn’t really fit. good, stay course, haters gonna hate know. Trump want extinction US citizens? People dont seem understand wave is. simple concept. one peak that's continually moving medium. COVID infections US perfect example single wave, working way population. clear, widespread agreement among Americans parts country


The opinion people things bad, what's good that's finally falling line medical community saying charged criminal negligence. I'm working home two 3 year olds. live AZ starting come around idea sending back school numbers started getting crazy. know long without work starting suffer. basically working two jobs. media Sweden mostly reporting Trump Covid19 situation US.
Almost nothing fact Sweden high death numbers. Bet people insist wear pants tho someone confirm numbers come increased testing actually many people getting sick? I'm asking I've seen serious push scientific subreddits due increased testing, number deaths decreasing. social responsibility. 

We seem big here. God’s help, I’ll able survive this.

Guess God said 'no.' one claimed useless, proper social distancing could detrimental maintain distance keep touching face adjust mask thought worse keeping distance (at time touch proven thought vector). addition day people shown masks detrimental deployment number people wearing wrong breaking social distance ""wearing mask"" way worse mask distance thus ""masks useless"" harmful used incorrectly. argument Fauci along strong evidence masks better distance populations learn one thing time. 

The issue became Americans really bad maintaining distance continuously want reopen mask wearing required masks help close contact hence medical professionals need common people don't. Medical professionals can't work 6ft away everyone hospital (including patients) guaranteed contact covid positive individuals majority country (I'm talking country wide hot spots). 

On top medical professionals wearing different masks common people cloth face coverings surgical masks. N95 medical professionals use protect inbound outbound enough prevent spread mask types reduce eliminate virtual load transfer drastically reduce distance spread. Also anyone mask check valve selfish prick unless act like mask N95 protecting essentially wearing mask. mask filter outbound air spreading have. 

In summary one gets confuse words: masks good, wear mask, make sure wear correctly, social distancing better mask, Americans understand social distancing thus masks required, people stupid, cloth mask medical grade, keep social distancing addition wearing mask, try wear masks valves attribute super spread events (did word exist COVID?) droplets? Church choirs, places circulating air like meat plants etc. attributed whole lot people v dropletting other? IFR statistical analysis based widespread testing population acknowledges accounts asymptomatic untested cases

CFR considers confirmed, positive-tested cases. economy fucked neighbours..they didnt win anything think friends can't afford work 14 days self isolating. lot complicated simply open change. switching career work home job pandemic possible/viable people. Fucking norovirus. got petrol station pump. 4 days degradation cunt can't stay indoors 24 hours stops shitting. erasure virus would make grin malevolently...

Arboga Municipality publishes requested figures, want Aftonbladet publish information homes affected. Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! Number one! fear bat already eaten. need identify central hub this!! one said going well. actually read comment? I'm saying masks bad idea all. blaming mask policies explosion Covid cases US dishonest.  Anyone serious dental work past month like cavities, root canals, extractions? State law Texas requires believe higher power hold office. get. ""a rando plot"", would say ""second wave"" Michigan might real. number new corona virus cases doubled mid June now.

See 7 day averages June 16 today.

Of course, also people ""randos plot"" noticed:

""Gov. Gretchen Whitmer closes Michigan indoor bar service, except know he's wrong. try let us know. opinion? two bits thoughtcrime: 

1. virus *not* existential threat healthy people age 60. matter desperately New York Times wants convey otherwise. people represent bulk recent infections, we’re watching deaths fall alongside new case growth (even accounting lag)

2. I’m familiar Italy, New York’s initial experience terrified country. enormous number avoidable deaths catastrophic mistakes states learned avoid

Both 1 2 seem far plausible favorable mutation virus scientists flagged knowledge. got one! fortunate heard anomalies knowing lots sick. know personally two people it. One non symptomatic, one dead. I’m pretty freaked randomness. 
I know lot people aren’t afraid virus. I’m bit envious, TBH. would love live fear.  One moms favorite sayings “ignorance bliss”
It’s sad guess many worlds interpretation accurate, one worse ones.  true it’s small percent small percent population it’s even worth oxygen sharing Shhh... want death cult. facts science. don’t care true is, long gets selfish fools wear one. Lmao mf still trying ways China! lol ""with due respect"" probably spend time working reading. Exactly. That's think masks mandatory everywhere people getting fined following order. Nope. Az doesnt responsible government korea actually does, compare death rates per capita. Chilling foreshadowing state run healthcare system all, decision based substantially what's best state:

&amp;#x200B;

"" doctor informed Melissa decision withhold care “what feel best along state, decided,” “this decision medical community state.”   "" Though young children still represent smallest patient group state, fears infected children unknowingly spreading virus led many Oregon states across nation question whether safe allow children return school fall.

Just guess, think going back school person good idea. reliable vaccine. stop them? choice. Barry Zuckercorn levels terrible legal advice right here. might actually issue this. see reasonable person, knowledgeable, working right. resigned turned sometime necessarily running mental marathons.



I'd rather person charge stay charge advice stronger precautions problems take care cost? many deaths acceptable? America take seriously? study arguing with. whataboutism comment serves purpose. want point people yelled defunding guilty far worse inaction within country. everybody still lot them. shows one part entity work hard another shit bed. hopefully provides context defunding organization middle pandemic foolish also getting someone look perception ignorance Vietnam poor, populous country managed contact tracing. obviously doable. unfortunate is, it’s really hard feel sorry people. staying 3 Disney hotels. Grand Floridian, Yacht Club Grand Destino tower Coronado Springs hotel. live Chicago state you. people city wear masks. Much lower frequency suburbs still majority people AFAIK. hard pick winner dumbest GOP member, holy crap. entire population us gets that's ~16.4 million people dead entire pandemic taught never able count fellow countrymen whole *anything*. (Spain) got locked 75 brutal days beat virus. One month even close long enough.

The difference nationwide. One done.  metric Belgians must crowding arenas, undressing slobbering one another's mouths. suppose pot always go towards open casket funeral. Fuck thursdays! wish hospitals would announce it.

We divert week two ago. weeks blending together, I'm sorry I'm specific.

Basically, dispatch knew would tell inbound ambulances divert.

But means hospitals would backtrack coordinate new hospital.  Wouldn’t gone states, going back school fall that’s good. Stay safe. great storm stupidity corruption building. (Canada) teachers public system hit $100k/yr years without even breaking sweat. live nice neighbourhoods doctors, lawyers, engineers, etc. lot fancier cars like Audi, acura, lexus...

Defined benefit pension too. Unionized. remember back March whole thing ramping big nightmare ""depopulation scheme"".

I dreamt actually going use lockdowns excuse kill elderly poor. actually dreamt would pump Covid vents seniors homes infect everybody.

I dreamt would say ""city living"" infectious. dreamt would say materials built things infectious would abandon city life entirely. dreamt ordered move city areas new housing constructed outside towns.

All small stores would close dozen ""super-businesses"" bought everything need from.

I also remember dreaming would get facial recognition, drones, cellphone tracking way deal Covid. point heard Russia ""extreme"" measures taking. like ""That us, too!""

And would say tons Covid cases thought use excuse bring martial law would armed clashes streets.

And dreamt national governments would collapse, everyone would blame happened, NATO something would step take control would ""One-World Government"".

In dream, ""new normal"" life kind like ""The Sims"". Everything planned organized. Everyone moved small ""living units"" lived solitary lives, pretty much engaging world via internet screens. Human contact reduced minimum, even babies taken mothers raised different parents try break close ties. end, everyone would either ""essential worker"" streets, ""knowledge worker"" computer, rest would agricultural workers nearby fields, supplying food.

It crazy dream dystopia! Remember asshat?   vector ""was aware diagnosis attended gathering didn’t think could infect anyone symptoms""

Just like neighbor refuses wear mask distance ""doesn't feel sick"" argues contagious feel sick.

What fuck wrong people? chose least precautionary selfish position every issue fight tooth nail right assholes. get it. Oh yeah, no, didn’t come across blaming. pretty specific data could answer question! 

From personally saw, basically everyone protests wearing masks properly. got messy night SPD went psycho CS gas, people generally cautious could possibly be. also free testing available anyone feared exposure. know quite protesters went “feared exposed someone grocery store coughing” excuses like that. widespread free testing available utilized. 

I looked Minnesota’s numbers, don’t appear spiking significantly either, don’t know much testing availability I’m hesitant speculate quite firmly means there. people feel sick, people get tested. cap testing, e.g. giving 10,000 tests day, keep positive tests lower-you never 10,000 positive tests give 10,000 tests.

Unless additional testing somehow ""forced,"" going get positive tests tests available-getting tested pleasant experience. 

So unless saying 2 weeks ago enough tests, right police officers going people's homes dragging clinics tests, positive test rate going roughly percentage actual infected rate population. 

People going get test think need one, test availability thing could cause problems. don’t know man, he’s pretty clear we’re supposed treat neighbors. opinion, anyone going party pandemic doesn’t get beg mercy get infected. prioritize entertainment people’s lives, you’ve made bed. (☞ﾟヮﾟ)☞ Thank god someone knows means. Fortnite needs make Florida map.

Thinking happen citizens whatever reason. think lot people beginning thought, oh virus Asia, it'll stay there, whatever...not really caring Chinese people dying huge numbers. probably does, everyone stays inside AC recirculated air it’s 110 outside. You’re hedging yourself. discuss whether person dies preexisting conditions body still warm gross tremendously insensitive. thing adds discourse making person said feel better situation. It’s absolutely horrid. NY already mass cases early places like California didn’t due early shut downs. fewer people infect end May states hadn’t level cases. You'e welcome! Haha thanks this. thinking lazy. can’t much requires focus kids awake. modern day purge. people dying somewhat quicker Covid-19 climate change. Florida seems bit flat place accept that. would starved three weeks. time would done that, shelves already empty. make enough money buy everything I'd need month anyway, even did, would late.

Imagine pregnant delivering. daughter 6 weeks old got laid March. go back work cant get daycare anyone. also cant afford work. Yeah, I'll curios see popularity going next take poll.

I know Whitmer's getting slammed since original stay home order, like 60% approval days. 

I think part people getting fed all. Businesses going under, unemployment (and government helping enough that), isolation &amp; boredom. 

Those vaccines can't come fast enough certainly true. always put money t-bills want stock market risks. Duh reality is, paying $5 hour watch child paying service.

Im going continue this. Good bye. wish could dig another example years ago. cruise liner sank Mediterranean huge deal made around fact captain bailed went down. Many experts across globe around world consulted went wrong, could better, etc.

There interview British Naval Commander sort CBC Radio One Canada blunt saying happened completely consistent culture. stated British captain would accept duties stay bitter end going ship. Anecdotally captain Southern Europe apparently well known behaviour fit tragic series actions took place.

To point, sweeping generalizations yes, correct areas different mentalities.

As example, Canadians average far frugal southern counterparts. made for, example, banking system far risk adverse better weather recessions.

edit - Costa Concordia. Looks like captain bailed. ""fell"" lifeboat. Further, Ontario lots us completely losing reducing cases fast enough. Since 65+ population likely hospitalized die this, stay home order people? 
That way kill economy, rest people go back work hospitals get overwhelmed. Cal guess plus side, we'll figure threshold herd immunity really is.  decision made masks insufficient supply healthcare workers. power invoke DPA step mask production, know somebody power ... continued denying virus serious threat. 'Twas merely substandard jest. Even Covid wife can’t afford child. full time jobs, child care would almost much wife makes per month couldn’t afford family three one incomes. hope later life financially stable enough support another human adopt. cat gets live like King. Lol Haha comment expected see. wrestlers usually wear masks? CHOA profit. don’t owners. 24395/115000 = 16%. US math. Yay go adopted state /s hey kept freedom though.. something lose narrative. seeing many fewer deaths due less traveling, less people working dangerous stressful situations, etc.

How many? what's swing? That’s administrative reason confusing. social reason stayed confusing doctors trained give answers 100% verified whereas scientists saying “let’s use little inductive reasoning here”. That’s gap doctors scientists saying. 

In general it’s good thing MDs say anything scientists tested idea, case common sense got lost. sad part might even make top 5 shady things Vince McMahon done Well that's little different first claim. first 300million quite 300million first billion produced. people getting Disney parks already tickets 2020.

No new tickets sold 2020. ""it jokingly fear mongering"" Well logic since also tested negative able hang opinion? (Given masks social distancing course) Keep mind HA!

Underrated comment. Okay? answer pay doctors nurses would otherwise laid limitation elective surgeries... correct, social construct, perfectly consistent people understand virus contagious. going spread point flatten curve, eliminate it. eliminate contagious virus.

Not health experts freaking out, neither hospital employees. Like comment said, despite reading reddit, sky isnt falling. never said countries make US feel better, media reddit isnt pointing failures.

Go spill doom gloom somewhere else. Cali got though Yeah people need give stylists break. nasal congestion every single day. gives scratchy throat like 30% days half year. lot people mild symptoms. Many paycheck months, understand hoping allergies something. Hey know video games played kid (super Nintendo n64) filled reading way. Cant get something, go read it.  

There problem solving skills video games teach well yeah understand say ideal effective folks give credit for.

A great way move towards ideal may find game yall could play together little bit still focuses reading. 

Nintendo oldschool games included online service. way could see working airlines enforce preventing tickets issued without least 14-days arriving return flights Seriously, anyone Florida? guys masking staying home everyone going bar/beach? mandatory everyone USA needs carry around picture Dr. Fauci times. He’s sexy man. USC announced well, dominoes may fall (which think good)! except illness death.....yes. sad times live in. Evidently not. M-O-O-N spells coverup testing more. Stop testing people get sick die. still going disappear. I'm open wearing mask.  Lol “safest place America”, unless EVERY SINGLE STAFF MEMBER stays campus doesn’t leave someone bringing Covid bubble consider right center think that’s fair characterization “those people”.

Edit: guys &amp; gals, get it’s easy downvote someone disagree button I’m chat. I’m open person willing downvoted, let’s talk. You’ll get auto upvotes, even - matter quality comment. 

Where going wrong conversation? 1k month split 3 ways. Roommates man. 

These issues strawmen. 

I support single payer healthcare, better childcare support systems, social programs also calling absurdity paying people work, work. need judge agree get enforcement make slow tedious. laws aren’t really set handling stuff like pandemic. What's crazy way win election save economy *is also fucking deal virus*. He's fucking along everyone else. rate infection deaths, hands ignorant incompetent leadership, concur statement. Gonna plenty inventory. mah freedom better PRI PAN pieces shit destroyed country Yeah, June 30th numbers revealed day after. exactly. plus south isn’t monolith ignorance. it’s extremely diverse, including highest concentration african-americans, targeted disenfranchisement creates myth southerners vote red (see: georgia’s governor’s election fraud). notion extremely dangerous acting though entire south lost cause 1) ignoring lot good 2) everything appledocious said 3) easy cop-out avoids solve host issues end leaving lot vulnerable people suffer. Okay wife coworker daughter boyfriend tested positive covid. would think coworker would get tested quarantine 14 days. instead came work waits test results... actually saw feel good news piece nursing home staff moved like 2 months. believe Washington nursing home outbreaks really bad. infections. Especially north people head indoors again. summer Houston hot hell - oppressively hot humid. People stay indoors, air conditioned spaces. It’s comfortable outside Houston winter, actually. doofus need go simpsons movie encase people glass dome let stupid hearts content, release coronavirus Agreed, seemed want walk fine line what's right expected.  Yeah, sorry, NY already proven false. IFR .01 % range. Let’s get real folks. let’s forget death one way virus fuck you. Impressive credentials amigo. Never seen someone quite well edumuhcated daddy!!!!! want foozball. 

As side note watching rerun baseball seeing stadium crowd fuckin surreal can't believe quickly world changed. Absolutely!!!! America lost way, ever knew it. freedom comes responsibility.  That's shtick bro

Edit: getting tired foreign entertainment news outlets' commentary directed toward Americans. Speak expats, people subject country. - middle pandemic spend - pandemic regin things - know - give massive tax cuts already wealthy people expense rest populace try holler ""poor mouth"" time comes actually NEED spend money short tax revenues. 

I'm naive one here. fair people want protest. I'm saying go white house drag every corrupt politician show leveling off, others show increase. christian either. yes say that. also said aware false teachings/teachers... pastors teach untruth lies... hhhhhmmmm. .. seems like lot cropping up. imagine risking see Vanilla Ice Fourth July viral pandemic. That’s gotta whitest possible way die. There's reason test early, barely matters it. 

How say covid scar lungs life among terrible things?

[What know (so far) long-term health effects governor California stated saw uptick deaths today.  Live NH. Prisoners make license plates motto them. Ironic. remember case passenger intoxicated pulled knife, driver got car took axe trunk! Cops called etc basically blamed other. 

I think ride share platforms there’s general understanding safety teams drivers may weapons protection them, it’s informed issue warning. remember female driver bunch drunk assholes car pepper sprayed temporarily remove platform (were going permanently, went media).

After things I’ve seen dealt safety team member, think whole ride share thing little scary. “you people”? left tiny flat Atlanta five times since March 12, aside grocery store trips daily walks low-traffic park. nearest dearest except add work whose employers required return. 

A crappy governor malicious minority ruining everyone. 

Almost four months seeing mom terminally ill none mattered flipping are. say concerned complicit criminal conspiracy attendees don’t want give evidence helps build case. done 4 months ago across US, would beaten virus now. yet can't raise kids. can't expected work full time job, normal parenting tasks, also provide education good trained teacher. 

How got here? guess would erosion unions general stagnation middle class incomes parents required work full-time job raise family? wha

yeah get uhhh.. source that?  Numbers country inaccurate.
But hiding Even nurses girlfriend works playing fast loose getting infected. 

My girlfriend nurse major Chicago hospital coworkers bars every time work. 

No mask. care. hitting bars Wrigley opened. bars aren’t enforcing shit. 

These fucking NURSES. fucked. agree. fucked up, indictment every level government, heartwarming. like gofundme cancer patient works Keiser Permanente. necessary, good see regular people, anywhere, giving shit people. case, record setting way. Kudos Mongolia. What’s survival rate diabetics surviving COVID...? Thanks! make good point. believe IFR decreased somewhat, especially knowing ventilator use implications well steroidal intervention. I'm sure factors away 100-fold decrease. Officials plan disclose day cares least five infections enrollment least 30 kids. aren’t planning differentiate infections children workers.

Man, kid daycare disclose even 1 infection I'd fucking livid. [i'm glad Lmao think AMLO corrupt PRI PAN (not mention sheer incompetence), really know say  Finishing last year hospital Mexico becoming licensed doctor (MPSS).

In area can't get tested unless doctor already examined ordered it. symptoms bad enough hospitalized.

If fever, cough, covid-19 symptoms respiratory difficulty basically sent home (or called hospital, told stay home come trouble breathing). tests done.

So essentially patients sick enough hospitalized tested.

There dramatic rise neumonía atípicas (atypical pneumonias), counted Covid-19 since test result. majority probably won't.

Cause death atypical pneumonia viral pneumonia respiratory failure secondary blah blah blah rise everywhere, again, test administered = positive Covid-19.

Covid-19 statistics Mexico worthless. government AMLO failed people. disaster avoidable measures taken immediately (Mexico really start getting hit Covid-19 late March). Texas trying hard impress teacher. question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies. Now, properly respond entire comment move on. I'm surprised restaurant owners clamoring fans saying give option I'll make work. Shutting dinning rooms super devastating seem way around moment. take 50,000 contact traced asked quarantine? 20 probably false negatives tests infamous for. :( live never advised wear masks except displaying symptoms caring someone sick. people wore masks supermarkets lockdown personal space always respected others knew wearing masks fashion statement. covid19 two months still see odd person chemist shop wearing mask. mandated state would problem complying rules, easy-going lot Tasmania. Nice DD. We’ve come along ways since first post haven’t 🙄 driver I’d want sheet plexiglass totally isolating back seat  Florida August 10th. vague promises classes eating separately. migrant camp...why think Trump care Uighur camps? would love implement something like here. may come contrarian it’s honest question: problem case? Assuming isolate couple weeks course. Jared got folks. Middle East peace thing hold Oh well he’s nearly corrupt orange room mate: ""Hey know got back camping trip I'm going river birthday weekend we're gonna friends family dinner tonight""

Me: ""uhhhhhh......."" got Corona

Yo, I'll solve it

Check 90's - corona involvement

ICU ICU BABY Amen that!!!! don’t wear mask, PROBLEM. don’t care old (unless child) take responsibility. seeing older adults don’t wear masks especially burns up, lived long enough know better! I’m 60 BTW. ""Man hurts foot releasing cinder block it"" anyone else listen interview? believe herd immunity works happened Sweden? fed much misinformation (or lack information) baffles me. $$$$
All aboard recession train!!!

Next stop Depression! 

Seriously look state economy. saw many places closing lease signs everywhere LA. Restaurant bars included. Fun fact: already planned avoiding glass issue: department defense put $132 million order guys: lessons learned? 

1. Wear mask 

2. Stay away bars

Both applicable vaccine exists herd immunity achieved. Ah, yes. knew username familiar. looked post history recall post work r/guatemala.

Man, thought things going better Honduras. sucks hear that. question though. were/are curfew allows go based ID number yeah? know called Honduras like DPI I'm Guatemala. work well? Friends Bolivia said worked really well guess every place different. I've wondering would here.

I'm sure following news changes past couple days. Considering coming way. tonight Asturias, guy charge coronavirus response, made case going bad. I've concerned Giammattei's constant talk reopening underestimating this. Asturias pulled IHME model press conference straight said going bad. enough beds. I'm sure seen per capita city far worst.

Also, moving ""alert system"". Basically, Giammattei wants able associate control measures colors assign colors departments. long term thing too. vaccine.

Anyway, point is, think things going different 2 weeks now. Asturias taking IHME gospel assumes six week shutdown beginning Aug 5th. Guatemala absolutely can't handle peak. couple weeks think possible Guatemala department shutdown lot. Maybe Quetzaltenango Sacatepéquez well. Maybe even full curfew. Idk. might suck arrive right lockdown. opinion. Lol. much denial. won’t games. Puerta virusarta think article gives reporting current crisis summary Native people/tribes struggling general. sure underreported cases deaths. Whoops! right. Clumsy phone typing! Thanks. I'd agree. knew lying since even started r/Masks4All I'm guy. remember went 60 Minutes said ""we need see people masks place"". course, later admitted lied prevent PPE shortages, damn damaging that. Lmao go. 

If think won’t pay cash we’re printing you’re naive best, willfully ignorant worst. 

My kids gonna paying bill long I’m dead ground. ‘Money printer go brrrr’ precipitated collapse many world powers. 

We don’t live post scarcity society yet. isn’t Star Trek, monetary fiscal policy real life consequences. wasn’t absurd amount deflationary pressure due demand shock would already seeing double digit yearly inflation.

Edit: over, demand returns, people holding record levels cash.... expect whip back deflationary pressure inflationary less one fiscal quarter. Mexico, close US far God. 
I know God part, I'm US. believe miracles here.  Xi nowhere near bad President recent memory, Trump included. read article, saw downvoted made joke based unfounded assumption. kind dumbass answer that? must look within....I'll look rearview still waiting precious Government come help you. Idiot. I’m going let little secret. ready? Lean close take listen:

They aren’t season year shit.  Mongolians Native Americans Fed ever will. Diehard bears fan season ticket holder. going signing this. go dad he's risk - would never go without Defensive much? everything dumbass. Sure. see math below. go current rosy guess 20% NYC covid, IFR 1% .01%. 

There breakthroughs treatment reduce mortality 100-fold. been, would know it. drugstore chain ""Bipa"" offers sale corona test weeks. Michael Putz, managing director company ""Lead Horizon"", provides PCR test home use, confirmed corresponding report APA Monday afternoon  company, co-founded Viennese virologist Christoph Steininger, provides test kits ""Bipa"". sample taken home evaluated certified laboratory. test kit contains liquid gargled spit enclosed tube. whole thing sent laboratory mail.  result within one working day  sample arrived, test result available within one working day, sent customer SMS. According three four weeks tests available 500 ""Bipa"" stores online shop. clear much test cost. drugstore chain available statement. probably made up. previous ""corona parties"" turned myth. Ahhh, may be. really watch Florida numbers closely. We're still ok Tejas seeing NYC-level problems that's different situation. Yup. guy runs it, Doug Wilson, piece shit. lies relentlessly city order buy properties names elders church. Sorry... Board members... bad. thinks Slavery mutually beneficial written books saying so. believes sodomy (being gay) worse slavery. newest brochure, published New Saint Andrew's College (which helped create) photo standing prude flag.

I hate man much....

He also advises flock wear masks go gov orders.

He piece shit. don’t understand didn’t instead making mask wearing political. stupid. Thanks great reply know ibme hasn’t shown downward trend past week, sure else monitoring almost never heard nasal cannula referred “breathing tube” 10+ years medicine. headline simply deliberately misleading. “Breathing tube” almost always semantically used refer vent. Sounds like made bullshit. Pics happen. Yeah calling B's there. one except psychopath says something preventable killed parents everything's alright. Yet somehow, still act surprised, knowing administration zero empathy anyone cannot afford private jet. Yeah test death countries do.

&amp;#x200B;

/s (just case need say that) Idiots everywhere. smart people everywhere. difference comes treating idiots. listened to, ignored told go something nice others make decisions ensure decisions executed. 1000 people tested symtoms suspected infected, get 800 positive. 

and next day test 10,000 ransoms likely infected, still got 1000 positive. 

Does mean great less infected percentage second day? mean testing method sucked first day?

Normalising doesn’t work selection criteria testing changes. 

Do honestly think tested number people months ago, would gotten number positive results today? do, that’s would explain thought process, crazy is. Exactly, Vox explained phenomenon video. Effective testing lead negative results, population getting tested. 

More positive results mean place country bad, means testing flawed. Already affected people immediate circles obviously give positive results. testing becomes counterproductive cases. 

Testing wider population help find isolate people larger population. Hence avoiding spread. posted volunteer order Texas town’s FB page multiple people commenting anyone worried stay home one going make wear mask. I’m gonna hide face fear shit. deaths 1/3 peak (680ish), despite cases 15-20k higher peak death time (2k.day)? imply actually better now, despite higher numbers? I'd careful though, apparently there's protesters across Mexico side throwing rocks vehicles American plates. family saying, seems like way we've handled virus bad they'd rather get even people infected.

Kind silly opinion honestly disagree them. considerably smaller population

Not long... “3 million men without cinder blocks remain unaffected.” State tells business close.

You close. almost go bankrupt, make it.

State tells business open. begin recouping losses.

State tells business close. Again. do?

Well, according you, go bankrupt. house taken. entire family homeless. live car eat beans.

That's comment terrible. Because, despite government's continued failures, missteps, lack coherency, still expect everyone vapidly obey everything they're told, they've told wrong three months now. *really* surprised business owners take *the US government* seriously right now? 

Your leader failed steak salesman, elected officials, elected decade, telling citizens distrust experts, still shocked vengeful people take advice authority without question.

The problem business owners, US government making sense, applying rules half-assed, noncommittal matter.

That's subreddit.

I'd insult point, subreddit take kindly things, I'll say: coronavirusvirus material. Welcome aboard, son. NWSL happening right country won’t. states will. mostly agreed upon. Click bait cute everyone puts one guy systemic problem resting shoulders parties (serving masters). Trump going use attack Mexico deflect blame increase poll numbers.

I guarantee it. Reddit experts told deaths US dropping surge cases big deal since deaths didnt increase. /s pretty concerning pharmacist staff wasn’t wearing any. always believed people professions deal health science would take seriously. 

A lot nurses aides however same, especially ones work nursing homes. think it’s ridiculous, even though beaver county cases came nursing home, nursing homes becoming infected. Maybe should. literally makes zero sense. Take break friend. live small southern-middle Tennessee area, high school 1,200 starting back August 7th. masks distancing whatsoever. Buses running too. grades. Right mask isn’t protect wearer. It’s protect others wearer. can’t think anyone want protected someone could unaware do. understanding kids fit description. that’s true elementary schools still closed? new virus. can’t tailor vaccine virus doesn’t exist yet. hard say people went school dont care anyone anymore. I'm days behind, except yeah, 668 spike 2 days ago. Ada/Canyon county case levels exploding deep shit. Boise better pull head ass soon make mandatory mask order... Look silver lining, ruling elite able use crisis fleece people everything could possible want via non-stop blank checks. Oof. Fair enough then. certain tests pick asymptomatic positives, seems pretty incredible. Also thanks factual responses; it’s refreshing jerk reason, sorry. wanna see actually wear one believe crap lol, man blowing hot air mouth.  That’s fair point told phrase bosses years mad went college learned original context. understanding, wear mask keep surroundings safe. slogan ""My Choice, care Body""? Like these: could probably Google US state major metropolitan area easily find articles links PSAs issue. maybe watch nightly news anywhere US? You’re bound see advertisements and/on-air recommendations wear mask. Kinda like Russia's ""sudden uptick pneumonia."" still subpoenas? Thought done ROFL.. think happened NYC? everyone new York State Pennsylvania went NYC die. Get grip reality here. Take cover!!! Shit hit fan!!! Seriously!!! go indoors anywhere circumstances!!! u/ankey answer. add western perspective. family know India expressed mixed feeling incredible expense weddings. Families often spend everything afford. level obligation something US.

My friend showed wedding invitation literally one beautiful things ever seen. probably point soon it'll go places tests. believe Dallas currently today. course seen numbers actually going instead fact we're testing. state hundreds people died tornado believing town get hit twice day, tornadoes cross rivers, tornado sirens let know power back on

Same city even  still take lot time test, unless want risk bunch thalidomide babies flopping around afterward. Every time think government can’t get ridiculous, does. Might dumb question anything aside voting citizens try voice / way Florida handled things okay? Lives stake, I’m sick sitting idle here. East Texas told us shit. girl thank making mandatory mask would mess immune system issues. 

The fuck Texas? OH I've saying since beginning. $300 fines wearing mask (they Taiwan, Japan, etc). speeding tickets. people get point. governors mandating masks without fines weak shit. sound funny second surge coming whether know people not.

That bottom line here.

It becoming well apparent numerous asymptomatic super-spreaders perhaps Typhoid Mary analogues society right now.

Until fix issue go around test everyone country wholesale... going second, third, fourth, etc. surge coronavirus. ban tourist general. singaporean may exception. Probably dead end host. Also, would refute animals produce neutralizing antibody. cuz binds doesnt mean antibody neutralizing. actions

Name Thank saying this. Statistically speaking vaccines even make phase 3. fact, excitement one particular vaccine makes even skeptical. Remember AstraZeneca monetary incentive hype up. Beware snake oil salesman. kid remember hearing Vietnam war body counts Friday morning radio news. 33 Americans killed, 286 Viet Cong killed. traumatized this. caused action streets action congressional seats. group young Americans lived 911 this. Action beginning streets. Australia moment. One states numbers going WAY again, first wave areas curve flattened enough. knew first wave would last months, better spread out. shut might spend summer one open states. Even means can't get medical care. yeah season tickets uhh im going im idiot. hard pass. $25M oh that’s lot yep that’s non-profit you. explains coronavirus raging country. Idiots. won’t say do. No, I'm postulating ""basic game theory"" dictates believe god well. selfish stupid Sounds right , even people see wearing mask leave nose exposed anyways understand China took extreme measures. country virus originated in, several weeks spread idea dealing with, less 1% corona deaths? yet 18.5% world population? doesn’t add up. states US reporting less 50% corona deaths almost many deaths China. would shocked China wasn’t underreporting 50%. Comparing Taiwanese Americans dumb comparison. need type mentality instilled young age. friends still get wearing mask protect yourself, protect others. They're like ""Whaaaa?"" would silly thing like that. can't imagine public shame would get east Asia wearing mask pandemic.

Im sure way. know pharmacy doesnt care health they’ll get hooked cigarettes booze, offer nicotine patches half beer show they’re “best interest” hard all. wear mask whenever go out. point? It’s good depth reply. I’m heading bed early morning ahead I’ll reply back tomorrow devote time. That’s giving average American much credit. basically bots reposting every Fox News, Breitbart, Russian/Chinese fake news article see. Reading hard. thought Georgia country guess that's stonks hit time high. Fuck Tesla. Saint Louis city county well Missouri. shared fb people knew, met “WELL WONT SUPPORTING BUSINESSES ENFORCE IT!” something along lines sheep/mind control. yeah fully understand we’re 50k day. funny anymore. San Fransisco Chronical bite me. 

Anyone want share text article, please?  Headline “Stay Positive”

Are phrasing anymore? russian trolls stoking flames Irony protesters also anti-abortion chanting slogan used pro-abortion movements. Selfish morons. think asking people donate kidney. 

Me wearing mask helps protect *you*. wearing mask could harm *me*. 

It's body risking. body, *my* choice. say wear goddamn mask help protect *everyone.* thought USA worst though. People attend asu academia. effects preexisting conditions. Yes.

Those vaccines wont available 2 years even cant guarantee taken it’s effective large scale. could well cause mutate.

So, cool wearing mask outside rest life? Oh, playing super hero wearing mask saving millions!? isn’t. 

Covid life longer take deal it, harder it’s going to. state, South Australia, flu cases 90% Similar me. Sore throat swollen lymph node felt kinda off. doc said positive test I'm 6 weeks. SoCal, conservative counties. happening NorCal, least Bay Area, numbers still really low. college kid forced pay tens thousands year education forced place COVID going huge risk I’d pissed

you mean one? unique (relative countries) continuing though wealthy exploit crisis personal gain? Everyone else focused prevention, addressing, helping citizens. Burn down, it’s time octopi cockroaches rule. Indian, you? Joke aside, study third party. overthink it. shared link show source, misread statistics seeing provides us worldwide statistics. 

Despite misreading statistic. make said less true true conditions America. unwilling fact plenty places America struggles meet requirements basic amenities.

 I'm fine misread statistic corrected.. means say right next time.



Edit: However..... America, according USDA, 11 million children live homes considered ""food insecure"". many children die malnutrition comparison affected. Many eat enough food considered ""healthy eating"". 

And according dictionary, malnutrition lack proper nutrition, caused enough eat, eating enough right things, unable use food one eat. 

This means, live food insecure home, likely suffering mild possibly severe malnutrition. Meaning numbers approximately 9,451 deaths year, due malnutrition. reflect true numbers children suffer malnutrition. Meaning points still valid state poverty US.. 

If parents 11 million children living food insecure homes lose ability provide little already could. quickly think number children deaths due malnutrition would grow? ~~Fun~~ Terrible fact: peak 50's, polio epidemic caused 25,000 infections year US. Adjusted population growth, 50,000. **A year.** SARS-COV-2 infecting many states **a day** proving every bit deadly crippling.

Let sink in. really scary CA one seems care. Politicians keep talking young need wear masks Gen X, Boomers, beyond seem like wearing masks public I'm at. Seeing guy prison one day warm heart greatly. really screwed original messaging masks ineffective could preserve PPE first responders. COVID symptoms call hotline, ask questions, assess likelyhood infected file ""suspicious case"" likely infected. ""Suspicious cases"" means maybe infected dont know certian unless test you. call back daily check condition symptoms get worse, send ambulance home, take hospital treat you.

They also tell call people contact let know might infected well call hotline process repeats. called hotline asses case ""suspicious"", schedule test public healthcare clinic free.

Basically, get tested symptoms high profile person you/your company pays private test. 

Also, worth note, hospitals dont admit people dont follow hotline process. horror stories news social media people stay home symptoms, deteriorate days, family drives sick person hospital get sent home didnt arrive ambulance via hotline die ride back home hospital ambulance.

Yes, inhuman horrible, whatever worth, goverment clear vocal steps follow infected daily, televised, conference COVID. That’s plan . He’s lying . people routine testing coaches trainers people come clean. It’s gonna completely locked . whole thing let people keep testing every single person inside bubble. I’m curious it’s gonna turn also anyone pull it’s nba . Football seems complex large numbers pull knows. Anyways fingers crossed . Would nice able watch type basketball again.  love country hate people charge. 

Patriot definition-a person vigorously supports country prepared defend enemies detractors

I would consider current administration whole two party system detractors.   He’s parrot, repeating false old theories like supreme leader California plagued serious testing problems since start. per capita testing still low end states like Illinois out-testing us. can’t even test properly, it’s right reopen anything. It’s disheartening see foreign countries random tests can’t even needed tests US, reason US seems much higher ratio them. He'll probably start speaking Russian certain point it. pay taxes rubles. Yeah, thinking least. cut unemployment actually start working right? Whether hired today still get paid earning actual check. imagine call hire back immediately report without giving chance answer. 

If works however could see also caring changed number, could say knowing could hire back onus update you. probably intricacy varies locale. Latin American nation stubbornly shunned wide-scale testing instead runs exams sickest patients.

Clickbait headline heralding garbage fear-mongering article. taxis operate like that. major cities world taxis would summoned street hail. means driver responsibility driving always alert potential riders knowing take without GPS along driving long hours sociable ~30 different personalities per day.

Hell yeah bro...show virus who's got balls...stupid fuck.  It’s slippery slope. People seen enough history know absolutely want give politicians government certain degree control lives. prefer right make bad decision opposed living way someone else says.

What someone noticed influenza rates went way winter wants mandate masks 24/7 October April? would absolutely save lives. go back stay alive 55? ideas sound? send school. Oh, wait! Except potential criminal case claim 5th amendment unless granted immunity prosecution. Either way sure lawyers already hired many people fight Yeah I’m sure even nyc anyone faced fine jail. Especially political climate. Ok USA get it. stop trying breaking records.  virus dissapear along people got infected. maybe Trump wishes. Everyone said thing memorial day Easter. Nothing ever really come it. Even massive protests haven’t caused much spike. Yup, they're letting people REALLY sick take tests. anything, I'm kinda surprised higher countries decided prioritize containment prevention, they're pretty much back normal. Taiwan even expects economic growth year. US decided go around indefinitely.  Cases deaths spiking Mexico yet I've seen many people saying Mexican people taking seriously? case lying? 🤔 got way makes sense, fine dining \~\~experience\~\~ issues whatsoever eating $2 tacos car wait side effects sterilization... right? /s FrEEdOM!!!1!

Please careful words, that's misinformation hysteria spread. hospital bit different we’re profit pediatric hospital. That’s say don’t make money, don’t stockholders board members answer to, CEO potentially questionable morality. excess revenue supposed put back hospital, nice facilities lot really cool stuff kids.

We also serve extremely diverse population. Pretty much real revenue made elective surgeries (we’ve got big orthopedic sports medicine program pulls big bucks), lot patients Medicaid uninsured. significant portion patients end paying little nothing all, depending what’s going on. Medicaid reimbursement rates set government. 

We’re teaching hospital/research hospital get funding that. lot funding actually comes donations. Atlanta lot generous famous people love donate hospital raise money us. would never able amazing things kids without that.

The biggest issue right we’re process building new multi billion dollar hospital finished building huge comprehensive care clinic new office support building. amount money went unthinkable.

Add that, spring one busiest times elective orthopedic surgeries kids break, none surgeries happened. They’ll made eventually, parents still holding rescheduling uncertainty everything. things haven’t bounced back quite quickly hoped, since kids weren’t much months, ER visits time low well. also outpatient/rehab clinics urgent cares closed months. around, money wasn’t coming in.

i know job didnt job.. i'd get fired pritty quickly! You’re right thing, keep even though it’s hard. don’t know long term effects thing. Atlanta sub someone tracks daily increases tests, infections deaths. even check DPH website everyday poor layout 2020, person simplifies it. Ever heard sheep getting COVID? neither. keep saying too.

It’s far trump territory though... unknown infections 10x back peak, testing lot hidden cases lot lower.

Rediculous Truly, don’t try him. I’m honestly starting wonder he’s troll stuff says ignorant. He's right though, factor testing positive test rates number cases actually less earlier year deaths still trending down.

Took words right mouth. rider driver doesn’t mask it’s covering nose ask put getting accepting ride say thanks cancel ride? I’m female definitely see someone saying ok putting one we’re driving there’s hostility, danger resentment building car you’re locked someone rocker starts showing anger you’re car. total number deaths baseline much higher recorded death count covid, grow even larger angry little troll. Wilfully stubborn communicate properly, seem unhinged hysterical. Oh, irony. deal Amish work sometimes know arent concerned, although Lancaster county one hit pretty hard, large Amish community. (the largest know locally)  governors/leaders better others. data state shows that. Yes, White Mountain Apache tribe getting hit even harder right (per % pop). Here’s summary narrative stats time progressed (flor clarity I’m referencing rolling 7-day daily average):

Cases started mid March; increased plateau around 1,000/day mid April. Tests followed suit hit ~8,000/day ~11% positive beginning plateau. “lock down” seeing effects early spread lock down. 

From April case plateau dipped rose ~1,250/day end May. Daily tests steadily rose ~20,000/day, % positive steadily fell ~6%. *The test % positive trend lines inversely mirrors fairly well (this good thing).* started opening back up, seeing effects spread lock down. 

First two weeks June saw cases slowly rise ~2,000/day. Testing rose ~20k ~30k; % positive also rose ~6% ~8% *(this bad thing)*. beginning effects opening back up. 

Mid June present cases started jumping much higher growth rate. Cases went ~2,000/day ~6,000. Testing also rose ~30k 40k/day. % positive rose even higher growth rate 8% ~14%+ *(this very, bad thing)*. effects generally shitty mitigation participation collective whole, virus already extensive presence population still massive untapped viral reservoir available (unaffected people). 

Sooooo think it’s safe say virus spreading...well, virally. virus literally viruses do. It’s exactly scientists, medical professionals, even common persons know viruses do. virus isn’t political, nothing summarized is. Yet federal state leadership continue act like it’s something different. Fortunately good amount local leaders recognize significance acknowledge reality it. Unfortunately hands tied state leadership. It’s truly shame fed state leadership cannot look without political lenses eyes. Definitely relevant, virus hit hard enough needed hospitalized, chances serious lingering problems.    Saw news annual checkup Tokyo. gonna suck... Quite what? Weekend data doesn’t compile like Monday, next couple weeks crucial time deaths reported death rates 9/11 per day 9/11 every week.

That’s refer death rates.... numbers, disasters. feel like shot hits little harder nose. Yeah, really really fucked great PR machine running Country half population think we've single handedly cured world disease. Oh British. That's true. New Yorkers pretty good complying masking order since became mandatory. government responsibility lead educate. public follow. leaders. That's problem. don’t think that’s true. started production. considering pain went regarding Coronavirus, may fight pick order help avoid 2nd surge. mention previous courts ruled government gets extraordinary powers ignore civil rights order protect greater public clear eminent threat. another low death rate. MEDIA CANCER! Well yes, right, can't left free infected, longer personal business. Predictions get 100k per day US. Outside US, Latin cultures heavily influenced Romans language included Spain, Portugal Italy. Non-US / non-Canadian Americas prefer use Latin American Hispano American also highlight strong indigenous heritage, different purely European  Fooking right. Tell bruh !  much world choosing China US like choosing get stabbed shot.  I’m career bartender last ten years, San Francisco, California Maui, Hawaii.

Our bar Hawaii shut day St. Patrick’s day reopened today. best friend went back work today pleading to, he’s right now.

Bar lives don’t matter around people willfully partying close proximity pandemic given extreme social anxiety. disconnect reality people want party jarring disturbing.

I’ll homeless month, I’m proud choice I’ve made. Reopening bars right downright evil selfish. I’m walking away industry permanently. That's thinking too. understand it. don’t, haven’t met one spanish speaking person uses term. think it’s younger generation uses pc. question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies. Now, properly respond entire comment move on. Damn good times. remember playing bunch GameCube games. people sacrificing rest us benefit immunity. nothing Christian patriotic risking life fellow countrymen. Totally agree. University Alabama students *already* throwing COVID parties. Well there's people still get message. think pretty clear masks=help keep economy open. someone can't comprehend now, they're lost cause. True, modern healthcare permit us freak much. 1% death rates occurred numerous times throughout human history.

That said death rate bubonic plague even modern treatment still ~10%. COVID-19 amateur stuff pandemics without modern medical care. argue people died COVID-19 (elderly, extremely unhealthy, nursing home patients) wouldn’t even alive time past pandemics. become cult thought. People simply can’t accept reality accuse everyone fearmongering dismiss discredit.

Unfortunately, cult thought cuts ways. sustain other. Aren’t supposed lie prone help breathing? Yeah don’t think that’s even remotely true. Also remember people may need multiple doses could take weeks work. we’ll get million essential. Remember Governor Luis Miguel claimed poor people “immune” coronavirus? accurately, protests acted suppress sources spread. example, people areas protests stayed home, restaurants bars near protests visited, etc.. 

Basically enforced social distancing, balanced protest's lack social distancing. 

Net zero, far measured. Lol wut? postulating one atheist real get covid real wear mask ""Believe god"" . clue wtf talking about. Many 'brand name' ones actually owned small businesses. Despite evidence contrary still substantial number people think death count overinflated. arguments are:

1. They're including probable counts! Early testing abysmal many deaths went untested, much less problem now.
2. Birx said Mortality rate inflated 25%, OK random unattributed quote mortality rate mortality.
3. 3.Hospitals get paid Covid deaths! Ummm, pretty sure hospitals reimbursed based upon death certificates.
4. 4.Vast Global Conspiracy undercount illuminati, Elvis, someone something, idea.

I miss any? Notice based upon fairy crazy suppositions actual data, know like excess death toll. street, actually insist Trump told people drink Clorox? That’s good boy, repeat lie. Maddow proud you. He’ll, I’m proud you. It’s admirable continue lie certain way. Army. treated us special. Also guess mention SERE-C can't trust adults follow rules, guys nuts thinking kids will. luckily 2 masks came pack. commissioner someone plans falling “daily tested” category . dunno going pull tests see . Also understanding staying private housing world wide sports Disney . played national basketball tournament back highschool def seems like place pull . facilities monstrous. Jesus Christ country incredibly stupid. It’d miracle got pandemic without significant amount deaths long-term crisis. would powers said “**This avoid shutting economy**”. aged well means covid like sympthoms likely covid Execute president already. may richest nation, clever person leads Trump fucking idiot vaccine least year away, herd immunity costs lot lives. Neither good. No, normalizing shows way March peaks rising. Polls got head. confirm. chalupas three times last week.  wonder many undocumented immigrants. would less safety net fall back on. !Remindme 2 weeks population 64 would agree disagree IFR coronavirus .1% lower? Mexico nowhere near medical infrastructure NYC. coming make comment Honestly comes ride-sharing, masks seem like moot point. people sitting inside metal within 6 feet extended period time. Mask mask, going spread. Ride-sharing pandemic really thing. No, equally deadly Im trying play all. lag deaths. case spikes started. week 2 see death count this. Also, lock get smart soon, cases continue rise we'll alot death.

Nothing going change unless blue wave orange shit stain perfectly fine America dying. private public insurance. Full residency till 2022... larger concern need navigate en español. hospitals avoid, terms important listen use? 

I type fast google translate, things know different. Acetaminophen paracetamol example... 

Once cross platitudes general light conversation, run words.

I revisit insurance cards come plan need it. Stay safe! shouldn't. one who's survived complicated severe case compares flu. He's adding bits information bolster credibility. US beginning. It’s bit better now. people never able admit wrong. Chances it’s not. Something like 13% less make three phases. lot high hopes marketing make especially doubt one. Education system different. Malaysia school holidays mid-March, end May early June, mid-August, late November early January. However, due COVID-19, end-year holiday lessened 6 weeks 2 weeks. sure holiday August, probably holiday cancelled still super low daily deaths. Fuck shit. Dun dun dunnnnn! same, bad much broader. fast will. also ban anyone covid joining military. mean get kill career? Thanks!! aren’t even allowed Europe foreseeable future. never happened history. 

I suspect that's true. global wars.  common situation lack resources test adequately rather intentionally masking deaths. countries might try hide deaths even levels authorianism censorship needed hide large numbers deaths successfully. nope, quarantine Hahaha! What? Why? Also zero healthcare support. Husband’s unit covid going around, he’s wearing mask, washing hands etc. newborn (2 months tomorrow!) I’ve crying fear baby getting Covid. get Covid, likelihood dying? can’t seem find anything reliable except stories succumbed illness. anxious stressed thinking correctly, I’m scared. advice statistics help understand could happen newborn almost infant would greatly appreciated. Thank you. Cause friend wanted see battle Gettysburg cases spiked, also made sure wear masks public areas. even gloves could pump gas. took right precautions stay safe, day trip little travel involved. Masks already required entering businesses. expanded public areas. Hm.. Hoyt? asymptomatic super spreaders hosting parties working enemy (CV), charged crime? Especially someone dies due willful negligence? Read article... I’m Mac attack!!!!!! Maybe noticed we've got nationwide protests riots going moment, people wearing masks give form protection perfect still get infected. I'm saying people wear masks going gathering literal thousands protest helping anyone. think he's tired waiting first real win. This... absolutely this. never first wave end. moved New York Alabama, Florida Texas. Trump mask. Gun flag shirt. 

Me saw them: 

“Hey masks don’t work don’t wear nose. It’s pretty simple stuff. You’re wearing protect others, it’s personal decision - it’s health code mandated requirement.” They've moved (again) ""Yeah, infection rates big, nobody dying!"". yesterday saw highly-shared propaganda blue-check Twitter claiming ICUs Texas full COVID sufferers, people avoided going hospital long afraid contracting virus.

It'd funny, ability people forget literally freaking happened month two ago, damn tragic. Hypoethically may something planned end month travel Nashville. odds bars still going open? How’s vibe feeling locally city going open / closed avoidable it’s pathetic, people wanna act like children wear masks solely don’t wanna listen they’re told something. People actually trying justify behavior saying can’t wear mask “They ant breathe” well neither people ventilators decisions.

I love America, I’d lying said people hear intelligent Yeah I'd like try contact trace country like India. Talk cheap, truth is, incredibly difficult/downright impossible contain virus undeveloped/overpopulated countries. exit vi without saving comment? happened New Mexico today. $100 fine wear 20m insanely high guesstimate number infections US. might interest - one -- hundreds vaccine candidates, multiple 3 design.

I think new design called mRNA vaccines. They've working years, think made trials yet. Private plans? hire group protesters travel countries allow in. Groups protesters far scientifically proven method avoid virus. think otherwise amounts crimes humanity. I'm sure kiss hug thing makes much difference, UK hardly kiss hug anybody, Sweden social distancing practically normal behaviour, Countries hit hard.

It probably makes differences numbers, spending time groups, indoors, issue Half state obese diabetic. time bomb. Yeah shit. good chunk people know take seriously trust literally information SCHRÖVID-19 Thank explaining well, PleasantWay7. thinking going case different strain others going around.  Go grocery store buy cheaper food? Schools opening anywhere, kidding. Well, historically speaking, Africans used guinea pigs deliberately infected deadly  going wins elections? hillary, biden, honest, seemed like hillary better chance. YEAH SAYS GOTTA SLOW TESTING! I'm doctor.. I'm someone good, know - Trump Nice UK, Spain, Italy, France Sweden COVID deaths per capita US...

Just wait. 😭  right USA.

Your budget SA States America.

You fumbling united part century really dropped ball 2016 trump elected. news biased, politicians bought lack education welfare breed conspiracy theories zealots political ideological. Edit: Wow it’s like written new slogan part obscurantists: “Don’t trust experts!” new buzzword, too, anyone admires competence, knowledge, learning skill, wishes spread around. People like called “elitists.”  rubber bullets flashbangs? want move back California it’s home state need mental health. It’s terrible position though, California virus cases going exponential, cost living higher, Maui incredibly “safe” comparison. don’t feel like belong - especially now.

Thank kind words though. I’ll getting counseling soon manage. 90% people died 55 older. 

I'm trying diminish threat older, considering demographic website... pretty much going die covid.

I read complications several weeks. stay home wear mask I'm asshole, can't speak long term side effects frequently occurs. 

I parents care about. care parents. everything protect certainly vulnerable. 

I care you, too. assuming 40 younger, *probably* going fucking fine.  10 people aint party Capatalism downplay this? They’ve saying beginning countries something rather sitting around waiting. Well right alarming people deaths sky high, every since yesterday deaths spiking. people start taking seriously coming week deaths catch cases. 3-5 days

Literally happening month he's fucking homeless buying mcdonalds? Reduce risk secondary infections weakened patients. turn post tomorrow Jesus Christ, forgot Gobert touching mics. Seems like lifetime ago... 3-5 days
Uhh no? Literally happening month now. imagine, gone memorial day. great? What's worse millions believe him, sycophants enable media empires parrot word gospel. Car accident deaths cause people still road driving faster recklessly: swine flu Damn, knew meant literally still less sheep! See 4 weeks he's proved right. Thanks USA definitely intending give 25 % share global fatalities.... point ain't afraid, understand would we? students lead charge online tell us run lives they're differently developed nations /s likely removed repost, news came week ago. idiot sharing drinks bar even GoFundMe set medical bills doesn’t even know amount yet point could simply say ""Our tactic always herd immunity""? Cause that's basically looks like, regardless whatever measures sane scientists say need, stupid people always fuck things up. No, arguing calling Dr., all! curious O2 levels might behave pneumonia. Thanks!  We’re #1! No, humans, confirmed transmitting traveling?! Stay home! 😂 resources help you. agree people going PTSD. aren’t alone this. I’ve called New York State emotional support hotline advice twice helpful. Maybe Hawaii something like that? Also Covidsupport subReddit haven’t used it.

Even though isolated, aren’t alone. people world living alone home suffering crippling loneliness isolation. We've known couple months, victims died without tested, tested died therefore counted tally. guys ignoring hospital capacity, already limits parts AZ, TX states. we're getting started again. Schools re-opening, closed Halloween. beginning beginning... ""new normal"" shit going last 13 years?

It wont even last 13 months lol BLM Lmao wtf I've heard estimates maybe 5%.

We'd need hit 60%.

Oh, btw. clear immunity lasts 6 months. No, problem dumb shits like traveling pigeon forge middle pandemic. worst offenders aren’t tourist traps, full people like spreading disease. 

You’re worst offender. Well remember... common pneumonia. one relative taken hospital Maryland died pneumonia almost 10 years ago, test flu even though even doctors knew pneumonia caused flu.

So surprised doctors putting pneumonia death cause instead testing CoVid, getting positive test, putting CoVid death. New Hampshire (I think Nashua place mandate). LA County free drive testing everyone even without symptoms. 2 logical explanations higher number cases lower deaths:

- Reduction fatality: Either mutations make virus slightly less dangerous better treatment protocols now. maybe risky group elders people pre-condition might already experienced decease.

- Increased testing count. test find people illness. limited testing you’d spend testing -likely covid- patients whereas you’d test suspicion. 

In general, pretty sure 50k new cases today. spend millions test per day you’d see number go up. USA #1 BABY 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸 I’m officially going start gufundme move Alabama. 

Fuck Yeah well probably also get fired killing someone, so. folks would put guns heads play Russian Roulette. 

It’s mind blowing.  Sorry go man. It’s hassle I’ve hard time keeping folks away thing. know it’s race time disease. hope delay us catching another month get better treating it, cause south people treating like hoax. think trying get fact asymptomatic / slight symptomatic cases going radar. Phrasing bit weird.  friends live Texas month ago asked people handling Coronavirus there. exact words “Texans don’t care shit” ....orrr welcome it? forefathers did. 25th amendment time Fuck prick. response 6 months ago. AMLO president said virus wasn’t dangerous shouldn’t stop “hugging” other.  Real scary dude claims lost parents real sick still things flu. can't believe people.   Good news nobody 40 gives shit.
Anybody 40 remembers gonna go one hit wonders concert. I’m also CT actually running around today grocery store, picking takeout, picking things two stores didn’t see SINGLE person without mask awesome.

I’m ready get complacent could blow I’m really happy things going feels really good able get back normal routines, even they’re slightly modified versions. really feel people living states three months ago.  unfortunately know many people would club various reports together, would mean virus transmissible however lethal used began spreading 6 7 months ago. make good point. would certainly back assertion big deal. Id say hes way beyond useless. 

At start kept minimizing issue, even said couldnt get infected ""the mexican people give love strenght, stay healthy"". got heavily criticized, stopped touring country side went silent issue 2 months, leaving subsecretary health handle everything.

About 2 3 weeks ago went vocal saying reactivate economy, go normal best way prevent disease GET INFECTED. 

Now hes back rallies touring country. I'll answer one points. Yes manufacturing capability time. know this? getting masks sent in-laws Taiwan. remember back PPE. Yes agree government fucked us throughout entire process, gonna argue that. enacted Defense Production Act January, like south korea swabs, whatever past hate Indian food. love it. dine Indian restaurants feel like need change clothes take shower afterward.  find many hosts possible it’s lethal? Oh surge, plenty coming. like April. Jesus guy fucking idiot. state gonna go fast. better crowded bar guess.  lol fair, treatment disaster back then. far far better techniques now. Back put people ventilators seems often caused trouble helped. country believers top comment/question! 10x number seem outright bogus me.

Or means something specific directly translatable speed spread known time, though absolutely possible, documented instances young asymptomatic persons strokes etc. clotting issues come covid. seems perfectly likely silent damage could done areas. ""Possibly"" uncertain times might well true, peer reviewed scientific fact but.... Well it. No, that's azithromycin. Ebola terrifying CFR averaging 50% means it’s probably least 100 times deadly compared COVID-19. would truly end world type global pandemic worse Black Death.

COVID-19 bad virus CFR healthy young people working age low. Even overall CFR exceptionally low compared historical pandemics.

Ebola simply isn’t even ballpark. imagine 99.9% people would take Ebola outbreak extremely seriously. actual fuck? May good karma come kid, thank you. look, I'd bet Seminole Blue. Cars shop, took Uber today, literally says wear mask open app, book ride finalize payment. Three times. Anyone claiming didn’t know throwing fit lonely itching fight. Yes virus lethal enough overwhelm hospitals, inevitably causes lockdowns quarantine makes less likely spread. trump. virus sort dissappear. thinking reeection chances. I've taking notes places I've people I've seen, case. 

A trip grocery store? write down. Gas station? thing. 

Paranoid? Yup. procedure marks first successful lung transplant COVID-19 patient South Korea ninth world, said.  transports reported China, United States Austria.Hallym University Sacred Heart Hospital said patient recovered point breathing undergoing rehabilitation program restore physical strength.  critically ill patient hospitalized Feb. 29 immediately put respirator. conditions worsened, doctors put ECMO machine next day.  coronavirus soon disappeared body, lungs began harden, requiring transplant, doctors said. murderer. Congratulations afraid murdering people. help understand - OK talking someone right? 

I ask since I'm curious understand coming from. believe things yet I'm part group (""righties"") said converse called ""fucking dumb"". OK converse someone like me? video? Like shit like saw Wuhan NYC? Say now? ever Mexico, even Latin America? Someone finally got head would help re-election? let thing get even bananas, long would take reach herd immunity? terms months. Seems like that's honestly best bet anyway? heard news vaccine quite time. Weve already locked down. Idk. Seems like way through. Thoughts? It’s posted pro China account, intention. described heroin addiction counselor “this fine” comic. 

Even better sequel “this fine”.

/s !Remindme 4 weeks question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies. Now, properly respond entire comment move on. average serial interval seems around 4 days. copy pasted reply earlier. Answer question, assumption anything question “did Trump tell people inject Clorox?” know answer. won’t answer it. You’d rather argue 10 years, said, attempt gaslight people thinking said that. Fucking tell it. I’ve lost faith society’s institutions opinion humanity declined. I’m slowly feeling slipping towards nutjob grid guy lives nothing bunch guns ammo small cabin Rockies. outside distanced beach fine.

At point bugs bunny gif sawing Florida ocean seems totally reasonable. Think see 75K day next week? sure legal Canadian government limit/restrict outbound travel US also? know infrastructure really facing direction Canadian side border maybe roadblock checkpoints etc restrict people going US. sure without sweetness Haha this. Good catch. FOH! people stupid? Seriously.

I actually medical condition makes wearing mask agonizing ordeal. Guess what? **I anyway!** seems like people equate reopening bars safe go bars cost lies seeing hospitalizations control? They're slightly higher couple weeks ago. Say now. AMERICANS. ARE. SELFISH.  That’s made money 90s 2000s. Buying houses flipping them. I’m happy think region California would need penalty first warning. Many statement Newsom. Thanks lot info Guatemala’s state!! Really helpful, yeah I’ve thought days decided going GT best thing bc end day I’ll earn almost nothing Honduras.

Our curfew ID basically go every 2 weeks. two days ago tried make per month based license plate (long story) reversed utterly stupid. see making transit even worse coming weeks.

I think it’s bad you’re confining population strictly. It’s safer people travel car resorting taxis, etc. Remember majority people don’t cars. yeah, could see others might think strict curfew isn’t bad. best, think it’s half-assed measure combat COVID. Even wealthy footballers detained cars violating curfew. 

TL;DR - Guatemala Honduras simply fcked opinion. think I’m better financially healthcare wise Guatemala. NFL declaration fuck grandma Unless mean non-medical masks, ie, cloth face coverings. Even we're halfway 2020 would surprise there's 200-300,000 human beings dead Christmas. Soo certain get vaccine end year? still long ways go? Articles like proof responsible journalism dead. Houston biggest protests city **and** biggest increase cases exactly two weeks later.

There nearly [two week (11.4±3 days)
between exposure resulting infections reported

**60,000** protesters crowded downtown June **2**, **10,000** June **8**, long enough incubate illness become contagious symptoms show keep number new cases reported Houston June **16** *more twice* previous single-day record, shattered June **20**, June sudden reopening businesses account this. Texas started lifting restrictions **April 17**, continued gradual steps states way **June second protest 15 days record June 23, rate new infections began **decrease**. large protests June 8, business restrictions continued lifted June 19. literally means replacing protests open businesses *reduced* infection rate. could clearer evidence protests, **not** businesses, primary cause spike.

There way competent journalists could unaware Houston suddenly becoming one top 10 hot spots country, absolutely criminal intellectual dishonesty. truth politically correct, worth *killing* people PC telling probably way positive covid cases, testing everyone? must pretty bad Mexico then. What? brain melted.

Edit add: walk back. guess read polls.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide  lot people US think contact tracing going used bullshit tracking containing virus.

I mean, will. US government pretty long rich history breaching privacy freedom times crisis abusing basically ever afterwards.

It's conspiratorial report well recorded facts. Also according sources Reddit understand sarcasm, read past headlines. Aside, sunglasses also help anxious lowering sensory intake. definitely good emotional bubble. both. People elect politicians, turn influence people go look stats tests per million population. Sorting figure assuming 1 test per person percentages. 

USA #27 105,302 tests per million (10.5% tested)

India #139 6,562 tests per million (0.65% tested)

Bangladesh #148 4,781 tests per million (0.48% tested)

It's insane India performed 9 million tests. imagine pretty crazy think there'd videos posted people left dead streets. Border counties reported large spikes field workers live dorm-like conditions want tested fear losing work. I'm sure common country. fair, we've able narrow original hosts pretty well. coincidence bats nearly identical virus. 

It gives bit explanation ended Wuhan bats found southern China.

There's also weirdness fall suggests circulating China already, strange fixation China military games October. know frustrated, that's terrible thing hope for. hope people die still vote fucker one hundred reasons. thinking 25%

I hope hell right. lower rim states going really test waters bad get... hope least 50% less lethal it'll bonkers otherwise CHI-na gonna pay fer it! SERE aircrew never force fed water. 

They got us propaganda, shoved us small boxes cages hoods on, torture. Air Force training Fairchild. 2019, too. taking fake Gucci belt 2020. right. lot us entitled babies. 

I too, astonished extreme version entitled babies see yeah. 

Entitled babies. Japan's approach well. Yes, is. countries don’t utilization rates profit margins health care, knowledge rule fucking dumb. Coronavirus *is* political. is. I'm sorry like reality pretending change anything. shitting open, relevant, forward moving discussion. aversion discussing politics exactly formed information bubbles became divided begin with. Good job, part problem. suppress actual infected rate, cause promise way higher we're told. remember sitting class learning 1300 cases USA. worried really scared. think day school closed distance learning started. feels like day years ago findings suggest COVID-19 less deadly originally thought death rate disease could range 0.1%.

You seem added 0 there. appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* damn churros report subset adults severe Covid hospitalized, mild moderate, even severe cases. especially address children rarely develop severe case typically present virus differently adults.

Here first large scale study Europe children Covid. children sick enough see doctor diagnosed Covid, small chance bad outcome Thats really good point helps understand mentality better. put 10 seats apart stands Americans got could within 10 weeks nobody would able work industry would shut down, would stores buy food from, medical care anyone, nobody looking care homes, nobody bury dead. something America considering? We’ll see happens. Either way Vegas isn’t closing back anytime soon, unless gets 10x worse lack compliance sane regulations, breakdown public order general lack public good quite extraordinary. think relativizing situation helps solve it. US moment behaving like developing country developed one. acquaintance diabetes mild case COVID confirmed PCR recovered fine. Never hospitalized; never seriously ill. one looked like title much better understanding weeks. 

Experience harsh teacher. don’t know going happen. don’t know daily deaths catch new cases. don’t know big peak climbing. don’t know long plateau. really don’t know shit. don’t know shit either. Especially compared Fauci actual health. 

Smh.

This uncharted territory. It’s novel virus we’ve opened up. We’re middle big *experiment.* officially highest per capita. going “let wash over” 400 million people route. 

Shit might get real. Either way it’s gonna lot dead people. Minimum. *know* that. go again! hurt anyways. sure 40% bmi morbid mark....but definitely obese.  Big numbers coming Murica day 4 July. Gonna huuuge. hüge, cömrades, hüge. Yes! inside grocery store since February either. 

Curbside pickup god-send. always buy touch extra, case missing something. 

Then put everything non-perishable box let sit days 'grocery quarantine' love planning committee meetings board meetings reopen schools taking place via Zoom. Doesn’t say something?? Deaths skyrocket overwhelms healthcare burns nursing homes.

It’s already supposedly killed something like 12% nursing home residents New Jersey.

What happens hits Villages Florida even 1/4th hard? got 'they're releasing total number people tested, number infected.'  Yes, person believes faked, problem believing sources 4-5 weeks ago said virus suppressed lockdown efforts. Even believe they're calculating math, fact increasing rapidly still main point. clear - point intending answer question? I’ve responded multiple times asked nicely. Level don’t intend answering; feel like broken record. stock market great, whole bunch stocks time highs. Apparently feeds suffering poor. social distancing self isolating. live Boston, hit pretty hard right beginning along NY/NJ... say Massachusetts (and really north east general) actually good job way handled it. finally got number new cases way down...it’s ridiculous rest country might go didn’t want take seriously.

Back individual states scrambling buy much needed supplies masks, feds seizing “their supply” 👎 real leadership federal level, it’s basically shit show 🥴 sang let’s stay together Agreed! don’t want information interfering schools opening fall. 😐 Belgium, UK, Spain, Italy, France Sweden COVID deaths per capita US (all countries seemingly making earnest efforts track account related COVID deaths, btw - can’t say China; cases deaths miraculously disappeared whole March..?) say literally everything shut across entirety Europe laughable.

Holy shit that's is. I've whenever exercising since high school, pain ass. Thank you. Lt Gov already record people die Dow Guess that's kinda important deaths? Maybe give real fucking numbers people take fucking seriously. Sounds like American problem, actually. order get tested, patients needed kind 'population risk' list (hiv, cancer, 60+), seriously sick.

One cases personally know wait till day 16 17 virus evolution get tested, requested day 9, right could hardly breathe. point tested, pretty much system already. took another 6 days let know results. 

A lot people died waiting tested, deemed unnecessary, waste kit dead person? Oh god wanna squash toad know Barbosa NY ways making miserable pay, like making impossible renew driver's license renew registration. 

They fuck around Tomorrow:Highest day record, day that: Highest day record countries generally prepared pandemic huge contract tracing teams PPE stockpiles medical workers.


Agreed, countries like China advantage authoritarian giving shit welding people's doors shut. another one variables make difficult form conclusion.

However, look like western Europe citizens governments enforcing mask policies fairly strictly they're much better despite densely populated.

I really think harmful we'd seen now. may cut spread see sign increasing spread. Death lag infections 14-21 days though. 75k decent ballpark time period anyway. hear Easter gone. We'll big beautiful Easter. Can’t values you’re dead. Well, world listening experts much better. 

This shit situation, perhaps silver lining lessons learned collective action good governance? I'm you. saved much possible since March afford work end year thankfully. Unsure asking sarcastically, reelected get X years continue making stupid decisions without worry losing power. imagine it'll blow four years so, either get four years improve image despite covid failures, four years profit seen afore mentioned video Yeah. I'm obviously speaking hypothetically, hate ""new normal"". Lol Yeah, obese exactly healthy. liberty core value conservative worldview isn’t core value liberal worldview. 

To understand encourage read *The Righteous Mind: Good People Divided Politics Religion* Jonathan Haidt. He’s liberal professor moral psychologist goes depth behind this. It’s excellent book. Far much Reddit comment amateur like me. 

Would love us get back topic hand I’m genuinely curious hear answer - what’s science I’m rejecting? I'll bite show one study, actual study fox news report, shows covid deaths counted. avoid Fox News staying ignorant whole life fine. Read, stay informed, expand sources ask many reputable writers experts can, fine. people grew world without easy access information. easily better use it. Even better trying herd immunity (which is, might add, intentionally murdering ""couple"" people) Coronaviridae family viruses notorious often short term immune response long-term one. 

So yeah, country essentially trying stick proverbial dick lawnmower pull string repeatedly hoping engine start. Unbelievable... Truly Somewhere first days November _is_ states. Many chose continue choose heed CDC/WHO guidelines going wind collectively screwing us over. I'm living Oklahoma right now, fucking atrocious.

I can't tell many times I've person entire store wearing face mask. went Walmart today probably 75% packed store wearing face masks.

Restaurants Bars opened almost immediately. worked one, started working April. People constantly ignored social distancing guidelines, never wore masks, coughing freely without covering it.

The preoccupation bars drinking Wisconsin embarrassing. Everyone certain age think badge honor instead blight state.

So, course, re-open bars, see normal buffoons coming droves plunge us pandemic.

It would surprise spikes mostly tied bars. Municipalities shut bars immediately.

My question legitimate deserves answer. I’m ignoring science, want know it. I’ve nothing respectful you, return favor. Completely inaccurate. Many deaths active patients handled diagnosed ""atypical pneumonia"" "" probable covid infection"", diagnoses tallied active cases positive cases.

Many end death without positive covid diagnosis, similar way Florida handling cases. Canadian lives works Mexico, admit lack language skill terrified catching anything, husband follow strict decontaminate everything leave house/return. 4 walls every day last 4 months, except Costco Walmart.

Gtfo here, literally millions examples defeat pessimistic pandering. Musk always entitled asshole. attitude helped build companies odd, also make someone would want work with. Nothing. passing cheap shot. Gratuitous. one live. summarizer bot, Here's summary Florida added 6,563 cases Wednesday, pushing total number known infections nearly 159,000, according report Florida Department Health. Palm Beach County 297 new cases 14,447 cases 526 deaths. California Texas 5,600 cases day past week, nation’s three populous states. per capita basis, Florida reported coronavirus infections U.S. state.

[**Try Summarization API necessarily bad, long rate stays goes lower. remember death rate may low less past weeks infected cases rises, cause die instantly. However, rise significantly weeks. part Alabama understand? Indian here, gonna chime worse guys think. ( somewhat poorly ) implemented lockdown back March around 5000 cases. ended creating migrant labour crisis definitely helped spread virus rural areas.
The lockdown certainly helped slow spread virus, we're opening now, exactly wrong time since number cases going up. 

I personally know we're opening ( I'm assuming economical/political reasons ) govt less acting like cases slowing although states hit really hard ( that's ignoring cyclones earthquakes hitting country recently ) running supplies (Maharashtra West Bengal mainly ) states pushed lockdown end July help, enough. 

tldr: Situation good, going get better time soon sneaking suspicion long urban India handles it, parties call win, rural India suffer u/summariser_bot Ot could common cold.    semantics? cares?  one might actually present challenge one little girl cant solve completely ignoring geography issue. Everywhere protests seeing spikes. case increase gross negligence southern state governments. NY/MA/WA/NJ/MI first get it, accounted 90% cases US. states declining numbers without spikes. like US whole initially ignored lessons learned China/Italy, southern states politicized ignored situation northern states. finally got virus significant enough levels spread terribly within region. states spiking ones reopened weeks earlier Northeast, despite warnings it. also ones mandating mask uses indoors, far important anything else states do. Bars restaurants spreading covid far rapidly outdoor protests are. starts specifically telling bars restaurants shut back down, even another full lockdown.

If think Northeast ran old people get sick that's rates spiking, delusional. That’s unfortunately true. could see hundred thousand cases day year easily something done. right. thinking China testing 11 million people, entire city, without issues all. outsource testing competent authority China. love outsource one situation would certainly endorse it. know trust testing numbers CDC. reading, doubt able test 30 million people. yes, test entire communities covid control. Outdated test results perfectly fine still let get snapshot going given area. true. course protests impact transmission rate, many protesters honestly seen without mask? many, all. Plus outdoors helped, def impact spread rates sure. Difference is, we're fighting revolution true oppression biggest civil rights movement generation, people whine haircuts, able drink bar, call masks 'muzzling muh freedumbs' even close thing. that's said everyone thinks I'm overreacting ""kids get it"" deliberately infected part army program accelerate coronavirus penetration select units continuity effective fighting units. take fmla? sure ""unit"" refers hopefully could try route? well~ thanks captain obvious None numbers scare me. I’m much worried worldwide starvation human trafficking. I’m asshole doesn’t wear mask. I’m dick head doesn’t care fear death. Let live.

The state Tennessee, example, week ago finally decided age big priority they're triage system comes mean he's wrong he? Everyone keeps screaming derp immunity. Trump saying thing. Let's get everyone sick virus burns out. /s


Herd immunity fairy tale. don’t get people refusing acknowledge disease dealt feburary April. 

Back then, excess deaths everywhere control. clear cases undercounted. 

excess deaths normalized despite economic activity increasing known cases exploding worldwide false positives... district required plan August 15 based guidance governor released. plan must 3 stages matching stages region plan. region Phase 1-3 school online, Phase 4 hybrid either online class mandated mask wearing, Phase 5 full person masks recommended. Ever hear Ostrich getting Covid? Think president might something head sand. keep thinking I've COVID symptoms since lte March (either anxiety/depression + new allergies), family want us ""put strain system"" getting tested. -_- Temp checks epitome pandemic response theater imo. majority spread ASYMPTOMATIC carriers show symptoms (including fever). Obviously effect, instituting temp checks saying “we’re good” shit response. Nationwide Protests Caused COVID-19 Spike (So Far.) Here's Learn 122,300 excess deaths, 95,235 attributed Covid-19, said.

So count possibly 25%. Nowhere close claim factor 10. Coronavirus black plague. 1-1.5% growth per year normally, even absolute worst case half population gets sick, set population numbers back couple years.

If want put tinfoil hat on, better conspiracy theory government wants save pensions disability benefits allowing virus kill elderly, diabetics people heart diseases. take advise scientists science matter, taking advice then?? think going 1 - 2 million flu season killed 80k (just putting things perspective). Still tragedy made worse national local leaders definitely doomsday event.  Oh again. worth effort. Lol america Congrats USA! look Arizona Ass country run ass people

Blood line god many 40 would get it?

Imagine president holding press conference wearing mask saying “I wear mask care fellow Americans. It’s patriotic thing do. care loved ones fellow Americans, you’ll wear one too.”

We'll deal sequelae generations, like polio. I'm liberal cock womble. actually believe science facts.

Outside transmission unusual. Child child transmission unheard of. kids article likely caught COVID adults day cares children. 

If child serious underlying health issue like diabetes, get it. Otherwise physical mental health concerns come play.

Sometimes it’s OK take break absolute non-stop firehouse shit-storm bad news actually pause moment wish someone nice day.

Regardless disapproval, continue wish people happy cake days. Personally, nice people comment special day.

I hope coming soon! I’m excited you! It’s much complicated situation simply “feeling unmotivated” know it. glad survival rate much higher death rate. know equals amount dementia yes Donny, certainly do. Propaganda made half country vote party purposely fucks 99%.

Every country capable stupid. stupidity nation biggest consequence. campus far announced 25% capacity rule fall, course 25 students would need room 100 seats. Obviously many big rooms around, part classes gone online-only departments wiggle room keep person courses. even think might end online anyway come August way things going right now. Knowing truth easy picking right news channel... stockmarket billions dollars pumped FED. Since 2008, even now, stockmarket much real economy. I'm working tirelessly Nextdoor.com shut falsehoods argue responsible use face masks. I'm far one community this, people women younger me.

Without strong governmental guidance one recourses have: convince neighbors behave responsibly. use good hygiene. complain incessantly poor manners, keep reminding poor manners better poor hygiene. Exactly , crazy people convinced masks go "" God's designed system breathing"". Yet problem getting plane boat. look public education bad far ""some worst"" look university level education best world U.S. universities dominating globally sort ranking. think I've ever ashamed American.

Probably stupid question it’s adding up, fuck? rate 200k cases per week. think it, treatment protocols changed much except perhaps addition steroids blood thinners. 

The reason death rate low young people getting infected. pass along senior family members time.

I'll admit couple weeks ago probably less 50% people grocery stores wore masks, ever since governor mandated masks I've seeing 90% people wearing them.  take large base already infected cases, number new cases ""highest record"" awhile unless rate infection significantly decreases.

The numbers monitoring % new cases/existing cases. Looks like still hovering around 3% ""stable"" countries. number greater this, example, Texas, Florida, Georgia, worried. Hey Vectors, Thoughts Prayers! new cases Dallas.. Good hear trumps tactic working out

Complete disingenous nonsense without attempt correlate growing number cases explosion testing (more tests=more cases, duh). would suggest actually effective way local town get people take seriously, everyone Texas idiot. made mandate, would legal battle hands, governor intervention, people protesting defying it, etc. Given state situation there, mayor town know would try mandate route either, try would effectively convince population take seriously. actually think doctor probably understands much death going around he's forgotten entire Forest built individual trees.

CONGRATS, BUDDY! :D US data masks? way related. Changing reporting US change data masks. I'm saying clinical trials they'll exposed put way, virus R0 1 pretty well harmless pandemic sense. never grow exponentially. Every infection average passes 1 person. virus R0 2 non-immune population, half population infected brings R0 back 1. secret good news daily deaths 10-20% April. Thats nobody talks deaths anymore suddenly cases metric choice media Headline incorrect, Rhode Island would 5. Yeah, need buy shit us sell back us money, lol...   Shit, going flee U.S. Mexico anyone know accuracy ""2020 Distribution"" ?


I could see able distributed conclusive tests take extremely long time . Plano tx day happy see everyone total wine mask whereas month ago barely any. could treated us like adults simply said “use makeshift fabric masks now, need save commercial ones medical workers. best supply chain sorted out.” masks people wear ( work fine ) ones medical people use anyway. agree terrible mistake. Arguing internet like competing Special Olympics ... even win, still retarded. photo. “Donald, poop laundry hamper?” remember reading every recession history initial dip, followed rally market, inevitable crash. 

I wonder seeing currently. somebody zero knowledge markets work, seems plausible, get things cruise without consequences. good solution. Schools supposed keep kids 6' apart. least HALVES number kids classroom. There's money extra employees. There's space. Hence rotating kids through. 

Most districts able trying focus face-to-face time space elementary, middle middle high school time remote. 

There's pulling rabbits hat thing. obvious / common sensical:

Wear masks - help. Wash hands / use sanitizer frequently.

Avoid crowds

Avoid prolonged indoor exposure especially combined speech... church sermon choral performance, rally conference, 1/2+ hour dinner indoors restaurant, night bar club, trip gym, using public transport entering spaces circulating air. 

Visit shop crowded. beer meal (if must) outside pavement, avoid churches places worship, wear mask especially indoors.... open windows.

These things would go long way reducing numbers time allowing minimal disruption economy.... personal freedoms. F Stay safe americans. Young people color? mean elect reality show buffoons highest offices land? God Bless America, Land Free



How fuck dare tell wear mask, social distance listen common sense!! People facebook reddit much smarter scientists/doctors around world. generations (including boomers) alive today never actually sacrifice anything, told something scale others. shit gibbon slinging feces mouths base side smell turned masks political issue drug addicted, McDonalds scarfing grifter communicates officially social media platform used mainly teens, reality TV star rapist, someone rejects science ""knows better"", running nation. see end virus years. real fucked part triage choose help idiots older people. base years left live intelligence, unfortunately.

USA!USA!USA #1 Hypothetically (oversimplified) 50% overall 30% effective 60s similar sized group potentially would 70% effective. protect people administering 50% demographic still reduce risk 60s cutting risk exposure. almost like Trump care Americans everything weaken America: Calling covid hoax, withdrawing WHO, refusing wear masks, saying need less testing, refusing implement national strategy, seizing medical supplies states, failing nationalize production PPE, trying slash Obamacare middle fucking pandemic, encouraging protests states open back up, withdrawing American troops Germany, allowing Russian bounties American soldiers go unpunished...

It's weird biggest supporters claim love America Patriots. Trump literally weakened America everything does. pictures BLM protesters wearing masks socially distancing, pictures BLM protesters *not* wearing masks *not* socially distancing, example simply say ""BLM protesters wore masks"" misleading, since implies **all** did. happen.

The first people vaccinated old people medical professionals, probably along government officials military.

The rest us wait months. worry folks this'll Easter. true. That's he's calm. someone lived Florida years currently lives NYC, heat never kept indoors. always pools beaches me. 

I'm staying indoors I'm bigot plan contributing problem. hypocrisy staggering businesses, colleges, Trump campaign claim safely reopen, insulating liability. think safe enough operate without restrictions, assume risk so. think there’s whole lotta people don’t understand fundamentals society must change. People still think little bandaids put allow us return “normal.”

Any school reopens wind closing again. Leftists would completely okay however. looooove big daddy government. Bullshit. China considered bad guy months now. side plenty people understand us purchasing much drug possible. Especially bad headlines made be. choosing see want. city refusing test unless severe symptoms, tests return negative.

One younger brothers exposed school event wont test all, despite kid immunocompromised family members. (I lupus high risk pregnancy) white college kids. expenses. Anytime one articles posted regarding young people spreading Covid...the top comment always ""it's young people, people "" 

No, no, people...a ton data coming huge demographic young pwople dont give shit anyone 100% accurate!!!!!! 

Even pandemic....young people sick time, smoking cigarettes, binge drinking go work, school partying sick...they dont give fuck anyone anything except fun. wasn’t designed was, society evolved serve purpose, especially elementary age school child care much education. 

And it’s free. Taxes pay education get it. dude guitar singing normal thoughts Also reporting Maine. new ""mandatory mask law"" I've told sentiment based things pretty much ""yea, right"" usually spell “dahn” emphasize “ah”

The deaths sadly go way August, especially regions like Houston, Inland Empire, etc exceed ICU capacity.

Hopefully new treatments keep death serious injury rates lower NYC peak. We’ll see. tried research in-flight air-handling systems, views map. HEPA filters, reported spaced every seats comforting, airline employees would chime saying in-flight air-quality joke. know believe.

With proper PPE, *think* would relatively safe short flight. However, confined space (far confined grocery store) gives pause. hope don’t like air tires paint car that.

Majority people understand bad situation is, ones don’t never will. aren’t brightest people generally. people refuse wear masks going change mind ""fake news"" CNN telling masks good idea. Wearing mask prevent spread virus seems like common sense lot people. people still refusing wear seem know common sense is. There's still community transmission, colleges going reopen fall Depends state live Congratulations! New High Score!

Oh wait....


C'mon Easter 2021!! supported initial lockdown still do. know virus reason lockdown again. infections median age 35 isn’t going lead surge deaths. 

I’ll check back ya weeks. live Butler County I've noticed well. 

Ever since things first got closed down, 99% people see go get groceries wearing masks like be, within past couple weeks things ""all better since we're green stage"" people stopped taking things seriously, including friends family (who continue show data scold whenever act recklessly).

Just today drivng lunch time saw quite people restaurants full parking lots walking together groups without wearing masks. I'm really excited dealing people selfish dumb asses around immunocompromised ass next time need get groceries. Ha Ha, thanks this. disagree. NY waayyy control early on. NY positive infection rate 40% couple weeks peak (and higher NYC, dense). 

The testing wasn’t good enough yet, NY also missing cases time. knows NY stats early-mid March, nobody aware yet, virus already spreading. read, Georgia around 10% positivity rate now, much lower NY peak. don’t think states near positivity rate NY peak, gives hope states able control it. believe saw Arizona one higher positivity rates recently, somewhere around 22-25%, still NY peak. I'll take word it, I'm CA, I'm going heard today governor. Hopefully go even ASAP. That’s insane. stupidity shows profit lives. quit? god. hopefully. past four years sent america toilet. see along lines “outlawing X doesn’t prevent X happening might well outlaw X” 

Like somehow something, even something small, worse nothing. It’s infuriating.  Well...I guess go away fall. Nothing see people. /s

It would nice everyone wore damn mask, covering mouth nose. amazing damage people willing inflict. Good point. Yes, probably isn’t nearly bad beginning. I’m anxiously awaiting next round results. believe getting another round blood samples New York include Philadelphia  awful. Can't stop coughing, can't breathe, sleep. work 10 days socialite

DAE hear ""white"" read word? Why? cases always seeing extra testing.

Deaths ICU utilization much better indicators confirmed cases. 🤣🤣🤣 non-mask wearing people, care others.

Exactly this. selfish. would go bad? Haha think shipped? Relax man fine dude even trying vaccine part? 94% chance dying heart attack outside hospital? can’t right. Native Houstonian here. idea anyone would risk lives go Galveston just....breathtaking. sucks there. Brown water, seaweed, flesh eating bacteria, pleasant ride oil refineries way. turn, mississippi...top that. Plot twist, one ones I’ve posing stuff announced he’s going one deleting Facebook account. Victory!! problem activities happen beach.

Of one family every mile aomething, thats problem.

But usually packed sidewalks, dirty restrooms, packed concession stands.

People simply arent paying slightest bit fucking attention. 4 ICU beds county county next door 5. idea ventilators. usually inject personal opinion videos.. think he's enough it.

I think have.  World's shittiest contest Remindme! 20 days Probably not. figured adequate PPE (which have) flight time hour, thought managed risk. flew SF TN connection Atlanta delta. researched airlines believe delta one reliably 60% capacity. paid like double go delta. indeed middle seats blocked. wore n95 cloth mask top. two weeks get sick. Atlanta airport frustrating bc lot people obeying mask rules, SFO better.

Edit: also drove couple hundred miles round trip go camping awhile ago get sick either. Driving probably safer bc easier keep distance. death rate 5%. taking number deaths dividing number confirmed cases get 5%. Right 500,000 10,000,000. However there's much significant number people actually covid 19 asymptomatic tested. CONFIRMED cases. number accurate enough tests whole population.

People severe symptoms likely go hospital get tested people likely die it. skews results.

The best estimate actual death rate 0.5%. mean I'm downplaying virus, still need take seriously strain healthcare long term effects survivors.

Also saying ""oh count exponential growth"". calculation contribute then? virus spreads exponentially contributed accurate model anything. Linear VS exponential growth absolutely massive difference. deaths dropping? no? Nah, that's vaccines. Remdesivir studied long COVID thing. talking case like one article hundreds people packed together regardless symptoms. I’m talking people like one comment specifically told guests ok didn’t come, mom’s coworker taking precautions decided give venue. Thank sharing, job great personal cost yourself, sure didn’t sign for. means, cost. much? money driving. personal space, control interact with, limits number people close proximity esp. compared flying, people even pee side road desired.  Jesus numbers everyone said fear mongering experts predicted March. It’s time stop nice people. Call shame oblivion. stupidity made traitors republic. There’s statistics back up. Stop ignoring empirical evidence. I’m sure there’s boat party Lake Travis weekend. good. love throwing around insults well don’t agree them. got called psychopath thread. Another person dm’d say wanted call idiot. called awful person piece shit also. 

These really unstable people. part afraid shadows. worst impulses come it’s really sad. Good sign yes, sometimes vaccines fail 3rd 4th phases. Cause optimism, absolutely, let’s celebrate yet. Meanwhile camel beach water park opened business completely ignoring mandate signed deals 2 new companies get additional vials produced well packaging components. fail vaccinate shortage vials, much promise you. Worst case scenario month two delays. Before. He’ll shuffle deck sinking ship times goes down. Actually facial hair kind mask increases gap 1% lessens efficacy least half. Usually it’s anything 1/4inch long unless cut slots beard mask seal.

-OSHA training studies proved infer travel right risk. 

I continually amazed people try justify normalcy bias this. american may think top world..but actually dumbass world. Exactly said 2023 least seem good testing. US empathize. 

Is way get treadmill? might best option kids YouTube challenges? Like lick ice cream eat tide pods? think people absolutely following health guidelines, get wrong. also think data like muddies water.

Attributing someone seeking treatment heart attack Covid death gives fuel people claiming virus hoax whatever. don’t understand question. I've heard countries Uber apps provided drivers masks, hand surface sanitizers, contributed partially purchase (usually acrylic) barriers. countries even specific ride category cars equipped texas ramping though. Austin downtown like empty. Honestly, first thought... next tried explain Ice, Ice Babby different sound Pressure entirely possible surge going happen without re-opening. !RemindME 3 days care freedom pandemic. Lock down. Wear mask. Save lives.  private family matter easy ban people, info, bunch drivers camera. sure would Definitely mass gatherings, people singing, shouting, pushed shoulder shoulder, spittle aerosolizing cheap, see-through masks...doing everything health experts said do. Yet health experts afraid stand it. ah see man culture well Trump wearing mask public, even embarrassingly late stage, would help. Hell, I'm apparently willing risk getting COVID regular paycheck since I've called back work would lose unemployment otherwise. ask seriously reconsider asking government use judiciary enforcement people cover faces public ? 

Like, way handling pandemic begging government control population ? mean like governments haven’t proven time time incredibly corrupt much love abusing power Give month. time last month thought past it. Things get much worse. need stop you’re look stupid this. Go watch John Oliver’s clip showing idiots shouting nonsense virus first came here... “it’s killed 9 people get it” time Easter. Stay vacation rental (free standing home) must travel. never go near hotel thing over. assume that? tell tested positive need keep distance Lee health reports hospitalizations it’s one largest hospital systems FL. There’s approximately 800K people live lee county current hospitalizations right 245. Trump call stupid proclaim Wendys world's best burger, really are, best people, knows Dave Thomas personally great guy. Soon we'll casualties people suffering ailments hospitals full There’s usually 2 week lag time. Come back two weeks promise increase. likely helped , don’t think 100% say prevented catching it. 

Hope sister well. simple answer: long incubation period, without debilitating symptoms.  Meaning infected, know it, bother you, spreading infection people, unknowingly. spend weeks spreading infection people ""I feel good"" suddenly dead. people same. Within weeks, post apocalyptic movies real, except there's nobody left watch movie.

Evolution fickle mistress. Well.. either they've killed big part residents nursing homes, virus problems reaching vulnerable. always go back blame China. America, land pandemic becomes political stance perfect  well, he's sort stupid. unrest places Europe, people eventually listened scientists advising governments. EU currently small fraction total new cases compared US. also US residents can't enter EU currently.  Umm ok Jesus exist, soon, neither people.  GREAT RESPONSE study percentage excess death within months lockdowns likely fear stress virus (Avoiding hospitals suicides). one point simply worth it? Yeah. Mandating masks seems real solution here. Poor guys. :( Always rough role 700lb. Terminator cut short pesky civilians want die. god, dozens kids die become disabled How’s deaths? want know populace Texas increasing states reacting. shock people finally starting pay attention, doubling covid denial? therefore also important flatten curve. 
 
Unlike others, scientists doctors learn disease every day. starts use ventilators, put patients down, medications already available work, etc.

This knowledge turn COVID19 harmless cold, save people would died 4 months ago. Imagine far listen media government. 

Would like immigrate. US sure seems like shithole country. happens rarely it’s top story CNN! likely trend hospitals reach actual capacity, it? Problem state mild.  

This sort thing isn’t forgivAble especially believe ways spreads damage it’s done confidence.  

He lied.  Plain simple. professions lying patients potential patients doctor one unforgivable things possible. different everybody. Facebook learns engaged stories reaffirm biases? Well prepared shown that! really regret born country Robbing bank infringes other's liberty. Everything said fallacious contains real argument. burden proof justify infringing liberties. Don’t forget NHL one word. believe nightmare market sounds like massive fire hazard. sure believe anything anything prevent another outbreak basically meat processing plant. You’re wrong many levels.
First all... Trump CAN’T read know that. restaurant plenty die hard trump types year ago way now. still probably 1/5 was. Yeah, lied pretty bad one. I'm Chinese. born Beijing lived 35 years. think know better whether believe not. Deaths skyrocket health systems overwhelmed. haven’t seen since New York, we’re half dozen cities overwhelmed, areas climbing. know treat virus better now, that’s definite reduction deaths , moment virus hitting mostly young folks. diffuse community spread, though, likely hit vulnerable communities increase number deaths.

Also, death isn’t issue here. cases have, people damage lungs, hearts, pancreases. literally don’t know long term affects level infection are. come back haunt like chicken pox shingles? hiding damage like measles? affect childhood development, reproductive health, etc? chance could raise instances lung cancer way HPV raises chances cervical cancer? above? None it?

It’s important reiterate little know infections equal potentially disabled chronically ill people later line. say, wear masks, we’re literally rolling dice letting ride. Hold beer \~ 'Murica Insects good source protein. Yeah Karen sees n95 masks decides it. April people more... Cool covid, least live says people armed? /\\cvi\*\\|vim moment confused workd becoming federation overnight. Fuck. 

-signed...a teacher Pittsburgh people much blue collar mentality. worst pandemic anyone alive today ever experienced. 

No not. Smallpox caused 300-500M deaths 20th century alone. 1967 2M people died it.

Covid-19 killer, Hannibal Lector infectious diseases. 6000 new cases one day ""barely curving upwards again"" Maybe like car air filters effective gets little dirty. 20% came China's data. think lying - numbers - problem using official numbers NY least whole heaping amount people died home.  


Many people would hospitalized otherwise - NY hospitals even said turning people away hospitalized ran space taking worst worst.  


So think calculating hospitalizations little complicated deal massive outbreak overwhelms system - I'm discounting anything Dutch saying - numbers true them. likely adult child transmission child child. exit **vim** without sa**vim**ng comment?

^^This ^^was ^^posted ^^by ^^a ^^bot. See, failure state level where, if, Trump given message earlier R governors would echoed message degree. last thing want appear *gasp* liberal subject Trump. stay quiet. *leading* wear mask message allows governors follow suit. s/vi/vim/ Yes people less likely die (Younger, less pre-existing conditions) still, spread it.

Assuming they're healthy. One biggest causes COVID going south overweight ~80-90% nation overweight. good 40-45% *obese*.

There multitude factors even young people severely complicate COVID. happened anyways. purposely spread misinformation masks beginning people go buy since supply woefully inadequate. I’m gunna keep recommending therapy here. government moral authority erode liberty compared thief's, murderers, enslavers? Iceland Ireland sustained anarchy. may distinction without difference, believe Lieutenant Governor. 

You know, douche canoe said old people willing die economy. whatever.  USA! USA! USA!

/s... please save me. experience it? Football perfect spreading ground COVID-19...it play NFL year I’m willing bet it’ll along lines expecting 30-50% players getting much like what’s forecasted college football. seem like type that’ll say “but players fine, they’re healthy low risk bracket” something along lines. coaches? many older, morbidly obese coaches league? One gets dies think players shake keep playing like nothing happened? 

Highly, highly doubt we’re getting full NFL season year...sorry man. wouldn’t surprised entire season cancelled way things currently going moment. I'll use comment remind everyone:

Please, sake lives, understand reacting way climate change, except climate change world-ending threat, ""normal"" 100-year pandemic.

Not coincidentally, cowards whose inactions led current situation ones leading charge lying climate change. people pushing narrative wanna make money, get economy running again. Source? dry cold exact reason virus turning every meat factory petri dish.

Oh, wait... figure out? virus brain information processing capacity? Forgive dumb , possible please suggest resources books know viruses work. ಠ_ಠ huh kinda sad China culls animals situations, much choice want prevent outbreaks? many legs. weirdest boomer crowd sneer wearing one. Like bro I’m you, me. never wear mask grocery stores anywhere else. read, aware propaganda people feel endangering others wearing mask. don’t believe it, don’t wear mask. It’s simple. 

I’m writing start argument, FULLY aware think I’m science-denying, willfully ignorant, uncaring piece shit wearing mask. fine that. wrote comment simply give non-mask wearer’s perspective.

The Science Conclusive: Masks Respirators Prevent Transmission Viruses

Dr. Denis G Rancourt, PhD


Comment: following review scientific literature wearing surgical facemasks means preventing transmission SARS-CoV-2 thus preventing contraction 'Covid-19' published month ago. absent miraculous suspension decades hard science transmission viruses, settled... 


face mask
Abstract 

Masks respirators work. extensive randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies, meta-analysis reviews RCT studies, show masks respirators work prevent respiratory influenza-like illnesses, respiratory illnesses believed transmitted droplets aerosol particles. 

Furthermore, relevant known physics biology, review, masks respirators work. would paradox masks respirators worked, given know viral respiratory diseases: main transmission path long-residence-time aerosol particles (&lt; 2.5 μm), fine blocked, minimum-infective-dose smaller one aerosol particle. 

The present paper masks illustrates degree governments, mainstream media, institutional propagandists decide operate science vacuum, select incomplete science serves interests. recklessness also certainly case current global lockdown 1 billion people, unprecedented experiment medical political history. people part human race. They're virus stupidity contained CA secret anymore charge extra written side container. they're limited # tests Something Muslims swear, fucking country deal people.

No don't. voted Brexit ""project fear"" ""we've head enough experts telling us best"" getting sick abroad sent home it, returning home healthy getting sick? basically like considering decimation (the roman military punishment, considered cruel) scale whole nation.  


P.S. slightly less disturbing note, happy cake day! good allowed immigratiion country, brought stupid people country eroded purity American intellektuolisum. name checks Freedom contact tracing. Lol fucking usa so...then excuse countries contact trace?

good job.

it's guy's fault!!! NHL actually coming North! Toronto Edmonton hub cities moment us Canada seeing declining cases across board sure old people worried, 17% fatality rate fucking huge. grandparents nearing 80 went mini-vacation new york last week probably spending fall/winter south florida every year one places virus worst.  evidence vast improvement treatment haven’t seen any. keep seeing virus surprising still don’t understand treating well. COVID killed people U.S. 12 month period making leading cause death

Wait, think heart disease leading cause death 611,000 per year. Cancer close second 584,000.

It interesting see Coronavirus kill many, time tell. thing is, means 100% 382 million people get infected kills 0.15% people infects. think (not sure) bit top current estimates expect. 

Herd immunity start effect 65% infected rate lower (imagine virus surviving better wearing mask social distancing!!), current IFR (infected fatality rate) around 0.26% even lower based recent info.

Anyway, either won’t leading cause death 2020. find out. 40% seems *extremely* generous. Unfortunately, yes. little doubt unless serious number fudging comes play. states getting hit hardest done little actually curb outside lip service, exponential growth doesn’t fuck around.

If 75k one day isn’t next week it’ll week after.  Except almost half deaths New York. NY hot spots got things control deaths dropped massively. rest country maintained lockdown exploding. Death spikes follow (although hospitals better treating mortality rates lower.) deaths? Cases irrelevant. Young people die thing. Friend (39) sheltering place Shelter Island, NY. - 1.5 months. 4 days ago went NYC (drove herself) dentist. wore N95masks. Back shelter island after. 3 days later - took CV test (dad doctor). Tested positive - symptoms today. Isolating watch dad.  People still playing this? Nono.. still it, counted. Everyone knows caronavirus wants people hate trump, noone hates trump. thats beat rona virus. mean, follow logic. /r/inclusiveor wrong, probably halfway decent grammar start condescending. Grocery store food cheaper time. Unfortunately. self isolate wear masks come winter it’ll absolutely nothing people won’t able comprehend isolation masks contributed this. Wow bodies virus wahhh??? Happy Cake Day! case believing anything ccp says. would stupid, would believing governments whole heartedly. what's happening coronavirus China seems quite believable us live here. think problems bigger ""Thoughts Prayers.""

~My fellow servers. *help* WEEEEEEE! Actually looking week week percent increases, cases leveled started increasing last three weeks. Prior lowering % increases typically matched similar change deaths weeks later.

Fuck tribalism. YOCO - Covid-19 curiosity, food changed 10 years? you’re happy risk flying aeroplane, every additional flight you’re doubling you’re risk keep seeing ""it's young peoples' fault"" narrative pushed. live IL pretty much seems like vast majority (80 90%)of young people wearing masks. I'd say 40% older population wearing masks. Granted really see many people outside work grocery store. Maybe I'm wrong. (US dramatically ramping syringe production, instance)

Where find info like this? tried find numbers medical gear manufacturing US, cant find anything feels like US literally nothing times. *sigh* gets worse every single day. point I'm almost afraid checking stats gives anxiety. people refuse wear mask, even stay home situation, refuse anything help stop shit destroying us need wake fuck up. want know, government started asking, ordering you, asking you, asking nicely wear mask public settings stay home. oblige request. all. government made mandate wear mask, stay home continue work home. yet people still cry complain. 

Keep mind, military, active duty military personnel follow orders dropped upon keep country safe. follow orders best ability know, KNOW back home willing government requests keep country safe.

Local governments asking, requesting mandating wear mask public places protect others around you.  people cannot stay home wear mask?? simple task asked government? fuck? company that's essential service, I'd love stay home kids everyday. can't. community needs do. 

To say can't wear mask protect community military members recieve orders put lives line shit head, nothing show insane, self absorbed, selfish, incredible piece shit. 

Look, like wearing mask anyone else. can't stand it. job do, job asked begin wear mask public spaces, wear mask. wear driving car, wear filling car pump, wear going evening walk. public spaces. I.e. inside gas station, grocery store, post office, etc;. kinds places people rather close you. 

For real, long take run store, grab need, pay leave? 10 mins tops spend grocery store know need dont dilly dally fuck around like wearing mask. quicker get out, take mask off, better. 

Do local government asking, wear mask. like either, save lives life Included, I'll wear god damn thing. restaurant full capacity simultaneously allow social distancing? what's S? One taco's worth real? 2k day? I'm impressed NY follows this. Brilliant thing cases spiked x weeks ago, can't keep saying deaths going spike x number keep saying things ignore anyone answers why.

It’s WHO’s fault happened, sorry burst bubble. minimum wage workers arbitrators law store policy. Smh. They’ve never seen anything like it! way vaccine.
We able slow spred lockdown. much drama people worrying poor people going hungry, people never fed single poor person yet much worried going hungry.
This selfishness hypocrisy going kill us end. thought Dijon mustard spicy mustard? We’re likely thinking thing, Obama ordered burger restaurant asking ketchup mustard it, particularly spicy/Dijon/brown (I don’t remember exactly one was) instead Fox News goddamn meltdown OK. Thats gonna go well westside lol one scariest things virus.. hypothetically 10 different people could get show different symptoms different timelines developing symptoms. I've currently got virus first couple days dull headache dry nose. Today I'm horrible sore muscles symptoms continuing progress. advice would speak doctor possible become reassured regarding common signs look for. many clinics set online take insurance may able speak healthcare professional concerns without going out. stays much possible wears mask/gloves going public okay! cant get without contact virus first place.  weird question. quit smoking 5 months back, consequence, become prone new allergies lately. mildly allergic dampness, dust, pollen, meaning pretty much everything air keep sneezing every fucking thing. guessing lungs become hyper-sensitive bit healing now. I've read reports happens often. take anti allergens supress hyper sensitivity might come advantage exposed coronavirus? relation hypothesis pure bullshittery. Maga /s technically murder willingly wearing mask?

If know infected, 100% be. Afaik, case STDs, no? Keep mind death rate heavily MAY, openly corrupt states like Florida Texas leading much infections. Drawing conclusions American data reliable getting conclusions Chinese data point. 2 months True. They’re largely ones got laid everything shutdown March save old folks. 24% changed testing **only** symptomatic cases. makes big difference positive rate. happen every day person classes ""Harrassment time Corona "" approached american company w/ means mass produce mask given investment rebuild machine declined it. 

They option recommend cloth masks public FIRST request save N95 front line.

They option trusting American people. 

They chose act like scum &amp; outright fuck us instead lying, cheating &amp; stealing way killing 100 thousand people 3 months. ""at point going disappear, hope.""

Yeah, US reach herd immunity virus run possible hosts. take long ass time millions die guess GOP willing pay price. It’s already beginning half Clemson football team infected it’s matter time rest students staff catch There's two week delay. places like New York round two huge surge, got control, lot people wearing masks 

Other places still one stage growing cases slight plateau semi lockdown Yeah, understand Texas all. 50% restaurants hospitals Houston raising alarms ablut capacity sounds extremely half assed. associate stupid people, lowers fitness. So, natural selection still works. Remember roe v wade challenged someone going ensure family get sick keep family home? Thus far, one shown front door forced way rub coronavirus over. There's fked there's 🇺🇸. That’s Japan too. government “suggested” us wear masks. did. thus pandemic controlled, July everything back 100% we’re still wearing masks. Surely makes sense stay US send money back.. There's enough people is! even better that. NYC, least, last time got butthurt went ""on strike"", sort of, said ""we make absolutely necessary arrests"". jaw-dropping tone-deafness.

Anyways, followed through, people much happier, crime spike, embarrassed NYPD much quietly backed slowdown.

TLDR: cops honestly think people respect them, despite evidence.  pray happens! It’s real everyone cousin fucker. mean don’t think Tua Tagoviloa banging cousin Alabama protests didn’t contribute spread

Protest definitely contributed spread. know they're outside, thousands people packed together yelling screaming gonna cause cases. I've seen tv protesters wearing mask, lot all. also saw protesters pull mask yell stuff large groups. Memorial day, protests, bars, dine restaurants, young old people contributed increase cases. weird question. quit smoking 5 months back, consequence, become prone new allergies lately. mildly allergic dampness, dust, pollen, meaning pretty much everything air. guessing lungs become sensitive healing now. I've read reports happens often. take anti allergens supress hyper sensitivity might come advantage exposed coronavirus? relation hypothesis pure bullshittery. [It’ll miraculously go Ya mess VPOL! kids

Nope, story checks  university Alabama real know problem school known football academics Oh geeze. really don’t understand this. you. Knowing infected nothing mean nothing regards prognosis. Zero. doesn’t change outcome. it’s necessary. health data remain private. many reasons. Covid. 

What knowing create anything anger retribution. Imagine angry might get knowing infected them. possibly see this? (The irony look exactly way, someone infecting them, rather taking responsibility safety getting infected first place.)

Again, benefit knowing curiosity nothing else. telling covid19 test kits bought instagram advertisement inaccurate? Say ain't so. still fuckloads fucktards reckon media fluff, hoax, government lie, conspiracy, way vax anti-vaxxers, lead-up chip skin, associated mass stupidity. bet parents families half million dead worldwide would little upset hearing fluff killed loved ones. Yes, they're COVID, can't properly assess impact virus itself.  Yeah, they're also sad face consequences killing people. 

Hell, delivered pizzas years, dangerous job cop. still even butthurt. mean Dijon mustard thinking something else? didn’t go Alabama play school figured start saw first 2 headlines CNN start outbreak.

Headline 1 
""Doctors dying masks protect contracting corona virus""

Headline 2
""Masks protect people contracting corona virus""

This news exactly shocking Sooo. you’re saying use less tests. Less positive COVID? Okay. know masks physical distancing countries achieve results without masks? Doesn’t take much brainpower see masks basically useless.

Also doesn’t take much brainpower properly read said. FORCED mask wearing human rights violation. moment went rights you. dumbass allow government force wear piece cloth front face basically proven unnecessary, idiot. Redhat Boomers best way describe morons ruining country many things part world described future history books. future history oxymoron? Yeah, basically warning keep pushing New Coke selling well old coke (I know Coke story complicated that, got presented class me). wrong us? legit embarrassing American. lucky deadly. zombie apocalypse happens America fucked. can't needs done. Yeah human rights granted slave owners way important facts remember thinking would've blown end summer back March. 

Now we're back square one. lol fell meme again.

Someone honours time post called ""warning"" Taiwan. I'm getting tired dig text again. don’t know you’re talking about. live TN, it’s still called “fear mongering” here, along others words like “sheep,” “I know rights [in regards Nashville’s mask ordinance],” bunch people defending participation trophy statues.

Don’t come back us. It’s late. Theres options could avert complete meltdown, short drastic intervention US heading difficult times.

The US treasury could massively inflate currency give American significant continual subsidy maybe somewhere around $5k month. US unique position USD world reserve currency. Much value dollar due demand outside US borders, inflating currency wont inflate prices quite dramatically countries. 

This ensures regular people pay rent, debt, necessities. landlords means continue get paid inflation likely cause price real estate balloon. WallSt assets kinds. Everybody wins except foreign holders US currency. could cause countries dump USD would cause massive inflation, every country massively inflating right arent lot safe havens countries run to. really perfect opportunity expansionary monetary policy. neighbors rushed play dates 4-5 year olds right state reopened. 6 kids running around backyard parents standing “3-6 feet far apart” without masks. hard watch. states surging states supported him. probably realized could counterproductive encourage supporters die. Germany, too. Daily protests mask-enemies weird fucking conspiracy theories, leader vegan cookbook-author recently started threatening journalists physical harm 🤷‍♀️ Hey that’s birthday mean worried COVID CCP falling right? haha according china, never fault blame anything, mao god. baby numbers.

If 89% humans end getting it, that's 109,200,000 deaths infection mortality rate 1.4%. ...giving mixed signals constantly. least that's looks like Europe.

Looks like US too. 2 birds 6.35kg? coronavirus works basically going rank countries stupid. Nobody guess much, daily chart refer to. Nobody wants admit protests played role. goes narrative. think even people like eat meat (like me) would this.

- come vegan_crossfit_super_a**hole pitching idea - 

Look quality get now. watery tasteless lumbs dead animal, yes, hygenic cheap, thats it.

Most people drown everything salt, pepper, condiments anyway give back taste..but need flavorless mass pour ketchup upon, well could indeed use tofu.

In germany ( pretty sure everywhere) cheap meat injected water (the companies claim taste) cooking loses 1/3 size/volume.

This useless water sold customer, transported plant store customers home, cooled storage (4.81 kJ/kg*K), evaporated cooking (2300 kJ/kg)

So move 10 Tons meat plant, moving 3 tons ""injected water"", costs fuel.
Than cool (lets say 15 6 °C, customers evaporate 3 Tons useless water.
If cooling machine means heating meat working efficiency 100% would cost 2000 kWh - typical amount electrical energy consumed average PER YEAR person.


I think water injection banned.
I think transportation animals slaugtherhouses limited, transportation 
frozen/cooled meat.

Get quality up, make sure workers meatplants paid right, make better livestock.

Eating watery tasteless garbage 'it legally named meat' way go. CHINESE TRAVELER, BTW predicting fall USA? Jk one model predicting less 1.5-2.4 million dead americans. That's one White House used. based proper mask usage, social distancing, rolling lockdowns. #USA! USA! USA! friends don’t care numbers. think immune anyone dies it’s 30 years bad decisions led death. It’s fault. better less medicinal issues going pandemic, idiots. Oh liberty... lawl. outside fine I've read here. It’s like World War 2, got multiple fronts, what’s important willing sacrifice good country. keep staying home, keep pushing work home, social distancing, wearing masks, hanging friends. sucks it. Right US quarter world’s Coronavirus cases. also finding number deaths far much higher initially realized due misdiagnosis. losing war right now. Badly. become complacent. works POTUS. Stop think far buck boss public. factor million. That's called lying -- that's called avoiding ground fine powder personally professionally. dump trucks full venture capital money. intentionally keep prices low operate loss try drive competition business. I'm f*cks give.  
 
Whenever read stuff like Trump overwhelming feeling resignation, now. f*ckrs keeping seated function get mad about. American thing. run Brexit vote, Daily Mail Express dismissing economics experts papers damage Brexit could British economy ""Project Fear"".

Apparently easier dismiss anything calling fearmongering provide real refutation. many times people gonna say this? see posted every week. course 2nd wave! ffs. username date? something special happen day Imagine stupid enough actually believe garbage LOL, no. Elon joke. Goats ok though Yep, working two different recruitment agencies hopefully get first programming job. pulled within hours. So? 7 months January clear months Covid spread people people. country contact tracing excuse. Sweden here. maybe 1-5% ppl wearubg masks many developed already part risk production? ideas
thanks virus around 6 months. Could please show studies, articles, long term damage? Trump understands. That’s wants fewer tests. Exactly. Lol ""no excuse."" hate guy. Shanghai considered wide margin highest standard pandemic prevention effort, due good governance extra cautious nature Shanghainese. Shanghai place mainland China home quarantine still permitted.

Still, besides Beijing there's also outbreaks Harbin, Shulan, Jilin, Wuhan more, successfully put down. COVFEFE-19 got us messed up.

COVFEFE-19 Trump's shitty administration. [Just wear structural problem education system first foremost. taken decades electorate get dumb enough get us mess. might late, reached critical mass stupidity. Ten bucks says person wearing shirt spends least third day using Microsoft Windows *This*. Got realization EU last year. 

We wondered go pizzeria take eat home, 1) Pizza costed less take 2) take pizza eat half, could take one pizza 

At first thought ""ridiculous, restaurant is..."" well... 
Cons : 
- appetizers 
Pros : 
- fancy wine bottle table nobody us wants 
- weird looks waiter asking sodes instead alcohol 
- loud noices 
- We're time together alone 
- watch TV, read book whatever instead forced either speak read phones waiting pizza ready 

We're way better ""experience"" take reduced pizza budget three. Antibodies would disprove first wave. Please stop listening media go straight science. please tip cash Venmo! Sincerely, neighborhood bartender Work restaurant AZ people driving nearby states experience normalcy I'm guessing. Back January/February prediction America would one worst hit places. countries sole reason exist money, happens. look anything relating China animals bad time. animal cruelty charts. stupid

FTFY dang. 50% aint good Nostalgia? Nope. Doubling times UK covid-19 epidemic typically 2 - 3 days restrictions introduced.

So cases per day double within week US, seeing many people care. Nearly half Indian homes toilet, know Covid spread feces. Combined Indias insane population density virus really easy Yes say that. that's reported. :( miss it, entire team missed 🤦‍♂️

Maybe, could screaming cavalry riding save election chances, might still focused day's stock market numbers. honestly way knowing.

Admittedly, know surrounds self-interested yes men, there's every chance miss it: he's known taking whatever good advice offered, either. [Me remembering every time told manager customer.  Running Florida too. Lots drive testing centers closing 30 min opening day they're capacity. guess would rely entirely upon recipient phrase “I wanna sex up” responds. Agree first part comment respective responses pandemic. China force lockdown, lots chinese would going well. better worse, Americans prioritize individual freedom everything else. leaders poor job getting everyone behave...but I'm still taking vaccine China tested trusted non Chinese authority.  I'm racist. trust CCP. honest, find masks effect breathing. often find coughing half hour mask.

That said, reason Covid-19 damaged lungs ruined breathing. yea, suck wear mask. breathing bit impaired mask way better dealing damage actual virus cause. ask driver put mask yesterday stop blasting ac windows closed. Well, exactly war coronavirus. war anyone, incompetent leadership let become major disaster mismanaging politicizing response. One nice (?) consequence BLM protests Russian troll farms unpaid American interns moved another subject.

It's really obvious leave go... Local city subs getting swarmed right-wing bullshit. Great, another idiot thinks funny US overwhelmed virus. sunk. :-( Thank you. symptoms started chemotherapy treatment doctor said side effects. got sick quarantined treated. still going ended infecting hairdresser too. ok thankfully. 2 1/2 weeks back normal. occurred originally due lack PPE. meeting established masks would preferable, but, risky advise general public supply issue could fixed healthcare workers.

That failure starts ends Trump. trashed pandemic response task force, created shortage agreed mask advice response.

Fault resolutely laid feet, mouth, without caveats. yet everyday drive hurricane harbor it’s packed full. Literally one parking space open it’s full can’t help think reasoning lied people told wouldn’t feel bad going water park. think 1,200 China heart attack worthy, sense scale wayyyyy off. extremely concerning. emerging evidence even asymptomatic people getting organ damage virus. Apparently people crazy low oxygen levels even know (silent happy hypoxia) cause damage. Children seem suffer symptoms adults (usually) finding much virus. shudder think kids getting showing outward signs brains starved oxygen. you’re saying CDCs estimate wrong? like seemingly enforced, bad kind limited strict enough. Seat belts required permanently, masks ok required temporarily. Nah vector, case New Zealand would worse us. Clearly solution reduce testing confirm cases reaches 0. better yet, send people state testing bloat states stats.

We could also beat global warming outlawing thermometers. Help us get orange toddler might get somewhere lol rogue employees company. case Tesla, chairman Musk entire company Unfortunately saw video Liveleak asking people wear airsoft masks holes show isn’t protecting health government make people comply like sheep. I’ll find video bit. It’s sad. Agree, saw one day 16(?) year old kid “healthy”. Appeared like 150lbs overweight... I’m fat shaming, can’t call “healthy” Fauci seems American knows what's up. comes across Americans either sick can't arsed listen anymore, anyway looking likely prediction 100k cases day far off. Fauci must feel like pointless human America. Where'd rather listen conspiracy theory, reposted Facebook scientist. world's fucked. kidding! Kia Ora :) That's basically way learned ""FBLA"" whatever class called ~30 years ago (Fuck getting old). market wants doodads sell doodads ...

(I think FBLA name ""group"" came class - class name something along Management - cant recall it) IFR still unknown indefinitely. way say IFR 0.6% certainty. best it’s guess. CFR less guess it’s still bad. 

Deaths result COVID positive tests metrics worth looking laypeople. heard Hugo’s closing permanently Wtf read.

We strongly suggest required wear mask business? Xd deaths? 6 digit daily cases come! people say virus small go masks, forgetting single virus doesnt travel own, suspended tiny droplets enormous compared virus, alot caught issue. also problem many people tend forget lot COVID still unknown. Meaning long term impacts body. Many disease like one, damaging impacts aren’t visible months afterwards. 
America needs slow infection rate becomes impossible stop. first wave second wave around corner. medical teams suffer. 
Stay safe ! get around charging leave country? Charge leave, since know need come back.

(Although, typing this, certainly see authoritarian sounds hurdle leaving well) country singers going write songs commemorate coronavirus? Hello Im robot come future, 125k 60 days.


This shit depressing Alternative take: second wave, like people think. people say ""Second Wave"" almost always comparing CV Spanish Flu. But, second wave SF caused people thinking over. Spanish Flu mutated Summer 1918, second wave came, that's bad. 

The virus spread across Europe, New York, rest US, mutated strain original started China, hit East Coast US. So, kind Second Wave. we're using 1/3 ICU beds nationally middle april, according reality, appears hospital usage correlates closely morbidity, way way down. Nobody sub respond this. kills ""world ending covid"" buzz. parts S. Africa like ridiculously poor. live poor hygentic conditions, resources even consider lock down, shitty situation overall them. 18 Jun 20: [Trump states people wearing masks express disapproval Better open borders. agree, therefore US maintain rioting status covid gone, true, would literal best path action

- fastest slow spread would be, long term, least damage economy health overall population, economy able go back full force earlier
- fight oppression racism
- big chains get avoid taxes, banks abuse power struck most

all once! incredible, all, oddly convenient.

if really true, truly believe notion -- actively pushing outcome know gonna save lives evil, least actively wanting best society.

but know partizan bullshit merely pathetic damage control people let silently disperse cycle that's shit deserves. Risk? Oh wrong game... Maybe  I’ve saying since day 1, always get shouted sub. It’s common fucking sense. Previous mask order never lifted. least SE PA... didn’t require outside before,‘that’s all. inside spaces. it’s outside spaces also. Checkmate Yes friend. safe. Back last week February, worker Korean supermarket telling glad instead back home rising infection number proximity China.

Lol, gone home. warned. chose ignore. everyone went ice cream holiday. Already happening. least one major Houston hospital run Remdesivir, absolute max capacity rapidly filling up. They’re desperately trying bring nurses in, knows much they’ll actually prepared pay? That's strong tin foil hat energy got friend. fly, fly, fly away still. could shut airspace less 8 hours, 9/11. fuck tell airlines stop packing in? Boeing still wants make jumbo airli ers spite ""Trump Pump"" markets. it, buy next cure(remdesivir) whole world. Gilead=Trump. dissolving responsibility. 21. need anyone else set example grown adult people talking about. per average 5-6 days, take longer upto 14 days. plague Europe, disappeared without vaccine costed 1/3 population Even plague doctors 17th century sense put something face patient.

These people trying 'fight' masks special kind stupid. F Deaths stagnant, AZ, TX, FL.

Just factual. That’s it.

You continue misrepresent facts, exercise extremely poor math reasoning skills. eating popcorn. country fared well (thus far), currently almost normal, waiting economic consequences fear. Like not, American economy huge impact world's economy, suffer, suffer. Yeah that's fair assessment.  Bahahahaha - fuck me.

Honestly dysfunctional version democracy world.

You ashamed become. thoughts whole mess nutshell? thought sure India would perfect place explode, sure seems relatively fine right now. Suspiciously fine. Like, either lie, there's really neat reason fine. thing predictions pretty spot on. That's exactly felt started February. that's felt right started happening hands. fatigue thing thing took notice I'm type person gets 4am goes bed 9pm nap, ever. nap. come nobody wants blame protests? I'm people excersing right protest factor spike, right? Crowds thousands people several wearing masks could reason many new cases? Everyone blames reopenings like people think virus took days let protest. Watching one lady Florida screaming government trying interfere ""God's wonderful breathing system"" bizarre. Real headline: 5 months SARS-CoV2 hits Western ""superpower"" still can't muster production even lightweight KN95 style masks population, still resents China buying N95 masks, telling public cloth masks okay PPE they're not. Wealthy white Blame Chyna locking US down. Yeah going sad shit show. People care need lock home isolate immediately Refreshing change tides, huh? thought 1-20 4-10 common symptoms. Stick fucking anime pillow. Leave important stuff without penchant fantasizing cartoons. India almost certainly reported due lack tests per capita.

However India also put place much harsher lockdown measures USA. Namely restriction movement around country. USA hasn't, would strongly resist. wait - hospitals running Remdesivir. Death rate going spike significantly, particularly hospitals hit max capacity. won’t 50-50, absolute horror show.  Strewth! He'll anything attention even bother testing anymore? Every American going get rate. Many millions die. femoid EU better response pandemic, lower transmission numbers now. France, required wear mask stores first reopened, now, number people wearing declined, though places still require them. see, that's best thing tourists. come, spend money, go home get sick! problem *their* state. Win/win! ^(/s) Treatments better now. Patients live 1 3 months intubated woth adequate health resources. deaths start spiking resources become strained, ventilators, staff, medicine treat patients. hospital went 20 something cases may 50+ now. vote November. people know support made part identity they'll never waver. Look history. He's disingenious redhat trolling sub. Pure trash. USA PLZ tests mean positive cases time. Take NYC instance. [As many 6 10 Americans one chronic health condition, many 4 10 two deaths US also [notably skewed towards younger victims compared European disease’s ability overwhelm hospitals already inaccessible nature healthcare US lot going die, pensioners already dearth’s door. know Americans say want throttle them. can't keep herd immunity without vaccine, every child born depresses immune number, US 11K births day.

Also, *getting* herd immunity would kill 4 million people. capitalism South Africa You’d think shit show jersey New York (their neighbors) they’d already implemented mask wearing long ago. stupid people country, America great?  remember 2 month ago sub people saying italy overreacting. Fast forward, Italy less active cases US make one single day. 
This I'm angry people say politic important. ""It's going magically disappear April"" \~Trump

It's July actually increasing. Magically Disappear ass. Yeah seems like right answer here. Fauci lied, option tell whole truth get sacked idiot manbaby it, makes sense hedge mask advice bit Demographics?

Here Seattle, we’ve biggest protests country, sustained protests. seen much rise Covid cases, significant testing capacity. Given we’ve also loosened restrictions, it’s hard say protests impact all. Washington’s spike coming central WA, protests.  Sorry, rolled 7, stole shit • scalable. 
• One person donate two others. 
• Extremely limited supply. 
• organized triage distribution. COVID related death numbers like?

The problem cases totally depends testing frequency, we've seen manipulated ... Thanks replying, long take mild cough goes away? Why, think evangelical ducks carpentry? 3rd world countries also better 2 biggest risk factors obesity age, almost exclusively 1st world countries. Haha.  Yeah got scammed. Luckily, got mine Craigslist guy scrubs know mine legit. Yes, read story subreddit month ago, said caught symptoms next day going bar, well virus takes atleast 4-10 show type symptoms, people called idiot month ago, trying act innocent blaming others bar. video

 Repost? family members health care workers living one newly heavily affected states, aren’t wearing masks either. fact, thought they’d go ahead big party week! 

For reference, least two people work specifically COVID19 units now. brought concerns, answer was, “I already work COVID, doesn’t matter, I’m already risk”. Apparently never occurred could spreading virus EVERYONE ELSE. answer selfish, like couldn’t wrap head around importance protecting others since they’re higher risk. 

Talk embarrassing/absurd. I’m glad hear every health care worker dense. Holy hell looked hit rate. back 6.7%, 4.5% two weeks ago.

That's good. saw deaths related pneumonia around 186,000, probably well past 125,000. trying reduce numbers look bad. Vanilla ICY Color Dead.

FTFY. New York here. still “mandatory” literally 0 enforcement allowed stores. People put mask get inside stores either uncover noses uncover entire wear chin support. work 600+ people construction site even half people wear masks inside work despite risking getting contractor 5,000 USD fine department building. Well positive side deaths fair bit peak - around 700 day vs 2500. Also immunity probably higher thought due cells Trump said he's masks maybe people actually wear things bit. Maybe that's principals met person. could show opening schools possible. NOT! remindme! 3 weeks Well Elon said 0 now, sooo guys know deaths decline right? pride stupidity. weird value prideful instead smart. pray, pray go away think that's bit much? absolutely helps, 100%. critical helps enough, usually showing virus could spread further. really know enough infectious doses quantify probability yet. stupid nation need president telling us behave. critical thinking lost art. Narrator: didn't. mindset one understand Whatever gains clicks. moment, yes, could change. US already paid secure first 300 million doses (potential) european vaccine AstraZeneca/Oxford. Tape gov say . tired fuci??? wrong, Brazil too. way, think worse, cause president copycat Trump, even Trump criticizing bolsonaro's way handling things. buddy drive two cars, friend gets in, give one car drive home insane, there's seemingly large overlap people first denying ""my body, choice"", abusing slogan sense ""not body - problem"" throwing another Q there: everyone got virus week percentage people would die? some, ethics Trump $$$. Oh yeah president bad... Like veeeeery bad... gonna argue that. guys lot deaths big population, that's expected. see death per capita rates, mean want brag currently number 1 Latin America... 
Dude even I'm amazed bad like said, president even believe science, like fucked? must health system less prepared lack prevention getting oxygen? Walk walk. Forgot go ninja go ninja go. Haha nice countrys doctors virologist convid response team, US jarred kushner trumps sun law Mike Pence relligous nut job message put covid concern old compromised. still put today even sub.

So surprise young people took heart fueling resurgence corona. Think bad now, wait till colleges start fall classes. going epic spreading virus country every state.

It's like message put beginning masks help, ""gift"" keeps giving. ""young people fear coronavirus"" misinformation. Yep.

Ordering double dose meds one patient administering secret dose another would get risk management ass fast even funny. graph shows abrupt increase two weeks ago. Something happened then... Yes, moronic give fuck anybody convenience. Absolutely moronic care somebody else might also something bad. give shit world, me, me, ever nobody else.

Thanks asking Thank you. like judged president dipshit. Americans vote him. makes sense. Returning citizens. receiving food something definitely disagree with. However, wife want intubated either. wanted hospitalized “alternative treatments”. convalescent plasma available, failed, really “alternative treatments” realistically make difference. Moving hospice/palliative care right decision. Starving not. sadly true. Thanks anti-science politicians politicized fucking pandemic win election!! Lots people learn exponential growth functions 🤦‍♂️ What? EU still deaths USA. Great idea. Helps save lives directly indirectly. Sick people cause manner disruption hospitalization quarantines, stress, etc, etc. They're little bundles terror running around messing everything come across. Look two people leaving quarantine following rules New Zealand. TWO people. France update numbers several days, might source confusion. stuck though worldometers. info official, verify sources. Last report July 1st ""918 new cases 18 new deaths"" curious. 
 
The site pretty reliable update official sources update, reliable countries let be.  IHME predictions probably eof weakest major predictions.

According [Yougang IHME model even beat baseline — would get drawing straight line chart. Source please. 

At point lockdown worth re-opened ready, kind undoing it. (It bought hospitals time get proper PPE, plan, research, find better treatments save lives.) 

People continue quarantining dramatically reduce risk dying. 

Also, died fear stress virus, fear regardless quarantine. would increased virus spread, dead bodies piled hospitals overrun. Lockdown would reduced that. cringe you’re weak really feel confident know much virus circulation maybe...what 6 months? Sure - definitely doomed. downplaying part problem. see people dropping like flies Wuhan censored videos? idea we’re for. get it, recover...Maybe we’ll fine. maybe trouble remembering things, climbing hills children. Maybe “it’s flu, bro”. maybe it’s airborne AIDS? scientist? Would bet life it? parent’s life?  dramatic taken seriously could tamped without ask questions. Soon we’ll know. gamble. think make crossed burn? paid profit insurance companies. decent societies healthcare systems situation like go massively budgets gov signs check public health.


This pointless argument, describing government bailout private hospitals, nothing whether insurance public private, quite possible US (and done!) without nationalizing health insurance. lot countries Medicare-For-All-style single-payer health insurance, Canada Taiwan, hospitals still private entities run government (unlike, say, British NHS, US VA system, hospitals also government-owned run). Government-run single-payer insurance pay largely-private hospitals procedures COVID, what's happening US, single-payer health insurance mean hospitals go bankrupt. positive side develop immunity next months corona wave /s I'm UK. well known local criminal jailed recently city coughing shop assistant claiming corona virus. He's sharpest tool box considering well known police. shop assistant show cctv recognise get arrested. got 8 months prison. Maybe someone less well known police may got away it, guy qualifies Britain's Dumbest Criminals. italy... chicken soup Hit rate meaning case fatality ratio?

You're going see go there's enough testing capacity keep sheer number cases soon, hospitals going hit capacity people dying street. 'some americans originally thought' Test positivity rate (positive cases every 100 tests) better parameter judge whether country testing adequately. Overall, test positivity rate USA 7.97% India 6.70%.
A majority Indians live villages. risk infection tiny. So, there's need test areas. That's tests per million low India. forget south full special buildings people hang sing hour two every Sunday.

Making subreddit 'political' reddit means turning mindless circlejerk. r/politics r/politicalhumour purpose. Usa really deserves nation time.

With half TrumpieDumbies ignoring social distancing rules, coming. understanding virus's mutate accidentally. following particular strategy. Every many thousands transmissions results mutations... matter chance rather imperfect replication.

Those mutations lead greater levels transmittably naturally dominate would cause speed replication go upwards.

With regards lethality virus beyond high threshhold fatality would particular mutation result reduction tranmission levels - sick dead host would able infect less people due reduced mobility. However would become apparent virus IFR much higher 1. something percent. instance ebola type virus IFR might many multiples ten higher.

But otherwise virus's work towards particular goal, follow particular strategy mere replication. 

This math. idealogy, strategy ambition part virus. Ah yes old ""but but"" argument. India tens thousands sick Americans. You’re comprehending. Lockdowns didn’t increase cases, decreased (exponentially). locked down, NYC cases dropped almost nothing. haven’t seen Covid patient ER weeks there, compared health system verge collapse, people literally dying alone hallway couldn’t/wouldn’t run code. states south track except without lockdowns. compare flu sickening. I’m sorry, Susan misinformed, spreading big problem ignorance least infectious Covid. Many people simply stupid it. live lives habits learned repeated training, cannot think enough understand recommendations. tech probably compatible people. That's much interest surrounding it. respectfully, sympathy comes tone deaf comment comes angry. think it: anger comes fear, yes, LOT people affected virus rudimentary level fear, turn affects mental health physical well-being. mention socioeconomic fallout surrounding virus itself. we're ~~in boat~~ planet. we're affected this. sooner recognize it, sooner come together overcome it. Test positivity rate (positive cases every 100 tests) better parameter judge whether country testing adequately. Overall, test positivity rate USA 7.97% India 6.70%. touch her, need keep 6 ft distance

Perhaps rent trailer, put Seems like watching poker streamers YouTube. There's plenty packed card rooms California New Hampshire. I’m waiting wave hit us here. worst part does, husband pretty much goner. I’m dreading fall they’re bound make kids go back school... ugh. translate ~3 dead 6 weeks? Close. Somerset County. Didn’t Trump state multiple times virus already dealt with?

Well.... UK estimated hit 100,000 cases day March testing low wasn’t captured. Korea Spain China Italy 0 deaths ages 0-9. think death children 0.0001 region I'll take bet. least president asking people stay homes. president even believe social isolation, country way pass US country deaths Interestingly, Australia, schools basically never closed. Daycare open whole time, students got like two weeks online learning March April. There's starting small hotspots cases Melbourne. 

From I've heard, children poor vectors covid19. Also luckily they're least likely become sick it. Good news you, least. Google friend. Use it. Especially post. NY state level cases though it? We’re acting like it’s gone? I’m going assume you’re either you’re Eastern Oregon. Wednesday’s grocery run day, today 100% mask wearing social distancing due mandate. cases ~275/day now, we’re pausing reopenings word full shutdown likely coming. Portland didn’t even get around opening restaurants started. governor mayors putting warnings people travel July 4th. We’ve already got field hospitals set case we’ve prepping.

Early governor turned away tests, people livid she’s hopefully learned lesson. Unfortunately, lot isolate rural areas, Trump administration absolutely hates us Portland’s here, getting tests getting issue. least awhile they’d test showed symptoms, since haven’t many cases, really limited things. think that’s changed now. testing sites Oregon subs couple weeks ago encouraging people come get tests, least. take account disease takes like week 2 shows symptoms guys least week growth (from cases started showing) + whatever time took lockdown measures implemented. 

This real issue, kills everyone becomes highly deadly enough beds/medicine death rates go up.

Whoever exposed last weeks pretty much playing gambling game now. matter time beds finish death rate skyrockets covid remaining untreated.

things get ugly fast people, can, stay indoors. cant, safe possible. seen first 6 months disease matter trump tells you, wont go away like miracle. would great did, wishful thinking.... pretty much worst possible response one could feasibly imagine. Thank gods charge  It’s mask live CT reading Reddit sooo many people going indoor stores without masks, went grocery store yesterday observed myself. one person wearing mask. one. It’s hard believe everywhere like this. don’t understand why. mean yea, it’s inconvenience first remember dumb thing get used pretty fast. It’s like even hour wearing clearly it’s working. missing big deal everyone making this. go CT! everyone else stay out! Lol guys fucked accidentally due lack knowledge.

The US purpose guy, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick says Dr. Fauci wrong. Mr. Patrick going eating words unfortunately many citizens sworn protect going get sick. Sorry I’m getting political feel awful people get infected healthcare workers logging many hours care patients. go lockdown again. way current administration would let happen. Happy cake day! help troll farms cater mentally ill americans huuuuge image issues..from entitlement machismo.. men women Count boiiiii let's get fredoooooooooom! earth flat! No. max Florida $275/week. Add $600 $875/week. would telling public virus less dangerous originally expected help pandemic response? That's literally adding fuel bonfire anti mask, anti lockdown conspiracy fueled nuttery. Oh, Ad5-nCoV phase 3 still going happen Canada? thought they're phase 3 Brazil month 9000 volunteers. Brit here. Hold beer... Putting people jail right probably really bad idea snitches break law order something snitch about? know. virus modelling Swine Avian flu.

My friend done quite bit modeling Italy, UK, Sweden vs Finland / Norway etc, US.

My realistic model finishes 1M 1.96M model protests, (BLM Anti Mask people). use masks smashed disease countries everyone uses it.

My model USA detected cases, third deaths Corona.

These studies released show shortfall is. slow patchy testing, Trump killing far confirmed cases. Also states like Florida classifying death infection rates. Yep dad tested positive one drove hospital so..... It’s mostly India young population, low obesity rate already-high death rate diseases, simply don’t get many 80+ vulnerable people average age death 69. Compare US it’s perfect combination older population, higher obesity rate ignorance towards science it’s heaven covid. Yet Italy’s initial surge April 6th 14,000 deaths full knowledge China’s measures? I’m looking data tells me. mistrust China, entirely separate  making dad's efforts vain... Thank you. I’m going delete post mislead others. Well know guys hard headed don’t want nobody impeaching muh freedums go ahead ever like don’t surprised you’re one left alive family expert subject, indeed, far know kissing done anyway. Regardless Covid. Hospitalizations deaths scarier metric tbh, though still know long term effects virus lung function health... testing alot though. look important numbers too. % positivity, daily hospitalization death rate.

Here hopkins positivity rate number rate comparable mid May. 350k tests then. 600k+ tests now. Yes, treding back bad direction fo positivity rate far lowest low 4%. States 90 million people? think so... It’s almost like going beach protesting bad ideas. almost like never let republican get elected ever again. mean mere fact sign waiver go game lets people using lizard brain know unsafe hell there. Given logic, Trump also resign. I'm sure enough grandma's funeral. Well month we're 50,000. seen directly caused protests though. relaxed restrictions stupid people mostly blame. image issues strong america.. seen president? Suge thrown balcony chance. everyone survive! Kenya kids old people use mask months public. one died using mask here. Yeah absolutely love English mustard holy cow know stepped line. dijon want flavour without sensation pins jabbed nasal cavity. False, nobody get unless pay 5000 dollars cash money. wedding 100+ people go Saturday. Found state limit wedding sizes 300...  'murica fredum Desantis think transparency necessary obvious nothing-burger. No, want pay people snitching, like Nazis. read papers. author link clearly goal mind, I.e. disagreeing masks. actually read underlying articles quoted, see fact find evidence wearing mask decreases risk spreading someone else Like rallies. going mind? Given read, could explain densely populated places like Taiwan single digital fatalities? singapore 100s new cases every day fatalities? 

The challenge reading lies you. Sure cases increasing. needs looked following data:

1. Increase testing 
2. Increase fatalities 
3. Increase hospital critical care capacity 

1 clearly rising many states. explains rise “cases”. 

2 clearly downward trend, weeks. isn’t “oh wait 2-3 weeks”. spikes happens four weeks ago? Fatalities begun result that. haven’t. 

3 high certain places like 76% Florida counties. many places spike capacity 30%. 

So get high horse. everyone who’s sanguine data unable understand it. That’s ok concert threshold permitted reunions (talking ass, europe It’s 20 people)

Belgium five times many deaths already point time. consider infections grew exponentially, approximately doubling week, takes three weeks average infection fatality, Belgium may 5\*2\*2\*2 = 40 times many infections locked down. way around, Sweden may 1/40th infections Belgium onset set measurements.

I sure get numbers.

Both countries first confirmed death time - March 10-11. time Belgium less 300 confirmed cases Sweden 600. Yes, check material guide see lot posts mocking response USA COVID-19 looking Europe everything went well there. It’s nonsense.

In opinion, total deaths deaths per 1 million population much better indicators impact COVID-19 compared number cases. add deaths Europe much greater US, many European countries ahead US deaths per million population. 

Comparing number cases fallacy. taking account amount testing done. death count much better indicator impact virus.

The number deaths per day USA dropped well peak, indicating spread virus actually dropping. number new cases per day increasing, extensive testing done now.

The media report sensationalist headlines, worst virus already over. foolish continue hysteria. 

You check facts country in. Spoke pediatrician said study done early (I remember where) saying children really spread it, done lockdown kids going school / daycare anyways. Sooo.. course main spreaders home day. rand pauls optimism surely save winning yet? Public transport it’s mandatory, shops it’s way 50% live rural Oklahoma. county pop almost 500 cases last couple weeks partly chicken processing plant. Got everyone edge living fear again. Hospitalizations didn’t move. Deaths didn’t move. it’s going again... majority cases mild younger people healthier older generations. Jeez I'm lucky ,upstate taking seriously. saw woman kicked store forgetting mask home. store enforce damn rule people see wearing them. 

As question, many dude. many. Perfect, beautiful people. People telling me, ""Sir, noone knows beautiful people, do, dont..."" said, ""These beautiful people whos ever tired winning, favorite president (me) knows tired winning!

That sounds positive, positively negative. 50/50 shops public transport well? Germany mandatory like 98% follow otherwise fines (don't know much enforce it) US flatten curve made halfpipe Even sarcastically bow show forward? Hi!
I'm India (was US December) guess give everyone good comparison.
India without doubt reporting testing easy perform tests large population. India poor, everyone expected that. India also long lockdown period (over 100 days writing post) ineffective varying extent. People afford staying home going required businesses slowly opening (""Unlockdown"" called here; weird name opinion) expected infection rate rise.
Having said that, people vigilant wear masks take precaution going outside. Wearing masks basically compulsory going work even purchase groceries.
The public health care system bad everyone access it, especially rural areas. Getting Covid test done also hassle. many prefer take much precaution can.

TL;DR - India accepted lot cases difficult control (for various reasons). People finding ways work around keep businesses running time tell effective is. 

Side note: poorest India perhaps worst hit seems case lot countries I'm sure big factor is. you’re curious downvoted, said equivalent “Ah yes “pi” favorite nUmBeR.” e constant that’s 2.718.  Animals 4th July mess. Vaccines cause birth defects. great book titled. We're Number One Andrew Shapiro. essence we're number one worst ways.

My friend keeps citing RCT studies masks available eyes study invalid. LiBeRaTe AmErIcA really. think infringe people's civil liberties. started AMA want check it:

  Oregon better job reporting numbers CA. reported 8931 cases 5900 active cases. 3000 difference antibody tests? numbers reported county states inconsistent mess. left garbage here? number deaths per day USA continues drop steadily. reason number cases going testing done. Stop hysteria. Check out. mobility data North South looks extremely similar timeline wise speed re-opening. 

Your point impression people get, data doesn’t support impression. Go play around possible? Fearless Leader told us going disappear! think post removed point, happens wanted say: look like very, bad human being. anyone could see beyond me. Yup. Lyft (corporations) prefer money human values. say perspective Lyft driver. don’t shit customers wearing masks except never match again. ONE person crowd think “yeah might great idea.” Jesus anyone ever actually read article?? painfully stupid. “Some might die, that’s sacrifice I’m willing take $$$” Official numbers dutch CDC is:

98% without mild symptoms
1.5% needs hospital care
0.5 needs ICU care. 

Now dont know ICU survival rate would guess puts IFR around 0.2. Herd immunity work try slow rate infection. USA speedrunning obviously result herd immunity.

3-4 months immunity asymptomatic cases. Maybe end vent much longer immunity lifetime. temporary sadness future happiness.

i clue mean that. numbers came site soon updated. last day could fat finger corrected tomorrow. sits 26% positive rate, insane. 

if look overall trend case numbers positive rates going up. testing dramatically greater.  love people constantly complain things like CNN NY Times ""fake news"" trust anything posted random idiot Facebook. 

A friend's girlfriend day saying think Dr. Fauci qualified enough able say wearing masks everything read Facebook says really protect you. 

Dr. Fauci appointed director National Institute AIlergies Infectious Diseases 1984. considered world's foremost expert infectious diseases. 

She'd rather take advise Sally Housewife Facebook says people wearing masks public bunch idiot sheeple, following herd. 

I'm going stick Dr. Fauci one. 

I also told estimated approximately 40% posts Facebook encouraging people wear masks actually traced accounts based Russia countries. says still trusts people CNN. 

Thanks Donald Trump helping make Facebook #1 trusted news source U.S. Oh fucks sake People selfish, fking selfish. way predict symptoms stop before?

Also, makes last long you?

Forgive asking I’m big fan starting ban assholes can’t wear mask. Fuck em whole thing made become vegetarian honestly. can't justify supporting industry operates like this. Texas pretty high population football fans, no? tell wear mask football won’t happen? NFL season probably isn’t happening regardless might kick ass gear. American exceptionalism. ...with coffins. they’re anything like Texas, imagine folks actually judicious wearing masks first. noticeable spike occurred predicted two week mark think people started normalizing risk ended partaking riskier behaviors time went on. agree MontCo. rarely see someone indoors without mask. I’m less concerned outdoors. everyone across country wore one indoors would virtually eliminated threat. We're sick Boomers everyone else is. Right! That's exactly BLM protesters said went millions. Us poors supposed use live next year.

We squandered things like rent food. Here's what's really scary - hurricane season start. if, god forbid, Houston gets hit another Harvey-level storm? Florida - they're similar boat

Do order people evacuate? shelter place? No, protests still ridiculous. would even prefer country go lockdown. office's current form lockdown example one simply make sense, needlessly giving us *some* higher degree COVID exposure making us come office, giving us greater work capabilities working home, neither amenities home *or* office. repeatedly say felt US much testing. way saying wasn’t kidding. Excellent! manager grocery store fayette county: allowed HR enforce mask mandate, even clean carts. people complained so. shows much mandates aren’t enforced Hell _knew_ exponential growth briefly stumped achieving herd immunity 70% would taken days less herd immunity 100%. brief amount time, felt stupid nonetheless. Wrong sites go don’t require anything mother ironing clothes young. told touch hot iron. reached ironing board touched bottom hot plate. screamed, turned around asked did. 

She shook head went get burn cream. people tell something hot, believe them. USA #1 false. possible patients milder cases even asymptomatic patients end lung damage. Ohio example anyone tested free testing time high.

It's true anyone tested. 

They test came contact someone tested positive symptoms. doctor request it. wait, thought already this. app implied were... July... wait fall.

We beyond screwed. Luckily state (MA) zero deaths yesterday 2nd lowest positivy rate US.

Why? 95+% wearing masks restaurants still indoor dinning. gyms. Waiting rooms simple oil change car closed ect ECT.

So happy took seriously hit hard anytime NYC hit hard...we always next NJ many NYers ties here.

Wow, much extra pollution driving everywhere. person FB tried telling I’m sheep wearing masks local governments acting like Hitler making masks mandatory. They’re delusional nothing change minds unless certain someone comes says masks work. Amish Mennonite communities I've seen seem worried. went gas station last week ""requires"" facemasks (it posted doors) folks without masks group 8 Amish. definitely varies communities, Amish way tune open ""outside world"" others often work closely outside community, probably least somewhat aware happening world.  biggest toll everyone else fatigued, take seriously. Good point. Bobby Hill would guess. almost like massive protests riots recently ""So said, 'Slow testing, please!' listen folks, true! know did, heh, well I'll tell ya, made financially crippled sick people America get tests anymore, afford one! like magic, virus went away, good thing ya know, did, things going good appeared, polls, people love me. fixed all, oh yes did, fake news media even give credit, believe that?! They're unfair me, believe me. Sad."" Or, confirmation put list possible preexisting conditions overturned ACA expose everyone to. Deaths dropping, definitely encouraging.

I think continue see decline multiple reasons:

1. we've heard billion times, deaths come last: Test positive Hospitalized ICU level care Death (Although may occur time- pt tests positive ED prior admission; pt went straight ED ICU; pt died ED transfer right getting ED)  (not mention, hospital capacity keep ""alive"" ICU level care long time, even recovery near impossible, long patient declared brain dead. friendly reminder prepare advanced directive matter age family members guess would wanted actually get care would wanted). 
2. Thus far seems younger age groups make larger portion positive cases time around, likely drive mortality rate down. 
3. We've improved management patients: i.e. prone positioning, remdesivir, convalescent serum.
4. Hospitals overrun, *yet*. deaths really spike (see NY Italy). hospitals overrun, patients get correct level care appropriate staffing. Examples: pt ICU goes med-surg floor, worse, hallway ED. Or, (see TCH Houston), pediatric hospital begins admitting adult patients staffed pediatricians nurses w/o adult care training.

&amp;#x200B;

So yes, deaths declining *for now*. reasonable expect bump next weeks, hopefully bad April/May. note, Arizona, Florida, Texas shutdown way NY saw type ride, might interesting July.

I'd also encourage everyone research lasting effects viral pulmonary disease. Death outcome- pts requiring hospitalization (esp ICU level care) long lasting complications. think saw one study suggested CT scans asymptomatic patients tested + underlying disease. far, good!

(1) cases going higher states like AZ, FL, TX less cases per capita originally?

(2) states simply converging toward time terms cases per capita?

(3) degree immunity built among population reason places like NY, CT, MA, IL seeing less cases now?

/s ""It's time alarmed..."" - 07/01/2020, Pikachu saw one wild, crocheted mask cover. longer takes us worse economic damage. believe unifying issue-no matter are, pretty much want rich! Eh --- we're honest, back late March mid-April, **LOTS** New Yorkers abandoning city going Florida spots. quarantining, despite various orders.

And really get explosion cases Florida then.

Travel transmission vector. based above, think PRIMARY vector. part End lockdown masks absurd crowd.

just flat Earth, opinion? tell moon landing faked? Thanks advance. Happens spend much time alone rural areas. weeks, positive rate New Jersey also 50%. Things weren’t going great here—we 2nd hardest hit state. high positive rate indication weren’t testing enough, doesn’t tell us much else itself.

Ultimately, NJ got it, turned lower per capita case death rate New York, even though NYS never positive rate high ours.

Hopefully, people Mexico get this, too! Alright stop! Contaminate listen... sheeps donation IIRC proud state (NJ) one two nation numbers go previous week. again, among first close fully last reopen (slowly). I’ve played Plague, Inc. Based this, exponential growth phase keep doubling rapidly. win? Many people still point needed unified message, flip-flop Never meant imply all. 
Can chill, please? oof, yeah, say ""San Fran"" San Francisco. People REALLY hate it. 

The thing worse ""Frisco"". apparent overt now. Unfortunately State Corps decided overall existence important human life spans 80-90 years old. Sometimes da folks ivory castle need wake calls hear drums distance. seems pointing things tapering off. really sure fuss ""record new cases"" means detect coronavirus, doesn’t mean detect coronavirus. it’s sensitive enough give false positive detects antibodies coronavirus. could dangerous. someone hears antibodies likely take proper precautions thinking immunity already, reality don’t. new deaths incline though. might much closer herd immunity initially thought would. Unless miracle vaccine happen feel like we’re going end deaths per capita. Sweden got faster.  dunno. “the flu”  even title... Adopt legally call Nestor. Iwamoto didn’t find semen? know found blood stool urine new one. Although makes sense kidney issues severe patients got back Papa Murphy's semi-rural California. One employee mask all. One mask big nose hanging out. Another employee mask around neck.

Bonus. customer mask around neck leaning sneeze guard watching pizza made.

Bonus2. even sign door saying masks required real post? PA already one top five hardest hit states? Seems weird require masks now. Sounds like good weekend me!  I’m surprise people find Ubers takes usually 20 minutes find one test lol. can’t understand rate 50%, can’t understand math. 

Mexico testing people clearly it. 

And ya, result low confirmed cases.

Again, math.

I’m trump fan, isn’t wrong says confirmed cases got stop testing every person symptoms- percentage positive cases go up.

Obviously stop testing USA, understand privileged country, mass testing available, 100% part (not all) reason USA numbers high compared places like Mexico. pan out, say, within year, change name Betrayed&amp;BrokeMoron. bright side, death rate high. US always incredibly high number new test cases. testing kept understand ICUs fill first? keep saying things ignore anyone answers why.  write code full gas mask 8 hours days. Oh, anti masker. Keep assuming. see months utterly embarrassing party ppl like you. Thanks tips! need kill poison ivy hate using roundup already explained “them” is. You’re one assigned politics something didn’t even mention, outing agenda.

But lol last line, outed troll. Goodbye, America hater. I'm prepared lose useless karma I'm part End lockdown masks absurd crowd.

But would never ever go public place give worker hard time job. I've ordering everything online. canceled gym membership bought equipment. Oh well.

As absurd think whole thing is, people getting minimum wage grocery store deserve get yelled at. Cases broke normal range June 18th, like 13 days since then... Earlier pandemic, deaths appeared lag cases 2 weeks, Iran's second wave/surge shows 3 - 4 weeks range. hard say expect rising deaths next days, still week two out, think they're definitely coming, think probably lows past weekend going lows deaths quite time come. American Health insurers aren’t known generosity. funny thing it’s still entirely possible said could happen. entirely virtuous reasons, it’s golden PR opportunity firm step publicly “do right thing” offer tests little cost. It’s weird world bloodthirsty corporations often seem humane government people, it’s theme keeps repeating throughout experience. U.S. failed state Yeah. lack empathy. country gonna hoisted freedumb petard. Also fireworks... What? 👏👏👏 Weird. McDonalds going full capacity July 6th Sask. yeah dont follow usual death rates latin countries, maybe cause fat anyone going anywhere anyway Florida, yall real? Even kids relatively safe COVID, avenue infection going grow ten fold. fuck doing. Lol  University Minnesota, we're starting person classes end august. said they'll make ""accommodations"" help prevent spread spread lectures, teachers able make classes online not.

But FFS, could work small college maybe, top 10 US student population 51,000 students, middle city, students know reliant public transport get classes student buses literally pack like sardines. Everyone parties like crazy, game days insane thousands people going see student games, etc.

We're absolutely fucked. I'm forced go back, like colleges they're giving option go back. reason could think making people come back big international population it'd impossible regulate wildly different timezones. Here's L.A. County hospitalizations; watch metric we're doing. chart goes 6/29 (they updated yet). day back exactly ""peak"" April. 

I hope LACC still prepped hospital, may need keep angry. :(  replies tweet predictably horrible. tweeted accurately masks required indoors cant stay 6 feet apart...maybe would less horrible replies.

Whoever wrote tweet fired. Especially governor himself, know better. Wow, must tough leave jalapeño brain? Wear mask. Arizona seeing this. death count today far surpassed previous day. hospitals going crisis treatment that's likely get better. Even incomplete. lack proper care diseases also increase overall death number. Give three weeks. Ooft read? 

“more half 76 asymptomatic people infected board show significant lung abnormalities immediately apparent.” 

“They looked study asymptomatic COVID-19 patients cruise ship. CAT scans showed lung damage even without experiencing symptoms.” 

“In asymptomatic patients, 60% abnormalities confined one lung, 90% group 2 patients abnormalities lungs. groups 3 4 showed mixed patterns areas fluid replaced air lung, leading swelling hardening tissues.” 

Lmao, pathetic. Arizona Texas showing noticeable death rate increase 7 day averages. cases increased earlier rest country death rates likely also early indicator death rate country. shutdowns fine themselves; reopening soon that’s problem *encouraging* mask use rather **demanding it**. 

It’s good though. states getting hard hit idiots top frankly deserve going continue disregard human health life freedumb. curse mean deserved it.

According Wikipedia:

* beast cursed cruel nature. curse could lifted earning love another.
* Snow White cursed Maleficent invited christening. curse punish Aurora's parents. Slow pace exactly problem. far sure long antibodies last effective. Immunity corona viruses cause common cold lasts weeks. SARS MERS lasts several months several years. experts believe case lifetime immunity. back one, though conclusion yet, many experts believe last 2-3 months, means re-infection possible long population covered half time period.

Edit: back NY. reopening, almost states seen rising R, new cases overall surges new high. includes NY rising back 1.00. ""Positive Test"" section, see relationship test volume new case count recent days. also means test insufficient, cases likely get tested. catching news actually said today, ""at point going disappear, hope.""

Every day week. Every week month. Every month year. can't keep parody stupid remarkable dumb things he'll say.  Around .4-1%, probably somewhere between, CDC puts .26% counting asymptomatic people. I’m still riding Uber Lyft damn virus control. I’ll comply don’t know driver car me. Oh, periot. got funny one missed biggest one: weather. Crazy idea but: universal affordable healthcare pocket costs haha bring politics first calling ""them"" called ""them"" now, thus confirming it? 

What's disgusting level intelligence, wilfully stupid denial, dangerous hysteria, hypocrisy, rhetoric. We, Americans forget done country. Please, go deface another statue white man fought freedom blacks bc dim read plaque. Can't son gf get tested keep windows down? really think car would much safer going *airport* *flying* even San Jose BUR. 

The 5 freeway like 250 mi open desert. Rest stop bathrooms kept generally clean, reason go truck stops pay gas pump bring snacks. generally chances encountering infected person MUCH lower. loooots excess mortality.

Not anymore don't. [Try h two Ns God damn it, stepdad thinks watching porn lmfao Ugh. Fort Worth, TX checking in. people wear masks here. Like less 25%. It’s discouraging. ""Listening public health experts improves public health""

Some Nobel prize worthy stuff here. Deaths trending down. States cooking books covid related deaths. Texas reporting massive surge ""pneumonia"" deaths. I'm struggling question. take physical PPE precautions want none anything help single infected person building (either staff client) contaminating air micro droplets settle hours. I'm trying weigh risk getting normal cleaning/checkup risk getting COVID. Skipping one appointment bad risk, probably going worse December I'm due again. Skipping whole year (or keeps on) considerably bigger risk. God knows *now* case numbers rising safest later might looking back fondly gentle days early 2020. might finally come reasonable treatment COVID going December would big deal even got treatment easy safe. There's way know. mean don’t see closing state borders would bad idea gets extremely bad certain states ""Supposedly?"" could possibly reason. Good redditor. hate Indian food, still bomb lol Rooting deaths vs acknowledging seriousness threat two *very* different things.

You must one anti-mask people. Anyone also subscribed r/formula1 read wrong confused You’re correct posters here. Yale bulk reddit crowd seem liberally skewed. know religious nuts going say vaccine act god thanks Trump's ""warp speed"" initiative, right? give scientists second recognition. Posted twice earlier responses thread tell death rate. dare you. like millions going bars, importantly.

Burrrrrrn got antibody test tons caveats positive negative case (I tested negative). boiled ""we dont know results really mean anything. could got virus, long enough develop antibodies could antibodies might stop second infection"". also potential caveat guarantee antibodies stay body long term. 

I'm sure point plasma treatments make sense. one going year years ago. know, I've tried two since April they've failed, fact takes long establish makes wary trying again.

1. thought Chinese cutesy PSAs play trains whatnot nice, especially since Canada too. Turns average Chinese person considers bit Orwellian absurdity, looked around heard commentary Wandering Earth. description like South Koreans Japanese make sense - west though, basically projection Model Minority myth, actually hilariously problematic reasons.
2. Similar here; like people's reporting India, much Africa. either run away assumption they're special third-world hellhole, somehow wrong model everything, truth even somewhere stances loaded ideological baggage. real truth they're humans moderately workable government thus able start building better lives children, average.

NP xD. fair, two sides; just, far see, two loudest sides, #2 becoming increasingly loudmouthed since 2016.

From understanding happened China, local government Wuhan screwed really, really badly - though really par with, say, Governor Texas today. They, hell entire world, would right angry local government - abstractly, perverse system incentives set local government decide try delay brush rug. rest government also furious said government, promptly dismissed them, far I've heard.

But west even need look Asian culture! Seriously, Australia legitimate Inter-state quarantine, measure Canada USA believe 'unconstitutional'. Australia care; quarantine states, deployed armed forces ensure external quarantine measures upheld. result? They're really, really well. Way better thought they'd do, based initial statements, sounded like planning go lockstep USA merely blame China.

In short, Australia actually utilized plague control measures western liberal state able use, used them, unlike rest us.

 

"" public acceptance poverb ""Spare rod, spoil child."" "" Ugh, government understood much rest world accept proverb, especially field diplomacy. Ah well. Weaker indeed. Still hard dismiss death count. Wuhan CCP partychair fired ""disappeared"" April.

At least PR side things actually kind depressingly correct. Right worlds eyes USA, would willing bet countries problem bad severely testing know way updated it, reflect thin, actual chiffon heavier knit stretch fabric? would guess depends country.

You probably count excess mortality numbers US accurate year two now. Even 3rd world countries, numbers governments dont seem accurate organizations countries investigate figure estimate close real numbers.

HIPAA applies covered entities protecting someone’s health information. basically keeps hospital doctors office releasing protected health information, doesn’t apply way people trying say regards masks.

HIPAA doesn’t stop random person asking disability illness is. stops covered entities providing information without patient’s consent. also sometimes makes patient transfer continuity care difficult, since hinders development universal least easily transferable healthcare records. transferred hospitals, patients still arrive hospital’s ER with, best case scenario, printed paper copies chart or, worst case, nothing all. neighbor bread route handles local chic-fil-a. said literally serving many people logistically possible every day via drive thru. actually like ingredients demand incredibly stable, little waste. classmate mine considered severe case (i.e. hospitalization required). told drink fluids, take Tylenol, rest.

Perhaps treatment plan varies hospital hospital?

However, one acknowledge wearing masks wasn’t common sense prior April. ebola probably help. aliens come invade earth. Honestly humans dumb Quick test 100% accurate. Normally quick test positive/suspected result confirmed PCR/ELISA test. That’s done countries, sure Murica though. Mentally Deficient Politicians?

""Excuse sir, might want wear mask I've spent day highly infectious Covid patients."" lol think turn question ages.

Latin-EX Yeah, they're hitting capacity limits AZ FL. happened NY. Positivity rates go people decide testing much hassle. Then, severity cases spike people wait longer go hospital. got point people showing hours left live here. Yeah, mean it’s already bizarre world we’re in, it’s really taken another level. Follow question, make people slightly smarter California Texas? Big Gretch best today, husband saw man jogging giant Trump flag...so, clearly followers don’t see single bad thing him.

Tell people something they'll find every reason like told do. I've worn mask everywhere I've gone months seriously easiest thing ever. stop cases holy Crap would make difference Take number deaths NYC divide entire NYC population, result already 0.2%. assumes 100% population infected, absurd. went stock market, probably crash 2021... Soooo went pockets ""smart money"" (the wealthy elites) see obvious writing wall selling stocks bid created ""dumb money"". problem logic COULD give flu respiratory illness multiple people pass grandma I’m saying COVID flu. I’m saying could passed various illnesses many people resulted deaths throughout entire life. It’s healthy mindset live way realistic one would number tests month days

Subtle. ; ) Looks like Bible Belt going get wrapped around necks many science-doubting fundamentalist Christians suffocate them. numbers rising bigly. 

Only highest numbers greatest country ever seen ever something velcro plastic. Oh, don’t worry. tested 1400 people per day. That’s all. Texas blown past Italy NYC indicators without locking down. three months we’re playing football lots folks stands Mexico definitely testing enough though. way way behind like, everyone, per capital testing. last line article.

Edit: Almost 2 months old articles information apocalyptic, incredibly sad taxing everyone. didn’t bad. hated SERE training. bad though. Speedy recovery affected. Lick taint call Clydene article says invite someone it. still behaves like sort moron. I’ve trouble Uber drivers wanting wear masks. Uber policy drivers must take selfie app start drive showing they’re wearing masks. remove pull mask.

Nothing stopping anyone mid ride, maybe Uber require selfies passengers drivers. Britain manufacturing doses already like US though? impression distribution would possibly begin early September take awhile reach us average people. Widely reported EU press hospitals Texas struggling cases. Basically London Italy back March. Hope guys cope case load. biggest concern people find ""get-arounds"" wearing masks like poking several holes masks, wearing extremely thin ""breathable"" masks etc point wearing mask useless defeats purpose. 

I really wish everyone understood gravity situation took masks 100% seriously. dunno. 

I live country proper government response (mostly) citizen behaviour. big protest rise infections it.

Was great idea outside? nope. go - poster responding racist troll cruising around posting crap little science back - unlike stuff highlighting. Numbers don’t lie. past twenty years there’s 1100ish pneumonia deaths Feb May. year there’s 5000? It’s pneumonia due COVID-19 they’re hiding detail.  Like said wasn’t good math. Thank guys 😅 Yeah, social distancing wont problem folks... Faster economical ... think good pragmatic approach fine. Thia deep state trying sow misery. people fine better. hearts filled joy love. God bless them. Even experts admit know long-term implications virus even recovering. significant reports long-term damage among young people due virus.

But welp, *clearly* know better combined right? Society made mistake listening Beaches open weekend... clearly isn’t concerned enough. Good, also charging rider $200 fee gets donated charity. Uber make money this, scumbags trying spread infection get hit wallets. IHME predictions probably eof weakest major predictions.

I remember back april predicting something like 30k deaths august whilst models predicting 100-250k august we're seeing now. careful making suggestions sub. Certain smaller states could even use method test everyone span weeks. would give us great idea actually stand. round 1 end? brief pause covid sending jabs, round never ended yet. fucking time. actually can’t.  sub seen articles even ""over"" initial covid infection lingering, often debilitating painful, possibly life long effects infection. also seen articles studies currently two vaccines small scale trials.

I'm curious. baseball players pretty spread out, though. figure alternative dugouts might reasonably safe. weren’t even close right lol. I’ll try make short possible basically:

1) Closed soon. Like less 50 cases. You’ll realize bad read on.

2) $1.6bn budget COVID. Almost NOTHING show it. ~4 months lockdown hospital capacity wasn’t increased all. fact, government got scammed 7 (or more) mobile hospitals shit ton wasted money basically. Huge shortage specialty doctors.

3) Curfews ID simply fckin stupid. Obliterates workers, keeps people people vehicles inside. NOTHING markets COVID spreads across LatAm. Curfews ID something Panama done (now GT too) that’s it’s stupid measure.

4) Markets. can’t shut people starve. case Peru, Guatemala, Chile basically. government media (all biased) blame citizens COVID spread staying home it’s government’s fault imo years.

I Guatemalan citizenship I’ll temporarily move 1 week work. Why? transit every 2 weeks here. Guatemala transit more. job biostatistics grey area essential work I’ll better GT.

Honduras Guatemala similar. Years corruption poverty hinders efforts needed fight COVID (stay home, social distancing, etc.) Bless you, internet stranger. I'm good family. know people sick recovered. masks made mandatory public, could eradicate virus less month. didn’t. realize Ireland gotten hold it.

People saying black people immune covid. Lmfao That’s fucking funny Whoa Well let's look tests done per positive case shall Zealand eradicated except border quarantines (341.3 tests per case)

Australia eliminated it, starting see small outbreaks victoria nothing can't handled (316.2 per case)

USA **12.4** tests per positive case, better 8 still piss poor tests.

You've tested also richest country history planet biggest GDP per capita outside tax/oil havens many tests are. get shot sent labor camp die. trust, arizona ER doctors reddit phds? choose virtual face face Atlanta area. do, don’t internet social media bullhorn can’t spread nonsense get following idiots whose think alike.

edit: literally true Can't careful seeing us us acting Correct can't stop it. possible mitigate it. Sadly see states Federal government rising task protect them. Jeff Bezos feel like shit going work normally cash pretty low bar. increased cases, queues testing make testing less accessible, people likely assume wide scale social isolation becomes norm less point confirmation. say successfully contained virus places like NY NJ? around 1,500 deaths per million population places like California Florida 100s. anything looks like they’ve reached either form herd immunity vulnerable people killed already. mean NY NJ alone account 45,000 deaths. we’re finally seeing spread CA, TX, FL, AZ recently spared virus. U.S. far worse, nearly bad. hope guys kick ass! ¡Viva Mexico! always dream living least visiting! God bless. narrative trying take hold. Blame protestor terrorists, Memorial Day partiers, bar hopping drunkards, church services, trump rallies, country music concerts, etc. Also, would lead even people saying ""The numbers lie!

I think pretty beneficial short terms too, maybe people take seriously. Dang where’s shopping month ago watched schlub mask open mouth cough freezer. Like, hell America. I’m sure needing hospital care = mild symptoms? Netherlands nobody quite ill home? know bad b/c many hospitals taken huge financial since first time trying avoid (see TMC). DeSantis still he's shutting anything sttez. even choice NK doesnt deserve recognition thing. Many Americans still refusing:
[Opponents sue Palm Beach county block mask favorite part article:
""The 37-page complaint, filed Tuesday, claims Palm Beach County “recklessly required countless American citizens Florida residents ... submit dangerous medical treatments well-known risks potential serious injuries death, including forced wear harmful medical devices like masks.”""

Who knew wearing masks would ""potential serious injuries death""? Unfortunately, can't find statistics online regarding number yearly deaths health care workers mask wearing sounds like numbers must pretty high Florida. anyone could link stats, I'd love know many deaths last year. refuse listen fact based science

Where fuck get from? Projecting much?

Blocked. Waaaay better without crazy. Remember scary USA first case repatriated back USA Wuhan back late January? Remember attention back America nursing home deaths Seattle initial outbreak? Remember 100 cases USA big deal?

Remember South Korea big outbreak back late Feb, considered one hotspots (along China, Iran, Italy)? &lt;10K reported cases - USA hit 5x single day.

China &lt;85K total reported cases - USA many new cases last 48 hours

It's crazy quickly many Americans normalized danger threat. scary, would fascinating study human psychology take care wisdom tooth trying grow nasal cavity? brush floss, taking plyers drill back sounds like professionals sometimes needed regardless clean teeth are. That's thing never tell recovery stories. Many Americans likely crippling debt remainder adult lives. One best friends coronavirus early this. One colleagues almost certainly test positive week. could require facemasks far less expensive actually prevent passengers contracting covid whereas barrier not. Requiring mask issue since every single rational adult wearing one everywhere go already anyone wearing one publicly shamed, ridiculed and/or avoided. can't stop virus getting nursing homes. People get sick people work nursing homes. Im philly 95%+ people wear masks. batshiat insane. put NASA research center Huntsville, AL. desire escape earth main motivator scientists there. live Southeast Michigan, went grocery store today every weeks. Maybe half people mask. includes employees. Outside store number far fewer. Lately rarely leave small neighborhood community reality situation really sets in. Med Zeppelin South Korea months. public health agencies late game hurts. selling surgical masks local grocery stores. guess I'll buying wearing public since safer. actually feel extremely safe public one on. honestly thought going get Covid coughed positive patient, close contact extended periods time. positive experiences surgical masks pretty effective. United American great track record protecting passengers unless buildings get way.  What’s going Navajo nation heartbreaking. literally call Doctors Without Borders. third world country sending PPE Doctors Without Borders coming help disgraceful. aren’t natives ones right free healthcare America? Literally going on! Uber needs give drivers right kick people charge Huge penalty. Industrial supply sources again. hard get one.

I feel bad anyone allowed wear one, companies hiding behind, ""Well, that's CDC's recommendation!""

Fuck that. fact working hospital make immortal. ok guys, sending prayers way. Holy crap - absolutely brutalizing Western hemisphere. Gonna rough several months ahead massive testing contact tracing hope start containing disease. 

Why taking long governments USA get board this? pretty stupid karen comment. McDonald's worldwide tend get busy dining room. *cough* \*virginia\* *cough*

(I corona btw) positive rate statistics meaningless anyway unless testing good random sample population. think people like hear big numbers get scared. Younger people well fact deaths lag quite bit compared new cases. 3 weeks. Canada Day we're reporting much still around anyways. Oh good lord... wrong us think lasting damage hospitalized patients. Milder cases changes lungs, nothing permanent stay home orders (basically mean quarantine) US lifted point. wanted add case aware. going tag ears afterward?    start shock awe offensive Abilene weekend. shock value though. Wait, what? know available. counties? another COVID sub doesn’t outright ban mention politics? Unfortunately can’t separate politics coronavirus point feel like ton content getting removed here. Well, I’m gonna ask they’ve ever known sheep. pettiness might part problem. cope denial, cope sarcasm. F Next 2020 Looks like 87k today, making 11% positive. Yowch. get food pool, people would still going. Well, us Oh definitely screwed. That's big oof viruses level transmissibility lethality two different things. I'm making opinion whether new strain higher mortality rate not. virus easily transmissible mortality rate extremely low. also spread easily mortality rate extremely high. apologize ahead time misinterpreted statement. 500k tests get 10% positive per day US thousand times daily cases South Korea. Oh damn... used go swing dancing too... like 2005-2006. agree. Pensacola's downtown wonderful. Palafox become really nice area. live DC area now, Pensacola favorite bar butcher shop, great restaurants. HIPAA, HIPPA. like hippo.  Mexican colleague mine shared meme guy passed near bunch empty corona bottles... back February. 
“First Mexican Coronavirus fatality.”
I doubt making light situation anymore. carefully Bingo. instead offering community development, mental health counseling, skill training finacial aid, instead spew propaganda, religion false hope. Based plans going schools southern states, case. Schools open, normal capacity, SUGGESTION safeguards...and know well Americans deal suggestions. Yeah that's people stupid claiming idea talking about. people state wearing masks make inhale get poisoned carbon monoxide (not dioxide, apparently). heard person state covid 19 already mouth, masks make inhale lungs get sick. discouraging knowing people parents. Sudden cardiac arrest fatal 95% time. lots arrhythmias blood flow problems valve issues normal people tent call heart attack. Lol too? whole bad faith gang here. would expect positive rates increase test less people testing restricted strongest symptoms.

Are test rates falling going up? get point. concerns though worst thing economy people returning work nobody going return work make less money make unemployed. perfect world getting paid making instead applying blanket $600 week everyone. I'm sure would difficult do. mention, costs government 100 billion month $600 per person alone. government already 20 trillion debt spent several trillion last stimulus package. breaking point government irresponsible long position continue spend like without serious repercussions future. like simpsons meme...

News: ""Highest record""

Govt.: ""Highest record _so far_"" sad might even see 100k+ case day within next month. avoidable. understanding contagious (aka effective entering target cells) deadly months ago....?

Still anything want trifle with.  donated blood got antibody test came back negative :(

Part wants get done would foolish might end hospital presumptive positive someone tested positive. considered confirmed positive tested second time comes back positive again. keep six feet away - there’s much concrete evidence effective masks (we still wear don’t hurt least might help), tons evidence six feet. It’s pretty clearly safer ten feet unmasked person one foot masked person mean, isn’t Make America Great Again? Bolsonaro en un Trump en potencia, tiene las mismas directrices que Trump en todo esto está acabando con el sistema de salud de Brasil Actually I’m 15 going 16, consider toddler anyone that’s age Kindergarten (5 years old) Also flawed logic this: get can't you? think covers work grocery deliberately coughed twice summer. creep behind I'm working time too, even try put hand sometimes. guy fingering tasting produce, getting slobber it. getting too. new talking point. like every one before, it'll proven false week two. they'll already next one. Yeah must right everything fine US big hoax. Contagious fatal two different attributes.

If really want science go /r/COVID19. Media notoriously bad interpreting science reports. Deaths still trending down

That lags due sick taking time die. Let's see still true week, states maxed ICUs like Texas. got argument today someone said USA numbers lie b/c India lot people fewer infections. tried explain ""Tests/1M pop"" stat meant grasp concept fewer tests = fewer positive cases. hearing deaths since memorial day even did, everyone opinions experts. 
 
But exactly 3 weeks memorial day started spikes cases. 4 weeks, huge spikes cases, records shattered states. pass record high set NY. 
 
5 weeks after? Well today broke 50k cases. 
 
So open eyes stop negative everything. enough people tested. previous posts added, tests performed hospitalized patients relatives. ALSO, quite hard get hospitalized, health system collapse: enough beds, supplies, etc. Adding this, said test results take long sent back patient/doctors, patient dies results received, CoD updated COVID-19, person included number victims.

But, yeah, people still believe virus real, infected taken hospitals PURPOSE, afraid getting sicker 'really' ill people hospitals. even stay hospitals weird conspiracy theory says people sent 'being killed'. Every time someone asked kind questions, always make feel uneasy directly you.

We tend forget obesed people got viral infections that's Covid, might die today. Obesity health condition yes kill you. Covid did. I'd say hurting. Relax. Mental health takes toll I'm Europe(amsterdam) oh boy seen Amsterdam days. packed. People partying aswell etc.

BUT nearly everything reopened aswell. restriction still social distancing doesnt get followed all. get enforced. Yeah spend Christmas alone tiny cold apartment I'll probably shoot getting another $1200 check? live Dallas suburb it’s like never problem - masks, distancing, like COVID never happened. I’m teacher kills think may meet new class via Zoom Correct! people realize ice cream bones. Dr osterholm talks beaches among safest places outside house. They’re fucking here. Close bars, gyms, offices, restaurants. people want pack lunch go beach, wearing masks choke points like parking lots, allowed. think contribute ethos non-compliance harm good dunno man Google it. Delco super compliant order too, tell followers driving nails coffin, he's selling hammers.

Every idiot running around proud wear mask looks stupider day, people seeing news reports data stack showing wear fucking masks observe reasonable public health wisdom we'd pretty much fine. matter much spin, never makes sense.

*We want open economy!*

**Okay, wear masks, able that.** 

*But would living fear!* 

**Okay, shitload people going die...** 

*China's fault!!!!!* Maybe people point process you, though. still get confused time time see someone make ""common mistake"" common enough mentioned anywhere language learning resources I'd seen. Maybe needs phrased way!

As mom ages (85), still sharp tack cognitively stubborn obstinate. Like adopted two cats last one disappeared I'm like ""Mom, stop letting outside! 4 last 5 cats never came home. went list cats growing since, Disappeared list 3 times long Stayed list. Either keep indoors stop adopting them.""

It seems older gets, blunt be. 🤷‍♀️ think they’re talking Alabama Europe parents get Yep. (Now, expand that.)

Laypeople tend use ""exponential"" mean ""really fast,"" really means rate increase proportional amount observed (y = k*y'), since exponential function derivative.

These show nature lot things grow population things reproduce. 1,000 animals one (on average) baby, soon going 2,000 animals. baby, 4,000 animals, 8,000.

So clear virus spread like this. sick person infects three others, new case number three times current case number. mistake . much time sub makes negative lol. 
most venues let postpone, cancel, date let reschedule date choosing already booked. i'm sure circumstances easy people spending exorbitant amount money wedding first place loved ones can't join share. what's point otherwise? wonder uncle uber driver. contagious severe exclusive. fact fairly common. agree retroactive hazard pay everyone working right now, even medical professionals. case mean unemployed deserve less financial support. Keep mind unemployed also health care benefits all.

That's crabs bucket logic. McDonalds corporate insanely strict hiring standards, unlike white house Wtf... already happening, people calling Wolf coward he's putting safety re-election someone knowingly something killed thousands people, give others purpose, die, least manslaughter murders? would say murder since intention involved. Yeah, I've stopped nice polite. They're literally willing spread deadly disease because, ""Muh rights!""

I'm done. I’ve seen many elderly going stores dine-ins without masks. Ya, young people good job helping contain spread, can’t put 100% blame us. one thing bothers me, talk young people death go IHOP Walmart without masks. wonder many people seem like coward...
Do think lot people really nervous ? Dude, thanks explaining things here. I'm actually Canadian myself, Vancouver. I've living Seoul since like 2008 I'm kind little bubble here. 

1. LOL Chinese people perfect docile communitarians. Yeah collectivism thing literally means opposite westerner would think collectivist. government rely sorts sneaky ways make act line. would say description (minus non human part) feels like South Koreans. working peaceful way save export driven economy government honestly lead scientific elite. Fucking handled shit like PRO. public official's side general resident's side. 
2. Horrifically abused repressed eh? gonna lie, family immigrated Canada damn fucking happy so. I'm glad happy Canadian every time visit homeland, people better better. lot people prospered China recent decades. wanna think China trash culture, hey man, everyone right think want. deny existence gigantic new middle class empowered literally government fallacy. like fallacy think parts population royally fucked government well. Like fuck, world black white.

Man, explained things me, glad pissed sides.

People china peacefully follow ""right"" thing wore masks compliantly. literally FORCED it. 

They started carefree attitude turned fear. Fear potential seriousness disease also fear government persecuted sick following rules. People fucking furious badly government handled things. hiding truth, long took delay action, draconian lockdown was. reacted like regular human beings. took rest world fucked people look back quite thankful strong law things. 

If West really wants attribute effective control coronavirus Asian culture, public acceptance poverb ""Spare rod, spoil child.""

Do government tells get smackdown. Straight gulag. It’s beyond comprehension ONE country nearly unlimited resources fuck something badly. utter failure America been. mean... raised thinking US one best countries live in, pandemic opened eyes. feel bad idiots affected :( poorly written headline. Thanks again! They're closing indoor dining, outdoor dining still allowed point? 

The general American populace arrogant, stubborn, stupid (or willfully ignorant) stop this.

You can't fix stupid can't save idiots themselves. 

I feel bad collateral damage people choice matter, statistically speaking Darwin Awards real time. inevitable consequence structural issues allowed fester U.S. society decades. addressed, one form destroyer innocent mouth-breather alike get swept away by. alcohol (and basically drugs matter) gets absorbed body quicker. really easy get alcohol poisoning idea much actually consuming. dumb.  nothing hurt sad man drinking whisky pickup faithful dog.

Seriously though, might put concert idiots chose attend. almost twice many cases Ireland total. one day. saying. Here's Miami-Dade's recent case/death charts.

Cases truly soaring. Deaths   Yep. shit. come Asian countries wearing mask day 1? Man 10 people saw shopping wearing masks sure followed well mexican tell without doubt, is... Oh made actually tear real life :’( It’s pretty rare super easy diagnose. I’ve seen one patient 20 years audiology. enforced? record Martin Eberhardt original co-founder CEO along Mark Tarpenning JB Straubel. Musk provided much needed financing help Roadster development think take least 3 weeks testing capacity. AZ spiraling control even hit 5k cases day yet limited testing. Last week finally days 17k tests conducted. brother got chicken pox one year old, developed shingles nine. would say it’s worth risk. government isn’t known giving power. fact expands it. 

Imagine second technology today 1980s. Contact tracing would definitely thing HIV/AIDS. think cops we’re protesting bullshit practices violate civil liberties wouldn’t taken opportunity enforce anti-homosexual laws place 1980s? 

What would police data now? Would go protest leaders? Would go gatherings 10 people? knows? 

The trust people state broken common sense science running common sense social awareness. relatives Georgia, Atlanta.

From they've told me, Georgia surge government holds back numbers. Selective testing. They'll always tell positives, many test.  Say ""today xxxxxx factory, two positive cases"".  tell factory tested eight people, instead entire thousand work there. Agreed. Buffalo here, cases lowest they've since pandemic started. course two week quarantine rule, honestly, people going entitled follow it, fear rest country going fucking ruin hard work getting somewhat control. Ohh okay thanks :) It’s 50% population it’s 50% tested. commented elsewhere chain, last paragraph sums transmissibility virulence often trade-off. Evolution higher transmissibility generally associated evolution higher virulence. Otherwise diseases would evolve avirulence. Legit, want wear mask stay home. simple. morons keep throwing whole ""my body choice"" shit back everyone. Except like... random woman Oregon aborting 3 week old embryo quite effect idk, all? dumb ass could infecting everyone else around you. 

These people literally walking bioweapons right now. ridiculous they're given much leash shit is, Trump one them. administration, even Bush, people would considered rare loon would immediately publicly shamed screamed left store Uber drivers deal nearly much wayyyy scared actually challenge status quo. reason feel God Emperor says can. 

I hope November changes things man... last 3.5 years fucking exhausting. Lol. mean, *now* said it, added words that, know, say it. Cool trick, writing. would virus need evolve spread faster stupid humans it? Hell, least one human president helping spread organizing gatherings.

Wear masks, practice good hygiene. Well mean go Alabama particularly well known academics best hospital, strong hospital, brave doctors. Guys, listen OP. *not* thought repetitive ranting seemed oddly familiar Inaccurate, real numbers easily 2x-3x reported. wear masks go bro, read title I’m sorry. skewed sounds disciplinary. title true, enforcing people wear mask isn’t constitutional government shouldnt power anything U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A! find from, people less respect ""pretty please"" things like this, I'm Texas. Texas Florida clearly under-diagnosing many deaths pneumonia instead COVID19, pneumonia numbers way historical average

Wasn't debunked myth? 5k pneumonia numbers include COVID purpose, double counted way purpose. mean counted COVID. “I think we’re gonna good coronavirus. think point that’s going to, sort of, disappear – hope,” 

No wonder US unable contain virus...our leadership completely touch reality. can't believe quote TODAY. getting extra $600 week would changed phone number. Could squeaked one check. test anti-maskers? know, since they're scared infection ""just flu"", right... Agreed. Mars, Seven Fields, Cranberry still wearing masks. anyone goes this, please AMA. least several questions anyone would gamble Corona see Vanilla Ice concert. There's 40,000 genomes virus since single genome December. know essential workers. one article. Spreading unsure supposition nothing positive. Check Nevada's latest case/death graphs. Cases truly soaring. Deaths however continue decline now:

 Yes forcefully mandatory catching means bullet head Thanks Captain Technicality. I'm sure tons readers confused. Schools open? starts Friday. Fortunately, test came back negative. Best wishes friend.  Oh right, probably reading another country's. infections then. I'll delet death section. Nailed yet, last week still Redditors messaging ""it's like flu"" me. idea confirmed daily new cases spiking daily new deaths dropping? theory... already done overseas. else going uncover previously undetected community transmission?  anyone find better explanation exactly means? exactly intend get bunch young people submit testing? expect someone show door shove test nose? Can't find decent information local national news reports. I'm sure owners hospital pocket 90% inflated revenue. Idea hospitals work general shit works US. almost like health care profit Transmissibility related number different things, selection pressure something else may influence it, especially strong selection pressure high transmissibility. 

For example, duration infectious period immunity might trade transmissibility. Many coronaviruses mild, catch year year. SARS, people recovered virulent cases kept immunity longer. risk bringing every people can't accept protests problem, feel justified actions wilfully ignore fact people die unnecessarily them.

You've got upvote I'm sure we'll negative territory long. yet major outbreaks southern California Bay Area, primarily blue regions.

But things reason spreading. They're densely populated areas destination spots people go recreation/leisure reasons.

There countless reasons virus spreading different areas. Making politics massive issue primary reason America biggest failure world right now. absolutely political effects taking appropriate action, would handled way handled. case problems issues country.

It's become much side versus side care problems solutions anymore. Literally anyone cares right side wrong, make absolutely progress anything result. Sociopaths. read title capacity, official policy hide severity pandemic, get tested positive private facility registered confirmed case, test positive asymptomatic registered confirmed case either, die get tested tested post-mortem either.



They started reopening economy cases even peaked, know peaked either 3 week backlog tests. AMLO's government criminally negligent. Doug Wilson preaching surprise me. technically falls old Reformed tradition. self-described ""paleo-Confederate"" thinks - wrote book League South co-founder Steve Wilkins - Black people lived happy racial harmony white slavemasters.

He also officiated wedding known pedophile, thinking married would cure pedophile. Needless say, not, pedophile went abuse child. 

I know he's done more, that's stomach remember now. could offer grand catch common cold take it.

Yeah that's bit weird. hate colds I'll take cold 4 digits cash. like $200 pass. actually 6% 60% domestic tourism. Stop making shit up. 🔥

Edit: gonna need ice ice baby burn. Right poorer countries deaths would expect looking infection rate. Deaths won’t even indirectly tell us case numbers bc that. Sounds like work dow  lie. Every inch country completely lunatic. outside southeast escaping anything inside accent. chiffon. That's works. CA, TX FL also populated states

. California: 49 million

Texas : 29 million

Florida 22 million

NY 19million

Everyone else 13 million less... Good god! realtor investor? scary. heard declared 0900 1 active case 0930 back 0.  I'm Midwest assumed Multiplication Taco fire taco chain available west coast. even visualized secret menu, like animal style n lol HOLY SMOKES fair, overflow capacity 102% matter much. 

That said. Come fuck Texas. Wear god damn mask, close fucking bars dine areas, move curbside retail.

There's need shut everything down, bare minimum shut downs going eventuality. No. America politicized science much peer reviewed research done lawyers, doctors, engineers, etc, gets ignored doesn’t fit narrative.

This country doomed. saying government wanted steal knee fluids people that's killing them. 

I can't even fathom people believe that. abbot PCR. shitty cycles, amplify less. points numbers mean anything Trump administration anymore. said increaseing testing, less testing means less cases. It’s pronounced Mos-coe. corrected many times lived road, started saying Moskva. That's it. Oh shit
Smart Ironically, Americans hope Trump. really shocked brutally Danish state, emergency laws, fines waiting bus infringement civil liberties.

Don't forget Danish employers threaten fire employees going Sweden, even though allowed go Sweden. forward seeing brigade show downvote defend one, claim somehow Sweden's fault. \+1. people giving negative votes posed uncomfortable thought. something worth thinking about. Yes agreed. Better late never I’m honestly curious feel way. mind explaining? mean... also looking medical staff work double shifts without taking masks able perform duties without respiratory problem give indication masks AFFECT BREATHING RemindMe! 4 weeks

(To give time jump twice.) Someone ought sue endangerment reckless manslaughter (don't know correct English..) brain power learn another another language money leave United states might it. Unfortunately failing Spanish Italian shown I'm stupid another language So, excess death rate per 1000 population .0004.

Can imagine +.0004 change [the historical death rate per 1000 would look like?

(Hint: goes something like 8.6000 8.6004.)  daily megathreads become chorus monkeys chanting ""2 weeks!"" over. hard believe? powerful countries people screwed enough/refuse something protect lives, mean Malaysia citizens stupid enough same. Deuces, assholes. Okay, that's awesome. I'd already bought stretch chiffon.

There's stretch velvet that's identical weave/feel back, also 90 Poly/10 Spandex I'm trying out. cotton filters small fibers wonder stretch velvet serve dual purpose, velvet side worn outside mask thicker poly/spandex backing providing amount regular stretch info!   Whole buncha unfounded hopium here. started nervously laughing. likely wrong, I'd recommend ask recent memes, improved time. probably expenses paid vacstion slave labor camps family.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Neither public health officials day care regulators previously reported outbreaks day cares, declined multiple requests Oregonian/OregonLive week quantify cases, saying information would released young age group nearly caught infection totals among Oregonians ages 80 over, group likely die COVID-19. feel like, yes, mentality plague many delusional people, special issue younger people exactly *are* lower risk. irony disease makes group wants go most/doesn’t usually want face consequences also likely survive infection... well, it’s perfect storm.

RIGHT PEOPLE AREN'T! STILL HOAX THEM!

Those deaths right residual cases back quarantine. deaths new infections weeks months. Now, younger age patients deaths likely, right? good care doctors. 
Now imagine even QUARTER 50+ cases needed hospitalisations. once. tf care them? started rise Texas' biggest hospital already 100% occupancy. still want chill ? Call people causing hysteria??
Countries lockdowns double digits 50k governments beginning SUGGESTING wear masks told galaxy brains nothing could done, everyone act individually, else companies going do, people ""scared"" dont fly.

It'll fun thread, decide show up. 2020 pneumonia deaths came form downloading [this provisional death count data set, straight sorting state, summing pneumonia deaths Georgia weeks 2/1 6/1. adds 2525.

What's baseline? [CDC wonder state Georgia, demographics, ICD-10 113 cause list J12-J18 (pneumonia), years 2009-2018.

So right full shit, full shit I. America alone that. Sadly friends far south President like ours. sorry excuse President Jair Bolsonaro Brazil.  underrated rapper around.

And don’t mean rated higher.  wonder even bother testing people hospital really. Surely point they're dieing observe symptoms assume covid-19. 


I'd love hear worlds stats people displaying covid-19 symptoms rather confirmed tests mean mask order state nobody enforcing comes point end Also treatment getting better. Example Dexamethasone getting used widely. hearing weeks. Ahhhh, makes sense. Can't tell worldometers Yes, blame China United States' horrible handling pandemic. productive too, citizens US able influence China's policy unable influence internal policy. Yep. embarrassing is, people deserve praise respect kindness. Outside capital city, lots Mongolians live poverty nomads/gatherers (there's forests almost proper agriculture, deserts steppes). Lots Mongolian men risk losing lives inside illegal coal mines - feel brave enough, see looks like eyes (TL;DR journalist gives camera Mongolian man, man slides down). 2020 half way, course is. Jared play dumb Tool song mentions ""Arizona Bay"" Trump thought serious? Come think it, probably runts eating tide pods.  ""Today"" worldmeters seems 5pm PST 5pm PST. end matter great deal long day consistent. makes great sense. doesn’t make sense originated China since China eradicated virus back March. I’m guessing originated nation unfriendly ties China. country friendly ties China would’ve listened Great wisdom Chinese authorities could imported case. I’m guessing came somewhere leadership decided defy wisdom Chinese authorities misguided belief that, reason, Chinese government doesn’t best interest mind. That’s like hooker saying it’s suggested wear condom. Ahh damn Bobby. mention implemented Movement Control Order pretty early. fair, making unemployment made employed little fucking wonky. America nobly sacrificing serve example rest world handle pandemic. Thank president trump! provinces reporting today, Alberta one reporting currently seeing third highest number cases (less 100, still significant Canada's total count) NY closed weeks peak. comparing thing. Though right testing great start sure stats truly mid March NY things closed. You’ve clearly either experienced adversity (because would understand concept ability “rise above” takes resources, determination, bit luck without three it’s functionally impossible), sociopath (because seem zero ability empathize). Rural PA definitely issue. FuckZuckCuckBook™ I’ve literally started driving reading Allentown grocery shop. Amazing people one county 1000% civilized. course Hamburg, pretty much inbred capital world you’ve ever been. Ha ha. great comment. human point view 1.1% IFR across large number infected people catastrophic. virus point view completely trivial, especially takes long die. Lol, fact even issue make us embarrassed. Also.. child sized masks?  agree, hope sooner later. don’t speak freaky deaky Dutch unfortunately. saaaayyyy????? might PhD, comment replying anonymous account internet. I'm really sure believe here. No, place around Traverse City. matter? point it’s frustrated people trying play blame game. big difference protest bar bar exists day day basis whereas protests ended there’s really nothing do. What, supposed punished something? agree protests weren’t bright idea. blaming protests surge statistics don’t back seems partisan me. Might well blame police triggering protests. Wait, ones that? live particularly conservative area found laughable bunch people didn’t believe coronavirus suddenly big believers social distancing. real question is, scared angry environment seeing country, couldn’t cops resist pointlessly slaughtering someone. know bad idea 8 minutes think it. protests reaction logically must blame source blame protests. it? feel like I've seen quite people Reddit talking loose tubes.

Maybe meant different tubes. worry, urbanites Pittsburgh dont fucking care either. need go back shelter place course wont gotta go myrtle beach get work drink (yes idiot threw fit able stop afterwork drink record reclose bars). lockdown, maybe. 


But hear, people lockdown, question ""where last 5-7 days, symptoms started?"" could long list... way around? funny.

Study says lots people dying coronavirus.

You claim, no, they're dying stress economy.

I point historically economic stress led massive spikes short-term death rates.

You shift ""well proof people dying COVID-19!""

At point, like proverbial man shooting guy chest Fifth Avenue, later dies hospital. worse that: care murder, get angry people say bullet killed shift suggesting perhaps victim's stress getting suit bloody caused heart stop beating. victim even wearing suit. feds planning force people get tested?  done times (spend Christmas alone). call IM, bearable. really old. post it? Mexican secretary government promoting supplement made 'citric nanoparticles' claiming need wear facemask taking those.


The president took 19 hour car ride Yucatan want forced wear facemask plane, pandemic started telling people stop going hug other.  Good luck filling fights countries going ban travel US. actually common sense countries. 70% people South Korea wearing masks end February day 100 cases since end March.

Unfortunately ""experts"" U.S. advised people wearing masks beginning fear people would resort hoarding would cause major shortages healthcare workers. 

It obvious people wearing masks good idea April. 87% people Italy said wore masks everytime went outside, mid-April. three times many cases U.S. Mid-March. took one month realize masks good idea. 

Sources:
[South Korea small group self-destructing. Oh ok. Thank Better test everyone might come contact someone does. valid firearm license forbidden wearing mask public carrying weapon.

So choose wear mask carry firearm.

By passing law requires people something prohibits carrying firearm, violating Second Amendment. actual order you’re interested. Short answer headline misleading, masks required businesses outdoors (parks) can’t maintain physical distance. Australian barley/beef got fked, yet U.S. media saying ""oh yeah China added tariff Aussie farm product covid investigation""......... brother, thinks child country go school shingles bad?!?!?  Come on, shingles sucks it’s bad. got prison burglarizing neighbors house? Whitmer took part protest march, acceptable you? part think people understand tge virus, tbh. Well best intrest mean jack Healthcare costs miles red tape beauracracy, yes. wait raise premiums pay care. since insurance companies big fail, probably throw em bone treasury too.  driver too! Lucky me, lives close get driver, too. he’s one hasn’t worn mask me. would close eyes? Countries across world shutting cities find cases, yet worried mass testing going inflate case number? Give break. Test trace now. saying since February. ready rebellion. many kids died covid19? hehe, tried. end defeated....

Have good night thanks laugh. Unfortunately are. I’m waiting hear schools county. “3 day country music festival“ masks used.

Yup live NY Meadville area. NW PA general seems 50/50 best visiting last week talking friends family still live . anti mask movement strong. employed, need snatch PTO days advance, sometimes far advance. get it. Pull hair n call Karen sudden everyone’s Christian wants go church. Praise Jesus! Indeed. Texas situation. We’re short testing capability part state (the capitol, Austin) mostly testing people appointment symptoms lines cars around block. 40% tests today positive. Bwahahahahahahahaha!!!! Thanx, needed laugh. Health insurers America give fuck fleecing public much money can. new, goes back decades.....""Do right thing""....???? Fucking funny..... really matters multiple vaccines therapies worked on. like throwing handful darts 🎯 becoming apparent government give fuck American lives....it's almost they're trying kill us deaths going lag though, death rises come infection rises, give weeks. Scary ☹️ So? Traditional Chinese numbering 10^4 (""wan""), follow global standard 10^3 numbering. afraid wear mask need stay home  spending night Pensacola work, knew Florida going disaster. Folks acted Pandemic never existed. masks anywhere everyone stared wore one. understand question. simple. wear mask public, worthless piece shit go jail.

It's simple, could never enforce that. Police want spend time walking around looking it, they'll never respond calls it, relies somebody reporting -- stop family friend picnics happening mask-less (which reading lot mass outbreaks happening). mutation reported March Europe mutation basically effect, one affects reproduction virus. actually don’t fucking clue you’re trying say entirely different area. Unfortunately around 10 cases fucked opening bars go do? reciprocal effect people see infection rate go again. going explode, said, people still respectful enough stores wear masks. That's social norm.

The good thing seeing masks worn they're contact. Family/friend contacts tend insular isolated than, say, bars stores. stupid cunt since mandatory event, attended President Trump. PEOPLE FED  commonly request colleague animals become aware exist.

SHOW KITTY Excellent example template current administration US. Time party! That's point. Different people different conventions.  Bone apple tea Yeah... I'm dfw It’s frustrating, people like dad think wearing mask make look ‘stupid’. Would rather others die?

Pick source trust. hundreds articles detailing Italians ""suggestions"" distance, pretty much entirely ignored. us selfish follow suggestions change behavior. we're lockdown people needlessly dying. Ya Wisconsin got opened wide open sudden. Recently counties closing bars etc. voluntarily. Yeah, would paying attend online. I’d take year waste time. plenty societies existed, currently exist, greed nonexistent, concept personal ownership loose best. Problems arise demand beings outstrip supply given good service. pretty good exploration concept, honestly pretty good film general, watch ""The Gods Must Crazy.""  ask him, that's J stands Donald J Trump. thought could get mansion places texas fraction West Coast. exceptions dallas fw austin guess Ah sorry, Saint Simon’s Island, Georgia. AFAIK it’s worse end spectrum. I’ve saying since beginning too. catastrophe first foremost anchored deep failure education system, particularly last thirty years I’d say Color Confederate flag become new favorite saying. Bless you. assess risk every day driving work. It’s COVID. course, contagious factor, I’ll part limiting spread. personally age health realize likely die car crash COVID.  certainly countries performing better others. countries best generally implemented mandatory masks, great contact tracing infrastructures testing high rates. Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea Japan lead charge. Australia, Germany, Iceland Canada also done well.

The US things adequately.

This article covers different responses different countries pretty well:

 rule schools public? We’re month away hitting fan. state basically holding gun head yelling everything fine.

Not unexpected Florida. Yeah America first! Told people know are! Sometimes wish Darwin still around witness this. guy probably somersaults grave now.  Lowest level thinks Arguing people economy opposite forces

No one arguing understand analogy. Waivers work! Results six weeks..... I’m tired repeating honestly. amazing day 👍 keep expecting it, hasn’t happened. Fortunately haven’t pulled yet. don’t think correction hard. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* USA large, deaths per million must include places far New York City, like California Texas. deaths per million higher around NYC, lower places; deaths per million entire USA goes include places USA. contrast, Italy large, include Germany Poland part Italy.  Florida = stupid Maybe shouldn’t make title misleading many people see face coverings political issue. It’s bullshit. like American indeed first They're jerks too. ""If afraid, stay home."" Gee thanks. repercussions! love country /s Obviously whatever fans attending morons.. venues allowed hosting events?! I'm sure, recall reading older folks holding onto properties they're living longer able stay healthy age. study gave us who....the what.........but man. Pretty important virus much worse places others. Randy Rainbow could great job it! need new character called Coronavirus People problem rushing bars middle pandemic things reopened. work Security Police Department Texas full mask policy, even allowed drive work vehicles without mask on. He’ll dropping new joint dry hack, old favorite dead grams. Similar me. started 2000 ISP tech support, think made $11/hour. Worked non profits while, probably left sooner. I’m bank make 3 times much started out, bank also great benefits pay phone. it’s doable without specific education, takes get work experience.  EU locked internal country boarders. 

Actually going let go said OK. attitude went mild indifference complete indifference last exchange, hiding.  telling people stay home instead building great beaches weekend! Imagine fucking stupid. Okay Floridaman. Congrats! Eventually either work way populace vaccine made. fuck ton Americans die in-between. remember embarrassed even partner would walk background. everyone introducing families pets, lounging shorts tshirt, even openly drinking alcohol meetings. love change before. They'd need perform like 500-750k tests single day Depends. get GED you’re lazy genius legitimately issues prevented/interfered completing high school? former, probably not. latter, need Iq test make sure you’re right (well, left really) side bell curve. History wont nice Americans regards pandemic. Thanks, I'll talking wife trying this! Compound interest cases They're fining people $250 violating mandate.  [Bing Theres many god damn bots website. sure dont bot spot bots like Twitter does. Mn chiming - even rebuilding city riots, id chip dimes keep Wisconsin inside Wisconsin. best turn Florida 3rd world nation. ya says W Trump. Wonder Got 10k kits. course big state pop?-wise. stats never consider that. Due testing (Swedish source) 

 
Week 22: 36 466 tests, Week 26: 75 151 tests. Also see Figure 1 (Figur 1). 


The increase confirmed cases mild cases (They need hospitalization). Source (Swedish again).  
 

See figure/graph. Lime green ""Lindriga""/mild purple Allvarliga/Serious. 


How Patients ICU beds? (Swedish source sorry):  
The diagram (middle right) ""Nya intensivvårdade fall per dag"" ""new patients ICU per day"".  


Bottom right diagram ""deaths per day""/Avlidna per dag.

You could also see numbers 

There 124 patients ICU, 67 patients less week ago.

&amp;#x200B;

Is over? No,not yet, numbers declining since mid April. increase new cases due testing 26+. confirm. American, hurts, it’s excellent example fucked thinking right now.  Doesnt include hey let's stick positive COVID patients bunch people high chance dying COVID old. exponentially worrying net increase accurate... +21,947 new confirmed cases, India set new record today, smashing previous record (+20,131) significant margin. Things continue getting worse, faster, rather better. people still using argumemt? Around 34k deaths flu US 2018. halfway year least 130k people died this. again... could comment reading article. course blame title 🙄 Maybe death count severely lagging behind pretty good numbers. Canada peaked 207 deaths May 1st average 1800 new cases week prior. works point making then. okay, great. Remember started asking someone would compare state country, response inquiry comparing per capita statistics. couldn’t explain would be, stated, inaccurate. churches need exist

But church services reformatted. found solution via videoconferencing. Others use drive-in theater approach car speakers parking lot. there's will, (safe) way. Italy testing more, they'd also cases study posted couple days ago showed link viral load severity illness.

Typically mutation become contagious accompanied lower fatality. number 1, number 1, number 1. Wooooool look countries followed science. ones stayed lockdown longer, stricter, mask public policy, national test, trace quarantine system place. far better us. It’s exactly told would happen. leader literally put hands ears threw tantrum. doomed day 1 administration charge. I'm sure trump please he's breaking records like movie interstellar touches close black hole 25 years later gets back ship. Yeah, 47 years seems right. surprised? No. I've many arguments sub, lost count number posters I've blocked. worth try convince anyone who's mind set works. like bad women's anatomy. Maybe sub bad COVID information? Thank you. Would rather see information like opposed results testing people. Another pandemic solved couch. long run, things looking good modernity... don’t judge deadliness disease many people won’t experience symptoms — judge percentage cases result fatality.

And call Covid “un-deadly” 125,000 dead months patently false. understand words individually within context thread reads like caca I... realized old people die social security run lifetime like everyone says will.

That's true master plan behind this. Thanks - blend together sometimes. Yeah banks get trouble get bailed US government, remember 2008? Classic Pittsburgh UK citizen, wholeheartedly agree sentiment. Ach, Im sure know, miraculously disappear. It’s even fuck would ever want get sick purposefully? act like aren’t young people icus young drs given lives pandemic. fuck okay bombard health system? Disney union run Goofy. UK trial already looked safety, UK citizens. think advanced later phases without first? like UK - Brazilian - trials drug tested aspects vaccine sneakily left safety part Africans. too. result idiots leadership positions, elected idiots made idiots lack education due leaders putting money education healthcare system properly. Now, lack education resulting ignorant people refusing social distance wear masks country another surge, pretty much reset march. rate accelerating quickly, positives is, wouldnt surprised end july getting 100K day like Fauci speculated days ago. Hopefully rate drop, even states stabilizing quite well, rates increasing. Since worlds Remdesivir (no idea spelled right, likely not) supply least good chance cutting serious cases, also Hopefully. lost first covid-19 war guys, time get vengeance, wear masks, stay home much can. weapon thing, cant depend government needs done People need pick masks put one Every time go out. stop, least anytime soon... Disney cautious. takes hell lot time effort re-open others.

Profit wise making nothing. parks operating 15% capacity, hotels capped 20%. people go passholders DVC members already paid year. 

They wont turn profit parks least remainder year, longer. Remember whole Europe blocked flights US. summer tourism traid gone. New York City like bajillion people die though? Watch, virus jump gators Health insurance companies make money, hospitals.

Hospitals hurt this, benefitting. hate pink eye! work around construction pandemic started clients installed hand washing stations work crews. construction water used stations came large containers explicitly said ""non potable.""  Guess happened next? guessed it! Everyone got pink eye. started called stations pink dispensers. Fun times. get it, fear COVID-19, getting pinkeye walk around full face respirator time. Rip sweet baby 💔 trust data? one US welded homes. lockdown. Glad country better, say beat virus astounding amount hubris, thee virus gone anywhere yet country still risk like rest them. idiot award goes to...... Florida emphasize DUH 🙄 Well either protests lead spike social distancing BS It’s bad time American. beaches Phoenix suck. Mouse give shit lot people going one 😂 gonna lot confused people now. Interested seeing reactions.  Covid-19 top ropes!

Bah gawd wrestler family! Yiu're thinking pre-potter, run down, old crappy rides universal. busy enough building 3rd full day park became viable. Took long enough. think people truly conceptualize million dead bodies look like. 

Hard Rock Stadium Miami hold 64,000 people. We're talking filling 15.5 Hard Rock Stadiums body bags. pretend political (middle road), beyond ""parties"". living literal nightmare. Employees tested + Florida epicenter COVID + + Plans reopening. could go wrong? they're 5 cents each, I'll wear them, thanks. I’m avoiding question. I? answer fatality rate?

If 450/1000 people don’t show symptoms (and don’t die), affects fatality rate bringing fatality rate down. 

The fatality rate seems 0.5-1%. Vaccine distributed anywhere near year. get miracle cure created proven effective safe 2020 (we won't) long take get 328 million? get enough people take order reach herd immunity (70ish%, won't) 
 
I humanity disease, somehow managed shoot already low expectations. True. still keep distance even mask on. wish Americans would realize patriotic thing 4th July stay home household. Texas stereotypical Texas everywhere except Austin Dallas Houston pretty much populated cities dude spitting facts care feelings Americans say “fauci bad, clementine looking hobbit good” fucking disgrace.  Yeah, people got caught selling passport copies purpose, would get big trouble, doubt many would risk it. motherfucker desperate climb polls he’s actually going give governance shot. Great! Stop resisting arrest! 

Johnson, sprinkle crack him. He's busy Heck yea. 
Florida cases Europe combined. Florida wins! time trade 33 big macs baby N95 masks *at least* 95% effective. manufacturer bother figure exactly effective (that would take ridiculous amount QA) say 95% safe. Also takes single droplet getting infect you, otherwise hospital workers would 100% now

We also need reduce transmission 100%. enough bring R0 1 hospitalizations area spiked correlation number confirmed cases. prompted local hospitals put statement telling public spike *is not* simply effect testing, please vigilant ICU capacity COVID patients three local hospitals climbed 70%. guess plans move Florida finally live sun year round won’t happening. *slowly wipes away tears, clenches fists looks forward stern resolve*

“This time. . . time, Coronavirus, you’ve gone far.” zero soon, like miracle. lot numbers came today. Unemployment LOT, US markets booming. Don’t surprised virus mutates reports raising living dead go viral lol. made decision finally. 6 months later. two parents picture... I'm sure else explain you.

If contagious two days, spread people would LESS contagious five days. I'm asymptomatic 2 days spread 3 people, I'm still contagious I'm asymptomatic 5 days spread 2 people.

That's last comment I'll leave here, either stupid understand basic math arguing argumentative. Let's forget you, Dr. Fauci, ilk absolutely, positively refuse suggest American people way boost immune systems. get high mighty smart wise stupid states slow locking down. supposed know better. supposed know high levels vitamin would help squelch epidemic. hero me. bum me. Shame you.  Yup Universal already open bout infections amongst staff. Disney even going testing (hence unions refusing come back). work. Florida full crazy evangelicals think masks Mark Beast something.

I think general disbelief much freedom much military power, American patriots told stay home mask enemy can't see kill hunting rifle. That's funny argument, also mean anything besides pure nudism goes ""God's intended bodily form humans? "" Just... why?  10-20% people become hospitalized. 5-10% get IC. 2-4% die. pretty easy estimafe amount people actually become infected every day respirators anything anything?

It's flu. Get it, get immunity, get back work. handful deaths acceptable alternative is, well, horseshit. Knowledge power friend! Wasnt trying hate letting know! Thanks reporting ground. Please delete account. don’t like trump either give credit it’s due. disputing claim, see single person applauding Florida non-actions, see ton people predicting Florida winding exactly result non-actions.  bah God that's 'Rona's music! America Florida world, feel. 

But Florida Florida America. “The mutation Los Alamos researchers wrote affecting specific amino acid, authors report wrote. mutated variant known D614G.”

From article, is, fact, D614G mutation. $$$ comes back study hasn’t peer-reviewed. r/theydidthemath post written LaTeX. Totally coincidence cases surged Houston Massive protests. previous mandate almost same, directed toward businesses. simply doubling it, directing individuals well. Well morons moron. problem morons listen moron. lot morons gonna sorry. It’s mix. friend went day 8 weekday - one car. Another friend went evening another night, said 3 4 people masks car. think people avoiding public transit eventually folks return work, harder do. Cheers dog didn’t symptoms, tested? testing vet appointments? owner test positive prior? idea, Denmark *seem* shortage, least I've never seen/heard reading ton. Norway seems somewhat one, obvs COVID related. 

But yeah, many HCWs Sweden burning quitting (or thinking things get better) least *somewhat* pandemic related. don’t trust want receive care doctors detach emotionally situations *should* upset what’s going on. Sorry ""left wing"" key term COVid-19. Mask studies didn’t focus single disease. many viruses spread effectively regardless face masks. Covid particular effectively controlled use face masks. Data supports cannot believe conversation needed. also said 2nd wave hit every country harder Sweden fine. looks like Sweden one vulnerable 2nd wave.. That's second wave nobody seems understand aerosol spread, like flu measles. spreads low humidity, low UV conditions. Indoor air conditioning outdoor cloudy low humidity weather. cases informative. exponentially tests taking place.  also quite critical Sweden's handling, critical extents Swedes go defend country's image. really bizarre. Swedish posters made lot claims debunked time, latch something else elicit praise instead. basic practice regardless transmission vectors. But...I need go work, job doesnt suck pay read past headline? Yeah also diabetic, usually worry much virus running low able keep anything down. Happened years ago realized getting sick took correction dose insulin sent low symptoms started soon after. fun trying get blood sugar keeping anything down. Survivorship bias real. Yeah, could underlying pre-existing condition know bad case. good idea every kid this. see reasoning. Kill immediately Explain liked telling people wear bandaids. “If put one might touch wound could get infected!!” Please explain then, 300 positive cases children day cares Texas Great! marked good news! 


Yes, many countries shortage, e.g. Russia coerce students work even red areas.  Many starting exhibit cardiovascular damage recovering even minor cases. 

You don’t wear mask, stay away people then. wearing mask person knowingly increasing chance illness everyone come contact with, increases probability people contracting it, people wear mask. 

People masks taking point, taking follow reasonable minority inconveniencing protocols.if cool living idea could helped didn’t, go right ahead, could come back haunt parents, kids, friends, kids, get sick suffer long lasting side effects. Norway done quite good, 40% higher deaths per capita Czechia required masks (not difference). Really?

I mean 0 freeze, 100 boils, seems pretty nice me,

Fahrenheit nice ? Patrick. first wave definitely started lol  Italy hardly testing back then. hard use today's numbers compare numbers March.  Italy's actual number people infected significantly higher actual number people infected California today. Along numerous factors (mostly younger people, maybe less deadly strain virus, better treatment) course warrants enough tell stfu. 

Look I’m fing expert modern Chinese read articles. 


S.T.F.U. actually what's happening - neighbours clubbed together rotational toddler watching.  mask wearing Mexico? weekend people get smashed yell USA USA USA! #SpotAnotherAltRightSheep New record every day, post week. It’s getting spammed point.  Wait didnt school college go online? think nothing Texas surprise anymore.. sense, news may also correlate increase cases. Many (most) work places covid-safe areas. Unless WFH covid risk increases dramatically work indoors. Tough situation around.  Death covid pretty rare, **but lifelong complications aren't.**

Citation needed. Funny thing English Bibles traditionally translate ""carpenter"", original Greek much general, could carpenter, tinkerer, even ""tech guy"". think immune virus now?  workers working Norway arriving Sweden mean Sweden exports cases? mean import cases. matter got infected. couple thousand protestors per state compared millions millions Americans stuffing every indoor gathering space find, every day. Estimated 70% covid, US 200 million people. think term ""community spread"" means cases known connection cases. long existing cases traced back specific traveller arrived carrying virus, say zero ""community spread"". outbreaks happen, tend clusters. one person got sick, would spread friends family often demographic. hard compare stats general population cluster type event since people tend congregate spread similar groups. Sure, here’s answer. KiDs bAd selling imported salmon? want completely frightened watch yuri bezmenov lecture back 80s YouTube. 💯the Russians hand this. Watching video 2020 like watching fortune teller tell future. Scary. There's huge difference gathering outside masks demand civil rights upheld, throwing party hundred people house. know right?! would dipping toe immunity passports they've CLEARLY ~~lied~~ stated going herd immunity? 'Tis mystery. It’s not. large surges states opened early. DC nonstop protests month spike numbers. Wearing masks outdoors isn’t risky going restaurant bar wearing mask. border closures *were* racist made ineffective. horrifying. understand system overwhelmed doctors make calls like this. blame doctors. blame officials seeing deciding stronger steps need made prevent cases like happening. half mad Queen stealing Vanilla Ice. Buddy, 20 dead children couldn’t prompt real change gun laws, doubt dead kids “already sick” going prompt much anything. country fucked priorities. see news countries?

That, think, mean say “this America”.

Yes. might outlier cases, kinda disregard science factual information, entitlement “freedom” safety others, overall petty behavior exclusive Americans. I’m taking opinion. 
She sharing article contents I’m making opinion based tells happening there. 
Not ideal, probably warranting telling shut fuck up. hell know live side country texas everyone acting like doesnt exist partying also one affected states talking positive death correct? believe delay poster referring death date reported. Ice Ice Baby Go Ninja Go Ninja loop hour? yawn  Please avoid reposting info. front page yesterday. Thanks. Yeah. shit. hearing say ""very rare"" negate anything. know viruses spread test positive. go rare case. 

It's rare cross street get hit car, experts agree, looking ways crossing greatly reduce chances dying. look ways, multiple times, even can't hear see threat. Yeah agree could rationally control spread disease, would better. downsides even young people get critically ill long-term damage it, pointed nearly impossible behave responsibly, give infection people. It’s name “futures”. stock market largely invests according believe near future 3-6months look like. 

It’s honestly riskier normal times due virus people corps probably optimistic functional vaccine one 6 months take us situation. lockdown testing contact tracing social distancing wearing mask works people respect rules. strictly state wide enforce fill jails breathing “biological weapons” around. person deliberately endanger entire community don’t see choice locking (dont wanna even give he/she corona like symptoms goes around without ppe thinking hoax). forget America exceptionalism listen foreign experts say masks help. mandatory IQ test comes covid-19 testing.

You could still idiots pass test. Sure, LT.Gov list? concerned 12 fans showing up? people wearing masks, yet, that's primarily businesses requiring it. Every day work still see moving masks chins, moving talk, leaving around necks think looking. Yeah people suck. thought werent going herd immunity ?!?!?!? :P shortage compare countries? doubt change drastic pre virus vs now. feel like, society wide sense, personal responsibility myth. 21 year old friend family member going party would yell idiot personal responsibility. entire country worth people behave similarly destructive way - feel like better reaction asking motivations pressures could pushing many people make exact mistakes. Shit attempt trolling guess need male too? ""provided 'he' acknowledge existence Supreme Being."" like easter, mother's day memorial day!

oh wait... requires enzymes simply exist coronavirus. 

Don't exist... yet.

In seriousness, I'm aware implausible is. cracking joke constantly seems surprise us new feature every weeks so. scary thing even actual number new cases could 500k day new infections doubt lack punctuation hindered ability parse message

What point lock that? news. Everyone pretty much assumed since day 1. world wearing them. “shitting average American”. pointing fact that, Americans (not average) tend kinds personality traits

I'm sorry no, phrase America explicitly indictment country whole. that's view fine, disagree, can't told words mean something don't. reference Gambino know context. Stoopid Californians.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* data scientist, looked data. Here's thing remember study like this. predicted baseline mortality number that, prediction.

This study show (nor purport show) 27k unexplained deaths.

The study *predicts* many deaths *should* 12ish week period, subtracts many actually had, compares difference amount reported COVID cases.

The study *suggests* death toll substantial undercount. think anyone kind 4 year STEM degree, larger education background, able read signs want catch spread it. Even prove wrong, better safe sorry.

Also right robotics! Big fan field fellow engineer! Everything money, except people short-sighted. Reopening early money? AZ closes again. Guess what? Even bigger loss money. using system =/= cheaters. Yea compared everyone else - cheaters. Yeah, agreed! mean part freaking whole Sweden thing imo Nordic Model appears collapsing Sweden. Thankfully seems alive well Nordics, Sweden tbh seems unraveling seams turning anglo-saxon model ""InDIVidUAl ReSPonSIbiLITY"" hilarious considering rules rules rules Sweden always one (see [this editorial hilarious take COVID response different Swedish rule loving ), importantly collectivist focused good whole society historically bin. seems tossing later part trash least terms COVID response deeply also similar dynamic played around world too, competent countries leading way provided massive image boost region. example, Korea &amp; Taiwan saved Asia's reputation China debacle, Australia &amp; NZ saved Anglo image Canada kinda saved North American PR US bungled badly, think everyone ignoring Canada tbh...

Excellent points usual! tbh totally shocked Australia's great response happy PROVE one fiercely individualistic anglo saxon countries suppress virus. Sure...just pointing want precise cfr, one needs go back bit.

Also, even w/ increased testing, still miss lot cases, even though derive precise cfr, ifr still pretty nebulous. Also, data coming lot people fight w/ cells rather antibodies. mind serological studies even precise we'd like. Gotcha, thanks clarifying. seems though, virus doesn’t seem affecting animals, least current news/optics. ass garden speak of. excerpt:

No, all. be.

""But want outsource parenting children public schools, waaah!""

No. One parent works; parent stays home raise children. things done across humanity 1960s society started going rails.   animal sudden onset neurological illness, progressed quickly matter days, health officials said. say something untrue? I'm Mexican, seen life, culture know shit proper nutrition, we've hardest hit everybody boat. one, debating another. COVID definitely stopped baby number two. vaccine hopefully next year 18 months, spouse wrong side 35 can’t risk that. 

Besides, knows we’ll able keep jobs. enough cover food housing—-but healthcare? SIL currently paying COBRA 1200 MONTH health insurance, including deductibles. Plus certain party successful eliminating ACA, pre-existing conditions come back! It’s fucking awful. want say good beacuase asthma fun thing I'm happy virus. hope get well soon long term issues! Here’s something fruitlessly point dummies; roughly 21% O2 contained room air, absorb 3% breath. mouth-to-mouth resuscitation works; exhaling O2 inhale. Since use small amount O2 inhale anyway, mask interfere intake oxygen. Even mask blocked half oxygen inhaled, doesn’t, you’d still need less half anyway. God can't imagine must feel, faux outrage stupid shit watch country loves destroyed somebody pure spite. Every time go buy groceries see people wearing masks, ignoring social distancing parties backyard. I’m pretty sure it’s going come back, give time. scrolling Reddit 3 posts graph Trump's approval rating. guess saw decided change tune. nothing Fauci make people trust scientific community. enormous distrust already existed Fauci ever said anything think amount introspection help convince types people taking heed. know, could leader backing Fauci every step way, encouraging base set example mask wearing social distancing, instead he's [Fox hit pieces Fauci fit narrative virus big nothing burger return normal. retarded totally politicized achieve agenda? political leaders continue ignore scientist, virus perpetuate ad nauseam, we'll never get economy back normal.  Good luck life buddy :) Ahhhh, cap city mall believe. That's side river aka ""white shore"". I've lived whole life besides left college magic dwindles me, least people wear masks here. unexpected shows every thread like Letterkenney Always Sunny's ""implication"". Kind you, reports spreading earlier that. sea shining sea I’ve already accepted new world. It’s time stop denial... Day camp. like chicken pox parties, get Covid summer dont worry school starts again? 

I mean wont seeing vaccine end year, probably wont completely available next summer. big HU fan. could lyrics. think got here? one social distancing states? Thank you, seem informed. specific question is, vaccine created tested, stage vaccines historically seen concerns/failed? understand it, phase 3 seems largest hurdle tests majority protection held large population, whereas phase 1/phase 2 seem identify safety. 

Even Fauci repeatedly says “cautiously optimistic” seems like vaccine already exists, waiting data. ""You thought would Swiss post, Sweden along!"" Australias total 1 day wtf WiFi sure might decision without triage problems. watched whole video doctor admits practically patients ventilators hospital die. Seemingly 3 patients ventilators made seemingly young healthy got virus. three also get Remdesivir drug. fought virus own. doctor also said would made decision mom, dad, brother, sister spouse. 

So remark quality life shit think doctor also thought would die either way intubating would prolong suffering virus. situation like doctor thinks hope survival doctor often advises hospice care even hospital tons empty ICU beds. County Judge Lina Hidalgo said alarmed changes information ICU capacity Houston area timing suspect. find very, problematic,” said Hidalgo, top elected official Mayor Sylvester Turner said change raised questions asked medical center go back original need truthful upfront try camouflage severity virus,” Turner said. figure? Rising infection rate + testing = bad fucking time next week so. absolutely believe “tone policing” applied loaded professionals make many times amount money people they’re providing care make, doctors get paid way much response acceptable IMO. hand, kind pleasantly surprised closely national numbers seem line up. Total since start Feb range something along lines 118K 156K. Pretty line reported actuals seem there's massive national undercount happening. Would hospitalizations better metric? seems far mild/ asymptomatic cases previously thought. Don’t get wrong it’s still troubling - flashy numbers don’t tell whole story. Parents around tend shuffle kids various summer camps. YMCA great one here, there's day basketball camp stuff like that. school district's school time child care program operates summer. far know, open modifications summer (in MN).  anything triage rules. sort thing happens every day. family arguing end life decisions state plus medical community stepped in. many similar given court-appointed guardian, Family Eldercare, wife sister engaged legal battle Michael’s permanent guardian. Representatives Family Eldercare made decision remove Michael hospital place hospice. doctor informed Melissa decision withhold care “what feel best along state, decided,” “this decision medical community state.” doctor explained wish intubate Michael, protocol administering treatment drug Remdesivir required. Melissa agreed wish Michael intubated either, approve moved hospice asked alternative treatments.

So family can't agree wishes. Sounds like daughter wants control law wife's decision. wife agreed intubate want hospice either lost control state. 

Here's kind similar story. Sons want take home also want hospice. impasse, state stepped in. 

I'm defending practice. guarantee disproportionately affects minorities uninsured. nothing covid. Sociopath. Lol. would someone PayPal you. Lol. They’re even remotely popular gyms...  Derp. True. Disposable 3 layer paper masks worst fit face (I long nose) cloth masks tie knot best fit. ? Duh. look cluster maps time you’ll see virus spread major ports entry along interstate routes travel. never went away “second wave” nonsense. reach 100million infected healed claim “wave” terror knowing world about... incredibly stupid. May today better yesterday.

Stay safe, wear mask, dwell. feel sad βɾօէհҽའ$ Yes. Navajo Nation higher COVID infection rate NY. serious trouble, losing elders.

If can, please consider donating [their relief really depends looking. example could argue New York definitely tail end first wave. sudden exponential increase cases would call second wave. 

Other states still substantial numbers never ended first phase. 

The US huge country high population. anyone actually paid attention actually arriving fake “case” numbers might make feel better instead stay hysterical. ""We need quarantined""

Yes, Basically every South American country reporting well. know it’s fun blame U.S. everything problem countries... four kids taught children disgusting, disease spreading sponges.

Either open school entirely opt another year remote learning. Better yet, hire 4 extra teachers classroom, divide class 4, led primary teacher, 4 groups rotate other’s houses.

these seem contradictory. remdesevir actually anything? connected way district would hard time putting trust leadership stupid. absolutely reason hold meeting 40 people room could easily held Google Meet Zoom. reason rule protests prevent retaliation protesters. thing legally protesting access list people protest known act less scrupulous manner, think that's worth protecting?

Someone attending / throwing illegal party hand... implemented mandatory masking beginning pandemic, could saved thousands lives Netherlands. 

I agree that! seeing Netherlands (in long run) got control without masks, evidently factors play masks.  
 
My point blaming mixed messages mask use talking failing way US approached pandemic paints incomplete picture. Seems like usually takes week death rates catch up. 90% facebook users horrid. 10% masochists wanting watch unfold. Indeed public Sweden see healthy debate?

No wait, that's pretty disgusting. [nO OnE CoULd SeEN cry. Yeah, maybe include planning guess. NE US. know one person died (age 40), two died (ages 70s), five others sick. Two sick March tested positively antibodies last week. 

Also, it’s dictionary definition pandemic. Considering Trump publicly said would like back testing get lower numbers positive Covid-19, yeah. Pretty evil. :( dad vent right now. Pence Ducey wearing masks... public place.. Unpopular opinion, many women pressured generally older people, men mostly children ready Gotta right go looting rioting! used phrase ‘very rare,’ think that’s misunderstanding state asymptomatic transmission globally rare. referring small subset studies

What else phrase ""very rare"" supposed mean addressing laymen? first horrible mistake probably killed lot people either (masks come mind). Ths comes several TX hospitals hitting max ICU capacity... It’s weird bad news always “priced in” fairly predictable employment news could figured advance little shoe leather produces 400-point pop Dow.

None consistent. None what’s happening rational. ...And market 300 points? Come on. virus control, market LEAST 1,000. fact winning pot depends whose lab faster makes even absurd. security issues quarantine hotel- indicating people either left visitors quarantine, possible infecting since covid detected there. health minister also broke quarantine rules twice take family vacations. numbers go August Trump ordered less testing. stupid work like whole presidency, see mile away yet can't anything it. Okay still stand previous post. Netherlands 10th highest coronavirus death rate. implemented mandatory masking beginning pandemic, could saved thousands lives Netherlands. 

The coutries actually able respond pandemic well countries face masks use widespread pandemic like Vietnam countries able effectively close borders like New Zealand.   Funny, I've always said took 7 years get used heat AZ. Alright 3s! fuuuuuuuk. Take care people. partying even think going see grandparents. agree. think they’re putting players major pressure? seems risky happen one “younger, lower risk group” people permanent lung damage, could ruin entire career. crooks trying steal money public.

No, epidemiologist arguing contact tracing effective truly asymptomatic spread rare people contract symptoms. test symptomatic people contact trace many people actually escape never showing symptoms. presymptomatic people eventually get sick, aggressive testing, find people, contact trace isolate. defense aggressive testing, contact tracing self-quarantining.

It relied upon person receiving information level understanding epidemiologist distinction asymptomatic, presymptomatic paucisymptomatic.

She never said can't spread virus symptomatic, said truly asymptomatic cases rare (in context contact tracing protocol).

The news media ran ""WHO says asymptomatic cases exist"" headlines everyone read justification need wear masks symptoms. doubt this. wearing masks like informed scientist reverse idiocracy. True. isn’t ever 100% compliance. stops tourists, companies flying people business, helps. Yes, trust data.

Yes welded homes. 

In fact, poisoned water supply, would push Covid-19 cases way down. /s Ugh, fly weekend, stories like terrify me. paying attention closely, looks like they've stagnant. go days there's crash erases gains. 200 week, 400 since month ago, highest point since initial crash March. 

The federal government pumped lot money economy stimulus bills passed, money run out. 

With cases growing rapidly, think us know hard correction stock market seems pretty divorced economy point.  We're still leading, different category domestic manufacturers right equipment make PPE already so, keeping demand.

I think there's short-term solution there. Everyone willing invest \_some\_ extra capacity, they're going buy bunch machinery they'll idling 6 months, order no. Seriously tho, could go lifetime without ever hearing word hydroxycloroquine lol. read hasn’t indicated that. right wanted read info. Nothing more. 

Didn’t realize asking source rude. I’m sorry. Next time I’ll take say completely face value ask questions. collective growing country.

That’s experience idea make HCQ anymore fwiw here's quote article seems “We attribute findings differ studies early treatment, part combination interventions done supportive care patients, including careful cardiac monitoring,"" said Zervos, division head infectious disease health system conducted study epidemiologist Dr. Samia Arshad. “Our dosing also differed studies showing benefit drug,” said. ""We also found using steroids early infection associated reduction mortality.""

This confusing know make anymore. seems used combination drugs well, addition HCQ. point hope find viable treatment, wish become politicized making things much harder determining viable treatments.

Link study: partner not. work, full time mom. give breaks mornings night, tough us Also protests Next see say stop testing numbers go down. linked CDC link earlier comment


Edit: honestly kind talk sides mouth news article also official CDC write muh freedumbs! list exceptions there's this, interesting:

""8. person voting, assisting voter, serving poli watcher, actively administering election, wearing face covering strongly encouraged;"" we're #1 !!!/s fucking DeSantis boy. likely spending time outdoors mountains short summer have. also around time year sun never sets. Thanks! interesting information No.

This would technologically TRIVIAL. Everyone's got fucking cell phone pocket.

And course, set up, we'd never gotten anywhere near 50k cases.

Instead, threw arms defeat.

And straight blame government's unwillinness regulate tech company's rampant privacy violations data collection. Nobody fucking trusts good reason.

It's ridiculous long drawn process much faster Disney resorts open. guys, dude figured out

19%??? That's insane

Massive undertesting... hard measures taken yet? worth it, parties super spreader events. One two infected asymptomatic people get 80-90% people infected. Took long enough. know Instagram models groupies flocking Orlando. I'm avid nba fan, shit disaster waiting happen. Letting states handle good non-emergencies. done testing apart official figures please share them. ridiculous comment. worry.....Trump promised would go away.  podcast ""Fake Doctors, Real Friends,"" Scrubs co-stars Zach Braff Donald Faison said Cordero contracted virus traveled back New York pack apartment wife bought house Los living American dream. literally bought first house went back New York pack apartment got COVID bad.

What strange unexpected plug podcast. I'm sure WUSA9 could've pulled information another relevant source. weathering storm... Hurricane season coming let's hope hospitals cope, need many shelters... dude said. Also pretty rude response imo. think generally chances contracting virus food quite low. got chance actually close contact others many governments fucking shit poor US right now. Gladly America's hat. We'll let know need ice. Recruitment COPCOV trial paused amid concerns side-effects raised research since work looked treating Covid-19.
It concluded drug beneficial increased risk irregular heart rhythms death. publication led suspending coronavirus treatment trials anti-malaria drug.

Are saying doesn’t increase irregular heart rhythms death now?

I’m comprehension issues today. Thanks! tried best. Yes exactly. People forget fact every additional immune person slows spread. one magical 40 percent mark. I'm SOBX. Beaches packed month, traffic standstill coming bridge today. Case numbers rural county tripled last 2 weeks. tiny hospital like 2 isolation beds. tourists refuse wear masks even mandate.

We fucked. I've started beating ""if scared masks, stay home."" record: I’m actually scientist, get it, unlike King Numbnuts here. really bringer bad news isn’t + Plans rest NBA season held sporting entertainment events stopped. bars restaurants closed, carry out/delivery. public places closed. jobs could people work home so. 

Sure still people went hung together, pretend mass interactions people severely slowed lock right ignorant. kind thinking apartment Boston, we’re pretty healthy good medical treatment... I’m pretty sure Texas Florida fatter, older risk factors. Maybe they’re spread something? Welp nope comes. Gotta slow spread. Mask boys, maybe get bandana holsters like true Texan.

Going reaping repercussions long time. gave sex started playing Train Simulator January. GF blood pressure seemed mind.  Good luck family. It’s evident government going take care us please watch ! Darwin Awards. I've tried research, median ICU usage around 50-60% Covid-19 ICU beds make 15-20% hospital beds across country. Hospitals try certain percentage beds open case emergencies. 

Also noted, 75% ICU beds larger cities, 17% smaller cities, 9% rural areas. lot counties older/smaller populations getting hit harder (when look rate/100k population) much capacity.

Unfortunately states getting hit hardest right 80-100% capacity. means anyone gets serious car accident needs critical care either luck they'll taking last 1 2 beds they'll flown farther hospital bed.

Norway struggled initially get elderly care facilities control, things fairly calm. general majority supportive this. mask wearing. minority conspiracy people think masks assault freedom. people actually pretty reasonable. difference eating tide pods affects health. next level irresponsibility... literally defeats entire purpose keeping kids school regular schedule.

It’s total insanity what’s happening. think actively changing numbers, manipulating testing (not it) many deaths listed ""atypical pneumonia"" ""seasonal influenza"".

By wearing masks public, presumably? live small town trouble finding tests grandparents. Fuck trump, Abbott, lt dan eat fuckin ass crack out. Saying would probably increase approval rating. Street tacos one best foods ever :) zero empathy.

He's going way screw American people. days ago something said he's gonna end funding testings. That's depressing af would mistake even without person knowing sick. always assume people around us could asymptomatic pre-symptomatic carriers. Well currently booms going bars. break south median age roughly 37 safe assume young people starting go around memorial day. soon we'll see number shift peoples lives ones catch it. fail stage, even Phase 4, proven serious complications associated vaccine.

Also, one seems counting capacity checking anymore entrances. problem reporting. Asymptomatic doesn’t mean typical vernacular medicine. It’s like theory used everyday use vs scientific theory.

\-- People pay insanely huge amounts get tested

\-- someone dies, added positive list

\-- grandmom's mom family(9 members) corona likely sick, getting tests done. also live right middle hotspot region. 

\-- Many people going hospitals get tested fear might catch corona hospital. actually happened many people went hospital health issues.

\-- Lack trust medical infrastructure also reason people going hospitals. example, grandmom's mom's family.

Stage 2 - Ok real man made

Stage 3 - Ok real we're I'm anything China does.

Stage 4 - Okay real something cannot financial burden.

Please don’t spread information like clearly don’t know talking people going getting infected can’t spell exponential feel nervous unsafe, go back 12th I'm really hoping delay opening last minute even though know happen. Yeah, I'm stubborn guess excellent points, forget states fudging numbers! (Looking Texas Florida seen 600+% increase pneumonia deaths year)  Funny say that, given 40% protesters unmasked. know sound like much take consideration fast spread virus is. call BS claim.  Well done dick state Or, know going sound crazy, President took pandemic seriously.  Florida, however enough get infected stay inside, eventually it'll burn out. actually trust Scott Gottlieb. He’s mostly spot entire pandemic forgot add streets go war Army want. go war Army have. 

Fuck ""should"". What's actual reality?   opposition party?! Fellow Michigander. love her, too, think we’re gonna need MI rest term. Hope Biden picks woman color instead. Oh look, argument: remember getting downvoted oblivion suggesting Americans perpetuate pandemic “if don’t smarten up”.

That USA reached 1000 positive cases. Look now. Friggin idiots. wife teaches medical students southeast school yet requiring students wear masks attend. Better yet, micro-classrooms departments vying for, someone high decided classrooms better use fall department doesn’t lose access them. medical school. It’s mind blowing. Punt shit again, boys. cure vaccine hundred thousand deaths away!

What first world response. read “Grindr says...” much that. contract tracing quarantining early on. US doing. took one man. One man say wear masks 3 months ago. much pain, suffering, death could avoided. roll pennies faster Bezos earns money? Ummm yes. That's literally laws exist. Ummm .... duhhhhhh???? Oh god! wish people wouldn’t embarrassed medical problems :(  got postcard mail saying universal studios pass bought vacation last year extended 3 Months make downtime. Yeah, don’t think going back time use thing that’s going happen. acting millions Americans travel Canada everyday? doubt 99% country would even care Canada banning travel. way lockdown going work you:

Stay inside go shopping (ideally week) working line work halted due ""key factor"".

NEVER visit anyone unless actual emergency. NEVER. someone know quarantined can't go shopping buy stuff leave outside door.

ALWAYS wear mask leave house, avoid touching face eyes outside wash hands like life depends (fun fact: does).

IF thing, whole country starts taking seriously &amp; authorities start enforcing rules fine in, like, two months. get ugly.

I honestly fear guys screwed pooch much recover without huge, scary losses point, mean, lost FOUR MONTHS, numbers crazy nobody still considering country sized lockdown, that's something eventually need anyway IMHO.

I would genuinely leave country head Canada American rn. feel sad them. They've misled under-educated life _that_ conclusion come presented even half-assed mask orders midst pandemic. Northern Europe never strict lock though. UK, France, Italy Spain ""house arrest"". others restrictions businesses, schools, travel amount people allowed gather public stay-at-home orders. Wait. Isn’t talking D614G mutation news 2 months ago? one considered dominant strain US already?

Edit: looked up. Yes. talking D614G. Nothing new see here. 

“The mutation Los Alamos researchers wrote affecting specific amino acid, authors report wrote. mutated variant known Fuuuuuck Deaths going down. Hospitals overwhelmed. people dying losing care (heart attacks, cancer, etc) COVID. (Here comes flurry downvotes) dunno that. Tons people started protesting guns half-assed lockdown.

As infection, two ways achieve herd immunity: large proportion population either gets infected gets protective vaccine. Based early estimates virus’s infectiousness, likely need least 70% population immune You’re absolutely fine. I’ve following little. devastating. hope “kids” partying trying play game catch firsr Alabama finally see light. COVID-19 joke.

You backwards. already politicized. discussion masks political element. People need babysitters. Wisconsin visits often mean, where's opposition party?

NO ONE coming save us. point, learn disagree without disagreeable.

Everybody needs learn this! Especially reddit, toxic Trump needs resign also. Jeez,I thought along NZ good job Texas bleeding irony 2084 cases Delhi. utter asshole. explain likely due behavior change leading smaller initial viral loads. protests this! conflicting feelings know special needs 1st grader NEEDS socialization, I’d rather socially awkward dead orphaned. terrified go back teaching in-person district already demonstrated they’re behaving like things normal—we events May social distancing, 5% teachers wearing masks, include principal. husband underlying condition faith I’ll able stay safe based attitudes community.  Probably waited numbers drop open up. Instead opened numbers leveled like every state. Might also want check percentage positive test results...it’s growing linearly. Look hospitalizations actually recent weeks. 

Keep fear coming hell aka Arizona. racing top states highest number. much winning! That's right friend! Please mandate Arizona next.

All stop dine-in restaurants.

Actually, shut us again.

Thanks. Or, know, they're misclassifying covid deaths pneumonia deaths. tense phone call daddy Trump. Thinks...or believes? Blood clots. He's one, either. patients parts intestines removed. wind dialysis damage kidneys. really want virus. Canada. Kind like Oregon, north little. Good point - need go back links confirm exact percentages. likely right form social distancing still advisable. medical-grade masks would MUCH better cloth ones. However, masks on, whatever form, transmission rate cut drastically, ""normal life"" (in form) also possible. method population help control spread virus, without hard quarantine, zero help central government. perfect, *possible*. 

Less optimistically, think less month away collapse healthcare system southern states spiking cases. That's... very, grim thing. barest thread silver lining populations states see happening there, make choice try save *themselves* similar fate. Masks choice still make aside mass death economic collapse. 

I'm going look appropriate links, try keep making case. It’s also probably shattering records positivity rate see every night live streams across country. outrage filtered depending agenda. say""we"". shrug danger despite status. Idk even possible enforce social distancing theme park. People social distancing wearing masks \~13 week flu season every year. would help save \~500k people die flu every year. going doctor note working flu. Stay home drink water. Tell boss fuck off. serious flaw within country itself, states can’t shut borders emergency, even they’ve actually done good job compared rest country. I'd like emphasize first line states high death rate among vented patients mean vent killed them.

A lot people shot chest die operating room, mean operation killed them.

Also, regarding viral aerosol, lack PPE making excessive aerosol puts HCWs risk risks accelerating collapse system causing deaths. Every aerosol generating medical procedure take part puts high risk exposure.

PPE access better am, trying noninvasive methods despite aerosolization, mean they're better either. returning old way practicing. helps keep vents available failing bipap etc. equivalent 1,000 3,000 roughly deaths per day eventually Congrats catching news three days ago. Clearly virus killed 130k, strategy rolling know, immunity common cold, isn’t really going work. factors mentioned role.

1. young people getting infected, average age new cases 35, smaller portion expected die. may true much longer - recent data Florida shows getting older population )
2. Greatly increased testing capturing large number milder/asymptomatic cases went un-confirmed previously, portion sick people among new cases currently smaller.
3. Better treatment - report UK said probability death 1/4th April hospitalized patients, probably due better ventilation management, anti-coagulation anti-inflammation treatments. See probably go current spread continues (it's testing leading cases, percentage tests coming back positive increasing well, spreading faster, see track percentage tests come back positive), time, due factors mentioned, time get spread control things reach New York levels crisis. Unfortunately, think time now, many states squandering it. mean recessions great money. sentiment spreading like wildfire. get morons like understand TAKES TIME virus eventually kills people. bullet. catch die instantly.

The thing makes sense bot pushing ""no deaths tho"" narrative.

But guess could idiot. Ya current dominant variant confirmed contagious False It’s like putting frog cold water slowly rising temp till it’s boiling. Also death rate lags behind case rate. People get sick takes week two die get better... state population 20M.

After 70% infection rate, get point herd immunity (regardless protections), that'd 14M infected.

5% 14M 700K dead. course, rate, death rate would spike higher due medical care overwhelmed would probably closer 10% 15%.

700K dead enough cost FL electoral vote. massive oversimplification complicated thing. ""Masks"" mean anything mask covers everything guy wearing old briefs ass cut full face respirator remote forced air.  yeah, recommendations require thought. expected, yet another thing whine online. still major issue. point 36 states nothing increased testing rather actual increase matter look it. Original 6 resident rooting different Original 6 team?! Brave. may be, parents &amp; grandparents? thanks that, won’t sacrifice others inconsiderate. oh cute intellectual dishonesty fucking hair split. win internet fight? Ehhh... people babies great recession.  Maybe less, still did. think fair make sweeping generalizations. Hospitalizations %positive rate going up. would know reading headline though. headline bad. 'Shatters records' appropriate language talking pandemic mention total case# fairly useless statistic.

I looking numbers objectively, let's upvote celebrate types headlines, help us. purely political divisive headline. better.

Deaths US still trending overall. know going happen! possible younger people getting infected driving fatality rate also possible treatment getting better driving fatality rate. possible deaths trend % positive rate going nationally, slowly far could younger people too. Like said know going happen. Obviously hospitalizations start increasing scale back states doing. states well continue open slowly.

What saying unreasonable? Yet comments get downvoted disrespected majority people sub, not?  Resident here. friends work bars want get tested holiday weekend, earliest get appointment Tuesday. gonna shit show coming weeks. Still risk tho sorry #USA, USA, USA# nobody asks right questions. shuffle shit around surface completely badly set system anyone tries examine basics gets mocked. Yes, Jerry politician show. elected city council became mayor 70s.

His tv show started 1991. said that, thread?

Nice red herring. prize win exactly thought people start ranting rights use ""individual judgment"" regarding covid. I'd agree large minority us completely incapable even basic critical thinking skills thought someone self. Fuck that. NYS says $2,000 fine, it’s $2,000 fine plus $850 “assessment” fee. NY loves added fees waited deaths spiked lock down

We learned lesson China locked sooner longer. know many people worried economy, half population United States dies this, economy worse locked hard core. would rather poor alive (you always start over) dead money I've made open go naught. game net? can’t use hands use stick instead? little neon balls fetched ball boys? Hi, shocked shocked tell you. I’m Dad. rally perfidity ramps Well response apparently removed apparently ""purely political"" even though pandemic unfortunately politicized thing point making. evidence mean 1 study done monkeys subjected worst case scenario. Yes. certainly common meaning ""all evidence"" Darwinism. CDC puts obesity rate 40% (closer 50% blacks) lists rate ""severe obesity"" 9% seem like thing getting contagious? outside India, part Indian diaspora - TV tropes. But... supposed change titles posting? You’re awesome awesome awesome couch bed, easier breath face down, back? heart issues? Maybe gas? wonder intend enforce it?

I work company 1500 employees, WFH. 

On paper, officially, employee handbook, rule. enforcing rule, made clear top context not-so-subtle clues comments intend enforce rule, I'm sure could, quite honestly. Schools daycares closed. true places could enforced strict controls like lines door outside spaced apart enforced staff member, strict seating, sanitation, required masks, etc. Although guess even people would mess Americans suck selfless. real MVP 8 before. gov pushed lax lockdowns harder wouldn’t fly populace. 

The problem election year. Harder lockdowns fly people would defy politicians put effect would get tossed asses. What's point losing job policy effective first place? said day need either compliant populace government force people comply US neither. least Game Thrones ending look lot less embarrassing hamfisted reality then.  soooo many factors go herd immunity range quite drastic would vary place place. Guesses 1918 pandemic around 33%, H1N1 around 40%. think range could 30-70% depending huge number factors. NYC telling tale fall. already around 20% antibodies mid April meaning infections likely March. I'd love see updated study anyone hit herd immunity first NYC already started getting there. Ugh that's bad. Feel bad workers. live basically 100%. I'm really wondering hospitalizations deaths seem much less correlated past -- especially  people Facebook need hear listen they'll definitely believe Hillary Clinton reptilian overlord looking start new world order memes. Maybe could channel conspiratorial thinking hatred Clintons... something along lines Hillary shapeshifter wants wear mask! could work. looking childcare Seattle infant/toddler freaking absurd. $2200-2500 per month sit waiting list year. guess we'll manage somehow. think I've seen 3 4 brand-spanking-new ""news"" sites today Fox News headlines sideboard. big super-PAC donation clear today something? war Ba Sing Sa. cook every night. Chicken, fish, pork, steak make veggies stews/soups/crock pots week. Normally order Saturdays. save ton money going eat that's referring to. 

You go eat time. mention eating time promote fat gain, know Coronavirus, attacks harshly overweight obese hypertension. sharing something case counts, denying virus. whole sub appears death cult apparently anything pump numbers causes questions enemy. Weird cult. We're pretty much stuck cure made  Everyone freaking Houston, except CEOs actually run hospitals reckless enough go trump rally without mask likely disregarding social distancing together. Maybe would worn mask president Ubecky-becky-becky-becky-stan-stan told to. Totally fine then. countries shown operate perfectly fine long mask regulations adhered to. way many people country way concerned ""muh freedoms"" comes mask wearing. Well shocked.... Vox 

Bwhahahhahahhahhahahahahahahahahaha Mexico rough shape Can't let Disney annual pass go waste! say I’ve seen virologists *theorize* trajectory right it’s early unknown say anything certainty. Got voted one Agitprop thread, gonna start another. like tell folks, whole family could carriers know. We've never tested us (MOM) go way often need to.

The actual number cases would fucking shocking could computed. count confirmed cases. even look confirmed cases confirmed deaths, date, atrocity poorly handled. possibility could continue erode even worse problem mind boggling.   One thing clear: need clapping harder! missed k post Kane mayor Tennessee??? worry US *be* trial. Ohio's G0P G0verner Mike De_Wine done decent job following science. Plus weird G0P G0verners super bleu states like Maryland's Lary H0gan Massachusetts's CharIie Baker (aka RepubIians Tump attacks Twitter). example, Massachusetts part 7 state compact reopening northeast safe coordinated way. 

They're much exceptions rule though, bottom 10 responses probably R. think important give credit credit due though, otherwise we're contributing poIiticaIization pandemic encouraging right stop trying follow science instead poIitics. Call praising harm reduction makes feel better.

Edit:misspelled bunch shit get past  I'm laughing, I'm crying. maybe laughing. Oh god. never big party person anyway, social distancing thing. Todays percentage tests coming back positive 16.8%

This means ~60k tests performed see positivity rate rising, *even* Florida increasing testing, see yellow bars. 

Yes testing more, testing more, larger percentage tests becoming positive. means huge outbreak occurring, otherwise would seen positivity rate go increased testing.

Good luck trying convince mom :) Florida 8th densely populated state behind NY. absolutely happen Florida.  Italy got hit hard cause old.

Murica getting hit hard fat.

China neither problems. Uhm. anyone say rioting cool?  

Maybe “sanity” checked, seem hearing things. don’t lag 2-3 weeks. Check daily death infection charts US. Cases peak April 1st *immediate* increase deaths, increase 100 additional deaths day peaked April 15th. seen increase despite new record-setting peak daily cases week miss people trying film empty hospitals start pandemic. ""hey, let put one places sick going pandemic prove pandemic fake! that's totally safe"" So, sitting U.S. President experienced Business Executive indisputably outclassed ***Vanilla Ice*** regards public-health-crisis risk-management decision-making. CT.

100 cases state. Declining. almost downvoted without thinking idiotic decision. Pets showing zoom meetings one best morale boosters!! Yeah gets 5 cents, assuming get nickels. dimes. quarters. $1, $5, $10, $20 on. you’d really dollar change shitload paper. bill weighs gram, assuming don’t get $500 bills, you’d 5300 kilos, 11,600 pounds. change. I’ll go get uhaul handle myself.

Edit: math wrong. 5300 kilos singles. 53 kilos almost hundreds. I’ll throw trunk car handle it. red-necks fox news saying many cases whether hospitals handle hospitalizations. know know theyre psychopaths? clearly idea wet markets operate. nothing communism. Source lag 2-2.5 weeks deaths? Everything I've seen suggests much longer, usually 4-6 weeks.   censored r/news reason, come hospitalization rate *with* varying level lockdowns, yes? What’s true hospitalization rate follow letting every “healthy” 50 get exposed? propose handle number hospitalizations? Adding top social support living expenses; mildly infected individuals unwillingly continue spread. that’s counting people spread pre-symptomatically, selfish people don’t care spread it. trust individuals self quarantine? can’t. nothing OK 4th July bbq party right now. I’m going respond further, really hope come around line thinking dangerous. Maybe anymore, bigger I. Take care. even smacks straight lungs get Gov. Ron DeathSentence making moves #1 country. almost like certain deplorables WANT spread. lot parents want kids go back work. sucks around. Cause right make teachers expose families, working parents can't take care children day That’s part human condition. It’s especially true places America puts individualism else, almost gross levels. Empathy something taught damn near birth. Sadly “me me” pushed “we” back burner. 1) academic biological difference asymptomatic presymtomatic states? Yes obviously, real-world practical difference one documentation paperwork (she even speaks this) use literally anyone except technical team WHO.
2) statement made ""Asymptomatic transmission rare"" (yes even using well explained definition) line current body knowledge. cites unreviewed data yet makes firm claim, poor messaging hands undoubtedly got people killed. economy impact lives? dunno, getting paid $10 million sounds like nice incentive me..

Helping country hard time putting show, getting paid so, need spend 3 months boring place...? sound awful. Even consider ""sacrifice"" good person skills country yearning sports/entertainment, may consider sacrifice worth making. Cries American, smiles German. 
It’s currently home office wife extended parental leave me..  
oh flattened curve *knocks wood* 5% flouted around now? Everyone knows actual death rate. Ok, stop making comment every time new wave discussed? distracting pointless, adding nothing conversation. entirely possible second wave kick first one ""ended."" collab honestly. Massachusetts resident don’t want anyone Florida coming up, good leadership first day 0 COVID deaths. starting ease back things now. Stay far far away southern us think people want something bad happen (although I'm sure sick do). part realistic. realist, look say ""yes, good news."" see situation many states getting worse, hard hit states moving backward reopening, also say ""while good news right now, long term outlook still frightening. hope things continue improve, also prepared stay get worse."" top that, data mid-June, reflect big explosion cases began see 2nd half month. KNOW fact

Facts care feelings. Sorry.

You've spamming lies throughout thread. 

You seriously need find somewhere else cope president's colossal failure incompetence. open, Disney World become Corona World Jacksonville Florida. mask mandate Duval county. I'd say 50% compliant order. 50% either maskless wearing chin, around neck, nose top. 

The Jacksonville metro area extends surrounding 4 counties mask wearing even lower areas. Daytime traffic back normal areas. 

I see public take seriously. point I'm hoping treatment discovered.

My job delivery retail. already 20% drivers forCOVIDd. others (most notably UPMC doctors Pittsburgh) reported similar clinical observations.

What none teams done actually show anything beyond conjecture causing it. There’s also lag reporting deaths. time someone gets positive test time death shows stats could month. rally outdoors high mask participation wouldnt problem Guess values life serving rich interests something. make claim can't back up. Sorry think asking proof claims bad thing. late already People... virus here. everywhere country. know proper terminology, past point isolation, masks social distancing eradicate it. waited long missed chance stop got going. late. wear masks, stop going non-essential trips wait vaccine available.

i'd like go stuff well, government people country proven willing takes get life back normal. prolonging directly responsible skyrocketing cases.

A great example would one housemates. went Myrtle Beach week bunch friends. staying house together. None think masks social distancing necessary young. get back i'm going keep distance much can. even thought driving 5 hours away siblings house stay them. left house NY since March, cases low. Strange risk home New York epicenter. Well, gave good advice choose follow indeed choice. 

Denial stage 1. work acceptance. close bars. That's hardly rolling back. Sweden trying prove it’s American USA something? governments looking USA good example global pandemic. Best healthcare world... they'll fine. Kuliastacaren please stop playing semantics? Posts like fucking useless. like dude practiced Trump's mannerisms speech patterns mirror, too. point, high risk husband stuck house indefinitely, help unemployment. people healthy order save people way stop spread indefinitely. solution ultimately results death.

What?? **infecting people** result death? can't think one thing could say would promote death without going way **infecting people**.

You ""herd immunity"" people disgusting. talking millions deaths shit. need limit exposure vaccine.

Your idea bifurcated society revolting. Actually since bring up, work older adults. capacity speak city county health officials weekly basis (heck I'll ten minutes). 31 older adults rely me. happens society. necessarily integrated. way provide support elders without exposure. quiet work limit exposure everyone - right play roulette peoples' lives. enable ""just asking questions, bro"" rhetoric. idea can’t believe gambling gets covid shouldn’t be. Mixing average median income mistake.  someone living Type 1 Diabetes Florida, TERRIFIED. Sir, please stop. 

Signed, healthcare workers Florida. Less time current timeline, I'd imagine. even want family sitting around watching morphine coma. Let die dignity point decide right. everliving fuck forget us fools CA. 

I'm socal boy roller coaster. health advisor orange county resigned getting death threats community mask mandate. level aggression people willing go sickening. hope community country stay strong adapt. virus acting ""like sleeper"". let new people in, would virus.

All current cases contracted overseas quarantine facilities. fact Minnesota's numbers plateaued since week prior Floyd's death FL's increased 5 fold disproves theory.

EDIT: lol downvoted speaking truth half assed lockdown like went US served prolong problem situation better March.

Worse. two months wasted, lockdown might avoided, fewer would died economy trashed.

If PPE, testing, understood individual could vacine became available, only...such tragic phrase. gotta wonder world people it.... Hey count Abbott yet. Nope, went 25 33 prove it. Math. Way round first week round second double fit narrative.

Absurd Little Britain Boris would agree, Trump good! Pubs opening July 4th, Independence Day UK.

Masks bad, political debate masks, useless. consequences same? Eh. disagree vote, article states he's spotted public wearing mask himself. he's clearly anti-mask like whacko's almost like playing exactly experts warned would back March without shutdown.

But hey hosting RNC next month everything then. Pandemic scar US labor market... lockdowns Can't sequel first movie never ends. still going up, maybe problem. Would say $600 week top UI benefits big enough percentage keep people afloat. saw lot people sub weeks ago making fun phrase saying everyone doomers. ""JuSt waIT moNtH"" yeah well turns everyone saying right. We're seeing cases skyrocketing we'll see weeks deaths start skyrocketing too. US fucked... even already was. Thank God follow advice Europe... Believe know. I’m parent catch every cold comes though school. get way colds kids. saw headline recently said something like: ""U. S. Coronavirus Strategy: Good Luck, Own"".

Seems apt. scientific papers I've read, best cloth face mask inner hydrophilic layer 600 thread count cotton 5 outer hydrophobic layers polypropylene 4 (PP-4) that's 30g/m^2. outer layer must electrically charged rubbing latex nitrile (common glove materials) wearing best protection. Further, proper tight fit necessary, unfitted mask reduces self-protective efficiency ~60%. pinhole-sized leak enough drop efficiency mask. Thus, avoid leakage, use tape made skin. mask combination proper fit offers self-protection similar N95s. Depending wife/husband living, make sure jobs secure get fukt lending process. married, great, means one drag one, lending life 😭  US government literally like mayor Jaws. ""we gotta keep country open fourth July!"" Judging parking street ""shut down,"" almost everyone still working 9-5. win match ? (this completely ignores testing positive rates increasing well, important piece information well)

This I’ve wondering. I’m statistician know statisticians. I’m pretty sure it’s possible extrapolate total infection rates based sampling. like political polling works. error margin able detect rise infection rates. understand you’re coming from. happens place profit life’s. countries begun opening slowly order return normal they’ve decreased numbers. 

If everyone would listened politicized wearing mask social distancing, we’d boat rest world. I'm listening arrested for. exactly problem. big insurance company (or govt) paying bills, pharma company hospital over-charge. every single patient interaction getting overcharged like 10% (or way more) multiply millions interactions get billions excess costs.

It's similar problem overpriced colleges, ""free college"" paid govt terrible idea, basically blank cheque colleges might charge even more. However, student loan forgiveness seems perfect solution - basically punish schools charging much, saying ""yeah kids pay shit back you, cut costs internally make difference yourself"" would actually address problem. wonder ""medical debt forgiveness"" could work way too..... yeah one hand sounds like giving free money sick people (which could considered weird reward incentive sick) sticking bill back insurance companies, still free market they're still competing ideally jack premiums group. Hard say would work... Or, know, could put something commonly used title people understand it. New York is. Every time get sick it’s I’ve contact toddler nephew. gets daycare. Kids congregating together germ hotzone. Disney putting profits kids, wow! Way shit reputation! disappointed hype Italian doctors study showed basically nothing seeing smaller viral loads.

So root cause still seems conjecture category. winning states. Dam America stupid Pfizer also extremely healthy company doesn’t resort pump dumps cause don’t want hurt credibility unlike newer startups much less lose comparably get 99.7% survival rate? Okay think I’ll take odds raise 5 million year killed smoking related illnesses.

Someone care explain downvotes? Can’t handle facts you’re much doom gloom? right on! actually went first serious hike last weekend i'm hooked. i'm exactly said make summer getting back nature Like magic. Ahh Alabama even watch this? crazy think individual states worse many countries. cool, immunity ""sticks"". Recent studies showing antibodies 6-12 weeks infection, could get seasonal resistance like coronaviruses cause (15-30% cases of) common cold. 

Herd immunity may actually stick there's reliable, longer (12-18mo min) lasting vaccine. Doug Ducey incompetent. two take actions actively make things worse. Obviously terrible suffering - level amusing downplayed threat meeting result that. Hopefully he'll okay. ###YEEHAW 10000 today? Suuuuuure... “hacked”. Sounds legit. See? Zero new cases 3 days! Problem solved! Consolation prize get fu k cousin. like Tuesday since reporting data also low Mondays. learned read quickly program (to limited extent) playing MUDs back day. bonus, screen looks like work zealous technologically behind parents.

Games great way motivate kids learn! Getting community spread acceptable level allows testing contact tracing actually make difference number deaths week pretty stable actually gone quite bit April.

In central florida they’ve really ramped tests, get tested free pretty much anywhere employers “encouraging” employees get tested slightest symptoms It’s quite outlandish seem suggest.

If effective reproductive rate less 2.5 herd immunity, defined, would achieved less 60%. define “entering herd immunity territory” 75% way there, think fair, we’d less 45%. It’s unreasonable think would quite feat logistically allocate tests efficiently able get better 71% positive test rate less 45% general population infected.

Actually, typed out, it’s downright reasonable. Unless use “entering...territory” literally, case, whatever lol

Edit: ignores seems accepted reality large segment people asymptotic carriers would make poster responding even less wrong. think measles? 1 - 1/r0 toughest maths do... seen that. link story something read? material using? Uh......go ninja go ninja GO! Dammit late Fuck trying get exact date already. deny happened every single time there's spike confirmed cases? Present situation excluded reasons already explained 50,000 cases matter death rate trending down?  roche test LabCorp indeed differentiate COVID 19, SARS, common cold. looking hope, least confirmed cases MUCH lower average age, lower age comes MUCH lower death rate. come conspiratorial nutjob? wanted see stats Florida government, wanted see # tests look test positivity rate. Along seeing deaths started rise. Past days 40K tests ish 6K cases sure backlog cleared what. Seriously going dramatically increase infections across entire country. likely communities already don’t give shit coronavirus, ultimately everywhere. go Deee

Spaaa

Cito. South Korea Taiwan proved even widespread testing, majority won’t get tested symptoms aren’t bad enough. 

Look antibody test studies better view death rate. Generally around 0.6-1.2%. lot younger people statistically better outcomes ones infected well. surges swept rug. 

I sure even strategy... mean, hide 100s thousands people sick deadly virus? importantly, would even try thing?? Great Fuck idiots! I’ve always thought something insanely strange full grow adult kids Annual Pass. 

Maybe it’s annual pass holders I’ve known fucks spends 90% free time amusement park. Job. Easy. What? read headline? Masks required statewide public. 

As unconstitutional, I'll need source reasoning that. Health emergencies (any emergency really) allow lot different kinds responses would otherwise options. Deaths still flat slightly declining. hard imagine people taking seriously, maybe affecting high profile person know/like/admire, start believing COVID real seriously bad. Wait, women medicine law feminism? surprising. believe AUV 10m+ thought hurricane season over! live Vegas. I’ve observed, 1 4 businesses following protocols sounds right. businesses post rules, timid enforce old people red hats come call everything hoax.  look line sharpie Alabama Florida Arizona old people go die 2 fastest growing states virus. bad.  said one cent, doesn’t penny coin. Could digital transfer. florida man isn’t feeling hot masks mandated live South Carolina (tourist city population 30,000). Went Aldi today first time month, 1/3 people masked. crowded. go again, still going emotions. bringing possible discussion brush off. narrow minded are. discounting wearing mask? No, merely stating possible risks. go ahead keep living name. ones looking anyone wearing masks. whatever lol wont even read anything even bring studies links narrow minded stubborn are. good day dumb goth. Definitely politically motivated: ""In order state cleared DoD travel restrictions, must remove shelter-in-place orders travel restrictions""

i.e. pretend like problem let spread exponentially, block travel state.

But agree, Michigan go ban travel states uncontrolled spread late. Lockdowns hurting economy, people's fears due virus is. Hence economy continue suffer virus control vaccine. economy damaged bad due poor management, bet going severe effect future national security. US news depressing me. Canadian surge predictable given previous events...if only. ‘real’ lockdown beaches 3rd-4th thats it. State complete joke. friend go jail. Period. Full stop. people expect.

Healthcare commodity United States.

Also lots Karen types don’t give fuck infect.

RIP Florida. Cases started rising 12th, according rising still trending down.

You're testing finding mild cases would missed before. aren’t anti-vaxxers, don’t want corrupt government use guinea pigs. bit end Fauci says ""there unintended consequences"" people wearing masks - really endorsing efficacy safety everyone? mean takeaway saying potentially dangerous people wear, dont suppose anyone infer without direct quote. Michigan it’s annoyingly amusing times. Governor closed person restaurants people refusing wear masks distance ones angry shutting Ain't peach...

Get it? the.... Georgia's got vibrant industry growing....anyways.... STICKING LIBS WHAT?!?! see based actual studies death rate lol. It’s typically 0.6-1.2%.

Even testing everyone, massive chunk won’t sick enough seek testing. Take lockdown seriously beginning may need stay locked long require second one womp womp Ah, WallStreetBets remind us little human lives worth. 

Just case forgot minute.  explain little math? basically question testing overall, think. think interesting discussion. almost different discussion. First, there's question many people create. Second, there's question encourage growth people created, scientists. 
 
If current answer need create 1 million people get 1 scientist ... need argue 1 scientist develop gains offset consumption 1 million average people. Obviously, difficult analysis. 
 
Or perhaps best balance create 10 people, drive intensive efforts make 10 people scientists. see happening. growth business world revolves around creating consumers, scientists. again, also difficult analysis. paralyzed economy unreasonable fear. called natural selection. Hopefully reproduced yet. Yeah, read like days ago. Guess bring back dead. Way go! 5% bullshit number though, actual death rate somewhere around .5%. still lot people, million guys want die pay back though. aren’t opposite forces.

Of course are. not? Taking either measure extreme results completely opposite action. one life worth economic activity would still closed. Making decisions literally requires balancing opposing fores. think Fauci speaking offhand saying something thought sounded nice. owned Vanilla Ice/MC Hammer CD kid, let tell you, ever listened MC Hammer half. Well really- know viral loads lower measure/observe that. necessarily know occurring.  5% way higher real death rate virus, honestly makes statements even terrifying.

Triggered hurt feelings. Nice. got downvoted shit trying explain yesterday lmao banking housing crisis dude. comes economic collapse. ok. Get pre approved ready depending market at, never hurts offer couple thousand asking price. 30 years thousand bucks secure house ain't shit. wholly dependent market though. Happy house hunting. worst case scenario keep reading 60-70% country contracts virus. means 30-40% us don't, I'd prefer remain latter part possible. Ok, lots testing. spike deaths. Got it. top likely every dead person several people lasting negative health impacts recover initial virus infection. dosent much. still helps...  like everything else US. say things even intimate things. worse flu, wear masks. Vaccines provide benefits, others, get vaccinated. sure got thoughts posted.

What say cannot expect effective vaccine COVID-19, even one becomes available, like flu vaccine - stil 30-40% chance catch - like chickenpox effective stopping cold.

So understanding that, low risk categories go lives reasonable precautions, live fear. Get it, get it, get life. That’s long walk park signal lost virginity cousin, okay. Good job again, Alabama. aren’t going days like today (at least while). going increasingly worse days virus continues spread unchecked. Nothing change long people able carry day outside. like countries before, US must enforce months long complete lockdown enforced police army.  can't even think second one might be. ‘state crimes’ new goal post deniers deaths..before cases never spike..now alot cases testing deaths down. 

They see end month full ICU hospital beds...they realize foolishness need emergency room visit can't get bed ignorant realize truth everything constantly told deny right. Wtf talking lmao don’t even watch news. HOSPITAL MADE FACEBOOK POST SAYING PATIENTS EASE PANIC. SORRY THAY DOESNT FIT NARRATIVE HEAD. IM STATING FUCKING FACT, IM FUCKING LIBERAL, FUCK OFF. many deaths? many tests? two people know gotten upper 20's currently fine. One confirmed positive GF guy confirmed positive. Headaches, body aches, loss smell, fever. Assuming young probably ok never know It’s almost like ignoring science data months causes spread Yep, one state testing site near two counties. Around million people around 750 tests day. number tests stayed since first opened April. get site early morning SOL. wonder many people tried get tested gave site run tests. Public schools problems required follow educational standards developed grade subject (this common core is). don’t necessarily set curriculum standards dictate taught curriculum. teacher decide want teach standards lessons supposed line them. Whether public schools enforce could debated, issues state vs national standards, 41 states follow common core 9 states, including Texas teach state standards. However, never, teacher, worked public school adhere standards. So, it’s really correct say public schools longer following curriculum standards determine included curriculum it’s required vast majority states. feel like alot people laid came back tbh. possible people got temporary jobs cover bills well walk mile like 8 minutes

This sound right I've never seen walk so, maybe. Even deadly people say, still deadly some. Right? prevent 1 death, everyting power that? least policy country. 
Let alone 100k deaths probably could prevented country normal lockdown practised social distancing start pandemic like lot EU countries pretty much back normal life. 

So TLDR: save lives, fucking it. Fuck freedom while. Wow, believe true reading...

Why earth would pause testing midst outbreak? ISS adds claims dangerous make people feel safe situations safe.

Science must always pursuit truth.

Neither science, r/coronavirus, fear truth turn away truth insane ideology people stupid trusted wear masks, must manipulated fear so.

I fundamentally unequivocally reject comment suggesting human beings ought lied keep constant state fear manipulate certain behaviors. large people range overall health. young old changing health relatively short time.

It must really bad . Nice, faster herd immunity

Plus multiply faster means symptoms show earlier = better almost like know protests Florida one places. we’re not. overestimating math literacy education seems charaterise folks driving growth much underestimating power exponential growth invisible forces (virus). remember someone reddit telling “there nothing worry about, numbers may way higher Italy’s Total cases/1M pop won’t ever higher Italy’s”.

Everywhere world sort bad things rise last couple decades. little strange. Sure, people going less likely care guideline they're told highly unlikely spread virus they're asymptomatic. seems unnecessary. Recall original idea “flattening curve” make virus go away slow spread infections prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed short run (this never issue Texas). 

Article ignoring what’s actually happening right Houston, cool cool stable genius, one might say! caveats though.

You get get it/forget next month long keep clearing bodies away also something fun insta. RemindMe! 2 weeks “reply thread” Yes, scary rationale people wearing masks. ""Oh, feel fine, need mask,"" asymptomatic breath bombs keep striking wherever go. agree. also think that's partially US's numbers high compared rest world.

However, growth rate going accelerate major holiday. 20000 cases July 9th low rough estimate. quite literally fucking doubling week. may another week show though. 🤦‍♂️ Since Arizona ""increased shut measures"" week, seen lot people talking throwing big ass 4th July parties. shattering records soon too. Somehow bars gyms staying open, people packing them. honestly shocked ""covid parties"" too. July 4th tourists arrive. Great timing! Forcing reopening coronavirus capital world bad look them.

Unfortunately limited perspective. Consider bad look people know bad idea. unfortunately seems like quite small minority, based implications current state affairs.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yea sure, like everyone capability buy entirely new furniture housewares 40 mil unemployed economy bottoming out... agree. U ""USA"" fading quickly.

Probably opponents wished. USA lost war even know fighting. Cases doubling every week means 2000 dead Floridians month current national fatality rate. think need consider employees working schools too. Teachers, wife one, often put small classrooms 25 kids idea practice distancing, keep mask on, stop hugging other.

""Kids get sick"", mean bring home parents, grandparents siblings might.

""Kids get sick"" also mean expose teachers this, bring home vulnerable family members.

Grocery stores essential service often large well ventilated spaces social distancing possible sheer square footage environment. can't classroom small children, hallways, playgrounds, PE classes, bands, choirs, science labs, etc.

So teachers start dropping like flies, can't get substitutes come replace them? want schools 'GO' one day, 'Closed' every two days positive cases met school cleaning contact tracing?

It's ridiculous want send huge populations young people areas can't possibly distance themselves. OK, well I'm going stay home year. I'm not.

Period.

I'll one idiots bar lake drinking margs summer.

My mental health daughter's education socialization important spend year inside. Yeah, that's small percentage everyone it. Everyone, everywhere needs carpenters, plumbers, electricians etc... Plus, get paid learn get licencing DEBT FREE. takes way less time. mean, know need scientist stuff, highly competitive jobs man. well damn, guess jail worst place meant humble. top that, one ever flu? hospitalized 2 days 17. flu “the flu” good medical care. hospital beds filled due Covid, bad case flu deadly too!  start, US doubling around 2 3 days. 

BUT new policy dropping testing mean current numbers surely reported. 

This also accelerates infection rate dramatically. 

If AZ 13 hour queues, im sure people waiting long testing. 

The social media posts seen, seem minimal standard prototocols NZ countries observed get disease eliminated.  thanks input! :) Florida NOT. positivity rate tests 9ver 15% last saw, indicating testing (it needs 10% less) Could looking tens thousands deaths positive tests?

What R number? fault lying public face masks. 

You either die hero live long enough see become villian.

Shareholders big pharma companies: ""So bad because...?"" failure whole system. someone who’s offered 0 paid time bills pay going work sick.

Even education better parent teaching afford it. sneeze project used send teenagers morgues drive home seriousness drinking driving. get caught deliberately spreading covid (after quarantine course) - teenagers boomers all-around dumbasses. morgues probably needing help soon anyway. care lives, moneys. Besides, mainly Nanas going die anyway. wrong proves theory eventually significant amount homosexual males acquire HIV. much prevalent HIV stigma, laws transmission, increased treatments prevent transition AIDS. Beaches, protests mostly socially distanced wearing masks.

We also significantly less cases community now. live there's new case week. absolutely okay begin relaxing restrictions now. like pubs open, open usual Saturday. Baseball hard guys literally physically distanced one another field

Unless position player trying hold running bag, runner sliding close play. pitcher infield meeting catcher within two feet 9-10 batters umpire. Glad they're going extend federal unemployment.

Money lives. remember next time think politicians give 1 single fuck you. One day ought lap New York single worst day America! Go Florida, go! see Villages.  one could’ve predicted this. Oh feel bad them. It’d interesting track deaths service industry employees.  No, meant states. need state &amp; local, like HEROES Act. 

States need funds hospitals, schools, etc. Local governments, schools, states biggest needed bailout unemployment increases further, schooling can't happen, healthcare can't function etc. support direct aid people, middle class workers destroyed (as well societal harm) state funding sent. states keep things closed without funds long either, matter good Governor is. can't afford to. bail corporations state local governments different story. Yeah.

It sounds like there's still capacity cooperation across parties Spain. Sadly, on-the-ground reality US right now. \_only\_ legislation passes US right result ridiculous give-the-farm-away compromises parties occur absolute must-pass legislation. quite dysfunctional here. Damn, that's hell way say that. guys actually ever went full-on-hard-style lockdown though?

I'm talking mandatory masks, closing stores, enforcing ""don't leave house unless emergency"" orders, closing every public space mean every single one.

We Italy, two awful months, paid big time.  
I know unpleasant way go.

You also need enforce measures, Italy police went pratically North Korea asses: stopped outside house viable reason there? get fined, simple that.

No ""freedom"" issue either: lockdown lifted &amp; police returned BAU. live (central FL). Two weeks ago, maybe 1/10 people wore mask. gotten heckled grocery store wearing mask. numbers started spiking last weekend 50% people wearing masks. neighboring city voted mandate masks idiots Facebook started commenting announcement post would shopping city mandated masks. shocking little care. Good move. spent _months_ pretending masks needed... Spain we're problems attracting tourists many bussinesses closing. People scared come and/or money travel.

Florida already total cases per capita Spain locking down. Nobody want go state corpses piling hundreds day.

Doing nothing kill thousands people. far worse economy too. obviously missed operative word use enough, yeah, Covid19 get ya. Incorrect headline. Speak re: lockdown. expect increase cases protests. without masks. Natural selection work. Yeah, population-wise think Australia thin ring people coast, surrounding giant near-empty desert. Update: everyone dead That's part that's clear. pharmacist told us free still required insurance information, told us copay. high deductible plan hopefully big bills. contact work though I'd assume would fall workers compensation charges? pandemic, protecting others == protecting yourself. protecting bullshit needs stop. Also, fucking matter whether protects protects person, matters restricts spread. Give KING gold Hard get re-elected let supporters die  Tho simple math like this? New York City whole another beast, comparable London Paris metropoles mostly suburban Florida people dont use public transportation much, metro, many high rise buildings dense cities bad? Sounds like close bars limit restaurants similar establishments sort regulation, like 30% capacity number cases would cruise around current levels. Idk, it’s hard believe 80k cases day. Snowbirds return NE school district put email providing free tutoring summer, utilizing online classroom/education website school system uses Microsoft Teams. Thought great way keep kids interested learning likely e-learning fall.  recall seeing message federal health officials saying masks work, necessary. probably preserve medical personnel assholes would horde them. Utah outside downtown, mask usage maybe 1/10 1/20. saw plenty big groups too. impression (I've once, mostly I've read here) Great People Texas fucking idiots complete selfish morons it. 

Am wrong? hope idea I'm talking about, entirely possible.  teachers 30+ kids classes, would $60/hour. vast majority teachers (maybe HCOL areas) making much long shot. $0.60-0.75/hr per kid would accurate, that’s 1 class 30 five classes 30 middle high school level. Babysitters would make considerably charged per kid. History won’t remember well. sure familiar doesnt mean 60% normal means 60% chance producing normal. normal 1-3 hurricanes, could see 4-6 hurricanes year. numbers may idea same. got locked CT now, we're still Top 10 deaths (and NY NJ higher # deaths per million residents). Watching NYC went through- getting spillover adjacent counties- enough scare us masking listening goddamn experts, still close fast enough avoid worst it... 

...which course fucking mistake rest country making right now. agonizing thing closed week two earlier deaths could avoided. Watching play different states madness. Right? 100k+ deaths, many voters lost? mean seriously. political ground average? Yo VIP- stay fuck outta Texas. Permanently. expect?  wife's mother 96 lives Florida....i told ""say goodby mom, going make next year""....(and i'm sure chances either)  Fase 4 medio Spain. Enjoy boys. La vida es breve. Florida: won’t lock macho. Science libtards. shoot way Covid situation. /s oh all. wouldn’t american /s absolutely clue referring FL definitely ran tests week, falling behind lab work too.

And backlog contact tracing absurd. pay fine date listed else next time go renew car registration, get pulled anything, outstanding warrant roundup happens, come put jail. 

They violating GO jail wearing mask, jail paying outstanding fine. Yea, feels like comes coronavirus, unfortunately lot people reddit seem think China right. 

* Mandatory lockdowns? ""Draconian dictatorship!""
* Contact tracing? ""Big brother surveillance state!""
* Rapidly building hospitals increase healthcare capacity? ""Clearly death toll 10x higher""

I wish people would put politics aside could try help one another tackle crisis affecting 100% humanity. Remember movies humanity banded together face common threat, whether giant monsters aliens? Clearly film-makers optimistic :( Basically pointing Senate trying force people back work right now, terrible idea. need put $2k Stimulus checks till Pandemic over. Than, start rolling ""Back Work"" ideas wanted do. ** ENEMY BOSS MUSIC STARTS PLAYING ** simple. people stop paying mortgage banks get trouble. ratings drop like stone can't borrow money normal operations. mention federal banking regulations would immediately kick place dip reserve line. Damnit.. hope pulls through. People need learn death rate fucking low need stop fear mongering. Well, handling pandemic. New Zealand country seems handled brilliantly, effectively eliminated virus country.

The problem one guy total hypocrite, breaking rules probably helped put place. terrible failure leadership, reasonable repercussions it.

Sweden, hand, seems instituted questionable policies. heard stories Swedish government officials blatantly breaking rules put place (but exactly lookout). different problem, also worthy criticism. No, right. chance stupid enough believe it. Got source thats says vaccines target version original version?  100% - work fast food revenues changed exactly 0% since switching dine-in + drive thru drive thru mobile pickups inside. tend agree. Especially critical thinking part definitely Moore's Law. is, we're immune it. suppose understand difference humanity individual, prone wild generalisations, wouldn't. 

Humanity treads go-with-the-flow course, always has, always will; individuals tread path, influenced greatly personal weaknesses.

Humanity continues course unending, individuals 180 successive days.

Yes, drop individual position power see break, subscribe whatever base instincts, individuals still represent humanity, fine, commonly united least *trying* ""do would done by"".

Does help any? competing Kemp worst governor award. Abbott Ducey least willing take responsibility.  Make WI pay it. Excuse language, time fucking necessary beginning. live Texas amount people I've seen without masks within close proximity god-damned high! Yeah, thanks Doctor. Nobody saying eradicate virus time soon. don’t even vaccine yet, obviously. Re-read. correcting terminology. It’s eradicate, “abolish.” Definitely Texans Texans. Arrogant assholes part.

Edited add - anti-maskers assholes. No, haven't.

But another output semen would mean would *also* worry semen tract infections. That's another tube get infected. someone travels rv, love Walmart overnight stops. usually grab redbox go sleep. feels like natural evolution, selfishly may make harder us rvers truckers this. like upset guy got February comment rails went. lines space mountain?  Pigs Unfortunately, America made pandemic political issue.

“America” make political issue. I'd tell did, comment would deleted. live Knoxville major. voted 7-1 yesterday implement mask public starting tomorrow. one vote cause freedom. mean..... /r/FloridaMan exists reason. number cases yes, adjusted population Multnomah 275/100,000 Washington 229. Meanwhile Union 1,274/100,000 Umatilla 683. Morrow 551. Malheur 405. time 4th July weekend...this isn’t going stop people huge parties going crowded areas it? Stay safe ! 
I think people really clueless . well mutation happened long time ago, means vaccine candidates unaffected created mutation started leaving mark need defund important institution, economically feasible things developed nation do. Especially ones afford billion trillion dollar corporate bailouts/subsidies.   Nope think it’s Giant overreaction. I'm trying discredit masks though? think everyone missed point even scientists agree with. large groups, covid still spread people wearing masks. expected higher cases areas protesting happening. Masks 100% effective. I'm saying wear anything... I'm saying wearing mask make immune catching, spreading Covid. controversial statement make. Slow testing everything fine. Well, basically realise that, although several ""nations"" Spain, even languages, Europeans different other. 
For instance, Greece lot similar Portuguese people.

We are, also, much contact elderly than, instance, Americans.
It's normal live next, visit parents grandparents weekly monthly.
I believe that, sense, communities closely knitted.

In Spain, answer question directly, realising early affected elderly people more, unthinkable put risk.

Cuomo early phrase: ""my mother expendable, mother expendable""
I saying they, we, care mothers americans do.
Perhaps care other's mothers.

Keeping America particularities, think society built individuality, self accomplishment, succeeding own, good bad things come it.

What trying explain, perhaps succeeding, understood early public health problem.
It everyone's interest surpass soon possible least possible consequences.

And we, they, turn crisis politically one. guys Madrid's health authority ordered lockdowns, mask use, guys Barcelona find perfect time disagree disobey.
They decided survive discuss politics that.

The problem US everything simbol partisanship beliefs. mask, flag, gun hat.
A hell lot divides Americans divides Iberians first wave. second wave distinct mutation. Stopping testing doesn’t stop people needing care going hospital dying spreading disease. easy, although quite bad economy, due huge amount low savings families singles. Also, online learning horribly done here, universities schools. Huge setback children 16yo.
Now, official information bad, test much, properly, think artificial ""good, passing "". Healthcare overloaded virus, many people rescheduled medical tests, delays prescriptions etc.
Initial response okay, now....well. Also, elections done mail safe way, scheduled disease ends, but...eh.
Out mentality help here, people mostly evade ignore - want unkind, see mostly older people young middle age men care believe. also fuel alternate medicine antivaxxers bad, problem growing last decade, fast. USA world's Florida. elected Representatives. Eh probably is. Allergy season pretty bad year. One coworkers divorced parent two, desperately wants work hours person take care kids them. could feel aggrieved working 10 hours week less I'm human functioning emotions see struggling can't really hold him...  read answer someone thread; answer yes. pretty disconcerting considering hospitals seeing high influx COVID-patients already. Yeah I’m seeing family. They’re saying “the gubment can’t tell do!! Muh freedumb!!” agree more. think 5 months coronavirus realized daily numbers accurate day, guess political agenda push. Look actual finalized numbers past two days:



 | California | Florida
---|---|----
6/30 | 7,939 | 6,093
7/01 | 6,497 | 6,563

There also day-to-day fluctuations reporting sources randomness. instance, different numbers, California hitting new record 9,740 yesterday (7/01). sub California hits new record numbers: *crickets* Coronavirus Vampire Porn. Could niche market worth exploiting. Congrats! win! Probably. Eventually they'll talking decrease body count. timeline. place call governer Georgia? Sadly, surprising number Americans believe COVID-19 number keep climbing. ever get chance, listen Midnight Chernobyl. really humanizes everyone involved way heartbreaking. should. also realistic impact virus instead claiming almost million people die Florida alone. believe may cornered “stupider that” market Florida. It’s reason think Florida continues elect idiotic politicians

Credit credit due, thank retired ignorant boomers, hillbilys decades taking radical right-wing, hyper reactionary cubans caribean people. count me. stroke? April shorter February, one arguing you. 

To easier time line, delete account. much u aren’t elderly “The data showing there’s single mutation makes virus able replicate better maybe high viral loads,” Fauci [said with The Journal American Medical Association’s Dr. Howard Bauchner. “We don’t connection whether individual worse not; seems virus replicates better may transmissible.” Lol wtf Nothing.

I'm saying need solution keeps everyone going under. Putting stop rent puts onus landlords, going jump ship first available opportunity. would better to, say, provide rent relief, provide rental loans program renters borrow X months worth money pay rent starts becoming due state emergency pandemic ends. Go Team! worry healthcare providers need hospitalized. hope enough hospital beds, vents, PPE available surge patients. like two weeks day!

The virus disciplined government See go restaurant then. Problem solved. luxury essential.  Normally agree. dumb cancel someone got fight someone parking space. position power like everyone looking KNOWINGLY lied. CANCELED. Floridians need take little seriously wonder state dumbest population. what???? Yep. grew family area.

Outside I’d gone. don’t understand happening sub today. know this. known long time. isn’t “new” mutation. mutation infecting US since got here. Geez, normal already pretty bad kid job... mean like protests CDC actually approved of? What?!?😳

Ok, so, that’s cue leave. Ive clearly wasting time trying intelligent conversation 3rd grader. mistake. Nah, setup inflatable screens temp screens. Would crap quality side buildings. tried underwear going commando similar results you. matter hard tried get tell indicate needed go diaper/pull-ups. surprised bare ass thing actually worked well. immediately went running bathroom urge go nothing catch it. followed M&amp;M's course. think maybe 2 accidents most. next week undies. think still pull ups night couple weeks fully established. hey, we've mistaken farts poop - can't careful one! LOL. methodology term bareass method (some guy wrote book went cousin told worked her). technically bit involved running arond drawers on.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Three Day Potty Training method. go hardcore that, neccessary us.  Keep mind history written yet. Houston, stopped spread today, expect hospitalizations continue grow weeks. Maybe spread stopped two weeks ago, maybe stopped another month. know.

Also, keep mind TMC recently stopped publishing data hospitalizations week ago hit 100% utilization. published 

We speculate stopped publishing data. typical reason manage narrative around hospital capacity. speculation. 

We know spread continuing Texas increased testing increased positive rate tests last 

Given circumstantial information, I'd shocked TMC 100% utilization lower. circumstantial information. 

We know capacity 100% put up. Basically turn beds beds COVID patients. That's probably CEO talking about.

That story misses lot points number beds staff equipment run beds. another story (the public) absolutely information anecdotal information Doctors sharing stories. 

Given information, I'd say misinformation TMC lacking hospital beds. way would misinformation hospitalizations Houston area trending downward beds less full. available information seems say hospitals nearly full hospitalizations Houston area trending upward. Sick people, sick economy. read somewhere Dallas Texas projected peak March 2021. 

Try size. accept nothing less Ivanka Trvmp © Bodybag. Taxpayer-bought, course.  regards many people wearing masks shopping? consider using N95 masks possible protect others us? delay, vulnerable better socially isolating, it’s mostly young healthy getting infected.

An obese 85 year old might 25% chance dying infected healthy 21 year old &lt; 0.1% chance. However long term effects unknown, even survival, it’s possible 21 year old regret rest life.  can't defend numbers, see point. takes number people operate ride regardless many people waiting line. Ac running regardless many people inside. Actors acting regardless many watching. cases deaths low (compared UK), generally less 60 deaths per day last month. feel like vitamin intake definitely makes huge difference bad hits mean callous, business survive 10% drop business, survive another 6 months lock Yeah lol kid shows boring parts didn’t want go to, rides  Correction: long there’s obvious link major outbreak open theme parks won’t forgo profit. There’s question *whether* they’ll major outbreak. Hospitals screamed warning week ago Governor basically put gun banning elective surgeries Dallas, Houston (Harris county), San Antonio (Bexar county), Austin (Travis county). Without elective surgeries, hospitals bankrupt hospital CEOs changed narratives. Hospitals creatively make bed spaces (bunking patients, field hospital, etc) we’re gonna see shortage nurses soon. reason can't say guaranteed already running tests. personally say certainty already 100k new infections per day, still testing enough. spread younger people right now, young people bother get tested. 

I'm basing articles new cases fraternities official number something like 15 dozens people comment saying personally know like 50 people sick get tested change anything them. 

Hell, could possible half million new infections right now. every positive test, there's 3x many sick bothering test, every sick person there's another asymptomatic person, right 6x reported numbers. saw highest number could find types without looking that. Well that's probably understanding masks work, so... like 40k continues fashion feels wrong partying fun right now. roller coasters log rides know *fifty 911s* occurred months?  I'm hopeful we'll vaccine early next year. Oxford vaccine appears developing quickly Fauci said expects breakthroughs soon. There's light end tunnel. Whoa. Buddy. hurt you? particularly original sentiment but, WTF?!!!

Like 100k dead wake call enough? guess compared Summer + Economy.

This months, months pandemic. good reason lack tests. US spends much defence spending, presumably protect American lives, peeps cannot even get test?

Sorry low content opinion post I'm shocked seems obviously like priority not. 

Testing contact tracing necessary get control hotspots prevent spread. like powers decided herd immunity, expensive entitlement sucking vulnerable damned, pretending try stop this. vaccine race hijacked politics almighty dollar. misunderstand test is. pick median 100. force data fit normal distribution. None those. fucking virus grows tentacles. Tentacles. Long, arm-like extensions called filopodia. I'm scientist virologist know that's common viruses not. consumerism fuels instant gratification habit. habit, lack discipline, leads restraint pressures social contact build up, leads stages withdrawal. 

The first stages denial, anger, bargaining see here. 

It stupid much withdrawal addiction. withdrawal face, I'm saying addicted consumerism likely lack discipline. lack discipline leads to:

Denial: #fakevirus

Anger: protests, protesting masks, protesting authority, unsurprisingly protesting good things angry upset about.

Bargaining: we're kinda open, things kinda OK, party, ones unlucky. 

Not sure expecting addicts socially responsible withdrawal. Hilarious considering line situations. this, picture whole- certainly faster vaccine development methods trying accelerate development, reads throwing tech solution ignoring simple solutions they're hard implement current administration.

E.g. simplest thing country right require mask times public indoors.

Mostly cynical mood today, haha Orlando going mass death. Seems so. Ohio trending way everything goes perfectly. political climate, greed pharmaceutical insurance industries, lack true understanding virus still (real scientific consensus takes years establish), highly unlikely things go according ""plan"".

We still adequate testing PPE. even know people long-term immunity infection (or vaccine). immunity lasts month two, something everyone monthly? still figuring people starting see testing positive month two recovering, never actually recovered, lost immunity. kind data takes time study it.

Mass producing affordable vaccine provides long term-immunity within time-line seems like pipe-dream would require stars aligning, 2020 especially taught us expect go.

I think timeline keep people completely panicking reality actually face. told us masks work beginning protect supplies Healthcare workers. harmed us long run though, believe people deserve know truth prepare worst-case scenario. play employment numbers want. evictions foreclosures tell real story. B/c reporting moronically dumb flawed. Case point pretty much anywhere, majority employers require double negative, tested weekly till point. friends tested over. guess what, time that's counted test regardless, positive oh look another case. ER docs fam well nurses know, two street alone covid icu wings Broward people tested 3, 5, 10+ times, could 1 person throwing multiples multiples ""test"" ""positive cases"", imagine spread around numbers stats make 0 sense except keep media fear mongering going. Let alone amount people trusted personal choice. Heck even CDC admitted estimated 20 million have/had entire time, showing kesss risky based %, watch month, they'll pry double on. 

Yet notice media always leaves true, actually sick covid patients #s, b/c fit agenda. hospitals actually busier flu back 17/18 covid entire time, straight mouths doctors nurses. Yet shut down, financially destroy people businesses, heck even immune deficient people went lives normal. know two people immune deficiencies caught covid19, much worse flu two years ago this. Another clients 19yr daughter got spent time hospital flu well vs covid 3-4 weeks ago. Another friend tested positive week feeling little sick June, also sick Jan Nov thought dying (no joke), said even remotley bad previous sickness, word word doctor ""it's bad portrayed be"". Look states done ""can"" considered covid case, ridiculous, let alone let's even get flawed bs death counts marked covid related regardless. 

That's say virus dangerous, def overreaction. 

I tell first hand here, truly sick covid patients majority elderly, beyond unhealthy, underlying heath conditions, heavy smokers etc. talk nurse day, said common point really sick icu wings covid heavy smokers heath conditions, people general even cold like getting hit mack truck then. actually officer die it, also released health issues, weight etc, actually put desk duty taken street due that.

Let's even get cluster fuck areas like NY morons furloughed much nursing staff beyond short handed red flags throwing sedation etc causing complications deaths. Honestly here, furlough elective procedure employees, furlough staff around. two neighbors working basically overtime 3 months short staff South FL hospitals.

This mishandled IQ 10 bumbling cluster fuck around hospital admin level statisticians/analysis teams actual reporting, states, cdc/who/face-palming flip flopping Fauci
...but media blame this.

We legit morons running/jogging, South FL summer heat/humidity, mask (aka one remotley near lol) passing heat. B/c people convinced 2nd step foot outside gunna die. Meanwhile take risk driving every single day many years decades, day day out. surfing. mortality rate miniscule ""epicenter"" live someone told % risk attacked shark time, bat eye.

I'm still proactive good hygiene however like anyone be. Even gym, wear mask, clean disinfect weights equipment (your given bottle) etc. yet entire time, can't trace really anything gyms here, even last 4-6 weeks open, 2 cases they've entire time, shutdown, 4-6 weeks open. people Reddit adament Gym death trap lol, were, especially open month now, they'd cases traced anywhere else.... Nope, still grocery stores, Lowes, Walmart etc. likely also b/c people gym 99% time far healthier aren't, already proven heather even less risk covid is. remember gyms shutdown FB could scroll reading comments people like ""gyms bad"" ""I understand people workout, why?"" ""I would never go gym general""... Meanwhile pictures look like sit couch eating potatoe chips day never 1oz exercise life lmao Keep beaches open Can't say deserve tbh... Good riddance. Sorry, empathy ran month ago. It’s going get worse tens hundreds thousands people streets due evicted. Unfit lead usual method 15 mph hazard lights palpitations. They’ll vaccinate vulnerable first I’m assuming. Elderly people. Underlying health conditions. 20k next Thursday? Remember? say like past. read thread, STILL saying despite this. USA!! AmericA first. shining trump tower shining trump tower. lily pond allegory

if pond full 100th day, day half-full seem alarming Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  like turtles still think vaccine possible think square circle, opens door respiratory viruses.

But right unprecedented.

Another thing love Smallpox example possible without international commitment via WHO. choppy sentences like stroke victim Yeah shut indoor bars lot spread occurs im hoping we'll good gj Americans I’m in, send link. accustomed rolling hills nothing New England Mid-Atlantic, seeing snowcapped mountains like visited Colorado still quite sight. (Mt. Washington New Hampshire tree-line alpine tundra zone I've never near enough time year might visible snow summit none valleys below.)  think people wear government would tell us to. pro mask I've worn one couple times going shopping, etc, experience leads people keeping distance 'because wearing mask anyway' getting hostile you. really wear one anymore reason. government's unfortunately adamant saying masks useful public health institute also taken recommendation use masks.. people say opening isn’t good rich. That’s literally want WWE various media companies sports leagues want run playoffs Florida, since state lax rules (i.e. easily bought) rich worry mundane activities like budgeting. kind person probably go much anyway! Recall Desantis hospital videos Wuhan places nearby insane. We're seeing lot South America now. Replace whatever word want makes difference. like aspect employment work there. son born 2018 brutally hard me, likely won’t even remember it. Yeah, like said, anyone brain would get it... dangerous! thought main problem administration's handling pandemic, amplified press, makes things lot worse.   love see folks Drastic action..

The way fix would hard lockdown two months states time.

Including dear leader going front camera, putting mask telling moronic followers wrong patriotic American wear mask.

Like that's going happen.. lol no, dont society set system care citizens properly times crisis. pandemic gets political. question addressed federal representatives agencies. scientific study found average extra time spent indoors 11 minutes due riots. quite enough meal beach day. 

So mass gatherings don’t spread virus science used justify it? can’t outdoor concert? Thankfully scientists proved large gathering thousands people spread virus. 

Gatherings either spread don’t. cannot qualify based worthiness cause matter much conflicts beliefs. cases common cold 😂😂 everyone Disneyworld opens 9 days schools start first week August.

reminder muricans would gotten shit together right get-go could shit without much issues. True, frankly lot people hurting financially. like people uninsured can't afford it. live name arguing bad faith. fun that. ICU beds max out, 2-3 week lag deaths shortens somewhat .. importantly case fatality rate increases. implying scientists lie enough evidence?  like yelling world “hold beer” primary care doctor? needs consult see candidate antiviral interventions. they're scarce &amp; still undergoing testing meds doled specific at-risk patients. Also see pick pulse-ox monitor ebay locally. want monitor O2 level frequently, especially 60+ demographic. Middle-aged elderly go labored breathing unresponsive couple hours. wasn’t underprivileged growing all, didn’t much extra money. never went camp. spent summers grandparents. Mostly mom’s parents, we’d always sent dad’s parents horrible weeks. flu; juggernaut hellbent killing host. ""If there, know received medical intervention?""
Because patients hospice treated try get well again, given palliative care ease suffering. That's kind hospice means. case facility would also need document care provided. think sad first place court appointed 3rd party decide family dispute, know details case leading that. estimate far high. estimate can’t find 260k-620k annually. SurprisedPikachu Maybe apply Six Degrees Florida Separation.... 1.8-1.9 million active cases US.

\* can't conclusively say many active many people test positive never take second test confirm recovered. Hurricanes actually encourage quarantining, though. Rep. Biggs wants shutdown covid task force. Guess party belongs to... Sure numbers flu season lol. counted entire year would 500k-1000k killed *seasonal flu* Take upvote. whenever see admin think chucklefucks. say stay home forever? believe did. people assume thats way? countries better job also preserving economies. chose unnecessary death weak economy. Big brain moves sure. work Asia! leadership shit arent allowed assistance save lives? fewer people plane already making safer. blocking middle seats least effect...  Ironic. can. 🙂 majority things based individuals. Government businesses try want say X individual it. blame state failures society murder could done things chose to.

I'm fairly certain doctors treating things. put blame medical facilities things stated medical level, except maybe PPE stockade.

Here's question, are, point hospitals overwhelmed, affirmative initiatives work? save individual might survive another five years save individual might survive another fifty? called triage reason there's reason used war. war. blame doctors? battlefront. battlefront us. ones war, killing other. want call murder, it, murderer along rest us. moral licensing here. society's fault, one else's. know happens assume right? mother must told you. agree must remain vigilant. reddit headlines push doom gloom narrative.

Maybe canada shut 6 weeks numbers reflect that. Imagine making brand new account talk politics reddit. online schooled reading keeps up... math got stay top suffer. Flash cards help some. school gave access i-Ready (or something similar) make 'em stick hour week it. Khan academy good math programs too... (sorry - ""that mom"" directed you! reading like, aallll studies online vs person schooling lately!) point cut allowed fester juices over. They've shown give fuck anyone anything else beaches money made school districts afford lawsuits would come though? Worldometer says worst day 11.6k infections. university pushing full steam ahead reopening. won’t even confirm stop instruction person Thanksgiving...

This states need put feet say can't reopen students. Teach online all. know inconvenience lot people tough shit. Rubio said “only” 5% people get die. Even though number high, seems OK it.

5% death rate catastrophically high death rate disease. Flu kills thousands every year 0.1%. 5% death rate world changing population loss. 5% death rate 350 million people dying worldwide, entire population US disappearing map. saying over. going season.... NBA...NHL...MLB...NFL...College Football...College basketball... 

None them.  shit real. didn’t go away summer arrived sun came out. 

The shit hit fan going crazy experiment season. absolutely true. father recently passed away hospice, physician seen many patients die hospice care. PERSON stops eating. body dying longer wants food. even stop drinking week passing away. give IV fluids, often get bloated lungs fill fluid, since kidneys working get rid fluid. CANCEL FOURTH someone living Alabama, still think may overblown. statements made council meeting screamed satanic panic they’ve refused issue statements regarding parties. 

Do think someone Covid went party, probably. think it’s city council making be, probably not. wanted point lot people will. feel like important differentiate people ""canonballing"" voluntarily forced.

Do problem pointing out? map shows Europe already outbreak, southern US not. Despite far fewer cases per capita, big European outbreaks many deaths per capita US. say pot? People Georgia:""But...but would mean collehe football!!!"" analogy. 

I stole [this Trump literally came morning speech said governor's asking anything point. 

Gone Easter! Get high horse.

I watched close relative die bone cancer.

Yeah, doped full morphine final days...but drag suffering point need obliterate senses weeks pass?

I want spend last weeks suffering full weight body shutting morphine induced coma. want spend years suffering alzheimer's dementia. want option able call quits get terminal disease quality life finished.

Shame trying say suffer ravages disease accept morphine comas weeks/months/even years spare fragile feelings.

\*Fuck trying perpetuate social frameworks leave options choke every last tortured breath bite bullet. That's fair point. I'm familiar experience. guess Hooter's worth dying for! Must one hell bartender get risk life.   lmao back march levels incompetence unpreparedness mean sure could blame politicians opening everything people much blame. could still stay inside could still wear masks going result. EVERYONE blame stupidity. political something federal government do, can’t fema national guard step assist hospitals, set tent icu, something. congress still hasn’t done anything since 1200$. Companies filing bankruptcy left right, I’m dooms-day spreader getting ridiculous, wish congressman maximum terms, since don’t often run unopposed history repeats itself. daughter, too! I’d honestly rather brother play video games couple hours day tv. video games least they’re engaged problem solving reading Florida already 159k cases based quick google 10k cases day doubling every 7 take less 8 weeks whole population infected. survivors laughing achieve herd immunity bug, feature..

I'll see out. Same. I’m reading people complaining getting norovirus, I’ve flaring UC migraines. agree stomach bugs suck horribly! Disneys paid college internship program. agree. one seems give fuck. Someone nice enough provide link donate. can’t give much totally support happy donate. seeded lot infections. Mass exodus lockdowns Northeast. lot snow birds thought healthy New York Boston. want locked bailed. reason I’m defending protests due comparison party. wise given current situation, one forgivable other. 

While would absolutely better option people crowding streets, much leg stand terms “forgivable” people getting together get drunk.

People treat masks way scientific evidence shown us effective. taking streets demand reform regards police practices isn’t last resort would warrant use masks, don’t know else would considered one. 

And people protesting civil rights climate change movement lost credibility? come conclusion?

You claim left lost standing right literally storming state capitals month ago couldn’t get haircut. You’re mind. data many tests administered times? is, rate growth probably accurately represented numbers have, totals probably low.

I think important though. right, exponential growth formula probably predictably close accuracy. idea multiplier (2x? 5x?). Yep. good sub finally slowly turning things around. Still waiting happen topics though. Thank you. sad time.  Take good, people readily going gather yet. least use mask keep low risk exposure/contagion. Found old screenshot dashboard website. failed that, too.

This failure acknowledged. Shocked Kirk Meme get tested grocery store, within walking distance, anytime drive-thu test couple nearby locations. Swab antibody tests. Y'all need real heathcare. Smart move They. Were. Warned. realised problem may Americans mad math understand concept.  citizen USA rest world please favor block travel nation, basically histories largest plague ship point save cause sure fuck ain't gonna help. would apply covid, flu, common cold viruses. I'm talking common sense, actual law. Thanks, Roy. find bad news flair. insane, many people country care much money make second, realizing reopen like get worse worse. 

They think economy recover we're dealing next year, many corpses people wake fuck up? whole event shown Americans need mandatory high school class dedicated basic statistics. Seems like Arizona vs Florida. Good luck everyone else Looking response people’s mindsets towards something like COVID, makes wonder bad something like climate change starts ravaging way life. People still deny still won’t change. Humans worst enemy humans deserve what’s coming us. Please stay Boston keep trying convince wear mask limit going out! It’s frustrating! Supposedly gyms really pose much problem long distancing measures met masks worn. Ahhhh, [R. Budd method calming people down. gonna automatically double every week every person infected state? might pipe dream, maybe dust settles we'll see decrease anti-science/anti-intellectualism.  Hard call deadly virus hoax too, fair. found way. 

Harvey make Trump look bad, hoax. Maria's devastation Puerto Rico made Trump look bad, lots people saying death numbers inflated hoax. 

They care degree think hard rational people even grasp. defines lot things. We're flooded Texans wear masks. Bless sweet baby. ❤️ I’m sorry experience this. Statistically speaking without lockdowns, social distancing, people wearing masks, etc. infect 2-3 people get virus. Even mind dying myself, want take others me. Thank you. would love contribute.  Go Florida go!!! You’re number 1! 🥇🥇 

Oh wait.. really wish like countries right now... Includes confirmed cases throughout pandemic [YOU GUYS READY GO DISNEY *Overall in-hospital mortality 18.1% (95% CI:16.6%-19.7%); treatment: hydroxychloroquine + azithromycin, 157/783 (20.1% [95% CI: 17.3%-23.0%]), hydroxychloroquine alone, 162/1202 (13.5% [95% CI: 11.6%-15.5%]), azithromycin alone, 33/147 (22.4% [95% CI: 16.0%-30.1%]), neither drug, 108/409 (26.4% [95% CI: 22.2%-31.0%])​. Primary cause mortality respiratory failure (88%)*

I'm doctor, looks like antibiotic (azithromycin) gave 22.4% mortality rate, adding HCQ reduced 20.1% mortality rate.


Maybe lesson - antibiotics helpful comes respiratory pneumonia? dash HCQ perhaps adds slight advantage, also proven dangerous? Always remember:

**""Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!""**

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

Our government officials got wrong start, people died result.

He part problem. needs accountable words. ""I'm willing sacrifice 1 20 you."" voted it, enjoy it. poor much they're willing die it, stop them? buy existing t-bills (or ETF t-bills) open market. yield great, 0.

Welcome grown up. offer solutions this, assure job prospects ability work employment wish helped wrecking economy. Oh man, great point. Science NEVER changed thinking anything. Science observe tell us best information based latest available data anything... /S

Stop stupid. Obviously medical advice change research done. people around wear mask take precautions, much. Something something flu. Something something freedom. know peasants need go back work care die. - Florida find ridiculous. take kids daycare putting people risk. right call here. Awww least fun somebody 😊 Also, past, bailing corporations banks result mass amount unemployment evictions - least scale we're going seeing here. Seems since worked they're going keep putting money lobbyists' pockets without thought towards average citizen actually able handle crisis financially. /r/theydidthemath Remember long ago NY hospitals storing bodies refrigerator trucks? feel like people decided forget Yep, that's good one! almost always subs default, stopped complaining likes reading now. half way stop site. reason wont hit number due lack testing. significant probably file workers comp claim employer deal mental stuff. Winning! SC governor's office said can't good faith allow spectator sports outside (even reduced capacity). really problem fact he's opened like indoor events, require masks, etc. allow things good faith? say that's pretty impressive. least trying hide outright. Start Flu season usually October, wait people getting flu covid time. going national health crisis like we've never seen. states try keep economies open literally filling morgues leaders' hubris. happens entire political party built around misinformation political gain people start run party also consume misinformation College instructor here. looking forward hordes 18 year olds back campus. Idk chief one ""letting"" people anything. grown ass adults unable parse truth fiction. cannot save people No, really have. completely invisible lockdowns, letting director general handle press conferences. ...and 45 going tweet later day. specifically, never understood people watch movies once. I'm bit Chernobyl buff, lived all, may make exception one see again. Everyone know Florida can't count. Hell look number excess pneumonia/flu deaths attributed COVID likely we've nearly 4,500 deaths due COVID reported due COVID. 3,000 deaths reported due COVID.

I'm Florida trust single number ever come Florida face value. Unless confirmed someone outside independent would assume number coming Florida tampered with. matter election, COVID, anything else. Yeah, Disneyland CA, governor actually gives shit stopping spread. allowed reopen they'd tried. Maybe infectious people ""recover"" finding long term possibly permanent health problems may never recover again. 

At rate going could shit load people country varying life long health problem think cause even bigger issue deaths. hoping business show modicum compassion flexibility unprecendented temporary global emergency really bad thing? This. Also, reopen *slowly*. Italy places still cannot play 5vs5, ac indoor banned. first reopening “yeah maybe see wife kids. region is. Ah also still visit friends”.

Then 2-3 weeks “yeah maybe see friends leave home, everything still closed”.

After 2-3 weeks “ok restaurants maybe open distancing. Ah also always keep mask would 500 usd fine”.

Which basically now. Quite different Us did, especially regarding travel restrictions. Italy could leave city limits like 2 months. 

I think explains difference. decided take week vacation sister lives Georgia (I'm Maryland) giving great deal anxiety. certain places rare find someone, besides me, wearing mask. Many people catch might immediately realize much virus damaged body, regardless whether ICU mild symptoms all.

Luckily millions people Covid, recovered, tell us experiencing. needs stop find interesting. Florida’s cases per million people deaths per million people little bit superior Western European countries, actually far far superior. good thing see cases increasing like this? No. something tells Florida remain lower Western European countries least deaths per 1 million people and, that’s case, would whole world justified laughing Florida? Yeah, math one area she'll need supplemental assistance. Thankfully, apps world help - school gave us free student account educational portal math-centric games LOVES playing. Wow, maybe god. so, said diety hates Florida naw, idiot raw materials penny worth penny last checked. haul unwrapped nearest scrap processor ~$7.5 million dollars done it. labor supplies wrap Buying lob certs 90gp, selling lob certs 130gp actually decreased testing past days. ramped ~50k tests/day dropped back ~35k test/day can't believe see America, used respected leaders free world. Get act together! desperately need leadership new political system based greed. Stop buying guns respect humanity. country going backwards direction heading mediaeval. sake families ware mask! Comments news website entertaining. DoD issued stop movement couple months ago, service components pushed individual protective measures. Locally restricted 100mi base, leave outside that, restaurants base, gyms, barbers, theaters, mall, shopping, travelling local area unless essential needs.


We spent 8-9 weeks could get morning go run (avoiding people) work home. Every 3-4 days leave house/base go walmart mask'd bought essentials, went home. Two weeks ago things opening back (restaurants) lower level command came ""no"" reasons.

  Big brain numbers states? seem reported slowlier day day. USA Brazil 2 countries bad now? anymore countries bad? something like $1500 flowers week. got touch asked donate charity instead want work. Like real work. make coffee, flip burgers, minimum wage. Real work. don’t want live paycheck paycheck working dead end jobs we’re “service economy”. contact district representative two weeks ago. I’m one feels way. I’d rather steal eat everyday clock minimum wage Starbucks job beholden dumbshit entitled snowflakes can’t make fucking coffee.

Your argument shit people ready willing work. don’t realize actual fucking work done country. don’t need counter points they’re unfounded lack evidence. public health perspective, yes. Presumably parents gonna need send kids daycares now, right middle pandemic's peak Florida. Daycares schools hotspots transmitting viruses.  article make sound like it’s something proud of? people ever bother look around. 130,000 dead.. perhaps many 150,000 permanent health consequences, serious disabling. that's even looking beyond U.S. borders ask would much burden them. re-running summer. It’s damn near perfect situation. Super Impressive units best units! Nobody wants make moms children going Disney world disappointed angry. 

Or something fact Disney biggest employer Orlando area... lot less available information back then. Nobody knew mortality rate 0.5% 5%. significantly data risk precautions minimize chance infection. sounds like mostly Disney/I-Drive area Orlando, crappy parts Miami/Fart Louderdale, and/or one retirement places like Villages. Try Sarasota, Key West, Mount Dora, Cassadaga, Lake Placid (yeah, there's one Florida too), Gulfport, Cocoa, St. Augustine. I'd say Daytona Beach certain character, too, everyone. There's place like anywhere else world.

Even bigger cities, areas could reasonably described bland lacking identity. Orlando, there's Longwood, Maitland, Winter Park, Celebration. In/around Miami there's South Beach West Palm Beach. think there's part greater Tampa area that's without character interest -- even downtown area. Right even optics don’t plan contact tracing , collecting contact info world good. no.  around anyone 4 months really without mask.. may science. hate people walk store say feel bad work conditions right ordering scoop fucking vanilla ice cream.

you, motherfucker, dumb ass I'm here. fuck fake sympathy shit. Congratulations?  don’t like people’s children.

Edit: I’m going business model provided day care received child, someone worked state went regulations, random teenager thinks know things work. tried vote in. lost popular vote. Literally take well. NBA prob edging factor though. MLB well, given games essentially held covid hotspots (bubble not). 
It's matter *IF* *WHEN*. sucks. 
*edit - NFL, probably seeing two stumble. 4 begin there’s effective therapeutic vaccine COVID-19, according Baker.

Damn Charlie! like it, I’ve got feeling he’ll face backlash one...if immediately time. I’m reading right means Phase 3 we’ve got coming Monday things possibly well 2021. 

For love God everyone please thing right, let’s phase 3 cause clusters rise cases eh? I’m worried Cape Vineyard tbh, huge touristy areas I’m seeing one following distancing masks there. Vineyard specifically, Jaws taught us 4th big one Vineyard. Muh Freedom crowd pressured Newsom opening early i'll never know day work end killing grandma :) did, countries like U.S. refused follow suits late. penis America. fitting.

&amp;nbsp;

Is considered incivility too? 😂 listen, that's point view, fine - right. However, regards communicable disease, carefree disposition potential harm others. simple answer, please take care. yes, aren’t slaves employers nobody office grinding 8 hrs straight. accounted salary work expectations. way office going drag us back soon despite rising numbers again. pay us us shhh. dont question narrative. That's fair. I'm intending blame experts general, like said original post think individuals largely responsible self educating. also think number failing CDC pandemic contributing people's loss faith experts. things true. India collection different countries. Asking co-operate together would like asking EU states work together. leaving Disney decide. parents live Florida topic came up, response ""it's they're testing more. real numbers watch hospitalizations they're staying steady""

Why blind obvious? response give they'll listen blow off? Agree much. heard recovery feeling like lungs stone. getting pneumonia awful. thankyou. Masks social distancing friends. 

Do every get people say "" oh bet wear mask car"". Ugh. dares challenge Muricas Covid superiority? numbers huuge! WARNING: OP misinformation. spread around internet antisemitic, anti-transgender, conspiracy supporter also trying claim fluoride causes autism. based simple one minute skim recent posts.

For health safety others, BELIEVE POST! Around school care YMCA school sliding scale income. Max $300/month, low income families pay lot less. wealthy families ton kids paying anything close $1000 week. better yet, florida liberal leaders coming saying hate masks would probably get people Yes think happened memorial day much popular 4th July celebrate. Buckle want weigh situation much. know could type 1 pancreatic dysfunction. know leadership failed give good advice phase back social life post lockdown, medicine failed give good advice/treatment regarding conditions.

But that's super important take extra precautions preexisting condition puts elevated risk. People specifically told ministry allowed drive bike park  really get it. hard Americans wear masks? RIP Massachussets September study literally says 1 3, 30%. extremely rare? 

Also fuck off. fear mongering. want people safe die. going suck bit, vaccines horizon. 

The people fear mongering ones saying ""The virus going part lives forever""

Those people fucking stupid. wear fucking mask already. Yes, Mexico worried border crossings know US fallen grace.

This headline priceless. Another user reported first translation part got deleted. show like me, see thread (going backwards) Yes lot taken care nobody. left alone. parents literally choice, option. one kid. could eat food starve, sleep four walls roof back car, choice mother make. know Florida testing stats? know Texas counting probable cases including anybody contact tested individual. addition counting antibodies. 

Is Florida counting antibodies? also counting probable cases?  Poor XFL. genuinely enjoyed last iteration well enough. could financially survive halfway first season. Bigger leagues obviously bounce back. XFL's timing real unfortunate. Brazil Mexico would like word federal government actually supported people instead corporations, people probably would lot willing stay home 2 months. Instead, used UI system deliberately broken several states - preventing millions getting paid - gave people single $1200 payment - many people still haven’t received. Selfish fucks going fucking selfish. surprise here. entitled, impotent, low lifes think important others. FUCK YEAH, WIN! definitely steroids past many, many wrestlers nowadays actually pretty straight edge. You’re likely find streaming game Twitch popping pills partying. Watch 2 kids make now. Go it.

Or find daycare better value, go there.

Dog daycares charge $25 day. Oh classic needed confirm bias headline, perhaps best judge credible. there’s perception people rushed-to-market vaccine feel it’s safe get. no, asking **you** think death total resets **you** get estimates. 

It's clear understand works. Florida canceled USC sent similar email..... probably right, shame. came together common good, can't even imagine awesome lives could be. would divine. happened nicer guy - crime crimes also attending Tulsa trump rally mask got yr mom odds ho peek Common sense equip person think terms exponential growth. Math education needed that. ...like US current administration?  Ahem....we ran test kits, decreased testing ;) Nobody wearing them. live Miami see dozens people day wearing mask, police go right them. 

If look submissions youll see people disagreeing posted people needing wear them. Fuck Ron DeSantis... blood hands... let’s keep schools, beaches restaurants bars open... can’t let economy die.. Yeah need transparency. well least still rights freedoms! /s fully aware.

I extensive knowledge due work. loosen rules home daycare. wife ran home daycare many years. safe place. Yes ruling class decades starving beast, better way take regulatory power away state make seem broken dysfunctional. Added bonus desperate labor force soon forced take whatever job salary get, biggest two oppositional forces profit -state regulation labor even weakened. Wonder market well crises? 

. do. Abbott Patrick deserve life prison.  Wait numbers 4th July :) Europe made right call. states refuse Floridians? love expression. Branch Covidian 

Olive you! India relatively poor country. difference 1,000 100,000 huge enough warrant name hence use ""lakh"", 1,00,000.

100 times lakh also significant jump hence use Cr.

These terms use British changing what's hundreds years make sense.

That said, hope eventually get rid system move international system regular proper 10³ breaks instead 10³ 10² 10² India uses. Though make much sense local languages I'm sure go.. one hundred thousand ( ek sau hazar ) sounds odd. True, agree assessment. woke...


So brave... franchisee ton debt service. financial problems would manifested even without pandemic. Pizza still popular, always competitive business low margins.

They still crappiest major chains, IMO. Domino's great job recipe overhaul back. Pizza Hut cheap/frozen lots deals businesses, like Target airports personal pizzas breadsticks.  Yet know metres are! Colour impressed! There's need publish phase 2. testing slowed down.

[Florida's coronavirus cases slowed cases smart idea. _WEB SHERIFF_ entered chat I'm going pull map, perhaps literally mean ""adjacent"". OC, Riverside, San Diego, San Bernardino, North SF Valley pretty conservative, basically surround LA. INDEPENDENCE MASK DAY! Black man attends clan rally, surprised negative consequences. cant wait headlines come 6 months now, “faulty testing kits reported false positives months”. poor leadership equals poor results. imagine big gonna 4-6 weeks chickens really coming home roost. scary shit. 

&amp;#x200B;

and STILL people actively going way flaunt social distancing, avoid mask wearing, etc Sorry Trump major factor virus spread. ordered citizens wear masks long ago. feel lucky punk? pathetic thing toxic right wing vermin like perpetuating idiotic bullshit calling everyone six brain cells ""sheep"". Fuck off, dipshit. didn’t personally know anyone tested positive prior 6/26. know 8 people it. Every person know got virus last two weeks got bar, believe bars closing significantly reduce numbers. I’m including timeline time got help explain think numbers seeing today still include many bar transmissions.

6/19: contracted without knowing

6/21: woke body weakness lethargic

6/22: running mild low-grade fever

6/24: informed friend 6/19 weren’t feeling well gone get tested; sinuses began acting up

6/25: began lose sense smell taste

6/26: completely lost sense smell taste; friends confirmed tested positive

6/27: went go get tested line long closed could

6/28: got tested (still haven’t gotten results back yet); wouldn’t test minor ped wasn’t present

6/29: went get minor child tested got second test done waiting 2.5 hours 600+ vehicle line

7/1: received results 6/29 test (me positive, minor negative)

7/2: official state numbers released public officially include positive result received 7/1

So, anyone else followed similar timeline get tested did, numbers seeing bars closed again. next two weeks, likely see start curve back down. Fuckbook tell shit. ever. Zucko fucko. comply.

Masks? yeah whatever, wear mask. Fuckoberg? Nah. hear you. frustratingly dumb!!!!! Omg!!!! current leader, Obama stopped ebola swine took off. would still bad beginning, would home stretch president. god bless america  Here:

 

 

 

 

 

 isn’t bigger news?

Stories like this: talked about. Wear mask. could use sympathy tbh. I’ve burned nearly savings can’t operate business safely, don’t qualify assistance, live alone city moved recently, people main support losing minds &amp; I’m still staying home. Word yo mutha Good. thought American Wrestling pretend show actually hit hard. means FIVE HUNDRED people tested positive Thursday — 

— NEW CASES THURSDAY — 

— going DIE. 

Next week TWICE many — thousand people sentencing death DAILY. 

How dare you? 

At point right thing let blackmailers release photos. whatever makes act way. 

Suggesting you’re blackmailed extremely charitable.

Edit: got automodded naming names y’all know polity addressing. I'd shocked Disney reopened. bad publicity subsequent lawsuits new infections crushing. Yeah 10k day

We fucked :(  I'm sure is. frequent HyVee, Dillons go pretty similar story. Ha. Good one ♪ Wake up,

when 2020 ends ♪ season US, runs October May**, claims tens thousands lives every year. season CDC estimates that, mid-March, 29,000 59,000 died due influenza illnesses.


Source article posted..... What, you’re already tired winning? Everyone talk (in conservative area) believes: 

1) 80% people asymptomatic.

2) Asymptomatic people spread it. 

3) virus mutated deadly anymore. one even goes ICU anymore either unless 100 years old already dying.

They truly believe everything fine. cannot understand people freaking it. Unfortunately, seems like America identity crisis. I’d argue America plutocracy rising nationalistic tendencies ... more.. success story! work musician seasonal shows around property, they've told us they're opening shows back slowly. show reinstated, they'll week two refresher rehearsals, taking things one step time.

Most musicians ready; stages large enough keep social distancing check, many others also close together, also inside crowd congregations.

I'm still half-expecting cancel last second; gig national act 11th cancelled (it postponed March). things peaking CT said epidemiologists estimated probably 10x many cases compared positive test results. figures asymptomatic carriers, people still waiting get testing approved, people still waiting testing come back, people assume something else like flu thought get tested yet, etc. There's definitely WAY know sure. Funny lengths people go order defend scummy behavior. Says lot personal ethics morals. priest busy abusing kids, guess that's okay noticed priests to. That's stand. Absolutely! nothing else, situation made us face childcare situation really messed US, it’s great people already thinking creatively. Hopefully continue pandemic dies down. published freakin' genome. article fake news. got shit recently telling people wear masks public places. 

'It's walking trail dont need wear one, Karen""

Ugh. mention protesting, perfect storm. Lol good stuff! USA USA USA! NZ encouraged go daily walks bike rides lockdown, stay local. dashboard see (new cases)/(tested cases) trend. see new cases surge, death rate seem follow new cases surge. think telling new cases without telling many tested everyday makes sense. Imagine tested cases doubled everyday, new positive cases increases 10% everyday, probably considered good. lot places, people still care nothing enforced. 

Slap $20k fine people wearing one public, get attention. Damn, remember last week people kept saying worst watched TV news station took pandemic seriously. still don't. Much appreciated. 
We truly thank you. wearing mask, leading example, &amp; fighting battle can’t outside hospital doors. aren’t sending COVID patients nursing homes. knock estimates half. oh people _still_ adamantly believe hoax?? husband still messed sense smell.

Texas awhile, around 14%.

That means would need double testing, additional testing find cases. initially told everyone wear masks, ass   many people died?  What’s death rate? Want pull citation Fauci says ""masks work""? Seems quote ""There reason anyone walking around mask on."" two different statements. 

""Bat boy Fauci,"" grow up. Even SAID masks work, says do, hell going believe now? want angry something? communicable diseases prevented spreading masks effect on. one turns effect wear mask. one point said unnecessary, revises statement, going rail wearing masks still? made three angry comments understand single line February shorter months? Says who? i'm glad put lives first WTF headline? bet idea also much recent.

And hear Herman unspoken convention British politics one messed big time take accountability actions try minimize fallout party resigning. seen cases politicians caught mistress, love child financial scandals. commonwealth countries (like NZ) adopted convention.

Sorry we've spreading ourselves. can't figure people trouble understanding. 

Is Dead Leader's screeching voice powerful logic, reason sanity completely rattled heads? almost like schools respond changing data something Well, I'm going vacation next week. different state! But, vacation like ones people generally bragging taking. rented cabin mountains, son, girlfriend, entire week. Grocery shopping way contact outside world. vacation need right now. works healthcare (still screened gets back travelled state) tired work 24/7. people enjoy working home, feel like I'm actually living work since every time walk dining room right there. original vacation plan? No. get us away house work allow us relax? Yes. that's matters right now. enough, toss volcanos, earthquakes, maybe nuke plant meltdown, plus riots. Really get things shaking... Job goes away months, job comes back: ""This job created"". Fuck off. Ok, realize cases EU rise eventually try reopen too, right? inevitably situation that, without vaccine, there's trade-off coronavirus containment preserving economy. 

I think agree American Governors probably eager reopen, exactly long term alternative? outlawed masks except Kane masks.  obvious exception Harry Potter Land intentionally designed feel dense. Percent positive slightly dipped 15% 14.6% today.

Ideal percent positive around 3-5% (that is, want testing large enough subset population vast majority people test uninfected). Without hitting number, statistically likely missing major pockets infection thus under-counting disease.

One data scientist good job covering case found here: [positive rate low, crab fishing great world actual science gets many views pop-sci green-screen excitement? friend kill died next day? already virus quite sick begin with? they're fucking psychos. exaggerating. still going vendors (or 'infield stuff')? find information. think entirely possible. depends what, much, long immunity might last individual. yes, theory, would run vectors spread. think would take pretty long time however assuming everything perfect virus. Nah, soon worst pandemic over, stock market tank.

Because fuck us all, that's why. 100,000 new infections America every day, would take 6 years two thirds population infected, number generally regarded required 'herd immunity'.

Add fact research indicates antibodies virus last less year. look good photo. looking old weight world shoulders. hope recovers. son learned read playing Super Mario games. started reading told needed learn read himself! Lol. That's going tagline stupid long time. Alligators gotta eat too. Canada started virus time States, it’s interesting compare difference trajectory. province Ontario one worst hit still don’t indoor dining even though 153 new cases yesterday. Patios opened weeks ago. Beaches closed. Like Florida, soon restrictions relaxed people become far less cautious, it’s human nature. People forgetting social distance wear masks live I’m confident enough testing tracing know we’ll close necessary. done town nearby outbreak last week. also still borders completely closed since beginning least another month. People don’t qualify unemployment getting $2000 per month since beginning pandemic helped people stay home. It’s ideal 153 cases compared 10,000 something think about. Also, want even closer comparison, Florida Canada similar populations... entire country Canada total 253 cases two days ago. run hospital space significant infection level, point relatively low death rate becomes couple percentage points, Hospital/ICU cases get treated (of age groups).

So US, say get 200 million infected around time, 2% mortality that's 4 million people. cut ways, argue percentage rates, looking mega death. Maybe space 6 months, get half million million.

If want deaths, go Sweden, keep burning rate hospitals cope with, current rate see herd anytime soon.

Of course US look pretty bloody stupid vaccine pops Christmas, finishing 100ft new wall Mexico made dead bodies. Lmao panic? People haven’t panicked 130,000 deaths US people still want go clubs bars.

I don’t think news cause Americans even bat eyelash. point panic would good thing. funny people telling ""just wait 2 weeks"" thing past month now.

We seeing effects everything happening past month.

First various ""partial"" reopenings last month. big protests streets. First lockdown protests, BLM protests. ""fuller"" reopenings month.

And people kept saying ""just wait 2 weeks!"".

But number daily deaths continued fall.

And FOUR weeks later.

And looking *lowest number Covid deaths per day since whole thing started*.

*Normally* would good headline, right?

""Daily Covid deaths lowest point months!"" believe they're 14. 0 time virus acts like sleeper keeps popping up. believe many though people came outside isolated, quarantine, recent reported community spread. Maybe virus kinda died europe? clue. dutch CDC say 98% infections goes without mild symptoms.

There's actually less people dying previous year. forget literally some. lot people live remote mountains. close enough enough people covid 'huge' threat. hosts virus nearly front page say, NYC. Getting buy nothing relatively simple till case. Good Job Florida! really sticking Libs now! hope recovery huge wake call 

But won’t Yes, Indian English, 99% don’t know words mean. case fatality rate numbers China February. Extremely old data. much recent synopsis death rates. I’m saying data different go around. ever think maybe older people taking precaution now? it’s like Florida completely wide open. still restrictions many towns mandating masks own. hope stay way. serious question? question. Please understand actually inquiring know. believe disease real, question sound otherwise, promise im trying discredit it. 

Why numbers bad everything shut down? Everyone saying second wave (and think is) worse. Whats different? 

The stupid people wear masks: unchanged.

Restaurants open full tilt shut down: prior that, believe numbers bad. 

Why miss? 

Thanks! There's school th thought exposure previous coronavirus already given degree immunity large percentage population. many people asymptomatic.  appears plan place there. saying way things all, cant believe fucking ridiculously selfish people country being, think crazy see huge chunk country infected January. tough really picture quickly something grows exponentially go small percentage completely beyond fucked. Particularly country people feel sense responsibility humans, dangerous. 

People showing would rather people die wear mask. tutor suggestion older children need constant supervision. younger kids need constant supervision would daycare parents would paying anyway.

I doubt families truly options all, point probably majority. many others, positive could find good solutions would adjust budgets start brainstorming ideas. pandemic problem, response pandemic (reducing school hours). misdirected anger. use hospitals proxy -- two week delay numbers.

At point level fucked Florida beyond parody. could many dead seniors November swings election. ""I... looked cases Florida... think positives test results.""

""*You see positives.*""

""I did.""

*""You didn't.* **YOU DIDNT, THEYRE THERE**"" Vote. grandparents live went Massachusetts feels like got Canada shit got bad handmaid's tale USA USA USA! Congrats!

👏 Every 7 days pretty good things considered [a great video “captain” getting told coast people dumb enough spout people dumb enough problem Isn’t New Zealand currently zero cases? whole bunch fb posts see saying categorizing non covid deaths like cancer etc covid deaths.. Something nurses speaking silenced...
Who comes rumors.. purpose serve  always, wear mask people. HA! karma 2016 finally comes full circle... county (which made pretty much city) decided re-open restrictions memorial day despite fact second state number cases. argument people smart enough take care themselves. fastest rising number cases state governor called stupid.

Virologists:

*Out perfect virus, killing machine miracle evolution - floats air, makes people sick makes baby viruses, that's all. Look that! figures correct.*

Governors Florida, Texas, Arizona, etc.

*Oh, you’d love prove that. Get name Lanclet!* Thousands die flu every year, dude. Vaccines slow down, nothing that.

I'll wait list effective Coronavirus Vaccines. New York never hit 100k cases per day. highest 11k USA #1 Schools won’t open. It’s front. online till March. Hurray Florida one case turn pandemic, terminate spread  Florida Texas going kill us all. friends live life hide apartment play video games? exactly think over? never developed vaccine coronaviruses still deal common cold.

There HIV vaccine, treatments keep getting sick spreading others. 

I'm thing. I'm young healthy. get small odds dying even getting seriously ill. mean, extremely small. 

I'm going live fear give freedom.

This virus kills mostly people old sick. There's young people die number less amount people get killed traffic fatalities every year.

You sure using virus excuse hide home world? new covid deaths first time months! screaming laughing yelling. bad. bet. know quite people tested multiple times former New Mexican I've seen maps show case counts TX AZ creeping NM border counties. They're leaking! hope quarantine orders followed. Stay safe NM. swear that's learned lot stuff. Playing oldschool SNES RPGs kid. reading skills always several grades ahead, even though like math, good calculating damage comparing stats gear. games like Parasite Eve taught lot biology, games made really good reading maps navigating, let's even start understanding consequences actions learned empathy that.

Video games really beneficial. make sure plays variety non-mindless games, make sure gets enough exercise too. would terrified right realize dangerous assumption is. Population density New York makes difficult vulnerable protect generally; they'd even gotten message time. Mass transit multi generational homes recipe disaster. Older populations taken measures avoid disease, generally, younger people getting it.

We're also better treating disease since outbreak. Simple things like prone positioning kept people vents.

Also underestimate Florida's ability count.  Right doubling every 7 days 20K week. heard sure scroll bottom keep clicking next. really eye-opening. Source that? Fun fact: knew could infect others. didn’t give shit he’s lying try save face “You swim day Sea Knowledge still come completely dry. people do.” ― Norton Juster, Phantom Tollbooth Galveston beaches closed since last weekend believe. know closed now... isn’t anyone talking decrease overall deaths according CDC? Everyone acting like decrease covid deaths they’re misattributed pneumonia flu deaths causes significantly right now. (Yes, know could change...but looking much better NYC’s using minimize risk covid, hopefully debunk narrative covid deaths steadily increasing reason don’t see stats aren’t tested death. Unless figure they’re getting away counting deaths nobody noticing mean sad part place packed. Shows selfish people still go cares slow spread. Apparently, people still believe “liberty” important everyone else’s liberty. 

If think society asking infect neighbors stop threatening political opponents weapons infringing upon liberty, welcome go somewhere else “liberty”, like Siberia. vast majority infected neither death permanent injury thing.

These people playing odds.

What they’re shitty thinking risks imposing society around them. that’s norm quite now. federalism stupid I'm listening Michael Osterholm this, says said explicitly, anyone tells know what's going happen next, stop listening them. much pay Hey, tomorrow's another day! anyone makes choice selfish, choice, sacrifice people altar money self worship hole swallows soul. Humans capable responsible must make choice follow path. matter consequences. True leaders worry much money friends might make, stand front say 'I first' follow cloak. viper mourn passing. Keep safe can. boss doesn’t care you. care paycheck.  tell everybody, best turds ever, biggest- uncle known turds  Explaining would likely result post removed 'politics' google Linda McMahon Where's money 4 teachers?

In ideal world? police budgets getting cut due #defundthepolice.

But country obsessed trying police state, it'll never happen. Depends “you guys” is. northeast definitely kept restrictions place infection rates slowed. PA (in northeast) seeing slight uptick we’ll see sustains blip, generally state didn’t open much infection rates way down. Wait fun Q2 earnings reports... USA fine experiment, run course. twin fantasies national exceptionalism extreme individualism match hard reality biology. Growth? think mean like 2.5 million 40 million people actually got job back theory I've seen. saying accurate point hard imagine ever get back control...

People call lockdowns late, like happened New York. Hospitals overflowing. People already intubated hallways Texas. greatest sorrow far. Prior covid, hopes people would slowly come around climate issue could work solutions. chance. people willing accept crisis literally killing people around us hundreds thousands span months, chance people magically going care problem spans decades.

This also means intellectually equipped society deal questions around AI future. think AI necessarily become ""problem"" need talk order pursue responsibly.

There enough brain users problems really starting show. Big oof Idiots Interesting. thoughts sample size subject population? understand concern, Reuters wire service--it exists sell stories publications. Wherever see story, Reuters getting paid it. Exactly correct. option opt out, are. ones tested positive regardless whether season not. isolate, recover, get right back it. precautions taken leagues far beyond anything done protect $12/hr employee, guys take care money. play, they'll fine. I'm sure glad make face masks 

* material that's lab tested almost N95
* design that's lab tested pass respirator fit test.
 
Plus made super-mask version another layer.

And bought safety googles get sold out.

Also years ago trained touch face hands I'm outside.

I guess could get it. would surprise hell me. Yeah, would seriously concerned, hospital way prepared handle lot cases. Everyone would need moved Harrisburg. parade fireworks either - exponential though, larger case number today means faster rate replication overall. updated doubling time projection known cases extreme boundaries projection would much faster growth rate. 

In words *could* see doubling 5 6 days. wait see. School begins first week August? system earth  You’ll peak much Murica you’ll get tired peaking. MLB BACK!!!!!!!!


........never mind Disney back down. Given obsessive attention corporate image, they're going tolerate park associated disease outbreak. said, plenty businesses Florida give particular shit. simple - models bad. CDC says estimated 10x cases - would effectively lower CFR 10x.   someone rode bike lot Miami, remember first time saw ""hills"": landfills. live Central Florida. totally unaware places open. anything less essential amusement park? Except wealth, double down. saw Mommy intubating Saaaaanta Claus lot GOP politicians giving GOP policies actually making things worse. Woah woah woah. You’re saying regulation good thing? thought regulation stifled commerce entrepreneurial spirit crushing liberty freedom.

/s (obligatory, never know people days) live north metro area usually count masks one hand shopping Cub. neighbors held large graduation parties every weekend month June. deaths COVID Isanti county. Nope. fact percentage positive tests increasing means catching fewer cases. Nice! hope virus job remove many supporters. Florida marvelous place long read news. Plenty crazy shit happens New York, there's ""New York Man"" meme, get attention.

Low cost living, lots diversity, great weather, low taxes, lots things outdoors, plenty entertainment. Loss even percent lung capacity could career ending players. fact quarantined effectively stupid, let alone thinking season plans. 

The thing making PSAs telling fans want games need wear masks stop spread virus. go hand first hand experience, impulse caused less overhead? Nothing wrong it. Barr huge enthusiasts *Rapture*, predicted return Jesus planet Earth right wrongs. Please vote religious wingnuts.  Congrats guys, that's awesome. know easy all. Illinois brought cases ICUs getting quiet. brother sent video empty Covid unit. patients. nurses. beautiful.

And I'm concerned long lasting. hope people hold fuck up, love God. April nightmare. likely get light case, die, go worry reason. see getting better... already almost late shit. Disney wont open Incidence exponential mortality rate (confirmed covid only, including pna, influenza) stayed level around 50 deaths per day since March. probably check hospitalization rates posting this, anyone explain finding? There’s multiple things worry this. Like, NBA restarting don’t see works even bubble system cases spiking much. family also planning trip around Christmas, rate don’t think gonna go risk getting put ventilator lol sad.... one thing i've noticed SoCal ppl live outside urban core LA (like Lake Elsinore dude resided) seem taking less seriously. may mask go shopping, chatting neighbors. Many expanded household ""circle"" include family members close friends. since Memorial Day they've seeing members extended circles regularly, think nothing it. small gatherings less 10, ppl get lulled complacency, sense false safety, tragic results.  many Americans first experience triage medicine 

Yes kids. physician literally power grant death or...hope delay get woods. 

No physician enjoys stare census decide gets care. look admit say “sorry, don’t get tube”. That’s fun. That’s crippling. 

But hey. America really wants play life hardest difficulty possible Desantis talking big game recently weeks ago. Didnt go well I’m Florida right yes is. least Key West is.  People going die kinds celebrations parties. Probably people attending party, parents, grandparents people come contact with.

It would fine virus control, experiencing exact opposite. many old people one place it’s likely thin herd flatten curve. Yeah remember absurd bubble plan sounded NBA first announced it. thought gonna let Disney employees leave bubble though. working Disney NBA? Fauci: go back lockdown

Florida: done bait troll choppy sentences like stroke victim Quit yer Bullshit. know yesterday's american academy pediatrics report kids really spread covid. /s - funny haha.

 likely adult child transmission child child. -This statement scientific postulation one would need scientific evidence.

 Truth time study peer review yet means one knows facts. fact 300 kids Texas sick time authority figures corporations pushing us send teachers children school ""ASAP!"" scared children , family teachers. ""This likely adult child transmission child child."" minimizing real concerns. Remember concern relevant personally real. Family life death matters concern us. Actually, doubling. We're testing less people last week. Americans right thing... usually trying everything else first.  Yes, must counting dead attributing access mortality Covid19, it’a thing effect numbers. TBH true major urban center. raise kids middle big career moves working big city building financial base. people know kids + house bay late careers salaries easily afford both. There's reason lot bay area people move places like Houston/Austin - there's enough space allow families still employ enough tech jobs mean career go pause raise family. Things nice past 4 years. 3000 die 9/11 attacks: Shut. Down. EVERYTHING!! 

100,000 die Corona: fine. small percentage population. blaming “liburls” it. insanely slow, little information new data, feels worse.  1/3 way there! Well yeah, priority crowd. didn’t say wouldn’t be. That’s also sad, reduce deaths dramatically. Single parent, working home. child watching TV nearly day long work. can't educate work time. worry happen later wish energy, time resources make happen. 

And I'm one lucky ones. Someone told wife ""yeah, apparently mostly old folks homes elderly people."".

Oh, cool Grandpa George dies, 'cause he's old? Also, numbers young and/or healthy people likely ALSO increased period, breakdown. clorox, too. really isn’t surprising. know Florida America’s R&amp;D lab studying worst case scenario human behavior. the. Fuck. No, learning it. learned ages ago chose ignore it. already learned history, see teaching history useless people ignore it. mentality humans progress slowly. think ancient discovered knowledge new. like you. Keep independent self-aware. absolutely made right choice. I’m sorry. already knew this. know too. Don’t know money lives per corporations? MLS, facilities. tested positive Florida.. took 11 days get results. already gotten point docs choose gets care. Sounds right. Horrible families doctors course patient well, gonna happen. Docs make tough choices 99% people okay getting it. Atleast region lot summer events cancelled beaches closed still. NBA wants restart Orlando Women wear pretty masks matches dresses men care color mask. compare hospitalization rate morbidity mortality rate. would give better view affecting public. top that, severe reaction rate test positive along person listing think infected. applaud general statistics know better react general stats 2020 woeful. would expect stats like 1930's. 1950's expect better 2020, clickable charts lots stats. everyone would dead taste point can't beat deadly disease lockdowns anyway. limit number can't eliminate it. 

No rich person would ever suffered measles, mumps, small pox, polio etc. etc. mere lockdown could solve that. needed vaccines. need vaccine too. 

I believe lockdown face masks limit damage best possible, believe either prevent it. GOP insisting lifting lockdowns ending aid Americans disgusting, America needs remember it. Never vote GOP ever again, ever. Force disband party decade never getting elected. first time racist evil party dissolved America. Yes, happen them, become Corona Prophets! Repent wear masks!! case study comes shortly medical experts revealed 30% coronavirus patients develop dangerous blood clots, known thrombosis, form different areas around body, including tip penis flaccid, two chambers tissue penis rigid, due blood doctors able remove blood penis using needle.

Dunno, form opinion. OK wrong ;) said “The South rise Again”. didn’t think meant.  think Governor Wolf finally like, ""Fuck every single Last one complained sued me. *your* way"" issued mandate wear masks public places went say:

Masks required social distancing impossible - restaurants, public transportation, healthcare, etc.;

People medical condition exempt documentation condition required;

Local authorities monitor/enforce see fit.

And blame all. wanted people calm reasonable. gave people receiving unemployment additional $600/week. Dr. Levine gave news conferences daily. still people like MAH FREEEEEEEDERMS wearing mask tyranny. Erie's reps County Executive went TV say punished Wolf going green phase counties told people act like we're green anyway police enforce restrictions. Fuck. Them. All. Flag, I’m get used humidity here. I’ve lived WI before, I’m definitely looking forward wintering again. hate break human nature selfish money power. could take plug new human beings would thing again, short order. loop that's played repeat thousands years, since time pharaohs before. visited Portland probably help also ""Mount"" Tabor like decently sized hill middle city. Wow it’s like deep state plant Dr Fauci right infection rate need start hurting offenders jail time, major fines, etc. Horniness little anything. People still sex. There’s thing called birth control... wave looks like water world *Interstellar*.

“Those aren’t mountains. They’re waves.”

*BBBWWWWWWWWWAUGHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN* arent lmao. exposed infected person, probably would already infected since probably keep touching mask face (ignoring many factors aerosolized virus) Almost us get Covid 19 over. 

That's true, inevitable, plan. operating assumption epidemiological community. kind thinking contributes carefree/careless attitude towards virus. true 40 unlikely die virus- invalidate fact contract virus become vector spread at-risk friends relatives. damn mean people lining spend $300 hear ""ice ice baby""? im SHOCKED likely lot people NY protests already previously infected. NY's coronavirus numbers insanely high beginning outbreak. largest protests areas previous super spreading already occured. think teachers? last time, glorified babysitters.

Editing add coming mother working full-time/overtime, husband usually work full time. pandemic- scrambled 9 year old (imagine watching mother working constantly right front you, able give attention) STEAM virtual summer camp (put after-school STEAM workshop) goes around 10 4, several breaks. get totally engrossed something likes something decided might fail at, good luck. take time coach couple projects.  run room work come back ignoring project. Flu pretty damn serious kills alot people annually. flu, avoid contact. paraphrase Tyler Creator: Stay home hahaha, walk Away restaurants parties hahahaha. 
Instead we’ve got shitheads virtual signaling usual. people also died go hospital. Also , car accidents really drop much, people drove like crazy. Yes, keep discounting players interacting public. Unless players live absolute bubble haven'tt secretly practiced past month next 2 weeks ALREADY it. means eaten out. Went small gathering. Went church. Checked family past month rest public ""opening up"". 


And pace transmission. simply operate way rest public operating. Mask optional advised social distancing access public business, players guaranteed get next 2 weeks. 


These players family can't simply follow public protocol. would isolate though already it. I'd argue includes going practice other. body going catch it. Even equipment manager's son. 


July 4th weekend coming up. people NBA exposed weekend. Regardless rules NBA has. That’s assault officer. would like jail time?  One person said awhile ago Trump made MAGA masks wore them

All wear *any* mask tell country important tools save American would tricked whole boat load people wearing them. 

That's...not tricking. That's leading. like Scientist created dashboard fired manipulating statistics DeSantis wanted cooked numbers support reopening. *cries 80s beater* Case numbers stops increasing! there’s three ICU beds left entire county (escambia)... zero higher 
leadership rn seems, it’s insane. Feel free show said that. literally believe NBA still going restarting league. tf would pick Florida places. gonna bad... Damn Trump! 🙄 ♥️ get sense people filling bars Nashville probably aren’t there? said March would millions dead people laughed me. Well, we've 47 years since January alone, so... Panama City planning two nights fireworks 4^th . really think rednecks three states going miss that? think it’s entitled consumers drive decision making level? Really? That's probably want ;) I'm sitting here, one first locked states, still left lockdown, wondering WTF happening states. Everything bigger Texas. Including fuckups. Another symptom suddenly popped Seriously. seen office since March 11 Actually, learn meaning term. know system works, doubt binary report/ report scenario, least comes state whole. We're talking lot difference locations lot different staffing situations, contribute state total. assumption would least locations report weekend do. country too.  Yeah, whole thing blowing fucking mind. knew lot people touch, idea touch. fucking priorities way sync reality.

I feel like driven towards edge GPS telling turn, us telling turn, insisting know right direction. Holy shit guys fucked. kind understand reluctance that. Landlords exactly swimming money Scrooge McDuck style - without rent, many going creek many paddles rest us. Rental properties liquid assets, paper may greater net worth practice strongly expect coming eviction crisis we'll see another shakeup housing market many landlords six months year's rent properties try quickly liquidate assets pay *their own* creditors. 

But definitely needed better plan ""everyone ignore COVID maybe it'll go away, get back work"". State issue, Disneyland going reopen July 17th. However, California hasnt issued guidelines yet Theme Parks open weekend. sound meant Monday, general ""later"" term. So, delay state guidelines Disney pushed back opening uncertainty able open logistics getting everything ready reopen.

Unions complained too, seem reason game pretend you’re robot working featureless white sealed box moon, live human pandemic family lives Humans normal human dwelling.  


And person end call pretends thing.  


That game sucks. hell wants play game? Doubling every week 20K likely. actual death rate somewhere around .5%

which still 10-20X rate seasonal flu.

I want million people die, reflected actions. US? Currently 120k. context, worst year flu-deaths modern history last year, 80k (beating former high 56k). 

We're 120k COVID-19 deaths, halfway know people financially incentivized write death certificates percent occurred?

P0litifact discussed this. google it. (linking cause get removed).

If P0TUS proactive leader pushing strong policy sensibly combat COVID-19, point Dem0crats using pandemic political cudgel.

But he's shit bed harder large nation. That's objective truth. Yea mistake, one day past week 10, think point still stands plateaued far deaths concerned. 7 day moving average worldometer 6 now. Seems unlikely they'll get 6k. Europeans take seriously there's still mass gatherings, guess. places distinct second wave though (Croatia, Israel) still reason stay smart. You..... good. study got 80% rule used N95s ad hoc face coverings assumed they'd worn correctly. Trump used DPA PPE needed giant education campaign. Americans don’t care. There’s explanation. don’t. hope mother fucker dies fuck bull shit country. fucking leadership. Fuck America. lol imagine China memory holing cases like this, rage reddit would white hot WOW fucked. Yeah, no! 

Personal, sealed booths passenger air tank. Agreed. frustrating explain people sentiments article describes without hearing usual “gUeSs wAnT kIlL gRaNdMa”. 

We really potentially messing kids - especially lac socialization. distance learning work young kids. We’ve sacrificed camp, school, play dates, etc need given break fall. don’t know we’ll forced distance learning horseshit again. Really frustrating.  Worldometer US daily new cases record stood 39000 2 months. broken week ago. broken 4 hours left counts come in. I'm Macedonia culture individualistic well, yet maintain whole multi generational household thing, care lot family on, many many people refuse wear masks, refuse even believe virus exists point due poor behavior country among worst hit Europe religious holidays came around handling situation well.

We way many religious fanatics here, muslims christians they're largely blame current outbreak. uphold family values put religion anything else, example easter Christian preachers kept urging fanatics afraid come church drink wine exact spoon everybody else get disinfected anything apparently religion cure corona.

Then came muslim religious holidays, kept breaking quarantine completely disregarded safety measures put place would gather large groups small closed spaces quickly spreading virus among family members friends.

Then people neither religious fanatics religious leaders refuse wear masks, practice social distancing even believe virus.

Now country quickly headed Italian American scenario thanks this.

So multi generational households? Caring elders? yet headed corona hell thanks irresponsible fanatical people. Yes, live TN, past week, two employees work gone family vacations Florida tested positive. SO’s workplace, employee quarantined Florida caught visiting family vacation.  
Blows fucking mind. trying prove clever anyone else world, succeeding. go r/Masks4All Texas has. Putting Italy pot blatantly false: brutal 2-months lockdown almost 70% country managed practically untouched virus, WTF talking about? gotta let little die finish paying wall one wanted. THIS
This needed handled unified Federal level. federal government failed this. frustrating part me. I’m still quarantining people keep acting shocked! get asked plans 4th July one time I’m gonna lose it. Nice get mentality line reasoning. takes people protesting pick virus, take virus bar restaurant open. fact places like NYC spiking people inevitably picked virus protest fewer options available socialize public setting. LA, things open protests, things able spread faster easier. Everything combined (protests, reopening bars, restaurants, nutjobs wearing masks, idiots throwing parties, etc.) are. argue otherwise asinine. Wear masks...end discussion Bro, COURSE won't. Well situation we’re talking about. Ya people done terrible shit people Africa course raises concerns. But, 50 people saying don’t want tests. article made seem local healers don’t want vaccine all. course, local healers fine makes someone feel safe that’s ok, seems odd agenda here. South Africa make effective vaccine, would huge help continent places West Africa struggle diseases Ebola (this gotten lot better now). countries simply can’t afford vaccine US Europe China. South African vaccine may much affordable. make show can't make talk. says virus multiplies faster upper respiratory, load virus = earlier symptoms 

The article say symptoms show earlier. might right, that's article saying-- assumption.

Moreover, easier spread 3 days symptomatic versus 5 days symptomatic, *you're still going spread people.* literally said back March. many half measures. needed shut everything down. Wait... lockdown end? Hospitalizations deaths spiked AZ well, widely reported data available azdhs data portal. ask question you’re going asshole get answer? wonder track first offense... stamp back hands? Nope, people stupid, period. must talking right every person take measures like wearing mask seriously. I've worn respirator P100 filter since January, cool (and ridiculed everyone), generalizations necessary. I'm pointing hypocrisy, looks overlooked either conditioning willful ignorance. stats deaths deterrent. think public rallies, polarized animus threads embarrassing everyone. people act like real life too? r/FloridaCoronavirus new neighbours moving die COVID, hope new ones brains direct competition Alabama &amp; Texas #1! Go Gators! always something it... refuse serve tell leave. Yes.

It's always case. see Covid thing reported, weird today find daily infections deaths anywhere... even official government sites. 

Eventually page BBC gives doctored stats updated, changed much I'm beyond point caring now, long nations close borders USA. country know what's good best hunker keep safe can. rest fuck right :( one every 350 New Yorkers died Covid last 4 months. That’s insane, well less 1/100  Congratulations? Texas finally it. Next goal entire country r/Masks4All goal even saying something begin with? Youtube translated closed captions. live current world technology understand anybody clicks. would require effort thinking - since can't understand that, doubt could understand graphs charts numbers describing either. even close 40%. Voter turnout 60% many people voting believe least incompetent opposed outright support. sorrow people. Pay price stupidity. 

I feel sorry people went way everything right still got sick hitting herd immunity, like planned Put Karens Chads (if violated above) middle Death Valley make masks, process manure, dung make fertilizer. Interesting talk cases longer fatalities. Number deaths seems falling. many tested getting well? Cool number deaths week pretty stable actually gone quite bit April.

In central florida they’ve really ramped tests, get tested free pretty much anywhere employers “encouraging” employees get tested slightest symptoms get hug? *too* stupid 

Fixed you.

Unless meant people heading towards stupid,which accurate withdraw correction.

¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ Common sense rare fuck personal identity gets involved  Link doesn’t work me. states aren’t seeing uptick? Everyone’s going get accept that. !remindme 7 days really fact, go bars outdoors NJ really makes sad makes embarrassed bad people country treating virus find potentially pandemic viruses animals relative frequency, influenza viruses livestock always concern. Honestly, currently pandemic, think would even make widespread news.

 unless starts spreading humans, recommendations made scientist quoted article make lot sense. Control virus pig populations keep close eye workers. Well didn’t read closely, conclusion protesters spread virus amongst rest population locked ever due curfews business shutdowns. Mother fucking idiots. 

I'd even okay would stay amongst stupidity would work out. Sadly that's case. Fuck people. Negligent homicide city US, one cares anymore. work food service, see around 60% guests without masks. US, though. Go figure lol  everyone wore masks. go bars outdoors woke brave. Dude corona knew it. Attended party anyway infected dozen. that's malicious know it. sick hell autoimmune problems, nice getting fewer infections people. still happen though, say sit mild cold. blown administration - handled way feel be. I'm right though situation handled know left winged extremists something else know sense assuming. know shame talk anyone control outbreak. Would funny accidentally extinguished flu virus time covid.  I've become partial ""herd disability"" reports flooding many survivors left long term harm. even say [as many 1 3 long term Let's hope high hell that's wrong far fewer that... know single person refusing wear mask seen unmasked person Tampa, FL business yet. Protests mass gathering supported would obviously cause spread. hospital tests case know anyone else super worried grocery stores’ supplies running low (in US)? It’s going six months since virus entered United States four months since declared pandemic. thought maybe month things would start look normal grocery stores things starting look grim. I’m Midwest regular levels quality goods/food back normal! I’m thinking way way ahead I’m sure we’ll able good Holiday season keeps (the hoarding people buying regular amounts things). Thoughts?  Yes you’ve stated dangerous virus entire country needs go lockdown start taking seriously. 

No place United States reached herd immunity. 20% infected, reason don’t herd immunity lockdowns social distancing. Infact southern states may reach herd immunity faster NY sinple arnt anything. suppose that’s good strategy, Ofcourse expense grandparents, neighbours, fellow Americans. points still valid. wish picture mask made Taiwan China compare. infuriating...we access n95s plenty health care workers. what's bib? moved Midwest NYC one year November. Filed taxes Iowa New York year listing residency dates paying proper amount. New York decided pay state tax entire year (while living working Iowa). objected, tried appeal spent hours hours phone them. Appealed decision within agency and.... appeal vanished garnished $800 wages owed. loved living NYC never live NYS again. think time hit 90 might understand people vote way here. They’ve open GA quite time, social media pictures, packed ever, since one anything else do. #kidslivesmatter? child happy healthy, failing jobs come go. apartments come go. But, child irreplaceable. hope herd immunity prevails herd impunity 67 new deaths recorded Thursday, median age 37 according latest stats published today..will update post positivity rate published.  Yup. Girlfriend starting look financially. get 40% reduction hours (I'm back normal, thankfully) school gets cancelled indefinitely. can't work there's childcare even were, that's asking children get coronavirus. There's winning economy. American Dream fucking sham. Specific COVID-19 Antibody (IgG IgM) tests lot cheaper. around 2,000 pesos quick one. (try get ones United Kingdom) one mother law took, robbed friend.

Normal laboratory (IgG only) 950 pesos.

**IgG** call ""memory"" antibody means immune system exposed covid. may interpreted COVID.

 **IgM** first one appear fighting virus. Probably meaning contagious.

A friend wife medic, told us 120 medics nurses took quick one clinic works. 80 came positive 2 probably active. know scientists smart lot statistical analysis, ( hated statistics college), Vaccine 50% effective? mean?... Apparently lot people get Covid-19 asymptomatic anyway....Serious question -- know effective vaccine portion people wont get sick regardless? boyfriend dying Covid, doctor able speak condition. norovirus once. basically body, religious experience. started question peeing butthole. 

It really severe 12 hours, knew body craving electrolytes. made short journey 711 nearby, felt like completed El Camino. 25% lung function here. even outside house since March. Costco really neat grocery delivery app, dad's work actually mandated everyone work home, we've actually extremely lucky this. worst thing that's happened physical isolation pay cut. least fired.

Also, nothing goes house unless porch three days thoroughly sanitized. understand people can't work home, honestly, properly worn mask social distancing, please. wear mask without difficulty 25% lung function, sure hell wear yours, 87% lung function Karen Yikes. derogatory it’s demonstrably fact. forgot mention general population ignoring pandemic first comment. sound dumb too, hypocrite someone lived San Diego years raising family getting tired seeing word ""'Zonies"" used derogatory word tourists Arizona. know anyone Arizona. dislike people actively hating people neighboring states, particularly rely money local economy. Like get fuck yourself. Back June 22, made prediction chart global death total milestones based total day (470,519) working upward/forward. correctly guessed it'd hit 500,000 June 28.

Here's rest chart, wanna play along:

7-13: 575,400 (upper range 2009-2010 swine flu pandemic)

7-18: 600,000

8-7: 700,000

8-27: 800,000

9-16: 900,000

10-6: 1,000,000

11-25: 1,250,000

1-14-21: 1,500,000  dose prescribed it? AFAIK dose humans widely proven work. hope lock asses up! risking others lives know it. Honestly best time baby. Everybody around taking much care protect you, doctors safe caring her. newborn sooooo isolating boring desperate anyway, might able blame PPD pandemic instead feeling like it’s failure. Regardless law is, kinda what-about-ism bullshit. cares? mean herd immunity works? people get infected? Maybe good thing? even possible get virus long term? everyone meant stop lives forever? Taiwan propaganda again?? end?? I’m American managed ignorant heaps privilege. 

It would even *ignorant* acknowledge everybody gets that. ""Spreads via water droplets.""

*Water Condensation*

More virus per droplet water spread evenly. Infection requires threshold. threshold far easier reach.

That guess bits know. still think use 9/11s unit. larger gets, absurd becomes.

so far we're 43 9/11s confirmed Covid-19 deaths. Lol 😂 know right especially since 9 pm friend ones around way sidewalk restaurant . Marine SERE must much higher percentage He's vegetable. I'm woke culture bullshit. us ""opens up"" million infected wondering around. Obviously less safe 4 months ago healthy people recover norovirus without medical intervention. biggest risk dehydration. usually keep Pedialyte house still child school, schools great places pick (so daycares, Xmas parties cruise ships). 

It sucks bad get it, nowhere bad flu be. bath tub next toilet helps, explosive shits explosive pukes time! Yes, corona around.

Corona disappear magic day 1 shutdown. shutdown effective, decreases gradually. well lag population's realization danger passed.

You see happened countries real shutdown, kind shutdown actually works decreases virus levels. 50, overweight, diabetic. dumb. Stay home. viruses perpetually there.. literally flu mutations happen.

Nothing worry about, usual.

Wear mask, minimize contact others, wash hands, going get sick. Got link? Ah, units problem. quoting percentage increase excess deaths time. quoting percentage *of deaths* attributable Covid. 2 weeks ? could happened? Mental health real thing, people use justification socialize seem rarely take precautions all. real problem people US think dichotomy - either locked home party like 1999.

It would fine frequently visited friend sat lawn met park face masks shot shit. Hell, even three times week different friends would likely fine. Going party lot people zero social distancing (and I'm going guess masking) killed him. It’s gov people think though. It’s lie conspiracy created propagated certain government party. brought continue bring deaths many many people they’ll somehow gaslight entire country project blame onto someone else. know sound weird live Houston Miami L.A. right now, 50% month really fast. averages 1.36% growth day, doubling time 53 days. Back bad old days April, pandemic doubling every week even less. school can’t pass levy, despite improving school, growing area average home prices rise. neighborhood Karen clubs mailing letters people vote levy. kids age school, stop giving fuck everyone else. Nordic countries comperable other. makes sense compare Sweden to, say, India. That's oranges apples, Nordic countries apples apples. 

And yeah, let's really hope early indicators could cause mass disability wrong, every survivor eventually gets better. judging SARS caused long term sequelae many survivors, doubtful sadly. 

Well, also famous cases like horrible story Nick Cordeo, young healthy Broadway actor lost leg communicate blinking. Terrible shit. virus needs taken seriously trying herd immunity like Sweden frankly insane unethical. comment backfired little it? criminal, essentially manslaughter. pregnant moment. waited financially secure, good jobs, owned home... also meant 37 got pregnant. 

A months said pregnancy, COVID hit US. lucky WFH, impacted economically situation yet, can't help little bitter. 

I waited ducks row, 
was responsible possible, and, bam, global pandemic. COVID even around China got pregnant, way could factored decision making.

So, yeah, like people company, get juggle work kid get back parental leave, can't see daycares opening/being safe renewed spike. luck, national IQ go want nostalgia trip badly, go emulate PS1 games, watch Jurassic Park, Independence Day, listen Spice Girls, Backstreet Boys, whatever top ten 1995 something. Christ You’ve changed headline entirely change meaning. that. Taking down.  normal times yes well documented pandemic virus spreads ridiculous rate.

I'm also part ""you're school even death's door"" generation, whilst live sick pay, responsibility society whole greater.

Plus, believe article party, right? party guest whole new level idiocy selfishness. Interesting. sources claims? dismiss point— I’d like read this. always. Working. federal government coming rescue

if want assistance US federal government, please try one following things:

1. rich
1. government official foreign nation USA tenuous relationship past (possibly related #1)
1. corporation (possibly related #1)
1. church (possibly related #1) he's right. exactly same. sitting sunshine, feeling breeze, talking several feet apart people exactly 100 randoms riding tin hours. /s sounds irresponsible Norwegian government terrible.....I hope NY continues well, scary read infected people large parties think that's spreading unchecked; refusing speak contact tracers. NY numbers hopeful lately. large portion early mortality may attributable overwhelmed systems. parts new York Italy providing suboptimal care enough resources. US, limitation less often ventilators, often staffing.

Normally, ICU nurse manages two complicated patients. new York hospitals, nurses managing eight patients. compensated keeping patients heavily sedated, increases complications. Everyone commented weak covid survivors were, part due suboptimal ICU care.

In Italy, many patients directly managed non-ICU physicians.  It’s amazing watch, real time, global scientific community collaborate effort literally save world. darkness clears, part story bright spot Propaganda mother sister kids outdoors cookout swimming fireworks. wife's friend work might come too. people spend time necessity anyway I'm worried cookout swim party them. Halves? big class rooms? class 30 half there’s still way kids would 6’ apart. Maybe could groups 6. Six children Monday, 6 children Tuesday on. isn’t going work. Thanks. Depends personal wishes. person unable make wish Time agree completely. Fauci said ZERO DEATHS 14 days....then first wave over. painful uncomfortable? lied. promoted masks knowing short supply.

That's lie. 


They could limited sales PPE healthcare workers. know. second wave tsunami hits first one receded. protected blood Jesus like one lady said. economy running part. cases. Meanwhile, economy wreck states runaway infection rates. know plan like better.  It’s “mandatory” instead recommended. can’t anyone believe Jesus gave fucking masks. Smh  feel one long dark math lesson Americans exponential growth.  70 million baby boomers

About 40,000 died Yup interpreted well. Already people symptoms reasons believe contracted virus would drag testing site. one going testing site cause they've got nothing better do. dont think population getting tested changed whole lot. control do. wear mask filter. It’s safety others. would hope others would same. empty house sell mom died last year. think part silent generation tho. Anyone entire world, US.  I'm anxious financially, I've already virus. ""fuckwad"" seem like appropriate word use here? plural, course. “The objective conclusion one reach looking excess death counts worldwide covid deaths undercounted.”

He didn’t take difference all, you’re obtuse. Small businesses bad. Big corporations ok! *Immigrants: get job done* blown Easter, wtf about?  would take 30 years entire US population contract Covid-19 rate 30,000 new cases per day. 

331,000,000 Current US population / 30,000 COVID cases / 365 days/yr = 30 years 

The death rate COVID-19 roughly 5% / 331,000,000 population 30 years = 16,500,000 US citizen deaths

It normally takes 10 years vaccines fully develop final product reach consumers current expedited timeframe much sooner. 

If numbers remain consistent even 1/3 population worst case scenario would contract COVID vaccine developed much sooner 10 years would even less. 

This obviously taking current numbers factoring exponential spread could happen speed rate infections. Excellent news!! insane, it’s mistake. government set serve investor class, well.

The upper class profiting stock market booming. always primary goals. Define closing here. real closing one Sheriff/law enforcement come say “We’re going enforce this”?

Honest question behind paywall me. lip service real thing? Thank sharing stay safe. hope doctors nurses front lines come share stories people get real idea happening much talked turn makes people take things seriously whatever reason. really like publix. sad Florida government failed floridians that's thinking BLM protestors wearing masks, organizers encouraged social distancing. what's wrong outside beach? lock down, it’s like aren’t used isolated drunk long winters lake effect snow. things considered they’re probably one best spots country shit 😂 think mean \*and\* sink country. bill thing already massive debt.... right evictions foreclosures halted. Watch happens flood gates open suddenly home equity needed support mortgage debt starts fall. state level, probably mandate lasts 3 weeks. goes end unemployment payment boost covid penny more. Sadly, think they'll choice extend places around nation create even debt. Mexicovid check references paper yourself, valid hypothesis based published evidence. community major measles outbreak! someone see loose seal? Buddy, spend 22 hours hospital son surgery broken arm. Like got home, now. hospital line door Covid testing, separate entrance non Covid patients. 

My son rigorously screened door, armed security. Neither us even offered Covid test, once. need every test get mountains sick people banging doors, random people left house three months symptoms. would rather see LA make outbreak worse doubling mistakes? Thanks response. I’m South Central PA, viewing abroad, care deeply people there. Please stay vigilant mask-wearing shame not. Peace Love that. mean really love that! feel, used go gym, used Deadlifts, Squats, Bench Lat Pull Downs back. I'm saying I'm buff guy routine gave best results. One first Chinese studies outbreaks. 318 outbreaks found one case outdoor spread two cases. actually disagree argument cornerstones EBP meant mutually exclusive; would argue opposite, especially since quote use says EBP INTEGRATION three cornerstones. None exist vacuum: three must considered deciding appropriate patient care. Now, situations research lacking, patients still need cared for, next best thing use cornerstones EBP, plus whatever related research relevant novel disease/disorder. like problem goes away there's research fall back on. I'd still trust virologist, pulmonologist, etc use clinical expertise treat patients make recommendations much higher level accuracy insight average Joe street.  them, least don’t believe there’s Publix governor work. time half (or double time?) sweet chocolate. compare education western countries US near dead last.

People use critical thinking, claim woke fucking clueless sheep

Imagine supporting Trump mess tax revenue important lives. “I’m moron.” - Joe Rogan Ironic. Someone post video husband bar bet lol. Even teenagers undeveloped brains make things like risk future consequences hard understand apply lives. brain humans finished developing well 20s. believe America well. couple people catch every year squirrels shit like average five 15 cases occur year western United States. cases usually scattered rural areas; caused bites primarily infected prairie dogs. case person-to-person infection United States since 1924.

How get bit prairie dog? Misleading headline. Second sentence article: company previously said drivers riders required wear masks trips June. Wednesday, company said extending rule. 

Rule already place, ""indefinite"".  live thank goodness. scared nothing mayor would allow it. Florida screwed itself. next months peak tourist season. Instead peak coronavirus season. took steps months ago would lot better now. Man people really making easy natural selection thing perfect analogy, gets across point opinion expert certain field holds weight evidence average person's pertains topic. simply does, really know go here. look definition evidence options could fit bill one couldn't. time

Yeah, especially car closed.

If windows open air probably turns fast. Multiple studies show covid can't survive long direct sunlight neutralized quickly 2 minutes 80 degrees. AKA environment protests in. Protests massive still tiny percentage population. population going masks simply due action protesting.

Compare restaurants/bars, cooled, indoor spaces. significantly higher numbers traffic longer periods time. minimal masks on, they're eating/drinking. 

Of course protests likely spread disease. there's way comes close due sheer volume bars/restaurants there. Comparing hundreds thousands tens millions. Let's also forget nobody wants protesting sense what's right. Hardly fair poo-poo protestors giving people eating chicken tenders pass. nature triage ugly heartbreaking. medical community really understand true triage, hundreds need care one gets it, is. Good luck there, wish best. lot did, hard gauge whether productive counter-productive given abject poverty low median age population. Joins? It’s like months course US lied cases death, since last fall emerged US, continue rest time. 

As rule thumb, anything US accuse others doing, far higher level. Trump may love projection, hes symptom projection loving US general. Prepare intense karen vids Aww, poor dumbass idiots. ya i'm honestly confused. live States, I'm guessing people subreddit from. exactly story told there? Chinese people docile knew right away responsible welfare country? blindly followed orders government?

People sometimes wore masks OUTSIDE protect vs bad air pollution. Nobody ever forced wear masks. That, police relatively easy handle before. time, took things really seriously people kind shocked level immediate enforcement. There's tons videos circulating wechat police 'brutality' back then. mean, think burden lifted healthcare system year many geriatric obese patients (historically heaviest burden HC system) kicking bucket year. mention social security might actually solvent thing over. huge win younger generations. Well people refuse wear masks definitely going start struggle. obviously right wear mask take Uber, even consider driver companies rights refuse service. I’m telling you, Germany, New York, Switzerland legitimate antibody tests fell range. 0.26% CDC based speculative modeling range different IFRs. IFR based actual antibody testing. point actual study showing 0.26, I’d love see it. 

I’m hoping anything. work hospital. I’ve seen young people completely diminished lung capacity actually don’t know they’ll ever get back. 

If “new normal” goes window July 4th, means dead, less freedom, restrictions. means even longer go back school person. might want consider consequences actions. Well get sick use drug. Simple that. bet would use though. understanding school board can’t legally enforce masks, public entity follow letter law. ""We rely American banks. funding need **Russia**."" 

[\- Eric  like beginning disaster movie Please call Cholo. First name Hans. call homey, Chewy.. don’t claim know science behind it, anti inflammatory safe consume representations without intoxication. mah freedum!  Mertyl Beach, SC would same. Pennsyltuckians unique breed arrogant assholes. people don’t get wrong idea, Myrtle Beach city, cases came house party, beach. Yep. actually medical condition means cannot wear mask, probably serious enough get curbside pickup delivery everything. Lmao entire world fingertips, yet cant arsed go bar bit Preach friend lives AZ says hospitals empty... surfaces touch car

Not careful touching face aircon recirculation

In case, neutral; enclosed car contagious person bad whether there's A/C. Open window safety. Otherwise, people wearing masks helps lot. personal opinion would kitchen spice actually got Covid, probably terribly influential one way other. Wow natural selection hit home run! “Save job, wear mask!” far, shut restaurants, bars, gyms

These open Bay Area. Even gyms. Bay Area hotspot several counties showing large numbers recently. SF county cities careful, many places around SF filled people completely gave social distancing, never wear masks meeting neighbors friends. suppose Easter? 🤣 people make good thing worth hand waving away. plus hundred cumming weekend people houses aren’t dying

The lower class elderly nursing homes disproportionately dying pretty big assumption ""world economy"" really depends world population. many abject poverty really contribute that.

And even manufacturing doses, medical grade glass vials (also short supply), storage potential refrigeration space, alcochol wipes, needles, gloves.

Medical supplies already stretched fairly thin. Making even one dose entire world population already going challenge, much less multiple per year like hypothetical talking about.  crowd funding initiative save bars. Let's see many really caring bar survival. So. Much. Winning. today day US breaks 50k?

Apparently so. 50,277 Worldometer. Good job, morons. can't find granular details, 2016 2,714,112 admissions acute care hospitals across Texas, averaging 7,435 admissions day. emergency care seasonal tends busier winter (old people slipping falling, etc.) least busy spring. peaks late summer (heat stroke, etc.) Texas may different trends since never really gets cold enough old people start slipping falling.

Hospital bed usage COVID patients Texas increased thousand people past week alone, people eat bed space weeks, going get very, bad Texas, very, soon. Ladies Gentlemen. present you......the Alabama school system ah, news, virus, huh? always number. one wants admit it. exists K feel sorry country. pretty sure NYC like NYC isn’t rest U.S like Although really much AMLO totally blew Corona virus response. delusional denialist response like know who. Unfortunately Mexican people pay bad thought process. Labor Day... haven’t heard anyone angry it. live Stockholm, doesn’t affect friends/colleagues much. imagine people living Skåne angrier it. 

I think lot people find kinda baffling though people live one country work allowed cross border, well Swedes traveling Kastrup, Danes going Bornholm via Sweden. policy doesn’t seem consistent. pneumonia deaths several standard deviation average? assume COVID deaths pneumonia deaths completely separate. Otherwise yeah, point. arguing genuinely serious... reliable source?     
With much fudging numbers going ...is accurate source ?   
I know worldometer far perfect but, silly may sound, consistently imperfect (in numbers may inaccurate graphs may offer truer reflection.).  military whole lot prettier smiled while. Don’t blame president. Culturally Americans celebrate individualism resistance government direction. doomed fail. 

Americans listened business leaders told economy would collapse didn’t open things quickly. entire country completely fucked show couple pennies businesses made.

They also went binge BLM protests. Although deserved protest gatherings kill blacks people ever did.

Wait end summer realize Americans blocked travelling work, school pleasure outside USA.

The Chinese may gave gotten rough treatment February minor compared reception Americans people living USA get.

They world’s pariahs. eat McDonald's often eating inside one never something really considered anyway. know comment age like milk, right? Alabama coming you, scrub. Auburn, bartenders testing positive bars gonna open 4th. said nothing sort. original comment said “every country” simply isn’t true. didn’t justify say US good healthcare system (let’s honest, healthcare *industry*). Oooh love this. friend restaurant health inspector said chains like McDonalds usually best, divisions company geared towards food safety. locally owned places, especially ones ran people counties, might high safety standards back home usually worst condition. Please explain, mean 100% people wear cloth masks equivalent one person wearing N95 one else wearing cloth mask, agree? Otherwise follow thing missing literally care.

at all.
 

telling ""you could kill someone""  even register people. 

""not problem"" Covering diseases, committing ethnic genocide, trampling agreements Hong Kong name few. Yeah reputation isnt great lol Texas significant spread March. I'm hesitant even make suggestions could worse, lest draw wrath vengeful capricious god. gamble then, evening Tue., June 30, Xtra Innings posted Facebook restaurant would closing anyway. employee tested positive COVID-19 bar-restaurant would closed employees test negative virus. 

Is requirement there?

Because optional. places multiple employees get keep operating even bother inform employees, much less customers. Np, thanks remaining civil bitter brainwashed Swede? going bars hobby getting drunk form fun, really ought reevaluate priorities life. get Netflix, Amazon, streaming services start recommending Jaws great Summer movie?


Or Fake News shark eating someone somewhere?


Make idiots, 'Nawt Skeered!' virus that's killed 130,000 Americans, scared take bath? Hicks gonna hick. Fuck Alabama point, people still won’t wear mask aren’t going “mandated.” We’re getting dregs society remaining anti-maskers. appear concentrated areas. Ive seen pictures barricading beach access points like lockdown others see pictures, what's point even throwing party? Increasing cases decreasing deaths great news suggests fatality rate dropping.  Rumor covid hates country music immediately killed upon turning on.

So, grab bottle Lysol, lay tanning bed mouth open throw boot-stompin' country music, folks think dash cam one best things driver do. routinely dealt passengers drivers accusing kinds things basically trying decide believe often without hard evidence. 

My case load would dozens time. People would contact us accuse discrimination, DUI/being intoxicated, stealing, damaging interior car, inappropriate flirting, kidnapping, assault, on. 

Basically dash cam cuts time would take us investigate try make decision fault. don’t know rules now, years ago weapons platform prohibited. Gotta position bait in-person value tuition switching online classes. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick:: Fauci know he's talking about. implying fearless leader ever wrong? next holiday thingy.... bad appreciate openness! know said huge housing shortage 2005. recession suddenly poof way much inventory market.

we're starting economic crash least par 2008 many accounts far worse. there's inventory shortage wait years there's probably going glut. Makes sense, Edison dick tool, also cheat. consider kids, kids. Forever. You’re getting hung personal bad experience. doctor said come place condescending doctor came. Next time tell doctor f&amp;$k off. help healing. PLUS people governor referring to, teens, aka kids. That’s refer teens. Kids. like old dogs babies. relax stop barking tree. It’s wrong one.  Literally thinking Keep shoveling shit ur mouth morning! Plenty coming soon now. Drives anti-maskers nuts.

I lot shopping Asian supermarkets now. yelling, brawls, masks. US numbers half bad portrayed media - sheer size place means always going drag longer, mortality rates peaked declining done everywhere else. 

The US may well end per capita rates likes Italy Spain go beyond that. 

Plus account dubious ways deaths counted innacurate tests - US, globally. I'd knock least 25% supposed Covid deaths Covid all. Call cynical want, look it, likely is. click-bateyness even article written seems extra twisted make look worse 

This practically every media outlet since pandemic began. things easing - terms deaths - focus shifts things make sound worse actually are. Part problem people even read beyond headlines days. They're far bought Covid fear porn narrative genuinely afraid. 

And afraid - put - "" pay attention to, specifically administration doing.""

Like say, much terrible things come - many carried governmental levels beyond - make wonder whole crisis manufactured lot actually is? 

Again, call cynical, can't help feeling lot nothing sideshow keep us occupied focused important - *but much less* \- important issues. part time Uber driver approve both. stupid take silly risks makes folks little uncomfortable, everyone keep others safe. Minnesota resident here; *stay side.* episode Sister Wives. Mykelti fiancé Tony wanted serve street tacos wedding. Tony thought guest would eat ten tacos. also discussed inviting 400 guests. ask catering hall could make 4,000 tacos wedding. I'm going assume want campuses making reconsider. I’ve flown 32 legs since March. Believe lockdowns flying incredibly safer compared driving. Hardly anyone plane, real crazies road then. 

Now it’s flip-flopped. Airlines cut schedules severely. result planes filling (no empty middle seat guaranteed). getting upgraded first class every flight. streak broke couple weeks ago. mask policy enforced little stringently, food/beverage service comes around pretty much breaks entirely. Airports hit&amp;miss. regions pretty good distancing protocols. Others utter shit-shows (ORD, HOU, DEN). Plus holiday weekend looking fairly busy. real hard time finding flight home work weekend People said GA, FL, AZ, CA, etc first started go up.

More testing = cases country/state things properly. testing EU Canada well... less cases... Funny that, huh? NFL planning starting training camp like two weeks.

You know /r/NFL's top story right now? Washington Redskins pressure change team name. Peer pressure enough. People going outside without mask terrorists brutally beaten. killing people destroying US. gets it. He's super genius. Thank you, that's promising! Tons restaurants cases staff haven’t closed down. Next weekend fun.  Pretty sure idea maintain exact level open-ness keeps hospitals maxed overloaded. find level guess overshoot point ratchet hit sweet spot? Remember AZ, FL, TX hot spots 5,000+ cases? Though CA still bad per capita. Lebanon needs shouted rafters. obvious shame numbers nearly reported correctly. 

Not mention early propoganda ensinuating (normal deaths blamed COVID!!). Chick-Fil-A actually ok. opened dining rooms they're taking ridiculous precautions contactless curbside pickup carry out. Multiply tacos Thursday! it! people focusing death rate continuing fall people like keep mentioning it. us focused catastrophic increase new cases right now. definitely means less credibility ultimately run bunch maniacs children top  Yes, referring top comment. Sorry that. 
But yes, article top comment assuming 100% excess deaths COVID. 

Mathematically get ~28k, 122k minus 95k. Unless assume 100% excess deaths COViD, math doesn’t work. Got it?

Also article presumed ‘most’ delta direct indirect Covid. way works assume 95-100% excess deaths COViD. 
Got it?

It’s math. Well can’t pay bills better take job grocery store money vs none good want handout government instead.

Plenty families make kind jobs time “different” ie better them. Air travel safe moment lot people crammed tight, enclosed area breathing recirculated air hours end. Even worst masks prevent good percentage virus particles entering airways infected, keep good percentage virus particles hanging around now-sweaty face, numbers game.

If throw three darts board, may hit bullseye, throw billion darts board, odds going hit. job interview set day applied. Job market aint was, thats sure. bias whatsoever /s  Yup. Recall NY completely shut down, still saw continuous rise hospitalizations two weeks. peaked started coming down. shut ICU capacity wasn’t even close full, terrified didn’t shut time.

These states still using platitudes half measures, they’re already ICU capacity. Even lock everytj8ng now, it’s still late.

July going blood bath. ""Coronavirus hoax!""

He says last dying attempted breath Hey like coming logic, plus sounds like soCiaLsiMZ appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* What? protection would equivalent Musk's tool, deal it. wait good even trying re-open. They're scared COVID. rational. unintended consequences news coverage anyone taking seriously. get bit prairie dog?

They gerbils? Yikes. That's works.  one thing pandemic sometimes -- sometimes often enough -- see karma happening real time. Could explain parts Southern California hit hard, especially among braceros.  Oh yeah know that. Live San Antonio Let's meet back 2 weeks see happens Trust me, riled Shocked wasn’t thing already. Absolutely shocked matter fact working grocery store able pay bills dont even live lavish lifestyle. would bills unpaid, I'd frontlines, likely contract covid. 

Its nice knowing take time find right job. way grocery store position still available person cover bills.

I'm ""too good"" anything. life different yours. That's I've doing. Takeout lol theory deaths go death rates suddenly dropped ridiculously last 2 weeks since rise started? Good luck prediction, sincerely hope true. four-county region Georgia 89% ICU occupancy rising. specific county issued health emergency alert today. protests barely blip this. look NYC Seattle, biggest, prolonged protests. Yet, increases minor near numbers south bars open restaurants back capacity. Even dan ‘ere Wawa?

Yinz better wearing black yellow masks... Reminds Geico commercial...

Teenagers chased axman...""hot blonde girl"": look, there's car engine running key inside oh well, there's shady dark house barn maybe hide barn instead"". wait.//it's American commercial. think Oxford plans keep affordable. Hopefully clauses license agreements allow distributors jack price. Ok that's better, read titles use stats, makes argument stronger. That's basically feel whole thing. think Atlantic bubble fine. comfortable rest Canada thats still weeks away. Sorry, mean sound cynical. take Apple legitimately care health employees, suspect they're also well aware good PR bonus. 100% accurate .. close test pick whether asymptomatic not. really matter already allowed sports return. allowing people watch (even though people allowed much riskier things). Basically point allow bars, restaurants, bowling, etc open allow 800 fans space 3000 seat ballpark? That's honestly safer going grocery store. I'm genuinely angry this. Bunch selfish, entitled, inconsiderate idiots. public health issue, they're stupid see it. Yeah, always wear mask I'm outdoors, since I've found people really bother keep distance. also respond non-emergency medical calls regularly help move people bodies. Give guys. Georgia done well. death surge never happened despite called experts said.  Aw yeh. claimed, see authoritative source suggest true. evidence **most** (not some) BLM protesters wearing masks? 

For simplicity, lets assume definition ""most"" say, protesters wearing masks throughout entire protest. take tear gas, count. Actually can. produced another version flu vaccine ludicrous pace, alas pigs, 6 billion doses 8 months. concentrated effort easily produce tens billions doses year. won’t to. one two years vaccinations virus doesnt mutate die off. cant get rid flu mutates like rabbits multiply covid19 hasnt shown aame propensity meaningful mutations. Ejecto seato cuz Here's answer Medical Center reported data stating 1,350 ICU patients health system June 30, including 480 patients COVID-19. TMC indicated normally 1,330 ICU bed capacity ""under non-pandemic conditions,"" known Phase 1, also stated ""TMC leaders actively managing, adjust, elective procedures ensure sufficient capacity COVID-19 current number unused beds TMC stands 3,080. ***If needed, Texas Medical's Phase 2 increase ICU bed capacity add additional 1,703 ICU beds duration pandemic. Phase 3 add another 2,207 ICU beds surge capacity converting non-ICU beds.***

So add additional 3910 ICU beds normal 1330 ICU beds.

That's impressive. I'm sure since ICU bed bed. would think sitting closed room recirculating air conditioner running even ""social distancing"" (but without masks) would risky. God. sure stance honestly. But, moment, connected similar names. deep deep moment clarity part. wish every internet user different political leanings could disarming moment. literally one. hippy dippy say, true none less. kind entertaining watching news media try make case ""if wear masks, save economy"" try appeal anti-mask people. sad wearing masks good others enough incentive. Healthcare pretty well paid too.

I'm front lines financial, know they're coming from. days good behavior here. Yeah people foresight see coming less half brain No, it’s definitely aliens. problem definition surge. surge numbers go up. New York City tons cases, masked happening states. NYC getting better, looked like country getting better - even though much country getting worse.

If part Georgia already poorly, another part starting get bad would show surge.

You really look county see going.  hit 100,000 deaths going put decals car said something like ""100,000 dead. America great again?"" got depressed thinking logistics many decals would need keep date scotched idea.

Happy Fourth July, America! described situation used USA though, people would go mental complain deliberate lack testing.

In end same, enough testing. getting 50% positive results, basically working assumption everyone getting sick; hope majority need medical attention. Well authoritarian government collectivist society likely easiest way stop plague. I’m starting feel like 20-35 year old physical specimens effected see idea floated around lot, want add thoughts. would corrected random sampling population, meaning go street randomly grab people testing. that's testing.

Our testing biased toward people want get tested. could covid symptoms, would generally expect find higher % positives among people believe need tested. 

As expand testing capability, testing people might felt like urgently needed tested, getting test can. Generally expect find lower % positives group they're mostly healthy, getting tested can.

So putting together, expand testing, would expect % positive tests drop, even % infected individuals population stays testing selection bias. see first couple weeks June places. steady increasing positive rate even expand testing people otherwise gotten tested sign fact infected individuals population now.

A simple thought experiment. bathtub full balls either red blue, tell red balls tendency settle bottom, blue balls tend float top. pull balls bottom notice 10% red. might conclude tub less 10% red balls, since we're getting 10% red balls spot highest probability finding them.

Now suppose go sample second tub, time sample bottom middle (where fewer red balls), yet still return 10% red balls. would suggest second tub contains red balls first tub. Antibody test doesn’t make sense active case screening. provides ability screen someone infectious time. Totally agree. see point think ambiguity definitions used first post allows interpretation worst passed. People, understandably, bit reactive eight now. 

That said think clarification makes sense, would think lot pressure want over, like indicated memories fleeting. 

I've found interesting read Spanish flu events thereafter. parallels behavior today. Ah. It’s fucked. San Diego County approx 500 new cases. 248 new cases away 50,000 new cases today. welp.

one week ago +36,000. “But freedoms privacy!” Says people don’t realize we’ve spied govt patriot act years. Subbed hard.

You let people submit posts.  contest going get tired winning? unemployment?  Extended? Still seen penny applied mid- March. 100+ calls day, rent due 3 days I'm $150 short, imagine many others similar situations hope Ohio put something similar law. Didn’t already determine virus spread asymptomatic carriers? can’t tell became fake news people stopped thinking literally ever mention USA statement Probably wont even allowed wear one. real. PA resident here, living right leaning community. relatives/older friends Facebook freaking  impression brother made software gave decent amount cash build never stopped. satellites space. think says stupid shit? course. stupid? all. say anything told brother law?

There’s evidence people catching covid beaches. lady saint dumbass. fact took time away eating paint get speak still amazes me.  people denying seriousness death cult responsible they’ve caused. diseases, committing ethnic genocide, trampling agreements Hong Kong name few. Yeah reputation isnt great lol

From u/InsecureWhale51

Son, believe USA free war crimes genocide, got history teach you. new us yes, believe works.  sensitive specific they? NY got pretty control minute. NYC got hit especially hard. 

If want look outside US though, Texas levels comparable Italy, Italy got things control. doesn’t matter though. people drive Vegas Lake Tahoe drink gamble Nevada. half ass closures got us first place. need strong federal response. said testing regularly. McMaster already cleared sports return spectators. Already 49.3k :(

EDIT - is, broke 50.2k new cases today really hope stick it, hope see

""3 Drivers reported refused wear mask, banned 1 week""

""5 drivers reported refused wear mask, banned life"" wasn’t one protesting spreading virus. hear you, white people ones coming code names, “the left”. Black/Hispanic/Asian people didn’t name *ourselves* “POC” like we’re one non-white group. don’t fucking ask people protests .. it’s don’t ask, don’t tell, political Bullshit .. welcome good ol UsA dilemma. GF considering driving LA SF back (800 miles, total), flying son one-way SF LA. keep telling flying son back alone safer option, especially since flying time hour. would stay fuck home consideration others. Man, guy Patrick real tool box. douche. Looking US europe rollercoaster ride hasnt even started looking absoutely insane.

Big F fellow american comrades :( Low, way add feet distance? also going provide drivers multi directional dash cams prove cases said/she said asshats gonna spectacle parade? Yes, that's I'm suggesting wait 2 weeks.. Everyone thinks aren’t part problem... stay fuck virginia, thanks I’m sure whether they’re considering PR matter all, course you’re correct afford miss revenue. many hospitalizations related coronavirus? follow Iran’s case fatality curves (so far we’ve following perfectly) we’re due death rate start climbing 7/22: we’re suddenly going start deviating curve better healthcare system, far we’re following perfectly. got one alerts SA like 4 days ago r/noahgettheboat think going catch think better us?

Yes! always amazing eagerly people debase generalities order defend trumps stupidity. beyond simply sycophancy. I’m curious hear guys next talking point, masters moving goalposts. first person Georgia get got fired job Waffle House said upset ""thing"" gonna bad way riders drivers report failure comply. Enough red flags you’re banned.  COVID 19 BLOW WIND GOD  see coronavirus...YOU DIDN'T! THERE! agree 100%. Yeah thats fair...  hope speedy recovery Rep. Shevrin. favorite bit ‘no worse flu’ crowd flu really brutal. it’s slightly less bad something also kill dead, might chosen poor measuring stick. Travel 70-80% pre covid levels. drop still good amount. actually surprises lack cases really. Like tens thousands people still flying around Americans always right thing, tried everything else. Thanks Zoomers. majority country needs come together recognize small, vocal minority highly religious, anti-science people becoming serious threat modern society understand way much power. people get it, spread slow naturally. mean protecting though. know body react. age age thing, mindset. quite misleading, wouldn’t fault someone thinking literally going outdoors means wear mask. 

Governor Wolf’s tweet Facebook post actually say [“masks must worn whenever anyone leaves Yet another grim milestone passed. 

And largely avoidable nation met challenge even semblance governmental competence shared social responsibility. hot it? mom good health?  Seems like many spikes happening mostly among people ages 20-29. Death rate much lower them. Give another month begin seeing deaths older people spread to. everything goes planned, early next year. 😂 Source? According gov presentation 2 weeks ago, like 1k ICU beds 15k total beds available they've thousands new hospitalizations Damn im sorry hear that. hope find suitable work soon! terrible times right now. Well maybe going start completely filling planes they'd able use them. Yeah, lot things going right people stressed. someone heart attack stressed losing job attributed directly covid19? think so. online classes whenever possible. Better safe sorry Nah, god's country Oklahoma. least according Blake Shelton. Unfortunately people visiting Vegas irresponsible. Read: people LA county driving infecting workers. Easy...

Anyone stay home... Ohmygod going kill grandma!!!

Just kidding. Outside fun, sounds good me! Enjoy brief return normalcy. They're beautiful keeping n95 (cloth) mask closed tupperware month ruining mask? used once. How? Required masks. Hepa filters. Short flight. middle seats. Indiviaul boarding. much different grocery store? see somebody doesn’t read entire post commenting!

“This obviously taking current numbers factoring exponential spread could happen speed rate infections.”  Sports happening Pfffft! smart even try. I’m whining life. life okay. people different circumstances don’t see you’re intelligent. Yeah bought P100 half-face respirator spring cases county using it. RemindMe! 3 weeks  Thank you. Unfortunately right. people change hits close home. don’t follow logic.. would wearing face mask reduce immunity viruses useless SARS-COV2 (a virus)?

I could see logic working hand washing though. 

Also, would exactly kind inflammatory statement Russian bot would make. throwing there. Every driver need cameras Doesn’t renovate houses? Why's that? paying convenience. That's fee for. Land ""free"", home stupid. some, number ham sandwich. Ah, yes. classic *muh freedumz expense people’s freedoms*. It’s gross seeing little consideration lives (literal social) unlucky enough pre-existing conditions. Hope mom stays safe sane! That’s humans work. “self discipline” something easily controllable wouldn’t dealing opioid epidemic obesity epidemic. Well, guess know 20 successfully evaded escaped. hope rest least get resist survive parts.  Really? Perhaps didn’t word clearly enough. every state “peaceful” protests, coronavirus cases shot up. makes sense testing worst affected. high positive test rate general means testing enough. really want believe bad kind terrifying means really take risks, risks would improve mental health suffering quite bit due this... I'm trying stick smart, still terrifying.

Accepting bad implies lifestyle scary own. like vacation planned, say hurricane likely strike. really want go still. come reasons like ""ohhhh they're fear mongering"" ""NOAA wrong often"" give reason go, can't comprehend really shouldn't, implies reality denial of. Easier denial gamble people, especially people cheering saying ""it's flu"". right means still happy, they're gambling it.

It's still hard believe relatively comfortable existence past 40 years live something like this, global pandemic, think lot people refuse accept it. Accepting terrifying denial since beginning. n95 masks good, see many people wearing valves. CDC show 300-700% increase pneumonia deaths five year average states. I, one, surprised learn drastic aberrant increase unidentified misidentified covid cases. China lied, people lied. 


Oops sorry US. JetBlue ad. theres way keep operating little occupancy planes. Theyre trying get us fly again. get they're locking down. Economic concerns.

I get they're mandating masks. would slow spread kept things open. finish game? You’re wrong. Killings cop seem headed wrong way.

The real battle excess deaths, suspect, going people trying sort “consequence covid” “consequence lockdown”.

I know least 2 people personally experienced delays least couple weeks chemotherapy schedule, example. untreated heart attack, untreated stroke.

Inevitably elderly / mobility challenged persons fell homes could get help, people would normally noticed they’re won’t noticed isolating themselves...

People die kinds crazy ways. That's true town Northern CA filled parking lots tables we’ve also blocked filled side streets. I’m creative solutions fighting virus! 

We’ve lucky summer mostly nice far. Normally 100+ degree heat would pretty common time year, although it’s even common August we’ll see local restaurants hold up. it.  232,657 - 222,917 june 30 = 9740 Dam ok said good news? Look hospitalizations across state. Look state Ohio’s r number. course anyone get tested free testing lines going longer. I've heard one, time we'd month 0 recorded deaths country. So, lot cases then. already going take big hit every day americans cant travel EU. Thats huge business hit. going drag months now. rate point world trade resumed everyone states south america. genuinely dont get CEOs clamoring nationwide lockdowns, better get hit next 3 weeks next months.

Guess would rather people die pray vaccine bail out. driver Maine got ""fired"" Uber recently cancelling rides people wearing masks. Pretty sure he's sueing them. I’ll keep prayers Mr. Jones. u Cool wish joke. try play lesser two evils game comes politics God he's making difficult. Fast food one best quarters long time. know Taco Bell did. struggling keep drive keep dining rooms opened sanitized work less money. Oh Alabama...😞 Also, able fill entire soda lid ketchup Now. Let’s aim 100k... jesus.. Alright stop growth rate listen

Ice back brand new pathogen

Covid grabs hold tightly

Lung like harpoon daily nightly

Will ever stop yo know

Turn vent I'll go Yeah also less testing. what's up? I’ll put burden proof provide data illustrating correlation BLM protestors’ positive tests VS anti-mask positive tests. BLM pro-mask protest. Dude. Relax. That's fine everyone reddit make six figures today? Setting foot inside McDonald's pretty common experience us working stiffs. Well, lately, still. simple pr stunt them. Seem like making mask mandatory enforcing punishing drivers do. give RKO outta nowhere? booked flight Norwegian, gave credit end 2022 also added extra credit. try get refund, know trying force not. Fuck American--have pay extra wifi notify flight home changing last minute every time. True, paraphrasing myself. said bit that, anger evident voice. get reference, stay home. vulnerable. Yes people bots downvote anything truthful China. longer dither, worse be, longer pain last. there's huge mystery deal this, 40% idiots country stupid stubborn what's required. yet today 51 deaths recorded worldometer, state (so far) FL.

Maybe leftover nursing-home deaths? Back worked office (I boss) staff could bring children work pinch. desk set could play games computer. worked really well. staff respectful colleagues thankful trusted enough still job. kids generally quiet well behaved. Nobody abused it, fact think staff upped game knowing part team actually treated people.

But every office culture handle that. guess lucky employ really great people. need UV. know get sunburned drive around sun day. That's windshield blocks UV. no, getting sterilized there.

You need wash hang actually outside direct sunlight. get one UV sterilizers. (Citation needed) purpose initial lockdown was, make time scientists figure else could stop disease.  figured -- short-term answer was, masks + distancing.  government ordered everyone wear masks, condition let lockdown.... would problem today. read someone description family getting it. First husband gets it. week later one teenagers gets it. week half teen gets it. two weeks later mom comes it. yeah spread inside household couple weeks. Florida, Arizona Texas... get serious. Exactly, seatbelt protects user, mask protects everyone else. long take get Americans wear masks? chickens roosting people believe masks effective ones made political issue tied identity it. Nobody saying masks work Fauci said back March. and..they add exception counties fewer 20 cases follow mask mandate. strategy reactive rather proactive, want wait there's actually cases mandate masks... Breathing heavily. US going get thrown sixteen feet top hell cell like 1998 again. Interesting , state smart people making progress. Unfortunately Florida doubt it. least, re-open, massive outbreak children, shut again. point it'll late. hurricane season right around corner. It’s shame didn’t lock northeast since knew better. Good luck.  deaths clocking 6k, cases 50k, straightforward math gives 12% death rate infection. Since best estimated death rate Coronavirus tends hover around 1-2%, 12% wrong clearly cases netherlands underreported. may going (almost 600,000-1 million tests day leads cases...) deaths still trending down. Haven’t 1,000 deaths day since June 9. Haven’t 2,000 deaths day since May 7. single-day peak still April 21 2,749 deaths. seven-day average lowest since March.

Even 4,700 deaths—nearly 2,000 single day peak—*every single day* rest year, still would hit 1 million deaths US end 2020.

Want bet it? It’s definitely lot worse they’re reporting probably lot like trespass warning. Basically property owner keep it. people like, ""you're trespassing go jail,"" true. Typically get warning, second time may go jail. That's horrifying right. good sanity? someone office test positive Covid. internal contact tracing 9 employees spent 15 min office past 2 weeks. Called around today schedule tests employees earliest appointment July 7 [Ctrl+F REAGAN]

Yes. believe asshole elected president. re-elected. bet funeral home lobbying behind this. LOL listening something. contact tracing BS logic conspiracy theories people getting riled on. Yeah, reluctant use cloth mask disposable ones awful. tried wished would sooner! could wear day, it’s mildly uncomfortable. Go Florida! Way go! Florida governor !!!! mean someone actually GOVERN !!! R0ll Tide Nashville surrounding counties Mexico Latin America. It’s South America.

Brazil, hand, South America Latin America. kind idiot thinks separate health economy?  6 months ago

FTFY many absolute failures leaders , can't fix real problems they'll take whatever made held victories concoct . Middle ground social distancing, wearing masks, proper hygiene. Cant those? middle ground. both.

Survival metric matters, there's qualify life thing, too.

Every instance person economic opportunity escapes poverty / near-poverty middle class measurably improved quality life. state. police exempt mandate. Lol know anecdote is. 24 state prisons PA publicly funded, easily verifiable, anecdote lol. 

My claim 8.8% incarcerated people housed private correctional facilities. Obviously number even lower talking private prisons. no, segregation happy by-product. Grouping together like makes look like there’s lots black people attendance really is. That’s works. It’s exponential growth works. starts slow curves hard Much rather first one. point child can’t take care yourself. bot serious joke would fine ENFORCED NATIONAL MASK MANDATE Lt. Govs responsibilities? well contagious car accidents? already knew thatb *with* ridiculously militarized police. 

The people power. Spain brought 2,000 people back life...no one battered eye lid. ""no county municipality require anyone wear mask"" ""business required allow employees wear mask"" ""everyone everywhere must wear mask"" less month. Man, hospital data we've lost access projections must horrifying. hard tweaking test get 3% Classic Florida, always bragging. “Sit down... humble” right, did. Thanks! vote anything Facebook site losers, evil people, etc. ⬇️ Well, everything shut except specific stores let certain amount people queue two meters apart. Plus government paid 80% wages anyone furloughed.

The police made sure one traveling around country (even though one high profile cunt got away it) public spots closed. started 7th, would Sunday thus giving 2 Sundays week know report days. start day. June 11-17th June 25th - July 1st.

Also, use worldometer suggest go projections tab US. Go daily deaths. super accurate thus far great tool. Could worse. NYC doubling every 1.5 days.  Trump stupid lazy oversee concerted federal response. Throwing individual states early failures Trump's CDC FDA heads way create distance Trump fuckup.

It worked! supporters either believe coronavirus fake otherwise fault man charge country. Yes! throw life away, god. good day. breathing problems feels like bone pain. Biggest thing Dwwine said F it, let counties handle it. chart probably better compare with.

In Illinois' case things looking relatively flat despite additional testing showed chart shared. Fake news expect Face, leadership following party line. currently hellhole known Florida, confirm nah.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’ve never happy moved back north..... never proven single state trying hide anything, FYI. Lots conspiracy theories, zero legitimate proof. Screwed up? Sure. outright fudging numbers? proven. Dollars donuts result Russians meddling. ? Show study says otherwise, hypocrite 

Crack books might know thing two can’t imprison innocent people expect comply. Duh. Umatilla surprise, Washington Multnomah still leading way number cases. Although umatilla states largest prison makes sense. Polish guy Facebook group I’m argued COVID didn’t spread well, overblown, etc. tried tell situation US went lalala can’t hear mode. said: persisting search stick, always find something could use beat horse. Regardless dead horse.

In another comment, also pointed importance context. Without context, pulling quotes spinning narrative always devolves said/she said discussion. tiring productive.

You ask questions ""Why"". that's good question. instead looking else said, overall situation time, discussing that, jump conclusion: lies politics. leaves zero room discussion. I'm willing engage that.

You read fear run sparse supplies warrant white lie. believe does, simple reason people would teared apart lost trust together get told dire need of. conveniently forget experts desperately urged stay home, stay home, stay home far effective anything else. lie then?

Life reality complex singular, easy narratives used soothe pain, frustration, anger powerlessness. understand that. expect accept narratives face value end undermining integrity institutions people spend lifetimes researching fighting public health.

Like said. feel frustrated, hold politicians ideologies brought world situation accountable. Vote, call representatives, speak up, show positivity affirmative action. Simply yelling ""they lied"" holds zero value propose constructive alternative. Probably shouldn’t moron gone rally governor pretty much said fuck lt.governor support   US tests 550,000 day, plans capacity 1,000,000 day September read yesterday. Today read we're hitting capacity several areas start administering tests symptoms again. Strictly speaking it’s sigmoid growth basically looks identical decent fraction population it. also worse/new. globally dominant strain Europe, USA South America dealing with. co-worker block party... said everyone social distancing it’s okay. I’m like said went clinic... none immunocompromised, presuming 65, choose chance COVID-19, 100%.

It Australian website talking Australian state. 

You expect posts next week two local transmission almost eliminated Australia spiked state Victoria. stop using term ""kids"" refer adults, that's I'm asking. brought doctor thing comes place, doctor saw still view younger generations kids, even though many us adults years families. care still view adult children ""kids"", child. know 30 ""kid"", seem realize even youngest ""millennial"" 20s. directly asked consider millennials kids said yes, I'm sure still trying say ""30 years old kid"" said consider millennials kids. Hope speedy recovery him. Proof everyone asymptomatic even know single shot reload weapons still manufactured. Driving seems safer sheer number people would around airport airplane another airport another airplane another airport. That’s five higher risk situations. would like send everyone involved research flowers symbol gratitude. BMI 28. also asthma. walk 15 minutes car 107 degree florida heat (thats temp heat index) every afternoon. work also lot labor intensive parts job (infrastructure - enjoy it). wear mask day without issue. Yeah, change masks gets sweat it, always mask on. Username checks out! Driving. matter many people encounter getting gas, food, etc still can't imagine would come anywhere near exposure would get airplane/airport. Also easier keep distance jammed plane. literally understand cost living changes depending live. live crazy lifestyle. lives area that's expensive 3 children take care of. Plus ton medical bills children medical issues babies. really hard understand every area someone lives cheap. nuts think someone sell house move cheaper place can't find work pandemic. That's way go. 

you rip sutures bleeding slows down. would go away randomly. Like miracle

What Trump really means death numbers ""low enough"" WH view, let die whoever needs die, get it. tried message much backlash, moved sideways to: go away, worry, stop looking, test people, report deaths.

He staying original plan: stop caring happens people, certainly stop reporting it.  idea you’re talking about. Guess traveling majority world isn’t good time vaccine social , lot nations opened allowed visit friends family continue normal lives mandated masks social distancing regardless vaccine comes later. passenger, I'd like know enforced drivers whether requiring drivers understand properly wear mask need to. providing requiring education proper mask etiquette important. Last week got Uber driver wearing mask nose. 5-minute drive wearing mask (correctly) reluctantly got in. 2 minutes in, driver **removed entire mask order sneeze**. even cover face, windows closed. I'm lucky going home could immediately strip shower, I'm still way scared possibility getting sick. 

I trying contact Uber customer service week now, refused acknowledge issue repeatedly closed ticket without responding. like rainy daaaaay taking Lyfts nearly every day Las Vegas past weeks maybe half drivers wear masks themselves, NONE required wear one. Federation American Scientists wants buy middle seats, don’t think anyone stop them. 4th July weekend one night stand. Peer pressure ultimately thing really lead people complying. one thing worker tell put mask, cop, tens people store yelling put mask make ego shrink fairly quickly. CO2 accumulated brain addled him. I...I really understand. leaders orange county entered chat. thing tho countries would ""more vulnerable"" vulnerable US Sweden already through. basically free rolling. I'm glad hear restaurant taking excellent measures ensure people's health. done right, risks lowered/minimized! thought lying covid numbers CXMMUNIST thing! post r/trump. Makes sense.  gotta hold breath six minutes someone sneezes. Cool. That's why, swab tests actual virus sent lab. antibody test checks antibodies done rapidly site. Antibody test less accurate due speed cost makes sense screening check. honestly many names. grew predominantly black neighborhood. listened way blues, R&amp;B, hip hop. always big blues fan growing up, family listened older country actually liked. Waylon Jennings, Cash, Willie Nelson pop head. loads others, hear forgotten names. pop country took early 90's, mother sister got really embarrassing degree, hence dislike it. feel artists bad people anything like it, mean, make money love. started become one dimensional me. became popular stations replaced blues like version preferred hearing. would need exceptional numbers remaining texas counties put play. Imagine kind cretin would go event like Latah county Moscow ID located, currently 20 cases.
Let’s see 2 weeks much jumped. currently mask ordinance started, it’s little late that. Americans need stop bringing countries like India, Venezuela North Korea examples show US “isn’t bad” “isn’t bad country” it’s pathetic. Maybe compare US “rich developed” countries ask US isn’t like instead bringing poor, developing countries distract issue ... Five stars doesn’t help next guy waiting ride though 🤔 protests. fact states reopened without taking full percautions seriously likely reason surges. protests even riots around new York, see significant spikes comparison states reopened advisement . -is- exponential growth, exponential since things open. fuck science long people’s feelings aren’t hurt Indeed. Enough archive digging, see Storm Front guys planning infiltrate conspiracy movement 15 years ago. even right wing psy-op. Pushed even extreme recently. hospitals laying staff time needed most? Lack revenue elective procedures bad? would think ridiculous healthcare charges would plenty money saved time like Dude, would lose shit someone took mask car. Probably good thing I'm driving more. read fail see said 100% excess deaths covid.. said it’s indicative covid deaths undercounted. longest I've noticed 80 days. Today's report contains deaths occurred April 30th June 30th That's exactly doing, they've reducing number daily tests last 12-14 days order get fewer new cases (testing ridiculously low even that), pretend going great growth rate confirmed cases slowing down. yes, actually that, congratulated sucess Monday. thankful employed. It’s bars, protests. headline question mark banned Call order. use 3rd party ordering sites take cut. definitely use uber eats shit like that. 100%. definitely far think, maybe days later.  reality getting several airplanes 9+ hours really really bad idea would've postponed anyway. people can't see would big enough need travel Europe justify risk. 

This good thing Europeans Americans. Travel bad idea everyone now. mean, saying ""because testing more, finding more, hence calm down, bad looks.""

Or

""They testing more, hence panicked past.""

These different things. Anyone taking Ryopus seriously spend half minute browsing post history.

js got home gym states capital (Harrisburg) 1 person wearing mask Whole season, even makes preseason. I've saying ""Thank god outdoors.""

Outdoors safe properly. people cookouts tubing like social distancing matter outdoors.

This coastal area. beach safe. keep distance. go bars, restaurants, shops, bathrooms. stay outside great sea breeze keep distance, fine. people that? No.

This beaches end getting closed. suppose area contact tracing may tell people know.

I got tested painless convenient free live. (Result negative). see Ireland seems get virus control now? good!

(My holiday year would Ireland since Sweden played two Euro 2020 matches there. Flights, accommodation tickets booked. hope played planned next year instead).  Unfortunately acts intelectually weak disproportionately harm constitutionally weak. We're roughly new 9/11's worth deaths every three days right now. Maybe death rate starts dropping instead rising relax. wearing mask public places darn much sacrifice you, stay inside home.

This feeling pouty it. I'm sorry brother-in-law. also asked r/COVID19 expert's word this. course masks protect others, less clear affect wearing one someone sick, especially people sharing misinformation particles can't contribute viral load. ignorant leaders, one thinks covid fake says covid affects rich Europe's good position Covid numbers, China mass-producing it, open license available virtually everybody else + shared tech Gilead basically start 'immediately', lot likely already have.

The click-bateyness even article written seems extra twisted make look worse time many much terrible things already (and likely come) pay attention to, specifically administration doing.

It feels like manufactured outrage, plenty targets genuine outrage always stronger.  Back? would stop certifying every 2 weeks? 

There's option covid-19 work know Galaxy brain See response said Rhw flagrant disregard life staggering constituents dying outside NY/NJ/CA/MA. F- us, right? I’m 61 think rocks makes much better /s don’t know make comparison. Free speech one thing, regardless format. Words words whether spoken, written typed whatever medium one uses. However rifle compared semi-automatic weapon 2 different things. semi-automatic overkill. wish... Karen. Yeah man mask stuff bringing crazy full storm 


So seen interaction COVID Karen gas station. minding business mask shit lady barges talking masks dumb work evil fuckin THERMOS blessed farmers priests Worcestershire. praying ancient ruins Worcestershire wearing evil satan masks. 

I MAKING SHIT UP


I wanted film fucking bad didn’t want bring unnecessary attention myself. stared REAL deeply Arizona iced teas hopin would go away

I live LOS ANGELES. WORCESTERSHIRE case misunderstood reddit post? PA wave covid, likes south seeing.

Just numbers declining, people acting like masks end world even saw thousands cases day.

We forgot month. We're idiots. Dutch CDC powerpoint agrees 98% asymptomatic claim.. Mexico. multiplication taco spot

wtf this? going say, Legend several apocalypse movies start Vaccine.. virus Well, I’m sure treatment BLM protestors received given folks, right? Teargassed, pushed, shoved ground, etc....right? mean, equal treatment, can’t possibly fathom would different protestors others.... Optimistic yes. But, relying vaccine excuse itch travel social dangerous. articles write hypothetical time frame doesn’t help governments put shut downs place  staff testing positive 

Holy shit organized studies least two cities, Seattle Minneapolis. would expect willing report bias sample direction? can’t even think direction might be. love people rude awakening coming become hospitalized this. think lot people pneumonia before. take mine car, say - leave on, forget put back on.... Hah, thanks. Wish could change username smth meaningful now. CCC initials lazy day. drink Brawndo!!! covid deaths per day year would make 3rd leading cause death country know someone corona virus, claims better week half period. passed 48 hours downtown Denver, drinks DIA got plane. do? I’m sure didn’t recover fast? possible recover completely week half? Thanks sharing - I’m actually McHenry. let family know this. also likely take long time produce doses. Given poorly US government dealing logistics, sure one working making sure enough vials keep dedired production rate. Again, large number words justify belief COVID cases vulnerable age groups, know developing larger larger numbers across Sun Belt, 0% mortality rate. that's way current case surge fail eventually produce measurable surge deaths.

Finally, Pence agree something! Yes, sure days ""just like today"", nearly 50,000 new cases, hundreds deaths, dozens states running incontrovertible facts a) put people together close quarters virus going spread b) significant portion population, thanks boss, wear mask observe social distancing, matter c) add ""a"" ""b"" together, faced inescapable conclusion way, all, many businesses reopen safely absent vaccine.

Where idiots now? There’s lot gray area unless one exceedingly small number people detailed health directives beyond DNR, decisions regarding end life care made loved ones consultation medical team. case, third party given durable health powers lawsuit wife sister.  means patient is/was unable make decisions health care. 

Nothing case, based information article, signifies anything appropriate care, given inferred condition (nursing home, paralyzed, BI, 3rd party health power, pneumonia, palliative care). say doctors involved failed job incorrect wholly inappropriate. normal hospice patients eat drink near end life.  concentration camps nicer, right? needed intubated.

AGREED! 100% agreed. needed intubated, chose addition, would needed Remdesivir. 

Disagree. would great, but, needed increase chances survival. We've treating without Remdesivir point, still investigational status approved COVID, arguing needed like arguing needed hydroxychloroquine alternatives exist. 

They chose intubate him, treat all, solely believe effort better spent someone better quality life post recovery.

They even fucking feed him... gonna argue Texas food shortage too? Mickey spread cheer (and COVID) children world! reading thinking ""oh, keep schools remote,"" missing point. Well stated. Actually, study shows exactly Face mask use could result large reduction risk infection...with stonger associations N95 similar respirators compared disposable surgical masks similar.

Masks appear help, especially respirators, needs studies masks specifically.

Distance important, maintaining distance isn’t always option. Masks preventive practices help, especially maintaining distance isn’t possible. Ehh birth control wasn’t really thing 50s. seems little different. Maybe couples sex would also imagine lot people choosing delay kid.

Though without pandemic, I'd likely procrastinate house work go friends pretty bad countries too.

More 99% persons heart attack survive without hospital intervention.

If there’s high probability you’re facing heart attack, getting immediate medical attention right call, even meant going catch virus — doesn’t necessarily, even did. brief glimpse conversation, I'd say wrong. asked question (“What mean? he’s paralyzed brain injury doesn’t quality life?”) provided clear answer that. sugar coating it, dancing around question. man paralyzed, brain injury, breathing trach already, serious respiratory illness. don’t honestly believe capacity quadruple teaching force matter weeks. funding so, teaching going incredibly difficult job year. can’t speak nation wide, school several teachers retire quit rather deal job won’t know love rather enforcing masks, distancing, constantly sanitizing. top risking health. backlog teachers clamoring fill spots, there’s money pay were. far right outraged. Weird world. Thank 😊 India 80% cases asymptomatic mild symptoms means virus affecting much body. 'Murica same? NBA playing next month going clusterfuck clusterfucks Whoa.

No - I'm state medical plans. abundance people living best lives without mask.

Edit: grammar someone can't pay, treatment done obligation, person who's life saved debt alive? assume debt moves next kin person dies negligence? Huh? death rate percentage positive cases going change. We've 6 months study virus point death rate pretty well understood.

Edit: still bad idea midst record setting cases. thought using baseball would best way probables merely come contact probable. judge video warned would happen said would never able “get front story” did. are... problem number doesn’t take ages account. Age literally biggest risk factor virus sub Saharan Africa’s median age something like 18. Italy’s 40. virtue age, every sub Saharan African country won’t IFR 0.4%. They’ll IFR average whatever 18 year olds plus whatever lack hospital infrastructure adds death total. Federal government- need reopen economy trust people responsible 

Alabama college students- literally going intentionally infect people Coronavirus It’s joke it’s policy lol personally guarantee Nixie said true news, sky blue? virus doesn’t give fuck politics. 
We’re second wave Melbourne, Australia, left wing city country. bit late damn expected point: ""this systemic patter shouting critics BaD PErSon"".

Except people claiming doomers. point people address govt corporations. really see happening should. soon FL runs tests? [nice  guess help pay winner’s hospital bill. friggin idiots. SMH silver lining this: number people dying COVID-19 still low. expected see steady rise last weeks, nothing far FL. weekly increase TX AZ. biggest worry younger people driving new outbreak infect older populations susceptible symptoms virus. Remember first president tweet Twitter Fox News said “unpresidential.” Lol ""Hey kids, Disneyworld opening, wants catch virus?"" need significant change quickly.

Bernie way better place DNC threw away. Idk answer point bc biden sure hell ain't going fix situation. 

We need medicare all, green new deal, stop Military industrial complex invest people instead war death. Keep mind number nearly CERTAINLY underreported Finally good use taxes. projection sticking out... Lol. Right? TIL north east states protests. *eyeroll*

The surge much better explained local policies local population's compliance them.   imagine parties + covid mass murderer wet dream. know positive people deliberately going spread virus? seem investigation wrong doing. Yea, I'm Mexican too; fucking moron. pass time things do. course country normal again. That’s hyperbole. figured. insinuating misleading title non-americans, maybe is? Exactly. Ahh yes, old ""My old book tales tells get vaccine"" (Please show verse said, honestly would love know interpretation here). Never mind using technology scientific advancements post lame shit likely vaccinated kid. Vaccines hands best health tool ever invented, saved countless lives heartache. much worth reporting what's going US. International business trade still thing, us share border US right concerned. No, would rather die tired /s obvi = (R) matter since vaccinated infect vaccinated anyway. Good know actually. Thank you. Good lord.. suppose mine heading way quick keep expodential growth we're experiencing.. trying tell Chicken Little sky falling? could? argument anecdotal evidence, best. get pay for, workload school teachers insanely high. going best, incentive so, paid little. 

Additionally, field attract people would REALLY good teachers due awfully pays. Instead deemed ""oh love it"" job. 

I want doctor, lawyer, pharmacist, mechanic, \[insert profession measure competence here\] job love it. want they're GOOD it. America, treat teachers like babysitters, pay like it. $2/hr per kid so, yeah? important 4th July weekend. sure place shutting fully expect Florida obey shutdown rules start congregating like crazy. happens people, institutions, government think ignore problem enough it'll go away.. think seeing standard cross cultural lens.

If ask anyone one western country another western country they're likely think wild social partying that's see them. There's media really interested covering much given population home watching netflix night. generous. Fauci ""not promote masks"". literally said ""They effective preventing general public catching #Coronavirus"" (This march btw)

If consensus, claimed, say masks work? Data Mining? That's one positive then. believe yesterday's test really low comparison, correct I'm wrong. Apparently haven’t seen curves Europe versus US. Europe playing soccer doesn’t mean US position play football. [here ya SB county closed everything well, plus going hot weekend huge surf. beaches closed Ventura Newport Florida protests wearing masks? I've heard many states Florida. strange la saw increase.I cant imagine why. Probably reopening. Yeah must why. lied. nothing since healthcare workers didn’t masks supposed get lie. ICU staff N95’s reuse day day. Everyone else thoughts, prayers, trash bags. Hospitals still reusing masks. They’re taking whatever find handing staff without fit tests. Even public started hoarding wouldn’t matter. It’s worst case months improvement minimal none. http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_20200702.pdf

169,106 total cases today. 158,997 yesterday. +10,109 agree, beaches pretty good, however boardwalks mess. went one boardwalk packed. People everywhere. That's true all. vast majority Florida residents regional mask mandates, bars closed, large gatherings banned, restaurants 50% capacity. things started last week, another week find going effective enough. Maybe blame Lmao unfortunately see shit even Sgt 😂 people dumb Well yeah, given progress given recently Oxford similar medical institutions, I’m least going hope folks figure out. explain placing tube lead aspiration? thought went esophagus. end producing saliva choke on, process placing tube lead it? [BLM literally one day, 2hour outside event. don’t know live, people returning school work, commuting daily crowded trains. People gathering often bars izakayas (packed, indoors, masks), would rather concerned relatively small-scaled protest. Florida cracked 10K today. Who's next? Dat exponential growth feel stylists. People protesting open soon possible. Who's say client one exposed stylist? 

The Great Clips story MO said went urgent care diagnosed allergies (and never offered covid test! 2 days later actually tested came pos). see happening right MI. Allergies awful time year easily misdiagnosed. Real Americans like ""I need breaks, hard work solves everything""  NYC fine thanks. It’s clear stops August 5th?!! early?! we're learning philosophy businesses self-regulate right thing wrong. It’s believed he’s gonna person color , woman VP Weather pretty weird here. could hot hell today tomorrow would rain heavily night. could hot morning rain heavily evening. fucked omg isn’t small, insignificant minority. It’s significant issue. Maybe look US curve vs similarly sized EU. head start, yet, are, completely break exponentially. 

This second thread you’ve slithered shitty defense stupid people. hadn’t even thought this. sad :( report released May (article found May 4) states based newer information infection spread, 18-24 months expected population reach 70% immunity. I'm sure I'm allowed link article here, search ""2 years coronavirus"" articles pop link study itself. weird headline. long Donald Trump access Sharpie, we'll fine. could argue Louisiana second wave otherwise yeah whole world one large prolonged wave spreading time though different areas. would say areas legit seen second waves Iran, Israel that’s (although even idea it’s like US different area country getting first wave it)  Make America Shithole Country - MASC!! dude wrong jump. Grain salt nope bars serve alcohol Tell truth. public knew doctors hospitals needed masks millions donated. tell us truth, would asshole hoarders existed anyways, would millions people looking old shirts put around head. No? ended lockdown. Dutch article linked rn. Generally: high voluntary compliance =far less strict lockdowns. lot harder keep high quality professional teachers staff pay like trash collectors (literally average salary state), especially considering could go university private school huge pay bump.

Also education needs changed past 30 years, computer skills essential almost career path, computer labs cheap purchase, install, operate, maintain.

Some valuable classes took high school actually translate useful skills electives (ie: personal finance) non core classes would first thing go schools budget takes hit. doubt we’ll severely affected they’re producing consumables like never before. Supermarkets would dumb capitalise time high demand correct - need edit wording. According source, people getting massive clotting (she's pharmacist mixing solutions keep bay) causing gangrene. Destroying organs, limbs etc. 

I suspect we're done we're going population survivors looks damaged WWI veterans.  suspect it. (I responded comment read post, saying thing.) would useful see mortality function ICU capacity. Whatever say now, first one blame mask confusing. rate US hit 100,000 week two...

Without even considering effect 4th July have. Yeah, jajaja think adrenochrome conspiracy theory regarding liquid knees. ridiculous sounds. one done 2 days ago, idk lady right basically took nostrils go way in.

Sheltering place challenging children. really weighing long-term psychological impact young versus near term death general population, oh yeah, economic impact. appears economy wins matter factors reopen things. ChaChing Hospitalizations fatalities lag testing. people getting positive results today likely hospitalized week, fatalities av well that.

Assuming 10% hospitalization rate, that's 5,000 beds needed week today, 500 deaths 2 weeks today (assuming 1% case fatality rate). agree, chance mutating something worse probably low, chances would even lower less replicating. Also, since contagious carrier even develops symptoms, affected, becoming deadly reduce spread much, would less deadly version much advantage. name one thing? first estimate that's believable. Reporting country could less accurate many cases driven political interests. gotcha Floridian here. sure county county giving home school option. son compromised immune system going do. seeing way state handled pandemic way grown adults excessively ignorant infection control, risking health well being. outdoors safer COVID. People stupid things bored reality, virus going anywhere hiding house. one issue consider, see study far, main worry beginning. virus might find good spot rest mask, mask gets moist leaks virus inside well touch outside, potentially exposing others longer while. That's medical masks worn maximum 8 hours. fair assume know much virus.

My personal impression seen read time (I'm expert) COVID-19 survive (and infectious) surfaces well assumed beginning. well thing guess is, people wear masks short withdraw areas need wear them, mask getting moist.

But believe issue people wearing masks political oppinion believe severity virus mostly political PR show is. hoping covid positive person attends funeral people present? hope didn't. exactly mother experienced hospice. provide comfort intervention. unable swallow anylonger intravenous feeding would considered life prolonging. hard uncomfortable decisions end life care family nature beast.  school even started yet. I'm fucked. possible effective vaccine ever found. disease vaccinated current technology sure thing. vaccine always big ask: needs almost never cause disease vaccinates against, major side effects confer immunity fairly reliably. don’t know what’s stupid. wearing mask thinking COVID Polio lol people things stupid/extremely misguided/pray don’t face ramifications actions. You’re insane believing corona Thanks multimillion dollar idea. Butt masks. next big thing. crowd hostile objective evidence benefit since day one. Hospitalizations hit new record - lot. Turtles Mask? assume... Well, there's even 5x ""hidden"" case count top (which pretty conservative given high positivity rate) they're 50k day including everyone, quarter percent whole population. That's percentage point half every week. that's conservative. Everyone working brain concerned health family's health.

Cities, states, countries fighting fought virus firsthand healthy respect virus damage do. mostly people sheltered misery (they never virus, know one virus) ignorantly mark 'just another flu' that's overblown go day nothing wrong. never saw Cuomo rescind order large public gatherings really legal. legal parties attended. NY certainly hesitate bust heads folks protested public week prior blm protests reopen. sure anything selective law enforcement.

I also hear anyone killed property damage horrible parties.

Not defending parties - I'm criticizing unequal enforcement - noting unequal enforcement/tracing even going single largest number people exposed. even look like really trying trace spread much punish specific activities. Hope Florida reconsiders Disneyland way California did. 

Disneyland suppose reopen week two rising cases CA, governor put hold indefinitely. 2 3 day span? Regardless FL never seen single day jump anywhere near 18,115. administration, well several irresponsible state governors made first shutdown completely pointless. might well never shut Yes also said deaths per million better indicators total numbers, agree with.

So I'm saying is, USA still worse Europe combined. individual assessment, USA #7

When factor massive discrepancy population density (a huge factor), USA easily front runner worst performing country world... know least. necessarily trust Russian, Chinese Brazilian numbers... non countries great company in.

As 250k... hope I'm wrong, experts already predicting 200+ people broke law refusing talk contact tracers. agree point incarcerations, people could placed facilities could specifically hold individuals coronavirus. serious shit, message needs don’t follow rules, consequences. dumb ass kids Tuscaloosa willingly attended parties knowing infected. It’s time put end it. many deaths? tests? get wrong, Reuters incredibly credible source, source ""Reuters tally"". Nowhere mention 70k tests done; shattering old record 60k. Percent positive slightly dipped 15% 14.6% today. great numbers that’s whole picture. Obamas ""prosperous presidency"" economy propped via fed QE larry summers oversaw ""recovery"" (AKA wall street giveaways) AKA: ""I want equal attention cake"" Stay home worry wearing mask. lived somewhere getting 8,000 new cases population 30M I'd lock door weeks, that's twice bad Italy peak (6k case 60M population)  obvious Summer didnt kill Corona heat, maybe need little ICE?...

I’ll ask her. took someone close got sick, month nobody else seems gotten sick. course it’s anecdote doesn’t prove anything. might have, anything, good placebo calm anxiety. Nobody talking mental issues caused people locked house months months. Yep, distinctly recall claim US early well. Homemade face masks 'bad idea' precisely wearer would likely adjusting playing mask often, thus getting germy little finger close mouth/nose/eyes. Fauci's claim discouraging people using (hoarding) N95's needed frontline workers *also* true, swear recall less CDC first warning *against* public masks. proof contrary right front us (across Asian countries), alas.....

Unless stats back up, really think that's true. states surging right Trump country (except CA). Northeast Midwest decreasing.

The fact reopening distance initial outbreak major factors accurately correlate surges. they'll restrict requirements people pretty much 100% likelihood it.

then they'll restrict people hospitals enforce this? Tens thousands infected kids, what? Send em home parents spread throughout workplaces etc? Fuckin crazy. makes sense, realize little people know care anything outside little bubble. countries might well Narnia, far they're concerned. Deaths numbers scary anymore, fallback case numbers try rile people again. fly last week isnt experience looked like.

Actually good service industry skill.... people waiters high end restaurants servers reflect that. Considering cost living making 100k? hard job. already know correct answer here... sympathy people. They’re beyond saving point. went major county sites checked numbers worldometer reporting, mostly accurate exception Riverside 600 cases rather 300. besides that, LA, SD, OC, San Bernardino correct. article listed doesn’t even source info, state number. Also again, posted 6 hours ago well counties like San Diego even release information.

If 9,000 referring yesterday, doesn’t make much sense either given fact Newsom stated daily total around 5800. CA gov page hasn’t updated yet, I’m unsure they’re reporting 232,657 cases despite fact clicking see breakdown data doesn’t show July 1sts update Where's video party falls floor? read otherwise

I think so. coronavirus proofreading mechanism RNA polymerase enzyme encodes genome. 

Please feel free provide evidence prove claim. See, could maybe even buy one! theories tout make actual sense. arguing someone today kept saying it’s hoax billionaires media. Like what’s punch line?

Hopefully things don’t get hand, voters need remember every needless life lost politics science. Iirc difference rolling averages updated bloc finished trailing average dont.

A trailing average would give constant daily/hourly update averaging last 7 days.

A rolling average would give weekly update last week's average. obvious.

If one day run 1000 tests get 100 infected next day run 10,000 tests get 500 infected might erroneously inclined conclude number infected risen 500% !

In reality number infected actually decreased 500% , went 10% infection rate 5% infection rate.

Once normalize increased testing compared earlier year see things right worse deaths way down. Jesus We’ll new VP next week. late. Won’t work. going able golf quit bit soon. Canada getting like 2-400 cases per day even reopened indoor dining restaurants Ontario. Meanwhile Texas, 50% capacity bars closed. Oh noooo poor people lol. store since whole thing started reason. get everything delivered, hell got beer delivered today. Damn party shall named. state allows take alcoholic drinks. tried ordered damn, take away. love idea cocktail go! may enforce it. county California masks required months (long statewide) eventually became norm wear one least indoors. everyone concerned spreading virus, they’ll still wear mask avoid sticking like sore thumb. said, cases increasing. I'm single, family, one actually cares me. Infect me. That’s funny, can’t remember last time world shut flu season.

I wonder deaths would look like did... Source? seems way high. Friday usually highest, might see 55k. happening literally never mandated lockdown. government asked people physically distance implement basic precautions stores (hand disinfectants distance stickers). combination effective testing president managed literally takes keep virus control. 

Forcing people wear mask outside human rights violation, plain simple. understand recommended small isolated indoor places outside? That’s sad concerning see someone europe. mean working whole time. much family receive government stimulus? think corrupt greed remade Wow. highest level unnecessary hostility ever encountered life.

I thought maybe something wanted quote cut paste error. ill intent whatsoever. 

Maybe go walk something, going give stroke keep level random seething anger strangers. Based serosurvey data, CDC estimates actual number infected individuals 10x higher reported number. That's kind PR like see biotech. Non pumpy. That's actually good sign. ones claim world ones worry about. Uber? five year average works 300/year pneumonia deaths year 1800, 600% increase yearly average. insignificant blip. ongoing pandemic kills people via pneumonia dead tested living can't even get tested local governments openly obfuscate data support reopening... smoking gun need? really. flew couple days ago. planes airports really (mostly) empty. airlines operating loss flying small percentage flights. Damn, can't even give Chilis two weeks see grandson? Yeah, see news articles yet, went this. good source though. 50 degrees (122 f). Im healthy, mom 65 live father thats 77 years old occasionally get hungry double cheeseburger go mcdonalds. always drivethrough though. seating made uncomfortable hard plastic designed make people leave quickly possible. would want eat place want comfortable? city metro statistical area 145,000 rural Minnesota 20 ICU beds. Oh yeah love wegmans. wish wasn’t tight beginning. good far. Town center whole another story Seems hit paywall. folks come woodpile incensed celebrity would ignorant, remember stop, collaborate, listen... much major contributing factor see now. anyone know states haven’t reported yet? Here, mandate must wear mask windows down, someone car household. windows alone people live with, take off. good perspective, usually lag tested, hospitalized, dying. mean that? Right, surge starts June 15th-20th, according data. We’re like startibg hit 2-week mark, declaring “it’s two weeks, rise deaths” disingenuous. Pre-mature best. mean? specifically told experts elderly underlying medical conditions die COVID-19?? I’m reporting fake news /s  Hospitals shouldn’t businesses. Right. think confusing statements leaders WHO, CDC, et al. right beginning wearing masks/not wearing masks, led people say hell it. get speaking close range without mask could well infect another person-- assuming symptomless carrier speaker. mask protect eyes. Speaking podium nobody else around demonstrated leaders day--and that's probably fairly safe. meeting like speaking of, sometimes person stands chair, no? normalizes idea wearing mask, 30% country seem understand. WOwww CA TX FL AZ gonna new NY Coronavirus. Houston hour houston. 18-29 age group far cases, followed 30-39. That’s overall, new surge. Someone would look historical data find info. pure, grade a, idiot logic.  ""That'll never happen me.""  Well hey, YOLO! He'll steal car license, though.

I'd probably go flight, I'd research airlines still booking middle seats, any. Delta Southwest still limiting capacity, think. could also look least crowded flights, though idea patterns travel day covid-restricted flights. anecdotal evidence means little evidence points minor asymptomatic cases overwhelming majority young people. Young people die flu, too. don’t base policies anecdotal evidence. evidence significant long term damage virus vast majority cases. 

“Beatings continue morale improves.” Unfortunately, amount risk satisfy people like you, you’re easily willing dismiss proper education, socialization, mental health outcomes, small businesses. inspire insubordination and, unique way, contribute epidemic. Thats means. Hes asking people prepare scenario delayed, should. people get complacent things get worse get better. Doesnt bearing release oxford vaccine track winter release things stand.  also say extra deaths happened died Karen called cops count too.

Are Karen deaths way up? much? Houston Fire Chief Samuel Peña said paramedics sometimes wait hour emergency room workers scramble find beds staffers care patients brought ambulance — bottleneck that’s tying emergency medical service resources slowing emergency response times across region.

I see fact highlighted nearly enough anymore. main danger Covid-19 death rate (albeit still fairly high compared flu), relatively large number people needing hospitalizations coupled crazy transmissibility. overwhelms entire systems quickly, lowering standard care across board, Covid patients.

Avoiding whole point flattening curve. nowadays people run around pointing death rate like thing matters. course death rates Covid shoot well system crashes.

The PR work everyone involved educate public pandemic, including Fauci way, pretty abysmal.  Yea 2009 swine flu lethal enough almost contain Passed believed politicized drama. willing gamble lives — economy — it. Deaths lagging indicator, know week two. also think people irresponsible catching spreading right predominantly young healthy. getting point saturation vulnerable people going start catching despite taking precautions. *me lives shitty border town* FUCK! Hippocratic Oath physicians... hate living state wear mask grocery store kids parents call freak.

There's level urgency here, one upholding social distancing guidelines. Everyone acts like pandemic they're sick inside. agree. company policy requiring masks seems better company policy requiring masks. 

Regarding Uber drivers - way dispute bad ratings might given masks? Drivers seem pressure regarding ratings, needs way insisting masks screw up. Ik I’m kinda late u looked tweet got bit hate towards people don’t wear mask  suspect going bad time prison.  reelection absolutely agree regardless Mayor Pete...  Seriously, counting thousands deaths reviewing every death certificate easy. Cuuuuuuuuuuuute!! Come on, let's dog Alabama hard. state top 50 country comes education. find interesting wife wear makeup (maybe) 2 times year (not even lipstick) hassle her. seem indicate putting makeup fun you. 

Both perspectives cool. like complexities make women. whole point UBI longer tied shit job make ends meet encourages take risks like opening business raising children get job like offer healthcare. sane individual would ""encouraged"" live $12k/year. There's incentive world make that. required drivers stop raping people too. That'd nice. toddler back happened. Covid seen lens pro/anti Trump many unfortunately. nice attempt no. might. There's whole branch Christianity believes break bones, pray god heal instead seeing doctor. Remember Texas hospital ordered stop reporting going hit 100% capacity? isn’t politicizing point lot leaders states currently hit hard actually said that. Oh what? 5G towers come we’re gonna get scanned? We’re gonna get scanned we’re gonna get temperatured? We’re gonna send kids school masks??? INSANE?!?!? 

Sincerely,

Residents West Palm 

I hope answers question  think Trump administration, shitty ass-backwards may be, even remotely close bad CCP?

If answer even ""maybe"", encourage read horrific stuff China's behind recent years via search engine choosing. Yikes. must terrifying you. same.  Simulation confirmed direct flights Bagdad, Arizona message say?   Staff needed people hospitalized COVID-19, pandemic lot people opting elective procedures. means hospitals weird place need people also losing money laying people off. Make sourdough starter. Infantile behavior has-been faux rapper. Herd immunity? bulk entire population told coddle immune systems whole fucking time they're still suggesting so. herd immunity cause morons cannot grasp immune system works. rather blindly listen state. 



It's unfathomable many young, healthy people walk around day fucking mask People can't accept ones nothing lose. predict “fun” epidemiology/population stats/sociology battle going splitting excess deaths “consequence covid” vs “consequence lockdown”. Sometimes infect people love, want money. better medical bill.   anybody idea getting historical data amounts stores were/are operatorating mini malls like? Let's start fining use revenue pay people's covid related health care bills exceeded insurance greatly pay first place. minimum, way keep hospitals getting periodically unrun hot spots. need plus, hand sanitizers mask. passenger without mask, driver provide mask ensure everyone’s time wasted. words made letters rise. .. 50k.

Fuck. Gonna rough couple weeks least.  understood no. Ironically ""emergency"" dental surgery too. kind makes sense though, see wanting risk it. They're shoestring budget, they're probably equipped deal outbreak, ensure facility safe operational else. Treating someone COVID could end harming others facility compromised.

I'm sure needed surgery positive could refer somewhere else equipped deal that, I'd taking bunch debt instead paying $60 get wisdom tooth removed. China, ‘hiding’ would title. Even moms husband thinks it’s fake! heart problems gets likely die that’s worst :/ yeah it’s pretty insane mean even president think it’s gonna go away. Makes feel bad American! stay safe!! guess protect yourself. critical thinking skills here. inform me? Extremely sad see us peasants squabble $600 week. fact everyone getting fucked except wealthy making decisions fuck us damn pandemic. 

 Unless owner fortune 500 company least concerns. one, good thing people incentive stay home facing choice forced go work meatpacking facility family evicted next month. happening large scale states using reopenings ways getting people unemployment. always exploits every system, least time system benefiting average working class person, rare thing America.

If real problem ""how much"" someone making unemployment right kind deterrent going back work, think maybe problem wages meaningfully risen like 40 years higher? enhanced benefits months, people realize importance reliable income. distraction much people making much anyone make unemployment covid day refusing part start blaming systemic failure. Elites give shit us steal way $600 week.

People working frontlines right making insane money hazard pay, market actually rewarded value someone provides appropriate labor compensation would certainly case everyone keeping society running. unfortunately that's real world works. 

Get mad right people, government failed people really afford ride matters magnitude anyone unemployment rn ever ones making decisions. Maybe try Etsy. decent form fitting ones. Link please, Texan, say we’re screwed! Please vote sorry leadership come next elections. think (hope) forgot /s see somebody understand exponential growth! 5 points economy changed mind, thing matters stock market. Yeah get stabbed question gets paid. People seriously hurt, even killed, trying enforce mask wearing honestly, lot driving, i'd get plexiglass shield front back seats already did. People leave house clothed **mostly.**

Now I'm intrigued live. Er, asking friend. also add barrier driver passenger safety. needs drop zero get hero.

I thought retired along time ago, got Real Estate.  wayyyy higher talking people never got tested. 10x estimate backed couple antibody studies, everywhere certainly several places. also studies showing TCell reactions without antibodies add even more. Pride makes people stupid. know Americans said over! stop testing much that’s there’s spike, inconsistent information sides media, incompetent leaders, well entitled people “muh freedoms” go away it’s right? Lol Tony Stark get hair transplant though. 28%?!?! Cool, need blast air back compartment ride, next rider exposed lingering droplets aerosols excreted previous one.  rate hit peak hospitalizations around peak hurricane season. Yeah shot direct message. definitely educated anti-science. talked plant-based diet stuff able find source supported mask wearing site preaching plant based diets. It’s easy argument, explain you’re side care them, they’ll hear out. I’m euthanasia laws. don’t understand removing feeding tube someone slowly starving time somehow ethical ending suffering quickly. title read - First wave got restarted Florida relocating West Coast? 360 million people 

3 million weren’t locked down

Close enough government work called flatten curve? convice someone thinks hoax? going keep breaking records every day nearly everyone state exposed virus, lockdown month. 

This exponents work. viral spread works. exactly sort thing lockdowns preventing, states opened skin evidence reasonable so.

The lockdowns really work happen virus prevalent feels like making big deal nothing. Florida fucked. two shows already “not going open” list. 

Link full list. 14.6% positivity according article. what's name sub? remotely true. Testing random population; heavily biased towards symptoms think may contact infected people. WaPo analysis presents fairly compelling case majority “excess deaths” allocated, allocates causes COVID-19.  die, it'll be, ""So what, hundreds thousands people die flu every year."" ""Until late 2017, estimated seasonal influenza associated total 250 000 500 000 deaths causes annually [1]. Recently, however, three different groups provided estimates influenza's annual mortality burden using different methods. first published, US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) coordinated WHO, estimated influenza associated 290 000 650 000 deaths respiratory causes alone"" two jobs. two kids. :/ Nice, sounds like something look forward lol. 

Ah well. Guess that's lot life. Especially since absolutely work done make option many men would even consider. comment basically saying women working problem need stay home, majority men right would choose SAHD social narrative feel good it. life absolutely easier terms work. husband got laid manages childcare now. job savings enough support family single income. clearly ideal situation family, title article clickbait.

There plenty single parents managing work take care children time. don’t know it, much interested hearing story hers. sure getting much less sleep much less support, still love children work time. stop killing disabled people calling triage anyone Florida characterize kind people getting infected broad categories? mostly college kids in-state, tourists (yes counted), elderly, hedonists what? isn’t cautious, it’s insanely reckless irresponsible, simply make profit. 

Disney's probably best example, alot businesses faced hard choice, reopen regardless risk simply shut forever.

I know restaurant scene home town take years recover ever.

What expect? People give lives entire work without fight? inter-connected nature looming large school-wide discussions. teacher's home district goes rotation model one work full time?

I solo parent would living reality child adulted. 

Maybe write article? job is, don’t want kids anyways I've seen stupid shit posted sub, stupidest thing good minute thought replaced coronavirus task force Ministry Truth? /s Unfortunately, Desantis already stated has* intentions going back lockdown. Well think HIPAA plays big part people believing deaths real policy allow sharing protected health information without consent patient. someone dies COVID19, listed male/female age. People building conspiracies lie, ""everything"" listed COVID19. 

I think helps little deaths family speak out, point, little late people still believe nothing cannot happen they're younger invincible. 

At point, know US recover. much dimmer March. remember boys girls, seasonal flu worse /s even debate over: easier pass trough one barrier, trough two barriers?

This kinder garden level puzzle. assuming people get proper treatment ability get medical care. 

But think it’s ironic many people concerned economy, backfired forcing places close second time. many people may die, hospitalization rate lot higher medical debt they’re left straining. Uff wife haven’t worked 6 months baby due another 6 months. encouraging stuck country away family. worry stress everyday mom went church last Sunday hugged man later found tested positive. Really hoping catch it... “equity” actors? Actors get equity/percentage profits? Don’t forget Disneyland canceled it’s re-opening. Disney World MIGHT follow too. state in? cough upon star

Makes difference are

Coronavirus heart failure

Will come difficult part would prove friend infected anybody else crossed paths final weeks. friend gun pull trigger? wave, tide None anything cops. get super worked up

There’s pandemic. probably one legitimate situations actually get worked about. One researchers delete social media accounts due constant, vile abuse. 

Who? makes blood boil. take never lived rural area. (Not meant insult)

They do, rarely, stores mostly empty. Rural communities sparsely populated largely cut rest society. someone gets sick, they're spreading outside immediate family. easy contact-trace unlikely occur. Thats surprisingly close doubling every week. look possible future:

July 9: 20,000/day

July 16: 40,000/day

July 23: 80,000/day

July 30: 160,000/day still early stage going 3,207 5,004 close doubling. increasing 2/3. doubling one week, increasing 2/3 next week. may mean continues increasing 2/3 week, rate increase goes 1/3 week.

If goes 2/3 week like 20k July 23rd. Hang on! though supposed go away? 

Why position we’ve done deny ignore it? It’s return the, 
Oh wait you’re kidding
Trump didn’t say think did..
Did he? mean? Didn’t read it. plan?   wife work full time, kid starting kindergarten year. idea it’s going work required homeschool well.  Probably moved apartment bit city--no point paying city rents work home mean, bias showing moment post tagged ""Good News"". kid kept going he’s baby keep distanced better (only 6/8 kids room) would pay regardless. exactly situation. I'm fulltime single father two, pandemic started forced leave work one help kids.

I receiving sick leave FFCRA program, coming end, employer decided withhold last payment, leading call US department labor start investigation. dont know if, might possibly recieve payment.

Recently area they've started reopen summer programs limited capacity, spots filled fast. Even vacancies, fees astronomical, going 2 half times normally pay school care. able afford them, make barely enough dont qualify childcare assistance. 

Not mention son born premature, underdeveloped lungs. spend two months neonatal intensive care facility able come home. Hes older now, still worry. 

His primary physician told whatever feel safest. I'm close homeless two kids. Rents due, I'm going screwed soon. hell supposed do? I'm going lose everything. racist say bad viral epidemiology congragegate large groups? .... Field studies? 2-3 weeks protests right now....how America new coronavirus cases? Well field studies would say remarkably low rate. That's comforting know... Wish true. Really? know something like serious enough cause menstrual issues. needs done. helping one another! demanding government employers individuals willing do? Band one two friends neighbors, create coop families. Stop waiting someone else tell help family take charge. Nobody cares loved ones get sick worse, die. learn lesson hard way. wish people would act better care others. advances vaccine science tremendously valuable. manatee mandate mutated many mandatees. positivity rate keeps going they've maxing testing capacity couple weeks now. Silly, become TP Going good. current positive rate high, though. mean agree friend fucking idiot, Carlin quote goes- think dumb average person think dumb half dumber are. think policymakers take responsibility providing proper guidelines spewing misinformation stupid masses. know can't expect anything federal government point, theoretically trust put misleading information. probably knows already, tell again. everything right, informed boss on. reason collegue died based crappy business decision manager, probably managers boss. 

It possible everything right, still lose. known Mandarin's Manatee Mandate. mean, I've said twice think parks open. know trying convince. never said fine. I'm going July think risk great.

I think outdoors *less* risk inside, sheer volume people presents choke points problematic even outside. mention indoor components (rides attractions). 30-40 year old divorced people scaggs incompetent ever hold relationship long enough get married 15% positivity rate Florida. Mexico 50% that's hospital tested, related tested positive hospital. know someone taking in-laws exchange months childcare. mean, allows distance better lower density, allows children human interaction teacher class. kids’ connection teacher strained lot spring, building rapport Sep-Mar. can’t imagine weak kids’ engagement fall teacher they’ve never met person.

(It’s got definite downsides, don’t think I’m saying it’s ideal.) pay taxes check can’t figure stash away taxes it’s them. hard though, barely anyone really afford kids now. sort make sacrifice make work situation. Deaths lag. Wow that's entire state since pandemic began, we're talking shutting bars 200 new cases average per day last 10 days. Wow expect  Driving hour(s) get bloomin onion won’t stop everyone, stop many. Two wrongs don’t equal right. US “leadership” also tried corner market vaccines one point early disaster, keeping track. Knox County, Tenn. mayor Glenn Jacobs — 20 years wrestled masked Kane — voted “no” mandate masks fight COVID-19. Jacobs cast “no” vote Knox County Board Health, final tally 7-1. quote statistics appear show Colorado relatively successful managing outbreak. However, like states (with possible exception Hawaii), Colorado's borders airports open. think people Colorado secure success given carriers virus free travel there? Ok, current positive % ~15% would need perform 333,000 tests day get 50k positives.

That better?  Virtual teaching challenging, especially teachers tools training use them. Also learner's hard engage virtually. lot respect teachers need step virtual teaching game, districts need put lot support place. done properly significant difference modes education, requires much planning work virtually. RJ Nobody said first wave needs recede first. multiphase wave. Dude what. Italy 240 000+ cases. Sweden 70 000+. Parker resident! keep reading things getting tested go get test you’re feeling fine following mask distance recommendations working home?

I thought covid late March got negative antibody test Friday. consensus lasting immunity I’ve read cases antibodies “sticking”. Thanks Yep, passed father’s pay last year. mail carrier 30 years feeling might reason - thanks! matters happens trend come back affect us people start getting careless we're at, rn they're starting let people eat indoors restaurants well open bars think based we've seen FL, TX, undermine work we've done point course, depends speaking personally someone voicing general position sentiment. personal level, usually perceive education conversation may change things. noticed ""open up"" demonstrations women men wearing masks. always good open realize need close save sanity, nothing else. can’t love us worst, can’t us best. Jk. We’re fucked. anyone else party die virus?  cause messaging? 

COVID-19 cause messaging, without COVID-19, messaging happened.

And fear arrive nowhere, ot happen covid-19. happened COVID.19, thus cause fear. worst kind people bad people convinced side good. party, started feeling sick

by sound time party feeling it, already it. Russians laughing asses right now. Rights vs Duties. actual fuck. Arkansas many schools going offer online option. problem becomes internet/computer access. Many, students school work internet home even access computer.   already violence masks stay home orders. need adults room step start making rules. Fucks sake, shit. damn thing changed one bit. never watched news social media wouldn’t know pandemic right now. Well, good something done, I'm happy feeling isolation possible curfew again. week ago looked like we've defeated virus I'm saying left leaning cities US generally gotten now. Like New York City example. add Chris said, important also take break constantly consuming media phone TV. Try get outside. Knowledge empowering I've found think something else hours really helps. really also something ""self care"" meditation talk - help. hosted town hall mental health experts provided great tips: also free, online mental health screenings - they're good way check mental health figure need reach someone talk: got vasectomy? one? another man knew positive attendance didn’t disclose positive fact? false. Huh? Decreasing percent positivity good thing. flip side, child born year could one solves climate change problem.  job market. many us here. think protests didn’t infect anyone ignorant. going beach BBQs.  

The problem US everything puts two political parties other. 

I hated seeing people protesting closings also protesting Floyd. first thought goes hard work closings. Maybe like added flus together. never understood people call hoax. explain dead people real average flu season? entire world like something? Especially things like happened history like bubonic plague Spanish flu. Spanish flu like 100 years ago that's like great grandparents lived depending age... That's long ago. still know anyone died saying. give downvotes! Merica #1 Public health government function individual goals collective goals well aligned. Citizens want save themselves. caring financial mental health. 

It takes government authority explain rain drop feels responsible, rain nonetheless causing flood. Government sooner command every citizen's social behavior stop rain. 

We ""beating"" coronavirus. ""Beating"" not, may never be, goal. accommodating coronavirus. goal prevent marginal deaths occur hospital capacity exceeded. People cannot saved ventilators die. People mild cases recover home. results merely data points public health track spread. concern managing hospital capacity coronavirus infections stabilize. No, name Union. would change far separate states’ handling covid? Tell would better that. Disney fans always brutal group Wear masks. Wash hands. Socially distance. *(all three)*   know political everyone tries make it. think people tired jerked around ""experts"". Seemed like conflicting studies masks, work bit there's enough, wear one. think everyone fed all. People broke job still know asshole elbow virus. Covid-19 economy lockdown economy. Braindead ""Pro-lifers"" (Anti-choice) trash showing unintelligent are. trying compare wearing mask saying body choice anti-choice ideology women's bodies. things comparable though, idiot would compare two.

1. SARS-COV-2 virus contagious kill others around cause lifelong organ damage. that, actually cause recession entire country. wearing mask increases likelihood spread virus kill innocent people. Wearing mask wearing mask affects others around you.
2. fetus growing inside woman's body. affect anyone woman fetus drain body's resources actually kill her. Abortions affect anyone woman herself. 

These protestors bottom barrel comes intelligence human decency. understand it’s hard believe unsubstantiated claim like though right?

Not claiming it’s true. However, would note difference many might give lip service pro-life people hard-core pro-life. story first posted LifeNews.com pro-life news source promoting dignity person, mainly fighting abortion &amp; euthanasia. Lack national leadership made impossible. mean look Sweden way deaths per capita even US. really say handling pandemic well... Remember seeing 3000 cases day, shut entire country treated like pandemic?

Now look US hitting 50,000 cases day people want inconvenienced enough wear mask. biggest problem America Americans like trust other. first thought ""We need stop together!"", instead ""Do think going tell do? lying me!"". Okay, 130,000 people died, part, due failed leadership spreading misinformation him, administration, right-wing media. 

Better? Likely teachers became ill tested kids. wife works early childcare school Oregon protocol place someone ends sick. agree. heard local news state usm (university southern Maine) classes resume August 31st. follow guidelines masks dependent students.

They plan open till Thanksgiving break send everyone home break. break, students remain home online learning. come back depending situation.

In terms hs lower education. Students given option attend learn home. able change choice daily occurrence.

To me, sounds insane. Schools cease pool diseases. going lead mass infections. Kids go school, get come home kill parents.

No one safe. L🤣L hahahahahhaa that’s amazing! Aaaahhhhhh course we’ve got COVID cases... man we’re fucked. find site surely find site admit 900 ICU beds filled 2 believe we're different measures what's happening states. European countries opened pubs see spike, similar setups place. Gotta stop first wave second though. Wtf happens nearly everytime heavy exercise/cardio... figured normal patient almost certainly already hospice getting covid. Here’s reality check-

If death rates indeed rise, jig up. find re-election motivated governors going sit butts hospitals turn people away possibly even collapse.

If seriously believe governors going sit watch unmitigated disaster happen state, don’t understand governors do. seriously suggesting lot better? GTFO nonsense. consider one hit. others matter. Yes generally wear one go store. rarely go stores, grow food amazon everything. wouldn’t go party 5 people haha . don’t go restaurants though open. everyone taking seriously sure everyone NJ either. asking raw data analysis supports view contact tracing countries uncontrolled outbreaks meaningless. read anything suggests that. Cough Cough Covid Im one house goes work right mom due chemo stepdad also medical leave husband stay home. left work early day son fever definitely work thankfully everyone tested negative. job allowing teleworking scatter schedules wear mask everywhere. guidelines seem worked job. Hopefully gives piece mind. someone mask politely ask put one walk away! going engage child - hope enjoy grade 10 Lol apples oranges. even read posted before? Holy crap. WTF butt chug done? think still early.  Minus vaccine, going see states pop various -- oftentimes unpredictable ways. I'm firm believer taking note hospitalizations, ICU utilization, vents positivity.  know seems like tired cliche, really want see happens hospitalizations ICU use two weeks states.  know cities already popping (Houston, example), key system handle influx patients. quarter in? I'd say midway second quarter. hey... I'm journalist :) -- Chris Vanderveen swing it, camps daytime activities. Maybe babysitter grandma watches kids day. 

Don’t options? find way old enough alone eldest watch others. 

Childcare mess started, made worse. Much like health care, housing, employment. Fun! Tells dire situation is. 

Ethics privilege Damn people could say came contact people fuck lol No, fear cause. Fear caused virus messaging. I'm going say food, lockdown I'd want Indian grandma backup. Look NY biggest protests world possibly .

Blame federal politicians state politicians failed Certainly, ongoing concerns schools opening due lack control spread virus. good news children/kids appear lower rates infection virus (unlike flu example common kids). But, school practicing social distancing, putting limits classroom size etc. remains possible source increasing infections COVID. risk also comes parents, teachers, staff coming school interacting other. 

The flip side coin many children, especially special needs, languishing without school environment may need come compromise schools indefinitely closed. need safe manner, using learned virus spreads reduce spread.

-Dr. Kohli family refused care another family member gets mad treat patient. happens time. non story people Healthcare. Really scary, idea widespread virus is. 

If governor would take look state hospitals Arizona... state closed down. never even tried control shit storm pandemic friend showed Tyler Childers recently, modern country be. conservative counties (Orange, etc.) around LA County spike first. people drove LA County work pleasure started spiking there. say Latinx, sincerely, Latinos. Answer numbers quantify ""surge"" ""spike"" NEWS 9 - completely arbitrary words numbers behind them? lol graph flattened sense word Agreed. friend's district told parents could choose full distance learning full return school. hybrid model option. district full return all. choose hybrid model, full distance learning, independent study (which involve remote instruction parent instruction), grade 7+ join district charter pick classes kids take remote attend school person (so theoretically kids could return full time, kids need ""minding"" way little ones do).

On one hand, district makes harder parents full return option. hand, I'm convinced friend's district going crash burn end shutting everything implement distance learning everyone like spring. hybrid model, easy transition kids online there's outbreak. close specific schools confirmed cases, spend week two deep cleaning distance learning, kids go back hybrid model. they're distance learning start, becomes much harder shut school continuing education. hope least students returning full time set distance learning case. Okay that's dumb shit, vaccine may available 2-4 YEARS. expect children miss 2-4 years school?? hope enjoy society whole generation missing 4 years formal education. mention deaths abuse malnutrition would result children access school resources. people website touch insane. complicated issue friend. There’s many factors account for. address family patient, clear, concise communication imperative. course empathetic something healthcare providers practice. 
In emergency mass causality situations detach somewhat ensure you’re logically dealing situation. I’ve end life conversations patients family interrupted code called 3 rooms hall that’s pre-COVID days. 
I understand point you’re trying make. fundamentally many issues American healthcare system needs corrected. COVID going stress system near collapse. Bedside manner luxury chaos. Ah, Cape too? Pretty fuckin ridiculous people behaving here. Monkey Bar closed singer house band tested positive. closed THREE days.....three. Ah yes, virus gone now. 

Oh Backstreets restaurant....righttttt.

I really hope school thing gets delayed. DeSantis shown record waitin ABSOLUTELY LAST moment anything. absolutely insane consider opening schools right now. No. median death rate .25% lead “ludicrous” conclusion scientist worth salt would give potential range early stages disease. Rather overly alarmist right start.

Case point. .01% ludicrous... 2-3% organizations like CDC trumpeting.

This well reasoned article touches many points. variances outcomes nation, population age etc, also touches impacts aren’t discussed taking back seat righteous crowd “no one die” (even they’re 89 multiple health problems housed SNF ie Hospice)

Meanwhile effects national global economy going cause level pain suffering including plunging additional people poverty / starvation line. (the righteous never seem care less fortunate them, could they? They’d longer victim did)

I also like mathematical comparison 1918 Spanish Flu, much people like compare them, it’s correct Covid roughly 1-2% lethal Spanish Flu.

Reread message, that’s sound person emotionally responding something don’t like. probably can’t appreciate nuanced article want submarine based low side early mortality range. Pittsburg week doctors appointment childerns hospital. Compared rural area impressed many people wore masks. Yet people saying little wear masks there. perhaps area Pittsburgh? 

Last time went grocery store one 3 people wear mask saw. legal CA I’ve looking rates testing cases per 1,000,000 population feel like US getting bad wrap. average 105,000 tests per million 8,000 cases. Whereas, example France 20,000 tests. testing done countries believe US would looks bad countries shut borders us. comments?

Wandering Earth cheesy presentation, science all, Accented Cinema put - deep deeply Chinese story it. . 

Personally, notice super-pro China stance either. contrary, found refreshing how, whilst China Chinese chars center plot, vibrant international cast plays vital roles entire way. American movie, Canadians even show press button restart engine; existence would played laughs show all. contrast, Japanese, Indonesians, Indians, Russians featured poignant side-scenes Wandering Earth. Canadians, course, still show :p .

Even minority top 10%, model minority still horrifically damaging. used racists cudgel minorities, used dismiss concerns difficulties faced 'model minority'. Furthermore, called model minority often excludes people like us anti-racism considerations - hell, we're painted oppressors called 'they're also white'. really dumb.

Thanks, yeah - really dumb black-and-white 'you're us us' 'you're XYZ sympathizer' stance - they're extremely dumb. support Bannon's notions going war China breaking China bajillion states, I've called CCP sympathizer. No, think entire notion's retarded, wish Syria country, no, idiot wants paint sort CCP sympathizer member. Yeah, F- guy.

The right move would blow wide open, pass buck central IMO. Knowing pandemics, damned do, damned way harder don't. again, I'm guy.

We shutdown March FL what, 1500 TOTAL cases today 10,000.

If shutdown 1,500 total, open schools 5 weeks-ish 10K day? estimated combined isolation tracing strategies would reduce transmission mass testing self-isolation alone: mean transmission reduction 2% mass random testing 5% population week, 29% self-isolation alone symptomatic cases within household, 35% self-isolation alone outside household, 37% self-isolation plus household quarantine, 64% self-isolation household quarantine addition manual contact tracing contacts, 57% addition manual tracing acquaintances only, 47% addition app-based tracing only. limits placed gatherings outside home, school, work, manual contact tracing acquaintances alone could effect transmission reduction similar detailed contact tracing. scenario 1000 new symptomatic cases met definition trigger contact tracing occurred per day, estimated that, contact tracing strategies, 15 000–41 000 contacts would newly quarantined Consistent previous modelling studies country-specific COVID-19 responses
to date, analysis estimates high proportion cases would need self-isolate high proportion contacts successfully traced ensure effective reproduction number one absence measures. combined moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation contact tracing would likely achieve control. No, peak NY given curve absolutely within next couple weeks. NY peak 3 weeks locked down. It’s also, alone, 5th largest economy world—so high stakes far economic pressures go. Without aggressive mitigation, nearly inevitable virus spread vulnerable populations. kind extremely harsh containment strategy protect old sick, maybe could averted. Florida anything like that.

On present course, matter if, matter when. Honestly try judge people. Many live expensive areas, still lot student loan debt medical debt. don’t know situations. know lot states made difficult apply benefits long interval losing jobs getting benefits many people. took 2-3 months get stimulus check. go ahead sarcastic like honestly don’t know financial situation people. GIVE LIBERTY GIVE DEATH!!!! grandfather passed palliative care unit three days. nurses compassionate medical professionals I’ve ever met. lot times nurses forced give tough love patient’s best interest, that’s case someone dying. also treated grandmother great deal compassion, asking wanted everyone kicked spend time alone him. asked wanted bed him. grandmother declined kids grandkids around helped process death. 

They kind. Thanks everything do. takes certain kind person work field, hope know many people appreciate everything do. New York strategy prevent second wave coming states? totally understand.

And think everyone extremely cautious reading anything believe internet. also know believing ultimately helps anything, right? OK believe I've heard. what? can't change anything. I'm still powerless. 

I also meeting cannot verify anything firsthand. know full attendance. private Signal text someone developed working relationship concerned something familiarity with. 

But said makes sense reasonable given Florida politics. think I'm hearing shocking? I'm also potentially cynical degree always helpful? 

And week last week Arizona Texas hospitals came forward publicly concerns. surprised going public last step series private conversations respective governments. execs host politicians fundraise would really surprised governments dirty announcing world without private unproductive conversation first. 

I would hope Florida hospitals also preparing public statement **but know department.**

So I'm hoping one needs trust me. It'll come light? Nah, ain’t happening. Pretty sure states America perfectly alright people dying long economy goes this. [Seems I'm always sure. think often best start area think life vulnerable worth saving branch slowly there. start assumption since think life disabled / unborn / elderly / immigrant / etc. worth saving, completely calloused heart try start move outward. Confrontation, although main means internet communication, always best changing minds. enforcing quarantines? multiple middle aged childless female coworkers chomping bit get back there. watching opening news bated breath. folks generally go two times per year Disney World must SOMETHING appealing rides kiddie shows. personally cup tea. eager fly hot spot right type vacation seems foolish me. 

Actually, flying anywhere general right seems foolish me. 

Actually, leaving house nonessential reasons right seems foolish me. 

What know?

Edited add: list outdoor activities sound good though. good parent. :) Yes, aren’t getting better despite influx higher property taxes. Government operates differently businesses, there’s incentive improve quality they’re big fail. suburbs actually care quality schools entire suburb literally die schools aren’t good enough. Cities big enough that’s concern, since there’s plenty reasons live city, whereas reason live suburb quality schools sure are. someone gets extremely sick accident falls breaks hip must what? Play musical chairs find hospital help save lives? shit basically aiding abetting death via medical negligence. Someone could die diverted bunch times instead going direct place space. crock shit. Nothing line high number cases, let's hope stays way, need stay vigilant. number deaths start rising line number cases would really bad thing since seeing exponential growth. no, we're going ignore it, think trying imply do. you. information already obvious droplets going stopped mask kind kind object source.  effectiveness n95 masks especially easy find. needed go CDC website one link (for you) says work right next there's another link hospital staff says do. someone make list probable motives obvious what's happening.  suitable medical journal good enough slap mask mug. don’t know.

Dead bodies piling world hoax!

-Dr. Kohli People duties freedoms also. deadly virus raging, duty help countrymen country live stay healthy. Freedom good till doesnt hurt others. Thats laws. He’s wrong ask that, though. Virtually one dies COVID-19 21. clearly health issues contributing here, even tad insensitive. tend like compare us countries. ""best"" whatever takes continue best. Right? used analogy testing allows us shine light virus going.  brighter light, find, also better chances slowing spread outright stopping it.  really smart people want us get point every single person wants test get test.  We're yet places. need better. good metric compare US countries, look hospitalizations.  Cases vary based much test, person really sick, almost end hospital. ""apples apples"" kind metric. -- Chris Vanderveen logical explanation ever. think this. simple math. thank lol actually think almost entirely leadership issue. give people country free reign whatever crisis situation, going go something stupid. I’ve heard mask compliance rates Western countries aren’t anything proud of.

The difference countries control didn’t give citizens option go something stupid. I, too, nut get paid. funny plenty healthcare workers also believed health authorities masks work normal people outside hospital settings pandemic. Feels like everyone breaking records. government anything they're sitting around complaining. Like power stop complaining fucking job liberal media lied ruling reposting lie.

The ruling bans states discriminating private schools based religion. States giving grants private schools, excluded religious schools based entirely religious, quality education.

There never federal curriculum, enumerated power. Curricula states. friend west coast Florida 3rd day fever can't get test. goddamn college tuition. mean come across way, apologies. frustrated, like everyone else. undertaker retired perfect time don’t think it’s entirely fair. people actually vote would simply situation: people hate Trump stands vice versa (even hand scale us) Saying enforcing two different things.  reason wearing mask stupid. rest world would like speak yourselves. never said good. point decrease always good. think reading much initial comment.

True positives cant higher population. would cap. Take consideration also testing kits arent infinite obviously everyone testing day cap would much lower.  Anders Tegnell claims proposals ""sensible"" ""feasible"" time refuses efforts Norway, Denmark Finland successfully carried out.

This ridiculous. least still hard time wrapping mind around idea Sweden somehow every single Nordic country did. Although coming closer accepting idea Sweden may simply overdeveloping nation actually *didn't* resources capacity neighbors did, still hard really accept notion since feels counterintuitive. data seem pointing direction, guess Tegnell thinks too. sure. older child would suffer consequences missing education. 

My son 4 likely going school September. autistic success potty training yet, likely keep home ""clicks"" him. Thanks coronavirus canceling appointments therapists. 

Anyway, could manage another, wife really wants another. I'm stuck though, much would love another, seriously consider long term finances so. Life absurdly expensive begin here. run mill starter home cost 450k-550k here, that's downtown good neighborhood. Can't move farther away want son close autism programs still.

Kinda stuck. nothing virus, lopsided economy provides favorable opportunity financially sound parents. virus make worse, unless tanks real estate market allows first time buyers chance entering things reasonable position. left? fuckin knew cheating! “The number deaths per day USA dropped well peak, indicating spread virus actually dropping. number new cases per day increasing, extensive testing done now.”

I don’t disagree deaths important statistic measuring impactful pandemic is, paragraph feels entirely wrong me. Deaths dropping peak indicate spread virus dropping. could really mean two things:

1. virus spreading among younger population, less likely die need hospitalization.

2. drop cases highly populated city America (NYC), followed drop deaths. cases start rise major metropolitan areas, could see rise deaths following weeks.

Also, say number new cases per day increasing increase testing true. tests return positives, people must spreading virus. mention %-positive rate increasing several states. Check helpful tool Johns Hopkins. Arizona, Texas, Florida prime examples.

# 23 Swedish doctors researchers claim Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell's corona strategy unsuccessful, says desired measures Nordic countries.

In debate post [in Swedish newspaper Expressen]( , 23 doctors scientists go frontal attack Tegnell, claiming strategy gaining control coronavirus successful.
They compare Sweden neighboring countries Denmark, Finland Norway, number deaths, admissions infected far lower.
According [VG's overview]( , 5370 corona infected persons lost lives Sweden far. comparison, Denmark registered 605, Finland 328 Norway 250 deaths time.
Sweden far deaths per 100,000 population Nordic countries. 
The group also writes they, others, wanted introduce measures based scientific evidence experiences countries undertaken pandemic. 

- Nordic neighbors done? closed restaurants meeting rooms, conducted extensive testing, carried consistent infection tracking, isolated infected's close contacts, actions discussed argued articles, researchers write, adding:

- Anders Tegnell claims proposals ""sensible"" ""feasible"" time refuses efforts Norway, Denmark Finland successfully carried out. He's proud watch news. Stupid question, ever fix supply chain issues? Seems like we're gonna need ventilators, masks, etc etc think word ""novel"". feel like writer article valid points, personal experience one privilege, really understates true struggle parents facing.

While sure difficult work midnight 2am, fact still afford pay nanny worked since March speaks volumes me. husband laid off, first thing would stop paying childcare using. families cannot afford nanny, let alone paying one one parents laid off. may able eat. dad admitted hospice unconscious it. became waiting game wondering pass away. given pain killers help make easier. We're headed million deaths. I’m protests, you’re acting like wasn’t factor, you’re really objective  Chinese Bot. 100% live Midwest parking ticket ny figured would never matter warrant pay reference lot talk care plans patients near discharge. provide contact information research team discharge! Typhoid Mary. Come Texas. Vote dipshits! NY reported 300 deaths yesterday day before, 8x increase last week. anyone know bump came from? add another category ""assumed cases"" they're counting previous data? Fake news. Standard subreddit.
The headline article literally says... ""NY, NJ Longer Track Contain COVID, Group Says, US Breaks Daily Case Record Again"" think could spread it? Nobody believes that.

This America. wear pants public, many systems mess up? Harris County, Texas (home Houston), one first places raise alarms wave infections, new cases appear decline.

Can source statement? Everything I'm reading says cases exploding Houston. Aye. Meanwhile, random Danish tourists coming Sweden think Swedes article mainly angry about. There's probably unjustified salt too, Danes Sweden reasons Swedes Denmark for. ""less dense"" ....well respects yes, respects Illinois we’re pretty well too. get placed next guys? states reopen schools september? sure post this. Since related COVID-19 people slipped cracks support schemes put place governments, thought best place. read rules posting. Apologies wrong place post it. way systemic governmental cover-up suppresses free individuals.

Gosh, mean, would possibly benefit that! Sigh. surprised point see oh gee things going planned Sweden, even one little bit. started looking issue went thinking “WTF, *functional* nation like Sweden opting herd immunity?” see it’s actually rather *dysfunctional* nation highly messed medical infrastructure, loads incompetance every level lack resources. mean seriously: Kazakhstan currently testing Sweden is. 

This issue ""eh test yourself"" version contact tracing especially ironic since Denmark started contact tracing first voluntary tracing reliant individual. short order found didn’t work upgraded tracing infrastructure. Many Swedish Troll Brigade crowing stupid Danes think that’d work. that’s Stockholm doing. crow won’t work Stockholm? Doubtful. *Sweden* good perfect something anyone criticize all.


Well, anyway, let’s hope get fixed since possible Test, Trace, Isolate could get caseload quite bit. first one say wrong case count doesn’t go up. problem people quickly forget got us point. literally takes people think won’t get ruin things everybody.  Mongolia second world country humility quit acting belligerent fact people's lives hands.

I think new tactic “stop fearmongering long term/permanent effects! don’t know long lasting damage!”

Completely ignoring whole *WE DON’T FUCKING KNOW* aspect.


...holy shit, actually, lightning moment understanding. arguments come people don’t want care people. Whenever ask to, pointing actual facts COVID doing, deflect *because don’t want care someone else.* assume *if* get they’ll fine, gives shit everyone else.

Welp, depressed myself. facebook littered people like this. Typically wouldnt care, family members friends spouting insane shit. Masks shouldnt damned conspiracy, even Mike Pence Mitch Mcconnell telling people weark masks. Trump stubborn cult members death wish. 


I tried every angle communicate them, building report, considering saying, pandering them, providing articles. Everything could think of. far invested shit able objective it. closely linked identity now. 


I give realized cant fix stupid. maybe Flu counted covid dubbed BLM protests don’t get infected Christchurch? Moscow? Idaho? headline geographically confusing.

If Lagos school would continent home run. doubling linear growth though exponential, exponential would double, quadrupled, 16 times x\^2 starting 2

ex.2 x 2 x 2 linear function F(x) = 2x

2 x 4 x 16 exponential function F(x) = X\^2

HUGE difference 


turns I'm also dumb confusing polynomial exponential via one constant value. Agreed shouldn’t get babysitting business intend watching one child overcharging people it. That’s reality it. many hospitalized damaged lungs (among organs)? keep seeing death measuring stick hospitalizations. sure... Wish tho (and self quarantine two weeks)... -- chris Vanderveen Didn’t read headline, like, day ago? surprised. addition rides attractions there's also many events, limited run shows, things like draw in. 

I've 3 times 8 years still done half rides I'm events stuff Dr. Kohli answered question recent story did: -Stephanie like crevasse - always there, hidden. kept merrily walking along without care world stepped bottom, going shock shattered legs starting hallucinate dehydration. Yeah, like protecting nation threat security. Oh god though that. Another Harvey Katrina even something smaller would death sentence pretty much anyone hospital. Great... know Lots outside transmissions Arizona? 

Do share appreciate expressing skepticism.

We police content protect dangerous misinformation. 

And I'm always concerned saying something like this. 

I want lose job person lose theirs. know information helpful anyone counterproductive. 

I trying balance privacy think people right know. know I'm even right thing. Six words define entire crisis day fucking one. mindset. face covering covers mouth nose children also wear face covering day.

-Dr. Kohli First, beach worry, outside sun proven impede spread virus.

But Florida beaches lined bars, restaurants, ice cream parlors etc., folks come close contact prolonged periods, possibly indoors amid recirculated air AC full blast staving July heat.

I live Michigan, protests, too.

On May 26th, protests started, Florida reported 424 new cases.

Michigan reported 223.

July 1st Florida reports 6,563 new cases. Today, 10k.

Michigan yesterday: 361. new numbers today.

We shut 2.5 months. Florida shut 2 weeks.

So please, explain mass protests experienced across country every major US city seem affecting States like Florida, Texas, Arizona lax guidelines implemented prevent spread virus, Cali opened much studies yet, still ongoing month. Disingenuous request made there.

So yes, agenda, post history precludes it.

Also, initial post *sure* include word ""riots"" bearing increased spread virus, take account would likely given far fewer people participated violent acts peaceful mass protests.

Given insistence mischaracterizing birth mostly peaceful second civil rights movement, reader already draw easy conclusion feel events attempting blame false beliefs severity pandemic.

Honestly think smaller, private schools could probably successful results. Big state schools hand, sure. ‘a lack uniformity among safety measures compliance likely cause.’ AKA poor leadership top. back fill dates. 158,997 cases total yesterday 169,106 today. headline accurate new cases reported state. NY ever reach 10,000 day? I’d agree good points models general. guess interest Dr. Samet getting assumptions from, they’re slow change relative (the University Washington model example). instance, believe least early models operating assumption R0 virus 5-6 opposed 3-4 evidence of. making 350 week hand entire check. Relatively spot on. Something like 600 around June first.

That happened China. Except banning extreme price gouging, Chinese government never ban selling medical masks N-95s regular folks. result, Production rose 2000% less month PPE shortage lasted couple weeks even though 99% 1.4 Billion wore masks daily. think pride gluttony.

/s response questions:

1. know virus spreads much efficiently indoors outdoors. China, woman symptoms went restaurant spread virus 9 others, including sitting away her. could indoors, air conditioning create drafts carry droplets. wear masks, droplet emission reduced risk decreases. lowest risk outdoors wear masks.

2. Yes. case reports China breathing difficulties possibly scarring seen CT scan patients recovered. long term complications could also present - long term data yet. comment really provide clear information (in opinion), since posting /r/Coronavirus instead /r/CoronavirusColorado, probably keep responses aimed nationally rather focused Colorado...

I seen articles indicate long lasting effects people contract virus, long “beat” initial virus. One article local paper went far say long term health consequences even occur people asymptomatic. reports align seeing? 

If so, benefit someone like mostly isolation (minus necessary shopping) experienced symptoms (other 99% believe allergy symptoms) still get antibody test see disease?

I'm expert get feeling tracing might futile point, community transmission simply rampant. think best mask reduce R0. assume least 5% strangers run store infected act accordingly. NUMBER ONE COUNTRY WORLD People overlook hard train become scientist. didn’t mean literally insta death, people afraid new disease popped up, people Italy Spain hospitalized high rates, lots horror stories ventilators. say know covid now, point time yes people afraid new thing.

Anyway brought people impressed survived. Also link talking another laws guns aren’t strict bud. illegal carry firearms outside house? No, it’s way stricter. also allowed drink many circumstances. It’s mandation mask overly strict it’s terms.  silly, shortsighted comment. know someone who's chaplain hospital said really bad hospital right now. overrun yet, although cases hospital jumped, workers hard time handling everything emotionally.  that’s exactly America back normal time soon don’t sympathy, lmao. I've got 8 PhDs say virus exists. 

Also, real reason government fund nuclear power lizardmen know repurpose waste make weapons mass destruction. Exactly. I’m sure volunteer, people mostly going show up. Nothing stopping govt. providing benefits people fall. stuck sort scarcity mindset gov. problem printing money deems worthy. ease restrictions improving numbers* immediately ease restrictions shown actually work? body sores? new symptom? total asshole Millennials suck 

Love gen z Yep say March people would freaking reminds quote Stalin potentially said although many believe fact say regardless good quote describe situation 

“One death tragedy, million deaths...is statistic”

Basically everyone focusing reopening thinking US past worst Covid fact they’re they’re actually worst it’s ever SERE training? basic training. everyone torture portion either though. Coronavirus cases among Oregon children younger 10 grew fivefold month June, representing fastest growth rate new presumed infections across age range.

State public health officials said increase largely due unidentified transmission within community, although outbreaks day cares also playing small role.

The Oregon Health Authority Tuesday reported [319 confirmed presumed coronavirus children younger 10. number of [May 31 stood children still represent smallest overall share cases Oregon. young children among least likely need hospitalization, eight patients deaths.

But surge concerning state public health officials say that, without correction, could dim prospects children school desks fall.

“I hope increasing cases among children lead people reevaluate behavior take additional precautions,” said Dr. Melissa Sutton, senior health adviser Oregon Health Authority.

Sutton said rate infections Oregon “certainly endangers prospect reopening schools fall” urged residents maintain social distancing, wash hands comply Gov. Kate Brown’s order requiring masks people age 12 older indoor public spaces beginning Wednesday.

“Our actions real consequences,” said, “and might impact reopening schools.”

The somber message comes Wednesday marks 100th day since Brown announced sweeping stay-at-home order sent state’s economy sputtering worked slow spread virus. Brown began easing restrictions May 15 infections subsequently surged, doubling to [8,656 close Tuesday extended state emergency September said [Oregon crossroads, recent modeling warning exponential growth new choice,” Brown said statement. “You help save lives again. happens next us.”

The rapid surge new cases among children newborns age 9 gone relatively unnoticed – part lack transparency state agencies. Neither public health officials day care regulators previously reported outbreaks day cares, declined multiple requests Oregonian/OregonLive week quantify cases, saying information would released Wednesday.

The young age group nearly caught infection totals among Oregonians ages 80 over, group likely die COVID-19.

While vulnerable seniors largely remained isolated outside world, many Oregonians – including children – resumed semblance daily life. enabled virus spread readily among younger people, including parents 20s 30s, Sutton said.

Health officials Tuesday able say many children confirmed presumed infections live households parent sibling also tested positive. Sutton said infections children generally traced another source, noting community transmission “driving force.”

Young kids went almost exposure, following unprecedented shutdown schools March, returning activities include day camps, sports trips playground.

“I don’t think there’s ever time recent history children sheltered,” Sutton said early months pandemic.

Part increase may due testing among children, added. testing alone explain jump.

Coronavirus symptoms among children infections generally include cough, fever, nausea, diarrhea sore throat, Sutton said. Oregon reported one case multisystem inflammatory syndrome children, seemingly rare condition appears strike sometime coronavirus infection.

The mere mention condition cringe-inducing parents. causes inflammation key organs, heart brain, doctors don’t know causes it, according Centers Disease Control Prevention.

It remains unclear precisely many Oregon’s new coronavirus cases among young children traced back day cares.

“I think small proportion linked child care outbreaks,” Sutton said. “The vast majority simply due social mixing.”

The Oregon Health Authority Monday Tuesday would provide figures requested Oregonian/OregonLive total number outbreaks day cares statewide associated infections. would Office Child Care, regulates providers.

Jonathan Modie, spokesman Oregon Health Authority, said agency would begin including information weekly reports released Wednesday.

Officials plan disclose day cares least five infections enrollment least 30 kids. aren’t planning differentiate infections children workers.

Modie Tuesday declined say many distinct outbreaks would reported, although apparently handful.

At least one outbreak reported Lake Grove.

The day care notified parents June 14 someone tested positive, according records obtained Oregonian/OregonLive.

The center told parents June 25 eight children tested positive 69 enrolled, according records. message, KinderCare said 12 teachers also tested positive.

Some parents expected outbreak eventually amid pandemic, despite appeared best efforts among staff. families encouraged seek testing children spent time around infected teacher.

The incident left edge, awaiting results.

“It’s worrying don’t lot data children, especially can’t speak yet can’t articulate they’re feeling,” said one parent, requested anonymity speak outbreak fear retribution child.

KinderCare Tuesday declined identify number cases Lake Grove facility company outbreaks Oregon locations.

“As soon learned positive diagnoses Lake Grove, partnered Clackamas County Health Department closed center 14 days allow professional deep cleaning, retraining protocols re-testing staff reopen,” spokeswoman Emily Snyder said statement. “We’re also taking extra step retraining Oregon center staff ensure we’re delivering highest standards possible.”

State officials long aware fact day cares could become sources coronavirus spread. March, Hillsboro day care worker tested positive, fact Office Child Care confirmed time.

Melanie Mesaros, spokeswoman agency, said email Tuesday misleading compare decision agency’s stance defer state health authority. That’s officials disclosed information March, prior executive order Brown required coronavirus reporting made health authority, said.

Oregon officials slow disclose outbreaks nursing homes, workplaces day care facilities, often deciding release broader information news reports.

State officials would say Tuesday whether reporting outbreaks day cares sooner, stressing working find right balance public disclosure individual privacy.

Modie, health authority spokesman, said officials could use new disclosure plan day cares apply schools fall, outbreaks occur.

Keep commenting, you’re fan. 🥱   bad wasn’t actually filmed there. people assholes. I'm necessarily advocating reaching herd immunity wouldnt bad thing. heard news vaccine while. forgot NJ I'm telling study found. encourage read statement study findings making final judgment. reason could think making people come back big international population it'd impossible regulate wildly different timezones.

I'm professor big university too. timezones, make asynchronous. easily classes require lab physical presence necessary.

They're students need think come college physically lot would defer take semester off. Also college towns require college students. We've several businesses go already without students town would probably reset. think mostly economic. I've read analysis 120,000+ excess deaths. 100% agree 3rd possibly 4th week July. Reason? Levels 2, 3, 4 spread protests. working theory napkin math protests started combined knowing need least levels spread (which takes many weeks) wave quite noticeable hospitalizations. happen, wave continue swell well August beyond, especially Texas still open are.

Even shutting today would stop end July swell... according napkin, anyway.

And day remain open builds current swell would make swell top swell, would call start tidal wave. But... thousands variables truly one predict things like end July.

However, stay open much longer, it’s pretty damn easy figure Texas headed. *sad face.* one state 70 cases per day taking extreme measures stop quickly. rest country well now. hope get AIDS ROLL TIDE coronavirus entire state (sorry Auburn fans) Yeah honestly screwed. Equipment running (glad never restocked nation supply, decade it), cases skyrocketing, hospitalized going up, nobody thing it. even know keep going day day. No, don’t get it; [my real reaction Can't life figure voted pointing Cornell based study.

You don’t look every single death able make *inductive* inference cause surge numbers. 

What you’re saying wouldn’t allow scientific theories developed depended proof every single individual event question.  Thank service honesty. safe &amp; well 🙏 Wait—I thought Rand Paul said evidence children don’t get don’t pass on. 

I’m confused!!!!!!!!!!! sheep means get covid ...

BAAAA he’s GAY won’t happen me! Revs lifted truck rolls coal pedestrians stroking gun slowly. probably anxiety allergies.

On seven seas get protest instead stay home believe people say things choosing ignore Texas 55%? reporting look much suspect gone on. report deals end May. countries 20%, Texas, Florida etc willfully misreporting deaths. 90% may exaggeration, much. American, I'm fucking shamed.  Infected Rate include show symptoms? would know IFR apparently people symptoms? thought easy mode pathetic. ""Who take precautions?"" Nope, someone chose easy mode. Murica #1 never Facebook, imagine quagmire become. know head re-evaluation needed happen, unfortunately friends list family members it... current numbers texas? steroid, blood thinners less ventilation ( high flow O2)) huge advances may reduced death rate 50%. underestimate much protocols changed since NY Italy peaked. Trump: KungFlu

Smh.. Texas hospitals still individually ability convert thousands beds ICUs. It’s ideal, they’re still far overwhelmed right now. fly American 2X week. Yes mid April 50% flights. Monday 100%, guy next 1st class coughed entire flight. hopefully two weeks flights see I’m going die not.... cagare en todo si dejan entrar estos idiotas en España. Somebody intimated esophagus before.. Great!!!! Vanilla Ice, concert world could held phone booth, go get I'm tiger. Cause people like still traveling? ridiculous interpretation said. conversation mom. deadass told “it’s they’re testing”. Yeah. fact 50k people one DAY got still testing 1 10 nationally REALLY concern her. Nope. wants family get together. smart, stay safe! new cases size sold Yankees game. never claimed exclusive offer, friend Peregrin. table I'm putting offer potentially large one. I'm american question genuine nothing whacky politician may say: much increase number cases due increase testing? I've seen charts internet seems like US right tests anybody, Portugal amount tests every million people back april/may, highly struck countries like Italy Spain never many tests. fair there's lot confusion hard tell exactly killed person cases. Saying excess COVID *might* right, I'm certain we've missed some, may never know true numbers are.



As *hiding* numbers reported hidden figures, ones are. Thicc whew, know things rough elsewhere world seemed beyond pale. specific link India: said: deeply worried India partly blame developed world little prevent spread developing nations. said it’s rare asymptomatic people spread virus

No. Different thing, hopefully language, opposite statement true. showing symptoms, spreading virus, likely spreading quarantined. 

I feel like close reaching common ground though!  Yup. Please help. Election interference longer illegal, please damaging stuff Trump campaign. Thank you. Depends job/company. essential workers work blue collar service industries, they’re right. choose watching kid making sure work online going work earn money. 

For single parent households, impossibility. dual parent households, one parents sacrifice. us really trying. immunocomrpomised havent left house except doctors appointment. Always fully masked up. husband takes doesnt let talk people touch doors anything. 

But forced risk job shut isnt allowed work home. one job wear mask despite begging pleading. taking precautions. even take soap hand sanitizer work werent providing any. 

He changest clothes garage work sanitizes car coming inside. protect kids. really try. =( Fifth Amendment protects incriminating yourself, others. people could decide talk court pleased, much use trials. Seriously, Texas government response awful. family I’m terrified they’ll exceed capacity hospital. relatives 70, it’s uncommon family live (and farm!) 90’s. get hold anyone 2 months . Contact state representative. got done couple days. 

How shit argument didnt counter points must ""door engineering"" group Chinese restaurants shops completely repurposed front entrances plexiglass, wood framing, like whole new entrance lol. Love it.

firing getting someone new would lot good appearance sake. Meanwhile local radio trying best .. Poor psychology behind organized religion wonderful tho. money, political power, total behavioral control millions people. Make sure shit's tax free, too! husband talked last night taking son Florida one day. decided crap going USA going stay Canada. Trump made USA place want support. hope people vote enough November. got thousand votes swing states last time. would nice grown again. Well, guess good news that's 20% overall total right now? we're missing 1 5? lol made perfect sense! perspective, Sweden approximately one-third size Texas Americans looking State wide numbers would imagine 210,000 Texas daily increase 3000 cases 120 deaths

Texas also tested per million lower positive percentage outliers talking overall ifr.

But regardless that, 0.03% us died already. That's 3x number cited, nowhere near 100% infected. incidentally spawned largest pandemic ever Failure 45 right, could shoot someone broad daylight sure enough, troll would show up: *""actually bullet killing person path, know why""* Try hemorrhoid wipes/cleaning pads lidocaine cream. Tucks pack it. African country 0 cases asked health minister said. “We tests”.

Thank goodness world leader could ever stupid see desirable state affairs attempt willingly replicate matter policy! Conversely, inaccuracy tests maddening. Someone local two false positives rapid test, negative PCR, second negative PCR. spouse tested inconclusive first time, negative two times including PCR. 

After contact tracing, first recommendation supposed quarantine, people instead waiting hours line get tested next day, without symptoms, hoping negative test go lives. (Or positive call work without penalty.) inaccuracy rapid test replacement quarantine two weeks, absolute best method preventing spread. course start symptoms best get test, without symptoms simply staying home two weeks best everyone. every day life like America now. daily new cases count positive anti body tests? see could use would give number closer accurate number cases. feels disingenuous say ‘cases surging!’ many numbers people likely sick now. would also help explain total deaths still decreasing. someone like Kay Ivey become governor? feel like punching radio every time hear talk. Chinese sci-ops already arrived see what’s death rate? Hospitalization rate? cases thing reported around here? fact present actual arguments links really convincing. See argument agree, feel people became desensitized everything even though dangerous day 1...  Thanks text. is. happens t-cells kill virus instead creating antibodies. stated specifically article killer t-cell response called. memory serves, hospitals shortage PPE beginning. Americans, consumers, love consume large quantities ensure hospitals well stocked needed, believe discouraged use masks. Let’s keep Fahrenheit though. Celsius sucks weather. disgusting. I'm glad got camera, he's well known could arrest straight away. America probably thrown away key someone like years ago. He's sort criminal record long arm never done days work. three months learn new friend yet:

“Restrictions lifted visited people.” (Restrictions lifted ≠ Covid gone)
“Friend corona symptoms.” (Science people)

But 

“Teachable moment people. Please wear mask” 

Sorry loss (yes he’s real person family friends) need martyrdom get message across? Apparently. 

Why three fucking months people slowly starting get this? here, course, people sub seem pretty informed. challenges Patchwork Pandemic  problem beaches open tourists plan trips. they're beach they're bars. bring us germs area spread tourists bring home areas. locals flocking beach. they're done beach head bars. spread germs.

It's beach itself, everything comes along holiday open beach. Look happened Myrtle Beach. Better putting right next anus! grateful child poodemic. child generation K-12 right screwed. feel bad them. child born 2010s good life. tens thousands *are part* tens millions. Let's honest, gone crowded protest wear mask properly since overcome barrier. Texas lieutenant governor. soup kitchens closed? than, likely. testing January, recall reading COVID-19 already then. kids gonna grow fast lol careful  Don’t get political. Mods cry Well I’m good deviated septum apparently supposed breathing nose Wow, summer break gets shorter shorter TN... used 2nd week August 80s 90s.  number positive cases certainly increasing, tends happen reopening. 

If anything I’m great full testing finally catching folks Texas seeing behavior change ground? people masking up? Ding ding ding ding! Glad room, maybe keeping door shut help. thank you, keep safe too. :) anyone ever bring Holocaust? Like ""oh people deserved it, huh?"" thanks internet stranger People never seem understand long lag effects be. month ago Georgia’s reopening isn’t causing cases increase lately it’s deaths aren’t increasing. Well Arizona, one first states get significant resurgence, reported record 88 deaths today reason think states won’t follow (although I’m sure we’ll surpass 2000 per day rate improving treatment understanding importance protecting nursing homes).

In hindsight makes sense took time cases spike Georgia first strategy ridiculed media weeks people probably took fact nothing happened yet sign could safely socialize. People telling “come back 2 weeks, 4 weeks” 6 weeks ago Welcome Texas :)

Everything better here, especially stupidity! guys starting this? poor ass country implemented since April. Chinese man.
The Chinese know best whether Chinese army not.
I know believe me. believe me, forget it.
You believe anything say anyway, reply? kinda shit perfectly illustrates ""Thank God Mississippi"" expression. Stupid independent. go leader. America accepting humanitarian aid third world countries point 2020 Sucking glue people really don’t understand vast Southern California yet easily accessible (traffic willing) well. People traverse county lines circumvent rules. Smart people already weren’t going restaurants, either going end people swarming San Diego OC counties unless shut too. 4th July isn’t bar/restaurant holiday. need cul-de-sac pack hot dogs you’re celebrating fourth. People think isn’t “gathering” it’s family apparently. disaster waiting happen. mask mandate place California people wouldn’t follow it. tried route. didn’t work. Nobody wants close businesses. people can’t responsible result. Round two. Fight! Yeah wear work day want take break outdoors let ears skin 15 minutes feel like asshole I’m going close anyone anything... 125k dead milestone enough ya? Verginia feels like experiment. Maybe stop testing fine. driver takes pic obviously driver throw mask pic take off. varies state. Florida's positivity rate today 28%, that's concerning. natural yeast bread definitely beats sharp stick eye sure, recommend starting point learning bake really good bread. Sorry contrarian reply got frustrated watching 90% people know try making sourdough complain making bread worth effort- bread's fault! Anything attention Tennessee levels soon enough. family still lives Northeast I'm one FL. getting kinda smug mid May hardly got hit getting better. Everything opening back mom sure hairdresser would open again.

The thing think Northeast going prime time outdoors. FL AC season hot shit outside.

Totally topic saying I'm place tonight lol. get bloodwork done Quest today. allowed 10 people waiting room spread ended wait outside like 20 mins. forehead thermometer's scared skin heated sun. Heat index 100 think. Yo wtf, good news allowed man take shit elsewhere certainly lets us know much lives valued government. enjoy it, wont last long. I'm sorry loss agree 1000x. similar conversations point added every post screaming young people sub good reason. relevant lot conversation around societal covid behavior/perception. would nice could conversation in-depth way, super hard without flagged political bs Automod. I'm fully aware better area. Living place less likely get shot living lavishly. really know expect everyone do. everyone sell house, work McDonald's move shitty neighborhood? Instead government making unemployment livable duration global pandemic? Jesus. heard - awful. It’s going skyrocket. Come back two weeks.  Yah, it’s already late. NY completely shut nowhere close ICU capacity, watched hospitalizations rise another two weeks. TX already capacity, still going half measures meaningless platitudes. thing left face consequences. 4.4% daily jump referring total case count. Top comment story drivers deactivated refusing drive rider refuses wear mask. uber hate drivers much? Rock-bottom gives out, like, ""Huh, know another level there."" Yeah.. think two ways look this. New York misses many cases early limited testing used symptomatic people.

Some places included serosurvey conducted CDC immunity levels 25x higher reported number positives.. even adjusting false antibody positives Ay caramba! many tests positive rate tests compare peak earlier year?

I think deaths might accurate measure use. would best closer 65k. read tweets aboutmasks rubbing tan? videos 1st week lockdown so.
Not many people wandering anyway, end-of-days videos testimony started coming hospitals, people got better better infringing rules. 

It strict lockdown. 
Cops pulling everyone dared go out, supermarkets would let mask gloves, limited numbers too. going food/essential work/medical assistance, could go 200 meters residence. 2 months this. Evebody know mental breakdown point. virus can't survive much longer 7 days mask, next time use consider putting paper bag de-contaminate quickly, Tupperware trap moisture extend virus lifespan somewhat. microb escape paper bag. N95 mask go bad, might lost static charge make bit protective, matter. even many. Rural PA checking in, ain’t wrong! Dont worry feels right thing. Maybe good behavior rub others! safe trip. Im part time Uber driver drove since March. wanna drive cause go pick someone mask drive drove 2-15 minutes nothing, ride cancellation rate go looks bad. feel bad full time drivers taking Coronavirus seriously wanna give rides people wear mask.  Yeah that’s seems pretty ridiculous upon reflection mean $27 trillion debt extremely reduced tax receipts right now? literally bankrupt USA. happen eventually anyways, mean, maybe worth now, would descend world chaos inopportune time chaos. There's better times USA go bankrupt federal reserve print us hyperinflation. Extremely rare far. Similar lung damage flu pneumonia. 

It’s hysteria anything. good luck getting anything shut without force National Guard behind it. get bad italy states, them. Florida, older folks (50+) far reckless younger adults. anecdotal, younger people working grocery stores, Walmarts, Targets, concerned health. older retired people turning political issue. Anyone familiar Doug Wilson (protector pedophiles) church surprised. 

http://moscowid.net/ going enforce de-fund police time?

Liberal questions guess. claiming unemployment, thinking entitled 4k month. really short term, well, that's savings for. Ohio, America's shit hole country people getting lung scarring suffered severe symptoms. Definitely people, maybe 1-5% infected. Atlanta work recently taken aback people wore mask indoors. Trump begging Chinese buy American farm products like past four years. Drive really money them. much they’d save overheard front end all. Drive kitchen. see becoming reality soon enough Yup. interesting thing reason they’re testing Brazil SA UK’s containment measures working well enough couldn’t guarantee they’d able collect enough data. Personally, think it’s connection mask wearing saving money that’s going finally get people behind mandatory masks. sure isn’t science! ah, bad. facetious. I’m well aware exponential grow it’s ability slap face. long believe hoax, can't hurt you.... long everyone else wears mask practices social distancing. professor, I’m trying plan contingencies. 9 hour drive go Brooklyn Rochester? right selfish mindset made problem much worse full display. understand saying. 

Deaths minus COVID deaths way U.S. coronavirus death toll ‘a substantial undercount’ actual tally, Yale study number excess deaths causes 28% higher official tally U.S. Covid-19 deaths months. happens non-essential business. hate say it, lot jobs fall category. service industry convenience, survival. hitched horse wrong wagon, sorry. kidding right?? amount teargas pepper spray surprised many people wear masks protests.. saying perfect there's hell lot karens starbucks. Well even death rate would even less good thing. numbers pulled general searches. meaningless record lmao.

It's meaningless all. exactly is. cases almost certainly lower peak earlier year factor number tests matter people.

There way evaluate that. wildly guessing. seeing people wearing masks U.P.? got back visiting family Luce county was.....terrible mask compliance say least. Perhaps lot towners dumb, see anywhere near 95% compliance weekend pretty worried them. got tired somewhere around March \o/ I'm California, care, also get yelled wearing damn mask..

I yell ya wear one, please extend amount courtesy mention companies exactly jump chance hiring whistleblower. might hard time finding work. already trying claim Swine Flu going pandemic again. Except Newsoms number today directly contradicts 

County numbers yesterday go 

And main page hasn’t updated reflect number. 

A lot sites track CAs cases adding county totals, yet isn’t single report CA hitting 9000 cases think so. everyone reddit make six figures today?

Lmao either teens edgy adults never grew done so? We'll know three weeks. truth younger patients stay shorter lower fatality rate wishful thinking? even know economic impacts straining diplomatic ties China? They’ll say anything try save him. keep setting new records!

Are tired winning yet? plan eventually work again? I'm going pay taxes again, dont plan sit ass rest life. never thought I'd defend claiming unemployment laid off. I'm gonna get anymore cause quite frankly give fuck think. agree last paragraph all. think spreading early Feb nobody would knowledge it. peaking China January people knowledge called crazy. I'm pretty sure mid Feb.. we'll never know testing. keep proving statement. know state biggest surge California right? Ba da ba da da I'm Coughing “Indoors problem. more, science showing it,"" added.”

Please tell pearl-clutching anti-beachers. divisive main rivals. bro they're giving away trail monkeys??? HOOK FUCK RIGHT protests. It’s reopenings lack masks It’s flu bro! /s Check daily threads 2-3 weeks ago, literally one top comments one day remember reading along lines ""im starting think overblown start getting back life, upvoting fearmongering articles statistics weeks ago made fools"". 

I specifically remember time USA crossed 100k deaths....yeah really overblown heartless prick. 

Not comment similar one replied chains: think see lot criticism lockdown approach hindsight
It overreaction


Shameless considering knew see now. Every country locked saved thousands lives america lost tens thousands point hampering little country whole even needed. reminds fungus causes ants climb trees kills release spores.

Nature truly messed stuff it.

 one? Awkward... Also, places want make US look bad make propaganda! Remind 4 weeks Yeah, can't get hook easily. many people died Remind me! 1 month wait till there's room hospitals guess. Banira Aisu Careful now, insult el Peje anywhere outside r/Mexico, get downvoted oblivion Reopen everything blame young going outside. strangely sensationalized headline actually information actual state things. sure, technically correct, there's comments like ""holy cow 50%?"" like actual infection rate.

i'm saying mexico real bad, curious first bullet point (""mexico testing sickest people..."") used informative less misleading. cohesive nationwide action plan literally nothing constitution. Literally reason central government coordinate things like emergency response. sane society would considered assault battery terrorism something. I’ve reading... there’s surviving COVID diabetes EXTRA careful. can’t find actual numbers tho Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It’s like reopening early never closing simultaneously vilifying people wearing masks bad idea something.  people caring whole problem Texas reclosing isn’t it? Right! call either “developed” “developing” nations. Frankly, think comment ignorant (and hateful) one. 

The original poster's comment show dislike prejudice Mexicans (""dislike prejudice"" definition xenophobia). I'm certainly scientist feel like gotta quite ways (if ever). Also I'm concerned long term effects vaccine presented. Im anti-vaxxer btw, trying use common sense. Holy fuck yall really need dial back shit. here's study Diamond Princess. agree everyone wear masks, wonder uber drivers could cancel rides stating arent wearing masks, even though cancelling different reason? 9 times 10 rider thats asshole types situations, makes wonder rules abused Harvesting organs real.

What real, killing millions Iraq. China never done anything remotely near heinous. Also according Chinese sources, epidemiological data may suggest US traveler also caused initial outbreak Wuhan, could source subsequent cases throughout China... little, late- others already created large mass people take as, ""I continue listen him/his example"" instead go, ""I can't believe Deep State got him, too!"" matter 19 times many people standing within 6 feet you, without even cubicle wall between. Add shouting, fact *less 100%* wearing masks (they rules unlike many businesses *require* masks), hard see much worse be.  NEVER happen, unfortunately. north genius Putin’s friend also says hydro..something works too. trialed haha go Canada dude, seriously LOL

Wow, saw wandering earth. watched wife find cheesy did. even notice super pro china stance (She's Korean). said cuz american movies always make USA hero, china lol. Yeah, model minority myth works they're model minority already top 10% whatever country they're from. go actual country sometimes utter chaos lol.

Dude, point #2 hits straight home. Lol third world hell hole... shit never ever black white. 

Also yup, summed history wuhan's dealing virus earlier year pretty damn well. Chinese government hive mind like borg star trek something. they're different levels people act course do. course local guy charge wanna stir trouble biggest holiday year. damn do, damned moment. yes blundered hell, i'd probably chose keep quiet well. 

Australia sounds like damn fine job. Korea also soft border closure. Covid hit areas locked even visited, family quarantined checked. 2 week quarantine everyone. 

Cheers bro, really appreciate effort talk. hope shit returns normal next year fucking pandemic over. seen friends family almost two years. Wonder there’s way put trump wall little north Mason-Dixon line like massive amounts idiots gathered crowded bars restaurants. went beaches bars restaurants within walking distance well. PhD checking here, confirm true. Last week county Florida 4 days 19% positive. One day 33.9%. Yea.... hear ya. I'm currently Somerset county, rural southwestern PA. around 60 cases county-wide. go town maybe 20\~30% wearing masks going Walmart, etc. others weren't. Pittsburgh yesterday people taking lot seriously; probably 90% wearing masks. always wear mask couple cases met someone one one know small town types little backwards thinking masks seen political statement want give weird impression make uncomfortable. annoying taking seriously guess lower case count big concern.  Ran tests today Dallas. 28 year old white male Caucasian American Taiwanese wife no. knew America would never able handle pandemic. Nobody cares what's good whole. here. People cannot inconvenienced even slightly end world can't go bar couple months. So, makes source valid how? troll. millions children dying malnutrition USA then. Putting deaths aside, would like know costs involved getting covid 19 spend time hospital, work, course, working first place. know interpret data past 3rd grade level see bad economy country, wealth friends Trump Im positive saw shirt said "" live canada, billgateistan "" something other.  


made chuckle XD havent low faith humanity long long time. ....Idaho borders Canada. Moscow even south Idaho. worry y'all dealing parents get annoyed teachers made breath co2!! I'm sorry teachers deal bs thank everything. 


Unrelated though, graduated HS 6 years ago still hold disdain security theater ids wear. Oh no! happens? animals die too? Yeah true  Heading 100,000 ..... way go USA. think quite hyperbolic. McDonald's locations near generally mix cushioned seating, booths, perhaps wood chairs. Even plastic, what's wrong plastic chair? Well designed plastic chairs totally fine.

But answer question, point eating inside would convenience restrooms, perhaps use WiFi, much easier deal sauces things like table, refills, etc.

Not saying McDonald's incredible dining experience, weird (in normal times) want sit little bit eat meal. NYC they’re asking everyone get tested. matter what. mi opinion, that, contact tracing, main reasons infections continue slowly decline. honestly concerning metric imaginable. Recognizing science medical research would start, doesn’t fit right’s narrative, that’s out. CA’s per capita testing improving abysmal months. Still needs improve should’ve better allowing reopenings. Otherwise, don’t apparatus get necessary data makes difficult verify numbers counties tracking don’t know trustworthy source. Hopefully suffer consequences. RemindMe! 5 days agree treatment absolutely improved since march, hopefully results decreased death rate, scientific basis believe could go appx 0.5-1% IFR .01%, that's complete fantasy bordering propaganda. Holy shit, take fucking responsibility once. Americans acting stupid stupid, period. Blaming stupidity outside actors shows us truly stupid even ones think they're clever are. force tube throat. Opposed mask tube Okay, apparently I’m idiot. Never heard oxygen referred “breathing tube.” Thank though. worked whole thing companies like Home Depot giving $100 week bonuses got shitty $600 minus taxes bonus nearly 4 months. couple? 418 comments calling fake, fear mongering ""stay inside scared"" mine Useless offensively indifferent. Ok, don’t vanilla ice 2020 may true select establishments rent overhead unused dining space killing margins restaurants. Roadside food carts hand cleaning right now. work electronic store Atlanta area. coworkers wear masks recently would take soon customers left building end day. working store open public. started wearing official hours corporate called location.

Many customers them... many don’t. don’t want speculate percentages given time several customers small building wearing mask. 

We signs saying required company doesn’t anything enforce rule. girlfriend special education teacher--our state even bothering asking students wear masks, teachers instead given gowns PPE. feeds changes kids... way around social distancing issue home You’re idiot. can’t name lie point assumption question.I’m sure you’ll reply copy pasted answer, it’s sign know lost argument. 😂 Yes, stated. different = bad / wrong

These humans you’re talking about!

You get upvote btw. case pandemic. pandemic changed lives billions course 4-6 months. People lost love ones, jobs, careers, houses, pets, health, businesses, lives ect. looks like things slowing down. completely pointless make “suggestion”, regardless caliber. must make mandatory enforce truly want people make mask. sounds like they’re letting people thing, means won’t wear mask, turn creating higher risk virus spreading.  literate population USA running streets saying virus exist good example given here. failed leadership hospital administration. seems like common theme throughout America. We've forgotten lead (or choose right leaders). sad know org/unit would function better without existing leadership (i.e. net negative drain system). Ohhhh, see what’s going here. Change topic bash Americans score bonus reddit points? I’m gonna guess familiarity America doesn’t extend beyond hear media, it? Suprising people look raw, unbiased data still interpret wrongly think cases aren’t bad. don’t even need Fox CNN propaganda point remember good ol days Andromeda Strain. harvesting organs political prisoners....yet. worse. still concentration camps, still really bad. crazy mayor Las Vegas saying right now? one literally wanted Las Vegas ""control group"". 20 false negatives ended 51,000s end day. See clear plastic tube nose, thats breathing tube. loops ears top lip two prongs go nose (not far). tube attached oxygen tank typically take breath nose you’re getting high concentrate oxygen. 

A ventilator much larger tube goes throat, it’s attached machine basically breaths you, pushing oxygen lungs. Little bit column A, little bit column B.

GPS smartphones enabling legalized robbery exactly entice use taxis.

Also, pffff, haha, taxi ""workload"". Dudes sitting lineup mall answering dispatch, driving via gps location. 

Maybe taxis little different 30 years ago, newspapers. Things change. !RemindMe 2.5 weeks - issues real life. Worrying folk making unemployment teh middle pandemic strawman. family Mexico, sister told family taking prevent virus. (They’re also staying home wearing masks, etc. taking med). They're forced whatever superintendent tells do. much want bet one wearing mask room? happening country, school officials meeting person discuss plans school year sentiment ""we trust everyone safe, okay"" Good. means lefties oppose masks. honestly don’t understand logic this? could anyway help health someone wearing anything body would course choose even think it’s something house like restaurants clothing rules - don’t see people protest fancy restaurants right eat without shoes on, peoples lives... like lives vulnerable community. don’t understand. don’t understand! Never shit load Americans give 2 fucks anyone else best tests. tests. Everyone telling great tests are. less testing. go away end July. think bad, wait learn climate change. sounds like listening doctor, due respect, he/she better source health information you. Dying drink  don’t want go around infecting killing people. anybody conscience? wear mask prevent that.” 

Sobering story. good remember 125,000 deaths represent loved ones, family. diagnosis death 3 days, horrifying. seems disprove claim rise cases due protests think theyre saying could possibly serve defense they’re sneezing lot anyway hate even imagine this, conservative talking point upcoming election: “Mexicans bringing Corona Virus, need border wall ever.”

Yet, they’ll gloss China originally brought them. Lived FL 7 years. People beach spend time bouncing back forth actual beach dozens bars/restaurants lining shore. Damn, I’m skinny, young guy good health, throwing kettlebells running 5 miles day. avoid people like... plague. size age, would take even seriously. still laughing hard? Yeah, seen many people (Including mr. Orange) speaking total numbers, cases / 100.000 people - easy get blinded numbers...

Everytime hear mr. Orange talk ""USA front testing"" - think many people needed make simple Google search, find website shows cases world, sort ""tests per million"", see USA front testing... (Though bad been:) Little Irish maid? Mary Mallon, chance? campus? Safe bet. 200,000 October locked thing gone exponential. 

Exponential bad. bad. Reddit Fella think need take breathe chill stroke. guy wants travel, can. Especially followed precautions. 

I’ve trucking whole thing haven’t problem following precautions. seem really angry hateful given post history.

I would also looking advice face rather hair. Yeah, recent reopening tick cases. scale back reopening little bit, I’m sure cases either stabilize go back down. it’s still near before.  exceptionally reliable data sources provide good proxy might happening there.

Australia far visited country New Zealanders. India getting 20,000 trips per year USA closer 200,000.

If assume number people returning New Zealand similar ratio annual visits (which seems likely) 70% Aus, 10% Asia, 10% Europe, 9% North America, ~1% India.


Now, look inbound infected June since killed community transmission Well, still time Dude, nurses doctors area (Texas) part problem. Wearing masks nose, even chin! people work around crap know better? Yeah somethig said good customer service going way help customerrs simply give everything want. murder would hard prove, charged reckless endangerment public. lucky reply got downvoted massively Seems like it. 300 excess deaths per day expanded lockdown nationwide. That's probably accurate metric use comparison new cases due different methodologies, availability tests etc. According u/jdorje Texas currently 500 excess deaths per day. Good luck. Hey maybe inject disinfectant bodies. looked NYC, thought could happen NYC population density ‘lib policies.’

Now learn... Sigh... need take drastic action. drink home. Hospitalizations haven’t reported Florida. like multiple volley ball nets arranged randomly many straight lines thru nets. Man y’all ever seen hygiene kids 10? It’s non-existent. I’ve watched 10 year old dig dirt, hands covered black soil. Next minute he’s shoving food mouth dirty hands. They’re breeding ground. teacher I’ve seen shit. Daycare age worst!! Hand pants directly mouth/ face. touch surfaces!!!!! Look like comments county’s FB page (York, PA). Fucking idiots! still kills considerably fewer young people common flus do. Around (North Dallas) directly correlated news. stopped talking it, everybody stopped wearing masks.

 back news, people suddenly wearing again.  reason transferred rural city hospitals rural ones ill equipped handle severe covid cases.

So probably mark hospitals severe cases. Might able take less severe ones. Well that's hot take wearing masks know it. doubt lot nursing home patients hanging Houston beaches bars. probably stopped. agree that.  think ignoring children need socialization. They're trying controlled fashion keeping learning schedule. Classes getting cleaned mourning night, teachers limited groups 1 deep (as far NM going).


The real question goes back opening general. What's risk/reward opening *this* week versus *that* week? better hold 2021? far cancel school materially affects generation?



Two entire generations kids graduate year late?   used play loud music drink beers shower. agree that's lot fun! I'm taking break beer right Covid thing drinking little much. drink Cayenne Kombucha shower that's pretty good too! use money buy respirators, anyone involved doesn’t deserve resources another sick patient watch... top this. (/s sadly... really) sort political background?

Same thing though lol. would vote Rock heartbeat. Can't worse reality star. Might even step up. referring fatalities (per million, matter much population sizes similar), seven-day rolling average. *What forgot previous calculation Sweden's fatalities course similar lag behind infections.* Sorry confusion, quite silly forget that.

I looking March 12, seven-day rolling average fatalities per million Belgium 0.06, Sweden 0.01. March 15th, 0.23 v.s 0.1. yes, true countries first fatality March 10th-11th, also true days later one *23* times higher rolling average.

Belgium gave light social distancing recommendations March 10th. started locking March 17th, day Sweden gave social distancing recommendations. day Belgium 0.51, Sweden 0.10. 

Three weeks later, April 7th, fatalities infections occurred around March 17th. Belgium's curve beyond point inflection, 21.84. Sweden still exponential phase, 4.68. cases see numbers multiplied 40 within three weeks, indicating doubling time less four days. 

*It interesting see countries seem similar doubling time infections lock / social distancing! may meant article, makes effect anti-epidemic measurements comparable course*

So judged solely number reported fatalities (based seven day rolling average, course introduces additional lag) looks like:
- lock-down / social distancing, countries similar doubling time infections.
- locked / started social distancing, Belgium may actually five times infections.
- respect doubling time, one could say Belgium two weeks exponential curve point time.
- spite going lock-down ""later"", five times worse odds, Belgium peaked twice high Sweden.
- ended lock-down fatalities half Sweden.
- now, six weeks lock-down, Belgium's fatalities tenth Sweden's 

Well may many mistakes train thoughts. looking merely reported fatalities give complete picture, considering time first confirmed death confirmed cases may misleading.  Yeah he's consistently hated right here. family like I've saying since day 1 quarentine great job he's proactive fighting virus comparison governors. There's reason PA one 3 states CDC recently said improving. Also, viral particles coated sticky layer fat, even touch fiber mask stick. Born NJ, live NYC. predictable. Trumpster family members Kentucky LAUGHING us making jokes going worst it. I’ve work lockdown since beginning March, still think I’m crazy so. It’s absolute insanity. country built this. There’s many selfish people, many places teach selfishness else. GOP's plan fix social security healthcare. kill ton people hope problem goes away. /s Perhaps main difference Canadians take social acceptance attitude (hey, I’m wearing mask protect appreciate same, cheers!) whereas US politicized (but rights! hoax [insert name here], etc).

There exceptions sides sure. know. shut society every 90 year old Earth dead 20 years! mortality rate flu: 0.1%

[mortality rate covid-19: Thank you! Wait. like 40,000 yesterday? WTF? I’ve waking one, too. think it’s allergies me. Maybe well. buy 3 meals worth food, week, $100 tax. two people. bought mcdonalds 3 time day, week, 2 people, even dollar menu meal- would $125, including tax. Yeah, Houston isn’t looking good, it’s still got thousands beds cam convert, outside hospitals transfer patients to. state fairly well right now, rural counties got CoVid patients transferred city. also transferred non-CoVid patients city smaller hospitals. There’s still plenty protocols taken hospital system gets overwhelmed. CDC says 30,000 flu deaths per year. 

Compare 60,000 covid deaths far. 

Also consider numbers skewed bad reporting methods. Apparently people died gunshot wounds - also covid - counted deaths - believe - read official yet ppl stop going beaches one hit. Hopefully causes greater belief respect science data politics religion. behaviour suspicion areas globe much better pagan, neolithic ancestors. know pools lakes area closed. Plus weather supposed bad area weekend sure outdoor stuff still books..... USA NUMBAH ONE meanwhile stocks going completely irrational. Mayors south went clueless Corona experts month. Covid Express schools never going re-open point. Oh boy.... sounds like people using whole ESA thing get around pet rules. ""This simply ESA parrott tell need it"" difficulty can't expose people covid actual study might kill them. Something ethics bad. Yo. Thoughts Florida epicenter yet? really mess chrons disease? That's adult pay shitty government failed responding properly thus resort drastic measures get control again.

You cannot ""aggressively track"" numbers without massive infringement privacy.

And country got control without sort surveillance necessary seem quite dystopian, granted that's USA already moment. weird. Finland received 200.000 masks (for chirurgiens, high quality, sure) Taiwan, hospital Northern Finland. think May, donation, purchase. state Finland not, cannot receive donations, non-profit institution can. 
The whole thing maneuvered pro-Taiwan Finnish parliament member.
So “Finland” rated anything far know, couldn’t find news Finnish news sites. trust China accurate reporting....interesting. lost every ounce credibility noise. That’s lotta paid actors! Mask rate Florida: 1%  really. death rate isn’t going up. helpful steps take someone COVID respiratory illness? Water, etc? zing/vitamin C/anything else proven? Thanks Ask Agolf Twitler [Did know margarine causes Note, however, call security theater effects bottom line. Big brain trump, can't second wave first one never stops!

I talking countries, we, rest world know US already fucked. Unicorn term? suppose 21st century is. spike happening ... dumbo trumpytard remember hitting 15 thinking pass. Oh wait...that POTUS. ""living sin"" years no, impact choice married. Also religious wedding. cool, go off.

I want legal protections married spouse, want insurance, able see make decisions get sick.  If/when children want rights protected well.  yes, want small ceremony symbolizes commitment other, chosen build life together. Humans across cultures history celebrated life milestones, natural normal human impulse.  

I'm glad happy choice, good moral choice.  Damn guess mass protesting pandemic isn’t good idea  Texas example insane amount excess deaths. clear States like Florida Texas lying ass cover things show things fact great. swear read yesterday. really hoping president ends wearing mask. Yes done months ago better late never Would even second wave first one never ends? valid firearm license forbidden wearing mask public carrying weapon.

So choose wear mask carry firearm.

By passing law requires people something prohibits carrying firearm, violating Second Amendment. Home Depot day minding business w/my mask on, keeping distance, picking soil embracing new quarantined life, working projects home, mindful activities health safety family, neighbors, friends.

“I home Depot” would sufficed here


Needless say rushed car Lysol’ed myself. kids home high-risk mom.

Do live mom? People won’t wear masks put like diseased animals.  Navy, right? happen try open schools they'll close Oh, I'm sorry lol. Forgive ignorance, I'm much politics guy, heard people saying re-elected, something around lines would scream mask induced hypoxia!   
    maskless breath freely!* - J.C. Listen little shit “bar lives matter” even mean? Surprised get comments Post . notified earlier removed CNN news outlet something. Weird. Right. Education joke. Real education India. got slapped really hard teacher ask drank water. Right Ron Swanson approach burying gold various places seems attractive investment want movies now! 50,298 now.

/Simpsonsmeme.jpg Trump really likes beat China everything eh ? Catan this, global warming worry even children never get ahead now. Beautiful numbers. Yeah remember: people likely kind would get lawyers challenge stuff likely wealthy enough inflict pain back New York.

New York might picking battle want pick here. Arizona know many people drove Mexico stockpiled Trump’s crazy comments couple months ago.

The hydroxy/zpac craze strange enough, guess they’re hcq they’re giving zpac itself? 

I clinician girlfriend asking take stuff brother gave her. puts really bad position disagree brother, practices Mexico, know Mexican women families. Even though know it’s wrong, couldn’t say anything tell needs get advice physician knows case history. 

Then again, lot doctors small town huge Trump fans getting really crazy prescribing whatever Trump says. whole world gone mad. promise deliver, plague edition course number hospitalizations overwhelm capacity... might problem. 

And actually, Texas least running tests, helped cut federal funding. idiots arguing wearing mask 50. Disposable surgical mask, face shield, hand sanitizer long sleeves better enough. Basic mask (from n95 cloth) sanitizer. Social distancing also needed least 2 meter more.

Mask useful minimize spits particles talking, sneezing coughing. Social distancing implemented minimize contagious virus person. Hand sanitizer handling public private properties (door handles, safety bars, cash, items etc) handle several people. 

These fundamentals avoiding virus. Sometimes, hard follow circumstances. case, always take precautions beware surroundings. Hospital Angeles. using antiretrovirals public option. mean treatment options way better today past direct comparison lethality kidna senseless. CFS crowd ignored mocked forever might actually vindicated. POTS crew boat.

Hopefully we’ll see lot research post-viral illnesses long term immune consequences. Hispanics didn’t name Hispanics, that’s made word made put us one group Go look cases reported pneumonia deaths. waaaayyy average. Starts comment downplaying virus ends ridiculous guess. America you’ll happy know you’ll never reach 50k deaths per day. number ridiculously high. Exactly, unlike redditors understand it!

On unrelated note, share us think herd immunity reached? mean doesn’t Navajo Nation kinda opérate it’s country? definitely know can’t count fed help Covidiotas Anyone else want get ride?! feel like I'm stuck back gargantuan, rabid animal despite ring alarm pulling seatbelt, I'm stuck sh*t lots others also requesting stop.
 
And instead grinding halt, beast barrels increased pace(wtf?!)
 
What makes worse beyond shoulders behemoth, culprits pick tear animal, visible clear day, instigating thing. see us yelling screaming like animal, dgaf even point f*cking valley ahead. 
 
 completely f*cked witnessed entire sh*tshow beginning knowing end well... part prevent exacerbating things get word stop calamity....but still perish; watching instigators end. hard take question “honest” it’s obviously loaded you’ve come foregone conclusions.

Thats fair criticism. shouldn’t loaded question like certainly honestly curious, that’s poor communication effort part. 0.26% death rate means two people die one thousand people infected. university easily 30,000 50,000 students counting staff members, higher risk. stories ten people getting infected party. Classroom,dining hall dorm perfect settings virus transmission. one tenth student body infected, six students die. faculties workers die well. think six students die rest fellow students wouldn’t miss college experience don’t know say. Also please don’t bring asymptotic carriers, flu death rate calculated despite asymptotic carriers well COVID 20 times deadlier flu death rate calculated fashion, that’s young folks, older people prolly 500 times. Anyway emphasis PEOPLE DIE shitty classes fun Fauci predicted 200k end july point, longer read articles five-letter word headline picture of... it.

I’m comments. Lol - agreed. made scenario, would probably somewhat spotty. Like one grocery store many employees got sick successfully operate shut week, text town grocery store workers mostly fine stayed open, town next truck drivers got sick grocery store get enough deliveries stayed open. Ignore lol. I'm liberal bc views lean right subject. pack unreasonable ppl probably group message. comments go 7 likes -2 one sees comment bc I'm vocal. getting downvoted probably something right. posted article absolutely absurd headline ""We're worse March"" 6.1k likes. Mind blown. looking comment. Japan counted South/SE Asia? No. encourage get lawyer challenge contact tracing calls court law.

Remember: type people ""I rights... NYAH!"" going roll play dead. Nope. read numbers see shitshow occurring. hard wear mask anyways? Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong lowered cases mandated masks mimir Poster child narcissism Home Vandals. University Idaho Vandals. Quite remarkable name continues day. Stop it, know pleasure ?   that's US. nearly outrageous time asked spicy mustard burger relatives, guarantee it. can't keep shitty relatives spreading fake news manufactured outrage amongst other. It’s seriously embarrassing watch numbers American healthcare worker. fact many people refuse mask absurd. actually used RemindMeBot one posts month ago someone saying reopening going anything bad. soon reminder came up, went back see say. Here's went.

Paraphrasing here.

OP comment 1 month ago: Lockdowns stupid. Evidence shows good. Social distancing along take care this. can't destroy economy something work anyway.

My comment 1 month later 40,000 cases day: Yeah, aged like shit.

Them: Nuh uh! testing! Exactly!

The obvious nonsense ""safety"". China far safer America, that's sure! silver lining Ebola die gruesome death blood coming every pore. However, really cares difference end fucking dying anyways. disposable surgical cloth? US saw India Brazil we're slowly catching up, decided step pedal preventative, probably harmful, stationary ICU might prevent secondary infections, serious threat immunocompromised patient. 
Taking antibiotics preventative measure generally bad idea. fast mix together Uh yeah too? Businesses absolutely choose turn away wearing mask. seen happen several occasions. 

Majority people live wearing masks anyways course fit narrative every single person America hillbilly redneck MAGA hat wearing racist so. think pretty close right. That's big number homie. helps know convinced quarantine. Otherwise, easy socialize early thinking ""well probably actually it...."".

Also, useful know immune afterwards catch it. means help collect bodies Bring Yer Dead wagon! (it's Monty Python reference). No: seems like Fate deciding ruddy b\*\*ch family.

Nothing nothing less here.

Also, post source CoVid: rehab center father recover coronary artery bypass get back normal Johns Hopkins Hospital nearly killed twice letting tacrolimus level go lethal levels.

It random 'Joe Schmoe' streets gave parents. damned rehab center. kind interesting one person embody many literal worst human characteristics exist. sorta like reverse MENSA meeting. Remember guys, hundred fifty thousand deaths richest country world big deal. Definitely bad. Shanty towns India 200 day everything still fine. mandate wearing mask without state emergency ? country (Poland) gov want enter state emergency cause political reasons ongoing elections, without tools enforce it. talking morality, that’s obvious, interested available tools US. get virus low enough, like China did, come lockdown. everyone said fear mongering experts predicted March.

What predicted millions deaths end March. Many transpired. US still way behind west european countries deaths per million population. cases positive news means virus spreading lower mortality rate. level stupidity blatant trolling 14 year olds sub reason people leaving reddit. saw piece, think WA like said. number people think infections per million population important number. Lol fact matter Toronto doesn’t facilitiy compete ESPN Wide World Sports, there’s really nothing like it. multiple basketball arenas practice courts one area, also 3 resort hotels dedicated housing players, it’s private property meaning take pretty much whatever measures want ensure works. Despite situation Florida, think Disney best place make work mean, asthma underdeveloped lung (effect scoliosis), run breath pretty easily lung strength good (as seen spirometer, volume air inspired low). wear masks complain it. anything, country doctors suggesting people respiratory diseases wear masks absolutely necessary go messaging 7 days [**2020-07-09 06:13:11 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-07-09%2006:13:11%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

It’s easy could save many lives worked together absolutely agree 7 day average that, estimations 250k new infections per day March.

No basis claiming comment goes rails. data confirming numbers anywhere NEAR 250k infections per day. keep fantasizing. Injures self stubborn tree running ambulance !remindme 7 days see constitution all, huh? Thanks wasting time.  start testing people sick bring rate back /s Fuck. I’m 30. I’m getting winded stairs right covid. ultramarathon 6 months I’m worried won’t able prepare for. Tim Apple shambles moment? Feels like forever... We're turning tricks here. Without mass testing anti vaccine ignorant people spread without knowing. feel like west coast south doomed rate. Can’t test low act like it’s gone. confusing since Oregon acts progressive can’t even get testing done masses. COVID19 really showing states reacting better. assume 1% IFR, go data here: suggest counties right now, like halfway herd immunity. reduces R0 30% itself, counting measures like social distancing masks. 9 friends?

Where buy them?  could take steps long earth there’d issue social distancing. Honestly shocked picture exists, I’m REALLY confused too. something wrong health system justify reason furlough health care staff middle pandemic. shoulda listened. it’s late... it... Yet death hospitalization rates remain mysteriously low... Hopefully people start wake COVID-19 blown proportion hysterical media outlets. It’s ok probably disappear July 4th think CFR important IFR?

Do know difference? thanks climate change, nobody ends living long enough COVID lung damage issue? Doc needs take refresher course constitution Orlando? Sure. 
Gainesville Tallahassee, maybe.
Everything else redneck gets. Americans selfish would've still gone public knew masks made difference (and would've taken healthcare workers needed to). time period order STAY HOME. (thus, need mask)  fever? assessing risk correctly. Maybe feel get suffer much do. They're probably right. becoming vectors others? 

If care stopping spread, support people staying home regardless individual risk. unfortunately part peril governing large economy account recent surge hospital cases many States - example Bullshit. entire thing pack lies.

This coming one side spectrum. hospitalization numbers, though? number tells us anything? every hypochondriac pay Urgent Care $100 week get tested every week yeah, find heck lot infected people -- many really sick thing? number going meh? planning visit parents holiday weekend past couple weeks. Today got call mother saying brother sick tested COVID either tomorrow Friday. first asked cancel trip said contact brother. informed actually contact last week(Thursday) cause picked work, downplaying saying he's probably sick almost definitely Covid, dad feel fine. 

 told needs wait brother's results come back ( especially planning see lots people) giving runaround. supposed leave early tomorrow. 

Would mom already shown symptoms it? 6 days since saw brother. mean. trust adults that? testing team.,we told ready launch. launched anyway. know one older nurse who, like retire it, mention people know actually did. Mexico's.

Mexico's goverment stupid. 

Trump dumbass, acts told foreign friends. Obrador plain stupid giant dose pendejo side.

I pity Gatell, work retarded goverment retarded oficials, questions ""press members"" ask unbearable listen to. Hard job completely surrounded idiots. Oof lol people. country. Geez, entire world. prayers. study used patients hospitalized. sure relevant seems worth mentioning made day. Thank you. It’s straight numbers fake now. That’s they’re saying Oh 😂😂😂 California's positivity rate 40% beginning. reason, tests, ones serious symptoms hospital tested. Funny Asia, US regarded relaxed counterpart. No, it’s mostly population way spread compared places good public transport. suburb model doesn’t work public transportation. need densely packed areas population. tell opening even patio seating bad idea right now. Don’t get comfortable. soon things loosen, cases come hard. Especially bars open Never say, seen anyone say, problem. think obviously is. probably big enough problem shut world again. hey, we'll see! Let's check back 6 months see looks crazy then. Also hick area Pennsylvania. little preview local Facebook group talking mask mandate 

[preview Yes, common East Asia, variety reasons ( anywhere preventing cough developing due dry air keeping moisture respiratory tract preventing one catching virus preventing one spreading virus cold). That’s aside though. What’s duty care American public knowingly violated. scale reference, Australia passed 8,000 cases... Total. numbers terrify me. Man second shit ends I’m fucking quitting job. sucked ass thing I’ve saved lot extra money afford take months focus school look another job. Bunker boy could literally almost back normal. economy would much better less people would dying sitting sick hospitals.

But can't bunch yee haw fucks unconfident they're scared seen mask. Probably shouldnt gone bar   TIL patulous eustachian . Funnily enough Australia things state state mostly (our PM quite economy lives get way) we're mostly okay. 🤷‍♂️ guess US response 💩 every level federal. 70% lot dude.... Higher R value, substantially testing, questionable accounting deaths NYC. One little known fact, clinical psychologists many, hospitals redeployed patients, internally handle trauma staff dealing with. we're proud you. body sore is. Body sores like lesions maybe, maybe not. grew giant flowers every corpse spread aerosolized droplets, would effective. think certain portions provided sensitive jobs. guy said affects rich people governor state dumbass. claims cured hot spicy soup.
Now, many people believe conspiracy theory actually doctors infecting patients steal liquid knees use power 5G towers control microchips injected COVID-19 vaccine. infuriating live pandemic, people stupid s*it like throw boiling water doctors.  Yes, actually true, example 92 year old nurse- cancer in. saw many people take care, first husbands family chock full type one diabetics. late 50s pretty responsible, still missing pieces. say sadly, usually type twos less stringent.  well internet stanger funny cuz true. Anyone says delusional, protests probably contribute lot, even without numbers would enormous. DFW here. Apart picking kids dropping mom, inside business since mid-March. Fuck noise...I'm 43; assuming lived, Covid would reduce life span 15 years, guarantee it. Underrated comment XD TIL saw report Southern Hemisphere country flu cases 75% Covid social distancing.... gave hope. xenophobic ignorant comment ....Donald gets battle wits GOB. went expected. Wait _are_ hooker? Imagine risking life see Vanilla Ice What’s breathing tube? How’s different ventilator? take literally. Democratic governments can't really impose draconian restrictions constituents hope reelection. Thus, submit electorate, many refuse cause discomfort sake others. Americans coddled. Wearing mask much burden. 

How dare virus want! Throw money big businesses! They'll solve it! sure, tradeoff, stated. Nah really. company reports whatever state agency refused work want try appeal you’re probably going win even it’s gonna clusterfuck beuracracy Sounds like tide pod kids college now.... say that? Farm workers going initial thinking. breathing virus, breathing droplets water contain virus.

This easy thing study. like stick people room sick person wearing different types mask find gets sick. studies try mimic speaking sneezing mask, hard control. Everyone breaths talks differently variously sized face holes. Even something like language accents effect it.

So go population studies. Countries regions high public mask usage decline. None high mask usage experiencing ""second wave"". again, flawed culture, health systems, density, etc play part.

We likely know answer virus longer threat. best, educated guess time masks, mask, best thing have. Quality matters, know put something face hole. county Nevada said give tickets non mask wearers, use opportunity educate.

Following mandate, mask wearing stores Reno gone like 25% 95%.

Non enforced mandates work. short: perfect weapon American mass destruction. can't quarantine shitbirds Ricky Julian. They'll find way around it. virus sentient.

that exactly point.  trying ""less lethal"".

I explicitly state point trying argue against. much president come disaster. US gets legitimacy US dollar foreign reserve currency. Fed announced zero interest rate perpetuity. increase debt load coming crisis two scenarios likely play - high inflation erosion dollar economic depression high direct taxation. one knows sure right one, seems money managers creating bull run gold stocks assets highly valued hedging US dollar. welcome um, whole opening schools thing... beard looks like eye patch neck people think NFL, MLB,and NBA still going happen. Hilarious. Yes, Fox News constant drone house growing up. longer listen except make sure understand people far right think, like flip CNN/MSNBC far left me.

I encourage think deeply really believe 150,000,000+ people US - one - ""fucking dumb"" ""best converse"" us. really believe that's true sit consider it? not, start bridging divide 150,000,000 people finding middle ground? Nah wave mostly young people. 


We’ll see spike third wave give parents grandparents. make MAGA masks. Trump make sure everyone wears one president serve one (6 year) term Mexico. never said was, expecting much underpaid strangers, Karen. this, US sometimes takes 12 days get results? delete messenger months group chat family lives south kept acting like idiot telling careful. July probably bad like 1918 Spanish flu history repeats itself. Every country idiots. America lot people recorded idiots spanish flu, also reopened early, quit wearing masks, second wave far worse first.

Yea haha I'm Asian, feel you. much space left face mask - makes easy fogging. probably risks involved, things go hill might able get treatment faster, I'm really sure. people, confirmation help much besides knowledge might antibodies.

Compared HIV genius virus world. carrier harbor virus decades infect people years without symptoms. Color bad. here, family rarely go wear masks GA. can't help we're surrounded idiots. can't infected virus outdoors practicing social distancing? Yikes. Yeah that's bad. One month later... well well well. Shit. question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies. Now, properly respond entire comment move on.  August 10th!?!?! That's insane get people US social distance. Thank you. admit wrong. auto-reply comment proving again. Good night. Social security includes disability. see could backfire big time? regards what? honestly us basically without leader toughest time faced recent years. Wearing mask hard, protect others. leader country sympathize wear one himself. president wore one, every one would follow. wearing mask beneath him, he's filthy peasant something. stop testing positive cases drop zero! Sounds like solution me. ""better stupidity"" ""better"" regular stupidity? think mean ""everything bigger Texas, including stupidity?"" post got removed political apparently, saying people need get used pandemics global scale. likely new normal  Im Mexican al due respect everyone.


Vete la mierda AMLO ones developed anti bodies Could self quarentine changes routine (eg. Less driving cars, less constructions) decreased number deaths making actual covid estimate higher? go West Chester university PA fall semester they're requiring everyone wear mask attending classes assume elementary high schools same. clever public information campaign cowboy Jeff Bridges bandanna mask would work lot better. gonna hot one never favor reading today 16 States havent even hit peak ICU utilization yet. article quoted [these healthdata.org Um, already. Several times. 

Get certain someone start wearing mask publicly maybe get cult follow. long won't, won't. really though? 

I Home Depot day minding business w/my mask on, keeping distance, picking soil embracing new quarantined life, working projects home, mindful activities health safety family, neighbors, friends, came across 3 non-mask wearing men walked right next me, crowded space one coughed lungs away standing 3 ft away me. literally rolled eyes gave death stare. Like wtf? It’s people like fear virus, truly dgaf selfish rude behavior. 

Needless say rushed car Lysol’ed myself. kids home high-risk mom. Yes. people unable work disability. One cousins bad headaches virus, even migraine meds work. working pain specialist. big trouble nationwide numbers.

People common sense. hard wearing damn mask. expand, looking excess death means looking number extra deaths particular time vs past data would us expect specific country/state/county/city/area/house question. 

In case, major difference historical data COVID, tell us good number many deaths caused disease, either directly indirectly. thing difficult estimating many deaths missing deaths COVID prevented (reduced accidents driving, travel, etc) Agree.

Thing exponential growth time reach 200 million cases whether started 10,000 cases 1,000,000 cases difference fortnight. really think Americans would've gone along wearing masks February like Asians do? realllllly hard time believing that.... pro-tect speak of? prioritizing wrong values (liberty harm/care). 

I’ve answered question, would love hear answer mine. starts. Spreading slower beginning precautions. time lockdowns like us California Que 🐶🐻 Mexican right now. God damn America can't first anything right, McDonald's looked backgrounds elected officials bet would raise red flags. Parking lots generally look empty hospitals one allowed visit. feel way.

Some studies found protective property diabetic patients long consumption Metformin. I'm sure Covid play exactly like movies. Probably not. Possible spreaders though. mean right, like Spanish flu sort disappeared killing millions people. That's heartbreaking.  ""new normal"" shit going last 13 years? Holy fuck. back question, keep seeing exponential growth mentioned. start 50k cases day limits closures, fast could reached? everyone masked back Feb/Mar, would fewer infections. Fewer infections mean fewer PPEs would needed healthcare workers. telling everyone wear mask, infections overwhelmed hospitals healthcare workers needed PPEs. got PPE shortage anyway. lose-lose. 

Taiwan 44M masks stockpiles Jan. That's enough give 2 masks resident. produced 1.7M masks per day time. means needed 14 days produce 1 mask per person entire population. That's clearly enough given kept economy open. 

They lie public. told public truth. banned exports rationed stockpiles. put engineers work. engineers built mask-making machines increased production lines government funding. government called military reserve could run production lines 24 hours day. ramped production 20M per day. 

That's smart government does: solve PPE shortage increasing productions. lie public cause infections deaths. can't believe expert government realized stupid idea was. indefensible. asked question. presume lied economist's convinced Trump economy would tank. Trump immediately saw mask wearing clear sign public something drastic wrong, therefore want anyone wearing masks. Unfortunately Trump, panic happened anyway. Right now, Trump working senior team develop consumer funding programs. could keep stock market alive, consumers happy election. imagine bad people feel beginning holiday season October know unable celebrate unable spend money maybe facing homelessness. True travel ban carriers came Europe. YOLO 600 75k infections dying, that's death rate 0.8%. chance someone group 10 people really low.

There's 1.5 million active cases 1 200 americans it.

Chance 1 person group 10 5% that's nationally may fucked place infection rates higher.

I’m expert infections compound way grows exponentially. That's happens potential cases counted actual cases Anybody intentionally coughs/spreads germs anybody anything arrested bioterrorism charges. single ""aimed"" cough someone's face could potentially cost 100s lives, country larger treated everyone, flat lie. 

China tested highest, nation higher us, tested 100 million or, 10%! tested 30 million 8.6% 

Also getting clean test Monday helpful could catch virus Tuesday, hence useful. antibody test useful reliable. Watch see. change come this. reinforce motto country:""I've got mine, worried yours."" That's us. Brö maybe everyone else overestimated it.

Exactly long take people finally wake dangerous virus actually is? I'm saying dangerous - *that* dangerous. 

Yes, highly contagious respiratory infection serious effects unusually vulnerable people. beyond that, everything told COVID19 turned false.

We told virus would kill millions US alone, false.

We told lockdowns would make go away, false.

We told would locked rate new cases leveled off, false.

Not lockdowns violate many laws make mockery many Constitutions; deprive millions basic liberties; cost millions people jobs thrust world economy worst economic straits since 1930s — top that, sown untold misery around world, mushrooming numbers poor people experience [acute food shortages millions children face interruption [vital medical mainstream media beginning admit facts. 

The truth, course, coronavirus didn’t cause hardships, least itself. Politicians *chose* inflict them. - thankfully - countries beginning realise acting accordingly - despite keep repeating ad naseum - also copped fact Covid-19 *that* dangerous. knew advance labs creating particular covid 19 plague?.....Easiest way make shitload money cure virus released public worldwide gameplan, right? Fair enough, purpose would suggest Indian newspaper would omitting fact? reports story clearly state surname Han returning home. really can't guess conclusion came to. true! taken seriously beginning used masks adhered social distancing may shut country first place. scientists warning strange virus causing pnemonia china sat said, well wont reach us. see house representatives member get still say cant happen me. see many die hospitals max brush like nothing.
We laughingstock world bothered try work containment. Pro-birth, anti-life.  logic 300,000 people die year flu obviously correct , mixing types data

There never lockdown US also ? course Fox News. else would tell without laughed studio? Oh definitely. Less people equal less transmission less possible cases. thinking one seat guy window seat makes safer ridiculous haha. boys thought sarcastic? Tbh Europe already shitting US considering voting tv star. search yt ""America first, Germany second"" (or eu country) fun. get Covid shit really hope hospital denies services. Ooh. Stern warnings now. Yeah Canada needs US way US needs Canada  agreed. Fuck...  Citizens return home. Diabetes considered high-risk comorbidity severe COVID-19 CDC. People high-risk comorbidity 12X likely hospitalized virus 6X likely die it.

Not mention, many immigrant communities access healthcare often untreated metabolic disorders. 

In Oregon several outbreaks among migrant farm workers live work conditions social distancing possible. real term it, get high horse. Tell everyone. self preservation runs rampant country, least people like narrative “its others” wear one. people start believing science instead lunatics running country, get better long time.

It's like herbal tea bullet wound. band-aid could theoretically help bit least. better off. people can't saved, amount effort time pain would take deprogram worth destroying life over. 

Hopefully she'll want change, want to. Cut contact clear why.

It sucks, I'm sorry. many hospitalized? Two problems that. One can't find childcare two days week, unless nanny something rich afford. massive glaring obvious issue wherever go two days defeats entire point cohorting kids begin with, multiplying spread exponentially making contact tracing nightmare. post multiple subreddits? cnn whitelisted here. post wasn’t removed. feeling you’re confused. That's what's pretty annoying. Like bullshit justifications (just general everything), Trumps bullshit testing = cases = look bad rooted kernel truth. Everyone ""knows"" right US pretty much worst place world coronavirus. lot countries retarded it, maybe even moreso, hundredth ""reported cases"" simply literally damn thing it, like even exist. Surely reality thing wildly control places too, isn't, blind luck kind. curious. many people actually personally know someone died Coronavirus. personally know anyone even got it. live Amsterdam, cafes shops schools open social distancing all. Everyone fine. stats CDC say 0.04 % US died far. actually less common flu (0.1%) curious hyped media? clearly 'pandemic'. get stopped lockdown? still lockdown US no-one it? Honestly India’s infections way behind rest world anyways. started spiking last month half, even long ago. lot time catch us US since March read absolutely crazy things Reddit. comment takes cake. want say I’m surprised said point expect kind idiotic statements Totally agree. thing would think contrary people closed space = potential virus spread compared fewer people. ""embers"" said....

It would ""disappear"" said..... Testing everyone possible practical. government can’t cancel debt don’t own, could right check loan holders spend another 6 trillion that’s saying. 

Not everything fixed stealing rich. Sorry.

Thank protestors. It’s funny Internet supposed usher Information Age: unprecedented access information everyone.

But propagandists actually found easier spread lies information today point history. reach much wider audience much faster, studied messages go viral automated science. Definitely safe but... 
Instead breathing air directly Corona six people, cut four 1/3 reduction. guess something. Kinda like putting band-aid bullet wound. required drug wonder required person using drug condition think we'll hit 100k+ per day August due this. Overall, Americans color face disproportionate risk exposure coronavirus, part concentrated densely populated areas, work industries deemed essential healthcare, factories transportation.

[Coronavirus cases skyrocketing among communities outbreak worsens throughout South West, caseloads growing fastest counties large communities color.

Los Angeles County's population 74% minorities Maimi-Dade County's 87%.

The protests partial reopenings gave younger people false sense security. Maybe Lebo better downtown really bad. Fwiw im counting people put masks enter building take immediately exit. 

Brookline shit one wears time im dormont take throngs people without masks street.

I want right ever see us non compliance malicious compliance There's people alive today survived Spanish influenza covid 19 , covid may may worse Spanish flu , statement true , least yet ! Ned Stark, you? Fuck em. scary  😂 what’s current death rate. that's industry call ""moronic move"". OK, many active cases? many contagious people? many show symptoms?

Seems like scare tactics. Canada build wall get USA pay Assuming job flat lay unable work, that's 2 days less able work per week, guarantee jobs tolerate sort hour reduction. figured said also get eyes Well case congratulations today's new high score. new high score tomorrow. new one day after, foreseeable future. That's relatively common hospice situation primary goal keep someone pain. often look primary source rather someone reporting people often tilt source political reasons wear mask, big problem opposite mask yes yes, joke already made earlier thread. Less tests means less cases, right? RIGHT!? No, medical community believed one point 

It mass conspiracy ignorance, certainty right, despite ignorance distrust real knowledge time.

They step mud, wallow it. numbers even fudges. countries record fraction deaths. believe India improved recently, still records 70% percent deaths 20% medically certified doctor. One thing Fauci seems ignoring role weather playing this.

The case counts don’t track re-openings, track season people spend time indoors due extreme heat. much country wanting ""Defend constitutional rights"", think unfortunately correct friend 

I hope wakeup call, Im sure lot people believe hoax massively stroking egos attend event &amp; dont get sick/are asymptomatic S.O. (36) (33) started showing symptoms within day back mid February. thought bronchitis/sinus infection, didn’t make sense neither one contagious per se. bronchitis times (use smoke) sinus issues usually year, figured time year. S.O. never either ended going doc given breathing treatment sent home inhaler told take cough/cold medicine. gone week later probably would told go home quarantine. “virus” came waves, usually feeling crappy run down, cough sinus issues, worst loss taste smell ever experienced low grade fever 3-4 days 1-2 days feeling better, 3-4 days crap. went month. Now, 5 months later, I’m still sinus issues. pre-existing conditions except smoking ten years prior quitting year. 


TLDR: got February, still sinus issues. realized CDC data 2020 include January, Feb 1 - July 1. last time Americans deliberatly fucked economy large brick construction world war. hope come far time. sad many lives must needlessly put danger order create kind change happened months ago people common sense. suppose could true talking changes happened years ago recently considered lives put risk say got hot?? university saying definitely going back fall, fastest growing city (Charlotte) one fastest growing states (NC) daily new cases. Brexit hasn’t finished yet. still travel EU. Technically, we’re still *kinda* part EU. India's gamble enforcing relatively strict lockdown beginning completely avoiding local transmission, like e.g. Vietnam. succeed, choice epidemic famine. (I think lockdown total failure though; gave time better understand virus provide better treatments)

Also, coronavirus *not* contained everywhere Southeast Asia. Bangladesh Indonesia looking alarming, know long countries peninsula hold surrounded three sides. think there'd videos posted people left dead streets.

isnt already india though say though people US didn’t choose government. actual shut down, half assed american shut down. I've heard said obscenely wealthy often turn philanthropy later life, so-called attempt ""buy way heaven"" ruthless decisions misdeeds got wealth first place.

No need stomp her. heart right place. bring science facts party share. bring thoughts prayers informed well uplifted. important. Spoken truly like somebody zero experience matter. figure know substantially virus fucking dare use logic Reddit. kids dont typically get "" wish intubate Michael, protocol administering treatment drug Remdesivir required.

I think remdesivir needs incubation. one check that?

Yes NY Times article... watch video vice made Brazil bolsonaro Blue cross baby

Edit: also spent 3 months quarantine gf nurse covid icu. perspective may skewed Take damn upvote! Fox viewers. #1 cable news. going anywhere soon. fact, growing. Especially since Fuckerberg loves dinner conservatives. know he's going straight lie say he's saying whole time, fake news lied said wasn't. Youth behaving riskily like since species existed. Big ooft response last line edited in, dont think know constitution actually purpose was. Pandemic response absolutely covered lines domestic Tranquility, provide common defence,promote general Welfare

If falls those, laws specifically limiting power government things, ABSOLUTELY them. Obviously find mask wearing pandemic response constitution. find much anything specific. really think need research purpose formation US government. Yeah 20k cases today definetly wide spread Mask policy would cut spread lot everyone wore wore correctly. would cut spread enough things could opened spread would increase exponential rate. Problem enforcement mask mandates many people comply. could fix could open things US like difficult want feel inconvenienced infringed upon got insurance? 100% agree everything said. heard someone say biggest mistake telling Americans masks helping others themselves. think perfectly summarizes mindset pretty large % Americans, people general Thx work. Chance even lower then, less 1/300 people ventura county puts 3%

Bit iffy though current numbers people infected much fortnight ago still pretty low chance one off. real tipping point community spread. want get point almost cases know source. point track trace isolate becomes effective management. notify contacts potential contact becoming infectious.

This drastically reduces R0 without social distancing requirements makes stability much simpler, requiring much less public. 

This countries successfully managing achieved however ship might sailed US. Without drastic change leadership bounce state stopping hospitals getting overrun require far significant social distancing far often. 34.0 minute delay fetching comments.

The obvious truth (1) discussions novel coronavirus inherently improved allowing full discussions relevant issues, (2) subreddit primary source news debate COVID-19, (3) hamstringing discussions serve status quo. thought tiger balm? release subjects Florida respiratory transmitted disease. Masks prevent spread respiratory disease. That's new. Asia, people heard respiratory disease spreading, people put masks without urging. common sense. :q! Ugh. many people don’t realize wearing mask spreading virus cause quarantine (I think that’s right word) last longer! Yeah want end people helping. making things worse Anybody know Governor Newsom banned card rooms haven’t around prevalently least 3 decades yet gyms still allowed open? someone please explain me?? come worked rest world specifically US? Deaths bein still low mean much since lags far behind cases, also weird metric hold onto IMO since know many people recover still permanent problems. Like Gov touting young people gettin sick. like ""heyyyy long y'all dont die fuck numbers, good!""

And yea agree, even ya came tomorrow said 100% masks nothing upset. thin piece cloth, people need stfu wear mask You’re onto something. people look alike related due Mongolians nomadic crossed bearing strait Americas long time ago. Long lost connection, indeed. There's way I'm driving far go restaurant. still get takeout LA I'm desperate cook. I'm sure mind linking studies back claims? good weirdos thinking death sentence

For lot people, *is* death sentence. 130,000 deaths US alone, that's officially counted ones. probably fair bit higher that. survive, serious damage lungs, lasting health issues. congrats antibodies guess, maybe take bit seriously... one those. Shit sucks. Ventura County (SoCal). Cases somewhat low, theres spike. Ive learned lesson though, parties think harm hidden us. Americans know someone personally spent time intubated died. People get sick taken hospitals generally hidden public. media can't (or won't) film hospitals, seeing suffering going on. 120k died many painful recoveries, media sources sharing enough us.

Just 2 cents covid largely ignored now. someone lives Atlanta, I’m tell that’s definitely case news next pandemic heating China swine flu illness jumped humans

I really can't imagine people would upvote post... 


50,000+ new cases day. Highest death toll developed world, per capita rate that's approaching worst cases. I'm expert, health experts freaking out, also pretty clear 50,000+ daily new infections positive exponential curve absolutely atrocious. 


Despite biases, also like seeing UK Sweden fail make US better. Genuinely wondering here, able tell lowers fertility relatively quickly? Portland, couple weeks ago, playing. went restaurant one morning stopped ""masks, please, come in"". forgotten. knew something felt off. going new normal while. really big deal.  heard zoom? Gov Ducey wants keep businesses open, least mandate AC get turned off. one considering this, question had. Also things mentioned would still operation considering everyone would thered risk spread it. Lol Sweden could show real nordic cooperation close borders. Dunno situation Denmark, Finland simply cant stop people traveling, recommend it. Luckily none far. could, we’d surely know now. need read general welfare clause. feelz irrelevant. 

It’s catch think 

Trump can’t pass laws either. 

There possible way mask mandate feds constitutional, but, keep thinking can. 


As Madison argued:

If Congress apply money indefinitely general welfare, sole supreme judges general welfare, may take care religion hands; may establish teachers every State, county, parish, pay public Treasury; may take hands education children, establishing like manner schools throughout Union; may undertake regulation roads post roads. short, every thing, highest object State legislation, minute object police, would thrown power Congress; every object mentioned would admit application money, might called, Congress pleased, provisions general welfare.

He says earlier letter Pendletion:

It remarked phrase doctrine elaborated, copied old articles Confederation, always understood nothing general caption specified powers, fact preferred new instrument reason less liable misconstruction. Letter w:Edmund Pendleton (21 January 1792)

So understood most, time, nothing “general caption specified powers” means, directive Federal, actions pertain common defense, treaties commerce foreign nation, etc, must best interests federation united States, People per se.

The powers delegated proposed Constitution federal government defined. remain State governments numerous indefinite. former exercised principally external objects, war, peace, negotiation, foreign commerce; last power taxation will, part, connected.

The powers reserved several States extend objects which, ordinary course affairs, concern lives, liberties, properties people, internal order, improvement, prosperity State. Federalist 45 first started people said iT’s LeSs 50

Then iT’s LeSs 9/11

Then goalposts moved LeSs fLu

Now I’m “sheep” apparently set definition. 

You familiar thing qualify weigh it, amazingly. Congrats team! Let's see can't double Birthday. could honestly real reason would shocked slightest. It’s Florida, it’s really sadly. might need learn 2016 election. Outside actors totally fucked retarded segments population.

Waiting Night King. doubting know seeing dramatic reductions fatality rate learn more. 130k deaths, 0.26% fatality rate, implies 50m cases US. Would make sense?

Interesting.  can't believe found someone wanted sheep.

Can friends?! pandemic waves are? They're theory understanding pandemics. 

You wave people getting sick, trough people take action, social distance, etc. another wave restrictions removed. Australia significant trough, Victoria see beginning second wave. pretty obvious graph Likely means shortage medicine. there's serious shortage, make decision give medicine worst-off patients. Covid, means patients ventilators. can't meet requirement, can't get meds.

Other articles quoting TX doctors saying enough it. masks followed Asia. wearing since late Feb never looked back. [Insert fifth synonymous term here.] We’re agreement. seen lot people comment issue jumped conclusions. Apologies.

I think lot way people acting. coronavirus first emerged(and people took seriously) Fauci team claiming masks useless. I'm always wondering India this, thought would difficult time, put lightly. heard anything, weird. It’s protect profit. It’s entirely possible hospitals might go bankrupt shut completely. Rural hospitals across country already struggling. hospitals US profit, way. profit ones actually better position right now, since wide profit margin money available take hit. profit hospitals don’t funds readily available stay operational bleeding money.

Now, don’t think laying staff way go, point it’s profits, it’s staying open all. It’ll really interesting see financial reports see much revenue actually lost tried recoup loses. know hospital, clinical staff last resorts cuts. management’s hours already cut 1/3 lot non clinical support staff cut already well.

Because find plenty media affirms beliefs. Propaganda strong shit! think plenty things close beaches. Guy idiot agree that. outside 95 degree heat, strong sunlight, sand saltwater can’t conducive spread.

I think it’s outrage seeing looks like overcrowded beaches sets politicians people dying businesses crumbling. better beach air conditioned house party. you? specifically state treating family if/when get it... skipping fact helping carries possibility reinfecting you. 

All plans based catching assuming never catch again. And, assumption totally fine process fine recover.

It makes think know anyone it. That's OK. But, short sighted. Ah, drunks. anything can't do?

(Apart hold job, raise well adjusted children, drink course.) Yea, reading ""article"", one least scientific pieces literature I've misfortune looking over. Notice study linked, cherry picks like one two sentences studies support claim. go studies links, support evidence masks significantly reduce spread pathogens. Nowhere article author actually post infection rate results studies - except one cherry-picks graphic again, posts unrelated sentence article actually *different* graphic, order make seem like two things somehow related.

This ""study"", sensationalist piece clearly written hypothesis masks work, cherry picks segments actual scientific studies without actually giving cross-examination study referenced. studies also *older*, 3 past 2015 count, author specifically quoted recent studies *clearly demonstrate strong correlation* mask wearing reduce spread viral pathogens.

The author's whole premise 2 fold: 

(**A**) infection rate tied directly humidity levels air ^((which, clear, amount humidity air) *^(will)* ^(effect spread SARS-CoV-2... nothing masks)), humidity levels contributing pattern infection rates lockdown/ preventative measures countries taken. *This insane argument. INSANE.* 

COVID-19 infection rates spread globally, clear connection humidity levels driving factor behind spread. Yes, humidity *will* effect life-span viral bacterial spread droplets air. However deterioration/effect pretty much irrelevant within close proximity human human contact. breathe somebody else, cough droplets land them, humidity becomes factor far droplets travel virus survive almost instant transport host host. 

The coronavirus pandemic epicenters went: First Wuhan Province; Southern Italy Spain; New York City; Texas, Florida, Arizona, California Brazil rise. areas *nothing* common climate wise would demonstrate environment driving force behind spread disease. whole ""seasonal disease"" spread consistently demonstrated humans change social behavior reaction environmental changes. i.e. Humans closer contact winter months indoors, therefore chance virus spread people immunity disease. 

There clear correlation contact tracing, timely quarantine, active social distancing measures, nation getting local endemic spread control. evident SARS-CoV-2, human movement societal behavior *much more* impactful viral spread environmental/climate factors area. 

The author extrapolates humidity must effecting transport aerosolized droplets, therefore masks irrelevant because:

(**B**) virus small particles ""are subject gravitational sedimentation"" ^((literal quote article)), therefore immune physics, would float straight everyone's mask.

There things unpack here.

SARS-CoV-2 *is* *very small*, true. Theoretically, free-floating particle virus would able drift multiple layers mask ""dodging"" weaved stands. masks filters full seals around face obviously superior working *any* pathogen/chemical. Though still impacted gravity, different rate.

However, SARS-CoV-2 airborne pathogen. far current scientific research shows, aerosol - meaning virus transported small droplets perspiration (mostly either spit water droplets breathing). droplets much larger microscopic virus itself, *will stopped mask*, therefore reduce chance spreading infection. 

Weirdly enough, author uses fact SARS-CoV-2 spread aerosol explain humidity theory... immediately extrapolates airborne properties onto virus explain would spread masks, thus make useless. *That's works. That's works.* 

Either fully grasp aerosol virus is, current body evidence SARS airborne particle. intentionally malicious spread disinformation; hoping readers notice humidity theory relies aerosol, mask penetrating theory relies airborne. 

**In conclusion:** blog post makes lot assumptive leaps, based upon direct research data SARS-CoV-2; author even come definitive conclusion masks useless agains SARS, really complains government mandates masks unfounded. aren't. 

Its hit piece, masks (?), makes sense me. They're inoffensive items huge benefit provide. Even like 25% chance reduction ^((evidence shows closer 80+% reduction parties wear mask)), piece cloth put face hour public shopping. worth it? 

There reason blog post, published scientific journal... fucking blog post scientific piece literature. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The whole argument mask silly. brainer. simple question: Would go surgery told *no-one* would wear mask operating room?

No, wouldn't. Why? masks help reduce spread viral bacterial pathogens.

Wash hands, wear mask, help save world. really simple.  Make America Great Again. great initial peak CDC said protect wearer. many people assume others grasp science. one inherently born knowledge germ theory airborne diseases. That's organizations protect people, lie them. confirm. home sensible. need help! school board meeting yesterday grueling 9 hour theater absurd told that. used social distancing marching parade protests. could distance worn mask. Nobody could ever guessed us would handled badly. thought US also lockdown guess not? percentage Covid patients suffer lasting side effects? 

What percentage Influenza patients suffer lasting percentage Pneumonia patients suffer lasting effects? couple links complications “some cases” *completely unrelated* point made virulence new strain. 

It’s significantly virulent. Data proves it. Antibody testing data getting enough traction media. You’re prime example not. 

Covid contagious right new corona strain — it’ll remain way society allowed build immunity ideally mild loads use masks. Korea Taiwan serve excellent examples this. 

Reopening vs everything shut idiotic conversation peculiar west educated people like yourself. Looking wrong part picture. willful ignorance, willful stupidity.

Ignorance cured knowledge. Stupidity, hand, death sentence. what's going even infuriating whenever thing end (I'm hopeful here) he's going puff chest say ""see, told you"" base lose collective minds saying right along. ANYTHING it. like someone watching storm pass saying ""it'll blow over."" Well shit. really adding discussion buddy. Beautiful. friend issue. Turns homemade/donated mask made properly. got better mask issues. asthma, hard time wearing cloth masks. wear surgical masks issues. Look around, may find something work you, see doctor, normal. USA number one longer anyone else good reason stupidity. 50k+ cases today us body. human, converting virus incubator. selfish assholes. Everybody knows now. Bars, outdoor something something, socially distancing something something, flying something something...

Everybody saying economy important saving lives strangers everybody take personal responsibility health. People know wise fly anyways blame United take responsibility health actions. expect transition viable careers/jobs time line work halt, potentially indefinitely. I'm tired everyone acting like McDonald's walmart places hiring that's true. people got asses actually went looking work would realize that, instead wanna cry government. Indeed. Young people aren’t ones re-opened bars. it’s 50% effective get twice, simple statistics. Houston, problem.

(Weird thar headline used.) Well guess 6 months later kinda seems like they've failed. Put jail see like Face mask important beaten overall infection count rate down. Norway, Denmark Finland never mandatory mask ordinance, acted swiftly contain outbreak, started mass-testing.  You’re sick person please get help. True, true hope feel much better soon. :( vaccine expert might something need get yearly. There's also different ways vaccines work type that's used may offer better immunity getting actual Covid-19 virus does. No, CDC guidance counting everyone contact case without confirming states ""number"" would much higher. No, course not. There's much good. I'm England far off. locked eventually ok we're trying absolute best awful now. lot people totally given up, especially younger crowd. No, southern KS.  Bingo. Hopefully people finally fucking get &amp; become receptive changing society preserve longer run. dare accuse virus homophobic racist. virus stops spreading virtuous events like protests, pride festivals riots. 

It’s bad governors people outside this.

Nevermind there’s 10x deaths NY FL — he’s done great job live NJ. Everyone wears em indoors. It’s debate really. Could cuz we’ve hell past three months wife pregnant guess job danger.  dare accuse virus homophobic racist. virus stops spreading virtuous events like protests, pride festivals riots. 

It’s bad governors people outside this.

Nevermind there’s 10x deaths NY FL — he’s done great job mean, would certainly say “more often not”. certainly happen, hope thinking here. Since previous brain injury, suppose assumed already g-tube long prior Covid. Sad ironic. Potentially dying survival course, like people caught funeral. fortunately is.

Still I'm afraid virus exponential growth. graphs US clearly show takes quite virus noticed, already late.

The shambolic US response way comparable great Czech response, however preventive measures thrown window see inevitable virus comes back strong. I'm sure point lingering effects cause preexisting conditions. Almost everyone pre-existing condition. They've documents seasonal allergies pre-existing condition combined covid cause blood clots lungs get dislodged cause strokes get caught limbs force amputated.

I'm fine wearing mask rest life. comfortable big deal. wore condoms got married, I've always washed hands using bathroom generally problems really simple easy things protect others disease. live NYC know personally seven people it. Including brother one best friends. Also, another friend lost father. fiance's godmother lost entire family (7 died). pandemic. live near Hotspot. happen you, mean real. Sadly, yes. UK clued most, really see things international-media perspective.

Didn't guy try claim HGV drivers protesting rally? really comprehend idea people like him?

Please correct educate subject necessary btw, I'm willing concede know facts well US citizens probably Fck experience countries like South Korea, Japan Singapore. research, take sweet 3-4 months publish wow, turns masks save people infection! would thought? Bring thread US purchasing US drug people around globe arms. 

 
China good. 

This sub agenda.  US diplomats like former fitness instuctors 1980s TV soap series actors anyway. Like mean people China wearing masks years illness ever spread there....masks must answer! You’re gross. Sorry. doctor..

Fremulon direct contact asymptotic carrier course days didn’t know. got test results I’m negative. got sick February chances already ? already happening lot “white folk”. lower income level. doesn’t matter. friend mine SERE Airman really fucked it. torture resistance training including water boarding according drunken break around fire one night later.

I took word friend supported I’d lying wasn’t open idea wasn’t true. one tall tale friends begin with, main thing lent credibility head pretty solidly fucked way never seen before.

So I’ve never known quite think. shhh, USA gonna cut funding saying that. oh wait, already done. Say Trump's face.   cops responsible enforcing masks? Right. Worldometer shows record daily deaths (it feels disgusting typing out) 8,485.  seeing post make rounds Facebook hack disable tracers, people horrid. ""The dynamics SARS-CoV-2 pandemic share ""striking similarities"" twin environmental crises global heating species extinction, argue team scientists policy experts UK US.

Good job, NM! :D Lol people running McDonalds ain’t people flipping burgers.. run one biggest businesses world.. I’m sure smart enough hate say America, literally would handled crisis better president slice toast.

Well done Trump, exceeded expectations absolutely useless. Seems like CDC needs step test masks show efficacy come standard recommendation. still many people claiming masks don’t work, suffocate them. would like make informed decision buying mask - example would rather get one filters 30% small droplets 10%. Anything along lines would help, whether standard, comparison materials, even working companies mass produce effective mask everyone.

If masks effective “disease control”, CDC focusing them. look forward cold weather when, like miracle, disappear.

Unless people heat buildings something. Boy, that'd stupid. Yeah science liberal conspiracy.

Always teaming reality make Trunp Americans look batshit crazy! work suddenly several months nobody calling sick anymore. guess shaking hands social distancing works spread diseases. Science right, surprise. South Carolina major cities passed mask ordinances. governor held press conference saying aren’t enforceable. shut up. I’m tired men “pretending” men, rather actually man. 

Look facts, put mask, attempt empathy. number tests per day mentioned anywhere around here? US testing insane rate. gone 150-200k April/May 600-650k per day (over 1 million tests done one day ago!). Plano checking in! another mRNA vaccine, that's exciting. wonder one successful, believe testing 4 slightly different ones.

Incoming second wave.. joke... prick let Texas secede Username checks course do. I’m sick people saying protect others wearer offer protection parties. take goddamn upvote go. assuming tested America’s level, would likely 5-10 times number cases. loved ones arent dying enough would force people take seriously.

if mortality 10%, u'd see everyone wearing mask would deaths street block apartments. course Taiwan news would say this!

That said, big accomplishment, like saying emo 16 year old diarrhoea rap better Vanilla ice, everyone knows scientific method something people find difficult understand.

Let us pray continental United States receives balmy temps low 60s modest breeze July, August, September. guess boils fact don’t know story completeness, assume media capitalizing drama ask personal leave state? one encourage working but, maybe 30 day leave like many companies offering due families 1st cates act? get unemployment out? admitted psychiatric facility give ""partying"" bad name sue? long rural thugs show guns total tantrum government building?  Rona poppin attended BLM march, would problem? Aka shithole r/nottheonion Dude, NY don’t fuck around. say it’s $2000 fine, it’s $2000 fine. fight it, scenario doubt anyone would case. hear still deliver White House yep, agreed. feel like deja vu. reading articles people acting way acting way back beginning March. Great job bunch fucking freedumb idiots. Keep fighting masks downplaying hoax, we’ll get new high score time thanks ignorance Also led hottest states. spike didn’t happen Re-opening, happened got hot people started spending time indoors. Look GA, opened first, cases continued fall long time opening. got hot. psychos Karen, but... really? KOP area bunch yet see someone wearing mask. Maybe choosing right stores patronize Cmon, tell like is. reopened states dumb r e states. data shows it. always interested someone would get plane this. important there? mean, problem people flying - airlines doing. cases *national* level. already trending reopen states.

by 6/3, Arizona going up.  seen country list? excludes entirety developed world.

I make car available dog, he's going drive. Exactly. medical services public system seems collapsed weeks/months. preparation play catch-up make room every patient. Trump’s aides worried looking new job November. weird thing covid affecting certain industries, also certain parts industries. machinist main customer universities, ones closed long time. neighboring company makes parts cars said business booming. Companies like Amazon well meat packing plants hit hard. weird virus, weird times live in. Whoever playing computer right needs get off. I'd plan sabbatical. No, California state biggest surge either per capita even overall. Florida Texas comparable bigger surges CA 2/3 1/2 size CA, respectively.

Texas added 7926 cases today. Scaled California's size, would around 10,659 cases, much California.

Florida's 7-day average 6990. Scaling California's size, would around 12,981 cases.

Georgia added 2,946 cases today. Scaling population CA, would 12,000 cases, CA.

Alabama 1/13 population California. 7-day average 992, scales 12896 cases, again, much California.

Arizona added 4,877 cases today. Scaling population California (~ 5x bigger), would 24,385 (!!).

We keep going, see, California biggest surge, even close, per capita, even raw numbers.

And gets worse. California tested around 108K per million people. Texas tested around 75K per million, discrepancy even larger.

I'm guessing since saying that, looking carefully actual figures. look see yourself.

The two causes recent outbreak 1) reopening 2) distance initial outbreak NYC. CA, true. States like MA, NJ, CT, etc., already peaked kept lockdowns, surging.

In states surging, common denominator reopening away initial outbreak (so never went degree New England Mid-Atlantic states did). see deaths trending think? Honestly. kind essential dining areas open. Think people need space.. public service vulnerable people, giving access bathroom, refills, wifi, air conditioning heating, protection rain, social stimulation. Open McDonald's dining areas. “In insular nation, government organs subject head ruling Party—now striving maintain firm grip levers power—have published figures disputed academics.” That's early pandemic believe. Though agree, reality we're probably 100,000 per day new infections right now.  I'm Texas family there. Honestly, I'd bet money mom going get it. reckless taking seriously - current job perform terminal cleanings retail locations positive patients traced back to. listen it. posts pictures people wearing masks, goes bars, goes sing karaoke. 60s boat load pre-existing conditions. sounds terrible I'm mentally preparing demise. could seen coming? Tens thousands lives would saved cabinet invoked 25th amendment stuck Pence there. would lose White House year, ship already sailed. 

Why difficult make man accountable complete failure? Testing increasing, test positivity *also* rising is...not good sign. way US open schools safely. can’t even get pencils classrooms, much less partitions. Already effect uber ride apps month now. People generaly use masks indoors without fuss I've seen far Give week. agree. Dr. Campbell got little carried away criticism. author said something like ""Who would thought six months ago lives would turned upside virus like this"".  think grabbing reader's interest expressing common personal reaction, expressing professional reaction. I'm one never gets sniffles. Always bad sore throat, stuffed nose, fever, runny nose horrible cough. Usually takes two weeks go phase fully recover. head foggy throughout I'm less useless miserable around whole time. top always worst time, like day business trip days someone's wedding.

So yeah, would take lot purposely get sick. let drivers report riders lead cooling period hail uber rides. hard lmao, think sub hardon fear mongering. recall bad back Feb. Worldometer uses GMT+0. Downgraded optional Hippocratic suggestion someone US too, can't comprehend reason people mask, like WTF, save life people around using simple mask, even need sacrifice something wearing mask outside (maybe little uncomfortable, but, saving lives man).

Or bad logic IDK, can't find reason people use mask, Chile almost everyone, ever goes outside uses mask disappear virus. January 2021 can't come soon enough. Eh said shareholder I'd want charge. Tesla truck huge homerun gets market. Right, poof like miracle it’s gonna disappear Death rate sole point arguing doesn’t bode well country. Death rate dropping marginally cases rising exponentially still equals disaster think mandatory nationwide. hard put mask people. massachusetts masks mandatory basically everywhere, almost everyone see wears them. understand people still try deny this. I’ll fight I'm also MontCo - everywhere go, people wearing masks. Whether line Rita's grocery store, soul around without face covering on. don't, however, wear masks go hiking run around neighborhood. thoughts that? Airlines reason virus spread much has. shouldn’t get bailouts, punished largest superspreaders. Damn that’s huge tv. I’m ass.... 85 foot.... face covering/surgical mask help stop spread others, protect wearer. examples self-preservation (seatbelt, helmet, eye/ear protection etc.). non-mask wearing people, care others. Even pre covid anyone made plans 6 months advice crazy. Like that's far away planning already like  Also virologists clearly wear suits they're working deadly diseases regular basis, unreasonable expect general population every day. Suits effective erase masks also effective lesser degree. 

Literally none saying makes sense. issue northeast specific cities hit hard initially. Ultimately, lot cities south never really got hit, leasing people thinking virus worse actually is, biting butt. look regional trends, northeast/Midwest great terms cases/deaths. fact, county reported 10 new cases today well anyone explain kids 12 exempt mandatory mask rules several states? could understand maybe 3. aren’t kids even likely spread since don’t often show symptoms still shedding virus? would expect positive rates increase test less people testing restricted strongest symptoms. Presumably best job identify ones least likely survive decline treat them. Actually cases broke old weekly highs June 18th, 13 days ago. They've ""rising"" low 3 weeks, low one lowest ever recordings. took week surpass highs previous 4 5 weeks, really ""abnormal"" times began. i’m talking mainly traditional restaurants majority dine customers.  thing. Swedes found herd immunity work, killed lot people trying. Scientists also believe immunity may last 3 4 months, could get again. Nice,huh? drivethru!! Deaths skyrocketing. Use brain know facts make decision based them, socialize, even it’s online, try ass, stay strong. Ironically coronavirus situation control state require adults wear seatbelts. thought descriptive content post original preferred. r/theydidthemath Sex panther may need Sounds like good news me. I'll take it!  Maybe he'll dig canal!!  countries high diabetic population however. Especially Mexico Brazil. guess China think Mexico's death count accurate government hiding numbers? topic thanks indirectly reminding much better wawa's hoagies compared sheetz's subs.. hope upset wearing masks dont get angry ruin cars. drive nice cars Thanks lot China! gonna schools everywhere knows when. deaths no? Yeah it’s terrible would well half competent President. 

But reality happening know virus now? finally protecting nursing homes. median age infections 30s. 65+ before. also know people 60 IFR less .1%. 

Given understand shutting bars. beaches? open spaces? last weeks politicians endorsed mass protests? Live cam Brooklyn hipsters gathering closely mask. There's chat room people calling out.

http://www.thelotradio.com There's ""no gatherings 50 people law?"" Oh right Texas. many cases Kuwait, risk it.  Well good luck soldier, could get bumpy Prisoner a174364 visitor How's testing capacity US? increasing testing could explain high number infections didn’t factor exponential rate don’t know rate is. could plus minus given percentage point time. Professionals can’t even figure out. Nobody knows. Thus took current numbers right now. 

I mean feel free create graph shows exponential rates. doubt anyone would opposed that. run? ""Mah Freedums!!"" 🤦🏻‍♂️ Yea! Especially start destroying personal property, burning business and, looting!! Late September/Early October goal, likelyhood Christmas, depending get approval releasing data trials Late August/Early September general timelines thrown around right US, I’ve seen news, SM (regarding COVID protests) *and mean offense* significant group citizens entitled, rely HIPAA wearing masks. Now, don’t know they’re aware mask reduce oxygen saturation (I tried test N95 2 hrs, maintained level), it’s uncomfortable wear. Honestly, feel people like aware dangers/effects covid. Keep safe stay positive!

Edit: Acronym probability mathematics. I’ve seen people fuck type math doesn’t require higher education study. look second source see misunderstood data. data points ""deaths pneumonia without covid"". There's data point ""deaths pnumonia without covid"".

Sorry dude would much rather see Color Badd Vanilla Ice. Same, hope able find good place land. anything like 2008, going sometime next year companies start looking add People Operations leadership. hoping CARES act gets extended! point issuing edict enforcement Yeah, real. (26) live younger brother (23) husband (27). None us gone restaurant, bar, concert, indoor super spreader areas since March. things we've done (both activities two weeks ago) attend blm protest (200 people, wearing masks, lady screaming everyone social distance, people doing) collect signatures via drive-in legal marijuana ballot initiative (while masking up, outside). even locked house back (we lifted restriction people coming house couple weeks ago) heard recent spikes Arkansas. People straight stupid trashy, see, mostly middle-aged people refuse wear mask Walmart. husband luckily works overnight stocking Walmart get groceries lunch break. parents, went right back restaurants soon re-opened, mocked brother wearing mask inside house yesterday. None people news extremely vocal anti-mask 35. Young people smart, either, they've going out, ones spreading shit! USA always screwed economically, socially health wise. virus nothing new. amplified everyone understand broken system is. bangladeshi, cant believe news articles see reddit. simply doesnt add happening here. honestly dont know fuss dont know anyone get really ill it. Imagine march masks nowhere found would told masks safe live. would one bloody mess. People would torn masks others. would worse toilet paper. could good example spew lies misinformation ongoing threat.

He also could wear mask good example. USA tragic would kind funny country fucking every step pandemic.

But MAA FREEDOM! Hopefully situation Melbourne reminds rest Australia quickly things spiral control we're careful. Yeah apparently people AL holding Coronavirus parties, invite infected person first one positive test gets money. small (80ish people) anti mask protest FL. infuriating. Yes means can't tell reality thoughts fair doctor surgeon general hypocratic oath whatever it’s called actually told people to.  wear want.  wear masks. 

Don’t let anger trump blind there’s one failure top scientists doctors lying population accord helped virus spread exponentially makes ppl question advice.  Countries lockdown lower excess deaths. excess dearhs directly indirectly caused covid. Whoops! Looks like headline wrong. Allow fix it...

**Masks may protect wearer coronavirus entire United States Government state Governors originally thought, new research suggests** wasn’t exactly light hearted post begin with... need 50k deaths per day concerned? want pretty numbers match IQ? shouldn’t concerned vaccine come out. leading vaccine right now, Oxfords, uses modified version well know vaccination method. It’s quite safe.  Schrodingers virus What's different states? much knowledge US would thought somewhere like California would listened experts followed rules? math Isnt original one ""The market always right"" Fuck automod, violence COVID deniers self-defense. I'm Europe Gatlinburg Pigeon Forge. go days fun definitely *deserve* rudeness rage. Trying figure idiotic comment about. chances getting covid-19 high traveling airplanes two airports? He's safe, everyone approaching wears masks gets tested;

dude probably washes tiny hands 20x day like useful idiots they've created. Brazil takes cake. They're straight fucking people over. believe huge misstep, don’t really think it’s accurate say lied masks. think weren’t clear told us weren’t effective did. time, wasn’t clear transmission mostly respiratory might spread surfaces food, etc. time, safest thing try ensure healthcare workers would undoubtedly exposed masks, didn’t know effectiveness general public masks would outweigh potential negatives respiratory transmission negligible. research found is. public relations important. Yeah. people poor, lockdown going long.

The government sent food aid packages, many government officials responsible delivering poorest people simply delivered personal warehouses, sell later. Corruption. Thus far, nothing police. contact tracers courts. sure ""I wanna sex up"" appropriate song practice social distancing to. ""Ask China! didnt mess numbers took swift action beginning, wouldnt situation, 6 MONTHS ANYTHING chose freeeedom!"" half country retarded.

Since many cities India densely packed (even China), I’d imagine makes transmission whole lot easier. Nice Ah, yes, Dagestan. knew several hundred terrorist acts year-per-year basis (a fact completely airbrushed video) actually serious developmental consequences? Northern Ireland similar case once, still lags lot behind rest UK (or Ireland), 20 years fact. know sounds pretty insane it’s remember getting arguments, idiots demanding immediate ""proof"" Florida spike cases. next week people saying ""it's week, where's spike? LOL ISNT ONE YOURE WRONG!"".

These people taking Trump approach, boils to: ***Win today's news cycle. Worry tomorrow, tomorrow.*** Sounds like Bradford County lol That's Trump works. Shame, guilt, introspection : extinguished whatever horrific upbringing had. Man, they're going let thing get bad end actually significant demographic changes over. guys believe reports coming China? miracle get perfect, cheap, accessible vaccine next couple months, things could go back relatively normal. like virus caused structural problems society, stressed point reveal even casual observers. finally put hand fire learn hot, doubt ever able address underlying problems inequality access health care.

Just getting back status quo getting us back ""still kind bad."" worst pandemic anyone alive today ever experienced

According Wikipedia there's least 10 living people teenagers Spanish/Kansas flu. Guess *really* exciting weekend even bother?

Because lot people look government policy guidance matters. mask usage increases 5% “suggestion” it’s better 0% increase without it. Oxford vaccine development far already started production even b4 phase 3results announced. set October safe tot travel August 16? *You  Exactly . Hopefully saw wore mask anyway! Closing March reopening now, infection rate highest ever makes ZERO logical sense.

Then again, took single graduate course logic, probably beyond ability comprehend. hospitals overrun flu? Aren’t guys running people infect !? source showing bacterial secondary infection uniform among hospitalized patients? Otherwise, can’t see antibiotic would indicated unless signs bacterial infection. anything, haven’t seen much literature shows causes immunocompromised state opposite - causes strong immune response patients dying collateral damage lungs. 6 freaking counties near Houston? 86 icu beds? I'm sorry say gotta, screwed point frustrated tears. I'm worried bout flaring town outnumbers icu beds, total 40 fresh infections county. keep getting worse might weasing without nasal cannula watch neighbors left die hospital parking lot. military starting west point give impression sharpest tool shed expert badges make lite bit worse gotta gotta do. Plenty people still believe goes one way US health authorities spewing misinformation.  Wow amazing job, took 6 months, 130k dead almost 3million infected. mom (60) fractured relationship got covid infected son, husband I. firm belief hoax kept leaving house brought back us. Makes sense , flu virus needs bodies there’s bodies there’s flu. Probably saved hundreds thousands world flu. certainly lot many countries try prevent spread. I've gotta pretty huge dick buddy mean know science shit good lmao thinners

Wut Great..like black people enough shit deal with. :-/ lol imagine forced consummate running 40 degree fever think misunderstanding might end. onset early 3 days, general safety measures quarantine come contact potential case recommend 14-21 days. show symptoms 2-3 weeks, ok. Though, unless info backtracked, still asymptomatic carrier infectious others. One thing remember virus Novel, new. learning inner workings covid 19 ( possible mutations other, similar strains) speak. Yes, SARS-like virus; still know everything it. affecting people age groups differently, making difficult get hold treatment wise. Im sure might know, main killer covid itself, rampant damage organs via infections cytokine storms exhaustion placed immune system. new study seems come almost every day, replicated confirmed. findings usually added pool info first responders medical personnel know spectrum expect symptom severity wise. Dont use words dont meaning to. Makes sound silly. Virus looks thinks: Body, Life northeast OK. Well, OK, really. TX/MO/KS/AR different. Yah doubling factor covid fucked.. dont give fuck statement 'you' specific statement mentioned schools top universities...K-12 would indeed schools talking original comment.

Because wasnt talking 'that' comment CLEARLY laid comment replied to. least NBA bubble plan. leagues gonna operate usual, traveling letting players go wherever want saw team aspect politics coming like 15 years ago. Can't wait tomorrow ""go rob bank"" strawman. 
Your rant liberty illusion (and somehow throwing God) unsupported claim. 
""You're island"". conclusion statement liberty illusion, non sequitur. 

Nothing said disputed claim, burden proof justify infringing liberties. They're going put sick halfpipe there, employees continue extreme whilst break. Also couple varieties hepatitis viruses. well least admit pretty big factor know refers influenza, see reason think outcome going different different source pneumonia.

(As aside, also note interesting tidbit: 
""In years 1933 1957 nine influenza (H1N1) epidemics five influenza B epidemics. worst epidemics 1935–1936 influenza B epidemic resulted least 55,000 deaths. closely followed 1943–1944 influenza (H1N1) epidemic caused 53,000 deaths"")

Finally, paper suggest use antibiotics wise conclusion. b r u h Since post 6 hours ago almost hit 53,000 new cases today London, UK it’s way less 50% wearing masks US really needs high profile death COVID listen. actually went:

Me: ""It work nose.""
Them: Shrugs averted gazes
Me: (Walking away) ""It's like walking around dick hanging pants!""

I really pissed, I'm people like that. 🤬 think considering above, start referring ""known cases"" instead ""cases"". can't imagine many tens millions people actually spread to, tested. honestly believe lying thier accord? Also remember watching DOW 30 companies. Even investors start getting spooked companies go short term people look safer rocks hide under.

Many, all, companies either setup handle almost financial storm considered ""too big fail"" money printing government. that’s scientifically illiterate leaders danger us all. That's great hear! wearing cotton masks N95? Asinine.

A cute little word used explain person said foolish.

Except said wasnt.

What said truth. People willingly going without protective gear, becoming infected, infecting someone else, effectively killing damaging them. 

This KNOW happening due reports dumbasses partying bars beaches without protectove gear on.

These people willingly killing others. 

If argument this. better really fucking good. Cause essential workers would strong word you. Somebody said weeks. Drop Dead state (Nuevo Leon) 12 drive centers anyone (don't know local resident) go get tested.
Last time heard, need least 2 symptoms get done.
People also get tested different hospitals private laboratories.

All free.

Masks mandarory, get detained fined wearing one even driving. I’m almost crying people don’t feel good. I’m feeling well waiting results come in, empathize everyone deal virus. Oh nice!!! worried going pick Vegas hub city, actually gives way hope they’ll able pull since Canada actually taking thing seriously. best news I’ve heard day, seriously thank this! delusional think mass gatherings thousands... millions? people contribute prolonged pandemic feel smug. Looks like Thailand may also avoided original SARS researchers theories why. ... yeah, Europe Canada never open borders this... People states tired lockdown drove Arizona vacation. 

I'm Arizona native. make sense me. 

The summertime worst time come Arizona vacation... Come Spring Break something, month feel like melting. well Damascus, Oregon would unconstitutional Lone Superspreader yeah haha blown away said too. popular quick service (not fast food, 1.5 hour sit restaurant) upscale spot busy, heavily populated food culture part town. Grubhub, uber eats takeout huge hit em experienced anything since 2012. fairness, walked around without masks spread disease, fault citizens.

You need told fuck cheese-grater, need told wear mask pandemic. 0? Freedom fuck everyone selfishness, yay! don’t go University Alabama play school lied case numbers. people forget already? deserve Darwin award. mean holy shit... giving words power deserve. forget concentration camps! Airports closed tourists, thai citizens, people work permits married thai spouse thai children able come Thailand mandatory 14 days enforced quarantine. Im glad germany... dont want know scary bs must be. many citizens failing America See there. driving tomorrow evening. Freedumb seeing increase covid-related deaths? Reverse uno People countries consider human lives important daily routine.

We don't. pastor said California, ""When inside God’s house, safe home. God would never allow anything sinister harm us guests."" Couple days later, tested positive wife daughter. died wife daughter recovered. go away faster like this... cost deaths. would get tear gassed? Wearing body armor carrying weapon completely legal Michigan. dies quicker heat guys need go hard it. said assume virus would also die quickly cold? Atleast deadlines going numbers go up. ""I already made plans! reserved ventilator hospital next two weeks!"" Half million dead January bet agree. Millions millions people voted him. dont get mentality anyone symptoms socialises - really think authorities contact tracing? They're going find come contact with. Thailans bringing back limited number stranded citizens day long time already. Now, people work permits/children married thai spouse also able return.

All returnees spend 14 days mandatory quarantine repeatedly tested. cases quarantine virtually chance infect general populance. now, something like 1 month 0 community spread cases Thailand. start believe make America great again, goes wrong direction Jesus Christ, I’m glad part dumpster fire country. IKR, 3000 9/11 hell lot. mean still is, even comparable covid Thailans bringing back limited number stranded citizens day long time already. Now, people work permits/children married thai spouse also able return. 

All returnees spend 14 days mandatory quarantine repeatedly tested. cases quarantine virtually chance infect general populance. now, something like 1 month 0 community spread cases Thailand.  Yep. peoples dumbs enough find excuse go quarantine frustation.  That's Floyd death great opportunity assholes want go lot peoples street. point know mask necessary. social distancing all, everyone touching everything, mass peoples (just imagine numbers mid-symptom asymptomatic peoples ! That's crazy.)

That's exactly Usa deep shit (plus Florida Texas another obvious reasons)

As European looked with...i know express feelings good English word...sadness mixed rage maybe? Sad ignorant peoples dies nothing nerves see US falling apart dumbs peoples...

Covid-19 obvious reasons BLM happened 2020, case like Floyd happened every year. 2019? peoples go out, reasons playing heroes anything. blacks lives matters, stop protest. high blood pressure they're number #1 death list...that's stupid...or ironic know. Reported deaths. There's huge difference, openly corrupt states like Florida getting US almost certainly undercounted. reeally hope thise numbers dont happen. city practically back normal zero cases, hurts seeing shit going countries. disease shutting started affecting bottom line donor class, whole thing made political could get workers fight make money. big solar flare whiles electronics/data/internet. culture. many Americans see anything nurture society taking give others deserve it. see weakness. mindset ""I've got mine"" really popular.

Same reason universal health care free university. Yes, except USA even come close (in dreams) health care system Italy... Lol. Early pandemic boss called told met management team discuss covid response. told met conference room response was; ""are insane?"" Guess insanity continues. find USA sized glass dome? Amazon? eBay? forget Arizona, leading charge! mate braindead lmao Ah, yes. *logic* ""May be""? 'definitely are'. People dying, unconcerned folks spreading kills them. area gray zones. add disillusionment whenever anything medical handled appropriately anywhere world, ALWAYS backlash cries overreach fear mongering. 

The problem measures actually work, people get sick die. means certain part population feels measures overreach. way people's minds work. Charge reckless homicide whatever correct legal definition.. Apparently they'd rather triage required masks shutdown, pro life state less Facts evil. don’t forget, many schools going fully reopen fall almost restrictions place! no. imply symptom. saying good defence mechanism body would expel coronavirus. thus refrain suppressing sneezes? places yes, like city centers, lot people would use without buying anything. customer always free. Seems fair. Still, I'm fan McDonald's similar franchises. must admit McCafe amazing cheesecakes real whipped cream make pure cream house, least Slovakia. Heroes hardshell Holy crap. UK currently testing positive around +1000 times day thought terrible smaller population 

The USA reporting 50x cases despite 5x bigger (and less dense) population It’s getting worse they’ll start hit peak Trump possibly gone blame game starts. youth, protestors, anti-maskers.  next 2-4 months pointing fingers distracting election November. It’s almost perfectly designed. going fall trap? together. means - don’t get straight go together. Blame distraction point. wayyy beyond now. fight internet? wake up? footnote history. nobody’s everybody’s fault.  short time have? 130,000+ countrymen women ground thing, potentially many thousands join them, tens thousands going suffer it’s lingering effects including serious disabilities.


I’m glad apparently pulled fine that’s pretty blinkered selfish attitude you’ve got. Department Commerce place restrictions. free game Start triage limited resources wear n95 dentist appointment? would leave? boss part, sacrifice something? go part problem like rest. guy hamberders. Frankly, hope America point utterly draconian measures. far beyond 'ask nicely' part literally incurable, untreatable, deadly disease point.

I least bit surprised if, said done, death toll America millions, tens millions permanently disabled. trajectory leads. fault without doubt, could foreseen Chinese. entire virus thing coincidence - brilliant warfare China. need to. Stay hydrated rest. Oh, Lord, even craziest thing said day always third world country pretending 1st world country. Hollywood control narrative since everyone phone pocket. 
We seeing real America first time people realizing always illusion. Ya live Atlanta eight people know compared one person back April  sorry loss, wish mother survived this. 

Our white blood cells cannot kill virus virus kills white blood cells within, white blood cell tries take virus inside dissolve virus. makes white blood cells inefficient dissolving virus directly. 

So instead white blood cells start killing living tissue bodies (cytokine storm), killing virus located body indirectly killing cells bodies. Obviously humans need living tissue order live, sadly causes death, virus also, patient. 

There 100% consensus medical community this, nobody disagrees it. bloodcells cannot kill virus normally would, instead bloodcells break tissue patient. easily study here, people put lot effort gathering relevant articles publications Reddit. time help individual redditors search articles find helpful hope helped better understand body itself, order destroy virus. though. # Effects measures

What effect specific measures difficult determine, says Emma Frans. 

\- many countries closures, closed schools, wear mouthguards little bit everything possible. difficult know effect, says.

In Sweden, measures different effects different parts country, makes evaluations even complex, says Karin Tegmark Wisell. 

\- compare Skåne Stockholm, got different outcomes Swedish restrictions. Stockholm got wide spread infection, yes. infection also large Stockholm measures introduced. Skåne, hand, succeeded keeping spread infection lower level measures. 

**Sweden's strategy to** stop spread infection also includes assessment effects measures public health. 

\- Swedish perspective, believed ""lockdown"" adversely affect health ways. greater impact something society, higher risk affects public health. balance, says Emma Frans. 

However, conclusions drawn Sweden's measures already, says Emma Frans. 

\- say great deal certainty seems good keep schools open. seen large spread infection among children studies show even work school infected others. However, seems much difficult protect elderly thought. probably thought Sweden would easier it, since live generational housing large extent. seems much required protect elderly, says. 

## Comparisons countries

The now-appointed Corona Commission make several international comparisons crisis management. 

A real problem comparing different countries present figures based different grounds. number deaths covid-19 calculated differently different countries, number infected infected determined many tested.

But even future, difficult draw reasonable conclusions comparisons, many conditions country affect, says Emma Frans. 

\- Demographics, age distribution looked like coronary pandemic plays mortality. Northern parts Italy high middle age believe reason many countries Africa hit harder young population, says continues: 

\- Sickness population also factor. Maybe compare Sweden Norway example, differences great. look globally, absolutely believe affect hard disease strikes country.

**Karin Tegmark Wisell believes that** possible compare countries similar conditions, gain understanding effects measures. 

\- sometimes lifted Belgium, similar situation Sweden introduced ""lockdown"". consequences Sweden consequences Belgium short long term? finding good comparison countries, certainly gain increased understanding different parameters. measures effect elsewhere, right could done different countries would difficult draw certain conclusions about, says. 

## answers come?

The appointed commission given one year eight months evaluate Sweden's handling. work begin crisis still ongoing. something lawyer Mats Melin, appointed lead commission, highlighted Tuesday. 

""It hardly ruled happens later summer autumn home countries may shed new light things work commission,"" said press conference.

Karin Tegmark Wisell believes yet possible say possible know population society affected. 

\- difficult answer know long live covid-19. know long immunity lasts get vaccine. also affects consequences society, says, continues: 

\- go many years, make evaluations well.

Emma Frans believes complete fact, clear picture strategy best protected population, difficult develop. 

\- gain greater understanding impact pandemic measures. something complete difficult. may ask fact means. Much answered, certainly everything, says. 

(end article) that’s genuinely evil thing say good weirdos thinking death sentence

Ask +130K dead people, relatives/friends. difference small, even consider separate strains. see countries like Czechia scrapping mandatory face masks think still nice room fuck again. [Have seen map ECDC  


It shows number new cases past two weeks. explain Sweden dark red rest Europe bright yellow? ... even though Sweden still testing less lot countries. absurdly many new cases managed contain virus? spike real. mean, real cases, reporting artifact. Quebec changed reporting last week. 668 day last days Quebec results coming once. Comments like Reddit useful. Thank Cover cough elbow public (at home well unless live alone) even wearing mask, considered getting tested reason believe might Covid (or want know ) buy counter medication relieve symptoms. guess tracing, what’s point testing? might well assume every symptomatic sick person virus treat accordingly.  Deaths lag weeks, whoever dying today catch today Lot good options coming pike. moment, new 2020 Covid full attention, going start thinking cars. understandable think economy would ruined anyway. virus allowed get control destroyed economy. 

If quarantine severe sooner, could saved everything, lives economy. 

As was, saved time hospitals figure heck saved lives. get virus control economy screwed even re-open America discovering right now. rate, month, 1 million case per day, number Karen Joe call hoax family affected well. age? absolutely ridiculous there's believe large groups people contribute virus spread. Would also nice 10s thousand protest spread Covid Russia atleast tests lot per capita. Guess read anything else said including rest sentence.
I sure New York City hardest hit. like hardest hit flu. would hardest hit everything possible would hardest hit absolutely nothing. heavily densely populated city entire country forced everyone confine together almost hours day due lockdown highest infections deaths? shocking. wait. Tesla particularly inexcusable behavior. far car companies go, money produce millions fewer units per year. yet feel treat workers way? We're boat unless wealthy best row others situation. wait car keep rowing help others. young grandchildren take seriously many grown-ups. Perú fucked months now. Government done shit stop this, people poor stay home; government aid never arrived stolen (shocker) never fucking addressed this, president would literally ask people please stay home like word please would bring food peoples table. Quarantine month long people started working (in super crowded spaces obviously). 100 days quarantine ended straining economy forcing government reopen far ready...  thought well. poor kids teachers. Rather six weeks plan truly effective remote learning environment, let's go back school weeks, get hundreds kids back together masks optional minimal social distancing, see spike child cases, shut back down, scramble throw together online plan like last year. Shit bitcoin price Déjà vu I'm really thinking Oxford's gonna one

:) get tested area? could anxiety infection, hard say without test. Try take extra precautions around people, close contact consider letting know feeling 100%. Probably stop performing front [massive We're living inside episode South Park lmao. seems like people getting COVID-19 get days. Spread Corona world - Graphical Normal running average weird. ever been? like 2-400 cases per day

Be careful Canadian aggregates. Quebec changed reporting last week. think report weekly now? That's numbers low days spiked one day only. Well Trump said personal Vietnam avoiding STDs.

Guess know ""won"" war now... Could anxiety news almost sad Mongolian navy absolutely could issue deaths spike next weeks infection rate spiking. Even expect surpass specifically catastrophic areas like ny/nj early italy numbers. comorbidity awareness lower population *should* make impossible get bad elsewhere. hey 2020 knows. Even gets even close hotspots massive leadership failure inexcusable loss life. problem biological warfare indirect retaliation USA would look like almost unjustified aggression. hard situation, one thing certain: China hurt USA much.  Yet crowd 'just wait two weeks' idiots seem disappeared since then. tough game forced play one wins. Let natural selection take place... fun games till someones mum died... blame government enough really matter since majority voting population access said education. agree cars nice point. point is, outline, behavior me, knowledge really Tesla. Tesla does. stunts pulled disabling features used cars new owner pay them...well, that's call Elon. want Eloned. paid profit insurance companies. decent societies healthcare systems situation like go massively budgets gov signs check public health. fewer cases test reopen 'conomy get favourable tweet Cheeto. *\*Ron Howard voice\** Also ceiling supported talents coming world attracted American dream.

This attractiveness damaged significantly since Trump there's guarantee recover. virus basically shows even warnings new laws requiring wearing masks staying home (no matter country in), Darwinism win. I'm also North Georgia. Publix worst people wearing masks here. actually started going Walmart one people wearing masks socially distance. Totally bizarre expect beginning pandemic. Yes course one poor america 14-15% positive rate bad news looks like percentage increasing. cases growing faster testing capacity. Ah yes “e” favorite nUmBeR Man look Nigeria, #186 672 tests per million (0.34% tested). knew since opened airports repatriate citizens, got 30 cases 120 passenger flight Nigeria, Nigeria barely cases time Pshaw, surely not! think Mrs Abbott? fall empire lol  Take pepperoni, friend. fully expect planning accordingly. number 7 ""It's going summer""

- Trump agree commend walking away investment.  didnt say testing... definitely huge factor. people operate polar ends spectrum now? One worst things becomes neverending, whereas everyone decent like starting regain privileges. city practically back normal zero cases

Vs city back normal HAHAHA! can't orgy home family? According Spanish antibody study extremely rare people 18 die virus, infants even safer, almost deaths age category known illnesses, healthy infants lowest risk people world even get infected tend asymptomatic. Take care best family. 261 cases 27 deaths today.

There go. again, US states least large Germany. TV shows give public extremely warped perception survivable lot things are. could resigned age needs retirement benefits tried best within confines Trump administration. Slovakia: bars pubs open, masks still mandatory inside (incl public transport) outside, wellness open, gyms think open, primary schools open, people returning offices. could millions dead people still denial. I’m continuing amazed ignorance. say please wear mask, please aware people’s six feet perimeter, always wash hands. people can’t mystery me. fatalities keeping pace? No. They’re trending down. Hospital critical care high capacity places all. fascination “cases” media needs stop. It’s stupid. cases spiking tests society catching virus building immunity it, that’s bad news.  mean, live cny, nobody wears masks anymore. Half people know still think it’s fake. child city day got tested positive cussing 8 go quarantine. ones here, many aren’t tested? Potus calling covid19 hoax 

That’s leadership? Oh yes, hoping find situation New Zealand knew posted somewhere thread. Imagine chaos people really informed potential danger?  It’s optimism. It’s myopia. He’s saying, “it isn’t raining near me. must raining anywhere.” Exactly unique America. Almost every country data shows gap excess mortality covid deaths. massively reporting. Texas said yesterday limping antibody tests positive swabs. many states every test treated new case wildly inflates numbers. 

Start watching daily recovery numbers Florida Texas. huge daily jumps beginning fall daily. worry Donald's got covered saying he's angry China let's go bois infection go point Imagine lying ICU bed feeling like might actually die nothing think got sick see Vanilla fucking Ice. think 49th going pride point, either way. There's single country planet reporting pure transparency, promise that. Whether via ignorance intentionally obfuscating numbers down. think otherwise naive person understand fundamental purpose government ensure stability maintained bad made look bad. That's job. saying boned 2 weeks ? use trumps words “shithole country” Um, 4.9k record breaking daily deaths, confused title Stating obvious US public getting boring now. One districts scheduled start July 29. It’s going train wreck. people travel them, go beach. Great news. People live Memphis. canceled city many neighboring cities state. They’re also illegal I’m people light anyways. girlfriend Gatlinburg now, Virginia, one wearing mask, one social distancing, one seems act though anything worry now. crazy. REALLY GUYS!? It’s droplet size dispersion air. 

As source control, masks effective they’re worn tightly face fibers fabric trap larger droplets prevent evaporating turning smaller ones, travel farther air. 

When wear mask protect yourself, you’re farther away source smaller evaporated droplets/aerosols suspended air go around gaps weave fabric ease, eventually reaching mouth nose. got much shit setting “!””RemindMe” things. hey, know.... spiking case rate, impending health care collapse (at least Texas) refusal wear masks top 'COVID' parties helping case. multiple organizations saying wear mask (hell plenty resources make t-shirts), people still aren't. click 7day moving average, trend easier see. Apr 13 may 31 trended down. steeply, down. saw steep climb doesn’t correspond mobility data. Georgia steadily climbing since Apr 6 guys fucked there. Stay safe peeps Depending live. use Buckley. weeks ago, hospital work explained always double tested 20 30 percent inaccurate. Two tests still guarentee 90 95 percent patients yet. medicine things usually taken third standard deviation 99.X percent success guarenteed still millions people insane unreliable tests are. stock market hits time high. nobody working planes air boats sea. Millions businesses closed US politics laughing stock planet. oil goes up. Assumed covid 25% yet even huge cohort assumed cause death still add total excess mortality.

So I'd actually causing excess deaths covid? America secret epidemic nowhere else earth does? Yes disappear ...... leaving stacks dead Americans wake. took long Roll Tide. Oh silly, need that, protesting nation's greatest treasures: hunks rock carved slaveholders lost Civil War guys, flattened curve! it’s thanks /u/vulpix-rawr ‘s anecdote! Exactly deaths reported today people sick weeks. It’s amazing many people still don’t understand fucking July. Look us. #1 everything! Go USA!! Good Florida, I’m team virus state. Celebrate freedom!!!! much remdesivir cost develop, much private costs incurred\*. Well, let's see... *fucking homeless*, know you, keep stove kitchen, is, turn, located ***in fucking home***. Google boofing squee. find enraging.  new study suggests Sars-CoV-2, virus causes may able directly infect heart cells patient disease.  study, yet peer-reviewed, published online journal Cell Reports Medicine June 18 sheds light many Covid-19 patients suffer cardiac complications arrhythmia, heart failure viral myocarditis, even without underlying heart problems.  recent autopsy study showed DNA testing revealed presence RNA strains Sars-Cov-2 heart. risks performing invasive procedure living patient obtain heart muscle samples – gold standard reaching conclusion – high, scientists said.  researchers, Cedars-Sinai Smidt Heart Institute, heart hospital California, decided test lab-cultured heart muscle cells using stem cell technology establish cells could directly infected novel coronavirus.  results showed coronavirus able enter cells cultured lab dishes, change gene expressions multiply. cells also stopped beating 72 hours infection.  also found treatment ACE2 antibody – human enzyme virus uses enter body – able blunt viral replication cell-derived heart cells, suggesting ACE2 receptor could used Sars-CoV-2 enter human heart muscle cells.  uncovered stem cell-derived heart cells susceptible infection novel coronavirus, virus also quickly divide within heart muscle cells,” said Arun Sharma, research fellow Cedars-Sinai Board Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute first author study, article published website Medical Express.  significant, infected heart cells showed changes ability beat 72 hours infection.”  may differences infecting cells lab actual human bodies, findings help bridge important information gap heart complications Covid-19 patients. cardiac injury associated increased risks death disease, causes injuries unclear.  editorial published Journal American Medical Association Network – two studies Wuhan doctors showing higher mortality rate Covid-19 patients suffering myocardial injury – said researchers looked various possibilities complications, including inflammation, called research look possibility direct infection Sars-CoV-2.  viral infection myocardium another possible causal pathway myocardial damage one requires investigation …” wrote.  well-documented case acute myocarditis following Covid-19-associated respiratory infection 53-year-old Italian woman previous heart disease … supports hypothesis.”**  could result massive inflammation response virus, data suggest heart could also directly affected virus Covid-19,” co-author California study Clive Svendsen, director Regenerative Medicine Institute professor Biomedical Sciences Medicine, quoted saying Medical Express article.

Wat Funny story. One butt chuggers supreme court justice. close borders? nean, probably help mexico US lmao. Better late never, guess. first started mad pressure chest couldn’t breath like two weeks. never got tested that’s test available except really sick. got anxiety medicine though it’s helped calm nerves start freaking out. Popping say born US mental illness. easily curable mental illness nonetheless first come first serve basis though? MANY QUESTIONS! that's 25 taco! effectively pointing excess deaths suggesting virus killed even people official data shows, fail see manage jump conclusion somehow denying virus deadly?

Also, think understand looking excess deaths standard way deadliness diseases estimated epidemiology, ""let's try count every case exactly tests"" approach new unproven. President Trump continues fall leadership pandemic. Mask enforcement isn’t fun extrajudicial murder, guess. Indian here. tell India one countries took strong proactive measures stop spread, ""flatten curve"". course hard control billions people here, 'barrier' that's set going porous.

There strict lockdowns country national infection count 10000 (April). People government extra careful near-paranoid. approach appropriate us, India cannot afford outbreak facilities can't support million sick people. best shot would stop never let spread first place.

But efforts clearly took toll everything economy people's morale. Daily wage earners struggled without means make living.

As cases kept rising steadily, became evident stopping pandemic. everyone stay put home indefinitely sustainable solution either.

The country began opening led infections. worldometer site, India still showing exponential growth. going get worse.

Tl;dr nothing suspicious India's numbers. country best prevent pandemic. succeeded delaying it. Covid almost inevitable country like India. countries past peak, we're late party. everyone masked reasonably safe, heard couple reports infections planes super-spreader events, frankly fewer reports infections expected, airflow planes uni-directionally circulated (for important enclosed spaces, check hope whoever said isn’t charge anything major /s Correct, everyone able wear mask be. coconut loaded african swallows Key winning..

1. covid already
2. next day early morning test scheduled already
3. Go party
4. Profit?  fake news them. Sometimes see someone reddit getting super pissy rights give fuck people, kind want engage. notice post history figure I'd easier time getting dog understand pandemic would change minds 

Does though? blood stool semen?? no, today, since tomorrow/Friday free 4th July mobility trends Pennsylvania. (Type state’s name) Pennsylvania steadily opening since Apr 6.

I see state’s dashboard, daily cases fell mid July, started go up. Compare two graphs. correlation mobility leader cares us  got covid though? kind infectious... Split pot? Yeah, easy enjoy product know people making basically beaten like dogs. USA number one wooooh!!! Spanish Death Song Spanish flu almost perfect. Judt words changes cofona. Yes, countries mass incarceration systems love overcharging throwing people jail? Oh wait, US one far country countries handle better far less draconian systems. part first player test positive joked day touched mics press conference big part NZ isolated small island country population 4 million Trump isn‘t issue, albeit massive one. Local politicians are. always always be.  mean, Canadian, it’s scary. Especially border ever opens Trump’s WH pandemic over. spike didn’t happen Re-opening, 

Desperate spin, definitely grand reopening caused spike. Remember Drump posed rapid test machine speech?

Where those?

Where 15 minute tests using UAE? take 12 days get results went get tested? lot people US think contact tracing going used bullshit tracking containing virus. like many people think vaccine going contain rfid chip shit. People freaking tracing thing got updated people's phones, know actually download app order tracing work. I'm really done country. I'm scared leave house like maybe 1 day week. Raised price already due expected lack funding based fucked state budget be. Wss like $20 credit hour increase. I'm Texas know covid, presumed positive doctor phone, can't get test. can't found, even doctor. makes think, many people there, like me?

These numbers much, much worse. demographics rise new positive tests different initial wave Northeast. Average age much lower. mean much lower death rate. Thanks potential nightmares. 

/I'm kidding, planning drink sleep anyways. Nice! I'm considering declining invitation brothers August wedding AZ. Found boot. states started go back close restaurants / businesses again, far I've seen, one put stay home orders back place. Maybe matter time? Idk. Ronald Mcdonald instead Donald! clear path must take now. Dewine said supports Dayton mayor Nan Whaley's mask mandate. F rescind mask mandate? ordered masks 24 hours later flip flopped said realized offended Ohioans.

Gretchen, Nan, Dr. Amy... women leaders. Shaking head you, Spineless Dewine. Remember pope slapped woman? Right?! It’s clear indoor activities without masks beyond risky. know it’s hot Houston lot restaurants patios brainer. need wait long. 

Local transmission almost eliminated spiked Victoria. 

Most Australian states ready lift restrictions within borders. one new case every 3-4 days new cases all. Even NSW looking like would eliminate locally acquired transmission following weeks. worst NSW would continue 0-6 new cases day.

At time (early May) Victoria look ready lift restrictions. all. article calls wavelet I'd liken earthquake aftershock. Victoria aftershock time yet Victoria still lifted restrictions.

However, seem first stage easing led current spike.

 [The Guardian you’re clueless, guy think rise started would around 2.5.

The problem common becomes less likely people seek testing.

""I know it, know there's treatment mild cases confirmation isnt important"" attitudes become normal already isolation occuring. Oh wait, way states continue act ain’t seen nothin yet unfortunately remember China reporting 1,200 cases day nearly getting heart attack. 1,200 cases normal. ... Trump always WIN! Canada considerably smaller population, yes absolutely insane beyond terrifying. almost looks like US trying herd immunity. used live SD back always seemed like packed 4th was. county open think gonna bad. completely full shit /u/Nachofriendguy864 . pulled data straight CDC put quick chart excel.

The blue line Influenza Pneumonia deaths (the CDC reports together), red line COVID deaths. first COVID deaths reported around end March.

I SUMmed deaths periods claimed state found wildly different results. anomaly pneumonia would love see finding numbers. Non-American here. third-world country yet pity USA hear &amp; read. best epidemiologists, best doctors, best health facilities, maybe most-ready infrastructure world address this. Yet kind shit happens. Yes, tiny heart attack. really felt like it. grammar proper wording important. Hey must broke af Fuck sideways call Nancy Nice. Pokemon go bonuses healthy america people rural pa actively shaming wear masks stores. it’s fucked up. anti-intellectualism strong one. good thing* 🤯 wearin yer mask, that’s doublin’! 

Standin close folks, *that’s* doublin’! 

Doublin’ new COVID cases....oooh better believe that’s doublin’ teacher tested students, would accurate number proficient, correct? first five failed, rest passed, accurate assessment class. It’s quite simple. thought make america great mission accomplished? keep america great now? Good thing rate passengers 👍

Problem eventually solved overtime. Lol, wut? commenting topic? Or, least, reading it? fucking hate man everything stands for. hope he’s hung traitor yet another bullet ever growing list crimes America. “Will be”? 600 people Mexico died today (that would like 2,000 US). Similar story across central South America. Mexico, Peru, Brazil others going fly past USA deaths per capita couple weeks. actually don’t understand isn’t getting attention (except media corrupt useless), it’s bad European peaks earlier year. Damn, remember Italy hit 31k cases overall seemed like insane number. hitting nearly twice one day. Unbelievable. That’s grim... wonder true numbers higher 1 every second. odds survives election? say gets cold could magically go away! Poof! Ricky Bobby. Thanks! corrected Source? People weak ass diaphragms amirite? It’s genuinely boggling mind badly country fucking right  I'm California. one yells anyone wearing mask. Shut heard Mongolia send 30k sheep China PPE.

PS: joking 30K sheep. Guess takes time new methods trickle average clinic testing center. Thats approx 1 virus case every 1.72 seconds! knew going happen soon lockdowns started ending prematurely- never forget chose path. noticed worldometers, Deaths number trails New Case number 12 days..., looking forward July 13th. Oh put orders back? (Stay home order) Wtf? Wasn’t pools tv shit. guy shit kid still is. Fucking one hit wonder un-relevant publicity stunt bad chin-strap havin douche bag lookin ass!  like theory. Let's many tests days normally done month. goal find asymptomatic carriers. Intriguing concept first time certainly last time unfortunately lot people clearly understand exponential growth. think administration go lower, sucker punch ya. Lmao I've wondering people hiding. used make comments cases. proven wrong cases spiking, saying deaths.  late april 4/19 first spike, testing prisons. remove dates, highest ever single day. saying would take 6-8 weeks detect spike back beginning May screamed “two weeks” me.

The spread broad right expect lot young people get older people sick cause increases death rate late August.

All people basic measure prolonging destroying economy country. won’t forget over. someone works COVID unit, I’m truly afraid would end happening situation like this, coworkers. truly don’t know plan would be. unlikely we’d see complete collapse. problems disappear ignore them, fester grow 👹 problem working within system. problem, system is. message CLEARLY toned WH pressers, versus he’d speak freely. message old, people still choosing repeat care. use excuse assume isnt trustworthy. one breath use “lie” reason say he’s always lying, even admitting lie (therefore wearing masks truth), simply say nothing true. don’t want hear it, him, party. science. Science moves changes know more. people pissed CDC said surfaces less transmission threat believed that’s also “lie” dont trust them. scientists doctors agenda. willful, intention, blatant ignorance rooted hate side, genuinely confused. leader leading path. they’re choosing follow. Fauci’s fault. people don’t like facts data science. agree. ball pit blast. get many stories new rapid tests... nothing except we're still original PCR test. I've never understood immunology well. Suppose get it, antibodies persist 3 months that, right? memory cells bit longer that? need cleared COVID go around COVID+ people inhale virus time time body regenerate stores, right?

It's like lasts 1 year time 1st infection day lose immunity...it'd keep getting extended time come contact virus, even get sick unfathomable saddening. really hope better set north. Everyone deserves good health. 

50% enough everyone catch know least one close person it. That's insane think about. one frequented /r/covid19positive choice. felt pretty darn safe though.  Ifr 0,6-1,6. Death reporting data takes months, year accurate. Fifty layers bureaucracy thousand different hospital medical reporting systems makes everything slow. look total combined March 2020 death numbers now, look month year, counts different. Nice see Reverend Kane back Side recruiting souls. Say hi Cohaagen seems seriously control. Yupe. Worldmeter website, noticed deaths number trails new cases number 12-14 days. July 13th - 15th would bad day us US. Honestly, I'd willing gamble take now. **THIS**

From evolutionary standpoint virus adapting kill host making easier spread. Viruses symbiotic, host dies dies. adapting less lethal contagious strain. options isnt worst one. trending steady lately majority deaths 2k coming NY, PA, NJ, MA, MI, etc. states shut successfully contained virus. result, daily deaths dwindled states. CA also reporting higher deaths previously, successfully locked while. reopened somewhat, deaths likely rise again.

Younger people getting infected improvement treatment strategies may effect. takes weeks new case turn death. plenty people hospital month time. Furthermore, there's delay reporting deaths actually see counts. Texas, delay deaths behind. may see many deaths resulting cases added today month two.

But even taking account, Texas Florida clearly under-diagnosing many deaths pneumonia instead COVID19, pneumonia numbers way historical average. deflate death numbers.

Check back month unfortunately likely see deaths resulted huge increase cases. That's bad idea actually. still worry ton small businesses right struggling employees want return work half make unemployment. Plus government can't afford keep stuff I've given ""government debt"" argument long time ago. last 3 presidents decided throw fiscal responsibility window terms debt. feel like Ferrell's character Zoolander (""am taking crazy pills?"") - holy crap, apocalyptic, yet millions people refusing even acknowledge threat, media focused stories now, even though stock market today, recorded record quarter growth.

This front page news, yet general population care want think it. Feels like USA going die denial... Pretty variable Union/Snyder county. I'd say 80% people wearing masks grocery store, 50% local feed store, one else fireworks store. expect rural PA. I'm extremely wary fresh anything right now. Hence boxed food. bad idea, though, general. Again: enforce this? Answer: cannot real world.

These edicts legal grey-area, maybe even black localities. 'black' term means actively illegal local laws. FUCK THIS!

With numbers ""cases"" going ...at fucking point let heard immunity take course quit bullshitery....serious...why wear fucking mask population already infected

Its ""I care people"" thing...if go see fucking grandma nursing home...hospital. ect...i issue caring health others.....but I'm trying live God damn life american...the idea policies getting implemented  pisses off...i apologize cause I'm monster here. . people ""authority"" implementing Jerk reaction policies ""benefit"" super super minority making majority trying live normal lives, add extra bs uncomfortable aspect it...dumb shit...idgaf scared Karens want say me.  Feel free hit need somebody cut chicken tenders you. Well, reflects poorly lockdown policies US massively disrupted people’s lives great cost barely get anything return. sacrificed freedom safety ended losing anyway. 

Also state governments ones mandated lockdown. can’t provide stimulus money broke. Unfortunately, president's response brush rug. said hopes disappears. going to. everyone could see New England North East done follow, we'd much better off, doubt happen. Nice Florida lost cause hopes people would slowly come around climate issue could work solutions. chance.

I lost hope Bush Jr successfully turned wedge issue half population stopped believing over-night. remember controversial. Lucky. :) think does, similar still species away. Countries enough supervisors supervise quarantined people. That's New Zealand got latest outbreak, couple people fly funeral, left quarantine since supervision What. Is. Going. On.  parents tired kids home. really need realize special snowflakes everyone struggling order stay alive/healthy. infuriating. live Long Island. tell everyone wears mask stores. wear masks parties BBQs homes. So, believe see upward trend numbers end July beginning August.  Fourth July weekend come  That's always been. Get fired? unemployment. Quit work willingly? Also unemployment. specifically laid able take advantage it. Time everyone stop wearing seatbelts pants. police problem enforcing laws. mean""to looks...""? basing unreliable testing death reporting scientific basis? Like Diablo ? 

Hopefully isn’t 5 Acts expansion.. CDC said number infections least 10x number confirmed cases based antibody testing. accuracy never been. metric deaths. Husband co-worker went work positive. coworkers spouse positive sick bed. 

She said know suppose go work, one told supposed informed Covid.

I think hit nail head! media coverage, maybe someone could write article internet? think could something TV?

Note: live Houston, Texas. Well that’s bit shit. brother couldn’t find job pre-lockdown he’s well truly screwed. (Apparently there’s much English degree...) girlfriend supposed go Aunt’s Fourth July weekend, we’re really doubting plan now. family already there. got tested beginning week thinking results would back now, they’re delayed.

It’s frustrating family assumed things would back normal now, getting worse. may shocking people one toilet. ""This obviously wanted July...""

Ok state take anywhere exactly are? steps citizens take protect susceptible? 

The things done working. Hundreds thousands lives economy saved stop dicking around. Geez company high level person full conversation coworkers kid popped screen went away use bathroom. could care less said expected managers flexible given we’re GLOBAL PANDEMIC. within days, stopping it. narrative around reported consequence reopening instead

So facts “narrative” now? exactly avoid pandemic, eh? rest civilized world valued life economy, country reverse, also think country besides maybe Brazil, mandate masks federal level, well deny science facts, shit serious would laughable badly government fucked 🎶It's endemic afterall 🎶 stayed home. myself. Yes young kid. . . say near certainty NFL probably thinks important cancel unless specifically told to. even then, they'd probably move games state give shit. saw two Seattle PD officers without masks fast food chain yesterday. Also saw three officers dealing distrubtive person outside Starbucks, masks around necks wrists. cause families getting labor free. It’s could better depending expensive daycare is.  Good thing debilitating health impacts felt survive. I'm going go bomb shelter god-given right stay house! Bombs FAKE NEWS liberal conspiracy!  science suggesting. Good news right? neighbor July 4th party 3rd? 3rd national fried clam day. I’m confused. Rich people stay home. go work. can’t stay home we’re wealthy privileged. Thats I’ve saying whole time?!? wealthy people touch normal people like family think everyone stay home. Something clearly wrong you. Also - don’t deal people stoop swearing name calling. Blocked. fact he's saying they're going report 1000 cases tomorrow *right before* July 4th weekend horrifying. Oh trump voters dying. Oh no! Sorprendente che questo AMA non sia stato assediato dai tuoi iscritti wouldn’t say one  would actually 9.3 million. 5.3 million would get final day. Dana white looks like genius lmao What? understand trying say scary thing dont know single person tested yet except one family needed get tested grandma (lives home) passed covid... negative nurse positive. 

meaning... know bad extent delayed expression symptoms really making virus insanely unpredictable. even extent testing... think numbers vastly delayed probably 3x spread official numbers (that take time results) showing.

shooting 10k day means ton people 10k (new infections) likely already spread people already care flattening curve getting economy going favor mask-wearing. honestly compromise want lock-down partial lock-downs.

Personally, I'd like mandatory masks certain settings, also 75% capacity caps certain establishments; mask requirements good enough me. texas, yeah expect go well residents real. exemption polling places? many people going make statement there, wonder?

Churches religious places? I’m sorry, impedes religious freedom wear mask you’re worshipping?

I wonder many people suddenly “disability”.

I don’t think change much anything. mean, know why. allowed discuss sub ""He also said thinks growing number cases Florida brought control planned [CENSORED] [EVENT] Jacksonville next month.""

pretty funny.

Lol automod gettin quoting article trials, jailed could hear exact sound head reading that.

Well done Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* ""I believe that"".

This US wound screwed, nutshell. Everywhere earth people like this, seem think get pick choose facts they'll believe. Somehow seems US managed cultivate much larger collection anywhere else though. “He knows me”
Could stopped right there, made look stupid. Ah well, what’s new.  Bold assume mind first place. might looking another study, one showed twice many people recovered Cells compared produced antibodies. I’ve super lucky support system (I mental health problems anyway) see would drive people edge. That's difference scientist politician. Scientists often prove wrong and/or change mind based new information.

Politicians appear like right time, even know not. simple. wear mask public, worthless piece shit go jail. 

If US broadcast message across media every hour hour, would compliance would able start returning normal.  unclear. 'Area' strictly defined opinion, though case bearing passport law. 

Certainly Louisiana Texas tried argue constitutionality state closing border another state (Texas closing border 1900 case) however supreme court rule specific issue. Dude gets taking points /r/Coronavirus others, singing Jesus statue lines enter hospitals becomes less numbers game humanitarian disaster. sure trying fool anyone themselves. talk herd immunity sub seems like people tend forget get reproductive number right people population gaining immunity. almost nothing black white. SHIT SHERLOCK attending church,

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* You’ve still addressed comment, “god knows many people” taking risk also- big think dads social bubble realistically is? makes sense, deaths lag behind cases 2 weeks seeing increase deaths now. ""they're taking jobs americans want do"" people saying catch virus multiple times? 

Right evidence this. ZERO documented cases reinfection far. know least short-term immunity continually test population successfully confirm virus completely eradicated/immunity achieved 

You're confused goal is. minimizing deaths absolutely one goals, primary goals lockdowns prevent hospitals collapsing. do, lot people covid patients would generally agree Americans going willingly comply coming ""quarantine"" go back it? 

If Americans want quarantine, need start wearing masks reliably high rates compliance. Countries go back lockdown keeps infection rate levels hospital systems manage. continue reject masks periodic lockdowns hospitals fail imagine vaccine around within next 1.5-2 years minimum - bet effectiveness really low. 

Both statements show understand pretty much anything disease unprecedented scientific effort thrown right suppose treatment probably best case scenario like 6 months there's really talk successful treatments. 

Again, clearly ignorant progress made far. actually several promising drugs treatment protocols evolved last six months. Even knowing avoid putting people vents point looking like hypocrites stopping mask wearing would sudden stop caring infecting others around amount bacteria?

Oh fuck off. too. sell fleas Amazon, flea markets? Fuck Flor I? Uh? Duh? good news sure, overrun hospitals still unacceptable percentage One coworkers attended wedding sick family members Texas. spread almost staff (small business). everyone stuck home work piles one person hospitalized. Also wife spread virus several kids cares for, spread parents. Probably least 100 people sick wedding, odds least one person die others experience long term health consequences. Historically, thought evolution virulence necessarily trade transmissibility. know much complicated that, still decent rule thumb evolutionary changes resulting higher transmissibility also result higher virulence. one explanation diseases evolve toward avirulence.

Their deaths dropped almost nothing. Also, whole ""immunity may last 3-4 months"" thing panic porn, pure simple. 
The fact matter this: Mexico &amp; US' runaway cases, reach herd immunity. Authors updated study reflect think would plenty left blow fancy coffees avocado toast. /s US population: 328 million

I think personally related increases disease China. Obviously many factors, vegetarian diet daily exercise tends better health. Last thing China needs population obese diabetics accompany high pollution related cancer rates.

Given greenhouse connection meat production (and somehow also linked deforestation rainforest????), IMO it'd great time world start considering implementing limits meat production. 

Nah, popular meat eaters. Habits change. better world. suspect shortly we'll see world implementing lots global limits help constrain large population's impact climate changes. 

The US great example bad habits refusing change. back global efforts toward progress (in name desire eternal unconstrained growth), think we'll lose clout global power. People stop respectful stop listening reason. That's cases deaths. I'll concerned 50k deaths per day.

The majority people near using masks think flu made-up conspiracy harm trump specifically, care protecting them. wish! Italian healthcare system light years ahead US. Plus locked *properly* months ago, ie one family member allowed week food medicine. Even though they're months ahead, things slowly starting open again, they're still way cautious, literally *everyone* still wears masks. mean [fall intention narrowly define ""evidence"" make technically true statement. brought EBP wanted show brought support position.

Let us go practical example. Afaik lot drugs experimentally given early days covid-19 due doctors better information. think controversial say every single drug given somebody's opinion based somebody's clinical expertise (whichever doctor decided administer drug least) work?

Is fair say ""we evidence"" every single one drugs work? really think that's word ""evidence"" used even colloquially.

.

It indeed position expert's **unsubstantiated** view intrinsically little merit.

I must make distinction clear. say brother relays family doctor's advice me, trust advice comes doctor brother. Similarly, doctor recommends treatment based results clinical trial, trust treatment comes trial, doctor telling so.

My point this. expert's view backed evidence, view merit; however merit comes evidence well perhaps expert's ability interpret evidence (in words, intrinsic view). case expert secondary source. expert's view primary source (as view derived evidence), basically without merit.

It fine quote expert heuristic. Perhaps experts likely facts backing claims; perhaps less likely misunderstand studies; perhaps know whole lot top head. That's good. However one actually interesting digging even slightly surface, expert's view best secondary source, worst appeal authority.

.

Finally idea name-calling referring relevant. referring calling somebody thick skulled? study came couple weeks ago said treating sick patients antibody plasma make statistically significant difference preventing deaths. think problem like antivirals, antibodies help body fight infection, time someone sick, virus killing them, body's reaction it. house already flooded, turning tap probably enough stop floors collapsing.

Antibodies may helpful earlier disease course, seen RCT work better late treatment, problem (again like antivirals) early disease course hard tell going end sicker need treatment. enough treat everyone, antibodies need IV infusion means recipient need already hospital. Hoping see studies problems. asked loaded question predicated intentional misunderstanding. stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. 

In addition, told multiple lies. properly respond entire comment, including parts expose falsehoods move on.  good actual accurate idea. Especially people going base behaviour result. false negative serious thing indeed. Texas jumped 1,000 yesterday. Today 8075, yesterday 6975.

Additionally, taking pandemic seriously could interpreted denial-based behavior driven fear serious pandemic actually is.

Don't get hopes up, still people taking seriously NOW. nation's best brightest

Edit: meant worst dimmest. According CDC website positive antibody test could also mean you’ve common cold. True story checked site last night. 

So mean? fair, also sit Beijing say trump fat racist dumbass disappear next day either. Zero enforcement though, reality. He’s idiot. virus planet long do. still long died. pull number rear Austin, Texas 40% tests today come back positive reason Mexico. missed vanilla ice Anything says divert room. agree China better control US, response better. think people’s frustrations come way handled outbreak far communication rest world. hid crucial info could helped prepare world try save ass government officials twitter spreading propaganda US actually started it, blah blah blah. agree numbers probably aren’t far off, it’s reasonable trust them. Oh hospitals absolutely overwhelmed wuhan it’s hard imagine cases resulting fair, Trump say would get sick winning. CA various counties stated won’t enforce this. plan sacrifice people government needs upfront open that, ensure people going die understand that. plan, failed communicate.

However, also making noises voluntary measures protecting vulnerable populations (because lives valuable?l, plan all. failed that, too. numbers. country many loud fully delusional idiots personally makes lot sense me. ages human virus significant mutation Wuhan. would also mean looking actual source virus would lot harder.

How earth european countries detecting 'cases' December November samples, much closer regions Asia werent severe epidemic one largest tourism seasons years, never made sense me.

Asia (and rest world) would way lucky case virus miraculously bypassed caused huge scene Europe, lead similar scenes Asia albeit much later. 

It would also mean (at least some) antibody studies overestimating many people got covid19 strain issue with. Ontario, Canada, March mid-June criteria get tested fairly strict (only Province, knew someone tested positive handful places China Italy, symptoms bad enough warrant hospitalisation). Basically, trying reserve capacity cases result test would influence treatment plan. capacity ramped curve started flattening, began urge everyone get tested. said, positive rate never nearly high Mexico apparently experiencing. Every 60 seconds Africa, minute passes. article: 2 months outbreak, still conducting 173 tests per 1 million people. comparison, United States time carrying 38,394 tests per 1 million...

The US increased testing, still hear US enough tests. (I live US.) remember countries, like Mali, far behind US testing.

A years ago, Ebola broke West African countries. West Africans remember Ebola (like East Asians remember SARS MERS) might willing take steps covid-19, like social distancing wearing face masks.

Well damn guess we’re stupid AF gf’s family Sonora brother doctor there. brought azithromycin (by itself) prophylactic coronavirus, said everyone using it. true?

Also regarding epidemiology, Mexican government sort random testing make estimate prevalence? works better complaining reddit make someone give dad nasal swab. Sorry bruised ego. I'm saying many Americans fucking stupid Exactly!! keep changing numbers website it’s ridiculous! screenshot COVID-19 related deaths week 5/27, someone shared data 6/25 numbers every week since 2/2 anywhere thousands. 

Also, implementing new strategy/counting tests means throw old data, state wrongfully acquired inaccurate (but course best data time now), push new system counting keep numbers low political reasons. It’s means justify keeping businesses open country—to help keep money pockets 0.1% population—at time 80k+ cases reported per day, deaths higher anywhere else. 

The country could’ve better government healthcare pay testing covid19 treatment, but, damn politicians big corporations wanted Bernie lose another corporate puppet instead. country soon learn bad mistake take race. Lol cant wait hear drunk people trying get ride mask get turned down. good lesson them. Wear mask people hard all. Guess gonna gonna be...honestly, bother testing all, save money tests hiring people contact trace (no point that's positive rate testing anyone outside hospitals). Hope can't get again...Hope people manage pull through, honestly feel terrible people without advantages given geography (Canada here). fortune 100 financial company made call 3 weeks ago associates working home 2020. think liability. ""got covid"" McDonald's, location might fucked while. also impossible get employees feel safe. Good news, deaths cattle make laugh. Well want freedom thus i'l give ya surgeons dropping dead operating table CO2 asphyxiation joke!

/s stakes raised Vegas gambling money life Sounds like you’re pretty close me. high school you’re referring one I’m thinking of, can’t help think they’re either publicizing story intentionally, someone knew positive deliberately attended, senior class made big deal actual commencement ceremony. Yep, would say China’s numbers \* 2 might good estimate, way it’s 10 times worse. whole country back office without hospitals jammed. Sweden multiple deaths Scandinavian neighbours. studies came showing basically economy also took similar hit locked down. 


 (they 10 times Covid related deaths Denmark 20x Norway) That's China doing. running tests soldiers swear I've never gotten diarrhea tacos Mexican food. real thing, meme? surprised announce made laboratory .....fuck. Trump caused corona? read this. Live WNY, able get control sort of. conflating things. protests, day, consisted thousands people wearing masks. rioting, night, hundred people most. Maybe dozens. even majority wearing masks.  Well, gamble say least.  Blitz test, fedral gov? guys throwing maskless rallies? nobody tests much US, it’s even close .. idea upvoted much. one thing, quite viral infections centuries evolve still deadlier one. getting milder virus via mutation means guaranteed here.

You right possible reason virus could become transmissible would less severe infected people less likely tested isolated die. reducing lethality one possible way increase transmissibility. case wouldn’t effective tactic quite lot infected people mild asymptomatic disease already spread virus show serious symptoms.

The article even says this: “However, researchers currently know whether small mutation affects severity symptoms infected people, increases mortality”. Don’t jump conclusions. Would willing say area Ohio work in? Like county nearby town/city?

I'm sorry situation. enforcing masks? Technically correct, also way off. received almost 4.5 million votes compared Hillary receiving 8.75million. that's irrelevant.

This political issue. COVID kill R, matter much demand masks infringe rights. COVID also kill D, social distancing protest awful killing Floyd.

The virus care beliefs are, reason doing. stupid things like social distance, gatherings without mask, going catch it. either loved ones die result.

So stop making political. Stop feeding stupidity. going beat COVID ""me vs. you"" society. beat humans.

You're wrong R. wrong D. wrong causing outbreak. problem, focus. Period. Deaths lag weeks behind cases. Covid really long incubation period (2-14 days) usually takes couple weeks symptom onset die. see fallout weeks. Oh got people riled alright. know, asking wear masks stores got going. people trying get tossed office... law, go Congress.... I'm going listen.... Blah blah blah. big difference see ordinance versus we're yesterday need wear mask outside less 6 feet away someone, really huge change. also amount evidence people dying Covid19. people terrible lung capacity. many claiming exemptions.

Sucks people really need exemption. people getting exposed so.... delivery Fucking lmao Reminds area talk prison inmate via glass partition phone... talking rich people. Precautions yes. agree spacing tables resteraunts stuff, social distancing strangers, wearing masks on. expect people stay home next 18 months social distance friends family...it’s realistic. 

Things US going crazy. country mostly eliminated community transmission time being, great. given horrendous economic effects lockdowns (which agree work!) feel second lockdown may US harm letting COVID run it’s course isolating vulnerable risk Thanks, recognize dropped missed P 70? 

I think missed decimal point. 

Here I’ll fix ya... 

7.0 

No that’s credible Since PCR tests false negative rates 20%\~30%, actual situation even worse 50% positive rate suggests. worries! difficult many people stay isolated past months. You’ll probably okay it’s large well ventilated area wears mask. Stay safe there! Official english translation:

http://en.nhc.gov.cn/2020-07/02/c_80968.htm He’s still got it, Ice ice baby majority people hick town rural PA stopped wearing masks previous mask order even lifted. shit, signs around town saying “COVID Rebellion” like Whiskey Rebellion. 

So I’m sure go well them. took aid Egypt 20 years beating living shit middle east. I’d imagine contact tracing something like covid never bothered anyway Get fuck here, protests proven cause major spreads. It’s early reopening states aren’t ready rejection mask social distancing culture. 

Miss dog whistles Federal Government stays sitting ass nothing, don’t see it’s possible lockdown again. Especially level infection. would locked months, expanded unemployment running end July I’m sure people realize deep shit be. Already implemented UK, feel much safer it. 90% drivers (in experience) also wearing masks Except spreading virus disease serious. people 60. Everyone else? much. lockdown nursing homes let risk continue cranking gears society. 

You doomers nothing peddle nothing bad news disaster fetishism. Panic porn hermits. explain lack outbreaks NY MA? 

I mean, protests must effect, seems pale comparison reopening. can't believe anyone thinks masks would reduce O2 sats. job required full face respirator 12+ hours somehow die asphyxiation. look Iran's second surge, looks like 3 - 4 weeks. Cases broke normal range June 18th USA, July 9th seeing deaths increasing, mid-late July things may get really quite ugly... We'll see :( Cases etc time low former teacher safely say folks idea easily distracted kids really are. viable solution. kids wind twirling masks around finger like fidget spinner, stretching elastic shooting across room other, pulling eyes like blindfold. spiked NYC, pretty heavy protesting? [Oh that's right, actually wearing accurate mean useless. good idea better idea. Alabama students invite leopard “eat face” parties, slather bodies sardine oil see happens: it’s official. really sure? I’m good math. Could explain got number? China implemented draconian quarantine measures puts full security apparatus behind masks enforced social distancing. know rest East Asia Europe even tenth China sufficient controlling virus.

Fuck CCP, believe China's numbers frankly closer reality USA reporting. *Shhhhhh, let natural selection take course...* ""CMS first issued guidance April limited insurance coverage testing tests “medically necessary” without defining term, issued updated guidance last week walled tests ordered employers pandemic surveillance tests insurance coverage."" 

This objection - still cover tests, return-to-work pandemic surveillance tests? looks bad enough. Well, hurting yourselves. Hmmm...yup, definitely get aids way. deaths lag, wait 2 weeks see tht deaths today Exactly!!! first time forever? link evidence says asymptomatic patients can’t get lung damage? dad wearing one he'll lose job. Texas serious problem needs lockdown today, preferably, yesterday. Thousands people shoulder shoulder screaming hours perfect environment people getting infected. outcome Amsterdam? cases low? not? flu bro.
/s Weird flex okay. live Houston reach Galveston hour. Florida provide n95 masks children! No? Oh dumb. Holy cow. is... horrendous. ok made look article again. graph gave much different one article. see article saying, 50% CURRENT positive rate number trending upwards.

thx people issue Facebook account mobile app. I'm betting robberies gonna go roof. CAT scans scientific study showing correlation cause. kill host making easier spread.

it's adapting making easier spread. 

(and state bit correctly, 'easier spread' selected lethality one aspect that. fact, week long asymptomatic phase spreading followed quick death would fine evolution).

And D614G ""mutation"", infect cells much higher rate (which paper says) much much worse individual.  basically getting 10 times viral load, 10 times likely overwhelm immune system, one would think. Damn, kid raised MONKEY deliver safety kits middle pandemic. he's even 16. fuck age?

Remember shocked/amazed US hitting 50k infections total? I'm sure spreading getting (those seem like overstatements). everything read states kids show little risk severe symptoms, would lend towards spreading easily. minority kids developing rash, resulting hospitalizations. rash part seems normal compared viruses, tbut hospitalizations bit worrying. doesnt seem unexpected though see cold flu viruses effect minority, I'm sure comparable numbers are. Yeah that's key marker, mean deaths started rising Monday cant speak everywhere McDonald's work busts asses whole time we're keep cleaning date. even started scheduling extra people everyday clean top everyone already clean.

 post church's Facebook page, face coverings ""strongly encouraged"" church reconvenes July 12. still wouldn’t count oficial tally. Friday evening gates getting locked, flood lights alarm system armed. Luckily see vistas fireworks, pool plenty beer weekend. Ain't going anywhere! haven’t locked world hospitals overrun standard flu years? Honest question here, Canadian dog fight:

Cases going up, deaths seem going way, way down. I've heard ""deaths lagging indicator"" meme now, typical 2 week period. maybe things nearly bad seems? it’s insane. i’m Columbus, rural, still see maybe 10% people wearing masks grocery store, around 30-40% major shopping mall (with masks required sign, enforcement) want hear this. true FUBAR. Go party ass like tomorrow. hospitals nonprofits, still balance books. Great. comes idiot wall talk. extreme, rock mask like vandal

Cough storm, can't let spread like scandal Pox News! sell beer gyms? gym that? new idea. Every distillery uncle this... would’ve thought worlds immune compromised people actually affected. 

You know, elderly, children immune compromised. 

I’m least surprised. They're supposed NC too...yet half people see wear them. Yesterday first 6k+ day Texas.😭

Today first 8k+ day Texas 😭😭😱

And we're still massively undertesting. Congrats america, deserve Read whole article. put place mask-wearing, social distancing classrooms, testing tracing, increase percentage classes taught online, transmission virus held check. 

MSU plans things. draw charts sure include fact district's latest cases arose completely locked positive cases immediately isolated. Thanks links. It’s good find comments actual data pointers. higher than.. when? ailments years show spikes. 100%. barely get wear IDs school. Maybe deaths continue decrease? US showing whole world awesome are. sad. 
This better remembered history books words ‘Murica. RemindMe! 14 days Deaths per million citizens

9th USA - 395
11th Ireland - 352

Tests per million citizens 

USA - 105,302
Ireland - 87,947

It’s really different. consider Ireland island fewer major metros doesn’t political parties intent cannibalizing expense everyone. That’s funny took uber last night wore mask incase driver wanted got car immediately told didn’t need *to extreme wear mask like vandal, 30 days vent hardly blow candle* put 50% capacity cap lot businesses/offices practically enforcement. it’s pretty much free-for-all people follow rules others don’t give shit. hicks pennsyltucky riled up. People barely graduated high school experts diseases now. Ready cough people wal mart rip masks libtards wearing masks. happened yesterday county. UK's already elected trump lite separate hospital system pay every month. Effectively like insurance policy. supposed better public system video even disturbing. insane even happening. course private hospitals videos. \*really\* learn depressing history coronavirus vaccines guinea pig. 

Mandates invitation corruption.  deep pockets know pay get vaccine list. logistics rollout gonna something behold. Hopefully fuck bad. Yes, relatively safe.

To safe though, sit trunk car. I’m scared go back. work Palm Beach. I’m sure seen video... Or, make masks mandatory:
[Wearing masks would cause 80% decrease COVID 19 problem almost everyone wear them. article:

""However, plan hinges widespread support unified engagement, like seen Japan, Hong Kong global locations, mask-wearing norm. “If get 30 40% [of people wearing masks], get almost [beneficial] effect all.”""

Unfortunately, many Americans would rather risk bankrupting country well thousands people dying ""freedom"" wear mask important. Yep ostrich approach pretty common. People thing drug problems. keep trying convince nothing wrong. ""All y'all wearing masks SCARED, media manipulates you, can't THINK YOURSELF."" Uh, yeah, right. endless repeat live 4th world, get right. Good God. people need placed island thousand miles away civilization. need forget them. I'm usually live let die Jesus Christ, what's wrong you? Health insurance racket insane live-to-work ethic? fucked like 5 different directions. much bullshit unravel country barely know begin. people full swallowed propaganda fight every step way even makes lives better. find one supposed mask-wearing drivers lol happy state isn’t rest country right it’s hard thank anyone health officials got us here. 

But shit choked water Don’t disrespect ice cube ice like books come this... one friend works restaurant, restaurant would like 90k weekend sales. dropped staff went take did...90k weekend sales like half staff. hoops jump thruough higher risk exposure reopening dine said probably gonna remain take everything bak normal sortedout. Rob van winkle, absolute goon. Besides ""requiring"" 14-day quarantine, sort action could government take prevent travelers ""hot spots"" spreading virus states decrease cases? Based I've heard, enforcement New York state's mandated quarantine (for travelers Florida) practically non-existant.

I think part reason United States hard time containing virus due ease travel states. could issue Northeast, individuals heavily impacted states could fly north cause resurgence cases. tried post story CNN MSNBC bot blocked “possibly unreliable sources”. Wtg, fair balanced sub. live Cambria county, people wearing untill went ""green"". also hot fuck right now, that's helping. would expensive lose employees, pay health benefits, lose entirely death, retain replacements would keep stores closed. money. lean right. Statements like big part issue. think dash cam one best things driver do.

Agreed. suggestion meant addition, replacement. Anybody working taxi/ride-share driver dash cam. Honestly, think everybody get dash cam. never know someone could make accusation simple dash cam footage could prove completely don’t know rules now, years ago weapons platform prohibited. 

For people working taxi/ride-share, think least hand gun kind person easily within reach would recommended (especially live town high crime rate). care Uber whoever policy guns. car life. idiot wave around Uber never know. use responsibly, Uber find forced save life. job worth life. Fair enough. Thought that’s meant. Covid: round two? thanks zoomers What’s better, surgical mask layered cotton mask? Shall start Darwin Awards early year? Alabama trying pull ahead Texass Floriduh. hate math nasty liberal scam. flaunt stupidity math bragging poor performance Say want people infect I'm convinced factor. best example NYC. mid April antibody studies near 20%, mid April. Let's put together means. people antibodies get 2 weeks still don't. likely means folks virus March early April. 

This peak (the study) still 6-7k cases day point even higher week two before. painfully slowed today gradually. think reasonable call 30% today produce antibodies. Yet another factor discovered fighting T-Cells never producing antibodies shown 50% higher antibody. 10 people antibodies, 15 people TCells antibodies. Ball park puts NYC around 45%.

Folks say need 70% herd immunity that's mostly bushit real world. assume specific scenario preventative measures flat R value simply impossible real world. I'm wearing mask ultra safe, remove infectable community certain % move people immune category even though never infected. Demographics, density, Rt, preventative measures play role. affect herd immunity lower threshold quicker outbreaks snuffed out.

Except social media least half dozen different bad actors (within without country) varying intentions centered around destabilizing America social disorder  posted translation comments Deaths delayed 10-14 days. We’ll know reduction mortality. average dropped testing widespread. tested people symptoms tend older. testing everyone catching lot mild cases young people. also reason deathrate continues decline. much talk unfortunately much walk. Anyone outside claim breathing issue mask. Technically US, Germany, France, U. K, South Korea well, Earth third world Solar system. Wow. weird. watching local news started talking beach report weekend like nothing going on.

Today dad said something along lines ""sunlight best disinfectant... weird southern states spikes cases"". Like gee dad, sure mystery states refused shut promptly effectively trouble now. Last week hot, Sweden pretty humid summer. week cooler though.

Woohoooo way go florida! proud hun x wonder air conditioning factor... many died? trying sarcastic genuinely curious. Covid sucks Oof. Hold fast, Volunteer State. Scientist behind scenes, 100% agree. Call senators, don’t blame doctor. We’re def winning infection rates skyrocketing many States speak, positive correlation deaths well. words, people dying Covid also shoot it’s not.

Now whether it’s still need wait another week two pan out, maybe it’s actually mutating less deadly something needs taken consideration.

And lastly, saying simply knowledgeable back February care handle sick patients that’s reason deaths either gone remained steady number, personally feeling perhaps virus mutating less lethal somehow.

In case, don’t know yet... Maybe they’re going beach? wrong.  

 

But incompetent, taking action all, also actively making things worse. Probably trying avoid constitutional challenges saying implementing poll tax (needing mask) limiting religious freedom Ice Covid infection

Wheeled morgue priest absolves it. FLVS expanded servers handle 3 million students, 250,000, hired/is hiring teachers fill that.

You talked things nothing anything. knew masks effective. one ever claimed 100. knew helped, place social distancing. says, circumstances changed. Read damn statement. circumstances? Well, thing really changed terms actual circumstances, directly states, masks! can’t stubborn. 

They downplayed masks, hoping people would discouraged buying taking supply medical professionals. knew effective. statement, knowledge had, easily been: “Masks effective, currently shortage, want Americans buying masks, instead stay home possible social distance that’s possible longer shortage.” That’s truth. Instead, said, [“masks you’ll keep digging heels. 在中国我们都用 “第三世界国家，”的说法。 Kool Kool Kool Hospitalization lags infection 2weeks, death lags hospitalization three weeks, average. Also, infection doubling rate 7-10 days time start see hospitalization rising leading edge calamity. go bar drink though. Triple H said sword fight covid19!  I'm going let actual scientists figure listen them, I'm scientist. Also, China bigger size India. 2020 short irony real problem ""invisible hurricane"" stop real hurricanes, wait. ""I think drunk,"" valid defense killing someone driving drunk. k, wondering, lol. problem speaking science ""the truth"" observation reality sociology.

We doctors saying chances dying lower see less viral load cases coming in. think lying. time would irresponsible ISS support claims.

As article reports none valid theory. seasonal flu around mixed covid made infection severe? treat people earlier less cases better testing? masks social distancing people exposed lower viral load? kind dynamic understand hot weather? mutation might weaker?

If science supporting say none would anything say that.

To make comparison say sun moves around everyday east west. That's fact.
But science: result observation. turns moving. obviously disprove observation: sun perspective moving east west.

It's thing. Less chances die less viral load numbers. without understanding information considered truth could totally change tomorrow. Add clickbait article people reading headlines done.

Let's say reason people get sick exposed lower viral load. People read headline, believe kind official statement keep distance wear masks. Obviously viral load exposed increase would hospitalized totally different scenario.

What doctors going say cases rise again? Oh see people started dying like march swabs lot viral load. know hey report see.

Again: science. totally wrong, one reason see much. 1.25 (or even 1.33) much closer/more accurate THIS. February 2020 reports persons infected SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms COVID-19. cases viral load **asymptomatic persons equal symptomatic persons**, suggesting similar potential viral transmission. making shit up.  Looks like Christians gonna die even started group workouts yet poor guy really bad. Keep fighting man. wife one month old, colleagues university work demand see calls. Every day realize fortunate am! New York teach know will.

People severe illness sometimes lifelong disabilities. understand fucking morons realize old people live isolated bubble young people. Maybe there's excess cancer deaths car deaths covid Last line makes great slogan fascinating people USA become accustomed this. 

Stalin right - single death tragedy - million deaths statistics. Bolsonaro también ha dicho que usar mascarillas es ir en su contra? Pero que lo es que le pasa por la cabeza esa gente? Suburban sprawl single family homes air conditioning.

And please notice number 1/2 previous 14 day period.  number deaths decreasing.

So precisely, ""average daily reported increase newly reported deaths"" approximately (-1) per day. one less every day. definite risks infection. particular risk plane ride close proximity others long period time. also presents problems use things like restrooms issues subway. aren't. Go spread fake news shit elsewhere Indiana. People care anymore. Cases going explode holiday. Source? Tickle balls call Negan Okay well can’t blame using antibody estimate provided article. Unless antibody results article way low factor 3 (and would be?), IFR 0.2%. IFR= number deaths/ number people infected. 945,000 people 5.5% Netherlands 6,100/945,000 = 0.65% IFR. Plain simple math. 

Do know Dutch CDC says 98% people mild symptoms? seems like pretty high estimate would love hear got idea. really. Countries like Singapore Hong Kong manageable due size, also better barometer New Zealand Denmark given high density. SG HK report meticulously.

It’s lose lose situation. Lfg guys! #roadto60k forget crippling medical debt too!!!! Since increased case correlates increased positive rate rather testing, suspect 2.5 multiplier increasing soon. concert one sorry ass track?! Damn, that's like one every 6,600 Americans tested positive today. I've noticed VA. I'm northern VA moment (DC suburbs) everyone wearing masks. Drove 2 hours south farmland hike Shenandoah yesterday see single person wearing damn mask stopped gas. It’s nice see states adding stats go along. beginning NJ everything long term care facilities hospital breakouts type. Like stories.

* Wdym still? It’s like asking people Italian restaurant like Italian food. shit there’s gonna positive tests they’re testing sick people 60-70% typically considered needed herd immunity. However interesting paper came recently used big data/mathematical approach said could low ~45% county (Pinellas) know exactly means look good. looks like red(hospital divert) saying patients ambulance find another hospital. White(covid positive divert) covid positive accepted hospital. 

The 2 concern me. also wonder looks like non covid times  live New York think self-congratulatory tone we’re taking (I guess cues Governor) much. outbreak bad 1/4 1/3 New Yorkers already it, (for now) immune. It’s pattern basically everywhere else bad outbreak - goes up, goes down, regardless people (see Sweden, lot death, though way less New York, never locked curve crashed too). 

The South California didn’t bad outbreak March, lockdown accomplished nothing (a small % infected started, similarly small % infected stopped) one immunity. virus force nature - slow down, can’t stop it. Look what’s happening South Central America - thing asCalifornia American South. 

I know it’s comforting think lot control progression thing, it’s basically going run whole world. Remember initial goal lockdown spread cases - mission accomplished. 

New York 1,700 deaths per million Texas 80. Texas going go up, won’t get near 1,700 humility saying know much better them. extremely bad outcome - probably anyone’s control (except nursing home debacle), clearly didn’t “do right” measure. _the nfl, keep us thinking whats really going on_ Same! Every time think I'm coming side, get knocked ass again. expect millions people protest without masks... Unfortunately, doesn’t matter many great doctors, epidemiologists scientists they’re stifled incompetent corrupt politicians. Also, don’t quick call whatever country live third-world. Chances you’re faring better us. talking about? literally straight dutch CDC. 

They're fucking words. Hey look, unless lock-down going keep getting worse. going stop thing, would lock last week. Furthermore, really see results shutdown another month.

Not seeing exponential growth anymore positive, could argue that's we've hit current limit testing. percentage deaths going down; good. means they're learning treat better. I'm convinced containment really ever gonna happen US point. Seems like everyone giving up. ***Poof*** know fast period someone spread covid exposed? example someone unknowingly exposed Saturday could infect someone following day? I’ve seeing seems 48 hours onset symptoms. situation revenge lady. wearing mask nowhere near dangerous wearing seatbelt. Seems like concept “risk”. bet concerts well 50 people. going Keep America Great, back bubble economy still inflated. went Transition Greatness, they're going back branding worked (no creativity, sad!) actually Make America Great Again...

Make great again, again, apparently. keep electing constantly look forward backwards ages ""greatness"" (see bubble economies racists afraid racist). ...and far daily count rising 40 50 states. forced back job intact people time go bar/beaches/parties? Society decided expendable might well fun can. Hence ""people pressed sell,"" mortgage house would pressing issue. nearly three weeks since cases started increasing yet deaths still trending down.  Finally something proactive instead reactive once, NY. Bravo Zulu USA USA USA USA USA FREEDOM 

 

I looking forward 4th July weekend America general. People literally yelling trucks people wearing masks saying ""you're killing kids CO2 poisoning"" ???????????????? expect millions people protest without wearing masks Inc CCP cyber attack. incendiary? Gen Z something else... Speak aMeRiCan! /s gave much credit. 

Here American might describe situation. higher usual proportion population morons, small part role anti-intellectualism political corruption played systematically making schools absolute dog shit decades thing that's going save us right probably fourth four boxes preservation liberty. Florida dropping US whole increasing. must kidding. Google fact-check hospitals incentive mark cause death Covid. get Covid death normal one. Secondly, guidelines “assumed Covid” issued CDC April goofed things you. Yale study could easily Uber liberal attempt “speculate” article mentions. data. interpretation woefully poor data. Oh look alt ""dutch propagandist"" earlier.  ~~MY~~ MAH RIGHTS!!! Old artictle May guessing ""can be"". look newer article:  : Official covid-19 death 3981 excess death 191. 5%, ""bulk"". 


Sweden lack transparency? No, nr 4th last year:  


As Mark, release covid.-19 death ""risc sabotage"", BS. journalists appeals Kammarrätten, proably win Mark forced release numbers. ""hide"" numbers region collects data. release numbers journalist. Arizona Florida look worse, Arizona ""winner"" screwed. I'm same, hit last night turned seems like normal cold now, currently winter Australia due virus they've got working night cold shed minimal heating. 

I kinda feel silly get tested one done 2 weeks ago negative, plus guarantee work think I'm faking try bullshit skirting law bullying, last test took days get results back happy time ""in hard times""

Can't wait till tell em get fucked find new job Sadly people need take advice heart situation... exposing knows many people process.

Assume everyone it, including you. Wear damn mask. Well maybe much TESTING reporting many CASES smh........ /s Yeah remember going beach kid sister mom. (Asbury park seaside heights) crowded back then. imagine now.
I'm hiker/camper hope get camping summer. 🎶I got bad, got bad, got bad ... I'm scared friends us. Thankfully wear masks still People dip toes in, cannonballed back in. Trump even sound comfortable saying 'numbers'. Idk man, gonna tell mom that? I’d hard time. Fair enough. gonna talk something point authority subject, get right. Good, Terrible. Might last chapter... basically, need scapegoat things go south. Got it. yeah thanks TX morons FL We're number one! We're number one! Cleaned lot plates Memphis

Too also diabetes. Omg someone like me! People always ask ""does smell good?"" stare push side nose show direction pointing. need subjects exposed virus Phase I. first check immediate side effects immune responses. come promising may try vaccine country high case numbers. Wait. Really? $88 baseball? That’s really interesting specific price settle upon given use white supremacists. Huh going need better define parameters. TX population 29M. USA!!! USA!!! USA!!! public wanted gone. think bigger problem people leave beach want hit bars cool drink. state suspend drinking bars maybe helps.

Oh yes, bars open, probably everybody go home alone, nobody meet rooms drink instead. Kills viruses contact. Says right label. Following expert advice responsible thing global pandemic. What? even read article? Sweden deaths, unemployment, worse effect economy. every metric method inferior. fall Denmark continue control spread Sweden continue slide deeper disaster. Daycare charge per day typically, bill month. reducing number days daycare save people squat. anything makes logistics difficult. add zero that, like 30k, people aware fact testing small percentage people variety reasons next time Facebook “friend” calls reported number fake news, actually agree tell it’s much higher. part gets me. can’t expect everyone suspicious enough realize elected officials wrong thing ignoring science. lot people going hear leaders saying, look around people doing, assume everything ok. slightly naive shouldn’t death sentence. 

This guy didn’t deserve this, people charge blood hands. case Sweden operate normally

...no.... haven’t reached herd immunity.  friend NGO work slums poor country. trying figure best practices one running water, soap, people live dozen small shack.

There’s way it. SPOT SHIT LIB Death rate lot lower .5 kids. 

You're likely see deaths immediate families 50 yr old parents catch them. See! get it. sub almost echo chamber, don’t think we’re problem. Although there’s echo chambers there’s... Echo. Chambers. happening around here. People need let happen way. Many resisting far better daycare, cheaper, middle road solution terms risk. families need second income, family one parent, way go. greedy? i'm essentially ghost bakery dig around get daily numbers. FSM is. hail Noodleness! setting new records daily, exponential growth works. mandates put place enough. I've wondering lot too. serious doubts would ever cancel season. still do. me, always whether fans stands not. Could NFL brazen? used think so. Right think play fans. TV revenue just.....too much walk away from. 

While can't put players ""full-on bubble"" could things like that. Going road two weeks? Players stay hotels 2 cities. hotels bought one else stays there. rooms sanitized ahead time, stay teammates bubble two weeks. social distance wear masks anyone team teams bubble.

When home games can't exactly stop going home families. So, test quarantine constantly. 

But still, many CRAZY possibilities. happens if...an entire teams starting Offensive Line tests positive Saturday game? 

Lastly...What refunded everybodies money started ticketing process scratch 2020. Season ticket holders get seats back 2021. Getting ticket Lottery system. stadium at...like 15% capacity ( whatever ) fans entering stadium must wear masks? 

That might way play front fans, totally ignore considerable dangers.  took us 3 months take virus. means rest country seeing spikes get virus control 3 months start something today. listening people tell want hear. dumbest part HIPAA even apply. coffee shop refusing serve wear mask covered entity law one thing need know medical issue anyway, mask private business set mask rule (with local, state, federal law superseding).

I asthma, disclose disability many (any?) cases ADA, exempt wearing mask either going business. think could argue wearing mask ""reasonable accommodation"" current circumstances. move percent tests positive compared month two ago. tell us better number cases. president though, chancellor. Covid-19 get know day school vs remote. /s

What dumb idea. Yeah, think would come self-promotion, there's rule saying ""keep information quality high"" - post news post, think right place.

(I sorry difficulties though, I'm autistic otherwise disabled too, ways often slip cracks fight right exist. hope get help need.) Parts American responded horribly, still lower death rates places like [Sweden harassed wearing Spain [where people protested lockdown like masks mildly uncomfortable, really difficult thing do. I'm never wearing one 45 minutes time, even happen make multiple stops running errands.

Plus, gives opportunity make 'em fun. I've got Cowboys mask pocket need run later today lunch break. Gotta rep favorite football team, all. another headline sounds straight Plague Inc. Yo fuck rich fucking stupid time.

This people going back work. strong jobs report.

This slow recover worst job loss we've ever seen.

Fuck. inaccurate use term. Thats great news. Herd immunity time. Either way, usa bad curiosity, chosen (or planning)? Hence us physicians screaming get go. 
This beginning collapse medical infrastructure. new norm long society elected officials choose ignore science. Interesting. done home? ..."" intubated, put ventilator ""...You realise survival rate \*treatment\* basically zero could go wrong?! seems like great idea. /s North shall rise again! wait July 4th point cant even know kuch actually is, frightening Dance! 🕺🏼💃 100% texas yet, remdesivir widely available criteria receive it.

Im curious long term inpatient somewhere got covid. hospital patient. also sounds like long battle family care usually means one side pushing let die one pushing keep alive. 'MURICA! Epidemiologists must err side caution, even overestimate. Scientists also self preservation personal reasons legitimize positions. 


I probably mention I'm adding conversation. 
 side fauci feel governor willfully putting people danger. protests partial reopenings gave people false sense security.

The protests pushed pandemic background. Many Governors supported them. People said racism bigger problem virus.

""Over 1,000 health professionals sign letter saying, shut protests using coronavirus concerns excuse"" - wouldn’t doubt second. france, authorities quickly said young ppl less prone die/showing signs sick, actually made often silent carries population spread virus most. why, infect family, actually extra cautious. wasnt us? makes US response much worse.

Some selective memory here. US first started closing borders efforts called racist xenophobic. Border control (NZ, AU, SK) consistent characteristic countries gotten front CV-19. trying scare you, check doctor need go hospital trouble getting enough oxygen walking yards. Ahh, miracle. Amazing numbers good trying times. Guess don’t put another round stimulus checks us prols. much winning. people don’t understand rates. Early days lockdown people province freaking provincial government handling well way cases neighbouring province. thing twice population testing 4 times rate looked bad. went 2 weeks new infections nobody currently back 1 somebody came home abroad mandatory 2 week isolation probably didn’t spread it. neighbours hand several cases still. yes attest this. pnumonia fuck lungs. four kids, wife work (I'm WFH software developer, wife still go work since Clinical Lab Scientist local hospital). fucking easy sure. We've rely lot parents help babysitting two younger children (whereas 10 13 year olds mostly self sufficient outside needing help prepping lunch) I've take significant amount leave. Thankfully company already generous leave policy provides 20 days year PTO top extra 80 hours gave every employee due Covid-19. They've also super understanding allowing flexible work schedule. can't imagine folks surviving work jobs understanding flexible. North México taking seriously. South big part Central México aren't. winter discontent. would Sweden stop incoming tourists? They're source income, valuable times. Guess Corona virus disappear go rioting looting streets... Go figure. one kids, economy collapse due aging population one take care them.  give back you? sew masks non-profits. fear they're chucked away ultimate recipient like it. People equate $0 cost has-no-worth ... I'd prefer people regift them. Feb 12 60k cases *in whole world* Yes! great way put it. I've using 'it shined bright light exposing rot' analogy better tbh. always like this? underlying disease getting worse? aware symptoms?

Yes, yes, yes! 

For Sweden interesting learn COVID response one datapoint failure last decades. [video Swedish (who tbh think would dislike time) really good overview Sweden falling apart seams terms connection reality / facts. disconnection reality part become hard hit virus. 

It's similar what's gone US. fact, I've come thinking Sweden US Nordics studying intensely time now. compliment. couple weeks ago, hopefully total means 9-15 months. Everything depends vaccine fully tested, fielded, administered. Although think hit everyone buy breathing room couple months herd immunity.... would looooot dead people would think demand anything China India would non existent? Everything need know education Alabama folks.

These people get 1 vote political scientists shit.. root canal early June. originally scheduled day quarantine started. abscess, considered emergency. wait things started opening again, even busy getting scheduled hard. meant longer wait get seen. endodontist assistant wore serious face masks. checked temperature asked symptoms well. 

Now regular dentist refusing see get permanent filling in. He's cautious. He's older man hold him. appointment new dentist (recommended family member) next week. meantime I'm careful eat hard sticky foods side mouth. usually like know dentist letting work me, really need done. Hopefully get crown without hiccups weeks now. State Academy says positive tests came last week, even though school ""diligently followed best practices CDC recommendations.""

Reopening schools looks like going well. think job? That’s laughable. denial guvernor get infected yet? think safe go  among people. Read response again

I sarcastic Hopefully ""sort disappear"". prison cell, maybe. U mean health authority faking numbers? hope ... paper towels I'm using washing hands public restrooms. one ever said it’s 500 deaths. It’s 4634 world meter. I'm sad. Great people. envied Americans. WTF happened.... plus side, people attending Vanilla Ice concert still follow social distancing rules 10 there. Failed? like accepted die society must survive too. Stop blaming Sweden. win long run. Myopic generational idiots see short term long term addition 127k deaths already. like 5-6 flu seasons worth, basically. Remember riots large cities week ago... yeah, thousands people forgot social distancing masks. Weird celebrated media though. church bad... Alabama never disappoints race disappoint. think people aren’t going enjoy Fourth July you’ve got another thing coming. wuhanvirus interfere spirit Americans. I’m even fan mr vanilla think rap animal noise there’s hoodlum homeboys want go shows assuming they’re drugged stealing stuff. Winter / flu season **CARNAGE**

There article healthy bodybuilder coronavirus flu time lost like 50 lbs hospitals weeks. interviewed doctor treated doctor said terrified bodybuilder could barely survive others wouldn’t lucky No, lie used find leak NK administration. Michigan? Looks pretty consistent last month Trump says Georgia stop state. Can't count numbers place US  Unbelievable Florida reporting data.   necessarily ton people early knew corona told wouldn’t tested treated way without test. friends entire family wife tested wouldn’t test anyone else family said assumed it. Luckily family wife sickest came close goi f hospital never did. case kids cases minor bad headaches nothing else bad.

I’m arguing shouldn’t wear masks social distance long keep hospitals overwhelmed keep going goal start. Awwww tried since last one got deleted. Cute. happens riders refuse wear mask complain directly uber driver tells ""No mask ride"" checked, Mongolia indeed third world country.  Well that's embarrassing..... 6 happened grasp severity impact event, affected makes feel another sense, makes personal, opinion leaders people would rather bury heads sand. Haven’t heard it’s summer we’re missing it! replied post, comment implying that. Check archives. Every state faired differently. made really poor decisions like ummm HOLDING PARADE. also Anti-mask leagues. 

 places tried fine people wearing mask public uproar eventually dropped tickets.
 
 Honestly we've seemed learned nothing history. 

Reading archives almost play play pandemics response. understand mistakes lack better medicine time what's excuse today?
 
Stupidity. 

Normalcy bias real virus here. Yes reference ""thick skulled"". seemed rude, help explain point all, therefore cheapened argument. again, appreciate least politely agree disagree. get saying, still think even hard evidence lacking, I'll trust life experiences accumulated background knowledge experts would non-expert spouting whatever heard politician. IMO, one still evidence fingertips other. comments shadowbanned, makes sense. Someone please explain Mr. Ice time works. Okay. wandered charts thing find mirror numbers hospitalizations chart chart cumulative settings, May 01, 2020 cumulative 3760. June 01, 5939. 2179 cumulative May 1st June 1st. today, 7209 cumulative number hospitalizations. there's 1270, June 1st July 1st.

Howeverrr,... ICU cases indeed going positive cases go up, chart.

COVID-19 positive 598

COVID-19 positive ICU 207

Also, fact we've still administered [788,403 population still pathetic best. while.

*Edit formatting* Aahhh shit. one even come close covid score, we’re lead way catch us now... it’s open road here, we’ve broken away .... moon! America F’Yeah! likely are. Maybe even 100% them, quarantine normal times would saved lives due less stress day day life. Technically yes ignore dead students facility risk see **(reference future moment time)** whether **(reference uncertainty, several outcomes)** means deaths labeled COVID related loooots excess mortality.

I formulated exact terms, said Haha yeah forgot it’s probably Karen’s you’re dealing country would elected Donald Trump president. saying... “cross reactive cells mean we’re closer herd immunity think!” hype there, things like (and data prisons) pretty strong evidence aren’t already large swaths population immune. 16 million. great, terrible.

(VOTE) I’m always happy somebody says dark thought mind loud do. Cheers. dude dead brain dead whatever fuck Pepperidge Farms remembers Drivers amazing masks. Even touching things etc like put something trunk kept apologising would love help can’t didn’t want risk really happy hear. handed us hand sanitizer also whole front/back section sealed professionally. 

He telling us people would get refusing wear masks giving grief shield. saying health insurance issues right get sick would screwed Poor dude. needs make living time without worry getting sick passing on. True MVPs essential workers time. admire all. 

Anyway made sure tip well happen, agree. 

But people really need good shake wakeup call.

And, unfortunately, might it. is. It’s contagious wuhan thanks mutation increased spikes. raised generations Americans “I got mine, fuck you”

This long time coming They've got prayers already, really need thoughts Yeah Australia got test done nothing sore throat. politicians urging us get tested even trivial things tests people coming tested. crazy hear places test hospitals.  Funny literally zero plan squash virus besides full scale lockdowns economic catastrophe

Lmao, could every actually-developed nation earth done beat thing back. yes, means, let’s absolutely nothing instead, see economic devastation anyways, pretend options totally hopeless. God euthanizers sick. mention still unknown long term effects catching it. Lol true America continent. parents live Mifflin county (rural central pa) literally one gives flying fuck masks URL trackers. Here's direct link: anyone website tracks hospitalizations whole US? shows state state see way show data across states one picture quite dire seems. April seeing 2k deaths per day. Based that, estimations 250k new infections per day March. testing far worse. 
 
Today, estimations 50k new positive tests means 75k new infections. Deaths still predicted stay ~ 600 per day. 
  
 
It's pretty bad. Extremely bad compared could doing. really bad ""highest record"" suggests. No, way states it. Nobody would assuming last days finished yet. Pandemic got people desperate entertainment see fact posted person let know [Breaking Trump order US Navy Hospital Ship Comfort Arizona help overwhelmed hospitals ""Saying he's open wearing mask""
""Actually, mask sort liked way looked,”

sounds like narcissist intervention play ego get change mind. 

""But sir, look great mask, greatest"" !!! mandatory mask wearing means everyone wears masks. mandate came additional government support attached, requiring insurance companies foot bill least part national testing plan.

Boohoo, they're supposed do? exactly """"""""premiums"""""""" remains unclear employer side would end footing bill tests companies require employees returning work.

WTF. get sick, pay test prove *my* employer I'm okay come, they're ones forcing us to?

America's got another internal pandemic besides corona deal with. No. treat clotting nothing say fog exhaustion. Thank you. tried explaining someone realized couldn’t quite grasp it. thought would double certain part triple something, idea saying lol. Thank you!  delete misleading comment.

Definitely Incan. heart aches rest country, we're abandoned government Ok, I'm liberal, sure sent article related protest. weird. Nice whataboutism deflection though. Someone pulls mask off, pull public place get car keys. call police say there's nutbag car leave. I'd wager 2 weeks. think enough people start wearing masks week, plus holiday weekend starting, takes 1-2 weeks symptoms really show. wears pants shoes almost every day. rare form. Dr. Campbell starts throwing shade, know shit beyond pale. forget CT we've good slowly see positive test percentage go lot people symptoms don’t getting tests, right?

Well happening Arizona 1 3 tested weekend tested positive. Insanely high compared previous rounds testing. r/coronavirus. nuts? 


suffering = good got reg sticker yesterday. Every employee put mask chin. went nuts lysol car after. stickers! /s number right, would bet 20 million cases US right now. Yeah, picking more. finding every asymptomatic person regardless age? many videos posted 40+ y/o's refusing wear masks? obvious mockery.

I note amount evidence presented reason everyone dying they're stressed economy still equal amount evidence people dying strangled masks.

Which say: zero.

Note there's plenty countervailing evidence, deaths spiking previous recessions like 2008. laziness part.

You simple task here, provide single shred evidence. do, pretty clear everyone trying distract mass sacrifice engineered goose stocks.  give .26% chance. Completely serious: many people offended idea wearing mask? Like, authoritarian move? included article headline. 🤔 probably worse even take out, others  [This driver got fired no-masker's b4 freedom fighters sue state already hit 50,000. I'd say end month it'll atleast close 100,000 Ty. It’s like Alabama became country renamed America wife needs angry everyone wearing mask dr. live Mexico, see news TV Mexico primarily yes US reddit.

I seen Mexican “karen” refusing masks and/or throwing tantrums asked so.
I however seen bunch Americans it.


Nobody “shitting average American”. pointing fact that, Americans (not average) tend kinds personality traits. (The ones stated first comment).

And sadly time behaviors don’t affect individual everyone around them. quite possibly indirect world wide consequences. must kissing me. Hopefully, it'll outcome last time couple stylists tested positive, exposing 150 people, one appeared gotten sick it. Crazy think Aus worried one state back ~70 cases day. (While rest essentially 0)

The US level unfathomable me. Who'd thought traditional family unit structure would become competitive again. get stage need ventilator you’re incredibly sick pulling luck. It’s ventilator that’s issue. It’s false correlation. I'm sorry business *really* hope things get better you, Sweden soon. 

Yes, level debate SHOCKING me. participated many public debates Iceland, Finland Denmark (the 3 Nordics closest ties to). example back Feb/March got Danish friends bit irritated strident ""YOU GUYS NEED LOCK NOW"" big deal besides friendly ribbing bit overreacting. tbh right retrospect, locked exactly right time one factors political / social side. 

Compare like debate Swedes side topic *night day*. I've never ever gotten much personal abuse, harassment, childish shit side debate since time used debate climate denialists long ago. 

It's obvious many reasonable Swedish people like (and many friends criical) *wow* side *toxic*. me, anyone becomes critical back down. I've also encounters tiny minority side debate civilly, much appreciated, bad faith typically displayed tends overwhelm entirely. really changed opinon Sweden generally worse, even though know #NotAllSwedes; enough leaves bad taste mouth. :/ Nah dude think missing something. Thanks though. Especially can’t even find map! r/MapsWithoutNZ almost like crowds people mingling streets.  thought might happen, looking Minnesota's numbers, apparently Masks work well. Mostly dual role plays. Yes, it’s 100% effective infection prevention. it’s excellent tool prevent transmission. means rely wear masks. day 49! really loud vocal super minority. Sweden going ""eh trace 'em yourself"" version contact tracing especially ironic since Denmark started contact tracing first voluntary tracing reliant individual. short order found didn’t work upgraded tracing infrastructure. 

Just lol.... I'm getting impression Sweden simply fully commit themselves, almost defeatist attitude I'm feeling.. terrifies most. huge family, equally huge number in-laws, think COVID LiBeRaL HoAx. firmly believe would knowingly attend party. 

My family planning [a 90th birthday Grandma (her church also invited, course). in-laws planning [for big Independence Day weekend I’m tired feeling hopeless. check world asymptomatic viruses ? president* suggested vaccines cause autism official statement. know he's well average intelligence, millions voted him. That's many people running around thinking scientists evil, smoking pot cures cancer, angels real, etc. I’m going honest, obsessed I’ve corona concerns, type situation creeps out. Even though reasons logical good kids dumb irresponsible.   I’ve applied thousands jobs Monster, LinkedIn l, Glassdoor etc. 

Can’t get initial screening call. visa status question kills me. say “American citizen” interview over. 

Even H1B visa freeze, Americans still banned. I’m perfectly capable drunk home. wearing mask I’m not. drinking isn’t issue. stupidity is. even given pallative care. denied food water. guess missed lesson first time! :( Maybe read enough comments, Sweden's case rates lot likely Swede bring Norway way around unless factoring Swedes' travel limitations Norway. worst shortage health care workers. Houston ambulances waiting hour unload patients. bed available. Doctors nurses respiratory therapists not. Remember hospital administrators proudly speak bed availability. pray long hard health care staff.  parents proud ?? opinions matter. What, free speech? /s That's we're fucked thing. Full time American workers need mandatory paid sick leave. know leave covid need sick leave every year. That's think USA bad position. high number cases high number testing. distinctly remember test resources still short supply, like two tigers tested positive? don’t understand getting tested. seems issues related Covid-19 animals would infinitely prevalent news given many Covid-19 infected people likely also pet owners. Weird people work BSL-3+ labs wear bandanas faces huh. counts, ventilators filtration capacity used. let shoot arrows tree approach covid+ positive person surgical mask protect myself.

I happy see studies showing protective benefits wearing non-filtering face covering. irresponsible tell people bandanas make safe presence un-masked potential carriers. Would send grandmother crowded Orlando bar surgical mask right now? legal basis county officials issue subpoenas information relevant public. doesn’t require “legal basis” contact tracing, whatever means. need into, someone it, therefore issue subpoena. also last year another disease outbreak. big bowl Skittles door may work too. ""What flavor get?"" Technically assholes dont need mask, face. So...you right. India's recovery rate around 60%, total numbers look high, lot recovered. Deaths around 15k. getting around 20k cases 13k recoveries per day  You’re allowed use Wikipedia college. learn alternate fuel sources college World Environment courses. studies besides one Chinese study long antibodies COVID last for? 

The Chinese study like 37 symptomatic asymptomatic patients found antibodies disappearing 2-3months. need remove “unless distance 6’ more” mandates. wear one times public space. Period. Empathy Two things come mind this.

This new chicken pox party.

Is game? game. Okay sorry speaking different contexts! meant public terms access, meant public terms ownership. Sorry confusion! kids show symptoms? How'd even end getting tested? doubt many kids even tested lot asymptomatic. able buy fire water insurance employer way cost spread among larger group. pay third party company interest house pay fire water. 

The fire department can't tell exactly would pay per gallon water, fire water insurance negotiate set price pay behalf. makes great deal lot savings you! event house catches fire fire department bill insurance number gallons used. fire, bill insurance $2.60/gallon used 30,000 gallons. That's $78,000 put fire. Luckily, fire water insurance allow $1.20 per gallon water. That's $36,000! wait, $40,000 fire water insurance deductible.

Because deductible fire water insurance apply $36,000 toward annual deductible leaving $4,000 left would pay another claim year. annual deductible met would responsible 40% amount allowed. claim owe fire department full $36,000 allowed insurance. met deductible fire water insurance would paid $21,600 would owe $14,400. 

It's great deal. pay premium fire water insurance pay anything meed onerous deductible, met deductible still get got pay onerous amount, least insurance negotiated lower, still ridiculous, price you. happen work lose fire water insurance owe fire department full $78,000. really depends especially we're talking COVID.

If small veins starting fill blood, beginning, looks like inflammation.

It's likely inflammation we've seen evidence sometimes closer pneumonia becomes pneumonia.

It entails sinking kitchen paper towels salted water solution (including drop dish soap), letting paper towels completely dry. sad news then. Almost every medical professional, EMTs doctors, detaches extent. I've volunteer firefighter medical responder 11 years now. seen number deaths ICU doctor might (maybe 100 11 years), even still detach emotionally. don't, last. looks like reopening going well ""reliance students follow ..."" 


lol. 

RIP, 

but students lining bars downtown daily, summer breaks. excuse is, what, everyone gonna get talk China, protesters go never ending rant numbers fake. ICU already capacity DFW. state politicians

Relatable. Personally EXACTLY want receive care from. want doctor mental breakdown middle surgery. doctors emotionally detach--especially situations like one--they would go insane. think anyone operate high-stakes situation judge coping mechanisms (as long coping mechanisms violent/illegal, course). article mentioning triage prove decision made triage. seems likely doctor decided save hospital space another patient. hospitals Texas full right now? Oh yeah, sorry that, really meant S.America US didn’t want people thinking thought N.America US dumber ones seem think they're invincible reason, can't fathom country reached point kind attitude commonplace. vaccine found, herd immunity next step every where. report Sweden reckon actually closer herd immunity cells, tho concrete evidence yet. still early say Sweden failed know what's going vaccine Imagine laws like this. “Please don’t murder people, it’ll bad society, we’re scared make real stand murder know it’s sensitive topic”. come AZ?? Umm ok. merely forgot mask intentionally refusing wear it, offered sold one instead kicking out. thought couldn’t get worse Tide pod challenge. 10.6 million lost per article.

Lol like Harrisburg. little asian stripmall banh mi place pho place killer. chinese place history lesson dishes.

You guys cool little central outpost civilization. Surrounded terrifying still. ensure driver wearing one times? good friend works Uber Lyft, unfortunately committed believing mask conspiracy theories. know complying requirements? people may be. also got best. Personally I'm shocked outcome. I've read abnormally high number deaths far year, upwards 120,000 reported coronaries related. realistic could distribution year global. I’ve personally read heard symptom, definitely consult doctor though get tested haven’t already last winter 100 years ago I’m pretty sure kid thing virus hadn’t mutated damage yet, crazy community spread. governors want people put kids back school smh Good thing listen science. Nah doubt that. surprising given city large ""we need haircuts"" protest April Correction...worst pandemic far Almost Howard Dean, YEEEAAAAHHHHHHH locked discussion. That's unique symptoms complete loss oxygen proceeded. fuck wrong people? Don’t worry Jesus, you’re one good ones. due asthma. used inhaler it’s lot better now. Heart rate stabilizing. walk around mostly okay. gotta avoid stairs. Canadian, I'll point finger Brazil US. Things going pretty well overall north border. two new cases province last several weeks. Plus maybe gap graduations, they'll actually able find jobs! ER yesterday husband due car crash (he’s fine now). coughing hacking heard various admitted coronavirus infected rooms night long really fucking scary. worries Thank god countries like Denmark, Finland &amp; Norway saved image Scandinavia. countries succeed, Sweden's PR image going toilet, Sweden probably would've dragged entire region it.

Its also similar dynamic played around world too, competent countries leading way provided massive image boost region. example, Korea &amp; Taiwan saved Asia's reputation China debacle, Australia &amp; NZ saved Anglo image Canada kinda saved North American PR US bungled badly, think everyone ignoring Canada tbh... unaware dogs could get it. dead cat bounce temporary recovery asset prices prolonged decline bear market followed continuation downtrend.

Seems right money me. treat masks like seat belts start slapping people fines wearing them. That's bullshit. want spend time money anything. Parts, building supply NYC stayed open pretty much barricaded entrance talked customers door. Middle aged people, fans 30 years ago. half probably going watch TMNT 2 instead.  Lina Hidalgo, Harris County judge. Abbott hamstrung her, Houston shitshow. Yes \o/ Pilot...

It’s really sad it’s first time went quarantine... *ICU ICU baby* masks politicized could much better Ha Ha. NFL too. Play games 2 distant Canadian cities! put television. bit scheduling challenge, 2 teams played Wednesday, give least 5 6 days like normal, could actually games every night week!!! Gotta think outside box! 

This article says NFL would lose 5.5 Billion play games without fans. cynic says business usual them. That's lot money pay fallout. ( Sick players, coaches, fans ) anyones guess point. Well said fates worse death. like picture dude saying every era. 
“Alcohol ingrained Iron Age culture it’s really getting annoying.” Something tells probably don’t care much pandemic triggered people protesting Slight understatement Dr. Faucis credentials: 
"" 2003, [Institute Scientific stated 1983 2002, ""Fauci 13th most-cited scientist among 2.5 3 million authors disciplines throughout world published articles scientific journals"". Well silver lining quite obvious. We'll never second wave! food time seeing someone came hospital jogging place many people around, would say no. I'm one enforcing either officially peer pressure, really know sure.

However, based know virus, briefly passing someone outdoors spread virus. Sounds like playing real world Catan live Italy, we've battling crappy pandemic bit longer America. There's difference us tho: country told shut ""muh freedom"" shit wear mask wanted survive this. accepted sacrificing bit ""rights"" know, also obligations and, important, believe ""my freedom ends begins"". think americans stressed people? think people Italy weren't? actually, one Europe was? 

No. went shit. suffered stress able leave house get basic things live (food, mostly). suffered ""oh god, can't breath mask!"" crap. However, got shit together, decided better suffer inconveniences rather country full covid everywhere count deaths hundreds thousands.

Americans, hand... I'd rather see people beach throwing house parties. Lol shit hole I'm thankful RI businesses seem taking seriously. mask? entry. Full stop. people wearing masks outside sometimes still move away passing sidewalk. Although lot people eating resturants least still 100% outside take-out. 

Some lowest numbers country right now. hope keep way. worry people states coming spreading again. I'll happily welcome evidence-based peer-reviewed paper factually proves effort deceive public major academic journal gets published.

Before time: let's agree disagree statements made. Triage rules prohibit withholding care due disability perceived quality life. checked, India 200,000-300,000 tests per day, number still increasing. hopefully good now. #Publicerad 01 juli, 07:27

They've told one group locked away life better. putting restrictions life.These people caused rights, guns freedom. Putting fear people works immensely.

Everyone's chins well protected. worry anectdotes ones coronavirus? fair, think audience already CDC gathering guidelines. I'd probably pissed up, remember: actually would even go Vanilla Ice concert? Cool, get FUCK out, missed! for-profit capitalistic system RIGHT NOW. know intelligent cousin fuckers Alabama get blinded politics! Nope. India got 1.3 billion people. unfortunately democractic.

What hell going south border? see Americans blaming Trump idiotic state leaders tried open early, them. chunk American public dumb rocks comes acknowledging COVID-19 real thing. one country dropping ball much every conceivable level? Thanks! YeH, people forget point closing schools isn’t much protect kids stop community spread. One parent town gets it, kid brings school, bunch kids bring home multiple households. paraphrase Rand Paul: ""We listening experts."" ok disagree Sweden comment perfect example understanding Swden did.

Sweden COULD done Norway did. decided it. made risk assessment. Norway, Finland, Denmark essentially pushed chips middle table; virus burn Oxford vaccine shows good efficacy 3 nations ""win"". either 2 things occur shits creek. 

They would close borders go lockdown indefinitely none 3 built immunity up. would quite literally stay holed winter. 

Sweden decided dangerous risk worth it. Sweden found far likely happen does. Historically would accurate. reality actually 3 nations took ""riskiest"" strategy Texan here. Trying safe even though 

1) forced back work unessential job cheap labor.

2) Noticed 10% people around (I live DFW) wear masks social distance.

3) Noticed people go way break social distancing mask rules work 

4) ridiculed, laughed at, verbally harassed, called sorts names I’m half Asian wear mask.

5) Put fiancé she’s, well, fiancé.

6) zero leadership.

7) scared shitless. anxiety depression disorders situation quadrupled issues.

I hope best. Guys, please, wear. A. Fucking. Mask. Someone didn’t believe said people idiots crowding around back Memorial Day weekend would spike cases wreck 4th July weekend events. Amazing little common sense people have. Despite allowing seafarers join leave vessels, shore authorities workers still allowed come board facilitate cargo loading discharge. small business owner recognizes change lot places. one daycare changes accommodate schooling model, others follow suit remain competitive. seems mention - I'm looking solutions trying optimistic mean recognize strain puts people. would rather spend mental/emotional capital looking solutions silver linings rather focusing worst this. I'm tired living constant bitchfest. reddit. know world fucked up. really do. despite that, us still lot positives lives. important now, ever focus those. tested positive virus following medical professionals guidelines, waited ""run course"" got tested two times, workplace needs two negatives allowed come back. told likely early surprised I'm positive. I'm wondering numbers slightly inflated reason alone. Maybe not. staff must properly guess new scent everyday. 
Just rotation scented markers. RIP. 

We would prefer Mark Cuban. Im fortunate. work home, take care couple kids teach mental health taken severe nosedive. average person right recognize that. Yeah know difficult enforce. live they've definitely laxed temperature taking/questionnaire outside entrance except places medical care centers. actually read comments, find I'm complaining, merely explaining article. talking small, loud proportion people. Social media magnifies them. That's contention. think fair denigrate us actions few. Labs overwhelmed, massive numbers people can't get tested decline they're told results take 5-10 days... 4.8 million gained 1.6 million lost. Curious public transportation like subway looks like NYC right now? empty bc people working home? people masked 6 feet apart? closed? Ebola airborne. Covid19 much infectious/insidious Ebola. need honestly. Every day ""highest record"" ""highest spike"" also said computers 1990s article sentence. vouch yes, yes did. certainly did. someone explain exactly “second wave” is? Cases high, went down, they’e back higher before, people scared second wave simultaneously scared current situation hand? terrible arbitrary designations first wave, second wave, even mean anything People always call news cops health department. Covering sick kids shouldn’t blamed government. didn’t parents pediatricians notify anyone? K buddy whatever say, Canada we've known since March assume countries actively trying kill population would know it. can't wait next month guys realize social distancing reduced spread infection *dies Live normally strenuous exercise couple weeks. 

I want get PSA blood test done asked answer I'm asked doctor I've contact virus. told say live vaccine. 

There chance could received placebo blind trial. 'pro life' means 'pro-punishment abortion' nothing else. Reopening schools anytime soon fool’s wish. becoming quite obvious shoving people indoors together best way spread virus. Schools need stay shut it’s harsh reality parents college kids need accept. extremely active /r/politics and, matter personal political bent, impossible deny slanted. essentially non-stop DNC press release. fiercely, relentlessly aware fact, otherwise perception reality inevitably warped.

Hey dug post history turnabout fair play. Still, see preference elves like jerk relevant. protests greatly contributed spread. People wearing masks contributed spread. say BLM morons morons wearing mask contributed spread. Please stop sounding dumb. Yes, understand system! E.g. one linked article: början av juni gav kammarrätten Jönköping bakläxa till de åtta kommunerna så att de tvingas ta upp Sörmland Medias begäran igen. 

 
So municipality give numbers! Great apparently system worked out! you’re taking sick leave allergies basically don’t get go work spring.

I don’t think makes lot sense policy.

Yes need sick leave, really need pandemic trivially easy get test. Sorry... read wrong... Thought died recently. 

But right. Triage comming get ugly boyfriend made comment personally know anybody raped. told quickly absolutely did. cousin. introduced cousin cousin, rape victim. would never introduce rape victim. cousin love her. That's I'll introduce her. remember look horror face realized idea many women knew victims rape not.

Chances know many rape victims know who. hard fought race 50th Mississippi barely edge don’t believe there’s context response justified, that’s ideological thing we’ll agree disagree Wishing continued good health 🙏 say all, one said card rooms popular would disagree Wtf nonsense? fucking competition?? Awwww! new generation morons coming age prepare follow footsteps elders...

Brings tear eye thinking it... They're trying mass test Nuevo Leon, drive thru places different parts state, specially Monterrey Meto area. Denmark definitely one, easily apparent one quick google search.

I talking specific countries, though. Denmark Norway make less 0,1% world population. certainly seems thing world, least Europe.

Saying ""many quitting"" indicative either, neither articles talking stress fatigue sector. better indication would perhaps compare pre/post numbers equally heavily attacked countries, ideally wait months compare Swedish pre/post numbers (if pandemic then).

Numbers really matters conversation, matter many articles link, give clear picture. It’s July 4th yet chill numbers. child born 2010s good life.

This needlessly dramatic! going sucky times right now, people lived Depression good lives afterwards, people lived fucking Holocaust good lives afterwards. They'll live rough times too. Honestly case mostly empathy. live really conservative third world country really subpar education. yet, go out, see 90% people wearing masks.

It's really odd mask issue became political issue US. here, political tendencies irrelevant comes wearing masks. People use common sense wear protect others. 

In large part think people really respect elders want protect them. Americans bigger tendency abandon elderly. operating logic, never leave house fear struck lightning, also ""very rare."" masks hamsters. get wear masks, put masks outside cages. Yeah, tell New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan, Iceland, etc. Test, Trace, Isolate working well almost half year them. 

The Cell thing probably bullshit. reminds Stanford santa clara study got everyone's hopes up, way presented, small sample size, questionable methods, lack accounting certain variables, etc. thread Swedish researcher good overview flaws flawed conclusions many lept grounds (though all! many): bro. Everything worse poor people. book 1491 excellent read interested Native American history. gives perspective Native peoples country bustling thriving pre colonization. territories vast heavily populated. peaceful population traded freely surprisingly hunter gatherer, mix hunter/gather/agrarian deep understanding nature functions. Often relying permaculture systems natural guilds agrarian needs. outlined heavily Tending Wild, also illustrates intensive forest management using controlled burns clear underbrush propagate plants animals within given territory well prevent massive forest fires like see today. massive societies, like usually portrayed TV movies.

Once finish books, I'll advise couple happened colonization we've almost lost culture aid us fighting many problems face today society. 

To finish, Starlight Tours Canada truly disgusting illustrate racism pointed toward indigenous peoples day. striving ignorance topic. achieved it.  Racism incredibly prevalent toward group people what? comments came across bad jokes poor taste. Maybe full hate, today's climate, show ignorance topic. Happy reading!  Ok Got corona cut deaths lack ventilators. Even generally healthy ppl gonna die. Fauci certainly smarter guy, Fauci lost credibility me. fixated fact doctor rude, ruse robotic, job do, let without attacked. day day weather, anywhere near 100C. 0-100F matches typical weather conditions fairly well gives better resolution (because temperature range broader numeric range). 1 degree Fahrenheit resolute 1 degree Celsius without without dropping decimal point. similar argument Celsius beats Kelvin day day use (obviously decimal point aspect, wants say ""it's 302 degrees today"" ?).

Celsius's 100 boiling point water nice cooking/science/whatever, weather, arbitrary imperial units are. ""easy maths"" aspect metric system overly apply talking weather either. Perhaps partly momentum used fahrenheit, I'd rather arbitrary 0-100 range conveniently align typical observed weather conditions, rather compress -10 35 so. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ No, also blame doctor. shitty excuse professional person. ...most cancelled summer, leaving parents stuck. Argh. ...most cancelled summer, leaving parents stuck. Argh. “chicken pox party” comparison keeps getting thrown around. Chicken pox extremely well-documented.


COVID-19 still new long-list complications could potentially last decades longer. intentionally getting antibodies COVID-19, giving lung scarring decades wildly, **wildly** stupid. Yeah, numbers last face exponential growth virus. flu vaccine's effectiveness vary every year? flu earlier year even though vaccinated.  McManager 90's. Back restaurants' Drive-Thru averaged 56% sales think McD's average 50%. kick-ass Drive-Thru kitchen team, line barely stops. work effort involved keeping lobby bathrooms clean 44% business always felt silly me. Peters' Drive Calgary drive-thru sides building take windows, lobby. That's way run things maximizing employee resources serving customers instead cleaning them. stop those? salons, Newsom? girlfriend want go back work again. Intergenerational warfare. Lol. Panic porn know bar 70%, hard attain 50% effective? 50% effective mean, half people caught get it? want live planet anymore Lt. Dan President Trump United States Alabama! Tell every country around world holding classes. 

The reality is, school happening. 

That’s reality, sport Yea less we'll call progress. Steve Doocy saying wear mask Fox Friends tide turning bad person arguing entire developed world except America shit together. Sweden one example definitely not. Plenty countries (UK, Netherlands, etc.) lower mask usage rates US well. I'm saying US great, let's act like rest western world either. one always lick sides mask i'm done it. wonder Canada open boarder Americans Didn’t CDC estimate 5-8% infections detected, likely 10 times many total cases detected? results speak volumes Iirc tiger showing signs respiratory illness (and maybe one keepers workers positive?), tested tiger.

The tests vets use arent human tests, like ""took"" test human test tiger. Read article. says wife agreed intubated, doctor didn’t want *anything* patient. sent hospice left alone 6 days, starved, left dead. sound even worse right-leaning mouthbreathers country. 

The good people hope people like go way idiots. Dead virus outdated &amp; pushed side. Hatred division real enemies. Yup Statistics easy. need take account vastly different demographics amongst country. There's also availability healthcare services infrastructure needs transport people. mention dominant industries (tech vs manufacturing) well share wealth amongst population. Also, must forget government response think ideas particularly controversial subreddit, expressed info less confrontationally, received way.

There frequent discussion covid19 subreddit whether shifting demographics / improving medical interventions driving decrease death rate (or whether we're premature assuming, issue raised). point doctors make rational decisions, don’t rude someone who’s spouse dying. found coworker it. got back business trip together :/ Ah, infected guy *did* know people barbecue Yeah know death panel stage. heartbreaking still 6 months Correct. didn’t necessarily “fuck up” resulting numbers. We’re big country. states areas gotten first wave places like NY seeing theirs. Virtually every state shut regardless infection hospitalization statistics, mainly everyone else didn’t “killing grandma.” restrictions lifted, areas seeing first wave now, restrictions prolonged first wave. Individual European countries gone numbers much smaller spread out. ""It go away, like came, it'll go away."" POTUS Thanks protests people gathering without masks! England here. Believe me, dumb. protests cause spike. would going things cause spike? obvious many reasonable Swedish people like yourself

i ain't even swedish. moved years ago. really think there’s people congregating card rooms gyms though? wear things they're effective, options completely ineffective. get that, right? mother 82 make wear P100 respirator going grocery store town one case last three weeks. Oh we're bottom list? Sounds great! died June 11 hospice six days. decision deny care made later June 5, well hospitals reported reaching capacity. Triage explain happened here. Frankly I'm skeptical widow's account paints complete picture.

That said, triage rules coming going ugly painful. zero idea said particular q&amp;a. Sometimes saying something nice gentle doesn’t get point across dealing irrational, grieving people. talking about? look California. one statement completely proved point wrong. ok say 100,000 people grouped together spread virus. would say large groups people spread virus? science deniers reddit? Science tells us groups prolle high chance spreading virus more. Science tells us this. 1 mile away somebody it, get it. possibility. 2' away someone, chance getting it. Science tells us this. Doctors tell us this. disagree science? believe saying also believe vaccines work. Listen me. Doctors science say vaccines save tons lives. need make sure kids get vaccinated. save lives. I'm getting tired science deniers. costing people lives. Stop acting ignorant start listening professionals. time start helping rest humanity. way thinking scary. ""kids carry virus"" ""virus over"" mentality. People using HIPAA excuse wear masks proclaim tell why, let seated Applebees. Karen move. Yeah agree! feels quite nihilistic. They're behaving bit like Eeyore ""Why bother? What's use? Everyone get virus eventually anyway even try really?"". frustrating! like KNEW came said going build TTI infrastructure they'd fuck lo behold are. :/ yet.  returning trip, Legny Rodriguez said brother ran fever self-quarantined except got tested. days later, brother mother came Santana seemed rebound fever, June 20, Saturday, started gasping JFK Medical Center, texted family friends said oxygen levels otherwise feeling stable, sister said. night time, texted doctors put CPAP help breathe couldn’t talk. Yes have. Sweden excellent control group minor restrictions never imposed more. 

Sweden's decline since April. virus burned out.

Denmark's tracing program functionally worthless. virus cannot contained reaches level at. South Korea far robust trading program struggling contain virus even though literally dead dozens hundreds cases.

Denmark looking literally tens thousands cases.

If covid emerges fall Denmark close borders go lockdown indefinitely. Test trace fantasy scale. totally utter waste money security theater make look like something protect people. I'm talking policymakers' decisions. think laymen heard news Canada thought ""ok well symptoms time go out!"" naive. Thats good point, labor high % operating costs cutting staff except cooks 1 2 front house save much rest menu profitable.

Also I've seen, restaurants seem 1) raised prices bit 2) changed menus take-out friendly, also tend simpler/easier make package up. assclowns like Desantis blaming people believing leaders thinking safe go out, call masks pointless tell people safe blame exactly said okay do. 1.5% open neither? Maybe Astros cheat way 2020 Feel good World Series win lol think missed recent news Korea Family mine FL unable get tested due testing limited two days week, appointment basis...

There's nothing slow testing process. getting cases /$  Darwin award parties. BRASIL NÚMERO UM RUMO AO HEXA BRASIL SIL SIL GOOOOL FUTEBOL Rather job day. pandemic taught us anything continue mouths feed amongst growing unemployment. healthcare social systems cannot handle it. see win one perspective. Want reduce global warming. Reduce size future populations, providing jobs green sectors today school going back fall like nothing happening. masks, social distancing, nothing. mean kids it’s low risk, risk bringing someone else. Good them. Good parents. Good you. makes sense know illness better treat it. 

I wonder many died Italy/NY could lived today :( make anyone’s cheat tight? one else get pissed reading this? want slap fuck heybo wearing ass rednecks . covid I’m 21 healthy issues noticeably different type sickness anything had, you’re weak shit knock out. feel like got close chest tight We'll need learn ""live"" virus order economy stay afloat. Businesses need learn adapt restaurants moved take out/outdoor dining. think grocery stores, maybe retailers could remain open 24 hours customer shopping staggered glut crowd shoppers one point time.  might keep grocery chains afloat hiring shift-based workers, etc. 

Restaurants might begin making drastic changes buildings/rental spaces, perhaps installing negative pressure air flow systems, maybe seating individualized, facing wall reduce direct spread droplets one another. Public restrooms may need change contactless, motion sensored soap dispensers/faucets. everything competition murricans federal government never did. administration told November things horrible China: US offered millions masks January. Trump administration turned offer down.

A Texas medical supply company told federal government could make 1.7 million N95 masks US per week — order came. Murphy @ChrisMurphyCT · Feb 5 left Administration briefing Coronavirus. Bottom line: taking seriously request emergency funding, big mistake. Local health systems need supplies, training, screening staff etc. need now. hydroxychloroquine lobbyists seem effective bamboozling money authorities drug seems Covid-19. bother commenting article havent even read?   open roads connecting every state surrounding IL, population loves summers dunes, think going impossible reality. This. I'm Dallas county thrilled steps local officials taking closures mask requirements. last week Abbott totally countermanded them.

Governor Abbott totally responsible this. Umm, universe title thread solid science Newton's laws? thought ‘of course it’s decreased- everyone vacation going lake cabins’.  opened bars cinemas yet. I'm sure they'll Florida man here, average wait time local hospital 10 minutes, slow day. I'm sure numbers real. compliance higher, win even aren’t effective.

But reading it.


Amesh Adalja, M.D., pandemic preparedness expert Johns Hopkins Center Health Security, says, “There's lot least biological possibility suspect [shields] definitely better homemade face masks, maybe even better types masks well, prevent spreading … [and] also covers eyes, provides protection mucus membranes face might getting Overqualified  Nice It’s true. currently living Italy. Air conditioning banned indoor public spaces. It’s big deal like America Italians don’t like AC anyway. think makes sick (gives cold). Honestly? think thinks cover up. Yet California closing beaches. Good luck New York, say hello another wave covid  Every time there's mention vaccine trials Africa virtuous posters appear complaining Africans exploited. rubbish. vaccine already gone safety trials, first tested British citizens. trials Brazil too. expanded South Africa, good idea. tests Africa people would complaining ignored.

It's like virtuous posters regard African governments African citizens stupid know they're getting involved with. No, they're well informed well aware they're joining scientific trial potentially lifesaving vaccine. DeadBaby going place peace It’s chose America Expect news drop long weekend won’t reopening yet. way people long weekend stock trading digest info take 10% haircut right away saying 4th next ""fuck you"" 2020. feel bones. course gives exception religious services. Fuck Fuck me! That’s Brazil numbers y’all keep walking around without masks. * Alabama

Also, count people actively seeking work? unemployed currently seeking employment - - because, mean look around you, want working - - counted unemployed. governor Texas dropped mask mandate limit public gatherings 10, yo. That's canceled. Again, sad care little life others (50+ million deaths spanish flu btw) forget ""Come Take It"" masks! Even worse then, bother posting it? read articles use ""may"" headline that’s actually sick don’t forget campus students signed apartment lease person could lived home without flip flop plans really know hot zones rising accelerating cases like US who've re-opened offices &amp; businesses extent. Europe &amp; Asia they've tamed case load manageable level chances encountering someone Covid positive fairly low. places like LA they're estimating greater 1 100 active carrier soon. Anyone deals public constant flow clients high-risk. Ohio!! well! Actually acknowledge Geneva’s findings later write up. simply say still don’t consider driver transmission. Kind talking sides mouth really. easier fuck up. amount people grab masks pocket immediately touch door handle without sanitizing damn high. People constantly touching face on, washing them, etc. maybe aren’t quite effective clinical settings, general public practice, good chance better. Plus comfortable, compliance higher, higher compliance good thing, even aren’t effective.

Here reading it.

“Amesh Adalja, M.D., pandemic preparedness expert Johns Hopkins Center Health Security, says, “There's lot least biological possibility suspect [shields] definitely better homemade face masks, maybe even better types masks well, prevent spreading … [and] also covers eyes, provides protection mucus membranes face might getting Nope societal consequences worth it. think closing going real option unless something going kill several percent whole population, isn't.

It would in-danger-of-civilization-ending bad get described. Deaths lag behind testing. Median time symptom onset death 3 weeks. takes week less get test results. Additionally, demographics contracting disease matter. current increases Florida seems skewed towards younger people. That's going proportionally decrease real time CFR. stop 69 420? pretty rare though, it?

There studies show lung damage, dont really comment much impact life. Smoking also permanently damages lungs, doesnt life-quality effect damage becomes substantial. simple ""damage"" necessarily ""debilitating health impacts"".

Other horror stories, find almost illness.

Here woman got flu caused arms legs use horror stories illustrate typical outcomes.

I think vast majority people Covid *dont* suffer debilitating health impacts. mean .. millions people Covid. think many suffering debilitating effects?

Where they? silent? Next UFC. Yes , takes even weeks hospitalizations lead deaths. 

Everthing really course coming disaster death, plus random organ damage survivors (projected 10 50% havent able figure why). literally problem I'm assuming John Wick fly United wonder overall excess deaths curve mirror rapid rise covid19 cases. bet will! Hcq requires given early effective. Early dosage requires prompt accurate testing. Even effective lack ability give effectively aren’t able give early right people.

So worthwhile real world testing takes 5-7 days? isn’t. Fuck trump pump dump. Daycare they’re 11-13 Nationwide side locker rooms bigger issue pools themselves. Pools jammed packed chemicals, long aren’t spitting right someone’s face... ehhh... 

Locker room limits essential want open pool, along limiting pool capacity. Wow spent $300 VIP see hero live 😫 state area. think take lawyer sort out.  I’m crying 🤣🤣 LOL daily payout... one choice get $1000 every day. that's $30k total.

In another choice get 1¢ first day (it's hand), 2¢ second day (so 3¢ hand), etc. Way worded makes sound pretty clear cumulative. “The population-based study found non-allergic asthma heightened likelihood severe Covid-19, allergic asthma not.”

Huh, that’s strange. girlfriend asthmatic I’m gonna keep date research. seem confused I'm responding rate growth probably accurately represented numbers have

 simple math

Queue response. god's name got individuals tested representative population large regardless testing capacity mind boggling sense arguing point nowhere. right they've shown they're opposite end hill rather indefinitely pandemic mode. Better avoid next ~~2 weeks.~~ 8 months.

Dude's making smart decisions. numbers rising testing more!

Then explain hospitalization due coronavirus?

CHINA!!!!!

~ confused American noises~ SC here. We're close 2k day 19% positive... Yeah, I'd say people Coos County taking seriously still, they're pissed wear masks point streets stores packed Tuesday, order went effect, like ghost town outside store shelves largely devoid anything even vaguely resembling protein. escaped shit hole Texas believe part Texans think it’s great it’s hard leave see terrible is. 

Start south Texas, drive 12 hours north, still Texas. DFW. It’s one giant echo chamber Texas #1 circle jerk. grad school attending conferences get see amazing, clean, naturally beautiful Washington state, California, Colorado even Maryland compared Texas. Hell Oklahoma preferable Texas. grad school left I’ll never go back. Yes, I've read theories think merit. interesting Italy decided ban AC. had? underlying medical conditions, live anyone high risk group (elderly and/or underlying medical conditions), work them. Shut up. 

No shut up. 

No, make me. get they're aggressive though, one year old home. agree compassionate thing would let go, kid home remember died now, might feel like couple years condition worth it. tragedy. ANTIFA GOT TEXAS GOVERNOR!!11 /s Coronacane. 2020 says not?  New Zealand done rather well considering less eliminated there. although obviously also helps isolated rest world US would never done well them. 

But quite alot developed countries bad April May seem somewhat control. mean alot European countries like Italy, UK, France etc serious hotspots 2 months ago cases deaths dramatically peak. eliminated virus spreading like wildfire like US. US seeing decrease cases actually 2/3 weeks ago started dramatically rise again. Since progress made thrown away kinda wish would full dive quarantine. Honestly, sounds fun me. 

I know sounds childish, really. ""Just gonna stay house 3 months cause choice"", sounds pretty sweet. Jesus sub. doesn’t. cdc puts cfr (not ifr much lower) .4%. suppose silver lining [7 day moving average starting turn heres hoping see hospitalizations lag fall bit.

Per friends Houston, appears people starting get message mask wearing hopefully helps lot. expect?

At least putting rule partisans considering it. people never going comply, matter really good ways hit back make things worse. dumbasses get. course. numbers much smaller masks. yet, history forgives FDR reason... get vaccine spanish flu again?

I'm waiting one. didn't. Humanity survived fine. alive either got died got lived. Yes. Caring elderly requires close proximity extended periods inside buildings heard rumor waiting shut till 4th sweet, sweet pandemic spreading tax revenue study, it’s article laymen references source study. Maybe read article commenting next time? wrote bad tweets. Would really go bankrupt it? cost forgoing progress infinitely high, LOL. Technological improvement automatically occur time. could one window get Mars, political exists, right world conditions, people, etc. patient, 

tell landlords, banks. Jesus calling sheep. pleased. life too. Mum worked three jobs one point hit 11 charge grocery shopping, meal prepping, washing, cleaning, looking sister, enforcing bed times. everything done day would homework go bed start day again. 

Basically homemaker house. I'm bitter, made grow fast learned life skills way earlier peers. show death count, right? steady number new cases, deaths begin rise sharply, know accurately detecting cases.

Or maybe hospitalizations also indicator.  agree, don’t think six months ago people thought coronavirus situation would escalate certain extent. Especially considering countries’ governments like ‘chill out, we’ll fine.’ Jesus fuck it’s 5 percent death rate, cdc puts around .3% symptomatic people. matter bad/good. different antibodies whatever worth ruining vacation toilet every 15 minutes. statement uncertainty likely solid science statement certainty. Yet deathrate still trends down. worries! look like idiot future, today lol second-hand knowledge living Florida family friends Italy saying malls, indoor dining etc. open without AC. mom teacher high school, final high school exams (which big deal Italy) person sorts precautions. briefing Italian Red Cross told ""no A/C, fans, combat heat open windows"". know \*official\* ban however. Maybe fellow Italians intervene matter.

A/C apparently booster travel distance droplets, makes (if true) social distancing indoor spaces pointless Nice reasoning fine dandy.

As long effective testing place inform many cases truly are. STILL effective testing ANYWHERE US.

(also; control people flee lockdown areas go un-locked areas, party - spread virus). belongs, dumpster. immunity long lasting, people gain immunity recent infection lose immunity due time. percentage immune people go back forth. Suffering stay though, that's sure. Sounds like party part brain dies 26 lol rising domestic tensions worry almost much COVID-19 honest...it’s disgusting “leaders” seem hell bent division abhorrent actions driving people other, need unity ever before. can’t stand honestly, never way CUOMO Neither influenza, normally track flu season. “The real way forward another shut “ looked California? shut March 1 3 months minimum. Didn’t seem help , anything it’s worse before. really envious Europeans. think long Americans going trapped like this, want weep. followed rules, continue follow rules, received almost benefit it. never hated fellow Americans past months. ruining life, care. Please get educated. remember screaming window started re-opening. remember people telling idiot fine. didn’t want right, still wish wrong. Studies conclude ""about"" ""may"" worth paper written on. Lot places finally getting serious wearing masks. 

It'll get worse couple weeks still mandates new, I'm sure it'll get much worse already is. 

I guess we'll wait see. allowance exemptions makes quick court challenge injunction whole rule likely.

Do source this? counts ongoing issue?

People keep saying stuff like I'm seeing backed science. happening Valar Morghulis ! Happy Spotify Cheese Day r/spotifycheese UV rays proven kill virus open air. also proven virus loads correlated gravity symptoms. Look, Another Redditor thinks he's cool criticizing, without arguments, using pseudo effective sentence. average 6th grader could’ve looked facts would’ve known boom going turn out. bet near future better..as far virus. would ever given science showing us? Given know little future virus? Given people dying MASS numbers? one would bet economic future set facts. sure going see stock market tank soon. People need wake realize “President” isn’t smart man. Honestly, I’m starting think POTUS wants virus spread. Ah, TMNTs. absolutely was. Clay Jenkins top late March/early April Abbott stepped started overriding him. think one worst things US one-man-for-itself mentality, consequences (namely, outsider, dismal social safety net). right, mean imply everyone nutjob, they're every thread spewing bullshit. believe publication  see saying nothing person responding talking about. 

OP saying they're testing enough people sample size pretty good representation normal population (normal statistically normal distribution, normal weird). 

You're talking skewing statistics fit narrative. OP saying current relative percentage positive tests total tests reasonable representation happening throughout state, even among going get tested. 

If go random city 100,000 meet one person who's 7 feet tall, can't assume everyone else city also super tall sample size 1. stick around week come across another 2,000 people they're really tall well, safely assume remaining 98,000 people probably relatively tall compared national average like 5'10"". ignored long. Well least here, two figures spiked correlation many people refused believe result *faster *spreading** *more * infections.** hospital released statements saying exactly that.

And even then, people tried say statement must financially motivated since receive COVID patients. region things locked down. hospitalization lowers reopen. Easy. Ha! Fair point. :)  goofballs saying virus worse flu? move r/Conspiracy ? Sorry Karen. know important you, lol. guess it’s better late never Time people start making paintings skeletons dancing around piles bodies. time, American flags cheeseburgers. Sorry, dude, Harry Potter stuff Universal amazing. Oh, OK. thought referencing really obscure unit there. difference talking packed icus 102% capacity. Blocked reported. would quite different. reactor cannot explode genuinely know allowed know. closer idea would telling people Covid exists. Denialism individual choice Chernobyl choice learn flaw anything would cause explosion. No. Must win election costs.

(I thinking putting /s. realised Rep’s actually thinking) Feels like years ago. US seen benchmark failure. option of:


1. Shut everything completely vaccine businesses people go broke. 12 months 18 months away.

2. Try make sure hospitals run. Limit stuff keep hospitalization requirements capacity. (Current choice)

3. absolutely nothing.


Sounds like wanted option #1 chose option #2? I'm enjoying battle ""Doing something good, exactly strong enough"" Texas Florida right now. Exactly goes show immature many Reddit peeps are. generation never grew never learned live anything like. Young spoiled brats. Yup. prefer listen man suggested injecting disinfectant directly lungs cdc expert. Congrats 👏 Wompwomp.... whitest shit I’ve ever heard think that's frustrating, think bad living nation shit together, controlled virus, sandbagged neighbor thought inconvenient invest effective public health programs. I’m gonna sound completely dumb right ask happened salon owner? Bye fairness, think Dallas one places begging allowed impose local restrictions Abbott like lol, no. Video games definitely encouraged 6 yo learn new words! It’s fun watch.

When strip people identity rebel. think focusing what's going spur compliance ultimately success. want right 100% want save lives?

I view two things odds Outdoor pools seem safer beaches follow social distancing like rules laid article. I'm big fan chlorinated water, case huge plus. Curious state lower number cases, would make sense tests less people symptoms seek testing. many are, symptoms &amp; many cases, enough tests. Hope beach worth shitheads. Science says social distance wear masks...that’s recommendation months. Start listening science get sick and/or die. true we'd see massive spikes reopening EU Asia don't. NBA resuming Orlando, wonder they'll handle it. Absolutely, cases rising without big increase testing. wold guess little 50%. Maybe even 75%

I used think 1/3 like I've changed mind. mean look reddit, post statistical numbers sometimes suggesting something downvoted hate posts come logical arguements. freedom folks wear masks. 

I actually used think crazy toward one political party realize people extremes parties really different one another terms logic emotion.

And people life, half know convince anything want believe true. went donated yesterday, eager find results Well President US proposed “just stop testing” method multiple times. Normally would pretty big deal.  NY 1,000 cases today. Good luck Cuomo. disputing herd immunity phenomenon general. question antibodies long-lasting, re-infection possible (both big ifs) would herd immunity offer real protection particular instance? Except times triage, do. Ah ok. Still thanks, nice reporting. Yeah,Florida vs Italy. Yikes :| hard, people care spread disease. Plus cannot lock elderly sick people up, basic human rights. Plus recent infections hospitalizations younger people well. Definitely go considering Georgia mean seeing quite spike cases getting worse. think today highest figure cases 3,400. Pence Dallas (wearing mask, thanks) sat front 100 person unmasked choir singing right next one another looked pretty risk. many get sick die photo op week ago? career ended killed 6000 nursing homes mean... semblance logic?  Shanghai Disney reopened like month ago problems yet... far.

30% capacity, masks required.

But able reopen China got things control. Florida trying reopen largest surge thus far. wow.

If government wants reopen economy outbreak controlled first. slowdown. Like new cases weeks.

Trying keep economy going right delaying inevitable. good measure, article May describing D614G mutation It’s like pulling teeth lol force feed someone. palliative care involves food. trying intentionally kill people hospice, pain, pain management comes first hospice drugs management symptoms health organs (although likely continue receive treatment before). going take radical steps extend someone's life usually sign DNR admitted. Canadian here. Everyone know talk border terrified idea opening reason COVID-19 eventually goes away. We're well (despite provinces dropping ball April May), I'd hate see potentially infected Americans pour Canada screw everything up. I'm gunna agree disagree, making beef doctors way job go wind untill learn wrong are.  Anti body test suggest immunity last three months Sweden another cull. easy get test. scheduled appointment CVS tested day, never leave car. problem self isolate testing get result means going work. Many workers face upset bosses possible job termination call sick, even legitimate. tried tell boss coming week they're getting covid test allergy symptoms would catch ton slack. often happens blue collar jobs work can't put next day. partly point, NYT held higher standard posting article kind title.

They could easily interviewed people truly impacted childcare situation, article would much effective.

Even though opinion piece, would liked see author article provide perspectives outside own. Except non wealthy people buy mortgages traded market. infection ~~Sweden~~ Texas, Arizona, California, Georgia, Florida, Nevada, Carolinas, Alabama, Mississippi OVER.

6 weeks ago. called triage. It’s best avoided Americans stop dumb fuck. Everyone assumed rest world wearing pandemic global Maybe it’s time wall... keep Americans 

/s imagine there's huge psychological component it. effective flu vaccine last 15 years 60% effective, least 10% effective.  straw man. I’m ok deaths flattened curve lockdown. Bring downvotes call bad person “being ok death” guarantee nobody respond answer many people probably would died 6 months now. started caring way late game stop virus. Hospitals aren’t overwhelmed won’t be. Every single headline ICUs full leaves part majority beds currently full non-Covid patients. right street 100s overflow beds ventilators ready. 

This sub full fear mongering. remember saying back thought even people knew COVID-19 would still go ignorance and, quite frankly, selfishness. Quite people told thought nobody knowingly infected would go parties, bars, etc.

Now, I'm speaking everyone because, clearly, people willing properly engage social distancing proper PPE, etc. But, keeping safe, must always assume percentage people around us amazingly selfish really give F health well-being -- care themselves.

He sounds like really nice guy. damn shame die forgot selfishness others assumed certain level care common sense. heads up, Northeast swarmed murder hornets Jaws actually real, he’s coast Cape Cod. Really reason come vacation, lol shit method philanthropy dig deep fundamentals problems face selectively fund support hopes foster big changes breakthroughs. 

He doesn’t blindly hand money non-profit happens like, mega wealth donors do. Usually schools summer programs. got cancelled summer...which caused much stress. New Mexican, lose rankings fucks every year? laws gatherings sorry people gathering public places wearing masks. know that's hard understand.

There's also evidence places big protests spikes, absolutely see case. Dumb right word. Uninformed better. reckless care losing would mind explaining it’s accurate think way? 

I can't explain markets work. clearly something wrong economy shitter, virus spreading unabated, yet stocks keep going up. screams 'warning' cheap buy. may unrelated guys know subreddit international covid news? want keep date countries want filter 30 meaningless US posts find one non-US post. Sweden even relaxed restrictions. per capita considerably worse US time. 

Incompetence level far reaching implications. lol no. Sweden literally Nordic country saying might big second wave fall. Nordics feel confident cluster outbreaks, contain Test, TRace, Isolate. There's zero need vaccine strategy work. shitty thing people enough health problems they'd fucked triage overwhelmed hospital, much qualify disability, there's government support stay home work. months now, enough time blow savings reasonably comfortable person. job allow remote work, screwed.

If want protect vulnerable people, give financial option stay isolated.  good news doctors learned lot lessen death toll (130k deaths grim lesson). example, they're lot careful intubation, avoiding possible. people still get sick enough need ICU. 

The bad news info comes every day unexpected long-term effects large percentage patients. $ummer camp$ (only operating year) all-day daycare (also $$, operating) paying nanny/college kid watch ($$$). 

I left home alone day starting 9, children handle 12 internet less thing media access automatically limited dependent upon hacking skills vs parents' blocking skills. Actually, I'd worry lot 13-14 year olds alone day 9-10 year old. First wave. delayed lockdown states run idiot contenders first US governor lynched mob constituents. care either really care say. Please keep crying contained corner bedroom. need cry internet. Noone really cares. Keep entertained video games. healthy cry much. data reported? UBI would accomplish making whatever give everyone UBI new equivalent $0. I’ve sent article mum. dad isolating whole time, really good even though she’s practically climbing walls boredom able get out.

These last couple weeks started push it, taking dad walk busy public park suggesting would ok ran house grab things quick. 

The government guidance easing lockdown made previously intelligent careful mother things reckless dangerous could literally kill dad. isn’t things she’s ‘fed up’ lockdown. She’s mistakenly believes blonde haired fuckwit Boris tells safe. makes want scream cry anger. :( sounds like blonde fuckwit side pond making similar mistakes. I'm really worried dying point. I'm worried long term ramifications virus. Reports lung damage, kidney failure, strokes, neurological issues, nerve damage, sick months months. Also worry future insurance companies consider COVID preexisting condition. second lie confusion spread around ! stupid, would preferred even case clear would said: Yeah protects you.

""You wearing protect others"" make many people wear one egoistic worry themselves. ""I'm sick."" mean, also 15-20k tests per day vs 3-6k two weeks ago. surprising, still concerning,I'm doubtful we're growing insanely quick however. percent positive rate pretty flat last 3 months. chinese ccp bio attack think.. could day, literally. telling agree disagree willing pursue dead end debate one ingrained beliefs. Bible belt gonna Bible belt Ha, no. They’re still saying general public stupid use N95. Can’t wait till walk store get one started hoarding masks released information outbreak...

It's way different this. Never glad don’t kids now. know addressing word choice. Yeah let's test, trace isolate rest lives social distancing place. Good dystopian Given intelligence average churchgoer, surprise me. someone please explain WIFE guardian someone else making decisions? Texas dumb?? Adding new baby mix option many. hard truth least half America atm.

True. people feel sorry ones thought means children unable support kids.

My personal view I'm going kids unless I'm rich enough guarantee they'll never work... I'm far enough I'll probably never them. feel comfortable forcing person exist world demands extreme unpleasantness— wasting one's finite time servitude callous, ungrateful elite— condition survival. course, everyone thought way did, human race would go extinct... respect difference opinion. 

Our society vision, sense future. That's treats parents like garbage ignores needs children. negative demand new humans. Choosing opt responsible reaction economic signals. PURE ALABAMA Reality fix season 8 broke seems somewhat one, obvs COVID related. 

""Somewhat"" one?

The Norwegian post-wave shortage high enough they're importing healthcare workers Sweden giving quarantine exemption!

Makes current shortage Sweden seem manageable comparison. Alright Stop!

Ventilate listen. Duh semicolon two statements, related third-party delivery services charge fees drivers difficult. rehost menus get prices wrong. hurting reputation restaurants. 

Then . 

I lots friends restaurant business without exception hate Uber Eats, Door Dash, Grubhub, etc. work less money. semicolon two statements, related show counterprotest without pants, wildly screaming BODY, CHOICE. mistake assuming others common sense decency. Apparently someone party knew didn’t think could spread it. protesters far biggest culprits whole fiasco.

You can't compare thousands protestors entire states easing lockdowns millions citizens. Come bad OP referring to. Hey man, I'm poor (as per government definition poor), girlfriend make enough pay rent get pizza month set little aside. I'd happy treat family pizza want.

Pizza like time favorite thing, I'd happy get guys pizza. many there? without sharing personal information haha.

PM interested. Again, that's post said. said card rooms popular thirty years simply factually wrong.

Edit : check username would shocked entrepreneurs recognize opportunity providing childcare per day basis. could get per kid per day still keeping overall costs families lower, keep attendance lower, use less staff/resources probably still wind similar bottom line now. Headline misleading, completely correct. 
 
Outdoors 6 feet away anyone household? Mask required. 

Additionally, following exempt requirement:
 
1. medical condition, including respiratory issues impede breathing, mental health condition, disability? 
 
2. Work place mask creates unsafe environment determined local, state, federal regulators workplace safety guidelines? 
 
3. Unable remove mask without assistance? 
 
4. 2 years age? (Get Reddit, kid.) 
 
5. Trying communicate hearing impaired person someone another disability ability see mouth essential communication? 
 
Any positive answers exempt anyone statewide rule. 
 
No proof required (Probably would painful produce proof without incurring violations legal protections). There's way majority us catch fast enough- already recovered lose immunity.

Even did, way causes organ damage would sickest bunch mutherfuckers planet, astronomically high healthcare costs. Sigh, one ever thought Korea going contain perfectly. always cluster outbreaks. They'll likely get control, every single time. 

Also Korea still fewer deaths even Denmark bit Norway (and 10x population either countries), let alone Sweden pretty damn well. seen video Texas legislature month ago got released concerned labeled new hot spot incredibly low threshold labeled case now? predicted one month ago would position are.

You don’t even need positive test considered “case”, okay fine.......but everyone contact also listed actual “case” whether symptomatic. 

One person headache low grade fever labeled probable case everyone come contact also labeled CASE!

It’s insane. cops citizens wear noses going disaster everyone going surprised gets bad. Come on, anyone common sense. “friend” traveling Florida visit mom philly. won’t listen . helpful things back it’s bad idea? said got antibody test  fixation again, zero doctor caring patient, deliver diagnoses, care someone tell something tone like, ever think that? way “blaming” group people curious correlation ages. sounds like not! Thanks info!!! learned also happening NY, close NYC. much progress. heartbreaking really. Interesting astroturf added automod bad word list longer seems Nah I’ve noticed too. non mask wearers middle aged. Young old tend wear live. record, I’m middle aged. Ah, yes, I'm sure studies ""prove"" psuedo-science. like ""studies"" 90's demonized forms fat people stuffing full carbs. Also lets acupuncture get rid covid.

Moron. Sandusky? Ok. Well. Im sorry you’re part label.

And I’m sorry happening, truly.

But time don’t feel bad people like woman news article. brought shit upon deserves heartache.

Sucks family suffer consequences idiocy. UFC little different regard though? Fighter tests positive scrap fight card, whereas NBA body contact ""insulated"" like hockey padding and/or optional faceshields. think could spell trouble heaven forbid someone presymptomatic, gets cracks plays game. Unfortunately people politicized disease much refuse look facts. still look Sweden success story. Tan gate BIGGERRR!!!

Sure like dags.. like caravans better low testing (only hospitals), rate positives give good indication size epidemic. point tells seriously ill people getting tested. US like overindulge EVERYTHING!! excess Pandemic???? Oh God whoever gave post awards I'm laughing much Tons people wearing masks. Everybody definitely mask on. say thing reopening. live NC. Guess what, people wearing masks public areas. stores go sign front door says wear mask come in. I'm still going sit say every single person wearing mask virus spreading all. like saying protest. people see wearing mask piece cloth. go anywhere without N95 mask. stupid wearing N95 mask. see morons everywhere piece cloth. Get freaking N95 mask like everyone else. Could've told ya that, used use handsantizer matches high school impress friends classic 'my arm fire' trick Strongly disagree. thing personal responsibility free exist. free exist nobody ever held accountable actions. Nobody rewarded either. Also, yes many reasons people take risks regarding pandemic going bars clubs. young people though, also older people. MSM going bad job terms informing people virus, people general also lazy like engage critical thinking instead rely authority figures politicians doctors advice act. personal responsibility much better everything necessary mitigate harm may come me. Yeah including employees I’m assuming maybe crowd 30? Unless brought turtles. I’d risk covid see rap go ninja watch ninja turtles dance stage it. I’d immediately leave. Yup, CCP started 2003 building bat virus research aiming vaccines side military products... never understood partying aspect US. looks like people cannot survive without going drinks. staying home play ps4 watch film? urgent need leaving house pandemic? 1200 cases normal. Everyone fucking panicking Australia right Victoria 60-80 new cases day (and rest states essentially beaten it). Thanks BLM! know, section country population Sweden going beat herd immunity, sincerely trying stop it, full lockdowns, masks ordnances, etc. smarter country's sense self preservation way better us actually trying stop it. England looks like basics needed, many new cases 10 million pop. (Dallas) metro area. Question, seeing Texas hospitalizations surging headlines month deaths reflecting that? country problem Oregon going problem hotbed anti-vaxers. martyrdom waste us grasp serious virus without martyring anyone. I’m dissolving responsibility - acknowledging significant sacrifice they’ve made. God bless you. I'm impressed made long. WOW thank you!!! amazingly helpful!!! :) smell bullshit. much positivity wished upon backtracked little evidence. probably killed lot people statement. coupd be. but, old adage goes - wait two weeks - deaths tend lag behind. Hoping doesnt turn like Italy NY. Perhaps Doctor end 10 hour night shift. 

Perhaps he/she aspergers.

Perhaps they're douchebag. I'm OK well &amp; agree more. true goes elderly see walking around without masks pretending like isn’t pandemic. Stonks go feel like Trump could fix immediately psa. He's right things though. California New York much higher deaths. Locking gonna help. keep packaging scientific decision people holding grudge research. aren't. People skeptical WHO, CDC political leaders coordinated effort decieve them. That's science. human organizations target derision. “He wore masks,” said. “He wasn’t really going anywhere, why, **when everything started becoming lenient thought okay go immediately, went spend time friends thought okay**. going absolutely needed to, wore mask religiously taking precautions could.”

This right government failing us. 2 weeks, sure. possible explanations: 

1. lag might slightly longer 2 weeks deaths start going day now.

2. Older people may taking precautions increase mostly younger people.

3. New York Northeast actually may way people infected could possibly tested time death rate actually lower currently measured. hope.

4. virus could mutated less symptomatic/more sneaky form less lethal form become dominant strain. commonly happens pathogens evolutionary pressure.  See many STDs like syphilis.

5. Northeast might shut late flatten curve many deaths may result that. case expect deaths rise Texas, Arizona, Florida hospitals full. does. baffling people supporters think simply saying something make true. Sweet! Non americans watching sipping tea Looks like know everyon understand rare mean impossible. rare cubs chances winning World Series current president elected. happened 2016. Probability something mess around with. Sorry hear going through. whole lot us well, helps any. number cases irrelevant. number cases function number tests. Since testing done, course number cases increase. relevant statistics hospitalization rates death rates, time lows. COVID getting hyped media Nightmare scenario NYC doesn’t ask questions protests contact tracing. Even response rates generally low - NYC 40%; Texas 25%. Half Floridians can’t identify source infection. Sure, China outdoor study conditions exposure study nothing like happened protests.

I think what’s likely number infections coming protests, larger effect big slice population concluded pandemic “over” official endorsement participation protests. concluded could whatever want.

Consistent messaging important again, like masks, something authorities fucked again. Spending two days cleaning Aunt's apartment.

😞 Archive ink: shortage care workers become clearer spring ever. foreign doctors nurses, road identification often long.

With help quick education, Sophia home Stockholm tries change that.

- almost given getting job nurse Sweden, says Fwo Yi Tee.

Fwo Yi Tee practicing Karolinska Hospital's head, neck skin cancer department since beginning March, time new corona virus began spread Sweden seriously. ways, infection caused workplace become similar operations former home country Malaysia, first trained nurse.

Partly face masks standard Sweden, long hospitals Malaysia, partly patients become more.

The practice last step towards Swedish credentials Fwo Yi Tee. “I want thank kind teachers, managers friends helped along long journey,” says. 

- floor us become covid department former patients may come us instead. trained quickly receive them, **there many patients per nurse now.** struggling, says department's nursing manager Anja Fält Sjöberg.

During corona crisis, shortage healthcare professionals become clearer ever. Many people laid laid regular jobs therefore given opportunity take quick courses care nursing help. first course aimed aviation personnel conducted Sophiahemmet collaboration recruitment company Novare Wallenberg Foundations.

- saw crisis large groups got rid job shortage people critical industries great - obvious us give grants educational activities participate finance card education well, says Oscar Stege Unger , Director Wallenberg Foundations.

I idea would difficult get job nurse take long get certificate even though educated. 

The players already experience fast track healthcare. Despite lack nurses several medical specialties, often takes many years trained outside Europe obtain Swedish credentials. education Sophiahemmet University Stockholm, 127 doctors nurses degrees countries outside Europe able speed process. 

Including Fwo Yi Tee , trained nurse Malaysia researched emergency care Singapore. came Sweden August 2015 read master's degree global health, hoped start working here. 

- idea would difficult get job nurse take long get certificate even though educated. time, always hear lack care staff, feels bit strange, says.


Finding internship often difficult, much know contact, says Fwo Yi Tee, thinks hospitals clearer information websites. 

After starting process identification [legitimation] learning basic Swedish, applied job nurse - already stopped. Instead, soon employed market analyst e-health startup.

Many foreign nurses doctors get stuck knowledge test, finding internship. Fwo Yi Tee believes road identification complicated compared clear path school system native Swedes have.
- probably never would managed gone Sophia home. find ways get parts needed identification, hardly known start. coherent system, says.

We decided would start tailor-made education speed process Swedish identification. 

Something would facilitate, example, hospitals information opportunities internships, says.

- contact case. Instead referred Employment Service.

At Sophia's home, problem became evident ten doctors one morning April 2016 came private hospital's university, says principal Johanna Adami. Sweden several years, spoke excellent Swedish experienced profession. frustrated. failed get system.

- wake fact many simultaneously countries outside Europe solid education. invited sitting table decided would start tailor-made education speed process Swedish identification, Johanna Adami says.

She hired one doctors help design intensive education program started fall year. 

For four months, lectures internships Sophia home's hospital rotated. Questions ethics, culture, laws regulations raised participants would full understanding Swedish health care system works equipped compulsory knowledge test. course, went mentoring program get help process. 

We read parts together Swedish students - important order network Swedish future nurses. 

The education successful continues enroll students. According university's follow-ups, almost 127 doctors nurses 39 countries completed education far started working progressing process. next group starts September. accepted, students must able speak good Swedish foreign education reviewed National Board Health Welfare. 

- way, able significantly shorten time identification students contribute skills care, says Johanna Adami.

Fwo Yi Tea's internship Karolinska also founded Sophiahemmets education, one course mates already department able advise would contact.

An interview booked, incredibly well prepared for, recalls nursing manager Anja Fält Sjöberg. hand, required ""a little work"", weeks email conversations HR department Migration Board practice could begin.

- took little extra administration get together, since Fwo could start, worked really well. learn think teaches us things too, says Anja Fält Sjöberg.

I close patients, work people. I'm glad finally got chance it. 

For Fwo Yi Tee , important thing participating program getting back motivation.

- started training, almost given getting job nurse here. read parts together Swedish students - important order network Swedish future nurses.

Practice last step apply Swedish credentials.

- lacked proximity patients, work people. I'm glad finally got chance it, says.

Corona nothing man die literally weakest immune system earth. course Alabama I’m tired winning. someone else win while? mean require take log temperature leave house. know enforcing would difficult, that's easiest way tell potentially COVID. news yet still speculation. official announcement expected later.

What notable speculation idea air bridges seems going away, UK allow arrivals 75-ish countries without quarantine reciprocal guarantees direction. came together Harvey though gave 2 fucks other.

Deal it. beach probably one safer areas irt ease spread. Imho- roads lead indoor closed air system areas huge problem. Protests barely moved needle vast majority cities. Places open bars/spas/gyms/offices etc blasting skyward. Unlikely coincidence.

Imho- closing beaches good optics only. Surely they’ve done pretty bad job. people shouldn’t taking medical advice politicians. We’ve never president medical science advanced degree, ever. would think Trump apex Medicine Science? problem people. Millions idiots want believe someone education field. Take Trump away, idiots still reading Facebook posts telling friends “know better”. Take millions idiots away. Trump isn’t elected. point people issue United States. don’t know enough listen salesman rather head infectious disease research. say Trump bad job....but really isn’t underlying issue. I’m married one. Literally, like toddler. “But didn’t happen!”. can’t even. shit.

Anyone subreddit saying “masks protect others yourself” ignorant basic facts respiratory infections spread recommended protection methods slow transmission. accepting things without issue? think examples mine full bs...this slippery slope...if roll kinda stuff excuse others health...tben whats next...i mean...did hear new vague af laws China threw Hong Kong fake guise ""National Security""

This big help containing spread NZ heard definitely one, easily apparent one quick google search.

While agree numbers would interesting, amount HCWs describing quitting burning something dismissed handwave try do. One thing disgusts Swedish response utter lack respect care generally shows HCWs. Try grab these, Jared I’m fear mongering “beware! Second wave coming soon!”

What matter we’re going 40,000-50,000 day Source? I’ve heard parties payout getting sick. believe that? far cancel school? Like countries world reopened schools, number cases community low enough reasonable amount safety ensured teachers, kids, families. Unfortunately US let get way control, unlikely would able open time soon lower spread. take months, probability second wave fall/winter. I’m betting England somewhere 10 - 100x border crossings New Zealand, many people travelling Europe. England would many many initial cases world outside China Italy realized COVID problem. 

They also 14x population 15x population density New Zealand. 

They directly comparable. Oh man US better, they, US, Brazil, UK, Sweden fucked long term policy dealing disease. Italy France fucked early policy, good long term policy.

Norway, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, German, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, South Korea, Vietnam, Japan, many countries implemented good long term policies Absolutely right. I'm really sure folks handling right parents work family around help. someone forced back work ""essential"", I'm server, tell absolutely babied. need regain normality strong restaurants seem like safe way get back business usual. Seem key word. death rate numbers less 1%.

PS, hard published study long-term damage disease fucking people six months. mean it’s definitely both, combinations weeks nationwide protests people ignore CDC guidelines. Exactly. We've known shit airborne transmission months. Every step way people fought fact tried tell public focus hand washing. thing keep somewhat safe indoors N95 mask, enough doctors. refuse invest equipment produce more, opting instead lie public tell ok go restaurants otherwise *they close.* lost much trust government year, little left. 

They want us go spend money businesses close. people flocked bars restaurants **they blamed people went bars, getting sick!!** enforce mitigation rules! 

That's wanted right? Please spend? 

No sick! spend!

Daycare I'm run 12k 15k per year start school. *could* exact position us. literally watched slow moving train slam CA, MA, NY nothing get way. taunted made political stance; followed guidelines concurrently, they'd probably well us. current fatality rates though data trustworthy (ie, beholden political pressure)? 

Serious question, non-American I'm confused statements. global wearing masks ??? looked population density four states controlled growth top 10 densely populated. dont really understand cases contained three cities i.e. Delhi/Mumbai/Chennai. rest country OK already reopened month. recovery rates 60% rising. India slow increase 4 months. Lol smoking pot. You’re still inhaling smoke yeah it’s probably still bad lungs current research even suggests that. it’s dumb assume angels real. Meanwhile people believe ghosts, zodiac signs, “bad vibes” whatever friend mine Bavaria needed one go CZ. 130 EUR. Test within 1 day. Results within 1 day.

This true. made unbelievable progress vaccine development, unprecedented history. three vaccines already phase 3 (AstraZeneca, Moderna, CanSino) like 100 others development. China already approved CanSino military foreign travellers. vaccine, multiple vaccines probably, need pick one safest effective.

Well said US leads world new cases per day - winning! related, result disease. result policy decisions: preemptively shutting routine care telling people avoid hospitals matter what. Sure absolutely, trying generous measured case fatality rate around 5-6% account hadn’t seen latest estimates infection fatality rate (IFR). Reports May hovering around 1% IFR. 

That .26% median IFR several estimates June. 

But even that, we’ll reaching near 500,000 deaths herd immunity required 50%, 4 times deaths currently faced. use current estimate needing 70% herd immunity still low end generally required (more infectious requires herd immunity), kill upwards 600,000 Americans reach herd immunity. immunity wouldn’t last, either - would repeated periodically, frequency inversely proportional duration recovered immunity.

It’s also important remember comparing IFR isn’t really simple apples apples comparison either terms deadliness - straight IFR comparison make covid seem single factor two three worse flu - it’s incredibly infectious.

Our worst flu season recent years got us 62,000 deaths. flu less infectious covid, it’s infection rate reduces significantly summer. Covid might also lower infection rate summer it’s high infectious rate colder months appears allow sustained summer - leading us peaks record numbers despite July. Granted, flu lot things making deadly - vaccines antivirals.

I’m trying disproportionately alarmist it’s incredibly important underestimate virus. effects losing 600,000 people one novel cause would significant. time possible reinfection short, we’ll lose lot aiming herd immunity. Oh boy, ""wait 2 weeks"" argument again. can't keep saying 2 years straight know. Absolutely, I'm sure PTSD COVID quite bad. mean losing parent it, sure, home school?

I think amplify situations already place. kids already sucky home life due rotten parents, it'll even worse now. kids good home life, going clear bad kids. 

Not fair good, mean kids born past decade shitty life matter what. utter bullshit. Antibodies routinely fade. body keep pumping antibodies every pathogen encountered. immune system b cells.

""We discuss either suburb elderly, discussed primarily healthcare,"" says state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.

At beginning March, Minister Social Affairs invited Public Health Authority National Board Social Services exercise dissemination could prevented, one items agenda precisely situation country's elderly housing.

Hallengren today cannot answer questions meeting remember it. think protests nothing you’re absolute moron white supremacists run America want die people America greater claim country white people 

The negligence intentional wait anti vaxxers say lmao.  Guess good evading 😏 absolutely moronic hills choose die ... “We need another lockdown” 

What happens (perhaps understandably) respond politely asking go [four letter verb] yourself?

It seems elderly vulnerable done much better job avoiding virus via social distancing, sheltering place diligent use masks. Use citations make claims like this. 90% claim completely false. short range flights ~1k miles, break even load factor (BLF) approximately 20% passenger load, 20% full.
Airlines pursuing maximization revenue booking planes, nothing less. qualified good news good they're easing way high barriers entry foreign HCWs faced. 

But what's good news numbers shortages, wtf. idea *that* bad: 


* 20 21 county councils shortage undergraduate nurses county councils shortage specialist nurses.

* regions shortage general practitioners, majority also shortage of, among things, specialist doctors psychiatry geriatrics.

* Lack psychologists, specialist doctors biomedical analysts found 19 21 regions, 18 regions also lack dentists midwives.

* National Board Health Welfare asked regions many missing various professions received answers 15 regions. lack total 1,252 physicians specialist expertise, 686 general practitioners, 722 specialist nurses 790 undergraduate nurses.

Mindblowing. wonder compares pre-COVID? true many nurses particular HCWs general quitting due severe strain they've under, *also* true personnel shortage COVID well. Whatever case, disheartening figures. Thanks feedback - fixed it. move? corona epidemic well might kill her, even get it. Get help. wanna right lol Except evidence running errands/getting takeout drive spread?

It looks issue mostly large, indoor, social gatherings.

Since “social” isn’t strictly key, I’d expect offices similar issues.

How fast get answer efficacy depends quickly see appreciable difference control treatment groups, everyone control group covid next week 3 weeks still one treatment group it, we’d know then, likelier result difference subtle take little longer, specifically choose places poorly containing virus it’s possible we’ll get signal sooner later Kminder 90 days them. live Florida, support DeSantis.

Again already said apologize doubting ever ever ever again. virus deadly doesnt make people sick, thus leading large scale complacency. Also due fact illness fairly mild time noticed outbreak huge vulrable eventually widespread rnough, seemingly random begin diw droves. Yeah, Brazil May 20th, Brazil doubling 2 months.

India doubled less 1 month. 

India's growth rate twice high Brazil's, things getting bad. India can't get rate back down, going snowball quickly. dumb Yes, CFR represent death rate. represents much testing going on.You asserting 5% people get virus die. completely incorrect, still believe you’re fool  Suicides, domestic violence, sorts bad things rose shutdowns, sure, it'll ""sweet.""

It’s coming..in 2-4 weeks time. Feel free compare president's response developed nations currently dealing exact outbreak exact virus. Early works. 

Why think death rate dropping? 

We aren’t treating people NyQuil Tussin Reread sources. numbers off. live NW Indiana, everyone lives town wearing masks, plenty work Chicago. Indiana poorly overall think that's dumb luck, fellow Hoosiers pretty stupid. Watch out. ...whoah Stop nice idiots. Call public health terrorists are. already know kids spread virus. Numerous outbreaks schools daycares. course, fall ramps states don’t believe science open classrooms again, evidence overwhelming. hate Trump. liberal, consider Biden hard pill swallow. 

But come - root leader right thing. tomorrow Trump like ""I'm going sign executive order setting framework begin Medicare All"" could comb motivations potential ulterior motives good, I'd like ""hell yeah! suck everywhere else, got one right.""

With said - fuck Trump HCQ promotion. promoted due financial interests early potential promise knew nothing virus, drug works virus matter. improvements highly conditional marginal best (it works, all, start treatment early, testing time takes long work). 

He deserve talking point because:

- really good treatment
- failure manage whole situation resulted massive problems testing (and everything else).

But take away he's Trump - that's type shit Mitch McConnell pulls dems/country. liberal version Mitch McConnell. feel bad even able comprehend comparable holocaust all. Yes would. Compliance would still disaster.

I'm good wearing mask understand benefits others, nice comfortable protective respirators.

But many people tolerate discomfort, heat, humidity. figure personal risk low fuck everyone else. Fauci probably person US who's pessimistic scares me. important detail seen talked much though large amount Florida's drive testing done CVS.

And CVS testing DIY. literally let swab nose. know swab done before, zero percent chance people (if anyone) swabbing deep long enough get reliable test results.

I'd imagine lot false negatives coming Florida covid considered pre-existing condition cannot insured healthcare. Get path everyone masked. would say something controversial, yet brave!? Arnold Schwarzenegger could governor...  polling places one voter suppression, since anti-mask seems one group... think I’ll start using this. Thanks! dunno, many white houses y'all burned down? Depends: Turkmenistan developed country? They're level 1 ""lockdown"" weeks. Level 4 stay home lockdown. 

If enter country, quarantined. quarantine, life 'normal'.  fuckin guy. Jesus, someone, somebody, entity, give goddamn break. seen full public pool? There's much room left water. hell lose leg covid?!? WTF Probably late me. Took test today. wear mask many area refuse to. like even exist anymore fact cases higher ever, lol. fucking dumbass. go account check shit posts. literally troll account.   
    - Drill Sergeant (Forrest Gump) I’m pissed. I’m separated travel restriction loved ones, I’m seeing action change that. haven’t seen 6 months, rate, it’s going another 6.

You selfish assholes shit list. No, everyone else seems to. there's pedantic. Ignore said ""knowing"". read long time ago. question variable mentioned within article? Could make ominous numbers really much higher far infections needing hospitalization? Again, memory, someone reported could 10x official number. found drugs you. 

You're getting choke slammed sure. Florida control group corona virus experiment? airlines stuck threatening ban people refuse wear masks, something briefly get good press? theory. Still thinking going happen. beyond dumb.

But also mistake say ok protest.

Consistency important. political expediency. Florida half population California does. wish ill death anyone, really hope makes through. said, whatever happens him, hope wake call Trump conservatives. comparing quarantined temperature-controlled homes running water plenty food motherfucking holocaust? Dude I'm literally writing Italy, that's happened.

The government response pretty much time.

The first diagnosed case found february 17, first local lockdown enabled february 21st gradually ""enlarged"", first national lockdown march 11th.

Point is: parts Italy suffered virus ones locked early on: Lombardia, Veneto Piemonte.

We unlucky partially idiotic, unlucky first western country got hit shit really know handle it, sure waste much time, also first country ban flights China.

Partially idotic local government Lombardia used senior citizens retirement residences COVID-hospitals, we're 99% confident reason high death toll regions.

But look parts Italy notice pretty much nailed it, regions took blow Lombardia, Piemonte, Veneto maybe Emilia-Romagna, I'm currently writing Campania, possibly hardest swiftest lockdown whole country, worked big time.

I know got impression mismanaged covid crisis, assure false: things considered surprisingly responsible quick. Obviously could done better, said kinda first ones.

tl;dr: false, get facts straight.  witness experiment happens pandemic leadership refuse accept problem. name profit.. TIL Scrooge McDuck took Mickey one finally look whether water wet. people need give medical care then. Sign waiver, good riddance. Took 2. 280 lbs fat ass rocking jeans 100 degrees Phoenix. wore socks 7 years. Thanks information. I'm denying HIV easily spread unprotected anal intercourse. 

What see anything supporting claim ""retarding effects medication"" due unprotected sex. 

The second NY times source says medication makes unlikely pass on, everyone takes medication daily instructed economic pressures make access challenge.

It seems like cost taking medication drivers HIV effectiveness medication itself?

Your point health education valid. half population... Dude scientists wouldnt make vaccine based old mutation. mutation happened February. California twice population Florida? Dude 79 essentially doesn’t sleep - working 20 hours day April wife reportedly tell eat, drink sleep. earned long vacation. look back comment thread. guy said "" get 50k positives 70k tests would entering herd immunity territory. "".

That would true tests done randomly selecting people general population. comment notes, happens e.g. Mexico, sick people hospitals tested. Governor Roast Yep. hard time believing young, rich kids 20s accustomed certain lifestyle discipline respect bubble rules months. takes ONE teammate get virus entire team compromised. I’m mortuary school live Florida. guess I’ll job I’m done. We'll see.

I believe they're willing sacrifice dine-in service, they're going push that.

Whether like message, people less decided actions let thing burn through. still do. Cases, deaths...we're number 1! Brazil tried challenge, ole US saw coming said, ""Hold beer"". Florida population density NY wrong. going go bomb shelter god-given right stay house! Bombs FAKE NEWS liberal conspiracy!

Replace word ""bomb"" sentences word ""hurricane"" exactly many fire departments hear hurricane season, rescue sorry asses roof house. People stupid self-defeating always. Glad stories shared, really months COVID-19, I've honestly seen almost none... still little idea much general public exposed to. China actually pretty good diplomacy. China already pledged share vaccines African allies would almost certainly make available friendly countries.

The US thing, least likely share. proof happening though, conjecture implying happening. Hence downvotes.

Nonsense. downvotes goes circlejerk sub, pro-fearmongering. 

The evidence set forth link. ripped labrum april refused go doctor.

Caved went would easy fix needs titanium screws.

If hurt go fucking doctor, worth risj permenant damage like did. cackling heard say people control need told act rational?  Ohhhh shit mean like using bunch 3 syllable words makes smart because?    Yes. Thank you, needed give fine jaywalking spreading deadly disease fine typical response. one randomly getting tested. people opt get tested feeling sick. people feeling sick heading hospital they'll get tested treated soon possible. familiar patients treated immediately given doctors plaquenil even test results come back. 

People like complain lack testing truth go get randomly tested every 3 days available you. bet even attempted get tested even though many public testing sites hospitals available you. man, that's said childish me. I'm aware ""I kinda want stay inside months"" great reason nationwide quarantine, much nuanced that.

Be chill. asked question alot. Italy delay lockdown peak 2 weeks. Deaths lagged another 1-2 weeks. brother re-posted something FB TMC lying bed capacity. tell people misunderstanding resources allocated, anyone know happened exactly? “Lying numbers, AGAIN!” annoys fuck me.

I always want reply “LIVING DENIAL, AGAIN!” Lol.

I love brother much thinks girlfriend daughter February, they’re safe, since kids didn’t catch then, they’re obviously safe, too. That's thought too, see dota2 putting big tournaments hold indefinitely. great (in weird, silver lining way) seeing smaller tourneys going see big championships unless play actual LAN. Otherwise there's way many players countries internet access netcafes, even latency would still put running. one fly, either physically distancing players building option either.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Sadly could boil point India. seems disease handle fairly well able give supportive treatment critical patients. that's possible, everyone knows going hospital pointless going see people dropping dead home. wouldn't. enough information longterm effects surviving virus - risk worth me. I'd like kids one day, there's lot infertility issues reported. I'd also like able walk upstairs without losing breath many people still seem struggling months later. Even asymptomatic carriers showing signs scarred lungs. thank you! hard find phone booth hold day age. Can't peak cases keep increasing never go back 🤔 think idea vaccine boosters needed works cut spread virus. Even 1% death rate, that's 100 people dead three weeks now. 1%. It'll higher people able get proper treatment. mean, may fudge numbers, people died still die. families know happened. People dig deeper find real number. know what'll happen, hope outrage destroys him. cruelty DeSantis displaying fucking disgusting. evil. isn’t hospital withheld treatment. man’s court appointed guardian (appointed bc wife sister couldn’t agree would make medical decisions him) declined care behalf. Thanks!! would definitely feel safer back home well! (Yep, still consider Italy home, doctorate). think good decision indeed! Forget *who* exists?

jk good point I’ve always liked optimists. They’re often wrong, like here, generally likable. 

He doesn’t damned thing, finally feels like to, they’re seeing couple thousand deaths day. then, he’ll toss mealy-mouthed platitudes absolutely nothing useful, also hindering localities useful things. say was, mean kids suffer situation. can't figure out, I'm really sure tell you. Asked earlier.     
New York 14 day quarantine rule people 10 states. exactly enforcing this? would anyone know I'm somewhere I've quarantining? That’s friend. That’s sociopath Turns smart politicians best politicians, would thought ""I'd rather die wear mask""

Well, yes, yes will. prison. poverty.



Although gov mandate whatever wants, enforcing many quit/be fired?  Medical pot thing.... 90% states gonna infected ready know X thousand positive tests ""yesterday"" everything hear indicates test results take 2-7 days? Wish lived right lol Hey man. Don’t lump us like that. There’s lots good here. It’s assholes always loudest. friend Except David Clarke flouted lockdown, twice. country got pissed him. many state records far today? 5? Hahahaha, no. Fml Exactly I’m 37. 100% would (and have) rented AirBnBs specifically throw house parties lol. 
 
Seems like silly way shoot foot cost helping nothing. Honestly service rent places house parties would probably pretty well.

From actual article (emphasis mine):

In June, Florida infections rose 168% 95,000 new cases. **The percent tests coming back positive skyrocketed 15% 4% end May.**

The percentage tests coming back positive increased. rate growth *is* probably accurately represented numbers have. numbers pulled demonstrate additional spread say, considering positive cases reported, they're *new* cases relative *new* tests. few. media makes look worse is. spice must flow. always tell Milford man.

Take us back 3.7.15 please scientfic presedence regards selective pressure may drift virus less deadly infectious.

There proof happening though, conjecture implying happening. Hence downvotes. hope Abe Froman ok... BLM charged murder. 


That’s stupid sound. Scientists know right based facts. 

You realize Fauci, one highly regarded scientists world claimed wearing masks necessary right deaths spiked New York, right?

In January 2020, claimed found evidence human-to-human transmission regards Covid19. 

Scientists wrong lot things. get DOH, also include antibody tests private labs DOH doesn’t report. also provide data hospitalizations ICU beds state doesn’t report. set scientist created Florida dashboard, got fired [she wouldn’t manipulate data make look 

Truthfully check day, rely Covid action site reliable data. haha damnit let moment! almost felt smart second! made two angry comments now. Dang. Suck trumps desatans sacks. That’s do.  Swede, agree Sweden's strategy, like Sweden mentally retarded. freebeacon.com  I’m completely. It’s quite amazing candidate old. they’ll strangers clearly aren’t particularly concerned COVID exposure. Whatcha gonna do? media politicized virus. Also insurance companies aren’t covering Covid exposures unless it’s workers. Wow, live US can't help wondering: ""Is COVID-19 still thing?"" get it, aboard 'denier' train.

You're going lot better luck another subreddit, possibly local MAGA Facebook group. Well, Florida third largest state population-wise, really make per-capita comparison. Either way, bad news Florida name change. think pushed hard? Job growth expand month month. Fact fact good news good news. 4.8 mil jobs vs 1.5 mil new unemployment claims. Compared May, growth. Long ways togo positive news. comparing year year, growth all. know that. spike anywhere great plains. think oceanfront property smart investment anymore. might ocean property. Even testing positive STILL [tweeted masks/social distancing Independence day event Mount Rushmore.

Now [he's symptoms severe.

This mean say ""I would die country"". People literally dying economy, nothing else. DeSantis *trying* kill people. she, thanks proving didn’t even click article. Limit amount airports like before. Contract hotel out, pay ton (we printed 3 trillion, think could afford it), shuttle people quarantine hotels. also incentivizes people travel US within they'd quarantine awful (I it).


I know laid unrealistic politically ultimately doable. said...is legal quarantine interstate travelers? strictly enforce state level? rest world must awe sheer stupidity arrogance. Unfortunately, evidence suggests vaccines reduce morbidity preventing infection lower respiratory tract even vaccine still productive infection nasal passages

Okay two things 
 
1. describing sounds like misguided analysis Forbes opinion piece Oxford monkeys (that bring part monkeys got half dose human would get 4x virus human would never encounter) analysis vaccines currently development. remember hearing anything infection nasal passages Sinovac vaccine example. line data released Pfizer adverse effects typical ones associated vaccines like fever such. Ultimately, point is, none vaccines released Phase 3 data early make call
  
2. right unvaccinated individuals risk, that's kind point many people needing vaccinated all. Even imperfect enough control spread, would still giant boost. “DrAiN SwAmP!!!” . . .but Vanilla Ice *Cream* plentiful supply! irony beyond belief really interesting. dismissive claim made month ago. I'm just... skeptical, guess. data seem supporting claim, least Italy. It’s non muscle pain (back chest! That’s pretty uncomfortable.  Wonder cost be. already 10,000 new today, day yet. believe Dr. Osterholm explained herd immunity number infections begin significantly slow down. slowdown occur hit herd immunity. said usually pandemic hit herd immunity overshoot epidemic continues quite time herd immunity momentum. Aw. Shucky ducky :( lived! News article link I’m guaranteed get in? immuno compromised excluded human challenge, mentioned comment.

In scenario excluded ultimately higher risk.  He's naive, he's sociopath care human life economy. He's horrible human core rarely changes. yet vaccines antiviral drugs prevent treat human coronavirus infections."" Better keep mouth shut thought dumb open remove doubt. No, something joanns calls ""stretch chiffon"", quite similar stretch satins. even close. Sure. Problem close argument. remarkable think they're equivalent ...no isnt. actually thing that's studied. way asshole. additionally detected helper cell response SARS-CoV-2 half blood samples examined drawn virus began circulating. observation, say, hints exposure seasonal common cold coronaviruses may confer protection new warned. decided make partisan issue. deserves get virus die it.

Fuck you, Ron protests even riots cool? long term alternative one two things. best option open gradually, said would start. Fun fact: one single state fit criteria laid experts announced White House begin reopening. reopened phase 1, one single state met criteria enter phase 2.  phase 3. never gave gradually opening chance. facing worse problem likely shutdown FIND REOPENING GRADUALLY COUPLE MONTHS WORKS! fucked that? minimum several months away getting first wave. Meanwhile, despite getting things wrong EU, corrected coarse, admitted mistakes, enforced policies crush first wave. reopened. things place combat second wave. may may successful. But, matter what, hitting 50k day. Hell, week 2 going longing days 50k. sad painful part would gladly trade positions nearly every country planet. sadder painful part even close done fucking up. And, several months finding none even works, solution vaccine. stated fucking best case scenario. nation fuckups elected bigger fuckups. Hence, fucked. truth healthcare workers northeast whispering virus isn’t nearly lethal March? 
There history happened viruses. give actually try. like walking dirty ass room garbage bag putting bag bed sitting watch tv. Thats level effort put forth clean room. Fucking shamefully pathetic. public health commissioner article said 50% people wore masks. Great interview. USA, USA, USA!

feels good always best.

I love winning! Thank Mr. President. 

America great right guys? Right!? I've seen around me, I've heard Americans saying ""Real men wear masks"" gotta make women feel weird wearing one, right? clarified press conference fact hack. experiencing technical difficulties post numbers possible got enough French fries, cheese curds, Stanley Cups here, buddy. long term alternative drastically different looking economy people mostly work home. According co-worker, new tests including cold flu.

I told think get news different sources. Well known restaurants packed day opened almost nobody wearing masks. surprised. Nobody southeast seems give anything pandemic. Stay home. Stay safe  test good treatment (can) bankrupt you?

I misworded terms that, that's entirely me. Sorry 'bout that. Dude told ~20,000 verifiable lies 1,659 days he’s president. 

Unless get proof, I’m going say errs side lie. Australian here. Reading makes sad. Good luck friends. literally everyone problem. Pointing fingers certain group wise. tell everyone better. government determined everyone (with exceptions) loses job due virus access CAD$2,000.00 *per month*. Including students can't find summer jobs.

Our social safety nets good thing. universal health care, course.

Americans need demanding governments less sycophantic. Demand better, settle window dressing. know that's popular thing say dominant parties benefit misinformation campaigns parties hurt misinformation campaigns.

They *really* tbh. Murdoch works one team Well good news eventually they’ll run people catch virus numbers go down. consider good news. Thanks! I’ll take look endangered others, sympathy. allowed &amp; others place influence masses outright lied masks. simply opening regardless mean eventually America gonna stuck it

yeah! thats whats going happen always whats going happen, there's cure there's vaccine option keep economy closed deal people catching Ha! I’m happy liked it! You’re saying try protect people?

You protect elderly people without mandating masks forcing lockdowns. Even classrooms often packed gills. Legally think states block travel states due interstate commerce clause. Quarantines one thing think explicitly ban travel one particular state.  Fair enough, increase cases primarily based increased testing availability (the narrative around reported consequence reopening instead) hospitalizations begun spike right uptick reported cases month ago?

Are people suddenly waiting month go hospital testing positive? read first like mid December. 7 months. Sociopaths, Thank Ok. look California then. WWE may soon have...no chance...no chance hell. WA here. Trump called governor ""snake"", said told Pence, head coronavirus task force, take phone calls. was...unhelpful. also data many people tested? mom loves argue reasons numbers looking high we're testing (it's talking point FOX makes downplay severity virus), find hard believe we're testing much better every week one it, I'd like able prove wrong.  Good luck enforcing rule. Yes, symptom sorts. akin cold flu aches reference.

Would likely labouring, wanting say sure it’s growth. take $50 give back $20 didn’t earn $20. It’s still net loss. Also we’re going see swing businesses adjust headcount lower demand. people still go people won’t. Another person said best “people don’t want go Jurassic Park velociraptors still roaming about” What? never said anything deaths weeks earlier. That’s re-peaking, nice job pulling bum lol. 
Let’s check real two weeks hospitals overrun shall we? Let’s say fatality rate 1-2% 10k cases daily. That’s 2-300 deaths every day Florida. deaths lagging indicator there's [*some* reason believe see explosion Cases linearly correlated deaths. median age newly infected cases going probably see death curves saw before. 

Now get wrong, Flordia fucked many ways I'll interested see plays next weeks. That’s exactly government wants :) see stonks going up, ah must big deal... reality it’s propped federal reserve husband gets biggest hard-on prime day nothing, right. stupid shit. one chance block entering 
we one chance prepare 
we one chance contain initial outbreaks 
we one chance prevent next outbreak next next next...

plenty chances actually think getting idea. Except spread pandemic follows predictable mathematical patterns absence external factors, stock market far chaotic.

Edit: able extrapolate trends reason works epidemics.  data effectively *always* couple weeks old, time see trends change *little time* react. things like re-opening slowly cautiously take quite weeks see impact action is. Many political decision makers US effectively ignored experts trying explain this, went charging ahead anyway. yeah almost like regulations necessary Fuck Florida! Except Pence never tells truth. elderly relative called yesterday happily reported seen VP television explaining deaths per day 2,000 April 200 day now, things going well. told deaths per day 1,000 past 2 days said, quote, ""I believe that"". mistrusts everything Fauci says, believes everything Pence says. coronavirus task force always fail Pence leading it. undermines entire message effectively. Rightwing, authoritarian-minded people follow signaling Trump/Pence instinctively mistrust scientists. telling two year old bringing home cold cold daycare last november december potentially made us immune? get infected? article states one knows this. insider info? Waaaait. bear shit woods? hope every employee no-shows  Swaggerty Sausage Swiggity Sweet 3 year old single handedly got Mcdonald's play area closed last summer drive ever since. might need huge percentage population infected reach herd immunity. stupid ones insist returning 100% normal without masks. half population.  graph somewhere percent positive tests time Alabama? Or, tests time? keep hearing friends say, ""Oh, rise cases testing."" I'd really like know that's truly case. Masks help spread it, would suggest BLM protests may effect increase. Masks stop people getting it. Especially social distancing properly maintained. PSU going open fall. Fools. CMS.gov HHS.gov information. Makes wonder happened US dropping deaths Damn What’s point that? 

Cutting number kids building half given time lets school distancing measures. absolutely one government—not single soul—has hint credibility logic—even single gaffe—because “history dishonesty.” Floridian stayed firmly home months. briefly return work 3 weeks company work decided reclose due spike cases. I’m glad option continue stay home seeing people go restaurants, mall, beach, etc messed mental state. frustrated DeSantis handling it, I’m saddened many people seem think it’s silly dumb worried virus.

I’m 24 coworkers would tease saying would fine even got virus. Seeing little everyone cares really hurts me, it’s it’s collective. Porto Ricans stay America!!

^/s ^obviously Oh florida Really wish use phrases like ""shatters record""... actually makes seem like something people proud of... Interstate quarantines make sense, probably unconstitutional, certainly unenforceable, lead New Mexicans ignore measures actually help, like wearing face masks public avoiding crowded places. America: isn’t football, aren’t going higher score. Doesn’t look like anything me. Yeah, Desantis said going happen, take facts....  takes days symptoms show, number hospitalizations increased long cases began rise. slow rising trend death followed. admit, I've Splash Mountain handful times. gotta say I've never paid attention whether ""theme."" Like, seriously thought theme just, ""log ride water, big splash!"" it. Fair counter.

Other things also sacrificed process though. People getting unruly, losing lots work, good portion country going come addiction issues etc bc really hard pass time

Etc etc

IF everyone gonna get it, we're sacrificing economy needlessly

My main intent convince anyone saving economy, therea lot hostility regarding ppl wearing masks etc may help short term flatten curve, area underneath remain same. want ppl stop calling ppl fucking idiots result without masks [Fauci’s Well, put guiness book world records. efforts really paid earning spot.  saying CAN'T find quote saying ""masks work"" even though said said words. able find saying 100% effective. STILL TRUE! Wow open shut case. point? person saying favor ""lax restrictions"" long people wearing masks. favor lax mask restrictions Congrats? know states US made competition would explain lot... Pfizer study showed day 28 post-vaccination neutralizing antibodies vaccinated comparable levels convalescent individuals. encouraging show data 3-4 months antibodies titers waned.

Here Bourouch study Science. Although Nasal titers lower still vaccinated Oxford swabs still show elevated titers infection vaccinated animals.

I agree experimental infection titers likely lower vaccinated individuals get exposed still concerning. course know ad hominem is, either, since dumb shit.

To give hint: calling ""dumb fuck"" argument anything.

Like seriously, stupid person. think important someone tells least life. Good.

But ligher side, I'm loving imagery inspires head masks made every tartan pattern clan Scottish show tartans without needing kilt. really hope someone this. Nothing says abnormalities lead ""massive impacts"" later life, says noticeable abnormalities one lung 60% patients. even read this? summary short term changes lung images, pretty cool subject obviously didnt read it. summary nothing study long term effects. past epidemics indeed laws this. could ya know, stop putting younger people ventilators. He's hospitalized he's spreading loved ones. question want another human die? mortality rate everything goes up. Sepsis, heart attacks, falls. Even child birth. 115 150 Right, think (that probably legal pandemic). Closing borders definite no-go feel like (were different time) legally enforceable quarantine could thing. feel like courts would support they've supported rules time. WalMart parking lots already packed okay. That's RIGHTS MATTER! ...? anything said comment?

Edit: Oh shit, heart disease contagious? People better continue wear masks COVID eradicated catch heart disease gym.

/s Even super liberal super conservative place, less half Americans even vote, still masses apathetic &amp; uninformed ignorant people. Woooww. Northern VA sore throat cough, known contact someone diagnosed contact vulnerable group person, could *still* get test three days ago. Yeah, conduct. We’ve done really well none due him. day 30 $5,368,709.12 exact.  believe vaccine next 3 years so, natural immunity powerful important. Woot woot number 1 baaaabyyy!!! long long time. ravaged NYC got 20-25% there. Keep mind, also infect slower rates people immune. linked copied relevant details below. Basically says benefits one meter distance masks similar, “moderate” confidence one meter finding “low” confidence mask finding. Two meters also found beneficial one meter (hence famous “six feet” guidance). also studies show masks don’t much prevent transmission flu.

People wear masks they’re indoors otherwise can’t distance (like crowd), can’t hurt might help. really isn’t much evidence masks make huge difference, especially compared benefits keeping six feet distance. chance transmission distance less 1 meter (3.3 feet) 12.8%, fell 2.6% distance 1 meter (3.3 feet). added distances 2 meters (6.6 feet) could effective. said certainty evidence ""moderate.""


 chance transmission without face mask respirator (like N95 mask) 17.4%, fell 3.1% mask worn. However, certainty evidence ""low."" drank kool aid. stop testing!! That's one shittiest records history. race one would want come first. 

Prayers affected families, healthcare workers everyone Florida around world. 

Even conditions India seem good. Painfully enough repeated yesterday. day Florida, Texas, Georgia Arizona broke record cases single people refuse listen fault. need locked cooperate efforts manage pandemic. following Trump’s example suppose, that’s he’s done since January. Roars back? 😆 Yes, much larger percentage though. Half billion people use pounds across several countries, lakh used India. less one percent people know means. Trump history germaphobe, personal response coronavirus makes sense. Peep article july 2019 - also I'm pretty sure man even know exactly germ is, I'm pretty sure forgot banging porn star. Feel bad Dr.Fauci team. Worked entire life moment orange ruin expertise.  keep saying people want force schools back open primarily childcare. going schools shut students teachers sick? kids get sick pass parents? point governor held responsible? beyond pale. Thousands people going die understand, hasn’t done single thing mitigate this. basically crime humanity. wrong thinking this?? Absolutely. don’t think bad 2008. 

In crash, people got stuck homes equity. Now, people lots equity homes, even sell discount since longer afford payments, won’t bad shape 2008. Back then, people buying houses cash down., becoming instantly underwater home values declined. Also, lender letting buy 0% now. city gets really bad can't hide it. touches everyone. Everyone know least someone die it. live Italy personally know 3 those, heard also several relatives relatives die. fact is: gets bad, can't bullshit away. hospitals filling up. Houston almost max capacity. Florida 80% capacity. testing. keep getting worse. Mid season? Like two weeks entire team tests positive. kids known super spreaders due social nature school touching playground sets always sticking fingers noses mouth. No.....not really. people getting called wearing mask someone would bring one crowd. Good ad hominem, dude. Eventually run enough people test positive.... curve flattened one way another. fact Melissa remembers question response sign response stood conversation shocking. bad think left wants Trump office? Herd immunity exists. arent going reach terrible strategy real thing.  Hahaha jesus, entire time I've trying make discussion. I've made sound arguements reasons going emotions. ""People arent stupid"" okay rebut arguement? still dont get I'm gonna say again. enough study proves surgical masks let alone cloth masks protects virus, makes sense catches droplets doesnt solve aerosol problem since masks need fitted even work first place. fact governments acting mandating masks based enough evidence say something, especially come risks well. risks are, increased touching face, false sense security, stock issues medical grade masks preserved health workers. Sure whatever want wear mask fine comes risks based insufficient data. 

A 10 year old tell someone calls stupid not, apparently cant. cant take fact masks comes risks put emotions pride safety refusing sound arguements. act know better experts even though contradict themselves. want judge ones experts not. come ""oh they're calling us stupid"" one time without actual arguement topic facemasks I'm wasting time you. armpit America  wife love Disney world even looking past covid..... would anyone want go right now? meet greets pics characters, parades shows goes like half experience. I’m sure also don’t think stay hotels property huge part Disney world escape bubble. also wear mask support really fun, want Disney expirence remembered way. We’ve put going year wont go back till things safe get full Disney experience. least we're still best something!  Despite constitution starting “we people” really never “all together,” rather take individualism obscene level. Remember Hillary crucified notion “it takes village?” Yeah, could use little empathy skill innate, it’s learned I’ve noticed less less days. people operated empathetic standpoint, truly would much better place. Covid really highlighted fragile society gross inequities system. 

Part wants get bad enough effect change. disasters go, somehow manage get thru it, collectively sigh say “whew, close one” resume status quo. don’t learn lessons. look things one anomalies rather looking things teachable moment make us better prepared going forward. magical line shift whole consciousness wanting effect change. sure line event. 

I hope get there. Remember comes time vote. Eh cares freedoms death lol twisted minds supporters president freedumb **will require** people know hold dear die start take seriously. Finally America winning something Don’t forget National Review ran article May asking “Where Ron DeSantis go apology?” really said took “nuanced laser guided approach” fighting virus. Probably takes get results data kits running week lab workers take weekend whole thing restart again. conservatives, idea getting help somebody else sign weakness. considered ""noble"" strong something turn gift money even really need it.

It's ""I help help yourself"" way get credit succeed, there's nobody blame fail, pointing blame finger somebody else also sign weakness.

Except many many cases, government that's screwing you, nobody loves blaming others Trump. also cannot take full credit accomplishments huge leg parents get started. Ironic... Woooo! USA! USA! USA! Abbott deserves criticism getting, end day think reflection lot Texans.

This. Abbott totally representing voters like. That's elected. N95 masks medical professionals, cloth anything else citizens. 

It's hard distinguish two.

But worry, get it, I'm liar too. plausible deniability. 'shh question narrative' really quickly turned 'you're right headline makes feel bad' there. Almost every state experiencing growth right now. seeing growth later though, like Arkansas, Tennessee others. Realistic: Sometime January-April 2021.

Optimistic: Sometime fall. Let's hold hands make second wave 🌊🌊 half counties Texas *clamped down* this. Abbot chided Patrick told sacrifice grandparents ""for greater good"", pandemic promptly spiraled control economy crashed. Ty testing going up, demand testing going up. 

Demand months ago higher amount testing would show though, milder symptoms risky group encouraged put strain towards limited amount available testing goes people suspect exposure symptoms.

Yes, also increased availability testing, people realizing get tested free, places employment requiring encouraging employees get tested, colleges going require students, etc.

An important contextual fact median age positive cases Florida dropping 35. suggests testing done wider variety people, mean lower death rates age 50 Even though know what’s going happen play out. acting amazing great. Damn. 

Can make post this? 

If can't, would mind do? Oh fuck, gave knife one roommates moved Florida. Lol RIP  gonna disrespect origins like Kane? wore mask years live Ontario, Canada overall population 15 million US we'd 5th populous state.

We've 30,000 total cases since end February we've strict social distancing, indoor dining, bars, personal services closed, everything closed except grocery stores pharmacies. 

We're averaging 150 new cases per day bet we'll keep border closed long time. We've started re-open retail business services, people wearing masks still indoor dining even great numbers. 

I feel government done great job. Define falling ill? They’re rich. So. They’ll protected. Unlike school employees students actually live here. NBA really resuming season worst place Tested, tested asymptomatic, hospitalized, critical condition, enzyme confirmation, retesting patients multiple times...

Death Covid, Death Covid....

At one point going every countries data. question sanity NE immediately detaining mandatory supervised quarantine travelers TX/FL/AZ/etc step plane. right shows know little virus.. would surprised. Even plenty medical workers believed nonsense follow CDC guidelines. Sometimes, get pay for. Yeah reports going around long term damage....that reaaaallly doesn’t bode well all. Especially second wave looming flu season happy clean people recovering covid. question long we, immunosuppressed people, wait experiment end? year, two? We’ve stuck homes months already, people continue going without masks spreading virus rampantly. Even mentally healthy person it’s challenging. Less 24 hours ago, tweeted 4th July event South mandatory event, attended President Trump. PEOPLE FED UP!

What dispicable apparently started symptoms Monday, still felt like appropriate make anti-mask tweet three days later. Same, that's kept seeing. parents forget teach proper manners? 1. safe - it’s less dangerous staff. there’s still risk. Kitchens designed maximize distance staff, designed small efficient tables full.
2. Waitstaff aren’t delivery drivers. They’re trained professionals could MAYBE deliver two homes worth food (average four top) without coming back restaurant. Soggy fries simply suck.
3. don’t want put chefs risk, overhead gone up. know ground beef February 2? Bulk 80/20 2.35/lb. product 5.65/lb. 
4. whole staff delivered meals day long would still losing money (server pay 3.15/hr - would pay LEAST minimum wage). 
5. agree first sentence rest said impossible, NRA outlook grim food businesses reasons. us simply cannot shift another model fluidly, it’s going buyers market kitchen equipment 6 months. Florida reports day behind, Sunday/Monday numbers actually Saturday/Sunday numbers. would assume whats causing numbers dip. Back lived LA, nights leaving Los Feliz where, saw clogged Los Feliz Blvd was, hill get onto 5, legit considered finding parking spot sleeping car. one mile could take 45 mins. Except, surprise! There's parking spots either lol.

That said... damn miss n out. numbers really put things perspective.. realize Covid 1/5 deadly deadliest thing US. That's actually even terrifying.. Happy cake day reason I’m defending protests due comparison party. 

They’re exact thing eyes virus. It’s totally valid comparison. House parties also tend lot less people nationwide, professionally organized street wise given current situation, one forgivable other. would absolutely better option people crowding streets, much leg stand terms “forgivable” people getting together get drunk.

Go extend sentiment someone caught connection protest. I’m sure they’ll glad know feelings it. wannabe Instagram influencers protesting ones tacitly throwing support haircut protestors could continue living best life. protests gave excuse without shamed self-absorbed narcissists are. think I’m bullshitting, take look trending topics preferred platform everything’s reopened again. They’re bored protests back bars (with quarantine period) rest country left aftermath. Top fact people like damndest lionize vectors none feel guilty mess they’ve clearly made. case count-wise, terms getting people buy social distancing. treat masks way scientific evidence shown us effective. 

Effective better nothing still far cry perfect. gold standard still N95, unless every single protestor one used entire time without touching face, gathering thousands people right next typical Dollar Tree mask made protect against. Again, they’re meant last resort absolutely break isolation/be proximity people outside social taking streets demand reform regards police practices isn’t last resort would warrant use masks, don’t know else would considered one.

This kind hyperbole emotional rhetoric doesn’t convince anybody got crucified 2 weeks wanting murder elderly exactly thing BLM protestors, much smaller numbers too. People literally need go. Full stop. numbers simply don’t support throwing away/gambling gains made containing virus that’s orders magnitude likely kill black people police ever will. people protesting civil rights climate change movement lost credibility? come conclusion?

Framing “protesting civil rights” doesn’t change fact they’ve gathered en masse medical/epidemiology community told that’s exact opposite thing need right now.  fact particular mass gatherings escaped pilloried wasn’t lost anyone absolutely reeks politicization cherry-picked outrage.

The reason people starting come board taking action climate change touted backed solid research. Good luck getting anyone buy whatever research gets pumped without put even finer tooth comb claim left lost standing right literally storming state capitals month ago couldn’t get haircut. 

And got rightfully put blast it. you’re trying excuse worse behaviour this’ll actually earn woke points Instagram. mind.

I’m one who’s actively excusing denying harm mass gatherings watching case numbers spike like clockwork started. didn’t answer question Yeah, better option - nursing homes COVID positive others be. 

The CDC certainly fucked numerous times - testing thing bigger, IMHO. Cuomo will, least, errors, admire. CDC much less forthcoming missteps causes mistrust. Well gave 2 studies less 2 minutes. I'm saying new vaccines going completely ineffective. Rather, pointing virus continually linger next 2-3 years even vaccine. less-lethal virus survives better more-lethal one does. stupid muricans rare. Said invasive species Everglades. Hey, fun fact infectious diseases scientist understand: 

Infectious diseases are, fact, infectious. agree that, right? So, there's young people getting infected, right? Well, here's fucking thought: maybe people infected general, people go infect old people. 

So, summary: infections infections. people getting infected? Old people. Immunocompromised people. Obese people. Smokers. matter? sacrifice we're willing make? 

Do see first world countries increases cases like this? Wealthy countries population Florida seeing exponential rates? No? Mainly Florida? Cool. Well, least fucking young people. mean offense significant group citizens entitled

Bruh none fuckin taken, I'd like think us acutely aware super frustrated fact, lately I'm sure imagine would much harder US US lower population density. spread areas. would lockdown effectively enforced? suppose cities alone could locked down. think long anti-bodies last plays huge role herd immunity achieved? think anti-body duration differs disease disease? 96% quite good enough. Read Base Rate Fallacy. Okay , many deaths ? Florida here, I’m pretty sure we’re doomed.   deaths going up? intensive care patients going up? No, thought border control racist though? susceptible people tested weekly basis? know plenty older folks respiratory illness prior susceptibility issues never tested. I'm gonna need source that, know I'm living podunk town nobody gets tested nobody wears masks. least think need significantly clarify statement. received someone time window incubation. article state transmitted others? No. article attaches political event illness. Kind like opposite everyone night ripping statues beating innocent people. Grats. much hate saying it, lessons best learned hard way.

Its sad good people get caught other's stupidity. Atleast drop culture war bullshit wear masks. ain't politics anymore realized number increase couldnt excused increased testing pivoted deaths/death rate matters. Ooooook death rate still declining, weird af Correct Yeah, DiBlasio completely failed impress me. r/floridaman leave home get food. hard stay home? Apparently hard you. Also, paying food go public buy? job? Savings? happens shitty Congress lets cares act expire end month? Tell easy stay home. Tell millions people debt Yeah, Texas almost exactly 10x population, basically like Texas reporting 8,700 cases. That’s hilarious. Wow smashed Florida 💪🙌🙌😎 keep up! say every single person getting vaccine though. First expected delivery millions September. They've got contracts stuff place produce 2billion. think is. Since politically polarized recently, “if it, I’m not. always wrong” “Shatters records” sounds like accomplishment Fools!  Clearly rum prevents coronavirus.  I've got great anecdote... even 100%, percent better 0% US better get Yep, BLS interesting way counts unemployed. Also furloughed ONE SAID SURE GOING WORK!!! Someone brought fact studied, called stupid. Youre completely changing subject now. Let’s see: 2% 100,000 200 people.

The death rate COVID-19 is~2%, rate infection multiplied death rate: start seeing 2,000 deaths day Florida reaches one million per day infected.

The current rate 10,000 per day infected Florida 2 Jul 20. 


Plus, given viral load increasing amongst infected—death rate rise exponentially August 2020 rate death increases due overwhelmed immune systems infected.  point idiots company addition people choice go work lax lockdown rules inability receive employment benefits. 

Cut wanted stay home couldn’t, well cut places congregate people refuse follow rules, risk spread going much less. don’t think anyone realistically thinks 100% people would abide rules, it’s 70-80% instead like 50-60%, us would much better chance getting handle things. doses might ready Fauci doesn’t think effectiveness necessarily confirmed then. talking end year early next year JAMA interview. say died Coronavirus? USA! USA! think feelings!!! Study =\= school thought. Life comes fast. hospitals fill up, death rate look pretty. Many people surviving solely due healthcare ICU. hospitals fill up, people die virus, things due emergency care.

This important let virus wildly spread. separate homes sent people to, good start. Thanks. also say ensure doctors nurses. need could them

And yet totally fine make masks pretty much anything 🙄 agree. Sadly culture created treating throwing sickie calling in. practically dying believed.

The last time called sick throwing night got ""I've 3 people go sick already, going difficult cover work"". response was: fucking care bECuZ tEStinG love America, ffs please stop stupid True. Things getting sanitized regular, still never know. That's masks handwashing advised. Plus, human memory plain sucks, take forgetful ass. 10000 cases * 0.3% = 30 new deaths today (they died yet). 30 deaths/ day Florida makes 6th leading daily cause death there. assumes NYC ifr. lower bound. 

Of course doubles every 7 days three next three wks 240/ day... roughly heart disease cancer combined. They’re taking multiple tests test positive. test positive requires multiple negative tests return 14 day quarantine. Time USA get circumcision remember comments like 6 months ago. Reality better predicted. Oh mean based test Papaya Goat tested positive with? reasonable person believes filth anymore. KAG? gonna argue whether know things? know get it. broader points haven’t changed. wore mask back March 1st. stayed away people best possible. decontaminated everything bought store. didn’t socialize go hang hook up. core things, still true today proven work.. much we’re opening surprise, shit went sideways people chose either informed, declare exhausted gave up. 

Yes, continue learn things, things evolving. core things avoid catching thing aren’t different. Things like treatments, vaccines outdoors ok, ok, masks bad, they’re good, cause CO problems, masks useless unless N95, masks work virus .15 microns, bla bla bla. None bullshit misinformation matters decided learn basics virus beginning guess what, still work. Also, don’t play statistics. don’t look age group comorbidities evaluate risk. pretend get get reduce needs survival. Period. 

So I’m glad want challenge whether learned everything day week month. proof learned things work today. 

And isn’t brag. shared view things there’s nothing challenge methods they’ve working me... paid attention actively sought info. I’m like that. love learning things work. Gives something that’s productive. 

I take you’re sub, sought information well. I’m one wanna waste one ounce energy debating things. There’s debate here. least. like Handmaid's Tale version NHL. Trump administration's fda last regulatory agency trust approve new vaccine made record time. We're better catching covid gaining immunity way. That's way trying treat people Coronavirus. They're playing much possible program people like illnesses general. Personal health needs trump work ethics. That’ll it.. surprising figure Florida n actually mind this, especially meetings people obnoxious background noises. Yea friend told too, tho heard costs more. Welll case restart season 2 weeks later everyone recovers lol. 

I think people overestimating many athletes going get season. I’m willing LOT guys already recovered. guys young, rich, 3 months downtime whatever want. still absurdly high, especially test population 100k+ newer laws limit many hours residents work, it’s still lot, there’s nothing stop making switch string nights day shift one day recover. that, people still coming vacations bringing opportunity infection getting infected going home infecting home town... thing happened Oregon. definitely slowed testing purpose nationwide. USA! USA! Given flu alone would put hospital yes, am. Sorry us gods among men like totally are.  great idea small theatre chains (or even larger movie chains) trying partner companies pull off. Businesses going adapt vaccine readily available. botch plan, plan. guy dies ""for economy"" (the economy would better sensible mask wearing rules) don’t want die. dying probably save lives promoting reckless dangerous behaviour others lead deaths. It’s magically going away Meh, Darwinism work here. dumb fuck, get reward.

I'm happy live north border. never liked guy. many asymptomatic? lines get tested Orlando astronomical, hard time anons says “more testing isn’t reason seeing cases” statement asinine. think opened back soon though. isn’t even peak tourist season Idk didn’t close summer. So, using Google graphs ""covid deaths USA"" ""covid new cases USA"", New cases trending since June 1st. low value graph March 25th around 16k June 1st. 

Why deaths still trending noticeably lag time supposed 2-2.5 weeks? understand mortality way higher older people raw case numbers raw deaths, proportional rates. Rip Florida  Even effective vaccines 85-95% effective. Thing everyone get enough make outbreaks extremely unlikely. terrible situation in. hope friend's mom comes OK spite chaos involved attending needs. mention work said unemployment? follow... Someone Tulsa rally literally said something like “My friend ventilator. We’re aware virus exists, two sides it. sides say different things.”

All president politicized plague USA! USA! Yeahhhh Florida new world recorddddddddd!!!!! well might better treating sick patients, help hospitals completely overrun though. Striking illegal teachers many states Jesus. cats video bomb 80% meetings. feel like whole company knows cats manager squeal ""kitty!"" Mid-sentence. offense, company sounds dumb. [Doesn't appear Asymptomatic = infected = capable transmitting. Wow, fuck guy Weird states mask compliance barely saw bump (looking you, MA) states spiking (looking you, nearly ever state south Mason-Dixon line). Thank you! understand criticisms, still enjoyed it. USA! USA! Right!? want some. Well US going exceeding 35K cases day foreseeable future. Florida reach number soon well. may take 3 full years still bad route take, especially vaccine likely end year could prevent hundreds thousands unecessary deaths. heard something reddit mean actually true. 80% people asyptomatic always wild ass guess people latched fact. believe current thinking around 40% asyptomatic. legit source actually claimed disease mutated significant way, normal process dominant *strain* overcoming others. simply enough information right assess significant mutations, anyone claiming blowing hot air.

It's cherry picking, actually reading articles using critical thinking. Also, there's millions people reddit. unique individual. One person covid19 denier completely different reasons someone else. one might post bullshit that's completely different provids bullshit. Stop trying make groups people enemy, good health. Household infection rates 20%, 20%-40% chance test false negative, hang usual precautions (keep outside, keep 6 feet apart, wear mask need go indoors together etc), basically assume immune.

Source household infection rates: Table 3 

Source test false negative:  [http://r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation\_in\_falsenegative\_rate\_of\_reverse/](http://r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation_in_falsenegative_rate_of_reverse/) neighbors also acted 2-3 weeks earlier would tenth cases well. 

The point since Sweden acted late done more. acted much earlier could done even less. guarantee eats crow one. *some* debate among scientists. 

There *a lot* debate reddit places. 

This reminds climate change. *looks Steam library* Also doesn’t account recent job losses states begin shut back down. People reacting negatively headline bc MILLIONS people making ends meet bc $600 added benefits unemployment garbage headlines like it’s less likely gets extended. get funeral ready point isn’t going sound “kosher” WeHo large population gay people, higher rates smoking unfortunately also higher rates diseases affect immune system.

Yeah, areas LGBT people large percentage population masks absolutely need mandated enforced.  cap cases, tested cases formula assume uniform infectivity susceptibility probably best model current pandemic.

It's still studied, seem superspreading events cause large percentage transmission.
The transmission model well known, difficult estimate herd immunity threshold.
And complete herd immunity, proven append depending length individual immunity, reduction circulation virus level saturate health care, required immunity level know yet.

What known reaching without vaccine come great cost human life. cruel, selfish people. “Sacrifice entire family economy!”

- GOP Hospitals want money though wont...ever...unless someone runs DeSantis rail. US companies released details distribute globally? Guess he's economist Resident Evil would messed up....***if current POTUS (including inaction policies) chiefly blame lackluster American response COVID-19.*** almost like basing economy optimism leveraged derivatives good idea. . . helps all, level genetic susceptibility people poorly. person may well died matter eventually caught next year so. Anyone half brain would reasonably asked difference.

Let's clear, one wants protection themself well willing learning, N95 better mask ultimately yield better results time individual. is, all, healthcare workers use them. Sunday, 84% current inpatient beds 88% ICU beds use COVID-19 Gov. Doug Ducey said news conference Thursday hospitals could hit surge capacity ""very soon"" Arizona deals one worst spikes COVID-19 United States  No, disagree you. countries begun open up. Slowly, opening up. like US. US basically hit full throttle opening again. precautions all. Also, Americans politicized this, making things worse. rest world better place are. Japan opening again, South Korea’s cases non-existent.

Thanks! books close 2020, look overall death tolls, going fucking wild. Government hide specific Covid deaths now, forever. Applying normal mortality rates, calculating difference show true impact Covid. disproportionately impacts women. Shame FSU! I’ve read virus strain activate antibody response someone infected overcome SARS-CoV-2 without mutation effectively able get twice. I’d wonder vaccines based original virus would effective? I’d imagine billion people Florida? Soon enough Florida get virus. Scientists researchers spent decades trying work vaccine coronaviruses. None proven effective.

edit: sub dumb fucking shit omg. Historical example... They’ve shut beach’s county south Florida think Monday doubt that’ll shit. People still find way dumb. 

Florida man articles probably ridiculous weekend. 1-2 kids adding problem. 
 
It averages out. People 1 - 2 kids certainly add problem, proportionally less people 10 kids. 1 - 2 kids exist, global population growth rate would decrease.  get downvoted using unreliable data downplay pandemic. Gotta love language used here. “Shatters record”. Like it’s good thing? Trump probably clearing old people Florida go back old job buying distressed real estate Russian cash January. in-laws Florida back March everything closed down. believe many people talked straight take seriously thought hoax. mentality mindboggling. think they’re to. Im saying anything that, testing numbers florida peaked may 50k. wavered 20 30k. incredibly generous say went 60k still would account numbers. TX expect? truth? test positive they'll swear everything could prevent it.

It’s baffling stupid be. nutrition happened month two ago made contagious? States fact restrict try quarantine travelers states waaaay back first started March. Delaware Rhode Island tried got sooooo much flack it, even people generally supported sheltering place, constitutional right able travel state state. argument made travel, can't stop, threatened lawsuit well. We've got point bullshit watered 14 day quarantine orders, many users stated, really enforceable. deaths lagging metric. couple weeks death rate raising stuck looking like Pikachu meme. 25 351 nba players tested positive covid. That’s approximately 7% players. death rate tells plenty, fact people affected get corona. young people get cancer too, mean pretend affects older people. China tested city 8 million people week using method. worst part is. govoner go live say dont give shit Corona virus thousands Americans would support Nah. importantly need stop whining come solutions even stubborn people willing comply with. Trying change anti science, politicians greedy people fools errand. need trick right thing; like kids medicine vegetables. 

Such as— One person said awhile ago Trump made MAGA masks wore them. would tricked whole boat load people wearing them. 

In end, point is.. can’t change people. need find clever ways get masses what’s necessary without realizing it. Forcing hand issues blaming isn’t going work. Admit mistake?! would sink low?? investigation knowingly allowing employees managers work infected COVID.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah man go start licking toilet seats kissing strangers. country purposefully crippled healthcare system nothing protect people health crisis... they’re economic consequences lol Florida full dumbasses creating dumbass laws dumbasses. offense Floridians actually common sense, state fucking blows hope sinks. Gotta get money.... /s wallah

voila So, basically get free top notch medical care life even expensive facilities, never paying treatment bills afterwards? Sounds like best system world, regular people hate it? parents worked full time regardless. older sister pretty much fended majority (she's 6 years older am). Taiwan immigrated from, concerns American parents child safety big thing there. Kids generally freedom independence (for example lot kids walked school early elementary school, incredibly dense city streets). 

So either take care go school tutor classes like 9:00pm every weekday. extremely common kids attend form extracurricular tutor class, free time spent studying, studying studying more. Especially summer break. point tutor schools less providing childcare education aspect. kids attend classes, would still home themselves. 

Ofc option moved states parents left us home. guess would consider child negligence never got trouble. anything forced us mature lot faster autonomy/responsibility. Aren’t allowed? stopping us? I'm looking for. Thanks! interview USC week honestly hoping get in. appreciate steps taking virus. need pawns get Covid first Sounds like VP. accepting humanitarian aid *fellow* third world countries Granted, observations limited outings area around Glendale Surprise, significant portion people adhering guidelines. stopped get gas way work morning QT probably 40 people inside maybe 10-12 masks. paid pump got right back car. possibly develop inflammatory syndrome. better you. know this? Show distribution deaths month typical year, I'll calculate it. able find parsed way.

The 2020 pneumonia deaths include January CDC provided data. obviously December happened.  hid crucial info could helped prepare world try save ass

For fucks sake, listen think second you’re saying

China locked entire city back JANUARY, everyone knew western countries didn’t shit MARCH started lockdown got hit outbreak 

Let’s say alternate timeline, China reveal information back December last year, say, hundred infected 10 died. seriously think US western countries take seriously? Yes. There's *another* team forgetting about.

Do sincerely know propaganda disinformation? got wrong, pronounced DipShit Imagine flippant 120,000 (and counting) American deaths. Disgusting. Sometimes brother loves sister much...

That’s means.

Joking. Well, mostly. fucking rocket science. clear day end story. Yeah, people blame politician? They're trying keep job, that's all, shitty system set up. morons want point citizens Florida assholes spring break there. gives shit governor said? governor said ""Anyone wants jump cliff allowed too"" would people jump damn cliff? Florida thrives Disney taxes state tolls. Quack, Quack 0.4% dip previous day statistically irrelevant. Oh, know. would want 99% accuracy rate, 96% still pretty fucking good Keep coming Rona Fuck bot Ok let’s try one time. 

I always said protest LA, Florida. Cases spiking LA surrounding counties. Surely fluke though. 

There thing legitimate large outdoor gathering. It’s either causing spread not. so, funeral legit gets limited small numbers. Nothing cause makes large gathering OK comes spreading virus. Wokeness factor. people lying ones trying convince major spike LA due beach 20k people one street. 

My original comment reason show beach goers (outside) protesters (also outside). It’s politically correct call ‘legitimate’ gathering need blame else. 

And Florida, particularly south Florida, big protests demonstrations. sure, emails four went beach couple weeks ago spread around. shoulder shoulder mask-free protestors. think anyone thought mask protect all, protection relatively small much greater protective efficacy towards others towards death hospitalization rate doubling though? Millions people getting sick bad real free high death rates overrunning hospital system. reports see quote case rate data We're serious need comprehensive study people get infected. Eliminate ones pure guesswork, look ones seem reasonably timed, obvious cause. hypothesis that, control age comorbidities, severe cases strongly correlated certain modes infection. ones tend tied large doses virus, like nursing homes, medical wards, parties, nightclubs, bars, basically confined indoor spaces direct (NOT building HVAC) contact virus. That’s crazy, got tested Canada results online 2 days. it’s positive said call 1-2 days.  What? think he’s getting info what’s happening economy? watched testimony? utter fucking bullshit can’t even fathom people trying say protests didn’t effect. Hundreds thousands people shoulder shoulder confined space didn’t increase spread?

Fucking listen Don’t think they’ll continue way tbh  * 1 5 people Florida elderly. #1 country 20.5%

* 21.3 Million people 65 years age. #3 country.

* 66% adult ICU beds occupied.

This truly ticking time bomb. financed companies condition maintaining jobs. 

They Canada too, likely reason hit hard economically. kept things going every company slowly figured things rather facing ultimatums clients vendors every turn. blatantly wrong, absolutely targets old sick many many times young. Per CDC, like 80% deaths 65. pretty sure we've busted thru barrier already america. know saw guy wearing maga hat get hit bus im leaving. Wonder effect ""covid hoax"" posts subs like r/conspiracy people's lives. frustrating live state took seriously, good response, seemingly flattened curve, progress likely thrown away dumbasses wanted go casinos party beach. 

I mean, we're opening slowly (MoCo MD part following 14 day CDC guidelines), I'm pretty sure new wave make way fuck us Fall. said left house get food? groceries delivered fresh using delivery services. no, hard myself. Shipped right door. 

How pay food? work home major tech company. tech company pays work them. Simple that. yes, I'm employed. also savings saved since economic cycle seems every 10 years delve economic/pandemic depression sort. financial planning goes long way here. 

So savings account fall back everyone's priority. 6 Months least expenses account times. look becoming financial minimalist/frugality. That's able save money cost-benefit analysis purchases, including food. 

And upset Congress Government, rely heavily handouts survival. Becoming financially independent part obtaining American Dream. Living means giving temptation marketing/social media influencers purchasing decisions. 

So yes, easy stay home carving gameplan something like day one. understand essential workers cannot stay home pandemic, I'm mostly speaking Karens Chads longing haircuts, movies, chicken wings local Hooters. people, stay fuck HOME. I’m terrified weekend bring &amp; im NYC. get herd immunity, we're still talking 600,000 dead optimistic estimates IFR. Going 20% normal annual death rate pretty damn big deal, final total could end much, much higher that.  hear you.  feel discouraged. could job home.  boss let me. I'm Montana. hit highest cases today. 67.  last week 20% total cases.  one cares.  governor press briefing. pointless. like governor, running Senate anything hurt chances.  pretty much asked pretty please wear mask leaving businesses.  entire time wear mask coughed mic.  Lead example.  politicians fucking embarrassment. see. I’m fuckin jealous. number days symptom onset death Yes, it’s likely little late late, agree you, give credit it’s due. could doubled awfulness shown change course. Arizona needs hopefully pushed further, least he’s started move needs done Better make 6 months more. Starting see long groups I’m in. Wear masks. Nice reference -- get upvote! mean, rest world also downward trend, whereas Florida doubling every week. can't really call winner they've left starting gate governor essentially admitted today. Though sounded like deserved fate said it.  IFR issue death rate. IFR assumes 100% cases reported. reality probably like half even less half cases estimated reported. I've seen many reports estimate actual infected count like 5-10x reported count. basically impossible calculate IFR atm unreliable. reality mortality likely somewhere two. Also, I'm sure getting 0.6% last study seen estimated 1.00% IFR. Ive seen high 1.3% low like 1.04% world wide IFR average. 

Lastly, even assume 0.6% IFR... flu 0.1% common cold fraction that. estimates 70% worlds population get covid point.

It's estimated 35M Americans virus end year. flu, that's death toll 34,200 covid that's death told like 210,000 deaths. math fails add up. 

Rounding right US 131,000 deaths due covid. account massive spikes reported pneumonia bronchitis deaths, especially south estimates I've seen would put us closer around 175,000 deaths include significant spikes. even don't. 131,000 dead what... 4 months? There's still 6 months go year biggest flu/sickness season year kick us summer. really think eclipse 210,000 deaths then? that's official count let alone real death toll likely underneath surface. 

That makes near impossible IFR low 0.6%. probably 1.5% area, maybe slightly higher start get anti body testing data coming en mass likely show significantly higher reported infection rate cause change IFR. even that, they're making economy worse spreading disease.

Complete inability take new information alter behavior. Might well ride summer outside September able go indoors. summer Ontario Florida everyone retreats inside. Unless beach state park, air conditioning. come fall. quote someone Florida air conditioning Devil owned Hell Florida, would rent Florida live Hell!"" move large numbers home air conditioning thing.

Lol I'm Ontario never really thought like that. Today hottest day week far 94, it'll back mid 80's tomorrow.  Imagine kid fending adult wife gone.

They’re much busy It’s much curve point 0° vertical line. found neat life hack. bank account near $0. call credit card companies ask expand credit limit.

Edit: voila I'm embarrassment English language. Thankfully, disease shreds Boomers. incompetence kill strongest voting base. GG Trump. Bye bye Boomers lmao Ala gonna bama.

I idea means, feels absolutely accurate. testing detecting cases. Look deathrates, still trending down. Oh boy. college town, no, hardly anyone gives shit. bars shut days deep clean first positive test employee exception largest bar, 7 employees test positive. Pools packed person classes started Monday.

The largest contingent people saw wearing masks [apparently can't even say dude's name anymore.. fuck auto moderator] demonstrations. spike tests  past point isolation, masks social distancing eradicate wear masks, stop going non-essential trips March, excuse incompetence unpreparedness. looking deliberate malfeasance. sounds like trying turn legitimate concerns bizarre anti-vax thing... can't know long term impacts, months. know damage changes people's lungs, including asymptomatic cases. get covid, get covid get covid get control. wait point. well Washington D.C New York City. Holy shit, Nirvana predict pandemic along?? Yes, situational I'd like hear multiple sources look different situations well outdoor mask outdoor + mask. still made mind whether allowing businesses open outdoors good idea not. Batch size adjusted prevalence. U.S. still testing single digits positives. ""show bodies"" - Bryan ""Joe Rogan's BF"" Callen look 7 day moving average(gives clearer picture)on worldometers moving since around 10th 11th June roughly. 7 day moving average less plateaued first 10 days June. around 23rd 24th 7 day moving average really started climb levels higher saw April/May. I'd say we'll probably start see deaths rise within next 2 3 weeks also account delays deaths actually recorded. think deaths rise levels saw April since time mainly young catching it'll probably slight rise deaths. deaths dont rise within next 2/3 weeks I'll rather surprised. pandemic occur trump administration 😭😭
We’re going die. never said won’t treat you. implied that. say that. you. Also keep mind la county alone 10 million, additional 15 million Southern California. Theres lot people everywhere here. Basically population size florida maybe Alabama crammed one coastal area. Florida huge elderly population? matter time ember lands hay stack starts body count. No, onto soemthing. would like too, please sir ...please share teh druhgs.... anyone left infect New York?  Try get vaccinated open beaches 75, great prognosis go away people! like disappear. hosts gone. know tell besides point rates massively. Rolling 7 day death rates low 30 ~40 without taking account today's 64. Deaths lag behind infections take 3 weeks get test result (median time symptom onset death 3 weeks). There's also larger percentage young people contracting disease that's going bring CFR quite bit. People jump sexy title justify fear little critical thought validity looking Blame Trump straight incompetence issue, unfuckingbelievable True. hilarious thing town voted TV wrestler mayoral office Mixing *mean* median income mistake. means averages averages means. reason, mathematics word ""average"" generally used, favor discrete terms mean median.

From Merriam Webster:

Definition of average

 (Entry 1 3)

1a: a single value (such mean, mode, median) summarizes represents general significance set unequal values Well hope parents die, they're Tampa think one hot zones FL probably real pros/cons federal response vs. federalistic response (i.e. empower states).

Trump *not* empower states. example, states *have* open refused give financial support, states can't go debt way federal government can. pitted states try acquire PPE.

(This ignoring states ideologically committed opening up.) 2 3 weeks ago protests started. 2 3 weeks another spike 4th July.

Don't congregate big groups. contact adds exponentially (in literal mathematical sense) risk passing virus on. Mask no, remains same. think creating post good idea. can't comment karma lower 200. Anecdote- two cops entered small minority run sandwich shop Chicago. leaving, one cop wore mask. refused to- even though shop said mask service. course, anything it, cops. control virus comes human decency, enough going around. Sick tested now? find reusable cloth masks WAY bearable disposable paper ones. Hot, live that. hard wear mask wish people would think need stop ranting needing wear mask somehow infringes freedoms. Florida man busy kid get 13th birthday party month. neighbor thinks okay Fourth July gala though. They'll never admit saying. Even 6 weeks Hey Florida favor. Make November make sure none governer staff power ever .. developed countries much better. perfectly, mind, many European countries Canada virus control generous aid packages citizens.

The GOP driving America straight ditch. problem human nature, American ""conservatives"" logic seem compute.  ""slow next 2-3 years, big picture, leads deaths""...can describe works understand? Use model 100 people something? I'm interested. Hello Tim hemorrhagic fever unable go stealth? surprising? level stupid never witnessed mankind. Brazil? Antibody tests something around 70% accurate. antibodies disappear aren’t detectable couple months recent studies suggesting ...but still “immune” even antibody test negative assuming u infected say April. Yeah I'm little nervous say least returning students. Typically LU involvements 100% good impact economy area, could bad. I'm person faith, leftist per se, dont follow typical conservative viewpoints. belief God put people world help protect us, cautiously listen them, Otherwise wasted talent have. know probably doesnt align others belief. learned 20s ok opinion dont agree others lol. people cant get past that. ignoring point, testing gets better enough old people died (as tragic may be) cases get higher skew younger lowering deaths. happening WA, cases going long time deaths stable.

Pull recent source deaths. Spewed drink one Plus Coronavirus continues September-October. Halloween Horror Nights fucked since it’s popular event Orlando. RemindMe! 6 weeks “check post dumb think” therein lies problem. guess hoax him. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀🤣💀💀💀💀💀💀👌👌👌👌👌 PLEASE TELL TRUE 😭😭😭 Good job title lmfaoooo Cases started trending June 12th deaths still trending 3 weeks later.

Reality testing finding mild cases would missed before. Also treatment lot better virus deadly was. vaccine works targeting specific protein. long able strains don’t think issue. virus similar enough still work. done joke? know, ironically. Same! Haven’t bar since everything closed (had nice send bars, Kentucky bourbon tasting last stop Woodford Reserve), took month drinking mid May. I’ll occasionally grab 6 pack grocery shopping though now. 

There’s reason go bar right now. Crazy. don’t see folks can’t sit circle outside case beer small group friends. Even wouldn’t 100% safe transmission rate would much lower.... make less sick either. that’s indirectly linked COVID. virus around, likely wouldn’t died.

Deaths like often counted “true death toll” pandemics, unfortunately related.  love signing onto meetings seeing kids sitting lap pup kitty. Makes smile. Never problem.  saddened this. 

Attend rally, wear masks - distance yourselves... mean, enough room space everyone. 

This done thoughtlessly needlessly. New York deaths 32,165 (1,653 per million people).

Florida deaths 3,618 (168 per million people). it, I'm proud boys they'd start relying hospitalizations indicator. Reverting back March/April capabilities tracking virus.   Except cancer communicable act like big deal. Perhaps could provide links studies show masks aren’t effective, least list reasons believe aren’t effective.  Well yes, is.

Why many people Reddit immediately assume everything argument? Peaches came China, COVID-19 also came China.

Coincidence? think not. propose Georgia intentionally growing COVID-19 like grow peaches.

/s violent drug frankly useless lot cases. shown make difference patients intubated. benefit might make worse; seem get better likely.

Likely stressed word. anywhere be. [Per Mayo Even infection COVID-19 virus creates long-lasting immunity, large number people would become infected reach herd immunity threshold. Experts estimate U.S., 70% population — 200 million people — would recover COVID-19 halt epidemic. many people become sick COVID-19 once, health care system could quickly become overwhelmed. amount infection could also lead serious complications millions deaths, especially among older people chronic conditions. 

Hundreds thousands deaths would unlikely best-case scenario went herd immunity route. mention heatwaves hit people start spending time indoors. issues nothing said opposite that. 

But isn’t one situation. need safe handling food prevent bacterial growth handle principles absent wet markets. butcher meats surfaces aren’t regularly clean, meat byproduct often improperly disposed. 

Additionally, antibiotic resistance emerging use antibiotics factory farming hazardous different animals closer proximity resulting zoonotic transmission

I entirely sure point beside moving goal
Post? Wetmarkets aren’t bad bad factory farming practices?

Or shouldn’t criticize China western nations problem overuse antibiotics meat production?

Well use antibiotics fix one problem resulted other. new market antibiotic free meat. 

And safe handling practices used everywhere too, I've never thankful Canadian before. Wow CNN article too. Amazing actually lmao 10,000 cases one day, holy crap! saving check think infected, feel free visit local government official discuss lack testing face face. test you, need wear mask. also treat children like adults grow up. really wish this. think point pushing onto urgent care push overhead cost onto business. business pay employees 4th July bonus instead govt.

And business gets set fee per test, eating extra cost.

Super shifty normal time. Damn near criminal pandemic.

Honestly politician elected official position taking time right now, people waiting tested, people waiting test results, people waiting unemployment payouts, medical professionals burning midnight oil keep medical system collapsing. Gotta slow testing! Yay we’re finally winning something!  believe you. I'm Tampa times I've week yet see mask less person. Maybe Jacksonville completely different 50% claim sounds fishy since places turning patrons away perspective consider teachers reasonable (speaking teacher myself) refuse go back. due nation-wide teacher shortage, would hard fire teachers provide historical example hundreds countries data analyze today's economy. realize people keep alive helps economy. wow, government would provide financial aid help burden instead funneling billions dollars corporations. HMMMM something government could help one step quicker going back normal. even kill you, may still fuck real good, long time, rest severely shortened life. might kill leave crippling debt disabilities greatly reduced happiness. Fuck that. Say flat coming holy goddamn shit watching news? Unfortunately 100% right. way hospitals handle incoming wave patients. already happening Arizona, Texas Florida. 4 days ago AZ. Houston hospitals patients hospitals sometimes 50 miles away. 

This trend going continue. Add 4th July, recipe disaster. Ohio seeing OSU requiring masks campus online classes disappointing. really think colleges follow USC seems safety measures went window soon everyone cause left right .cases predictably blew point fingers shouldn’t surprise given partisan nature America shit hoped pandemic would different. thing exponential growth seems fine (or least manageable) suddenly doesn’t, point it’s far late. definitely think video games (Pokemon, animal crossing) contributed highest level English classes growing up. I’m fan reading books all. hope you’re correct sir. knew nobody could out-incompetence us.. Please it. work higher education, administrators say students eager return campus. many forty staff faculty members like preexisting conditions, required return work face furlough firing. looking anther job, can't afford quit.  Hospitals starting fill critical care decisioning give beds , back.  Oh absolutely. points Tantrum Yam himself. similar inventing atomic bomb, using tech power cities. ""Omg Harrold, got coronavirus?!"" *Pops bottle wine* ""hell yeah .."" Mixture several factors: 

1. young people getting infected, average age new cases 35, smaller portion expected die. may true much longer - recent data Florida shows getting older population )
2. Greatly increased testing capturing large number milder/asymptomatic cases went un-confirmed previously, portion sick people among new cases currently smaller.
3. Better treatment - report UK said probability death 1/4th April hospitalized patients, probably due better ventilation management, anti-coagulation anti-inflammation treatments. See probably go current spread continues (it's testing leading cases, percentage tests coming back positive increasing well, spreading faster, see track percentage tests come back positive), time around time get spread control things reach New York levels crisis. Unfortunately, think time now, many states squandering it. Thank taking time research subject. That's unfortunate I'm sorry hear that. Unfortunately, sad stories change principles. Wearing seatbelt personal choice. government get dictate that. even they're ignored. Clearly ineffective. pro choice crowd says, ""my body choice"". Yea lived predominantly asian neighborhood completely normal see everyone wearing masks flu season general throughout year. clerks local grocery retail stores donned masks even wore gloves handing cash. big deal we're pandemic dont understand adopting habit hard people do. RemindMe! 4 weeks (not disagree want see pans out.) even dying economy. economy recover pandemic control. Trump appointed fed chairman screaming top lungs.

People dying small temporary bumps stock market, Trump's failing election chances. thing dying for. 

What fucking mess. cake day. DeepState confirmed. contract today get point needing hospitalized, point would probably 2-3 weeks today. Depending exactly live, perils exponential growth may well hospitals capacity then. there's risk infecting others, contributing worsening burden health care system, knowing long would even immunity afterwards, etc. think *intentionally* getting sick sounds pretty dumb. Remember- rich simply machine production. happily let die save comically small amounts money give bonus savings. worry covid bounties heads action leadership except, ""it's hoax."" guys can't catch break. obviously well contained reason worry. comments article genuinely make lose faith humanity. People think made up, compare going party sick driving. Updated flair. refuse return lose unemployment benefits...I suspect governor made connection well. let south leave. think right then, now?

Or wrong times ... that’s people like portray things. live seminole county area near orlando. Mask mandate went effect yesterday. Went Wawa today fill tires almost everyone going inside wearing mask. People need fined violating this. Otherwise blatantly ignore it. Businesses need strictly prevent anyone wearing mask entering facility. tagged simply ""USA"" ""Good News"" ? Yes. present growth rate ""locked in"" due lag expressing symptoms progressions disease (including death). So, depending upon stat looking at, even started something significant today see benefit least 2 weeks.

So, hold butts. turn around time atrocious, wife’s aunt tested 5 days ago, still wait nurses able HANDle situation. Tres Bien! fucked... alternative? can't situation everyone it...? It’s Florida It’s death cult here. Anything fearsome truth. Anything lends better situation misinformation. article removed USA USA USA USA! must hard him. exactly same. fatal flaw reactor hidden actual operators plant state secret. new cases seen one day New York state 11,571 April 14... Yeah, bad Florida. definitely trend afternoon. Knowledge Internet search away. Human lives important, comes point realize socio-economic consequences we’re inflicting upon younger generations worth prevent deaths disease whose mortality rate essentially zero them? There's interesting sociological study done Disney Park fanatics. probably occupies part psyche religious fervor does. 

You would pay go there; would much rather spend month traveling Latin America SE Asia weekend one parks. Swaggerty swooty, I'm comin' dat...sausoogy? I'm skeptical source guy quoted article provide data. guess we'll know sure weeks...

RemindMe! 3 weeks Agree. politicians, leaders, ""influencers"" go TV without mask partly blame. important set good example people follow. Why? cannot wait read retraction Uygggghhhh no. ICUs Texas hospitals reaching capacity. positivity rate 20% GOOD especially case numbers also increasing dramatically. Deaths take time catch new daily cases. It’s frustrating see people incapable looking ahead realizing cases spiking today, take 2-6 weeks longer see resulting spike deaths COME. Especially hospitals overrun (as happening) don’t anything control spread. 

We also suspect decent number people “mild” cases continue damage lungs parts body long time. insignificant. many testing sites holiday weekend presumably virus taking long weekend off. post removed cannot verify reliable source. Twitter sources may reliable. possible, please re-submit link reliable source (i.e. news article).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* comment wins internet today me. Bravo We’ll boomers flying around like actual bombs lol things open Canada (with precautions), lockdown never I'd call strict. Unlike many places restaurants able takeout throughout, people could go outside whenever wanted. time tell right decision, given virus slowing personally believe was. 

On completely unrelated note, Chris Selley tool National Post hot garbage. New viagra don’t remember finally started opening testing centers, full lockdown. said video people think mask cure-all exhibit riskier behavior wearing mask improperly understand purpose mask-- reduce spread, completely eliminate spread. People touch faces often think mask stops everything. still get sick, say Fauci made up. fall category. Science clearly shows seatbelts don’t work /s Uh really. larger cities lots restrictions. ‘Open’ loose term. major area still outdoor seating that’s stopping. 

Shocking can’t acknowledge something might go political ideals could cause spread. 

How Florida supposed stop spread three weeks ago unapproved mass gatherings? Oh wait, people leisure time spread covid. keep forgetting. new version seems multiply faster upper respiratory tract — nose, sinuses throat – would explain passes around easily, researchers said. tests 1,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients showed infected new version fare worse caught original strain.

That seems saying potency hasn’t changed. It’s potent original. hasn’t gotten worse. know why. Thanks bringing important point. People really think second wave means cases hit 0 spike lol \*Lord Farquaad entered chat\* allowed tell feel. refuse come lose unemployment want eat work. Please... Please come. even 80k day 10k today means 1 8 people already it. 

that means can't really double 3 times. else 8 8 people would it.

Say 1/8th now. 

So next week 2/8ths get it. 

Then 4/8ths get it. 

So 7 8 people would already it. room another doubling here. shameful fucking display, discrace ful country that? actually reason world believe that’s possible? Thanks article, following reaction author article, submitter: country constantly taking ""it's bad within arm's length everything's okay!"" Stance?

States demanded open month ago ""wE dOnT coroNaVIRUs."" giant wall around state keeping out? also get paid Friday think ""Well, that's it! I've got enough money last forever!""

Young people get shit pass old people. fuck think Gertrude NY got from? fucking tv?

Anyways, good luck everyone! yeah, seems so.. there's another sports business currently based orlando, wwe.. pretty clear owner keen enforcing precautions. can’t wait new ‘Guinness World Record Award’ Florida gained ‘record breaking’ Covid-19 case numbers single day!  Another essential business forced closed! Muh freedums!

/s Aw, love area. Grew Mobile. 0.5% death rate adequate medical treatment. Exponential grow means population infected time. due limited capacity treatment them. I’m going seriously bummed if/when season gets cancelled. Football Sundays favorite part autumn winter. Going whole year without going create massive void life I’ve never experienced. fan get it.

I’ll find things time, but’s it’s going weird sad time. problem,

and solved it. Universal already open. Like wtf. Remember- rich simply machine production. happily let die save comically small amounts money give bonus savings. disagree. Safety measures go window everyone fighting cause.

One side protested outside, chalk lines around immunocompromised protesters ensure adequate social distancing, wore masks consistently, handed masks, small protests, complete social distancing. even multiple online conferences leaders limit protesting around others. also higher rate individuals go otherwise many quarantined two weeks protested.

The side protested masks, social distancing, confiscated masks protesters. Ripped masks protesters pepper spray directly, attacked medical tents.

So I've seen looked into, sides throw safety measures window. One side did. one side correlates spikes, seen limited cases result advocacy.

There huge spikes cities left leaning correspond left leaning protests. spikes corresponding reopening soon, holiday weekends, protesting wearing masks. provide historical example? Perhaps consequences economic collapse manifested anywhere yet? Everyone would better acted earlier. doesn’t validate strategy implemented late. 

It’s like claiming you’re late, arrived earlier would time. definitely going challenge important remember we've never really need coronavirus vaccine. mean SARS kind died vaccine ever needed really affected China since west escaped it. time however clear need vaccine since unlikely virus disappear like SARs pretty much every country affected understand heard part. Birds dogs Zoom just... Well, annoys me. seen? That's strange. sort rationalization? trolling people here, really think need read article posted OP full. seem understand first wave *never ended*. *no second wave*. dip count end one wave start another. dipped 25,000 cases day plateaued short continuing rise.I

As epidemiologist wrote article, ""First, virus would controlled transmission brought low level. would end first wave. Then, virus would need reappear result large increase cases hospitalizations."" Yep. Imagine that. 

It 2020, bets off. Maybe time invest shotgun. broken recently. Unending suffering Ah, yes, like get medical information American Institute Economic Research. I'm sure agenda against, say, shutdown pandemic. would batch size Florida Arizona?  They’re ones running tests. people old enough vote. would've increased somewhat already. even little bit. Something else play here. Virus weakening lower herd immunity threshold? Surges fine control death rate. confident Texas so? Yup. kid didn’t get birthday party either. It’s sad. Watching Desantis Pence basically say nothing wrong even sadder. source good job presenting sides. u/DreamSofie present one side.

The issue death rate substantially dropped level infections. question why. One possible explanation, set forth Italian doctors, virus selected adaption humans become less lethal - phenomena seen many times viruses, since lethality maladaptive trait. nobody surprised r/nottheonion making assumptions IMO. 

Like % people think get tested - whole population? 

It's possible virus already hitting legitimately large % total population, now. Better start building hospitals 3 days Shucky Ducky, sucks. Happy cake day. area State border. never tested, said. MaH FrEeDoM Asymptomatic, no. Mildly symptomatic, yes. people sick can’t get get tested it’s tiring. 

A lot people underestimate many cases mild cases. 9 family members got akin cold/cough flu one them, worse flu symptoms. 

Nyc highest testing rates entire world. 1-2% population tested positive. antibody results came back (98.9% specificity) 24.9% city it. That’s unbelievably large gap, it’s massive gaps seeing nearly antibody tests. don’t!!!!
That’s part point. did, they’ll pass students, bring home. California also roughly double population consistently applying tests. Despite that, FL new case rate 7 day average actually higher CA's. CA slightly lower positivity rating opposed FL. could due adherence lockdown measures neither state controlling thing effectively. thats insane whats n number covid anyways? link info also information states? know reliable worldometers overall, absolutely contributor one way other. overall infection fatality rate somewhere .5% 1%. case fatality rate 5% ish, lowering testing more. IFR also heavilty stratified age. talking something like .1% 30-50, less younger, 1% 60-70, like 10% 70. 

IFR = many deaths per infection
CFR = many deaths per case - case defined positive RT-PCR test Floridump. Rising sea levels can't come soon enough. don’t put burger haha. give little dipping packets fries put burger nobody People way princes princesses entitled? /s Stay inside help nation, still heart left.  Good know. Thank you. Maybe it’s county, local hospital said covid patients stemmed Trump administration guidelines? Yeah, dumb. Listening Trump usually is. Cuomo cancelled soon afterwards.   
   
Interestingly, sparked complete break following national guidelines, developing state specific ones, worked well end. question, sending recovering patients (to free hospital beds) good idea. Property values drop Florida USA os dumpster fire right now. even funny anymore. yearly physical today.

We telehalth runny nose, temp 99, light cough sense taste dulled. 99 percent sure allergies. Anyways appointment 1030. created order get tested hospital. 50 minute wait behind 8 cars. results 3 days quarantining. know buy results 3 days maybe done hospital mass testing site quicker.

I always worn mask avoided indoor settings except gas stations buy nicotine pouches.

Edit: I'm Pinellas Co, FL lol.  Arizona thing also triaging people. lol. Everythings Fine Gif Here. Well least number deceased would go Arguably, declining education funding blamed population’s poor response. Overspending military means education gets starved. Yeah like wtf everything’s locked need travel vouchers? Cause somebody stock hotels.... Likely, recent testing figures showed 70k people tested daily.  population tested random would true, consider people receiving tests. agree you, Orlando resident worker want say shhhh protecting home right now?

I would act like positive, physically separate. keep windows open, wear masks inside, wash hands, use separate bathrooms, eat together, knew second nba said planning bubble concept Disney Florida would find way fuck sports coming back. never pay? Free rent year. He’s cancer survivor mid 70s. looking good all. See tomorrow  Vietnam, Korea, China handled pandemic remarkably better. look US true almost 10 years now. I’m pretty sure producing 300 million doses US. least hope. believe quote something like, imagine stupid average person is, American. But, still works. Americans people something something. Buying groceries lot less efficient don’t anywhere store them, stove microwave cook with, utensils prepare food with. you’re homeless, actually make lot sense spend dollars meal eat restaurant, figure grocery store food assemble meal parking lot. Aren’t they? Hopefully. never know people spent 3 months locked Big Rapids returning home state Texas assist family quarantining long haul. exposed local national reports, well local gossip, chatter, etc, informative privilege.

Don't forget Michigan's struggle unemployment talking point decade. Studies point general apathy amongst Michiganders seek work even demand labor high, factors play. 

This trivialize unemployment spike due lockdown orders, argue away concerns citizens, though hardly anyone crowd protested unemployment (Michigan supplementary benefits resident impacted lockdowns. separate traditional unemployment recourse. program still running knowledge) rather protested tyranny Whitmer's Stay-at-home orders, loss undefined liberties pertaining said orders, general dissatisfaction unable shop recreate.

It unemployment issue, financial issue protested - protest lockdown pure simple. group cheered state GOP sued Whitmer, group brought weapons Lansing case crumbled.

There real argument, point reinforced images violence towards Whitmer, death threats, wielding hand weapons loaded firearms untrained ill-disciplined owners... back calls open boat docks, golf courses, hair salons. People stormed capital building waving loaded weqpons (legal Michigan) intent scare hell lawmakers, did. 

The moment weapon introduced disagreement said weapon relevant, threat. weapon loaded/aggressively brandished, terroristic. Wait, NBA supposed play soon too?


hopefully players back Florida fucking royally Parliamentary democracy concept know ministerial responsibility **serious** mistake made ministry whether Minister Deputy Minister (usually civil servant) chain, Minister resigns.

The Minister political appointee usually member parliament, rough equivalent cabinet secretary US. think worry tourists point. least deal neighboring state tourists. many idiots want fly US like people would typically do. estimate annual flu deaths. Overall, CDC estimates 12,000 61,000 deaths annually since 2010 blamed flu. Globally, World Health Organization (WHO) estimates flu kills 290,000 650,000 people per year. estimate please. There's dozens studies this. [Even one Come fuck on. Stopped parroting propaganda points. can't fake excess deaths. 5.3 million dollars vs $30,000 anyone's lazy kind what’s going tho .. retract statements mass deaths cold... Sure, point crisis, swift action needed, less effective. Still best system got, even infested corporate influence/corruption. die, that's risk I'm willing take. trying conversation months ago people throwing much shade me. “You shouldn’t kids can’t take care them. want kill teachers selfish you? kid either gonna delayed dead one would rather have?“ much more.

Honestly people assholes it’s trending jump bandwagon. Considering headed pence I'd agree.... maybe reform instead tho Fifth works you’re facing criminal charges. Would really much opportunity? would expect trend toward mass graves circumstances might harder market enter. colloquial use terms interchangeable. Disney fans great, LONG also Disney fan absolutely agree hivemind thinks. perfect world them, try shatter illusion...well...they like that... Yeah, knew lot legally work, know carried out. Thank you.  Wait weeks mere notion Disney opening Disney World 1.5 weeks abhorrent. 

There's way that's happening now. Obviously going get canceled. lot people assholes also blame misinformation ('it's flu' 'not contagious sick' 'masks useless' etc etc) officials giving start epidemic (which still point) still combined idiot chief spouting bullshit. 
They deliberately lied us people dying, hope going hold responsible accountable (or case well). every doctor nurse place crisis. Many specialize areas low demand right now.

Our *current* problem shortage medical personnel. Yeah, want die car crash afraid getting sick. Normal times it'd like 12 hours, right traffic lighter closer 9, that's still long drive. Like lily pads pond friends moved near Orlando Michigan last year go Disneyland often. 40s kids. love place. changed jobs, sold house renting, hang often.

They've even stayed one resorts one weekend already moved there. 30 minutes house. Boggles me.

Took kids 16 years ago. enough me. Fair enough. taking kids that's important then?  Florina wouldn’t 1162. China also least 3 candidates Phase III. Glad I'm one ^^^Lizard ^^^people ^^^unite Gap years soar now. wow  got here.. predicting? there? spend time standing lines. Disney owns fucking everything, though younger people driving new outbreak infect older populations 

Can't really blame taking seriously lied risks 4 months. point wouldn’t trust government check groceries. charge making sure people got fed you’d millions starving professionals though? take look CFR versus IFR, key discussion irony statement.  mean ocean?

Nah, possible way knowing all. like attended large indoor gathering thousands people wearing masks anything Much likely normal respiratory problem Covid, look graph loss smell taste highly correlated actual Covid diagnosis, everything else poorly correlated. deaths low? Median age around 30. Serious question - point going realize it’s bad get it’s young ones contracting virus people aren’t dying? know we're playing golf scoring? yEs Teh CoNomy Okay, prove wrong. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's hard pill swallow, know. [The state covid prices go entitlement people have. help disney cut package benefits staffing levels time number recent years. Oh. Plenty people seriously believed masks protect wearers. parroting US health authorities said, something line of, ""my mask protect me, protects me, mask protects you."" I've heard repeatedly over. browse around early posts subreddit April, see plenty evidence that. Yep. this. also leads ask, getting infected eyes much easier thought? I'd like see studies run include people without eye protection well. still living mom's basement 49 EU travel ban world. say much country one exceptions. consider mansion far north Scottsdale dead mothers basement, it. expect it'll different everything's open, they've already consolidated reserved stays Animal Kingdom Lodge one two halves, citing demand, least coming resort-only stays somewhat less expected.

I'll leave one magic spoiled resort finally open without gigantic game Covid Roulette. Well deaths aren’t level Don’t forget Evangelical Christian copy pasted post. Dr Fauci said could 100,000 new cases day. beyond people still get it. Death rate? Well kudos owning seems like New Zealand ok Corona wise anyway Idiots go funeral. reason risk life reckless dead person. Right. He's still person currently cult. start negotiating dehumanize people that's start getting troublesome territory. Ala-fucking-bama (as cousin Vinny would say) Like rats carried plague back day Mickey Mouse spreads corona. Agreed, actually sick. got tested Orange County convention center June 22nd still haven’t received results, says they’re still processing. I’ve even tried calling emailing. wonder many people tested received results? Seems like numbers could lot worse... cares anymore states, gene pool kind shallow.

In states, family trees like dense, root-bound family shrubs. God they're gonna shut gym they... *Bryan Kemp entered chat, made mod, kicked Stacey Abrams* Right.  mean every major county widespread outbreaks. basically unavoidable.

Wait.. China almost 5x population? like 5% total number infections?

Oh South Korea managed contain too? 

Should embarrassed?  Unless it’s 401k! live democracy Crazy live panhandle come contact thousands tourists job every day. Yet one workplace even cold. Also crazy Eglin shipped bunk tests back since false positives 70%. Even crazier nurses Sacred Heart Miramar gave back unused swabs silent protest last week results came back positive without actually performing test themselves. Wild. figures likely undercount number cases factor 10! means today 100,000+ new cases Florida. also looking grim. Thanks putting perspective It’s myth bro. testing Florida actually gotten shit ton better. reporting... that's debate people wear masks grocery stores. people travel vacations/parties/recreation understand things equally dangerous. Ducey governor heavy critic since gubernatorial inception he's quick change attitude ever since father Trump left valley. 

He's finally acknowledging data, asking people wear masks, re-closed bars gyms (but left dine-in restaurants open stupid imo). 

So he's fucked thing plenty, he's moments throughout he's done smart thing. feel fair acknowledge right thing I'm gonna criticize things. I'm glad he's ignoring acting like nothings happening point. Dude looked kinda spooked recent press conferences. got nothing correct ""he despite much knowledgable virology confirm biases""? Florida needs go 10x deaths. doubt it. No, I'm asking you, saying scientists lie enough evidence?

Because implying scientists say public ""there's evidence happening"" crisis. offended want clarification? think it’s apt comparison virus assess intentions host body determining whether it'll infect person? Frankly people countries disagree Americans like validation I'm correct point.

Protesting outdoors wearing mask fight civil rights partying beach it’s 4th July 

Hope helps. doubt will, seems can’t understand simple concepts like “freedom”. can't stop feeling democracy failure? would prefer meritocracy. RAND PAUL SAID!!!!....

Oh goodness. LIE!? original concept sequel ""26 weeks later"", marketing boys shot down.  Funny, cause post gives distinct impression understand exponents cause periodic doubling exist. feel like asshole writing this, don’t mean assholish way....

This article essentially acknowledgement vast majority people can’t afford kids. system collapses without subsidy public education.

On one hand, kinda angers I’m picking slack people work job let anyone schooled-aged kids work home whatever flex hours want....but hand it’s *everyone* kids need accommodation, problem system parents. You’re 49?? Jesus that’s impressive you’ve managed stay ignorant long. Florida state income tax. understanding due primarily tourism. So, Disney hotel tax revenue... dont either  inevitable. Americans love gambling dumbfounded saw governor isn’t going back reopening people listen doctors... one two.

EDIT: weeks ago made coronavirus service disqualifing new enlistees. MUH BEACHES! 

BUT MUH PARTIES!

BUT MUH DRINKING!!

BUT MUH SOCIAL LIFE!!!

BUT SEX LIFE!!!! 0.5% US population comes million spend money military protect Americans. spend money military force will. super fucked up.  Makes sense. I’ve surprised they’re releasing somewhat timely numbers since point (and point soon, active duty cases keep surging) may become force readiness concern don’t want talked loudly. single parent two earning household absolutely true unless remote worker completely flexible schedule. Golf positive tests continued playing. EPL well. fucked USA going herd immunity point. remember someone calculation they'd need 35K new cases day 3 years work. Herd immunity ""works"", takes years highest casualty rates. Millions die USA herd immunity takes effect. not. US anyway. first wave never ended. Places like California, Florida, Texas opened upward swing things. really surprising happing states go look stats. What’s odd take 50 days places see big acceleration? states worse break earlier better even places. open back infected numbers really low per population course it’s going spread fast. Watch North East states tread much manageable pace. polarizing. either love think im horrible misogynist. Idk people vote never change mind they’re ones make sure (and get easy access) vote want poor people work risk life. parents took opposite shifts. grandma used say know ever created first two kids parents ""like two ships passing night."" 
They sometimes hired university student named Sandra watch us. take shit parents fortunate find her. Logically, fed program cover smaller land lord could hold situation over. instead that, decide play drag play politics instead. many people gonna end dead whole thing....its terrifying  I'm far advocating anyone got amusement park long time. abstaining. clearly understand theme park employees' mindsets way quick pass labels. Man, wonder AEW going do. numbers scary   mosquitoes aren’t going strike. They’ll part make experience authentic. Grats USA!! Keep up!! appears already posted: .If think made mistake, [please let us automatically generated message* Hi, thanks taking questions!

With CDC publishing likely overall CFR .4%, seems point IFR of...less .4%. Coupling median age death 80s overall weekly mortality normal range, time explore strategies effectively protect vulnerable, enabling majority population resume semblance normal life? Goodness really sucks sub basically kids /r/politics masquerading infectious disease experts deaths dropping since mid-April across US: 


Cases up, deaths down, guess what? means disease deadly thought. Correct Texas here. one time went March instead usual February, finally understood people would leave hugely expensive park much day go back hotel pool. 

That said, I've also seen people Arizona complain stuck wearing pants day go outside summer months, guess takes kinds! aware cult put us jeopardy. wish town would boot out. want here. zip codes nyc happened, wasn’t hit evenly. nyc like said  HEARD PUERTO RICAN GUYS! every number time sensitive? skewed metrics actual numbers? Oh my, I’d love good old interpretation current events George Carlin. good news implies good job testing. Faster doubling would imply testing playing catch up.

I know, that's like dark place full angry wolves saying ""at least flashlight working"", something. graduated bachelors business. even wealth assets, baby boomers highest income spend generation. !remindme 1 week mail testing. fauci's new wave actually means 100k new cases per day thought NY quarantine based trusting travelers, opposed forcibly locking 2 weeks. agree you. agrees you. Fauci gone record saying mistake.

But going follow disregard him? dude right *everything* else, he's owned mistakes. Barring sudden science ""archon truth"" appearing, I'd rather deal guy who's enough expert know he's talking humble enough tell us fucked up. honest.

Masks help, save you, need protect doctors first. them, public die. use stocks made. make etc. same. honest front, people could made masks worn masks earlier. Florida gonna Florida 80% people get sick end hospital. That's said. That's consistent since Feb/March backed data. different saying 80% asymptomatic. 

Just wrong mean people overly pedantic. case, understanding simply wrong. She’s pretty upset me. I’ll leave be. No, still much better take exponential rate. going much smaller difference. Since 29th 30th days account 3/4ths sum total.  Nice. Can't wait see numbers today this... Mods, article title match biased one contributor provided. mean statement made FSU, yes correct. meant capacity wise attraction wise, masks required, etc. feel exact way appears US knows work one accord faced outside threats, pitted itself.
A house wars stand. feeling now? Amarillo, small city. They’re 13th hardest-hit region Texas — wouldn’t bad Texas huge. Unfortunately, results lag 14 days so. comes, family pretend fine. you’re community socially distancing wearing mask, yes it’s risk they’re willing take. you’re taking correct measures protect yourself, dad going massage affect you? Personally think combo massive homelessness problem dense conservative clusters sprinkled throughout state. Bold assume Americans would wear N95s might something. Never going happen. I’m Utah still don’t sort mask policies. said wear there’s penalty don’t. even understand saying. going go waves long while. reopen, bunch people get virus, we'll tighten little bit avoid hospitals getting overrun. continue cycle like time reopen number cases skyrocket up, vaccine widely distributed, point treatment means hospitalization rate vastly reduced.

And yes, reach points re-evaluate mask use social distancing protocols.  already hospice care, family really hoping accomplish? Another week two misery?

We society real problem death letting go. Heroic care costs without regard human dignity outcome absurd done benefit living, sake one sick dying. way - DeSanctis yet parents still wanna dine restaurants 😬 likely 0 deaths fluke, determined previous deaths covid related. Pyromancer Ascension, one fave MtG cards. made account started playing Arena. :)

p.s. misspelled cause drunk set MTGO user name 🤣 mom calls paranoid refuses wear mask public Look could point fingers days, let’s politicize let thoughts prayers run it’s course don’t know much teaching biz, can’t use Zoom Skype hold classes? Seems like mistake send kids back school thing burning control. feels next useless. doesn’t take account policy changes next decade whatsoever. living totally different world 2030. proof that, compare 2020 2010. 2010 2000. Fuck idiots, I'm gonna keep working remotely morons clean virus mess created ignorance. talk people country like they’re enemy “destroying country”. don’t know make better, try see together. differences smaller share. 

We need unifying vision better future, used American dream obviously we’ve failed make attainable everyone. don’t know that.  order

I know cover up. impossible hide flooding hospitals

2 Florida already surpassed numbers New York locked on.

3 could indeed take go 

4 Yes signs starting now. hospitals sending patients hospitals full getting close.

5 really hospitals fault best can. probably neither Danish Swedish...  He's wrong. We're trending opposite direction *lot* happen 50 days (as we've seen). Well. Better tell doctors that. RIP given times in, doubt police going risk conflict face covering two week lag time new cases, deaths.

Sometimes month lag time die COVID die slowly. Care make another Nostradamus level prediction death rate like spike month ago?

Texas Florida's pneumonia death rate has, remember correctly, quadrupled last year, yes, believe two states fudging numbers.

But time transpired since beginning pandemic. better understanding treat get sick virus ensure survive. studies say vitamin level seems impact sick someone gets. Summer sun may helping this, especially warmer states like Florida Texas.

Ultimately, know. take PANDEMIC still seriously help protect vulnerable society.

When Michigan first shut sent us home work full time two weeks. Then, went Tuesdays Thursdays alone buildings 

Then got sick. 3 weeks part time work home.

Followed month 3 days home, 2 days office.

Last week returned office every day.

Always worked full time. Never unemployment. No, exactly. Yes, husband cannot sit home, mainly, viruses don’t go away. Every one that’s ever existed still there. vaccines now. And, realistically, people luxury able stay home indefinitely vaccine developed virus. Bills paid. want keep home. people don’t understand touch normal people live. safe eat fast food now? Wendy's since early March, hungry way home today stopped one. concerned exposed virus one two workers drive-thru eating food prepared someone virus. legitimate concern? small city AZ, people organizing anti mask protest. Talk ""dont sheep"". following idiot right slaughter. understand public. People naturally suspicious government authority. way win people's respect change story. consistent concise honest. result Middle East country nationality. 2 weeks? exactly. Last week saw huge influx cases. yes, going see increase daily deaths now. Call back see parents could care children equally sure, think guy picture Thanks fact checking quote. done posting. guess end math works same, made sure quote correct Thanks. I'm Spain, even political parties agree completely government doing, still supported prorogation 'state alarm', knew better decentralised, local different responses pandemic, unified effort needed. still coworkers family traveling big get togethers 4th. no, fucking understandable whatsoever. blood hands much anyone else's. ended mask shortage. know know? WORK SUPPLY CHAIN. 

&amp;#x200B;

There price GOUGING much true, always HUGE volume masks various sellers pushing hospitals. refused buy masks used sell 0.04 $0.29 each. FUCK THEM. rest world declares extends travel bans US. seems increasingly like GOP end plan kill many voters possible November, since heavily impacted people groups normally vote them. 

I guess okay letting Russia set bounties US troops mostly vote you, would get squeamish letting pandemic kill US civilians mostly vote you? slippery slope, sheer cliff. Getting home mortgage harder married, easier. 

Lenders comfortable married couple two unmarried people relationship, understandable. buying house together, plan using income proof financial eligibility, partner typically show extensive records income helps putting money joint bank account ~1 year. n

The time possible eradicate virus would isolate first person!! wuhan moment got it. Even possibly virus geno type would still within bats NZ cases already government mandated isolation, except one case moved hospital.
No active cases able contact public Would really surprised? looks like Florida newspapers reporting one slowest seasons ever. makes refusal shut even asinine. know *call* walking clearly goofy running. He's going lot Texans' blood hands putting state risk. safe stay someone’s house stay one rooms share restroom ?  thinking Texas appropriate saying closing barn doors livestock already left building might apply well actually added source, looked up. said multiple interviews distance great way slow spread. Guess Europe many rising states haven't... That's right, keeping distance. hit 10K confirmed cases day still can't admit wrong track. going continue get worse.

I guess time fire next data person. Well least anyone left vote shitty government again. I'm really sure going point good day. clearly communicating properly. 💚 Yeah. Tourism helped us number locals stubborn well. still think better country regard, fair share mask haters town :-( Small town Texas, city, suburb? come happening now? everybody sub thought would, spring break?

My first guess say spring break mostly happened outside beach went back respective States, thus causing numbers home states rise, rather Florida's. seems State residents Contracting state reopening stores, restaurants churches. 

That's speculation noticing correlation. cannot prove causative link anything think dangerous try that, matter obvious seems, remember wrong sub swore Florida Louisiana case numbers would absolutely Skyrocket middle end March, happen. telling number high. Mickey going wear mask It’s interesting many retirees gone there, property taxes high. Unless loophole allowed low property taxes mobile homes? Brits think everyone one Americans recoil word. beginning. Societal collapse actually table again... underestimating amount people strongly believe virus another flu worse hoax. abhor wearing masks especially since President country think necessary. 

There reason China taking seriously. empires fall. 6 months near flu season, bloodbath. failed leadership looks like wonder death rate is? user name nod Young Pyromancer magic gathering? think see ""I'll see guys tomorrow"" ""Well us"" ""oof"" ""well got dark"" thread every day past week KEKW absolutely, tho way spread place like NYC, that's one reasons NYC got hit worse initially. Plus car culture here, everyone's got one majority people take public transportation.  Congrats 👏 theory. low death rate due lower viral loads transmitted, thanks UV rays sun, killing virus speed light. soon enter winter season, expect mortality rise back. sequels always worse I'm sure field workers US citizens considered essential workers, food come somewhere. test positive, sick, likely able work forced stop working. Correct! mindboggling much people ignored threat virus.

I kind sure wife caught mild case February cold January. mild, want anyone get worse flu ever had. Little bit melodramatic. NY gov already made tweaks social distancing policy. I'm kind doubtful we'll see explode NY flu season, knowing traumatized people NY first peak. People stupid, they're goldfish. really don’t know America ever able reverse ethical intellectual rot. many, spite malice virtue. ""Mask Experts"" now? Abbott saying f fauci last months. exponential increase cases fault. mean, one example:

ban smoking. 

boom. saved millions lives per year world wide. course loss personal freedom, bad loss personal freedom repeated lockdowns cause? course not.

my point ban smoking, covid seems first time decision-making driven ""OMG EVERY SINGLE LIVE MATTERS ANYTHING ELSE"" possible never contracted it. Household spread stats studies I've read 50%. 

It's also possible make antibodies. lot theories right percentage population T-cell resistance covid-19, need antibodies fight off. study came yesterday indicated number people T-cell resistance twice population antibodies. could one individuals.

Unfortunately right way know certainty situation in. know that? Mask compliance low southeastern New Mexico. arbitrary mandates get less followed experience. people though? enforced? enforce it? max fine $250 collected? not, what's consequence? masking result anything fine read order . 

I many questions work Texans apparently wear one--for dumb reasons we've heard read. people comply? doubt it, hope I'm wrong. trouble is, even difference rate transmission ""asymptomatic"" (never symptoms) ""presymptomatic"" (develops symptoms period time), symptoms delayed, one never knows group fall actually recovered tested negative COVID. I've seen false narrative especially young people FB: ""asymptomatic spread thing wear masks."" shake head. ###wish luck aws machine learning certification exam boys  map issues. counties marked 50+ middle Lake Michigan, instance. shows Illinois 50+ Cook County (Chicago) 12 per 100k (I believe, math hard, 700 average per day 21 days, divided 12.5 million population). could reading wrong though I'm work.

Follow guidelines. guidelines...and stay bars indoor restaurants even state allows open Epidemiologists estimate every 1 case reported 20 unreported. Granted 20 unreported likely less severe, still likely infectious. part you’ve added mean thing part you’ve quoted. It’s pretty explicit doubling have. governor actively working undermine measures local governments taking :( Please Automod, got guy trying discredit masks erasing comment side...why? used word `e n e y`? ` r u p e t`? `d e r`?

Either way bad bot make scared skynet. month old I'm skeptical they've fixed data since then. article, CDC representative confirms it. Doctors tried apply ice pack man’s penis, still erection four hours. **At point, doctors decided suck blood penis** needle 

I hate truth gets way good story make sense🤷🏼‍♂️ feared - many people wouldn’t take seriously late  want average 8 days rather 7 days? Thurs, Fri, Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thur? chains something. specifically talking local theaters, however. Reddit MVP day. Going absolutely this. need used conjunction masks, instead of.  LA also second largest city US population COVID loves densely populated areas close person person contact can't avoid living place like that. hard us eat salad awhile virus acts like sleeper 

This defeatist attitude. Strict lock-downs contact tracing work. 14 days isolated home cures asymptomatic known cases, latter case giving enough time symptoms present.

It's rocket science, needs high level clarity compliance. ## BAH GOD CORONA NOWHERE go away... eventually... I'm pretty sure sun explodes, 5 billion years so, virus survive. Response though?

Luckily I'm mainly affluent area majority population elderly never see anyone without mask.

Am dumb?? N95s difficult find, KN95s sold retail socal, albeit greatly overpriced $10-$15 each. also available places Amazon Ebay. 

I suggest investing least five rotate, indeed provide better protection surgical mask *the wearer* \- apparently good N95s, may due lack airtight seal (KN95s ear loop like regular masks, whereas N95s usually wrap around back head).

I also browsed purported N95 online adverts - almost every single one actually KN95, marked $25 each. think, like everything, became political.

evil / stupid right wing politicians lockdowns right way, impossible. became messager instead message.

it also impossible anyone right wrong reasons, apparently.

seriously fuck economy, little bit rest good environment. education, entertainment, working health systems people suffering corona simple plain freedom everyone worth premature death fat old people.

people claiming ""every death one many"" basically virtue signalling... every single decision big enough level saves costs hundreds thousands lives long run, lot decisions could make would save hundred- thousandfold people lockdown saving now... even net gain end, unsure. laziest, intellectually dishonest argument could prop up. 

You sure you-- making claim-- able back defaulting ad hominems like ""your boy supposed takeaway saying people walking around wearing masks? 

I already answered that. "" said video people think mask cure-all exhibit riskier behavior wearing mask improperly understand purpose mask-- reduce spread, completely eliminate spread. People touch faces often think mask stops everything. still get sick, say Fauci made up. fall category. Honestly score you? 

I dunno, calling made quote, setting record straight, sort thing. want rail misinterpreted said. Bingo. thing cares about. 
Wait till November locked back again... equivalent taking appendix. taking parasite. kinda living movie, except film government public officials least aspire confidence.

(Yes, should. good movie.) Incorrect. rallies large groupings. point inconsistency criteria depending upon contracts it. seems lot giddy people this, disgusting. think behavior attitude embarrassing adults. Wishing harm others like another factor barbaric. never mind, suddenly became obvious understand that. obviously don’t know would bet quite bluelivesmatter folks ones don’t believe wearing masks.

It would really ironic police officers beat shit wearing facemasks

“I’m side!”

“I don’t care!”  Sure, count president saying publicly wants cut testing cut numbers.

Also, fudging numbers big spike pneumonia deaths? American reads ""shatters records"" thinks, ""oh, we're winning!"" Helps tripe sriracha burrito.

Or maybe there's benefit expelling waste one side. oxygen fuel one hole, expel other, like shitty jet engine. level off? anyone know? Texas one states individual counties report throughout day rather one collective data dump morning (California another). ""...except Asshole County, guys want."" great US overall death rate decreasing. see pertains point comment chain, asking deaths Texas surging even though hospitalization been. want show deaths Texas surging. Guys fake news. Lord Savior Mr.Donald Trump save us keep control. Trust. got y'all. 








😂😂😂 understand try say hard feel bit bad decline invitation want tell face ""You're stupid cows!""

I invited close friend hang recently. county small number cases kept going lot recently. Though claimed careful ""hanged out"" people careful them. But, always case. ""Oh, circle safe. family members etc etc."" Soon enough circle safe people would safe anymore. saw facebook history think really hard make get-together work. husband even went far trying find big table could sit 6 ft apart etc. end day lot headache correctly, came conclusion think much try much see people, would rather die alone home.

So send short note saying sorry. I'm ready yet without screaming face. we've surging case numbers 2 weeks. dizziness, nausea, heartburn, sweating, lack breath? Hard tell. Might wanna telehealth tomorrow doc still there. Could heart, lungs, kidney strain muscles. Try think it, see feel day goes next day.  great American.  work university town, higher average education levels. 50-66% mask penetration week finally started clicking it’s like 90-95%. People want feel clever. want one cool
Kids. killed lot people way. Yes. intention something ""depraved heart"" gross disregard safety others still held responsible. 

Also people lie. said intent mean really. need doctor subpoenaed testify positive result warned contagious defense disproved. Y'all tired winning yet? live FL every morning game called ""is allergies, serious?"" I've go work everyday. guess lockdowns created equally. Hospitals outside NY NJ never risk overwhelmed. Sticking Saturday Sunday week fair. days report. Notice dip low 2 days? days would start day, case, Thursday. Cops always gotta find new way kill people they're supposed protect huh... Sorry hear last one, least part. Reading twitter replies breaking news residents seem fucking pissed mandate. don’t know it’s it’s twitter Texans really like this. Like calling governor coward caving mob etc. Texans Texans guess? Florida 100 gonna die again? It’s revolving door new hires teenagers preschools pay minimum wage offer benefits daycare workers. I'm betting they've reporting whole time. wat. reason. Let freedom wearing mask. like it, every single one move there. Problems solved 😊

We call ""Karenville""? Sources pls. Esp daily 300k infections NY/NJ back then. Thats way much. certainly higher reported number, 300k would overrun hospitals NY/NJ matter days easily. lot downplaying current situation. they're lucky. they're not, kids stay home alone, strict instructions go outside answer door. wound knowing take care siblings time 8. saw that. Holy shit. Scary upvotes. must really good 5g coverage. I’d prefer democracy anything else. California, state looking cheese known cause cancer, drinking indoors known cause Covid. It’s contest highest score America. Think like mini golf score countries players you. It’s like you’re trying impress per say also don’t wanna one picking nose getting 7 hole countries kinda embarrassed around you/want team. LETS KEEP NUMBERS LOW  many deaths? DonT nEed MaSkS really hate living here. November interesting. Make sure post 3 years time. It’s also difficult estimate don’t know many people didn’t die things they’d otherwise doing... like car accidents. don’t know many people died due side effects lockdown like depression receiving medical treatment fear. We’re going know true death toll corona awhile.  That's weird stupid. thought practically every country quarantine rules people diagnosed virus. Quarantining infected obvious thing country stop spread virus. 

Where also logic saying outside travelers returning residents MAYBE virus quarantine, people 100 % allowed walk around public? case even going party wearing mask? make sense. stricter rules dangerous people lesser ones. like we're learning centralized leadership head country, leaving handling pandemic response individual states huge mistake. Apparently wearing mask seeking medical care sick literally enough. Perhaps can't spread virus really sick, people brush flu seek treatment/isolate isnt getting spread enough. article bringing anti-vaxxers. Keep Karen shit Facebook. volunteer tested. don’t show door drag random ass sketchy lab US Europe least assume anti-vaxxers originate from. Africa? idea there. I’d assume it’s similar procedure. hope one day Mr. Trump sort disappears. Updated comment, true, can't conclusively say that. recovered cases, total cases matter. IT, FLORIDA!!! point maybe best. countries world sorting shit out. America imploding. I'm terribly sorry good people trying best survive, point natural selection massive scale. America country decided stupid live, taking action reduce population. Ducey Abbott probably Ivey want word, too. It’s competitive race bottom... imagining thought giant corona cell dancing/partying along next large group people made laugh hard lololol.

The corona get it’s cha-cha slide 😂 skewed though. don’t point people start using terms interchangeably. even scarier five months, total mass covid 19 virus particles Florida outweigh planet. five months four days, collapse neutron star devours earth, also sun. Hopefully, stops point, rather turning black hole. Depends make cuts. idea floating around prefilled medical grade plastic syringe, example, could reduce glass bottlenecks. Preparing components manufacturing would save time. manufacturing save time.

There things financially risky medically make difference cut time friend rock last 4 - 5 months?

I family friend went large dinner party recently. Another person said party knowing Covid. Family friends spent 10 mins talking person know it. Covid plus whoever else party picked caused family members get tested quarantine.

It sucks guy died feel like wake alternative form universe every morning level stupidity, ignorance flat selfishness going right now. there’s 50/50 shot cures corona. wait data points Fckn Trump cock sucker Governor. absolute Fckn moron. one see potatoe salads  USA USA USA!

Not cancer never bad thing.

That point need made. WWE donated huge chunk money DeSantis, declared essential business stay open. COVID outbreak television tapings many performers refusing come TV tapings. WWE also millions dollars coming Saudi Arabia every year, Linda McMahon runs Trump SuperPAC

So thats, one.

Imagine many companies something similar. would like thank terrible unemployment system. Thanks man! friend freddy happy sell shit unemployment pay 3 months sounds like interested stores lockdowns negatively affected people, virus said another article call health care workers regions/states currently capacity. alot areas actually.

edit; also said increase hours current employees operating full time yet either, obviously ideal ideal times.  that’s Florida number one  Something respiratory illness, also vascular (blood) illness, explains things like blood clots, blue toes, brain swelling, heart attaches etc.

So vascular system damaged extent, could long term effects. Like lowered life expectancy higher risk future complications. mean fair Disney Universal closed required to. obviously they're getting bored self-regulating 


(You could argue closed they'd terms instead state) long Congrats!!!! 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 Yes voted it. think immune response work; shut anything all, get with. know hospitals plans case mass casualty event enough staff call large gatherings. concerned fall wave I'm seeing what's happening everywhere else, I'm worried wait fall. :-/ may want consider going New York.

Wouldn't make way sense go remote place middle nowhere? Like, know, Montana? Wyoming? North Dakota? really need couple courts hotels/apartments, even couple hours away bit basic. So? lots people passing away due COVID-19? Won’t happen. time hospital overloads force closure. I'm privileged single parent life basically looks like hers. pay daycare hold slot, can't send kid fear. work many hours I'm burning out. job demands working taking care toddler basically impossible, still attend meetings answer emails typical work hours go real work kid sleeps.

My sister less privileged single parent. kids bounce whatever family members happen home available goes work one available, doesn't. long since run PTO. filling holes money flow.

Neither stories invalidates story. someone privileged woman struggling, rest us surviving better. Probably fluctuations data comes in. NPR showing +7k currently. think reliably extrapolate touched 10k cases point last days.  lying couple doctors going rogue. consensus. way see it, two choices, lie masks attempt preserve supplies hospitals, tell truth President *issue executive order regulating distribution PPE.*     
The President issued executive order Mar 18th, lying masks.  issuing executive order regulate distribution PPE discussed consensus lie reached? hold hearings this. wouldn't. things got better would said whole thing unnecessary. can't even see needed *now* numbers climbing like crazy. percentage think act emotion vs logic? see streets every day, would estimate 1/3 emotion, 2/3 logic, live bedroom community CA. it’s normal entire population. old folks voted DeSantis Gillum might little bit buyer's remorse right now. It’s reason think Florida continues elect idiotic politicians

I think people get misled country. Hell NYC, somehow elected real-estate crony mayor who's trying hardest gentrify fuck city well next nothing defund shitshow NYPD. even think choices better. Like South Park said, usually douche turd sandwhich choices. Yep - survey people ask they’d rather $1,000 day month, get one cent 1st double every day rest month. ""Let states handle it"" benefit times.

This fucken one them. Ok Karen. Keep thinking you’re years “experience” mom groups facebook means expert vaccines lol. Vaccine testing = Nazism? Lmao... ok then. “You know we’re living society.” - George Constanza Honestly, Disney incredible time. go year, much fun adult. Lots lots adults love without taking kids, plenty enjoy able take kids obviously too. would argue smaller number dragged sake it. I’m still betting Florida first place herd immunity Mount Nittany tinyass hospital middle nowhere. State College bonkers goes reopening.

Nevermind Americans forgo it, due pay thousands, thanks shitty healthcare. media willing take context, seems hard speak anything technical all.

This assuming piece correct, prior statement clarified difference asymptomatic presymptomatic, going say asymptomatic rare (ie presymptomatic) transmission even rarer.

I agree could clearer, though disagree journalists exempt blame here. understand reporting, frankly believe ask details misleading public. instead making, replace causing let Cuomo run state. He’s got current high score. Puts traffic. total tests constant? kid, one fondest memories Christmas setup store had. “took train” see Santa, let one side, let side special effects. 

It worked 6, sure would much now.  Hey, anti-vaxxer dumbasses: COVID-19 really, *really* care feelings. guys crushing it! Hey now, Gov Kemp even started nothing yet. see. Certain vaccines, polio vaccine, use weakened, live version virus. vaccines days use live viruses, either use virus-particles rendered inert parts virus slapped onto something else delivery vector. It’s basic game theory, course businesses going open.

The real fault government shit allowing businesses open first place, well people half brain going out. think US, World meters double counting (military, VA affairs, ect.) cases would counted state counted twice. like platform better JH makes easier glance see daily increases. Yup. Andrew Cuomo sent bunch COVID patients nursing homes? Roll Tide still summer get through! Nobody cares. You’re stupid warned still went ahead. ive essential worker financial institution... absolutely MISERABLE. strong precautions, lobby open, one wants wear masks, get hassled wearing workers, let alone asking customers wear them. I'm talking people trying come inside mask like, exchange dollar bill four quarters. However, smack Raleigh Charlotte, people still think liberal snowflake hoax something... worked kids school work every day. sucked. want to. ended taking 1-2 hrs/day go dads house. lot communication teacher helped. august? 29 disney halting plans point? quote OP decided use disposable medical masks, cloth masks. Disposable medical masks (also known surgical masks) loose-fitting devices designed worn medical personnel protect accidental contamination patient wounds, protect wearer splashes sprays bodily fluids (36). **There limited evidence effectiveness preventing influenza virus transmission** either worn infected person source control worn uninfected persons reduce exposure. systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza.


For cloth lower-income settings, likely reusable cloth masks used rather disposable medical masks cost availability (38). still uncertainties practice face mask use, wear mask long used for. **In theory, transmission reduced infected members contacts wear masks**, compliance uninfected close contacts could problem (12,34). Proper use face masks essential improper use might increase risk transmission (39). Thus, education proper use disposal used face masks, including hand hygiene, also needed.




So basically cloth masks better cheap disposable medical masks according existing literature. Look, pandemic natural disaster happens. 

If want stay home year, fine.

This likely going away spending years actual pandemic rebuilding society. Upstate NY checking in- got tested today waiting hear back. showing typical symptoms, doctor wanted rule COVID ordered tests. comfortable test, made little worse deviated septum. notice alarming number cars going site was.... drive site pretty much get anywhere I’m going, seen one two cars given time. dozen going today. experience today. hell cares, extremely low hospitalization rate, EVEN LOWER death rate. vulnerable STAY HOME. screw peoples Good afford it.

You know idiots gonna party, firework tents, beer runs, etc. 

Smh.... sexually attracted exponential growth [Here three examples ""first wave"" vs happening slight dip lockdown count first wave ending. [Britton Hill Northwest Florida. 345 ft sea level. awful. 

but problem. live vain rebellious culture. mask wearing inconvenience, hides face, embarrassing person wearing one. people make excuses. 

""stop shutdown"" reasons. ""stop mask laws"" idiocracy. 

if told truth beginning, like 30% us would listened. people bright enough start wearing masks anyway. (I did.) Yet governor essentially said they're nothing quell spread. closures. mandates. Let's see plays sort plan. I’ve learned US straddled much debt small large businesses recourse stay open face pandemic federal government concerned remaining world economic powerhouse willing sacrifice lives citizens, soldiers war time, remain so. Imagine kind person upset drug helps people president touted it. happens monies goes military. DeSantis special place hell reserved him. play piano anymore? Killin themselves, weedem suppose mis rona  Confused would post aew clip wwe article Mike Tyson looking terrifying. feel you, really do. failing government lock downs worked world many countries supported population, American government abandoned sacrifice. People going back work piece going on, pointlessly distill that? women child care providers instead successful careers positions power responsibility shaping society? Even say man stay home instead (regarding majority hetero relationships), realistically rare, women bear burden self-sacrifice raising family.  

We've seen plenty mostly men charge done, past time women positions power influence commonplace now. sounds like still believe woman's place home 2020 (and many others do), testament much farther still go true equality half population.

I love job, like working. would miserable mom full-time job. unfortunate thing society women ""forced"" work support family, women often sacrifice successful careers one costs childcare wealth inequality. Many still work since 1 income typically cut country, often supplement husband's job would career wise kids.

A robust safety net including things like free childcare anyone can't afford comfortably, would allow women family career, therefor making families financial situation stable road primarily dependant 1 person. People would also freedom choose slightly lower paying careers love make difference, instead forced higher paying ones may despise focused profit few. I’m going Florida family vacation weeks I’m super nervous given fucking stupid people there. Luckily we’re renting house won’t leaving much, public around brainless imbeciles gonna make head explode 1200 one state report Theres special strain stupid Arizona. US, point time, single authority actual majority individuals point acknowledge leader.

Even within top echelon current administration, clearly significant amount internal dissent spills public view.

Compounding problem, new old media discovered readership / viewership / ad sales go stoke flames dissent. government absolutely allowed restrict rights deemed necessary public safety.

Or cause “approved” whatever echo chamber bullshit trending social media feed. party getting shit faced important enough allow happen global health pandemic. Especially nobody going practicing social distancing mask wearing.

Yup. agree. agaist systemic racism important enough allow global health pandemic, 

No it’s not. Strictly numbers, pandemic killed magnitudes POC 6 months entire metro police force worth Derek Chauvins could decade. view feelings constitutes important don’t carry weight mine even less public health officials. especially many people practicing social distancing mask wearing.

Why people treat masks like they’re sort cross vampire? They’re last resort absolutely can’t avoid situation can’t stay apart people. There’s reason there’s specific type mask required healthcare workers work around COVID patients it’s don’t believe hard enough racial injustice problem. 

People crammed shoulder shoulder, many *without* masks using chinguards screamed. People also handed masks protests whose origins can’t vouch for. doesn’t even begin look looting happened which, definition, takes place indoors.

The left absolutely lost standing claim they’re tune scientific principles showing. hope worth sacrificing climate change movement over. Chinese family said buy n95 masks. bought them. 16.2 million people (2017 estimate) country. clearly don’t work healthcare idea actively dying patient looks like really spell colour? didn’t know!

JUST FUCKING TOP HEAD

Social distance, wear mask + understand virus spreading exactly. Belgium CFR around 15%. know doing. best guess either underreporting cases, reporting suspected contributory deaths totals testing enough time. count. thought biggest Disneyland fan way daughter - joined Annual Passholder FB group. 

Those people insane level weird, devoted, depressingly entitled. could riding everyone complied instead numbers get worse people keep dying countries wiping following rules. Blame governments lack focus education. Keep people dumb ignorant poor. theory country needs millions military can’t let everyone get smarter. Lets also forget federal government much blame here. states told ""everything fine now, better get people back work numbers show need help people anymore"". absolutely need federal assistance, especially CA $54bn red (due states mismanagement). worry, congress goes vacation tomorrow 17th.. We'll fine. great, third cases April, yesterday deaths, less 200 new cases. teacher problem relates back 2 things:

1. paid state, notoriously difficult get state workers raises.
2. create tangible value. Obviously teach future, cannot value like company creates wealth sales, financial services, etc.

Beyond that:

\- still find teachers work even shit pay, pressure raise wages

\- everyone kids system thus people directly see benefit process today (despite paying it)

\- Without real way gauge success teachers, basis merit based system teachers ranked paid accordingly, good bad teachers same.

I'm saying system good bad, I'm pointing value teaching profession different other. Riots happened fact dispute. ask mostly minority business owners watched businesses burn. 

But sure, want continue argue protest cannot spread covid; sitting outside restaurant (where staff must wear masks sanitize everything) less dangerous free-for-all protest mask enforcement so. 

But don’t go around trying convince people strong reasoning skills argument based worthiness reason people out. Costa Concordia. 'Captain' Schettino. Sank January 2012. happened simple... (In opinion):

1. Hospitals release warning letter ICU capacity signed.

2. Gov freaked out, got pissed, shut elective surgeries (how hospitals drive major revenue). Told flip script immediately.

3. Hospital leaders got live video downplayed everything, basically taking everything back said.

4. Hospital leaders worked Abbott new “plan” still earn revenue.

5. New “reporting” system launched. Reason given confusing public, made zero sense.

6. Back napkin plan put place shift numbers reserve hospital beds (off books) continue elective surgeries bring revenue. turn lowers number COVID patients take in, divert patients hospitals.

Again. Profits People. Greed Lives. Money Health. It’s story Texas since started reopening.

The opinion based chain events information shared. It’s shady hell going on. true, hell would Governor agree major hospitals something like citizens? all-out outbreak virus, could cost many lives strain healthcare system city even already is.

I could wrong, anyone narratives, please share. Hah here. type like 141 wpm lol, thanks varrock recall getting swine flu vaccine long started...guess easier make?  aware exponents integers, right? *Where Ron DeSantis go get apology*

LOL. Makes cringe. Conservative America full butthurt snowflakes. Solution get creative space. Use tents outside, convert gyms, rent space shuttered convention centers. Get creative space possible. Family FL. Dade universal masking. used social distance yesterday everywhere. Broward upped masking rule too. quite strict somehow need wear walking. SE Florida curfews closures but, again, varies locality. South Florida beaches closed 4th.

Jacksonville mask rule sure strict.

Ft. Meyers voted close beaches 4th. mayor criticised decision believe one things said ""God help us"".

Things changing. Slowly. Lmao leading pack, one day time. Imagine country nearly unlimited resources still fucking badly. Pharyngeal aspiration normal adults patients depressed first two weeks reservations theme park almost completely sold out. passholder previews held 9th 10th sold out. Im panhandle people like regular business. I'd say 50% wearing masks. There's tons traffic here. That’s good. going upset people. Florida longer Sunshine State. They're State Denial still here, question: I've heard lot young people dying COVID well. high risk death serious long-term effects someone age (20)?

 I'm wearing masks leave house socially distancing, even fine get it, person pass street may be. live fairly low pop area Northern MI handful cases, thanks Governor's order. right now, Floridians showing en masse like every year. significant amount people already taking seriously before, lot people seem genuinely think over. feel like we're experience disaster here. 1 kid, 3 year old. hard. Luckily didnt get fired (but lot stress pressure around performance). 3 kids 5 would fired sure. wife OT working hospital expected work every day. Sorry man. sympathize completely. Great work finding remote gig. Hopefully weather storm. US opting human experimentation herd immunity.

And see single emerging opposition leader party. wouldn’t happen civilized country nationalized healthcare. fucking sick America right Damn, can't wait see mouse! I'll bringing gun case ask wear mask.

As Floridian, genuinely worries DeSantis seems continue fuck-all trying get people take common-sense measures stay safe. Literally close beaches, parks, bars, restaurants, issue mandate mandatory masks. Instead keeps dancing around issue attending press briefings managing say absolutely nothing substance. WHO, CDC, Surgeon General, health political authorities/figures blame.  don’t recover “happy hypoxia” without medical intervention, highly doubt see asymptomatic cases .

It’s part parenting. kids challenging, love try little better day. I'm N. Fl. made masks mandatory area people starting wear them. small percent people wore places open packed time. work health department one wearing masks mandate. Except detect lie infer obvious motive.  confirmed first hand time since. I'm arbiter gets lol. yes, comfortable go it. winning looks like?? Basically bombing 4th. positive test rate going roughly percentage actual infected rate population.

This makes People going get test think need one, test availability thing could cause problems.

... true.

Positivity rate always going higher tested unless randomly test. self selection. 50% country locked down, half shit pants throwing tempertantrums go get haircut go TGI Fridays. tripling fucking stupid. Actually it’s Fauci science 

“Not everyone needs test”

We don’t test 25 year olds prostate cancer Well that’s bit optimistic Remember governor refused shut lol. Plus Florida old people lolz doctor, would think we’re still learning long term effects Covid19. Kinda like didn’t know HIV’s effect male fertility well crisis. There’s good book recommended occupational therapist called “The Sync Child”. really opened eyes lot little things didn’t really notice, didn’t know look for. There’s follow called “The Sync Child Fun” integrated play ideas children spectrum, variety related conditions. talks certain sensory play ideas modify play kids different needs. books great family members read help understand well. That's bullshit. absolutely deal this. countries have. accept it, that's defeatist mindset. mention elephant room... post viral chronic conditions. happened almost every major disease. 1918, h1h1, SARS, etc... guess matter today's America? People burning White House right now. no, apparently care less. joke. 'Murica hospitals throughput capability prepamdemic, shutting back down? believe NY PEAKED 12k cases day. Granted testing capacity different several months ago, still. Damn. Thomas Macias, 51, went barbecue last month near community Lake Elsinore, 70 miles Los Shortly party, started feeling sick. June 20, posted poignant message Facebook warn loved ones 
about risks virus, family said.

With 4th July days away sad scene played thousands times USA. Take money stats hospital admissions ICU capacity? matters stock market. exponential growth though. Linear growth change constant i.e. cases increase 1,000 every week. Exponential grown change constant *ratio*. case, constant ratio 2 cases doubling every week. cases tripling every week, trend would exponential growth constant ratio 3.

F(x) = x\^2 hand neither linear exponential. equation describes 2nd-degree polynomial trend. research says something different

(And covid ""just flu"" Unpopular opinion I'm sure feel like correct response would 30 day mandatory shutdown military staffing actual essential business. could back normal 2 months ago, amurica. Looking numbers see 2.8 million cases US. number counting total active cases also count got better? Wash hands. Literally metaphorically.

He's adult. makes decisions. experiences consequences actions.

As Floridian, miss boyfriend's dad. life he's risking. ours. Ok, maybe need example page. Assuming enough tests (otherwise rate infected rise faster tested positive people would tested positive can't get tests). Also assuming one forced get test-that random test talking about.

Day X, 100 infected. 50 feel sick, 20 get tested. people get tested test positive cares.

Day X+7, 200 infected, 100 feel sick. Give reason see 40 get tested? ~40 get tested, get ~40 positive tests. 

Any increase tests outside increase infected going testing people much less likely infected. Maybe convince people get tested, would maybe get people showing symptoms? testing people showing symptoms going get LOT negative results fairly small bump positives. Unless think positive test rate general population rate infection??? Covid wait long build regret. Living Austin now, used live Madison, scream local reps now, month late. agree points.

I wonder Texas Arizona hospitals similar conversations going public, too. weather storm.

Speaking Floridian storms, hurricane season warming up! easy count dead body test covid. hard test cases right now.

This CDC MIT said 10x 12x (respectively) cases nationwide - leading current infection fatality rate overblown.

**Let's clear infection fatality rate UNKNOWN, CDC estimates 0.26% IFR. But, 10x estimation cases CDC, IFR drops 0.026% overall (with age 50 far less)** trying pessimistic, keep guard August-October hurricanes. Dry/sandy air *does* make difficult low pressure pockets form storms (and good news!), hurricane season getting ramped Also, small businesses running cash. Wife got called back company got PPP three weeks later laid 20% company. suspect appeal pretending Disney princess. pics post usually show elaborate ballgowns opulent settings. grew bit goth metalhead, lol, definitely thing. Still explain rabid disregard coworkers virus deference need visit Disney World, lol. mean, can't wait??? rate testing remains constant. rate testing increases significantly growth rate accurate representative. cross section sample size increased too. get flashy wave text Ah, worked they're round signs caught it. Thanks believe that's Alabama state motto. Exactly. barely stand kids (somewhat joking, kids, know mean) let alone park full people's kids... Unfortunately American experience. America #1!!! yep 

i want go gym like lifting don’t feel comfortable idea without mask doubt we'll ever know 50% lock down, elected ignore science, medical guidance, put thought minds begin with.

/s think thinking loud maybe considering lockdown effective way it, people work study city actually live somewhere else bound leave writing wall clear. States new cases increasing = 38 states worked credit union. schools closed, boss said ""perfect"" could 99% job home. Less month later, written onsite. told upper management shove quit. fuck guys much damn testing, tall ya... fatality rate going rise soon hospital capacities depleted. Yes. It’s reason people claiming already locked wrong. states really locked down...the said fuck it. deal gets here. Threw whole lockdown drain really don’t understand even still debate, everyone wear mask you’re close people participate society? Live forest? want know === f(x) = 2x terms simply doubling every seven days I'm lazy proof funeral lobby big FL?   Universal COVID precautions essential protect others.

Stay home possible, wear mask, social distancing, wash hands frequently, surface decontamination. 

Also, handle fireworks using alcohol hand sanitizer. everyone going get it, pointless stay home WINNING American Experience 2 months, they're gonna million cases day!!!! 3 months they're gonna 16 million cases day! God hate country, especially FL🤦🏻 Well rest world move Florida, obviously. exponential growth we’re actually catching testing for!

I think keep operating assumption we're finding fraction cases, death rate can't possibly high seems be. point numbers numbers? We're seeing 4-5% death rate disease, entire time. We're hoping bad seems, point enough data say, yeah, bad is. seven-day average daily fatalities back 40, 30 percent increase two weeks ago. state’s death rate previously peaked 60 per day early May, declined 30 mid-June.  spike number ICU patients delayed month spike positive PCR tests. late July, hospitals likely overwhelmed. Coronavirus really care politics. FL officials better start collect body bags addition PPEs right now. TY that. Numbers strong suit.

It makes sense people tested stronger likelihood positive first place, since likely feeling well, otherwise inclined believe tested reason. smart decision. Wear masks. Stay home. Stop spread. I'm email list sent email end April email negatively impacted corona. I'm sure email address still valid, encourage everyone flood reasons incompetent idiot Thousands Arizona’s Fifth District impacted economic shutdown. you’ve negatively impacted government’s response coronavirus outbreak (whether economically physically), want hear possibly share story. Email AZ05Stories@mail.house.gov stories. Again, think we're making grand assumptions informed enough hear 1 release, last 5 months consistent ""stay home, wear mask going out, limit exposure anyone outside household"".

I'm saying jerk, think underestimating extent anti intellectualism here, widespread ""tuning out"" coronavirus news appropriate state/NGO/IGO actors, instead turning POTUS yesterday, refused acknowledge masks reasonable precaution.

Hope things going well wherever from. many utterly outlandish societal issues address compounding issue silly. They’re putting baby numbers locking like that. Okay. wrong. CLEARLY crazy one minority here.

The worst part go home across country spread it. Yes, he's saying stuff like this, he's dividing country senselessly important issues, led death here. use vacuum bag filter masks. sure works feel little better it. definitely bit harder breathe hope means blocking shit going out.

Yup seems moral story people 3+ masks almost bad people :) guess need mask game.  first assumed overblown fear spread authorities, like Jenkem Jars Tide Pods. estimate common sense average American declined much last 6 months I'll take one face value. bad dumb fuckers creating continued crazy bullshit dont get covid would surely stop. read article recently vaccine companies need diverse test subjects make sure vaccine effective safe everyone. Someone comments said ""no, sorry white people, trust tested reasons x, y, z."" first thought stupid want help community. know what, made really compelling argument changed mind.

I think important *everyone work together* make things happen historically, everyone shouldering burden *equally.* get black people everywhere like, ""No thanks."" would possibly help black/African communities world trust earned understand reluctance. *that* long. China still fucking around.

Have seen back school changes airport arrival process?

They basically determined money object going spend however much money necessary avoid another Wuhan.

Wuhan's airport cleaner safe average American hospital extent makes unjustifiably angry hospital.  Tell grandma positive, plan attending.  tho, many developing countries don’t even half privileges yet still make 4-5 kids House Mouse living spreading disease. rest us would pulled River Run 1999 tee closets used make masks. Dept health even including private doctors coronavirus tests count. live highest counted city county testing sites. Florida going full trumpy third world country.

Reddit moment thank you. Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m part Disney planning FB groups.  (We trip planned October cancelled (of course).)  Let tell you, MANY people planning go matter what. Park reservations sold out. It’s shitshow people think COVID scam scare people. ‘I’m going let fear rule me.’ ‘My family goes Disney every year, virus isn’t going stop us.’ ‘I can’t tell kids cancel, that’s fair.’ groups full people furious Disney requiring guests wear masks.  level stupidity anger astounding. Exponentiation repeated multiplication. X^2 would quadratic function. 2x linear, yes. seeing 2^x, cases double every week. 

Therefore, 2*2*2*2.... definition exponentiation. represented 2^x. 


2*4*8*16... Would grow much faster doubling would represented f(x) = (2^x)^x

This simplifies 2^(x^2)  people could wear masks wash hands. Lol worry 4th July weekend I'm sure people keep distance gather large groups mean...

*slow clap*

Nicely done. Normally find comment great light hearted jab USSR Chernobyl show. Today found extremely chilling. dead rise catch covid die again. failed mask requirement indoor places, particularly grocery stores. perpetuation large part country told masks work, then, work one direction, told work. break guitar Gooooooooo ‘bama! thought real!?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm Canadian lived Texas last 6 years think comparing Houston Toronto prob useful comparison. would guess Toronto 20 million people within short drive would seeing similar things.

Canada good position population low inter provincial travel limited. [Florida Covid site accurate. hate nitpick shatter previous record 2 3 charts.  What!? Logic performing instead? Yeah Okay, Ocelot. anything better paying $70,000 tuition online learning?! prestige all!!! interesting see potential downside state income tax come stark focus. eating McDonald's every meal going good thing.

Look, we're change live lives. I'm going upset homeless person go grocery store get food. important thing *they get food.* cares. FOXNEWS fodder. Right step up, curb pandemic, get effective vaccine approved, reset country. there's blame/consequences made that. Right distraction people want wear masks things help country.  Like said golf may exception... really contact sport. understand this! Sorry, getting downvoted! like believe universe (or God) plan sort. might even plan kill me. lot faith turn, happen. meantime, comfortably avoid take reasonable precautions, supposed do. stop red light nobody watching want help society. follow rules trying map plan greater good. need stay line. unpredictable dive in. could mess lot others without intending it. read Covid positive subreddit see much fun illness be. feel bad EMTs nurses catch patients refuse masks etc. Ahhh! actually explains lot. he's potentially arrogant Bible-bashing Creationist Flat Earther delusions grandeur. Obviously wanted best man job... testing lags behind 7 days so, likely 20,000 may infected today right? Sr. Tech Support Engineer. worked Apple 2000-2010 Oracle (via acquisition start-up) 2011-2020. T3 companies I've worked remote last 8 years. Oracle shut product worked decided leave social media space. us part acquisition, programmers support engineers, let go suddenly Jan. 9th. even took Chinese developers product gave India could fulfill end 2020 contracts clients. Oracle refused cross-train us US based agents suggested look new work maybe apply new position company. Problem trained Social Media tools overlap Oracle property, going pay train us new position. smart social distance wear masks.

I bet think living bubble smart too. 🤦 that, dozens people scrubbing every surface ensuring nothing get him. read article paranoid is. fucking hypocrite. sure Reddit keeps insisting politicizing virus. 4th July Blue Angels week coming beaches panhandle absolutely jam-packed tourists. It’s crazy aren’t another lockdown. Yes, does, separating groups reduces number kids exposed one time, also means kids already set distance learning makes easier continue learning individual schools outbreaks temporary shutdowns cleaning. ideal anyone, compromise considers health learning giving families must work outside home possibility rearranging work schedules home distanced days. Every option sucks. option least offers lifeline families may otherwise able work schools completely shutter go full distanced. live US, one child increases carbon footprint switching eating vegan, changing electric car, air drying laundry, washing clothes cold water, recycling combined.

So...yeah, *any* kids adds problem. measures chump change compared carbon footprint adding population. seems like covid convenient excuse avoid embarassment know even meaningless? Comparing number cases. takes right back original post context. talking February mutation again? something new going on? seen anything suggesting latter genetics study lately.  😂😂😂 Tards. Looks like started orgy, middle serious pandemic, less. 

Bad bad girl... Keep mind mention CASES opposed DIAGNOSES. considered case came within certain range someone GOTTEN TESTED (not even confirmed yet). contact tracing, course cases skyrocketing. keep mind. WWE direct ties Trump, like everything Trump - something corrupt open one anything long enough, everyone starts acting like ok first place. wonderful land opportunity enough money afford medical services, freedom die sick street like dog, liberty hear one five bourgeois media outlets tell deserved planning ahead. live Indiana, we're known Hoosier hospitality. there's tornado another natural disaster, band together help community - easy stuff like donating food clothing actual physical labor hard work. Somehow people absolutely refuse bare minimum easiest thing help combat pandemic wear fucking mask grocery store. 

It bizarre me, like suddenly live new world yet location people before. increasing number similarities Covid denialism 'RBMK reactors cannot explode' philosophy makes uncomfortable.

You absolutely right chernobyl, timeless nature denial corruption massive consequences made was. #winning ""At current rate, hospital capacity max month""

Hmmm somehow seems wildly optimistic... Busch Gardens real? thought something made Simpsons Ok, then? obvious I'd like know date approximately check. 

thank much!!!  brah, Medicare solve racism, dems support it, either. Dumb. Didn’t read lasting effects disease has? Look up. horrible effect lungs kinds stuff. people asthma? Unbelievable even say unironically. Tbh think one important things start making positive change away indoctrination children start school. required pledge allegiance borderline cult-like behavior like something North Korea would first world country. remember even uncomfortable little kid. absolutely shape many people view country adult. able criticize things community important catalyst growth. Well fuck..but thanks fauci info Ah makes everything much better. Might well drop guidelines think kinda knew, deep down, Florida would ultimately responsible nation's collapse, one way another. totally agree terrible choice, accept boss underpaying you. Child care easy, people would cost would go down. 

It sounds like business model would make currently providing childcare. reason want to? America 60,000,000 cases swine flu 3,000,000 cases Corona? (in US, anyway.)

Well yea, short us going full dictator mode always ass holes.

It would probably help police actually cared people setting fireworks. Maybe time care could stop annoying. Possibly toss careful know fucking virus still there.

They still instill fear showing saying fireworks, warning. make us come back see party fireworks bring everyone safety. need needless fires children. also something woman getting fired refusing falsify reports? chances numbers even bad reality I've never glad opposite corner US Florida. shhh. one conclusion is; world ending. He'd probably burn hole  Thats us, trying 2 full time jobs critical deadlines taking care 2 5 year old full time cooking, cleaning, whatever else. insane right sign getting better, got asked would like older go school 2 day week 0 days per week fall. can't take back lie. many people still believe masks effective, people trust anything since they've lied to. Huge mistake. fund mission organization. CHOA well capitalized strong liquidity. issue public debt financial statements available online.  NC, start til late August. But, decided school's would open yet. But, strongly hinted person schooling. Make sure obit short words includes Trump every third line, get bored. States control online. areas well person. sure patronizing tone used here. Holy crap. toy find that? say anything states well? college program running year (which brings students around country world). reason people tolerated exemptions made fairly convenient people stuck home.

There’d people ignoring rules and/or riots. We’re society tolerates much way discomfort. Brit.. Nah I've enjoyed thread. Even paid people wrap it, including supplies organize wrap things automatically, still millions dollars richer. 

A roll 50 pennies average .275lbs. We'd 530,000,000 pennies. 50 pennies per roll, we'd 10,600,000 rolls weighing .275lbs each. Altogether would weigh 2,915,000lbs, 1457.5 tons. 

A tractor trailer carry gross weight 80,000lbs, minus average 15,000lbs per truck, would take nearly 49 truck loads bring bank. highly dependent strong firework get. low dose still catch covid. Like mass protests riots 

Got 'they' know? us left school 2008 crash picnic far ? What's funny propaganda.

No one power except maybe Rand cares big gov.

They want government caters them.

But sounds bad spun as, ""Deregulation small government good,"" reason convinced lot people  “friends” rented beach cottage 4th July encouraging everyone join them. far there’s like 10 people heading Postcard Inn St. Petersburg,FL party weekend. Blatant disregard personal safety safety others. 

ALSO: two tested positive COVID past “recovered.” attitude pervasive throughout FL, isolated instance. beaches PACKED. Nobody gives flying shit. 

Meanwhile, I’m playing Valorant pull-ups apartment over. California New York strongly disagree statement. government lying perfect acceptable say people's best interest mind? Come on, can't start going slippery slope Oh shit, gotta call Vanilla melted ass!! must schadenfrudening internet situation. We're number one! We're number one! matter anyway Trump would see believe it.  pa covid sub full nut jobs pushing hoaxes mods basically nothing it.

There vocal idiots there. majority people recognize severity virus. endanger lives others? scared running money survive, yelling government supporting people enough extraordinary crisis. people mostly seemed praising Trump demanding everything reopen right now, pretty much opposite would help people desperate money. Gj Italy means, show us “better” studies then, explain makes “better” confirming biases. someone explain bad? sound like jackass people getting ill well? Sounds guys cranked testing. hospitals like? new information different earlier medical advice

I wonder Housing market propped artificially. All/many people laid longer able make mortgage payments. Congress doesn’t provide long-term solution, see foreclosures start soon. 

I’m keeping little extra dry powder aside case comes sooner rather later.  Except organized. several social media posts saying protests today come join. helps. need zombies complete scenario. Non-Texan here. guy told Fauci: ""No, thanks""? couple things regular floors cannot handle, patient requires those, go ICU.

for part, it’s ventilation, low blood pressure requiring “pressors” (medications raise blood pressures), condition requires monitored every 1 hour. 

any reasons get admitted ICU. town Florida - 750 tests day open 5 pm. days closed 10-11 am. kidding exaggerating.  blamed ""moms."" Stop sexist Karen bullshit. people creating perpetuating disaster MEN. shun meme dismisses women haircut vocal opinion needs stop. 1 hour delay fetching comments.

Huge difference even close full capacity beds ventilators nurses laid off.

According people reddit one wearing masks everyone going out. Based assessment yes.

I personally think people been, least city. zero cities close trouble outside NY NJ effect ultimately (considering everyone going get it), yes afford loosen restrictions Exactly. That's I'm personally understanding. Even kill troops shape, can't still reduce combat effectiveness ? Looks like Alameda starting spike Technically that, said care dude died. There's difference. Mark words, everyone power going start pushing masks HARD, know alternative lockdown, absolutely want spend money that. Point Pence McConnell said people need start wearing masks. Trump, may enough sway save lives. Boo hoo crybaby. dimwits bring politics discussion damn virus. 97-98% survival. tick serious flu. Suck facts. Oh....and November’s gonna sweet watching crying tantrums....again 🤣🤣 Trumplandia is, it. Latin-America applies countries languages Latin roots, Portuguese has.  cut Florida push ocean? finally agree million Americans won’t die end 2020. Glad wrap up! Human beings failed experiment. everyone freaks out, could good thing virus could becoming weaker Time leisurely game golf talking to? Elon demostrates, expertise one area guarantee competence another. ...FROM LIVING! idiots believe isn’t worse Flu? Oh that’s right Florida ... carry on. Florida man going hard paint. Seems like neutral news me. new facts affect current best practices prevention. Death rate *should* slowly decrease time much better awareness treatments back Feb-Mar. matter look though, we're square middle serious problem we're months away gaining upper hand what? dude power things like this, things would consider putting place kind power, would filter population nice fast. would cause chaos, sure, would effective allow everything return normal quicker, yes. plus would thin herd little bit elderly, people health issues, effectively making population stronger less demands taxes resources (not that's huge issue anyway, still plus long run). reasons work due laws around morality emotions, fine long run keeps us human robots. Low death rate still huge casualty infect millions.  hear time doesn’t delay inevitable. soon open month exponential growth start right back up. get contact tracing etc USA dropping ball hard here. won’t counties start climb open up? people dying? Positive cases don’t mean doesn’t cause deaths Damnit where's tenacity. Pick phone up, unlock it, face time her. Right meow! Low IQ, doubt far scientists believe chances contracting food low, safe side reheat food oven home consuming. KN95's pretty reasonable market price: care whatever reason for. I'm glad finally caved. irony never even accused saying work explicitly. direct quote one behalf. got lumped sentence Birx Surgeon General infamous Tweet saying stop buying masks. messenging consistent 3 wear masks. set record straight. Everyone remembers Feb/Mar dude. remember told wear masks - look sub in. isn’t age issue, it’s introvert vs. extrovert issue. Lol they’re gonna see many people go work sheep elderly continuing blindly follow words  Even death rate stays low, zero, people still died preventable. one mayor *in* Miami one mayor *of* Miami. want receive money million people died thank offer.  count deaths starvation due going economic downturn. Depending witnesses camera coverage might worth gamble eventual lawsuit payout.  

...I motorcycle though risk vs reward meter might off. Texas elect new governor? remember Abbott signing EO April 27 reopen state minimal guidance. 

I could also wrong state guy name Abbott also governor. Woowoo California! dont, cause majority stay home, avoid people care infect other.

If get fever 2 days, call sick stay home, arent going infect someone gym home shaking bed 

So infecting others 2 days vs 5 days l ask hospice care wishes,  Lockdowns extreme measure, used hospitals overrun. 


You cant contain virus anymore, impossible widespread.

You go lockdown, chain transmission continue essential workers everything reopens.  one Mayor Miami. problem. think fundamentally changes problem comment. Like said, even 0.5% ridiculously dismissive. 0.5% mean hundreds thousands people dead many thousands permanently injured. ""No big deal"", Rubio? Yeah, no. So, statement still stands. sincerely hope end dead. I’m curious they’ll attending games so, social distancing? winning economic collapse mass unrest Oh man Flor I? Uh ? Duh? Circling drain ... Ride lightning ! Bleach bunghole too, apparently fk become people.... wonder thinks caught hoax. ... haven’t many urinary tract infections. friend party reached Macias say coronavirus, aware diagnosis attended gathering didn’t think could infect anyone symptoms, Lopez said.

This guy deserves die Free camps put city. I'm inclined think whole world pinch right now. Desperate times call desperate measures. 

I agree jobs, like call centre workers, kids making noise interrupting conversations acceptable. university workers fall category, far imagine. seems draconian likely demotivate workers already wits end. Somehow find way convince party really blame along, would done worse. never learn never will, unless affects directly even maybe not. Actually South Carolina grows lot peaches Georgia. (Native South Carolinian here) joke still applies.

But like agricultural stats. California leads way. TBH outside masked almost fine, much increase protests. schools going kill thousands though. You’ll look rising positivity rate hospitalizations. like 5-8 days now, least privately acquired testing California. jesus fuck can't believe still talking point I'm actually curious see many antivaxers jump vaccine. vaccine causing autism nearly much immediate threat (or really threat all) personal safety COVID is. might stick herd immunity rhetoric, might also bite bullet. Jeeze. article states 67% people need infected reach herd immunity. There's mention 80% article, would change numbers reported within said article. I'm talking about. Either willfully omitted mistake. guess Fauci somehow contained reported number, omitted. Otherwise, ignored. statement bias stands. cancer, get point. think biggest effect conflicting message contributed idea containment measures longer necessary.  Gov. Kemp.

Ahahahaha! Kemp first person announce opening state way have, he'll last person make mask mandate. Hell, predict Trump get board masks Kemp does. ain't gonna happen. Hey least know now, wont blindsided happens scales changed. lower end considerably lower Trump keeps setting new records. Dallas Cowboys facemasks

I Texas bucks good sir middle pandemic. mean, get without rent they'd spot rest us are-- be? makes landlord better bartender meter reader? allowing surgeries? Hmmmm, wonder would close doors? It’s hard figure out. numbers probably 7-10 days behind actual reflect portion actual sick. 

 Wife got tested last Friday (tried get tested Wednesday two day wait next appointment), still waiting results. Basically waiting 2 days appointment another 7+ days results. 

Also keep mind she’s one symptoms bad enough qualify testing, four us slightly sick don’t qualify test. that’s 5 actual positives (if that’s results end saying) show 1 positive statistics. believe would case without quarantines, shutdowns, distancing? one cares people think.

No one opened protesters. States reopened donors. Isn’t coronavirus challenge now? hold party whoever gets first wins? economy,

It's mistaken belief keeping economy going protects wealthy. doesn't. lockdowns, vast sums wealth transferred governments (ie., tax payers money) stock markets, banks big businesses small businesses decimated. people suffer anyone top 1-5% wealthy, pretty much everyone. Covid-19 used tool redistribute wealth beyond belief pockets became political

Everything political. Again, Covid used tool restrict reduce freedom masses. - even temporarily - again. worrying people willing accept without even much questioning premature death fat old people. 

I'd careful using terminology like this. nothing help argument. People lost lives, people lost relatives people love, dismiss insulting way unwarranted unecessary.  ""I thought hurricane season over!"" percentage? get librul calculus talk here! mention world, international movement parks insane would circulate places well Florida man crazy  definitely going back! I’m Missouri go back person summer school Monday district. also said elementary kids 100% classroom middle high school may online classes(they may elementary kids use middle high schools classes small). Elementary kids go person school need socializing. There's rumors around attacks keep taking servers. Wonder playing role.  2 kids 5, 2 working parents household, previously worked days home. wake early alternate every 2 hours, work go bed.

I feel like good parent, spouse employee. also feel lucky jobs divert former day care funds paying outdoor toys activities. Almost everyone office without kids said probably hard different since worked home before. twice week panic attacks say otherwise. Source? depends state, prevalent virus is. surging hot zone like FL, yeah indeed coming contact asymptomatic covid positives multiple times throughout day. Even nurses work frontline proper PPE 5 10% chance getting infected. Saying that, 20's chances falling ill slim underlying conditions. 4th July celebrations still happening? Canada everything Canada day cancelled fraction cases there. think poor children marched possible doom idiot parents. God help all. Oh we're back exponential growth? nice. I'm Florida. Drove past couple restaurants last night parking lots packed saw post it, yes Currently 70% occupied according state report many Covid cases currently hospitalized. Right, know. point was, infectious went Universal Studios, impossible contract trace everyone may exposed virus. usually check covidmetrics around noon, it’s updated. Obviously it’s surprise seeing since never see reddit post Florida’s numbers covidmetrics issues update.  Lol I’m never going outside live DFW they’ve a,ready opened amusement parks. Notice numbers here. Disney land targeted kids. makes sad, like, hurt humanity. hell Florida? It’s down. People Reddit like freak out. magical! 2,000 cases!
And hospital full PPE 🎵 Hmm there’s like word that... expo-something another.

Oh well I’m sure it’s fine. Wait 2 weeks July 4. Florida treats COVID July 4 like past couple weeks, truly clusterfuck fucking tsunami drastic action taken right now. Unless keep juking stats attributing deaths causes like pneumonia. You’re downvoted IQ definition automatically adjusted normal distribution. median raw score set IQ 100 matter what, every 15 points corresponds one standard deviation. this, definition average less median. since IQ test accounts mental disability like geniuses, stuff either end won’t skew it. 

You’re thinking IQ test everyday test probably experience variability it’s designed normal distribution. Oh look super cool! that's California, right? I'd heard happening one Florida, though know haunted houses Halloween type stuff. got done watching series second time last night. Jesus good watching first time. advancements treatment standards months. Hospitals using different medications things like proning (laying flat stomach) effective reducing symptoms. also identified new symptoms since March, loss taste/smell ""covid toes"" children previously people would attributed covid kept normal activities, spreading virus realized.

Additionally, evidence viral load plays part sick person gets. someone mild case, possible pass less even viral particles contact with. would lead increase known cases without requiring hospitalization. 

The last factor increased testing. Colorado (where am), one get tested without symptoms contact suspected.positive case. March, showing symptoms tested due lack testing resources. identifying people virus without needing medical treatment hospitalization. number goes up, ratio COVID related deaths going decline.

 doctor public health expert. things learned official resources interviews appropriate experts. get saying, article specifically saying US rushing sloppy, careless, etc.? testimony basically talking expanding something already planned months ago, idea planning produce vaccines risk ahead approval ready go one approved. US Worldometers Germany least. info comes straight German government department disease control, Robert Koch Institute.  know perfect Pinterest color coded subject planning types it.

Stay home parents, possibly homeschooling parents, showing what's behind camera.  mayor went crowded restaurant county later shut violating social distancing guidelines? many people disregarding advice wearing masks public, make sense start wearing N95 masks go shopping order protect others instead relying me? one hand I’m super excited see basketball again. hand idea going play out. Like players relatively young healthy, NBA cameraman died don’t know everyone involved going come ok. read text SB 239 make legal downgraded felony stay house may corona. many days go in? clean it? percent positive rate remains constant Yes, flattening curve vertically idk ppl think send kids back school august No, 10,000 positive antibody test published one day. Huge difference. people sick never go hospital. Death hospitalization still declining.  least they'll pretty much enclosed bubble. NY State fantastic job. Governor Cuomo daily briefings, seven days week, months. That's NY green. 10,000 new cases today too! Sure glad never crowds Disney World, FL might start see record #'s infection open! Oh, wait...... mother law lives Florida we’re Boston well. still thinks we’re crazy wearing masks stores. got masks last night ordered months ago offered few. laughed said “can’t breathe” them. We’re hoping doesn’t hit cuz lives 80 year old mom even isn’t taking serious. one family taking somewhat serious younger sister still serious ""Hard Mode."" 

Now we're ""Nightmare Mode."" y'all comment, read table one note differences ages, demographics, conditions four study groups.

Remember study biased /s Arrest organizers bioterrorism. stop quick. see parts UK coming unglued weekend Probably Eyes Wide Shut type ""party."" Thank saying Leading death cult. get dog. considered Oxygen Thief? point might well go herd immunity. Protect elders best can, everyone else go back things mindful. That’s do. There’s vaccine coming soon Florida won’t lock week again. one US will. big fan Disney live live Canada go every years. family tradition, dozen adults food drink around world Epcot. Tons fun usually spend hours  lmao dudes mad. Apparently u even question anything regarding Taiwan, ur pro china. Talk propaganda latest estimates actual number people infected 10 times higher currently reported. 250,000 cases nationwide, 2.5 million. 

We testing nearly enough people. college stoners, you’re reaffirming point, complete moron go Florida amusement park summer.  Literally place went work. No-one work (there's like 10 us, public come in). Stopped fuel way home. things touched outside work home petrol pump card reader. Even better, everything work ends doused hardcore cleaners. process elimination really Good thing it’s hoax created Jewish-controlled ventilator industry, huh guys?!!? Whether right wrong, get control people do. People make choices weigh consequences. asked opinion, sure give it. get vote.

It sucks, accepting critical life skill. FUDD.    /s Disney bad company Nestle cult like fans won’t believe that. Disney greedy treat employees like crap. never understand sad people worship amusement park. It’s really odd. So.much.this. snarky, sarcastic plain stupid? dumb, beaches problem, bars restaurants Desantis letting local government make decision. implanted mask mandate. . saw mom Christmas . doesn’t NEED see . wants go Florida that’s Drums cure corona dude

I play drums don’t corona. science backs WOOHOO! /s (why phrased like good thing) summer summer unrest Congrats new highscore Florida!

You fucking idiots Except complete DAM failures. one seriously believed surgical cloth masks \*nothing\* protect wearer. less effective medical respirators. 

But, soon decided people wear them, started saying help protect wearer.  Even much protection, claim would convince lot people wear them.

Even now, claim help convince lot people wear masks. 

Now, country needs couple billion worth advertising PR, convince people wear masks. saying memo press conference enough. need ""wear mask"" message go volume repetition political ads final weeks major campaign. saying stop testing numbers would go down? That's stable genius meant along! read it... study crap, check table one differences study populations vote Herd immunity depends good immunity. Obese, sick, nourished populations poorly vs. viruses. Plus virus mutates alot. 

Will tough. Probably said done worse seasonal influenza. guy read needles dick Where's user /r/florida told state ""good"" ""don't need help"" there's cases Canada cause ""a frozen wasteland"" one lives cause ""shithole""? Protect people, take vitamin d, get sun, wear mask, wash hands. simple would wear mask vote government lol it’s anything like last lockdown, won’t, people would go Disney World peak pandemic aren’t going kind people would quarantine anyway. Yup, agree disagree. IMO way gets shut one die, highly unlikely. titled shattered record like it’s good thing idea slammed beaches get holiday weekends? Especially year they're Blues fly 4th. everyone needs use bathrooms, go convenience stores, handful restaurants, launch docks, park lots, walk boardwalk. hanging sand much that's problem, 95% people beach trips. saving grace least panhandle, weather supposed suck weekend Great reply. counter-argument don’t know you’re talking about. question well-publicized D614G mutation something else Tbf, valuable vaccinate people likely infected. USA Brazil 2 countries bad now? rest world better? know states counting probable cases based contacts like Texas? Unfortunately think going get better.

There many people legit think whole thing hoax, believe think like Flu ""and shut everything every year people die flu"" 

Then people care get pass around, act like want take firstborn child asking wear mask public. According post, they've cancelled fastpass system using virtual lines, going extended line queues physical distancing rules.

So literally opposite suggesting (which also assumed they'd doing).

I wonder long take guests start squishing together.

Bonus: lines Disneyworld often covered sunlight, ends partially inside (and air-conditioned?) Wait video ICU wards emergency rooms leak out. people start dying heart attacks ER’s clogged Covid patients, they’ll hit go act, late. Yeah much shit I'd give Newsom various things he's done mostly good job ""You're right, count dead.""

- Ron DeSantis, probably parent toddler, really hard. social workers, essential workers (thankfully jobs done home), working time. One us 6am work everyone else one us 11pm rest go bed. also work like demons napping. Rinse, repeat new day. grateful employed one kid love dearly challenge manageable, easy ok family. look %positive # tests done. increasing Florida saying #of cases really mean much.

For example test 100,000 people 1,000 positive 1% positive rate. test 1,000,000 10,000 positive still 1 % positive rate. virus prevalent scenarios headline article would change. see #of cases good metric? good day. That’s whole reason every state rushed reopen. paying loads unemployment collecting nickels dimes tax revenue. greedy fucks. give FL Texas ideas now. name COVID funny thing US health authorities thought people would touch faces masks. know death rate trending right

why's I'm sensing pattern. . . total population 21 mil, Florida needs maintain exponential curve like 12 weeks everyone state it. Gonna accidental Green Day this, wake September ends see Florida No, absolutely not. anti-Vaxxers refusing take approved, medically vetted vaccine stupidity “freedom”. people South Africa wary leadership signing country provide people participate human trials yet unproven vaccine. Given couple months ago French scientist suggested coronavirus vaccine tested Africans cause dunno racism... every right concerned suspicious. 

For judging, go volunteer tribute participate drug trials. anti-vax movement all. New Zealand seems basically stopped it. recent cases seem international travelers contracted virus elsewhere. Alternatively, “segregation” Positive test rate went 4% 15% understand means ? means doesn’t matter many tests doing. increase often people getting tested positive per test given. It’s math bit weird understand, can’t say massive case numbers increased testing, it’s virus spreading rapidly Winning!!! New high score! Never tired winning! Fauci silver-fox / Fauci thirst trap phenomenon one intriguing trends I’ve seen while. Crowded. may non covid covid they’re still completely full. outbreak nursing home anywhere state, overwhelm hospital. 

My local hospital 18 covid positive 10 icu. icu 23 bed unit. don’t anymore icu beds. someone comes massive heart attack serious accident plain crumps med surg floors they’re fucked What's use vaccine us get infected one comes ? Hospitalizations climbing area too. local hospitals nearing capacity released statements we’re seeing increased numbers increased testing. bad places like LA right now?

Bars, restaurants (massive food culture), private parties, non-mask-wearers  see well read expert advice.  One word. Floridians! Holy shit US totally fucked up... I’m fucking scared Honestly that's week shit Florida! guys waaay better! mean wear mask everywhere try social distance can. can't social distance keep mask on. MD well are, Hogan let hardest hit counties call shots. made huge difference wait think thought response less stupid is. actually parroting trump line ""if fewer people got tested would fewer cases""?  EAT FACE!  oh look retarded. Hell, 2016 taught that. hApPeN mE!!! easier show problem one. Look table 1 percentage people less greater 65 groups. Asian countries demonstrate efficacy beginning lmao. hate China covering severity outbreak stupid believe site. point drizzling load feces. going cancelled guy forcibly removed office anyone honestly surprised? point enact 2nd ammendment? think position prima facie unreasonable, unlike many around lately. I'm really convinced based one modeling study '06 vast majority analysis I've read suggest contact tracing combined varying levels lockdowns best chance have. I'm also bit dubious argument tell IPC specialist epidemiologist. I'm one either, work humanitarian field understand training experience required make worthwhile analysis. Since training there's certain level trust need put do, think it. wrong? find hilarious two resist prove point.

They also would multiple dwelling units family members would pass ecahbother.

Even complete shut spreading like wild fire author article calls Covid-19 ""the Chinese coronavirus"" makes think they...lean certain way. piece also implies presumptive positive cases covid reported due change going be""false positives"". Another part article says something along lines reporting method changing, people symptoms considered positive! Reporting presumed positive cases mean doctors glance someone walking shout, ""That one's got it, add books"". presumed positive case would given diagnosis *based symptoms* even diagnostic tools, like x-rays. I'm assuming using side buildings this. bet people clue knew order would effective, least quickly enough.

It would interesting hearings matter. save fact, resolved. Darwin awards going need build new wing peak tourism......snowbirds also FL could happen nice human clock getting paid, really bad thing?  USA take home lot gold medals. reads Facebook beginning pandemic hit ICU 80% chance coming it.

Asymptomatic: sweltering heat giant asphalt parking lot like meant seen. average time covid patient dies ~~28~~ 18 days (edited, thanks). wait weeks.

And yes, demographics shifting younger result lower mortality rate. Also nursing home mortality terrible shifted numbers higher previously.

Last looked South Korea mortality rate around 0.5% due younger group people infected church superspreader event. good testing coverage contact tracing provides clearer picture situation. virus mutated become less lethal, expect something like that. fewer overrun ICU's May compared April? symptoms? watching people eat ice cream/turkey leg/deep fried whatever, touch everything around usually enough get stay away theme parks, nevermind deadly pandemic go it. Imagine still trolling 2020 like fucking sad lol love going Orlando vacation I'm sorry, Florida seeing money least next year. EXTREMELY rare instances. pure silliness make kind claim couple months existence.

No, fact stop fear mongering. virus going part lives forever - sooner accept that, sooner get past this. lockdown fully...today...

Like *that’s* going happen. 

Stay Orlando, beaches year folks. It’s worth it. you’re tired too? Glad know I’m one 😕 Yeah like I'd love travel sensible right surge ICU beds fill longer take CovID patients,then yes might increase deaths somewhat, like gonna significantly increase infection rate people ill enough need ICU likely gonna sneezing people willy nilly. clear either. point percentage increase positive results overall numbers tests reason number cases going up. ignore increasing number tests makes overall count go doesn’t help anything. society narcissists king narcissist leading ""hoax"" bullhorn. always thought Golf Solo Sport play others.

Besides, damn hard. grab it, pull face. know COVID anyway. need stupid swab test. I'm way smarter CDC. /s don’t doubt he’s tested. I’m shocked hasn’tonce said tests horrible, dismissed nothing. 

We know strong opinion one way another everything. 20% positivity rate, fine, everything fine. there’s three roles company might fit type work do. located Broomfield mentioned, company still offices mostly remote. interviews done remotely. They’re also awesome work/life perks.

Trump said like 2 months ago everyone needs test get test. tests would beautiful, like phone call president Ukraine. means.....  means it’s fake news must hoax. think still 1st wave recently begun sweeping relatively untouched swaths southern regions, especially, southern locations densely populated.

My prediction that, based fact northern regions ravaged 2-4 months, it'll take least long southern states get things control.

CV19 could come back strongly October weather shifts, think whether southern states lull cases depends many months take tamp case loads.

I think that, regardless, northern states perform better Autumn time prep, well state go't officials seem take CV19 seriously. Clearly you’re parroting talking points don’t actually know anything study design. 

1. observational study
2. study notes “Hydroxychloroquine-treated patients severely ill baseline receive hydroxychloroquine (median ratio partial pressure arterial oxygen fraction inspired oxygen, 223 vs. 360)”

I'm surprised many people see ineffectiveness masks lie beginning. pretty hot topic conversation? Everyone Asia said ""wear masks"". Papers effectiveness masks circulation. knew aerosols could persist indoors 3 hours. homemade cotton mask good N95, always rated 60% effective (or better). goes back studies SARS circulation.

I mean, said ""masks effective"" doctors nurses take off? Many resort scarves bandannas, still wore them.

Granted, US media coverage place, information came white house trustworthy, skipped went straight source. data available online. hard find. Toilet paper, hand... 20k. doubled every week. 4th July going even worse.

You really believe idiots exist NBA. Sure, ton money line. well documented NBA huge gambling streak. Players gamble everything. since least 90s Bulls. idea players flat earth theorists Covid truthers right hit America completely eschewing interaction public possible. 


Especially, way normal public acting. way players already exposed planning expose 4th July. aunt symptoms tested positive it. STILL thinks it’s hoax got flu doctor lied get money. I’m like 🤷🏼‍♂️ Wow, rise cases deaths last thing want see. 

That’s I’m Masks All. You’re one thinking it’s hoax. man lot retaliation power. NY fine, antibody tests showed 10x number confirmed cases puts around 4 million total infected study Sweden show twice many people beat virus Cells alone without creating antibodies looking around 11 million infected.

They going stroll line herd immunity. 50% positive test rate pretty bad. 'til intubation goes maw really way works? uninformed arbitrary decision, cost knows many lives, made apparatchik? career party man? people absolutely die COVID without pre-existing conditions young age. it’s rare, never know you. safe. Alternative headline “Florida leading world testing”

How many deaths happening? hospitals overpopulated? Gotta ask right questions First all, 8.8% incarcerated private institutions, prisons. Jails prisons kind getting here. Private prisons exceedingly rare. Private jails bit common. whole grand scheme things common. welcome ignore then.

The people dying people willing listen him. Back advised masks, COVID much less catastrophe now. everyone worth listening advising people wear masks months now.

Oh, cancel culture fuck off. another issue. coworker say mom last Thursday mom it. covers face times puts hot. erks although isnt spreading germs large degree normal breathing, sneeze cough away possibly infecting us all. think got hint today told could die get it. What? dare learn past change way things? crazy. luck daycare never closed.

Stay safe there. That's sad. Ah, that's problem, stop testing numbers go down! What’s point testing vaccine made people Africa people US China? would cost lot money conduct tests different continent.

I can't help learn interested. ignorant. continue link protests influx COVID cases, true proven untrue. also said California highest surge, true either.

Look, want walk around big ball dumb, go it. rest us, however, I'd guess majority people know personally, know dumb done trying educate you.

Good luck whatever plan future. things GOP literally done process lol Even Minneapolis, biggest protests were, okay right now. Iowa Wisconsin spiking harder even though smaller protests. Murica nr 1 baby unlikely die off, considering long incubation time percentage people aren’t harmed it. Can't blame ignored continue cycle like time reopen number cases skyrocket 

so we're going open/close repeat cycle people stop getting tested virus? people saying catch virus multiple times? continually test population successfully confirm virus completely eradicated/immunity achieved.  would generally agree Americans going willingly comply coming ""quarantine"" go back it? makes concerned impact second wave American response guidelines. 


I imagine vaccine around within next 1.5-2 years minimum - bet effectiveness really low. plus large amount population refuse vaccine come play. 


I suppose treatment probably best case scenario like 6 months there's really talk successful treatments. Plus co-morbidity age at-risk believe one size fits treatment come (time tell that). 


my point looking like hypocrites stopping mask wearing would sudden stop caring infecting others around amount bacteria? would agree wearing mask try stop spread Covid specifically, never thought stopping spread bacteria? Covid gone, mask longer relevant ""taking care at-risk population""? Where's lady vampire need one many counties don’t 20 cases? Locking country 330 million people living 50 separate states would never work. Misssssssster Biggs looks infectious less deadly.

I would interested know number people 65+ home, versus live assisted living facility, family, 55+ restricted community. would willing bet number gets smaller older get. bad, badly expressed point part. thought exposing points failure seems like partial collapse system introduces security risks bad actor exploit. I'm guessing dispatch still route ambulances hospitals free beds even public informed extra strain would lead catastrophic results. little late, ya think? ""If get corona, get corona..."" 

History repeats i'm affraid. :(

I feel deep sympathy people hopelessly trying best avoid infecting people time protect themselves. thought Disney making park visitors sign waiver. Maybe misunderstood.

It become indictment campaign pass away. ancillary stories heard bit ago neighborhoods creating environment, using social media connect apartment buildings blocks. think technology half problem, could go long ways towards making solution deaths still low we're good! deaths pick shut it'll stop straight away lag all

/S RNA shows comes Chinese bat pangolin viruses...   
The blame game still counter productive every government still continued ignore China started sharing info publishing treatment containment guidelines anyways. people allergies know always seem know due mold/pollen count high day, attribute something specific. people get viruses call allergies. rollllll tide! Sad true. 

I hate here. Right yeah like none us need pay bills food/housing super easy time find job right fine /s. could happen. complete mystery.. Fucking Leopards. states aren’t? I’m MI work, masks aren’t mandatory inside, sanitary measures meh best, etc. school something similar. Nearly every aspect school in-person online options. Although school fractions size USC. ***USA! USA!*** pointed out, like damn it, I'm dumb need re-learn functions again. many years :/ Maybe. hard believe state like Idaho much judicious New York Massachusetts.

I feel like wave across United States took longer thought would reach everywhere.  Hell, remember thought/hoped virus already everywhere February-April took us notice.  know stories people swore thy sick early spring?

A non-profit Idaho offered quick easy antibody testing months ago.  Thousands tested, thought may exposed. antibody rate minuscule, 1%. That's convinced virus really show Idaho significant degree last month.  course part Idaho exactly destination even somewhere pass through, there's ton travel relative states. Congrats, FL! knew could it! Let’s go Australia!! US gov't dump soap hurricanes, take care coronavirus. Good. They'll probably reach herd immunity lot states. Big true 5% Florida's population would indeed million. think talking 5% catch it, 5% entire state. mortality rate ratio entire population SIGNIFICANTLY less 5%.

Edit: checked numbers, there's 149,000 cases Florida ~3,549 deaths it. would appear suggest mortality rate 2.5%, .6% population contracted virus great enough extent tested (149,000 √ 22,000,000). basically we're currently sitting one death every 6,200 people. make pie chart bar chart visually display data, probably able distinguish sliver represents deaths. everyone going bathroom... LA Times original article Daily Fail cribbing from: floridian, confirm this. mom's friend got disease long ago. kind work do? you’re field, know people company HQ location Broomfield. They’re still hiring everyone remote. go it? see Italian news didnt reach America. Italian military transporting dead bodies town multiple truck convoy cus crematory overwhelmed. Nurses said stopped counting dead hospitals.  

To honest day news came rememer clearly later TV showed bunch retarded american partying Miami beach cus spring break dont care flu. enjoy party since already payed it. That’s enough Reddit today. number *new cases. Yet people wonder lost credibility. really number genuine new cases? many people simply testing enzymes actually “ill” virus? allowed see raw data?

EDIT: isn’t even source tied article. many awards upvotes? Please explain. Yo, never bought stocks really know work.

But based layman impression, seems like no-brainer easy money invest stock caskets, tombstones, embalming companies, etc.

Can make buck predicting consequences mass naivete ignorance?

I'm trying greedy ""profit tragedy"" looks way. Ideally I'd happy enough money afford fucking therapy.

Can anyone ELI5? best distracted beach car parked 10 minutes away suddenly notice apocalypse bearing black (not gray) clouds much lightning. least barely ever tornados.

Edit: [a picture someone took Miami I’m worried “crushing curve” becoming “complete elimination Covid”, simply impossible. disease around forever. 

Do see slippery slope like happening? Diamond Princess Navy ships saw 20% people infected *while making best effort quarantine people*. 

What prisons they’ve seen 80-90% population test positive? Army training session news day saw 90% soldiers infected? 

To put perspective, I’m viral immunologist don’t think there’s chance hell cross reactive cells preventing 80% population catching virus. best, they’re responsible people mild symptoms instead severe. could also realistically making disease worse cases (by competing cells better match specific virus). understand deaths counted you?

They don’t “reset” say. sure warped reality living in. Please source think reset original estimate. read post too. Basically Corona mutating cells something, growing tentacles  'Merica first Basically 30\~50% total cases Florida counties last 2 weeks.  
  


Miami : 15k ( last 2 weeks ) /38k 
Palm Beach : 5k (last 2 weeks ) / 15k  
Pinellas : 4k ( last 2 weeks ) / 7k

etc, pretty insane definitely use antibiotic prescribed doctor testing reveals specifically kind bacterial infection has. one, take it. Abx rarely indicated except population seems infected bacteria YEARS can't get rid it. abx talking prescribed doctor evaluated gf wants try way preventing bacteria taking hold her. covid, let take it. gf's brother doing, well Mexican pharmacies allowing OTC abx, largely abx meds become ineffective create super bacteria longer killed current meds. People die way.

Also: much work done create new abx meds, act like doc ""fix up"". Maybe older abx work, always. Stop allowing people self-treat abx Mexico needs get memo. Instead nonexistent C19 testing centers, finally see *Trolls: World Tour* screen deserves drank koolaid denial getting played... grandpa moved U.S. Australia said first time saw snow ran street underpants whooping shouting Well based many people see covering mouths, nose, can't really disagree there. already sold passholders. hope reality unfortunately two different things. Florida man done again! 1,629 new SC

16.9% positive rate, 9,600 tests think overestimating intelligence average person. Hurricanes see eyes call fake blind, can’t said virus won’t see effects large amount population dead Nope. Money always win out. Human beings inherently selfish, greedy assholes whatever benefits first everyone else last. world burning safe way escape spaceship, bet ass they'll leave everyone else behind. shared links data have

You shared one link, read shows data unreliable, period

Yeah undercounted. mean explanation number excess deaths seeing? Cause I'm guessing scared actually admit virus killed 130k Americans. deregulation always good. gobermnmenment can't tell Testing increased 10%. Infections increased something like 70%. math isn’t show connection. We're already guaranteed spot finals, losing even matter? I'm working testing lab Washington. get huge shipments Florida everyday, work literally night process many samples possible. Im super worried people florida, left dust completely!! We're getting shitton testing done lot facilities like us. lose hope Congratulations achievement! Thanks, big brother, thought regulator. absurd comment. Americans travel Canada sorts reasons apart tourism. month since marked increase cases daily deaths remain weeks though, right? I'm pro vaccine health care worker introduced vaccine campaign increase childhood vaccine compliance significantly.

And credible sources claims like ask :) might sound dickish, that's them. Prior virus network why? Interpersonal skills? Skin color? wanting insular? We've spent decades pulling away people need them. Exactly. way putting family's lives hands irresponsible parents send sick kids school year 'round. Florida hit August nothing changes. Consumerism gluttony. said earlier, but: wtf there's tornado hurricane strengthens unexpectedly, they've got triage tents full sedated people ventilators? There's nowhere put might time move - can't imagine situation  absolutely agree. worked education since 2010 understand risks. choir musical theater person, pains say may available due increased transmission risk. football basketball needing canceled. 

Schools going ultimate test ability handle pandemic. I'd like see experts focus far greater degree things like bars recreation. politicians worried economy right looked forward absolute disaster headed way next month. Rather putting efforts money retail, need ramping education hiring services, planning expanded teaching staff temporary classrooms reduce size. also need consider public funding accommodations teachers, similar nurses doctors put hotels. 

We need looking international counterparts direction. countries reopened schools? reimagine PE recess free all, structured activity involve close contact? instances teachers aides utilized work small groups limit exposure rather everyone class time? 

I seen data transmission rates children adults. likely severe adult adult transmission? data analysis sets people looking day cares operating months? 

This easy thing manage. concern public health experts media focusing narrowly medical aspects currently. experts public health specializes non-medical fields need step forward make heard.

And that's issue.

Samet massive opportunity platform pressure Polis state reps/senators increase assistance handling back school issue. responsibility bringing interviews u/9news media. missed op-ed signed dozens education public health professionals published nytimes demanding administration focus schooling? 

On different note: think good chance another teacher strike. work without increased support, hazard pay, etc. Demand 4 day school week possible allow cleaning 3 days. Increase number custodial staff. Reduce standardized testing allow leeway curriculum. Use moment make significant worthwhile changes system. like bomb lit fuse. Exactly, people can't accept can't normal life right I'm sick headline...every day every couple days...

Can stop winning now? would trump intended said would magically disappear July. He’s going curtail testing. sabotage it. testing large enough demographic accurately formulate doubling time virus. likely around 7 days  Nope. PPE absolutely inexcusable, I’ve read Canada example made self sufficient PPE last months leaders apparently eating glue corner. 

My understanding ventilators aren’t quite high demand. They’re still needed, actually took action doctors really try everything keep patients ventilators now, treating different steroids/vitamins/drugs weren’t back March. go ventilator you’ve basically got 20% chance survival, even survive it’s likely you’ll long term damage it. bueno still needed last resort problem people going disney world come back states.

People work keep talking upcoming vacations. Wtf wrong people? don’t know is, seems like lot people become desensitized unless directly effects them. point, becomes late. tell sunglasses crowd didnt believe dangerous Unfortunately lot people spreading misinformation due misunderstanding one statement cdc.

People need use complete information context.  may underestimating many Americans don’t care virus anymore. one them. still hunkering down. Absolutely trending upwards. argue they're shattering previous records. 
    
    
    
    
  
Last one anecdotal... USA USA USA 🇺🇸 

Keep shattering records baby 5.3 million dollars, I'll *make* time. Man getting old reading every day. get America sucks. friend notified one coworkers tested positive COVID. worked 2 days ago wearing mask. contract COVID, could get tested today, time need pass test accurate? tested negative today mean clean? see absolute loss? always going curve always going go slowly. tried cities, counties, businesses trying fight enforcing anything openly stating this. People felt could wanted nothing going happen anyways. 
 
The Sheriff county said they're enforcing anything mask mandate. Yep, Gov Cuomo leading mountain side :( Even completely true, parents spending money, time stress spend they'd followed rules, penalty itself. better lot regulations see covid, enforced state all. Well go USCarolina get choose! person online. Teachers get choose! Everyone gets choose :) Yea mean think best case scenario cases stay median age around 30 there’s barely deaths. long unhealthy old don’t get it, don’t see problem. 15% positive 100 tested population 1000, .015% population.

14.5% positive 200 tested population 1000, .029% popluation.

The commenters insulting sake argument, simple math talking about. Zoom little bit extra data validation points, ei. Looking total infected population rather total testes only.

Hope helps. testing, information learn from. Fuck ya man. Keep up. I'm sure whatever say reasonable. 😐 Well it’s Walmart, would great snack business Disneyworld doesn’t involve congregating crowds? haven’t since 1977 6. non congregating activities there? good website check positivity rate tests.

Looks like Florida went 12% positive 16% last 10 days.

Hopefully younger people older people.

The US total 7% positive. peak 22% around April 1st low 4.5% early June. Ahh, thanks. I'm always sceptical ""sources"" I've heard of. level stupidity, ignorance flat selfishness going right now.

People always stupid. easier notice stakes gone up. 

It took 10 years Bush go ""maybe worst war criminal US history"" ""swell guy"" Reddit. 

This change nothing. learn nothing this. even dumber 10 years now. We're #1!!! Well, great time remodel, since impact business dining room already closed. take time probably get good deal contract.

Same reason lot cities spinning infrastructure projects difficult traffic levels dropped. l find insane still making mask-wearing mandatory enforcing rule.

By point countrywide rule enforced.

Our leaders failing us. us comply science, mask-wearing. (I'm wearing mask I'm wearing you.)

Look got hell-bent seatbelt wearing became rule enforced. Way back people wear seatbelts either.

Remember remember vote November! Might wanna read check day NBA tournament Florida month. I'm shocked backed yet. unhealthy old get let young people catch though. It’s wishful thinking suppose virus contagious stick young folk people still refusing even wear mask What’s median age new cases? hospitalizations deaths correlating? Huh? random tests know. will.

In addition changing leadership next election, country continue exist pay lip service principles like justice, accountability, fairness. 

If there's retribution they've done corporations corrupting government officials who've bought, country going last much longer. watch three loved ones die cancer. lucky experience one. Asymptomatic basically means virus making antibodies, virus effecting differently. hard really gauge much information tossed around least understanding. read account asymptomatic carriers never showing symptoms developing decreased arrived decked full PPE ready sedate immediate ventilation, thought arrived wrong bed. sat comfortably chair, speaking mobile phone daughter, bemused appearance. Overcautious colleagues, thought, measured blood oxygen saturation case, instinct concern. appearance expected close normal (100%). 75% – level barely compatible conscious. "" I'm sure want me. I'm sure aware we're middle fucking pandemic. world pandemic struggle find adequate answers questions flipping perfect answer question *during pandemic*. much I'm recognizing capacity issue I'm looking work now. latest information likelihood outdoor transmission? feel like we've waiting tentative data now, studies reached consensus yet? studies I've seen seems like outdoors large impact lowering transmission rates, I'm field full picture situation. pretty sure putting eggs ""herd immunity"" basket. genuinely don’t see lapse logic here? You’re saying one hand increased testing doesn’t account increase reported cases, turning around saying decreasing testing would decrease number reported cases. It’s literally impossible things true.

Also, you’re wrong testing. years ago many people around world would agree USA best country live in.

Corona, BLM protests, failing American healthcare system, turned image around completely. That's great dont complain unemployed instead constant rate hospitals furloughing staff due economic reasons.

The first sentence link:
""Many U.S. hospitals health systems suspended elective procedures save capacity, supplies staff treat COVID-19 patients.

As result suspending nonemergent procedures, several systems lost expect lose large chunk annual revenue, forcing make cost reduction top priority. 

Below breakdown hospitals furloughed staff effort remain financially stable amid COVID-19 pandemic. ""

That support link text. fact, says opposite. freed capacity money take care expected COVID patients. latest estimates find put 31.2% ICU beds used COVID patients.

Your link dated June 24th. cherry pick old article? stopped reporting day later, 25th hit 100% ICU capacity. Now, going surge capacity deal influx COVID COVID patients ones need ICU. even ""only"" 35% patients COVID patients, that's good situation since regular load 60-75% per reference, means 100% capacity used people die due adequate care. following link anecdotal information shows attempting find new beds. seem like misinformation me. new cases yesterday checked 5:00 pm, we’re surprisingly well. I'll leave parameter issues later (like assuming best testing per day anywhere world replicated consistently.) Look Table 3. r0 1.00 means disease eventually achieve 100% penetration population. speed depends incubation, reasonably modeled 5 days. That's quick epidemiological terms. particularly interesting present handful scenarios 1.00 extremely generous assumptions. likely really wanted something included looked like viable solution. look number required quarantines per day scenarios. 500,000 700,000 per day (they already 10k symptomatic per day rising ignore second third column). UK population 65m. 

The model's predictions boil ""we slow little methods still infect everyone"". scale self quarantine required meaningful stem spread even model even optimistic assumptions (the author's phrase) far total quarantine. requires vastly investment. point waste resources go song dance end point. 

Even agree resource allocation conclusion make hope see unreasonable. strength WHO's position subject align reasonable policy making. Anyhow thanks engaging something meaningful. Disney World opens 12 days. Based statsbro math phrasing bit off. deaths lag 32-128x many **deaths** cases. Whoever made headline must proud NZ could go walks stay local. allowed proper hiking often leads people needing rescued, would mean people would come isolation. surfer bros Realistically - long think resume life pre-pandemic style (no masks everything open normal capacity)? People learned world. Several times over... Stop spreading misinformation, countries getting virus control even “recovering” possible life long problems, healthy 20-30 year olds “recovering” can’t walk upstairs without running breath. 

Sick people trying downplay shit country miserably fails handling it. wife considered nanny share youngest. cost would same. timeline Tulsa event visa-vi infection right. season ticket holders petitioning calling would work much better Nobody could seen coming!! Oh fuck sake
That’s ruined weekend It’s Age thing. Jacinda Ardern, PM NZ 39 years old, feels wholly responsible nation 5 million people. DeSantis’ political situation like watching nice girl get back together shitty, abusive, ex again.

Why? CHOOSE pain suffering? state (FL) released guidelines education would work pandemic. 40% ""Kids need school"" 40% ""here's awesome money we're getting Feds"", 20% repetition CDC guidelines out. mention fact social distancing can't happen inside small classrooms. pretty much reads ""what happens, happens"".

All practical stuff pushed local level, people equipped deal types things. really going boil efforts individual teachers make keep kids separated, make wash hands, supposedly teaching time. Finally somebody found common sense! states reporting probable covid deaths others not. official death rate missing least 10-20% covid related deaths right now. sounds hard deal I've seen many incredibly responsible... not. room latter year. mean can't really fault dude died going small outdoor gathering city/state said ok. I'd bet people thread done something similar friends family since covid began. 

The issue dumbass friend. used laugh McDonald's dual drive-thru ordering windows. anymore. must happy able handle additional traffic, focus kitchen drive-thru orders get fast. roughly 23% increase deaths states pretending Corona related. automod sucks. deleted mine word kapatolizm discussing healthcare system operates. itz jUST

In Worse Case scenario thing stays reactivated later on. Draconian Measures Necessary America Fucked. Developed uncivilized. That’s exactly thinking. aren’t employees petitioning company itself? Touché made choice. hope didn’t infect anyone taking precautions. Wait, portion populace exact opposite whatever scientist advise? 

And refuses follow rules anyone passes protect people?

U-S-A! wonder friend sue guy knew covid tell anyone. Finally someone writes something that’s true, Americans thinking second wave funny Okay, fair point. never thought implications state level, right costs bear need support well. Hard job losing tax income expected help people like feds are. Houston legit got week max surge capacity up. Oh it. ex wants visit daughter said it’s totally fine wear mask play outside! doesn’t want wear one. said he’s going “find way get shit test antibodies” ummm.. ok dude. that. 36 percentage increases much telling important number. Politicians exempt rules Reminder theme parks opened month ago normally go...in Walmart parking lot. saying wrong childcare education goes well beyond 15 months. Yes countries better developed paternal/maternal leave, two incomes pretty common across developed countries schools going run anywhere close before, virus *really* become universal. Dozens kids congregating playing, practicing social distancing, perfect vector spread contagion. Exponential growth bad model, good anyone took calc 1 hs understands it. Better model (though probably still good, virologist) [logistic don’t think people really going notice hospitals get overrun. Americans already made minds, don’t take seriously stay way someone within circle friends, work, church, whatever, needs serious/emergency medical care beds hospital. -may- begin take seriously. Maybe. Numbers won’t matter them, experience give shit “Democracy worst form government, except others.”

-Winston Churchill nice! Florida state income tax. understanding due primarily tourism. So, Disney hotel tax revenue... tax revenue public health funding. Seems Florida really put bind. Maybe you’re confused. I’m suggesting it, i’m telling fact college person classes. *literally* received email saying university.  show better studies says doesn’t. Right Desantis said really anything worry about, he's going go backwards, so... (And yes, I'm bit sarcastic). Bad troll bad. We're lucky kids teenagers. manage pretty much check make sure turned work got good grades. I’m safe 😎 Good see logic round. wonder many people position rally embarrassed admit US actively experiencing growing testing backlog. Right now.

Justify want virus care participation trophies.

No one cares much US tests testing enough also flooding system. Ok. looked back April 3rd 32,963 new cases. June 19th 33,582. Two weeks April 3rd (April 17, since I’m told deaths lag two weeks) 2,596 deaths. Tomorrow two weeks past June 19th holding steady well 1,000 deaths. I’m wondering people think happening here? lower age infected? Better treatment? know people quick fall back ‘wait two weeks’ obviously something else keeping death rate lower was. There's way knowing got code contact tracing shit Don’t worry, Florida already shown willing count dead saw local news morning we're running low test kits already.  always reigned true lower income single parents, parents dealing now. 

My family hasn’t really affected thankfully. mom SAHM stepdad works manager full time industry never really affected anything. Even money ever get low reason options. school job remote could come home, stat them, help out. lot expanded family also live city even street little “village” per say. remote jobs well could allow everyone work together needed. Florida fire, everyone's walking around like good. Fucking crazy times. even 24 hours? give shit number people tested? can’t tell anything that. could negative tested today positive tomorrow. - get tested again?

And unless uniform can’t tell anything anyway. people never tested, people once, people twice, Trump ilk likely tested daily. 

The numbers matter hospitalizations, ICU admissions deaths. tested 10 times counted individually 10 times. die once. Hostpitals lot better treating now. read somewhere 1 4 died April would now. Yea sure, I'm means educated stock market economics general. 

I guess seems plausible things would take awhile fall apart. close businesses means people work, crowding job market, exhausting savings/available leverage struggle stay afloat. Eventually foreclosures bankruptcies start, enter negative cycle hard pull of. happen immediately, awhile people struggling. 

I dunno. hope I'm right. isn’t time frame still recovering also non infectious? Like recovering still testing positive two months - would infectious entire time?

I’ve recently read timeframe infectious roughly two weeks. gonna say everyone always leave hockey? announcement bubble cities Canada gave much hope, might sport get see season finish year Could use Texas necktie put string front mouth say things even intimate things

Sure did, mean imply?

Go careless, virus going away deal virus going part lives forever - sooner accept that, sooner get past this.

Did mean ""Get past this"" magically go away ""Get past this"" ""stop pretending big deal live life"".

It deadly flu.:

I asked name 2 diseases affect us like covid 19 does. Thousands die flu every year, dude.

So random factoid threw answering trying say Flu Covid 19 similar?

Vaccines Vaccines nothing eradicate disease.

You said this. said would NOTHING. pure stupidity. Anybody 2 brain cells rub together knows vaccine help turn pandemic every day thing like flu.

I done proving wrong over. seriously pathetic. Well technically, is: warning first violation, $250 fine subsequent violations. cost us money shame gg still serious severe fatigue 24/7, weakness, chest pain/pressure, shortness breath (even sitting sometimes), heart palpitations, insomnia, headaches, eye pain/weakness, muscle pain/weakness, joint pain, numb hands, brain fog, acne like rash across face/neck/chest (never life), bloating, sense smell taste come back fully (predominant tastes bitter &amp; salty, except sour things taste sweet - mostly smell bad smells), look like ghoul dark circles pale, blotchy, puffy face, weird things come go. activity makes symptoms worse - small chores going walk leaves back bed. end spending half time bed still, depressing love active getting stuff done. I'm 49, btw.

And thank you. Working it, man, almost 5 months, I'm pretty depressed. 6 months emergency payments Canadians helping too. Eh, wrong one. God almighty, next time choose one toupee. There’s 351?! Dang. That’s like two football teams. “Hey ya’ll, watch this” doctor friend mine told story young man suffered 2 day erection due blood clots. embarrassed tell anyone shame blood wasn’t circulating meaning lost penis. believe average Ontario 1 2 days.  time shine! 

Your post reminds time worked Walmart one night, coworker close. went home shortly shift returned work next day find co-worker closed night before, car stolen Walmart parking lot.

The car found day two later closer live, (\~12 miles job), cinderblocks instead wheels. Good ol' Walmart security cameras. warning you’re black... 4 months.  Florida? Think bigger hero fallen: herman cain, mr. 999. taken tulsa Got it, Abbott charge didn’t reopen state, didn’t counter LT governors statements people die economy, Patrick doesn’t work governor’s office, Abbott’s never seen heard he’s elected separately. okay man?

I felt like moron walked office drink drink - looked around room realized idiot! point, lockdowns become ridiculous. sacrificing much (including lives lost missed treatments non-covid diseases) save fat old boomers. Distance learning work young kids. 5 year old getting zoom call Kindergarten? worthless source frustration. kid lost half pre-k year, lost play dates, socialization , camps, etc. Us working parents tired sacrificing kids futures government continue inept coming way prepare fall. School must re-open. article SPOT ON. Oh, protests states increase? No, not. Therefore protests cause. different? Reopening. need. Must demoralising medical staff, definitely front line COVID losses.

All people want beer beach. Trump must love deaths per day 10 week now. Yeah unlikely enforced, mandates increase compliance worthwhile step, especially Abbott. positive rate close 20% Florida, extremely high compared places control virus. best, 10k positives 20% positive rate represents much higher infection rate comparisons case numbers places much lower case numbers (for example, would mean well 10 times actual infection rate UK around 1k positives per day around 1% positive rate). worst, means even comparisons purely internally weeks Florida, 'doubling' actually doubling, real prospect positive rate high; infection rate increases rapidly, unless testing capacity increases incredibly quickly well, real infection rate increase faster confirmed case rate simply larger proportion tested positive, greater proportion infected likely missed testing. Intuitively, 20% positive rate says Florida unable test huge numbers people symptoms, resultant underestimation gets worse case number rises test numbers rise much. wont fill up, moving average flat weeks supposed high already see low hospitalization cross reference new York virus progression get . really .im struggling lot lately . Thanks reminding though bc it’s life . need let go . 💕 Honestly point, headlines sound like competition ""...well actually"" kind crowd sub. Mostly shut ins dogmatic people gleefully shame. representative honest curiosity desire learn. think States competing. Gotta step Texas. late, fallout felt next weeks.   shit starts getting real, they're going go Lord Flies us. 

When food shortages start happening, people told ration flour... they'll grab AR15s march around grocery stores instead barbershops.

Sadly that's probably US peaked far leadership even nuts like McCarthy running around still techniques. look total dead 2020 compare 2019/2018/2017 see massive discrepancy many people died vs would expected. could double could take confusion opportunity ask, ""What missing?""

A lot medical testing African countries done without informed consent.

[Here's Pfizer drug Trovan used clinical trial Kano, Nigeria. trial compared new antibiotic (Trovan) best treatment available time (intravenous ceftriaxone). Eleven children died trial: five taking Trovan six taking older antibiotic used comparison clinical trial. Others suffered blindness, deafness brain AZT trials conducted HIV-positive African subjects U.S. physicians University Zimbabwe performed proper informed consent.[4] United States began testing AZT treatments Africa 1994, projects funded Centers Disease Control (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), National Institutes Health (NIH). included testing 17,000 women medication prevents mother-to-child transmission HIV/AIDS. subjects fully understand testing methods, effectiveness, possible dangers, nature placebo testing situations.[4] also told trials duress.[4] Half women received placebo effect, making transmission likely. result, estimated 1000 babies contracted HIV/AIDS although proven life-saving regimen already existed.[4] CDC ended short course testing 1998 announced enough information Thailand trials.[4]

Earlier symptoms ,= people stay home sooner , less spread Yes, already butchered it. middle ground *is* respecting social distancing, utilizing PPE actually following capacity lines. states took joke likely choice another lockdown coming, hopefully time serves lesson. 

IF northeast actually keep stay leveled reopenings 0 excuse states learn. feel like wasn’t real didn’t get hit like did, it’s real made reservations tonight asked everyone’s name sitting table Austin. idea would track it, though. said month ago. gonna real bad. Worked well ct. Oh wait, well educated, halfway decently run state Sweden stops 5,000 6,000 deaths, know they’ve reached herd immunity, didn’t need kind lockdown.

they're past 5,000 6,000 yet. deaths per day seem going fall category calling bullshit wear mask advice Fauci peddled March. difficult comprehend? Fauci saying 'do walk around mask' - thankfully ignoring information walking around mask. turns out, correct so, thanks vilifying it.  would love see masked manatee. feel way. virus already widespread impossible suppress current measures taken. I'm willing bet stay-at-home order issued somewhere coming weeks. hills choose die on! bus go. sympathy me, I’ve already lost family this. saying Trump right? Less testing better? Also good know Right chap wasn’t wrong. Unless don’t believe asymptotic carriers real it’s logistically reasonable expectation “entering herd immunity territory” somehow able get 71% positive rate. 

If r0 2.5 herd immunity defined 60%. close non negligible portion carriers asymptotic, it’d amazing feat able allocate tests efficiently enough get 71%+ positive rate. outcome characterized amazing, shouldn’t expectation. CT resident, tell 99% people wear masks. seen single unmasked person indoors public place since started  Even that, would say numbers conservatively high - I'm sure Dutch count Covid deaths, anything like rest world, there's little distinction dying C-19 *of* C-19.

In States, doctors getting financial kickbacks diagnosing C-19.

In many countries 'assumed' Covid enough count Covid death - test even required.

In Spain Italy, clue people dying many old folks drop like flies time.

Canada really fucking weird - [National surveillance case COVID-19 states one added COVID list suffer “onset cough” coupled participating “in mass gathering identified source exposure.”

A Canadian also branded COVID case “fever” “close contact confirmed case COVID-19.” comes “close contact,” close talking about? close seems:

*“…a single laboratory confirmed case COVID-19 \[long-term care home\], resident staff member would trigger outbreak would declared.”*

In words, maintenance man senior’s home 800 residents tests positive COVID, 800 residents would meet “close contact” qualifier.

Ontario Health’s [Case Definition – Novel Coronavirus confirms this: runny nose “being patient ward facility nosocomial outbreak COVID-19” add Grandma COVID case count.

So even look numbers - *which actually high -* lie large portion bullshit. would surprised C-19 turned even less deadly flu. Best decision ever made move Ft. Lauderdale New Hampshire '99. Cops thinking laws dont apply them?

How ever get used acting like that? Thank framing like this. notion blame exactly deep shit. he, deceased, put effort knowing works, instead relying whatever distilled shoddy news information sources fed think, wouldn’t gone visited friend all, best, remained socially distanced wore mask. It’s friends fault all. Period. (The friend kind idiot sad play)

**So notion blame: person takes responsibility actions, minimizes susceptibility actions others.**

Because people equated “opening up” “virus gone,” erased gains made: mistake one. I, personally, didn’t think anything changed powers-that-be wanted save economy complete irreversible destruction opening things up. Yeah, fucked working process live virus getting message new reality process *may* minimize risk. **you** paid attention, probably realized nothing changed respect virus, still things you’ve keep risk minimum. Right?

It’s like std hiv. hook someone rely fact say “clean” take PReP unprotected sex? Well, could, hope ok, orrrrr, wear condoms part minimize risk yourself.

You chose want place blame death friend. died failed educate thus protecting himself, instead, rested entire fate misinformation friend also equally misinformed. 

You place blame others nothing could prevent harm yourself, like car wreck drunk runs red t-bones you. pandemic today people protecting placing lives others hands.

So vinegar horrible odor, friend said ""Fuck it"", took cloth. Suddenly felt burning sensation tear gas 100x worse vinegar put cloth again. fun watch.

So vinegar lockdown tear gas coronavirus. vinegar helps deal gas get tired it, delude breathe fresh air, remember bad gas was. case interested actual data: [Daily State-by-State Testing me, seems states like New York New Jersey already reaped virus, something like 1,600 deaths per million. States like California Florida, hitting record case numbers almost every day, sitting around 160 deaths per million, suggesting they're heading towards peak first wave. [Here best  I've paid attention U.K. except what's showing chart.       
UK: 647 deaths per million. We're bad, real bad. evidence points towards reopening social gathering. ""Damn protestors"" either ignorant response someone trying scapegoat they're anti-BLM. Yeah, clear general public can't trusted even bare minimum wearing mask middle pandemic, we're running headlong another wave full lockdowns.

We can't afford scorched-earth response long run, people really giving local state governments choice here.

Which begs question: certain elements media start telling people ignore lockdown orders well? Don’t know raging pandemic? seen videos talking about, I'm honestly surprised point parents pushing back safety measures. point comment address problems online schooling relation parents working essential fields outside home. agree school districts fucking big time know good solution would be.

My mom teacher, want go back work safe. I'm trying make clear parents resisting online school selfish reasons words, people taking responsibility acting maturely. KEEP GOING! *cries Texan* new version seems multiply faster upper respiratory tract — nose, sinuses throat – would explain passes around easily, researchers said. tests 1,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients showed infected new version fare worse caught original strain.

Its potency original strain. doesn’t make sicker, doesn’t make LESA sick, spreads faster. That’s good thing. 6 months there’s 90% vaccine available, oxford saying they’re confident ready go september/october comments giving life. Yep, I'm trolling saying able back things claim. can't back proof, point out. Total troll. Yeah, said population didn’t matter

It doesn't, mention population comment? Deaths per million per capita measurement, e.g. 1,000 deaths per million 0.001 deaths per people compare Sweden neighbours?

Because similar cultures, climate, population density, demographics, health care systems. reaction measures taken completley disproportionate actual threat. 

I see *why* governments - figures given start huge.. millions predicted die, hospitals would collapse strain.

But pretty clear weeks case. 

The lockdowns ended 2 months ago. Thank you! it’s going destroy humanity people thought.

Wow, place set bar! can't take person seriously. Don’t mess Texas Every single day medical field completed experiment. Good! also cite people wearing properly. chin, nose. fair, US people per capita. Thats problem team docs facing right now. mean watch video see. linked youtube translate. hear see exact stuff saying. need 5 10K+ days take lead NY.

Come Florida, ""winners"" Fucking kooks... He’s 52? years gone? ""The overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate 4.6 per 100,000, highest rates persons 65 years older (13.8 per 100,000) 50-64 years (7.4 per 100,000).""

\-CDC

So Florida seeing 0.5 hospitalizations per day, right? purpose locking prevent hospitals overwhelmed. hospitals overwhelmed (my city's hospital actually furloughing doctors nurses see nearly number hospitalizations expected), need alarm sounding?? feel like would major major story hospitals struggling, seen stories anywhere making believe happening. 

Or maybe they're hoping alarmist approach scare people wearing masks. wear mask people. smallest thing could possibly especially allows things open up. 

It's also annoying Gov. Newsom telling can't see friends family 4th literally thousands people packing streets protest LA. stupid broken system. ""It cost much care kid, removed economy."" Way go Florida !! Typical Reddit. Wading topic don’t even elementary understanding what’s discussed. Thank DeSantis adamance. Exactly.  orange county (the county next LA county) health secretary resign due death threats mask policy. county abandoned mask mandate protests people refused wear mask. sheriff said wont enforce mask mandate believe quote “we mask police”

That's ... nuts. applied across US, number would ""only"" mean 10 million dead.

Did math all?

I check whether really dumb. actually said [""Over 95% people test positive aren’t going Okay. So, actually he's saying worse that, but, sheesh, implication. comments, ""80% deaths 65+"". guess sacrifice elderly get haircuts okay, we'll casually neglect health impacts permanently severe fatal.

These people denial actually advocating. want things back normal (who doesn't?) want people accept losses get there. want minimize risks, remind people probably highest risk category they'll go normal things, people greatest risk take all. healthcare professionals dealing impact selfish decisions. Sucks them.

What great political message. bottom line message people hear Rubio's comment worry less let problem get worse really big deal. Thanks Rubio. hope attitude come back bite anybody care about. great news! plenty idiots New Mexico wander around like virus exist, certainly need flood oblivious Texans Arizonans adding mix. difference lockdowns? taking random samples people estimating 6,000 cases? basically like polling presidency take sample size different methodology? feel like could go back time, skipped lockdowns used threat people refused wear masks.

And saying that, them, makes China sympathizer, eyes. Confirmed. 2, people don’t understand every little part daily life extra complicated. Hey, good you! lost 30 pounds years ago (birthday present myself), know hard lose keep off. 

I slid back bad habits virus hit, started turn around weeks ago. think exactly said: preparing battle. 

Let’s keep mindset stay healthy. Also shortages spots daycares. huge problem people circle. never said that. facts facts. Swedens deaths hospitalizations peaked April. 2.5 MONTHS ago.

They've consistently fallen nonstop since April peak.

The outbreak almost entirely Sweden. Can't get sick position viruses spread. Cant believe post gone long without anyone pointing fact die next day. There's zero percent chance man could eat. Y'all ignorant. know, honestly 80% people know took lifting quarantine orders green light start throwing birthday graduation parties. government, least am, clear consistent messaging (we would like wear masks, possible, etc). People don’t pay close attention news, large percentage Americans, didn’t know better. Well someone contact probable case also counted ACTUAL CASE. someone certain county endemic also 2 minor symptoms one major symptom listed “case” ANYONE come contact also listed CASE certain counties. feel Tiananmen square?

Tiananmen square central plaza Beijing.

There crimes humanity committed protests 1989, limited Tiananmen square. atrocities committed protestors parts Beijing well rest link article. 

Question you. even read article? real question is, ""expectations"" wrong?  

why tracking employment mystery? Oh ok worries then. buildup 8 seasons we'll knock problem away one episode. live US ... Russian misinformation machine keeps telling people wear masks, flu, hoax, economy important, real issue 5G, and/or vaccines dangerous. course rubes believe people keep dying faster faster. can't imagine much Putin must laughing this. He's going successfully kill million Americans using shitty internet memes. every moment doctor standing arguing back forth family another one can't help people better chance survival. money, take cousin nice steak dinner? takes 18.5 days average die this. That's saying ""2 weeks"" became popular from. takes 7 days report deaths. facts CDC website. Deaths keep falling. Wow! edited titles reposts. story already wonder hands tied there. He's certainly perfect guy, many Americans DESPERATE kind logical, level-headed leadership. fuck horseshit? Yes people hospice cannot eat get invasive surgeries procedures eat. locked room denied food ffs.

Is requirement people medical knowledge post subreddit? jhmfc. control control. always stupid people world kill friend party reached Macias say coronavirus, aware diagnosis attended gathering think could infect anyone symptoms, Lopez said.  understanding gentleman called said 'hey party, knew positive. tell anybody,'"" Lopez said. ""I think gentleman regretting telling everybody, calling people party recommend get tested."" seen country (except maybe Brazil) significant portion population blatantly refusing wear masks. saying complied, ones refusing wear masks knew they're breaking rules something bad. None claim wearing masks God's law. even ISIS. Think that. even fucking ISIS claimed God wearing masks. novel virus, it’s extremely important know animals act reservoirs. 

Like, would happen thought all-clear, really cats still infecting us? UK week we're running slightly normal death rate time year probably phenomenon.

I also put things like people travelling working less, less accidents things like would normally see us off. I’m seeing reported can’t say sure lack contact tracing. Logically speaking, wouldn’t make sense protests wouldn’t lead spike - matter fact, cases rising expected time protests. 

I hear people say “blah blah outside wearing masks” “protests aren’t causing rise cases”, that’s true, couldn’t congregate manner months? case, surely sporting events scores spectators wouldn’t issue? Surely could, idk, attend funeral? it’s case. protests politically convenient, that’s it. virus isn’t righteous; doesn’t know apt cause pointless one. politicians defend protests sudden switch say “we need social distance again” that’s said done, completely asinine. refuse listen it. truth, Trump first politicize masks. Don’t project here. Bars caused this. 

Source: work bar 😂 Hang weeks presumably situation improve. Sure, let's hold concert midst coronavirus outbreak indoor venue 2500 people, can’t wait get back this. 90s best. didn’t coronavirus, cell phones, computers.""

... President last person hurt economic shutdown. It’s poorest vulnerable among us hurt. People still think worst case scenario 200k deaths end August. Keep curve you, yeah right First thought: Vanilla Ice still alive?!

Second thought: Well, maybe long... Absolutely 100% responsible death. friend information beforehand. American, I'm sad hear totally understand. journalists chosen ask dumb questions. deaths hospitalizations approaching zero.

Poor Sweden! live TX times McD drive thru (2 diff locations) employees either wear masks wore incorrectly. family go McD pandemic over. DQ Chick fil hand, closed dining areas excellent protocol. don’t even know that.  new statistic deaths isn’t going move someone act successfully ignored impact 120,000 Americans killed 4 months.

Most humans well equipped alter beliefs light new evidence.  Even polling data suggests certain populations trust political leaders scientists doctors.  figures trust telling fake/a hoax/just flu/under control nearly half year now. 

 new fact, even believe it’s true, going smash belief stack half year making.

It’d take something Utterly shocking (to them), like member immediate family dying , anything, prompt change mind. report something happened someone else. care life, many not. argument created distract. states aren’t taking cautions kind? imagine. I've heard many friends (in case Swedish born) various aspects culture, esp. borg-like conformity wherein dissent socially punished. 

Well, fingers crossed changes! Good luck you! Sure, I'll reach 4-year-old solve problems. could possibly go wrong? post already... Still repost. Texas fucking embarrassment country right now. Absolutely fucking embarrassing. citizens way top. state collectively fucking rest us guess what? Texans way restricted crossing states.

Much love North. kid whose college paying this, I’d immediately cut tbh. understand time consistently moves forward? agree Sweden looks like states 6 weeks ago understand states record highs yesterday able put together Sweden path disaster. know kind analysis requires lot heavy lifting sure handle it.  False. right. seem like one people think “sorry” fix situation hate downer (in downer times) guys' thoughts Lol. Sweden done, rising numbers cases. 😂 herd immunity, rising numbers cases 😂 keep spreading lies, I’m done added 4.8 million jobs June Stimulus September people start dying. - Mitch McConnell probably actually first thought popped mind. Exponential growth means spread really slow explodes.  example, look takes get 1,000 cases 10 weeks, starting 1 case:

For 1,000 cases 10 weeks, 500 cases 9 weeks 250 cases 8 weeks.

the 500 cases 9th week double 1,000 10th.

Which people hard time kind exponential growth. stays really low just.... explodes.

Start 1 case:

1: 2

2: 4

3: 8

4: 16

5: 32

6: 64

7: 128

8: 256

9: 512

10: 1024

Notice first 7 weeks, get 1 case 128 cases. 3 weeks later 1,000.  Largely asymptomatic, minor symptoms sufficiently large group people, fatal significant population people. also lifelong complications survivors appear emerging COVID patients well. 

And forget things like post polio syndrome us young uninformed realize possibility. point is, COVID-19 flu, much closer something like Polio. public policy messaging perspective, saying ""this like flu"" vs ""this like Polio"" two different things. think data showing serious disease. Quick someone make comment death rate low.

While wait confirmed tests get worse, go hospital, suffer awhile, die, wait longer bureaucracy finally report it.

Sigh. Wear damn mask. Except that's true. hospitals canceled routine/elective care, people would felt confident going hospital something wrong. Instead pushed narrative virus dangerous thing earth farthest thing truth. Implying Dem leadership's words actually mean anything. Empty promises empty promises, matter color wear public. Behind closed doors take money, even actions would go policies.  Scientist already said expect baby boom. Actually fear pandemic dull numbers overall. understanding that, wearing mask, less likely inhale droplets infected way, could still get clothes, hands, face, etc still cause infection, though less likely.

You'd protect one prominent mode transmission, could still transmitted means. somebody else wore mask, would keep primary method spreading able work would protect people even more. feel like I’ve fear mongered gaslit. else could possibly explain position I’m in? wake up, read news, there’s ridiculous amount increases cases every day, hospitals running room, health science officials warning us future... turn phone see friends everyone know ignoring restrictions going bars, gym, parties... must know something don’t, right? mean possible many people blatantly ignoring warnings data? must news sources flawed, right? everyone else seriously stupid? feel like either I’m insane, everyone else around is, I’m sure is. actual fuck!?! No. employees officials integrity look like. resigned rather sacked. people die right away? disease catch die next week. Critical patients ventilators months passing away.

You know lag time surge cases deaths..you following covid trends months subreddit Italy, new york Wuhan....so acting way know educated this? serosuvey measured revalence April.

Within weeks Swedens deaths fall single digits zero.

It's over. Sweden won. What? No, track individual Where's money 4 teachers? State budgets fucked due COVID-19 federal government coming rescue think end may even disappointing ending game thrones  hope person knows 100% responsible friend’s death. absolutely information needed (everyone planet knows pandemic). There’s absolutely excuse. 99.4% survives.

It's 5% mortality rate moron, 0.5% Common Cold bio bomb?

What? common cold kill does

I care pro choice masks. wearing mask puts family danger everyone else around you. like saying pro choice allowing restaurant dose 5 100 dishes lethal dose arsenic. man trach, would need intubate. He's hospice care. feel like scary landlord time 6 month eviction moratoriums mortgage rent breaks. That's dangerous situation in. keep thinking thing. know pointless think way - can't change past, grateful saved going forward - friend's father died early May (we're Toronto) family still reeling. idea he'd survived gotten sick not, damn, hard wonder hits close home. I'm glad found hope comfort comments.

I think scary virus.

But also know brilliant minds actively looking solutions communication among medical staff researchers never open collaborative before.

I hope one day we'll see movie hidden heroes carrying torch. feels really redemptive good time period there's lot bad irredeemable things.

I hope stay safe friend. understand. beaches towns along coast NC SC. Simpletons take proof we're ""on right track"" Based info posted, recommendation fly you’re unwell it’s safe form public transportation. don’t fly unless want risk getting sick COVID. June? Germany, common knowledge March!

What doing, America? different types parties. Seriously-my siblings put mother sleep like dog. Catholic nursing home. Hypocrites. (disclaimer: mom might wanted option...it blew mind could decide drug death w/out medical reason) Wear mask ? That's crazy.

My wedding like $5k half alcohol reception, gorgeous family restaurant.

Yeah, money work would little bit extravagant but, opinion, house much important big extravagant wedding. They’re saying there’s need students sit apart other...I feel want pretty much back normal completely schools September, wonder well that’ll turn Literally yesterday conversation 9 year old fact ass itches time wipe shits. digging itchy ass day licking fingers dinner.

Horrific (body spray) think might time start considering forming pre committee investigate whether masks could recommended, makes feel good.

Edit /s really good news time feel USA opening fast friend party reached Macias say coronavirus, aware diagnosis attended gathering didn’t think could infect anyone symptoms, Lopez said. 

Wow, basically straight killed friend. Law allow it. start ignoring law requires, better ignoring laws want to. claim total deaths Europe (true) quite European countries higher death per capital rate USA (also true).

I seriously doubt USA deaths reach fear 250,000. current rate deaths per day USA 1000, trending downwards since start May. What, exactly, expecting would done, given lack formal power can't tell anyone do? goddamn selfish idiotic be?

One worst parts much faith fellow man eroded. gone. Jesus, somebody goddamn morons there. think post-COVID world might, extent, reverse pernicious concentration talent small number overpriced, congested cities— factor also damages politics, certain states disproportionate shares uneducated.

It's smart people want live Ohio. There's plenty natural beauty infrastructure, even B- C-list cities. (Harrisburg, PA, grew up, apparently hipster haven. 18, 2001, place people wanted get of.) problem that, job market pile shit everywhere— gone days could drive city connections, call CEOs hotel room, start new executive job next week— especially terrible outside super-expensive A-list cities.

I know plenty intelligent people grew ""jobless interior"" 30s 40s would love leave 57-minute commutes behind. problem jerbs. Now, COVID forces us adopt basic income people longer need jerbs survive, problem goes away. country get covid entire street gets free testing lol. Quarantine centers also free remorse fool... people need stop going things stay home! Putting others risk! ERs area ghost towns shut down. run commercials TV begging people seek care emergencies. Capacity issue. exactly American individualism bullshit. everything right - everything take care yourself, make sure ducks row - person exercising “liberty” disregard experts, government, common sense get killed. works too. opposite happening heard news decline pregnancies. Mostly people less horny worried primary needs like food, shelter safety. take seriously, live farm wear mask go supermarket every weeks. don’t wear one take kids local playgrounds, mostly empty, cause virus people live . People rural areas don’t interact many others daily basis .

The whole point everyone else’s comments dump rural residents whose viewpoints different theirs. Even “bad” states, rural areas still don’t lots cases, exceptions migrant farm workers prisons. cases locally county college lots college students going back out. 

Our local hospitals empty lots staff laid off, case March that’s still case.

I feel bad people northeast go really rough period, it’s going get bad here, ever, matter much hated on. Note America also lacking testing well. Especially heavily affected areas like New York  gatherings allowed less 25 people I’m NJ 6/25, reporting almost 1,900 new deaths day. NY ago 4/14, reporting 4,500 new deaths day.

Have seen anything attributes NY's last two days kind thing, assumption? China famous wet markets. well known.

My point aren’t selling vegetables fruit like someone claims. Yeah odd list. get FL CA, NC, SC, GA, TX, AZ? MI? MI much better states. According data looks like could weekend (141,075-122,960=18,115) Yep. same.

One advantage dealing guys online never expect know Swedish, fun get mess heads bit, many rebuttles switch back ""can even read this?"" ""stop reading trummpy's right-aligned propaganda stick Swedish sources.""

Most Swedish media profoundly biased, seem aware. read anyway, course, since read Swedish news keep date.

Edit: Auto mod deleted apparently filter political words. babby formed? People really need stop, collaborate listen Rona grabs ahold tightly. TBF love remote area think we've 34 cases past three months - one really seen issue. least understand ""felt need"" ... everyone else get Thank you!   know live, Florida, biggest grocery store chain Publix. average yearly salary 18,000$ there. Grocery stores Florida pay 15$ per hour. Maybe hired street department manager. Walmart Florida 12$ per hour. averages, mileage may vary. Ok spitballin’, disease would force people socialize constantly avoid alone head?

Maybe virus causes insanity without social stimulation? idea parents take terrific college debt work full time order standard living single high school graduate could past, shown dangerously unsustainable incredibly susceptible shocks unforseen circumstances. 

&amp;#x200B;

The 'both parents work' idea bad everyone except corporations, got suddenly double labor pool (and thus pay less wages). May odds ever favor sense China (and perhaps Europe) lot diplomats leave, early outbreaks, tables turned. Japan never big outbreak, Americans probably stayed. good question ask governments, whether American diplomats given free rein simply walk spread disease diplomatic cover. 

But yeah, also China, they're sick American shit. South Australia state ? 🤯🤯🤯 update us. prayers. may one also. thing makes angry took every precaution wore mask times public. everybody else? Nope. Fuck people think wearing mask big deal take “freedoms” shove it, potentially making others sick stupid “beliefs”. Texas btw. that's true.

But is. logic simple hospitals canceled routine/elective care

They lack shutdown many ill need cancel ER. efficient shutwodn would prevented would felt confident going hospital something wrong.

No feel confident go hospitals, full corona patients. Nobody feels ""confident"" expose virus kill you, bar pushed narrative virus dangerous thing earth farthest thing truth.

Who ""they""?

The virus is: dangerous people risk groups, exactly people die going hospital go. ""I'm exactly one people dies this, hospital high risk getting it, stay away.""

They acting rationally, comparing two dangers another. God damn I’m stupid. wear mask so.. I'd definitely say first wave never ended Michigan. got bar around 300 day now. may flattened bar, thanks opening state way early still thriving here. summer, golden opportunity businesses quickly adapt serve guests outside go only, get thing control winter. 

This way. know immune sequlae, right? getting sick may end significant heart lung damage affect many many years. 

And really kind shorty logic “I going take precautions getting sick”. Really? God Americans stupid. alternative? Promoting mask wearing time PPE short supply? imagine unavoidable discussion one side claiming ""They lied. promoted masks knowing short supply. dead healthcare workers patients!"" Florida entered chat Unfortunately, whatever lives saved US make number lost adequately suppressing covid. Brett, we're talking diseases. Given human overpopulation leading cause climate change environment destruction, people see good thing? 2 groups people - arguing kids, arguing fight climate change - 2 completely separate groups people? Florida awful, 28% awful (yet). positive rate new cases around 15% past days. slowly rising past weeks.

 [Source](http://ww11.doh.state.fl.us/comm/_partners/covid19_report_archive/state_reports_latest.pdf)  lol 5 people. 2 confirmed liars. details new set 3 fired.

Why assuming people's stories truthful first 2 complained press proven liars? Trump changes tone. Next up: sun rises. government absolutely allowed restrict rights deemed necessary public safety.

Having party getting shit faced important enough allow happen global health pandemic. Especially nobody going practicing social distancing mask wearing.

Protesting agaist systemic racism important enough allow global health pandemic, especially many people practicing social distancing mask wearing. 

Stop moron. mean... death chamber may bit strong it’s definitely dumb wear masks crowded places Yes you’re correct, I’m big believer education system failed America big way, mean obviously has. went education system too. you’re American, you. ignorant *is* individual choice, *after certain point*. either choose educate choose accrue worldly knowledge diverse experiences. choice learn fact check, it’s choice never read book high school, it’s choice try understand world around you. I’m blaming victims, I’m blaming victimizers. morons get sick, they’re gonna spread it, might spread people take precautions happened unlucky. believe autonomy body. you’re adult, nobody blame ignorant. Thanks! would like see facts figures equivalent ones DN article. 

BTW victory Sweden seem think is. actually makes Sweden look *worse* since know HCW shortage, smartest thing try suppress disease help preserve fragile health care infrastructure. coverup, stupidest coverup ever. case numbers continuing rise across risk cohorts, buy politicians extra days inaction, point coverup fails total avoidable catastrophe, thousands thousands extra deaths hospital admins totally complicit.

If hospitals covering they're concerned revenue, super dumb. Lying buys hospitals extra days able run elective surgeries, turn made weeks crisis force forgo elective surgeries.

It makes hospital administrators look like complete crap. leaves us overwhelming surge reports doctors saying they're working extra shifts they're running meds enough staff (staff getting sick, etc.) meanwhile hospital administrators pointing huge unprecedented pile ""beds"" might might might enough staff/equipment/meds actually hold sick patients.

In case, we'll know pretty soon. blocked phone bc got huge fight morning . sent articles antibody tests innacuratte got super defensive saying went outdoor restaurant street drink sidewalk thing getting plane Florida . hate ""that guy"", truly tragic failure happened multiple levels allow happen - messaging country, state, county, city, lack testing availability track trace, likely lack healthcare access, etc. apologize comes ""victim blaming"" way, mean rather point severity situation.

But really stuck said already begun feel bad, chalked complications diabetes.

Diabetes *significant* risk factor serious COVID-19 complications. man elevated risk bracket, doubly diabetes apparently severe enough felt complications regularly - know diabetics who's symptoms well controlled point would worried feeling ""complications"", likely healthcare access leadership needed keep control able to.

*Please*, elevated risk bracket - 60, diabetic, hypertensive, immunocomprimised, etc - take pandemic *doubly* seriously. dangerous young people, *brutal* already compromised syndromes. stupid something children relate - compared wearing mask slavery automatically gets thoughts dismissed adults.

Since agree slavery comparison must agree one following logic: wear mask nazi's gassed jews spreading disease people intentionally kill actually valid argument. open carry face covering? maybe need pay rent/mortgage? easier vaccinate bats? /s Sadly, think guns start turning hospitals that.  No, baby booms happen dont see long time....right couples seeing ever.  Alright, hindsight snob. Show us stocks bought preparation pandemic. scared u guys. significantly less testing now. actual rate cases Germany may way higher.  guarantee cringe kids like “Ok Bo0mEr” anyone tried tell friend party reached Macias say coronavirus, aware diagnosis attended gathering didn’t think could infect anyone symptoms, Lopez said.

This considered third degree murder. doesn’t win re-election, individual 1 longer immune prosecution. He’s got lot riding economy right now. eyes protests America finds politically satiable scapegoat. likely improvements treatment outside EU it’s them. have. ever heard hospice care? Apparently not. stop, idea talking about. I'm sure daycares able accommodate new schooling model without charging much working families can't afford it. certain number children per teacher part time attendee still takes full slot. daycare would make less previously, raise rates make difference, prioritize full time attendees. area shortage affordable childcare pandemic, doubt school age families would able find care.

The real solution universal childcare, never happen national level. could see states trying it, similar subsidized school summer programs run conjunction school districts. Well, people *want* lockdown.

They want chances survival depend dumbass neighbor likes get drunk home repairs.

So people aligned scientists here. Like climate change.

Our politicians not. aligned science people. aligned donors.

But also mistake someone thinks pandemic response something democratically decided. truly, genuinely, deeply care lockdowns upset people freedoms.

And similarly, mistake someone cares policies kill me.

This notion get consensus political action benefits conservat*ives. care impact policies quite frankly know burden concede ground never return favor. Eric Church legit well.

 grew disliking country since married girl grew moved back hometown. grown me. It’s mercurynews article it. inevitable unintended consequences years hysteria online privacy, opinion. fucking stupid title. Wait... went link maths. Deaths per 1 million population Europe lower USAs deaths per million...?

Also, simplistic say worst based lower death rates. Declining death rates likely due greater degree youth transmission. Older risk people far cautious... look infection demographics. vast majority new infections young people far less likely die. 

This partly good news shows extent people taking precautions... Sadly infection numbers US sky rocketing fast precautions become less less effective.

I remember trump said administration done good job keep deaths 100k. 

I horrible feeling time get vaccine, America lost 250,000+ Unless severe COPD fine wearing one day. 

The big issue general public wear N95 correctly would better surgical mask. ""Connecticut open again? better go vacation there!""

I'm taking one side other, offering views experts well empirical evidence seems agree events lead major spike. course, transmission due many members public, police force National Guard test positive, nothing lead sort superspreading event like people initially fearing, including scientists.

[Demonstrations don’t appear driving coronavirus surge Seattle area elsewhere, researchers evidence urban demonstrations reignited COVID-19 case growth three weeks following protest see increases coronavirus cases result demonstrations New York Doesn’t Look Like Demonstrations Causing COVID-19 events happened globally 60 countries around world, every single continent excluding Antarctica. substantial evidence demonstrations countries resulted spike cases either. would wager means also apply anti-lockdown demonstrations happened weeks prior - heard substantial evidence shows spike either.

It's important remember experts agree likelihood transmission outdoors low, especially masks. transmission seems occur due indoor events masks used social distancing practices ignored. spikes USA currently seeing seem coincide states reopening, especially evident keep mind much current spikes states many large scale demonstrations others, **did** open bars, gyms, churches, schools etc.

I sent article, silently thankful end buying plane tickets. parks open undoubtedly contributed spread coronavirus within state. 

Uh... maybe, maybe not. Correct I'm wrong, think Florida counting residents new cases. saying residents go parks anyone visits, gets infected leaves adding FL numbers. I'm aware sarcastic, new cases increasing, rate positive test results also increasing... new cases may continue rise even number people getting tested bunch articles saying Florida accurately counting deaths nursing homes especially. also lot articles show pneumonia related deaths exponentially higher Florida previous years. There's lot proof Florida undercounting Covid-19 deaths push reopening. 

This one articles pneumonia deaths: undercounting nursing home two many articles subject. There's one article Florida fired girl manipulating data Covid-19 positively. used run website Covid-19 infections deaths Florida. since posed accurate website infections deaths rates Florida people interested accurate data. true lot substandard masks floating around come China, lot mom pop small factories China saw profitable opportunity started produce cheap masks.

Just stick brand name masks fine, look KN95 certification sure brand name.

As Chinese products, cheap true, probably is. China produce top quality products, LOT brand name products made China, going dirt cheap. nothing overloaded hospitals; decision made legal guardian doctors due quality life concerns. 

Quit spreading false info. Also, hand sanitizer open flame play well. Ok I’ll answer. study find claiming something completely defies logic might little biased. 

Your entire argument based premise beach=bad 20k protest=totally fine. 

No one needs study show mass gathering spread virus. performing mental gymnastics help justify know wrong: mass gathering. might wokest cause, show study virus somehow understand defies logic small gathering spreads gathering larger many major sporting events. Oh it’s Free Bacon, site uses word Freedom push agenda. given rough approximation 1% fatality, every death looking 99 cases *10 days earlier* contracted illness.

So using r-naught project many new cases arose 100 cases 10 days one fatality's infection death.

That's many cases likely actually person died, based one fatality.


The math gets boog super fast. 7 day old account spewing racism idiocy. Good luck case, technically yes, would harming others. willing take odds, pertaining life, one? 

Your last point though - mean leaders fed state gov't enough, totally agree. read article today saying experiencing spike, nevertheless still first wave.

It never rains it? spread people show symptoms would point? farce show american people. completely ignores testing positive rates increasing well, important piece information well)

Another *very* important piece puzzle Covid deaths falling steadily past month continue downward trend.

The USA currently reporting *fewest* number daily Covid deaths since whole thing started dumb cunt, throw fuck wit country. terrible. many questions horrible consequences follow. July 4th, beaches already open Theme Parks re-opening, number going go up.

1. cover besides reducing number tests look bad?
2. Florida heading situation like New York 1 4 residents know someone gotten died?
3. visitors Florida catch Florida go spread back states?
4. spread gets worse ICUs end triage situation people could saved can't get access life saving treatment hospital capacity maxed due curve flattened shut down?
5. families may saved could gotten treatment hospitals sue hospitals prohibited somewhere?

I going ask Florida re-opened early, based number new positive cases answer obviously Yes. even worst case yet. Mexico, 50% tests came back positive Florida testing 70-100K day, number still plenty room go number tests capped. masks double napkin/ bib Corona parties look good Arizona compare states.

Graph Weekly % Positive Tests Weekly Testing Amount Arizona testing amount gone last 5 weeks, percentage positive tests finally stabilized 20% week. Arizona still testing enough, real amount cases even considerable higher.

Most cases around Phoenix area, take cases per county population rate consideration Santa Cruz Navajo/Apache reservations hit most. TeStInG That’s million dead Floridians btw  working residents bone they’re cheaper, too?  automatically removed referred coronavirus-related subreddit quarantined reddit admins, stated may contain misinformation hoax content.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  testing 15% positive missing ton cases, places control test around 1% positive. They're still open? Lol article discussing 1-2 week lag amount ignorance stupidity around saying something like truly amazing.

""GlORifIEd FlU"" killed flu annually months extreme never seen lockdown measures. amazing delusional right wing is. first day- difficulty breathing, coughing, and, day wore on, chills body aches. got pretty nasty next several days. It’s odd morning day drove visit grandma, went meditation class. deep breathing exercises felt absolutely normal. hit real fast me. N95? Strange hallmark metal support nose, making pretty uncomfortable wear wrong orientation. 

Cloth surgical masks, see day Virus viruses do. actually far fetched. Depending institution, generally takes employee quit, get removed. Termination easy. agree totally. also believe might closer 100k/daily now. Think cases/asymptomatics moving around will. Personally surprised thing turns itself. When, nobody knows. spreading fast bound make coding error proofreading tool can't work around. technically makes errors every time spreads person person. large enough error change behavior. time, going become less virulent encounter resistance. I'm definitely professional, viruses tend time. Can't imagine SARS-COV-2 follow trajectory moving forward. probably around years come, drastically manageable. You're* I'll never forgive Japanese! know didnt happen testing decreasing per trumps orders. Jurisdictions that

1) real lockdown case numbers dropped significantly

2) reopened measured, phased approach

have large able suppress spread virus. hand, jurisdictions never real lockdown reopened without adequeate measures place seeing resurgences. around day 7 exposure covid positive person started developing symptoms. Headaches, sore throat, minor muscle fatigue, still able light workouts. hoping cold. around day 10, shortness breath hit like brick get tired walking bathroom. That’s next. Crap flic mila mokovolich. zombies umbrella Corp. 

That’s Disney gonna do! Oregon? Feels like we’re handling better country know test doctor used? drew blood gave results next day Gj Florida, Trump would proud! /r/beetlejuicing Even 5% today's 10,000 cases 500 dead day. future deaths announced day. get mean Copying printing out. Yeah risk would quite stretch photoshop pictures, sure everyone good make look realistic, faking previous travel documents align date location etc. texts would easiest. feel really bad Floridians. 

Just curious. people die they’ve filled census ins. Census year still count? ...What? know EXACTLY countries better others. Countries listened science, wore masks, socially distanced took SERIOUSLY GREAT! 

Countries **moronic leadership** tried downplay it, call hoax ignore completely (UK, US, Italy, Sweden bunch 3rd world countries) terrible. U ! understand first. Numeracy America rare trait. Alabama too. Congrats achievement Florida! Good luck you. relevant username?

sigh. please cancel vacation plans,
folks. 
we better.  Name 2 diseases affect us regularly like covid doing. Go ahead. 125k deaths months. I'll wait. 

Otherwise, looks like right typically control diseases vaccines... Right?

My God, can't admit wrong. silly. Amazing every Western nation figured limited Ubi help people somehow mass unemployment mass business closures uniquely American problem! parties US.

I know that's popular thing say dominant parties benefit misinformation campaigns parties hurt misinformation campaigns.

Unfortunately, end result people party trying beat new daily talking points. forgot much better COVID gotten since then, PHEW GUYS WE'RE CLEAR! follows doesnt get enforced

This understand cases gone low consider young people (who spread) going regularly couple months already, people keep distance anymore hardly anybody wears mask (doesn't help prime minister says ""masks work, get fine wearing mask work, oh actually can't fine that"").

I wonder immigrant health better (compared UK, example) due socialistic economy (higher taxes, better state provision) real reason it.

Or maybe many old persuaded die home instead admitted, ""COVID infections"" ""COVID deaths"" numbers basically hidden ""natural death"". guess that's happens take Trump approach act like nothing wrong. governor actively suppressing reporting recently? fuck entire story would like join Team Vaccine win.  *our* will, corporations bought country. name start K death rate median age newly infected 35, whereas previously 65, there's higher survival rate. mean go back normal let everyone catch it. I'd like parents around longer, thanks.

There testing, they're also finding higher rate positives versus negatives testing making number higher. People gathering numbers wearing masks. Ok probably. Italy's pretty much done lol. governor mentally handicapped? cut cut Disney World slack Universal parks negligent. None even planned open first place.

This weird comment. Disney's getting coverage they're bigger newsworthy park. enjoyed ending. Please don’t hurt me. [Perhaps help see two EU put us collective misery please? Quietly (at least sub) Sweden reduced daily death toll background noise level. 3-4% normal daily deaths. They'll start (real) zero death days soon. They're something right. ...and accurate! Sure, problem, solution isn’t “well, open schools back minimal precautions even isn’t safe parents need childcare.” Everyone needs pitch willing little extra make work. unprecedented times, what’s best everyones health safety probably what’s easiest convenient.

We need actual training teachers, tech support families isn’t teacher. Teachers need willing put time summer learn better online teaching. Parents reach parents kids school try work ways watch other’s kids kind rotating schedule perhaps. Employers need flexible schedules allowing WFH possible.  kill profits way. Inconvenience? Death permanent injury vs minutes discomfort? don’t get it. Fine. stay home. Even better! Or, pull shirt face time go somewhere. I'm paying that. robbing robbing boss customers. terrible reporting... problem Texas run ICU space many hospitals. Failure prepare nation led grim decisions needing made. ramifications heartless federal state policies made politicians like Trump. Vote office! Exponential growth hoax!


^/s kane said never liked wearing mask wrestling, wwe eventually gave let go maskless wraith

Typo not, works pretty well. suprise though? America chosen profit people. know, thinking could game numbers. Exactly say, increase testing, instead self selecting, test random members population. test rate goes positive rate goes down. could even spin ""proactive"" ensure know exact spread disease. Meanwhile drive testing centers 14 hours lineups. see hell lot red southern US. really unfair statement. Florida Man prolongs pandemic another years. Yeah that’s fair, even putting side, Peru consistently confirming 200 deaths day (equivalent 2,000 USA) one talking it!!!  Well ain't stupidest crap seen today. Without even reading post further, gonna say bf's dad underlying issues he's stage life going Hooters hang drink beer every day Yale seems think we're 200k Put hold. Yeah, matter time starts burning retirement communities Florida, lot family BBQs probably trigger it. bout get self regulated real hard next 2 weeks going huge clusterfuck predicting 60% normal activity Atlantic. It’s like stock market days still percentage positive hospitalizations work from. numbers rely competent response pandemic. CDC estimated mortality rate ~0.4%. Indeed much higher Oh, Herman... silly pizza making sonofabitch. wore mask, instead trying inspire others go health experts warnings, bud. Case count relatively meaningless number indicate number tests administered correlate actual infections. hospitalizations deaths proportional actual number infections. Yeah... think it’s safe say regret moving Florida New England. social distance.

This really hard. happen better state.

Florida Texas. Wish fucks would go one degree global health economics I've responsible financial half modeling program design governmental population health interventions costing well 100m well dozens smaller programs health systems insurers. presume great deal.

You take people saying “I heard don’t work” face value. They’re (mostly) stupid. It’s convenient excuse. They’re getting “permission” leaders way.

They straight don’t want discomfort hassle weighed benefit minimal weighed risk infection (to themselves) minimal. people know refuse wear masks also refuse get vaccine comes don’t want Bill Gates microchipping them

For real  different Americans using Fahrenheit, pounds cups? cant take kids work jobs. sounds like people taking advantage working home. patient zero China start global pandemic, mean fifty thousand patients zeros neighborhood throwing BBQs? Huh... seems low, take look many teachers Ontario 'sunshine list'. found teachers high school (dozen years ago) they're making ~$106k CAD $78k far roaring back. spinning truth. Spoon feed us bullshit, please. Sounds like guy presidential potential. Yikes. Couldn’t help try derail, could you? 14 what, 50,000 total? More? needs educated. Gotta apple bottom jeans, boots fur, Corona lookin’ herrr, gots go, next thing know, shorty’s got *cough cough cough* Chill. I’m saying reporting inaccurate. I’m friends her, know tangentially line sight happened. defending party. Jfc. testing patients staff weekly well? Texas skilled nursing/assisted living facilities testing staff patients weekly basis months now, local hospitals. 

Did know 1 5 tests resulted false negative? testing weekly, protects susceptible COVID. safe check local grocery stores healthcare shopping hours! think you’re exaggerating bad buddy. 

Will continue drunk dumb shit. went couple weeks ago … stupidity put mom sisters family’s health jeopardy,” wrote. 


I'm going leave study, published late May BMJ Global Health, looked people households Beijing one person confirmed COVID-19. time, explains study co-author Raina MacIntyre, research already showing majority transmission virus happening inside households, China already culture mask wearing. ***The study found households everyone wearing face mask indoors precaution knew anyone lived sick, risk transmission cut household can't bring wear masks time, minimum anyone suspects exposed, everyone needs start wearing masks home moment on. definitely gonna need bigger boat... already production. work there's already plans place begin doses UK September. general public *is* stupid. 


First all, people fit tested, many people would wearing wrong size. 


Second, 90% people visibly wearing wrong. Nose sticking out, hanging around neck, facial hair (you MUST shave LEAST every day) common issues. make available public use incorrectly healthcare workers still wear literally fall pieces? 


Thirdly, highly doubt average person wearing correctly. can't even get people wash hands using bathroom- sure they're gonna seal check every time shape mask correctly. 



Finally, unclear benefits would be. Even healthcare, use someone known suspected COVID+ practitioner performing aerosol generating procedure. Otherwise, even healthcare we're using surgical masks. doubt many Americans going intubating random people giving nebulizer treatment. waste N95s? flatten curve! 
/s Deliberately testing immune system like driving without seat belt. taking risk prevent entirely. Let's say 99% infected people survive, still means 1 100 die. 1%? even survive mean lingering effects like weakened immune system damaged lungs. Agreed, think also encouraged states lock way NY NJ encouraged unified response. states stayed NY NJ's track they'd probably position right seeing spikes new shutdowns. 

What president says matters, even power certain issues lacking. Instead trying unify singled NY NJ - wanted basically shut us rest country - think divided people. NY NJ bad, yes, attitude shut us let everyone else live life normal, - 'see bad are? getting earliest given major metro region, us soon take measures.' recall ever saying anything like that. job expected perform job. Obviously assuming following normal correct guidelines (ie lunches breaks) work hours paid. According [this post Godzilla *quite* yet.

The Big G took 1,500,000 humans various rampages. date, Covid-19 deemed responsible 520,000

Give time. wonder white hat hacker posting real numbers Apache tribe also right Navajo getting information makes accurate FDOH? really trust FDOH much lol thought safe reopen everything without sort plans testing contact tracing help mitigate spread ?! behalf America fuck Florida. Acting like street hoe letting shit hang catching diseases. OOF husband Navy. He's allowed go work work. live also restricted essential house trips. Florida facing bankruptcy. state cannot survive without tourism. long ago, maybe EB Game Force (local) Anytime see comments like need remind children, cognitively impaired, non neurotypical people internet. course could idiots give benefit doubt. Guy must kind genius!  Same! thought like Disney..:then joined one groups. Shame country can't leave food delivered room, may actually safer bubble.. said, probably make sure actually leave given bad Florida right Question. wife get 15 min test 3 Friday July 3. symptoms cough, body aches soreness, shortness breath chest pain. fever. test positive procedures go home get better worse? Smallpox eradicated thanks gobal vaccine effort polio (for part). Flu charges figured vaccine class unfection like this. Unfortunately, say coronavirus family. 

Testing, masks, tracing essentially stopped covid 19 countries this. According models hitting peak around July 14th (assuming people following city/county mask mandates). know referencing NY anything, probably 10-12 days worst numbers  would treasure FloridaMan putting long hours overtime well. seams like testing sight everywhere also heard someone appointment get tested, go days later got letter saying tested positive never tested. thirty year-old bug research, vaccines, treatments, knowledge behind it, feel guilty it. least known better.

But, fact matter virus -new-, behaves unbelievably different ways, even different coronaviruses. Even gone in, given incubation period co-worker could already infected. co-worker could even infected another source, too, given asymptomatic wife, brought home you. way tell. virus simmer radar weeks comes surface, contagious asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic (show symptoms later), HUGE list symptoms. really impossible tell contagious anymore, they're pushing mask-wearing everyone.

It's anyone's fault. even way determine fault anymore. best make sure ride best can. Ventilators fine, early estimates way putting patients vents needed essentially killing them. 

PPE needs work sure. think entirely/mostly ""not taking problem seriously,"" though certain amount that. governor interested kissing GOP ass anything else -- anything Trump tells to. Secondly, state's entire fiscal policy based tourism, tourism stops long, Florida know collapse. Maybe needs happen anyway, maybe inevitable, biggest companies/employers/lobbyists/donors Florida much want happen, they're quite willing let little people die order keep Florida tax-free tourism-based. there’s baby boom, it’s going first time parents only. can’t imagine another kid right now, even wanted one. Florida's governor worthless bag useless human meat. Jesus Christ. wonder percent positive past three weeks. seems like must increasing rapid rate. around 50 percent, would make likely doubling time actually faster every 7 days? I'd like debate reframed. Schools need considered essential services akin grocery stores. point safely open 50% dining retail, schools *must* open. lack childcare resources parents urgent matter fact schools provide meals public health issue families. budgetary strain family reduce hours keep kids home feed rather send full day school massive anyone cannot work home.

I understand difficulty getting students, especially teens, wear masks distance, keeping schools closed economic public health threat far worse keeping restaurants closed. 

I think public health focus needs shift ""how reopen safely right now"" ""what need open schools August"". Tell people 4 weeks strict stay home would mean reopening normal schedule rather halfway measure meaning either distance combined distance/in person learning. 

Public health experts need come forcefully say ""by keeping drastic measures place limited amount time, able reduce spread enough shorten period necessary half measures."" Pressure needs applied state federal government support families sufficiently truly shut down. Give clear examples using European Asian counterparts. 

Public health far disease control epidemiology. includes built environment, social health wellness, I'm sure know. time experts asserted rather make suggestions recommendations. Waiting line real fun anyway. journey destination. Im afraid im age thst patience makes place like unenjoyable ever again. dont like spending tons money stand around day. Might well ride summer outside September able go indoors. 

Yes, summer Ontario lovely.

Summer Florida everyone retreats inside. Unless beach state park, air conditioning. come fall. 

Famous quote someone Florida air conditioning Devil owned Hell Florida, would rent Florida live Hell!"" 

People move large numbers home air conditioning thing.

I celebrated birthday doors late May -- late May already summer -- miserable far temperature humidity. something would normally ever done time year.

I really prep way spent day. cooler filled ice water. Sunscreen. Fan. Hat. Sunglasses. Clothing sunscreen put top wearing.

Spent whole day never needed pee (good thing restrooms closed) sweated water. Though evaporate. gets clothes makes stickier.

So coronavirus still big winter, let's see talk outdoor dining Ontario then. keys still open, close again? Mmmm “they want spikes!! Give spikes” that's one state?! They'll say population size different county I'm doubling every 1-2 days. NE Florida good run 😂  Remindme !3 weeks Goddammit hate here. No, could nuke Houston suppose.

And call nuclear test, probably make one particular American happy Also, wonder many tests antibodies vs. Active infections. info would provide important context positivity rate. sub pro Sino. problem that.

You guys pay attention gold prices rather geo political posturing. understand this. Netherlands death toll actually quite high, especially viewed per capita basis. They've also under-reporting infections, otherwise see something like 12% death rate. Seems fishy. Same.

My sister manufacturers disposable cameras. deemed essential.

Is less essential industry? edited it. Sorry. Thought threw live info link already. 1/2 Americans cannot afford bills miss paycheck. possible wave coronavirus hospitalizations followed equally large tsunami personal bankruptcy debt defaults. Things going nice next 18 months. Let's forget New York 'pulled parachute' declared state wide shutdown March 20 (2831 new cases day, 8528 total). Shutdown start March 22. start trending downward April 15 11,743 new cases 218,883. Waiting long yo act, dont know there's coming back that. Fauci said could putting 100k cases day, data, easy see likely is. 

Source-coronavirus.1point3acres.com remember Candy Crush? like that. bigger. much expensive. people addicts. Congratulations making today’s #1 idiotic comment. LA bit conundrum locked pretty early. suspect LAX hub LA port entry delivering goods western United States , probably lot COVID infections time thought still China 

As far what’s happening today, others mentioned (keep mind California huge state) cities conservative completely ignored mask wearing social distancing guidelines. family cities within hours LA haven’t changed behavior all. 

Additionally, I’m wary say may come racist, Trumper (believe me, I’m not, can’t stand guy people voted him) ...

That said, live San Diego work healthcare see everything. getting shit ton COVID cases Mexico. Tijuana completely overrun, 250,000 US citizens live area Mexico called Baja. citizens live Mexico it’s cheaper San Diego commute across border every day work. get sick healthcare pretty shitty unless you’re rich, come across border healthcare here. fact (this issue even COVID-19) bad cases take Mexican ambulance border, cross it, call 911 pick up

The southern cities bordering Mexico hot spots California. 

Again, I’m saying drum anti Mexican rhetoric say something stupid like close border (good luck getting agriculture construction done California without Mexicans dumb fucks) 

I’m saying objective fact lot California cases coming from. never really locked anything Baja seeing consequences. idea opening back literally never flattened curve here. slowed little worse ever had. 

One day hope leaders aren’t retarded. One day... Babysit. babysit. worry, US gonna pass Sweden soon miles. BC Canada like 10-20 cases day months ago universities decided fall courses would online. Sucks it’s right call. can’t even believe thought would good idea cram 10s thousand students together campus California. exactly Walter wanted Westworld, theme park true, lasting consequences. read wasn’t worth validating. wrong hit problem saying C word. Mel Brooks would like remind state Florida works joke. DeSantis failure leader, he's responding political pressure business sector. LA County situation. County president adamantly opposes lockdowns. literally stated local TV impose lockdown again, despite rising case numbers. 

And based budgetary concerns (with federal bailout sight), well outcries small business community depend in-person sales on-premises work. types businesses can't work home limited online presence. fact dichotomy Bay area SoCal apparent: SF could continued lockdowns weeks longer LA economy much white collar professional/IT-based. Likewise FL, much economy based tourism &amp; related industries simply continue stay home without causing massive economic collapse. Okay let clarify.... seasons (if any) COMPLETED 

No chance hell way spreading. chance. It’s sucks... way decade well, thanks! even mortality rate 1% 500 dead per day 2 weeks now. Yikes. Lol special kind dumb. obviously don’t critical thinking skills all. 500,000 deaths 6 months it’s rising exponentially. flu bad year may kill amount people 12 months WITHOUT LOCKDOWN... notice locked prevent spread thus meaning less deaths. also built makeshift hospitals increased production ventilations save lives. Math liberals would flood market real estate sitting on, bringing prices down. Plus older people work would either get sick finally retire, opening high paid positions. 

What if... covid answer...? Lol virus brutal human body.  many people know tattoos Busch Gardens Six Flags? Disney freaks different breed. school system needs stop getting defunded teachers actually teach exponential growth surprised. Y’all voted Desantis, tough tiddies. read link? basically says evidence intentionally mis-classified, conspiracy theory. Eye protection important, face masks even important. stop testing go away numbers make Trump look bad /s function exponential, independent variable, x, exponent, base. Polynomials independent variable base constants exponents. Love trying learn more/get clarification! point place discussion needed. People forced back work, agreed, cannonballing...that distinction obvious anyone brain, yet, are, throw two cents needed. also note lead states affected early on\* key remember, never saw curve rise first place flying blind provisions worked didnt. hey're paying price thinking ""we're New York"" called shit months ago. People stupid cook outs everyone know. Almost us get Covid 19 Get exercise understand 40 99.9% chance surviving.

If that's case, many people seem look United States like we're something wrong? would seem we'll reach herd immunity faster. put another way, want flatten curve manageable number... maybe want number super low like Europe get virus eventually? saying? 1,400? Get Florida’s level states countries got hit hard early better.

Meanwhile west south U.S., judiciously quarantined March virus almost presence, cases high.

Oh well. Yeah. realize fairly innocuous comment disney appeal primarily adults dragged kids (WAS OBVIOUSLY WRONG REALIZED) caused lot corrections people. thought it, closest analogy came mind Las Vegas strip buffet. Wife gambling people, whole Vegas strip felt absolutely artificial boring, kids. know die hard friends visit vegas least year. cruises guess. get cruise even free (even pre-pandemic days). Yeah public transportation also increases spread. What’s point? Might one dumbest whataboutism I’ve seen here. growth rate change, derivative/slope function, actual function itself.

As example, linear growth represented function 2x, said, growth 2 day. slope, growth, function would two new cases day. 2+2+2+2...

Whereas derivative, rate change, daily growth, f(x) =x^2, f'(x) = 2x, meaning doubling, numbers above. start 5 one day, 10 next, we'd 20 third day. growth 2•2•2•2•2....

In word, linear growth additive. Exponential growth multiplicative.

It's decade since studied calculus may wrong. didn’t get either went late 20s, drug boss, big fan, conference. it’s place want vacation I’m pretty deeply entrenched things Disney, it’s hard explain really. yes lot us childless millennials hoping Disney safely open back soon possible.   *that's* MAGA spelling bee like 11 since played Half-Life 2 knew word ""Benefactor"" final chapter title. live Texas??? Lol Yes!  eliminates guilt purchase.  National Parks much better cases going up, death rate actually going lower? make sense unless including common cold numbers think politics also playing out.

I reading Politico article talked Biden prepping debates assumption economy would booming.

It's artificial boom collapse dumpster fire risk Trm*p willing take. I’m alcoholic I’m drunk, alcoholics go meetings. I've noticed weird me. makes adults crazy company? feels like self worth tied it. grasping childhood? I've met people work get paid shit, work overtime, say work Disney. Made lol. Vince McMoron. Exponential growth Florida #1!!!

Go Gators! madness!

In Melbourne(Australia) 70 new cases yesterday we’ve closed impacted suburbs, placing police patrols borders idiots refuse contain virus. Nationally, one Victoria allowed leave state... adequate health care,

Do people understand get sick, chances they’re getting hospital bed??? warned months saw eyes would happen lock fuck HARD coronavirus!

Now pay price going hell. can't imagine terrible going fall try restart schools colleges. Yeah, kidding OP? definitely going people plans go Disney definitely go now, try prove point. they'll likely get sick infect others. professional seasons, guarantee it. College another matter. Interesting like said report, prospective trials needed examine impact. news, water wet. Florida things. Ignore pandemic go away! virus comes different sizes alot definitely go mask even cloth mask 100% fitted face. transmitted droplets aerosol (I.e sneezing, coughing). Aerosol virus stay air definitely inhale even wearing mask. one forgetting anything, stupid think virus transmitted droplets. said, mask stop spit going mouth still wear it. People please dont false sense security. Nope. literally figuratively f*cked. went back several times, gosh darn it, see anywhere used word ""people"". give hand identifying word ""people"" used?

Thanks! Six Flags Georgia open like month now. 

And they've already done racism. America numba wan 👏 see. Gotta get kiddos birthday parties school. go people $800 matters to. can't afford lawyers actually fight it. Meanwhile Wall Street banker probably skipping million taxes shit, guy afford lawyer. reflects cultural values resulting politics based values.

It reflects political values resulting culture based political values.

I thinks that's equally valid way looking it. Actually, dont use TikTok Zoom. buy made China TV toaster.  use chinese vaccine unless properly tested manufactured (by non CCP affiliated party). draw line ENDANGER life. wear mask go go unless to. NUMBER ONE!!! FINALLY AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. know two families postponed Disney trips indefinitely virus. don’t feel it’s safe, think they’re right. Disney still planning make people sign waiver? Bruh states? 

The user made sound like lot infected north bringing canada daily work. We're tired it, stayed home worn mask could've contained y'all little children everything. Pathetic. going much parks $125 except rides

Disney probably wants avoid typical massive crowds. Bahahahhaha that's get could stay rock goes away.

That won’t cause harm all.

That never plan. seen much debate, formula herd immunity fairly well known applies across multiple infectious diseases function natural transmissibility disease given population. Well, vaccine treatment research concurrent 3 years, hopefully one pans reduces death toll sooner 3 years now. That’s irrelevant. Bet idea probable cases counted. many dicks mom? 😂😂 kids old enough left home alone, old enough responsible work. time expectations them. expecting everyone know lakhs crore expect people able use Google understand Haha lol. hear you! I've grounded Southern California. friends, fun, lonely, isolated. thing y'know? husband go band practice, go pool hall, go see family. he's sick. wanting exploit K2 event, heaven' sake make sure genetically viable partner! 1 4? must watching different videos rest world access to. 5% people die likely. also see 85 dead, 160 dead, 250 dead every day 1-2 weeks now. !remindme 7 days risk, certainty. Since sister got school nobody family got anything worse cold. elementary school flu every year, plus random one-only things spared parents previous immunity. even caught stuff vaccinated for.

Children spitting touchy little idiots get possible illness existence. getting it, spread parents. Schools COVID nurseries get rid virus open, know that's happening. gOInG aWaY oWn. Penn state student full support classes going online again. would rather sub par academic experience risk life everyday go school. go Abington campus right outside Philly boot. don’t switch online I’ll scared attend class coming semester. 

It sucks knowing someone part Penn State family lost life this. May Rest Peace.

We Dude, hope pray guys happen.  definitely thought mild cases could totally wrong. think around day 5 exposure. awaken headache stopped up. Noticed morning smell taste. Tested positive day 6 quarantine state control last couple weeks, everyone Arizona Texas decided visit state wear masks. phase two postponed cases rise again. Yesterday first day double digit cases city week.  learned America individualistic country, meaning it’s individual’s well desires. Countries like Japan, Korea, Taiwan collectivistic. care community whole individual. really need go lockdown require masks everywhere. numbers, 60% chance mild life threatening symptoms acceptable risk level you. live alone, willing risk family’s lives well? Also, part range, you’re looking hospitalization stressing already overburdened hospital system putting front line healthcare workers risk - what? still selfish enough say “not problem, signed it”, maybe money speaks you? much think hospitalization going cost pocket? much trust health insurance provider fuck over?  N95s used cost fucking dollar. 

The reason we’re conversation president piece shit hasn’t enacted defense production act produce en masse. 

The market flooded safe, American made N95s, period. Well that's definitely gonna ever happen lol need sign carrier lined
with saluting troops. Maybe Trump land carrier. not. military experience. could see Trump somehow spinning millions deaths ""look open jobs i've created"" comments article disgrace. 

I work retail people laugh call idiot try start political debate, can't see 100% compliance. said, positive move help ensure Scotland continues supress virus.

Months late, Scotland, good move nonetheless. 🤔 body aches sign coronavirus? I’ve felt aching body upper body days. wonder that’s labor work coronavirus? biggest job growth ever president according Trump.

His supporters must proud great accomplishment. in!!!!

July 9th Florida shattered record 20,000 new covid cases! It’s common reporting hospitalized? thought mild case.  Corona.help see r/investing **love** fed intervention despite arguments ever made past actions. also seem believe prices 100% rational even fed propping failing companies, reddit seems simply overrun propaganda excuse actions blatant inaction US selfish manner. 

So many Americans simply sodomites per original definition. Overfed, lazy, absolutely careless anyone themselves. Yeah wr have. month in.  I’m pretty sure one offs. hospital released statement ease tension patients. It’s coincidence. I'm sorry science offends you. I’ve got many family members health issues. I’d keep distance indefinitely. Also, wouldn’t want associated life-threatening stupidity similar US, get get paid lot average expensive areas. Veteran teachers average $80k Seattle, maybe closer $45k rural Alabama. I'm guessing GTA vs backwoods Alberta.  Haunted Mansion get souls. Yah, joke everyone Florida going get it. That's good detective work journalist. US 1/4 global stats growing. insane... Stock markets soars positive outlook Florida flattens curve 10th day 10k cases!! know, sorry. Maybe someone else does. interesting. Oh gotcha, misread saying. Many elderly told diagnosis ""you probably make it"" instead dying home.

Interesting, source that? It’s even greed, it’s lack kind understanding long term consequences. decisions always proved expensive long run. Yes get reading correctly? Almost half icu die? people saying death rates low make sense tmc texas filled icus 100% telling half likely die? Thats absolutely crazy fact people talking baffles me. I'm doctor might sinuses, dad's buddy got virus put coma beginning lock down, said worst shivers life caused pain

He also really bad dry claims caused even pain lungs

As long symptoms fine Yup. live Florida, older demographics houses etc overwhelmingly vote politicians currently still pushing strategy.

Maybe consolation prize I'll able pick house significant discount. I'm finally close position buy, I'm waiting see happens next 6 months. There's nothing change course (other vote Nov late), might well figure best way take advantage situation. I'm going said, okay? 

The premise people can't use mask stupid, they're calling stupid. wear mask fine, think can't believe others tell can't made fool. 

If think mask substitute distance think others think well think lowly them. 

This two minute conversation broadcast people, people stupid. may care, stupid. 

You making huge deal something ten year old figure ""expert"" told peers dumb. aren't. someone tell Gottlieb treated sort coronavirus expert? I'm aware he's former FDA head sure qualifies speak particular infectious disease. says much every day every news outlet always something headline-grabbing like ""500,000 Americans diagnosed COVID daily"" ""we need send kids back school matter what"". You're* (the US) needs better, but, since aren't, hope treatment better enough reduce death rate. hear already things t(nasal oxygen!) explain much lower death rate past month. I'm hoping new drug works well act like. one state reported 10,000 new cases single day. New York recorded 12,847 new infections April 10
 
Bullshit. New York saw increases excess 10,000 half dozen times.  Hulu established media corporations' response market share demolished Netflix. Several companies went together including Disney Fox.

Disney commit service years Hulu came scene. Ummm 10k day I'm taking little comfort behavior stock market considering entered recession February got rocked 'Rona. seen Florida’s newest single day number? 10,000. victory! Prime day basically glorified garage sale anyway. lot people making really valid points. Obviously big point we've learned treat sick patients better Florida benefiting that. also think environment FL different NY. think large amount cases NY focused NYC cases increased fewer hospitals go causing hospitals overflow, lead picking choosing patients treat. Florida cases increasing throughout entire state one concentrated area, therefore hospitals overflowed... yet.

No sources here, speculation. Take leave see fit. idea talking nerve claim someone else anti-science. 

Wear damn mask. care you, care innocent people infect complete asshole. Guess what... another way saying "" test, trace isolate"" ""slow spread""

If virus Sweden says do, nations essentially forced persue ""herd immunity"" strategy like Sweden. words, they'll worse Sweden is.

BUT

If go way... treatments become better, vaccine arrives, nations see far fewer deaths Sweden. apologies needed, stated facts 😂  love he's blaming younger folks Karen family arsed wear mask went Applebee's 80th time week. **One case turn pandemic** everyone practicing proper social distancing, washing hands, etc.

It happened start one knew better. everyone knows better.   going say - 80% people community wear masks every single time indoors, less 6 feet away someone household, cover nose mouth... COVID-19 ends weeks later. everything life possible within restrictions? Working, getting take-out, school, etc? keep going. 

I know masks excellent effective, I've heard claim like this, non- medical grade masks alone without social distancing ends Covid-19. Masks help dramatically, wear them, necessarily enough we've seen outbreaks facilities masking. Medical experts seem think going take masks address major outbreaks still. ""Just wear mask, everything else normally"" cut maybe transmission rates also down. countries gone back normalish used measures too. Totally know coming decided soft though. We're clearly telling everybody we're still social distancing foreseeable future attending anything outside necessary trips public spaces.

I'm blown away people would even issue point care anymore whether take offense pass judgement.

Edit: feel like crowd wants play safe coronavirus feels awkward telling people problem things like attending parties invited events. ones ashamed they're still things middle pandemic going hurt people, us safe lowering risk. Found science denier. Currently hospitalizations 20% higher previous 7 day record 325 people. call shattering. Deaths currently 20% previous record Bromhexine trial: holy fucking shit, floridians fucking stupid? Jesus fucking christ. 14 turns

""Wait... That's illegal!"" -DM article says 15% positive, another said yesterday 15% today 14.6%. got past testing numbers [John can’t find today’s numbers dashboard, link? We’re trying move city staying Bay Area, we’ll see works out-everything entire Bay Area really expensive unless go really bad school districts, mean really bad. Less young people vote fact really, certainly lol

But someone young, don’t mean 25 year old president, 40’s 50’s whos little wiser rather old tired would fresh them, it’s shame would think Obama would handled differently Trump.  governor failed them. Wait - couple Gs get sniffles week?

You must value couple thousand bucks me. Careful speaking truth, many idiots discord flocking site downvote left job hostess due complete lack safety compliance. anyone wear masks compelled keep jobs. hugging regular customers well conversations within like 2 feet stringent sanitation thing. left 30 minutes close. That's it. additional cleaning typical closing stuff. kicker place mostly serves old middle aged folks. people nearly demand everything before. I'd get mocked looked like insane customers expressed desire keep distance me. learned hostess replacing COVID started looking something else found go back.

Edit: yes sanitize menus every guest. anyone else say. Hate guy I'm glad getting drug. life death you. zoomer defenders admirable, excuses known already. behavior goes beyond that. They, large, really give fuck. “normally expected” take account quarantine? Example- substantially lower car accident deaths, maybe higher cardiac arrest deaths (people don’t get stents put in, afraid hospitals etc) can't believe reside state. sincerely embarrassing multiple levels...... Arizona far less people Italy. Stories government failing provide basic needs citizens dont make feel good COVID-19 causes heart problems. even directly cause them, caused deaths people couldn't/didn't get lifesaving care it. 

So I'll ask again, actually say extra deaths int last 4 months would happened coronavirus existed? can't, right? teasing comment said ""morbity"" it?

I’m convinced certain directors (and scientists going back forever) placed earth move us along get us comfortable new concepts coming (cuz stupid figure things out). Like JJ Abrams over-fascination string theory parallel universes. entertainment prepped? Yeah, welcome 2020. gosh, getting voted too?

lol absolutely ridiculous, I'm surprised narrow minded people are.

I literally Chinese (Canadian tho) living East Asia (Korea) 12 years indeed verify, looking someone face face implies level equality cultural norm. look eyes executive team meeting example. 

If go board room, see CEO give speech, everyone jotting stuff notebooks. people looking eyes would 2-3 western executives native Koreans careful avoid eye contact. cultural norm. 

The writing part acceptable excuse make eye contact. There's way people need help remembering ""We customer focused make sure attract Gen Z customers."" people feel intrinsically uncomfortable eye contact beyond friendly peers. Maybe 5 years stop wearing masks, virus spreads quickly testing isn’t adequate lot false negatives. list symptoms keeps getting longer. reverse too. Photo driver mask? Free ride ones going really remember times happens. Found new statement replace hell

Thank states still report.

It definitely break 50K mark end day, unfortunately. real reason save bars, state allow bars put donation boxes curbside bars receive donations really want save bars without ulterior motives. Apparently, [Portland Maine correcting said breathing air hours. whatever bathrooms people using... presumably bars restaurants mentioned? Sweet! Sounds like found decontamination chamber!! Way go Georgia. Keep numbers Governor. Deaths hands let people suffer governments wrong doing? know, that's excellent question. googled recently far tell same. figure comes personal data roll() function python pandas library. maybe said rolling average?

If think might difference, please let know. one term preferred. I'm stats nerd. everyone plane wearing basic cloth coverings/masks, one person removes reason, expose whole plane since basic coverings people wear prevent getting infected? seems impossible ensure safe air travel moment there's way every single person keep mask duration flight. think can’t comprehend chose comprehend see, would start caring dozen people know infected/have died it, could wrong though. Finkel Einhorn. Laces out. Dan Marino. respect that. 

Vikings here. feel badly grocery store workers, this. I’ve ten hours day since March PA...it’s point don’t even notice anymore. fact lung capacity gotten much better since started wearing masks regularly. thing people don’t put long enough even get used it.  mean, different guiding philosophy, doesn’t change fact isn’t individual responsibility community spread pandemic. Every action make completely unintended consequences line people didn’t take chances. things base decisions societal effects, individual responsibility. 

Any decision, individual responsibility. pandemic. There’s isn’t thing pandemic. don’t know got downvoted. potential chokepoint coronavirus spread could bathrooms. I'm sure frequently typical socialite goes restroom outdoor party, may significant contributor, could worth considering? funny sub frothing mouth bad death news keeps happening. WAAAAAIIIIT TWO WEEEEEEKS juke stats assign death something else... ""Georgia reopened cases stayed flat! Reopen America let's get back work"" talking point month ago. Remember people start getting quarantine fatigue September- 2 months enough lockdown dont testing contact tracing place.  Get Dr. Oz it, he's one they'll believe. /s 80% people go hospital heart attacks arent actually heart issues. concerned want play safe. going think might heart attack results actually one. one wants go hospital right unless sure emergency bad strategy heart disease. What's crazy expecting people use never claimed policy would fix problems. One policy typically address situations. knuckle-dragging neanderthals likely never purchased mask, present high risk getting violent excessively belligerent, therefore let car.

There still people get mask try take off, people probably going less problem average refuse wear mask public first place. would still recommend Uber drivers dash cam gun try de-escalate situations. hits 100%, stop testing. Start half gallons now, soon knocking double gallons easy. first number understanding ratio infections occur infected even require hospitalization.

They think perhaps ~2% even need hospital care. means 98% aren’t even subject Chinese paper.

We know sure millions infected.

We know sure majority still alive 30 days.

We know sure massive numbers impacted patients still suffering we’d never hear end media. yet show rare one-off cases.

It seems small enough fraction people aren’t digging seriously. economy stock market mutually exclusive. amount money actions taken fed prop stock market buy corporate debt would fuck people's sense reality. Unlimited quantitative easing money printer goes brrrrr. paying debt foreseeable future. 

Here's article 3 weeks ago much money pumped numbers still cooked regardless. supposed start college USF August. Seeing state university handling seriously considering deferring 2021, withdrawing applying somewhere else completely. live Norway, clearly don’t understand insurance medical billing US works. charge million dollars test, doesn’t mean anything. get paid set rate insurer. Or, they’ll go government testing site, everywhere, don’t even need insurance there. read headline made incorrect statement due lack understanding billing US works. Tom Hanks? actually, death rate around 5% *in general*. much higher (also deaths lag behind cases two three weeks) 
i mean ffs, 10 million confirmed cases worldwide **500 thousand deaths**. half infected recovered. Dambed bloody right! age fair game virus. There’s turning back this. US lead charge cases unfortunately, deaths. plenty states payed due elective surgery. problem can't force go another state. throw enough money though many go like New York . PHEW, testing guys! get tested, there's COVID! Results in! OUT, NA'AM SAYIN'!!!! LOLOLOL post 3 months ago, prediction even? florida ""caught NYC timeline."" currently 1/3 cases 1/10 deaths per capita new york state, let alone new york city. numbers even continued slow made absurd claim, people's behavior changed throughout june, ie mass protests everywhere almost daily. formally suggesting National Anthem changed Astronomia Vicetone &amp; Tony Igy. wish killed people faster. assholes holding entire country hostage.  president protecting rights instance referring, meant time completely work. (That singular point) whole plethora incentives families procreation Sweden far beyond paid family leave. research wrote paper America’s childcare system college Child psychology class. Case count meaningless combined # tests performed. Regardless, hospitalizations shattered previous record sounds like ""infections way up"" camp based comment. Moore’s law alive Seriously! Go either Harry Potter areas tell empty is. Correct. even roughly third NYC infected according antibodies studies.

If Florida reached 100k cases per day, would confirmed cases per 100k NYC 5 days (2500/100k). Assuming similar detection rate (less 10%), 100k confirmed cases per day would literally 5% state's population per day. Lol might thing going on. people really wanna hear two songs Still better 15%... 😉 hard hide 10 thousand also hard hide 100s thousands. I'm going say - 80% people community wear masks every single time indoors, less 6 feet away someone household, cover nose mouth... COVID-19 ends weeks later. everything life possible within restrictions? Working, getting take-out, school, etc? keep going. 

We could save economy, save people. Japan back business-as-usual right now, less 1000 deaths. need learn example. 

It take change culture, obviously - ocean blood. enough suffering happened majority shaken preconceptions, answer there, so, *so* easy. soon us realize - nightmare end. 

We get there. way through. Florida go extinct ""Where water go?"" *Reported* cases deaths per million. go statistic, Florida worse almost 200 countries, including many poorest ones like Afghanistan/etc. Given known concerns reporting accuracy Florida, bet figures directly comparable Western Europe. say perfectly acceptable, I'd appreciate putting words mouth. think least bad choice possible, given need keep healthcare workers healthy face expanding poorly understood pandemic. Oh. Oh no. Well, examples world. Officials coordinate public health response, guidance disseminated help politicians, media educators, spend weeks locked virus dies.

Instead idiots Trump casting doubt every thing *know* works, favor vacuous probability calculations ""gotcha"" moments.

No matter what, going asshole saying ""we can't anything"". person. always better, even though already enabled explosive exponential growth virus.  Yeah guess happened month ago? bunch protesters decided going burning cities trashing buildings important social distancing. sure keep fueling narrative fear mongering plan-demic. Herman Cain attends rally 6/20, starts feeling symptoms 6/2?, gets tested 6/2?, receives test results 6/29, admitted hospital 7/1.

I imagine hearing guests results soon Yeah story smells fishy. Florida end placing butts seats. don’t care all. Well according multiple sources (news articles, social media medical professionals state, etc. ) Florida doctoring numbers, hard


People straight fired refusing repeat falsified reports cousin lives Florida asking Facebook would gatherings fireworks could go. Florida doomed. Coronaviruses new. COVID 19 *is* new, family viruses us millennia. Much effort put creating vaccines coronvirus, nothing particularly effective.

At best, we'll get vaccine slows spread. seems like hard time accepting truth, understandable. we'll get time.  culture warped idea personal freedom privilege earned shared responsibility public ideology entitlement self-centered. me, me. Screw everybody else.

There's whole group people label &lt;censored really mean is, want whatever want much possible. used work idiot would argue personal right drive drunk without seat belt, completely disregarding effect could others.

There's lot people completely lose mind feel like told something, they've grown bubble thinking free behave want completely ignoring cooperation, rule law restricting freedoms exactly created environment live safely comfortably in.  Oh man. Stay safe friend. risk anybody get stay home body fights off, making terminal vector disease spread... ignorant.

I need continue conversation can't argue someone like you. Say want high peak, least strategy seems effective enough bringing deaths time. acted time, I'm confident Sweden could've numbers comparative neighbors without changing strategy. Right, would explain would bad first would home stretch, *like developed countries*. mandatory certain counties think people use term ""herd immunity"" vague understanding happens almost hard data would take US reach threshold C19. people know coming NYC last week so, airline/staff didnt mention quarantine, anyone take name/where would staying order exit airport. friends quarantining cuz right thing, stands wanted asshats could. 

Even enforcing it, police randomly stop persons place staying 2 weeks, think better option person quarantines 2 days, state worker comes test, quarantines results in. think would keep many people breaking self quarantine, would waste less resources. know thats wishful thinking. see overall health biggest problem. health issues caused COVID-19. Stress, hunger, abuse, mental health, etc.

Prolonged exposure create crisis big current pandemic.  it’s insanely reckless irresponsible, simply make profit.

Wow hopeful. bunker looks lot like malice. basing what? Well look bright side, real estate might start getting cheaper FL So..they shitface people, too? aware won’t see deaths weeks explosion least week two? chart referring merely showing eye storm. asleep last 3.5 years? Next up, Arizona. Same. I’m fortunate enough self employed business hasn’t really affected Pandemic. Everything Americans acting make happy don’t need outside around make money. Contactless deliveries definitely amazing. agree basically people turned autonomy ideology. Ironic since lot told yet take cues guy office. comes wanting know facts masticated momma bird. It’s dangerous time live people actively choosing shun facts science. 

And HARD TIME. that’s still doesn’t mean people absolve the,selves personal responsibility it’s exhausting! Goddamn right it’s exhausting. bet would less pulled together team. Lol Seems like it, wonder long AZ rate. I'm bigger asshole you, wish way tell someone acquired disease negligence/ignorance could deny healthcare.

I work healthcare, one needs worried crazy doctor wants kill people somewhere. Haha. Yes affect oxygen levels. Remember stop drink water. doesn’t. going 60 mph towards brick wall. It’s pointless hit brakes. 

That’s pretty stupid argument huh? IFR 50 really low. want know got that. including everyone 50, includes children. accurate assessment IFR somebody 20s 30s. I’m guessing it’s breath knocked back onto 19 year old male hormonal face. Hey it’s better getting big rona tho would benefit cooling outgoing materials? waste. LOL touché Obviously need stop testing much get handle thing. Cuomo's insane policy forcing nursing homes take coronavirus patients. 

&amp;#x200B;

Coronavirus uniform mortality rate. many orders magnitude likely kill elderly people. Someone nursing home catching coronavirus like bomb going off.  


I think NY majority deaths nursing homes (which course tiny portion population).  


If keep coronavirus getting nursing homes/assisted care facilities, much lower body count. rumors. cancer deaths, case testing involves testing antibodies return positive antibodies viruses family, covid-19. means cold past, likely return test positive. counting multiple tests person new case. systems place track tested what, log positive antibody test new corona case. majorly inflated. Smart people choosing babies economy shit. Dumb people hand may breeding like rabbits since cannot understand concept affording kids. put bubble around America please? rate boarders Americans remain closed years. impact precious markets. overprotection better protection. That’s gf got while, made logical sense masks would work dEeP sTaTe cOuP hArM aMeRiCa'S eConOmY! require it, hard part actually enforcing wonder rally attendees would even get tested unless hospitalized. wonder would even speak contact tracers. wonder would admit rally. know could stopped charging mortgages, rent, loans put every business deep freeze over.

As well could given whole population stipend basic goods needed kept economy deep freeze. 

Instead decided keep charging stuff, wonder people social distancing. Surprise surprise. GoVs

Hey bro maybe criticize one governor’s actions without needing bring governors?

Maybe stop politicizing recognize tragedy Coronavirus live plastic right, stupid. I've stopped trying make sense anything happens country. also Russian agent Whitehouse. yeah weapons make feel manly again. Try different material/fabric? might one material components allergic to. dead aren’t counted???  Teach expunge kool aid blood. Umm yea spent 20+ years working there. Remind many rides Epcot? Studios? Remember can’t park hop parades fireworks. Hey type person wants pay $125 ride Test Track 60 times watch Canada movie 100 times go it. objections that. means attenuated virus cell. vaccine actually messenger RNA, new experimental method tried before. body injected instructions make specific part virus immune system attacks later. believe Covid, part spike protein. yesterday 😂 started cases around time US states did. light that, concede they’ve outperformed US states terms deaths per 1 million? Oh must responded wrong line. apologies! hope wife fine. positive, need ride home, away others. really well Santa Fe, opened back tourism. testing herd immunity theory fair, that's also normal Florida license plates summer, anyway.

Snowbirds plague tax evaders Even optimistic death rates, means 100's thousands Americans going die disease. Honestly, think federal government strategy now: herd immunity. want tell us people panic affect election. bright side, ample rooms available seniors residences, many Florida condos, lots used low mileage Ford Crown Victorias available 2021.  Wow. normal timing early upcoming academic year? that's normal, end around April/early May, get mire breaks peppered throughout year? Philly traditional schedule September (day Labour Day) till sometime 15 &amp; 30 June (depending snow days). beginning summer want stuck city lockdown Yeah, correct I’m thinking straight, red blood cells don’t DNA wouldn’t able upregulate genes responsible filopodia formation. Structural requirements aside, would possible SARS-CoV-2 genome encoded proteins promote filopodia formation, right? certainly cases younger people dying without preexisting conditions, although rare. Density. NYC hit hard, first. one knew respond PPE either. least medical professionals know respond treat covid patients little better. course federal government wasted time banked... things spiraling control again. certainly undermined statement. protesters acting like idiots wonder covid19 now? Going school anything like that? 10k..? When?

Did open article? first line article, `Florida shattered records Thursday reported 10,000 new coronavirus cases`, Thursday (today) would happened.

Also covimetrics shows 10k cases today, getting downvoted asking easily answered questions, sure surprised.  Muh freedom die spread disease 🇺🇸 special characters backslash: \

   niece lives South Florida. month two ago like 500 new cases day, camped apartment family, dare go supermarket buy food, let anybody in, etc. 10,000 new cases day, posts pictures family beach, restaurant, baby showers, etc.  people follow whatever crowd doing, ignoring reality. 15$/Hr stay home parents?

&amp;#x200B;

yeah....didn't think evidence protests lead spike COVID-19 cases. rename biological classification Dumpsteruis Fireius. Desantis really loves fucking Floridians over, he? know makes sense. supposed gone televangelist whooshed away 'breath God'? can’t educate people Facebook, doesn’t work like Really? 90% huh? Where'd pull percentage? How'd calculate one? feel way. Hello Texas! deemed profitable let people die, $$$ motivation try control it. American way buy 3 weeks supplies go full quarantine initial contact, good. using global number.

In US estimated 24,000-62,000 deaths 2019-2020 flu season.

You skewing numbers drastically downplay serious pandemic is. approaching 130,000 dead US 4 months, 1 year. GOP absolutely ridiculous. cannot believe can’t even get page pandemic. Lives literally stake. better control outbreak, lives saved, sooner economy safer get back normal. We’ve seen work countries. wrong GOP?!? mean tell *waves spread move????* dont think political. Probably DoD give internal pressures. lot new recruits travel SC/NC (Marine Corps/Army) GA/TX (Army/Navy/and AF). longer keep putting things worse things get future. mean, town pray virus gay away. /S don’t think live someone say, hey let’s pool childcare resources. Let’s get together figure collective work demands see create schedule sacrifice small amount, instead family sacrifice everything. take week, take week, next parent takes week, etc. grew time didn’t go daycare centers, went neighbors. relationships would need built, alternatives seem lot worse putting building support system. people agree Ronny boy's decisions think thing way overblown. work popular restaurant near Southwest Florida. staff required wear masks, pulled completely everywhere besides dining areas, basically get trouble. maybe 2 employees actually following little guidelines have. customers? Lmao, ooooh man. get told daily basis stupid whole mask thing is. People, especially older folks, love spread whatever dumbass philosophy almost seem get mad say anything besides ""we're required wear it."" 

Fridays Saturdays still absolutely packed brim people, social distancing goes window. masks anywhere, people coughing sneezing like normal. overheard lady joking gm husband came getting tested drinks... Read again. gm anything it, like kick considering 2 people working day immuno compromised? Nope. immuno compromised people walking quitting? Nope.

This state fucked Fuck yes. it! winning! Make America great florida! Thanks educating us fucked are. Much appreciated helpful. Face folks doomed morons charge.

Like America one great big Jonestown govt serving huge vats purple kool-aid. Wish could exit circus insanity trapped like everyone else. even care he's backpedaling saying right thing now. I'm happy he's saying it. Maybe followers right thing start wearing masks public rather wasting time energy fighting it. absolve damage previous stance caused. least hope saying might change minds lemmings follow him. That's was. widely known months months ago could spread asymptomatically. came said 'very rare' immediately walked back got backlash medical community say 'we actually know rare common is.' 

The CDC mask guidelines forgivable, research actually done yet, trying conserve resources medical staff. still rubs wrong way going way tell people wear masks unknown effective weren't, especially turned masks effective. Yes, sensible Canada. people wont wear mask ""rights"". agree media tends hype things case needed bc people taking BASIC precautions like wearing masks house parties. point exponential growth cases, starts affecting older population could quickly become dire situation. Miami-Dade County alone 2,400 cases yesterday. entire state Ontaria single digits right? forget cops! 50% municipal budgets places, instead going education (oh better educated populous confront virus with!), healthcare infrastructure, social programs that'd help poor struggling weather crisis! shit I'm right-to-die supporter. things get point extraordinary efforts maintain ""life"" misery, way say ""no"" DNR dying person can't take nutrition otherwise die slowly much comfort hospice legally provide- slowly discomfort, possibly illness well.

I’ve cancelled trip Disneyland Disneyworld year effort stay safe, maybe next year things better I’ll go back :)  mention many got sick hospitalized course. get covid, sit two weeks, play again. sure issue is. 10 people can't play ball court Walmart open? low hanging fruit, like shutting bars. nothing curb covid end seen trend less elderly/comorbid people getting sick greater rise young healthy people go home? engraved people's head ""hoax."" Took two uncles sick sister finally believe it. Mother must proud 😆 go outside Macias got tested June 15, got positive result June 18 died June 21. Riverside County Office Vital Records confirmed died coronavirus. province Ontario record 640 new cases back late April thought pretty high number. We're 150-range days capital allowed patio dining hair cuts last week. 2/3 Florida's population. thought us ~6600 cases single day incomprehensible. WTF Florida? need lie it. Say homemade cloth covering need it’s essential wear one. Done

By way nothing Fauci. He’s expert respect trying best provide normalcy idiocy ruling country. still part Trump administration don’t fully suspend disbelief hear (sadly) Many employees (having one myself) college aged well past. Including many elderly Thanks clarification! many years since last studied stuff! Yet deaths aren’t really increasing last two months. Ggwp still considered okay make fun someone's intelligence, including suggesting mentally challenged, long say r-word. So, moron, imbecile, idiot, etc., still fine. According current Merriam-Webster definition, ""intellectual disability"" preferred non-offensive term replacing now-offensive term ""mental retardation,"" would also perfectly inoffensive logic ask person intellectual disability rather ask, ""one can't retarded, right?"" Oh won’t able leave. He’s essentially getting treated like NBA exclusive staff. imagine there’s going security everywhere best preventing players staff leaving. that’s 7 days. arena rehearsals start season starts July 31, allowed anywhere Disney bubble. can’t leave bubble. Weird, movie-like stuff. Kinda reminds old UK show PRISONER. they’re testing more? Deaths hospitalizations going that’s thing matters. hell cares cases? forget astroturfed. initial wave paid people behalf GOP. Never forget that. Yep completely thrown idea hitting regular milestones. milestones anymore, things happen happen. find things tend click together sudden gets it. comment saved months Median type average actually correct.
2. Unless distribution highly skewed (unlikely stupidity) mean median close anyway.
3. speaking colloquially. Everyone knows means flows better ""Think stupid median person is""
Wikipedia even says:
In statistics, mean, median, mode known measures central tendency, colloquial usage might called average value.

TLDR downvoted pedantism, know Carlin meant said love support statement fucking evidence. evidence i've seen shows protests significant contributing factor, show i'll happy read it. 

Had lockdowns done properly (two/three weeks national/harsh lockdown) things would different. already proven we’re incapable that. things handled state state. states well others won’t. shaming America whole stupid. 

It’s also stress media frenzy causing. absolute anxiety inducing media sensationalism healthy anybody. 

Yes wear mask take precautions, media also responsibility public keep people avoiding hospitals due panic. 

There worse things could suffer medically COVID. That’s worst thing could say sub fetishes virus reason it’s true. would “fear” that? lull births real issue... it’s interesting, positive negative aspects. Trump's spineless lack leadership one greatest embarrassments American history Doctors dying exposed sick people everyday, wouldnt even matter wear single mask opinion. would need full body suit 100% protected original comment pointing fact allowed gathering spread covid. Fine, acknowledgement protests sort link spike? Somehow believe family going beach blame, 20k people LA didn’t anything spread it? say yet percentage country sure  Yes, failed contain it.

Nobody arguing that. Gütersloh. doubt it. $12 hour employee options go back work eat stay home lose unemployment, difficult choice. multimillionaire many times over, option add million possibly expose family even kill yourself. could stay enormous house watch US continue downward spiral, safely. going obvious choice shit gets stupid scary next month. commenting abbreviated 9 days “1.5 weeks.” don’t think I’ve seen before, like it. selfish. can't put entire life pause think anyone expected to. need take precautions. Wear mask, use hand sanitizer, distance people, spray things down, etc. careful. Yes yes yes. trying collect info current political situation order debate parents (lol). piece news ""fake news"" source disregarded immediately I'm find juicy primary sources. difficult yell fake news direct quotes evidence. surprised see McHenry sub. Disney great fun even people like wear lots black listen sad angry music :) still fingers crossed isolate everyone island screen constantly.

I need NFL 😣 Asymptomatic carriers still virus effecting body even feel it. summer cancelled? Earth's northern hemisphere still tilted towards sun. Florida truly trying win covid-19 That's sick. ""friend"" awful person, know rest life killed man potentially others. theme parks Florida already open. Disney actually cautious.

But still, none parks open. Yup. You’re passed New York’s peak FULL QUARANTINE. 

This insane. think two forward thinking major cities helps Move along. dare wear mask fucker! Imagine contract tracing that? realize point we’re even making effort contact trace, imagine conversation:

Tracer: public areas last seven days?

Patient: well, let’s see, went work week Monday Wednesday started feeling sick. went grocery store weekend, son’s baseball game. Oh yeah, Saturday went Universal Studios.

Tracer: [walks out] surprised initial lie masks help worked many people. obvious lie. dumb?? trusting sheep swallow every blatant propaganda superiors shove throats??? building herd immunity, biggy. Oh gods. I'm sorry. can't imagine *there*. like (almost) everywhere else. * knew lot less March/April vulnerable treat it. Reducing ventilator usage alone likely helped fatality rate. 
* New York got hit hard fast testing sickest sick, we're able test catch lot milder cases now. 
* NY also pretty crappy job nursing homes - ran several like wildfire. Sucks admit, football probably least conducive sport pandemic. Baseball hard guys literally physically distanced one another field (they figure spread guys dug out/clubhouse well). 

Basketball *might* work bubble scenario rosters really small necessarily need bring huge staff you. 

Football though. Man. Big ass rosters, big ass coaching staffs personnel. Literally huddling pre-snap. Linemen raking eachothers faces trenches. There's way many bodies football team staff. 

Still hoping miracle happens wanna see Kyler Hopkins connection, I'm gonna assume happening Got ya. long it’s administered correctly (and ain’t fun) process doesn’t matter. You’re right. Meanwhile Alabama COVID infection parties. Spanish Flu anyone? Yeah, hiding question apparently. Yes father died tomorrow absolutely would anything house next year earliest. would need clear house, landfill closed public. need consignment auction stuff, auctions shops closed. need major renovation done fix things make sellable, remodelers vectors infection want deal that. 

Then there's issue evicting drug addicted sibling forcing partition sale though courts happen another 6 months least... 

Then houses sell better summer spring may able get everything done 2021 sell season wait 2022.

Just someone dies mean house goes market next day. middle pandemic, people pressed sell might decide wait while. hard Trump simple right thing? flattening curve stopping u til there’s vaccine. hospitals never close filled never needed overflow buildings prepared even lower now. One two busiest hospitals Columbus saw total 50 Covid patients last month. Yea takes several hours driving reach another major Metro Dallas Austin San Antone Well one controlling oversized orange toddler. yeah...all hail guinea pig overlord (?) also saw AZ planning putting 5 doses vaccine vial (don't ask how), definitely changes math bit favor depends old are. chances dying car crash could higher distance. Today city Austin called texted bunch phone numbers automated message warning increase. didn’t happen shutdown March. drive thru never closed, dining room places closed. paint crackdowns. point, dont fucking care anymore. flip flopped masks fucking much pissing off. fact people blaming new cases states states reopening FUCKING RIOTS PROTESTS. testing, try reopen, rest world calls fucking morons. point, Europe shove it, dont give fuck people think anymore.

I bet mom happy. Look. agree common sense words expert hold weight, I'm sure also agree appeal authority fallacy. contradictory face value? IMO talking different things here.

""words expert"" hold weight said expert back words evidence. again, expert testimony usually backed evidence form facts studies, expertise suggests understand well talking about. I'm sure much expert testimony worth said expert, cross examination, answers ""well that's think"" ""why think that"".

Appeal authority fallacious authority saying something. there's substance, like somebody citing expert who's talking study said expert recently conducted, think anybody going reasonably claim that's fallacy. mean healthy hermits? 

CLEARLY CAN’T! tried open business functioning society number infections skyrocketed! People cannot trusted. That’s business openings proved. understand basic concepts like catch disease \~3 weeks later die death reports take week electronically logged right? idiotic comparing today's death rate today's new deaths calculate fatality rate right?

Surely pretending lack basic comprehension basic information? Double ordering doses hiding extra dose definitely malpractice. would careful sharing info like anyone, let alone reddit. Good thing old people Florida Pull Full Price 25% experience!

Act now! Supplies limited! I’m back now. yeah sucked time. She’s still seeing Covids certain point still gotta live life ...

Florida man: 1958 - 2020 enhanced unemployment benefits go away, sure economy crash even worse. unemployment rate double 25% least. lot people spending much making. cause huge ripple effect. know. Numbers bullshit especially enough people dying hit huge death predictions! I’l bet also think death numbers covered too, right? 

And one frontline working home exactly? Pretty sure frontline means leave house get ‘front’... much distrust government crisis, I'm inclined believe anything malicious part DeWine. 

He handled well beginning honest, open stepping aside let health professionals take lead. 

Unfortunately point amount lawsuits coming various business owners, well rising anger party, he's lose lose scenario mandates lays squashed.

TLDR: DeWine great, morons threaten state get crushed anyways. medical science, that's every disease works..

Its assumption interview confusing me. claimed Italy similar curve China, fitting Italy's curve China made IHME model drastically underestimate deaths Spain Italy. said Sweden .1% all-population mortality proves social distancing anything, Nordic countries end far, far level (which seems likely)? True true, Ventura seems like significantly better person Jacobs Trump. getting really strange. shall see. would analogous 15% coming back positive, half alive test administered, 20% test mysteriously found back warehouse month later case they're discarded citing probably negative anyway based Lt Governor's personal feelings matter. worth noting ""counties 20 coronavirus cases"" likely required masks already degree. said, new ability fine individuals violation order step right direction, even though happened weeks ago. Well, know vanilla ice still alive wish coulda done you.

There’s rule it. Therefore it’s Wuhan, instated strict lockdown

Sorta,[ 5 million people left city 11 million night lockdown announced, morning took effective US lockdowns, super-strict might seem.  used Worldmeter's 7 day average graph. 

 

Every site little different due way days cut off. 

Since like 1point3acres data, tabulated shows 7 day avg 19.71 6/13 (averaged 6/7 6/13) 33.29 7/1 (averaged 6/25-7/1). 

 

Can explain got low point 25? 

Texas Department Health posted fatality 7/2 44. upward trend continues. 

 RIP completely delusional think governors political capital order another round lockdowns. say New York slowing too. well lot states lock again. wouldnt people respected social distancing wore masks. literally need do.if better back May opened would seeing current spike. Outside random idiot n there, people portland abiding mask ruling. bueno. wrong way around - may already know this, I'm going point phrasing anyway - people can't afford kids. society, current organization, can't afford sustain itself. 

Right birth rate less current replacement rate (2.1), 1.7 kids per woman. order keep paying Medicare Social Security, need multiple people working age per retiree contribute system. natural birthrate cutting - even close. We've importing people (immigration) keep things going, arguably, sustainable time - difficult assimilate too-large number newcomers existing society. President clamping anyway. 

So coworkers bums plan lives well (I mean, maybe are, can't tell comment). struggling heroically try part solid basis society fund retirement, receiving woefully insufficient help government, even around them. understand frustration feeling, please consider *your* job extraordinary times, let parents *their* job, sake us all. concept wage work work matters toxic beyond words. 

Also... going rely way governmental program old age... suggest looking plans. ones kids them, least...  shithole countries lie, amirite? decrease Rt mean cases go down, eventually stop gets low enough. everyone wears mask, odds infection go 95% so. virus would die month two. 

You need 100% effectiveness. something partially effective, mean work. look intelligent countries. South becoming covid belt. 
No one wearing masks. Casinos, dining, nightlife, recreation back ""normal"".

It's insane. I've heard others make fun people wearing masks. Idk thinking cities like Venice. ongoing issues tourists. I'm surprised Vanilla Ice still performing.   uneducated solution would Nationwide mask usage type positive ad campaign good hygiene.

Combine test, track, trace program think get 90% need.

I know social distancing means exactly. means shutting businesses events entirely favor think leads issues greater collateral damage also leads resistance first two.

Is social distancing effective stopping virus? think debatable honestly. theory, sure. cost long? Trying rehardwire human nature social interaction seems like lot effort something stick. Stocks crash. Hard. Soon. Finally He's smart Cheney he's definitely evil. Problem is, he's charge dick Bush hide behind.  Bankrupt die apparently options dude seeping clothes T\_T Helllll yeah Florida wooooo nice one Ive arguing guy Twitter thinks problem teens young adults hope get covid get with. ""let everyone free protect old people"" Kids sounds like one, I'd expect one's old enough responsible at-home person, position expect watch siblings, work, supervise siblings' work. Jesus christ goddamn mother fucking plague garden. testing , things arent bad right?? smartest president told so. (Sarcasm). spam articles want, can't compare LA NYC AZ TX. virus spreads differently bases local response virus. get mentality line reasoning. fact places like NYC spiking rushed reopen (very few) people inevitably picked virus protest fewer options available socialize public setting - actual grasp controlling virus protesters likely even test positive COVID. LA, things open protests, things able spread faster easier. Everything combined (protests, reopening bars, restaurants, nutjobs wearing masks, idiots throwing parties, etc.) are. argue otherwise asinine. tout misleading statistics *far safer*
to encourage protesters act infected protesting get tested isolate others sure COVID free? I'm saying one knew beginning. proactive things like shutting travel China Europe, got blasted that.. got blasted done sooner. personally know two people death listed covid covid. know 100% happens. 

also amount people getting directly related amount people testing this, beginning higher percentage death testing capabilities find percentage death actually lot lower. I'm saying particularly bad ""flu"" I'm saying sensationalized politicized. 

I personally believe facts either camp they're using attack side. decide became *less* deadly? Also weeks disappear, surprised, gone like magic. Intimate verb: better keep mouth closed open remove doubt.

Accepting virus going away change approach. Governors going back lockdown, stupid approach. Frankly, New Zealand others unless want walled rest world perpetuity. Sweden US correct approach - learn deal eventually populace gain immunity. economy reopen without restrictions. looks bad now, 2 years US much stronger position.

COVID 19 flu comparable. COVID clearly worse, legitimate comparisons.

YOU said vaccines work. said nothing eradicate disease. best, slow down, again, la influenza. Maybe using words understand, getting confused. Hang there, take learning opportunity. embarrassment make stronger later. Oh believe it, 2 friends rushed straight another friend's house found got back February spent solid 4 hours getting coughed on. reasoning better catch early hospitals ventilators available shortage. recovered fine mild symptoms thankfully. Much lower risk getting full disease. High school students, risk. 

It seems like find new awful thing virus every week. Stuff like permanent cognitive effects. Even destroying someone's lungs, might things.

It'll 3-5 years really start understand thing.  Governor Brown going frown :( Well like defensive insisting didn’t plan, totally did. worked. seeing u/lando241 avoids confrontation telling neighbor aren’t coming that’s stupid idea; I’m sure manage. think real headline Vanilla Ice still performing.  experience behind rent getting evicted once, big apartment complex 5 days late fee, usually 15 days square around 20th they’ll start eviction. 

Independent landlords small building, behind rent like two months, don’t staffing handle multiple evictions tend give time, especially long you’re paying something. also likely mediation first.

So yes agree 😂😂 Exactly. shit show warming up. University back bronze age staff seemed solid grip reality healthy dose common sense surly common folk worked student bar, serving dark ales kept us one step away malnutrition quietly pocketing cash pinball machine. Nobody else lived real world.

Seems like nothing changed. Maybe time let people actually understand life make important decisions. point can't harm. Literally rest thea year.

i dont understand people. global pandemic. Give casual acquaintances . social distancing remaining 6 feet apart. People need also limit social circles nobody it.

My parents dont understand refusing visit anymore. done jack shit limit social circles. Mom, dont get mad prioritized hanging new neighbors 2x week over. BAH. took number computer classes type papers high school, never learned type faster 20-30 WPM. started playing Quake 2 college figure out. last time tested, think 105 WPM 97% accuracy. I’m hoping looking new jobs soon doubt police get away rioting. 60k tests control samples keep positivity rate down. /s Dozens counts wreckless endangerment least one manslaughter 126 posts T_D, nazi glorifying username little late. southern states run worse third world countries states sucking Trump's nuts. better draw line Virginia across country. Anything line must assumed infected. yup, we’re good time panhandle. tourists selfish. they’re closing beaches either... watching interview doctor San Antonio already looked defeated talking came work 10 20-30yr old people come hospital sick decide ones get three beds left. smack back head would effective they're exactly masks cover mouth lol  like call freedumb Shocked...He something. hope SARS-CoV-2 infection spreads, virus might become less pathogenic

That's hope. think plan based hope. Third grade insults entered discussion Anything semi relevant.  welcome. find inconsistent naming fabrics really frustrating. What’s death rate? don’t think he’s clever, knows dumb fuck base wants hear keeps saying it. people continue party fourth. numbers rise. RIP 560 probably lowest 7- day rolling daily death count long time. 2 plane crashes day bottom. sad.  explain asymptomatic people? masks help stop virus STDs live people wanna party go stores masks. Drive states fly places hand sweden one urbanized countries EU. rank 23 world, Belgium (7), Iceland (11) Netherlands (13) urbanized. Belgium Netherlands struck hard corona one got radiated Chernobyl, cases chilling. fucking wrong yet confidence. like people wearing masks. 

75% death age 60

Edit: wouldn’t politicize dead didn’t politicize virus. everything stems back politics, especially 130,000 people dying months. think $$$$$$$$!! 

Fuck Disney Floridian politician allowing open cost human lives. news, barn locked horse can't get back in. dutch cdc numbers right, COVID 2x fatal flu isnt worth economical social destruction.

Did miss hospitals getting absoltuely creamed Italy? Seriously fuck revisionism. barely scraped by, ofcourse overreacted.


Dutch ICUs completely stuffed, despite early 'containment' measures. full lockdown dit start going down.

But really bodies rotting streets, economy would saved. log computer name? funny point manner used name numerous diseases, suddenly there's issue current one? Wonder why.... Bars restaurants several states already shutdown gone back restrictions place. cases hospitalizations increasing, yeah businesses economy hurting, that’s price they’ll pay. Please imagine are, say, forty-year-old chain smoker protect accordingly. Wear mask can. Hopefully required. extremely socially awkward? best. Classrooms rooms kind dangerous hallways.

Carry hand sanitizer use touch anything that's yours. Wash hands whenever can, ideally beteeen every period. Carry lotion, much washing sanitizing kill hands.

I've friends twenties get this. likely die require ICU treatment, sounds like literal torture. probably governor. rich powerful, going fine. rest us screwed. real way, every time decide someone else's life worth living/worth saving, diminish worth. “overall” message “little comment” “job” need “go to” going cower “fear” unless someone pays “bills” 

Did “get right”? option. want lockdown vaccine may arrive go herd immunity? third option, there? Even everyone wore mask today, see effects couple weeks. Hold onto butts Don’t even need that, people opening anyways, illegally. Can’t keep working class haha abbot pretty much said fuck lt governor completely support That’s even close enough identify 50k cases. happened salon owner, one already wearing mask care this. county's page comments saying, ""Who going enforce it? "" ""Might well start writing tickets now!"" hate easy become see many people care Haha I’m mid-Oakland county! Damn. Nice job Florida. (Peaches also indigenous China) Yeah - narrative completely collapsed he's left chasing tail, contradicting himself, providing evidence contradicts arguments, basically making whatever order try keep dying narrative alive. 

It's pretty sad, TBH. Right? feel bad dumb shit age now. know families would trust watch kid day, keep him/you safe COVID-19 too? Could work arrangement form little ""pod"" people immunity-wise, give financial support thank-you? Lot people unemployed nowadays. Might even able work details online, one phone number comes mind. 

Godspeed, hard, extraordinary times. gon' die. supposed clean them? That's ok. observation. deliver mostly convenience stores gas stations. places attract pretty wide variety people, know fact cooperate places like circle k wawa we're explicitly told ask customers leave compliant. 

Also, side note, please badger employees retail mask orders create policies, trying make living like rest us. That’s risk he’s willing take. Remember governor claiming weren’t California many false positives give notice.  company sells electrical cabling. deemed essential owners essentially lied said supply healthcare/medical industry. don't. Perhaps customers do, we've never sold cables directly healthcare/medical company.

It total bullshit honestly. think *a lot* companies skirted rules way. family used go PCB 4th lived FL. bet place gonna absolutely swarmed Covid-19 infested tards Can't blame Boomers vote. feel you. best friend got hit first wave NYC.

Took 6 weeks recover. Another 3 weeks using Mucinex DM get rid nasty cough. God, really need drag fuckers back home states, hold down, inject disease since ""it bad"".

Fuckers. ""After recovering Covid-19, wife continued suffer pneumonia months, concerned that...""

""NO. NO. NO. Tell can't go annual vacation Hawaii year, causing devastating psychological anguish. want hear pneumonia conspiracy nonsense."" chose least precautionary selfish position every issue fight tooth nail right assholes. 

This beautifully captures World's general view Americans. weird thing is: every Texan I've met thinks state feckin' paradise. problem arises deaths hospitalizations start skyrocket. Cases rising really mean anything vulnerable good job self-isolating/wearing masks. deaths start rise significantly 18-25 year old bracket we'll big problem. Jesus. one day countries total. Good. Wear mask. Texan, we’re supposed take care other, y’all done piss poor job that. 

Wear mask. Save life. come Karens many decades take get Americans wear seatbelts? non-dystopias use 5 weeks annual leave take care children Oh, studied every disease? link paper explains that?

But yeah, also ignore second point too. worries knew quoting. wanted continue shit talk, cope shitty situations often times /s makes comment less funny. Cool story, bro.

Anecdotes substitute data, though... ima trust guy posted verifiable source. Hope fantastic holiday weekend fantasy world, though! long industry booming, happy. oil right now, funeral sector seeing unprecedented activity. 
all anti mask protest shit literally paid protests you’ll locate fault individuals people designed system actual power anything response global pandemic killing vulnerable people **chose to**. makes sound hella bad, is; Canada low population considering size. Florida alone 50% Canada's population. idiot boss take seriously. Imagine people refused tests, consider actual number cases Florida. Thanks this, lol X doubt. hear multiple Texas law enforcement officers announce going enforce order. access washing machine? would safe go wear mask. person besides him. Nonsense. Peaches come can. put man. factory Chin- oooohhhhh... April. side-eye pharma companies reflexively continue to. legs stand Florida, never fail disappoint... Unfortunately going keep happening icu beds getting occupied, medical personnel gets saturated much work. According Abbott it’s alright enough beds.... now, don’t get overtly political here. direct YouTube search bar, type “test less”. Sorted relevance find answers you’re looking for. absolutely ridiculous wait long testing still. Get shit together America ffs. Alabama still hasn’t gotten past hookworm disease , PA good Pittsburgh decided throw rager Everyone thinks don’t need wear mask walked ICU slapped end make really sink in! I’m American ashamed entire populous thinks whatever want expense risk citizens. Shame joke, NASDAQ hit all-time high today. We're mandating stonings. can't read studies, say based limited data appears perhaps maybe kids younger 10 act vectors, research required

Yes, research needed. still best sources go current time. plenty outbreaks daycare schools countries Israel. gave also studies suggest kids act vectours

turns there's definitely them. missed earlier quick google foo daycare stuff thanks pointing out. 

for anyone curious:  

and popped google want search them. non-peer reviewed, preliminary studies something base public policy on

I agree part, given current situation quickly things evolving rely less gold standard info decisions. said, still think err side caution. Given Israel looking close schools surge cases coming them, southern states outbreaks elementary schools/daycares, seems like probably looking alternatives kids. Kettle them. Plus happiness. 

It would make daily goals easier achieve though. They’re currently put pants without complaining, yell anybody. doesn’t. Lieutenant Governor Texas independent office governor blood clots extremely sick man’s dick anything reported publicly? Dude could dying! 

This bull shit story I’m surprised many “news” outlets publishing this. Yes, annoying bc he's nice guy he'll say something like I'm afraid, afraid, helping others get sick.  completely agree assessment. 

I’ve working remotely 4 years say lockdown huge positive culture shift remote working whole. 

Previously, one (in circle) working home, would annoyed something happened around caused noise highlighted fact wasn’t office. 

Now, feel like it’s really humanized whole experience. Kids running around, pets, everyone open rough days looking little less “business-like”. feel like it’s really leveled playing field, experience. Upper management feels accessible too. It’s one biggest (only?) positives that’s come experience me. Didnt find mutation several weeks ago? UK dump. Rest Reddit needs catch 

Source: England could learned China, SK, Taiwan... worried them. hoping big inheritance. since lethality maladaptive trait.

Lethality maladaptive trait distrupts ability virus replicate spread. That's one worst things COVID-19 - fine job replicating spreading *before* kills infected person. See, happened slowed testing like President wanted. Ah yes, already see masses posting ""IM DONE FACEBOOK!!!!"" this. 

Ironically, well heads, they'll post said status Facebook.  numbers 4th yet determined...  think means Florida worse Wuhan dealing virus, tragedy Florida getting hit. drove Ohio today. confirm young people wearing masks. Way positive! That's 10/10 comment lmao. that's bloomberg terminals print headlines stop killing black disabled people

stop killing disabled people calling ‘triage’ Schools even consider reopening solve fucking mess,so many politicians disconnected reality sickening No, no. Come back tomorrow. Huh? ""Right United States people walking around wearing masks"" ""...There reason walking around mask, middle outbreak mask might make people (Fauci making scare quotes around) feel better might even block droplet **but providing perfect protection people think often unintended consquences**.

No one expected perfect protection. really..... yeah proven people don’t listen &amp; sadly won’t US. we've chosen leverage firearms culture agreed use semi-automatic. leave backwards russia stick revolvers, right? He’s Russian overseers doubt want ill. He’s following orders Kremlin. (Since Russian born spy all.)  good you’re retirement age. Much much lower you’re younger. clear asshole story asymptomatic contact put everyone else risk completely selfish reasons.

But part easing restrictions really telling part sad story. Yes, people make choices, people choose stay away non essential gatherings, wear masks socially distance. 

But leaders legislators, telling people OK setting tone people behave. modelling shows people think doing. open things tell people OK go socialise, point berating tell OK get sick? 

Is opening supposed symbolic, everyone knows better would still stay home they'd foolish to? want people about, actions clear. think people stay home, shut things tell stay home. open bars restaurants say 'oh actually come sensible'. 

Based comments win-win, open things up, stupid take guidance get sick. absolutely leadership sight. guess anyone think they'll held accountable fuck public health messaging everyone blames people die instead you. age group, important intensive care severe cases? words, reached capacity, would happen death rate younger older people?  It’s buyers’ market. look California. one statement completely proved point wrong.

By logic, fact New York state spike completely invalidates point? 

I think fair say protests causing spread. think also fair say main contributing factor recent spike. One thing would beneficial seeing county-by-county breakdown. seen. thanks, child take away government weed money, I've become stat! also seem forgetting many effects Corona seems people afflicted it, causing problems extension health nation may permanent

In Italy, locked place like Lombardy, police set checkpoints prevent people leaving. course, reports people slipping checkpoints, large, people stayed are. would imagine occurred Spain, Germany, etc..
 
I remember seeing news Indian migrant workers end dying trying return villagers, cases, government even arranged buses help leave. counter-productive, since spreading virus even wider? Instead, temporary shelters setup house people necessary. 

So see India's lockdowns strict ones Europe practice, despite Indian polices rather draconian efforts enforce rules. Florida... Nope. countries failed stem initial spread contact tracing waste resources point. I'm continually astonished touch reality pandemic shown be. imagine India... country that's developed also high population Yep. broadcast back March. Thick cotton dishrags, thin type.

This subreddit [completely insane.](http://www.reddit.com/r/coronavirusvirus) pretty much done deal today cross 47,000...maybe get close 50,000. It’s new air like every 6 minutes. HEPA filters. people saw wearing masks became mandatory public places middle aged elderly group. course anytime ANYTHING happens pesky kids selfish millenials. 

Addendum: saying people age groups complying. yeah, I've seen. person Philly went Gettysburg two weeks ago agree. Even benefits run out, I'll still get hundred week. good. suppose boss paid taxes issued 1099s, would easier process end.

that's smart Fix 1099 loophole fix majority gig work. record, probably beaches, bars restaurants beach towns. think maybe bad choice wording person made statement tell amendment violates? think safer: driving 600 miles, two one-hour flights 90 min layover?

Assume travel urgent essential. gives faith hockey fans. common sense, rational response yet seen among fans sports. Lehigh Valley area pretty well actually except people Mardi Gras partying Easton. 

I wonder areas large portion residents employed healthcare better mask compliance rate? Thank you. probably right, sigh planet fucked excellent advice. Riding golf cart. Yeah. think need long hard look structure country wealth. Aside debate lockdowns asinine really relevant anymore aren’t gunna happen do, county county long periods time. know it’s controversial say intermittent lockdowns may even put much dent overall deaths. real problem mask wearing guidelines. Interesting. thought whole convention delegates moving Jacksonville. Fuck people. exactly. there's demand skillset (even though see, trades exactly lacking demand point) need willing work that's available. not, that's you. Bar Flies Matter Germany figured far lockdowns go.

I poking fun trump / US’s non-response calling America Virus now. seem outdone world stage.  Tried that, work me? Ahhh 19 counties state far. GOOD LUCK. u/undeleteparent bring ICU see patients suffering COVID punishment convinced him? freaking earth mover dragged hill? aunt uncle going Atlanta see son new baby. Opponents beware, opponents beware.  Ah right, someone disagrees you, must conspiracy theory. took data directly Dutch CDC. may like site, data real  Moscow huh? Oh that's nice, 4 months late ok. You’re joking, right? house don’t socialize interact people, you’re telling I’m going get virus? Please elaborate theory. hospitalizations 50% since started reopening people put on, get in, take off. wear around chin/neck counts. Nope. hate everybody. it!!! trump say ok? you’ll remember Trump get majority popular votes 2016 Fastest vaccine 5 years. believe Ebola. could mistaken.

It’s likely Covid done faster. would nice. But, let’s hope best prepare worst. 
That way don’t get reckless behavior people think “meh, I’ll go cares, vaccine soon”

Even vaccine developed record time, manufacturing enough entire world would take well year. say went bar I’ve regular dine outside (NJ). Paper menus thrown table, well replacing table covers every party.

This 3rd season enjoy job, even pay well. allows work (physically, mentally, emotionally) season. I'd like seasons find better job hopefully reached goals better life. 
 
Yeah, really think $600 extra extended. Except open 6 weeks hospitalizations decreased 50% it’s free anyone get tested course cases hospitalizations deaths numbers watch. It’s fine strategy C-list reality TV personality “As seen TV” huckster timeshares, steaks, lifestyle products.
As President United States, it’s fucking terrible strategy. attempt educating general population US? hear one reasons masks weren’t recommended people don’t use properly. public service announcements telling people use them/ use them/ common mistakes people make.

In Australia public health ads tv reminding people wash hands, social distance, stay home possible etc. US anything similar? Probably testing seriously ill people.

Scientists physicians literally beginning people comply. government listening anymore fueling non-compliance also it’s breeding hate discontent.

I one embarrassed civilized countries watching happening US! work healthcare, read real life stories records impact society.

I wish way parade non-believers ICUs makeshift morgues tell welcome wear PPE. real life scary death would enlighten people. Send Florida best results. seems though main way spreads indoors close proximity without masks. think there's fair way open businesses. Reduced capacity, mandated masks, outdoor seating, etc. musts. boyfriend’s dad lives Lee County still goes Hooters every fucking day pitcher beer. wants us come visit (we’re Boston). 

I don’t know do. mailed homemade masks, begged stay home, talk often virus real people fucking dying. He’s Trumper believes cold. gets sick maybe dies stupid president can’t speak truthfully supporting base, I’m mailing obituary Trump. 

Our president fucking coward. Education number one way raise someone poverty people need resources able prioritize education. ""Want basic human rights stole land? Give us land we'll give you."" Holy fuck America constant disappointment. 

Truer words never spoken Iraq. WMD's? kidding, needed reason grab land position troops. Goddamn that's brutal. That's kind always America though. Subjugate people idea they're freed enemy, re-educate erode culture instill complacency, steal land consolidate power wealth. Nobody drew parallels 2008. go tangent. 

This never ending loop slowly chipping away indigenous cultures. think tribes across US getting support long issues continue getting brought people's attention. that’s actually true unless vaccine 100% effective wont be. Never seen anything like it? lifetime mean? What’s time reference? Many people neither. I'm fortunate job I've come conclusion I'm never going breed. never make enough money raise family, bringing one world would selfish since we're midst mass extinction. point breeding future generations going living literal hell. Unfortunately misunderstand relative risks. Heart attacks don’t get better home. don’t sleep off.

The said coronavirus? attacks heart, getting heart attack probably bad idea.

Anyway, fact fear covid-19 keeps people away hospitals. California's ""lockdown"" breaches (cycling near home, visiting second home own) completely allowed. It’s gentrified schools get better ohhh. purposefully obtuse good news major cities (I believe) mandated masks capacity. 


As teacher though, district planning sending us back brick mortar school masks “strongly encouraged” mandated.


So basically month I’m pretty certain catch Covid. really get americans think wearing masks could impede rights lol. live Asia problems wearing mask, hell even wear cheap ass face shields go buy groceries. common sense concern fellow citizens 😂 made laugh, thank believe social media plays pretty big role politicization media outlets play central role mess.  People come crazy ideas own. GEE WONDER WHY. protesting *I need go drink summmmmerrr*

I can't fucking imagine there's spike. huh. wonder many people let go well-paying jobs, working Lowes feed families? Act 1, Chapter 1, Scene 2. doubt much profit. open people go, suspect number way less anticipating. least that’s hope happen. Sounds like great idea! needs 1 covid 10? more, merrier!! case many low income people even COVID19 pandemic? 

with minimum wage salaries, even 2 working adults can't normal life even without children, kids, 100s times difficult. lol That's took this? July 4th looking bueno  Everyone: first second wave? 
The US: Yes Vote out! Stanford guys way overblown. has, now, seemed peter national populations 500/million population. Even so, US would tens thousands lives lose though.... test results Florida taking long, real numbers? It’s six days since tested- still results, dad ill. also point contact tracing results take long. time start tracing, people already spread ill themselves. It’s fucking ridiculous. think fact you, someone connection Sweden spamming bad news daily, decided answer question Swedish public think debate probably demonstrates quite well get downvoted. everyone needs NBA season start /s apply pandemic unemployment specifically? originally applied regular unemployment didn’t get it. later added different application PUA includes extra 600 new confirmed case numbers function testing. Kind funny NBA chose Florida since “safe” compared rest country. state surging faster place, may want consider going New York. Remember time trump decided hurricane gonna hit alabama never did? didn’t give even made landfall South Carolina something yea way NFL give single fuck country. Link actual study: findings: mask use could result large reduction risk infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 −10·7; low certainty), stronger associations N95 similar respirators compared disposable surgical masks similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; *p*interaction=0·090; posterior probability low certainty). Eye protection also associated less infection (n=3713; aOR 0·22, 95% CI 0·12 0·39, RD −10·6%, 95% CI −12·5 −7·7; low certainty)

Not trying troll anything here, trying understand. information find seems indicate we’re testing nearly much anyone else world, China one major Here, Central Florida, Mask use way near be. course, everyone thought way did, human race would go extinct

A large number people think way do...which next generation tiny, drive wages start entering workforce. like Pagans!, science, data.

Remember wanted aggressive borders cut travel early on, lefties media cried rooftops he's xenophobic. China exported virus world-wide without warning? Remember? seem like Nancy told us come San Francisco worry coronavirus? 

Remember MILLIONS protested behest logical normal people everywhere. Interesting. Trump handled mass gatherings ""well"". Can't touch protestors youd racist then. Thank much. Sorry posting wrong place. Inflation's root cause increase supply money, way UBI implemented create bunch new money, since way tax people directly level needed fund UBI substantive level. increased money supply means dollars chasing amount goods, prices rise response. Money subject rules supply demand.

Yes, shop around look cheaper college even huge influx federal state money college education market. overall prices risen. analogy, burger joints selling burgers $5 pre-UBI, selling burgers $20 post-UBI. One place may offer $19, one going drop back $5. restaurants pay workers nominally much higher too, since one going work $8 hour more. pay suppliers too. UBI increase nominal prices taxes without solving anything.  initial post comparing countries other.

“I suspect accurate way compare countries even challenging.” American 1st. Yes! anyone link study? need find it.
EDIT: nevermind found check this? Lots news US good reason..

But Netherlands? Weren’t going adapt ‘herd mentality’?

How’s Dutch doing? hasn’t spread spiked much there?

Honest inquiry.. rose 9 highest day yesterday. I'll wait 3 day average. Yes, right. formulated bit poorly comment, made edit. English first language :) Mutation frequency depend changing environment (although environment effect cases).

On last point, think big chance corona mutate something worse. low mutation rate first place also less severe strain spread much quickly severe one due effect people's behaviour. Mutating less severe strain would therefore also beneficial virus long America leaders take responsibility. Kudos New Zealand. That’s good point, whatever caused encounter happen, it’s unfortunate doctor situation contributed issue Americans trusting medicine rather working it. I’ve never seasonal allergies sore throat couple months. symptoms feel otherwise fine. Finally decided get tested negative. It’s sure shitty time start suffering allergies nowhere. Yes, per official Texas DSHS dashboard.

8,076 precise. Time shut state down. anybody wants hear needs done. Protests consequences agree number cases indicative widespread virus is. don’t agree large number cases bad thing. long people need medical assistance get concerned many people virus. Many people virus asymptomatic minor symptoms. Hardship isn’t invention 2010’s. Every generation shit live through, kids different. However I’m hopeful hardship comes positive change. Whats positive rate today?? moron. protests leading spikes NYC would fucked. cases hospitalizations keep falling. case?

Governor DeSantis making exact point Florida's reopening three weeks ago, waving little ""Mission Accomplished"" banner. point, Florida 6 weeks reopening plan - cases stable, hospitalizations down, yadda, yadda. ( )

It's worth asking case. outdoors really safe? masks stem tide surges happen? maybe take 6-8 weeks virus propagate person's close contacts people close contact show sizable impact testing hospitalization rate.

Massachusetts trying gain sense true impact is, cautiously optimistic jumping conclusion protesters minuscule impact spread virus. evolving situation we're weeks removed from. ( )

Evidence requires time. Let's use beliefs conjure *want* true absolute minds. God's plan. learned one COVID Shuffle well Florida can. That’s court system works nationwide scale ny. would remarkable NY extradite Midwest fta traffic bench warrant Tampa 2 weeks ago drove Clearwater Beach see like took hour get causeway people saw wearing masks workers. take step forward corona approach. start new chapter move intelligent lockdown rules room. General rules inside outside. remain necessary, corona virus certainly disappeared. 

Read new rules July 1, 2020 simple language. 

We started way corona crisis following basic rules, still force: complaints? Stay home tested soon possible. Keep 1.5 meters away others. Wash hands often. Work home much possible. Avoid busy places travel outside rush hour much possible. approach works. 

The peak infections over, got virus control. conduct extensive testing conduct intensive source contact research. enables us make quick targeted adjustments prevent spread virus virus flares up. Keeping distance gives space critical remain alert vigilant.


 complaints stay home tested. preserve space earned together. 1 July, following general rules apply indoors outdoors. Rules justice know spread virus. General rules indoor activities:

 keep 1.5 meters away others. Maximum 100 people per room fixed seats (excluding staff). maximum number people following conditions: fixed seats, reservation health check advance. shops, museums, libraries locations flow visitors, 1.5 meters away rule (locations ensure compliance rule). maximum number people.

General rules outdoor activities keep 1.5 meters away others. Maximum 250 persons (excluding staff). catering industry always works fixed seat. maximum number people following conditions: fixed seats, reservation health check advance. zoos, amusement parks outdoor locations flow visitors, 1.5 meters away rule (locations ensure compliance rule).


 maximum number people. Transport public transport, wearing non-medical mask mandatory. seats bus, train, tram metro available. remains important avoid rush hour. transport B (such taxis, passenger buses coaches), reservation health check advance non-medical mask required. car (and private transport) following applies: mask recommended several people travel one car belong household. transport, rule provisional: keep 1.5 meters away. 


Children youth Children including 12 years keep 1.5 meters adults. also applies childcare primary education. Young people age 18 keep distance 1.5 meters. applies pupils (regardless age) secondary schools, reopen fully summer holidays; 1.5 meter student teaching staff remains force. new academic year, educational activities may take place MBO institutions, colleges universities. students keep 1.5 meters away others.


Exceptions rule everyone keeps 1.5 meters away. However, situations possible 1.5 meter may temporarily released. about: people belong 1 household; contact need escorts; people contact professions (such hairdressers, masseurs driving instructors); athletes (indoor outdoor), actors dancers. Chants, loud singing screaming group allowed. choirs song ensembles, rehearsal performance become possible again. conditions, RIVM provide advice short term.

 Discos night clubs remain closed September 1. Finally situation permits virus remains control, discos nightclubs open long term. reviewed around 1 September. dead wrong. I’m hospice nurse. governor would us burned stake case. would never intentionally starve patients. 

All patients come us options tried. try provide best quality life. 

What ends happening patients tend stop communicating, stop eating. offer liquids food usually turn eat small bites there. per power attorney directive force feeding giving saline drip iv considered life saving measures ‘medical intervention’ literally lose license give hospice patient signed DNR saline drip. given patients morphine aspirated medication hence us give morphine anus, imagine us trying give water barley take lick morphine. 

Anyways, yes painkillers process impending death faster. However ever seen actively dying patient without hourly morphine? Go half hour past time you’ll hear loudest whispering horrifying scream. make valid point 19% positive test rate according article. time holiday. Hope dangerous word days. Perhaps need prayers better yet miracle. ~insert sarcasm ~ Lol, they’re not. AZ already delayed school 3 weeks delay even there’s improvement cases (there won’t be). Says goal post movers all, ""wHat Hospitalizations?"" course seats now. Insincere scrubs. right thing. trying preserve dignity end life. Sometimes time let someone go. That's hospice for. Depending long immunity lasts, bad. revised fake numbers? saw rest world dieing, rolled higher completely obvious lying. scary thing is, we're heading 4th July long weekend. Corona partying right along side Florida. I’m honestly terrified. didn’t say fly fly.

I pointed inaccuracy misconception due air recycled not. LOL. write article say didn't, clearly did. think find answer links. Italy anything fight COVID19 violates ”human rights”? Italy stop people going outside shopping lockdown? China did, people got food.  don't.

You need use appropriate public transportation model region.

Bullet trains terrific way connecting rural areas metro areas. Busses trolleys great way providing localized travel within area.

And ton ADA public transportation solutions disabilities. Gefeliciteerd! Hopefully keep infection burden early. HEADS

SPIKES

WALLS  good time lot fetishes!

Thanks! US, kids leave family they're 18. Since many live alone, mental health really take beating. That's solitary confinement considered torture. wasnt left room starved death. sign DNR and/or refuse extreme life saving measures, one things go procedure feeding tube placed. common end life care. keep comfy. probably able take anything orally anyways. oral swabs caregivers moisten patient suck (if even coherent enough that) caregiver swab mouth with. 

It like begging food telling no. Lots folks Texas refusing strongly. Take tinfoil hat off, set ground slowly back away it. Wow. Just. Wow Yeah I’m Philly. Last Saturday run errands couldn’t put longer. 100% mask usage three businesses went to. didn’t see single uncovered nose. So, 100% usage 100% proper use. everyone kept distance. mean, examples follow, mention, full brunt first wave hit India later say Italy, China others possible – **though point seems unlikely** – U.S. could control virus vaccine developed.

That sound good. Hopefully vaccine soon. Given grandma risk group, might best. Aside great implications. great we'd controlled spread instead? That's fucked man! Dane here, following going Sweden interest.The number confirmed COVID-19 cases Sweden increased continuing so, coincides Sweden testing more, number indication increased infection. still high though, stable. death rate hospitalization rate also decreasing. also read third Stockholm either infected virus. dont agree previous poster Sweden done virus. going direction ""unmitigated disaster"". Correct initial post comparing countries other.

“I suspect accurate way compare countries even challenging.”

In US excess deaths due Covid countries won’t able measure ones Covid ones unless also number cases information. That’s challenging. YouTube great resources strong something child working on. 

COVID great equalizer. Everyone lot obstacles everyone approach mindset. Accept life perfect best keep important things. may mean clean little less frequently get used messier existence time review math homework. may understand subject child working still teach process developing better understanding something. 

Some people better others. best. days might feel like can't day. Listen yourself! Take day think purpose, much means people around congratulate simply trying adapt. Eventually pandemic gone best thing families try prepared. happen we're living edge due financial and/or time constraints. live US... pretty believable. Nobody saying test we’ll less cases. seriously saying trump handled well though? Wait 8k brand new cases day? blocked this? sound like good friendship begin with.. father law travels work, airlines even even though say fundamentally country music is/was supposed be. 100% right. can't downplay virus. Doctors nurses already coming stating understaffed hospitals hospitalizations skyrocketing. People already transferred hospitals 50 miles away original hospital. 

You literally can't cover cases hospitalizations continue increase, will. bootlickers?

/s appreciate info. Forgot gravity average working person. Black unemployment 50% right now. might little important wanting enforce economic crippling policies would help political ambitions. 

Have sympathy. It’s fuckin’ surreal. Glad escaped decade ago. US plunge era darkness. Correct initial post comparing countries other.

“I suspect accurate way compare countries even challenging.” even locking much quickly what?

Deaths still going down.

Stop scaring people. Same. handed masks towns protests. NYC spiking already got hit worst past. California saw huge spike afterwards despite relatively strong lockdown. mechanisms obviously play region sees surge surge again. story throughout world. Italy spiked reason despite people following precautions everything reopening. Ignore trends want. explanation yet make untrue. can’t find anything supporting claim. source? Bingo. AMLO really useless whole time?

YES Hi there, already posted Reposts removed. know people fighting civil rights also spreading coronavirus right? It’s gonna pretty hard improve civil rights they’re currently helping spread virus known highly effecting African Americans poverty, exact people they’re attempting help. Intentional spreading infectious disease crime states. Charge throw prison.  could without dust cloud, admittedly saving us hurricane season I'll put ""allergies COVID-19"" game I've playing last three weeks. !Remindme 17 days 67 new deaths recorded, yes median 37. sure underlying health conditions involved group, I'm assuming probably was...but that's assuming things. never claimed useless, American supply low available everyone general public, first discouraged medical professionals would access them. enough homemade masks showing up, encouraged everyone. fine. bottom line everybody wearing masks social distancing. Wash hands frequently. Stay home much possible. haven’t seen worst this. Darwin finest. Step back recognize governments failed you. “Green phase” means nothing. live Jersey City commute Manhattan work... crazy empty public transportation compared sardine way every morning states handling fine, look north east findings systematic review 172 studies (44 comparative studies; n=25 697 patients) COVID-19, SARS, MERS provide best available evidence current policies least 1 physical distancing associated large reduction infection, distances 2 might effective. data also suggest wearing face masks protects people (both health-care workers general public) infection coronaviruses, **and eye protection could confer additional benefit**

Eye protection talked much all. hope something learned preventive measures Covid infection spreading taken beyond social distancing, high hygienic standards, 3Cs, face coverings?

Such interesting research Vitamin correlation influenza injecting bleach (joke answer) *think* mean jail. knowing things going system right know that's best thing releasing previously withheld actual numbers cases.

In order fake second wave,

in order force small businesses stay closed longer,

in order force bankruptcy.

Mega Corp wins again. meant say asthma, virus made asthma worse. 

Which better way around. treat asthma inhaler, virus though. Yeah Fauci admit peer reviewed journal? 

/s shove nose edge. thanks. Karen, stop writing articles validate unnecessary trips Starbucks local dog park. Stay home FFS! hope get taken downplaying anything, also think large portions US population (and leadership) either taking virus seriously enough, prioritizing things agree with,

However, this. is. flattening. the. curve. 

This headline (not necessarily content) bipartisan clickbait response left bipartisan shot side. entire conversation ""waves"" political misdirection. need this. 

The largest goal ""shutdowns"" keep health care systems becoming dramatically overwhelmed point could properly care COVID (or other) patients when/as need care. intent really would disappear us hid couple weeks/months, even many understand going still don't. clear lot people likely going get sick best action make inevitable tragedy take long happen can. window preventing closed well collectively (like, whole world) real understanding going on. Blame whatever want, past. 

If change goal somehow completely eliminate virus planet fast possible, becomes MAJOR uphill battle (I might suggest impossible) also positively wreak devastating havoc country people areas paychecks, savings/retirement, education, socialization, travel, industry more. 

But rewind second back initial public intent ""flattening curve"" keeping overwhelming healthcare systems... still that. Look overall curve. completely practical implement multiple closings openings different sectors different areas flattened curve stretched maybe 2-3 month catastrophic spike 8-15 months controlled series waves. talked this. completely honest, we've never done before. one knows long shut open make work best case. possible shutdown much often risk losses, also open much/too soon risking different kind loss. actively finding middle ground trial error, whole boatload arguing. 

Other positive side effects flattening curve COULD/SHOULD SLOWING down, learn safer, understand signs precautions virus, find useful medical procedure medicines, redirect resources help out, start building testing tracking catch earlier better follow/report it... maybe even hold long enough (stretch waves long enough) get vaccine final toll hit. ways effectively SLOW total casualty total (that primary flattening goal, sake healthcare system), REDUCE it. lot this. death rate still going even cases go world. excellent news. 

Daily death counts and/or death rates may/will likely spike local geographical time scale. Lots people still definitely die. keep focus overall curve, purposely smashed months possibly year more. 

It also massively unfortunate goofy-ass president US (a supposed role model country time this) tweeting closed-minded selfish thought stream, also election year country. bipartisan politicizing greatest negative far. truly literally causing real outbreaks unnecessary confusion topic remain clear on. also caused blatant misallocation country's resources (economic relief clear example). real obstacle everything mentioned above. imply fucked. 

It simply verifies still human shines massive spotlight MAJOR cracks overall US (and countries) structure/systems (ie. class divide, education, healthcare, etc) existed long time (ie. many many presidents). friend No, should. massively unpopular NZ. criticized breach quarantine tried blame Dr Ashley Bloomfield (our fauci) probably popular person country. making labour party look really bad Jacinda look weak sacking him. core issue adults typically working outside home, school become education, become primary free daycare children age 5. taken away, what?

This especially issue we've literally made impossible family live one person's salary jobs, **requirement** parents work full time. “The majority Chinese mainlanders criticizing government.”

State media criticize government mean people don't. I'm guessing clue Shandong college entrance exam scandal that's heavily criticized moment? 

Nor idea happening back Feb literally everyone China shitting Hubei government? 

Hubei CCP partychair (similar governor) got kicked office almost immediately pandemic begun. U.S. media fighting place freedom press, failure governor Cuomo still office death 30k Americans. freedom criticize government brought changes? think so, least moment.

But anyway am, always, educated knowing China mainland Chinese live China part life. 

Surely, admit U.S. ""more"" freedom, mean Chinese people **don't freedom**, idea Chinese people docile brainwashed CCP sheep stupid. 

Chinese people overthrown two government (Qing KMT) past century, I'm pretty sure CCP would third handled covid-19 pandemic like Donald Trump.  long run I’d rather people laid people die lack hospital capacity.

And handled properly governor beginning, wouldn’t position all. I'm told multiple hospital execs touch local, state, federal authorities pressuring everyone intervene.

A lot local authorities feel like hands tied DeSantis aside masks targeted closures, willing more.

And DeSantis sympathetic hospitals request intervention.

I part calls; I've told them. Idaho huh? worst president ever ICU Capacity since Sunday, point, reporting stopped.

That particular hospital even acute care beds: 

Remdesivir one treatments, denied alternative treatment sent hospice.

They ruled quality life warrant care. Man guys fuckin stupid.
...
But much payout? Desantis: another 10k young asymptomatic patients, good Yeah that’s goal, started flatten people got impatient.

So worse lockdowns started hospitals overwhelmed again.

Sure responsible reopening see increase cases.

But foolish politically timed reopening way early, back shitter. Obviously 10K new cases horrible alarming number. argument “young people” little risk dying, argument anymore rhetoric needs change. start apply law large numbers 10k cases day, young people die. fucking sucks hope find good news effective therapy yesterday. lost mom grandmother hospice care say thank do. 13 home alone mom passed hospice nurse helped get wits call coroner family. 

My grandmother passed side hospice facility. advice tell would ok could move tremendously hard hear incredibly helpful. know kindness deserved even though future scary without her. 

I know take lot physical, emotional, mental burdens others. Thank thank thank you. Unfortunately Florida finally going learn need aggressive response control virus, half measures measures.

They become new New York, data points direction. NYC fucked protests, really know full impact protests yet (some cities spiking not), protests given free pass idea hell kind impact they'd have. 

The point inconsistent application rules. can't time expect people take rules seriously own.

And rational world make sense laying towel beach dangerous standing shoulder people streets? Roll Eagle!!! War Tide!!! Except almost half deaths New York.

25k NY. anything? 
 although hospitals better treating mortality rates lower 
 
Nope. IFR budged. agree. totally gay use term retarded.  Still? Haven’t time fix now. UK poor initially high amount testing. fair, Fauci doctor, he's politician. almost zero chance told someone lie, least cleared someone so. forgive actions, context important. 

What forgivable people wearing masks, know damn well masks work, simply lied past. pure spire. act like scorned ex lovers. Grow up, get it, wear damn mask Yes, we're less formal especially west coast one really comfortable saying they're people dinner, dinner party, that's loaded expectations. Instead everything get together, hangout, form beers food they're called party. 67 deaths prolly gross undercount America-hater pin? confederate flag pin? wonder much they’re gonna lie many people die. Source: work healthcare directly know people patient care. don’t think getting drunk friends comparable, obviously people fucking idiots. think government needs consistent enforce law. laws limit gatherings, need limit gatherings. pick choose. simply sets bad precedent future events. completely agree second paragraph, people need stop short-sighted, stop asking drastic change without thinking used future. Andrew Jackson 2.0 really indigenious Americans fucking favors  things? would need healthy wear mask? agree. That’s it’s hard fathom lying.

Crazy times.  literally like Jaws-movies. Ppl took trash jobs like food service etc reopened lost forklifted lockdowns Yes... That's also happened.

Here's thing. market something short supply, people tend call fraud thing available.

Whether masks Fyre Festival. net result feel disenfranchised.

But Fauci promote wearing masks time, taking account short supply one factor, lack sufficient scientific consensus another factor. understandable reasons right.

Anyhow, there's always stick found could whack horse. rather admitting horse died long time ago move on, people adamantly keep looking sticks. find tiring unproductive.

As said. want argue liars, start politicians unwilling set proper healthcare policies. Reddit, memes, celebrities echoed “it’s me, it’s you” one wanted think beyond that. Ooh, wanna know makes country look worse?

so childish. fact Norwegian articles apparently present high degree facts figures Swedish articles do.

I enough interest go digging, hey also try finding one similar facts figures Swedish pandemic. seen it. one thing take away article posted Norway major shortage ages.

You're overstating. hadn’t thought option. could work. Seems unlikely given “pull bootstraps” motto could happen. fence analogy good. Shooting arrow fence unlikely stop it, possible shoot arrow forest trees, 

like multiple trees behind filter many layers fibers cross another build three dimensional mesh , individual holes may exist thicker material difficult pass without getting stuck somewhere. super fucked. Wow, guy Taiwan says random guy China. Quite rare today. though taiwanese think Chinese. asked come work hours day housekeeping, I've working home full-time past 4 months. part-timers, physically building get paid, looking like 3 heads wearing mask whole time....

One mask all, others looped around one ear hanging heads. 50 older, standing 3 feet apart chatting away....they made joke cute looked following rules transmission low county, worry much....one (a full-timer) bravado chose come back office early live fear, mask sitting knee.

Our boss came office, mask everyone scrambled put there's on. stupidest shit I've ever seen.

I felt like crazy-land pissed got home (I live parents 60) I'm probably going continue staying home I'm told go back.

I work library, hope god reopen public staff takes mask policy seriously. wonder many pediatricians taking appointments via zoom, limiting number patients office time, requiring masks etc. bet most. let’s tell teachers exposed hundreds people day close quarters masks mandatory. Got it! Dude Polio significantly worse. Don’t ridiculous. kid school right sounds horrid. I'll take spoiled dog day. Well, lose million people Civil War, population 31 million 1860. *probably* won’t reach million COVID deaths, it’s largest loss life we’ve ever experienced. Civil War never really ended, big part we’ve still people refusing wear masks socially distance. Correction, 1 5 tested, people likely get tested they're sick know somebody who's got it.

Still lot though. Deaths AZ 10x average month before... tending hotspots already, averaging things population places decline well. Karma staying open masks. Well! actually work school it’s accounting department? Nurse here. Exactly this! Two family members arguing gets power attorney court appointed guardian necessary? court appointed guardian takes long get instated. Washington, around 20-30 days. I'm theorizing vocal family member one wanted LiFe sAvInG mEaSuReS poor man barely anymore. Covid, probably gasping air needing suctioned every minutes even get enough air survive. going die accept it. ran 70k test. in-home daycare closed due C19. began calling around. Half daycares called said going business. Lmao fucked. seriously, all. borrowed money spoiled fucks. tipping fedora comment too? Fair enough. careful number. seems ballpark probably close accurate, Reuters-specific tally official statistics. sure arrived it. Oh, tons! Spinal fusions, hip knee surgeries, limb length discrepancy corrections, ton sports medicine things, club foot corrections, hardware placement removals. Pretty much non elective ortho surgeries fractures, hardware failures, infections. goes vanilla ice concert 2020?

Serouisly Nobody is. like original mask debacle, trust eroded. shame. Honestly dude, whole pandemic shown America worst possible light rest world. shown everything, literally everything, even people's health safety, leveraging people vote one ""sides"". things black white, left right, that, horrible way be. turns everyone everyone tiniest thing, like wanting stay alive.  everyone work home.  Robots staff grocery retail stores restaurants. people work longer child care options, they're bad spot. 10k..? When? Nothing Covidmetrics Give specific direction rather political vagaries. 

Give solid, reliable consistent information disease it’s spread. long said asymptomatic transmission rare. defensible? 

Put call creating needed supplies world - masks, PPE hospitals - lack cause many healthcare worker deaths.

Publicly name countries poorly cooperating. 

Don’t favor approach.Saying Sweden good job, praising China urging borders closed completely wrong.

You say it’s job, job say, without confirming, incorrect things said- human human transmission? job get much wrong spread like truth.

The worst part they’ve lost credibility. recover politician charge. hope massive investigation major housecleaning.

(Edit: ideas top head. I’m sure given time anyone could come better plans they’ve done.) mean point vaccine produced widely distributed. point, hopefully sooner, virus begin fade mixture vaccination acquired immunity.

Obviously won’t magically go away, never implied that. still figuring out. Regardless, impacts entire body far beyond initially expected respiratory disease. I'm sure savvy investor could make money midst possible recession.

That's exactly it. stock market acting delay right now, far people hit financially pandemic people (generally) money stock market begin with: minimum wage workers, people need on-site work, etc. People money enough liquid savings stock portfolio felt hit *yet* they're tech workers, retirees, real estate workers, people otherwise jobs home conference bridge. stock market takes dive, huge risk put money low, make bundle goes up: they're still employed, housed, fed, not?

The blow still going land second group people things like food supply start fall apart, evictions start go through, debts repaid, etc, brief point time half country work half country works industries going gang-busters, amount money people stock market relatively unaffected pandemic. It’s exactly intentional starvation, decision use invasive measures. point simply cannot eat forcing discomfort often cruel. tube push food fluids you’re slowing inevitable forcing endure discomfort humiliation rolled, changed, cleaned every hour instead letting rest family present. 

Most times person made wishes avoid pretty clear trusted loved one make decisions them. 

As drugs, comfort becomes priority safety. respiration fast shallow pulse high they’re moaning can’t moved without crying out, drugs given liberally. point goal remove pain anxiety, simply keep manageable like would surgery something. Sometimes hastens death hours vs days. That’s bad thing. 

If make point hope like hell load instead making lay days. never bad time fetishes.

Rule 34: something exists, porn 
Rule 69: kink shame cock block. sounds perfectly safe Shut nonsense travel Honestly agree many Norwegian healthcare workers: hopefully Norway update gudiance. Norway history saying ""oh, new information huh? Time change tactics!"" unlike certain Nordic countries one could care mention. I’m situation. It’s full time guilt.. working ass off, stretching beyond limits, still feel like you’re enough home, work, kid, extended family needs support... it’s shitty, shitty time single, working parent. “we failed maintain flat worse lockdowns started” phase. 50 boxes masks could try setup flight route, yea breaking even. 

&amp;#x200B;

 don’t think argument medical masks. didn’t know effective regular folks bandannas, cotton paper towel mask It’s easy get test states Yep.

Depends job.

I lost job. Company laid 60 percent. 

My wife Nurse. Union. 

Luckily ok. that’s us.

Can’t imagine others going through. hope best them. Yes, expresses frustration feels like standard bearer clearly many far worse situations. Trouble is, worse straits time capacity write editorial NYT. 

I agree properly-researched “news” article rather editorial. would like see quotes statistics. She’s right silence topic bewildering us suffering every day. man, one bozo said, masks useless b/c can't stop fart. know, that’s can’t fathom. People wearing masks socially distancing. look evidence states like Illinois, New York, California like nah nothing Definitely worth me, stay alive least November 3rd.  meantime, go early morning grocery run, assume everyone see infected actively shedding live virus.. Mask, goggles, distance. Sooooooo literally they're saying individuals disabilities' lives matter much able-bodied folks... Previous Thursdays:

June 25: 5,004

June 18: 3,207

June 11: 1,698 holy shit... Or, could reflect better levels care fewer ICU patients. So, health system limits, patient:nurse/doctor ratio worse, resources stretched thin, hospital staff exhausted overworked. Maybe compare death rates occupancy % eliminated potential variable? simply can't make sure kids get near grade like 8. inevitable.

If going enforce militantly point even go school full day. Reminder everyone Disneyworld opens 9 days schools start first week August. state basically holding gun head yelling everything fine. Im sorry cancer survivor DISCONNECT. literally nuking insides chemicals try get wild cells control. get sick chemo, side effects REAL I'm 28 opposed her. get sick easy colds last noticeably longer now. 

Let know enjoy colds twice long rest life. Covid-19 herd-immunity speedrun any% Many wealth assets factored in. take out, though, realize “half retirees surveyed 2016 Retirement Confidence Survey reported less $10,000 savings investments, quarter reported less $1,000 saved”. deeper look Social Security system reveal keep people poverty, yearly increases cost living (Cost Living Adjustments, COLAs), rate legitimate rising cost living. still may wealthy compared younger generation, still wealthy 15 years ago, either. 

Tldr; wealth includes assets, lot wealth still enough expendable money (think expensive house living SS). SS doesn’t pay enough many, others pays enough enough buy frivolous things.

NOBODY understands difference ""we *evidence* wearing mask helps"" ""we evidence wearing mask helps""

If evidence, mean mask useless! means know. 

What said was, ""we know much helps, better nothing."" scientists talk way. (In relationship scientist.) European countries actually Sweden. Particularly Nordic ones.

It’s like threw cell phone dryer yelled suggestions side glass. needs school anyway midst pandemic? Folks review mortality statistics pay close attention age groups pre existing conditions. Yes number cases dramatically ramping, folks 45 pre existing conditions keeping ICUs free high risk folks. 

Its true exponential growth politicians media broadcasting high risk folks stay doors protect themselves. would rather see $1 trillion dollars spent protecting high risk wasting money folks like exceptionally low fatality risk.

Good luck! ""*Fuck kids.*"" Ah ok, thanks replying! Watch out! bias showing! Distribution/cost vaccine gonna major issue tio. Plus anti vaxxers lol tell think sarcastic No, never said all? ignoring fact vast majority protesters masked, whining ""freedom"" gather willingly unmasked. Please stop calling protests ""riots"" well, people rioting *are fucking police*. Again, there's huge difference willfully ignorant putting others' lives risk, fighting revolution best follow CDC/scientists guidelines. response highlights issue hand well- police tear gassing peaceful protesters first place, thus forcing people remove masks. diplomats. lot foreign bases many countries. would PR disaster, somehow soldiers flying military base Germany Korea responsible new outbreak. while, flu season abruptly ended 5 weeks earlier average powerful iraqi information minister energy science papers say work? reading papers? provide citations here?  Dare go far call manslaughter? Weird. Disneyland’s reopening hold that’s California. test efficacy vaccine? Give forty people arms COVID-19 party? susceptible false negatives get it? people volunteering actually risk getting sick go regular lives standard protections? friend party reached Macias say coronavirus, aware diagnosis attended gathering didn’t think could infect anyone symptoms,

Why guy put mandatory quarantine everyone lives recently contact with, too? USA lacking rules? 

Not mention guy know could infect others? doctor tell got diagnosis? even necessary June. everyone known media reports asymptomatic people also infect others quarantine. Texas  Pass friend already stated think contagious ...a defense ""knowingly transmitting infectious disease"". criminal charges out. transmit knowing intent. far california law goes.

Lawsuit? maybe hard say pin legally without doubt firend. Don’t listen guy! got this! I’m little 90 days sober it’s made whole thing bit bearable. Come stop r/stopdrinking sometime haven’t already. agree facts say masks + outdoors results low transmission.

And masks + indoors high transmission.

Like beyond science it’s logical. Airborne particles disperse MUCH faster outside inside. Masks trap high percentage exhaled water particles.

How hard understand? Well. hard apparently. Wow Let subpoena you. Show court plead 5th. Since NY criminalized gatherings 10 could invoke it. like scene one naked fun movies Leslie Nielsen standing front burning building yelling “nothing see please disperse” online schooling? depends person lives. Also $600 week $31,200. New York 11,500 new cases 23,000 hospitalizations peak, reference. research show much spread happening result protests. I'm sure happening, perhaps level one would feared given close proximity. think need time validate/invalidate research.

I also think fact many locations protests took place experiencing points idea protests main contributing factor. think _good_ news. Perhaps means beaches outdoor activities remain? thing happens subpoena rate evolutionary quelling exciting.  Oh boy wait September peak hurricanes season Check post history, extremely people anything put people risk hospitalization.

My point solely one things doctors communicate way builds trust public. That’s difficult situation, I’d argue it’s important. U.S states starting mask mandates, odds state bans masks? full, right? been. weeks. even know long looking headline? kids old enough left home, responsible enough online homework themselves. summer problem school year is. Remember Dale found Nancy affair Bill played stupid nice...Ya that’s kinda imagine lot people feel Florida. wife due date buddies! also UI right husband not. light end tunnel right one states given COVID middle finger actually well laws. said, there's way afford stay things are, yet way move either state virus. frightening, world never perfect place baby. waited problems worldwide, would die species setting infrastructure every third world country. way things looking right now, we'll moving family able save payment state manageable cost living take hard hit. UI...there industries considered essential actually quite clean, factories produce pills food. area I'd look them, hold over. southern surge folks Give specific direction rather political vagaries.

They exactly that. know know read news headlines. Go source read SitReps, press briefings, guidance documents. solid, reliable consistent information disease it’s spread. long said asymptomatic transmission rare. defensible?

Asymptomatic transmission rare. Again, news reports took 5 minute explanation wrote headline made mention difference pre symptomatic. name countries poorly cooperating.

This they're now, calling country contact tracing appropriately. favor approach.Saying Sweden good job, praising China urging borders closed completely wrong.

Closing boarders never proven prevent viral pandemic. recommended them. Testing tracing physical distancing known work, advise favor approach.Saying Sweden good job, praising China urging borders closed completely wrong.

They rely reports China cannot enter country without invite. Again, revealing ignorance actually is.  worst part they’ve lost credibility. recover politician charge. hope massive investigation major housecleaning.

They've lost credibility ignorant. knew virtually nothing 6 months ago. seem group. Assuming three weeks full lockdown peak cases like NY, FL full lockdown today:

Jul 9: 20K
Jul 16: 40K
Jul 23: 80K peak

If lockdown fully...today... American here. Actually chewed coworker blaming protestors &amp; calling second wave. amount stubborn ignorance country astounding. Canadian here, serious question, US hospital refuses treatment sole reason payment, patient dies, hospital responsible death? much sympathize wife, doctor right wife making emotionally based, unintentionally cruel decision.

1. Chinese people perfect docile communitarians learn led scientific elite, also they're human people.
2. Chinese people horrifically abused repressed government worse North Korea rise rebellion moment GDP growth slows even slightest bit, also Chinese culture trash, also lynch Chinaman view usually associated trash tier racists.

The problem is, literally neither narrative true; verge actually racist they're already full-on racist, subtly wrong many ways endorse either. Chances downvoted contradicting narratives - first sounding bad, second sounding good. See guy said 'and clapped'? Yeah, F- guy above. thinks partisan narrative one, really not. Last checked, truth Chinese public extremely uneasy literally everything; disease massively damaged trust CCP government... hell happened rest world? would used disease resist government, least loose faith it, fact almost everyone else important Earth screwed harder.

Also seems problem is, narrative makes Chinese people sound human, ergo makes actually happened seem like could happened here, threaten pretty directly. Finally, people lionize idea rebellion resistance, 'punk ass'; hear government shutting remotely associated anything good straight offensive them.

For feel triggered said - Canada's enforcement basically exist, we're still crushing covid. We're much, much slower than, say, Australia, apparently actual internal borders, complete surprise. New York really close. live hours away week we’d go outside night listen helicopters flying patients up. Nobody mentioning decision ignore COVID could financial one.

This disagree individual states dealing pandemic. Instead saying ""always wear mask"", pithy statement, state health agencies giving clear unambiguous instructions. ICU mortality viral pneumonias, question is, COVID-19 higher rate ICU admission well? 



This sounds like direct comparison me, mortality dates 40% 200% accession rate impact still double pnumoniae teachers pay basic supplies personal budgets, second job survive &amp; afford live area teach in....we'd closer paying enough. 

Also, everyone gets used living new amounts raise. ask another raise year later. That's abnormal wrong. one expects work amount year year nothing COL increase, quit. 

I agree seems amount pay taxes equal see going schools. believe far much goes administration &amp; facilities 100% necessary (sports stadiums, upgrades areas wealthy, etc). 

If want better education, need focus bottom &amp; front lines rather top. need start addressing actual problems causing poorer schools &amp; lack child care, instead blaming issues other. Humanity dealt similar diseases history.

The US experienced pandemic 1918. 

This first time. may many persons individual first experience pandemic, first time dealt things like this. Well lot people, particularly south/sw right now, literally going lives nothing happening. Rent freezing always broken bandaid. never COVERED rent, postponed cases hurt landlords near-term hurt renters anyway later whenever bandaid comes owe far possibly pay. suppose delay evictions also requiring people stay HOME, matter, suppose. 

But Fed focussing higher ""pipe"" beginning putting money lost incomes directly people forced work (ie. also giving individuals still working, one example) protecting creating jobs via incentives employers, actually putting real money utilities rent payments instead ""pausing"" look nice paper. lots wilderness parks take daughter weekends. lucky 6 year old loves explore, go fishing, look mushrooms, catch frogs. go never closer 1/4 mile another person. feel really sad people safe option outside. weird think are.
Here Greater Toronto Area see lot people treating like we're normal times, 40% (by estimate) masks. We're beginning reopening too, lots people out.
In Montreal, cousin lives epicenter outbreak going somewhat like normal. I'm assuming like him.

Yet numbers going down? mean, I'll definitely take it, damn miracle. I'm confused how. really wish everyone would understand this. options aren't:

A) Die

B) Get feel better

People acting like common cold something. absolute stupidity people think chickenpox type party forgetting chickenpox long term effects people too. Ever heard shingles people? fucking want shingles going get shingles chickenpox guess what, decades later, fuck up. 

Someone mentioned yesterday like polio flu terms condition leave people 100% correct. place pass cost on.  GH wants 10% whatever, item marked 10% menu. GH sales skyrocketed this. lose they’re tipping driver instead me... sales good boss so. 

However usually tell people “just call me, time pay extra 10% delivery fee tip, you’re paying way much it’s money”. really bad country, no? critical early periods pandemic government lied said masks pointless. Redhat boomers gonna boom (the case count) That’s pretty small compared millions people going things normal dining indoors, going bars, church services etc. said 60 Minutes Mar 8th. Customers, too. matter places open people sense stay away. Greed some, gluttony others. agree. country thing much worse way. went lockdown early much populace care fucked up. opening seeing one highest growths per capita planet. first lockdown fails bad leadership dumb people know second one ever work people can't stop idiots. People governments need wake fuck tbh. Protests responsible cases according lot recent research driving force behind recent spikes. would many indoors, mask-free gatherings part reopening. It’s true media take break covering pandemic discuss protests, previously wall-to-wall coverage virus people smart enough understand still there.

If want blame someone spike, blame Trump. broader anti-science, individualistic culture ignorance US. Don’t blame people fighting basic right killed police.  Hospitals **will** capacity coming weeks, late suppress spread enough happen. could seen coming... /s think fair say protests 100% causing uptick spread. think fair say _only_ reason we're seeing numbers like this. Nearly every single major city form protest. every single major city seeing huge spike cases. NYC, Chicago, DC, etc not, last saw. Hard say. I've seen several references 19%. One example: Doubling every 7 days. 

Nothing see here. Right?! People realize this, trains still running too. SD one shut down, still firework shows scheduled beaches open. Yeah... got suckered fake news there. Russian based news source claims something analogous population control conspiracy theories? don’t believe one sec... mean...if tried enforce mask bans everything else that’s going don’t like think reaction would be. People going resist, see many stories jerks coughing even assaulting retail workers trying enforce store’s policy. businesses don’t want enforce retail sales already far. I’ve left home handful times since March go necessary doctor appointments doctors enforcing it. Like, wtf. don’t know convince people selfish assholes. kinda old news, India South Asia, East Asia. People mocking ""it's flu"" crowd sub since beginning also unironically comparing 1918 flu expecting covid act like breath I've seen photos ducktape shower curtain rigs looked pretty well sealed.

Well except air vents sides barrier. Maybe ok fresh air intake recirculate. Keep driver box slightly pressurized. Unfortunately reap sow. Apples fall earth even don’t believe gravity. 

Florida’s elected leaders decided virus wasn’t significant enough issue assed anything about, they’ll simply weather storm. 

I feel bad Floridians took seriously day one. everyone selfish shithead, people taken seriously right things hopefully less likely catch (since they’re wearing masks, avoiding unnecessary excursions outside homes, practicing social distancing contact necessary). Damn. safe. wish could slap governor “Moscow,” Idaho say?... South Africa, government looted billions meant help citizens. would said rave or, college party, it’d say college party. there’s BBQ involved five people attending BBQ it’s usually considered party large get together.  Hope helps! beaches closed locally manatee county. Business usual here. mask mandate either. least city Sarasota smart... become like Wuhan, people dying benches around hospital.  COVID treated, needs resources technology scarce. Can’t second wave first wave never stopped :tapping head: Ok. you.  Yep - might could looking ""vaccine-boom"" births.....but we're good long ways right now. Yup things suck right. teacher parent get it. However nothing would worse child bringing home virus getting mommy/daddy/grandparents sick. happen. Stage one. Denial. getting 1065? I'm getting ~490. bullshit also disproven, also, need aggressive cos agree view

Also, bottom line India handled pandemic well, 6 lakh cases, unemployment rate around 28%, economy drain. Simply put, done well should, however, time turn around situation becomes similar USA Brazil Unfortunately misunderstand relative risks. Heart attacks don’t get better home. don’t sleep off. ""There 67 new deaths reported Thursday, bringing state total 3,617 since beginning pandemic. 15,150 total hospitalizations — 325 Wednesday.
Testing increased Wednesday – state received 68,821 results labs compared 45,466 received Tuesday. That’s closer spike results saw Wednesday Saturday."" article says 15%. different one said 15 yesterday 14.6 today. 🤷‍♂️ correct, Fauci middling bureaucrat charge NIAID. fact nation ceded leadership guy administers research grants oversees lab work indictment nation, man. absolute political bullshit. MI lockdown three months governor repeatedly hurt Trump's feelings going TV pushing back anti science statements COVID. averaging around 200-300 new cases per day, unlike FL, TX AZ. flattened curve still restrictions. long way saying, worried read this. Oh man. would perfect California red hats gotten used benefits less people smoking indoor smoking anywhere. example may skew “tests per confirmed case” overall matters confirmed cases. “Confirmed case” tracked individual metric used reporting. 2020 year invisible hurricanes deadly viruses 60% people ""have"" yet dont know show symptoms hear earth got 150 degrees warmer global warming able measured. rotation sped million miles per hour...we can't feel ""gravity"" It’s gotten lot worse last hours I’m terrified. I’m pretty certain already COVID back January though feels awful lot like common cold, get pretty frequently. mom keeps insisting colds longer going around get sick now, it’s COVID nothing else, obviously common colds aren’t going stop existing.

I’m really scared. Orders magnitudes people went business normal unmasked spending time air conditioned spaces dense people.

Yes protests clusters protests given state similar size cluster one two bars. bad comparison. Although personally want everything stay closed indefinitely vaccine, bar/restaurant/hairdresser place someone would go best several weeks, 2-3 hours time, volition.

School five days week 8 hours, lots contact social distancing can't reasonably expected children, also mandatory, wildly higher level risk.

So bars hairdressers open one forces go it, schools open, way hell able keep kids home social/legal pressure make kids go school, also one school understanding reasons keeping kids home, apparently ""safe enough"" school open. Unless country allows homeschool indefinitely without reason). TIL there's thing ""no shit, Sherlock"" US. situation boardwalks feels like massive oversight. But, hand, aside posting cops security officers entrances enforce capacity limits I’m sure could done them. chicken egg. I'd argue poverty egg spending money social supports early childhood. say given death rate age demographics die this? come peace, honestly wanting take this. risk death average parent seems pretty damn low justify shutting everything down. Read again. 60%. new cases registered past 4 weeks 70% people 39. Thankfully job mostly remote wife summer. Otherwise idea would long term. Bruh, barely date economy. Much less think kids time like this. asked whether worth not, judging quality life themselves? It’s subpoena, 2k day. subpoena county also almost doubling capacity. way staff needed that. It’ll magically go away dont worry Here's chart showing 7-day average. see increased week. Feel free keep refreshing next days.

Just keep mind way deaths stay constant face many cases death rate COVID dropped essentially zero. would absolute miracle, one would love see, also something would recommend bet significant amount money Yup. Still wearing mask lessens chance droplets reaching nose. Doesn’t it? Bruh Lots things considered ""party"" USA: 


Hopping plane LAX 
Rockin' kicks 
Not getting memos 
Butterflies flying away  
A Britney song 
A Jay-Z song USA🇺🇸USA🇺🇸USA🇺🇸

🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🦅🦅🦅 “Safest Place America” Florida. Okaaayyyy closer home me, United States' sudden uptick pneumonia. press get right? conservative press misrepresenting it? Yes, careful this. buy case data Reuters might sources labs. death total would seem hard generate internal journalistic ""tally."" stories Florida I've read morning, two big counties, show one additional death each. Pretty much hospitals suggesting people seek emergency care.

As routine care, hospitals put procedures bitter demand regulators policy makers. drove lot financial distress.

Nobody meant people chest pains stop coming in. say “only”. Man people sick. ""feel free ignore"" lmao yeah let someone lie I've said. 

Hope enjoyed post history, unless play certain video games probably pretty boring.

You're bad faith actor. point I'm replying fascination people fringe makes tick. Helps governor PhD went MIT wanna go Insurer cover Covid seem like crazy gamble. right, heard medical experts compare polio COVID-19. know guy hosting video nutjob not. using first link video quickly found. exactly everything garbage. people, held higher standard. Especially they're going way belligerent ignorant science possible trying force play game. 

Politicians: allowed lie manipulate. 

Soldiers: heroes wrong. 

Scientists: even single one must infallable God, one makes mistake ( less foot fire powerful man world, mind you) OWNS IT, dismiss entire scientific community condemn liars. 


Your double standards disgusting. part problem. Ah, someone else get it. Cute. Thank Governor Ron DeathSentence. Well, I’d rather get dogs humans. guy here. 3 kids 5, lost job. Wife work takes care kids.

Managed find remote work, worked sleep nights! even remotely. I'm trying take away anyone else's struggle, I'm discussing something related. think fucking problem trans people discriminated worry doctors de-prioritizing life-saving treatment bigotry? Remember people Florida partying bragging amazing there... widespread covid testing available, Kentucky using flu numbers guide lockdown procedures. article discusses camping going summer vacation rental. Nothing risky immediate family. cant get Covid freeway. 

People willing stay home long term. people short period time that's going willing do. Right wrong that's reality. 

If could get everyone actually wear masks. protests surely caused people get infected. people protesting wearing masks ignoring social distancing. certainly also causing infections. purpose whatever nutso reason come with. Tulane Kolls working MDR Logix, LLC, New Orleans based biotech company, commercialize discovery begin phase clinical trial. older woman bust stop say exactly that, rare think.  It’s time prepare ventilators Texas What's deal story 10 nurses sending tests kits nothing every test coming back positive? Anyone got link? dad told tonight. shit fucking idiot, don’t use things 90s gauge 2020 dangers 

I’m done crap lol, seriously start holding idiots accountable? Dude’s likely dangerous publicity stunt since hasn’t even relevant since 90s Reddit? Full idiots read article instead post opinions? Sounds right me.

This website never ceases amaze. Thanks posting this. think combination knowing treat better proportional share positive tests nursing homes going down. Younger people ridiculously low death Would good know contracted close proximity beach. worldometer Cause he's dumb    point? It’s going good 😂 $300 VIP area sold see Vanilla Ice opening act, Color Bad. Whether show up, that's another question. America's battle covid really 4th quarter? That's fair. Sorry loss.

Hopefully driver experience personal tragedy realize stupid he's being. seems like that's way people start wake up. Amen that. number people concerned economy health boggles mind. I’m sorry work environment. extra sorry many people don’t believe virus real impacts someone know/love. sudden get it. Everyone hoping quick miracle cure.

All far bulls---.

The people promoting bull seem politicized. flu, summer kill it, we've already it. audience academicians write supposed know gap ~28k likely contains many causes death, including COVID not.

They also used data less 30 days old. It’s uncommon death data get revised (and beyond) window.

I wonder might looked examined April data only. final test. give up? Since wearing fucking mask human rights violation? country effective lockdown. didn’t. Plain simple. Masks proven work. That’s need them. It’s really hard, dipshits like you. USA completely different beast. know, 300+ million people literally rights anyways. mean coldstone (?) fired employee bc someone bitched kids couldnt get served bc werent wearing proper face mask (which policy something like that). 

if uber serious abt caring drivers would helpful tho  yeah things eat might milkshake wait food waiting time. i'm thinking probably IM SC, IV. American Airlines fucking shit show right now. [Times Square still looks pretty Wait next weeks... gonna BAD break various taxi oligarchies force better compete service levels and, possible, pricing models.

Temporarily due splashing around investor cash, around service level dropped taxis. Still cheap we'll see happens want profit.  sitting waiting next pandemic. Face masks help protect lot things viruses. USELESS Covid-19. I've even spoke Doctors professionals agree me. whole Covid-19 everyone obsessed wearing face masks little immune system. means EVERYTHING body use fighting daily basis longer case people die becouse lack immune system. Face Masks death many us. People keep thinking it’s different virus hit Wuhan Italy. It’s folks. It’s same, damn, thing.   People actually want see him???? fuel burn hot enough melt steel beams

i thought forgotten wonderful piece ignorance. looking forward ""just sort disappears"".... Show evidence ‘clear undercount’. 
Hint: can’t use excess deaths circular logic. 

I’ll wait. it! Yay-- wait, fuck!  states states def cooking books coronavirus deaths. thread surge ""pneumonia"" deaths Texas. Manslaughter? Hahahaha how? (older) neighbourhood people even try smartening home putting market days expecting someone pancake build McMansion plot.

Personally think fit well fish bicycle homebuilders still think great idea guess. Well that's mine too, one things easy enough hand barring real treatments reserved hospitalized, I'll take get. yet remember back March whole bunch idiots said ""We iTaLy"" like health care system far superior their's. Delusional. Bad news 50,000 cases. Good news deaths still dropping bit week ago, yesterday. asking lot far low death rate continue. SC like Georgia, massage places still open? could console perfectly safe massage! Well shut bars San Diego like day shut bars counties I’m going assume get shut Monday weekend. 

I’ve people tell it’s fake it’s okay fun sometimes aka every day horrible fingers crossed get shut mean yeah losing job sucks I’d rather unemployed come home get family sick dumbass co workers can’t go get drunk every god damn day “friends” I'm teacher, know first hand Jesus! That's awful! Like lady doctor's office: took mask waiting room drink coffee. office coffee service times beyond me. also empathize realize everyone consumes information/media do, see current events world completely different perspective. Florida accurately reporting deaths since took away medical examiners. much worse get forces to. losing battle, haven’t you?” BBC host asked Fauci regarding yes, have,” Fauci said. “We cannot give appears we’re losing battle.”

I agree can't give 50,000 cases day complete lack federal track trace program seems already given up. point hard imagine ever get back control... say like there's difference. wear mask vaccine covid moment. Coronavirus deadly worse flu

So opinion masks required vaccine developed majority population vaccinated, right?  Remember death lagging metric. lag every step way. First exposure... lag.. positive case... lag... hospitalizations... lag.. come deaths. deaths occur 3-4 weeks infection exposure 2-3 weeks case counts increase. - Dr. Kohli line questioning absolutely inappropriate time. saying “not me. Can’t happen I’m safe.” Guess what? You’re not. folks evaluated psychopathic sociopathic tendencies never allowed hold position trust expect depend local conditions. I'm lucky live Vermont. probably able continue successfully test trace I'm confident school take reasonable precautions given risk.

If taught state looks like Florida August would strike quit. makes sense! 90s back, baby!  Glad see USC taking right step here. university pushing full steam ahead reopening. won’t even confirm stop instruction person Thanksgiving... necessarily. social distancing, masks, rigorous cleaning. Universal done great job. also discounting fact almost outside spread out. Florida beach house party people cramming in. Sort goes whole ’united’ states thing going long time. Actually told wasn’t that. medicine called Anaferon. Sorry. wrong! Governor said they're going back. say vaccines faith base, said put faith aka hope aka future hands vaccines. vaccines work, 95%+ population gets vaccinated, scientific definition 35% threshold ""herd immunity"" meaning singular choice want fast tracked, loosely tested vaccine net impact almost ZERO. Now, 95%+ population get vaccinated, ""herd immunity"" threshold met people still getting sick infecting other, means vaccine JUNK needs taken back lab. affect vaccine promised. Period. sucks. kinda opposite, way. stable part time job would lead full time work. Union, benefits, pension, reasonable wages. Kinda went it. 

I wanted kids young (first 27) job hoped land 30 years get kicked out. want wait job, worked way top pay scale. want last decade job kids college. way help required, otherwise enjoy empty nester still going job like.

It tough though, part wishes waited. guess, like said, there's way control variables. It’s kind like feel American respect rest world right now. guaranteed many students taking gap year. Whether college online modified person, colleges cannot expect people go debt substandard educational experience. realize exaggerated generalization work 21-27 year old ""children"" ...they selfish mean F..... definitely spreading covid give zero fucks Wife baby. great jobs good companies thought gonna careers. saved while, hoping able buy area wanted. Finally found great house. Moved COVID hit. 

Her company fantastic hasn’t laid anyone 40 year history. company’s CEO company wide tele-conference ensured everyone layoffs agenda would resorted extreme circumstances. fired roughly half company 2 weeks later. 

Now we’ve pulled baby daycare, watch wife works home. Daycare workers educators make anywhere near should. We’re fortunate wife still job, that’s it’s good one good company. know millions even worse situations are, terrifies me. Come end July UI ends, things start getting really tight bleak millions more, country rough times. one wants piss sugarmamas sugar daddies. want get new mansion eyeing. We've sold higher bidder. Possible herd immunity? count Kemp yet. see saying ""it fluke"" moving forward anyway. didn’t vote orange tool , one know either. Hope rest country doesn’t fuck us voting mentally ill child again. kids think immortal. we’ve seen last several days spike cases way beyond worst spikes we’ve seen,” Fauci said. “That good news. We’ve got get control, risk even greater outbreak United States.” hypothetical prove point. think disease would require this. Air China one-way ticket sell people near impossible though, society deemed science experts ""load crap"" speak. patient get tpn (nutrition though IV). would inappropriate give it. Aww that's awful, can't even imagine. I'm really sorry carry burden. could intubated. resources. battle guardianship wife sister. scenarios happen one wants everything possible including extremely painful care extremely unlikely succeed one wants let die peacefully. extremely common scenario, abnormal case all. can't agree goes state ward decision must made made proverbial ""pull cord"" decision. 

I'm judging whether correct call not, that's impossible know without details. seem impression due lack hospital resources not. Greatest southerly migration drunken superspreaders world ever seen.  crashed market? stocks 25% january! I'm one teachers district pays reasonably well, 900 students building, built 650. convoluted reasoning able meet regulations numbers toilets (essentially counting restrooms parts building students access to). 

At end school year, asked space 30 desks classroom 6 feet apart. literally even close amount square footage necessary. 

I want go back classroom. want kids school. we've running schools capacity, overcrowding rooms hallways, underpaying teachers paras places creating big teacher shortages cutting paras altogether. gap things currently run able take basic precautions like 6ft space individual supplies smaller classes monumental, government public whole seem interested filling gap. 

These leaves schools options outside split schedule one wants. They're furloughing nurses Oklahoma. I'm sure anywhere else. Honestly gave pretty early formal education, would likely year. figure working garden, cooking, watching science videos reading books fuck close enough third grader. 

Summer ""look watch YouTube play Minecraft day otherwise care wear PJs multiple days row."" 

I know perfect Pinterest color coded subject planning types it. Sorry, never happen. Different mentality. mean? America's winning every metric Trump probably improved handicap summer. SIL pay right hold nephews' spots, even though going daycare. Best luck family. That’s awesome thank you! lived among 10 years, confirm case. approximately 8000 8000 untreated heart attack cases died. didn’t die lack healthcare resource. died misunderstanding risks life.

I agree heart attacks, worth rish go.

But there's bunch patients. ding new baby mix option many. 

wasn't pre-corona either. kids money pits would done differently known year advance Coronavirus pandemic coming? 

Something I've thinking lately, can't honestly say sure plan would states did. governors keep getting threatened murder. states didn’t. can’t make statements governors. “Science truth real” lesson, people need learn people deepest rabbit hole conspiracy theories “alternative facts.”

But, depressingly, imagine least people realize mistake parents start end ICU unthinkable numbers. apparently mistakes China, Italy, New York etc weren’t enough new places keep making new versions mistakes. Maybe USA light coronavirus pandemic, much SERE instruction already conducted online

*This real thing* I’m Disney fan sites it’s true, anything go absolutely care risk. cast members part forum expressed fear reopening fans basically told shove it. turned brutal group I've worked 6 years degree. Started helpdesk person worked sys admin job company. make almost nearly mother, 30 year veteran public school teacher Masters + 30 does. absolutely ridiculous. 900 beds pretty good. Florida gonna go back lockdown what? atleast close non essentials. still doubling test results antibody + regular covid test time? result show positive anyone ever covid time, necessarily right now. still month ago separating data. One easiest ways spread shared food utensils. salad tongs, spoons scooping sides, butter knife etc. Asia. Back March, people already wearing masks. You’d stand didn’t wear one people call out. really appreciate insight.

I idea appreciate helping understand.

How feel measures? Ohh yea disband task force. Sounds likea great fucking idea!!!😅😂😥😨😰 

I’m American idea word means. like disability? sort brand slogan? don’t get it! Single dad works service industry, difficult. Luckily unemployment gone yet still money saved. also learned I'm terrible teaching preschool/kindergarten. bond son gotten stronger going me. They're trying hit big million first. world paying people take care kids, future society.

I work IT, completely remote.

My wife Phd makes 40% less me.

It kills think fact train become manual QA testing make work remote.

But professional pride makes us go route. hope take better care important public workers future. Nah party e earlier. friend affected possible despite virus’s lower mortality rate age group still killed without existing conditions foreshadowing September gonna like schools open name least three single women children full time jobs right now. stupid post. Y’all need toughen up. It’s political asshats like make whole thing possible. there’s problem, find someone else blame. I’ll tell what. Maybe Trump parroting losers like convinced enough freedumb loving people wear masks. ashamed yourself. hope go ship. certainly impacts essential workers much more, impacts every working parent affluent enough afford full-time nanny. white collar professional, senior management, two kids home (my company immediate plans return office assured everyone work home long want need), husband resident physician works long hours hospital, way many student loans afford nanny. I’ve spent past 3-1/2 months full-time mom teacher addition working 50-60 hours per week. found schools (which start first week August) online/remote instruction least Labor Day, literally started crying. OK bubs Florida Department Health dashboard shows data well. working parent, agree lot article, she’s right difficulty struggle, don’t agree perspective it’s “system’s” job fix this. It’s caused virus. It’s conspiracy hurt working parents. It’s every business close it’s hard working parents. Sometimes things unfair. There’s entitlement life perfect fair time. true. shouldn’t gotten point first place. That’s failure leadership need solve November. unaware easy coast school started early year. used start begining September. That's slowly pushed back start mid late August...
We received something school super vague.

We starting school, unclear look.

Although almost information, pleased message. told working it. LA? that’s case Cali blame going DeSantis? Florida also huge state. think DeSantis catastrophic job, I’m also pointing inconsistencies logic. Can’t pick choose fit narrative 1700 currently hospitalized TMC. 320+ new hospitalizations 6/30. 7-8% growth rate Awww 🥺 poor snowflakes ❄️ able visualize realize impact it, mourning.

The numbers large comprehend properly like OP said, get numb them.

So think OK dine restaurants / go bar etc.

The support draconian measures hard numbers understandable individual, empathy dead. can't get Tuesday!

florida texas damn sure gonna try prove wrong kinda baffling, ain't it? 

I mean, be, is, post Danish employers firing Danish employees somehow still Sweden's fault. absolutely true, trashy Mexican - case - mean Mexicans like this. Speak puto. strep throat corona? China hoarding good stuff allowing limited exports inferior PPE. I've received surgical masks made China pandemic quality difference remarkable. also received 1000 masks last month Taiwan they're definitely quality masks. think done fantastic job none delays mixed incorrect messages blame?

I don’t know anyone look situation absolve missteps attack critics ignorant.

They done terrible job. Defending attacking doesn’t change that. podcast Joe Rogan back March it, worth listen requirement (and expectation) parents work full-time outside home fucked us point.

I mean, yes, construct society parent choose stay home child think required. Lots parents want work outside home. Good thing candidate advocating child care reform help Andrew Yang! I'm glad nominee! like Chinese response... Serbia invited advisors Wuhan three months ago help us cope epidemic turning Belgrade new Wuhan... clear, that's Mexico wanting close border *their* side. weeks delay test results. news, 2 + 2 still equals 4. US adversary undoubtedly taking note easy society brought virus compared rest world. needs nuclear weapons conventional forces see results like this! feel like one things turned really dangerous. first wave, second wave talk gave people feeling virus going disappear time without anything citizens Florida testing positive include travelers? we're probably aware true number cases, likely testing enough people get large enough cross-section sample.

That is, rate growth probably accurately represented numbers have, totals probably low. still trust 2x growth rate 7 days. several weeks ago Texas reached capacity. shared pro-life / disability rights circles time getting sub. Knock Unless virus size neutrino. mask better nothing. It’s ok risk everything? I’m unclear mean lol thing data, would assume ""excess death number"" definite, right? 

I mean ... would expect like ""Well 12,000 deaths that's 2,000 normal, 1,000 Covid deaths reported that's 1,000 missing deaths might Covid.""

But actually read methodology Excess Deaths data, see based issues like potential under-reporting data delays, basically *estimate* number total deaths region. know reading CDC data also assume regional death totals *lower* average .. (perhaps fewer people dying lockdown conditions?) .. get ""ignored"".

So turns ""Well 12,000 total deaths 2,000 normal"" ""We *estimate* 12,000 total deaths would hypothetically 2,000 normal estimations accurate"". keep listening liein POS right knew masks effective told us ware them! believe that's good thing. people cannot afford children decided reproduce, many biggest problems species would simply evaporate. think would great every child born enough resources set aside live happy, healthy lives. 

Either good outcome. threshold masks social distancing can't slow spread virus? wear orange mask look watch YouTube play Minecraft day otherwise care wear PJs multiple days row

Are me? wonder people trust experts anymore experts consistently spread false information.

When new research comes okay change opinion. article poor dude everything right went friends house caught covid died days later. aake hope CA made legal tho. 2nd wave real blast. us see One meme remember back around March/April:

“This one chance save world sitting home watching Netflix. Don’t fuck up” LOL. nursing student way comparable situation. Also shitty human probably saved human lives you. What? wasn’t obvious wrote comment? Lol people reporting pneumonia deaths, fall death covid, cover deaths covid calling something else.. Well don’t people drinking bleach anymore plus guess Lol Biden going right sinking ship.. learn swim USA  bright spot whole Covid-19 pandemic wife work home taking care baby born pandemic started. know true is, brief annecdote worth: mom lives Pasco County, four symptoms, doctors get test. said they're hard come right think needs one, she'll it. tested Strep called day. Russia driving force behind antivax nonsense human stupidity? Cool study says large gatherings don’t spread virus!? go back gatherings then? Please share. believe must willful ignorance. Believe me, March New York State, definitely knew asymptomatic spread. anyone following pandemic, information easy find. sure. great kids growing steady peer group meets outside school. similar situation lot friends. issue I’m thinking (may completely wrong, would like hear thoughts) ineffective middle ground containment. 
 
As obviously social distancing, many things shut lower capacity, yet country properly handling this. People aren’t wearing masks. spread rate lead natural herd immunity like allowed spread pre-industrial society (or whatever call western society 1920 Spanish Flu). 

The outcome prolong years without properly addressing it. 

The informed opinion, want put there. I’m hoping conjecture correct, heavy mismanagement government many levels (federal state), much hope. thoughts? 

The best case scenario mind Biden takes office January, appeals unity, maybe actually works people sick shit? knows. vaccine programs require federal management distribute vaccines properly reduce transmission. Idiocracy introduced president Camacho 2006. Feels like many people took movie way serious Its. trump. marginalized centuries. don’t want talk blame. help going forward. There's Harry Potter World? tests come back positive.

This vote governor. couple years ago let us Florida Silver passes go park July, we're usually blacked going. was...moist. lasted hours headed dark, air-conditioned bar sun went down. I'm Florida native much. maybe someone actually coughing mask keep wearing it? invincible bud, happen anyone initial decision provide coronavirus treatment instead sending patient hospice triage decision? areas looking like cases rising sharply hospitals reaching capacity. thinking calling triage decision become common occur cases seem obvious decision make seems germane environment discussion. bothered witch hunt Reddit everyone ready pull pitch forks, vote dollar buy Tesla. reminds news used say chocolate good bad every couple months,I kept eating snickers regardless. Judging ability descend ramp, pretty clear handicap gotten worse.  said comments, people coming big surf beaches, fireworks, bars going TJ. friend gun reckless way likely killed him. article mentions man self quarantined weeks prior finally going BBQ. would hard case prove got way. never said said website doesn’t mention vaccinations anywhere violence Cant upvote comment enough! I'm saying another shutdown, making point another one bad.  don’t system allows federal government order nationwide lockdown 

Blame constitution 

3 million 360 million weren’t locked down

Rounding error 

And certainly close enough government work. tried tell people hoard toilet paper. Didn’t work. even told regular people buy N95s ignored Nah. exactly figure that? family tested positive coronavirus March mom cough. like close 50% cases, didn’t even symptoms, despite fact underlying lung condition. 

My grandmother died lockdown, caught virus: suffered dementia, like thousands Alzheimer’s patients US, simply stopped eating lockdown room day. 

Meanwhile, father’s small business bankrupted family’s source income gone. I’m part problem lost family member lockdown measures? lockdown ruined family financially? don’t subscribe hysteric news agenda essentially non-stop fear porn? Yes. Shes wearing scarf goes wearing masks makes dizzy says. going even claims open spaces like parks. think knows could've killed talking blames ""evil people"" releasing it. literal trump worshiper. They've moved ""Deaths down"" ""Masks work."" -Agent Smith mean take personally. Everybody hold Jerome Adams responsible. SURGEON GENERAL lied us masks. Yes, everybody local national news repeated misinformation. one PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE starting spreading information. 

Jerome Adams BETRAYED COUNTRY. betrayed us all. fact something worth remembering, recording history books, teaching children grandchildren. think lot people unaware, need spend money they're earning less. 

It's tough spot many people. According rt.live Fl barely nudged r0 this. need get control. fuck government there? could grossly malignant towards constituents? have, not. Whenever go store see full compliance - live well-educated area Pittsburgh proper, areas county may different.

Bars seem culprit recent spike, that's reflected infected population whose median age 29. bars closed, mask requirements strengthened, hopefully we'll see trend back days.

You're correct we've quite lucky, here. chalk entirely luck - people pretty sensible masks distancing, exceptions. agenda? Sounds like mass protests don’t spread virus going beach I’m one agenda. 

Can point study says mass gatherings safe? can’t would destroy whole body gathering’ argument. I've read [Disney fully booked February people want go bad :( 


Universal seeing super low turn-out also laid ton employees Disney Springs. I'm honestly worried inevitable second shut-down parks mean people get laid-off instead furloughed receiving reduced wages. get it. doctor agreed treat Remesvidir would require intubated wife want that. since severe brain injury medical team decided best alternative hospice. anyone actually read article what? Holy shit! real? Fucking KANE mayor?!?!? least county, getting tested ER ICU requires admittance, option everyone. Many outpatient testing centers reporting shortages closing early. article yesterday day stated hospitals Florida receiving less test kits daily samples testing getting really backed up. don’t much time something. better delay August hope best Damn. Imagine guys co-operated even bit masks distancing thing. agree you, use sister example point. moved hospice, cancer every single bone body. point, nutrition feeding cancer. Truly, feeding tube placed would feeding cancer prolonging suffering. slowly starve death. body gave riddled cancer. think culturally, BC little different.

We strongly suggested mask rules inconsistent compliance US. far compliance enforced lockdown. childhood friends stay-at-home mothers, parents would pay let hang house day. family help. realistic everyone, great solution cheaper formal child care.  around large groups people probably get tested. want infect others asymptomatic. Aahh okay know daycare worked like that, yes would evened out, can't expect donate daycare forever money saved secure families survival case something changes worse. okay Ok - political party considered. voted menace fought prevent/remove socialized healthcare programs, lack morality concern ones fellow humans disqualify triage. wonder logistics work. literally killed him. Directly knowingly. orphan drug shortage everywhere. better save patients chance survive. family refused intubating patient. refused care complained bc get care. GTFO here.  new problem. risk factors fairly clear point. 

Three biggest factors 1. exposure affected 2. proximity others 3. length time around others.

Indoor transmission much likely outdoor. problem them. parents jobs... every summer? seems wild two month break childcare every year.

Summer camps vacation. Um... wrong? Got kid, one way, fiancee work full time Alternative trials testing refers pharmaceuticals/treatments within current standard care.

You can't trial things also development. love Harry Potter World it’s near attraction Disney World is. kids, REALLY think many adults eager go Disney amusement parks (I could wrong guess). know adults love amusement parks, feel really small percentage. adults get dragged amusement parks due kids. parent, pandemic still going around, amusement park really high list places visit, long while. rather take kids road trip national park, beaches, camping, trail biking, fishing, etc., Also, decent financial security / job security right (thankfully), absolutely spending frugally next 6 months least. guys mandated wear masks least? Man, hope easier go did. seems like offer diagnosis even borderline. way kids gets access help needs. reevaluate later see kid stands. seems better denying kid treatment he's fence it. 

It's money, fair. I'm working life time stresses raised broken home. Last thing want screw kids. wife working bunch issues well. plus totally outgrew 3 bedroom apartment need figure better living situation. sorted we'll probably pull trigger third. wife really wants it, I'm kinda either way. want turn 45 wake regrets.

Edit: also recently diagnosed low testosterone. Like insanely low reason. go hoops making sure tumor somewhere whatever. end replacement therapy, effectively sterilize since nuts work whatever. Kinda puts us position option another years might table. doubled every 1.5-2 days precautions taken. I’m mailing obituary Trump.

Hopefully ends way around. live philly intense protests rioting happened. No, people involved wearing masks practicing social distancing.

It's clear fully understand timelines virus. example, Georgia, took literally months case counts spike fully reopening.

If to, I'd wager first round people get virus Philly protests Atlanta bars young healthy. remain asymptomatic never get sick enough get tested. give cohort (or GrubHub customers) eventually grandma gets tested hospital. drags timing substantially.

It might something else, something delaying cases. Philly protests increase spread nothing short street orgies will. Kind weird standards holding representatives to. U.S., standards fallen low anything even marginally Donald Trump *you're gonna eat gonna like help me...!* going long time, maybe never, edge back lowest standards modern civilization. One, LA surrounded conservative counties residents work LA. 

Second, LA dense population densely packed neighborhoods. believe also couldn’t shut Metro (public transportation) essential workers needing lockdown.

Third, people don’t take seriously. everyone wearing masks social distancing. gut feeling will. past decisions indicator, least reasonable course action taken, means schools = open. realize post may confusing. state locked couple months back. Parents able work home, holding kids expectation like always would charged time kids there. say us parents ""well off"" pretty middle class. provider asked us still earning paycheck please continue paying even child family survived. could jerk forced issue wanted let us know order ""save"" child's spot would to.

Eventually daycare's centers went lock providers could collect unemployment, started receiving longer required pay her. Sure, start link someone saying never end next time. Otherwise may find great argument killed straw man. weeks ago took Uber reading app drivers passengers wear masks. minutes ride driver started berating 'sheep' wearing mask. left car sent message Uber app got following email, exactly fill confidence Uber takes seriously.

##### Sent Sanjeet M. Friday, June 5, 2020 5:55:37 PM Okay, ask solution would easy would think countries would current state in? 

There solution right now. cure. luck hoping body infected able hold off. 

Sorry real answer no. Lmao Much larger R value? Even IFR flu, spread 5x fast, would kill 5x people flu.  Similar story different states USA. death rate confirmed cases Connecticut 9.3% California 2.6%. It’s also 1.4% Texas 0.7% Utah, know better use states example Reddit.

It’s testing. 2 10 every 1000 people die (I think closer 2, it’s heavily skewed age demographics exact ratio probably isn’t important). higher CFRs primarily mean infections weren’t caught testing. I’ve already explained reasoning. I’m again. Go ahead make sliding scale speculative model rate infection. one you. 

-stay safe sure it'll go far. Full disclosure, I'm Canadian thinking hoping praying guys elect Biden would back normal gets. Businesses governments would happy logic. USA's standing hasq diminished, doubt; backing Iran deal makes country sure dealing anymore regardless who's power. Barking NATO spending 5x much rest world defense cutting funding would laughable troubling. math...China coming. GDP GDP. Btw, nice big heat wave coming much America...

And even bigger spike covid starting fourth July weekend doubt. Younger people still need trust me. may get quicker still risk put hospital matter age likely  5th amendment relates self incrimination. refusing talk investigators obstructing investigation. silence situation crime. charged crimes violating public health orders right self incriminating would kick in.

This constitutional issue, it’s obstructing public health investigation. don’t answer subpoena contempt fined that. think ubiquity smartphones GPS ushered Uber? say: imagine Uber able operate without smartphones/GPS considering workload taxis decades without technologies? 

It's easy say taxis offer high level service technology there. Ah yes, yes. learned masks work... It’s goddamn medical breakthrough! face attempted murder charges. were, many people hospital covid total texas admitted hospital yesterday. Hey thanks!

I’ve watched lot Pittsburgh Dad. It’s really unique, fun little dialect. Mind family owned place. fast food chain anything. lobbies closed sit-down places shifted back take delivery only.  many people put ventilator survive. goes theory. virus affects organs. probably plan shortened life. never seen people laid back damage virus does. Obviously, know anyone virus. yhe flu!! Impossible 80,000 cases place started. *Checks profile*

*Posts r/conservative*

Absolutely shocked, believe it? slash another billion NYPD. Sure, take him! Dunno from, assume us giving would improve countries. Situation seems grim.

I wonder causing america southern border states surge cases well I'm AZ people saying similar things here, real struggle get tested. manage get test, unusual wait week results.

I hope feeling better soon. poor baby, Europe you.  


 
\*goes store mask Great well-sourced read. I'll spreading around! fact link reputable studies, selectively misquotes support thesis. read studies see myself.

For example, study ""**Offeddu, V. et al. (2017)** "", quote made cobbled together several phrases throughout paper. quote appear original paper. paper found masks effective.

""**Radonovich, L.J. et al. (2019)** "" ""**Long, Y. et al. (2020)**"" studies comparing N95 vs regular surgical masks. studies found significant difference two, way attempted assess efficacy wearing mask all.

Scientists spend years decades write papers like article like misquotes even attributes falsehoods papers, find hugely disrespectful scientists. Misappropriating scholarly articles also erodes public trust science -- readers leave thinking (true) science hear news (e.g. support masks) disreputable. thing worried water moccasins. lot people acted (and still do) like exposure death sentence, said, small amount research would cleared time.  Literally. University Washington already outbreak due fraternities resulting 36 sick students. University Mississippi fraternities also linked outbreak. Alabama students throwing COVID parties see get COVID first (deadass). little taste fall! last 3 weeks. learned masks work. Got it.    





Edit: I'm arguing whole ""masks bad. wear"" thing **i wear mine religiously**. layed wearing one dickhead went tv saying infected people symptoms wearing them. Less month ago occurred. I'll search find goddam video .   





Edit 2: ok folks right. I'm wrong. Searched interview. 60 minutes one. appeared much later social media via anti maskers - interview March. Back Fauci definitely orders high say masks useless. Fast fwd pandemic times now. Social media posted clip needing masks though June. Death statistics everywhere. Tests explain mess. look NYC case, think test?
It's simple. City attorney trying intimidate talk threatening fine. Yes please stop contradicting Trump’s lies facts evidence. Wait, both. get rid one? He's sick wearing mask job *Arizona entered chat* Fucking kickass analogy  sure that's true. seems pretty evenly split party lines. Even Trump anti-vaxxer. exponential growth we’re actually catching testing for! distance learning nearly effective. student able participate, lots student struggled online platform. think school 60% participation gen ed high school level. Perhaps better fall since teachers training still struggle. 

I think social emotional health huge thing well. kids isolated friends long time. stuck home stressful situations parent may struggling feed them. real effect kids widening socioeconomic education gap wife feels way too. hospital didn’t really seem consider possibility. continued show symptoms COVID recovery.. remember talking chest pains shortness breath occasionally. Sort Similar link posted “long haulers”. mention respiratory illnesses influenza known sometimes trigger rhabdo. Idk. sucks. Hoping good come this. wish whole country could’ve done real lockdown 3 weeks-1 month like New Zealand did. know people would’ve annoyed time, would thankful thoughts wearing mask? everyone wear them? happened states relatively straightforward. states opened early without following White House gating criteria (which checkpoints). also opened aggressively ""all nothing"" approach opening everything once.

It's simple - put people together, virus spreads. virus around, spreads. situations occurring together, virus spreads exponentially.

-Dr. Kohli Clinical guidelines sources (these guys source well situation evolving fast go sources make mind): current source testing infection data (download dailies want build decent model. Supplement mortality expectation gross lack complete testing): still curious feel comfortable interpreting primary sources PM send best whitepapers subject. I'm director decision support strategic planning healthcare - I've combing literature since beginning give weekly seminars. Yeah doctors part makes sense seemed like wife want intubated either. weird part hospice care really starve him? First, thank kind words. yes, different versions/wordings we’ve said since happened. knows best could information time. It’s more...idk guess personal, know us, coworker would still (most likely) alive family.  work fitness studio coaching group workouts 0 ventilation members wearing masks...
Why still open Go live middle freak. Make sure don’t use technology, grow food, don’t use Reddit especially. swear people belong Middle Ages. Nah, unless dying body fighting producing antibodies, get atleast short time immunity. basically virus live together, like getting infected daily. can't infected already infected, recover first give kind immunity, maybe weeks, maybe months years, enough time recover. NYC could handle help nurses across country, next time extra nurses split best, worst,not able leave home area Ah, yes. people outside wearing masks following social distancing blame. Got it. 

Seriously. protesters blamed some, lot also people don’t follow rules. wearing mask political statement there’s something wrong. women don’t children whatever reason cash cows now. Im single never married kids. work like dog dental surgery. I’m rolling money options I’ve ever life. played well I’ve never happier choices I’ve made. Women atrocious past time money own. always felt like good enough woman didn’t become mother. love life I’m sorry anymore. I’d give shirt back help you’re still gonna like anyways. didn’t probably won’t either. Oh well can’t win . mean, fairness, like relatively recreation options, sex cheap, fun, plentiful. We've banging like bunnies since start whole thing. Fortunately also two excellent methods birth control, we're highly unlikely end 3rd kid. see would happen couples, though. preview days. booked regular days January February might abundance optimism point. didn’t want fight crazies waited evening. still plenty days July August lunatics, I’ll reassess six months, thanks. Michigan got hit hard, responded, lower numbers LOT states- especially considering bad things April. recovery amazing.

Yea, Michigan numbers look pretty good, comparatively. actually look like complete first wave. Let's hope avoid second. NBA... resistance science real consequences. Imagine threatening murder haircut. Canada fucked early (we 9000 dead tenth population US) lagged US couple weeks barely managed get shit together. People getting complacent here, I’m sure second (smaller) wave come soon.   Idk, gotta make sure hospitals aren’t overrun... that’s whole point flattening curve. It’s either rolling lockdowns contact tracing strict lockdown get cases insignificant numbers. Hospitals war zone right now. friend working ER LA says it’s like horror movie. Technically guess lol. see several comments seem place blame solely Fauci. cluster fuck belongs entire tRump Administration, starting him. Exactly this. Americans literally divided everything go killing choice coffee. say ""Most Americans think/feel"" anything proves people know nothing. surprising, common argument every politician. Mask compliance pretty good am, live Pittsburgh proper. Non-compliance may issue proceed outward urban core. think biggest problem opening bars. they're closed again, think get control, though expect spike continue little trend reverses. July past, confirm bad. Hot humid. park still packed. would think real feel 107 degrees would stop people going park. Honestly, beginning think fair call fear mongering numbers. people would taken seriously actually put forth sort effort wearing masks social distancing would luxury right looking back numbers saying ""man, remember people though would 10k new cases day?"", instead people assholes blew hear basically living worst case scenario. obviously totally preventable, infuriating things got control could taken basic steps make much bearable. Indefensible lack governing. “Super Saturday”? queuing, limited capacity, can’t go bar, can’t meet family friends there, plastic cups, live music, give name contact details entering. Sounds like blast! Count out. figured going work watching damn colonists across pond? Good maybe United States follow suit... mean I'm smoker would love someone make law would quit regarding second barrier - dark money. Let's ignore ""our freedom/masks kill"" thread since really linked anything practical. would really benefit state closing enough pressure DeSantis public business will? tourism think - can't expect good quarter even open, medical field - they're getting overwhelmed, think small business part dark money. 


Who really benefits mess? Here's say skepticism better cynicism.  think healthy time want question would shutter economy weeks order try quash virus.  ok cynical here. Makes bad decisions. Colorado quite well, and, believe, something early decisions close along early spike.  would say handle like anything days. civil conversation someone elects continue stay uncivil, maybe time walk away. -- Chris Vanderveen bathrooms - public otherwise. Suffered? Good question. I'm going read paperwork given get back you. might used right terminology. People love hating mouse think one reason one want release information Aftonbladet, even respond them. think summed quite nicely. quite like *lot* I've read Aftonbladet, *lot* also pure I'm LWR want stuff get shut down. time, wanna launch Bird Key paddle boarding. think fine I'll around others. people see out, figure too. get elected. Studies ready shown theory incorrect. think still applies. Parents still pay before/after school care camps holidays days off. 

I know someone used pay $1000 month before/after school care kids, covid hit, complained hard home school kids also working full time. convinced put $1000 towards part time private tutor said kids learning back school  Covid Beaches closed Miami-Dade Broward county infections are, bars. probably close restaurants Miami-Dade least mayor asshat, fair want Florida county lock things again, even that's needs happen. South Florida one biggest risks 4th July probably house parties, there's much legislate that. A) Passing virus contact surface considered rare non-existent. B) Cat's health matters. Trust Vets safe. Agreed learned Wesley Star Trek.  both, ppl done hundreds years. bs must change lives virus .63% death rate outrageous, changed much cancer, even flu, changing Yeah, are! they’ve lived long enough decide 🤷‍♀️ death lagging metric. lag every step way. First exposure... lag.. positive case... lag... hospitalizations... lag.. come deaths. deaths occur 3-4 weeks infection exposure 2-3 weeks case counts increase. - Dr. Kohli New York, New York city?

Because outside NYC even bad, florida giant city people live like rats NY stress, health care workers U.S. went help out. Now, many states pressure, chances get help need? mean also 20 kids. 4 kids would cover two employees salaries workmans comp + taxes cliche, would spot. turned hysterical mess found out. I'm 6'4 guy built like linebacker, work firefighter. Takes lot get emotional job definitely stunted emotions necessity. man, mess first. 

When kid, somehow different. time getting worked brother brother. Nothing course think people dickheads it.

And course figure lying, knows, may come covered something resulted deaths serious illness people.

To fight pandemic really think others people ourselves, there'll always small majority triggers twats. can't stop tell people serious consequences.

I mean people subpoenaed, worth telling lies? understand is, death count remains relatively low. What's reason this? get wrong, good thing, puzzles me. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* quiet. Perhaps hunting wabbits. [Johns Hopkins shows say it’s “flattening” flattened past week. It’s good number right small good sign. Idk british columbia nothing mandatory. full complete lock downs. non essential businesses closed yet still allowed go jogs, hikes, etc. Non essential travel strongly discouraged also. lasted nine weeks. People complied measures strict. also helped government deferred leadership health officer like disappointed mother saw people complying. boat, I'm 15 years in, making good living now, degree certs. Thanks censorship bot, cool! numbers still skewed fundamentally exposed test negative retested within days weeks, test positive not. skews positivity rate lower. Another? live? state said y'all wear mask please? bars. Carry on. 

Most U.S watched N.Y peak shutdown numbers started falling said ""Whew. it."" virus chance root states/cities. Metro area school districts announcing reopening plans elementary schools social distancing due “cohorting” plans county health departments indicating children 10 aren’t proven spread virus. seems odds national / global guidance distancing important limit spread. local guidance children spreading virus accurate, convenient answer get schools reopened?

Also, PPE classroom teacher wearing teach seven hours day room 25 children?  mixed average median. would substantial step right direction hopefully Walz picks it. I'm Minnesota though we're looking okay numbers (&lt;4% positive rate, dropping hospitalizations ICU usage) needs something done we're among states start see high spikes. 


Experience may vary people state I've seen parks/beaches full weather masks/distancing happens, bars/restaurants _full_ likely past limited capacity following (likewise point many people dining indoors rather outdoors) grocery stores part masks used hired shoppers (like Instacart, Shipt) employees. Originally testing people confirmed symptoms. bias tests applied. 

So way knowing rates actually higher now. Yes, shows Florida become new epicenter pandemic southern states reopened early daily cases NY March they’re less it. [Infection Rate FL batch people tested today likely infect average 13,800 people. that's today... EXACTLY.

Because respirator machines scarce ressource.

A lot people need die covid. flattening curve important. need available bed machines whoever unlucky bad covid (which happen young people too, btw, less probable) idea flatten curve initially meant overwhelm hospital system could buy little bit time make decision put ventilator let die, like countries. ultimate metric success. metric success ""crush curve"" make cases go away ""flatten curve"" prevent hospitals getting overwhelmed.

An analogy like hemorrhaging (bleeding wound) lockdown meant put pressure wound could repair it. point, keep holding pressure repair wound, means New Zealand get rid cases altogether.

In states like Texas, make decisions put ECMO (artificial heart-lung machine) due lack hospital beds. Colorado, yet, lift lockdown binary manner open flood gates, situation.

I use ""could"" - get bonus points?

Well point it'd stop going up....there's many people live there. yeah good constant ridicule shaming do, nada. seeing deaths right now? Cases thru roof, deaths not--and low daily death rate cannot attributed primarily ""lag.""

Why that? Anyone infected public treated like zombie ""The Walking Dead."" forget NBA! First Amendment

People suing him, ""news"" outlets downplayed severity virus, role exacerbating virus's spread. think one network denied bad virus air, behind scenes practiced social distancing took seriously.  Agreed. good time right now, we'll see long restrictions last though. presumably germs inside body whatever could give him/her/them whatever amorous activity choose WASN’T like developed countries. Yup. That's too. Remember yelled reporters extremely confidently nothing going happen? funny. media manipulates creating narrative. us digest media bs filters place think ourselves. That's irritates people condescendingly accuse bring manipulated media when, yes, exactly said. swallow hook, line, sinker. public schools ""no curriculum"" days well. School boards first infected tea partiers, textbook companies long infected white Christian dominionists, egged said school boards. Teacher's unions also first targeted right-to-work laws, effectively eradicated unions many states.

Texas petri dish this: point, safe say half American school-age children taught anti-intellectual racist nonsense twelve years.

Three events, one every 25 years, driven conservative race-baiting, prompted shitstorm: Brown v. Board (1955), rise religious right election Ronald Reagan (1980), Tea Party movement (2008). Sprinkled across five decades takeover school boards ""taxpayer"" groups explosion subsequent decline segregation academies (mostly Catholic). White folks need segregation academies anymore they've created de facto segregation means. agree statement, went two different private religious schools kindergarten end high school, guarantee definitely curriculum sorts nearly level rigor necessary day age. shocked started teaching public school podunk school was, friends schools situations. also scoped private religious schools area live (greater Charlotte, NC), couple massive well funded ones actually pretty good, terrible.

It’s really difficult link cases things like that. Many people get diagnosed, idea got it. possible meant *only* wealthy women could career well-attended children way today nannies, etc.

I family friend whose widowed mother worked full time back day (1930s 1940s). basically responsible young age mother simply available look one else. bail last second. much pressure people. hate many us right this. I’m tired saying, “I told so”. ran tests last week, got fewer positive results. no, flattened. told this? straight hurricane season Considering bad inside think indoor restaurants need shut. 


Beaches though probably harm reduction. Outdoor transmission still uncommon. we're going go authoritarian enough lock people homes, outside probably safest place. stop going beach, they're going crowd other's homes far worse. Highest record, far. horrible. possibly victim vast irresponsibility displayed telling people 'rarely' spreads asymptomatic. Although think people pretty much responsible educating day age, CDC failed horribly telling people masks matter early on, failed horrible number times.

I wonder people trust experts anymore experts consistently spread false information. decreasing testing? work ICU anything increasing testing everyone, symptoms symptoms, employees patients. Good luck, Joan Greene! Lol even bringing death statistics, really bothers we're allowing effectively destroy economy numbers fabricated. real disease, get wrong, reactions drastic could also fact nursing homes weren’t really protected beginning people nursing homes much higher mortality rate ICU admissions. think messes lot data especially hospitalizations deaths. Even trust chinas numbers think confidently say took virus seriously US. Several states straight denial mode right cases literally break records daily. going bad southern US, multiple case studies unmitigated exponential spread. know, Disney refunding prorated portion cost season passes? sure glad pulse oximeters ordered parents arrived. fall gonna fun one I'm curious though, friend group position planning kids anyway? kinda opportunistic thing sense? don’t know it’s whining. reporting facts. way shipping logged via air hides details would useful know point. untrue? think hearing somehow blaming airline industry reading this. real point is: US leadership actively trying make buck instead thinking might also need supplies. could also look trying help trading partner. airline industry certain regulations make difficult trace details transaction. Implication: change regulations works better future. Edit: added details. knew supposed sex people quarantining? 

Oh, wait, would everyone basic common sense. It’s percentages.

120,000 known millions cases infection died.

And approximately 8000 8000 untreated heart attack cases died. didn’t die lack healthcare resource. died misunderstanding risks life. rest world preparing schools open Fall see cases fall precipitously due strong leadership fast comprehensive action. could absolutely open Fall good leadership so, currently foreseeable future don't. smart precautions might better take That’s right wasn’t Dale found John Redcorn affair? might want tp read CORAL study Cedars-Sinai report circulation issues.

Houstonian feel like blanket dust also keeping temps gulf also helps. sure scientifically accurate June pretty mild terms high temps. Common sense surprisingly common America I’m six days test still results. I, luckily, stay home work get paid, lot people can’t- especially without confirmed test. father, lives me, ill. Chances already 20,000. cases per 100,000 still higher Philly. Pittsburgh catching last week so. Philly currently ~50 per 100,000, Pittsburgh ~34. logistical nightmare. stay home mom 13 years youngest (6) started kindergarten last year. immediately got part time job working 9-3 school days, wanted something help contribute money family. 

I quit 2 weeks shut kids needed help husband (who earns enough support us) needed focus work.

I know I'll ever able work again. family fortunate husband great job done remotely. quite dense...

Ofc numbers low, doubling rate fast.

If 500 active cases per day, 500 cases begin with, increase rate week 600%!

But issue is, states already huge number active cases. still doubled. Cry it. multiple vaccines necessary produce billions doses needed meet demand across globe. drugmakers focused specific needs, like making shot lasts longer doesn’t require stringent cold-storage supply chains. course there’s potential unexpected setbacks failure. *desperately searches page 69 google trying find something says flu worse coronavirus ICU capacity. click available adult icu beds, click sorts lowest highest, keep clicking next page till find county spare bed doubt Disney open Every time mention local groups, certain people keep saying ""But many died?!""

They keep thinking like flu numbers intentionally exaggerated.

I tell hospitalizations deaths lag weeks. Also death that's worrisome, hospitalization well potentially detrimental health personal finances even survive.

They still get it. It’s though include mental disabilities, injuries, etc cause negative skew. think Global News CBC reported yesterday likely border remain closed least year. Unfortunately, one risk we're still letting travelers long claim going Alaska.

Edit: CBC. interview epidemiologist, discuss many experts predicting it'll closed long time. Good grief could told people buy make cloth masks like back April. Hell, could also told people wear sort face-coverings (i.e. scarfs, bandanas, t-shirts, etc...) Air flow physics. mask worth simply changes would directional breath cloud traveling head height to, worst, diverting breath cloud away going directly forward. major gives time virus particles pulled away **proper** ventilation someone breathes trail virus left behind maskless exhale.

In short: filtration not; air flow physics tells wearing mask inhibits flow exhales worth using increases efficacy maintaining physical distance indoors. country closed bars again? Hey, bring Kavanaugh this, lifting weights day. Nice. I'm curious ha ha. Happy Cake Day. didnt think like that. Agree deaths start rise act, everyone unstoppably fucked another month afterwards. wound better act soon  Stock market longer cares stability nation. Every make money leave quickly wind blows wrong direction.

This won’t last Fed runs carrots put stick. think much likely end disaster, like bar openings here, although suspect take longer cases spike again. said, additional precautions would recommend might make viable: One, reservation establishments (they ban month shows). Two, limiting group size four. Three, socializing tables (bars simply cannot pick-up joints anymore). People need stay seated using restroom. four, strict serving limits - one drink per hour per person, maximum three drinks per person per visit. People need decide long want stay ahead time book table correlating amount time. 

If reaction ""they might well stay home,"" would agree you. Full disclosure: decades, going drink huge part life, LOVED it. super involved local music scene. unusual spend 6 10 hours drinking public, consuming average 3 drinks hour, hugging, otherwise close contact average 6 per hour (at minimum). really get appeal. right now, cannot happen. I'm sorry time losing. I'm trying devalue experience. cannot happen. now. hugs result illness take weeks, months. close conversations, leaning within inch two hear trying say, result parents getting sick dying. would normally harmless flirting attractive person noticed seated table two could result one contracting virus otherwise come contact going infect several friends. 

So yes, stay home. Invite friend two socially distant happy hour, know things love going bar possible someday keep healthy now. now-former ECE (early childhood education) teacher, much appreciate post. transitioned cushy office job ECE years back burned former wanted work children. much loved working kiddos, found incredibly difficult, financially - I'm single person kids. full-time co-workers reliant government aid feed children. ended leaving job couple weeks ago feel safe risking getting Covid-19 working someplace felt kids staff members might danger.

And despite missing kids work, consider relatively lucky skills experience fall back luxury extended family help financially can't find job near future. 

As working ECE/childcare field: know lot people realize little teachers earn (some even get health insurance, despite working environment they're exposed sorts illnesses) much work do. busted ass start shift end shift, teacher quality program takes far reading ""The Hungry Caterpillar,"" serving juice crackers, putting kids naps. 

At quality center, teachers plan implement age-appropriate curriculum activities designed help children develop skills around literacy, fine- gross motor, social/emotional, science, math, technology, verbal skills, art, dramatic play, others. Teachers also perform in-depth assessments individual students, tracking progress dozens developmental skills ensure healthy growth identify potential areas concern. also daily weekly communications families, classroom management maintenance, planning large events holiday celebrations annual art show, keeping room hygienic, ensuring safety children - still remaining calm, patient, engaged children employing positive discipline techniques - far tougher yelling child making sit corner.

And I've learned teachers schools rare program was. teachers working understaffed, poorly managed facilities admin staff seem know care even basic best practices, hand-washing upon arrival. educational requirements enter field quite limited, too, meaning might poorly trained teachers showing working underfunded, poorly-resourced classroom care many kids, several may coming difficult home environments thus demonstrate challenging behavior regular basis. 


tl;dr: early-childhood education teacher far difficult people realize, work challenging poverty-level wages lack sufficient training. system needs overhaul. true Massachusetts. Everyone wearing masks social distancing. Indoor dining open almost everyone know want eat inside due virus. guy dumbass, also could listening Which, point, make less dumbass.

(I know said difference asymptomatic presymptomatic, given can't tell difference later, make better.) work accounting, bachelor’s degree post doc university brain research. make despite highly specialized skill set work significantly less. Parents already working kids home months unfortunately they’ll continue. 

Once people like realize options right shitty vs. really shitty instead living lalala everything fine fantasy world quicker get handle virus go back semi-normal. reality America ready open schools cause sick kids, staff, family members, people community. Statistically cause increase hospital capacity deaths force schools close anyways. Like said it’s shitty vs. really shitty. else would like get attending physician job? teleporting developed yet? happening country right physicians finish training move jobs.

It's also comical think someone passing problem 80 100% capacity restaurants physical distancing nearly masks worn correctly. Maybe I'll whole TIL post this, seeing people responded this! problem people (including me) buying black market cigarettes 150% markup widely available. budget (shit) smokes use sub grade tobacco.

Explain could state helped murder feel like starting post “this moron” you’re basically putting beliefs sharing link? don’t know many we’ve already enough studies masks work. Yeah, that's lot take on! imagine learning lot things handling engaging right formative growing up. kind attitude lot healthy panicking she'll behind dumb standardized tests whatever ways find anxious right - completely understandable! - think find ways make work going remembered closest us. 

If got energy, get set Google VR already. pretty cool little gimmick there's tons ed stuff it. find. Looks like Undertaker retired early  exactly right. put headline, idea. culpable one virus knew it, yet still interacted others anyway. noticed Covid19 symptoms blue way back March. woke fiancee's grandmother's house, quick visit, early symptoms starting show. Felt completely fine day drove there. can't describe sheer panic felt. myself, somehow spread virus grandmother. early days... attempts get Covid test (which never happened information poor) thinking knowing could make sure grandmother got treatment needed. can't stomach thought spreading something anyone else might kill them. Cases don’t mean shit. true death rate unknown could less thought. looking hospitalisations / death rate. 

If preventative measure like vaccine wouldn’t keep shutting down, we’d accept go herd immunity take risk. could dont know, fucking quit. Got called names many including supposed doctors.  Never doubt even surgical masks help wearer. four months US. Pandemics usually couple years. No, going throw hands say current situation going last forever wrapped neatly bow four months. year five this, fine, I’ll repeat myself. four. months. 

No one said we’re handling well. show said this? I’m also denying seriousness situation. show said this? I’m saying speaking grandiose terms (ten years! forever! new normal! never again!) four measly months little ridiculous. don’t know what’s going happen. Neither you. COVID isn’t special you’re claiming. highly contagious disease hardly something we’ve never seen before. 

Yes, horrifying case spike. denying that. feels like sub completely gone deep end, think step back it. meant learned Wesley guess. knew someone gunna call haha. There's LOT red tape go get licensed depending state in. Lots minimum regulations per kid type thing (food nutrition minimums, food prep requirements, sleeping areas, designated rooms based age groups, X number staff per designated age group, etc). want attract people assholes kids. parents expect kids actually taught things (so teachers certified licensed academic sense). Here, start day care home decided go licensed, want cease operations get license. Imagine long takes government agencies, inspections red tape.

Edited add: brought up, relevant article. Daycares designed handle e-learning school care/summer kids. That's however many different curriculums, however many grade levels individual lesson plans, varying levels assistance needed, even including special needs (IEP, 504's). Toss X number zoom classroom meetings trying get kid designated times, pay attention, participate, etc. Getting kids watch Khan Academy videos, focus, get distracted kids doing. Daycares going typically willing able without huge increase compensation staffing levels. leaves mom and/or dad work day come home attempt night? Kids possibly missing Zoom classroom lessons. deaths remain three five hundred range covid would ranked 3-7 top ten list causes death year. another spike, covid move solidly third Huh? understand basic math? Lol god damn Americans, teaching school. double testing positivity rate goes .4% serious problems... seems kids really get covid really spread comparison fails. look fantastic, thanks coming. United care PR. Yes since ‘worthy’ cause can’t blame spike it. small businesses beach goers. friends KILL friends America... 

I'm surprised tbh. Well, part problem many families can't get less two fulltime incomes part problem even could, healthcare system makes near impossible parents work part time. parents could work 24 hours per week, would get spend time kids. Instead force one parent always work fulltime whole family gets f'd health insurance, even total hours worked two parents one person working fulltime. Full agreement this. picked working job mother never thought strong enough able career children good job both, never felt desire children. women decision might clear cut me, evident try hands everything once, something going neglected suffer. career kids health marriage.. one suffer try all. think women able anything want - like men. mean everything want. freedom comes responsibility - make wise decisions. Pick want life good it. see men trying kill prove world mother father, women to? would never happen. stay home done best done. tried push harder people would rebel. Protest happened killing would happen real lock done Read history want. don’t. I’m talking spread virus. I’m saying didn’t start NYC spread west coast. would really benefit state closing enough pressure DeSantis public business will?

This really good question wish investigative reporting this.

My guess - totally backed evidence - maybe companies pressing immunity. meat agricultural industry big players.

I also read something several weeks ago talked lockdowns double edged sword Bezos. Amazon's profits surging lockdown disrupted manufacturing distribution Amazon lost money able keep enough inventory available. Bezos requesting needing sort exemption. remember full story, though.

I think Bezos talking DeSantis wonder retailers also concerned lockdowns mean shelves (virtual physical) would empty. paper towels, cereal, clothing, toys come somewhere assembled someone. part sourcing, manufacturing, distribution process disrupted, retailers lose money.

But know dark money wealthy influential people pull strings think focus deep pockets. Maybe reopen astroturf campaign backers? 

I know enough He’d pay tax USA. ""recovery period"" coronavirus highly variable largely depends sick even got virus. people asymptomatic really need ""recover"" didnt significant symptoms. hand, reporting symptoms months infection.

This different period someone infectious ""shedding virus"" secretions infect others. general, call someone ""noninfectious"" CDC recommends ""testing based strategy"" two consecutive negative tests coronavirus sure likely actively infectious others.

Some Health professionals also argued public dumb properly use mask use them, example touching front mask. missing purpose wearing cloth mask, namely protect others. Watch Fauci take mask testifying Congress -- nicely folds places away. Maybe perfect practice seems reasonable me. Can't blame that. teachers America probably well. Holy cow! headline thought fake rumour, appears authorities investigated confirmed.

There whole situation sucks. jail. think states like Arizona, Texas, Florida using surge capacities main plan? describe looks like healthcare system overwhelmed?

Smh One silver linings pandemic. believe it’s message authorities sending. countries, social distancing measures mandates businesses regardless. message provided government suggests dire situation must nipped bud, businesses generally self-regulate still make proper decisions. honesty, believe it’s America issues prominent.  TL;DR CDC director lied/worded bad, Fauci says perfect, general population want, think healthcare workers/sick heres Faucci actually said (**paraphrase** Mar8th video above)

"" right general public wearing them, might make feel better they're perfect protection people think is, may prevent some, also unintended consequences people touching face more. Right people thinking healthcare workers already sick"" learning immune response infection. seems robustness immune reposes may related degree infection. words, got sicker COVID may stronger immune response.

One study suggested 70% people coronavirus mount strong antibody response, 25% mount weak response 5% significant antibody response. know long antibodies last based coronavirus (like ones cause cold, SARS, MERS), think last 1-3 years.

In case, test came negative symptoms March, probably likely COVID rather antibodies ""waned"" decreased time..

Fuck people Reminder- I’ve waiting six days test results. numbers week behind actual cases. father sick - he’s 74.   Would gone back school instead working full time found people cities rocked protests likely stay home, perhaps due curfews enacted amid protests, or—especially places police** [**violently cracked **on demonstrators—fear getting caught mayhem**

so people ACTUALLY causing spikes (people 'going things' **INSIDE** aka grocery store, pharma, bars, restaurants, salons) staying home keep pandemonium - literally proving protests causing significant enough spikes compared former. LITERAL PROOF.

If look countries kept pandemic control, good lockdown longer 2 months gotten pandemic control. didn't, something wrong implementation lockdown. 

We (America) gotten pandemic control lockdowns patchy. places like New York good job, places like California, not. trying fix problems reversing opening multiple states, enforce mask wearing, etc.. 

Why Indian government that, instead, giving re-opening? population India poverty bit challenge. 

Poorer countries also managed keep control. poverty factor. large population complicate things, India federated system, state staff budget regulate themselves. think state country, individual states better poorer countries like Vietnam? point many variables accurately estimate cases poor countries excess deaths help slightly. Government going try rush thing out. applied protestors too? also exceeding legal gathering limit difficult time believing actually ignorant. suspect there’s personal investment opportunities awaiting pharmaceuticals get patient count high enough. always seems money dig deep enough.

L local Children's Hospital says 1/3 COVID+(symptomatic asymptomatic) patients shown Kawasaki disease-like symptoms. forget colleges opening back up. understand headline. says cases re-emerge starts single case community spread long time cases hotel quarantine. crazy thing is, LT.Gov. doesn’t single medical quality, override one top DR country, people believe LT.Gov. DR.

This proof education system broken (as many systems US).

This sad. Oh sorry, that? Sounds like yhose asshats month two ago wrong they're whole mockery shut em up. God people dense That's normal health care setting limited resources: eg. Organ transplants People saying since beaches opened Memorial Day far we’ve held steady. arent south. ID staff trying locate positive recovered patients various symptoms pools collect data, too.

It's really unpredictable mixed bag.

We see identified Post COVID Syndrome many times medical staff satisfied explanation there's clearly lab markers indicate active infection even though classified recovered.

When prepping COVID, volunteer COVID teams went crash courses prepared ID staff reading knew accurate time.

And lot was... wrong... slightly. misalignment. COVID causes lot issues we've never seen therefore names them.

Like China, saw research talked pulmonary embolisms blood clots form large arteries supply blood lungs.

But actually happens worse one name it.

My hospital developed language communicate shift rotation.

Like there's nothing officially talks blood changes. COVID patients. We've called SSB-S. Super Sticky Blood Syndrome. seep small veins lungs cause oxygen levels drop.

Not typical pneumonia. pulmonary embolism all. words describe something fully understand named yet.

I've become obsessed COVID teams name things.

Grossest blood name far BS-C Blood Syrup - COVID.

I cannot enjoy pancakes ever again. talking UK? UK one highest corinavirus death rates. nothing proud mentioning UK's response. It'll sort disappear. U r brave ❤️ also said grandparents expendable. numbers models get show filtered highlighted many occasions. Fed level likely troubling data looking at. also public opinion polls.

I'd guess mask flip flop occuring two sources data. already know prediction hardest hit states look like scrambling change PR messaging damage control. clearly said yesterday he'd wear one among untested people

They optional depending circumstances. I'm wearing one right I'm alone. wear one walk dog socially distance. wear one I'm store taxi See, totally flattened curve, rotate graph looking it. BAM, flat line! That’s like, opinion, man That’s point. trying estimate case numbers comparing rich countries poor counties can’t even use excess deaths. There’s many variables. either purposefully disingenuous flat-out uninformed response. initial information heavily peddled *almost everyone* young people didn’t worry Covid themselves, rather vulnerable people lives. narrative still alive well (watch governor Florida talk). Sure, cautious, act like unreasonable listen professionals whose jobs keep us informed silly. sad thing, even news like still know people think hoax.

Going back work couple weeks I'm terrified going blow back NY people morons, they'll bringing moron attitudes vacation. \#RakeAmericaGreatAgain lot. Grandma family there. Hope they're safe would compare respirators surgical masks. completely different things. That's narcissism works. Everything gets sucked in. Probably good thing report on.

Not everyone fully realizes mostly alcohol based, highly highly flammable. flame visible, either. male, American, young adults/teenagers/children

Literally everyone biases, two white male American adults/children/teens likely differing views completely overlapping views

That said, yeah, Reddit best way keep date news, though subs like r/conservative worse others Fox News first, get indoctrinated there, Facebook reinforces fox trained think shit true. put starting August 5. release survey asking parents teachers thoughts online school though, results expected next week. I'm hoping minimum let parents choose homeschool reopen person. We've quarantined super careful, there's way know parents same. want pay people's level exposure make isolation worthless. one parents :) Happens everywhere breakout bad enough. Triage normal circumstances. Social distancing masks work.

Now find second wave.

* doctor Associate ""freedom"" youre good go

This generalize. Sweden strongly anti-mask, ""freedom"" that's Swedish authorities say. ive heard well, worth everything get Lol downplayed 2 weeks said theres human human transmission sent everyone virus sample countyiee could make test first week feb. president played months even said disappear 2 days ago. saw happen nyc still played refuses advocate mask failed organized response. tons states suffering. Thats downplayed it. That's fine, honestly people I've seen wearing masks kinds ages. Hell yesterday saw elderly couple wal-mart wearing masks. I'm talking like using mobility assistance devices old. People myopic hell.  


The ""friend"" probably even go funeral forgot 3 days later. probably drinking still partying. Fucking hell...

These kids...what tell idiots things? COVID JOKE MEANS.

I wish harm them...but really? Dude, kill grandparent end dying it????? God.... 1 trillion dollars divided 333 million people (ball parked cleaner result).

So, president considers life-saving measure yields another $3000 per person.

Meanwhile, world leaders treating citizens intrinsic worth months now. site accessible shorted market

This dead cat costing hundreds dollars couple times forget, although mile out, returned get it. Think = valuable wallet/purse  Shout downfall r/conspiracy, great sub.  Hopefully! need 2016 Trump voters admit wrong. annoys people say there's second wave.

The second wave obvious graph.

Why first one second one happens? Again, look graph. Find first wave. Find second wave.

Easy, right? /r/LeopardsAteMyFace/ Yes. Serology testing. Check antibodies large enough random sample adjust demographics comorbities sample population. That's know. big one ""masks help...but medical professionals need them"".

It's damned do, damned situation.

Say masks help, people hord healthcare industry shuts lack PPE doctors getting sick. Lie say masks help everyone needs stay home, buy time get PPE medical industry soft reopen diy cloth masks.

It sucks, think made right choice. Same. 2 we’re finally financially secure, can’t afford cost daycare returned work baby. makes sad can’t helped. Yep. US fucking huge. live Michigan rando plot clearly show defined first wave ended. hit reset button, something wrong, go previous version (although I'm sure one better) Insanity. got invited double birthday party next week sure lots kids think may stay home kid....And I'm happy either son socialized kids ages starting get him...We go vacation end month hopefully things get little better least enjoy summer little bit year ugh............

I'm NJ people already parties 20 plus people state started reopening like 2 weeks ago. 

At point, like damned do, damned. go back work next week well, let's see things go.... sister brother parts generation, would NEVER anything like this...Jesus fucking Christ. sure hope so. Lol wrote perfect reason laws regulating contact tracing needed. part process drafting laws, people confront issues data privacy, release information, etc., put protections **into law**. Instead, right knee-jerk reaction basically local government saying ""trust us, right thing"". approach strategy getting fired? Insult guests they're rude on? Uses small European citylike country compare US. Generalize please amount testing done embarrassingly low civilized standards. get sake internet love, think Nice Reference! week ago someone tell doctor said kids get virus spread virus. call BS. Daily total deaths still declining though Yeah, that’s said originally. 🙄 Way back pedal. Oh shit! realized...I’ve spent way much time already! whole ""I can't wear mask"" thing ridiculous shit I've ever heard.

People faking medical disorder get putting straps ears insane.

I dont see viable solution. darwin moves mysterious way fuck blame massive gatherings people protesting? Like seriously... mean, parents grandparents. care them? I'm one people lived closed hospitals temporary morgues. great know better everyone else based literacy, I'm taking advice. sad part get LOT worse.

Even measures implemented still see sharp rise \~2 weeks limit already reached. 100's (if 1000'S) stories like this.

But least Texas able ""free""

 

 ""The thing I'm skipping listening him,"" Patrick added. ""He wrong every time, every issue. need advice anymore. We'll listen lot science, we'll listen lot doctors, \[Gov. Greg Abbott (R)\], state leaders make decision. thank you, Dr. Fauci."" 

## Message state Texas strong; people, resilient.** 
**As seen years past, tested fire, flood, hurricane, Texans respond resilience calm resolve. overcame challenges, overcome one.** 
**When neighbors help neighbors, resilience redoubled.** 
**I doubt Texans continue work together spirit coming days weeks.** 
**And help.** 
Governor Greg Abbott pre Covid scenarios. None people would drop death death today obese. something ever think possible.

I defend stupidity. want point mere fact dangerous Covid people w/o underlings conditions. Lefty here, still pro mask. Trump could deep throat mask like services Putin I'd still pro mask. Hey record job gains stock market toot-toots up. *Coronavirus liked this* another global epidemic next year, it’s going entirely N.America S.America’s fault 

:/ Well thanks coming united front proving evidence we're wrong. Healthcare workers like claim superior hindsight I've noticed... meanwhile doctors nurses pushing bullshit conspiracy theorists are. Well CDC estimated death rate .2% .4%. I'm buying OP's conspiracy theory usually takes years develop properly test vaccines. effectively political argument wrapped Bible around, quite honest never works hard way lockdown. could easy way. people. Stopped. Fucking. Up. Jesus christ hard put piece fabric front mouth get clowe strangers. Nope, Netherlands. mom still letting pf hpuse country 400cases. Seems legit wrong go back Tide Pod challenge stupid hurt others? heartbreaking cases like could preventable better response. going edit previously erroneous posts then? I've got wood. Would like some? Nothing see - effective government making effective decisions taking responsibility fall standards public expects. functioning democracy action.

No community transmission. answered you!!! one 3 papers read. fuck wrong you. like answer, agree can't stand facts, tough it. ALWAYS give opinion, like can't civilized can't back opinion, need respond. Goodbye. Welp said fire service received reports students throwing parties inviting ""known positives"" initially thought doctor's offices help confirm it, state confirmed information,"" Smith said, according WBMA. It’s heartbreaking. northeast corridor absolutely hammered earlier year, least somewhat prepared. Don’t get wrong, things still got really bad, still caught way less prepared been. It’s nothing compared rural states hit. 

Without trying, drive directly past 4 hospitals way work. One among best hospitals nation. probably dozen reasonably well prepared hospitals within half hour’s drive me. scary close coming completely overloading them, able handle lot got point. 

Now we’re seeing numbers almost overloaded best medical system country, they’re cropping rural America. small communities could healthcare systems overloaded handful households getting infected. may avoided major metropolitan healthcare collapses time being, 1000 tiny rural collapses hit hard. clearly depends here. Claiming New York tristate area first wave passed reasonable. New York still lot corona virus cases 750 weekly average. New York still clearly past peaks corona virus cases. New York would enter new exponential growth phase corona virus, one probably call second wave.

Now, talking entire United States, one sees wave starts New York forms peak there, goes down. time, spreads rest United States starts going there. one clearly single wave, complicated spatial - temporal behavior. Many people know it? haven’t seen studies regarding fertility. It’s like, basic biology?

Black people biologically Caucasian Asian people except minor oddities—of course going susceptible virus (remember early on? smh).

And course children going get pass in. may better able, virtue age general good health, weather it, they’re going GET transmit it. #Translation:


#The government raised SEK 1 billion increase covid-19 infection tracking. several regions capacity actively carry infection, survey SVT News done. 

**""We risk getting second wave effective infection detection,"" says Niklas Arnberg, professor virology.**

In beginning pandemic, cases covid-19were infection traced, strategy abandoned established community transmission. 

Now goal follow identify suspected infected around new case - beginning pandemic.

- important regions, based capacity opportunity, extend even ambitious infection detection, says Karin Tegmark Wisell, Head Department Public Health Authority.
#""Difficult deal with""

But survey SVT News sent country's 21 regions shows everyone capacity this.

""According Infection Protection Act, treating physician responsible infection detection individual cases, given amount, traditional infection detection becomes difficult deal with,"" writes Peter Nolskog, assistant infection prevention physician Västra Götaland. 

**In several regions, tested positive primary care receive information contacting immediate contacts themselves.** contact live infected person offered automatic testing quarantined.

#More active infection tracking healthcare

Regions Jämtland, Härjedalen, Halland, Västernorrland Västmanland infection trace actively health care, home care, elderly care homes closed environments. 

""For while, infection tracing happened cases, always, now,"" writes Lars Blad, assistant infection prevention physician Region Västmanland.

Limited sampling capacity personnel make region prioritize cases environments considered important

The Stockholm region made similar assessment community transmission.

#""Risking second wave""

Niklas Arnberg, professor virology, believes capacity must increase.

- **If ongoing infection track exposed inform take extra measures. Within family, everyone test immediately someone ongoing infection. get general spread infection, risk getting second wave worse one spring.** Thanks Oscar ""The prudent sees evil hides himself, naive go on, punished it."" Proverbs 22:3 Sadly happened Italy worst...

 


You even find Videos doctors tears explaining need todo ( weeks / months ago).

 


That's sadly reality is. capacity far limit doctors need decide gets treatment. Angela Merkel. thanks TX FL Arizon &amp; CA accounting 30% cases &amp; screwing us bet beaches &amp; protests worth state (New York/New Jersey person speaking here)...at least people FUCKING LISTEN authorities science reccommend...Jesus... Maybe use ex-fans...put bodies jerseys hats on...just thought $2000 per day don’t talk.

Point missed comply *with subpoena*. issue saw addressing ""talking"" Outdoors need one maintain social distancing. Oops, guess ""my constitutional rights dumb want be"" actually consequences. Fauci said make homemade masks instead, bet people would stocking shit could JoAnn’s Michael’s get material could masks. Hell, there’d huge market cotton masks there.

I started sewing masks March soon learned even “thing”. quickly became apparent materials needed make them, including fabric, thread, pipe cleaners nose wire elastic, suddenly shortage everywhere. tons people making fabric masks early on. not? Sorry I'm sure mean. think suggesting second wave? 

Perhaps is, impression whole first wave second wave thing would actually need reduce case count minimal amount first wave declared over. we're seeing currently looks like first wave carrying forward. Basically actions taken limit spread, actions reduced, infection rates moving expected. 

If runs course, numbers begin drop, hits again... would second wave. 

I'm expert though could wrong agree. fact believe lower prevalence stated observed kids part based antibody surveys. true kids lower prevalence antibodies surveys evidence emerging many asymptomatic cases clear virus without producing significant antibody response, using T-cell immunity. Kids likely asymptomatic probably false conclusion catch less look antibodies. mourns Lake Elsinore man died COVID-19 guy needs removed office, forcibly needed. Article blocked EU. :/ Oh, sorry. guess said; yet ppl close shops one hit. much this. people, even regular day, operate state denial get by. since impossible ignore hurricane physically disrupts life landscape, people spring action. virus...not much. Ok bit interesting news hurricanes 2020.... apparently Sahara desert blowing sand united states/Americas ... goes Atlantic mixing within air apparently slowing unstable air weaking hurricanes. 2020 version good news Yeah two symptoms definitely enough indicate testing covid experts disagree you

Which ones? Please name them. wife glad retired. staying fuck ""in house"", always masked absolutely go door.

It hard enough watching patients die slowly cancer. can't even imagine mental health hospital doctors (and nurses) places like Houston. modern airplanes pull air outside circulate cabin, recycling air inside whole time. also filter every 2-3 minutes something like that. catch either I'd much rather plane bar right now. expect politicians. Especially want scientists lie behalf. Understand difference. Public health shit show. Masks dont work, do. 10,000 people protests ok. death rate much higher listed. infection rate 10x higher tested.

We scapegoat political party til November health departments fucking shit show too. Article includes video incident. autism, dyspraxia, depression eating disorder. BIG THINK get dumb joke Gotta resistant change. 
Wife switched wfh job make work.

Just rigid unbending habits expectations leave behind.

To thrive gotta adjust doctor tell act like virus exist? doctor told medicine could cause feeling well. say go everywhere without precautions tested positive. selfish. Sorry guys. Exponential math people. It’s going get way, way worse gets better. makes still first wave?

Look chart.

Find first wave.

Find second wave.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* martyrs love care think protestors need held accountable too? throw everyone exercises constitutional rights prison?  one said masks help, said cloth masks protect wearer. one claiming ones medical professionals use work... mention thought early spread droplets surfaces, air, meaning masks helped nearly much believed now. subreddit discuss news COVID19. 100%. one was/is going tough come school year.

I'll pass that, thanks. friend party reached Macias say coronavirus, aware diagnosis attended gathering **didn’t think could infect anyone symptoms**, Lopez said. 

On June 9th, widespread reporting asymptomatic cases rarely spread disease, later clarified. party sometime June 15th.

I wonder many people died misinformation states re-opening.  Trolls know they’re shouting nonsense, subject it’s complicated somehow existence severity disease become election item millions True Believers US honestly think data showing COVID-19 something seasonal flu ‘democratic propaganda’ something.

They’re trolls literally don’t know better, they’re willfully stupid. hope whatever job involve math. Maybe trump giving million dollar mask contracts middlemen used aides white house idea obtain n95 mask "" criticism plan know much immunity built getting it, say think confer least immunity likely last least year two more""... know much clear get. knew everyone would get hung ""we know"".... also know catching confer immunity either. I'll take risk.

I know least 4 people tested positive it. Coworker, best friends sister law, two relatives step mom.... know several coworkers girlfriend gotten well. documented positive tests. 

I'm still wearing mask, socially distancing, avoiding crowds confined interior spaces, everything avoid it. I'm saying could wave magic wand get right know certainly would reasons mentioned. think operating assumption get point, I'm saying I'd rather get fall winter. one, that's simply unprecedented. Never ever seen virus spreading. all. Korea studies suggested 2%. Show source says 50%. Stop flogging spurious made-up crap. keep beaches closed stop thousands congregating. Keep local places open serve local population earn much needed bucks. Keep road trippers flyers away germs cross county lines.

It amazes people think rational want certain things themselves.

I live Miami. want people flying town town germs taking heavily Rona infested germs home. want crowded streets weekend. want surrounding shops closed weekend still need eat regardless whether feel like long weekend. awful. condolences loss. make difference. Nature go calendar. anything, things get worse due climate change. much sucks, I'd rather norovirus times even good chance getting covid risking permanent lung (or other) damage It’s fucking wild. wife’s grandparents boat. dinner night, talking COVID general mentioned virus first became issue talked doctor long time good friend mine said “this one contagious virus we’ve ever seen medical community.” laughed grandparents told would listen anything doctor said because, kid not, “that Fauci said lie day.” Followed statement “exactly” people gotten recent cases. infuriating. asked shouldn’t listen doctor medical director 7 clinics, supposed get information from.

The statement quoting wasn’t even crazy. luckily never leave house, stay room watch Fox News 24/7. got stormed dinner threw Trump lies almost every day he’s office, typically one time single day. respect either one anymore. (They told police right kill Floyd weeks ago two drugs system) arrogance fucking astounding 75 people look good! vitamin D? Wife working home 2 year old. split working times make work.

Now rhythm. totally doable. Texas one great states left. mask mandate unconstitutional. CDC’s website list evidence cloth masks prevent infection COVID-19 rated comment loss (yes he’s real person family friends) need martyrdom get message across? Apparently. 

Do really think bunch martyrs going change minds freedummies? increase states take Covid seriously reopened, states lots protests. Yes zero difference shutting society basic mitigation like masks social distancing./ florida still got yall southern states beat, come us. That’s flawed then. Divide 5 6, 12. peak months coincide Covid months (or anything viral). seem dropping cliff Sweden, really quite incredible

The downtrend past month Sweden weak still deaths per capita Europe, consider profound drop. Yeah, also blows mind much people actually enjoy going crowded spaces. figured much larger chunk folks going social graces presented social pressure surround bunch strangers, would problem. Somehow, people even less interesting thought six months ago think that's herd immunity works. ever seen virus disappear everyone got before, without vaccines?  police surplus military gear they're still afraid break anything peaceful protests. That's theory well. conspiracy theorist side tells there's targeted misinformation campaign regarding COVID-19 Russians. I'm talking 2 million throughout duration pandemic. Herd immunity reached 70% population gets infected. .5% death rate that's 2 million people. Lol, also government said. knew reeked bs. would vaccine virus .4% death rate, estimated CDC. measles, maybe yeah, COVID. think that’s literally harsh unconstitutional. !remindme 1w Seems like lot states list. loss (yes he’s real person family friends) need martyrdom get message across? Apparently.

“People need start taking seriously! happen me, happen anyone!” Actually, pretty smart use chant pro-choice people. one cannot dictate woman body, matter whether abortions mask wearing. still body, it? call 40 adults ""responsible"". provided source yours? him, version, isn’t blue, he’s hiding plain sight. do?

The comments say terrible, know bad definition „containing it“? literally nobody thinks love good hearty chicken soup. always sits well tummy gives protein stuff need feel better. You’ve missed point. Trumpees idiots. people using “science” intelligent sounding crutch science is:

1. Presented variously depending publication 
2. Usually run finite conditions, 12 subjects 
3. Often contradictory (both sides may peer reviewed published) 

So, seriously, get high horse one liners share specific bit. Foisting everything Trump stuff tedious. Trump irrelevant imagination. ""Heres racism blame..."" asked old people think that? Yep, FB 95% family, 5% friends live state, somehow stay touch better. Everyday I’m less less, what’s point staying touch family makes frustrated them? What, crowd? I'm one people. I'm willing discuss issues, revise opinion necessary new evidence. Musk credibly aims start new civilization Mars. He's also responsible worldwide shift EVs inspiring whole generation. good outweighs negatives. agree C19 statements. like prescription medicine commercials tell instruct doctor prescribe drug me. rest country per capita death rates 10% tri state area. Maybe areas death rates doubly 20%., people tri state area end 5 times likely die everyone else. gloating? happy areas cases declining time . 100k cases day incoming July 18th Maybe get much rest possible. Give couple weeks. Fuck bloomberg, wanted fix things money without president, fixed? Man, Faith vs Fear total religious bullshit. I'm Christian that's bad preaching. Matthew 4:7 says ""You shall put Lord God test.""

If different disease, like cancer, hesitate second whatever doctor said best. 1000 people sat together 500 metre long table celebrating symbolic farewell party coronavirus Czech Republic. I'm sorry say farewell party mate. 2nd invitation party Coronavirus. Fuck dead. It’s going hours nonstop I’m really concerned verge tears weren’t contact tracing protests. reality cause spike part thinks effort dissuade general public using temporarily supplies bad. want wear tinfoil hat remember ideas coming WHO, CDC organizations. people need (relatively) access them, focus public.

I want true want dismiss outright either. China’s numbers probably 100% anyways. must work long hours low wage job buy things TV tells need. need savings future need new electronics. USA NUMBER ONE 2 weeks me. ER properly diagnosis, gave meds half symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea). Liver function got 5%. put dialysis 50/50 chance dialysis rest life. System bounced back. Took lot arguing part let discharge 2 weeks, nearly lost job.  sad part. forced it, big movement non-compliance guidelines apparent, needs forced. I'm typically authoritarian government, use times crisis. Yes, discussion changes made compared normal flu season pointed north don’t spend much time amusement parks flu season. changes relevant though. system able voted many people bothered vote. national elections, way school boards, city councils, mayors. literally takes maybe hour entire *year* get ass go cast vote people public's best interest heart. 

It may late now. u.s. got covid asked donate blood hospital charge 50.000$ inject someone got bar cause even believe virus real. perfectly makes sense Staying inside wearing mask month really hard guys, huh flu vaccine unique many ways. effectiveness largely well guess new influenza variants become dominant far advance. Death enemy. That's pretty cavalier racism Anyone think without listening idiots know masks help harm. Don’t forget close public restrooms beach, too! Hey, thought would take three weeks, turns lockdowns really effective. bunch cases actively spreading, take three weeks! lockdowns reduce number actively spreading cases dramatically.

Consequently, takes bit time build people get complacent. 21 year old thing say 😂 way “Was Obama born Kenya” One party two party American political system went deep end. Austria popular vacation destination, see huge risk someone coming positive spreading - again. mean that's spread February city from. businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Whoa whoa whoa. Dont lump Gatlinburg us eastern Tennessee folks. Johnson city actually part. I'd say 75% population wearing masks people avoid shopping together. huge online shopping pick services here. said, could totally see smokey mountains business usual. east Tennessee folk there! tourists everywhere. testing ever time try constructively criticize country get scolded liking foreigner opinion matter anyway.

Don't worry, thing happens us citizens. 

Our political ideologies entrenched reasoned with, people either shrug shoulders get aggressive bring something goes believe. 

I living abroad past ~7 years, came back recently noticed that, top pandemic, everything gotten worse around. 

People way edge, one's happy, everyone's still trying convince America's 'best', violence quickly becoming second answer question. 

We've got trying times ahead, that's sure. 

As millenial money, assets, stocks, significant savings, job, feeling powerlessness peak. That's friendly Never probably, core base denialists. There’s angle pander unless song tha government takin’ away muh freedums. pretty easy get piece shit actually believe get choose set rules get ""heaven.""

All I've learned church, deeper dig head sand, fit in. That's lot folks have. Chattanooga here. Looking people downtown think nothing ordinary happening. People everywhere, masks I've read science. I've read you, even die. Fuck yes I'm scared. You’re missing point made above. discussion happening context. Data spurious, gives people poke holes guidelines, includes masks.  Hmm...

I think Russian conclusions there. talking doctor family experiencing one worst crisis modern era. cut slack, think? live town work medical field here. hospital isn’t place you’d want go anything. Also, hate f*ing kids they’re potentially exposing family due stupidity. wish could close borders New England. increase summer tourists fear quarantine infect people here. Even though collectively worked hard continue working stop spread virus, banned EU well can’t even flee ignorant. Gotta say it’s bit frightening. I’m beginning think President Trump might quite handle situation... link supposed to? ""Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck fuck.""
- every parent already failed teacher last spring, probably. always look examples states testing less see happened recently. Without idea bad virus places caught bad situations without knowing Waiver Darwin self nominate application ok, next country over.

""get's covid"" 

OMFG GET EVERYWHERE FAST!!! Better receive euthanasia happens. guess that's upsets me, cause also come work every day. everyone wore mask need deny reality. Yeah, really shitty deal India, hell execute situation well without models (that work India's economy population parameter) follow even strategic plan norovirus 2 weeks, 2 years ago, picnic. 125k today 2 million couple months. stop baseless predictions two California Florida give fuck ? isnt politician alive, especially Trump, doesnt lie constantly yet people knees suck dick. feel validity studies suggestion possible protective effect populations living high altitudes?  can't pray since believe gods, urge vote.   people work full time fucking job run Pinterest profile. number New York look like people started dying large quantities? really saw Wuhan Italy.

They wanted contain virus willing really unpopular things order so. varying degrees.

But countries started mild lockdown canceling large social events. kept restricting restricting slowly arrived conclusion: cannot trust people socially distance outside exercise. ended much stricter lockdowns based scientific evidence aimed containment.

The US decided that, ultimately, OK longer containing virus opted herd immunity. publicly announcing it.  That's lot ""covid parties""! think raise valid point.  uniformity comes language use. saw Colorado early would constitute spike mind remain comfortable use early on. June 9th, widespread reporting asymptomatic cases rarely spread disease

This must mom kept saying that. Ughhhh. Kansas native here. many wearing masks. see changes tomorrow Trust know. picked Sgt guy literally 3 months longer tried refuse address rank front junior Marines senior time. gave negative counseling got giggle it. Nah, think title reserved Jair Bolsonaro. /r/WallStreetBets ya at? New York's daily peak 6,000, IIRC

They fucked. know perfect Pinterest color coded subject planning types it.

It lie, much like Covid numbers. SWFL positivity rate today 26.63% statistician tell next Thursday's numbers might look like? Thanksgiving.
And Christmas.
And New Years.

We know people social distance/wear masks comes turkey dressing ham presents. Probably zero die parents! proper way describe administration T! he?

My wife works stopped elective surgeries peaking state. hospitalization rate low, started again. idea works places imagine would turn away corona patient someone could get boob job. Yeah probably Scapegoating means blame something true cause problem. agreed cause protests too, mean they're root huge spike. found article LA Times yesterday says shutdown could happen cases continue rise. unable maintain social distancing, working behind scenes wear masks help prevent spreading anything anyone. cautious enough open month. Setting example park hosting outbreak super spread good look. nice recovery criminal, literally criminal negligence part State Federal government!

God help us. want damn North Carolina driver's license... least golf social distancing get staying house. Jokes him. federalized system country works directions. Texas, Florida, Arizona refuse mandate common sense public health protections Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey drag reopening because, well, states actually pro-life. post deblasio schools. 

Nice rant though 

You couldn’t tell quoted elsewhere? 

Everyone else could. though.

Yes, I’ve actually seen someone lol yes Hey man, handle get super doom gloom things, power lol doubt hospitals instructed directly Governor's office make data public. Abbott slimy piece shit. Florida man again. Oh yeah. know every single air-conditioned place Epcot. lot reopening due international cast members work them, gonna swamped. Florida STILL mandatory mask requirement. Horrible governing  Shut entertain us! /s Worst president ever worst vice president ever.

You saying it’s “insensitive” discuss perhaps happened censors people wondering went wrong here, healthy young adults proven infinitesimally small chance dying COVID-19 complications. yeah, way said rude dismissive. possible doctor harsh, really know entire conversation like. know, could part long, difficult conversation person asking question getting message doctor phrased gently. able work home, holding kids expectation like always would charged time kids there.

Oh jeez, that's ridiculous, imo. Yeah feeling might flexible policy reopens. said bit humor you, nasty boy, decided jump right ""well actually"" you? Haha, thanks. pops uses word lot describe administration. Lol SO’s boss one feel guilty here. came valid concerns told come anyway. said point risking losing job — wasn’t discussion best actions equals, worker boss. 14 day quarantine. understanding currently lots restrictions interstate travel US. proper social distancing could detrimental maintain distance keep touching face adjust mask thought worse keeping distance

They suspected better. attempt plug plot hole anyone paying attention. m95 training consists shitty training videos. could showed people wear use amount time took convince to. Salvation Army employees, neither. rides

Uhh, *been* there? far rides live action venues. 100%.  comments actually happens hospice care, seems headline perspective severely biased misleading. wish people would understand. Everyone crying country effed would well take heart. Yes im LA taking seriously things reopened people went nuts. sucks sad people lost lives. Please wear masks.

Please.

Do people around you. ABSOLUTELY!!! recent study Lancet showed masks reduce transmission virus 85%. science unequivocal - masks reduce spread, masks save lives, masks work.

The uncertainly comes turning masks scientific symbol political symbol, not.

Many argue masks curb freedom. would say opposite. Masks give us freedom want safely - without disregard human life without reckless. allow us get pandemic still able live lives.

They inconvenience cause carbon dioxide poisoning affect oxygen levels substantially. exception underlying severe lung disease discuss doctors.

Masks made mandatory average person that, save tens thousands American lives also able work re-opening economy.

-Dr. Kohli Well, hope people get vote Nov 2020. Let us vote change leadership, 
teach politicians lesson, demand responsibility accountability them, 
abolish lobbying get rid electoral college. 2020 need system 
that relevant people ride horses days vote person 
president bring back news *Who leader?* masses. People damn 
vote president themselves.

There lesson this. fix this, going take time, stain 
reputation worldwide aside, need fix internal *community*. 
polarized sticking extremes now, need lot community trust 
building. need start somewhere, let elections reforms 
are fight start. Start somewhere, somewhere rock bottom recent times. misinformation say Texas lack hospital beds. CEO Medical City Houston said media grossly exaggerated claims. decision use certain medical instruments medical practice 101 - triage. ""deciding"", plan place.

As flattening curve, build new hospitals - field hospitals, sure mostly taken lack cases requiring hospitalizations. exactly going ""survive second wave"" nothing changed?

Here's analogy: like flapping arms slow fall skydiving ground. hope people get sick die high cost higher education. thanks Florida governor!  Let’s forget that! use money one gets lung heart damage. toss bit money pot every month help pay person's medications, etc due new ""preexisting condition"".  hand tied? Doubt it. spoke President plenty things, could done masks. Humanity fine. elected leaders minting buddies worth paper drew ""x"" on. excited read using word ""Grifter"" use time. time explain meaning word! Kudos you! Stop testing virus disappear like magic! - Donald Trump It’s deeper South Africa. Politicians connections illicit cigarette smugglers. Someone’s pockets getting filled this, that’s way works here. school survey parents saw, parents wanted return school also want measures taken : masks, social distancing.

The restaurant, bar experiment already tells going work living time official strategy basically Denial. 

Between Trump‘s “if stop texting we’ll fewer cases!” Florida‘s “just fire doctors want report real numbers” strategy, shocked US leading world daily new cases. 

Shocked, say. Again, 'they' enforcing return flight rule?

It's deterrent people travelling policy enforced penalized practice.

The problem makes rules less meaningful, mandatory mask policies, enforced every rule becomes less respected enforceable. r/woosh Ok later ones eyeballs, revenue, emotional impact first justified?


/u/9NEWS  would love answer.  noticed word ""spike"" AMA title too. Remdesivir go non-intubated patients first there's shortage. That's main benefit trial plot point included movies sure produced covid19 years later I'm sure Dr. Kohli better answer obesity one risk factors makes susceptible complications COVID-19, even young person. state better right need assess risk decide feel safe going out. would say go definitely everything protect - social distance wash hands often. - Stephanie works pregnancies, too! Stop Testing America 40% Gender real tho Bavaria isnt even date bars/pubs open. attention needs drawn priapism orchitis COVID cases. Masks protect  Well, can't believe I'm saying this, US finally #1 something military spending.  plenty times. push “pneumonia deaths” 🤷‍♀️ tell lot man thinks farts.  true, trust cross-sampling point growth exceeds physical capabilities. Even though we'll bit dark point on, we've seen enough data get sense bad situation currently is. 

Hopefully Florida actually puts sensible measures back place, political climate US, I'm thrilled chances. governor literally said isn’t going change anything since one listened first time around. People Alabama resorted making Facebook groups figure it’s safe go. Looks like top 10 forecasts pretty spot on. article says 37 deaths? they're getting better... still problems... Wish better news -- Chris Vanderveen Unless it’s 401k no!

this might explain im getting friend requests peeps knew FL

fuck! no! 

this madness man......i wish would stop! point decreased percent positivity never bad thing. point. USA numbah 1 no-expenses paid trip ICU. Same.

The US still figured testing; testing system actively overwhelmed again. pcps hospitals tests.

And know format vaccine protocol used end product. like hepatitis vax need boosters? require refrigerator capacity shelf stable? works like seasonal flu vaccine?

We vaccines flu measles. Neither eradicated.

I know unpopular things hear important conversation have. Coronavirus, hurricane season, AC car broke! Fuckin Florida, man Wonder long NBA bubble hold conditions Florida? Remember idiots saying advocating caution around re-opening doom gloom? economy going tank without fast re-opening? economy going tank much harder would previously tens thousands people going get sick die unnecessarily.  Doomers claim current spread end world. virus ever major danger great majority people. Yes spreading, awful. Except dog probably would gotten another human anothee dog who's owner it. Pretty much let randoms touch dog probably go dog park.
This timeline sucks.

-Dr. Kohli new case numbers always low Sundays? 
Looking California: 
[http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/](http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/) 
If look US overall seems maybe Monday low days? 


Is people avoiding going doctors sunday/monday? 
Or people getting sick work monday friday getting sick weekend? 
Or people need go doctor get note work monday - friday weekend? 
Or hospital / governments reporting data weekends? Delay arrivals hospitals reduce number active cases hospitalized cases. Almost good stop testing. troll? Well... part true. part completely ignores context contributing facts. best, believable lies contain nugget truth.

Personal experience: corona test people access (the one ever slightly miss swabbing brain inside nose) fun, one volunteering unless least symptoms exposure (or mental disorder). getting rapid test spit test anywhere right now, probably ordered doctor, case... one getting fun.

If testing going up, demand testing going up. Demand testing goes people suspect exposure symptoms.

So yes, positives going testing going up, really stupid ask testing going up?

(this completely ignores testing positive rates increasing well, important piece information well) able come.

If pay tests supervised quarantine themselves. Uh... realize word ""asymptomatic"" means right? Funny used farts argue opposite. Someone farts cover nose shirt. smell least long enough get away. poop farts smell gasses even smaller virus. Yea, Mexico 50 % positivity tests, pandemic getting started.  Didn’t Disney also recently close Disneyland well? could see Disney world getting similar treatment. manslaughter country. knowingly virus infect another, results death, sentence terorism homicide. Hello future. Buckle up. get sporty. imply, 15% positive test rate, roughly 21 million people(residents, anyway) state, Florida approximately 3.1 million infected people state far? Florida report positive negative percentage? Oregon made sure point yesterday tested fewer people last week (people going tested test 20k week) positive negative percentage went entire percentage point. That’s important number look week week mostly accounts differences testing numbers. dropped 1% reopened, people thought reopening meant free maskless backyard BBQs 20 closest friends. level stupidity coming raiders fan. I’m still waiting test results (tested last Saturday), presumed positive. 74 yr old father lives me. small stroke last month, heart disease. switched Eliquis following stroke, since still clotting Warfarin. concerned hospitalized quick test corona virus high false negative rate. type O- blood supposed help severity.  


Are prophylactic treatments could request doctors? want wait test results. Broward county, Florida. Disney guests reserve park intend go to. now, parks hitting capacity. hit capacity least week ago. packed Disney allows be. sad reality post people highlighted, probably ignorance. weight contributed death, likely Diabetes *morbidly* obese.  dammit fucking bad exactly positivity rate extremely important. earlier testing available people symptoms high risk, rate lower testing widely available. looked Florida's numbers specifically, looked Ohio's numbers yesterday.  seeing lot cases, testing nearly doubled.  we've opened testing, positivity rate remained roughly steady, 5% last month.

Edit: found Florida's testing info.  pretty scary.  ""The percent positive results ranged 8.98% 18.51% past 2 weeks 16.78% yesterday "" article posted July 2nd - improves recovery time lowers mortality rate R.I.P. Van Winkle That's defense all. Especially since one person thinks actual evidence contagious. can't really use past cases (HIV transmissions instance) coronavirus unprecedented terms asymptomatic transmission thing. begs question: know positive?

As lawsuit, negligence standard proof would him. Particularly relates disclosing Covid-19, inaction leading spreading death. One million infected sure. 5% death rate, 21 mil citizens looking million dead stop this. that's assuming average citizen age. hope nobody America still thinks they're going watch football fall.

Freedom killed football. MURICA! lied saying masks may block droplet two, implies effective. also said even bother wearing one pandemic that. Even counting dead inaccurate. Imagine many people die, enough resources sort cause death. Pop quiz: crisis, public statement reads ""there's evidence happening"". **majority** intepret message? super date, back May seemed say opinion swung last month so, place happy him? think lot people trying help other. Twitter full people passing around money help cover rent medical bills.

Community great. One worst parts decline past decades breakdown community I'm sympathetic people engaging mutual aid like talking about. can't see solution meaningful sense. many people even know next door neighbors? we're gonna pool resources live together? many people even friends lives would comfortable trying with? That's community structure feature culture needed place crisis. We'd building scratch.

Again, saying bad thing. could really great certain people families. unless already living way like Amish Mennonites something, seems unlikely would take hold. People alienated community even family see makeshift communes way forward right vast majority time crisis. maybe I'm pessimistic.

note: post thrice, apparently automod like c-word lol School fall one closure another Damn protesters went Cub Eagan last Tuesday evening probably 8:30pm so.

It ether masks I’ve seen people yet, maybe 90% so.

File people believe anything read internet. Love unattributed reporting super suspicious website. Agree, though, Trump certainly ""used ways"" instill derision COVID attempts thwart amongst ~~zombies~~ fans.

It's Florida course, Texas also explode Abbott literally rejecting Fauci favour certain book protect people. agree, given large number Confederate flags seen pro-plague rallies would say also racism. far 125,000 several stated mandated masks get fined, instances yes are. fairness, majority blame fall. problem country isn’t much current administration neighbors okayed country becoming third world. also 100 deaths non-Florida residents. makes wonder deaths reported state people from. total 167 people died Florida, 67 Florida residents. lot people coming vacation moved dying. Okay, explain *why* measures show? mean, like 10 really compelling examples measures aren’t taken situation gets really, really bad.  BLM protesters, part, heavily armed. Police toss tear gas rubber bullets peaceful protesters armed teeth. Best example I've ever witnessed second protecting first past months. Florida tremendously flat. highest point 105 meters sea level. southern half state visible elevation. like snow, many Floridians never seen hill, much less mountain. really funny travel someone Florida see snowcapped mountains almost unanimously screech like babies. Jesus dude I’m terrified everywhere. People dumb hell going explode gotta celebrate mUh FReEdUmB sprinting straight forward disaster, they’re burning road behind them. think general consensus keeping economy closed carries massive problems well.  Millions millions work way pay rent bills. That's insignificant.  people die result well. key handle way overwhelm medical system. can't eradicate it, keep low level poses insignificant risk.  -- Chris Vanderveen live society built pressure shame still do.

/s Citizens must mature reopening. remember Florida model licking plane toilet seats start pandemic US? I’m right you. talk boss people wearing masks. first time since kicked haven’t felt safe work.  People look death percentages, forget there’s magic bullet something that’s scares me. everything right takes one asshole ruin it.  live Asia. Prior COVID19 whenever anyone sick workplace would wear mask. also made habit wear mask public transportation. 

America acting like toddler told wear masks face global pandemic laughable infuriating. Yeah agree lot fear mongering (and much focus raw case numbers - that's #1 pet peeve). agree progress, start finding we've kept hospitals unscathed certain areas find high serology rates (40%+?), seems reopening conversations start looking rosy. need data, taking summer cautious watch numbers still seems prudent. good point, hospitalization rate delayed number. 2-3 weeks we'll better picture severe cases are. Winnie Pooh actually banned China, despite media tells us. 

So really brings fore question country actually lying censoring spreading propaganda? Maybe both, certainly China.

50,000 deaths: “The deaths lie!”

75,000 deaths: “Let’s shoot herd immunity! Lockdowns tyranny masks stupid!”

100,000 deaths: “All projections wrong! ever listen Dr. Fauci!?” ” (The model motivated lockdown predicted 100,000 deaths August)

125,000 deaths: “It’s we’re testing!”

We've seen coming since 1,000 cases US. Every single step way we've known much threat virus is. wish people would finally shut fuck quit acting like children. worst pandemic anyone alive today ever experienced. Show humility quit acting belligerent fact people's lives hands.

Edit:

What Lieutenant Governor Texas [said really pissed off. Texas doubled total active cases 10 days. Florida 14. Coronavirus spreading EXACT speed southern states every single hotspot world (shortly overwhelmed). spreading completely 100% unimpeded, representatives showing they're nothing inflated egos parading around suits. Thousands people dying alone scared chaotic hospitals, leaders bumble around preaching idiocy. like Chile counted coronavirus deaths recoveries. work hotels, spoke gentleman Georgia yesterday. According state ""doing fine"", probably not. So, apparently parents want vacation Austria (they live Germany) later year. That's bad idea, right? argue parents is? problem pla used people china. past. kick addictions replaced good habits

Well, welcome Reddit! Soon, politicians, “Karen &amp; Kevin’s” learn exponential growth is. know we'll see 100k per day simply due testing limits. Florida reported 8-10k cases day end last week nearly 70k tests week 6k per day 40k tests. know free walk in/drive thru places area closing early every day due full capacity Nobody lied. told know masks effective saved healthcare workers there's shortage. Later found effective. Science changes time gather data tweak conclusions. That's works, need learn accept reality. 4th July weekend numbers keep going up. I'm Texas still hosting firework shows, fairs parties. knew it. I'm surrounded Assholes! checked history, whole lot stupid thread commenters. clear; numerous public health officials including said reason believe cases going increased testing.

If anything, places like Arizona seeing many tests come back positive testing almost certainly keeping new infections. Unfortunately may never know. appears standard antibody tests may effective detecting COVID-19 months infection. It’s likely accurate historical record widespread COVID eventually body count. Hah, thought Louisiana incredibly surprised second feels like shit kind report. somehow understand masks work beginning? They're media headlines, state manipulation. America 🇺🇸 🇺🇲 Well... test vaccine, test COVID. Americas numbers calm down. Fuck downvotes speak truth boy tired winning might die. aint touching shit. test rats. positive nutrition comes that? It’s cheaper care health. dollars I’m sure could find something 4x value McDonald’s. counting calories. wear pants public places, big deal? Yep. county ""mandate"" - mostly prompted lot all-caps rage posts wine-moms rednecks. places masks vast minority hospitals facilities check door. people happy angry Gov. Wolf

How many?

I'm Michigan, armed ass holes storm capital, Whitmer time still 70% approval COVID response. 60% think, people short attention spans guess. 10 days you’re 50 million. thing August. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 70 hurricane likely kill you. jacknicholsonnodding.gif Great analogy. 

I think people feel like second wave numbers declining elsewhere. live opening back now. People generally following guidelines. perfectly highly publicized events people screwed up. But, generally good job. 

So kept numbers low, easy feel like first wave over. reality took effective measures control virus. That's different first wave ending. Impressive move Contact tracing basically useless many. great have, say, 500 people went wedding. Completely useless people sure got from.  hys·​te·​ria | \ hi-ˈster-ē-ə

again, never need hysteria.  people playing much wearing masks see problem tbh

People going life usual anyway unfortunate. saw 3 full basketball courts yesterday hella people around soccer field PACKED people safe say one cares bout virus anymore lol Har jar jar! rap!! days ago Texas, Arizona, Florida hearing about.


Now Georgia, Alabama, Oregon.....I know first wave never ""stopped"" least slow right? accomplish anything last three months? Canada cold. Vancouver get white Christmas every 10 years. barely see freezing temperatures winter. east coast mid west USA much colder. prayers.

You missed 'Hope' Trump finally recommending masks lol

MAGA masks, anyone? Actually lieutenant governor Texas sway happens state governor. governor Texas perfect position idiot don’t really much. That’s we’ve winners like W. Bush Rick Perry Yes would bad thing. People rightfully look state trying manipulate people something. breeds kind mistrust government seeing right now. would go hotel right now. stay home! Hotels basically multi-family housing units. There’s way avoid people staff work there. There’s way avoid touching things people touched breathing air others. stay home. staycation means staying home. Go hikes, things outdoors. Even outdoor swimming pools, proper social distancing crowd control, likely safer hotel. someone lives Hawaii surrounded beaches, fear open people flock gas stations/restaurants/bars/parks literally everything near beaches way house beach back. Everything packed. People make days it. It’s horrifying. Right. job I’m grateful. use triple layer mask carbon filter face shield. 

At point accepted can’t stay home forever. kids also go school. Never said wasn't..let say s-l-o-w-e-r...

How would know it, stop going bar? lol way overreact Deadass got Uber guy told don’t need wear mask. UM, TF? I'm going bet one, think US going able ability confirm many cases single day within week so. 

I bet % positive rate 10% week. example. matter blow steam, people going keep blaming young people whether going bar people house. thing keep wealthy, old people screaming bloody murder lock inside come shop businesses stock work jobs service them.

They consider lives live, fuck them. Maybe COVID decimates elderly population finally just, equitable society. Reap sow, olds. Death rate seems falling pretty quickly. cases per capita per day least week two now. 

Going rails crazy train!!  Central FL here. sleepy, old part town live lot mask wearing. swanky part town work much. Publix person door make monitor masks, inside plenty without them. Businesses open - city hot spot. I'd avoid traveling now. Actually compelling someone testify literally subpoena is. However, testimony incriminates yourself, essentially plead fifth. However, you’re served subpoena, absolutely mist show court. judge hold contempt don’t. judge jail contempt showing answering questions.  wear mask exercising outdoors? difficult wearing mask jog time. US bad history “draconian measures”. Deaths going quickly anymore. I'm hopeful cause immediately concerned.

I suppose shows much faith nowadays. here. I'm person NE damned right. appreciate social pressure either direction hard overcome, thankful ""mask-wearing"" side area. applaud ones going majority places. downvoted, probably too, we're right. God hope not. New York 394K cases 25K deaths last three months. Texas 160K 2,400 deaths. get 25K would mean ten people would die every 1 right now, third time. we'd 8,333 people die next 10 days, means 833 day (averaged month, still.)


Highest single-day death rate texas right 58 thats... 1400% increase? Someone tell math bad keep easy-on/easy-off masks car use Drive-Thru food. save heavy duty masks work, etc.

If ever forget mask, though, know car need pinch. Imagine White House intern Ivy League education show President put mask... person emotionally invested give one word answer , course we're hearing person's perspective possible doctor said that. Yeah didn’t need pause reopening two days ago, either.. Ever clear? Oh like china months ago America first thing's control. Gotta top everything. Wait! primary messaging masks coming top. blaming others? 

I think finally stuff, bunch cry babies. 

Unless mean... Modi's administration actually got toilet installed every (or nearly every) household Wait kind elective orthopedic surgeries? even know things lol. I'm assuming work Scottish Rite since that's biggest Atlanta kids. fucking sucks y'all, I've Children's medical staff nice kid. Fuck... city move fireworks airport asking people camp cars.

It's still going shit show course people wear masks case let little kids run around willy nilly. stats CDC say 0.04 % US died far. actually less common flu (0.1%)

0.1% **people flu** die it. IFR

0.035% **all Americans** died COVID-19. See difference?

The IFR COVID-19 least 0.4%, 4x deadlier seasonal flu. won’t. wouldn’t surprised spikes start happening July Northern states don’t already higher levels immunity first wave. SHC014 gain function strats. time winter here, get vaccine. Yeah, it’s not, that’s they’re open, DUH!

There's going lot folks get substantial bill next spring. Peru Ecuador already flew past USA deaths per capita, manage count covid, look excess deaths: wrong matter law.

If refuse subpoena, commit contempt court general refusing cooperate court's orders, fined every day, committing new act contempt court every day.

In fact, ""doubling fines"" double every day week compliance court exist: might familiar means New York pass law saying refusing speak contact tracers illegal, that's even gonna make supreme court

No, that's law works. court extreme latitude issue subpoenas, must comply. not, allowed fine every day do, increase fines, jail horrible situation induce person speak, especially themselves.

No, absolutely true. _only_ right speak court Fifth Amendment, guards incriminating _yourself_. Case law perhaps Federal law know also mean can't asked testify spouse. 

And that's it. loophole. court says, ""Tell us party we'll fine $2000 day"", tell court party, pay $2000 day.

DISCLAIMER: lawyer. legal advice. daughter's school still opening mid August. mask requirement. reduced classrooms. extra hand washing said.

My daughter returning school. feel bad her, Lupus new baby brother come October. risk it. big difference N95 sewing old t-shirt face mask. I'm still pissed US response lack PPE expecting us sew own. fucking neanderthals. Yep. moving right economic ladder what's left middle class. reality number patients outweighs available medical resources. 

Medical triage happens war zones mass casualty events, happening here, slow entirely preventable mass casualty event. Doctors must withhold treatment ones unlikely benefit resources go likely survive. 

These decisions kill old, disabled, chronically ill, cause providers PTSD change lives forever. one directly involved likes this, doctor going go home tears make decision. 

If angry happening here, angry people allowed pandemic take root, medical providers choice make awful triage decisions like one. 

Other countries took measures would get point; not. disease need take hold U.S., particularly states knew better. politicians listened scientists public health authorities, lives would saved. 

Our leaders failed us. Please vote accordingly find upsetting rather blaming physicians forced deal fallout. fair point blame doctors; look bigger picture instead. aren’t talking marches could led spread increase numbers covid moment Thank you. One comments saying Texas there's shortage drug going worst Patients First, sources cited comment though that's true would much explain US wanted buy much possible  rather dither definition lie, lets call was. ""strategically downplayed"" wearing masks, instead telling us wear safely. failed admit wrong apologize now. 

II remember timeframe. health care friends preached ""don't take masks, unnecessary you."" late February read articles looked data thought, basically telling public play percentage game. Health care workers face COVID will, need masks. respiratory illness, long I'm careful touch it, help. bought masks late February. 

I'm mad, I'm glad finally coming forward saying, ""Yeah, made mistake."" months, getting ""well, interesting, studies shown particular respiratory illness, breathing might..."" -NO. Straight tell us apologize. 

The scientific academic community lead world admitting error moving forward, behavior benefits communities. flu also spread via children. Deaths mostly New York, flooded. hospital capacity 0%, ever new severe case death. NY 1 1000 people died covid-19, whereas global average like 0.01. 

Now spread out, usually instant deaths. take 1-2 weeks cases become severe. spend weeks ventilators before/if die, chance get better medical attention. Covid-19 bad flu, really kill people... does, doctors left treat you. 

It's flu kills people poor countries rich ones. flu itself, combination flu, medical conditions, available treatment options. Oh, sorry.I meant valuation. They're worth Ford GM combined. think notion never didn’t help effective protecting others you. is, partial solution since tend pull air around mask. still barrier though, even it’s complete one.

I discussing number confirmed cases all. Everyone said Trump joking lying though. people strange death rate COVID-19 roughly 5% 

According CDC starting May 22, overall fatality rate symptomatic infections 0.4%. also state 35% infections asymptomatic implies overall infection fatality rate 0.26%.

2-5% arch nonsense. one serious talking infection fatality rate much 1% anymore. need catch up. ^This. 

T Cell immunity lasts much longer antibodies virus probably circulate months. None studies I’ve looked measure IgG levels 60 days. Data Spain New York antibody studies put estimated IFR 1%.

Technically everything happened COVID-19 came probably affected way, lines get drawn.

A flip-side issue take confirmed COVID-19 deaths date subtract deaths, end well short anticipated deaths year. suggests significant number perished COVID-19 “scheduled” go sometime year.

People forget 2.8 million deaths expected year US. that’s COVID. (Link working editor) post FloridaCoronavirus subreddit going thing pretty much.

7093 Deaths involving Pneumonia without COVID-19 excluding Influenza deaths. - 1533 Deaths involving COVID-19 Pneumonia excluding Influenza. = 5560 excess deaths math correctly.

I'm honestly surprised high. Dan Patrick Greg Abbott zoomers... concerning we're already seeing major health impacts months. implies real long term impacts even worse. Nice try. actually like plane, forget it. cases = cases! Testing identifies cases. reason people getting tested people getting COVID symptoms! good part inside McDonald's kid video games there

Or playplace, ball pit's plastic content made magnet fecal matter. I'm US. lot care all. sorry disappoint trying times.   Lol check every resort worth salt. true at. still around 230 night, granted cheaper much. lot cases people prior medical conditions dying due Covid wreaking havoc bodies previous medical issue (cancer, heart disease, etc) finishes off. cases Covid directly led death. conspiracy theorists Russian trolls needed cause death Covid could contributed way say “see, died unrelated issue hospital listed Covid.” US top 2 options gun shots car crashes. Can’t use gun shots since Ri-ght would less likely share fake stat mentions gun violence. went car crash victims.  Okay, meaningless record lmao. Total cases almost certainly lower peak earlier year factor number tests matter people. Dear Americans,

While may banned holidaying mainland Europe, banned flying Republic Ireland.

Upon arrival, asked fill form says quarantine 14 days upon arrival, nobody force - even expect - so. fact, hand form, free leave airport go wherever like island - including Northern Ireland.

While North currently rule Majesty Queen England, physical borders two territories, means free travel them. *Up yours, Queenie.*

In unlikely event recieve telephone call government department stay, asking confirm actually self isolating, answer give 'yes' enough government representative tick 'yes' box close file.

During stay, required wear face mask mandatory (though rarely enforced) public transport. public transport networks pretty fucking shit country, would advised rent car avoid hassle trying figure get B, also inconvenience wearing face ""muzzle"".

Although still currently restrictons place, bear mind Ireland lockdown almost 4 months pubs finally re-opened, expect craic - always - mighty. 

And decide come venture West, please feel free drop DM sure meet pint plain,

Yours Sincerely,

SBIII Vanilla Ice concert like trap stupid people. Where’s tWo wEeKs crowd freedumbs at? They’ve moved goalposts cases, hospitalizations, recently deaths comes out. Care still chirp “2 weeks?” crowd actually advocating safety naw? booked seat flight mars yet? leave two weeks. Last heard going New Colombia. Malaysia, every day summer lmao united flight eug sfo

Im self quarantining moved return flight back extra week half flights capacity cautious. Sfo part made really nervous. people didnt masks felt comfortable getting close others navigating travel.  many silver linings here. likely 50,000 infect others. even mostly young people now, ensure virus plenty hosts infect..and school starts.

no end sight. time immune system. masks useless. else would virologist wear hazmat suit instead bandana face mask? amazing many actors pretending virus now. Soros busy! probably 100,000 already lot tests done due lack supplies. official number. Changed 9740 day. That's it. Shoot em sight come Donnie press button let's Jesus Christ fucking post. quarantines mask policy? think quarantines destroyed many people's lives (most already lived life) quarantining worth thought covid deaths counted person tested tested positive? mention that. guess that's still big elephant room one wants acknowledge. Yea.... that's pretty much take away. Two bars area recently closed. One Covid outbreak one new restrictions/in reaction bar. FB page full people complaining made sense outbreak bar, one ONE BLOCK AWAY, people frequent multiple bars. far. sure, like worst case scenario, saying everyone gonna get stuff. I've lost respect Elon Musk. idol inspiration anymore, outdoor seating scenario you’re describing sounds relatively safe. I’ll bet tables spaced appropriately. little risk wearing masks seated restaurant patio long you’re close proximity (within 6 feet) strangers. compare historical performance here. Alot models way off, high low.  YYG actually remarkably good compared academic models (especially Zoomers, Millennials, Gen-X, Baby Boomers trash...if wear mask. That's matters right now, whether someone cares enough everyone else wear mask. born irrelevant. question loaded question [you explained stopped beating wife? simple yes/no question. addition, told multiple lies. Now, properly respond entire comment move on. agree, honestly, sub always try derail conversarion America, little tiring, specially people outside America IFR budged far. Oh makes sense. think would safe people wearing masks. 25,000 deaths: “It’s killed less people flu!”

50,000 deaths: “The deaths lie!”

75,000 deaths: “Let’s shoot herd immunity! Lockdowns tyranny masks stupid!”

100,000 deaths: “All projections wrong! ever listen Dr. Fauci!?” ” (The model motivated lockdown predicted 100,000 deaths August)

125,000 deaths: “It’s we’re testing!”

We've seen coming since 1,000 cases US. Every single step way we've known much threat virus is. wish people would finally shut fuck quit acting like children. worst pandemic anyone alive today ever experienced. Show humility quit acting belligerent fact people's lives hands. Nah. art fuckery. dont answer cut off. change number odds pretty good give number someone else answer call. buy day. atleast next deposit card would try home day. know visiting relatives. doubt requirement give former employer itinerary.

You could conceivably milk couple checks. Name lie. small studies suggest work ! Albeit studies arent perfect, evidence needed. say conservative???? terrifying think school damn eager stoke flu season COVID embers! TAKE MURICA

when start honest bad China Yea think meant like muscle sores.. first understanding anyway. doubt actual sores Still refuses make mandatory. nothing's really going change. World"" usually

usually, always, poor, bc countries didnt get kind aid, subsidies, infrastructure support similarly poor 1st &amp; 2nd world countries received. I'm pretty sure practically everyone subreddit ER doctors side. wonder think they're making them. Panic/outrage culture thing, it’s toxic ones health. It’s disingenuous acknowledge that. IFR since February. Something like 0.6% people get die.  
 
So hospitalizations deaths going massively grow, projections far near levels April, far less total people infected July. Maybe missed joke. What's sad death count starts rise sharply, pleasure pieces sh*t waving death charts around wrong. despair, shame, anger. 

We're already seeing Arizona. there's schadenfreude. There's quiet sadness pain avoidable loss hundreds thousands lives. i’m leavenworth literally short drive - even walk - away cold stone local hardware store gives masks away free. give animals whatever medication want, think eating mites. Yikes. Best luck!  Death disease mistrust  know there’s anecdotes this. statistically significant this? Coronavirus respiratory disease. happened here. peaking following weeks get better Ok media need continue drill back wasn’t months. India easing lockdowns number cases increasing? Indians exact opposite instead? U.S. really democracy failed state awhile. pandemic tearing facade.  blue hat boomer boss booms like motherfucker. Still wears mask tho. another group asshole spreaders. woke today sore throat obviously I’m panicking, chance it’s cold something think is? seen prestigious medical journal: “Duh” fair driver driving hours without mask, virus already circulating widely car, putting mask last minute might reassure you, might safer. Yeah man, totally safe til yall brought purel mix... start referring virus Trump Virus? That's become. you’re labeled racist say TX elects stupidest among them, represent town going celebrations normal Except start doubling 😥 🙏 state never ceases astound me. That's wrong, refer school kids plague rats reason. common knowledge kids get sick lot first going daycare school setting. pediatrician warned us thing years ago. Goddamn  Agreed! Remember **Pretty Woman (1990)** America all. land ""I got mine fuck you"". add Steve Jobs list : billionaire believe type Charity all. man younger, became multi-millionaire yet allowed infant daughter baby-momma live homeless streets. Shhhh, that’s hate speech here. 

I get though, society almost requires two earner households. made work spring idea we’d full school year. wrong, sadly. I’m Portland, ME. seems like small businesses requiring masks, big stores (like Hannaford closest downtown) switched signs “suggesting” wear mask. They’ve also greatly increased capacity (was set around 75 weeks ago; it’s around 215). Fridge horror kicks remember people believe virus Chinese weapon :( still protect wearer article states better originally thought Hahaha Europe, specifically Italy, really know make crisis first started partially excusable things got bad did. benefit hindsight tons knowledge gathered since February, reprehensible US continuing respond situation. beyond inexcusable many states mostly fully open taking precautions kind. USA brink could become largest loss life they've ever experienced. Death rate going though... Coincidence East Coast states track snuff ones lack large public beaches? I've never heard someone say ""Can't wait put toes sand Vermont shore.""  Dude, even Kalifornia said enforced pandemic. Wear fucking mask. do, carry everywhere I’m legally allowed to. don’t know anyone that’s ever died cancer. Therefore cancer isn’t real. That’s shitty logic is. Looking state (NC) appears dropoff lockdown increased Phase 2. go Phase 3 rise Daiwa Number One Dont worry; vain. Europe (excepting England) learned States Italy. vast majority Americans find Sweden map, Texas news right that's gave example, could picked state help people figure numbers mean except picking one that's currently news

The question asking Googled somebody wants oh, point say one areas methodology better another one group different part curve least give kind perspective numbers. Even within America people comprehend fact Arizona much difficult position right Texas Florida. numbers much lower population much lower proportionately multiple days recently they've twice many per capita cases larger state truth, damn lucky this. Julia Roberts’ one rule Pretty Woman taken weird turn. No, it’s nothing, don’t pretend otherwise. What's rate permanent lifelong organ damage survivors? Governor's tweet. 

Isn't reasonable associate governor's tweet government? understand people thought one way street. 

Because CDC lied masks protected supply, lied one-way street save face first lie. it’s entirely different culture. People use/reuse/share communal areas, cups, silverware, bags, etc, commonly without washing. poorer people especially, like slums post misleading. headline article actually: ""NY, NJ Longer Track Contain COVID, Group Says, US Breaks Daily Case Record Again"" emergency health safety order often power law, absolutely. would lungs get torn up? DoD says expect 12-18 months See wonder politicians situation actually don’t trust science pandering. They're also lowest deaths 3 months. re-opened 2 months ago cries they'd run body bags sheer number people die getting bad. 2nd lockdown coming. 40% states already rolling back re-openings. Even per White House reopening guidelines many states due back previous phase. Restaurants bars already closed big cities. That’s 2nd furlough, 2nd lay-off people. absolutely HORRIBLE. literally cannot believe happening right now. terrible! love God please release vaccines forego clinical trials, need miracle here! Actually joke people 100% trying get Jesse Ventura run rn lol. Rock, similar train thought. like 18 days used say ""it takes village raise child"" - maybe going back makes sense. One person sit 4-5 kids, gives 4-10 parents opportunity pull money.


Close circles, personal controls infection, three families make difference extra family. That's four families food table roof heads 2yo happily wears mask take (doctors appointments). ""terrible twos"" child smarter well behaved half fricken country?

He seriously loves mask. Happily shouts park somewhere. make extra one wants wear around house. (His mickey mouse pattern =)) No, that's he's jail headline.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's true, masks filter viral particles. filters. People think mask works like fence trying stop mosquito, like trying shoot arrow thru tree. viral particles touches fiber sticky coating viral particles makes stick mask. N95 .3 micron particle test 100% reflection viral particles behave. real term it

Like unicorns phlogiston? work wedding industry weddings starting August 8th. extremely uncomfortable going, postponing weddings March - July (to next year), can’t afford go weddings give couples deposits back.

This mess. plan wearing mask still sucks. also red meat xenophobic base. agree That’s true. daughter born 2011. tough her, won’t last forever. still good life able take experience world her. everything keep active engaged, make sure proper schooling, something value taken experience. It’s ideal, nothing ever is. deaths attributed coronavirus death toll. known deaths. God wont stop torture, rape, murder innocent little kid, hell chance have. question either one take government money help business even though clearly still working? selfishness stupidity anti-maskers plus idiots like De Santis, NJ face another wave. enough people touched virus (directly loss family friends), mitigation efforts become intrinsic. Covid like STD. matter much people warned failing keep covered risky, take seriously they're personally affected.  No, Customer Always Right original, original context ""Each individual customer always correct"" line ""The customers always knows want"" ""Customers vote wallet"" best guess they're actively denying possibility getting ill face coming work day stay sane. Unfortunately, can't turn filters consciously, carry constructed reality 24/7 informs actions outside work, too. think 90+% healthcare workers agree doctor here. Bedside manners gone triage. kill people emotional inefficient instead productive robot. Garbage situation. Thank doctor sacrifice meant say. Houston least already point. Dallas approaching it. Admittedly move patients hospitals. Basically, looks like might set reenact happened NYC. Hopefully bad, since we're better overall care younger population. Plano? Also think it’s dumb hell. debated hours mask mandate lost pull mask suggestion. tomorrow, USA cases 2 days Canada whole pandemic Lol upon time America, Intelligence respected, shunned. Yeah Boston 100% indoors, maybe 80-85% outdoors. getting little lax outside, think people started taking seriously past days. never said states use triage literally every hospital world Bound national criteria States, gave one example one state recently changed law

The last line said longer true state Tennessee. Quality life length life longer criteria use they're supposed use Whoever best chance making particular illness

So hypothetical got 20 year old who's great health overall pretty terrible condition virus get 50 year old poor overall health handling virus well they'll likely treat older patients true, least United States.

You may remain silent unless testimony self-incriminating, protected Fifth Amendment. 

And can't say ""5A"" walk almost one would ever testify. Lots people pull Fifth Amendment astonished judge rules compels talk. Get well, stay strong 🙏 wrong many ways direct comparison like that...

&amp;#x200B;

1. Swedes Texans willingly tested ?
2. tests availiability places ?
3. death rates 100% sure - places actually enough testing also test deaths pnenumia (as example)

Just saying comparisons simple put out..

(English first language, might figured spelling:) agree it’s ignorance, say general pop hometown lot trashier uneducated even ten years ago. could economic thing. went putting people moon large portion population thinking Earth flat. winning, losing lot ground. Bloody hell! Italy 300 excess deaths per day went expanded lockdown nationwide. Excess deaths total 47,000 population around 60,000,000. number ICU beds per capita comparable USA, though I'm sure Texas compares states. hope make through.  so? gem Prime Minister modi announced first lockdown notice 4 hours every one stuck wherever were

Why always this? Demonetization given short notice

Does get hard every time this? daily new cases count positive anti body tests?

No, PCR tests cptlsm death cult Agreed. also doubt lot daycares even survive unemployment numbers. Plus people WFH long term (and people possibly moving LCOL areas). Plus already declining birth rate pre-COVID. friends NYC reevaluating staying they're stuck older parents option childcare costs rolling shutdowns. Unless states countries rolled numbers make look better actually are, daily new infections people new diagnosis, antibodies. They're different tests anyway. states. Individual hospitals too. Wow wonder why? Let's see. Testing Tennessee two weeks ago around 10k per day around 25k per day. 

It's almost increased number cases correlate increased testing state Tennessee. Fascinating stuff. Sad entirely predictable outcome bad decisions Anecdotal evidence followed unrelated chart. even quip end telling downvote!

Wow, post worthless. Speaking that, let's pray quiet hurricane season. Evacuating major coastal city pandemic problematic best. People use public transport evacuate public shelters would presented terrible choice. would choose stay home, requiring rescue. Helpers like National Guard Cajun Navy work crews, exposing virus.

I'm sure people plan emergencies working solutions, solutions would imperfect. day April! Texas reporting covid deaths pneumonia deaths. Yep, here’s graphic.  forest fire analogy works best. president took 19 hour car ride Yucatan want forced wear facemask plane,

[And came Like much getting rid president's private plans shows cutting money like.... pandemic!!!!!  Boy sounds ominous sudden.  It’s say EVERYONE going get it, maybe worst case 70%, even could asymptomatic. vaccine could available early next year. RemindMe! 9 Days Canada Australia pretty fat okay. Hope right, expecting though Obviously always case someone could drive thru test covid19 NY.. careful information, Bloomberg really furious current Mexican government lately published aggressive articles editorials it: liberal conservative media owners agenda.   said done I'm dead-infected, I'm shopping spree trekking ghostown Florida real estate. I'll enjoy blocks block self Antarctica calves.  mean.. Alabama. guys expect? Maybe lack mask compliance isn’t helping.

An understatement epic proportions. Well played  really gotta stop acting like young Americans. swva, lot 40-50 year olds absolutely refusing wear masks still going public gatherings such. Plenty going Myrtle Beach.

Our governor put us phase 3 too, restaurants full capacity. Awesome, thanks!! FYI, guy ^ one [""it's types, despite claiming lost parents it. Winter coming Oral...? Yes please! Lol flex geographically possible still living Houston driving unspoken Texas speed limit 80mph ""Good News"" virus. guys need revolution clean immoral morons all.  Actually herd immunity happening given. There's concern immunity (antibodies) lasts long. know yet start see reinfections screwed working vaccine created. popcorn $1.50 bag folks can’t believe much sack shit is. It’s truest unbelievable. Grown adults know admit wrong. seriously don’t know adult stubborn moronic, pleasure dumbest fuck leading country. needs held accountable this. nightmare. Red cross free antibody testing donate. feel like mentioned more. Donate blood get free test. Win win far I'm concerned. Nah. EU citizens/residents return. Yeah, reason people bit vary, probably rush full head things. administering vaccine everyone right bat probably doesnt need done. mean, there's difference giving vaccine cause long term consequences someone 90 years old someone twenty example. One group likely suffer long long time hypothetical consequences, probably even get enough time start getting them. that, they're going get fired likely deported/sent ICE camp decide stop coming health reasons. bad situation could rectified government would offer amnesty people order make sure they're staying safe getting infected work. live Mt. Lebanon work downtown idea talking about. Virtually everyone wears mask, better others, it’s nearly abysmal making be. USA. USA. USA. Back Back Back world champions wondering - catch 'corona virus'.

No, think so.

But yeah, next time call cops, that's brainwashed CNN believer would do. Shiiikt Houston Los Angelos getting wet feet though would note, compared India US testing per capita total. 

The main problem isn’t lack testing, US decently compared others, though obviously need better. main concern people interacting insane lack mask wearing. God damnit people PA, NJ, NY wasn’t good enough example failures getting ahead disease??? couldn’t even leave house 3 fucking weeks, food shelves, y’all kept living lives. 

Worst part know 3 people area PA took vacation Florida last week. 

Oi vey sad even monumental fuck response, images bodies New York huge losses &amp; infection rates US, see regular videos 'anti-mask' ""Karen's"" superiority complex feeling like wearing mask protect &amp; others somehow violation rights. Fuckin need get themselves. know contact tracing underdeveloped areas work. brought Ebola outbreak control DRC. know anything DRC India know much harder DRC. first hand contact tracing DRC, CAR, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Guinea. 

So yes, know incredibly difficult impossible all. contact tracing qualifications? Ah okay, thank you!! Nearly every inpatient already gets enoxaparin heparin dvt prophylaxis. Enjoy, good news.......

  Honshu 7th largest island earth. significantly larger majority US states. also population ~100m half population America.

No amount information going convince people railing masks. even got county officials sherrifs anti mask side. can't sway people facts suggestions.

German Japanese people sense civic responsibility present extent America. also acted decisively unison curtail spread. can't expect Americans behave exactly like Japanese public showed little informational video masks. Like vice chancellor much purpose. Alcohol ingrained Modern culture it’s really getting annoying. 4 month likely resolving acute phase illness rather chronic long term complication Thanks. call disposable workers feels way. threads reading? People threads back talking millions deaths, 1-2% entire US population good shit.

From wiki linked above:
In book, Lifton outlines the ""Eight Criteria Thought Reform"":

Milieu Control. involves control information communication within environment and, ultimately, within individual, resulting significant degree isolation society large.

Mystical Manipulation. manipulation experiences appears spontaneous is, fact, planned orchestrated group leaders order demonstrate divine authority, spiritual advancement, exceptional talent insight sets leader and/or group apart humanity, allows reinterpretation historical events, scripture, experiences. Coincidences happenstance oddities interpreted omens prophecies.

Demand Purity. world viewed black white members constantly exhorted conform ideology group strive perfection. induction guilt and/or shame powerful control device used here.

Confession. Sins, defined group, confessed either personal monitor publicly group. confidentiality; members' ""sins,"" ""attitudes,"" ""faults"" discussed exploited leaders.

Sacred Science. group's doctrine ideology considered ultimate Truth, beyond questioning dispute. Truth found outside group. leader, spokesperson God humanity, likewise criticism.

Loading Language. group interprets uses words phrases new ways often outside world understand. jargon consists of thought-terminating clichés, serve alter members' thought processes conform group's way thinking.

Doctrine person. Members' personal experiences subordinated sacred science contrary experiences must denied reinterpreted fit ideology group.

Dispensing existence. group prerogative decide right exist not. usually literal means outside world saved, unenlightened, unconscious must converted group's ideology. join group critical group, must rejected members. Thus, outside world loses credibility. conjunction, member leave group, must rejected also.[3] long error rate known, tests pretty useless. many states opened rapidly freeze opening close data bound irresponsible or, worse, downright denying-Covid- exists part society voluntarily participating reopen many places. we'd actually waited numbers drop off, followed strict phases, seen federal government states prioritize public health give economic support necessary instead counting reopening economy, things open, participation would even. Yeah joke, people themselves. elastic band become tangled thing head? We're talkin' BIGLY trouble now! schools reopening fall? 

People pushing close citizen non-America, starting get boring watching guys realisations. sound hysterical. USA USA USA!!! Canadian seems like I'm fucking groundhog day scenario here. Watching conversations months ago tried fix everything, right back even worse Prayers?
Don't think sky man following news. Yeah, half truth worded. allowed travel allowed travel Denmark without certain justified reasons.

A nondescript Swede cannot choose take vacation Denmark, much understand true. Can't wait see America's army wheeze way slowly towards Chinese border. Going fucking awesome show.

I hope conscript every single Redditor first. Nope considered repost even source info provided is. Sorry. 

Take care, stay safe! enclosed space, air circulation way important distance. Look infectious person bus infected people sitting far away person next him/her. 'intellectual' can't argue anything said - fact based - instead resort insults. Interesting. Batten butthole kids, go overdrive. 

Seriously tho, hope use time drastically reform Healthcare system, nation, ourselves. whole year made painfully obvious several changes need made. Stop hysteria?

Go ahead join cult lung compromised enjoy half-life expectancy.

 Vietnam killed virus. 

You cant country huge India. Imagine wearing mask agree! IMO helping polite, tell think they're crazy party time like this. listen may help drive point home later. fatality rate? take people quarantine sites, enforce quarantines? honor system US that's clearly working. mean that’s really point beach report say people don’t already know think lie terrible. think people behind lie assumed people would act poorly may right, make lie acceptable. 

And everybody lied. Here's article mid-March pretty much says I've said:

 

I say truth ""so obvious"", said truth available, anyone healthy amount skepticism comes politicians media, would done homework. DaDumbass performing Surge?  VP vows ‘keep opening America’ U.S. sets new record coronavirus cases

Hard believe appears someone even dumber boss. really feeling effects depression stepping bodies plague rats?

Great. already that. Sadly, impeachment apparently new slap wrist. move better county. Massachusetts, walk clinic. Like getting flushot DaIdiot big diverse state - Austin probably 90-95% people wearing masks mandatory (at least saw limited excursions grocery Home Depot) ...has it? Nah, tomorrow light holiday state employees half assed numbers. airbnbs I've rented even viewed online specifically stated PARTIES.  true least past two years. :( GED okay? Touch Cloth absolute pinnacle 21st century comedy. many good jokes coming pause periodically catch breath

also, Nielsen straight nan writing others. personally confused (but delighted) turning career towards comedy (he great bit 1991 SNL monologue). watch lot older tv movies pops time serious roles Bless hearts. Canada yesterday entire country 216 cases. still organized Canada Day plans. fireworks, concerts anything. We're still taking thing way seriously US fraction cases. crazy. Makes sense, according relatives Florida coronavirus “isn’t bad all.” drove frat house near grand old party. South African vaccine, french, american, british. SOUTH AFRICAN. test works, Africa able vaccine. article said, Africa always back queue. shown polio vaccine. Many countries eradicated polio, Africa still struggling it. covid-19 vaccine. Africa middle east last get it. suffer others get act like exist.

These people volunteered. People protest want, won’t change fact people volunteered injected vaccine. go party 4th, remember, part reason man like dies. working supermarkets behind plexiglass screen- atleast cashiers UK are. It’s installed UK supermarkets shops now. Workers would wearing masks/ gloves restocking shop floor. It’s known virus struggles spread surfaces, spreads easily it’s aerosolised. long they’re restocking shelves night (which are, closing night restock) chance infected *very* small.. think so. wife quarantined Australia believe. It’s 15 going zero, /s city one first issue shelter place order, pretty much said outright enforce it. still sends message citizens that: right thing do, serious situation, gov't nothing. felt really good seeing local gov't take proactive actions.

I think federal government's lack action really set us course. unenforced national mask mandate would done _a lot_ 2 months ago. keeps getting spread around massive misunderstanding data. CDC even show ""deaths pnumonia without Covid"" show ""deaths pnumonia without Covid"". course number would increased. whole point data show seriously dangerous virus is, directly indirectly. people need get fuckin heads *strictly* follow health guidelines want beat shit. 

The people ignore health guidelines, people directly die Covid, also longer shutdowns, longer economy suffer, longer people suffer economically mentally, longer chronic illnesses go unchecked, therefore deaths result situation. 

So yes, excess deaths Covid one way another. literally skyrocketing right now. 3 hours left today eastern Standard time. 6 hours left today west coast think statistic looking basically ""average number people live one square mile area around average person"".

You compare raw population per square mile. They're people perfectly spread within state. Thank you. Sounds eerie problem  I'll solve  hook DJ revolves It’s good news it’s data. 

Also, don’t think anyone speculate number people “left go”. depends long immunity lasts populations already infected.

We little point many cases community. Especially US continues allow domestic travel rarely tests asymptotic contacts. least mask. know, think country might taking whole coronavirus thing seriously enough. flying blind disaster Can't speak chains fast food recent years 70% drive-thru 30% eat-in take capacity generally issue rare occasions. two weeks, bro! we'll tell two weeks! explain properly:

The first part curve called ""Denial""

The second part curve called ""Too Late!!!!""

See? simple. everyone car?

I'd say reason fact lines many hours long... like one got city, basically warning residents increased virus spread, recommending high risk health conditions stay home. would factor exponential spread? Case counts grim milestones psychopath. I’m training ultramarathon currently covid. get winded walking bathroom. anyone sources whether lung damage permanent temporary? I’m terrified going negatively impact running   I'm actually appalled people believed begin with. I'm talking adults community graduate level STEM degrees. I’m happy they’re able re-open, sad image restaurant businesses also investments? enough credit take loans financial backing people pay food pay slightly less cost salary, food, rent, livelihood, investment.

Do want restaurants give food free patrons? want government legally mandate patrons pay food now, go payment months later?

You can't stop one link economic chain, push responsibility next chainlink, expect things OK, needs stop restart time.

If really think it, stop rent, stop mortgage property tax let real investors (401k, mutual funds, etc) take hit. Except securities owned wealthy boomers (they've time invest). Sure, would like clearly see trends free effects end earlier peak north. reckon national totals much use country diverse huge US Texas Arizona starting ICUs overrun like seen before. Houston 102% capacity icu beds. deaths start skyrocket last time. ICU beds get overrun, ends less choosing critical patients get ventilator, not. We’ve done before. know it’s exponential. Current US infection totals 2.74 million 130k deaths, figures using? bailout went rich anyone else, pushing people back work. article missing list criteria given Joebob Steaksmart street. Clinical diagnosis structured regimented process Drs nurses medical licenses removed willy nilly diagnose people illness without significant evidence likelihood. similar argument ""Anyone dies sick Covid19 automatically coded Covid19 death"". established processes medical examiners, doctors, nurses, many medical professionals follow time. legit doctor diagnosing Covid19 based tenous information, doctor going code someone Covid19 death die car accident. complicated mechanism, that's sometimes misleading look simple slice mechanism without discussing pieces tie it.

Also: vast *VAST* majority medical health professionals care deeply saving lives. Coding death incorrectly legal implications(malpractice example. no, guidance state Texas would supersede general medical practice ignored.), also moral personal implications. There's nothing gain artificially inflating case numbers Drs state Texas, I'm really sure *why* state would want make look like they're worse are. Especially states resistant even wear masks close bars.

I appreciate willing provide source, think re-think position issue. complicated one nobody anything gain what's going right now. bad everyone. I’m sorry go that. I’ve mild (lol) flu, still thought might actually die hurt bad. It’s hard understand seriousness flu actually see hit someone young strong. many people think it’s cold. It’s beast. 

I’m angry you. Unless mortgage bank wants sold payments continue. took charon video Guessing that’s american problem mostly... hope get sense. slowed lot NYC hit 20 percent so. someone able critically think would understand that. spanish Duolingo-quality read this: ""Si eso se llama colapso, sé cómo llamarlo."" (If collapse, know call it.) guy blue shirt wear mask correctly. cover nose. Sounds like father, mine always finds convoluted reason leave house every day worst part, used way (he's retired happened.) misspelled humans #1 worst educated? Mississippi always forget. mandates great have. allows businesses enforce clear set rules. 

It’s interesting see resistance, unfortunately people really struggle masks. people generally less 5% populations see countries.

If country obesity problem would also add respiratory issues.

If masks deemed way continue live lives while, people going start it, whether like not. sucks seems like possibility. I’m also personally (because looks like intelligent thing community).

We don’t get choose first this. Pandemics don’t care selfish interests. Excess mortality gives indication retrospect. Cool, 130k dead 27 million infected. 1 million+ dead left go. ""Good news” saw Brazil cutting lead response we're running score. going let anyone come close us cases deaths. USA! USA! USA! douchebags Cool! Can’t argue :). 

Once feel like completely missed point though. failure government \+1 allergies exacerbate breathing issues tachycardia Oh poor dears, took bailout money you’re allowed lay anyone off.  Tsk. don’t go anywhere without mask. take precautions. wonder ever break total case count China 24 hour period. would nucking futs I'm sure accurate not, look California state website shows 4.4% increase cases today. implies 9740 number correct. possible got percentage increase wrong, state website definitely indirectly saying number. time G4 EA H1N1 takes brain process extra. one time please ! 1/10 cases identified testing. actually go like 1/20 cases testing overloaded many tests. 500,000 cases day right now. probably get couple million per day peak. Cases started tick around June 16th... 2 weeks ago... exploded late last week... $11 die? That's good deal! Oh boohoo poor reminder, 3 weeks NYs highest level shutdown peak hospitalizations ! talking yesterday numbers clear, doesn’t seem like beach itself. city’s name beach it, leading confusion. outbreak mostly traced house party. Wear masks cases. AZ used many cases idiots got together said fuck safety want get drunk party bunch cases. Fuck selfish people.

It's hard navigate this. Essential oils. Man shit fix anything...🤦🏻 Thanks Donald Trump. expected recent protests riots know around 37 friends 11 states work healthcare. 

Curiously acendotes matter shit. mean actual data form something called excess deaths. absolutely marking cause Covid.

Whose they? clear understand death certificates work. See there's primary cause death say heart attack secondary causes example Covid-19 since caused heart attack.

What arguing someone dies stroke heart attack Covid-19 counted Covid death.

You also believe somehow loosing thousands extra people week even less excess due cronovirus think they're reclassifying deaths would happened anyway Covid deaths. 

So mind coincidental spike mortality causes point could reclassify deaths estimate covid-19 deaths yet still show number excess deaths (from causes). Uh huh sure buddy. completely impractical solution working parents, par sending kids all. wonder system. puts windpipe close esophagus? That's usually really rich people do. Living reality.

Massachusetts actually studied it. Showed 2.5% people went protests covid tested. Depends look it. Wayne county (where 90% cases were) way down. almost counties rising up.

I believe phrase ""a distinction without difference"" NYU student returning home China **started outbreak spread** 71 people.

The student apparently infected one person, neighbor, spread one person, 87 year-old man, man managed spread dozen more.

I'm also little skeptical this, article says student fully asymptomatic/tested negative somehow gave neighbor ""by contaminating building."" earth contract tracers certain girl source? Maybe Chinese authorities incentive want link outbreak US rather admit spread locally know came from? joke, that’s all, covid-19 much dangerous flu, plus heard health seventeen year old died so... One Pts 02, CHF/COPD, chronic lung issues, frequent pneumonia. gets breath walking bathroom, ten feet.

He wears one fine. weird doesnt include Minnesota cases per day dropped half high single digit deaths 30 day. moved St Augustine retrieve sailboat. confirm. Masks optional, wearing them. I’m living aboard, trying avoid people... America shithole failed state. Cotton disposable ear loop masks. I'm pretty sure I've read articles stated many cases attributed pneumonia flu, probably coronavirus, US. get covid die.  Yup. Two weeks now, 50k look pretty good. make admirable. case, recklessly foolish. first heard this. look it, thanks. :) pretty good research stuff. half (49,2%) adult population living upper-bound poverty line (UBPL).  people sacrificing others, first responders, medical professionals, essential workers, people come contact with. Christian patriotic act. That's interesting. Thanks education. Glad guy ended negative, I'd tested two times. Hey, catch UK deaths per capita yet. Even universal healthcare government useless we're 40,000 excess deaths. Yeah ones known....and still remember people telling ""minor"" supposedly was, heart goes yous America.

Stay safe mean , models showed surge. I’m surprised. Lawmakers thought otherwise. site show 50,298 US? click link shows Oregon.

When click USA site, see 50,298. 

Please clarify. I'm really actual doctor, definitely random person reddit. certificate immune COVID. also absolves wear mask. importantly, I'm real doctor. fair enough equal distribution month First 1k day Ohio. technically one almost tests result mass prison test. Eh trach capped picture. good chance able take food orally. could still PEG tube place I've seen similar patients like PEG tube complications removed since able tolerate oral. No, better, bad. think allowed 4 months it. people still getting it. exactly happened New Jersey; testing around 55% positive days. similar HIV may damage men's fertility. right say they're slowly telling potential damage virus dobt want panic see bigger danger virus. guarantee get downvotwd even though many people know it. Lmao. USA collapse see advocate hysteria hard back up. there's never need nutty behavior, especially crisis. 

a perfect example dig texas' hospital situation. found article percent icu beds taken covid patients. rest non covid reasons (72 percent). hospital admin also says alarmed numbers; last year time icu 95% capacity sans pandemic. 

chill! yes. i've wearing mask since beginning, fauci cdc rep tv time guy joe rogan's podcast - said hand washing thing keep people busy major transmissions airborne mask ya got one. 

things going okay. **4,260,621** active cases, 1% Serious/Critical 99% Mild/Recovering. 519K deaths worldwide **10 MILLION** infections. 

continue MASK UP, social distance encourage everyone know same. take care family. let stress fear get down. long people respond? It’s disconcerting...  USA seems treating race top, would someone please tell objective hit zero max score. average age people dying corona HIGHER average age person dies.

And country people died corona naturally people die from. cancer, heart disease murder etc etc. Newer cases younger help, hospitals get overrun new hotspots we're going see *so* much demise. percentage Covid patients suffer lasting side effects? 


About 50% wear damn mask. Actions speak louder! remember watching video somewhere Reddit nutjob Fox News saying US never bad Italy, listing reasons Italy got hit bad (back March) effective health system America is. 

Can’t remember video get link though. (Or know attach link) School isn’t free childcare. It’s education children. worried education receive.

Nah man. say parents use child care maximize work leverage mortgage live nice inner city condo high operating costs? Lol “waits millennial bashing begin”

Seriously, millennial here. Everybody know that’s age group socially responsible holding tide. We’ve came collective conclusion go irresponsible, get sick, get massive medical bills tacked student debt parents grandparents might die. 

We getting yelled boomers, Karen’s X’ers. people dearly afraid freedom tread wear mask stay home. I’ve coworkers berated gray hairs asking socially distance wear mask. 

I know going get brunt blame spread younger people making majority positive cases. going post another 12 posts tell 'not worth effort' is, - ass handed nothing back argument - going say ' tRoLliNg U', like last time? Tesla money Ford GM? No... don't. mental gymnastics

I keep telling people, Mental Gymnastics Olympic sport, US would take Bronze, Silver, Gold. volunteer based trial.

These people smart... May god bless crazy people listen Politicians Doctors comes Disease.

It's like taking advice mail man fix car mechanic. shocking business owner shut part business realize 70% profits? think would kind thing know run business. also treat speed limit lower limit rather upper limit. bad title Hippocratic oath legal ramifications. Excellent Nothing worry about, dear leader said virus disappear own. Thanks :) Goto class. Christian agree. God gave us free reason. Thoughts prayers nice gesture truly need science facts. Maybe got done watching movie Molly's Game. Would say people wear face masks told earlier pandemic work?

Just wondering... people thought people believed dumb, took precautions anyway wore face masks regardless.

Just saying... counties states required report active cases verified lab results, new cases. states it, not. Masks work. point data presented properly, fewer people would grounds question obvious faults. Right US data dart board. LOL, test more, find more! would thought! virus sereology studies claimed high prevalence exaggeration virus IFR around 1%. good news R0 ridiculously high controlled social distancing. Damn it. say first paragraph issue we’ve politicized wearing masks. proceed politicize it. You’re typing masks immunity protests couldn’t possibly ANYTHING case increases. Protests mask-non-conformists led increase cases. nothing wrong saying that, truth. takes lily pads 50 days completely cover pond. coverage pads doubles every day. day pond half covered?

When people correctly answer simple math problem, understand dangerous virus truly is. Fruit bats, civets, animals also investigated possible animal reservoirs coronavirus. truth research thus far focused virus *came from*, could go future, one knows date animal reservoirs. tell medical school, learned adaptability coronaviruses (many others important veterinary medicine attack many different animals), little MFers evolve quickly. SARS-CoV-2 probably went bat pangolin human ACE2 receptors relatively short Pfft, well obviously answer ""less testing"" then!  This, right fucking here. *real* leadership beginning would much better point. Donnie Death President Numbnuts, country going take huge hit *every* front. X Wait that's 50,298 new cases reported today??? Holy shit....That's 6 times countries overall infections. Great work guys ! I’ve never proud American neighbours lol Man miss bush That’s BLM protesters.  Unfortunately, don’t think work. Antibodies aren’t lasting long enough. new study China showed antibodies faded quickly asymptomatic symptomatic COVID-19 patients convalescence, raising questions whether illness leads lasting immunity virus afterward.

The study, focused 37 asymptomatic 37 symptomatic patients, showed 90% groups showed steep declines levels SARS-COV-2–specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies within 2 3 months onset infection, according report published yesterday Nature Medicine. Further, 40% asymptomatic group tested negative IgG antibodies 8 weeks released isolation.

The authors said findings suggest could risky assume recovered patients immune reinfection, may implications long maintain physical distancing restrictions. mcdonalds ever close? ive going like week months. place still open late night town. calculating 5 month period previous years numbers fact stacked months every year?

the risk certainly low, young people still encouraged wear masks, wash hands, socially distance. much like drive, risk car crash relatively low, still wear seatbelt avoid texting/drinking driving. America! hell going there!?

Here Aus we're freaking second wave consecutive days 70-80 new cases one state... 10k day one state mind boggling!

Thats one busy December.  absence mail voting, voting person likely subject higher possibility infection going retail locations. . . . Florida West. [The August gonna rough.

There's every reason people actually riot real August rate. arguments ""this neighborhood stop trashing it"" longer mean anything there's even pretense true. spread slower rate hospitals care everyone gets seriously ill though. point, lot countries way past containment phase. say, open, really wonder many people show up.

So leave theory ""herd immunity""? gave fuck economy, minimum wage would higher, healthcare would universal, wouldn’t tried trickle-down economics FOUR fucking times, would much greater emphasis education making available everyone. require National Guard patrolling streets, delivering supplies, transportation ill doctor.

This sounds like dystopian nightmare, that's much worse outcome letting virus run course like Sweden did. Depends kind zombies get. ones get super human fast, infect scratch shamblers. least lots boats leave by.

Believe me, know. 75 year old mother COPD poorly managed diabetes anti-masker believe social distancing. I'm trying grieve doubt last year. Oh totally agree there, mass history train wrecks! commenting fact Baker really stayed course COVID wise bowed pressure reopen health state seems getting better initial outbreak. I’m western mass could look different eastern end state. Im happy Italy. Saludos desde España! You’re qualified! Walmart, *in general*, pretty sketch. Damn American citizens practicing rights guaranteed constitution. Plus, mega-churches pack 10,000 unmasked holy-rollers every service. Maybe tell Kane masks ELECTROLYTES? Herd immunity perhaps?

Considering fatality rate far 1% probably half country already contracted it, guess we’ll fine. possibility binding hACE2 Spike-RBD sufficient, own, infect humans, molecular components first needed acquire new functions so. second possibility virus may capable infecting human cells longer period time past, ancestral form either presented far fewer symptoms (making less disruptive and/or noticeable infected), far less infectious (thereby impacting small number people), either case escaping notice public health monitoring

The authors aren’t definitively saying it’s circulating humans since 2013, it’s able bind ACE2 receptor long. Well really matters early stages (as would assume everyone it) husband nurse hospital major city Ontario, Canada. test anyone anything close symptoms, anyone could potentially high risk. cases unit, one floor, caught anyone contacted notified. think one staff member got (probably community spread). Now, new cases city. We've really able control it, testing people hospital really helps. staff exposed, likely spread community. cases control, overwhelming test everyone. really need ability test everyone could it. hope antibody tests end working well. Redditt. faster accurate anything else there. Blows mind. Everytime. real problem lack staff maintain converted ICU beds. ICU wards need 1 ICU nurse every 2 beds. stretch bit 3-4 beds per nurse short period time couple weeks nurses exhausted. 

So it’s necessarily big deal convert 1000 normal hospital beds ICU wards it’s bit difficult get hands 500 extra ICU nurses. It’s like huge pool tens thousands ICU nurses sitting around waiting something do. Doesn’t matter go. College put it. It’s stupid go Ivy League you’re intending attending graduate school somewhere else, Alabama offers(ed) full tuition 3.5 GPA 32 ACT honestly chump stats free college. Yeah. give comments gold think really dumb. click “give gold” button.  Choke call whore read, concludes insurance companies responsible ""luxury"" testing. (For lack better term).

I think workplace requires tested return work, employer pony up. example testing sending child camp decide take trip security positive leaving, well, that's kinda fucked. literally removing sense responsibility individuals prevent transmission putting behind paywall.

How many people go hungry make enough money? children too. Literally deciding people what's important offering shit free.

The president said it'd free (lying dick per usual) countries offer free. mentioned free well treatment FUCKING GLOBAL PANDEMIC DICKS! Part problem definitely People powerful positions leaders downplaying it, combined media saying whole ""its really anything flu"". People get flu time fine.  think reality living 2020, science medicine far advanced, disease like much process. one person tests positive asymptomatic, flu like symptoms week, would rather grasp realize disease could end I’m actually feeling pretty solid shots. I’d volunteer too. means faster protection kids family, bet. I’ll roll dice. Trump makes distinction government. mind him, can't fathom could possibly better. Fast people getting fine. mostly young adults Texas days things ship shape. major death numbers also decline. dwindle soon enough. Wow.

I'm sorry. That's awful I’m also PA. Judging comments looks like county live rare. 500k people county, 4K confirmed covid cases. (Yes know it’s probably higher). less 1% total population lot cases nursing homes. Everywhere go people wearing masks, it’s rare see someone without one. Point guess, follow CDC guidelines, thing controlled. don’t understand grown adults find difficult. people hit head truth still kind conspiracy ones love get sick die. (not sure still on) tv show house flips. bad honestly. ridiculous part even what’s best economy. Controlling virus would quickest simplest route economic recovery. mean government officials really expect people go spend money hospital system crushed virus?  close? missed this. encourage read David Goggins book ""can't hurt me"".

I rest case honestly wish happy healthy life, full love joy. provide sources? need learn you’re reading protecting American public large override constitution? 
Like, we're allowed guns, without laws help control them. laws take away ability guns.  
We allowed drink, illegal drink drive. Breaking laws result losing license. 
Coming side country, I'm sure familiar states counties ticketing people bad snow events, different? 
We allowed drive, must show able so. 
They taking away right move freely, trying protect public anyone see bad thing insane me. kicker endangering families along everyone else come contact with.

Stupidity like needs ended force. 

Enough talking. Fuck rights.

People right die fn idiots refusing simple thing like wearing mask public fn PLAGUE!!! Yeah bad. Either mask malicious compliance covering properly. distancing outside places forced. dodged initial wave everyone thinks invincible here. Taking consideration higher class sick thinking rest gives goosebumps. Hope doesn’t get worst Majora's mask vibe, like idea! believe it. McDonalds mega corp trying see covid class-action lawsuits. Assuming 2 week lag infections deaths inflection point wouldn’t couple days now. see. Looking forward attending covid rebellion festival 2022. family lives Cleveland swear every single time talk them, tell incredibly careful they're being. tell they're leave party event. ""We wear masks. swimming....we canoeing...its birthday party.....its gonna small get together 20 people."" Drives crazy. live northern california thankfully people wearing masks. I’ll happy trump starts wearing mask trying enforce makes think Chinese people criticizing government/policies?

Can read Chinese visit Chinese websites like Weibo/Zhihu first handed account/information?

Or somehow got know ""China"" ""Free"" media sources, thinking understood country people grew here?

Typical America exceptionalism. Block newsfeed (plenty extensions this), use check people &amp; groups want look at. Best worlds. element truth that.

But, also must said, cases risen considerably late. ""wait 2 weeks"" chant right certain point regards large surge cases.

So, cautious jeering them. Rare person life bats 0% 100% regards opinions predictions.   Also, beginning pandemic people severe symptoms tested possibly causing hospitalizations jump along positive cases. testing os readily available, probably delay due people getting tested earlier cycle. use Chris Cuomo public example. isolated basement, wife delivering meals/collecting dirty plates enough infect rest household. don’t freedom send kids summer camp right now. Parents in, say, New Zealand freedom send kids school. I’m insanely jealous this.

I can’t go favorite bar drink without fearing life. Another case people choosing religion science. Sometimes wonder human race made far. rhyme baron articles day that, basically said. Conspiracy theorists opposite recommendation actually wearing beginning told masks help.  That's look pandemic. look percentage positive tests. goes up, like is, florida is/will screwed. get union pushback (and rightfully so), real reason backed state didn’t give approval won’t release theme park reopening guidelines July 4. Triple H fanbois aka NXTcels crying lol talked relative yesterday said upset government solving problem Covid19 virus. Question, government/nation solved problem yet? America bout quarantined rest world Username checks out. ac indoor banned

TWiV reviews new H1N1 swine influenza virus China pandemic potential, Ad5 vectored SARS-CoV-2 oral vaccine candidate, Operation Warp Speed vaccine candidates, FDA guidance vaccine approval, answer listener email.


Links episode

New swine flu pandemic potential (BBC, PNAS) 12:18

Oral SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate (ClinicalOmics) 24:19

Operation Warp Speed (HHS) 31:24
ACTIV (NIH) 38:04

Development licensure COVID-19 vaccines (FDA) 41:39

Letters read TWiV 634 53:45 Another fucker wants us sacrifice lives economy. Hey asshole, money means nothing dead! Americans love Trump Virus. Sorry man. awful true. Many people care nothing except themselves. 

There plenty good people too, selfish dicks ate able ruin everything, even minority. 

We allowed punch people wear masks. Wow, that’s positive rate comparable NYC peak. Florida FTW. laughed hard authority implement quarantine? locals feds? man patience could dream having... groceries delivered fresh using delivery services. no, hard myself. Shipped right door. 

Ah people forced stay home since wait you. think entitled get put people danger? another county same. 
http://www.emporiagazette.com/free/article_3f03a08a-bc85-11ea-b53b-17ad52a8d619.html anxiety roof. Americans dont get now, never will. stupid prevail? see Reddit, Yes, Yes will. didn’t say 300k NY NJ. meant number nationally. 

As New York, ever recorded 12k confirmed infections peak epidemic. day, total number confirmed positives nyc 220k. early may antibody study found 20% prevalence antibodies. city 8m comes 1.6m people. early may nyc 200k known positives. There’s order magnitude difference here. 

I’m much downplaying current situation pointing we’ve lived much worse this. NYC completely unprepared, little testing (not fault), late shut (kinda fault), literally going day day procuring PPE. Subways cramming millions little boxes circulation. People didn’t masks wear, ton people didn’t really care. pretty much worst case scenario speed spread. Parts system failed: enough morgues, enough ambulances, hospitals packed capacity. large people got care spread controlled less 2 months people government adapted. What’s going Arizona Texas Florida nothing like this. able much better. governments already reacting, people react they’re sufficiently scared like New Yorkers were. Hmm. I'm kinda starting like you. think bit ""overreactor"" gonna mentality everything might well start hating every single country. ""news"" giving bad impression sweden might bit much, think. forget good qualities well. appreciate effort right actually needed. 

I believe attacked trolls though, normal people getting salty constant negative posting sweden getting defensive predictable understandable. would accept it, honestly. dimwits bring politics discussion damn virus

Your comments nothing politics. falsely claimed black people cause massive spread repeatedly debunked. conservative racists think virus tick serious flu

Another obvious lie. senile incompetent president responsible 100,000+ deaths, mass unemployment, cases time high end sight.
Cope gonna sweet

You honestly think stand chance guy called virus hoax allowed hostile foreign nation murder troops? Seek help. France like many countries. strange sometimes unpleasant two months hard lockdown. leave house except groceries. know ? good experience all. glad lived that. spend lot time thinking mortal existence life general. discover new priorities.

And all. worked !!!! Life basically back normal except masks social distancing. Countries like USA Brazil take proper measures stuck long slow process see positive end. Many deaths along way could avoided. hard teach people, importantly, take correctly.

It standard part first aid classes teaching them. Texans put egos aside wear them? sure hope so. forget tropical weather season predicted extra active year. Imagine couple category 4-5 hurricanes top this. Peak Darwinism No, that's Lieutenant Governor, much shithead. really problem reported multiple times...it’s comments acting though mutation end world! It’s really mutation know here! year easy third place cause death going harder thought Part teen taking un needed risks. I’m surprised all. whole lock happened tons adult parties rich neighborhood next me. much difference since little symptoms still spread it. knew really dumb kids growing could imagine something like this. That’s horrifying especially considering amount retirement communities state microscopic bathrooms? Lots people take long time bathroom filling space breath. fast filtered? Gibbs? Good thing military leaders protecting country threats! Beaches? I’d preferred titled “Greg Abbott Eat Bee.” Paul Gosar entered chat. Woo go Florida. everything big Texas. Exactly point. thing found weird backtracked China quite bit...he pretty critical beginning, one video seemed pull 180 Chinese safety video referred COVID “Honey Badger Virus” phrase coined it. 

I get you’re saying Chloroquine too. I’m quick judge ***always*** pro masks beginning, even everyone including called “experts”. pulled 180 too. Chloroquine became heavily politicized much like masks are, he’s always careful data claims makes it. It’s like goes says it’s miracle cure works everyone idk make fully yet. doesn’t daily vids anymore seems kinda backed away topic together, part he’s spot beginning track record leading back Jan vids. Wondering exceptions?

▪️Voting, assisting voter, serving poll watcher actively administering election (though face covering strongly encouraged)

▪️Actively providing obtaining access religious worship (though face covering strongly encouraged) cool hope die be, city they're actual uniformed metro police officers Canada Day here, provinces reporting today. 

It'll still sit hundreds daily, active counts slowly dropping nice see. Lyme disease? identities tied beliefs. Changing would require admitting investment world believe wasted. So: still douchebag then.   60% time works every time hearing since memorial day. July. Two weeks? mean, we're talking hypotheticals, evil witches place curses people reason, right? ... That's they're evil? Beast deserve get turned monster? Aurora deserve put sleep? Lol

A curse mean deserved it. Yeah, people happy, saw sign outside someone's house reading ""Honk Wolf coward"", really pissed off

Btw Wolf governor PA

Uneducated dunces lead many many deaths can't think 10 minuted spread misinformation? get kick it? One picture. worn mask one time total eyes press. specifically took mask speak press told so. new cases U.S. someone ahd previously recovered? Exactly. Everyone wants act like COVID-19 problem existence want ignore consequences lock brings. double negative Really sorry mom. :( Hugs mom stranger. lived though New York insane they'd allow door dining Smart decision. places got cocky started teasing restrictions never enacted begin paying price now. Asian countries used Masks great effectiveness. Masks proved stop virus spreading. turn, saving lives. Yo dumbass considers human rights violation? Grow up. wanna talk human rights, look China lmao. got concentration camps silence/kills everyone opposes them. mandatory masks human rights violation. pants, shirts, underwear, socks hats Euro boy. Get outta here. make sense. Don’t say “Thats sad” shit us Americans rights anyways. opinion literally doesn’t matter. nothing right. inevitability point. Infection rates going down, death rates also went down. opposite happening since death rates lagging indicator, 2 weeks now, expect also spiking. fucking sad many people dying deaths could've prevented... would probably tell mgr removed lol  Yeah they're planning finish end summer season, they're already 3 tell poor people hurt more. vehicle? 

The Taco Bell go even letting door person take out. busking money wanted $1 item, well bad ya poor person, better go rent car something pull through. Welcome 2020 Olympics mean, line thinking around virus has, have, evolved. New York put shelter place order effect March 22nd, subsequent days Governor Cuomo operating assumption 20% cases would need hospitals (an apex 140,000 needed beds apex hit around Easter). actual apex around 19,000 beds, one seventh that, would correspond hospitalization rate doctor claiming. right, better go uncovered expose people germs idea come contact virus carrier
uh huh

3 states made crime wear mask public, jumping bandwagon...get times, get damn clue, GTFO

idiot, go hang MAGA buddies infect 10% increase yesterday. 

We fucked. Well hospitalizations ICUs up.... Deaths lag those...

USA still god awful though, even finding cases testing, essentially admitting pandemic barely control still. Canada EU increased testing well, guess what? Lower cases, NEAR old peak April... Hardly even bump since re-openings. testing.

So yeah, find cases testing, well, case counts still go down.. Like, finding higher % cases testing, cases dropping dramatically country well, number daily found cases still drop. USA finding higher % number cases now, bad thing number cases obviously falling.. Yes, are. went RiteAid 5 people besides myself. one wearing mask, besides checkout person wore nose. unconcerned looked like I'm moon. yup, im quarantining well. riskiest part imo people eat plane remove masks service cart eat/drink. indoor dining much smaller space , seems indoor dining causing many new cases.  ""bit prairie dog""
Check Monty Python, substitute bunny prairie dog. Please take moment readjust mask :-) millions people protesting without social distancing wearing masks. question folks front lines pandemic: Today, someone tests positive COVID-19, prescribed treatment? 

Back early March, got test coming poorly-timed fever dry cough. staff testing site basically told “look, know test comes back positive, immune system pretty much fight this.” 

Are things different today? test positive, actually treatments start - even require hospitalization? told we're going win much, going sick tired winning. guess believe it, right! like bubble entire northeast? Us northeasterners stayed inside good 3 months, rest country going turn hard work nothing. also clear link millions people protesting past weeks sudden jump number cases. Spoiler alert: Mexico tests flipping coin. First link support argument, sudden onset severe symptoms.

Second link medical study there's proof damage shown CAT scans caused covid19.

I can't bothered continue picking rest apart find actual scientific study concludes trying say I'll happily read it. fan spamming dubious articles random sources try overwhelm someone discussion. whole 30% vs 150% countries? news, Captain Obvious died suddenly toilet today unexpected heart failure. It’s HIPAA. Two As.

It’s also dumb fucking law. lot misinformation spread Russian/Chinese bots facebook masks unhealthy dangers CO2, many fuckwits fall shit hook line sinker validates belief whole covid thing overblown. Fucking imbeciles. especially liked bit insurance companys finding costs paying tests expensive.  Lol. BBC, put like that. Keep mind overwhelmingly dominant strain, since March, we're predicament we're in. new. Stories mutation crop time time people forget think new development.  Completely wrong. **not** happen  It’s glass shortage also shortage facilities manufacture products ultra-sterile environment. Check great Science Vs podcast stuff here: recommend! It’s short sweet paints realistic picture come (that is, vaccine isn’t likely time next year even stars align). Gene pool removal system stopped driving Lyft. Also, richer client, likely wear mask. much experience health insurers, eh? Exactly, that’s meant. isn’t smart, know child would feel sad isolated way. 2000/MONTH UBI EVERYONE! never do, people demonstrating friends relatives police comment reminds meme: ""People wonder millennials messed up"" ""I know . . . watched 3,000 people die live TV teenager things never really got better.""

Or something effect. next level.  r/confusedboners No, time alarmed months ago. I'm quite sure time now, alarmed ages ago. Honduras 43% today ~40% avg past week, we’re trailing deaths knows long.

10 million people highest budget COVID-19 Central America FAR. Yet highest testing today 1700. Public hospitals max capacity month.

Guaranteed Honduras Guatemala worst Central America. States it, gets swept rug depicted act incompetence, China supposedly zero empirical circumstantial evidence prove it, written ""cover-up"" EVIL CCP GOVERNMENT?

Hmm. likely whatever circumstantial number fudging 10x worse intentional countries. ^(DJT) Ah looks like black blue still stock. Must looked that. Thanks lots turbulence pacific ocean read article, let guess:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Stupid Politicians
2. Stupid 'but muh rights' citizens
3. overall denial

how do? Right balls confirm. Wife elementary education gets hit cold flu-like symptoms multiple times year. Kids wash hands cover faces coughing sneezing. Parents often send kids school knowing sick go work. Parents even tell kids tell anybody go nurse. Schools petri dish kinds diseases COVID different. nothing centrist FML ""I got maaasssks cookin' microwave....."" There's going many headlines coming weeks. call see it. I'm American even I'm amazed amount stupidity, denials, entitlement people have. That's around amount people hometown, scary Yeah seems like people realizing time New York went effectively strict lockdown US ever done thing cases still Rose 3 weeks stayed steady couple weeks whatever situation guaranteed get worse least 5 weeks Cool. Cool cool cool. State learned family friends Juan Garcia, 21-year-old College Earth Mineral Sciences student Allentown, died June 30 respiratory failure COVID-19.

Rest peace. talking point old. Thank millions refuse wear masks states opened way soon. told live life normally still take precautions?  tired. think he'd realize ridiculous looks. Also, guess MADE cars need repair. Exactly: Mechanics engineers! 

Also, bastards chipping cars GPS! realize that. hoping someone knew was. Overall. many people infected many recovered. I'm going go grain here. could benefit this. young kids early 20's risks developing issues due covid 19 extremely low. time it, need careful go, wearing mask, visit, etc. 

If go one parties get it. get virus, isolate two-three weeks, done it. know doctors contimplated something similar. get virus done it. way treat patients without worry virus passed them. However decided it. 

Now said. might stupid kids playing stupid games taking account. agree. outside good. Deep South, summer spend time inside due extreme heat. No. 


Sorry, no. 

America shown long ago America “They want spikes, give spikes!” 2020 suck thats is....weve trained ironic Okay sure, what's excuse here?

Any healthcare system capacity, state private, need triage. Private hospitals try operate ICUs high occupancy maximize profits, should, patricularly fragile meaningful surges hospital system. Twitter typing platform.

Press conferences vocal platform (rallies).

And Fox Television platform (and seems think what’s going world TV show).

He always used noticed (even though don’t watch much) Fox starting difficulty showing off. reason forced wear clothes scream fire crowded theater. public health. ""my body, choice"". interfering bodily autonomy. risk person. asked wear cloth face public, donate organ. 

Pregnancy medical condition kill maim. extremely traumatic lead lasting health problems(I speak experience, here.). Forcing wear mask, level almost dying pregnancy, birth post partum. 

One asymptomatic person also infect 30 people. even survive lung, heart kidney damage. worst New York, talking temporary graves mass graves. brought refrigeration units bodies got full. people still normal illnesses needed emergency care. others wearing mask public health hazard make system collapse. happens space bodies. answer pile floor like Brooklyn. happens ICU beds? black tag everyone gets ventilator start deciding let weaker die like Italy.

A woman abortion medical choice. wearing mask lead society halting people dying droves. cloth cover nose mouth medical choice. difference Old white folks Worst record thus far. surprised break record tomorrow. Sure, people actually wear right Thank you! videos like one hospital Guatemala week important.   Usa #1, maga forever curious. many people actually personally know someone died world starvation. personally know anyone even food. live Amsterdam, everyone eating starvation all. Everyone fine. clearly 'world starvation'. stats Feeding America say 1 9 Americans struggling hunger. get stopped food charities? still food pantries US no-one starving? know kids already born pandemic happened, right? 
And..... many many kids unplanned.
 
But go talk dicks seem sex without evajuating cause that's kid comes from. I’ve got kid home job. impossible. It’s harder job article exaggerating. 

Set schedules child importantly teach solve problems

Parents know struggling helping kids figure solve problems own. It’s crucial time constrained learn use resources can’t help them. good analogy New here? Brazil still testing, really, REALLY slow compared rest world. deaths hospitalizations peaked 2 months ago. median age death Sweden 86. Sweden kept society schools open.

If Oxford vaccine fails succeed within next 2 months appears likely cool weather result covid resurgence. 

In case Sweden nust operate normally Denmark either go indefinite lockdown vaccine arrives winter ends embrace Swedens strategy meaning previous lockdown failure.


Denmark live hope. Sweden done it. Lol “We right” provides argument. child Internet? Adults know actually present argument Alrighty. Miami, internet stranger, strongly recommend avoid indoor dining bars make sure get outside mental health :). reduce death rate significantly. rely extra P confirm someone know they're talking trot HIPAA excuse wear mask. ADA usually soon follow (which also applicable). get millions refusing wear masks states reopening way sooner safe. fixed you.  large chunk beaches require badge issued local municipality; badge beach. State park beaches rigidly enforced limits patrolled state park police enforcing rules. many public beaches, like Point Pleasant example, sections cordoned enforce social distancing. beaches pretty well prepared. boardwalks different matter. Well typical virus denying, hoax loving, conspiracy theorist probably mouth breather too. Maybe reduce oxygen intake. Lol say thing “re-opening” may get corona ice Temperature taking pretty much useless. 70% covid patients show fever, showing fever, comes goes throughout day, mostly coming night. Well wary articles use ratios w/o numbers.

Grew 5 fold doesn’t mean much 2 cases prior. Easier grow five fold starting point low curious omitted numbers.

And article says 8 children 10 hospitalized zero deaths. children aren’t immune (which one ever said were) certainly fair far better everyone else. 

If responded like kids would still enjoying normal life. danger kids spreading parents grand parents w/o much sniffle symptom. reference them. would Mr. Cube Mr. T.......wait.... Sort like NYC Cuomo said, closed travel 12/31. People would probably taken seriously long, could definitely stopped spread/allowed tracing. AKA, retarded. Well said, feelings also. Dr. Sarno, Mindbody Syndrome, psychosomatic symptoms etc... huge field given nearly enough credit. exact attitude would existed before, like ""this flu, need go hospital"", think would make difference Neat idea, would absolutely double book empty seats. Months Maybe want wait rushed vaccine live rest life fear, like bug chasers. am. love baseball. Everything old man brand play AA AAA MLB. 

But even attempt play conditions asinine. Greed dreadful. Greed kills. knew would happen protests. running every country trying think one SM! Putting employees harm's way good business practice? Jezz people know admire good trais someone without worshipping like Gods. everyone knows become billionaire exploiting people. Postmodern cults... sort state [CDC Tennessee 2,302 pneumonia deaths date.

That averages 1629 four years. Given we're exact halfway point 2020, Tennessee looking around 815 pneumonia + flu deaths. 2,302 deaths far year, that's increase 183%. significant increase well short 600%. slightly misleading: Customers [already wear masks indoor businesses, passengers public transportation, etc. expansion order areas, including outdoor spaces people around others. !Remind 2 weeks edited cause got removed — it’s heartbreaking, really. boyfriend wear masks everywhere. he’s die hard r*p*bli*an, it’s interesting see it’s even party thing, “how selfish you” kind thing. wild.

Sadly, happened long time ago. Better test people symptoms. live Paulding, here, almost one wears mask social distancing non existent.  get haircut restaurant bar? Maybe try sometime.

There's nothing article barbershops hair salons. Exhibit A: Los Angeles, CA last Yeah inactivated vaccine traditionally pose small risk immune compromised.

Which mRNA viral vector vaccines ""safer"". 

The traditional vaccine likely trigger proper immune response though. definition symbiotic organisms benefit? Pretty sure covid-19 hella parasitic? Scientists University Calgary Canada say novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) may circulating amongst humans since least 2013, though variant responsible COVID-19 pandemic showed late 2019. Since virus new humans, lot speculation came scientists studying viral genome find it, suggested virus jumped animal humans. also theories made lab even though studies point towards origin natural man-made. Last month, World Health Assembly passed resolution look origins group scientists University Calgary, Canada, say COVID-19 causing virus (SARS-CoV-2) may circulating amongst human population since least 2013, though variant responsible current findings study currently available preprint server Biorxiv study hasn’t peer-reviewed Sure. friends legal field. complain endlessly it.

One public defender. may may know, means represents lot severely mentally ill people severely addicted people. Getting easy access records could make meaningful help client’s defenses mentally ill people aren’t known willingness help attorneys sign RoIs. addicted people aren’t known follow through. 

She cannot even call in-patient treatment provider get told client there. Unless sign RoI. signed correctly. 

There also absurdity severely mentally ill people signing legal documents like RoIs. 

That’s one example. all, experience experience people know HIPAA tries good thing, tends actually hinder people trying good. People like deserve shamed one way another. Sure ICUs hit capacity Monday. uptick NY overseas really took beds critical patients.  también ha dicho que usar mascarillas es ir en su contra?

No creo que si, solo tienen actitudes que lo es que le pasa por la cabeza esa gente?

Nada. Eso es la problema. America third world country. making happen test kit shortage. Right que! Beautiful, isn’t it? /s need beds doctors nurses oxygen Ppe and... Kids shouldn’t wear masks. really young kids/babies it’s actually pretty dangerous, older ones find sad see must psychologically damaging extent. grown-ups it’s fine, society accept bit extra risk children’s sake (plus kids don’t seem contract spread virus much, all, anyway). Yup. Still waiting April heat kill virus. 

And waiting. 

And waiting. Good comment.  fill ICUs capacity months ago cause patients need ventilators access them. highly doubt majority teens. Teens tend find new platforms peers on. guess, majority users 25-40 ofc South San Diego going hit *hard* soon, idiots anti-maskers neighboring counties going head holiday weekend mingle 'Zonies. die, they'll ask God, ""Why protect me?""

He'll reply, ""I gave science, Dr. Fauci, face masks... want?"" $100 fine get puke car. life ruined this. one. would sacrifice health suffering death end. would whatever could make go away. state stay home / quarantine right now.

Complete denial currently may ever required again, especially state's currently surging. Angry suggestion hearing idiocy, feel free ignore.

For students pot, throwing Covid party, responsible traced contact infect others.
Terrorism knowingly spread.
Murder traced contact dies.
Assault something less severe murder person make sick complications.
Before prison, forced, longer contagious, help clean Covid patients, burial detail, tasks help treatment others without getting way teaching sadistic fucks. hope wearing masks help California towards goal reopening, even delayed reopening. really hard understand, weird bravado  demonstrate. Almost like badge honor care health fellow human.  testing time high.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Oh, commenting another person. mean you. Lol. bad. questions beginning remain unanswered. Mutation risk always there, even though vaccines designed mount neutralizing antibodies slow-mutating RBD region virus spike protein. still know long immunity lasts, whether vaccines provide reasonable immunity reasonable time. 

Vaccine safety questions still air. I'm quite positive vaccine platforms used quite safe, real safety issues arise vaccinate someone catch virus. vaccinated people mount adequate immune response upon exposure virus, detrimental reaction. ADE Th2 skewed immune responses among major concerns. far 0 data this, every vaccine developer going closely monitor also report. 

About vaccine news hear, believe developers cherry picking data reporting vague results, something keep mind. However also developers objective possible reporting should. 

The news hear Phase trials preclinical trials. far look quite promising, however limited data. Reports animal experiments major downside animals representing human immune system adequately. preliminary indication, nothing definitive. Reports human subjects concentrate humoral immune response, is, production IgG's upon vaccination. far seem quite promising well, antibodies upon vaccination guarantee protection way. 

Long story short, promising early initial data, however biggest questions hurdles still future need wait see results. hope positive news continue come. don’t treat party referring to? article referring personnel movement states. saying military personnel allowed travel to/from CA/FL/MI without higher approval. 

Within states branch. Navy, instance, limited movement sailors 50 miles base lot restrictions (no bars, bowling alleys, movie theaters, must wear masks, groups larger 10, lot more...). 

You better believe enforcing it. don’t wear mask either A. Ignorant B. Asshole C. snowflake ignorant asshole Actual title article:
 
**NY, NJ Longer Track Contain COVID, Group Says, US Breaks Daily Case Record Again** means literally nothing husband fence another kid, afford financially decided stress worry raising another child society isn’t fucking worth lol  problem flu April 2021. We’ve gas lit much, even reasonable people hard time making reasonable decisions. Yes, e.g. Russia coerced students...  see news read foreign outlets. Reddit largely American, global news tends focus America lot. vogue shit average American citizen country whole. people trotting even speaking anything resembling point authority; they're parroting something saw someone else talking without actually understanding word they're saying. 


Seeing ""HIPPA"" someone US tells exactly type person I'm dealing right gate. kind convenient, really. says US 53206 cases 27th cases I'm started going started opening slowly made sense me. shocked see US reopening similar time us cases going up. feels like second wave never really hit us west coast. now. reading bad America like ??? it’s finally getting here. Seems weird traveled east west USA isn’t it? work now? mean tell mask protects RESPIRATORY virus? way dude cannot believe this!

/s “It doesn’t give parents much confidence district make appropriate decisions safety.” Discipline. Single thing Americans lack. That's fucks fat lol offense fact. Americans take seriously end, look leadership. Murica great innovations what's rate ? compare countries? busy choosing menu fast food restaurants. man could making life death decisions 10 times day, need emotionally stable doctors think using rationality emotions. send child small in-home daycare (about 7 kids) always great charging us days use. first started asked us could continue making payments even child going (eventually go even wanted too) agreed continue make payments. take expert.

Look graph.

Can find first wave?

Can find second wave?

My son grade 1 passed test easily.

Can you? little late don’t ya think? Well, elected officials apparently part racist death cult.... Teachers parents, too. may go building 5 days week, forced put kids daycare children home unsupervised “two days” rotation. know parents think shouldn’t help online learning families juggle well. 

I see many comments need socialization parents needing work can’t stay home. educators risk well. didn’t sign healthcare heroes charge taking temperatures isolating Covid cases. 

The higher ups making decisions probably haven’t stepped foot classroom years. Many parents complaining don’t want teachers wearing masks may scare child. basically, become frontline workers without masks gear. Half time don’t even paper towels hand soap bathrooms. office floor hasn’t cleaned properly years. 

There isn’t easy solution. Sadly mate, tomorrow 10k :(((( I'm curious know believe wearing mask necessary. might remain first wave second wave huffpost.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Lol Young, healthy people die suffer severe longterm consequences, extremely low odds given infection. millions infections, obviously happens. Credible sources framed way beginning imho. Wish VA would get board this. article implying discrepancy actual hospitalization numbers vs reported ones?

Short answer, yes: answer: Apparently sometimes give ICU bed someone need ""an intensive level care,"" possibly bed/nurse availability units. suppose thinking people moved ICU really needed, they're counting them. Still seems bit shady me, I'll defer someone hospital experience discuss merits downsides method. So... expect massive death toll Texas coming months? fucking hated line ""there evidence support x"" beginning novel fucking virus.

Sweden easily attacked personally take different view.

This article interviewed Der Spiegel well worth read: http://archive.vn/KU8A2

I also horde Swedish trolls follow around engaging targeted harassment, mass downvoting, etc. really par course Swedish discourse around this, sadly. breaks heart apparently one good ones, actually quarantined wore mask social distanced, got screwed thinking people would show courtesy common sense. USA #1!!!!!!! Assholes like reverse black holes. Instead extreme gravity pulling things screwing everything vicinity, asshole emit repulsive force screws everything vicinity. 50 cases day around 2 months now?? population 50m w heavy population density, fine far fewer 800ish cases per day seeing back late Feb early March Sad thing is, probably wasn’t funeral all. Maybe Norway could get shortage stopped Swedish workers working? sure absolutely doctor wants position, torn inside start deciding gets ICU bed. girl friends mother heart failure Houston wait 3 days get ICU beds full. Doctors absolutely torn get care needed, hospital continues fill chaos ensues. nothing kindess hearts, want able help everyone possible. pushing unmanageable crisis unseen proportions. whole point shutting let hospitals get run, let happen, many states going full steam ahead hospitals already breaking point. going alot heartache country next couple months. Please use ""/s"" people think serious! Completely nonessential. 

There's reason open theme parks. Also doctors care people make less money them, statement wild. completely disagree you, it’s belief doctor doesn’t care patients doctor likely fuck something up.

I understand partial detachment, don’t support condone completely robotic behavior. mean let's hope many Swedish people suffering disease time ( [linkdump ). One hopes make 100% recovery, sadly doubtful will. 

One hopes even harder SE stops messing Test, Trace, Isolate gets act together get outbreak control threat herd disability longer present. Straight up, I'm quarentine baby. Due December right call IMO 

You admit even know detailed willing opinion man's death **the right call?** 

Jesus Christ. Thank God doctor.  President's hoax virus sure spreading quickly don’t think question kids catch spread virus, even suffer horribly it. question seem lot less adults. YMCA alone tens thousands children centers last months, recently hadn’t “clusters” transmission childcare facilities US.... meaning multiple cases traced back single case child care facility.  given numbers children involved, it’s surprising haven’t seen clusters, considering prevalent seem among adult activities. could childcare facilities bang-up job keeping kids distant wearing masks washing hands, could also less likely contract spread virus reason. agree caution called known.  saying true it’s strictly matter children leaving house - numbers suggest something different happening. next months Quarter reckoning economy. begin see much companies lost. lot money fed ending running unless financial stimulus, businesses forced close, think corporate layoffs, consumer spending (which already low) pulled back even people getting extra $600. Oh virus decided come back strong economy reopened, good. Fasten seat belts it’s gonna get wild. Thank decades worth cuts education, following bullshit like religion instead science, general distrust authority knowledge. 

Its trifecta stupid wonder hitting places like Texas Florida hardest. fair larger population Italy good margin. hospitals full.

The reason younger people dying greater numbers serious cases treated hospitals. 15% infected require hospitalization. 

If young people can't get oxygen antivirals cytokine storm drugs, they'll start dropping like flies. ofc alabama.. Ah yes.... freedom foundation dot com. #1 source medical statistics. No. retarded Tartine bakery’s books really great starter / Levain recipe. might easier get going it’s warmer (if you’re northern hemisphere.) Also, tap water chlorinated might try bottled water. (They already?) good fired? LA highest increase absolutely NOTHING this. Must bars opening Death covid pretty rare, lifelong complications aren't.

I'm sorry comment stupid af I'm shocked upvotes. I'm denial potential lasting effects virus, absolutely possible way know lifelong complications, even common, considering around less year. Come on. people fighting encourage mask wearing / social distancing largely giving pass protesters (if outright endorsing them) protesters far biggest culprits whole fiasco. 

If Bob already wanna wear mask endure people barking it, sees people people (including politicians) clapping people obviously flouting rules themselves, supposed take seriously? depressing. I'm incredibly sad... cant start reopening economy without schools. Half parents quit jobs. vast majority people forgot virus sudden states steamrolled opening up. kept saying stupid, nothing changed. virus still one way combating it, that’s staying home social distancing. moron able understand would happen stop thing keeping virus check. followers easily astroturfers. Yea literally work. Use capital earn money. Even opportunity banked on, earned enough money last next crash. sure downvoted. Maybe decades treaty failure read centuries? anything economy would tank Dear Leader may get reelected since staked entire reelection economy. Agree. think Italy's response excusable all. guys clue happening, feel sorry them.  dam expert luck blessing now?

which articles read Sweden excellent control group minor restrictions never imposed more.

Mandated policy minimum behavior =/= people actually did. Sweden’s population isolated average western country. r0 naturally lower given conditions. Right they’ve able drop r0 acceptable level, that’s thing herd immunity. fall you’ll see jump right back up.

Other Nordic countries managed lower cases negligible amount without crazy death numbers Sweden managed. Sweden facing easier task countries like US, Italy, Spain still managed drive South Korea far robust tracing program struggling contain virus even though literally dead dozens hundreds cases.

I don’t care it’s difficult, *they it.* Every western nation named Sweden US *doing* Test trace fantasy scale. 

Except everyone it?


So yea, keep praising bunch white flag waving murderers. fact you’re staring litany evidence face denying speaks 100% unreasonable are. thought 15-20 percent population recently exposed coronavirus strain helps immunity response fight earlier stage replication really takes hold. exposed strain earlier time sorta forgot coronavirus guess means close mine, article say that. article read (Herald-Sun without paywall says highest-concentration counties 25 ""new"" cases per 100,000 people. I'm even sure ""new"" means here.  alternative feeding tube situation net result takes 10 days suffering die instead 6. reasonable choice. Could [tonsil way underestimating.

A good majority keep check, oh need daily fraps, oh need bath sunlight, oh need get hair cut nails done, oh need grab one grocery stores, oh need see friends, oh cannot live anymore cannot get lil thing anymore, oh ... oh ... oh ... oh ... modern science, expect better even 1/2% killed pathogen. know takes end pandemic wont it. know. backing up! Sorry sounded like opposite :) get urge emotionally detach, frankly doctors get paid way much feel like give instinct. someone getting paid 30k year I’d totally understand approve strategy, doctors resources cope emotional trauma. bHuT mAH R!gHTz?!?!

Seriously wear fucking mask. Ppe shortage much rugby game started players walk field yeah. Boomers masters projection shucking blame. They’re also ignorant think they’re fucking invincible. I’ve seen maybe young people (left leaning city) wear masks overwhelming majority idiots would probably die caught it. Well, you’re welcome. Glad potentially protect fuck yourself. twats who’ve running around town complaining entire time too. sister law rural midwife. According her, definitely baby boom. Business already starting pick up. Remaining silent get ass charge contempt court tossed jail. Journalists lawyers face possibility routine course job...tell us source go jail contempt court. yeah, they’ll toss in. You’re considered keys cell you’re willing talk let go. 

As journalist STFU hope news organization’s lawyer filing motions get out. Private citizens wanting protect posse? much. 

(Journalism law: Branzburg v. Hayes, U.S. Supreme Court ruled “the First Amendment relieve newspaper reporter obligation citizens respond grand jury subpoena answer questions relevant criminal investigation, therefore Amendment afford constitutional testimonial privilege agreement makes conceal facts relevant grand jury's investigation crime conceal criminal conduct source evidence thereof.” questioning later ruled improper therefore voids contempt charge. cases often resolved without journalists information, they’re free go.) Roll tide see daily cases, daily cases per 100k population, daily deaths, daily deaths per 100k state here:

 gentrified areas still terrible public schools. people gentrifying either don’t kids, send private school close friend worry Deep South. know petty, unfunny insults aren’t path winning debate? mystery appreciation posts daily updates regarding Sweden. Thanks friend :) India banned medical products China?  know people manage.

I'm 6 month old, also 2 sets healthy, retired, willing grandparents (with money), blocks away. even then, sometimes go nuts. much love dump U.S., numbers compare countries measure cases per population? mean, U.S. basically size entirety Europe, seems obvious they'd cases intentionally use total cases primary mode measurement. point though agree. haven’t forgotten Bill past, I’m always bit skeptical him, can’t argue done lot good part life. awhile, money doesn’t mean lot. may well enjoy spending making difference. here! Christian live South. wear mask go many places since started. Church opened middle June. social distancing, sanitizing, temperature checks. watching home, masks came auditorium, full band played sang congregation also sang. attending except virtually. pray ones attending. Yeah, bro. I’ll pile here. You’re wrong. Yes, nutty people world refusing comply common sense mandates. we’re country bending backwards accommodate fucking morons. mask mandate here. centralized action all, really. countries ignorant, selfish assholes. turned ideology, let run show. read article looks like dinner, headline make sound went rave even need directly face. Indoor air currents shown infect others quite long distances. crazy.

I got fired mentioning boss. rude, simply expressed concern. economics. one wants hear information, would make people less likely go consume. Less likely want put risk work. Less likely ok sending kids back school work. 5 plants Quarantine. 27. 4 way mail. multiple different coronaviruses. 

About 15% common colds coronaviruses (the rest rhinoviruses). 

Some antibody tests show positive antibodies coronaviruses, particular one. Kids general arnt high risk compared flu. Big risk bringing home someone is. Little kids always major vector Uh, people think entire world making cases deaths? Texas, places, pretending hospitals running capacity? again, 98% working climate scientists worldwide making climate change reason, sure- COVID’s totally made up, too. not? sure go fool conservatives, tell you. Thank god got there. depressing looking facebook seeing family buy shit though. I'm sure none protesters. /s Paywalllll casinos open?! Add LA list; schools planning opening back August well. kids grade 3 wear masks, lower grades must immune guess. doctor did. made rationale decision save someone younger/healthier/able contribute society man. sucks come this, doctor made right call triage. I've IRL seen people expose risk corona order eat crappy kebab read folder supermarket. :)

A lot people like children, sense able pause internal calculation. 

Like Pro: get see Ice Ice baby Live con: get deadly disease. OK lemme pause moment compare pro con head!

They go ""Oh Ice Ice Baby, that's cool, lemme go."" Nothing else happens heads.

I think manage avoid risk root learned rules repetition, therefore need stick routine life routines serve them. Kinda like programmed rules.

If changes, learned habits serve anymore, since can't think, they'll blunder around. 

So get strange priorities, like risiking get deadly disease order get low valuable things.

Children also stuff like that. Like risk getting run car order go look shop window. I’ve always thought Speed limits recommendation. r/whoosh comparison Sweden regarding Corona like comparison North-Korea regarding human rights. better means literally fuck-all.

You're wrong, though. Summer camp trans person, scares shit someone might decide quality life simply I'm trans, deny care. Absurd? Yeah, totally, trans people already murdered alarming rates, what's stop someone using excuse make state sanctioned amid chaos? Trader Joe’s near kicks :) uber eats takeout huge hit em

Most restaurants dying delivery services. overhead killing little margin had. Need footnotes comment good thing. lots cases asymptomatic, probably less. IT: actual correct answer must Indian. got told ""phrases like shut mask logical fallacies used Satan followers"" WWE staff major breakout afflicted Florida. People wearing masks week tapings, isolation. Honestly. whole opinion south people south taken huge turn worse. sometimes hard like ""You know what. Fuck you. get deserve get virus."" I’m pregnant went OB appointment today, Dr told spike happens would bunker like supposed slowing curve, recommended people aren’t house hold next weeks. technically I’m pregnant I’m immune compromised take bit serious- hope helps! Idk think European. confused stunned angry fuck em sad. 
Please get shit together. It’s joke. Tell hundreds thousands protestors. yeah doesnt know shit shit Exponential growth?  
I to, I've leaving now. 

More cases close people make real sure. game plan whole time. know happens people think special exceptional, exempt laws physics? History repeats. first wave, second wave, 1918 pandemic named after. Can't wait see excited pay government suddenly Nice synopsis doesn’t account tourists take home, get tested, show positive home regions. 

*Glaring in-laws intensifies* Teacher here. Quitting definitely last resort, option. buildings open people exposed forced quarantine, absolutely run teachers. couldn’t get subs pre-covid, let alone now. People keep saying “the kids fine!” somebody classrooms them. live Canton, Ohio (about hour south Cleveland), people ages aren’t wearing mask. I’d say 25% people actually wear masks (and half don’t even wear right). even went chipotle today cashier wasn’t even wearing mask! can't see comment article criteria certain patients got HCQ hospital.

Maybe date became part local protocol mentioned either.

This would important, comparing group early pandemic later group. group gets benefit experience disease, treatments tweaked, patients might come earlier slightly less sick better recognition, etc etc. lot happen given HCQ too. I’m pleased governor’s response. CDC good job tracking data medication HIV taken backseat health education. pill reduce transmission increase unprotected gay sex ends retarding effect medication situation people living increases chances transmission per person homosexuals unprotected sex. Trying point though makes people offended truly believe issue. 

[source Yep-thanks dumbshit oval office ignores science, due pea sized brain. pos lack leadership health pandemic 100% responsible shape in. Fuck Trump GOP enables deplorable behavior. Sadly, one listens kinds stories. :-( interesting article

 

Keep mind Italy A/C actually used regardless (because ridicolous energy costs) people asymptomatic

This true. studies I've seen indicate around 20-40% higher end people may asymptomatic. pseudo effective sentence? sucks us northeast US, hard lockdown two months, hard Europe pretty much one going except essential activity. worked cautiously returning except worry rest nation, things seem track get exponentially worse, worse us. torn berating stupid crying what's coming them. way things going get back normal anytime year. Respirators people can't breathe pneumonia, since way shape form similar flu.

Even flu, spanish flu killed plague history. seasonal flu.

Hundreds thousands millions deaths acceptable avoid it.

Also talk immunity even sure point immunity built time, since virus 8 months old best. learnt recently built months cases, know more. Exactly. early may antibody study found 20% prevalence antibodies.

Except study poorly constructed sample set done anti body test high false positive rate. Something called countless times. way NY 1.6 million Covid-19 cases back then. Back would accounted lot death NY actually had. actual positive test numbers NY around time afterwards back high infection large people got care spread controlled less 2 months people government adapted.

Yeah... current resurgance happen. politicians absolute shit there. NY went lockdown ICU bed capacity around 50%, barely scraped by. states report 75% capacity occupied seems like much done. managed contain hotspots (like NY), way spread before, current numbers, get lot worse another 2-3 month. Death rates might lower now, awesome. current trend, ICU's run full, death rates back What’s going Arizona Texas Florida nothing like this. able much better. governments already reacting, people react they’re sufficiently scared like New Yorkers were.

Its already late again. Every meassure taken 2-3 weeks late. AGAIN. None politicians learned jack shit. guys could really good place nation wide now, instead worsening, another long time. Look countries, Italy, Spain, hotspots beginnging. numbers promising now. numbers promising too, back horrifying. WTF wrong guys.

Shit, guys toying around mask politics cost whole world eventually. Sure reopen soon enough start international trade stuff soon enough, since guys cant issue nation wide mask law nation bit intelligence allow trade travel virus still spreads like crazy. believe not, still important part world trade community tear whole world shit show. Dang get angry thinking it.

Really western nations got shit control less. guys made covid political issue ... lemme tell this, business tank even hold nation wide lockdown long enough get control. [It's Touché. people don’t wear masks UK (&lt;20%) still working ok  Wait month. countries get spike also. Unless mean like dictatorships ability control masses. We're* I'm glad longer given weird looks say ""Our government complete ass point hurts physically think it"".

At least we're page. geographical data coincide cities hosting BLM protests? neither would sacrifice opened fucking schools again, actual message article sub dense understand finds opposite conclusion title post. Bermuda. enough tests hand test everyone three times. isn’t shortage tests; shortage people willing pay tests. first question ask, whether know they're endangering others, know moral compass society beyond fucked. punctuation, apparently. 

Denialism problem wether know not. announced asymptomatic transmission ""very rare"" three weeks ago. backtracked lot backlash, guy may attended around exact time live Southern Virginia, bartender. Younger people consistently wearing masks often work older people. younger people actually covering noses, opposed older people wearing masks nose. first weeks phase two, many people wearing all. cases rise again, I'd say closer 50% wearing them. kinda crazy realize people either a: really dumb, b: lack regard everyone else. 
I'm tired. I’ve hearing reddit months. Let’s stay shut forever What's like there? Anyone paying attention already knows this. USA! USA!! USA!! #1!! think it’s state peak wave, look graphs, would make sense. states going peak kind, hopefully isn’t bad comes somewhat fast, like NY/NJ. hopefully peak, isn’t second wave. Lying assumes malicious intentions. makes assume statements made express intention hurt billions people?

Lying also assumes consensus within international community researches experts efficacy wearing masks time. consensus wilfully ignored obtuse group got appear media agreed tell different story. Would global conspiracy remotely plausible? Think it.

Remember Occam's Razor. things equal, theory fewest assumptions usually plausible theory. case: simply scientific consensus time led fray contradictory statements time crisis. Many disparate studies yielding different results conducted range differing circumstances space weeks: cloth masks vs surgical masks, outdoors indoors, parties grocery stores, using videography large computing simulations,... this, studies handful researchers active rather small field.

What article reports got around conducting large scale study seem support several theories floating scientific community; beyond community. new evidence? Well, set new data points paints bigger picture bit accurate, nobody really clue final picture actually look like. Moreover, literally took long compile large enough dataset come founded interpretation data.

The essence scientific method allows making mistakes learning cross referencing findings different observations. debate agreeing upon new version bigger picture might bit clear previous version. good science takes time effort. something rush. 

This pandemic 3 months, let alone 6 months, old. So, yes, given circumstances, think rather unreasonable state experts outright intentional lying. Especially experts suddenly rushed front camera expected give definite answers short notice none. That's literally works.

Down road, there's zero point holding grudge science experts. would alternative anyway? Mistakes made again, corrected later. matter time. essence science refrain holding grudge open mind; that's science progresses.

If want angry, angry politicians enforce stay-at-home orders extended periods time, unwilling make provisions keep population safe, stubbornly ignoring importance science, social security, public healthcare first place. Fuckin hell...I may part generation, would NEVER anything stupid. I'm sorry, hurricane summer end political issue. Someone administration give differing info NOAA evacuates along party lines. hope get one all. understand virus mandatory reporting.

It's like someone Hepatitis HIV sex everyone telling infected.

Shit like criminal. cruelty evil mean. That’s true. They’re getting better treating requires room. sympathy idiot.  would high risk groups infected earlier? surely possible demonstrate higher % vulnerable people infected? ""thoughtcrime"" arguing actual experts speculating baselessly, contrarianism. feel like closest thing reliable numbers looking excess deaths covid-related symptoms. fake 10,000 people getting sick, can't really fake 10,000 dead bodies. IIRC, executive order Gov. Abbot specifically states supersedes local orders - local governments impose fines disobeying recommendations made. 

So, city government Texas literally CANNOT make strict requirements - fine anyone following them. quite simply best do. important note, tests antibodies. one particular test. cost? 

A cost rich captains industry willing pay. Another millenial here.

Haven't left house much since March. fishing trips son, pick-up orders grocery store, that's it. Good luck that. virginia enforcement. Texas make cut? manage. pull together patchwork vacation time, summer camps (although many camps half-days end 3pm, still hard working parents), family help. It’s great, it’s do-able Covid times. pray away jesus saves True, however talking people party would surely incriminate confirming party. Anything relation party, setup, invitations could incriminate people planning (depending laws). take away criminal punishment yes, could compel witness talk. I've seen major US media outlets, they're covering coronavirus focusing stories like people refusing wear masks / politicians making statements issue. There's lot less attention given fact 50K cases day. like media covering issue like political debate (""here's sides arguing"", rather ""here's statistical growth means public health perspective"")

The media done inform people there's controversy public health measures (e.g., masks, lockdowns), rather inform people much danger USA in. Hopefully that's better way explaining frustration media? ...and covid infection parties. I'm boat, flew home state 3/14 LAX ghost town. plane ~20-30% full almost everyone mask on. WFH since. Stay safe there! Fourth, nowhere else put money. People randomly investing looking maybe finding second third shift job. Schools looking 2 days school three days virtual home. three days kids still supposed learning find daycare type situation may get lessons day. kids definitely want spend nights cramming schoolwork. Good know. Thanks! Time stop elective surgeries again. Grandma's hip replacement wait. pre-covid economy could kids lied daycare centers professional run abusive, neglectful adults. Ok even care point? Yeah... doctor knows secrets COVID travel around without caution cancer patient. probably share secrets world. Ummm expensive? $200 good price test. lot holocaust survivors carried PTSD around day died, I'm afraid lot kids well. Friend mines grandfather tested positive Monday, got admitted hospital Tuesday, ICU Wednesday ventilator morning. It’s scary fast progress.

Let's call politicizing pandemic. like ""herd thinning"" Find numbers drawing big conclusion insinuation ONE article. Wow 900 beds? That’s great. last 1-2 days. read headline, imagined group people sitting together table head. That's party me, like birthday, graduation anniversary party. go raves though. think ""parties"". Unless there's huge social program war fight idk really sucks. absolutely go get tested now. 🖤 👤 matter someone moving Michigan today...... FUCK That's pretty good price testing. quits qualify unemployment, let go does? folks. 

No leadership top. Biggest issue. 

Second issue, people leading instead trying create movement discourages mask wearing social distancing. 

Third problem, apologists pretend unbiased trying subtly defend said poor leaders. Better getting ""herd disaiblity"" considering experts think [1 3 COVID survivors could face long term harm 

Yeah, sounds GREAT economy health human safety it? Real great. I'd like see go courts, honestly. Compelling someone provide list people contact forcing admit were, fact, attendance illegal party. long gathering crime, would think burden proof state compel people participate contact tracing. Less people catch colds/flu’s trigger underlying issues summer winter. damn right. Ketchup worst. I'm going anywhere. deal likes while.

Unlike mouthbreathers take virus seriously, value information medical professionals scientists.

Another fucknut see.

Hatred? Division? seeing hatred division problem KKK terrorist group. Fuck bullshit. vast majority people test positive tested hard say, probably well 90% month. dead hospital recovered. needs professional internet nuts unskew numbers medical authorities themselves? already eased lockdown month, almost everything running usual live state seeing average 600 cases per day 400 recoveries. People site obviously ever dealt someone position (alive, little quality life), think anything normal situation illness. 

Honestly, would point Intubating patient? also sounds like wife agreement intubated. decision made treatment, correct course treatment hospice. Nothing treatment hospice abnormal. Patients given palliative care only. patient doesn’t want can’t eat, don’t. aren’t going place feeding tube hospice patient. missing something? else get herd immunity? 

Without vaccine, need people get infected recover. immune systems retain memory virus respond exposed again. Every time, that's one down. get upwards 70% population, R0 goes less 1 virus starts die old fashioned way. Switzerland following monday mandatory wear facemasks public transport. you, built ladder heaven. Forget details, reclassified bunch undetermined deaths COVID. Actual dates spread out.

That’s NJ least. It’s insane states taking long this. knowledge county Tennessee county mandate yet good majority people don’t follow it. Wrong. wrong lie. lot total fabrications.

First have, sheer stupidity, made resounding defense Sweden without even realizing it. said Sweden got virus control without hard restrictions keeping schools society open. Lol amazing.

But wrong. Since April Sweden shown strong increase movement. masks. Retail shopping far baseline. Even less less social distancing virus died same. bounce. over. reached enough immunity died off. Slowly steadily none less.

Also nobody test trace Europe meaningful way. even trying pathetic. worked work. test trace sure fantasy exist Reddit hivemind only. Rescheduled mean cancelled Lol this. states MONTHS get ahead thing response entire time ""well, NYC problem innit, happen us!"" Clearly Dallas businesses signs saying masks required enter end making masks part presidential elections process??

Because country run adult maturity 1st grader entire political party walking lock step oblivion. deaths still count coronavirus related deaths counted towards total COVID-19 deaths. Damn straight. Time man up. Ah witness moral bankruptcy US. two kids age three. wife full time jobs. ability work home since middle March. daycare closed middle March weeks ago. flexible companies help in-laws, idea wife would gotten pandemic point. thing is, left leaning site like reddit long held groupthink opinion need stop sending people jail non-violent crimes. sense irony hypocrisy folks cheerleading unconstitutional overreach justice system begging harsh draconian measures That’s sad man wore masks took seriously went one time died it.

Penalty might die kill someone. seems like worst possible scenario. can't work they're school half time aren't. fraction businesses closed shutdown re-opened, even though good evidence suggest we’re headed another shutdown. Stocks head 5% suppose. Lol keep head up, (for part) together.  would say ""Oh shit nope time yet"" wave.

We finally got shit wraps started dip toes back water realized dangerous eels still live lol. 

For real though. worry going happen. hoping shit would good now. :(  mention triage article. doctor simply considered better dead. say booze isn’t drug... judging, saying. Oh it’s part issue. saying biggest issue politicians feeding loop. It’s tribalism. shifts blame people electing officials puts next election. “We better vote!”......well always vote. issue isn’t who’s elected, they’re merely representative voting electorate (at least 47-48% it). problem tens millions people thought person qualified. vitamin Maybe early stages pandemic, everyone know better. Oh, God. Incredible. Everyone read this. reads like extremely one-sided story. me, truth sounds like end-of-life situation chose prolong dying death inevitable. right call IMO. man 21 year old car suits fine. Easy cheap fix too. “It go away” here, considering 2nd, wife's age income uncertainty, make sense. luckily work home things get worse, wife cannot. also ran numbers health insurance event lost due job loss cannot consciously bring another child world level uncertainty.

Wearing mask

^^^A ^^^^bit... ^^^^^please seem like thought whole thing, think masks absurd? 2 cant wear mask fucks wont wear mask killing babies toddlers. 1 year old daughter concerned me. think it’s bad now, they’ll hell 3-4 weeks. Critically sick patients tend need start needing serious care 3+weeks infection People like think dangerous truly is.
 
Most Americans never faced anything dangerous random drunk driver road (minorities running cops exception). None us ever seen war soil, relegated concept 'bad things' file 'things happen people somewhere else'.
 
So faced truly terrible reality, brains developed ability process it. literally can't imagine world arguing who's going win whatever hybrid dancing singing celebrities island trying marry someone nothing coconuts wear eat interesting thing lives. brains never prepared face discomfort.
 
So one option - refuse accept new reality, continue act like happening. Yeah give two weeks Case Fatality Rate (CFR) ratio between
confirmed deaths confirmed cases.

The CFR around 5% US. seemingly exponential growth rate, unreasonable exercise assume entire population Florida exposed, contract virus. don’t. absurd. like people thought offensive call Chinese virus wuhan virus absurd. Nobody racist middle easterners virus coming there. would racist Chinese one named place came from? HIV transmitted asympomatically. Often years, days. entire generation gay men dead it. worthless? No. step professionally mistake? yes 7 day moving average cases actually decreasing beginning June. 10th started increase again. like progress made thrown away. God hope immune system doesn’t share cells brain I’m deep shit. Lmao Thanks! Congrats Florida 🎉👏🎉 Unless see corresponding increase deaths, evidence less dangerous told. ""Nothing see here,"" indeed. No, fucking morons squandered us ignoring requests stay home, wear mask public etc.

Now we’re fucked. while. longer nothing, like awesome state Florida, ‘leader’ can’t find way (despite privileged education) paper bag. Nope  labeled 'treason' certain Patriots country.

Deplorable. says 80% asymptomatic mild, making shit now. Again, one quick Google away. like line Guardians Galaxy: (paraphrased) ""We might a-holes we're not, quote, 100% complete dicks."" Absolutely. It’s unfortunate, there’s denying may well worst amongst developed countries. worst response Smoking choice, that's difference. Also big tobacco lobbies shit congress outright ban smoking. Money lives......see theme?

Current rate survival 99.7% 95.2%. 39 deaths every 100,000 people moment.

Indeed, states Northeast US want reopen dine-in exact reason. could find whether recommendation direct ban, Italians could maybe clarify. Thanks advance! \- ""You're always negative. Can't optimistic positive.""

\- ""Senator, I'm idiot."" anything, virus hastening everything modernity. one thing, primarily kills old people. another, enforcing home deliveries, social isolation communication via screens devices, shutdown things true human socialization, shared eating musical experiences. things enhanced human life past now. gradually extinguished technology, virus pushing extinction along. Primary sources get page views work.

That's works... 
That's works. disaster I’m US. Please correct wrong. Didn’t Florida see month back people beach droves Florida reopened push back lock Every place bad areas. Texas absolutely beautiful. hill country plains national treasure. Great food well. good bad people everywhere go. Everyone thought “essential.”
Roads packed morons going out. one *got* day many *still* don’t *get* coworker call work wife hes feeling sick past week. wear mask work another part building place getting sanitized today amount people masks wearing chin crazy. Congrats Florida!! good idea? Nothing entire comment chain anything exponential growth. Nothing fact April shorter January anything exponential growth (and February too). 

Or think something relevant, quote please.

Now made five angry comments, called dumbass, idiot, dumb fuck, told delete account. feel like maybe anger getting better you. Seems like maybe one gone rails? Maybe try stepping away computer breather? 4 days ago, everyone moved on. voted right wrong, won. Congrats. 

I actually going read comments, reddit fcuked. Using stereotyped verbal comunication, corroborating self illusion sounding cool hide lack arguments. [He’s like South American Florida man That's exactly it.

New Zealand - coronavirus all. way going stay way (until vaccineland) strict quarantine. quarantine place state.

I even know possible strict state quarantine US. state, Oregon, went total quarantine - nobody unless successfully isolate 2 weeks - well, would totally destroy commerce Washington California. semi-quarantine might possible. Keep freeways completely open, Oregon plate, allowed exit freeway emergencies essentials like gas.

But point is, eradicate coronavirus given region, gonna come back unless region quarantined. What's N.W.A. song again? doesn’t seem like right time complain downvotes. Loool America ""health care"" triage based many digits bank. couple weeks ago calling people doomers saying numbers good even opening. 

They seem long attention span Never. Meet. Your. Heroes. mayors generally Board Health? experts in.... health Board Health. You’re right! Time slow testing. That's good, Texas chance turn around. Still hope Arizona Florida. Florida United States United States thos guy? Get rid Sounds like need stop testing!  have, are. 

All current cases quarantine detected there.  
New Zealand moved Alert Level 1 (Lowest) 11:59pm Monday 8 June. Wow Shhhh... lots people offended reality. punishments like enforced disproportionately minorities multiple warnings whites. Yes - active antibodies reduce time, leaving memory-cell type antibody (I'm epidemiologist, I'm sure term us incorrect) generate antibodies quickly event re-infection. got impression tapering covid matches coronaviruses retain long term immunity. 

The asymptomatic study suggested know whether memory cells persist, least asymptomatic individuals, commercial test them. see research suggested formed different patient group;may vaccine related. (I good friend one cousin epidemiology, plus another head gerontology practice shitting bricks sideways lack response) . Every state country enforcing quarantines anyone returns FL. going interesting see many ""law &amp; order"" people willingly break mandate b/c ""freedom"". It’s immediate concern according article wear damn mask people. don’t it’s going really bad. Hi Mod.

I hold PhD biomed engineering, chapter dissertation similar positive stranded RNA virus... think said fact based?  Yeah assume talking America? I'm Sweden death rates bad (because lot elder care facilities hit early, something like 95% deaths 70+), ICU admissions deaths steadily declining since april without lockdowns.  


People bit careful. survive? find interesting death rate places. seems lower expected. maybe soon tell. every medal civilian honor country give him. VOTE explain early hotspots wealthy areas then? reckless idiot isn’t linked socioeconomic status assuming otherwise condescending. It’s almost word exponential hard people grasp. even 50% lock limited compliance.

My state &lt;3% positive rate 30K tests/day. came 3 months strict lock down.

Finally starting ease....gyms open restrictions, outdoor dining, sort thing. 

Anyway, stopped gas station afternoon....masked per state mandate, walks ""Covid Ken"" attitude. Telling clerk none business time saying ""I ain't gonna get sick.""

Not wrong can't even ""play along."" Wearing mask hard 5 minutes 7-11. hell horrible staying apart people? hell people suddenly like crowds? 

I remember people want smell other's BO check line. way back 2019 kids. Voice over: “if erection lasting four hours, call doctor, please isolate...l Mask usage 0.

Yep. Prerecorded lectures labs, tuition. parking fees. Pisses beyond belief. Why? curious. USA USA USA USA Except doesn’t exist. issues whatsoever eating $2 tacos car

Even though stuffing unwashed fingers facehole stuff taco exactly Covid easily get system? Deaths lagging indicator. think anywhere completely overwhelmed ventilated patients ICU, safe bet everyone ICU COVID getting form oxygen, everyone moved ICU need invasive ventilation. Studies like [this show many (but all) ICU patients ended needing it. Florida testing 70k / day last week yesterday like 50k something. great name sausage, Swaggerty Sausage Yeah 120,000+ deaths, what's afraid of?  


thisisfine.jpg  rural town 35k wait 2 hours free testing, kinda sucks lunch break yanno essential = expendable. People say stay closed vaccine/mutation/miracle, reality option requires lot federal dollars federal leadership. Take look around, that's going happen. states left dry, states can't run deficit. states' hand forced need grit teeth, tell people wear masks, hope blows without much damage. failure comes top down. tests! AITA planning summer house two? That’s second thought entire situation. Obviously, family’s safety primary concern, may lot future opportunity due “don’t tread me” attitude. Actually, research far seems show protests tried asking askscience admin said go, supposed ask main coronavirus subreddit. Maybe get answered here:

I check US covid rates every again. looking Florida noticed deaths seem weekly nodal period. would be? New cases seem matching trend.

I'm assuming work shifts, staff differences, reporting deaths based workweek. dips match weekend though. match Sunday Monday.

You mean, people live Michigan? Well guess people complaining summer vacation planned FL something all.... southwest FL straight refuses shut down, mandate masks anything whatsoever. ""humanity""s fault. mean like biological disorder. raise people selfish, unscientific world filled lies abuse - they're going act selfishly, unscientifically, ruthless.

Should'nt outright lied though Ok and? mean refuse wear mask now? said, real, legitimate fear people would buy PPE--and guess what, even without recommendation wear one people hoarded hospitals going without. Yeah recommended people make masks have, would bought supplies hospitals would screwed. Cases going constantly actual death toll covid/ patients requiring intensive care stayed consistent rise cases? cases mostly asymptomatic?

With un-deadly disease really is, really seems news *so many* new cases SINGLE day almost non-news/fear mongering sorts. think articles would say something cases likely asymptomatic. Sure, infect immunocompromised, non-statement unlikely die covid something think needs addressing. many know Fahrenheit, ponds cups are. Tell cities finding woefully unprepared handle riots they’ve late.

The people outnumber police national guard. aren’t enough jail cells lock up.  nOt..... actually comparing one state entire country's? [Heads FL government fired lead data change stats downplay cases bolster attempts reopening state economically. 

Edit: 

Here Rebekah Jones's tool indicate Florida totals today 10K cases: official data hard believe. 

I believe government official responsible charged first degree murder.  stay inside... Easy compare excess deaths expected deaths fact. Haha, outrageous. He's consistently wrong one pure bullshit wish health healing ahead. don’t know correct answer. thought companys pay sick.  fair point Yeah people value human life much 

/s stunning take say hundreds thousands protesters practically top weeks? Would possible push entire panhandle open ocean people die peacefully wearing masks? 29 ICU beds left pinellas county people still completely denial asymptomatic spread viruses transmitted air like that. fit expectations world deny it, rather incorporate newly learned information schema. Because, noticed number people even wear mask, lot Americans legitimately, objectively stupid. Americans vote interests. Americans would rather everyone suffer, including themselves, see tax money get pooled help brown poor person. like mutton cold winters? afraid little smog? Ive permanent cough 8 months two years. Many situation. sure /s family friend buried son month change ago. Believe don’t, prerogative either way There’s day day variation reporting, best way look 7 day average happened day last week. example, today’s death count 37 higher last Thursday 27. Additionally, seven day rolling average death count gone 31 time last week 38 week. trend definitely concerning, death count definitely starting increase statistically significant way. 

It’s really rocket science. People get infected, get sick hospitalized eventually passed away. live Florida too. wife berate condo boars putting signs encouraging (not even enforcing) masks hallways/elevators...and people still ignoring them. like London didnt bother shelter blitz hoped bad weather. Universal fun rides disney imo. mean. got $160 fine wallet pass transit Portland....20$ seems light Dude dumb fuck ok cancelled money, common sense.  people taking tests, probably random selection likely 20% people symptoms. Lt Gov clarified site hacked. There's technical issue case counter yet death rates dropping

You wrong. Florida, steadily rising since start June. Search ""death rate covid 19"" Google, provide useful tool browsing death rates state.

The low early June every low since rising. problem deaths mitigated hospital care (both extending time death preventing death) right hospitals overwhelmed, that's starting happen new hot-spot states (most South California).

On top this, heat summer kicks in, seeing decreased transmissibility. fact number infected rising terribly worrisome. low blow behind ref's back. define “health negligence”? Okay, gave novel 10 year old came back 2 days later asking sequel? opportunity cost several million dollars, I’ll take late fee, thanks. Plus evictions take 30 days majority areas. Excerpt:

People going even broke Oct. us hit herd immunity, hospitals would inundated. Even 250,000 infections per day (5x currently reported, YouYang Gu's estimates, saw March/April) would take 1.75 years half population immune.

&amp;#x200B;

To hit herd immunity January (180 days roughly) would require roughly one million infections per day. That's horrifying, hospitals could withstand that. Assuming 5% hospitalization rates (Idk actual number is, higher 0.5% IFR) would 50k hospitalizations day. country 700k hospital beds - roughly half already occupied. We'd run beds, nationwide, within month (since patients also get discharged). positive news?? real dumb. propose enforcing this? Yeah! USA N1! Wooooooo! Wait... :( think percentage positive cases number tests given important look at. Except good people wearing masks, staying home much can, social distancing can’t, didn’t vote him. They’re dying too. empathy loved ones isn’t much ask for. Nearly everyone confused medical grade protection vs. casual protection.  hospital dozens infected patients close contact, need least N95 along proper training avoid getting infected. standing supermarket hour occasional close contact, cloth mask going protect 95 times hundred. 

The mask statements scientific crowd.  I'm pretty sure focused extreme hospital scenario. Hell, pandemic, even cloth masks 50% effective going impact R-effective Hey, mean. really know cure us listen kind! Hopsitalization 2.5% 2021 guess Fauci promote early release anvaccine anytime soon.....

miracles? maybe shall see Restaurant managers accountable health safety patrons. twatwaffle isn’t fit lick bottoms restaurant worker’s shoes. Damn dude, can't even fact much idiot know talking to. 

February shorter months, therefore get lot less money. Hope helps issues. numbers take account many tests days many subsequent tests positive people retested?

Even more, people counted positive missed test contact someone positive. terrible lying.

No ad hominems. Again, addressed points failed rebut anything offered return.

A month ago made post asking people say reach peak infections?

Hasn't aged well. please, continue make ass comparing 20k people mass protest (a number made up) hundreds, thousands folks would flock communities Florida beaches.

Also, websites like Worldometers reported positive cases last night 2pm report numbers always roll today’s report. 

Then there’s fact almost 1100 new cases yesterday, that’s problem, it’s fact reported 4000 cases data whopping 26% positivity rate yesterday. 

we 17-20k tests day last week seeing numbers go around 400 positive 700-800. 

So report 4000 yesterday, positivity rate staggeringly high, today website reports data gets hacked seemingly right unknowing governor goes live discuss Covid?

I never said couldn’t wrong- corrected mistakes wish best. get this. two months ago:  couple things.

First, we're better treating covid first hit.

Second, cases probably much higher reported back March/April official numbers. still underreporting now, nearly degree. 

The second part critical case vs. death spike. actual infection spike happened earlier recorded due test shortages, looks like short lag confirmed case death, actually longer. People getting confirmed severely symptomatic, people getting diagnosed earlier sever symptoms hit. 

Finally seems like younger people getting time around (which probably function tests available before) see nearly many deaths younger cohort compared 60+.

I still expect deaths spike relatively soon, close correlation March/April high percentage confirmed cases ended death. works 29 cases per 100,000 population.

For reference, yesterday Texas reported 8,000 cases. That's roughly 28 cases per 100,000 population. Yeah, yep. definitely sucks us who've mindful start. can't nice things lol  theory RNA vaccine cheaper traditional one based inactive weakened virus actually need virus mass produce RNA lab.

County officials alarmed recent resurgence cases sent text messages, voice messages alerts hundreds thousands county residents week reminding virus’ “imminent threat.”

Oh now? Hey must coronavirus strategy. everyone state infected theres need lockdown. 

Guytapshishead.gif idea got from. know there. means possibly exposed thousands people virus. article. headlines post. like subreddit rules say. literally spending time arguing everyone point rather google. won’t announce shut downs soon. job disappeared week later businesses closed back down. that's kinda weird too. I'd think doctors front lines would good idea patients coming similar sickness recovering quickly due better treatments, example.

Of course, they're probably stressed busy cant step back look big picture. Looks like COVID Plunge Protection Team action. point trying make? That's good thing that's case. want become less lethal. becomes infectious brings less severe symptoms big problem. seems there’s quite people thread don’t seem understand viruses work. There’s lot people saying need try stop infections eliminate COVID-19 don’t understand doesn’t reduce total deaths requires immunity. Even then, it’s real possibility virus [stay join coronaviruses becoming part seasonal flu. 

Sure, flatten curve doesn’t reduce total deaths. That’s reason use word flatten, spreads infections deaths long period time. hope flatten far vaccine becomes available, there’s lot uncertainty there. Best case scenario one’s available mid-2021. It’s likely virus burn then. Places like Sweden (who social distancing lockdown) example entering single digits regards deaths. took Sweden 3 - 4 months population become immune point it’s nearly burned out. 

Point is, without vaccine you’re going change total deaths. try keep healthcare system communities overwhelmed, far we’ve done quite successfully. Top 12 states cases US death Rates:

7.68%, 2.58%, 8.59%, 1.45%, 2.14%, 4.93%, 7.40%, 7.34%, 2.01%, 3.36%, 8.72%, 4.69%

Average death rate US 4.68%. states lower death rates they're places like California, Texas, Florida, death lagging indicator death occurring usually around two weeks month positive test. death rate 4 5%. additional testing, evidence, etc. seen go down. ask again, numbers numbers? Sweden also acted early neighbors, 2-3 weeks earlier that, would numbers comparative neighbors also acted 2-3 weeks earlier well. trying go bit? point since Sweden acted late done more. acted much earlier could done even less.

The search vaccine new coronavirus running full speed worldwide. Biontech Mainz US company Pfizer presented encouraging results tests USA. road vaccine still long one.


Test persons would developed effective antibodies pathogen Sars-CoV-2. announced jointly Mainz-based biopharmaceutical company Biontech Pfizer Wednesday. still unclear whether antibodies actually protect infection Sars-CoV-2. Tests 30,000 test persons expected show this.



The tests already carried USA included 45 healthy volunteers aged 18 55 years. 24 received two injections active substance - slightly higher doses. Twelve subjects ultimately received one high dose, approach pursued further. Seven days second vaccination, antibodies detected 24 volunteers, able eliminate Sars-CoV-2 virus subsequent laboratory test. participants also showed significantly stronger antibody formation people already infected Sars-CoV-2.



According Biontech Pfizer, serious side effects. Candidates two vaccinations showed ""mild moderate local systemic reactions"". common local reaction pain injection site.


Experts evaluate test results positively

Several experts assessed results positively. Immunologist Bernhard Fleischer, former director Bernhard Nocht Institute Tropical Medicine, said results ""very remarkable"". would assume vaccine would protect infection coronavirus. yet proven.


""These good signals,"" commented Stephan Becker, virologist University Marburg. particular, good antibody concentration higher people undergone infection. However, results show whether vaccine candidate actually protects infection, said Becker. also unclear whether vaccination leads development so-called immune memory. would effectively prepare body infection coronavirus.



Biontech also testing potential vaccines Germany. first company Germany receive approval Paul Ehrlich Institute. BNT 162b1 name vaccine candidate US results available. BNT 162b1 yet approved use country world, Biontech Pfizer emphasized. However, vaccine approved, companies plan produce 100 million doses vaccine end year possibly 1.2 billion doses end next year.

Restaurants believed high risk people chew produce saliva, droplets, people also tend talk restaurants, research say produce nearly much droplets coughing, resulting infectious environment. reduce risk greatly dining outdoors (patio) Several super-spreader events observed restaurants. Even indoor dining distance place may safe, look case studies 

I heard super-spreader events cinemas, one talks cinema, risk relatively lower. Airplanes seen infections super-spreader events, believed universal masking helpful fact non-circulatory nature air conditioning system help counter fact enclosed space. Wow, close truth Study published Lancet. Reviewed 29 studies looked efficacy masks physical distancing. No. actually like suggesting EPA disbanded profits worst polluting factories, OSHA disbanded we're spending much safety measures, PETA disbanded pets contributing fair share GDP.

Knowing damage virus could cause, country like US, +60% people declare bankruptcy due medical bills, would worried hell hospitalization well. countries saw Covid-19 dangerous threat public health existence world map, US saw hoax another flu.

Both groups fully intend fly home return normal lives immediately, violating mandatory quarantine because- quote “we can’t afford go vacation quarantine after.”

I’m livid.

Edit: they’re going fun. mobile group went “they free stay beach already put vacation long enough”. “it’s fine they’re staying somewhere there’s people.”

...but travelling plane one top three coronavirus epicentres US 1700 new cases day left. two children intend return work daycare upon return home. not? It’s gonna ‘disappear’ someday anyways, right?! Nope. government better think something better. None One Child Policy bullshit (or Child). Lockdown again. Enforce masks fine violators. half measures fucking happened now, US #1! Guess bad testing Florida. live long enough Ah, yes. Numbers. see might hate those. put daughter daycare, summers. school year modify hours pick straight school need worry afterschool care. 

My boss actually talked coming back office, live one top 5 states new cases, I'm willing put daycare. (honestly, even checked daycare taking kids want send her). want ensure large spike Monday. Ok, reopening isnt going work, do? Time go Disney. want ride coaster virus land. Except studies done EU even America far show young kids (daycares elementary schools) actually spreading it. whatever reason seem major infection vector covid. back may. date, none places allowed schools open back left places closed/with restrictions saw increase cases it. 

so, science looking exactly? Covid far unlike respiratory illnesses know about. truly beast, whatever reason seems children less spared it. feel like Florida specifically saying ""shattered records"" might give wrong idea. hard argue people truly informed, fair vote.

Early 2000’s- Georgia surrenders COVID-19  r/COVID19 much better sub. know stance politics, least actual scientific information instead lot shitty news sources. letting virus take natural course vs. controlling course result less death 

Cute anecdote, shows naturally virus fucking dangerous infection quarantining vulnerable would useful. articles come MSM cherrypicked residents Reddit. I'm following logic. believe articles Reddit MSM, Reddit, even though data comes MSM? stating MSM useless they're guessing. Reddit god Fauci says something, he's blowing smoke he's one stated less dangerous now, infectious. large population set already infected due 40-80 %, mentioned article, yet mentioned articles ""good news""? There's consistency. 🦁 wanted name news. Publicity. But.... Ooof... that’s record don’t want have. ""Likely""??  ""likely"" it, vox. read article would understand people wearing masks. dont feel bad people losing jobs part. western nations handled well common strong core culture social identity among people. Portuguese, despite political party, apparently see Portuguese first.

In US doesn’t work way. People see party first, say real Americans party.

As outsider, position probably naive, see media, think UK starting dark path. reminnder official position ISS (the italian CDC) scientific proof virus less deadly, less aggressive less dangerous. People must wear masks closed spaces whenever 1 meter distance guarantee, wash hands frequently avoid gatherings.

ISS adds claims dangerous make people feel safe situations safe. send China? US seems world epicenter right feel much. son full time day care facility years. rates continued go up, quality went down. starting hiring 18-19 year old kids watch kids, revolving door new hires that.

I finally withdrew place right winter break. used field trips stuff science centers, museums, movies. field trip planned time go Goodwill buy board games school. 

I threw fucking fit immediately withdrew son place saw it. franchise daycare hundreds locations, fucking care making much money people possible spending little can. I'm sure unique specific company all. 

Providing child care people reduced (or free) rates would fucking wonders country. people charge would rather save buck send kids field trips fucking Goodwill rather investing profit back education.

That’s incest Alabama unless it’s going elsewhere? true. comment refute chap claimed high positivity rate means country nearing herd immunity. Pretty sure deaths always goal post... Yeah, agreed hitting testing capacity, beginning perform pool testing.

TL;DR pool testing -- Hopefully use fewer tests identify healthy vs sick people

- Throw 10 patient samples together run 1 test. 
- Negative, congrats saved 9 tests. Everyone healthy
- Positive, split test group two sub-groups retest.
- Rinse/repeat identified positive tests individual/s. 

The best case 1 test, everyone negative, 90% reduction testing. 

The next best case 7 tests identify one infected individual (test X People: 1x10, 2x5, 2x2/3, 2x2) 30% savings. worst case 17 (1x10, 2x5, 4x2/3, 10x1). Break-even 
around 20-30% infection rate.

That's objectively worse. Careful - sub hates kind talk. 

Maybe day people finally wake dangerous virus actually is. Yes, highly contagious respiratory infection serious effects unusually vulnerable people. beyond that, everything told COVID19 turned false.

It killed millions. new Spanish Flu. fact, killed less people die bad flu season. 

If look see Europe high excess mortality rate March - May, low mortality rate winter months compared previous years. 

And compare 2018/19 (December - May) period 2019/20 - significantly higher death rate 2018. 

The excess mortality rate minute lower usual. 

And governments know - Covid dangerous - really *that* dangerous. Hell, Jesse Ventura 38th governor Minnesota, US president WWE Hall Fame. 

People seem like wrestlers. 🤷‍♂️ Well thing said weeks ago states started reopen. clear death rates rising despite infection rates rising. social distancing really impossible need mask.

Im far off. construction industry considered essential, continued working. think yes, construction essential, example repairing flood damaged highway. that’s exactly do. draw 3D models people virtually tour building new home. essential, could easily done home. came work every single day. 
My boss would work home told needed closed essential personnel site. that’s went. qualified essential business simply essential category, every single person could required come work. Regardless non essential role business might be. 
I think could made lockdown lot effective government drawn distinctions. Also UK. Names details taken patrons, going bar, table service. yeah laws books relating spreading corona. wish was, would cause huge uproar, since currently many guilty parties country strolling stores without masks. W pdf found show new positive tests well. think positive rate 2% lower. Absolutely terrifying. Anyone know public data source that’s breaking cases service branch?   know i'll get downvoted this, increased testing comes increased numbers. Hopefully hospitals prepped state's reopening, gonna get messy Strange indeed, better safe. Unfortunately, seems often not, primary care physicians overwhelmed offering follow-up visits - telehealth otherwise, or, minimizing symptoms patients go in, haven’t seen enough later pneumonia turns chronic recovery symptoms mild cases, still probably merit observation, guidance least, sincere empathy. seems it’s generally understood physicians, perpetuate psychosocial experience, turn, may influence recovery symptom persistence loop. doesn’t help healing, overall. 

The length time symptoms seems consistent long-hauler reports, though certainly doesn’t preclude pneumonia need physician visit. indicates she’s follow-ups doesn’t sound like she’s getting responsiveness needs. think asked there’s named experience what’s happening her, name tossed around - “post-CoVid syndrome” that’s originally responding to. 

I would never recommend someone see doctor. people may access anymore may hesitate go hospital, especially course initial symptoms told stay home - symptoms much worse. That’s I’m reading. 

Doesn’t mean blood vessel proliferation may happening, mean could easily go doctor hospital dismissed, or, find nothing “wrong” still wondering lingering symptoms. It’s really important able define experience validate it, order heal it. Thus, sharing name. many people returning care dismissed feeling alarmed confused, they’re going unheard. Also, may necessary protocol actually treating symptoms, cases need tracked examined. That’s beginning happen. 

Essentially, trying validate name experience. it’s pneumonia, become imminently clear, regardless - right? : ) live south Florida. It’s fucking frustrating, parents around 70 can’t afford stay home. fucking hate yet still people won’t wear goddamn mask Sad part antivaxxers anti science numbnuts probably skipped algebra middle high school... Were.dpemeaj  It’s uncomfortable kinda like getting water nose, goes away much faster know never said anything pertaining right? little perspective here....

Well cross option. Covid affecting plenty people affected entire world, people still believe it.

When start seeing explicit consequences climate change, people going chalk either ""this always happens every thousands years"" ""it's Biblical apocalypse--if worried simply get praying Jesus, always gonna come back gonna soon now!"" state-appointed guardian denied care offered hospital.

Community spread Covid began cities around first week March. today, Toronto seen 1,090 deaths 15,000 cases, lockdown, testing, mask-wearing, distancing done fairly well, currently 75 new positive cases per day, fewer 15 requiring hospitalization. words, spread disease limited well ICU capacity hospitals.

In words, *none* catastrophe befalling Houston happen. Texan suffering loss friends family entirely preventable disease, I'd consider governor thoroughly rotten party guilty murder. We've change anything. Mexicans dual citizenship Baja/TJ flooding San Diego County hospitals since 2-3 months ago. closed border non trade travel then. don’t trust Pence trump reform anything benefit people. I’m hearing anything counter research, ignored. “Believe me, you’re sheep” doesn’t get people side. Dumbass. Don’t condescending next time.

Also, “Media Brainwashing” fuck think happening people wearing masks? grand conspiracy? Grow lmao. Masks masks, research shows help. Research also shows combination Masks distancing works. Get here.

They effective preventing general public catching Coronavirus, ...""    

The failure wear masks places open public, particularly grocery stores contributed community spread.    
And narrative masks wrong. 100% effective, yeah, say *prevent* getting infected. reduce virus ingested (infectious dose), extent Covid-19 like MERS, SARS, influenza, reduces resulting illness. could reduce need ventilators hospitalizations.    real monetary motivation, called opening economy back up. morons accept way permanently patient, wear fucking paper mask stay home while. Start campaign Mickey Mouse wearing mask, grown child adults infatuated Disney fall line. Family withdrawn Florida. expect real estate market ultratank Fellow Floridian here. I'm curious take this; seems point barely blame government opinion know attempting enforce kind mandatory mask act fly state like Florida all, live near villages everyone 55+ they're still shopping big box hardware store work without mask. even begin make entire population hangs fox news' every word understand valuable masks are. Florida even point? 

Lets say governor pulls Trumps dick mouth long enough enact kind mandatory mask act, would even follow it? convince entire base ignorant people nonsense they've spoon fed is, fact, utter nonsense? Last heard 70k per day. hard compare rates. Florida's CFR already way lower New York's. can't tell whether that's misreporting factor like vitamin D.  Deaths per day hospitalizations relatively flat past 45 days peak 60 days course, stupid person would cover mouth reduce oxygen brain. doctors let people die wear mask, wear one one die.  


The people bible walking desert probably never covered mouth cloths keep sand out. bible god intend us so. That's reason using technology used bible.  


Markus 420:69 ""And though post stupid shit social media selfish dick Jesus taught you"" Yeah likely making move, i'd sell shit hometown, drive cars new location go shopping hunker while.

alternatively rent one trailers fill it, lock it, pick drop new place, would relatively safe Actually, number tests per day still steadily increasing way allegedly. Anything better kind stupidity killed way people died Florida nationally.

But clearly happy gross incompetence excess death De Santis wrought state. guardians decided comfort care. denied anything. think Florida population density this. know, New York's public transportation served super spread virus. Florida likely people passing bars resturants families. Thx trump pence dasantis dump idiots  Americans value life economy.

NYC seroprevalence around 20%, indicates close 2 million infections. many days NYC test positivety % articles saying ""new record number cases"" also accompanied positives / new tests rate.

Commemorate capitalize on? Idaho maybe 1 10 lucky. Also I'm extremely generous. Kinda like common cold, form corona virus spreads fast really kill unless immune system weak stupid. people saying “See, wasn’t bad! 1 million people died! cares!” learned recently state halts it, company file insurance claims money matters. yep. fuck fucking bullshit ""doctors need it""

uh, hospitals fucking SUPPLY CHAINS. They're going go crying poor house buy 3 packs 10 masks family go sick. Turns can't properly convey thoughts either. give up. good day. Thankfully, stores mandated enforce mask wearing area yahoos like kicked out. Reason ironically named publication since Pravda.  don’t. heard stat local sports radio. know mandatory team testing started Tuesday June 23rd. He's actually reelection. Probably what's giving freedom right thing rather bow morons state less per day mid May 5/8 5/14. things ebb flow. hardly consider surge. Yes, isn’t true even debatable. Shot, Chaser got source. first sentence. Jfc read thread. Hopefully universities see negative attention going inevitably get use example do. well test, would much less... (DT 2020) not, objectively worse. Actually, no. Masks reduce transmission.  100%. (Even N95 masks 95% effective. That's ""95"" name.)  

The key use layers.  Distance people. Masks people. probabilities multiply. (Picking numbers air, here, illustrate principle.) meter distance reduces transmission by, say, 70%, leaving 30%. mask one person reduces transmission 60%, leaving 40%. mask second person reduces transmission 65%, leaving 35%.  three layers leave 30% x 40% x 35%, 4.2%.  

Reducing transmission 95%, enough defeat virus. 

But works almost everyone helps. Texan Here: hate place. politicians, heat, ungodly number idiots, inflated rent...I could go hours. True. OP much faith humanity. funny, c.onspiracy types wearing masks way anyone else said to, they're fervently anti-mask government recommends it. Strange times. like per capita race top south. cases per 100000 residents? mark! Get set! Go!

The governors standing around opening everything economic reasons, putting whole states risk. Assault implies pushed door. Refusing service assault. time. Hopefully see decent compliance start getting numbers control. uncle going visit us weekend lives there. live grandparents, parents, whenever anyone mentions tested replies safe he’s taking kids parks rivers. sure deal situation, seems like it’s going get worse (and everywhere America tbh) hopefully starts get better. Cases going tho. testing deaths Ok watch another company enforce take business put blame goes, Fauci CDC. yeah knew bullshit wearing masks cool Oh, PC. known. I'm kind hungry. Gonna Graham Caucasians unspecified flavored milk. states outside Northeast seeing reduction South Dakota Nebraska. serious suggesting people actually that.  called shit person. That's line. magically going away Donald? counties requirements weeks ones blowing up.

So make sense? No, difference adoption insane number multiplying scheme I’m sure haven’t looked seen video so... Remember doubling cases every month 6 weeks? days Masks definitely help, assuming people actually wear properly (I'm skeptical happen TX). also need comprehensive system track control spread virus, take immediate action outbreaks happen. happening places US right now. one possible arrangement, means arrangement. reasonable company expect working home, wear suit tie like working office, **so long paying amount money**. 

On related point, would expect company reimburse electricity internet, wanted enforce rules. friend. It’s bad realize Texas mostly suburban population, rate new cases increasing like whole state one densely populated urban city. apocalypse bingo get maybe penny, double size every day become Lincoln Singularity. Thousands unemployed Floridians lining take jobs.

Same reason airport work really care employee safety. get sick die problems replacing someone else goes unemployment. Win/win them. Glad could come objective title can't get people actually think that. stoped talking long time friends think shit. pretty decent job. It’s people comment stupid things makes wonder happened them. Took forever. still enough.

We need bigger fines, occurance.

We need mandatory quarantining positive test, mandatory separation, mandatory contact tracing using Apple/Google. plus masks required limit spread limit economic impact. boat are. fiancé supposed get married Hawaii September 9th, we’ve planned COVID hit. we’re really struggling whether go, even allowed point. I’m leaning towards cancelling, leaning towards going. idea decide need soon. Yes, that'd one. worry, spokesman said there's way know got virus, he's traveling extensively - including Arizona last week. 

Comforting.  know one person never changed one thing life get go till now. political one way other. however popular extroverted person lots kids friends. parties brunches playdates entire time. Barely wore masks. every day. 

Its political things-sometimes people like popular extroverted high energy way fuck ever isolating themselves. coworkers live CA going eat it’s safe now. also brag longer watch news it’s depressing.

""BuT DeAtH rAtE fAlLiNg... StOp ScArY MeDiA""

People dont die right they're diagnosed body holds weeks finally giving out... thought decided because:

1. Every day wait, studies coming relative effectiveness treatments. every day contract odds improve.
2. contract now, 14 days hospitalization, lot states hospitals forecasted full then.
3. Even young people, chances post-viral syndrome seem high. people know contracted covid, work three months still unable basic things like walk around neighborhood climb flight stairs. Right almost study recognition post-viral syndrome non-lethal, problem going around quite while. paid first thought fall optimistic, still think widespread roll-out. 

That said, reading countless posts r/COVID19 pretty well convinced going least one vaccine approved distribution fall. Possibly one, think veers back overly optimistic path. 

However, widespread distribution first, likely happen early 2021. least get healthcare workers essential public-facing workers (grocery store employees, transit operators, etc) vaccinated fall, that's going go *long* way getting us 2021. Trump would proud. blame CDC said masks work first  Same. get cautious would help slow down, stop it. know countries longer wavelength found key keeping steady flow. interesting see things progress next months. Hopefully things stay good them, honestly see could.   well-educated medical professional, science based person... went gym today (which mask order), 45 people there, probably 5 wearing masks correctly wearing throughout duration time gym. wearing chins, rest covering mouths. Granted wearing mine correctly, able entire hour workout 18 minutes rowing machine high intensity problems.PEOPLE STUP1D, PEOPLE SOUTH EVEN STUP1D!

That said, i'm happy see walk back re-opening policies. Albeit, very, very, slow walk-back that.Hospitals capacity now, cases growing 75% rate Texas week. going catastrophic mess end 2nd third week month. Yep.  believe founding fathers got correct.

I'm gay fairly left leaning almost politics.

Except 2nd amendment. I'm pro 2nd amendment.

It right proper governments' enforcers, ultimately government officials utilize them, must constantly remember citizenry work literally kill go far. ""death rate"" low are

A. Misclassifying deaths pneumonia

B. including deaths nursing homes reasons

So deliberately manipulate data, point data justification nothing. 20 dont ookie cookie. fucking excuse. blood hands people, including CDC run mill doctors, telling people wear masks. hope can't sleep night. American things. would posit China anything resembling lockdown. minor inconveniences we've endure states comparison nowhere near actual lockdown. Watch idiots leadership pass something like 2 months things finally getting better remove requirement. MASKS REQUIRED VACCINATION FOUND. back young ones come in, cross covering critical care wing (I'm surgery, hospital slashed elective surgeries MONTHS ago, total monsters) lot time hands days. 

Doing whole 9 yards presenting grounds, hear 4 gone parties weekend. Cue contacting public health, getting contact tracing going, know drill. 

One crit care pulmonologists unironically said loud ""these assholes seem care, vote waste vents save people actually understanding serious situation is""

I wanted guy say ""hey, thats right"" ""dude, come on"" truth is? thought thing. 

There fucking assholes every age range taking seriously, experience skewing towards younger assholes keep going bars, keep partying, keep morons ""it can't affect me"". 

Well congrats bastards, always did. took minute numbers start catching up. Thats ignoring long term systemic damage virus capable doing.

Basically *only following orders*, right? Really!!!

Look examples. Data. 

If you’re US I’d love know doubts full lockdown adherence mask wearing stay place answer. US, there’s need discuss further. 

“Give time.” Unfortunately time US worse it’s going get. don’t doubt States going see 500K dead over. 

I’m happy UK’s response overall, live everyone careful respectful others. hope beat like Spain NZ/Aus. point assuming bought Reddit account parents don’t know Reddit.  would think people enforce government mandated controlled genital coverings. work home, likely sort one-off (i.e. pinch), constant situation. company paying amount money, reasonable company expect things would working office. seem unreasonable me. even get mild case lung damage organ damage percent people effects right? odds resurgent infection percent well. Also nice see possibility killing people something live with.

Orange guy said November . cover /s  Uh fock sub Sounds like time call back. record it. uptick Florida Texas began first/second week June. Yeah you’re definitely right, deaths lag four(ish) weeks. it’s gradual lag trend upticks cases. think uptick deaths im surprised aren’t seeing rolling average % deaths saw back spring conjunction new cases. Basically deaths aren’t dramatic. good thing, don’t know people don’t like hearing that. already said police stop anybody department health checking restaurants. So?? cough, cough

Rather inappropriate context! /s I'd rather homeschool children! Thank you! Great, every employee arrived Pensacola 4th. already know won’t wearing masks get back, probably won’t taking temperatures. 15 people 3 vehicles 10 hours there, sharing single house... might go back work lol  I’m Texas anymore thank God. still worry family. Funnily enough, brother Miami! Fun! lockdown. Doesn’t matter lockdown going die going die lockdown isn’t going anything except prolong months you’ll get it.

Everyone bound get point isn’t going eradicated completely. Even vaccine won’t 100%  point people criminally liable infecting others knowingly Holy. Fucking. That. Cain afford health care, people wearing masks, society going chip health care costs event get ill. So, think people want wear masks bit snobbish, since they'll certainly want society pay resulting health damage. Maybe that's sign lockdowns work. Darwin award remain close home virus becomes geographically limited spread. 

You leave home essential activities (pretty much food shopping hospital). could exercise close home. They're probably ones pushing hardest parks reopen. Florida Travis Tiger King confirmed Mandatory quarantine place month ago, reinstated. effect mask compliance.  uncle month cousin mid twenties good shape 3 weeks went away. feel like indoor dining bars big impact grocery stores. I’m bartender NC mask mandate everyone still doesn’t give fuck restaurant given trying force people wear table.  Huh country 216 new cases whole, I’m sure there’s fake news reason state less half population 50x cases. masked jaw! school also something similar every class in-person online components... except aren’t allowed opt in-person part.

They want people pay full-price campus housing money still receiving worse quality education worse living experience (a bunch dorm restrictions needed) much higher chance getting vid. running logic stance. wants job enforcing that? Florida confluence old people, stupid people, stupid *and* old people. little late. live LA, far cheaper area. make good money, I'd never live WeHo unless making REAL money - everything expensive overpriced there. figured people live would rich, areas LA rent much less. would stay fuck away parents foreseeable future. No; unconstitutional. Umm, no.

Sorry, Alex Jones, grade bullshit. article yesterday similar parties upstate NY party-goers refusing co-operate contact tracers subpoenaed fined $2000, everyday co-operate, courts. started 7th (Sunday) ended June 13 (Saturday). dobule Sunday. impossible double day week long time period averaged 7 days. 

There reason always use calendar week (Sunday-saturday). long use 7 days average, double count. That's actually linear growth. difference you’re getting 8hrs someone. set expectation much work done daily whatever person home shouldnt matter metrics reflect agreed upon work mysterious reason weekend thousands 70 year olds received phone calls doctors explaining drawbacks hospital care. coincided time ICU's south overflowing. Wow! definitely rookie numbers! Question Covid ran course U.S. everyone continue wear masks social distance year round? (If not, really make everyone look like hypocrites). 
Also, much data source data willing opinion severity CoronaVirus change? instance, waiting Dr Fauci solely tell virus ran course? specific number 7-day/30-day reduction confirmed CoronaVirus deaths begin accepting going back normal? solely personal risk. Stop acting like is. actively harmful community.  I’m sure everyone following rules following set rules beneficial effect, hypothesis herd immunity play here. remember seeing article randomized testing specific part Italy saw 50% antibodies. [ Florida ]( ) Also take grain salt, remember someone said strain NY much higher viral load Good thinking fellow man. gold give, I'd give it. Narrator: ""But Texan compliance low"". understand happens person needs ICU bed, can't get one, right?

Maybe also thinks go away without intervention soon, like magic. America society cares best individual what’s best society coupled federal government doesn’t care either, doomed beginning mean it’s fairly logical. you’re sick enough get admitted you’re told go home self isolate, nobody who’s showing symptoms about. It’s moderately sick hospitals worried about, all. Engineer here, wrong. comment absolutely nothing point made. literally stated government shouldn’t pick choose enforce law on. gathering gathering. Tickets ridiculously (relatively speaking) expensive family added cost (food, drinks, not) super high. Economy great likely 6 months. industries, job security high right now, even job. get people. sure got votes , mean saying wasn’t obese ? It’s pretty valid since seems kill old obese immune compromised young , didn’t make up. I’m pretty sure ton people getting really sick would noticeable without media coverage Independence mortal coil. Family Houston area baby shower last week. outdoors, hear, believe it, multiple kids, pregnant woman older grandparents house.  Florida know contest least cases per day most? tell them? take dog sort sanitizing dry shampoo thing use incoming patients, ask use cat way out? contain outbreak, Florida closed bars beaches governor resisted requiring masks statewide public reimposing lockdown.

This problem is. stupidity combined tribal politics. common sense wear masks pandemic caused virus transmits respiratory means. must scientists proven common sense. Requiring masks costs nothing beyond vanity fragile masculinity. look blind thinking led you. Freedom free collective society works whole, happens America. Christ hospital admin calling intervention, know something's up. fuckers care orphan bled one ED lobbies didnt insurance. mean, good news there's plenty evidence showing nothing. So... Who’s going enforce it? Chicago, people consistently wearing masks public fucking police. coronavirus first emerged(and people took seriously) Fauci team claiming masks useless.

Not bit overstated ""useless"", couple aspects find rather dishonest people bring Fauci masks. btw, necessarily directed bringing up, brought here.

Not information mask effectiveness somewhat vague first, professionals wanted avoid run masks would limit front line health care workers. [And Fauci talked even irritating Fauci talked wearing masks back beginning 13 weeks ago? Frankly think gets lost people that, whatever idiotic reason, want minimize mask usage constantly bring initial bad mask info. Makes seem like information changed recently. even close.

I think initial ""dishonesty"" masks mistake opinion. erodes trust. seemingly point vast majority people constantly bring bad guidance corrected months ago. dishonest people want masks essentially concern trolling earlier bad guidance. Haha. Kansas, know won't. easily find several counties local police departments enforcing this. ‘Murica free-dumb RIP IDIOTS, Pool Time!!!! ok fine got exponent. understand cases skyrocked back things opened. good news, shows really understand virus works. hell people getting tested? testing sites zerged. Always remember:

**""Seriously people - STOP BUYING MASKS!""**

U.S. Surgeon General, Feb 2020

**""There reason anyone walking around mask on""**

Dr. Anthony Fauci, Mar 2020

Our government officials got wrong start, people died result. I'm see matinee. yup article says Cobb, Dekalb, Fulton, Gwinnett, Dougherty.

Probably likely due opening restaurants taking proper precautions. Influenza! anything Covid because? question anyone sorry scientific background understand much get admitted icu saying 40% chance death? seems ridiculously high telling half people icu going die? come talked unless seeing correct numbers. Thanks anyone reading extremely scary alot worse thought. Coronavirus dislikes Fair question. add others said, it’s gigantic state, despite comfortably blue, conservative strongholds there. live FL many state plates coming fourth mostly NY, NJ, MA... fucked Cyber police shoot manatees. celebrate reenacting shooting manatees. Days later start worry body cams footage. Better get mass grave business.

Thanks Floridian sinkholes, graves dig themselves! don’t need law murder many people country don’t commit it.  course Florida. No. Linear would 2 + 2 + 2. I.e. 2 additional cases every x days. Doubling every x days indeed exponential growth. many hospital leadership science background. still this? kind groupthink. What? It’s like staring giant growing tsunami wave. keeps getting bigger bigger. 

This crazy. Yesterday Canada 67 new cases. That’s entire country.

We 27,912 active cases. 

Florida 139,832 active cases.  Floridian visit us last year Portland OR, getting/giving directions damn near impossible.

""Hey want meet downtown dinner?""

""Sure, take minute, mountain.""

""You went mountain? Cool, see tomorrow guess mate fun Hood.""

""Hood what? No, mountain. meet like 45 though.""

Ten minutes conversation later work went south west hills edge town. Elevation 500 feet. Still inside center city. US shitshow. 

Rest EU far effective track trace system. expected better Nic Cage. Probably STI? See y’all another thread headline tomorrow However, certainly encouraging mortality rate inversely decreasing! actually happening everywhere. Many countries opting downplay it, happening. fellow Miamian, I'm glad least mayor taking things seriously masks mandatory county. think shape looking 

WWWW\____________ want information. record number tests done? old people died? nursing home deaths? I'll put money 90% deaths people 80 above.

edit: downvotes? Apparently people want know facts. Clouds stop UV rays now? Oh doubt entire thing ruse get poor making rich money. I'm MA. told doctor sore throat feeling stuffy. get test drive thru center day. Took week results handling well New England general! getting number? Imagine believing this. 40k tests per day numbers flatten due capacity testing bet. mention NBA coming Florida end July. seriously doubts they’ll able finish season.. Every person good faith knows say truth, listen trolls. I'm sorry loss. know Florida things I'm even American... coronavirus numbers game done differently different places going something we'll picking apart years.  

I tend look obvious signs horror. bodies piling fast they're stacked trucks? hospitals able care virus patients properly, still go ahead medical care issues? staff dropping like flies? shortage staff PPE ventilators? Tests/cases/deaths necessarily tell that. Whether coronavirus death even reported part numbers game. tested important many tested. bit mess. Good luck figuring out, certainly haven't. Speaking adult pass Disneyland, enjoy going gf cause it’s 45 minute drive good fun. California adventure sells alcohol drink, get snacks &amp; go favorite rides. usually go work couple hours. total day comes $60-70 close we’d pay went eat somewhere. one other? False dichotomy. he's American odds yes California 6% positive tests right now, Florida 16%. California many people anti-science, whether it’s conservative pockets deny COVID, climate change, etc. liberal areas people natural healing organics anti-vax

LA melting pot businesses saw early rush reopening mean I’m gonna stop wearing mask, bro giving anyone else terrible acne? Trapping breath mixed summer heat horrors poor face. I’m already like 5 without acne lmfao underrated comment. I'm cool gay cucumber. worry brah. rich. Cant forget oppressed people. Woo-hoo, stock market going roof!! States limited federal government terms much funding use help citizens. great leader made abundantly clear states everything help mitigate spread flatten curve going get assistance. Look personally attacked New York Washington early spread crisis mode. Look Houston, freed $15,000,000 rent vouchers go people can't pay rent July. money evaporated 90 minutes can't offer without federal grants.

This individual states doing. states' hands tied point, federal branch failing us. almost got FB argument someone said 3 businesses closing hundreds sign businesses right thing. 🤦 Universal studios open weeks now. know dumbass friend went. “No lines!” sure. Climate change like slow motion covid-19. reveal shortsightedness certain mindset. ignore experts believe affects them. America first!  Imagine applying million dollar NIH grant study hypothesis ""Do Masks Work?""

You'd laughed profession. Sorry bud, Russian conspiracy Great hear! antibody studies hard hit regions? Yeah would **not** trust kids idiot willing accept fucking five bucks hour take care kids, I'd worried kids survive week... Oceania always war Eurasia. Brainwashed  Covid cells grow tentacles guys missed week... ""Grannys got freedom die like rest us."" Let’s hold Vince mc-douche-bag criminally liable reckless disregard human health. That’s gonna hard beat states. think Texas could beat them. commit work it. Excluding California, heavily fueled less 8 states across entire southern region (sw se) : AZ, TX, LA, AL, TN, GA, SC, FL.

I get it. Italy &amp; Spain example disastrous virus be.

Even say Europe's base condition nothing like U.S (which ridiculous argument make), NY example, specifically NYC, show virus' effect highly urbanized areas.

Regardless differences states, every state least 1 urbanized location Well, one big difference teaching profession known career progression beyond maybe moving administration, everyone takes job knows that. Also, guaranteed pension need value also.

Edit: brother passed parents pay within 2 years leaving school. say deserved worked long time, realized chosen careers create much value never decided change career did. Florida Texas reported Galveston closing beaches July 4th huge. brother supposed start college FL fall. parents eventually convinced defer year. sucks cause excited go top choice school. FL even close safe right now. Florida legalized fireworks year certain holidays. People congregating around neighbor blew entire stimulus check fireworks since none local cities firework shows. think better testing minority poor areas? beginning June amazed little testing sites available areas. wonder idiot governor say HOLY HELL.

I live Texas, things getting pretty hairy here, Florida different level. I'm saying literally possible unless start detecting 100% cases. Liberal areas tend cities. Cities higher population densities. It’s much easier virus spread environment. Another one. suggestion Sars2 circulating much longer thought. Perhaps Barcelona one march contaminated otherwise false positive (though reputed) .... beginning seem stretch back least October .... earlier. also throws fair amount water ""its China lied Late December / Early January"" narrative. Perhaps countries get mitigating rather wasting valuable time energy blame. die outside hospital less likely evidence confirming corona. Easy way reduce initial death counts! mean Newsome better governors I’ll give that. happy said something along lines “science, politics dictate move forward” uhh yeah turned true I’m back working office home working. would make SAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDDD panda testing increase positive rate? anything testing bring since ability test less sick people less likely actually it. mid June single digits yesterday 18%. Even want look total cases percentage positive creeping concern you. Fauci team claiming masks useless.

I looking source weeks. found paraphrased statement USAToday.

Source? I've seeing reports people could suffer longer expected well permanent damage lungs, brain organs. athlete told return work, I'd fucked lungs damaged. I'd sue damages that's career-ending injury struggle breathe athlete.  didn't, gov't website did. imagine make keep picture date. better assume lifelong complications take extreme preventative measures getting first place (wear mask anytime leave place, socially distance, stay active, eat healthy, drink water, take vitamins needed) rely luck.

The experts saying lifelong complications permanent lung damage highly likely. Here's actual life hack- kids watching Netflix streaming service, turn subtitles. There's huge body evidence shows aids reading comprehension, vocabulary acquisition, reading speed great things young minds. mean bad. least he's sending good message don’t know DeSantis young office it’s personality thing, governor you’re supposed feel personally responsible well-being state. 

Somewhere mind there’s disconnect that’s causing see political game. Whatever is, it’s incredibly disturbing. Idk right thing do. thing over, complete failure lack federal response, realistically, could pull every businesses license positive cases. rate everyone country get sick. need nationwide shut again. can’t punish every single business positive test government completely failed people. That’s take it. example, I’m bartender tourist town. Tons people traveling right now. yell every single person doesn’t mask lose licenses. It’s fucked even put position stubborn people can’t asked wear mask. Bars shouldn’t even open right received PPP loan opened right away order forgivable. Certain businesses put terrible position right shouldn’t even open first place. He's busy gargling Trump's balls. Yeah except go look ""mysteriously"" like 5x many people died died ""pneumonia"" ""flu"" last month compared month last year. 

There lot people dying Covid getting reported something else death rate look spread misinformation. get disease, likely everyone US will. Saying inspires people careless ""Well going get eventually! cares??""

Very careless misinformation spreading. flag  employer ""making"" (lol) catch virus work there. need pissy anything sista! Edit: found Florida's testing info. pretty scary. ""The percent positive results ranged 8.98% 18.51% past 2 weeks 16.78% yesterday ""

Wow, absolutely idea positive rates high. That's insane. Roll Tide! mass death also kills businesses, maybe shouldnt discount much hospital ships can't go Arizona. hear nearly 1% population died? 

There 22,000 deaths NYC. 1 percent population NYC 84,000. Predicted what?! yeah China exports $10 billion worth medical equipment March&amp;April alone, 200K masks make Taiwan look superior. love anti-china comment, lot channels you. sub particularly, people realize life/death situation give shit propaganda. Sorry. cares 200K superior masks. put eye pupil They've completely reported cases they're whatever threshold

Being transparent transparent exactly lofty ideal scariest part. FL going hit plateau daily new cases think things getting better, fact, they've hit maximum testing capacity.  Maybe evidence suggesting could get long-term herd immunity it... 😭 know 100% yet, announced. Well exact reasoning delay clear, it’s still reassuring many candidates moving intense focus exact timing trial stems tight nature race develop vaccine novel coronavirus — fact delay could imperil Moderna’s pole position. **Pfizer, working German firm BioNTech, plans start 30,000-patient study later month. AstraZeneca Oxford University slated begin similarly sized trial August, followed Johnson &amp; Johnson September.** That’s great. 

The death rate little correlation rise. 
With every new case, every new wave, little virus proven less less lethal. people understood stats. Yes, argue that. scientific study proved that. governors country, Florida's governor handling worst. literally plan anything. question, punts local authorities. take responsibility provide leadership whatsoever. met Floridians? think still ploy take fearless leader bunker boy need vaccine know Orange county conservative, enjoy ban Probably like New York today Lol sure showed science nerds Agreed. single team forced forfeit game season done. guess season canceled starts due outbreak team America gave even started. Fingers crossed Oxford comes through, without things look bad. put risk going secluded cabin people already live with. 

Nobody going stay home forever. work, go store. careful possible can't expect anymore me. rationally. really anymore. Based logic would sporting events, festivals, concerts announced advertised?
Are 12? Florida batting 100 pandemic. want throw away god-given breathing system? one's listened science though [Shaq heard new  Here's reddit's beloved Dr Fauci saying protests [are perfect set-up spreading [here's shows hospitalizations started going 1-2 weeks protests, reopening started weeks ago.

I really care speculations find websites openly supported protests, news media said anti-lockdown protests increase spread. Oh yea goon hard Florida. one wears mask heat kill virus~DT 100% shit. Desantis made clear everyone make call shutdowns, masks hospital usage local level. hasn’t tied anyone’s hands. He’s type situation heavy handed Tyrant. happens lot idiots Florida. followers need understand that, despite trashing masks media, actually wears thinks one Lakers win= Gold purple wins= gold wins. 

OK I'm loading gold stocks.  Due better testing though right? 

With amount deaths NY vs % people takes get numbers high, NY must days 100,000 new cases US seems big diverse control (democratically). real leadership course biggest issue. Clear communication, concise information carefully selected team experts field, would helped lot. 2020 election year sure helpful. Every measure taken became political, cooperation pandemic critical.  Yup hope catch covid. Stupid things happen stupid people. bad part granny's compromised people injured/dead stupidity get month two, even still lingering symptoms think might base camp honest Maybe could high school student stay entirely remote, use high school building space spreading younger kids. Here's need lockdown reopen successfully: serious lockdown, people actually cannot leave homes except essentials exercise walks/runs. half-assed lockdown. locked down, put strong efficient, testing, contact racing isolation system place prevent spread reopened. cases declined significantly, begin staged slow reopening put contact tracing effect stamp new cases spread far. Many countries able reopen successfully live virus. new outbreaks able stamp out.

Clearly, though living US, look see missing great deal need reopen successfully. he's taking medication control blood pressure would considered underlying condition. tell avoid crowds avoid social gatherings. higher risk serious complications need avoid exposure. This..

But illness completely different. spreads without us even knowing unlike SARS h1h1 Spanish flu ect. One person could literally blow cases cause millions infected

Did know there’s still cases Black Plague- thing except contained today’s society since symptoms arise contagion. 5% percent car crashes end death too. balances out. Haha wow would thunk it??? I, one, complete disbelief I'm FL they're limiting tests per site. 400 one place 100 day. places ordering tests trying open test sites get around getting tough. lot really rich people majority wealth tied stock market. property values plummet, easy enough rich powerful snatch prime real estate... particularly oceanfront. trm*pster fire* apparently also damage almost organs. Full recovery without longterm side effects guaranteed long shot. individuals months relearning basic skills, list goes one seems interested generally seem think virus ""just another flu"" definitely not. ok dude Americans pay lot healthcare therefore hospitals capable handling outbreak like this

That's keep reassuring us non-Americans least agree. clear rules ”little sick”= work home, sick work = stay home benefits. also believer working home 1-2 days week universal income. Bring yer Yeah 10% wearing masks local big Tesco's Edinburgh. I'll watch interest. (I'll wearing face covering shops myself.) someone that, I'd pull over, sunny area summer, roll windows get car spreader leaves puts mask properly. neighbor Navy told last Friday. Basically can't anything essential; including get exercise beach get haircut. There's also rumors digital attacks keep taking servers. I've plenty. sprawl, blandness lack real identity makes thrilled leave finally do.

Only one set grandparents left others moved back north permanently, pretty soon feel pressured go back getting annoyed too. Who's CEO car brand drive? Ooop, tell without looking could you. Whoever is, top 4 automakers, much scumbag elon, done leaps bounds EV movement. Soooooo cares think even know car's CEO outspoken. many college aged elderly people working long shifts ~ok pay pandemic arent going properly sanitize 40 square mile park. Logistically isnt way efficiently guests running around immediately respreading germs. Florida here, “those rookie numbers” wait couple weeks. personally willing go live street stop spread corona virus?

its easy say...we need lock down...when going suffer it, unemployment starting run guys they're getting desperate, peoples homes marriages line. We're going see massive pressure July people run benefits reopen across board regardless terms cases case, even people antibodies transmit disease. Guess moot point. ...yeah so, um, get ventilators. us taking seriously great treatment; take bets among survive.  Thank &lt;3 staying safe, importantly, keeping public safe staying home!! Make America great again, say. results besides death also good. I'm definitely going survive stomach bug, I'm gonna fuckin enjoy it. Oh yeah, Mount Trashmore. American here: I'm genuinely confused USA numbers. graphs show huge increases number cases. fatalities graph showing smooth decline. increases started month ago, one would think plenty time fatalities also start increasing.

Other people must solid explanation that, right? better treatments? testing? takes month catching Covid-19 die? forget election.    like Gerard Butler 

#DISNEY WORLD FALLEN mean, appreciate hearing this. get lumped together whole often. really fucking sucks. reading headlines absolutely asinine people ‘leading’ us... essentially yelling louder everyone else room... fucking shame. I’ve never less proud embarrassed country. toddler home even worse. Try working 2 year old running around. 2 weeks symptoms/ hospitalization 3 weeks IC it’s bad. feel sad people Florida, death rate half juli increasing fast Nice man didn’t see information way love way explained it. husband ER doctor he’s essentially laid off. Prior pandemic great need ER doctors able work locums addition full-time job. could literally picked anywhere wanted work get job. Now, like said, he’s basically laid can’t find work anywhere everyone cutting staff hours one hiring. I’m talking across country. He’s spent last months applying jobs country success. true nursing staff. 

No one going hospital doctor’s offices right fear catching Covid. many people lost jobs benefits they’re putting necessary medical care can’t afford it. 

Our country fucking mess. ...its revoked. EU cannot really anything this. prove actually visiting lover random person paid pretend one? need move US. Somehow, way. 2020 made realize many ignorant idiots here. guy vaxxes Desantis - “Hold beer.” I'm Germany, going anywhere, thanks wishes.

You too, bud. confirm. ridiculous. get people masks generally lack mob mentality shame people wearing one. People want bars open. Canadian fellow Americans

STAY FUCK COUNTRY

We ease lockdown amazing policy joke though Uh ventillators helped 5 10% people put them. hard stay home?  eyyoooo Depends.

Can bench press without mask? comparison, California almost double population Florida worst single day (June 30) 8,600 positive tests. 

California also testing 2 3 times people per day Florida. nearly fat. Canada get wacked too. Give 3 weeks. can't imagine going like 6 months road.. would ok 40% now? That's within range flu vaccine. Lol, best could done. crux American exceptionalism fallacy, Americans think everything 'freedom' reality detriment can't see past perceived greatness. Yeah. seeing many posts, seems huge appeal Disney theme parks lot people, kids not. wrong wrong crowd suppose. People horrifically bad properly grasping cause effect amount obfuscation (like lag time) two. School districts need get creative space.

Where, possible setup tents sports fields. one playing football anyway. Turn gym class space. Rent space shuttered convention centers. Whatever.

Spread everyone out, stay outside much possible. work. Oooh, like that.

That's even better Ron DeKlantis. Arguing medical staff particularly disheartening.  ""WhErE StUdY?!?!?!"" 

Yeah one virus brand new would hard one ethically. Come overpriced man science.

At least one finally admitted probably helps depend think going save me.  exactly felt start argument. hate people living somewhere? know ridiculous sounds? freedom crowd red herring.

Have seen pictures? convincing government anything.

The wealthy dark money campaign responsible reopening.

They advertised certain crowd create scapegoats.

But almost reopen websites campaigns funded folks every state. Billionaires. **There still time.. every single Governor US. 100% reopened capacity seeing increase cases. Sweden mote deaths per capita, less testing per capita, less cases per capita US.

Suprisedpikachuface.jpg comes later underreporting numbers purposefully limiting testing.  Florida kid verify this, saw snow first time like 3 years ago supper excite popped sun roof see better, I’m 30. isn’t doctor alive would advise wearing mask manual labor warm temperatures.

So perfectly fine right thing, then. argument cardiovascular event wearing mask fucking stupid women allowed pilots air travel invented ""it's fast, ovaries might fall out!""

The military routinely exercises missions full mop gear, including gas mask. Unless gigantic blob fat that's never moved, wear fucking mask. simple. political attack, ""unconstitutional"" that. fucking wear it, piece junk. LOL except literally says she’s certified internal medicine bio air dropped India Florida real, possible scenario. EXACTLY functions. insurance companies medical companies know pay whatever health keep raising prices. surprisedpikachu.gif learned George Carlin wise man. looked up, see edit above. link little long grab mobile,  case, monitoring, PUI info link dashboard link Floridas covid site. Oh, realize. think article read Tampa, Miami makes sense. true. Last week dow dropping based new surge CA, TX FL.

It bad news priced in. news priced big jumps surprises. case, expect 3M jobs got 4. adjustment. live 5 mins Disneyworld passholder 20+ years experience, adult Disney fans would still go pandemic, credible terrorist threat, active hurricane zombie apocalypse. adult friends neighbors fall two camps - going back soon opens despite knowing limited service, PPE restrictions general infection risk ""I need Disney fix"" outright cancelling annual passes (myself included) stuff calms lot - probably next year. underestimate number childless, adult diehard Disney fans. district R+15, no. He's going nowhere. 60/40 last time Blue WAVE election. 


Now delete post political ... You’re going eat words. Please believe say this, someone gets end life eating longer necessity body. difficult eat actually cause discomfort eating. may didn’t give food wanted make comfortable knowing end coming MUCH WINNING!!!!!!!! MERIKA!!!!!!!  Yes, thank you. forgetting factor July 4th. disaster US, Florida...

In Boston seemed like lockdown inevitable, mayor gave bars one last Saturday night. tinfoil hat crowd thinks generous political donors liquor licenses wanted empty perishable inventories.

I bet lot kegs beer purchased tapped preparation 4th. relevant? Also, take mask cough sneeze. Don’t forget Halloween wtf? intentionally trying rush herd immunity?? Floridians get message last week stay home?? like half state wants catch covid. point they're going need implement dusk dawn curfews slow growth. hospital surging actually might census cancelation elective surgeries People staying home. orange county decent amount masks. go rural better chance struck lightning seeing someone mask. cautious parks

not really high standard there. What’s wrong that? It’s better assume avoid infection, assume won’t find 2 years later lungs fucked. Yup. thanks others. wrong regarding Disney theme parks appeal adults. I'm different crowd guess. single person know (with kids etc.,) like theme parks, sake kids; topic disney never came (okay, us talked avengers endgame not). gonna sanitising every seat rides?

lol Hellooooo Texas. Well, one cults isn’t actively worsening pandemic. So, now, forgive singling one out. Thanks, too. mean re-learning.

We learned generations ago. FDA. put hygiene safety standards. Worker regulations. Laws waste disposal.

All found hard way businesses can't self-regulate right thing. need intelligent leaders average person stupid know what's best *dabs Gator*  One things noticed living awhile, NY, could see much sky. There's nothing way everything damn flat. systematic review, identified 10 RCTs reported estimates effectiveness face masks reducing laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections community literature published 1946–July 27, 2018. pooled analysis, found significant reduction influenza transmission use face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25) (Figure 2). One study evaluated use masks among pilgrims Australia Hajj pilgrimage reported major difference risk laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection control mask group (33). Two studies university settings assessed effectiveness face masks primary protection monitoring incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza among student hall residents 5 months (9,10). overall reduction ILI laboratory-confirmed influenza cases face mask group significant either studies (9,10). Study designs 7 household studies slightly different: 1 study provided face masks P2 respirators household contacts (34), another study evaluated face mask use source control infected persons (35), remaining studies provided masks infected persons well close contacts (11–13,15,17). None household studies reported significant reduction secondary laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infections face mask group (11–13,15,17,34,35). studies underpowered limited sample size, studies also reported suboptimal adherence face mask medical masks (also known surgical masks) loose-fitting devices designed worn medical personnel protect accidental contamination patient wounds, protect wearer splashes sprays bodily fluids (36). limited evidence effectiveness preventing influenza virus transmission either worn infected person source control worn uninfected persons reduce exposure. systematic review found significant effect face masks transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza. see confused layman. I'm telling expert wrong. There's zero chance someone governmental custody suddenly put hospice. Nope, that's works.

It also triage decision either. No. Texas nowhere near point. I've actually near point. idea talking about. think governor may pissed someone something. feel bad service members trip home already planned. means thousands people fleeing south Florida to... Georgia Alabama guess intentionally boiling complicated subjects misleading headlines worse.

That's fair all. media prechew complicated matters layman's term public understand. read news article, read like academic paper. Also, journalist scientists, there's much resource media find someone decode scientific jargon.

edit: im trying say is, responsibility must official authorites knowledge speak unified, coherent, easy understand language. Especially pandemic, speaking technical jargon correct tone. want speak technical jardon, *public* setting. Media made misleading headlines message official authorities left room interpretation. mom amazing role model!!! I'm trying figure pre-covid economy supported both? Oh agree 100%. people resisting masks kids class messing everyone behaving. sucks us followed rules. Totally understand. caveat statements, yours. shouldn’t you’re coughing regardless whether mask not. 

Also use arm cover face even still mask on. Sweet jesus...

At least queues short Disney.. Thank joining us, going sign come back later today answer questions get to. -Stephanie 

Additional resources information: consider testing supplies quality/accuracy tests we’ll resources drawn people like flatten things, like tall things. Steepen curve baby. Tallest curve world. make curves like anymore. hope get Arthur Fleck'd. Every last one them. actually know, exactly performed?

Wanna bet wins reelection handily?

Maricopa county full fucktards. Home Arpaio. Need say more? Mother Nature I'm little torn. one hand, yes obviously need shut things cases subside.

On hand, shutting first place jack shit people fucking morons listen. There's reason think would second time.

So another shutdown needed, fear would pointless anyway. check TMC site again. looks like they're giving updates. numbers go commensurate people's level interaction other, it'll hit point dies infect people, it'll come back rapidly die out. I'd honestly surprised lasts end year. I'm guessing it'll peak end month start downward trend. can't believe pandemic become much pain ass...whole world struggling all, kill 1.35mm people year safe friend. worry everyone Texas, even don’t take seriously. dad going grocery shopping anywhere else may infect workers anytime soon? hes okay getting massage right really doubt it. 

Do understand viruses work? affecting affecting someone else, get exponential growth. know like viruses work. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 2 weeks? mean getting going He's going start senior year HS fall. held back Kindergarten 6 (the school brought up, agreed completely). going college, he's strong academically. He's also got poor muscle tone eliminates lot jobs would involve trade school. daughter graduates high school (a year him) plan move somewhere there's independent apartment (basement, garage, wherever) live independently. worst, learns important life skills, gets rent someone else lol. post high school program hope enrolls helps independent living skills, transports jobs affiliated community, etc. choice since he's 18 he's severe enough even pursue guardianship (there's lots legal shit something happens becomes ward state). want post school thing. social worker going encourage (and contemplating it) COVID hit 2 weeks later influence normally would been.

Last year went fair school kids disabilities also independent state funded places help things similarly post-high school thing (even residential programs). He's call grey area - severe enough know he'd living home forever plan accordingly. high functioning enough go college know he'll own. dad indulging luxury service getting coronavirus spreading god knows many people effects everyone great deal.  Next up: always war Eurasia Sincerely hoping case. Got put quarantine week due exposure someone tested positive work. wore mask. 
Of 5 came contact with, three also wearing masks. seeing Houston capacity, sure us burbs. spike? big compared official COVID deaths? assumes entire population risk positivity sampling distribution distinct subpopulations varying risk unchanged. problem testing capacity system approaches limit, testing diverted higher risk populations. increases percentage positivity even rapidly true weighted average, i.e., growth rate appears higher result fact proportion high risk individuals tested increasing, (just) virus spreading. shift towards testing higher risk populations occur purposely due public health directives spontaneously know higher risk make strenuous efforts obtain testing limited supply feel relatively safe bad,, even dangerous. Imagine 30% country know Covid. strong voice, going back normal/old way life, people best stop spread. Ahh, favorite childhood game. ""Fuck, Fuck, Oops"" never said he’s wrong I’m wrong either. like bumped supermarket. made big mistake thousands people dying mistake. never coming back that. 

for record wear masks indoors public-but Fauci canceled eyes. took 11 days exposure first symptoms. took 3 days really kick in. never sicker I'm decent health. testing much, isnt going go away ""magically"" it? Per Cases:

Florida: 10,109
California: 2,843

Total Tests:

Florida: 2,033,794
California: 4,338,718

Florida five times new cases half testing. . . Soon! Trump Flu beautiful numbers. Time learn community organizing taking power back. already bailing - matter life death -it time. course naturally self-flattening. understand herd immunity via mass infection? state spends ~$9000 per kid. One school worked didn’t enough desks students almost 40 students one class. school good reputation. also didn’t air conditioning worked city regularly hit 100+ degree days. Bathrooms regularly shut plumping old couldn’t afford maintain it. Oh, guess don’t need money basic needs. US, many ICU patients also managed non-ICU even non-medicine physicians. would ICU doctor overseeing everyone, daily care might neurologist pediatrician etc. anyone concerned Covid Act changed calculate Rt number states. It’s accounts jump Rt change status New York New Jersey. They’re still green across board categories. 

[You read blog post made changes need freak out. Yet. Asymptomatic people high enough viral loads infect others yet show signs disease. means viral load directly correlated symptom severity. Yeah, it’s interesting care population density sudden. I’d add total population list. 

You kept talking per capita measurements, ignoring population. I’m arguing it’s relevant talking exponential growth targeting population dense places. US Florida world. also..

C. Deaths lag new cases several weeks. So... 8.8% incarcerated private prisons = private prisons? Can’t move goal posts quick, gotta turn heat slowly fog doesn’t jump out.


Anyway I’m done discussion. I’m tired arguing citizens Make Believe. Cheers! Lmao not. least anymore baseline risk. thing happen trash article click bait title. Thanks contributing. Journalim 2020. They’re gonna find funny there’s college football season. New cases mean nothing effects aren’t noticeable. hospitalization rate, death rate? Fantastic. hospitals overcapacity now, correct? Texans heard one coworkers shit. God damned time! always wear mask help still 78% chance catching wear mask. I've actually wondering worldwide US case count numbers continue rise, death count continues fall. 

Even they're catching cases they're testing people, mean death rate fall? . mean, would cause percentage people virus dying fall, deadly cases would get balanced ton mild cases, *absolute numbers* people dying virus falling? 

Is took easy targets quickly? seems unlikely, really gotten everywhere yet. actually virus much much something thine before?

Fed edit, clarify, say death rate, mean percentage people virus died. mean numbers people die every day disaster. Period. Trump incompetent regarding this. GOP unwilling what's needed. countries issues. Why? goddamn GOP party believes science real. bullshit need happen. Hell frozen look ""leadership"" US compare real idiots Florida: death fantasy meet. multi-faceted problem. However would wager parent grandparent willing social distance relatives risk contract spread it, position authority parent underage teenager household opportunity prevent teen going pandemic something stupid, didn't, probably believe dangers virus anyways. We’re best sad geriatrics vying presidency, young blood? America screaming someone fresh ideas common sense rule. Source? u/JannesFAP says, claim see here, 12% deathrate insane doubt could hidden.

I likely (ditto kid) time tested risk patients ICU patients, way taking lightly all. think insane ask attendance, nonetheless spike NYC seeking answers that, lack outbreaks elsewhere, factors mentioned cited. think NY excellent job, given pretty much continually blocked. Texas lower population density, ""catch up"", doubt. know parameters China's outdoor study, conclusion, seems supported protest experience, hard get infected outside. would assume little came protests based research done far topic.  ...how still understand works? There's one Japan put transmission 19x less outside inside, take gospel. There's many components outdoor transmission like temperature, humidity, wind, mask usage, length time together, etc. would change risk vs. similar indoor exposure.  states did. Gotta give ‘em credit. issue lack unified response.

I mean, really. Even states lockdowns carved massive niches workers, stop travel land, sea, air state.

In fact, states started restricting/quarantining travelers states month.

If 50% states locking down, still allowed travel state states, locked either.

That said, unified response would made easier USA never, ever history unified response anything. long taking ventilator away deserving patient... administration come said “everyone wear mask, it’s patriotic thing do, let’s beat together”, boom, done. Nope. become political issue. I’ve see posts people saying “I served desert getting shot country, can’t wear mask shop?” Shows level “I don’t give shit anyone me” country reached.  Denmark example wants text messages, pictures proof former travel together etc actually verify particular relationship. need passports aswell. fill declaration form get prooven guilty lying relationship get sentenced 6 months prison bright side,the susceptible demographic one's vote people botching response. like child Corona go. wish redditors would stop saying every time brought up. True not, really point Fauci trying make seems like something adds nothing discussion Remember presidents used somewhat civil? Pepperidge farm remembers 'Good News'. Indeed.

You add -5 every 1d4 roll. 100%. course assholes bored people rearing reopen homeless. looks like deaths increasing third rate initial infection. data far sparse unreliable really say though. Another week data we'll better idea death toll. keep reopening things because...? don’t know break you, it’s politics everyone. works works anything works save thousands lives. cynical cruel assholes think it’s wanting drug fail. work hell yes send shit everywhere let’s get going treating people. overwhelming evidence shows doesn’t work, shows dangers promoting something it’s scientifically proven, guys look like bunch bootlickers trying help Trump save face. understand restaurants would pay waitstaff 25% capacity. bring chefs pay wait staff deliver. People love ordering food delivered safe. interested hard numbers, according tracker NYT maintains tracks CovID-19 positive cases deaths, we're currently sitting ~159,000 positive cases ~3,549 deaths. 

Which means average, 1 every 135 people symptoms severe enough tested tested positive, one every 6,052 people died them. remember select counties skew numbers significantly. example, county 1 every 453 people it, 1 every ~35,000 died. Preventing wearers touching face help starters. Universal already open... saw commercial it... thanks Florida 1 calculator x\^y key. Wow Yes, peer review needed.

Not taking steps prevent aiding abetting that. 'non violent' far causing pain time transferring disease, cause harm. 

We're asked use phone, internet, keep bit space others stay touch prevent harm others. I’m aware that. That’s exactly point. organs already failing, allow euthanasia instead slow death time. Chris Cuomo video mocking Florida governor best thing watched yesterday thought nba using Disneyworld? God.... watched bundesliga end Saturday POOF!

I know ppl want associate corona increases something support, common fucking sense here. timing fits. Give time. beat anything. Bottom line know countries/states/areas slowed fire. schmuck also tweeted anti-mask message day. Thoughts prayers! Yeah me. rules pretty much going inside anywhere. let daughter play date outside masks social distancing.  looks like how? get 30+% ""gods breathing system types?"" grim reaper trolling beaches sorry hear this. Unfortunately, I'm afraid going get personal people really wake take seriously. Seeing someone ventilator tough... ...

This article idiots dont wear masks hang friends Congratulations, you’re proving articles point. going win much we'll tired winning 
😭 shatters records. man language. can't get it. local school districts, county parks YMCA locations subsidized summer care pay sliding scale based income. Kids crafts, games, swimming, playground time, field trips zoo, etc. paid $200/week lot less low income folks.

ETA- I'm sure folks *this year* since closed due covid. concert moved outdoor street venue Miami - somewhere A1A beachfront Avenue. countries least people wearing masks without feeling like civil rights torn apart. also don’t fuck around. NJ *one* day packed bars governor immediately came roll everything back blamed “Knuckleheads”. you’ve got people Rock County NY trying dodge contact tracers, NY came said “lol ok, $2k fine day everytime dodge them”. 

It’s stern difference states you’re seeing south refuse take stance this. makes huge difference yes, population takes seriously things like masks well. friend worked decade talent side, told us couple days ago friend tested positive full day training basically character actors DW.... Oh, okay. alright excuse savaging people price progress. say pay price. Musk bright boy future. need debase appease him. Ethics matter. Even Mars.  Florida never left Ok, saying California increase cases, true, saying states increase cases also protests, also true, willful ignorance? And, proven wrong got condescending? Part intelligent person able tell lied authorities. Brilliant. *know* dipshits gonna like “Wooo record ya! Life meme rn!” root ""cancel culture"". Also partisan politics.

People perfect, nothing attitude toward anyone makes mistake means going eventually find everyone flawed.

What matters whether someone makes mistake, deal happens afterward.

In Fauci's case, he's done enough prove worth.

So stop dealing absolutes. wait people homeless. beginning. Darwin awards going need build new wing Trumpsucker Hall Fame. Nope that's works. 

Sorry, actually informed people here. wonder many forget masks occasionally.

One thing think I'm going forget something hang door handle. put masks there, I'm so. USA! 🇱🇷🇱🇷🇱🇷

I get blur total confirmed/deaths/recovered? realize high death come **after** 50k infections day right? fuck dense? seven days that....TWO BILLION! isn’t exponential growth.
It’s linear

y=2x different country would say probably happen know case Canada, don’t keep US theme park opening news I’m uninformed guess?

I can’t believe open point time situation there. don’t know people okay that. “Grandma ventilator least little Kayleigh got see Donald Duck”. It’s unbelievable. Elections consequences. Florida man (insert absolutely insane true headline) Cause can! think read 1 3 figure based SARS survivors. Given mortality far lower disease, reason true long term effects No, cannot apply specific scientific study another situation. science works. ""...from window"" get nicer mask. got one Chrome Industries love it. It’s way comfortable small tight face surgical masks n95s. also larger average head.

Masks stay, might well invest good one. USA! USA! time, masks available ones needed medical personnel. Now, plenty options, there's reason wear one unless stupid learn how. population density support increase? I'm American NYC extremely dense compared this? Might totally apples apples comparison? Either way, good. They’re limiting capacity like 20% likely. I’m Kansas City Missouri hardly anyone wearing mask prior mandating Monday. went Walmart Monday everyone one. even saw turn people away without mask(with said didn’t get turned away)! hopefully Kansas side! How’s hospitalizations total deaths ? Yes, that's everyone needs take virus seriously. Unfortunately politicized heavily one trusts information scientists anymore... Duplicate post

See original: Really glad work traveling damn state right now. actually pretty interesting seeing stark contrast seriously people taking home city Chicago compared here. I’m charge shit, is, he’s accomplished nothing 
And love him. 

Oh well NBA. In-game related worker. Tech stuff Especially frequent /r/politics. good bad. Good reduces covid spread. Bad many universities gonna thing announce person classes, people enroll pay classes, university say month later “health safety important us classes fall semester held online” people paid classes can’t get money back announced late. It’s scummy. Bloody EEEEDIOTS Even covid I've always much happier job get timetable straight:    
• Feb 29: Surgeon General Adams says masks ""are effective"".   
• Mar 08: Dr. Fauci 60 Mins says ""... reason anyone walking mask on.     
• Mar 18: Pres. Trump issues Executive Order PPE would ""properly distributed Nation’s healthcare system others need time.""     

Which wondering ─ time lied masks, another option available, namely use power government see PPE went health care people. option available Mar 18th, certainly available Feb 29th. decided lie, I'm wondering whether option issue EO direct PPE health care people discussed rejected.  hearings fiasco. might one option here.

EO Mar 18: Essentially, way, are. think NBA reopening also deals making sure athletes getting paid. Sure superstars getting hundreds millions dollars regardless, bench guys fringe players in-and-out league league minimum contracts absolutely dependent earning feed support often poor impoverished extended family. guys usually never get consistent contracts often need 5ish years get league set families years stability. top that, remember reading r/nba somewhere cancelling season could HUGE implications much money players gonna get future due making TV deal null void (correct I'm wrong though), possibly leading lockout owners finessing players union revenue cut. 

I'm 100% still train completely canceling NBA season together, even means beloved Lakers get chance compete title. I'd say learning plight players truly need play earn living, I'm willing see ""bubble"" structure they've designed implemented prevent spread COVID-19 work (I'll give 50/50 shot actually works). FIRST day lockdown, country gave me.... make sense.  Florida hot climate. /s Could expand manual QA is? 

i'm currently graphic designer/project manager whose job evolved project managing(trello/slack) contractor-programmer working companies website/backend testing bugs. take staff's request, test write exact issues logical format, explain programmer, help find solution explain solution staff. way transition technical role testing software/bug testing? job listings require scripting.. first steps take? hits 20k 7/7 game agree disagree. Time tell. believe leagues try, billionaires cant possibly survive without making billions, matter dies. dont see league making season, maybe exception NHL. hope I'm wrong. I'm huge sports fan forgetting crumbling country would nice 3 hour chunks. see reason optimistic now. screwed royally, window opportunity closing. Considering potus declared Coronavirus over, horrible ride. darker moments, seriously consider creating corporate entity buy property states managing Rona well. I'm sure number deaths result glut market depress prices I'd turn profit short term. American Exceptionalism working well either. That’s better. source poor. Cuomo announce yesterday anyone wants test get one. could explanation. Gotten passport. RIP Florida man I’m sorry hear that, sounds awful. Please stay safe. Yup. Meanwhile similar incident happen Iowa error taxes state wanted collect have. required one phone call nice helpful person state dept revenue got everything cleared hour. dealing IRS bit headache dealing Iowa dealt nice helpful people whose goal assist me. I'd take IRS (Hell I'd take dealing Comcast) dealing state New York day. Hockey work decided stay Canada. :/ landlord would discuss non-paying tenants going on, lost job high risk start job wouldn’t attempt evict situation chance pay. Keep mind it’s though. disagree you.

.. really see start second wave?  hell yeah I’d wear ninja turtle mask, made one made face look like TMNT buy it.

Edit: punctuation born south lived whole life. second that. try? give something they'll assume they're right. Suppose could that. I've seen articles saying good idea speak see science misrepresented may help someone else sees People even annoyed got recurring checks actually showed light neurological damage bro! check sub They’re already reservations. People couldn’t get losing shit can’t go Plague World. know things fucked Florida town make look stupid. exist. It’s one actually makes happy. Maybe hurricanes people stay fuck inside. want anything serious, give us like month heavy tropical storms help slow covid passing law requires people something prohibits carrying firearm, violating Second Amendment.

We plenty state federal laws prohibit people owning and/or carrying firearm situations. Many heavily litigated found constitutional. 2A give someone carte blanche right carry firearm. Also, rights suspended compelling enough reason, restrictions narrowly tailored fit said reason, government argue crisis restrictions meet strict scrutiny standard. Ok right one that's really looking like make Oxford one. shelling trillions oxford, make hundreds millions vaccines day, give many factories can, vaccine passes phase 3 instantly start vaccinating everyone. AEW still making crowd wear masks reports antibody tests weeks. thats fear isnt it? employer might make catch virus 

man pisses know, lol, least people wear masks. :/ town drive testing back April anymore. Yeah bc know idiot passed naked male hooker best choice. That’s COVID-19 steel chair! think main goal contact tracing limit spread, much figure got it. 

So, main question contact since date X? 

Then tracer contact people warn they’ve exposed. Yikes 😬

Fortunately majority Americans disagree think they’re saying long there’s vaccine, signs one, we’ve exhausted every option, we’re going accept risk rather lock permanently. give right now. know people social distance/wear masks comes turkey dressing ham presents.

Somewhat true there. usually wear pants.  complain you, could distinction presymptomatic asymptomatic patients? two carrier groups essentially one becomes symptomatic. Even knew carriers, can’t really go back time someone symptomatic tell wearing mask. die cold.. cares Corona. Lol  Sunshine, heat, windows doors open, outside tables. UK? rain, cold, indoors shouting... huge wrestling nerd find funny owner company thinks virus fake. 


.....I mean pre-determined Yeah yeah probably give that. It’s fucked way.  Mexico paid wall keep Americans sick COVID. America really worst response covid-19 world. long testing became widespread? impact lockdown? SHUT DOWN!! Dont surprised local politicians suddenly start investing funeral homes lol. sure, that’s pretty orders go. COVID police making sure wear masks everywhere, washing hands staying 6 feet apart. local areas may stricter, put extra pressure business others, mass enforcement this. would probably make worse start locking people. 

But appear pockets areas take seriously others. guess comes much pain medically vs financially family experienced far enjoy walking arent gonna get good feels researching car companies Well perverted sense ""freedom"" 100+ thousand Americans dead cases steadily rising across countries. Congratulations free actively participate spreading deadly virus need eat restaurants get hair cut. Meanwhile engage anti-science freedumb debates, large portion world emerging lockdowns. cases declining experiencing true freedom go lives. Seems like listening scientists whose life work studying infectious diseases might advantageous pandemic. Lockdown today?

You mean cancel high-minded *my body choice* anti-mask protests? “You gotta pump numbers up. rookie numbers” - Donald Trump probably density problem. majority cases specific neighborhoods underserved healthcare. Reuters news service. alternate sources pay subscription fee Reuters access &amp; re-publish. get paid regardless. seen contract myself, I'd surprised also get portion generated ad revenue media subscribers. based layman impression, seems like no-brainer easy money invest stock caskets, tombstones, embalming companies, 

In general stocks - thought - late people smarter thought pumped price. might make bit money though... many deaths reported recently? sign people immune dying ? curious. doubt would ever 100% compliance, allowing people survive couple months without work forcing certain business remain shuttered would considerably reduced ability disease spread.

The major uptick right direct result rushed reopening businesses - especially high risk, non essential business like dine-in restaurants, bars, clubs, like. Many major vectors going staff choice return work longer receive unemployment (if lucky enough get first place).

If working class supported via no-questions-asked payment three (much like happened Canada), small business relief wasn’t plundered large corporations, risk spread would reduced significantly - even 100% people complying lockdown. 

When options less, non compliant going spread more, risk infection large crowds gathering indoors going significantly reduced. Congrats! jackass- realize people families. saying try protect people Atleast everyone knows NBA's almighty moral stances purely show, theyl still play Florida dollar tells too. Let's kid ourselves. Probably closer 20k beat attest rogue waves - still nightmares years knockdown sea rogue wave. many lahks laksa dispute findings it’s clear whether people become infected newer variation pathogen fare worse original strain, said.

Per Fauci clear yet. Give another month. Wow. I'm even sure say anymore. 10,000 new cases single day, too. going disappear though Death rate rising. dont think people realize big Florida is... boasted long ago Florida better shape Nope. low less 1% death rate

I understand people.

Would agree play game win 100 bucks 1% chance death?

How 1000 bucks? 5000 bucks?

Most people would say ""no"".

And yet virus like game, positive outcome. Also, long circulating every region community, eventually get it.

It's last part annoys western governments. care eventually everyone get it. highly communicable disease cannot stopped. 

I thought point lockdown slow spread/flatten curve. matter time infected. Military personnel cannot leave 50 mile radius assigned duty station without approval first 2 star general chain command. requires official Red Cross notification dying family member approved. headline underselling DoD restrictions. Doubtful Reuters primary source. definitely going around calling hospitals numbers new cases. took data government agency compiled wrote blurb it. 

Reddit weird fucking hardon “original content” absolutely original. government agency compiled data getting credit, Reuters.

Reuters getting credit honest. That’s it. Definitely don’t get give props first report someone else’s data. said weeks ago downvoted. “It’s tourists fault” told. Ha!  Try explaining exponential growth Trump, guaranteed never understand it. Federal pressure speed reopening faster plan was. Also, California monolithically blue. crazy much goalposts moved metrics changed.

In San Diego here, went ""3 community outbreaks week= preventative measures /closing things again"" ""7 week"" 8...

""7 week means reevaluate plan""

Nothing change


And also despite CA ""blue,"" counties necessarily. San Diego, board supervisors making decisions 4 red blue (apparently auto moderator deletes comments party names)


Lastly, California necessarily liberal. entirety central California everything east Sierra Nevada mountains red territory First all, whole thing 1 year process. Second all, deaths extremely low. 60 million people infected, 12,000 died. True, 12,000 people still lot, still kinda low compared cases.
People quarantined like now. everything went back normal completely masks social distancing laws cant imagine high deaths cases would be. would insanity. Quit anecdotes. supporters Reddit respond every then, naturally go read comments. thoroughly believe fantastic job go history one greatest presidents. 👍 Except number tests really increased hasnt happened though. youre assuming. Good thing confident numbers accurate say are. Usually work something open source side 6 months(not full time) read 2-3 weeks testing process go apply jobs.

BTW, hopefully still since days everyone trying move automated/code-based testing.

But still ton people work manual testers since possible automate everything easily. cute really feel biggest problem shutdowns handled local level instead state level. Federal, state, local governments worked together set thresholds closing area. 

For instance, county 17 reported cases general population, 8 cases currently active. showing states charts 60 something May prison. lockdown around could started virus started flaring area instead state shutdown based hotspots far removed county.

Remember point shutdown flatten curve, pause it. area, everything stopped virus got never curve. However, everything opening back based state federal government, start seeing curve unfortunately, think people follow shutdown orders curve high. many factors seems sometimes matter luck (or lack thereof.) poorly understood inconsistent secondary-long term complications serious issue.

I arterial plaque rupture 27 caused 99% blockage main cardiac artery, flatlined. cardiac arteries crystal clear. Vegetarian, drug use, non-diabetic, congenital issues, vacation time; standout obesity (\~31BMI), family history heart disease old age, recent air travel.

Doctors still don’t know caused it, 1:1M thing. permanently disabled, advanced CHF, chronic chest pain. 

To best doctors knowledge, relatively minor thing caused nothing particularly noteworthy snowballed span week first symptoms atypical fatigue chest discomfort.

I’m frustrated people, particularly youth, taking risks it. Going working, picking grad school, travel relatively good heath fixed income able handle stairs *sucks*, odds survived initial attack.

The difference micrometers ultimately gets lodged separates fatal benign result, add something known introduce/cause/contribute risks. Please stop favouring lax restrictions mask wearing, easiest simplest preventative measure have. Never underestimate people's capacity stupidity. people moderately easily preventable diseases less likely follow science-based medical advice? Cuomo nothing proud of. Look numbers/100k. think are? company would rather government mandate, think helps insurance costs might incur *chose* stay closed. USA USA USA What’s going Florida? live villages 55+ community. hour Florida. work restaurant, young healthy guy. worried? Good job New Mexican, I’m glad are. I’ve work quarantine near 4 months yes, it’s tiring I’d rather suck stay indoors slowly lowers state. also, since clearly don’t pay much attention, lifted lock restrictions long ago numbers climbed, we’re locking that. restrictions helping. rights... also responsibilities uphold rights others.. put responsibilities back burner neglect others rights.. youre problem. logic? Okay. 
 
I know truth weird right now. true. Everyone knows people bastard coated bastards bastard filling Australia whole 100 new cases per day really think relates “Come on! Put big numbers like rest us lockdown!” like morons walking around Walmart without masks big groups. going crowded restaurants bars. Americans treating like cases they’ve successful COVID-19. Also surprise it’s Florida breaks record one else wants break. administered 10,000 tests single day. So......how’s mortality rate doing? Much lower, suspect. Absolutely. really important point. Roll Tide heard stable source number cases would drop slowed testing. Welcome party RI VT, please rejoin us soon NY NJ :(  Parties protests dude I’m right wing like Trump not/will vote him. lagmonsterr isn’t wrong. It’s nearly deadly contagious people trying make be. RemindMe! 5 weeks ""How many daily COVID-19 deaths Florida?"" would Disney pay testing? Disney staff want tests, can't get one government? Come right way sir, need strong thinkers like White House pandemic council Dude Tourism. Everyday canceled 4th July tourists pouring town. Maybe 1 every ten families least single member mask. deliver pizzas I'm constantly delivering hotels tourists stay at. one follows social distancing, one cares covid. Tell parents scientists working fix problem... day like 50 CT. evidence claim  everyone stays home, nobody (else) gets it. Hell ya Florida keep up! encephalopathy? Fuck eating? reply?

What happened? logic destroy meritless arguments?  accordong liberal papers librards reddit elsewhere 8s far safer outside inside. way libtards defended BLM protests. graphs covid stats, we're going see daily death toll start rise seriously 2 weeks, keep rising. least weeks case rate starts falling again. Let's tippery parade! It’s pretty simple. ALWAYS wear masks indoors, it’s law. also test aggressively new cases found order circle cluster. People aware avoid unnecessary contacts strangers  Except money think figures probably correct apply need medical attention get it. health system overwhelmed mortality rate increase, perhaps substantially. exact scenario lockdowns intended avoid. Curious you’re asking strikes local city county officials capable implementing shut downs also opting to. wouldn’t DeSantis’ party affiliation, would it? would bring close though. soon open back up, there's virus again, waiting infect people yet. zero guarantee effective vaccine point. Lockdowns costly effective long term. need real leadership help us work long haul get herd immunity without overwhelming healthcare system. That's scenario point thing actually ends. Looking study, basically meta-analysis based studies done around world. 

But what's weird studies huge, huge differences ICU death rates, even similar places similar times. 

And can't tell took account things like ICU's getting overrun, different criteria admit, etc.  American public dumb avoid getting covid. Shut everything again! state went viral ridiculous arguments wearing masks? Well according article **you** posted CDC counts *seasonal flu* deaths *flu season* runs *October May*... May reset count start counting *October May* understand **seasonal flu** affecting Americans *flu season*. 

I know clear friend. count seasonal flu deaths flu season. reset every October otherwise ""flu season"" numbers mean anything. consistent flu season compare year year.

Does make sense?? isn’t single word reply that’s true Honestly think state income tax would really save either. Medical Police! Partying not. isolate, recover, get back it.... cancel professional league seasons then?? 

I want optimistic... seasons gonna finish. Guaranteed... virus isn’t going “take break” happy get sports back. live Harris County always wear mask well. Yet others stores enforce still people try cover mouth 😐   know realizes bad fucked complete 360 like this. Yup. Last week neighbor behind house large gathering people over. least 30 adults children. say anything want ""that neighbor"", happens again, fuck it. I'm saying something. Sorry, seeing crazy rise deaths u want see. feelings 100% changed. We're putting money saved daycare summer towards private kindergarten fall. 

yay many states statewide mask mandates? Hospitals make money patients generally, Covid isn’t profitable. Regardless, sure what’s wrong “doing everything power report many cases possible”...since that’s hospitals disease.  know China did. tell long took China implement measures first infection? many deaths reported prior draconian lockdown?

**China**

“Dec. 10: Wei Guixian, one earliest known coronavirus patients, starts feeling ill.

Jan. 23: Wuhan three cities put lockdown. Right around time, approximately 5 million people leave city without screened illness.

Jan. 24–30: China celebrates Lunar New Year holiday. Hundreds millions people transit around country visit relatives.

Jan. 24: China extends lockdown cover 36 million people starts rapidly build new hospital Wuhan. point, strict measures continue implemented around country rest epidemic.

The bottom line: China trying create narrative example handle crisis fact early actions led virus spreading around globe.”

**Total deaths reported China lockdown: 25**

**Days lockdown: 45**

**Deaths/day lockdown: 0.56**



**Italy**

“The virus first confirmed spread Italy 31 January 2020, two Chinese tourists Rome tested positive virus.

On 9 March 2020, government Italy Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte imposed national quarantine, restricting movement population except necessity, work, health circumstances, response growing pandemic COVID-19 country.”

**Total deaths reported Italy lockdown: 463**

**Days lockdown: 39**

**Deaths/day lockdown: 11.9**

TLDR:
China implemented lockdowns slower yet 5.4% deaths Italy prior respective lockdowns. think underestimate power confirmation bias wishful thinking. Humans astounding ability talk believing whatever want believe.

That said, man known better given life-or-death stakes. He's 100% responsible killing friend hope haunts rest miserable life. took 3 days daughter get rapid test 8 days results. beginning June, even want know like now. Tropicana field closed 8am due capacity supplies. People lining hours FL, Az &amp; TX turned away due tests. shit show Alabama kids thought would funny Covid parties. 1st get sick wins pot.... Welcome America, give shit you, me... I’m really curious opinion Baker? I’m sarcastic like hearing viewpoints ever Disney World/Universal summer? Everywhere crowd, practically Times Square levels crowded. Arguably shows less crowded there's constant distance everyone form seating. Even 80k infections day Florida’s ~21 million people... that’s 262 days number could sustained, know won’t be, continue climb. remember reports start whole thing saying masks aren’t effective way fighting spread. Australia, outbreak areas start opening up, fear implement mandatory mask wearing public, cases increase again. getting bombed way party say “Gee, idea bombs falling. would know, would stayed inside. could seen coming?!?!”  wish could refuse job still employed. Sounds like done excellent job raising him. Best luck, hope figures works best him. :) Brian Kemp watching?   definitely see states shutting next week, know, holiday weekend. Cause covid apparently takes holiday well. True, 2016 46% voters chose this. 46% supporting group racist, science-doubting, hateful fraudsters embarrassment country. Unfortunately, that's works. Mortality rate go number new cases peaks, increase again.

This deaths lag behind new cases, long new cases still exponential phase growth, outpace death rate. new daily cases hits peak begins slow down, start see mortality rate increase still continue grow exponentially several weeks number new daily cases gradually plateaus.

When New York seeing 10,000 daily cases, mortality rate 2.5%. number new cases began go down, mortality rate started increase, 6%. same? Well coronaviruses positive sense RNA genome don’t need anything transcribed. need ribosome start translating genome, assume contains RNA polymerase replicate genome. guess focused whether would even possible red blood cells start making filopodia since can’t make new transcripts get process going. 

And feel like need read red blood cells I’m really familiar, given there’s genome transcribe, doubt would large RNA nucleotide pool available would imagine even RNA virus would hard time replicating RDRP wouldn’t anything make genome copies with. guess go read red blood cells viruses 😅  lmao grandparents live alabama. somehow r straight rn. Nothing screwed yet god forbid Please use full name, Rona DeSantis.  That’s awful. hope family able support recovery process. 

My friend’s husband decided would die go second lung transplant 2 years ago. 😢 It’s sick. They’re telling us report, resign, retire take unpaid leave. issue death rate substantially dropped level infections.

This also easily explained known fact tests limited height outbreak, “official” cases serious ones. federal government LIED American people. leaders DC got trusted medical institutions medical professionals LIE American people worst global pandemic 100 years. kicker save money. Hospitals shortage masks DC concerned resellers would buy available supply. Leaders DC worried hospitals would charged resellers LIED us. 

Now get deal fallout virus spreads uncontrollably. pain suffering hospitals, industry thrives charging patients, wouldn’t pay higher price budgeted masks. added doctors say Cordero's lungs like ""swiss cheese."" Jesus Christ. need one? thought Disney forced everyone business sign contract binding private arbitration. don’t really think there’s historical example following conditions: huge anti-science movement= anti-masks, misinformation social media, extremely weak federal leadership, defunding cdc, happening pandemic. keep asking historical example unprecedented time humanity right now. know US supposed one best responses covid? federal government could avoided economic collapse delaying rent payments implementing UBI. Instead “mostly” everyone got one time stimulus check told us fuck off. It’s late fix problem US; way people learn lot COVID deaths people take seriously. worst response covid soon see consequences economy hundreds thousands millions dead government continues let citizens fend themselves. Whiny Fat Boomers thinking right choose whether spread deadly disease amongst fellow Americans American thing UnAmerican thing Ive ever seen.  Flint's water perfectly fine long time now. Thanks outing ignorant teenager Russian bot.

Keep spreading fake news, Ivan!  Scary happy spread people, selfish, entitled, trash. doubled tests halved positive percentage would point that's even close happened. good place look death rate? Zero sympathy, sorry. information chose ignore it. lack governing, president preoccupied treason busy committing letting pal Putin murder soldiers. morse's law attributed food, honestly. disney puts great restaurants even quick service food beyond typical hamburgers/chicken tenders amusement park fare. disney vacation, end walking around 6-8 miles day, enjoying attractions, get excuse gluttonous. 

but i’d say that’s small set. another reason pure escapism (at WDW truly bubble walt intended). also see rabid middle-aged crowd insist best vacations “know” plan disney, holding others. sometimes think it’s it’s something use needed others (“you’ve disney many times, recommend?”). also they're simply testing people now? know case Sweden - started testing LOT before, obviously made ""confirmed cases"" sections look like everything control time deaths patients intensive care kept decreasing still do. 10,000 new cases week again. great, terrible.

Anatoly, go look core, er, COVID wing. Rapture main lessons communication someone ""misinterprets"" saying, saying mean clearly enough people understand meaning.

The difference meant exactly wrote, added nonexistent information top that. info needed convey message - overinterpreted it. case joined bandwagon translation article questioned said ""poor translations question quality"" implying support accusation, defense person making accusation.

In case also started comment statement regards OP's response criticism. gave context comment differentiate it, yet ignored due personal values joined conversation. That's little lesson field decision making. join group people again, offering support comments attacking targets ire, look like one them.

Hello, hammer. less aggressive approach might help spot differences. Florida reported 10k today. hate state. Member Fauci projected 100K new cases day US based way we're currently going? Guess talking Florida administration actively pointing exact wrong direction, right cliff untimely demise. remember, Matt Gaetz wore gas mask mock initial response COVID cases. like ohh think 10,000 high? Well hold beer Universities (FSU others) announcing can't also care child working home. devastating small families. supposed kid? Take daycare potentially infected kids? Lose job? get wrong, think baseball best chance major sports long-term reopening reasons listed. would guarantee see players missing games due infection season progresses. Whether choose continue anyone's guess.


Hockey looks like going stick Canada smart choice also contact heavy sport. prediction playoffs start never finish. Another news flash. Okay, per capita us 30 000 deaths behind Sweden. you’re saying us 18.75 % better Sweden. clear? Nahhhhhh. Never would guessed people going drinking partying ignoring distancing advice would cause spike. Gee ya don’t say. /s Also, people dining need lot attention (refills, check ups, cleanup after, etc) higher overhead. Takeout transactions take seconds done right.

This pandemic going boon many companies adapt quickly execute well, going push many others business can't.    undoubtedly people hold us back (and currently holding us back) curtailment mankind's contributions climate change. people shouldn’t rioting pandemic. Florida Yeah, get it. I'm close comfortable, far first released it. Kids need another 4-6 years point we'll solid generation info (but I'm blessed fact need yet) Summer slow Wait whut? portion population thinks virus hoax refuses comply public health guidelines? people caused massive spread? like massive spike concentrated states one would expect behavior. one could predicted this!

For instance, report deaths, report ages died?

Have done stories nursing homes?

Have done stories elderly protected?

When report infections, report ages provided state testing positive?

When report hospitalizations, make distinct ingredients patients tested positive Covid, actually treated Covid?

When report ICU usage, incorporate information above, along usual ICU occupancy, percentage beds provided actually treated Covid?

How addressed mental health aspect virus, subsequent lockdowns?

How choose sources include reporting? (Ie medical studies statements) Annual *seasonal flu* deaths. Holy shit. Dude comment wrote article cited!!

Also former student athlete, sympathize shit ton athletes general. What's NFL make sure guys still getting paid? I'm updated NFL contracts IIRC money guaranteed like NBA contracts right? Nope.

They spent hours arguing whether article poorly translated one even made vague attempt demonstrate was.

They plenty time show example mistranslation changed meaning article, so. Instead chose demand OP take comment supporting evidence claims, argue support claims.

No one asked translate OP's posts. mean.. long direct deposit I'll take one cent lol Haha. That's really point time. We're testing more, they're mostly asymptomatic people living someone showing symptoms that's tested they're contact tracking testing people they're likely asymptomatic. I'm pretty confident director film could handle pandemic response better local national leaders. eerily point. much engaged game ""pandemic bingo"" - yes, every trope plot point film fully played out, time first saw late February. fact, truth turning stranger fiction (except village kidnapping plotline, course) I'm sure follow reasoning there. good reason believe representative sample, we? 10% population tested there's 2.5/6 million cases.. would assume theres 25 million + people infected Asymptomatic not.

People willing wear masks stay home we're going roll see happens. really see stay-home orders enacted. 


It's going get bad. Hell, bad going get whole lot worse gets better. hope virus may less lethal previously thought deaths minimal.  almost like wanted assure one group succeeded group failed know either. go two grandparents. absolutely suffer last days. even heard say wanted something eat.

I’m leaving negative test  Well little complicated. we're testing people elevated risk exposure, (#of positive / total cases) going larger proportion nation. CASES mean damn thing, metric used create media hype, causes people go get tested, causes cases, creates media hype, causes people go get tested, causes... Yeah gotta go get man jabari tell quarantine right way smh dont understand got conclusion calling Americans stupid. still referring position wearing masks need evaluate thinking none us TRAINED wear masks. never stated Americans stupid, believes masks shouldnt mandated based almost nonexistent scientific evidence. Like stated, believes could increase infections stated reasons above. said dont understand masks could increase infection almost mocking way automatically assume calling Americans stupid, sound like projecting me. talking possible feeding fire (by mandating masks) still putting feelings emotions that. dont even agree masks shouldnt worn still knows says taken account.

By voting primaries, millenials younger ensured someone like Biden would win. Deaths still decline: useless metric since 1) based testing amount 2) measure severity. Yeah, compare resurgence LA metro Bay Area. heard happens coronavirus patient gets stung murderer hornet... Portillos street PACKED. Waited solid 25 minutes two beers yesterday.

And much avant-garde Tribeca Film Festival... caving Walmart, showing ""films"" parking lots. “new cases” drivel you’re currently propagating like charlatan liberal

Dude people insist making political issue? really stupid? guess interested rate new cases happening must be. 2 days ridiculous? lol

Edit Read wrong southern CA opened way early-- look numbers LA surrounding counties. opened indoor dining end May, bars opened late June.

Meanwhile, bay area counties (SF, Alameda, Contra Costa, San Mateo, Santa Clara, Marin) still largely shut (outdoor dining opened places week ago may get reversed) far better. Hope like new daily post. change numbers. might well start stickying damn things. Exactly! East coast, multiple kid, family trips school breaks (lounge, flights, etc., near peak prices). took family week past years various countries Europe staying air b&amp;b (relatively) affordable price compared typical trip florida, california, bahamas, etc., Maybe good place start then? honestly know. Yeah, like protecting nation threat security.

We know real threat security removal statues confederate generals. actually proven help, would current standard care. don’t, want it. 

I see viable way, probably isn’t happening. Atleast 16 weeks season isnt darwinism, young people wont die coronavirus, parents grandparents will. Half Americans ignore it. ignore government two different tests.  Look that, almost like exponential growth playing exactly like predicted! Well done Florida 👏 smashing new record high. guys I""m sure - phantom ICU beds keep adding. zero deaths county, think yes, did. Except that's happening. appears Summer, people better immunity and/or exposures involve lower viral loads Winter, hospitals becoming overwhelmed.

Rising cases matter [hospitalizations WHO’s updated timeline, posted online week, states officials first learned virus Dec. 31, 2019, information posted U.S. website doctors working Wuhan, virus first emerged. contradicts agency’s initial timeline, which said that China first presented information date

You follow link makes reference notification 2019.

What news site? Yeah, woman American, I’ve come realize word used rest word way frequently doesn’t weight give here. lands like grenade States lol like insanity. would think people would self preservation instinct kick ...... Explain reasoning behind it. wearing mask violate freedoms? Protecting majority high risk Americans bad thing you? !remindme 1 week crowding for-profit prisons they're guaranteed catch COVID? What's downside? That's Californians Floridians little self control. north east area seeing cases remain flat decrease. populated areas good wearing masks. tiny amount heard immunity helps. Agreed. Texas California alone get us now. Florida Arizona posted significant increases compared last Thursday.

We're going another day 50k cases too. one wants go back lockdown**.** 

No middle ground. *Because* \^. Wow personal attacks, deflection moving goal posts one post?

Are ok man? Something going personal life wording one headline article one particular subreddit post drives post nonsensical distractions real things happening right now? ""We're going back"" -DeInsanetis March, Smittskydd Stockholm played central role actively infecting people visited high-risk areas.

I think part might need second go translation, otherwise lot sinister expected.. I'm sorry deal that.  High infection rates lead overwhelmed hospitals.

If number infected people overwhelms hispitals lots people start dieing

Like people hospital right now: room would dead.

#IF EVERYONE RIGHT FIRST TIME COULD OPENING LIKE EU RIGHT FUCKING NO, IDIOTS DONT LIKE MASKS DOCTORS TV. joke, it’s important point. social media Australia people would plot exponential curves going forever, reality however bad situation, epidemic always follow epidemic curve kind. peaks well last person infected. 50% population aren’t going infect 50% final day outbreak. fact says dangerous good. might ultimately find study actually less pathogenic. would imagine faster spreads ultimately turn coding errors start build up. going make genetic error proof reading system able work around point. hopefully soon. I'll bet we're well beyond 100k cases/daily already. acceleration cases might actually good thing especially deaths spike result. Sounds weird, could good news. varies transplant team.

CA tests completely free, go insurance insurance co allowed charge it. death rate near 2 percent. going test capacity 1 million per day half assed lockdown, states opened early didn’t follow guidelines, much population made mask wearing political issue refuse wear them. Also federal government helping states contact tracing setting robust testing system failed do. saying we’re lockdown doesn’t actually slow virus. People businesses need listen take seriously local governments need open safely based numbers federal government needs help local governments. Yeah try dig user history assume I'm talking stranger street, interest trying talk people cult/religion, might start checking end wasting bunch time

It’s like claiming biking valid strategy getting work, although arrived late time, know would time hopped bike earlier. Bad situation, valid strategy, optimal situation. Implement strategy earlier next time. It’s exactly needed. Literally change election 2020. That’s many people going die.

Edit: typo median time [infection symptoms 5 [7 days symptoms That's 12 days total. Trump rally exactly 12 days ago. elite mastered use propaganda channels manipulate public. Every issue gets buried another one. Ever notice media headlines always exact thing? 80+% participation mask wearing nationwide Jesse Ventura mostly pretty decent guy though. Minnesotan governors authentic Minnesota accent Jesse Ventura. basically cannonical Minnesota accent. it’s equally impossible... that’s point. things done make schools safer, aren’t done. parents aren’t supportive don’t care. watch school board meetings. talk themselves. vast majority parents going drop kids head work places safer teachers “watching” kids, don’t care. FAR focus pooooor parents need childcare teacher asked sacrifice themselves.

As teacher, I’m opposed going back. WANT go back. almost safety measures put place protect people supposedly thing keeping society functioning (by way parents work, apparently). Anyone considered cases contaminated testing sites, false-positives due high rates testing positive? data related positive cases certain sites others? purely devils advocate nothing else.. Surprised took Georgia long Right, feel like headline pushing narrative world ending. 
I read headline got nothing even close it. 
So 'don't question narrative' turned 'the headline makes feel bad' really really fast. Texas governor lieutenant governor separately elected, that’s fact nothing say change Yeah, that's overstatement. means less mortality time develop cure vaccine, it. certain personas willing risk transmission suffering bored home miss pubs raves, choice. stay home means family safe asthmatic wife risk. That’s actually still problem. people weigh lives economy willingly let people starve become financially desperate feel need kill themselves. people starve one needs to? economy / capital decided worthy saved. always way became apparent. fuckin time Greg work hotels beach it’s busy crowded ever. course, haven’t seen single person (besides employees) wearing mask. Recent studies showing antibodies 6-12 weeks infection, 

So understanidng that's normal right? body producing anti-bodies past infections. Rather remembers gets new infection re-makes antibodies. You’re fucking kidding me. turd. hate idiot, whole time he’s preaching unnecessary masks are. Suck dick Abbott ya dumb fuck. Well EU long term means we'll continue banning people food. Yes, wear masks gloves go door to.

Work home can. people actually going die that. Incredibly heartbreaking quite right mathematically see point pretty accurate Sweden though. months ago thoughts Sweden:

""If Sweden stops 5,000 6,000 deaths, know they’ve reached herd immunity, didn’t need kind lockdown. feeling probably stop herd immunity. COVID serious, it’s least serious flu. it’s going destroy humanity people thought.""

Sweden currently ~5300 deaths essentially zero per day point, seemed pretty accurate.   experts said protesting racism important stopping spread virus? ones said masks work?  meh.  new york literally state see increase cases following protests.  obviously fuzziness protesting reopening.

police texas saw massive increase cases among worked protests. (albeit, know masked dudes were). 

my personal theory new york city essentially reached near herd immunity, especially data coming sweden showed 30% blood donors may covid-19 specific T-cells without antibodies. submission removed because

Arizonas Pos rate probably high all. Florida 16% right would save little time running batches 3. 102 people 34 batches. would average less 16 positive batches. Let's call 17 though. 34 initial tests. 17 retests 3x17 batches =51. 51+34=85. Less 102.

It seems gaining traction. fear much harder close keep things closed like NYC. even local news ran stories close around here, getting there. hope late. Cuomo seem fuck around good. Hard call Harvey hoax. Like somebody trying reach brain nostril. likely adult child transmission child child. /s

There u go fixed you. talking about? one shut hospitals. things saw put non-critical elective surgeries.

What policy decisions resulted shutting healthcare? anyone said anything going hospital need it? 

It seems like people making decision seek treatment. understand why, virus scary hospitals place want end especially pandemic. one forcing people go. give 14 days I'm downstate Illinois go out, vast majority wearing masks. older ones see wearing wrong, nose even chin. Wolf embarrassment wannabe tyrant. I'm horrified he's home state. I'm one think this. There's reason approval rating dropped 65% 45%. Awwww! new generation morons coming age prepare follow footsteps elders...

Brings tear eye thinking it... Indoors vs outdoors

Mask vs mask bad. missed that. [FLORIDA CORONAVIRUS CASES RISE 10,109 169,106 TOTAL THURSDAY, BIGGEST DAILY INCREASE SINCE PANDEMIC STARTED - REUTERS  Same, yeet sun already. It’ll like ten minute concert. 

Doesn’t have, like, two hits? honey mustard sandwich? Cause I'm interested. 👍🏼 wife healthcare 2 children (4 7). borrow older nephew watch work. parents immunocompromised cant dead. really important people able jobs saying change careers work. i'd start ""unfriend"" button, short that, avoid couple weeks till know whether sick you’re spending 8 hours class together, you’re exchanging droplets, masks masks. testing tracing adequate levels confident 20-30 people gather room without causing unmanageable outbreak. don’t see point attempting worst-of-all-worlds suggestions. Unless one part-time devoting evening hours work well (which tell experience sustainable), math add up. Even split shifts, people getting 8-9 hours day focused work time possible unless literally work, sleep, watch kid.

FYI, gets harder kids get older, stop napping, need homeschooled, etc. read article, know party attendees refusing acknowledge party. They're taking fifth refusing incriminate themselves. still understand get preschoolers wear mask day, short stapling faces. think hit everyone buy breathing room couple months herd immunity.... would looooot dead people.

There plenty recent articles discussing long term effects getting virus. One common long term effects chronic fatigue. Thats going send productivity way put lot people effectively disabled category. everyone get virus, lead unimaginable chaos level dystopian tales rarely touched.  people hired back businesses hoping similar traffic compared shutdowns. initial surge bars restaurants coming we’ll see new wave layoffs happening businesses adjust. places shutting latem virus spreading like wildfire aint seen nothing yet. 2 weeks even worse likes texas. hopefully silver lining debacle Swedes generally become bit humble... 

For me, outside corona situation improving, would lead biggest increase quality life personally Sweden.

And critical am, great Swedish friends, bit much pride naturally, remain lots great Swedes there, level pride veers towards propaganda-tier me. seem quite familiar situation here, maybe noticed Swedish media equally arrogant people. went birthday party. Oh, I'm sorry. thought America! Hahaha Plano? Living Alabama, still seeing large number state vehicles heading Florida beaches. seeing lot stories duration summer. people much better fighting infections. I've diagnosed pneumonia three different years never spent 3 days bed going back work. know plenty people 2-3 weeks it. I'll give response. definitely places many guidelines restrictions, even cases rising. Masks something every American wears vaccine found. CDC set guidelines, states used starting point well.

Places higher population density definitely stricter guidelines, mean places without density any. takes one person gathering infect many, infect many more.

At least, mass mask acceptance across US, like countries world, would gone lone way. think might late.

Also, sacrifices take seriously mostly squandered. go out, mean should.

In China, slaughterhouses separate meat markets.

There special slaughter plant slaughter meat sell wholesale market, sell pork restaurants, retailers, individuals.

&amp;#x200B;

It's pretty basic knowledge. Imported frozen salmon.

But also deny selling live animals. fucking huge place, sell everything. make ""basically meat processing plant"" fair describes much US nice fellow :D Fauci literally admitted mask recomendation prevent run n95s. wonder Wolf's approval rating dropped 65% 45% last months. guy acting like straight-up tyrant. sad home state. care making money **doing things like/want**

I'm asking links proving case anywhere else. comparing say ""utter lack respect care""? Carmen Quintero works early shift distribution warehouse ships N95 masks products nation siege coronavirus. March 23, developed severe cough, voice, usually quick enthusiastic, barely whisper.

A human resources staff member told Quintero needed go home.

“They told couldn’t come back tested,” said Quintero, also told would need document didn’t virus.

Her primary care doctor directed nearest emergency room testing practice coronavirus tests.

The Corona Regional Medical Center around corner house Corona, California, nurse tested breathing gave chest X-ray. hospital didn’t tests either, nurse told go Riverside County’s public health department. There, public health worker gave 800 number call schedule test. earliest county could test April 7, two weeks later.

At hospital, Quintero got doctor’s note saying stay home work week, told behave COVID-19, isolating vulnerable household members. difficult — Quintero lives grandmother girlfriend’s parents — managed. one else home got sick, time April 7 came, felt better decided get coronavirus test.

Then bill came.

The Patient: Carmen Quintero, 35, Corona, California, works distribution warehouse. Anthem Blue Cross health insurance plan job $3,500 annual deductible.

Total Bill: Corona Regional Medical Center billed Quintero $1,010, Corona Regional Emergency Medical Associates billed additional $830 physician services. also paid $50 Walgreens fill prescription inhaler.

Service Provider: Corona Regional Medical Center, for-profit hospital owned Universal Health Services, company based King Prussia, Pennsylvania, one largest health care management companies nation. hospital contracts Corona Regional Emergency Medical Associates, part of Emergent Medical Associates.

Medical Service: Quintero evaluated emergency room symptoms consistent COVID-19: wracking cough difficulty breathing. chest X-ray breathing treatment prescribed inhaler.

What Gives: On day late March body shook coughing, Quintero’s immediate worry infecting family, especially girlfriend’s parents, 65, 84-year-old grandmother.

“If something happen them, don’t know would able live it,” said Quintero.

Quintero wanted isolate hotel, could hardly afford week stayed home. three paid sick days forced take vacation time symptoms subsided allowed back work. time, places provided publicly funded hotel rooms sick people isolate, Quintero offered help.

For medical care, Quintero knew high-deductible plan yet felt choice follow doctor’s advice go nearest emergency room get tested. assumed would get test pay. Congress passed CARES Act just week before, headlines saying coronavirus testing would free.

That legislation turned riddled loopholes, especially people like Quintero needed wanted coronavirus test couldn’t get one early pandemic.

“I didn’t think fair went get tested,” said.

Some insurance companies voluntarily reducing copayments for COVID-related emergency room visits. Quintero said insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, would reduce bill. Anthem would discuss case Quintero signed privacy waiver; would accept signed standard waiver KHN uses. hospital would discuss bill reporter unless Quintero could also phone, something yet arranged around Quintero’s workday.

Three states have gone Congress waive cost sharing testing diagnosis pneumonia influenza, given illnesses often mistaken COVID-19. California one them, Quintero’s employer self-insured — company pays health services directly funds — exempt state directives anyway. U.S. Department Labor regulates self-funded insurance plans. 2019, nearly 2 3 covered workers were types plans.

Resolution: As lockdown restrictions ease coronavirus cases rise around country, public health officials say quickly isolating sick people virus spreads families essential.

But isolation efforts gotten little attention U.S. Nearly local health departments, including Riverside County, Quintero lives, programs, according National Association County City Health Officials. Many designed shelter people experiencing homelessness used isolate others.

Raymond Niaura, interim chairman Department Epidemiology New York University, said programs used inconsistently poorly promoted public.

“No one done lot what’s happening people making go along,” said Niaura. “We’ve never circumstance like this.”

Quintero still worries bringing virus home family fears room grandmother. Quintero works warehouse distributes 3M products including personal protective equipment companies’ products. Quintero returns work every day now, puts clothes separate hamper diligently washes hands interacts anyone.

The bills another constant worry. Quintero called hospital insurance company complained pay since seeking test doctor’s orders. Neither budged, bills labeled “payment reminders” soon became “final notices.” reluctantly agreed pay $100 month toward balance — $50 hospital $50 doctors.

“None wanted work me,” Quintero said. “I give first payment bill wouldn’t send collections.”

 Takeaway: If suspect COVID-19 need isolate protect vulnerable members household, call local public health department. counties isolation quarantine programs, resources well known. may placed hotel, recreational vehicle type housing wait infection period. need positive COVID test qualify programs use programs await test result. area public health officials repeatedly offer clear guidance — 14 days isolation — people find impossible follow.

At point pandemic, tests widely available federal law clearly side: charged cost sharing coronavirus test.

Be wary, though, doctor directs emergency room COVID test, additional care get could come high price. Ask testing sites available.

If find big bill related suspected COVID-19, push beyond telephone call insurance company file formal appeal. feel comfortable, ask employer’s human resources staff argue behalf. Then, call help line state insurance commissioner file separate appeal. Press insurers — big companies offer self-insured plans — follow spirit law, even letter law seems let hook. refer timeline vaccine's life cycle prior making comments. tinfoil needed.

Fauci outright admitted Congress. 

Absolutely shameful. many people lie kill, wonder? 

And yet praise Fauci kind hero... always, go backyard watch fireworks anyone shooting  Thank insight! people wearing masks? Yeah thats case. That’s way lies work. someone role importance lies. People tend want believe anything ever said say.  hear man. 90 years old using Reddit? Rock on! honestly say probably 10 years now, and.....yes! much better remember! still bit greasy everything really good. dressings salads favorite.  Well, players advised isolated right regardless testing positive. far know, think general consensus players following that. general, players really want restart season trying make possible. barring chance 9 players 9 separate teams spread entire team practice isolated, think there’s good chance 9 players don’t really spread ton. also don’t quite get mean “public habit” respect players, mean generally public? almost wonder people see overwhelmed hospitals eyes, believe real? hurricane see flood water damage. COVID's damage kept hidden due HIPAA. There's way we'll hit 80K per day August. can't keep growing like forever Covid-19--9-9 Holy shit. work testing lab, feel like don’t anywhere near $500 work per test. guess machines pretty expensive, spend maybe 4 minutes sample, way resulting releasing it. Common sense said it. lived nervous getting assaulted something crazies thought people wearing masks disease. 
Can’t believe ride packed bus work lockdown get rid virus, slow spread virus spreads overwhelmingly fast. literally overwhelming hospitals leads people dying enough medical care go around. Ok man, laid you.

You're testing 1000 people day getting 150 positive results. That's 15% positive rate.

You double testing 2000 day getting 292 positive results. 14.6% positive rate.

So, sure dropped .4% positive rate close double number people infected. going percentage rates without context hard numbers obscures bad is. USA! USA!

*::explodes extreme coughing wheezing fit::*

USA! mean, that’s good theory execution logistics sounds like nightmare. Read everything listed. Thanks hope information becomes accessible better publicized. definitely snarky, sarcastic stupid. Apologies order. Please accept. naive focus mainly ones risk serious illness? vast majority COVID-19 pass without medical intervention long people follow restrictions take care also protect vulnerable, even without knowing you’re carrier. Along nice helping kidney lung damage putting people comorbidities unnecessary danger.

Who fuck claim kind authority subject? one, that's who. Shut fuck up. I’ll smoke bogie backwards thumb like it’s fine Stop, collaborate listen. fuck's sake. IFR 50 like 00.001%. 0.1% IFR 70 high (like 6%) skews average (also theyll likely show symptoms young numbers still skewed serology).

That's point, save 70s via human challenge quarantine 50s. Don’t take wrong way almost wish spiking too, everyone live acting everything normal again. feel like every week I’m working it’s going get risky, 3-4 weeks line seems like spiking crap ton well could get point. wish clear view what’s going don’t even really *need* job right now, it’s help college. !remindme 48 hours Ya def slow season Florida, snow birds gone it’s hot hell. can’t wait til hurricane season, oh boy. right now, testing reported 52,000 new positives yesterday today. Already doubled week accelerating. likely result 20-25k next week. really think people forget fucking big United States is. 

Back April people Florida saying shit like “our hospitals empty, overblown!!” they’re seeing saw northeast northeast started elective surgeries stuff again. I’m looking wrote replied two barely related. you’ve got opinion express, make comment/post instead twisting said. Oh absolutely, hyperbole nothing stage shows closed charts. someone lives Miami, America permission destroy Florida. I’m willing make sacrifice. shit go. read article doctors treating coronavirus (UK). anecdotal evidence doctor saying get past 13 days still need ventilator significantly likely die.

They actually started taking people ventilators give newer patients likely survive. Point is, virus takes weeks kill you. I'll try find article. could predicted this? need build wall. I-80 WI border! 🤣 !remind 48 hours claim "".. testing free everywhere"" mate. 

Which take *if feel got Corona symptoms go test worries cost,* western countries.

But need insurance right? free per se it?  


**Just direct quotes link;**

The owners wanted considered essential business could keep operating. Thanks political connections, got wish. certainly need another America. Given Florida isn’t shutting (yet), late prevent doubling 7/8? Anything instituted today would start showing 7/15, could 400k cases day... yikes! y'all right :(. became furious, said links spurious one claimed asthma issue, curious? Thank help! Yeah, except 5% distributed evenly across population. elderly bear brunt much higher death rates demographics. makes Florida's intransigent stupidity even mind boggling. Losing 15% people 65 would insane, outside realm possibility. silver lining might result shifting political landscape sees people like DeSantis getting kicked office.  Thanks.  general bunch guys standing outside away eachother

Absolutely. Except catcher. Collaborate I've given dating. Next year, maybe. testing center, what’s wait time get test? trying get political, president would honestly suggest something like mention states locked opened early thinking clear. Florida went lockdown opened thinking fine. Credit NY NJ still managing avoid spike cases PSA

This damn virus doesnt suffer fools.


Id prefer Fauci say hasnt dammit Ill say it. guess next Thursday like 17k 18k people actively seeking news theme parks, Disney getting coverage they're Disney. certainly hope not. We're distancing wearing masks everywhere go. Planning staying indoors. came see sister. Hang on, Glorious Leader saying *is* flu. I'm starting get confused actual danger virus, oh well... time party! found yesterday I've wracking brain, too. chance Google.

I'm sure there's research dark money campaigns I'm honest even know Florida businesses.

It’s impossible get pregnant hot tub!

Even masks, it’s probably dangerous? damage already done. repeating making worse, makes look worse actual consequences shit finally starts reach base. brown people get share too. would funny deadly :( states did.

I feel you. However, president l amended weather data sharpie live television. holding breath coherence clarity anytime soon. Still, thoughts Americans. fix this! Fauci’s *just* trying job effectively. Must miserable intelligent sensible person room time. know teachers didn’t pass students other? protect me, protect you. Remind 5 weeks ! like happens incompetent leadership. Military spending doesn’t matter here. single hospital's administration point view maybe makes sense, pandemic response point view ridiculously naive, months thing testing capacity able handle way bare minimum. known since March deaths lag 2 weeks spikes cases. I'm mobile user, appear work way exactly appreciate help. Thanks BLM! clones will, well clone  case recommend Mt Tabor, (the volcano city) well views Council Crest. study also found evidence hand-washing However, results meta-analysis RCTs provide evidence support protective effect hand hygiene transmission laboratory-confirmed influenza.

🤦🏻‍♂️. Something tells paper needs taken grain salt alongside contrary evidence. Question, actually matter wave we’re in? disease might burn mutate weaker countries Asia Oceania may end better.

Most countries west failed containment due incompetance cultural factors. 

The cat bag, failure happened, government openly saying last another year so. 

You accept live life hide away.

It choice. No. honor still goes boss. military distribute food necessities vulnerable populations - allowing shopping essentials strict protocols.

Not mention support within communities. many citizen initiatives made sure vulnerable people still got groceries individuals offering help people around them/vulnerable people knew. expected much happen, people really stepped up.

It's easy dismiss something beforehand think impossible, actually happening always possible originally thought. say done curb behavior

Start dumping bodies campus courtyard.

I'm starting root virus little bit... Top rest world 😎 Bold assume ever admit wrong work fix things Even Florida Man safe Rona. rumor wife’s district they’ll rotate, half kids Monday Wednesday, half Tuesday Thursday, Fridays either school virtual. work.

Turned mistake clusterfuck proportions.

3 months later. 130,000 DEAD.

That dead **entire continent Asia,** nearly 100% mask compliance rate entire crisis.

Fauci get pass he's Fauci.

In alternate, better timeline, Fauci would Paul Revere, shouting us wear masks, everyone around telling us to.

He would gone history hero.

Now he's going go guy lied us 130,000 counting died result. It’s consistent approach applied country’s leadership. “If don’t read Presidential Daily Brief, nothing world wrong.” Somewhat true. Apparently closing soon lead opening soon. Starting look like southern USA wants see better New York handling covid. Fingers crossed 🤞  ...you're implying mental capacity learn exponent is.

The left half bell curve generally incapable understanding normal distributions, bimodal distributions, continuous distributions, exponents, long words. wAnT HAirCuT Look big deal hear gubna talk it. weaker form virus Florida has, even bad get it, refreshing like tic-tac r name? pretty transparent. Something important know California well. Although parts state tend lean one direction also remember population California extremely high well.

There currently people living California Canada, even one party dominant one times discount fact still house one largest populations party country sheer size. Even 30% state taking less seriously still 12 million people top bottom. work place 10% sub-departments staff refuses put masks forced management. Thankfully come contact public time year, get work home refuse building people care anyone themselves. I'm waiting Florida break national one day record.

I'm thinking end week. But, not, next week sure. judge orders testify despite actual 5th amendment concerns, immunized - tell truth, can't get trouble it. 

however, 5th criminal prosecution. civil liability. good testing, call **actual** hospitalizations deaths reach new record ~~Stonks~~ Corona goes up! Maybe US like said NHL season two Canadian cities  nearly bad right rush reopen like US did. Still risky yes we'll see guess: 1. It’s early cycle, we’ll see many succumb it. 2. know treat it. 3. Hospital capacity adequate far, exceed deaths increase. Sheesh. Florida driving like 1/5 daily totals. California probably add 2/5 2/6 national numbers daily. good. math. 20% adds up.

In addition, news coverage COVID-19 focused risks seniors, researchers found patients younger age 65 made sizeable share people hospitalized disease. 508 patients known hospitalized, CDC said:

20% ages 20 44 years;
18% ages 45 54 years;
17% ages 55 64 years;
26% ages 65 84 years; and
9% ages 85 years older. 😂  hospitals covering they're concerned revenue, super dumb. Lying buys hospitals extra days able run elective surgeries, turn made weeks crisis force forgo elective surgeries.

So I'm hearing rest first world universal healthcare provided government works better private profit healthcare.

Who knew right wing politicians said, ""ask Canadian"" healthcare system actually meant better. goes around comes around.

Some people attendance get infected. might hospitalized. might significant hospital bill many families cannot afford. 

The infected people bring virus home. parents siblings children friends get infected. people hospitalized. die. Even die, afford deductible co-pay healthcare bill. hospitalized survive might permanent damage organs.

A parent's death going change kid's life dramatically. financial struggle consequence. Maybe university (or university massive debt), co-signing loans credit cards, maybe home live in.

Do feel lucky? Thanks Florida, always count make us look little less stupid. Sincerely, Texas. experts dont like idea mandatory public mask use one really know hot use masks. example may false sense security disregard 6 feet distance, may keep touching face adjust mask breath scratch itch, would touch face use mask. I'm saying dont wear mask understand coming from. CIDRAP information lack studies mask shows theres many ""expert"" advices contradicting Well good news then! Testing capacity maxed now. (detectable) exponential growth! live state :(  here. considered maybe one get it?

People know difference mean median, there's extremely little difference two values comes IQ necessarily true. could testing mainly symptomatic patient, would mean number tests increase alongside number symptomatic patients, increased testing alone would account higher number positive cases, means people sick therefore qualifying tested. increased testing account increase reported cases decrease testing accounts decrease. Got know words mean YES understand this... People want endure another lock understanding mechanics behind works work first place relies abstract logical thinking. People rely common sense guide decision making process, truth common sense based feeling rather facts often wrong. tests increasing doesn’t mean cases increasing. finding them, anything even concerned Florida.

It’s clearly control soon hospital room. Jesus get shit together summer, get shit together ! feels like weird Aesop fable- US rushing quick, sloppy, careless confident rest us slow, ultimately seems likely get place less trouble. Unless it’s investing. That’s good exponential growth. Yea don’t trust bunch amusement park employees (high school stoners) properly sanitize everything. 

You moron go amusement park Florida year. Fauci winner

The guy literally gotten nothing correct, believed etc.

For love him, hell done? Dumb motherfuckers Crazy next week ""only"" 12000 new cases ... happy? Can’t economy everyone dead. yes listen carrot science. NBA still scheduled play?  Dark orange probably #LET RIDE

Gov said would sacrifice many needs get ""economy"" back open.  TURN UP, LITERALLY INJECT VEINS front page WashPost picture today titled something like: ""Nurse suctions lungs Covid patient ICU"".

Pretty sure I'm going parties thing anymore... sources numbers? study published China shows 66-70% hospitalized patients lung scarring. people blood clots cause strokes, 5% hospitalized Wuhan strokes, neurological problems, heart problems. 

With little know carefree attitude ""recovering"" acting like fine worrying me, personally want chance ""recovering"" permanent neurological problem. Yep. indoor dining allowed recently towards end Phase 2 Gyms Casinos opening phase, matter time.

Plus everyone thinks mostly safe ""have control""

Snowbirds coming back home, tourists reseed MA. means hot spot spike one place skewed countries numbers, made everyone think recovering much better virus, really NY getting things control. Look 7 day moving average deaths California, Texas, Florida, Arizona. 

The government used national data pressure states reopen, used comparison ""it's bad here, we're nowhere near New York numbers"". 

Do source historical IFR? get point. seems like there's 15 seconds clock chance attempt onside kick. improbable recover score, surely worth trying. think looking death rate tell whole story, though. recently talking doctor friend telling us younger people still placed ventilators, contribute longer term side effects, even survival rate remains high. focusing deaths account lung damage people suffer complications. simply *NOT* flu.

Edit: also without maxing capacity hospitals yet either happen without precautions place like before. We’re going die global warming cuz incapable restraining huh? worked guy damn savant Disney stuff. pretty much everything memorized. Like days certain things could booked, long cancellation periods were, rules regarding changing things reservations, etc. long list loopholes get stuff wanted.

Like instead booking restaurant event, book something less popular, less good time frame. able reschedule / change plans go place wanted time wanted jumping hoops.

I swear time someone within earshot mentioned Disney he'd jump chance try walk system getting super popular stuff gets fully booked quickly. Part Disney Facebook group. People booking like crazy.

Kind like bee sting: everyone reacts die quickly without treatment. people forget stay surfaces good people contagious asymptomatic week. numbers un UK falling? Working senior center King County Washington, first place virus hit Stateside, regular conversations County Health officials well Seattle City Health officials, still yet unable set timeline operate again, promise full shit. Writing post titles English would helpful crisis charging 2000 month child care. Sorry you’re blind see robbing you.

Edit: btw, personally pay 20 dollars day daycare. depends hustle. would read past headline, you’ll see CARES act prohibits copays coronavirus testing there’s cost patient. Also, people getting tested government run field clinics don’t bill all. sure, let’s read headlines make definitive statements that. Bold assume they'll even wearing masks first place! choose faith science?

👌🏻 made right choice. Currently job 4 money. Much better kid money love living Florida everyday... Great picture painted. Gun head, screaming, ""EVERYTHING FINE!! TOTALLY CALM EVERYTHING NORMAL!!! SAYING NORMAL?"" Back early stages severe shortage ppe Healthcare workers. hospitals can't get masks nurses doctors get sick system treating severely ill breaks down. time think made right decision. literally opposite suggesting (which also assumed they'd doing).

Bloody hell! again, cannot believe type this, source shows annual deaths CDC. mention ""reseting"" deaths. Overall, CDC estimates 12,000 61,000 deaths **annually** since 2010 blamed flu. Globally, World Health Organization (WHO) estimates flu kills 290,000 650,000 people **per year**. 

Now take moment read done rereading it, want read again. might notice bold words there, meant highlight important detail talking about. 

Now, sources? going continue silly conversation anymore source yourself. testing increased measurable amount? guess stretch, testing increasing, would cause spike cases. That's probably wishful thinking, though. someone froma single payer country, complicated. Buddy mine doctor said work super slow since non-essential surgeries cancelled people going doctors hospitals less general. much though, can't see future preparation potential flood cases.

Keep mind though since single payer paid taxes huge income losses hospitals doctors, basically slow work days loss profit since taxes keep paid (though economic crisis due virus fun). 

Private practices certainly suffering since elective stuff elective surgeries factor publically funded hospitals much.

My girlfriend works kindergarten teacher furloughed couple months working two days week got paid same. think vaccine deployment works?  ""nobody office grinding 8 hrs""
Very true. lived SF Bay arra, would see numerous employees casually walking around mega complexes (outside lunch). managers dicks trying look good thier boss, long productive, take time unwind case take care kids) Universities probably one institutions actually listen science, particularly research universities, they're actively looking trends things keep going likely stay closed next semester. 
It would huge slap face medical science departments university ignored warnings. 
The reason know I've trying get job working research university since april currently either phase 1 phase 0 reopening lol. universities give shit private ones focus science/medicine, like liberty university. Mine breaking wearing every single day 8 hours work. started washing every day cleared up!! I’d recommend buying washing one often (assuming it’s cloth, job provides me) Oh math? determined 28 less 31? Excellent. Maybe make PSA post make fact widely known. 

Someone also look September, April, June, November numbers days compare, report back. Still treating like PR problem. They're even locking though, they? 

They even trying contain this. damn room. Americans value life economy. 

It also trade off. maximize economy health. Bill Gates said, can't get Americans ignore bodies carry like normal. Yeah that’s business usual I’m saying hasn’t happened yet tho. Maybe they’re taking precaution now. Every young person isn’t necessarily around older people constantly saying would situation would great solution parents. decided early neighbors across street, son sons age (14 months), would one exception hanging out. We're taking many precautions possible, feel reasonably comfortable them. said huge relief work 4 parents watching two toddlers easier 2 parents watching one toddler/balancing meetings everything.  


Also, saying would time someone home daycare industry branch watching older kids providing place day helping school work. know parents would pay/what caretakers would charge could seen less responsibility factor age kids fact things already need day (vs planning/scheduling like littles). Anyway, two cents. Monday, first available appointment phone lines city Tampa July 10th.... February 29th LONG time ago. information revised, updated, announced, repeated incessantly: MASKS WORK. Nobody, mean nobody, claim really honestly think masks don’t work. people think things like sunscreen seatbelts don’t work. Science says masks work. point people say think masks don’t work they’re lying. means don’t wanna. Freedums. wonder doctor graduated University Ubeki-beki-beki-beki-stan-stan. Shit, forgot smallpox, polio, Ebola, etc rampant still /s

 maybe... maybe... Vaccines work. 

That conclusion would 'dubious best' though, another 14 diseases eliminated due vaccines used horrific issues. 

Get educated dude. *checks username* 

Hi Patrick!! Lol Gotcha. understood initial comment ""it matter long get it"". first-world nation without healthcare, cost important. Millions uninsured due cost universal healthcare. Luckily enough gf decent amount saved, won’t last forever it’ll help way FL’s trajectory would even could match NY’s. population densities outside time different there’s point trying draw comparisons. several examples countries got control without full Chinese-style lockdown. Even Italy grocery stores pharmacies open allowed people outside exercise time.

With amount home entertainment available, think you’re overestimating people would complied *if financially capable so*.

Yes would still people trying gatherings covertly, number would lot less what’s happening now. complete utter shit show end sight. What?? call people stupid? okay bud? critical interview. says current situation week highly disturbing.

1. Many young people underlying conditions.

2. get virus, part pandemic spread. Even mild case, spread take societal responsibility. 

Rather mindset opposing forces public health opening, best way open use public health measures.

Deaths- 
1. People getting infected average decade half younger.

2. better job protecting elderly vulnerable.

3. careful may delay deaths uptick.

Pooling-
Pooling used surveillance rather individual detection. Take part sample 10 people combine them. it’s negative, know 10 people negative. positive, go back check. 

Mutations genetic drift- 
Maybe single mutation allows virus replicate transmissible. studied

Vaccines: still caveat may know viable candidate end year early next year.

Therapies: dexamethosone remdesivir promising clinical trial antibodies testing 

How long immunity last vaccine? Good question. don’t know. reports limits detectable immunity asymptomatic people. 6 months in. First JAMA paper January.

Testing- substantial resources try get better diagnostics. PCR specific rapidly scale?

Big events- school reopening sporting events
Schools- delicate balance exponential outbreak , kids can’t go school, need flexible get kids back school. Try get kids back. get back virus spread, ways limit spread. Principle prudently get kids back school.

Colleges- testing open intermittently. dorm infected people.

Schools: depends level infectivity local area. areas may none; others much open.

Sporting events: Fauci doesn’t determine open anything. answers questions doesn’t decide do. gatekeeper professional sports. Must safeguard health players spectators. 

Testimony- memorable 
1. Early 80s HIV

2. Following 9/11 Anthrax attack

3. Ebola- trying explain little impact US

4. current pandemic historic it’s unprecedented. economy serious public health issue it’s difficult. 

Fauci- favorite person question Congress, excluding current members: 
Teddy Kennedy passionate public health
Henry Waxman Yeah guess said March means never change anything July. Gotta stick said first, never allowed change statements. said reasons wear masks then, would allowed wear masks now. Oh well. believe hoax reasons allowed discuss sub apparently politics nothing government's coronavirus response such, discussing people think hoax authority sources reliable, serves purpose effect individual group prevention safety! 

Man, sure glad official sub covid discussions dedicated making sure people completely well informed best promote public safety!  So. Much. Winning. social distancing, outdoors BLM protestors wearing masks. helps mitigate spread significantly. 

Indoors, particularly masks on, like states reopened early doing, that's what's spiking covid rates. One guy cough can't really much damage outdoor protest, get every single person bar sick house party sick.   trying hit peak long election corona lower vote numbers later also trying stop mail voting dem states trying keep numbers might lower turnout physical voting. 

They might even succeed pulling shit like this. could back fire long before. Repub states might get hit hard set collapses, people freak every community isolates civil war degree resist gov involvement could hit hard ultimately voting numbers go lot. ""myalgic encephalomyelitis"" ""chronic fatigue syndrom"". it, lots others it. look reddit google see crippling disease is. viruses (super likely) cause it. doesnt get researched enough. bad worst cases cant even leave bed. people get fucked life jackass virus. wouldnt surprised virus leaves big wave ME/CFS patients wake. don’t get either, like what’s hard writing 600,000? Right.. like people positive forever. new positives literally new cases, sick much earlier least would recovered now. wait, portion people think rights violated care responsibilities come rights? end violating peoples rights trying protect rights everyone safety liberty.  Bruh. country, Malaysia hit 1 case day decreasing 2 digits. could one screwed badly managing state.. Florida hospitals full. majority icu beds available dwindling general population beds. hospitals mostly understaffed March many cancelled lot prn, agency float staff try keep full time employees working. state reopened people started stupid shit getting admitted. Surgeries restarted. covid surged. 

In hospital, 18 patients covid positive 10 icu. icu 23 bed unit, 10 may seem like much it’s almost half icu. still post ops requiring 1-2 days icu care, people stupid drunk shit, accidents, heart attacks- one outbreak nursing home away completely overrun-which whole shutdown March suppose prevent people give shit. sure difference overrun March overrun I’m saying, community almost point care seriously delayed lots things covid.

Sorry. Don’t take local nurse doctor best long wait.its fault state country won’t help us help you. Yeah , think it’s moved Florida filed dependent mother something like dehumanizing, even know word means? would dehumanizing considered dad cattle blindly follows trump, that's clearly case. love dad, want see dad get sick die. end day, he's adult, lives end country, there's much saying ""fuckit, I've got things worry want help yourself"" I’m part Disneyworld group it’s unreal unconcerned people are. many complaining masks. 

I mean love Disney too. priorities people!  know, looking headlines sub makes think whoever writes playing sort multiplayer Plague Inc.

Shatters records. 
Highest record. 
Highest world.

Fucking depressing. :/  No, California recorded 10,000 cases day yet. here's handful threads California past week. Georgia know I'm wearing one‽‽‽‽‽‽ That’s April bud get prize? Also, wrong thinking point thing run hosts? Spreading population like wildfire isn’t exactly ideal, realize immunity isn’t guarantee, isn’t evidence suggest second infection least less severe less likely entirely? Lol, calling people stupid, defensive it, take guy insulting you. Turns coronavirus care believe not. Players wont play unless good amenities. Whats point spending 3 months away family, shit location literally nothing small room court. Many would screw season spend time home. Jesus Christ. least 10000+ tests single day. considering new infected case rate, they're gonna need keep up. catch twice, eternal lockdown.

US death rate realllly skewed high number deaths elderly. think 50% deaths come nursing homes.

At OPs age, IFR somewhere around 00.01% (or less) need STOP TESTING NOW!!! It’s balance though. every business close, make life less convenient stuck home, encouraging non-compliance.

Can admit Americans we’re straight pampered non-compliant world? certain percentage population needs message reinforced repeatedly. thinking SeaWorld tired winning yet? test dump. literally politicians hoping for: want increase testing way easily see many people actually getting sick. name political party affiliation, since want fall afoul no-politics rule, news makes clear.

Tests coming back 20%+ positive COVID-19 equivalent maxing radiation meter goes 3.6 roentgen. American system, hospital cannot refuse treat you, even already owe money, know never pay. So, leads incredible costs system tries cover costs people never money pay them. 

Basically poor guy gets sick gets bill $50,000, never pays dime, that's twice makes year, middle class guy's insurance gets charged $120,000, pays $5000, insurance pays $75,000 negotiating, hospital breaks even non paying poors. 

Universal health care would much cheaper this, ""freedom."" Whatever means. Right around time get money trickle economics almost like pandemic national security threat people learn need wear masks slow growth go absolutely necessary california. one talking here? lol, agenda here, move along Lockdown compliance actually really good.

Until disinformation campaign happened many exemptions, became easy justify harder get people comply. didn’t say was? one said “better” studies, proceeded provide observational studies. 

Of course RCTs needed, they’re underway. I’m one saying study better yours. RCTs, observational studies it. reason people ITT opposed particular one goes beliefs — ironic people try explain science works.  ways beat absolute crap someone social distancing.  Y’all realize wasn’t triage situation right? state doctors decided wasn’t worth intubation patient low chance recovery low quality life. Apparently put hands ears shout “no no” flailing feet waves magically go away. rate Florida going you’re gonna fully open 4 weeks. Man guys fucked. Good luck everyone baffles numbers infected people actually put small amount people icu. Netherlands things almost back normal. hand full people icu it’s like nothing ever even happened  dying coronavirus dying heartattck since proper treament since hospitals swamoed two completelty different measures. make martini 2 jiggers gin, 1/2 jigger spring water, 1/2 jigger bleach? think called ""HydroxychloroGin"". president came beginning said ""Democratic hoax"". context calling response response hoax. context aside attaching word hoax pandemic incredibly reckless fucked up, lot base get context, saw HOAX wrap.

Trump 100% reason gotten hand. ROCK FLAG EAGLE! Florida needs slow testing fine... lol maybe I’ve following closely every day since January. people wearing masks religiously. Heh... said ""load"" understand catch COVID19, recover, catch again?

Or could long term health effects mess rest life, without actively killing you? Permanent Lung damage example? Survivability =/= long term negative effects.

Or US deathrate ***much*** higher 0.01%?

It's like catch it, quarantine 14 days, never worry directly affecting life again...right? Grazie dello sforzo Davide. :) would reset? flu season calculated October May according article posted?? brave gotta love right wing idiots coming circle jerk without thinking anything.

1) Hospitalization UP. Also, paid attention, would know takes time cases get require hopsitalization.

2) related increase testing would also see postive rate going down. fact relatively shows another issue.

Do people ever actually look facts data instantly disbelieve anything 'mainstream'?? Yea dude, gone easter. hear? pandemic removing R’s might lead thinks. Yeah, live GA coast, 70 miles Jax. People go shopping partying time. I'm staying home. Lolol species America moment. I’m Asia country opened theme park 25% capacity. new infections single digits daily yeah wow missed that, what's end game? avoid cancelling church services? iirc that's texas limiting outside attendance events inside perfect time panic! No, good guess stop testing! There’s many cases!! daycare model dead. They've added many regulations industry gets sued time owned big corporations. mandate child adult ratio that's way stricter 20 years ago. lot people like people's children, even day care workers suck way stay home kid.
Daycare infant live $2000 month kindercare. Even charging that, biggest local daycare going bankrupt. crisis sure, daycare workers deserve pay. deal human feces. Exactly, haven’t expanding amount testing..

People still waiting line 5hr cars

At point six months along, every neighborhood/area site. least step messaging Damn r/nottheonion one. think agree. really need slow testing /s. look track percentage tests come back positive. Rage Machine  Got lucky af Arnie, think that's luck ended. incorrect. It’s average 18 days infection death. Average incubation period 5.1 days. Testing positive somewhere between. Hard tell ""blame"". guy went knowing carrier people attended knowing likely carriers (why not? virus eradicated). Lockdown absolutely answer. answer. 

Congress simply needs correctly. *What Like.... BoomCHICKBoomBoom, HAVIN' 'RONA!* pathetic display poor leadership. work industry far stuffy education, far larger Florida State University. one leadership chain would ever even propose policy much less approve it.

Everyone working home, working much better anyone imagined would. Kids kids, get fuck it. I’m Texas. 30 yo male. Healthy, fit, marathoner. virus. I’m drained walking around. Don’t even think going upstairs. haven’t played dog days. sitting around couch walking minutes time tires out. 

Keep mask on, even others aren’t.  thoughts exactly. mean testing free everywhere... yea, sure thought hurricane season ovah would close borders go lockdown indefinitely none 3 built immunity up. would quite literally stay holed winter.

Why? could Sweden simply slow spread herd immunity developed? would technique work Sweden past?

What nations take least harm approach try control virus halting spread. far extremely successful. however vaccine comes virus burn out, would nothing stopping continuing test, trace isolate cases entire population become immune (a modified Swedish strategy).

So worst, would hit hard Sweden.

But, vaccine come, virus burns out, would far lower numbers deaths decided dangerous risk worth it. Sweden found far likely happen does. Historically would accurate.

No, wouldn't. fact complete opposite reality actually 3 nations took ""riskiest"" strategy

Bullshit. Tegnell implying infections later somehow deadly infections earlier, simple bullshit. 1918 flu see ""second wave"" resulted many deaths, viral outbreaks opposite. longer remain uninfected, better chance survival.

Why?

Because even months line, doctors much better treating disease saving lives. Sweden seeing right number deaths falling even though number cases still increasing dramatically.

Even Sweden, much better chance surviving become infected now, became infected March.

That alone proves Tegnell's plan disaster killed thousands people unecessarily. asked questions rather answering mine.

Predictable. People still go. uh... used metal detector water fountain mall. We're bunch children whose self-identity based contrarian. ever moment exactly want without consideration consequences others, really free something. Especially authority expert told it. Perhaps not, would slow rapid spread we're seeing allow us identify sick healthy remain way. 

Previously, 1/3 country self isolating spread slowing. went full assed reopening cases spiked. huge problem state officials emboldened idiots selfish last months. Floridian word ""storm"" reminds bad going Hurricane hits year... We're growing fast inevitable 9 players already it. see reflected 2 weeks. public habit change, exponentially players tested positive 2 - 4 weeks now. single person truly knows body respond this. why? don’t understand.. can’t seriously scientific data support this... highly doubt players Orlando bubble stay rooms games. gonna spread like wildfire We’re wining! test trace Rt way 1 Again, source estimate think death count resets.

I already seeing lost cause persist. hate geographical location Florida reason? sounds wholly unnecessary. probably another late party comment D614G variant known quite awhile now. Perhaps someone full access article confirm. thought hurricane season elsewhere news -

The number daily Covid deaths steadily falling past months continues downward trend.

The USA reporting lowest daily Covid deaths since battle began Willful ignorance bad, boys.

You essential workers!

Now git thar an' wrastle! Fireworks effectively kill coronaviruses test tubes. precedent there! believe pronounced “Flavortown”. Good.  Absolutely Sort of. weeks ago people applauding FL handling things. Look though. herd immunity? wonder upcoming fall winter virus playground. That's Santa intubates Mommy. Santa caught COVID19 traveling Florida vacation home. 

Also, Santa Claus probably survive. Christmas consist presents watching church Facebook live. 

You thank DeSantis also shows importance *same rules* entire country regardless cases. stop spreading, heck regions shutdown zero cases push schools open. slave masters need us slaving taking care children. Somethings going break system. Cripes Oh , state armed militia occupied state capitol intimidate ""oppressors"" trying protect public pandemic? Weird. probably mean okay ~not~ risk everything. That, NBA theme parks luxuries humans can, should, live without point time. understandable people enjoy things, bummer, one tell disappointed. But, people enabling industries open up. Oh sure lag contributing lot it. numbers always telling us were, are. Test results take while, deaths take even longer. Measures put place instant results, everything takes time evaluate. really fucking mess. Fauci get pass.

Everyone accountable. Trump, Surgeon General, Fauci, governors.

Everyone.

This lack accountability lead shitshow response 130,000 deaths counting. Texas friend who's pissed go annual 4th cookout (there's going large group people). crazy become political people right ignore it, think overblown happen even cases skyrocket. Disney opening soon passing Corona kids, adults, employees en masse sounds like terrible move. can’t imagine scenario goes well without vaccine testing station entrance, alongside extreme extensive cleaning. likely testing enough people get large enough cross-section cAsE’s wEnT MoNdAy tHrU wEdNeSdAy, iT’s oVeR! earth flat world?  comment getting stale tbh Ah yes, ol pass buck strategy. Federal government wanna look bad leave states, governor's wanna look bad leave county..county executives/mayor's wanna look bad blame people..

Pretty bold assume population needs told wash hands handle even slightest bit responsibility. one chance stop thing blew it. Chrome, go 3-dots menu upper right corner.

Everyone knows less test less cases are. wrestlers buff they’re hopped pain killers steroids... covid could number them.

So agree guy, ""He never said [masks useless]""

he say general public worry *right now* (4 months ago), they're perfect, think healthcare workers sick instead see deleted comment history.  Yeah, Fauci nothing predicament...

He's liar. He's misinformed us many times. He's one fault, he's definitely fault. Test , Trace, Isolate. Test, Trace, Lockdown. One man went nightclub Seoul, South Korea, 2 months ago, mobilized 8500 police officers country trace cluster, two months later still it, calling second wave. Probably locked something again, dont know dont care. useless long term.

Well pedantic, Karma literally means ""action."" buddhist thought, prior actions cumulate called ""karma."" technically Florida's karma, much fruit drop ripe enough. Michigan-based news site.

I expect numbers jump pretty significantly next day two. numbers hold true, **there still 15k tests analyzed last week**.

- New cases tests administered 1-7 days ago: +2,806 (84.2%)
- New cases tests administered 8-14 days ago: +508
- New cases tests administered 15-21 days ago: +10
- New cases tests administered 22 days ago: +9

Serology testing info fourth tab. heck people!! Still though, four week cycle, maybe five? still expect trends move together, delay. must factor infections death curves move delayed tandem? Unless you’re talking 401k savings plan. Consider hard lesson Americans must learn past decades policy rewarded selfish, rich, treat life like zero-sum game (and still is) objective failure. We're middle experiencing feels like we're consumer cattle milked elite happens shit *REALLY* hits fan. cows slaughter. get lazy &amp; enabling mindsets allowed kinds people/policy take power. I'm talking ""BUT ME?"" mindsets, I'm talking ""Why fuck confederacy still goddamn symbol 100 years later &amp; shut like Germans shut Nazi's"".

Literally, country founded principles aimed escape/prevent kind scenario living now. everything hiding behind mask ""voting"" ""democracy"" mean we're peasants nobility told ""Let eat cake"" early Americans escaped hundreds years ago. We've failed population ensure snakes species figure break &amp; exploit republic, population collective social laziness going pay heavy toll.

We either dramatically reform everything revolution happen. Or, everything continue crumble country effectively goes way Rome. One solution save country, others pretty much guarantee America lose current status world stage 20 years so. NBA serious problems... maximum 450 players NBA given time. 
 Sorry I’m little dubious CDC point. I’ll keep wearing masks go time being. There’s plenty anecdotal evidence studies disagree one. exponential growth explained   town, I've seen probably 100+ people packing RVs weekend. headed heavily-trafficked lakes beaches.

Buckle up, gang... New York much higher death rate California? 1.66 times number cases ~5 times deaths California.

Joking aside, think awful legislators create law right type behavior. Criminal conspiracy commit murder absolute least.

Maybe even charges need placed  introduce law quickly can't even get people wear masks?  Corona Carriage! knowingly risking health safety others. get prison. Fuck fines. allows means get away shit. No, right, can't. can't *keep* pretending like case places world. relevance Sweden vs Neighbouring countries here? guess we'll see, let's hope lingering effects virus bad, huh?  States like Illinois Michigan (and others, I'm familiar policies state) went largely telemedicine months, meant childhood vaccinations, cancer screenings, wellness checks, etc. I'm sure know ""elective"" means. anything scheduled dying today. Hip replacement, biopsy, repairing torn ACL, thousands procedures elective.

People scared reacted messaged. closed doctors offices told people stay home matter what. Implicitly, course going ER chest pain allowed. problem people think ""well, probably serious"" go, even though would gone normal times.

In practice, put non-COVID healthcare hold. consequences. argue whether worth it, can't deny happened.  Listen reddit morons.

""We talking years great lack intensive care almost increase testing due tests available (like everyone tried stick president for).....total confirmed cases go....UP

You take math classes, shows. Also, simply note rise cases far underneath corresponding increase testing rate. Real collegiates hands folks. Fingers crossed! Maybe right (?)....perhaps taking bets NY... partying (?). thought read late last night seeing today, can't find it. I'm going delete comment case..... want spread false info.... Ok ""is shortage"". numbers? bad it? 

Many fine word use many HCWs speaking issue. Unless devalue testimonies. 

Denmark, Norway Finland controlled outbreaks led reduced strain HCWs even need speak like Swedish ones do. 

But one grotesque thing Swedish trolls handwave away Swedish healthcare workers speak strain under. shows utter lack respect care. still national plan. anything federal messaging ""everything fine"". criminal negligence.  ... supposed comment this? He's certain color disabled. certain political faction held sway state certain views groups rights certain resources. Get rock climbing/bouldering! Problem solving, risk without much danger, good exercise. feel like he'd love it! Put corona virus jails. needs fucking stop...now. “Turkey, officially Republic Turkey, transcontinental country Eurasia, located mainly Anatolian peninsula Western Asia, smaller portion Balkan peninsula Southeastern Europe.” criticism his/his serosurvey team's work he/they actual math wrong made errors checked goofy political stuff lol.  *Mission Accomplished 🇺🇸* think literally followers die, lots will. think plenty left vote him. many Trump voters bright. like he's bully. seems strong powerful them.

/s ""news source"" accepted forum, frankly. Read damn room. Americans value life economy. 

Instead throwing money wall street prop market, followed every democracy industrialized nation did, lock pay percentage citizen’s wages keep afloat.

Obviously, expect delay deaths, expect see deaths start rise again? I’m sorry. sure tell grandmother love her, can. governor said opening barriers preventing use app-based contact tracing U.S?

Obviously biggest risk factor workers ones leaving ""bubble"" risk could heavily mitigated workers players wearing masks interactions. 

But biased speaking really really wanna watch basketball :( Leadership sent sick senior citizens nursing homes That's state forced delay Even 1 person 1 many. seems like two types people go nursing (and teaching, caring type professions). love people helping people, love control vulnerable people :( like Florda Texas competing see next New York! asking update since initial plan unusual. 67 deaths according another article, notice lot sources leaving out.

That said, coronavirus task force Dr. Fauci consistently said wear masks reduce viral transmissions even nominally reduces risk.

You're making Trump look bad. mention guy everyone lives would put mandatory quarantine Germany. Well yeah, “willful” implies degree stupidity. educate uneducated? really care human life. Period. lot state governors, too. know people die due policies. kids school almost 2 months. may full ended lock they’ve easing quite long time. It’s millennials. town everyone see wearing mask old.

I've generally seen month lag deaths. usually week get tested, another 1-2 weeks need hospitalization, 1-2 weeks die recover. Fucking incompetent governors could've saved countless lives used common sense months ago. Shame politicizing fucking pandemic part age well? What's going American South repeat went NY/NJ/MA couple months ago, minus deaths. first wave, states -- AZ, FL, TX -- less-than-exponential growth phase he's talking about. Even though cases growing, they're growing less proportionately day previous day, exceptions (today FL one them).  keep repeating bullshit, know works help believe drivel keep vomiting out, literally twisted words repeatedly because, again, agenda push.

Lock worked state.

I front line worker office, worked home, full time since pandemic started.

Except sick COVID, worked three 20 hour weeks recovered.

You fun getting voted Reddit effort justify incorrect beliefs.

Riots! don’t know tell breh. Denying reality isn’t going magically make coworker better upon time, challenges childhood adulthood were, least initially, unpleasant rites passage.

We knocked one one produced petulant monsters play docile get exactly want. complete assholes they're inconvenienced face discomfort. even know arguing days?

He also argued somehow Sweden's fault Danish employers might fire Danish employees visited Sweden, so, know...

Actually, thought processes simple: ""Sweden Bad"". That's it. That's is. rest crocodile tears furious fapping collapse daydreaming. surprising see sort mutation/evolution would win out. Tazz said best... ""We run Sloppy shop."" This. state long reopened continue go where. kids get summer one wear fucking masks. people screaming ""mah freedumbs"" really taken away freedoms us would feel comfortable going back world people wore masks, distanced followed rules. heard saw thought thought 4th july yet tho. Crazy. Exactly, bother? swear, Fauci basically Jesus meme bunch priests telling shut hated speaking truth.

And leadership fucking priests. wanna cry :( I'd like see legit sources(not reddit panic) claiming end humanity. Good you. I've worn masks since late Feb too. Stay safe.  Pressure?

/s feel like chart brings better perspective death trends.  probability happening low nearly meaningless take account political decision. someone told us something like possible! Linked video context. whole point argument misunderstood context Fauci answered reporter saying people walking around wearing masks. laziest, intellectually dishonest argument could prop up. supposed takeaway saying people walking around wearing masks? sitting them? effective walking? Honestly score you? Enlighten please northerners would stop coming Florida would great. roads full NY NJ plates. Please stop vacationing here. 10% tourists wearing masks. Half ones even correctly. Geaux Tigers! dont know downvoted. Small local theaters totally try set similar this. What's testing numbers compared new cases?
Are testing way people therefor get way cases? expected happen back March. done lot could avoided. don’t suddenly work they’re face medical professional. 

I would give mask front line worker day, still infuriates lied it. could started encouraging cloth masks beginning. would happily started wearing one way earlier did. Fever - chills coughin’ hazy. 

Show canceled - crazy. 

Will fever drop? don’t know. 

Ventilator bumpin’ - go. 

Haven’t relevant decades. 


No covid 90s guess AIDS. That’s sounds kinda familiar. Hey, anyone see show HBO called Chernobyl? good show thank god fictional doesn’t represent past current situations. Better avoid next...

*looks watch*

eternity majority people wore masks... sure attached headline. bad headline. Cases bad metric 'shatters records' good language public health crisis. attacking personally seem adamant replying telling think. simply wondering venting frustration. seem attached outcome me.

But anyways let's keep goal post focus. bad article, headline, post. replies sub equally degenerative. Saying things like 'At least America #1 something' 'Good maybe people get serious' etc. etc. sub one big echo chamber bunch people scared feel like agency. understand need best stay calm situations like sensationalize narrative. thought hurricane season over! little, late. ROLL TIDE!!!  #It's best day evvvverrr... wait shit. soon Trump gets bright idea pin whole thing Fauci fire him? ""We would stopped thing day one KOOK doctor OBAMA put charge stuck with!"" I’m sure could. point, 4 weeks schools opening places south... states struggling higher ever numbers. 

If pushed back openings Labor Day STRONG lockdown safety nets (rent/mortgage holiday, sort stimulus money order food pay bills), absolutely required masks contact tracing threat stiff financial penalties jail, could probably it. won’t. Looks like herd immunity back menu thought hurricane season over! Kodak moment hoping for. Yea!!! time, happen nation wide basis.

I'm left wondering happened protecting/honoring everyone's ""Freedom"" ""Rights""?

Hopefully, going turn case little, late.

Also waiting see actual order says, 20 Positive cases? total active? either case, seems like totally arbitrary number, since different counties totally different population densities, order might better saying ""everywhere"" Texas. But, guess pretty much kind statewide mask order better mask order all.

Sigh... math beyond kindergarten level got phone mom hour ago. die-hard conservative Texas pro-mask beginning pandemic. told today stepdad going movies tomorrow. asked please wear mask started spewing every right-wing nonsense Fox News OANN teach base. Anyways, resulted saying need wear one home city ""fine."" 

I asked she'd wear mask Trump governor made wear one paused, eventually saying, ""Yeah, guess."" Well mom, get wear mask. thought hurricane season over! Unfortunately, voting attending church, still wear mask. thought hurricane season over! Keep fingers crossed. Laughed hard I'm crying inside not? 

People sick, dead, mourning tend bad producing goods consuming goods. 

Arguing people economy opposite forces like arguing fuel economy opposite forces. support other. ""Mother...They're making fun again. Please make stop."" Right. whereas he's done ton math even proposed mechanism mind would explain it, mention Nobel Prize, got gut instinct doom here. California getting reamed too, nearly identical new cases, cases per million, deaths per million, per wonder sub talks Florida. be... *gasp*... political bias? sub politicize public health crisis, would it? thought hurricane season over!  lockdown short, done well. *Wheezing chuckles* Deaths still seem decline 🤷‍♂️ Specific numbers tested cases always led thing, no. Singapore spiked thousands cases per day awhile 26 people die total. Yemen ten times deaths never even crack 100 cases. Saudi Arabia cases spiked near 5000 day barely broken 50 deaths single day. Belgium nowhere near case load saw hundreds dying every day month. know well can’t know sure one outbreak worse another based strictly case numbers you’re trying wiggle pinned saying that, case, know sure things worse NY April America’s unwashed penis. Fuck ye- wait. Fuck. good. I'm done feeling bad people give shit. got COVID deathbed relative critical condition? fucking bad stupid selfish cunt that's you. thought hurricane season over! Wow USA better Canada everything He's taking primary money machine putting subpar crappy product decade Whose policy? I’m pretty sure US second highest testing per capita world behind Denmark. could've saved 1000s lives fucking job months ago. Oh wow, thought one! asthma issues go rural hospital (Canada) gave cloth mask upon check in. I’ve lots issues we’re heatwave - cloth, handmade mask much better! thought hurricane season over! would avoid on, I've cut numerous people life harmful selfish actions past years (sad say dad list weeks ago, actually threatened violence simply telling stop sending racist memes Facebook, first time he's even insulted 33 years planet). There's plenty people world worth spending time with. thought hurricane season over! Obviously. rate spread region actually higher spring. 

You meant eradicated, abolished. got meant though. thought hurricane season over! help things though? may make feel better, would likely negative effect. time give old ""We told so"", much deserves April (at least), saying masks worked, protect others wearer (the concept one-way mask). still silent recently masks work extent protect wearer well. 3 min video Dr. Fauci.    people die country collapses COVID could even dream of. That's result economic collapse. Welcome governance. Decision making sometimes unpleasant. Don’t people go Florida retire? This’ll like death sentence many older folks there.. please information. 21-44 age group always given?

## GOING STOP SPREADING LIES DISINFORMATION SWEDEN?

Three days ago - posted [this thread, said: restrictions many countries originally stricter measures. Sweden's herd immunity policy may temporarily granted freedom, appears opposite: NPIs maintained unknown period whereas EU countries returning business usual.TL;DR: Sweden restrictions many countries originally stricter measures.

And reply that, called **YET ANOTHER say ""Sweden restrictions many countries originally stricter measures"" lie. simply case.**  data shows one clear thing - ***as Europe re-opening, European countries moving towards similar strategy Sweden.***

&amp;#x200B;

From thread posted - see **the NPIs place Nordic countries BASICALLY SAME.** outlined case 'forgot' them.

## GOING STOP SPREADING LIES DISINFORMATION SWEDEN?

7. things open rules distance. Amusement parks Legoland Tivoli open extended safety rules. Terrifying true, Dr Gottlieb defiantly knows means (and commented past) Tom Hanks, Kevin Durant Idris Elba it, though Tom Australia.

Edit: pretty sure KD hospitalized though, sure Idris spread slowed grinding halt healthy people human challenge stay home 3 weeks immune system human immune system making terminal vector virus.

The less people able spread it, better outcome vulnerable.

And since 40% asymptomatic hospitalization rate 0.1% 50 (meaning much much lower under) life saving method. also important keeping people dying. Mortality rates aren’t great without health care We've passed 54,000 new cases compared yesterday, according CDC, John's hopkins near 50,600, google statistics almost 53,000. naive, capacity testing many people there. still intention slow spread covid-19, testing many people possible, minimum, everyone symptoms. testing severe cases, testing small fraction population, testing efforts anything slow spread. took long???? past months Half take vaccine, 30% already infected. forget credible reports indicating Florida may trying ""cook books"" under-report infections deaths COVID-19 Indoor bars nightclubs indoor dining still closed. shown massive disease vectors.

But makes think badly southern States things we're seeing reductions based way people really care here. lmao don’t let us isn’t anywhere public go without pants

Have ever San believe every (competent) scientist saying something, everyone knows serious. eh able mandate it.

Morbid Obesity kills 600,000 people every year. scientists said mandating muzzles overweight people would save lives? covfefe? We're sure covid mutating sure get once. Slowing spread makes sense. want America sick regardless. Thousands people crammed hurricane shelters middle pandemic sounds like peak Florida. mean Universal already open..... idk, kinda lost lot respect parks. 

Also shout local water park reopening even though back peak levels! Keep guys! Whitehouse Corona Virus task force? finally put sign office door requesting everyone wear masks

Everyone else developed world March, even offices. really idea. Young people general don’t make decisions regarding future, great looks afford lot preferential treatment. don’t know psychology behind thing. pretty sure trolling.

it's blatantly obvious FL hospital bed / icu graphs hospitals boat. anyone willing admit much actually looking data.

that said, thank service report it, lots idiots gotten arrested coughing things/people licking random objects ""protest virus"" ah yes public health expert 30+ years learned two months successful masks stopping virus. something many Asian communities know age 4. bat boy Fauci. see people wearing mask remember Fauci one started myth work. CLARIFICATION interviewer. ""are sure?"" Even mockingly frightening repeat. Wages need rise support single earner families.... roughly 2% Florida's total COVID deaths point, single day. Nope didn’t support still don’t. 

I basic math. nice try ad hominem attacks. Hey someone say something don’t like, instantly win argument accusing voting wrong guy! Instant win. many deaths? dont seem understand science works either. processes specifically put place people lie wrong. Even scientists. 

And doesnt even account fact guy pressure president known fire anybody doesnt fall line exactly orders do. 

And still find repugnant DEFEND politicians openly lying you. Sure reasonable person would expect it. fact defending actions traitorous democracy itself. USA 

USA

USA

We winning! hope pulls through. drugs prevent people contracting HIV 

130,000 people dead counting, nothing see here. 325 IIRC. article. Dude what. Italy 240 000+ cases. Sweden 70 000+. re-open country still Covid-19 control.Spain,Italy,Netherlands,Belgium Europeans countries shown that.USA failing country failed state day, gonna disappear, like guy said... right? Right? /s going complete opposite. MASSIVE decrease births across world. Nobody bringing children world, good percentage women reproductively (never mind sexually) dysfunctional current climate due group trauma have/are suffering.

I also suspect sales menstrual sanitary products decreased significantly well. hard people understand. alot misinformation spread.

The hurricane excellent metaphor. dont know researchers read bit lately terrifying Im sorry loss.  Kids seem like ultimate asymptomatic carrier can’t see schools stay open like they’re enthusiastically planning fall. Instead, government working tirelessly economic relief package parents shoulder burden. 

We keep pretending isn’t massive, Great Depression level crisis — magical thinking going take bunch people surprise fall. 

Cold Flu season brutal year. imagine plus Coronavirus. It’s going insane. *Kids spread germs readily.* can’t get 40 year olds follow proper protocol, yet expect 1st graders will? planning sacrificing majority older population teachers janitors?

Asymptomatic spread. kids exhibit mild symptoms, unless you’re testing everyone, they’re going spreading silently parents, teachers, kids. Also, low risk != risk. scale, tragic headlines. 

Epidemiologists (and every parent, included) want kids back school. But, can’t wish away reality. Kids human animals. spread virus. may get sick older people, I’ve seen zero evidence spread less readily. assumption going flawed fact — given they’re largely symptomatic — we’re certainly testing kids order magnitude. I'm fucking sick EVERY single issue politicized -- gun control, climate change, education, vaccines, even wearing mask. I'm sick deep political divisions country. Hopefully people already realized that... Positivity 19%. Everywhere else needs fuck start right damn thing. fuckin strictly adhering guidelines lockdown, social distancing, masks months northeast/New England. densest friggin parts damn country we’ve got lowest new cases per capita push back reopening y’all’s state governments cba use damn heads enforce shit. Pain ass swear literally gov set up.

The CDC put recommendations states take want geniuses need science badly 

Have bothered notice exponentially higher amount testing done period. Come people jesus I’m rooting one (and others) vaccine “feels” confident true. 

Quick question: Oxford Vaccine others Phase 1/2/3 once? assume Phase 1 2 complete awaiting data trails? husband lucky enough still jobs throughout pandemic. woman ever-inching towards 40, want another baby cannot. would responsible time pregnancy infant. something makes sad every day.

 hard enough work home, even proper daycare. daycare become unavailable would screwed. employer lenient towards kids home workday public schooling closed. summer requiring anyone children 14 daycare working home. imagine policy apply schools reopen fall, however look. 

There's way could work home watch children time. daycare would mean would quit job, give flexibility work night, weekends, etc. 

Living one income would disastrous family. Even though spend responsibly save can, would serious issues trying make ends meet. close student loans paid still considerable medical debt trying tackle. mortgage pay monthly. need new vehicle would still need able pay food, utilities, medication medical expenses, gas, etc. don’t understand anti mask.. surely mask gives freedom comes anonymity? age phones essentially give us zero privacy big corporations government think people would pro-mask. won’t forever. Mandate public transport atleast like UK did. top head, thought one drugs using mRNA actually approved already. delivery store. use Giant Direct &amp; clean EVERY SINGLE ITEM delivery, every 2 weeks. But, napkins, dish soap, course lysol...limits chicken &amp; sometimes none arrives, etc. see getting worse children home school...but summer vacation &amp; thought now, production would increase w/certain items. scary &amp; different times all..be well~ Dude looks obese me.

So yeah, likely diabetic, hypertensive, chronic inflammation, etc. thoughts assume it’s going adapt human human spread start making vaccine now. Yep. biggest challenge meal times. 

I set specific routines bed time many things. alright long follow routines him, he's flexible entire thing changed. example, sleeps grandma's place, require routine take place. 

Meals hard wants eat things. try blend things pasta sauce example, get exhausting awhile. 

.... also TV. turned show, melt city right now. FUCK FAUCCI LYING FUCK 100,000 cases day population 29 million, would take 232 days hit herd immunity ~80%. 500,000 cases day, would take nearly 45 days. death rate rising lack hospital space, could see 10,000 people dying day rate. math behind absolutely terrifying. I'm sure 75k day actual . experts think real number 10 times reported number. curious get reported number 75k. Except death count movie tens thousands times higher Jaws movies. hope don’t sequel. Tootsie roll pops ice cream cones cut anymore real licksplorers like Previous Thursdays:

June 25: 5,004

June 18: 3,207

June 11: 1,698 yes everyone, congratulating losing today's game 42-0 instead 49-0 like yesterday. like tits Add recent ruling *forces* states give [money religious Suddenly tax dollars earmarked actual public schools standards funneled Devos schools curriculum. Public education crumbles, extremists claim money used properly, defunding even further. Woo, Winter coming! They’re dumb realize NBA What’s point post, higher tomorrow lol. certainly agree families options, also seen lot families complain without even considered ways solve childcare problem.

Families suddenly saving 2.5k per month daycare costs, even considered using money babysitter, home daycare, nanny share, staggering work hours, teaming another family share duties, etc..

We got screwed childcare plans covid solution ended actually cheaper before, still allweod us work uninterruptedly. God must day :( government certainly ask information. murky part happens citizens comply. punishments state enforce someone comply.  Agreed least owning We're coming Mitch. hard pressure be, please stay home. interested shitty troll are. Decided take peek. Pretty gross stuff, really. 

Saw yet another garbage posts, decided jump in. 

Feel free ignore don’t like. I’m strong enough yeet you, think gently toss sun. really are. expect magical authoritative body much power actually  ikr. joking yesterday buy beds, thats literally they're saying, ""stay calm, add beds"". Right. know expectation except minimize liability provide public face (the empty middle seat plane). know strict early elementary kids can't controlled way. 

I wish better science contagion risk bunch five year olds. Isn’t neat? major scientific accomplishment Yea looks like 35k tests yesterday. literally half.  wait UBI runs weeks, going hungry ppl streets. USA handling worse. Look graphs tell better are. population 400 million It’s definition manslaughter. Yeah, friend prosecuted. Every dumbass KNOWS infected goes public anyways locked up. sucks still first steps. People still wear see properly enforced wear correctly. (cover fucking nose ffs, lol) line

The president rush out, harm people. I'm making humble prediction history rhyme: others beta test one. alone Congrats hillbillies  use metric spell ""colour"".

I'm beginning believe Europe 🤔 realize expecting know knew right? said confirmed evidence human transmission, true. confirmed, (some) countries reacted. 

It's WHO's fault countries (America, Brazil, India) absolutely shit job stopping transmission compared countries (China, Europe, Asia). WHO's fault nobody paid attention outbreaks (and late). Everyone outside Asia thought ""Oh, China,"" ""oh, Italy,"" ""oh, Europe"". \#Winning Oh god another protest theorist.

It’s posted times recall sub protests barely made dent cases.

NY protests, where’s massive increase cases?

Majority protestors wearing masks outdoors. proven dramatically reduce infection rates.

Conversely sitting bar, mask, crowded people, dramatically increases risk.

But that’s ok, go right ahead blame demographic want discriminate against. say, may huge factor, something probably taken account portion 18-29 year olds work service industries retail. restaurants bars (and stores in-store sales) reopening around country, would definitely expect see uptick infections among work closely unmasked public. people generally tend skew younger. 

I absolutely hard data could help prove it’s true, feel like odds may factor. really bad others suggested, long tested someone competent.

It's uncomfortable anything else experience throughout day would completely forget five minutes happened. Great question. One pondered time journalist working remarkable story.  think best give time take break.  become cliche, really marathon, sprint.  -- based upon what's happening TX AZ, example, still months go. Rely support systems.  Take care yourself. hesitate take day (if can)... actively encouraged staff that.  need time away -- Chris Vanderveen Southwest airlines flight Orlando bunch moms wearing Mickey ears? almost like we'll watching Darwinism happen live. present abject chaos?

""We can't combat pandemic else things continue spiral control"" compelling argument things presently spinning wildly control.""

Another shutdown going make present disaster worse. However, may thing make things better.

Indeed, looking experts state, consensus appears agree position. Leaders states like Arizona Texas new shutdowns, even though ideologically opposed them.

The economy never recover still pandemic. bet least half idiots complaining bother wearing mask, social distancing etc.. RemindMe! 7 days outsider doesn’t give shit nba theme parks - it’s ok. Jesus take wheel could smell headache congestion Day 1 noticed symptoms, got tested Day 3 answered smelling problems question, smell taste went day 5, day 7 said headache mostly gone still smell. Italy shutdown preemptively instead response possible worst case scenario. Italy slightly populous California. US much larger, places close Italian levels shutdown Seattle maybe New York. Even bad Texas now, it’s still 1/3 cases per capita New York.

It would better less disruptive shorter rolling shutdowns. father died takes longer 4 days starve death. IV fluids took 31 days. law allow euthanized goes people’s religious beliefs starve death. Weirdly, observation, anti-vaxxers started left, co-opted right, visible anti-vaxxers seem overwhelmingly right.

Of things co-opt. evidence face shields provide barrier protection efficacy protecting wearer droplets getting cover portals entry (mouth, eyes, nose). Whether offer protection droplets getting (protect others) well established.

Face shields offer number advantages. medical masks limited durability little potential reprocessing, face shields reused indefinitely easily cleaned soap water, common household disinfectants. comfortable wear, protect portals viral entry, reduce potential autoinoculation preventing wearer touching face. People wearing medical masks often remove communicate others around them; necessary face shields. use face shield also reminder maintain social distancing, allows visibility facial expressions lip movements speech perception.

Most important, face shields appear significantly reduce amount inhalation exposure influenza virus, another droplet-spread respiratory virus. read Kohli agenda painfully transparent. definitely plan medical help would consider “control” group. would say rest us positions we’re planning children necessarily right now. 

The best thing we’ve discussed kids age us still getting together nice. 16,662 number new cases last 24 hours Florida end unless US locks completely 4-6 weeks. Would require National Guard patrolling streets, delivering supplies, transportation ill doctor. But....as Exceptional Americans, something like this, would bring shit close, would never happen. thing Disney parks though...Disney create tourism massive airport travel families. Universal close near Disney. one flying across country Universal. Disney really needs think could possibly things level. still starve him. Native Floridian here... fuck, guys? awful. they're still gonna open school *and* Disney World?? usually try first? read headline?

COVID-19 causes fear causes go hospital causes die.

COVID-19 cause. winning? Thanks. Updated it. Right Live? - Drake disapproval

Right Die? - Drake acceptance mountaineering, that's called false summit. Camps/educational daycare programs (many collaborate schools continue various aspects learning development).

When kid, dad worked mom home, home time school. hardly realistic huge majority families days. Remind Trump everyone tested meets them, probably receiving prophylactic Covid antibodies. conspiracy theories. favorite idea masks actually spread disease infected virus anyone puts mask gets disease. Perhaps outlandish flat earth society, getting there. Thank answering! Yes, get really neat sticker stethoscope. :)

If may paraphrase, saying moved goal-posts? helping cancer treatment, listened doctor said chemo side effects. Trust completely regret making wear mask around us. think would happen us 3 months stayed wore masks whenever leave happened. Toronto also Scotiabank Arena basketball, NHL already planning use *their* hub rink. NY, grocery store back normal well stocked everything. parents Maine still issues finding certain things Maine. depends guess. definitely didn’t mean imply don’t think don’t take seriously personally. guess main question is, go store mask? invited party 20 people would go? Would wear mask there?

My point is, even though peoples risk lower hard find line. Let’s say one people 20 person party spent time barhopping larger Kentucky city brought small local gathering.

Believe me, it’s fun wearing mask don’t want don’t like seeing people sooner everyone gets board takes seriously sooner get go back normal. normal means jobs back economy back parties sports everything else. think able use nuance understand big difference visiting family gathering larger, risky, situations. never complete elimination risk. risk mitigation. partial story.

When closed down, many unnecessary exemptions. meant still spreading virus much time reopened. 

We reopened virus still endemic communities easy hop back exponential growth train.

[Disclaimer pretty much always true.

Far tell Chicago, combined income least $200k kid really fucking dumb idea financially quality life-wise. Well shoot friend may gone restaurants, bars, stores without mask. way stop people. Well, whoever runs preschool running business, charity. stands assume owner taking balance income. party employees enough retain them, sure there’s profit-sharing business like that. insight Dr. Samet’s COVID model Colorado consistently one dire predictions state [been one least accurate easier personal exchanges say social media (as know well) love de-escalation almost situations, long mean diluting going back well-thought position. go GOP puts profit life One particularly aspect problem folks without kids realizing situation where, traditionally, grandparents would step shoulder much burden caring youngest generation. true many cultures, America.

What makes virus unique 
a) children largely asymptomatic carriers 
b) children naturally superspreaders 
c) many grandparents co-morbidities.

So pressure release valve family nearby, necessarily cannot be. lot memories college memories packed places around people like sardines. Dorms, bars, parties, name it. It’s often crowded, especially football season. It’s gonna get worse campuses allowing everyone come back. agree everyone took lockdown seriously states reopen early would need 2nd lockdown. impression general US public see ""pointless"" ""unnecessary"" since first lockdown ""nothing"". Yeah think whatever season looks like, played front empty stands. back. forget switch accounts time. Beaches outdoors yet already shutdown responsible leaders. 

Stadiums concerts mostly outdoors yet one advocating open up. 

The “it’s fine, it’s outdoors” argument goes window density individuals present sufficiently high. mention area arguably worst world virus. don’t need giving cops power though hope read comments below. Oh, infected everyone else party? read infected party. read articles headline looks fake that's read one. treat dickheads like enemy collaborators fucking insane many new cases everyday basically everywhere glad testing slowed down.  Please note countries complain severely infringed citizens civil rights freedoms.
These people live knowledge government moment end pretty much everything previously took granted.
In Sweden freedom gone stronger use episode springboard citizens rights. US bad day Elon Musk giving US good news like Tesla SpaceX safe cut 3M P95 filter disks smaller pierces custom masks? Absolutely. appearances. Compromise. 

We know, sure. gordian knot sword ($$$$).  Staying home ordering much junk Amazon different socially irresponsible potentially getting people sick kind understanding everyone virus-free attend party middle pandemic? can't imagine anyone winning case like this. Bad decisions made everyone. nothing stop Desantis keeping state open business. live ""up north"" (at least definition) neighborhood bars PACKED every night. worrying.  add that, wouldn’t surprised many teachers simply resign citing health concerns families. point schools even run know? Hey people denial land, welcome reality. IIRC apply covid patients patients come needing critical care. 60 get car accident, stroke, heart attack may wrong end abacus. painful truth virus. Yes, survive fine can't get Tuesday! health care system set this, wear damn mask. acknowledge national shutdown never happened?

Awesome, thanks! work hospital conglomerate state Florida.

And, without doxing source, involved. problem child care bubble decades.

What gets day care cost much. know people drop $1000/kid/month daycare. kids two teachers per like 15 kids. $15k month place raking in, think ""teachers"" get paid $15-20/hr. $20/hr still $7k additional income daycare facility. Someone making bank. Also true pretty sure law defines gathering is, random people streets qualify definition. Well Florida. Per capita 2 times worse cases California today. Great comment!  Interesting show photo beach thousands took streets crowded protests/riots 2–3 weeks ago. shocker cases went up?Many wearing masks yelling spreading saliva. thy Dipika didn’t keep distance. Somehow feel might caused cases group less 10 beach.  Usually takes refrigerated trailers parked outside hospitals excess morgues wake people F UP! doctor informed Melissa decision withhold care “what feel best along state, decided,” “this decision medical community state.” ""democracy"" looks like, I'd rather not. Military member here.. Texas unfortunately lot training bases take recruits country stay open personnel get quarantined arrival 2-3 weeks. military members Texas forbidden go bars/restaurants/protests/parties etc. since March. Health officials seemingly always back mask mandates politicians seem issue them. Vote B E N (need avoid automod) vote ballot races. Every vote counts. turns ""they counting everything. get hit bus? Covid must counted."" 

Sadly lot people going take losing someone damn near get it. number studies there. goto page ""ballpark"" really doesn’t. think everyone panicking right now. need remember science-based issue. doesn’t need political emotional. It’s possible compassionate conversation someone help address concerns reputable sources backing Texas. unlikely change plans.

And number parents complaining cant handle home kids longer astonishing me. kids cant stand around them? talks, stories acts behind closed doors, I've come believe ""reading deficiency""-theory. Basically, Trump read, extremely uncomfortable it, point able comprehend meaning reading something like teleprompter. 

That kind contradicted Hitler's speeches-story. again, stories ""art deal""-ghostwriter time also support theory. possible something book made go extra-mile. shutting everything virus 99.7% survival rate?

Why state parks close?

Why farmers markets close target taco bell deemed essential?

Why protests glorified, going walk friends villified? Considering original poster obvious agenda, considering scientist roundly debunked others due basic mathematical errors work, think sort openly political bullshit belongs serious discussion disease.

At best, people understand maths come away article thinking situation less serious, act ways spread disease. Walton County, GA trying best catch you. one Monroe Loganville wears masks public. Keep mind total deaths United States 28% higher predicted adjusted COVID-19 deaths. numbers lower bounds. would rather someone job enough self awareness call idiot fucks someone else maybe can't admit mistakes. it! ""perfect time baby"" myth, lol. one got right. NPR spent half day repeating it.

I mean, probably find local paper questioned it, best ""silver lining"" good news gotten months, course everyone ran it. insane numbers. Also states getting new cases people going vacation hotspot states. Getting outta hand.... number newly infected exploded last week (for two months usually less 50 new cases country, curfew). 

The main difference people infected young adults, people symptoms spike began university dorms parties.

Therefore, government concluded (probably) need new curfew, want seal capital want students coming out, outbreak spread areas country.

We're basically becoming new Wuhan. Basically endless Show Tell smells like sweat, brisket, gunsmoke. Hello, also live Colorado. I’m obese I’m also young 18 years old. likely survive covid likely die? Also would safe travel around Denver days 4th July public transport social distance, sanitize hands wear mask? qualified good news good they're easing way high barriers entry foreign HCWs faced. what's good news numbers shortages, wtf. idea bad: 

The excuse given post. customer unhappy menu wrong third-party call complain restaurant. delivery late call complain restaurant. Delivery drivers act poorly irritate regular take-out customers need soothed. 

I know anyone restaurant industry thinks third party delivery good thing. still know people think big deal.  refuse party this.   big carrot hurt someone really badly used improperly.

Sit softly carry big carrot. Depends pay monthly once. refunding pre-paid, believe. I'm monthly pass charged months parks closed. Plus stuck space significant months end much good relationships imagine. midsize city ~100,000 FINALLY mandated masks today next 30 days vote 5-2. Last week, even motion bring vote table. We're Tampa Orlando ICU beds. I'd say can't believe took long vote masks Florida, so.... virus care math Mexico rough time right now. would say people San Diego OK job masks, least located. takes couple assholes ruin though. Everyone flocking weekend, hope Gov calls entire state. Otherwise going shit show. That's national lockdown then. But...vaccines faith based? course show anything, likely it. odd dealing polio anymore right, must *faith* vaccine, actual vaccine itself. whooping cough, measles, mumps, tetanus? guess hoax's vaccines work either? 


I'm rushed vaccines first wave vaccines crazy record pacing without time trials behind it. 


**However**, one big important fact **YOU** getting sick **DOES** affect me/other citizens around you. talking like ""Oh worry guys, gets me, i'll accept whatever get"" something can/will likely spread someone get it....But, love thy neighbor right? Pretty much, yeah.

If waited ""all clear"" release, fine. Naked cynicism reveals true Repugnican. original start date too, moved back week 17th. “It’S tHeyRe tEsTInG MoAR!!!!” -GOP party line remember first cases hit US wife said avoid crowds thought paranoid. never live one down. category putting in? making assumptions am? Read article, happened back early June. may case today, hospitals tons excess capacity Texas early June. haha yeah cut ties friend want visit mother. epic reddit moment, major red flag OP! 3 different strains. Wuhan one far less deadly.

The Italian one brazilian thought wanted estimate case numbers case need know DIRECTLY caused Covid. Bahaha. hilarious. ""Me smarter den yew, can't form opinion social media spoon feed me, pay attention science! smurt! Merica bad dey dumb, waah.""

Idk get feeling superiority, there, clearly worse am. 

We actually live *among* people anti-intellectual racist live entirely broken system. people like say we're proving stupid docile rest world is. ""I rEaD ReUTerS"". Gtfo, dumbass. Yeah. statement partially dumb fucks can’t get wear mask. really didn’t think consequences words. Words difference life death. Ooh, wanna know makes country look *worse?*

The fact *Norwegian* articles apparently present high degree facts figures *Swedish* articles do.

Honestly, go ahead try find Norwegian article gives straight, I've seen, don't. beginning dawn seem prefer post Swedish articles Nordic alternatives, that's factual quality provide. 

The one thing take away article posted Norway *major* shortage *for ages*. Good. states this. Nope - ward state involved state decision making. Ignorance finest Number actually 14.5 percent positive , still pretty high job requires the. employees required fill questionnaire every morning leave work. I'm sure people fill form actually take temperature. Thank Chinese friends. know possibly Navajo peoples may descended Mongolia eons ago landbridge.. seems unlikely. sure 37 median age tested positive? Everywhere world underreported extent. Likely yes United States also. Italy, Spain, UK, USA, Iran, etc seeing high excess mortality that's probably covid. may deaths people seeking care due fear virus also. Can't attribute cases higher excess mortality virus frustrating! Deaths lag course. people ignorant? mask wearing become stupid culture war political issue? rush reopen economy save economy pretty much every economist agrees actually dealing pandemic would less damaging?

I remember saying back January big deal. know deal infections diseases. Contact tracing, isolation/quarantine, etc. Seems worked many countries.

(Note: USian, US adjacent. Rooting guys, please get control). lockdown time, much done prepare nation unlock, testing labs, hospitals hotspots resources things properly prepared time, see result, 6 lakh cases counting

There 1 testing lab Jan 2020 handling Covid 19 cases, 1065. India produced 40000 PPE per year coronavirus crisis, producing 3 lakh PPE per DAY. even know talking repeating regurgitated BS internet easily disproved? Florida protests big? watching counties st Loius, Minneapolis, Seattle, Portland, Denver. . dont recall seeing news huge protests Florida. Reuters article appears primary source news. Please consider upvoting post, posts linking Reuters article, instead posts news sites citing Reuters story. Primary sources get page views work. number reported deaths Florida residents increased 67 3,617. best numbers. number 1 numbers world. Eh seriously 2 mins suck, alright, tough guy!! Problem USA half people want listen PrEsIdEnT half proud rights wear mask stay home. That’s decide lifting restrictions “green light”. Nobody said that, friends attending parties, I. 

We responsible actions, keeping others safe, regardless governments do. go out.

Stay home. serious boomer rumour bullshit.

It's exactly sort low information nonsense goes viral among idiots. ever stared like that? I’m Midwest, you’re kinda asking trouble that. trying badass anything it’s true. Homer Bart: That's highest record *so far* Ok skippy. 

Run along 

School happening planet too
Soon enough. 

Football season gonna great too. LOCK UP! LOCK UP! Fortunately, found thing act limit it… wont intimidate one. still think ppl Florida still go partying weekend July 4th.. think they'll probably given outrage cases recently imporated Sweden Norway healthcare context: we'll see. over

Will ever be? could still even 10 years arguing masks shutting bars every months ICUs start filling again.

This thing going magically disappear. I've learned hatred state Florida justified. 15k cases could happen next week - July 4th clusterfuck Died next day? Seems suspicious. thought people don’t even show symptoms weeks after? Congrats! live country 300 million. absolutely way make sure zero wackos. ALWAYS exist. Take comfort fact zealous weirdos tiny tiny minority. reason let people take RAM head. said *at least* 
I'm also assuming parents choose send kids back classroom Yeah try saving enough house right $60K year. Especially live expensive area. u invested 130 bucks u would also got test NRW. Pecuniam non olet.

AFAIK health care offices test asymptomatic contacts least once, didnt beginning pandemic.  Uh... realise COVID long term effects health, right? wait July 4th... What's median age overall? Yeah, Goldman Sachs NYC infected country rest country punt back NYC eventually. PPP hasn’t expired yet. Wait free cash gone see numbers. Companies employees burning cash reserves. NEAR 250k

It's pretty much universally agreed. Please look chart history IHME site linked, including methodology.  
 
You also calculation quite simply yourself. IFR well established 0.4% 0.9%. Divide 2500 deaths per day IFR get true infections. rate 14.6% vs 15% yesterday

Percent positive slightly dropping (still bad though), indicates must fuckton tests done reach 10k cases.

Edit: saying 70k tests, shattering old record 60k. actually shows resign. vastly underfunded underpaid school districts teachers.

What's right amount funding?

How much correct amount pay teacher?

I high school teacher quipped us could teach us physics slate chalkboard hay loft. fancy facility required good education.

There definitely poorer areas derth property tax revenue whose facilities need help, I'm 37 listened fact teachers ""underpaid"" literally entire life. Even teachers get raises, get used new normal ask more. mother teacher 25 years retired couple years ago. heard details union machinations. constant matter ""how much get away raising property taxes area without getting school budget voted down?""

The core issue adults typically working outside home, school become education, become primary free daycare children age 5. taken away, what? problem even study article quotes state anything sort. viruses lower physical distancing 1 more, compared distance less 1 (n=10 736, pooled adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0·18, 95% CI 0·09 0·38; risk difference [RD] −10·2%, 95% CI −11·5 −7·5; moderate certainty); protection increased distance lengthened (change relative risk [RR] 2·02 per m; pinteraction=0·041; moderate certainty). Face mask use could result large reduction risk infection (n=2647; aOR 0·15, 95% CI 0·07 0·34, RD −14·3%, −15·9 −10·7; low certainty), stronger associations N95 similar respirators compared disposable surgical masks similar (eg, reusable 12–16-layer cotton masks; pinteraction=0·090; posterior probability low certainty).

Facemasks **could** help study show that. Distance case main factor. Sick. Well, fucking shit. New Zealand’s lockdown, Clark twice discovered breaching strict stay-at-home rules; going mountain biking, second time took family beach trip 23km Dunedin home.

What truly wild concept.

We usually reward idiots promotions re-elections. say anything 10-60k BLM protestors screaming hours standing shoulder shoulder. Perhaps masks made pubis work :(

i got nose cauterized bunch times kid, wondering felt similar Dumbest first world nation planet.

For anyone chooses downvote, show another one *is* dumber US? There's fair amount already like New York Times one. partial one  actively look reliable COVID news, pretty much ignorant it. media downplaying start, friends watch Fox News guess they're doomed ignorance.  Well, course. guess mean middle class folks may feel biggest hit, makes sense. Probably I'm sure properly explain thoughts this. &amp; infecting others! literally planned beach protest today mask mandate set certain florida counties. 

It's sad say, amount people still believe hoax staggering...there new, ""Moving goalpost headline"" is, ""well deaths down, even though cases up..""....just completely ignorant people. never claimed weren't. compare people fighting civil rights people getting drunk friends detached reality almost seems satirical dry defend parties pointing protests.

Not mention people complaining protests spreading virus ones either marched supported stormed state capitals reopen businesses months ago. starting? like Canada months.

Godspeed, Florida. Hate downer short term June influence fading conditions turning perfect hurricanes July, still typically hugely active month. make sense unless assume young people make disproportionately high amount people hospitals ventilators. anything, actually opposite: elderly ventilators. wear cloth mask, every breath flows sides.

OMG! choked coffee. Thanks laugh! still bunch work. mean truly trivial. Something house less 10 minutes cheap (preferably free).

The downsides getting tested pretty significant, get positive self-quarantine harder before, contact tracing. It’s pretty daunting. 

Add even appearance difficulty getting test, lots people pass, “ignorance bliss,” were.

We need lower cost taking test drastically. suspect people super cheap in-home test wouldn’t gone party. downside we, society, wouldn’t know it, they’re likely tell anyone due costs. Still, someone knowing electing right thing better someone knowing taking actions don’t.  Right?

Clear agenda. worry y'all, I'm sure we'll plenty funding in-person learning able follow guidelines keep kids safe! trusted news how? News never said over.

Take love affair Adams somehwere else loon  feel woozy reading headline like this. Viscerally shocking poorly we’re doing. think previous poster talking people Covid 19 know it. sure suppose leave house anymore anywhere Europe even masks matter symptoms not. Covid 19 diagnosis means quarantine home. suggest read post again, carefully, ask exactly arguing about. parents throwing fit it, least district. want kids back school full time.

Honestly, don’t love teaching remotely. I’d love go back, really aren’t whole lot keep school environment safe. There’s lot talk low danger children, almost none risk teachers adults working school. It’s pretty gross. think need bring Fox News folks manslaughter.  came from. CHI. NA. remove beds lol, patients given ICU treatment right now. clear data source using updated reflect changes 2018.
 
There alternatives. needed intubated. addition, would needed Remdesivir. Since going intubated, pointless administer drug. complete non story. Seems logical - clearly US defeated virus, cases reported! working door dash 2 kids say wise. Stay inside afraid corona. Can't second wave everyone gets first wave! Herd immunity Florida confirmed. DeSantis insane people living equally insane. cant get Covid freeway.

Maybe can't. Americans discipline avoid stopping lunch use bathroom. known 100 years. That's regulatory agencies exist (although gutted subjected regulatory capture current administration). cases asymptomatic. permanent permanent.

Notice use word 'may'. – first wave never ended 

What novel concept, heard *again again* last two weeks. interpret saying everything right. perhaps it’s bad thought. There’s difference.

I got yo Dallas Cowboys facemasks. 'Remember Alamo' facemasks. Texas flag musket facemasks. I'm guessing what's slowing spread people trusting reopening. takes longer ramp potential case chance situation similar lockdown. Expect jump way higher California’s big counties haven’t even reported yet there's vaccine within next months, **this** literally way move forward, like not. People going stay confined homes indefinitely, economy can't stay holding pattern forever.  Lol assuming stopped lumping antibody tests diagnostic testing. us, smart enough changed plans Also shields. eh. nuance. comes greedy companies trying maximize profits. profit health care companies make tons money every step way profits siphoned off.

There's perverse idea companies beholden maximize profits shareholders charge maximum market bear. leads things like crazy high healthcare costs companies really bad sick day policies. Even pandemic mitch mcconnell argued temporary sick leave everyone ""it would set bad precedent"".

It's profits externalized costs ignored. care peoples health, environment, impacts society, etc. unless reflected balance sheet.

Why americans banded together demand universal healthcare? Media constantly pushes anti-freeloader message. tell people government going take money away give someone else something free, lose mind. Funny guarantee they’re ones yelling “all lives matter”. guess Speed Run now? right? like, F it..its like GTA driving one mission other, peacefully, like clip pedestrian, get 1 star...then bump cop car, get 2 stars..then F it, WW3 ON! end army chasing tanks.


This kinda US handled this. Yep. country. working 72 hour weeks, insurance benefits provided employer. wife got married could get health insurance. ‘Murica ! 🤷‍♂️ mean that’s simply true. 150 million people speak Indian English.

That's they're closing bars restaurants back down.    
I think nursing homes going address ventilation. There's another Petri dish. convince DeSantis admit wrong back reopening.

Am supposed connect dots easily irritable? Well have. apparently connected dots see asking rhetorical question. I'm implying childish getting petulant simple clarification. hope school taught scientists calm unethical scientist lie, also irresponsible imo speaking technical jarson average joe expect understand perfectly. ""there's evidence happening"" worded differently yet carry meaning includes ""we know"", ""more research needed"", ""we enough evidence draw conclusion yet"".

Which average joe talking to? talking media, average joe. saying scientists use scientific terms science journalists?

And really studying scientist, know ""there's evidence happening"" different ""we know"". papers read end ""more research needed"" ""we find evidence x""? think conclusion papers ""we know""? Obviously not. ""I wish dick news""

Health dot com: got fam Sarasota full old ppl would destroyed em Nah, another riddle governor. Fuck that, I'm glad he's saying shit. want actually something.

This lead large scale private sector office work well public sector work readily available career minded upper/middle class women.

I disagree. want raise children without able guarantee life free needing work, think jobs quality— persist using outdated socioeconomic system, instead introducing UBI— exist 2050s. time, want raise kids think they're better people they're luckier. goal, view, raise middle-class surprise around 21 news that, ever want stop working someone else—which usually means wasting life day time— Adversity teaching tool gives us opportunity become better, resilient people.

It is, there's plenty life that's difficult without added, useless misery inflicted socioeconomic system. people strong suffered lot, suspect would still strong they'd reasonable lives. Extreme privilege often corrupts people— especially insofar exposes horrible people top society— think moderate privilege think irresponsible raise kids never work - puts far touch reality.

This think important, ideal, raise rich kids... thinking middle class, make clear they're luckier people, inherently better. also want make sure work hard school develop work ethic— become degenerate freed need work. work evil; work essential mental health. needing work puts position take terrible jobs ruin health end career— rich kids, option say jobs available garbage, certain advantage.

**Just pointing bad behavior alone make stop** think point question (from tell news coverage) left leaning people politicians pushing preventative measures covid makes odd places high liberal population experiencing 2nd waves. ones saying immoral. It’s saying people choice. parents want work cool, shouldn’t mando parents work full time scrap by.  summer. Time go back constituency rub shoulders, share laugh cough supporters. See congressman fall? That's money made though. Disney already money annual passes. 

They need see much actually spend get there. spend retail food Disney might shut consider worth open further. Even seasonal habits places severe unpleasant weather spiking right now.

Turns voting protesting low risk precautions taken. proof? question. I'm really confused case count (just looking United States) dramatically yet death trend steady, constant decline. understand death might come later, like 3-4 weeks infection detected (lagging indicator). trends seems defy eachother. testing better detecting cases, earlier, getting better outcomes? recent spike younger people better survival rate? better treating we've got mature process data handle it?

It's tough look infections get horribly scary view. Yet look deaths, different story. Hard reconcile, seems like Covid-skeptics focus one Covid-cautious (to remove political references) seem key one support whatever story they're looking tell. Sorry wording, trying impartial last part. positive spin potential show world democracy really works. vote trump completely change direction, would instantly reminder importance democracy people change direction country.

He's going ""prey"" away. it’s state sanctioned medicalized murder probably even always personally thot numbers kind better side. Irl get much worse. figures probably account extreem, excessive urge American people seem group together huge crowds masks on... 

Its almost like. Less public gatherings would happened non covid USA current timeline... like, outsider, competition see bad pandemic really get.. Daycare opened month ago live. shocking, guess, live shows like going run, given want avoid crowds congregating. I’m waiting start seeing wearing masks like Lone Ranger - across eyeballs. did, closed soon spread started happen them. That's boner bonus! I'm sure everyone competing new high score 4th July weekend... 1 10 wearing masks despite business doors saying must wear mask. Restaurants completely full. go amazed cavalier workers guests were.

I'm traveling San Antonio say worse Texas. That's true revise opinion new information comes light.

I’ve also saying months, based US taking real action Jan Feb prepare, fully expect see many flights healthcare workers around world coming USA help. 

I got much shit downvotes saying back Feb March, man, it’s crystal clear headed US (someone) failed take absolute massive action protect us. 

The USA going need outside help - lots it, especially winter. We’re even 5% prepared. could 100% prepared. Missed opportunity every level. freaking sad. thing find ""masks useless"" ""right people walking around w/ masks. may make people feel better, might even block droplet providing perfect protection people think is.. Often unintended consequences. People fiddle it... ... right **people thinking healthcare providers needing them** people ill""

So study shows helps thought prevention, main statement necessary ""right now"" mentions twice. sick healthcare workers (when supply low infection low).

*Note: quickly transcribed video best could, verbatim pretty close. They're pushing want money in-person ""experience."" give game early demands refunds etc Healthcare workers volunteer Arizona. Come California. 

Let asshole face wrath constituents That's great motto live by. ^/s way feeling makes human, also really great humans! everyone even half decent humans two would living paradise. Thanks. think correct. would nice state reported real fucking numbers instead artificially low numbers make try look better. shame USA that, understand supply problems. However, homemade cotton masks suggested alternative surgical masks early on. Canada, many people businesses making them. remember entire workplace making us wear fabric masks back March, donated community. efficacy cotton known quite number years. June 30th, NIST study showing cotton masks may fact offer better protection spreading virus synthetic masks well, disaster could lot less painful US population.

Now, unfortunately, seems past point they'll able get majority people wearing unless drastic measures taken federal local levels mandate wearing them. get, someone USA, little people seem care...how people seem grasp bad (and virus, everything occurred Trump administration) going country long run - socially, politically, philosophically, morally, economically USA global stage eyes rest world. feels like beginning end USA. accurate covid antibody testing? work medical field hear wildly inaccurate are? impossible see real options going anyone can't sustain sort work-from-home option able balance home remote learning (or one aspect hold regular job).

And parents kindergartner finish year home learning two 15-minute classroom interactions day (no sessions Fridays), way kids going getting nearly level education (not mention socialization) remote learning. even best options working parents, think we're looking real year stifled development anyone kids. older are, higher risk complications needing ICU care. However unfortunately, saw Italy, hospital beds capacity, need (i.e. older patients) ones doctors decide use on, prognosis worse younger. terrible situation horrible position doctor find in. So, reason, need everything prevent us reaching hospital capacity.

-Dr. Kohli Love spread disease easily tourism think colleges afraid of. waiting long announce plans, want students withdraw take year off. Hell yeah, progress!

Did stop ""light therapy"" too, though? think great idea, especially hard right organize covid. want go finding new families, know doing, maybe families friends live close by. Honestly, think need move back society whole, otherwise things going keep getting worse families, make cultural shift questions (and answer, ideas). force states give money religious schools, forces treat private schools regardless whether they're religious. 

If state give money financial aid private schools, give money religious schools. 

The easy solution stop giving money private schools, done anyway. I'm agreeing happening Texas states hospitals run ICU beds forced triage. think pols charge clearly knew would happen prosecuted willful criminal negligence stripped jobs proven dangerously incompetent at! do, governor Abbott Texas (which similar troubles) R next name mansion tours cancelled COVID.

Like 80% hospitals reporting ""less 10 available ICU beds"" Desantis says Florida Stage 2 though, right? thought read news, he's basically making things up... ? cities schools stages? major Asian countries routinely wear masks social distancing possible. see many masks rural parts countries. that, they’re expecting make hefty amount money NBA. would worth keep parks closed specifically keep contract alive. I'm sorry hear this. Must traumatic, hope OK! agree. virus numbers rise post-4th July, cause bunch new shutdowns schools/universities. think school opens shutdown finish term. Fauci predicting 100k cases per day makes sense... People don’t understand either. People try charging 200 week per child, that’s child watch.

Lol wonder government declared obesity Mexico epidemiological emergency. wonder Mexico one hardest hit countries despite relatively young population. middle crisis. Feels like it’s way long time Covid exacerbated it. anyways, Disney problem. It’s enough anymore. saying “wear masks wash hands social distance” since thing began. government NEEDS step something.

In otherwords, Op friends, lying current situation, rightfully called out, regardless political bend. Thanks question... do, journalist want data. want see ICU utilization(CO post that). want see many people getting retested. want see better death data (specific ages) .  think made progress CDPHE trying get better data (it took long time hospitalizations become public... fought that), need always want (more data = better picture what's going on) 

&amp;#x200B;

as CDPHE areas rising... try this...  Literally one saw coming. shocked say, shocked. /s happens anyway. Well throw river. looks california btw Yep, good number small ones never any, there's big numbers filled beds get first open one Lol that's awesome cuz universal empty normal day social distancing problem daily deaths low (~70)? NY peak 1k deaths per day. get officially FL daily deaths count reported much?? idea Hooters still existed tbh Exactly, something shooting for...thousands people would needlessly die get point... One biggest barriers privacy concerns using technology whether American people would allow type surveillance phones/devices.

-Dr. Kohli sounds like heard lot things 25 years yet failed listen. also false entirely call conservative/ liberal dichotomy. 

it intention imply conservative/ liberal dichotomy. answering question gotten bad Los Angeles. america, part freedom freedom moron. live SoCal speak see here, try florida nyc texas. Without getting locations denominations, would convince people say pro life (but say, dehumamize like) hypocrites best, truly understand ramifications pro life? Coronavirus killed 500,000 people far. We're halfway year, Coronavirus continues pace kill 1,000,000 people. I'm pretty sure 1 million 600,000 Again, slight decrease positivity DOUBLED testing horrible sign lol. quite simple understand.  driven lake Elsinore recently, masks ranking states per capita deaths: Sorry say completely wrong. college program Disney HORDES adults obsessed it, wanting get back asap without concern public health. think percentage people dragged insanely small considering costs. maybe, many deaths day US two weeks then? many seeing early April? Miami-Dade still Stage 1. believe Broward too. move along rest Florida bc highest cases. 24/115=.20 20%

But accept 16% could official number. 1 5 1 6 still really high. safe! “Sport” “Skippy” taking advice Pence, think found boomer. That’s *INSANE*. I’m sorry. Michigan one highest unemployment rates nation. People get scared running money. justification bringing guns capital, dismissing protest haircuts grossly ignorant. 10x many infections confirmed getting closer identifying every case (though never every case).

Almost us get Covid 19 over.

Get exercise understand 40 99.9% chance surviving. it, gang! Lmao I'm Ontario, Canada getting 1-200 cases day. thought indoor dining open insane me.

We opened back indoor dining week Ireland, ~10 cases day. yeah, they've limited take away since March. crazy see ""We lock redudcing capacity 25-50%!""

That's lockdown. Thats yet half-assing it. Good luck! Wish best  I'm interested. lot ways, one use wave description explain corona virus stuff. One start #FlattenTheCurve, used exactly wave picture famous graphic.

I think wave picture particularly useful explain pandemic across world United State. One use it, fun, tell anything.

The wave picture useful explain one expects second wave fall/winter comparable one already occurred last winter/spring. useful part explain one expects stuff get bad fall/winter due to:
- Lower temperatures better spread virus air
- Changing social behavior: inside, closer contact, etc ...

One remember here: simplifications used explain / visualize stuff. actually happening. useful somewhat limited. Great headline, many people died? sigh, Miami-Dade double that. New York 14 day quarantine rule people 10 states. exactly enforcing this? would anyone know I'm somewhere I've quarantining? Meanwhile, latest stats Tennessee:

 Woot woot Even now, little understanding many people.  Somebody telling couple weeks ago,""why many cases locked down?""  know people working. police working, health care, garbage collectors, waste treatment workers. percentage people locked lot violated rules. Still weeks move everyone else in, back half chessboard that's important live closer 500-750 week. learning virus, descriptions emerging prolonged duration symptoms. know due lingering effects viral infection (i.e. post-viral fatigue) due damage caused virus and/or immune system (i.e. scarring lungs inflammation). probably active infection.

-Dr. Kohli Good one. ears sell themselves, know Even cloth masks proven somewhat effective Three kids 8, full- time student- accelerated summer classes-going rough divorce- put brakes can’t work. 

Just venting/agreeing don’t act, there’s real ceiling terms bad get. Theoretically, exponential growth left totally unchecked, state like Texas could see hundred thousand new cases day. Yes... remain vulnerable. I've asked question Governor recently last Friday.  says Colorado cannot shut stayed away asking people come hot spot states self quarantine.  said, also said need continue ""we're together"" mindset. means wearing mask inside public space... Skipping big parties. lower chances transmission. -- Chris Vanderveen Ahh yes Pence expert virus hasn’t spewed bs mouth whole time s/. It’s obvious extreme bias point politician instead expert make blanket statement well politician said states cases exploding running hospitals going fine it’s good ! Also first sentence adding optimism problem. things life suck lot there’s nothing change false optimism doesn’t help, makes worse giving people false sense security. is, you’re correct. However, media suggesting guy many better options. largely doctors flew around country help NYC.

Now seeing COVID spikes south possible spread medical professionals thin. Vanilla ICU late think, terms virus terms blowback. would worked Feb/March. seem strong consensus, here's recent experts warning took Twitter Sunday explaining believes plan two-year timeline.  vaccines likely available, efficacy, side-effects acceptance general public unknown,” Younus told Global News email.  development likely take year; it’s supply chain, distribution getting physically host, includes many steps. steps unequal across nations based capacity.”

Edit: also audibly laughed work conference call read this. Cause... yeah, BEST thing right lay health care professionals. Yep... makes sense.  DeSantis finished. 31k Italy equivalent 150K US wild quickly people seek completely invalidate opinion prepared something instead complaining it. &lt;Prepares family potential absurdly high levels economic 'growth' continue ""You must family."" Sorry interrupted ya'll complaining, I'll let get back Imagine much taxes going owe entire tax base retirees decimated. It’s incredible, it’s called ‘science’.  🤷 Agreed. Here's Florida's latest case/death ranking states per capita COVID Hive mind strong. Keep hive least direction renewable energy responsible testing care else hive believes. brother already brought two kids one parks, forget one (maybe Universal). baffles me. think he's wealthy privileged, even though acknowledges virus exists serious issue, thinks he's insulated somehow. know. Nothing makes sense me. That’s attitude people take states. “I don’t know anybody doesn’t exist.” Personally live state lowest transmission rate know two people who’ve died third gotten know exists I’m trying vector malicious ignorance Well yeah. They'll literally drag people planes get on-time percentage go 1%. give AF PR. current medical advice delay pregnancy option.

Have got source this? I'm doctor I've heard this. Obgyn field though. CDC advising extra precautions pregnant women staff caring them, seen official body advocating waiting conceive.

The problem know over. Advising families wait potentially 1 year+ start trying conceive realistic necessary, opinion. reported daily cases*.  think New York order magnitude worse realized light coronavirus pandemic, much SERE instruction already conducted online

Just read article. planning sacrificing majority older population teachers janitors?

It sure look way. :(  Oh yes, struggle. mean Italy 5 times less people concern markets negative reaction negative news virus. see mean. weird thing that's happening. People want hear part news that's convenient them: reopening. want hear part: virus still here, bars restaurants barbershops reopening mean safe go there.

I'm seeing shit area California too. People like, ""Let's get together shut again!"" mind-boggling. wife infant work full time? Same. tried stick kids’ daycare schedules story time, learning activities (4yo practices writing letters, 2yo learns colors etc).

We gave first hour Day 1 schedule wife work home fire drill projects/calls, kids fought ruined other’s activities, dog shit rug.

Before went back daycare week, iPads probably 10+ hours day they’re young sleep past 5am. isn’t currently covid vaccine available public I’m sure anti vaxxers anything atm.  Ironically NY slowing reopening paying attention fools doing. ""Nope, enough people already acting stupid. indoor dining."" people cared might issue voted him. deserve it. Lol. didn’t say missing people, decreasing positivity good thing.

The real concern increase testing percent positivity going up, double whammy. something like done , would protest would turn riot. imagine trying lock City Los Angeles? Reality something done Europe never done US might well disband task force. hasn’t done lick good yet. people complete morons. I'm sure is, Taiwanese products usually better general. big surprise, kinda big news. attend Rice U H? I'm moving Houston job, pretty terrifying. anything, show us regards healthcare system, least plan scale healthcare capacity easily efficiently event national crisis. Wishful thinking, know, need to. done even basic research foundation discuss topic. want learn start this: 

 

There find contact tracing becomes less effective emerging epidemic control based density infections contagiousness disease. authors conclude reasons contact tracing likely effective controlling emerging flu strains. COVID19 already achieved higher density infections flu, much contagious. getting tested ER ICU requires admittance

they *still* that!?  Yes, increase greatly past spikes either. logic, have.

Deaths functionally flat, hospitalizations similar levels last year, latest models using wild standard deviation 3 make assumptions. wrong? admitted part active lie American Public importance masks, don’t think earned blanket trust Germany, SK Pandas get COVID? hope not! even though ""elective"" surgeries, many cases impacting people's lives negatively. friend suffering endometriosis long time set hysterectomy doctor told wait. approach used deal climate change real surprise. positivity rate skyrocket tho we’ll able follow believe official slogan is: ""We'll beat kill dog."" Well, mean goes hog wild kill old people maybe not? TBH, suspect parents harder time non-autistic 30-year-old live-at-home meth addict felon brother ever excessively rules-following autistic ways. Y'all's mileage may vary. know several adults childless parents annual passes. drive 8 hours one way, month (twice month summer) go Disney world. counting days reopening made sure tickets. staying resorts since opened up. complaining non stop ""second home"" closed eager go back. That’s saw pdf well, idk. “official” number reported news often different pdf. Sometimes it’s higher, sometimes it’s lower. ‘“Protests didn’t cause spike” determined people approve protests’. 

So study found (since clearly didn’t read it) outside moving didn’t cause much spread. So.... going beach outside satisfy requirement. 

And it’s incredible make determination fast months we’ve heard gathering, even outside, deadly. think co-quarantine may become reality future. Whether families agree upon themselves, things like 6-student classes open school you’re gonna small groups crossing stream try keep education socialization thing. press task force gotten last six weeks. 

Did latest round attacks Fauci Birx start Fox even righter right wing media? It’s state east West Australia Doug Ducey. win? Hmmm imagine that. saying months. ICU beds capacity metric tracking. Nurse provider ratios patients state tracking. 

Put hundred field hospitals thousands beds Arizona none matters staff. 

Only way accommodate stretch staff thinner thinner put unqualified barely trained people fill gaps. Either way result poorer quality care, mistakes, ultimately preventable injuries deaths. 

You hire contract nursing doctors pulling states least competing them. Plus paying double them. 

Sounds like hospital administrators politicians realizing healthcare staff humans get tired, burnout, sick, die virus important force multiplier fight. Staff beds matters. people thinking little late. 14 days considered safe. God damn Kane used one favourites 90s. huge charge days used. would done evened typical daycare would done least. area would save us $600-900 two week vacation. adds significantly savings course daycare. might far over, way past stage anyone claim ""who knew deadly?"" bad He's comparing slavery show example, allowed. reasoning is: believe people responsibilities towards other, believe slaves responsibilities towards master, therefore views inconsistent. Since inconsistentcy bad, either find problem chain reasoning, change support one issues. comparison faulty, Nazis intentionally murdered people, wear mask intention others dying. Dr Fauci said... nothing idiots!

Anthony’s dead, he’s locked basement (ha ha) Rent large building, administrative costs, equipment, big one licensing. shut down, cost much, much higher long run.

Pensacola multiple options watching fireworks July 4 HUGE Blue Angels show coming well. closing beaches. City Pensacola mask mandate within city limits, there's ton exceptions easily ignored. also, tons places 'Pensacola' actually city limits. neighboring town, Milton, withdrew mask mandate almost immediately asking community input small number people show meeting saying hated it. neighboring towns mandates. Restaurants supposed limiting capacity know big popular ones really following rules. restaurants beach selling tickets tables watch events beach. downtown restaurants closed employees test positive, restaurants covering positive cases people got super upset places closed. Literally people punishing right thing closing weeks Covid positive employees came contact hundreds people. know bars got closed many 'bars' 'clubs' downtown serve small food menu forced close. think can't serve alcohol right now, still host music events such.  


I say lines cars people getting tested local hospitals... they're huge lines. I've seen firsthand. We've got people getting tested showing many people walking around infected time. went well paid restaurant work call center tech support. decade later I've done incredible amount roles across tech industry. fin tech sweet gig. 

I want clear though. I'm very, lucky got unique opportunities Unfortunately, think lead improved wages. lead automation. Bosses raise wages last resort. course, automation something want— tandem rising wages or, better yet, universal basic income. want automation benefits accrue social, economic, political elite.

Furthermore, voluntary depopulation (due birth control women's liberation) excellent thing see, find morally wrong society inflicted economic infertility many people— men women might want kids, cannot afford offset extreme negative demand society children— touting ""progress"". moron claims masks scientifically proven ineffective protecting viruses. even claims make likely get coronavirus ""masks may actually make situation worse radically concentrate larger droplets, expelled cough sneeze leave mask surface transferred hands infect someone. mask drop rapidly onto ground they're large gravity gets Kane good character beginning. sadly bore without mask. makes sense terms Tucson area high cases. think border area US side low case load--so far.  Reading pretty critical early childhood development, correlated sorts positive outcomes future life. Make kid read challenging books force new learn vocabulary new concepts fine. Yes, great way spread virus everywhere. /s

There many clusters linked people going vacations Florida, South Carolina California. NYs highest number ? think ""man"" may actually new version virus human form. damn hypocrite.
You know needed surgery, go someone watched YouTube video telling solid inside like potato.
He would trust expert. Still rookie numbers. We're going 200k/day. poorly, doesn’t reflect rest world responded proactively. That’s us. Europe okay- aren’t US, Brazil, Russia. reflects cultural values resulting politics based values. Nobody said ""immoral"" except you, go say made feel ""*bad*"". apparently total agreement OP then? Question Chris. think different Colorado Health departments good job updating COVID-19 mapping data? look different maps (Colorado Dept Health, Tri-County, Denver) don’t display areas COVID rising even though overall, positive tests rising. Thank you. introverts least one person talk regularly. Checkmate. Either someone loves gonna get almost like stop electing entertainment personalities office They're probably state / country find unbelievable Theme Parks allowed open already. sort info need clarity. source? Yes. one way ameliorate gargle mouthwash around 1 percent hydrogen peroxide, like colgate's peroxyl. Especially helpful night since 70 percent people aspirate fluid lungs deep sleep, potentially making illness worse. Dr reassuring us. thinks son grow bright. see way kids open accepting days gives lot hope future, also means future. logic goes ways. attributing Covid gives illusion less people suffering dying pandemic are

Yes. dont label someone didnt die Covid Covid death give ""illusion"" fewer people dying fine *some* ""dying Covid"" cases counted Covid. fact *all* counted means real stinkers Covid count.

Consider many cases Covid asymptomatic mild cases. 80%. look ""non-lethal Covid"", 99.8% infections *wont* die Covid, right?

But people die *something else* infected Covid, Covid death.

If die alcohol poisoning Covid positive, Covid killed you. counted Covid death.

I really wonder many 120,000 Covid fatalities cases like that? States choosing lock accord national lockdown. mean $13 hour eight hours comes $104 $75 day wouldn’t even cover friend’s salary. non-live vaccine? I've saying weeks. think key (and honestly something us press done great job with) always trying add perspective story.  Numbers without context seem scary.  say Denver -- state right quite well -- shied away good stories.  Stories recovery. Stories hospitals well capacity.  one reasons also stay away case counts alone. Cases alone mean much. want see hospitalizations, vent use positivity. That's go... Thanks question -- Chris Vanderveen guess depends think 33% infection rate disaster. certainly entire strategy mitigate spread. inside info 😏

And said.... looking good front more. Thank protesters. 100% fault. Outdoors way less risk. Yep fiance still retail, would screwed. I'm deemed ""essential"" God forbid anyone goes without coffee. Luckily I've maternity leave since everything started, see goes August go back. find bit ironic people throw hissy fit masks, ""keep laws body"", *exact* people fight prevent women's rights reproduction bodies. abortions, birth control propriety legislation prevents us going topless public. 

*""Never underestimate power stupid people large groups.""* **~George Carlin** Went back work. Put child day care, got exposed Covid-19 within 2 day. Guess who’s quarantined 14 days unsure I’ll job go back. 125 dollars? Pretty sure that. like get corona always temp 70% people. 70% people fever point. odds catch fever time measurement lot less 70%. 2 cents, general, big cities. business pursue profits / productivity everything else, demand workers sacrifice work / life balance (varies greatly across jobs / companies etc.,) become aggressive, point essentially throw money lot child raising ""headaches"" (many really priorities parents, work things) day care, school, etc., company care one employee single parent 3 kids + liabilities vs another employee single kids / liabilities? (I answers either.) Go ninja go ninja go! Yeah. Destabilization accelerated covid19. know november way peaceful. people bring protests COVID-19 conversation usually people don’t wear masks want police able [rape [murder without repercussions don’t actually care spread virus, want protests stop. BEST HIM. 

Of course guardian collaborated doctors. experts direct knowledge case. 

Also, entire story based side story terse statement hospital. hospital, unlike wife, isn’t going disclose details respect privacy. woman Texas says separate YouTube video posted Melissa ... understandable lied, though. 

You think people hoarding toilet paper bad, think would happened masks? would 100x worse. lied give medical facilities, emergency workers, others need time acquire stockpile. So, ""[Not] worst case scenario"" ""tapering off?"" Umm, no. future ensemble shows increasing, decreasing growth. That's ""tapering off."" Hey America, how’s winning trump going on? USA number one article say 51? also diabetes. trust people hoard masks. forget hard get toilet paper time hoarding

NOT justifying it. putting context Check again. people think vaccines cause autism never even went moon. Look everyone...it's death p-a-n-e-l-s warned us about. Yeah, america nailing social distancing, mask wearing, basic humanity... Ah New Zealand. Keep 20 000 people rugby games. See comes. wife completed paperwork. Including power attorney medical instructions halt treatment etc. suggest everyone look stuff fill valid template (German wife ordered version health insurance) Read “more home crying/yoga studio” thought “hmmm, makes sense. fucking shit..... issue people refusing wear mask ""medical reasons"", using HIPAA loophole disclose imaginary medical reason. Despite... 
Jokes aside feel like communities neglected US government also ones get hit hardest. lowest new COVID cases country it. People take seriously here. upsets many states bungling badly. feel like they're selling cheap kind everywhere around live. Like gas stations Walgreens them. 50,000 reported yesterday? None. yep virus looks almost ideal vaccination doesn’t make sort sense considering NYC New Jersey huge swaths public beaches... It’s Africa many times, times without knowledge. convinced it’s safe, turns testing product don’t know it’s safety. US wants China let in, China refusing bend quarantine rules, demanding full 14-day government isolation quarantine.

China cannot country quarantine rules people flying country, seen news American diplomats countries. 

So countries like Japan, Australia, Germany, etc., allowing American diplomats bend quarantine rules?  difficult China? Norway reporting hardly cases days, unlikely. don’t get it. followers die, vote him? Doesn’t seem like smart strategy me. Yeah, I'm condoning action. think virus new nobody really good answer. least part world. 

The good masks medical grade really ones work degree stopping spread mask user, regular masks help reducing spread around user. Perhaps mix-up communication details. never heard Fauci say it?

thought CDC director something. Fauci recently explained reason maybe guy did. Headline even close correct. article ""As Wednesday, latest update, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island Vermont track contain COVID""

NY NJ among 4 states. stupid pricks, better die Looking social media, contact tracing cell phones (recent iOS update)  number deaths properly managed without hysteria. child wouldn’t know that. video relevant ever  Employees business afraid people get offended point may hurt them. way solved people get arrested ticketed infraction. Yeah, governor. mostly heard state governor I'm sure liked him, political opinions seem pretty point. Children need living parents socialization. oft repeated 0.5% death rate 1200 kids looking ~6 deaths even know many people permanent life long health issues. 


wait 10 years declare war US enough adults healthy lungs field army anymore. already short term national security issue day Teddy Roosevelt taken service cost us Aircraft Carrier Trump Admin ignored pleas help, west point graduation, affect us decades. exactly rationale cooperating? see sense disenfranchisement lead right-wing rural trumpnuts towards “virus hoax” mentality, come affluent urban young people? Alabama, always working hard make Florida look like dumbest state. one people wear mask car alone, you? 

I run park around school since dont want go gym. wear mask everytime go store. want wear mask I'm running dont go near anyone. care. Cities can't override Governors. TX, Governor allow cities put restrictions wanting, place. ever really come it.

 
Are aware thread commenting? can't second wave til virus hits 0 point. going tell grandchildren thought joke take secret grave coworker team call yesterday said “this thing going end less deadly common cold!” say lawyer respect that, really do. cousin time finds trouble trying defend friend, he's needing help lawyer type like yourself. See, Vinny visiting ummm family small town south beautiful country friends well Vinny, ain't call great lawyer... worst pandemic anyone alive today ever experienced.

My 102 year old neighbour, William Brown, says FU. hear mRNA vaccine supposedly change genetic code...yeah I’m lol force air fabric surgical masks. goes sides ever closed properly. mom retired career doctor entire time predicting going find blood infection mostly affecting lungs direct contact transmission vector. 

I'm robotics engineer know anything virology past 4 year degree biology prereqs major seems like might right. Can't believe read that. better America. hypothesis people poorer countries willing wear masks know get infected, would get fucked badly(due lack medical infrastructure and/or loss income). Really comes mitigation. mitigation present, meaning lockdown measures measures, OBVIOUSLY numbers drop. That's common sense. mitigation removed, scenario changes dramatically. say 2 3 months that's based global outbreak timeline timeline opening lockdowns ending. Places opened early getting shat now. takes significant amount time. That's personal opinion real world observations. late November/early December comes around virus gone I'll eat crow. Lol. I’m home alone. means one funny for... programmer here, imagined bunch old dudes using Red Hat Linux distro like, ohhhhhhh get it. bad idea? Might rubbish holiday Austria materially worse?  Honestly would tempted put Sweden post titles anymore seem search keyword come share enlightened views. Another state heck job, now, home state Indiana. 

As today tested nearly 20% population, 7-day average new cases steady 350 400 1 month, (most importantly) numerous days last week single-digit deaths. states allow Everclear supermarkets. really need ""drain swamp"" something like said bother

""they"" case refers [Surgeon General United States since changed position issue, ignorant thing flip-flop on, lot damage guy caused. 

He get historical recognition worst surgeon general history country, responsible thousands preventable deaths.

What's name? **Jerome Adams**. Know villains. Dan Patrick Dominionist, cult infested American government bring religious rule. We're really worried poor people cant get chalupa control pandemic? sounds like you’re understanding parts story want to. think would going america holiday couple weeks dynamics breathing mask breathing wearing mask completely different. really breathe mask much draw air open sides. also warranted. symptom larger problem there's many injustices like States. Yes, many recovered? Blame rump, young Americans. Racism. Racism absurdly obviously false ideology believing requires shut critical thought. Pretty sure numbers wouldn’t high protests wouldn’t happened honestly, crowed places everywhere look since people don’t care anymore never did. Yeah death rate tends go 0,5% 1% start testing general public hospitals already symptoms. sound ignorant! 130,000 dead 3 months it’s “StOp HysTErIa!” People like reason continues problem.   definitive answer would get chest x-ray.  ""ground glass occlusions"" x-ray, indicating lung scarring, either definitely it, came long term harm. least there's lot old people Ft Myers-Naples area past month shown big decrease deaths. decrease notable April-May.  WTF? wearing mask public? Governor Minnesota. idea good job. Ah, thank you. like would many people risk opened schools hard keep track all, apologies forgetting parents I'm surprised employee walkouts this. forced potentially exposed virus deadly, survive, we're learning permanent lung damage, kidney failure, strokes, heart attacks, even diabetes (wtf??). Hell no.

Way back knew someone worked retail. somewhat shitty, genuinely wronged employer. last day walking out, invited friends family come store take whatever wanted long discreet it. advocate it, see people things like that. maybe stop listening politicians science medical advice. Name president last forever hundred years medical science advanced degree. I'll wait. Teleworking that, too. Can't call sick in. 'I need take (Dr. Fauci) advice' keep beaches open close surrounding bars restaurants. People pack picnic barbeque.  USA NR 1 always.

Hi /r/MURICA people ignore increase deaths follow suit. US taken seriously motto ""America first"". agree, forced reading turn people reading. want introduce classics, make challenge ""read least first 2 chapters"". Ideally kid get hooked continue read, move first 2 chapters next book list.

The main goal encourage association reading enjoyment, try remove reading seen drudgery/mandatory work. Well explains can’t believe anyone thinks masks would reduce O2 status. would probably think thing Facebook filled smart reasonable people. 

Unfortunately added pretty much anyone ever met high school-college 2006-2014 era haven’t bothered purge. Therefore get front row view shit show America. 

I live liberal state COVID almost control still see ton anti mask posts online people used know. can’t imagine it’s like areas using masks aren’t even norm. 

Stupid contagious spreads Facebook. You’re right close friends there. Sorry limited resources makes sense spend someone likely survive. fair happens medical system overwhelmed live central florida luckily see way people wear masks not

Still seems running rampant though There's pretty standard books people read different grades. Atleast within education system. read ""harder"" books see comprehend it. Ill add forcing kids read often ends resentment read. good move circumstances.  essential soooo... gEnZ gEnEraTion sAvE WoRld Yes. NY opened New Yorker get test, questions asked Oh! Smitten Kitchen. Curious spike Memorial Day? I’m sure happened didn’t state I’m wondering differences were. it’s hot sunny people live restaurants bars well huddle beaches. rains stay home. least do. Florida #1! USA! USA! USA! Uh. Looking leadership none shocker. 

I absolutely expected worst response possible. like controlled? man. Herd immunity come baby!!!! Soo we’re going herd immunity incapable anything else. Inept complete failure. nyc months prepare looked shortcuts like miracle drugs bet heat could kill virus, bet american lives pos. gauge big failure response yesterday whole European union 440 million people 3500 cases, Arizona alone beat close 5000 cases. don’t know, could assume you’re flying won’t let return flight home 14-days. would check going trips winning! Thanks this. couple questions:

1. risky staying closed, indoor environment (e.g. indoor restaurant, offices, etc.) dozens people hours, provided everyone 6-feet apart? answer change everyone wearing masks time vs. wearing masks?
2. Could Covid-19 cause long-term health issues even patients recovered? USC announced going virtual. wave announcements soon. I’m also close friends people education even state I’m well, announce district classes person two days week, students alternating. However, waiting announce cases rising may call plan off. Higher time period previous year Italy France, higher mean weeks 2012-2019.

There similar reports countries. 25% people hospitalized Covid suffer heart failure. true number cases tested remains same. tested 10,000 people june 11th today yes. tested 10,000 people June 11th 20,000 people today would expect positive cases would necessarily indicate growth.   think 16 **million** people going perish hands virus. sub often cited fear mongering.

no, downvote me, tell i'm wrong. I'm discovering new depths corruption greed influence every day always disheartening. Florida 10k cases today. success I'm lawyer, can't criminally negligent, without intent? Give time spread. might know one 2000 people died far mean people dying continue die this.

There 85K active cases reported Bangladesh population 161 million good chance know many people virus.

Hopefully country different every country time see bad get. parents pretty poor immigrated here. summers, camp option since still worked. ended going public library spending time there. Got know librarians really well, lots books read computer programs keep entertained. little spending money got lunch. read lot books lie specifically designed keep people hoarding masks. stupid, burnt trust, though. also sucks knowing even locals take seriously still idiots states coming vacation. people taking seriously north ones traveling across state lines go vacation. like giant funnel catching idiots country. Ontop increased gatherings fourth July must remember people play explosives day. shit show normal fourth July ER. can't even imagine like people trying one show much care.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* growth rate, every citizen Florida (21 mil) infected September 10th. 9 weeks away....not much time.

Edit: current 5% fatality rate, Florida alone looking million dead. That's assuming average age Florida states, bunch old people living there. dudes perfectly happy wear camo bandanas hiding face LARP military. thinking day.  think might good time personalize skeptical friends.  Ask them, ""What would think call closest ten people life tell recently tested positive COVID might put lives risk?"" 

And one persons 85 year old mother stands much higher chance dying you?

Their casualness put risk. puts every single person spent 15 minutes last week risk. That's heavy load deal get virus. -- Chris Vanderveen school tests it. also hack identifying books sold kids given age judge read those. Coming back negative wasted test twat. assumed meant died next day posting regretted it. Ah, USA tag. Gotcha. news update yesterday one two major hospitals Orlando (Orlando Regional Medical Center) hospital beds (all 635 use). Sounds right based way (ICU nurse) describing uptick past week. Paging r/floridaman.... Save yourself! lie intent. chose words carefully let people behave predictably. people going restaurants bars every day prove point, don’t doubt Even come pass still logistical problems distribution, administration management.

I’ve telling people way testing failing way vaccine going initially fail.

If manage get testing protocol setup properly chance using network get vaccine properly. YeAh sTiCkiN mAn  $125 COVID immunity assuming survive. Indoor dining Covid-19 epidemic sounds insane.

In country Netherlands closed al restaurants down. beginning re-open currently less 100 new infections per day, slighty lower population Florida. get lazy. yeah, Brazil, wonder true exponential model. Bolsanaro Trump undoubtedly two peas pod terms mentality Every time read Disney opening think stories churches weddings parties gathering dozens people infected. working PR legal Disney would advising open. don’t care measures taken, even legally culpable public judge them. It’s good. Disney world big place. many examples things could open also many examples things can’t. places opening restaurants last it’s risky area. Disney going close indoor restaurants? Performing theatres? Indoor rides? Gift shops? Disney world experience. people let still social distancing? profitable? suspect won’t be. face either money losing operation terrible PR packed profitable operation. bet don’t open. every day. policy getting stale tbh Yeah.

You achieve progress back boat.

What think country needs really contain protect country? Good decision. states need this. might never know answer, think he's going stop elective surgeries?  That's great 10 us country wearing them... ""Americans"" particular dumb stupid?

Haven't figured yet, least get infected like herds! Wut? That's works. test see someone not, period. Tests neither bad good, result based evidence. positive cases hospitalization? us understand science serious lock would keep us safe. zombies hopeless cause. CDC advising pod approach K-12, right think small cohorts - six reasonable number, maybe eight. idea they're gonna cram students anytime soon doomed. 
Then look surrounding counties started rising cases (Kern / Ventura / Orange / San Bernardino) 
 
You see LA County went flat rising (orange) past ~4 weeks. 
 
But San Bernardino rising past 6-7 weeks. 
 
Kern rising weeks LA county went flat around LA County started rising. 
 
Ventura rising like 10-12 weeks LA County started rising. 
 
Orange like 3 weeks past 3 months flat, almost rest time cases rising Orange. mean hey long NBA gets play right? Looking opinions anyone reading here: stupid move cross-country September, we're taking proper precautions? We've planning years, past couple days I'm starting really re-think due COVID. course I'm worried health husband's health, mostly I'm worried impact people. thoughts, advice, etc.? selfish? quarantine arrival? Really looking get multiple viewpoints, thank you! also herd Swedish trolls follow around engaging targeted harassment, mass downvoting, etc. really par course Swedish discourse around this, sadly.

You target forum daily relentless, one-sided arguments, backed articles constantly twist distort make point. pulled it, even reply. Hell, even tried re-write history day make point.

The simple fact - obesessive behaviour, become completely unable see side debate myopic viewpoint means consistently fail see bigger picture.

You become forum version Climate Denier.

And fact think people "" following around"" says lot ego - nobody following around - pop every day 10+ anti- Swedish posts forum publically available all. like dude stands outside courthouse every day sign saying 'the end nigh' gets pissed people treat respect thinks deserves. Yeah. choice. Wear mask stay fuck home. went end-of-life process family. Feeding tubes unnecessarily lengthen suffering also force body devote resources digesting. body also bloats inflow nutrition lack movement/burning; mind clouded exhaustion (because believe not, die, digesting processing food exhausting).

A day removed feeding tube, got family member ""back"" days. able focus eyes, listen us, respond. r/trashy That's TSLA shorts said. Na fault president downplaying virus ever gets chance fucking warning since 2019 anybody recommend good quality bandanas? use make masks myself. Looking something soft reasonably thick (by bandana standards). Lots Amazon many poor reviews liking though, either durability thin. Rain drive everyone inside make worse USA lacking rules? 

There states US put quarantine measures place outside travelers returning residents varying degrees, think there's national requirement people test positive self-quarantine. DeSantis charged murder. speaking family, acquaintances, friends, classmates, etc person.

They seem stuck anti blm slogan (I think full slogans blocked mention it, can't figure order matter, part must matter, includes lot marginalized groups like people dont spend time think important. makes think say narrative? pandemic virus, goals, can’t reason it. reproduce, allow lot it’s going spread. clarify, you’re admitting number cases increased testing? Thanks... wish way help people understand scientists interested truth, people would sooner believe radio host doctor/academic. Less moreso due fact massive TV deal ABC/ESPN... i.e. Disney.

Too bad put eggs basket instead keeping options open. Meanwhile, NHL looked like going using Vegas hub 100%, always kept options open even going single hub US. Tell mom a) stop going church b) stop hugging people went end-of-life process family.

A day removed feeding tube, got family member ""back"" days. able focus eyes, listen us, respond. Yes, actually that's true. Young unarmed black men killed people paid tax dollars protect us much pressing pina colada TGI Fridays.

See simple is? Get now? admitted told public masks effective short supply. don’t know putting goal posts why, referring misinformation given public regarding whether public would benefit wearing reason people wearing mask. - Fauci 

This utter bull shit. Watch 60 minutes interview March. It’s classic political spin. inside reason he’s saying don’t wear masks (shortage medical professionals), he’s saying statements completely reversed, complete bullshit. reason people wear masks. supply available, 85 percent people (a number says shouldn’t happen interview one agree would great) wearing masks. he’s saying. Why? white lies necessary him. Saying “there’s reason people America walking around masks” net positive him. fear explains masks absolutely help would help wear mask public, don’t buy medical field needs them, people would buy listen. end day, it’s politics lie.  Thanks! lost nursing student Liability insurance children big chunk $$$ Well, definitely agree intelligence insulted. allow misinformation lol. wonder nobody respects reddit mods Fun fact: people recorded idiots covered insurances? lockdown fully...today...

Hahahahahaha yeah ain't happening big weekend holiday tap well. Good luck Florida. What? spelled ""see week"" wrong. yep refuse wear mask dude? issue virus enter eyes. But, eyes suck air either, even though true, still reduces chances exposure. Even reduction 5 percent, take it? use could first sentence lmao many deaths? Nice. Next throw dialysis parties 3 times week! Morons... coworker flying Florida meeting whole family another state go Disney right opens. Needless say, I’m glad don’t go work near awhile states need seriously look saying fuck federal government look closing borders. completely control attempts made slow down, rifles, ain't.  guy seems guess week testing positive Yeah. pretty severe backlogs Florida Arizona. Hope best dad. Honestly children, would want person making 13/hr taking care them. 13/hr usually ""Im paycheck"" job Lol, what’s 5% population whole freaking state? million? Better get mass grave business. Easy money. think 15k highest feasible running testing caps. Beyond going need ever increasing % positive drive count, that's much difficult task testing volume alone definitely feel people country take healthcare workers granted.  Hope guy carries guilt rest life show. Friday March 27 wrote, ""488 new COVID-19 cases TODAY"" \[in Illinois\] frightening shocking. Illinois 146K recorded cases.  Post viral conditions real possibility millions otherwise healthy people. worries, thanks open feedback. :) Smash Bros guys get this... NEW RECOOORD!! People dying go Disneyworld again. People angry removed Mr Toad's Wild Ride Disney World, Disney finally found replacement! LA particularly bad. Reopening limited huge BLM rallies. ""I'm horrified puts safety comfort"", embarrassment comment That’s perpetuated. told “only medical-grade N95 masks create airtight seal protective wearer. Unfortunately short supply needed medical professionals.“ 

Somehow people interpreted “masks useless.” governor. hospitals stopped elective surgeries Florida large scale decisions governor help stop overall spread. It’s like de escalated 200 wave tsunami 100 wave tsunami. one gets credit that. even 100 tsunami devastating. Vaccines privileged first. take time. good effective vac maybe still 1 year away reaching general people India best. Provided find effective vac. crisis also shows inept systems reacting real crisis. media people involved democracy business opportunists. It’s like learnt shit history. divided danger clear. deaths lag far behind cases NYC? patients coming disease progression something? It’s wild individuals states, ignoring prior cases, going surpass countries total # covid cases, since start pandemic, 4-5 days. certainly NJ See something don’t know I’d agree with. got masters last year relevant degree job now. country, friend would face trial terorism homicide. Wont dude face legal issues this? hope well, appreciate taking time write out! seem going way miss point Funny thing is, say playing RuneScape way back day. Lol Well one way Mexico pay wall keep America's side fence. Airlines bailout deal. dont care actual safety measures. got money. lips god’s ears, friend. 

I believe you’re incorrect Texas Florida surpass NY, desperately hope I’m wrong. 

I just... comorbidity awareness hasn’t changed behaviors Texas, least huge portion population. Texas Florida exceed New York’s population population NYC metro area. 

And people NYC got fairly cautious, least according friends Brooklyn &amp; Bronx. many sirens scared people hard. Texas &amp; Florida didn’t get hit early, many citizens bought idea big blue city problem, they’ve gotten incredibly complacent. Also, neither state high ratio hospital beds people NY particularly NYC metro area. 

I think arrogance foolishness, Abbott &amp; DeSantis populations general, gonna cost lot lives. guarantee Governor family receive top notch care regardless full hospitals get. long think 20,000 cases per day? bet next hell? actually kinda cool. Whereas Dukakis look kinda dorky tank. Seriously, mean balls need legislation shoved throat? smoke damn pipe anyhow.  Don’t worry enough people test vaccine on.. Well, generation idiots guess... Let it. less dumb fucks world. clear long time dear leader reliable source information. also knew virus January. measure blame coworker's death. boss likewise well.

It completely your, SO, boss's fault totality though even combine blame - I'd say less half fault combined. engineered lab Wuhan bear blame otherwise goes freak mutation resulted creation virus. CCP also covering allowing spread also bears large portion blame. closed borders first realized serious possible spread around world.

Generally speaking, think wise completely absolve people blame spreading disease others. need people act responsibly wear masks social distance. need every incentive get everyone onboard including using guilt peer-pressure get people right things necessary.

Even though government saying time masks important preventing spread disease governments saying key common sense time mask-wearing &amp; washing hands key preventing spread. question assumes impossible deaths continue fall. Narratives matter. combination lot things. possible argue things ways, merit. doubt, look neighbors thing. ( )

On April 5th, using numbers reported article, Germany stood 1,584 deaths 100,123 known confirmed cases (\~1.6% CFR).

***Perhaps people tested Florida early patients caught virus Austrian Italian ski resorts relatively young healthy, Professor Kräusslich said.

***Perhaps people coronavirus infections spread, older people hit death rate, 0.2 percent two weeks ago, risen, too. average age contracting disease remains relatively low, 49. France, [it [in Italy according latest national reports.

***Perhaps we're testing explanation low fatality rate Germany testing far people nations. means catches people symptoms, increasing number known cases, number fatalities.

***Perhaps we're better treating also significant medical factors kept number deaths Germany relatively low, epidemiologists virologists say, chief among early widespread testing treatment, plenty intensive care beds trusted government whose social distancing guidelines widely observed.

***Perhaps need wait see everyone run course disease:***

As July 5th, sit 9,061 death 196,372 known confirmed cases. (\~4.6% CFR) ( )

\~4.6% certainly much lower see look number NY, Italy, Spain, France, etc., still relatively high concerning number. unscientific opinion completely doom gloom, reckless assume coronavirus deadly. run full course yet. wait see truly impacts country see like EU countries. case fatality rate virus unknown time accurate estimate many people actually contracted it. 

Second, one contracted immune it, there's vaccine limited treatment. exercise caution closing activities could facilitate spread virus, overwhelm hospital people die could otherwise saved. need buy time get vaccine closing large gatherings that.

And public gatherings, whether protests, rallies gathering increase risk virus. degree increase risk depends size gathering, whether indoor outdoor, attending, (shouting, cheering) whether socially distance wear mask.

-Dr. Kohli Yes, thank source confirms told data revealing age groups affected. People ages 20 44 account 20% Covid-19 hospitalizations 12% ICU admissions, according Paul G. Auwaerter, MD, Johns Hopkins Medicine.

And make sense unless assume young people make disproportionately high amount people hospitals ventilators. anything, actually opposite: elderly ventilators.

Now, source, actual number attach claim: 80% people admitted hospitals, 88% people admitted ICU, elderly. 

Let break like this. Here's reason younger people dying greater numbers serious cases treated hospitals.

Yet, minority hospital admissions young people. claim hospitals full, younger people start dropping like flies (with implication rates similar see elderly), false. 

The fact matter younger people going hospitals need to. claim hospitals full, death rate skyrocket, unfounded. non resident thing issue since beginning. Florida counts things way states do, waaay non residents average state. made clear agree. It’s okay make mistake learn mistake change mind. Good them, everyone masked up. Sorry took long good job Kansas. mean read original transcript? pretty unequivocal statement asymptomatic/presymtomatic people rarely transmit. Even walkback weak shit, technical lead said stuff said taken 'official'. official, fucking say press event. people keep playing apologist WHOs poor messaging? giving flashbacks. Mine turned 18 (which scary beast own!) shit, chicken nuggets, yogurt cheese sticks longest time. think able pancakes breakfast. Even still limited somehow wider variety likes neurotypical sister, wtf that! Going less 10% positive test rate almost 20% suggests Florida might well saturating testing capacity create asymptotically slower growth time vs. reality. need apologise. want thing. AEW handled better   Wildfire status. Single handedly could helped one man, Ron DeSantis, failed people die leadership failure. one goal, protect serve. “Authority bad” argument, it’s impulse. understand whether authority bad case, need look authority it’s affecting situation. Let's put way: seen single person agree Gov. Wolf's actions (not including online interactions) except WDW opens 9 days! live far north Beijing, I'm following closely news African community.

But seen U.S. media bashing China African racism news lately, African countries angry Chinese government, assume situation sorted out. need martial law. Now. Moore's Law work. Yes percentage US crazy? Yeah definitely underestimating many people addicted stupid park. one worst parks ever visited, yet everyone acts like they'll die go *every. single. weekend.*

It's actually Disney *restricting* many people came come re-open. One major reasons kids, due feeling like choose career personal dreams, becoming indentured service children. modern world, women sacrifice family, unfortunately way wealth inequality is, lack social safety nets country, many still (unless monetary family support assist raising them). 

To me, children still feel like form control women, nature reject societal pressure chart path. thought wanted kids early 30s, came know finally found partner crime mid 30s, realized feeling due ""expected"", deep really didn't. constant self-sacrifice seem fair, deserve determine future reproductive capabilities.

 strain population numbers causing environment, Covid, really dont believe reduction births negative looking big picture. earth needs break, society equitable, women deserve live lives based personal dreams often get delayed, stunted abandoned children. 

I often feel like pariah wanting kids, seems like antiquated notion like maintaining bloodlines ""heirs"" came aristocratic beliefs matter anymore average person. perfectly acceptable society badger even harass women never want choice, pushed inevitability. 

I hope silver lining many women would kids due economic hardships health concerns pandemic, realize need kids find happiness, highest purpose breeding. think still long way go women's equality, hopefully eventually positive effect. yeah, definitely let’s cut unemployment stimulus mongering

OH right speaking which, whatever happened caravans immigrants Fox going about? Yep. internet made largely woefully uneducated people interested points adoration strangers. Notes briefing:

* ongoing lowering number serious diagnosed cases, week also abrupt drop confirmed mild cases. going investigate causes behind - delay testing something else cause behind it. 
* outbreak  cases found Norrbotten Thursday morning. many samples taken before.   June, number cases began rise sharply, says infection protection physician Anders Nystedt press conference. situation starting calm down, says Nystedt, Gällivare still tough.   bit sparse deaths compared April. still kills people. Especially elderly, says.

* restaurant Bråstad, chief legal officer Public Health Authority, talks new law applies restaurants, cafes bars:  applies regulations restaurants regulated relate other. legislation. municipality take care supervision restaurants, bars cafes, follow regulations decided.  all, possible limit number visitors, inform guests staff prevent infection. new regulation order make easier restaurant owners supervisors, must least one meter companies, says Bitte Bråstad.  Bråstad explains one-meter rule restaurants applies *between* parties. *In* society regulation.

* 431 total patients respirator ICU care Sweden right now, 138 ICU patients COVID-19. continuous lowering ICU coronavirus patients, positive news. 687 patients COVID-19 hospitalized outside ICU departments, also continuously lowering number. Total ICU beds 624 country, different capacity regions 14% 67% free capacity, average 30% nationwide available capacity. 
* 94% municipalities report critical situations problems, Gallivare situation strained. 

**Please, remember lag reporting deaths reported certain day usually mostly deaths happened previous days. average takes 11 days report 90% deaths certain day (see links graphs looks)**

Useful links:

* graphs lag information deaths/hospitalization/cases per Socialstyrelsen (Board Health Welfare), publishes (weekly) parallel statistics based death certificates, include people diagnosed tested Corona excludes people died reasons COVID-positive; also information elderly homes social housing statistics related COVID19. Public Health Authority statistics tests performed previous And?! dead? sick? don’t. infected rate almost certainly higher asymptomatic people getting tested. point see way US turning back containing beast. Maybe 6 months changing entire lifestyle wearing mask protect people don’t give shit others made jaded. I’m seeing needed herd thinning clear idiots guess way teach elected officials difference politics science. Thank front line employees, doctors, nurses, ones right thing stop this, don’t give fight believe so, sad. daily thinners right now? clotting condition hard deal with, sympathy. hope paying close attention limbs lungs re: clots. Could 1 day, could 1 week. original accounts China, sickest patients hospitalized 7-10 days, seem get better, rapid decline. Others symptoms, realize sick, drop dead without warning cardiac arrest. incredibly naive selfish take. Cool, I’m gentrify inner city bucket since child apptitude appears tied parents exposure funding school district Sweden right idea entire time. started saying, ""well dumb"" listen something crazy.




Evidently often enough mom dropped something came top ""well dumb"" get speak anymore Prayers &amp; stay strong~ claiming asymptomatic people can't spread disease? Wish detail. able accurately predict 3d function protein knowing DNA sequence kind holy grail molecular biology think they're called memphibians. don’t understand completely shut NYC, EMPTY TIMES FUCKING SQUARE, 3 FUCKING MONTHS, cause rest country prepare. NJ resident, wish could close borders. first thing agree moron. Beaches open. People pack lunches barbeque. Close surrounding bars restaurants. last thing closing outdoor places people spread out. ain't like talk y'all geeeet out! /s Also teachers still every day. Opening schools worst idea, please nobody support unless want piles dead children teachers. particles actually smell smaller poop particles. better analogy would underwear lets smell stops shit much way mask lets air stops covid particles. interesting see there's baby boom this. expect may see opposite. 

We want another kid can't right money. Probably lot others boat. I'm mistaken NBA officials talks German soccer league, managed finish. question model works country much advanced spread virus total number tests needed become problematic point. Careful, Trump going say 50k cases actually person said, 'sort disappear, hope,'. 

it's clear know thing works Turns raising children accept accountability personal responsibility actions leads caring outcome actions Someone already called 'Guarantee it' meme days ago. What? thought pro-life NJ, give people inch, take mile  Earth one lmao Yeyeye, let's go Chinese propaganda doesn’t matter stage, matters followers believe start wearing masks everyone hard it, sick fucks. Uh get competent leadership address problem. K, thanks. close enough? ""But can't breathe!"" spread misinformation states uses triage. Similar criteria used Italy used Brazil, Russia, hard hit countries. one ventilator two patients need it, one likely come alive better quality life gets it. already get colds shit start school year. best friend elementary school teacher, simply counted sick first two months every year. Ok yeah yeah yeah known already several weeks. Delete flamebait post. also know disease six months ago. example, rather sticking everyone ventilator oxygen starts drop, we're giving blood thinners instead, since real problem related many clotting factors produced. USA! USA! USA! USA! NUMBER 1! NUMBER 1! WOOOOOOO! TAKE FAUCI! 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🎉🎉🎉 Please someone change mind isn’t mostly protests Yeah I’m cities LA, actually commute parts city without mandatory 60 minutes 405 gridlock. Stay well &amp; hell w/her. get coming from~ Alabama.... guys shouldn’t surprised They're saying two years US. Aff, actually idea morbidity rate COVID is, may never know Agreed widespread doesn’t make sense. wasteful greedy fucks way ahead you, google ghost kitchen. Reported, blocked! Bye now. Seeing always going obscenely wealthy people world, would rather try buy way heaven (a la Bill Gates) create multiple shell corporations used pay children young 3 years old six figure larger salary one many ploys avoid income estate tax (a la Fred Trump)?

Call crazy, Billy boy wants try good plenty bad, question is: take Gates recruit Bezos? people definitely idiots, there's long history pharmaceutical companies - shall say - less ethical testing African continent exchange favors government. like blame trump everything?  Link Unfortunately research won’t change mind. lot people believe opinion YouTube doctor instead. analysis reveals difference without mandated face covering represents determinant shaping trends pandemic” dystopian surveillance

Actually, dystopian hundreds thousands people dying government laughs off.

Aggressively tracking tracking deadly disease absolutely dystopian. adults pay government do. Time start swinging 6-foot stick. ""If 6 feet away hit you."" American, approve us getting fucking murdered bigots. States slow reporting, misreporting, misunderstanding. may hesitation numbers issues define covid death, there's trump campers probably want disclose full numbers, way systemic governmental cover-up suppresses free individuals. No, government forcing man situation cruel. He’s giving facts, going thousands times over. business longer saving lives, death. matter? necessary lie protect front line workers, i.e., Doctors Nurses needed masks shortage. Let's forget shortage either. Dumbass Donald golfing going rallies January February, allowed China buy millions masks PPE's. [China played like god damn listened intelligence agencies back December January, Fauci would've needed lie keep shortage getting worse March. no, keep blaming Fauci Trumps fuck ups, that's someone thinks ass-backwards. Thousands people shoulder shoulder vs restaurants opening. People really still trying compare two say they’re equal? Come on.
May 15 = 3-4 weeks Georgia opened. spike
Now = 3-4 weeks massive gatherings. spike.

Idgaf hope everyone gets open world. hope get twice. reason spike obvious. Unicorns source pixie dust. mean, Gov. gives money Covid patients. Go figure. keep Covid testing schools, we'll keep zero school cases! remember N95 masks designed worn short term. Don’t go wearing one 12 hours you’re healthy Yea lot places reality sometime. COVID simply highlighted this. 

Where live housing expensive single income family afford basics life mortgage. Dual income necessity. But, childcare costs around 1200-1500 month. Two kids + mortgage would entire monthly salary live bare bones house, job considered top blue collar. 

I'm even major city, hours drive reach downtown. Brazil looking pretty damn bad too, reporting almost much US 45k new cases yesterday roughly 85% fewer tests per million population. mom flying Brazil California next week visit Niece diagnosed Leukemia... Fuck 2020 man mean 100's thousands right? wouldn’t happening stopped testing. /s Comrade corona work ! good dude. Herman fukt.  half America form cardiovascular disease means higher risk die this. March - May, steady decline new cases per day(from 35-40K 15-20K).

From June - Now, went 15-20K new cases per day 50K new cases per day.

Definitely *mysterious* spike caused *factors may mentioned*. Fauci intentionally lied us first one he's surprised nobody trusts him. earlier, esp. live footage it. think evening done ever showing them. I’ve seen footage ground hear bodies hit, actually terrifying Floridian, feel like I'm going crazy. want know what's worse seeing idiots news going town hall meetings spouting nonsensical, idiotic things wear masks? stores signs front say masks required entry one way isles social distancing markers ground, fuck actually enforce it?

It's watching friends family love, know complete idiots, know virus real, masks help, political issue, desperate kind return normalcy keep trying find excuses justify things know damn well be. 

I swear god, I'm brink mental breakdown, know anymore. happens Disney world employees quit they'd rather homeless risk death coronavirus? Bruh bugs shit me. swear people need see loved ones denied medical care maybe get point. Florida might end way worse hit nyc... tho hope happen. country likes smack win seems character.

Do possibly virus Whitehouse? Hell yea good work Florida! testing super sick apparently. saw something aren’t trying test asymptomatic people targeting sick ones. test already sick people it’s easy high positive. need conflate mild severe get 60% make point...

Hospitalization extremely low, nowhere near 60% news, water wet.  think mask battle well total lost now.

If wearing mask, you’ll probably keep wearing mask. wearing mask really can’t see arguments convince course would. don’t want to. Yea, idiots that.  People think early stage vaccines going prevent spread Sars-Cov-2. Unfortunately, evidence suggests vaccines reduce morbidity preventing infection lower respiratory tract even vaccine still productive infection nasal passages. Every non-human primate study indicates occurs. means vaccine could still become infected spread virus unvaccinated individuals. Plan continuing another 2-3 years. Happy holiday! ways think kinda correlates talent shortage tech.

I feel like lot people can't quite grasp abstraction.

Yes- virus real thing, can't see it. can't touch it. can't directly interacted with. conceptual average person people hard time something can't see. clusterfuck! Hope people taken accountable. Best luck EU. fine job nursing homes. pretty big miss. ""Fasten seat belts. Try scream want go faster!"" Speak country. Almighty dollar, arse read link? Deaths slowly risen past 2 weeks, daily hospitalizations hit record. 

Edit: Unless hosptization trend suddenly reverses, number deaths continue increase. Yikes...kinda sad you’re ok thousands people dying preventable cause. Also, don’t know ‘herd immunity’ viable one. Didn’t really work smallpox. know shattering records help. music spreading virus! DisneyWorld already partially opened last week. videos people everyone wearing masks. elected ignore science

Because Fauci, CDC, said wear masks. Truth. many people come sub. I’m Arizona it’s pretty terrifying response many citizens. rushed. I'll rephrase. Thanks Right Canada going exponential growth 😂😂😂😂 act like Canada good job social distancing, 50% population still going work every day since start shit show. Fucking burn China ground. Vitamin synthesis regulated UVB intensity, heat. UV radiation intensifies proximity equator. Africa? idea there.

So here? doing? 700k year death US heart disease That’s also cdc said do. 

Not saying right it’s like better options. can’t sit ICUs pandemic. Yup. Must freak every holiday exists. Can't skip any. 2 weeks Flag Day right now. Huh - [deaths still going Herd immunity fairy tale. gonna work. Re-reading, realize first sentence clear.  

No one (with medical-related training experience) seriously believed nonsense.  immunity kicks around 60% more.

[Unless say [much that. people like incapable realizing can't open schools parents need daycare?

Even give single shit teachers, going run schools teachers get sick??? rotating cohorts person bitching make sure every kid gets *some* face time teacher making distancing measures possible classroom. protestors. Mostly idiots feel don’t need masks. Go knowing sick infect others. There’s many tests done proving it’s protestors. must protest, riot loot! cares there's easily contractable deadly virus?!?  part plague inc. virus starts infect everything thousands day fucked So, dozens different people riding rides. seats. hand rails. seat belts.

You get take family Disney right sanitized entire park thermonuclear blasts every 15 minutes. don’t use brains anyways WHO's [official states cases 'viral pneumonia' announced Wuhan health authorities Dec 31 media statement. Unfortunately can't find copy original WHO’s Country Office People’s Republic China picked media statement Wuhan Municipal Health Commission website cases ‘viral pneumonia’ Wuhan, People’s Republic Country Office notified International Health Regulations (IHR) focal point Western Pacific Regional Office Wuhan Municipal Health Commission media statement cases provided translation it.

Additionally, picked media report SARS like outbreak Wuhan -- day.

WHO also says also received inquires Dec 31 health authorities around Several health authorities around world contacted seeking additional information.

China states, I'm aware claims lying, national health authorities engaged Dec 31 well.

The following day, January 1st, day recall becoming aware pneumonia Wuhan. heard earlier, specifically recall it.

So get it. specific cover-up allegations regarding WHO? day Wuhan reports outbreak China, WHO, national health authorities know issue. Read reports. specific could paint pretty serious situation mentioning SARS. hours later information available people like Google news.
 lying about?
So again, what's cover-up? missing?  Lockdown entire country deploy national guard help law enforcement enforce mask use social distancing. refuse comply pay heavy fine second offense requiring house arrest. clear many people interest containing mitigating virus serious threat people US also national security. time stop playing games people's lives. going along topic post - single day record

Edit: hold - 20% shattering record. heard SiriusXM &lt; 50 tickets sold. PAY!? hotair.com 🤔 Florida Number 1! applies every city country whole: *where death spikes*? It’s undeniable death spike followed immediately heels inital April 1st spike. Within 2 days initial spike, saw increase 100 extra deaths every day peak roughly 2500/day Mid-April. saw massive spike cases week ago now, death rate failed budge. yet, we’re shutting again? 56 deaths county 1M people. back quarantine? 10 days ago admitted intentionally deceiving us back Mar saying wear masks knew everyone wear masks.  wanted save PPE medical personnel credibility anymore history intentional dishonesty. amazing listen to. coast guard captain knew exactly happening boat captain trying do. Called hard. Uh, totally OOM error factor. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3

SandlessBeach President !!! :) Canadian physician here, couple things say question Venn diagram vented vs ICU.

With exception patients temporarily vented (ER, OR, transport), care invasive ventilation occurs ICU. Ie. Almost vented patients ICU patients.

Being vented however reason ICU. common reason would cardiovascular instability. Examples would severe sepsis, post transplant, post major cardiac surgery, post cardiac arrest, patients bypass etc.

Other people end ICU depending access in-between level care (step unit), specialized care (cardiac care unit, dialysis unit, etc), availability space. volumes low, patients may transfered appear may need forms invasive care. 

With COVID imagine still regional variation general indications ICU remain. Indeed. Emphasis “There’s turning back this.”

When dust settles years US stay #1 wrong numbers.  Maybe use light soap filled nuke hurricane disperse light, sort fashion to, know light showing tremendous effect coronavi- maybe could use hurricane light. Drs., maybe look that? Pretty sure nuke go away ""like magic"" illustrates health officials advise people keep avoiding large gatherings, ironic example hard going get back normal anytime I've really impressed CSU system's transparency this. guess lot less lose many universities, must make difference since many students local live on-campus. Traitorous? Democracy wholly illegitimate system governance. What’s crazy whole world shown happen wear mask, social distance try go out. 

Literally rest world back thing. Quality life reestablished pointing laughing us. 

People still fighting wearing piece fabric. 

Japan, South Korea, Europe, etc etc...

We’re dumbasses fighting whether virus real threat not. 

That’s happens spineless leader. u know young ppl won’t exponentially spread older family friends? Essential workers stores go without masks? state governor pretends like everything’s good? argument barely relevant here. Shits fucked. Period. ominous tell someone giant dick drunk shit ends ER. I’m tired punching bag entitled people it’s nurses don’t last long nursing. Healthcare general. 

This idea it’s acceptable treat us like crap get called sweet enough reminding people treat us like crap exactly why. antibody tests pretty accurate, area low infection rate you’ll need 1 though NY, NJ, CT, VA, OH, MD - tried largely succeeded Well tried! Can’t even write stuff. level stupid deserve ""We'll see."" deserves ""Fuck no, stupid bastard."" NY state reacted late, took seriously reacted. state especially city way late taking seriously really cost them. Everybody remembers Cuomo's briefings positive, NY never needed get bad was. DiBlasio particular absolute fucking disaster this. Thanks William Regal. Likely? We're well beyond likely. Sorry asked lot realistic timeframe vaccine? LOL’d hard immediately got sad Stanley cup comment it’s true. 

I live hour toronto, I’m huge detroit wings fan... I’m mad this, however it’s true 😂 Nope Really bothers global impact, inside America. stupidity people going cost world lives. shock 
that call first world country. really described conservatives. rest us would gladly pay bit tax help others, go without work stop spread virus.

At least, that's feel like Canada. think fire fighters give flying fuck started fire. job put let investigators come later. Right US fire, fire fighters need put out(wear masks, social distancing, etc). Let investigators come get control.

All articles like change subject detract fact us America gotten control. It’s anything confirmed, still massive cost. Disney gets decide reopen remember weeks ago postponing again. ever think maybe older people taking precaution now?

They taking precaution even fair ask. choice. choice people see *their* choices confining elders four walls window visitors.

We asking everyone else elders bearing brunt pandemic resultant isolation economic damage.

How skeptical benefit us? wrong, people die. right, live without inconvenience bit. Like, hell?

Again, individual towns counties whatever - top down, unity, leadership, over-arching guidance people feel compelled follow armchair actuaries saying ""actually squeeze little bar revenues *push hospitals liiiiitttle brink"".*

Just stop. nothing gain here. economy worse efforts. parents' prospects worse, prospects worse, shortsightedness bucks. Nobody waited 4th start playing fireworks live. He's warning Corona early start. Marc Lipschitz first people I've following. people listening world would've much better place. W N N N G ! ! ! Thanks Donny Good luck making 350 million doses January  put stock market Florida men at? Well dept health OSU joint case prevalence study starting next week believe. They're going randomly select 1200 ohio homes perform nasal swab antibody tests order understand prevalent is/has throughout state. give us better picture beyond daily positive test reporting. Except already know there. saying else there. told go fuck fair Wisconsin except get drunk watch cars rust? Fauci right yet. One small hope significant propotiion people stupid enough gather memorial day stupid enough gather 4th. may spooked skyrocketing cases.  Would funnier Several colleges mandated students negative test within 5 days return campus next month. Getting tested come mid-August going utter shitshow. made difference IMO. company went WFH immediately lockdown started. many co-workers broke lockdown rules several times give rat's ass. despite still employed still paid. complained staying home boring. Florida probably test “foothills” herd immunity. Ie model includes September start accounting 20% population recovered. 

It also incredibly tragic see case fatality rate one elderly populations world starts climbing 20% infected August. Assuming people continue socialize amid mass graves field hospitals. Noones seems address elephant room. sun hitting hard, cleaning everything. Let's wait December celebrate. first (maybe only?) offices reopen government offices, I've couple interactions them.

They like supermarkets even better distancing. Appointment only, huge plastic screens, places stand stay apart, use gloves.

But here's rub: airtight, know even beginning China America ventilation systems indoor areas help virus thrive.

So effective measures compared additionally wearing mask (which nobody US/Europe seems do). seriously believe governors going sit watch unmitigated disaster happen state, don’t understand governors do.

*The governors Texas Florida entered chat.* protests lead spike cases virus hoax? make mind Disney World opening 11th certainly going help Guys, c'mon, Two Weeks^TM Anyone remember Florida laughing NYC? What's hilarious FL saw train coming, remarkably ended running towards instead stepping way. upvote even points 0 since amended that. CDC also said need worry unless recently Wuhan, China. [I got Ooh god  like ""low viral"" count detection. huge, [Professor Kim oversaw SARS containment South Korea noted common test use currently needs viral count least 3000 trigger positive, results many false negatives. accurate tests nuanced containment strategy. There's much choice. federal government all-powerful like, say, France. sources

That's embarrassing 

Lolololololololol Never never leaf fan, sorry. Damn you’re one psychos stalk people’s post history. job collecting $600+unemployment that’s like lockdown?

Yup totally made [20k credible source since disproved point?

And yes, resorting accusing someone supporting party reason incorrect attempt ad hominem. doesn’t prove point attempts discredit. No, rest world back thing. Very, places back normal, back remote. South Korea still locked down, Europe, Japan, etc. reported spread lower, yes, lives essentially US. cases relatively healthy younger people. elderly protected. Relax reminds couple met living New Hampshire, ""live free die"" state. refused wear seat belts government forcing illegally infringing rights.

They got married (I went wedding!), baby.

One day car accident, hit truck going intersection. became projectile hit killing instantly, went windshield. Somehow got pinned tree car, severing spinal cord, pancaking chest down.  

She dead paramedics arrived. believe holding baby arms front seat accident happened. paramedics found baby seizures brain damage impact (s). driver truck vomitting shock crying uncontrollably killed newlyweds newborn baby.

Or could taken 2 seconds put seatbelt.

Managing risk (imo) balancing probability risk happening versus impact would risk happens. 

Yeah, inconvenient sometimes uncomfortable wear seat belt. one loves them, one would wear possible-life-and-death safety - life lives others!

So, could say deadly accident low probability happening, high impact life does. (Some risk managers like plot things graph.)

I see exactly way example us: masks social distancing prevent spread deadly disease! hope agree real potentially deadly, even survivors may serious lifelong effects. We're seeing effect reopening country real-time, almost every state. Really? Vaccine administered population January?  Aha! That’s cancelled. head

The biggest thi g wanted us schoolwork morning. wkuld buy math grammer workbooks grade we'd going into, art/drawing workbook.

We page every morning.

The math biggest help. Made easy school knew basic concepts already.

For reference, graduated HS 2006, mid-late 90s.

By time 8th grade we'd hang play video games board games, swim play soccer summer. faith usa stop covid herd immunity get because

1. Hospitals currently overwhelmed
2. Im young I'll ever be
3. summer least also cold flu catch it

?

I'm covid denier just-the-flu bro, I've careful since January everyone acted like covid would history... I'm starting lose faith country's ability win one. 

Any thoughts? could go bank every day DC NY one places declining cases then? that's ""Comprehension"" tests school? Read passage answers questions it? No, I’m nothing problem you’re facing! Haha. I’m American, I’ve never been, interest ever going. place dumpster fire. ""The current work suggests G614 variant may infectious, pathogenic. hope SARS-CoV-2 infection spreads, virus might become less pathogenic,” said statement."" get earn mean new recruits Florida, California, Michigan? course not, recruits subject this. Basic training recruits allowed travel base anyways. leave weekend travel active duty personnel, recruits considered be. Hell, separated getting duty station training considered never served all. purely political Florida thrown would obvious otherwise.  guess less patients therefore get better care  sake, please take seriously, isolate, lockdown necessary. not, regret use damn mask...

America sunk deeply mythology. Large chunks population hold beliefs completely divorced basic reality (""freedom"" become empty slogan, ""government bad"" default attitude, etc). never adjust nothing forced far. They're Trump kids world, believe whatever want there's consequence living fantasy world.

Nothing fix that, except major, MAJOR event. We're yet. testing everyone, massive chunk won’t sick enough seek testing.

Correct. things like flu, decades data spread infection rates, etc. make broad assumptions spread disease reasonable certainty. disease, nearly much information. Basically, know catch disease enough symptoms warrant testing, die 5% time. asymptomatic carrier thing almost certainly true extent, assuming 5 10 times higher symptomatic disease population seems kind generous. That's entirely true. may aware Supreme Court’s 1965 decision Zemel v. Rusk written Chief Justice Earl “But freedom mean areas ravaged flood, fire pestilence cannot quarantined demonstrated unlimited travel area would directly materially interfere safety welfare area Nation whole.”

This generally used literature justification states allowed close borders. aware tested courts. Right. overreach mandatory quarantine erode support effective measures like public mask wearing. sounds like personal marital problem. see comment ""basically saying"" that. know several people stay-at-home dads, worked part time taking care kids wife worked full time since made money. suggest one marry children dick swinger fragile ego supported outdated views refuses learn take care children tells wife do. True, like covid affect younger populations all. I'd expect crowding lack facilities would enough offset demographic differences. know downvoters personally thought could googled least fast questioned source. friend likely identified possible exposure via contact tracing confirmed case. March blamed China, June blaming testing, who/what blame September? Try 4 ever. he's shit like this, knows else he's doing...  death rate low many population workers 20s &amp; 30s, highly unlikely die virus.

Weeks ago saw thing news search. Government given talk mentioned 2-3% patients age 65.

Other countries Gulf low death rates well, probably reason. Bahrain’s similar Qatar, Kuwait’s bit higher think 30% population locals. Based what? live Florida anything counting due contract chasing counting people  Positive cases may come contact number high. seems depend city. Target Burnsville people wearing masks. Targets Apple Valley significantly more. Semiautomatic Meanwhile, POTUS tweeting: “historic job numbers! #MAGA!” remember NY two cases state started shutting even fast enough Never tested = never coronavirus.

Win win all/s like defund education people somehow learn simple concepts.

Nvm, it... kinda get visiting second home, wrong riding bike? He's right everything else far, trust life future country. Go Dr. Fauci! love you! people like these, Yeah read mine? include disabled people starts deviate lot. people work too, administrator janitor, there’s rent licensing fees (which really high daycare).

I’m saying it’s high. God knows hate pay it. it’s much profit seems surface. understand them: hate them. US still figured testing; testing system actively overwhelmed again. 

That's really weird thing say considering US testing per capita [virtually every major world. That's European countries, Denmark (population less NYC) routinely ahead US.

600k tests per day *is wild*, capacity more.

So countries also overwhelmed? # chest X-Ray.... means it’s doubling. hospitals report possible covid code check in. could anything fever. upon stay hospital, find septic Mrsa reason, code rectified. stimulus bill compensate hospitals dependant outbreak. lead falsifying counts?!?
With CEO Cleveland Hospitals Florida walking job, think proof pudding Here’s new dashboard FL, written scientist created original one (and later meme undertaker one day. sweden think reported -1 deaths day (presumably correction), course internet decided -1 undertaker sitting realize lot healthcare shut elective/non-essential, right? 20% hospital business remains open, going nurses work do. going qualified handle COVID-19 cases, PPE, etc. point overstaffed.

In cases, government making sure jobs safe employees taken care of. fuck u guys awful. One would infer complications viral meningitis coronavirus linked. positive tests never indicator total positives. pulse % people infected. doubles next week, means real count also doubling. dude, i'm interested facts, facts say did. say significantly it. Ughh, what? spends like 70% answer explaining difference asymptomatic presymptomatic, studies talking refer truly asymptomatic cases, presymptomatic. literally spends whole time clarifying TALKING presymptomatic cases. yet made mistake again! one people well majority family. lot immunocompromised people family, virus could kill feels like one cares. partner sea world passes, stopped going beginning March started. Sea World already opened weeks ago, aren’t selfish pieces shit. basically inside past months, besides going work (he works environment really encounter people considered essential). terrifying can’t anything I’m already doing. Truth. Awful truth. 😞 deathtoll realy low last couple weeks, basicly reporting around 20 deaths week. Also reporting around 70 new cases day, 1% tests positive. I'd say we're ready, we've easing lock-down weeks numbers continue go l, amount tests go up.  Retired 49 stroke victim 

Get right, cupcake think people protesting? really dumb compare protesting survival going beach party whatever? Goddamn Americans really fucking stupid it’s almost comical. states forced open Governor's direction court systems. Demon Kane Corporate Kane believe lot discrepancy comes worldometer using Greenwich mean time reset time zone. websites showing data slightly different 24 hour periods. blows mind stupidity, pride, politics involved there's entire countries less cases one bigger states U.S. 

It's baffling broken system is. Fuck em. Let em burn. Sorry people tried take seriously die too, I'm hoping net positive impact gene pool. I'm pro eugenics, man situation shown couple good pandemics maybe we'll weed people think wearing mask political. fucking burn hell care.

Sorry pessimistic attitude, sick people treating literal life death political. Fucking animals. MUH CAR. DRIVE DRUNK WANT. GOD GIVEN RIGHT. That's people sound I'll take pleasure miserable deaths. reason looking old people moving states voting what's best them. Mount Nittany hospital can't handle surge ill students - neither Harrisburg area. 50,000 students. USA! USA! We’re #1! 

...and people still refuse wear face masks, wear improperly. dare Birx Fauci contradict potus message covid handled great job. rogue doctors spreading propaganda like 50k new cases yesterday people die preposterous.

The US disgrace. whine. got someone Facebook day. saying worry virus less 1% death rate. said not.true around 4-6% . said province. low population extremely spread out. Like biggest city population 100k. said base cases. math says 4.2% death rate. noooo person says right like 13 deaths population 1 million whole province.  sorry works 800 cases 13 deaths people gotten yet social distancing life here. cant say virus lethal based solely numbers. anomaly! Oh haveike 87 active cases 800 total cases detected. recovered. Apparently antibodies lasting 3 months max happen Floriduh. Said 22 yr Floriduh resident.  Especially extremely critical ICU patients need least five six medical professionals dire circumstances. Way go Florida!! it! /s case anyone needed it. Yes... like alive too. single parent, I'd rather orphan daughter. cannot wait move state That's bullshit, they're experts, they're people loudly saying, ""I think Americans dumb"" ... pretty blatant. Personally, listen people call peers dumb. to... prevent widespread panic Texas? Goddamn  Sounds like certain person Tremendously BIGLY hands. Lucky you. Make sure keep us Americans while.

I suppose vantage places world, America looks like Zombie Island everyone trying keep contained. i'm wrong, 2 billion doses ready go phase 3 results finished. 

deliveries start ASAP. atleast netherlands, entire population vaccinated weeks.


I still think whole oxford vaccine false hope. People already packed bars without wearing masks. Guess people are? TOURISTS STATES think accounted 1k new cases. Shall start taking bets next week?

Will hit 20k? last heard, 169,000 cases Florida. That’s 8,450 people die Rubio’s estimate. doesn’t factor long-term complications survivors (lung scaring, heart damage). Totally get man. hired new nanny cost us name Peppa pig! would imagine country finds incontrovertible evidence virus originated within borders would try cover political reason. yes I'm obviously including China too.

So would guess never find sure. suppose originate China, instead China site first superspreader event, implication would geopolitics? remember severely burned outpatient checkups every week, ended waiting extra four hours normal many stupid people fireworks grills fourth July weekend. Actually golf maybe... nobody immune. Golf still affected result doesn’t wipe lineup out. one player. yeah golf may exception. Dangit china, florida/?? perhaps yesterday's number? Maybe date things differently? Because, yeah, make sense. well-off kid bullshit.

I blame inbreeding.

And I’m allowed say Alabama native. deaths hospitalizations going though. Deaths lag cases ~7-12 days (and sometimes longer). right now, we're starting see increase deaths initial increase cases 2 weeks ago. see high death numbers rapid increase several days least. rolling 7-day average going flattened days ago, another couple days start up-turn 7-day rolling average. things working exponentials, problem suddenly is. Texas edition ranch trucks bought city suburbanites less fact many places host many athletes games one semi contained area. world sports complex made sort thing. tell people still wearing them, Pennsylvania gone completely ""MUH freedoms"" levels stupid. Gov. Wolf new Hitler, heard (no joke) he'll canceling Christmas year guy delivering oxygen store. wouldn’t know number lol Crowds + cost alone, keep away recessions different enough one another really used predict others go. 

More likely, stock market going stay high least January Executive Branch hitched economic saddle pumped full interest cash. knows new congress/leadership/etc. would bring.

The real economy, however, great. take walk outside high business area. Lots closed shops. Everything brittle economy failed once. Happens publicly traded. That's going take long time recover from. Well, completely different argument posters much valid one!

Mea culpa Same. decided kids can’t afford house private school can’t afford houses areas half decent public schools. anyone wondering, $30k total 22nd month, end either 10.7 million (30 day month) 21.5 million (31 day month).

What also shows, peoples southern US--unlike populations--are unable think terms even slightest short-term sacrifice prevention predictably catastrophic outcome. Many populations similarly thought able manage things, done better others.

The state fired data scientist created FL's Covid-19 dashboard manipulate data justify reopening.

Just yesterday article deaths across board up, indicating we're undercounting Covid-19 deaths 23%.

Here make look like there's virus growth reality spreading further.

The next thing could try look %positive rate week week. also flawed somewhat similar reason. tests limited would try save highest likelihood cases, availability would expand testing, could make appear though spread actually decreasing all.

The news article WHO’s stance previously masks didn’t offer kind protection.
And Cleveland clinic goes write updated study alters health experts’ previously held beliefs mask helped protect others virus person wearing mask.

It’s nonsense, face masks still protect others better. may protect wearer (at varying degrees) well.

I can't say states, Florida specifically, huge spike death rates cases pneumonia bronchitis compared previous years, likely covid related / induced, reported covid death. “Better” don’t want help political reasons. 

All studies date showed negative effect observational HCQ given sickest patients. Also, largest study retracted Lancet used falsified data (no doubt data providers would rather lie benefits give Trump “win” — like you). would thought testing = cases U-S-A!

The people issues before, issues now.

The difference is, landlords can't actually anything it. think also true. COVID everywhere Florida concentration. think lockdown answer, especially virus already widespread, originally locked down. Lockdown last ditch measure, huge collateral impacts, can't get shit together way. answer bullshitting public constantly actual leadership people trust, giving real information real risks are, smart distancing (I hate term social distancing), wear masks etc. We're complete shitshow here.  run tight ship. totally 100% protests, even though timeline really fit NY, PA, NJ, etc huge protests spikes.....nooo mah racist narrative make sense! really using word record type this? assume it’s always going get worse couple years look back pick day held record award it.

**Deaths**

The US 396 deaths per million, Sweden 532. However estimated underreporting deaths US 27,000, 82 per million; puts US 478 deaths per million. average Sweden’s neighbors 80 per million. 

**Cases**

The US 8,473 per million, Sweden 6,901 per million. Sweden’s neighbors 1,000 per million average Oh well, anecdotal evidence definitely means everything reading lies. least bad that, I've parents tell ""well WE'RE group 5. kids count""

Or fact US used vaccine campaigns past assassinate people we've determined enemies.

Or times pretended vaccinate people order see unchecked disease ravaged black communities many years ago.

The US inspired Nazi human experimentation. US rewarded Nazis giving immunity, giving new identities, relocating them. Well, right. think science-denying, willfully ignorant, uncaring piece shit wearing mask. There's really perspective offered. believe make less true. Winning. NY help sure. think bunch healthcare works wont bother states inflicting intentionally. Hard want help wont help themselves. Even worse. Deaths lag several weeks behind new cases (2-3 weeks IIRC). ~3-4 week delay lockdowns impact cases. 

So waited deaths spiked lock down, we'd looking 5-7 weeks additional disease replication. doubling every week, that's... 32-128x many cases.

Deaths mostly useful give us retrospective look pandemic evolved, try figure correction factors undercounting based enough testing.  Take precautions traveling quarantine arriving, probably required anyways. healthy traveling wear mask quarantine see problem. File people believe anything read internet. Love unattributed reporting super suspicious website. 

How [this [this [this one local news Yes I'm gonna guess 20k. Another redditor commented we're doubling every 7 days. would never know individual state ceiling many people could test day. Yep, original thought protect wearers all, wrong make sense. America: hospital bed everyone! Early early on. used increase cases state city. used title AMA. cases ""spiking"" now? mean?  death rate lagging indicator. Covid kill quickly, slow take weeks. even death, take several weeks death officially reported. deaths we’re seeing infections happened probably month ago. idea death rate current spike won’t awhile. Desantis said publicly due increase testing. test results taking week, ten days average get symptoms, that’s lot time. anything speed test results? seems huge issue. time results come back, contact tracing meaningless.  


Broward Coubty, Florida. Appreciate info!  deaths rising exponentially? Nope, I’m American that’s luxury lots international travel. I’ve lived couple different European countries periods time. 

America pretty unique regard, regrettably.  USA USA USA! Whaaa? don’t enough staff fancy glass hospitals? racism. One person outright mentioned batshit chinese folk medicine argued I'm following advice chinese government. remind, NFL \*also\* nonprofit organization. whole situation brought light toxic US politics become. made wearing mask political. also somehow made political question whether good idea largest protests US history middle pandemic. nuts can't find anyone saying ""wear damn mask no, though cause, time protesting streets"". Thanks everyone else correct fact adults like Disney. guess similar idea (pre-pandemic) adults enjoy going watch Pixar kids animation (PG rated) movie theater without kids. mean toy story 4 great all, making trip movie theater watch it... Different people make world go round guess. means actual unemployment probably 16 I’m seeing number reported anywhere else today far. half that. 

Not won’t get there.

Hah! Good joke Dude two beers three hours. Universal studios open like 2 weeks lived ATX years well. reps somewhat hampered WI Supreme Court ruling May. one really understands law enact health measures. It’s crazy go AZ governor kept local government anything (we see worked out), WI state legislators basically screwed governor local governments absolutely nothing numbers rise again. It’s extremely frustrating. Thank idiot voters, also middle south country, voted office continue vote politicians like office, solely R next names. stop testing get less cases said Donald trump Looks like naval command run doomers Open incognito skip survey. new record break boys!

- Arizona essential service!

(AEW handling better, also COVID exposure) Mass availability vaccines benefits rich much poor. hoard vaccine themselves, economy still hobbled population get out, work, consume widgets. vaccines mandatory school available free county health departments. (People afford generally get private doctors, convenient). seen essential service diseases could cause mass outbreaks, obvious investment disease currently ass raping economy.

Taxpayers probably pay 100% cost development, exchange get negative four hundred percent discount final product. corrupt system place years, reform patent purchase system drugs first, need vaccine ASAP. Don’t worry Florida vanish couple weeks. Hold tight alright. Wait, put cart horse.

Floridan also verify this. biggest hills ever see land fills lol. co worker years ago told weekends loved taking family top mountain picnic.

However haven’t looked cause mortality hospitalization could base. Definitely interesting though. surprised articles getting posted subreddit don’t comprehensive data global pandemic ""nothing afraid about"".

The swine flu 2009 global pandemic 60,000,000 people infected hardly anyone cared. 🤷 evidence going beach leads spike covid. possible 20k protest street doesn’t spread virus? told must wear mask social distance virus spread. none things. fact, exact opposite. either social distancing doesn’t work want defend due liking cause.


By logic also concerts long everyone wears mask. don’t see argue would cause spike cases since mass gatherings plus masked equals proof spreads. Exactly. swear, people get percents work something. I've heard people say justopen entire country worry covid since 5% death rate. realize entire country, literally like 15million people? start returning 70% positive tests cant talk way that. head another holiday weekend too. numbers gonna last it. comment funny me, often hear ""Sweden close borders protect neighbors"". Live preach. Feigenbaum’s constant δ live, die! live again! sub today - New study found masks effective preventing catching disease originally thought. I'm pretty sure put fireworks ass become immune covid. Or, know, get self quarantine 40% chance asymptomatic 99.9% chance survival. Exactly thinking. whole story sounds fishy. I'm sure information condition family situation withheld.

Whole thing trail run global warming Versus actually providing vaccines.

Or providing face reusable shields masks, making sure real quarantines quarantine field hospitals used. make states like IL, MN, MA, NH, NY? good enough position open back up?

Cases decline time. 

Also - constitutes dangerous spike cases? Would reopening cause spike regardless? ""How many infected today?""

""10 thousand infected, tested 40 thousand""

""10 thousand infected, great, terrible."" area, towns cancelled fireworks, private places have, two ski resorts golf club cancelled. We're basically worst-case scenario. things gotten worse sooner, everything would shut 4th. gotten bad, see much spread 4th.

Cases mean nothing. MN. allergies acted up, headache slightly stuffy nose, drive test got negative less 24 hours. people thought trump would sort disappear first came politics Basically disney accepts around 4,000 college international students year basically work normal employees guise internship. fun honestly, get perks employees like discounts, free entry family passes, professional internship anyway. think really thinks right way go virus standpoint. think thinks (probably correctly) way go political standpoint.

I'm sure hoping gets useful exercise. fair conclusion say virus presence judicious quarantine efforts? Actually Coronaviruses USA 1990's. Corona virus actually cautious parks

if cautious, fucking open first place ffs. See, don’t understand positivity rate. haven’t gotten tested symptoms. one house shown symptoms illness since February. order catch ANYTHING, we’d go get exposed someone comes over. happened, COVID cold symptoms, would get tested, since COVID one things circulating, could COVID. surprising? Ok expect positivity rates lower cold flu season cold-and-flu-like illnesses circulating. Covid doesn’t appear share typical seasonality. There's waves denial everywhere look. Gotta downvote news want hear. Like rocket ! waiting every day americans get denied care get substandard care. certain countries they're turning away people end dead within week. happens West people keep trucking along.

[That's already  get used it. know are...completely different universe I’m Florida still meeting people say “is virus “. read right. virus. still saying July . hol' up, subreddit 7 years old???? US COVID deaths topped 1,000 last two days, number hasn’t high since June 9th. There’s also two week lag cases deaths hospitals starting get overwhelmed. That's works. working Trump logic. They'll still cases matter test not. still significantly reduces possible directions droplets enter respiratory system... Jeez kind process determine efficacy drugs certain uses. Someone design one ran actuarial math found even 1% population died people would get economy would fine.

Technically they’re wrong part. average year, 0.85% US population dies anyway (2.8 million).

They figured lot COVID-19 deaths would overlap 2.8 million. probably incorrect, especially elderly.  OK yesterday talked weird long cold-like thing have, today feel bit worse it’s inconsistent, one day feel fine, next day throat hurts bit, etc etc. Today feels like there’s little build lungs somewhat urge cough, enough make cough lot. allergies cause coughing? so, would best explanation USA NUMBER 1!!!! schools start first week August? Based current exponential trend Florida, would actually closer 20K per day next Friday *without* factoring July 4th. Lock entire country again. Put large fines wearing masks. needs done everywhere, otherwise won’t work. GOP starting always followed idiotic opinion...

Jesus It'll worse Florida. 

This round way cutting social security. Let put layman's terms: there's people need intensive care units already full, *many quickly die. lot people could saved die.*  Based public announcements far, Florida's governor DeSantis seems okay that. know science new concept guys, there’s whole hypothesis-test-review process much method results. example proper, unbiased study: explore data condescension Lol concerns moderation choice specific concern regarding misinformation encourage use mod mail. senior moderator also always requested review something discuss feel mistake made. Better A/C house. I’d imagine less though.  **FOXNEWS** - That's culprit. astroturfs echo-chambers there. Shhhh...its natural selection work. antibody tests everyone attendance tests two separate antibodies show active infection inactive infection. pop antibodies say active infection immediately isolated nasal swab test confirm. one allowed facility tape.

Also venue MUCH better WWEs it’s outdoors open sunlight air circulation. It’s impossible still contract think mandatory face masks crowd would send good message. It’s replicating easier creating higher viral load article states don’t know mutation worse. Doesn’t higher viral load usually lead serious case? would biggest worry however could also mutate less serious take grain salt right now. That's death toll.

Infections stands 2.7 million right now. est, 15th start seeing rise...end month it'll clear, next month nightmare.

shrug way objectively measure merit. 4 years! Lmao. Governors loyal Trump go him. Worst elected official history US, sure random Mayors killed people fucked shit. scale trump fucking incredible. Anyone still supporting need psych eval. disagree you. tons reports prognostications totally wrong. People thoughts death rates far higher far lower appear be. People predicted far fewer far deaths far. ZERO bearing safe regardless taking pandemic seriously, perfectly fair want evaluate evidence claims made. americans **morbidly Obese**

This true. Why? called framing. wrong. 7/1 - 68k tests. 6/26 - 78k tests. Per Florida Department Healths daily Coronavirus summary. % positive 7/1 16.78%. Natural selection work. workers getting squeezed harder harder this. surprising many folks willing consider forms government feel gives chance. Exactly, here! Starts K ends aren. I'm expert this. believe different bacteria adapted different environments. bacteria deep ocean live near lava tubes. live Artic. However, think safe say bacteria better warm wet places.

You said Covid going around forever vaccine would nothing stop it. currently killing 125k people months. So, flu MASSIVELY control vaccine admitted above?

Seriously, fucking humility life, realize wrong vaccines work, move on. pathetic digging hard, anti-vaxxer?

E: wtf kind point ""Show Covid vaccines"" thats entire point, waiting need social distance quarantine out....

Everyone likes blame corporations flaws corporations ultimately beck call mass consumer. real problem public/consumers  Unmitigated disaster.  clear statement paper, peer reviewed publication. probably someones thesis grade. 

If kind good evidence said, would believe it, countless years research saying people large groups spread diseases makes common sense point. Far young die virus countless fools declaring hoax. possible close borders states US (legally praxis)? lol cause, make - wont know youre gonna catch shit wherever hell go....nor WHO. Employer, employee, janitor - suspects else do? Beat stupid them? using weeks test numbers last weeks test results? tested last Saturday Florida, still don’t results. No, really doesn't. forget kid important job still trust 2x growth rate 7 days.

At least hit inflection point. Yes. That’s challenge. ‘norm’ needs shift. Desperately. math that’s kinda nuts. It’s taken March June get America around 5 7% infected. Herd immunity kicks around 60% more. you’re looking getting half America infected next 6 months, probably happening winter months. 

Buckle up. Terrible times ahead you, they... I'm sorry. wish nation need learn lessons blood :( This. NL neck neck UK months bad UK still one worst categories handling virus. Yet Rutte considered handled well! unbelievable many people brainwashed!

Basically data sets actually perfectly normal, basically data sets average median actually going identical. 

But data sets strongly normal, like iq distributions, median average quite close. 

Close enough used interchangeably stand routine without meaningfully affecting joke.

You're pointing distinction without difference here. Yes maybe 50.5% stupider, that's still ""half"" casual conversation. dont seem see article 

Would strawman youre referring to? fully agree. they're 4 5 fine go school enjoying company 4 5 year olds. infants toddlers want mom. infants around provide benefit ""Hardly something afraid about"" talking about? global pandemic. global pandemic ""nothing afraid about"". Yet deaths per 7 day average Identical nearly every week since March. America fucked.  Ahh

Take look yourself

then make CHANGE matter. there's large enough sample size show accurate representation doubling time Damn school start early America ?  make wealth gap even worse. Families time and/or money keep kids home so. you’ll less privileged kids school. know it, parents give shit school runs around kids home. get reallllyyy shitty schools. Intriguing, death rate hospitalization rates seen similar increase?

Also, there’s chatter probably cases counted positive cases.

Finally, what’s accuracy testing, many false positives/negatives ? Yep. Great idea NPR caller whose husband left house could return work, he's surfing couch something stay home quit job sick struggling find childcare job usually every weekend well weekdays. quit job end Feb decided become self employed (beauty industry) work home could work round son. 
Then lockdown happened.

Keep mind *also* first time history Fed directly intervened keep markets up. Prior recently goal monetary policy nation, keeping stocks up. *should* stock market agnostic. U A!

I would argue 50/100,000 useful high pop, high density counties. low pop, rural county, means may high mobility; county population 100,000, 50 people could caused single exposure event quickly controlled mitigated.

It would interesting see equivalent US county European areas similar social determinants health. test dead people. no. second wave here. superimpose top first, never receded. rogue waves form. Ask sailors feel rogue waves. That's reality land now. understand intentions behind either event different. what? virus doesn’t care getting hand now. First came people government nothing... dogs!? rate less 3 months entire population Florida injected. proof antibodies staying people long time? know person tested positive 3 months ago ab’s now. Damn yo, Florida absolutely killing it! mean it’s population. here, couple people seated behind plexi take orders handle pickups. food hands faster pandemic. annoyance people seem respect line extending outside keep interior less crowded, they'd push go front (where staff ignored line went down).

The Electoral College, Comey Russia? suppose voter apathy. No, I'm sure wouldn't. Sorry. Wrong answer. That's way Tulsa rally Thank you! wonderful thing say!  reminder USA currently showing lowest amount daily Covid deaths since March.

The daily deaths falling steadily past month continue trend i've strangely noticed well denver... maybe they're vain looks priority either dying, getting permanent disability, killing others? fascinating mindset, psychologists going mountain new data study over. state getting dead tbh might want check Brazil wife persistent cough got test GP two days notice.

Hershey Park (in Hershey PA) opened week! season pass substantially discounted! Mass deaths say? NPC incredibly sheltered teenager said, without hint irony. California 8,441 new cases. Announced today. RIP Van Winkle Denmark put kids back school April quite high cases per capita. Higher Florida. still fine got virus control. Keeping kids home school isn’t good them. political garbage Trump hates Whitmer. Ideally, get tested 3 days symptom onset. get tested early, higher risk false negative (there infection test failed detect it). 3 days symptoms onset, reliability peaks 80%.

Y’all never closed lol! Keep mind full reopening least, taking measures safely significantly reduced capacity Sanction China now! Showed him, sure understand. arguing different points. sole point it’s better percentage go up. certainly regret making simple statement point. Good grief. case, sounds completely asinine. someone say hospital business running 20%? case, hospitals clearing whole wings Covid patients straight building temporary areas help alleviate limitations current capacity.

* edit, stating rhetorical honest question directed you. That's true, Americans far worse most. still truth among humanity. mean, not... yea(h), sure.  someone bang trash can. maybe they'll take hint. woohoo. go gators!!! Yeah like, perverse incentives staggering. sick can't pay co-pay? Better stay home infect everyone else. Oh, can't afford late rent? Better go work. Everything basically working favour ""Don't seek medical care, go infect people"". people get close death, go hospital, fuck lives anyway. Like shit, Americans banded together universal health care? guess free die lose everything worked for, that's something... yea, can't imagine disconnect someone want go disney world right now. get people need distraction, come on... believe yesterday jackass governor plans close shop again, closed much start with. Oh Christ. Good luck Looking percentage tests return positive also helps.

If dramatically increase testing percentage cases postive gets lower, that's good sign. earlier numbers artificially inflated testing people likely COVID, like came hospital symptoms.

However, number testing goes way up, percentage positives *also* goes (as many states), sign things may even worse numbers show. studies date showed negative effect observational 

This study, claims helps, **is** observational.

The RECOVERY trial, showed doesn't, actual RCT. Hospitalizations rising substantially many areas. Also deaths lag several weeks. obvious interpretation graphs deaths begin rising soon likely seeing thousands deaths day weeks.  wish could stage coup d'etat guess ends Germany Florida category questions. California's situation probably similar Germany's situation back early April. combination lot things explaining situation Italy France. Basically everything said comment chain also said Germany 3 months back, varying degrees truth. ( )

On April 5th, using numbers reported article, Germany stood 1,584 deaths 100,123 known confirmed cases (\~1.6% CFR).

***Perhaps people tested California early patients caught virus Austrian Italian ski resorts relatively young healthy, Professor Kräusslich said.

***Perhaps people coronavirus infections spread, older people hit death rate, 0.2 percent two weeks ago, risen, too. average age contracting disease remains relatively low, 49. France, [it [in Italy according latest national reports.

***Perhaps we're testing explanation low fatality rate Germany testing far people nations. means catches people symptoms, increasing number known cases, number fatalities.

***Perhaps we're better treating also significant medical factors kept number deaths Germany relatively low, epidemiologists virologists say, chief among early widespread testing treatment, plenty intensive care beds trusted government whose social distancing guidelines widely observed.

***Perhaps need wait see everyone run course disease:***

As July 5th, sit 9,061 deaths 196,372 known confirmed cases. (\~4.6% CFR) ( )

\~4.6% certainly much lower see look number NY (\~7.7%), Italy (\~14.4%), Spain (\~9.5%), France (17.9%), etc., still relatively high concerning number 1.6%\~2.6% article written see California right now. Freedumb... like that. imagine effectively bluff get bunch people quit save money. worry, TX right behind. 

Vote people responsible infecting potentially killing people. Congrats! someone owns hotel chain. What's surprising apparently voracious reader. Usually people read lot bit logical.

Before everyone freaks saying people DONT read ARENT logical. Made China great believe double standards politicians.  American people something best interest best interest others... Whaaaaaaaat? Blasphemy unpatriotic!! depends. services basically saved restaurants parts Europe. country (Poland) first lockdown rules March April drive thru delivery, Europeans like drive thru much less, services expanding fast less urban regions restaurants happy join responsible business (McDonald’s 80% delivery, 20% drive thru insanely low numbers even fancy restaurants joined tried delivery survive). take reopened, started protest charges, take opened also restaurants shopping malls even started, everything reopened basic social distancing late May restaurants started getting really pissed dropped services, others inflated prices added insane fee. lockdown era, services saved lot places. Ya basic law economics people rational. always see, true high hospital capacity normal, unsustainable months? normal, normally this.

Remember back April hospitals across country laid staff? bet would've helped right now. Actually, [they've continually furloughed later? They've completely transparent along testing reporting done way places. 

My mother's home town reported cases they're whatever threshold set. words, people tested positive, many them. 

I'm saying Sweden's things ""right,"" terms allowing spread continue relatively high levels, healthcare system keeping fine still. think hospital knows what's up. know plenty others don't. Hell, even convince medical doctor back early March masks works even thought offer 100% protection. constituents don’t fall far rotten tree probably fire point someone Georgia, we're glad Florida exists make terrible re-opening look good comparison dat nba bubble tho Guys said word like give man gold XD XD one understands it. baffling. think randomness superspreading events makes one area take months low grade viral circulation. Kind like starting fire. Sometimes happens first match strike, times. news reporting heavily key points?

True IFR (not CFR) around 0.1-0.3%, likely 0.26% stated recent studies

Virtually documented spread school-aged children

The fact obesity major risk factor, pushing weight management, locking people inside. obese person dies virus, ""healthy"" person

Hospitalizations deaths falling even though cases rising, primarily among younger demographic extremely safe virus complications

The fact Houston hospital directors general counsel 13 major Texas hospitals come stating close overloaded covid cases, despite news reporting 

The fact overall, all-cause deaths US substantially different 2017-18 flu season

The fact many protesters encouraged leave phones home turn off, meaning contact tracing worked. importantly, really spread, still can't large outdoor gatherings go beach

Goalposts moved ""flatten curve"" ""eradicate virus"" - something feasible without ruining economy

The fact lockdowns disproportionately hurt lower income communities, black communities included

Overall, deadly virus far viruses go. Anyone internet find try, people relying mainstream news sources information getting irrationally scared. responsibility inform public, generate fear buzz gain. far mainstream news source accomplished goal factual objective reporting accountability. 

Thank answering questions thread. Thankfully Sahara cloud actually stunted hurricane season quite bit. anyone know costs possible pricing vaccine? going get ripped blatantly? thinking like logical person. start thinking like someone would go world's visited theme park July state that's hot spot country cases. reason collegue died based crappy business decision manager, probably managers boss.

And that's unhealthy ""working ethic"" ours, sick leave non-existent expected work anything short comatose. Note: Florida's two low days Sunday Monday, positivity rate way testing way down, likely indicating numbers lower lack testing. Inb4 Trump issues executive order arrest anyone trying test people covid Made things even worse. result lies, people wear masks hospitals overwhelmed, exacerbating demand PPE hospitals.
