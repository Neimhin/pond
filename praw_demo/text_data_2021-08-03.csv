0,2021-08-03,"  Read again: religious, medical, 100% remote exemptions stay effect. temporary exemption “it’s fully approved” exemption. one expires FDA grants approval.

This system many universities already use requiring vaccination records MMR similar. Schools done years. it’s forever, what’s end goal simply move lives treat like viruses live yearly? numbers longer justify measures, unless plan treating flu way now. flu cause overwhelmed ICUs middle summer. people Reddit like panic tbh  0 200m doses? Decent odds, I’d say. Close multi state lotto jackpot odds. I'm holding judgement preprint CDC based part policy around savaged peer review. There's lot people parroting vaccinated spread delta much unvaccinated thanks CDC, would like least see studies collaborate claim better ""About 100 people vaxxed non-vaxxed, breathed air virus noses, means spread equally."" ""A bunch vaccinated people standing-room indoor venue breathing heavily dancing mingling close proximity represents everyday risk environment vaccinated person's capability spread virus."" see claims stretch logic. like that. Let’s refer willfully unvaccinated dirty people. They’re literal danger society.  Wow, easy! vaccine hesitant people would like questions answered, non-judgemental way? It’s insane make anyone anything, want to. doesn’t virus. McLovin! US holding everyone else back. Pretty much every country verifiable, digital system place, US can't even database. Downvoted wild speculation. What.a bunch. idiots.   Clinical trials **CANCER DRUGS.** Again, call cancer pandemic. Except seems legitimate medical concern doctor discussed led taking vaccine.  Explain thought process, still get transmit virus. Pete one risk becoming sick. they’re protecting him?  That's first time I've heard one people admit wrong think. need expert know lol Oh well, unvaccinated people might get seriously sick vaccinated people fine. I'm dying go music festival man. legitimate health reason

Key word ""claims"". also claimed bunch BS. 

I appreciate band standing stupid. I’ve seen asking around doesn’t seem like will. isn’t even sure it’s vaccine avoidant, one study wasn’t peer reviewed found could be. like talking brick wall, taxing. Let's assume 100% right, one age 24 spread it. teachers 24? Staff? Students? master degree program, doctorates, etc? Surely people age 24 university.

And reason wearing mask required vaccination mandate asymptomatic covid spread, breakthrough delta variant spreads seeing pop country, including nearby [Provincetown] Even vaccinated, catch it.

Even [CDC updated citing ""It cites combination recently obtained, still-unpublished data outbreak investigations outside studies showing vaccinated individuals infected delta may able transmit virus easily unvaccinated. Vaccinated people infected delta measurable viral loads similar unvaccinated infected variant.""

Try stay safe class, friend. happy read article. I’m nearly 43 completely skipped period two months ago. Wasn’t particularly stressed, assumed perimenopause. realizing timing second dose Pfizer. useful information! I’m pro-vax, heads possible side-effect would nice.

(Also, happy cake day!) many people assume it’s like Plague, Inc. forgot bring mine second dose, carry around TWO them. maybe impetus karens bobs get militant everyone getting vaccinated Well vaccinating children seem divide experts well. Many countries planning opening 18. Also BACK SCHOOL crowd wants too. Let's act like everyone ignoring what's happen schools next month. sensible thing do. reason dirty people permitted mingle clean people. Thanks!!  numbers seem similar much less contagious version? mostly surprised experts seem still hope could slowed people longer staying home social distancing.

I haven’t heard described way that’s simple enough average American understand (not sure elsewhere world) another commenter sub said something night… basically, point, it’s matter either getting sick covid, getting vaccine. course regardless people proudly choose former...

So many people know fence vaccine listening people around convincing to. shit spreading poisonous virus. don’t think it’s fair dismiss people stupid. think people need targeted messaging, us smart socially responsible thing.

I also can’t believe kids 12 STILL cannot get vaccinated, that’s another story. doomed, damned putting blame everyone 93 degrees right Oregon still pretty much fine. Apparently DeSantis realize summer North America right now?

People wearing masks inside though vaxxed county state, case numbers still low.

I wonder correlation. crisis disreputable Chinese companies exploiting knockoffs expired product short time. China got pretty strict that, unique way. buy KN95s days I'm pretty confident product.

But need level confidence, pay extra N95s (the regulated US standard) vendor AMA approved respirator list. Yep, might increase uptake due full approval. However, real benefits entities comfortable requiring vaccine, along doctors able prescribe third dose label. makes say that? actual hell think going happen? think Ireland place vaccine pass introduced without option negative test, whose intention increase uptake. really don’t think reality good. feel like we’re still nervy last year justifiably angry people haven’t gotten vaccinated, isn’t forever. peak south, move elsewhere. We're far bigger UK. going hit different regions US different times. **""Lightfoot: regrets Lollapalooza concerns become super-spreader I'm trolling. think insane pressure someone take experimental chemical virus that's much different flu. Totally understand that. risk mitigated vaccinated. less likely people infected vaccinated. postponed year looks like corona going fo us foreseeable future. point I’m living mitigate stage. Nice! go whenever get takeout provided hot sauce salsa lacking. problem unvaccinated people, problem people going around pandemic without wearing proper protective gear others. criminally-negligent sociopathic thing anyone do, they've told credible authority A-OK it. they're it.

The entire discussion vaccinated MacGuffin real story vaccinated people silent carriers transmitters pandemic number COVID-positive vaccinated people underestimated aggregate level mid-government order magnitude. people making conclusions based bad data, that's saying that.

""CDC's recent published data says July 26 6,587 hospitalizations among fully vaccinated Americans 1,263 deaths. Research NBC News indicates number hospitalized died already passed 7,300 30 states providing data.

While states track breakthrough cases meticulously, others — like Missouri, cases surging — lack ""quality statewide data,"" according state officials. states choosing release partial data.

Robert Long, spokesperson Maine Department Health Human Services, said, ""Those fully vaccinated breakthrough case symptomatic part regular testing protocol may never captured numbers.""

Critics agency like former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, said federal officials failing capture overall scope infection Covid cases. Gottlieb told CNBC Friday, ""I suspect probably one 10 infections actually getting reported.""

(from ) *may* reduce transmission *if* get infected Covid. make less likely get infected Covid first place, thus reducing overall risk transmission. shows reddit flips fuck anytime encounters anything even slightly lefty opinion. guess since research deeply, saw one fields studies clinical trials, would think would actually decent expert weigh quality study CDC used. Okay coerce people getting vaccinated (unethical itself). next? COVID-19 going away variants emerge around world matter do. “no covid” goal delusional simply asking restrictions indefinitely. goal get vaccines want protect get hospitalizations manageable level like yearly flu. Mission accomplished. wasn’t point… that’s game want play okay, also require kids get chickenpox vaccine, disease kids healthy immunocompromised virtually 0% chance dying from. Polio example vaccine required kids, one state NY. bad part misinformation makes people want baby due one somehow think it’ll mess chances one somehow linked sort ailment. dumb become believe bs. Ever DMV past years see lines? ever try call DMV got someone line within 15 minutes?

Try out... mean, that's fine good, vaccinated people still dying, children others can't vaccinated.  informed ignorant 2 different things. anti-vaxxers latter getting news FB memes natural science websites start asking secondary contemporary documentation (like Instagram post, it’s Gen Z ffs) don’t hand, need look closely cards determine authenticity. Yup, would assume same. Gotta thorough science, especially health. Conservatives “we love Constitution”. Also Conservatives “we’re cool unconstitutional vehicle stops”  cascade people shitty music tastes extra annoying overlap folks ones praising Trump pushing FDA move faster (in general, pre-pandemic) fucking circle. remember getting one J&amp;J. wonder verify them. fire rises. Wish they'd go get vaccinated Scientists look new variant decide worse. Reporters look science decide get clicks it. delta lambda might matter. delta matters.

More concretely, alpha fastest spreading voc long time. Iota maybe late arrivers matched it. Gamma spreads even faster definitely worse. alpha gamma rapidly displaced everywhere delta - vaccines completely crush them. lambda displaced gamma; much less contagious delta.
 Nice post, great points. Doctors' discretion full approval boosters.... every kid needs complete supervision homeschooling. program use keeps daughter interested engaged. Sometimes needs help printouts questions material otherwise great job sitting knocking schoolwork. Next conspiracy theory: gov wants round unvaxxed made tyson chicken nuggets. That's they're disappearing cuz delta. yeah ain't gonna pulling white folk, brown ones thats fine racist pieces shit. Unfortunately, wrong.  know meat packing industry argued laws. Ok effects, compare actual COVID 50% right side bell curve, 50% left. Gotta make sure pens/handwriting look like done different days two shots. wish way check vaccine batch numbers location. Like ask students where/when got shot see batch place time. Schools closed time, however. Brown. means brown. U.S., 347 million doses administered* ... 


and hospitals full unvaccinated.

The vaccines work safe comparison risk Covid-19. Literally every post vaccine symptom disregarded “anxiety” related

I’ve hell ordeal since vaccination back March, can’t tell many times doctors told it’s “anxiety”, something I’ve never life

They finally started believe last month they’re people coming similar post vaccine symptoms   Forgery felony kids!  Let idiots sort existence Coz masks stop aerosols. Said rational person ever. sure entire outbreak politicized (ok, lying know why) dialogue destroyed moment. Masks one use case. keep us spitting one another. well known minor concern pulmonary viruses. say well known even though appears completely foreign masses. People don’t learn. Something like happened albeit religious gathering India gave birth Delta Variant. Idk give rise to. Also keeping mind people drunk, screaming lungs crowded area, knows might give rise to…

Hopefully vaccine requirement/negative test requirement would ensure nothing bad happens.. Take photo card phone Fauci even said potentially within next 2 weeks....

Please point said that. starts 16th, yeah. public universities including mine start week 23rd. Getting two birds stoned once. crazy surveillance system China since pandemic

and b/c crazy ass system, theres random gun shootings every weeks so. Data one day necessarily indicate trend. Dunedin/Clearwater absolutely worth spending long weekend vacation :) Lord, hope one said that. Everyone wear masks distance. I’ve wearing masks around high risk people see, even though vaccinated. still see 95 year old grandmother least week. fine. got vaccinated last April. got vaccinated March. together indoors good amount time. 

We aren’t hanging around maskless, unvaccinated people may infected, like family did. **Text article:**

Almost 72,000 children teens caught Covid-19 last week -- ""substantial"" increase week earlier, American Academy Pediatrics reported Tuesday.

The group counted 71,726 new cases July 22 - 29. ""substantial"" increase nearly 39,000 cases reported week before, five times many kids sick end June. definition child varies state generally includes age 17 18.

After decreases reported cases past couple months, July numbers started trending upward highly transmissible Delta variant virus became dominant country.

""That's high considering fact vaccinated now, that's telling us unvaccinated people getting infected higher numbers virus infectious Delta variant,"" said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chief division infectious diseases Department Pediatrics Stanford Medicine chair AAP committee infectious diseases.

More 4.2 million kids tested positive Covid-19 since start pandemic. Children teens represented 19% reported cases latest weekly data.

The report comes schools started soon start, requiring masks social distancing, cases many parts country surging hospitalizations levels seen months.
Enter email sign CNN Ten newsletter.

At one Georgia school, 100 students quarantine nine students five staff members tested positive Covid-19 days first day back.

Children 12 years old eligible three vaccines currently used United States, fast-spreading Delta variant put especially risk, health experts say.

Vaccines tested children young 6 months, probably available children younger 12 several months.


""Our sense kids can't get vaccinated, parents clearly vaccinated themselves, kids 12 older vaccinated well,"" Maldonado said.

Dr. Trey Dunbar, president Lady Lake Children's Hospital Baton Rouge, Louisiana, agrees, saying children victimized pandemic simple solution: adult vaccination.

""Covid preventable disease,"" said. ""It's hard us pediatricians see kids affected preventable disease. Children like adults. choice get vaccinated. Parents responsible choices. yes, makes big difference adults make decisions kids adults make decisions could maybe prevent diseases see children.""

Leaders around country taking various approaches keep children safe, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox saying state give away KN-95 masks children, Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson calling state's legislature amend law order give school districts flexibility require masks.

The academy, represents pediatricians, pointed severe illness still appears rare among children. number hospitalizations remained steady much pandemic. Children accounted 1.3%-3.5% hospitalizations, depending state.

Seven states reported child deaths Covid-19 pandemic. Monday, US Centers Disease Control Prevention reports 526 deaths among children ages 0-17.

Among 25 million US children 12 17 years old, 10.9 million vaccinated least one dose vaccine, according CDC data.  may interject rant... Reddit =/= entirety humanity. nowhere even close representative demographic. Ah...now may policy please come San Diego next.  I'm assuming they're implying total number cases (denominator) would lower people vaccinated (which true). Thus number cases kids active covid cases, constant, would higher % total number cases. 

But account total number cases down, fewer children would contracting covid, impossible determine % would higher lower. % matter though. goal fewer # kids (and people) getting covid. damn right, blame recent surge unvaccinated dickheads chosen allow *cannot* take vaccine remain around us *chose* take vaccine come around so.

But, people *chose* take vaccine safe *cannot* take vaccine extremely high risk activities.

It's really fair. go get shot *if can* big deal *a people* can't live life. Companies greedy. entire reason exist.  late now. shortage oxygen, surplus patients. honestly don’t even care anymore. get get it. won’t end well go lockdown again. Especially wife pregnant than. daughters, 6 8, started school week. remote last year required in-person year. 

Guys I’m stressed worried them. Maybe 10% kids masks on. It’s mandated.

What do? don’t know do? can’t mask mandate vaccine available. feels much oppressive force classroom delta. infection rate area 12%. hug unvaccinated infected person spend 10 days indoors masks, really think vaccine protect getting infected? question morality forcing children isolate endure severe restrictions protect adults access vaccine refuse take.  say GOP. said corporations.

Having said imagine tons pro-Trump GOP voters unable use internet buy gasoline corporations deemed national security risk.

I think pooled PCR type test fecal samples (including near insects like flies &amp; ticks, mosquitoes, etc) sequence positive.

There countless folks (like me) shots carry greater risk virus. us don’t publicly share private decision made careful consideration doctors. know it’s easy conversation unfold. looks like half population shockingly different reaction jabs expected — it’s probably life experiences actually shockingly different, reasons range conscientious risk/benefit analysis, financial inability take time work/lack health care event potential side-effects, understandable distrust system never prioritized health well-being communities.

Yea, like Tom Petty back down. going keep course admit wrong would damage him. opponent next year FL gov doesn’t use “DeSanitize Florida” campaign know yet catching COVID, recovering, better, same, worse protection vaccine?

• it’s less protective vaccines, lot?  ask people actually made political? Covid become massive political thing one political group. ain't tree bark at. Haha. FANTASTIC.  Approved 12 kids? I’m sure would like nothing done, finish gathering &amp; analyzing data, adult &amp; teen age groups. can’t cut corners, even we’d like too.

My specific concern case appears inefficiency specific scenario: Pfizer announced clinical trials 12's long time ago. FDA remained silent quantity children included studies, Pfizer met recently FDA said needed include children. Given demand parents desperately trying get kids clinical trials seems like would easy add people FDA given guidance back Spring could months closer approving vaccine kids 12 can’t skip important steps, can’t.

I definitely want safety compromised studies. However, recent delay gives impression someone dropped ball -- either Pfizer knowing FDA expected contacting FDA get clarifications, FDA front Pfizer needed. possibilities like new data arose required studies account (e.g. dosage looks like needs changed) seen information along lines indicate FDA asking additional children late game. virus circumvents vaccines, think start new era. Governments choice either let run wild millions die, or, they'll institute martial law lock everything down. Unvaccinated adults also far less likely avoid death contract virus, 25x less likely fact, least they're consistent. Why? Waves come go latest drop showed it. Plus cases Scotland too, afaik Scotland never ""reopened"" like England did. Double vaxxed masked Florida. Pretty much circle well. Florida *very* divided. find sanity cities mix 'burbs then, yeah, orange-man cult central rural areas.

I live city Tampa proper. local government reps Democrats want right thing public health. /other/ half state drags us down.

Seems safest everyone involved. hope bf end OK. know figures Chronic Fatigue Syndrome affect people influenza mild viruses.

In words - obviously, theoretically - would letting ""poorer nations catch up"" reducing worldwide spread virus enabling vaccinated people booster?

I'm genuinely curious - evidence benefits one and/or other. baffling people seem assume covid exceptional case that, unlike literally every similar virus before,

a. never go away (and mean ""eradicated"", mean never even wane)

b. never respond vaccines. could just, know, mandate vaccine. course, flip side craziness: person driving car freeway, mask on.

I fitted masks, they're really comfortable they're on, they're easy get without messing hair. 

So put front mirror, stays I'm done. God speed brave good cod, God speed understanding DeSantis would declare state emergency, similar hurricane natural disaster. Biden could (and would) send resources. involve federal facility, federal government limited do. way federal government (and Constitution) set up, states lot power control happens within borders. federal government jurisdiction happens states, much less happens within states. responsible, ethical leaders, problem, opposite right now.

(Two traditional medicine practitioners used trust. longer work them. One friend pulled conspiracy theories addled partner). actually also find religious views ridiculous. don’t think people hold views deserve die horribly, even behavior extremely damaging troubling (not taking kids medical care, genital modification babies, fighting birth control options others). things bad don’t merit death penalty. 

It’s hard anti vaxers beliefs behaviors harm others they’ve pretty much created devastating health crisis could point averted. Many awful, selfish ignorant. still don’t wish suffering still care harmed. hope protected variants create. hope parents assisted living facility aren’t killed breakthrough infections passed unvaccinated staff (WHY won’t place mandate shots workers???). 

It upsetting see people saying hope care unvaccinated suffer die. admit extremely angry afraid crisis causing wish change ideas behavior, suffer. Although sometimes want punch them, refrain.

Good!! got see news Everytime think something hyped much media, isn't. First OG Coronavirus. bunch memes posted Reddit media overreacting back early 2020. March happened. variants started appearing, people insisting everything going fine vaccines now, media making big deal nothing. Delta variant happened. 

I'm saying always trust media, really (especially FOX CNN everything sow doubt vaccines), need stop underestimating thing. really fantastic articles/threads like guy wanted see long could continue get paid without actually work job. year turns out.

Their second life articles second none. remember Second life guest speaker sort virtual lecture hundreds people. Something Awful goonsquad showed made rain penises. sure you’re downvoted. Young people (millennial gen z) lazy. know I’m gen z millennial. that’s true every generation young. Young people Lowest voter turnout every election. they’re lazy get vaccinated. I’m sure everyone here, know young people, know haven’t gotten vaccine lazy put off. 

I remember vaccine made available young people everyone saying percent young people getting vaccinated lower young people became eligible compared elderly…well it’s many months us young people lazy. Again, hating millennials/gen z specifically. covid happened boomers teens/20’s they’d lazy bums, too. even migrants infected covid, resounding message conservatives big deal? care virus that's big deal?

Some us watch *House*.  shit sounds way familiar.. Southern California checking in.  agree coercing people getting medical procedure that, statistically speaking, provides little benefit good chunk population?

Japan people 40s right? seems like lot vulnerable people already vaccinated I’d like point people question given AstraZeneca, offers strong protection hospitalization death far less effective terms preventing symptoms (particularly Beta) mRNA vaccines are. possibly explain breakthrough infections happened. perhaps assume people read article there’s one thing know young people it’s they’re lazy. Lowest turnout voting every single election, lowest % getting vaccine, etc. etc.. pure laziness. See ya lata, Parada.

Increasing gap saved lives too. probably public policy issues disagreement gets economics culture wars, etc. I've noticed people disagree anthropogenic climate change theory say science bad, ""*the* science"" bad. example, say data manipulated reach foregone conclusion. case, attacking science motivations people studies. Or, attack grant funding model that--according them--favors studies whose outcomes support climate change theory. 

And realy, comes probaby different philosophy humans react indeed warming climate. generally suspicious top solutions take account immediate short term economic pain local economies. going studies fine tooth comb, looking faults, solution.

So dad probably lot agree science involves something besides divisive issues.  thought dick prick I’ve taking time released melatonin stay asleep years now. know shouldn’t take several times week, it’s hard sometimes wake middle night get go back sleep. seems fairly harmless compared sleep drugs. 


Maybe keep using regularly.  Please go read PhD manuscript tell us every mistake made. they'll equate odds getting checked flu way dismiss hoax. everyone returning second Nitpick want. vaccinated allowed college unvaccinated might not. Quite fitting since doubt anti-vaxxers would get far place learning anyway. Provincetown highly vaccinated area, naturally percentage recently infected people would made mostly vaccinated ones. goes “certain areas” high vaccination rates. 

My neighborhood vaccination rate 86%, there’s good chance amount people recently infected (if any) would darn near 100% breakthrough cases vaccinated people.

None means vaccines aren’t working well enough vaccinated people make teeny tiny fraction new cases. Actually **would** sudden drop.

Population growths follow logistic (not exponential) curve whether population mice, humans, people who've infected delta. derivative logistic curve (the rate change, words, context - number new daily cases) symmetrical - goes fast went up.

The surprise *when* peak happened relative sharpness peak. falling quickly went least bit surprising. However, several possible explanations ""when"": things like schools breaking up, spell really nice weather people spending time outside rather indoors unventilated places, end euros etc., probably larger factors night clubs reopening.

Here picture logistic curve (the red line) derivative (the rate change, blue line). context, red line would total who've infected delta, blue line daily new cases.

The idea population growth reaches gradual plateau gradual fall probably eyeball red line, look like gradient really starts shallowing x=2. reality started falling quickly rose x=0. Thank getting it! really knows what's going on

That basically sums UK Govenrment Either one guy getting jacked tits good old-fashioned bartering economy full flow. submitted application bit less month Pfizer.  can't take anymore guys. End it. fake id 21 inherently ""cool"" reason, cool cuz buy fun booze friends 21.

No factor exists faked vaccine cards Every one thought covid beat spring going happen places, right now, without risking stupid shit. 

Unfortunately, looks like going burn few.  someone might medically unable get vaccine. understand Folks aware around long while. They're coming around idea putting lives hold indefinitely likely harmful disease (both personal mental &amp; financial health nation's economy).

At point we're going learn live disease, 90% UK adults antibodies virus (either vaccination knowingly unknowingly already disease) 

...so comes reopening society many people asking ""if now, when?"" 😡😡😡😡👊👊👊👊👊 Good news: original variant Alpha variant almost completely eliminated United States. Unfortunately, Delta variant lot contagious. And, realistically, 70% number never going good enough, goal Biden thought actually achievable.  seeing US ever another lockdown. Simple put financial support . point happen mask mandate might issued even shaky ground. get sicker quicker covid snicker get thicker quicker.

I mean causes erectile dysfunction. Two questions:

1) CDC say vaccinated people transmit virus like unvaccinated people? (And, fact, entire reason vaccinated people masking again?)


2) long someone - ""medically fragile"" due historical medical condition - ""keep ass home""? safe come out? danger Covid passed?


🤔  I'm sorry man saw way many people forget card. back card literally says please bring vaccine card appointments 

And giving vaccines Bay Area, educated area... point didn’t say that. bring events weeks decline rather mentioning events on-going? 

Also no, cases skyrocket events would expected continue trajectory weeks event over. increase R would continue 2+ weeks event over. decline unexpected impact events (at least euros) pretty clear unsurprisingly far greater whatever events going now. 

Are trying argue didn’t impact current events would similar one? message gringo bandits bottle. really. severe outbreaks several totalitarian countries absolutely idea China actually doing. know, China awesome restricting flow information topic. Also, certainly assumed open China would far advanced vaccination campaign. going get mandatory unscientific analysis says Euros outsize effect transmission. caused steep peak fall.

Yeah, perfect enemy good, and, raging pandemic, need good enough solutions. see Moderna Pfizer opting try minimally plausible dosing intervals try get trials done fast possible. gotta keep em’ educated even get tested asymptomatic? updated reply say:

They almost asymptomatic (or symptoms comparable MILD allergies).

I think people know false positives. Lockdowns. effect lockdown effectively bring forward time mid point logistic curve. course measures afterwards, get brand new wave lockdown ends follow rules. Florida's given DeSantis. never understood logic here.

I mean, anti-mask people think schools going continue mandate masks pandemic over?

As said, fairly normal vaccine reactions, neither hospitalized, intubated, put ventilator, suffered serious long term damage side effects persisted months. cure certainly worse disease case. actually true, may antibodies rituximab (I assume talking about) anti-CD20 affect T-cells. Patients therapy poor outcomes. may get infected upper airway lack neutralizing antibodies, disease unlikely progress lungs T-cell immunity.

&amp;#x200B;

People have, continue choice.  must like abuse. Efficacy studies clearly showing vaccinated folks less likely get covid also that, even do, less severe cases. Sorry misread literally every study come topic past year. Exactly.

That paragraph makes doubt doctor told get vaccinated even doubt GBS.

People lie fucking time including medical condition. zero reason believe him.

In fact, reasons doubt since sounds like antivaxxers trying find excuse getting kicked shit. Way go FDA feel ya fam really surprising. time study anything else. Wow either you’ve got whole thing figured time traveler future…. What’s like dumb run world revers evolving back monkeys? science prove right wipe idiots world leading utopian future peace good towards one another?  underestimate transmisison rate? COVID. overestimate mortality rate? Believe not, also COVID. Underestimate, overestimate. would safer speed limit 10mph everywhere, well? waning antibodies. Also fact Delta grew prevalence Phase 13 (May/June) Phase 14 (June/July). 80% cases 100%. may (entirely?) attributable fact vaccines simply less effective Delta. bet wear really complex patterns shirt. Well vaccine that, virus even genetic material. Coronaviruses one biggest RNA viral genomes known man. I'd rather spike protein added genome whole frigging virus. link it. bother even replying without link SOOO easy get?

The ""efficacy"" referring ""studies"" well VACCINATED deal possible symptoms. whether simply get it. difference. asymptomatic still allows transmit virus.

So again, show data proves statement, continue logical fallacy ""go find yourself"", I'll assume clue talking about. might well even reply back.

Not virus asymptomatic VASTLY different. I'm interesting former only. HFM years ago, gave magic mouthwash. 14 days open, actively bleeding sores lips bottom throat- hell. took year regain weight lost. business approval different approval emergency use? legal precedent? imagine get vaxxed anyway. already roleplay victims, exclusion please them. people legitimate medical reasons actually call “the jab”? Pretty much giving away there, isn’t doctor wrong, vaccination recommended people prior infection. reinfected.

There’s surplus doses America need covid go without protection “save” shots others. sensible thing do. reason dirty people permitted mingle clean like that. Let’s refer willfully unvaccinated dirty people. They’re literal danger society.


The fucked thing is, guys probably even joking. Fucking listen yourselves. They’re like 150 cases day… ""My doctor said due side effects jab, shkuldnt get it."" Im really increasingly annoyed hear anti vax community talk dangers vaccine early know everything it. Like wrong, shut up. can't understand wrong, 20 min youtube video Dr oshcosh isnt factual?! kidding me!. Like debunk moms questionable sources useing back statements, actually gets mad says need learn respect others opinions. Lmao. world right fam ... something else. like everything taught school bullshit according now... arnt ones wanted get educated? Like fuck man. That's guess well. wiki says ""candidate Ph.D. molecular biology"" mean acutally received Ph.D? link saying this. biggest worry somehow bringing home daughter. husband vaccinated latest news made sound like vaccinated spread much non. offended easily.  Exactly. also lot eugenicist undertones.

I’m wary people like guy responded use half time it’s followed race realist argument race, IQ “low IQ” people (aka *browns*) invading “out breeding” (yuck, felt gross saying that) civilized, “high IQ” people (aka “whites”)  see Maryland stats? 3/4 covid cases vaccinated. It’s google search article says chooses get vaccine. one live isolation. fucking smart, wear mask, get vaccination.

Also, no, obviously kid runs says hi. can't control easy kids, understand. it’s muh freedom . sarcastic course..it’s issue Trump turned one political reasons. Makes zero sense oppose vaccine available free adults teenagers every race. sure compared some, much compared others. could: like absolutely that’s case, COVID would totally destroy him... definitely concerts tour. Time retirement!  people spreading pandemic ones wearing masks avoiding public gathering. crucifying unvaccinated, time figure urgently confused nature reality again, folks already necks next round disinformation, manipulation, deception. They've led lies since well began beginning look like simple test: believe government/political authorities, believe scientific ones.

The government authorities USA UK claim scientific distort science. cannot distinguish fiction truth destined play unwitting part someone's narrative. They're telling untrue stories true words, interesting phenomena watch appreciate firsthand reading history books wondering people could badly hoodwinked.  rate really useful for? seems reliable surface easily change run lots &amp; lots tests. easy force rate extremely low levels running lots tests short period time, assuming people quarantine/mask pop positive. Obviously testing mandated wide scale US, interesting thought process repeated regular workplace &amp; school testing become mandatory. missing something here? heard high positivity rate implies testing needed catch missing cases. That’s lot words whole lotta inference say “I can’t find single documented case asymptotic transmission someone 24” Yeah think mostly lost cause. Remember Republicans scrapped plan heard would primarily affect inner city liberals (and excited listen further)? Pepperridge Farm remembers. understand would afraid work one group vaccinated. would one risk could test every day. 11k folks sick rising hospitals season sound sustainable. Jeaua reason expect record break every day run hospital space admit new patients. FL even reactionary policy anymore. nothing. Even catch delta variant, much less likely experience severe symptoms die first shot two-shot regimen. Cool anti-car? sure point. 

Isn't /r/bikes you? fair it’s responsibility make sure guests safe virus anymore think. Either people coming vaccinated, people sign waiver release liability, like Georgia (I’m California) sign door saying risk sickness virus responsible well being. point you’re sick unvaccinated still going like shouldn’t put liability higher ups. It’s 2 years nearly haven’t gotten program prepared face consequences.  mean it’s kind true? Everyone know that’s gotten Covid recently vaccinated. We’ve cases report work since whole ordeal began defiantly coincides reopening ending social distancing Yep, that’s said exactly. amazing. elected lead state. shouldnt else do? Hire security guards check passports every entrance? 

Many people simply raised right take opportunity treat others like shit. Society shouldnt keep coming ways accommodate them. Lol I... What? entire population risk already able get vaccinated. 90% age 65 are, people dying. Hence death rates incredibly low. Children risk. didn’t start fire. aren’t flooding hospitals NY. Hospitals deal periodic surges every winter. isn’t March 2020 anymore. know older age groups likely higher percentage vaccinations? 75 older 85% vaccinated, 20 30-year-olds 25% vaccinated. find curious? winning thanks governor Dr. Jose Romero, Arkansas's health secretary, shared press conference nearly 19% active COVID cases state 18 half number 12.
""Between April July year there's 517% increase number cases people 18 nearly 690% increase cases children 12 under. There's increase nearly 270% hospitalization among individuals less 18 years age,"" said Dr. Romero. Curious…Is safe go restaurants (especially ones “popping”) eat indoors everyone party vaccinated? Commodore Perry arrived shores Japan steamships, Daimyos samurai... Explain what? drummer antivaxxer. 
I would curious hear explanation rest band felt unsafe, get vaccinated?  work children school starts month. I’m giving end September/early October start distance learning. Gagnant!  Citation needed NY’s hospitals full impeding people receiving care. isn’t March 2020. vaccines natural immunity. know vaccinated person caught COVID, probably lot friends Seems like that's Delta wave goes, also happened India countries? wouldn't. 

obviously.  vaccine's primary effect protect *you* virus? so, make sense all.    Didnt statement say decision made advice PCP? could mis-read , pretty sure thats said. guy tripling dumb decision what? hope bites ass Personal space? baseball game? Haha sure thing bud, doc expect question gov. fact matter hospitals get $30k grant every death attributed Covid. numbers skewed stats accurate. mention fact jab actually killing people making people carriers. indoctrinated system awhile now, hope eyes open soon. gov friend sure hell could care less health safety literally care get vaccine. want it, that's fine. I'm looking forward virus taking many unvaccinated possible. vaccinated catch covid - go visit mega church bass pro shop. Spread shit around. know - think people's brains could little bit electrical activity... think that, drummer claims legitimate health reason wanting vaccine bandmates feel unsafe around someone vaccinated. you’re describing happening NY hospitals deaths ridiculously low. actual emergency right mandate makes zero sense context. agree boyfriend also ethical issue. mayor actually asking CA residents go stay Vegas, one highway system CA heading NV can't support massive amounts traffic many folks coming spite covid restrictions. economy tourism events dont happen covid numbers get bad they've gotta put forward least illusion trying stem spread. Awwww baby can't comprehend long sighted complex thoughts. Awwwwww!!!!! Little baby cute! Numbers different July Pfizer - 92.6% vs symptomatic, 95.1% vs hospitalizations, 96.2% vs ICU admissions, 91% vs deaths; 87.7% vs symptomatic, 98% vs ICU, 100% vs deaths. understand efficacy vs deaths change 91% 100%, track new groups month recalculate? That's weird approach so. wish Reuters would provide source...

The age distribution would interesting know well according age groups 60+ 80%+ vaccination rates Sinovac vaccine, 50-59 group 57.5% fully 12.6% single shot (meaning around 70%+ Sinovac likely) younger groups far lower vaccination rates. Therefore, Pfizer &amp; AZ shots going heavily skewed towards younger population.

Information numbers people vaccinated vaccine would helpful well, sizes study cohorts information splits vaccinated/unvaccinated groups. 12 isn’t medical condition Time face curtain mandate.


It's like shower curtain, except dosent block 2.5gpm @ 80psi. fit little snugly around face curtain hanging front tub.  Unless you’re Missouri. Sigh.  get point, women deserve information whether someone else twist fit agenda. whole thing really boils this: women given full facts know advance? big problem medical industry general. taken months women reporting issues even get acknowledged. anti-vaxx talk it, fact, women answering thread experiences vaxxed, including myself. one thing I’ve told friends planning wedding want people vaccinated don’t want put onus defer current state/provincial/world health guidelines. Something RSVP like: guests safety important. make feel safe following guidelines (vaccinations, social distancing, etc) Puts pressure governmental agencies none couple. antivaxxers displeased go “too bad. thems rules” That’s pretty bad argument. Don’t act like isn’t easy go DMV go pharmacy. 

Have ever dealt DMV? comment crazy ignorant. kids sitting homes 24/7. don’t see point is. mask mandates lockdowns flu? That’s ridiculous. don’t work.  great way fuel vaccine hesitancy.  people legitimate reasons vaccinated. claiming one. smart phd molecular biology would still want people check medical doctor asking biologist. I'm shocked Lallapallalalala still thing! wearing mask makes miserable might incredibly privileged people fucking idiots won’t get vaccine, due large events know far less dangerous. I’m talking children. COVID less dangerous H1N1 children. Yet H1N1 circulating, masks school. It’s reasonable completely reasonable H1N1, dangerous children. French Guiana France Security guard doesn’t know looking [Biz Niss Iz  Thank fuck True, still wearing masks majority shops - pubs clubs fully open, people go meet mates couple pints, talk face face two hours unmasked!

* Etc. etc.

Generally, viruses like mutate less lethal lethal mutations kill host host spread further, giving survival edge mutations keep hosts alive longer.

That's big factor Covid deaths happen host mostly gone infectious stage. depend virus mutating less lethal happened 1918 flu.

I think realistically looking endemic disease need booster shots well becoming accustomed applying methods diminish exponential spread becomes unmanageable. remember ""The reason high numbers testing""? do. That's I' curious about... anyone info please share!

If vaccine proof variant emerges, would vaccine 'new"" vaccine go another year testing, would variation current vaccines? flu shot year need years studies, would new covid vaccine require one? Florida *really* wants variant. Yeah, you’re talking doubling ENTIRE defense budget try taking cost vaccinating entire world every year even go cheapest options. *are* people Florida masking vaxxing, thanks writing us off.

The major cities tend reasonable people, mayors Miami Orlando defied governor restored mask mandates. It’s rural, less educated areas problem. There’s much South Florida idiots Tallahassee refuse take things seriously.

Honestly, comment almost ignorant people state. virus get instead? Ignorant man, Florida Man. location served charter school?

Our teenager finished last two years high school K12 program Washington state.

There's lot pros cons associated this, might work people. unvaccinated firmly entrenched.

And yet still people getting vaccinated.

And actually seeing daily vaccination rates rising.  wonder pleasure getting Post Treatment Chronic Lyme Disease diagnosis Dr. A. John Hopkins Lyme Research Center. spent two hours explaining patients like like MS patients 1940s. Horrible, devastating news...the type conversation takes two hours world leading doctor field. Husband use humor cope end visit...Husband looked said ""I told never lupus!"" Dr. A. know references started explaining worse I'm laughing hard I'm crying. 

So, yeah, mentality got too!! I'm ""fixated"" discussing topic post? understanding Covid viruses mutate transmissible less dangerous variants. asshole though mutating transmissible deadly version. Wtf? I’m hoping still get probably won’t happen people world antibodies  I'm saying lock everyone again. Bad idea.

I'm saying herd immunity, COVID dangerous enough, large number people literally CANNOT protect themselves, vaccine protect people infect. 

Sure, ***danger*** pandemic basically average vaccinated person. can't vaccinate yet. hardship wear basic mask protect people? literally minor inconvenience. People starving far likely eat thanks, least try. “Probably” scientific evidence based. Way reach, always! so, tired. want life back. want college experience. want stop paying sit dorm alone. I’m fucking jealous everyone graduated 2020. feel like unique time life active, youthful years slipping away. I’ll never get time back haven’t able live fullest. 

I know sound fucking selfish. Maybe am. life restrictions coming back right isn’t life worth living long term. I’m going take life anything, I’m angry tired fed up. Ugh. Killing two birds one stone. either hit covid hard fast covid hits hard fast.

Meanwhile florida... Add FDA approval remove liability protections manufacturers get mine tomorrow. Newsweek article Lambda full shit 7 days average still though.
And Wednesdays big day previous weeks well

But death going yes, usual lag.   endgame is

Here's end game since everybody obsessed ""endgame"": **To make Covid become manageable threat without restrictions.**

The thing is, people said looks like lot people hearing choosing ignore it. know which, tbh.

So now, ""endgame"" mean? means get people vaccinated point hospitalizations overwhelm hospitals. Clearly, \~50% vaccination enough. needs much higher. know 99.9%+ vaccinated people get hospitalized. recall lot people sub said ""oh virus mutate something like seasonal gold"". Yes probably become eventually, get LOT faster people would take damn vaccines.

Another way get endgame anti-viral pill pharma companies developing now, take within 1 week showing symptoms positive test, virus overwhelms body point people need hospitalized. Ideally, we'd high vaccinations anti-viral pill would end sooner.  Spanish flu type beat Herd immunity.

Doesn't matter reported case numbers following herd immunity curve. following expected curve real case numbers. Delta infectious rapidly burning population. left unvaccinated younger cohorts likely asymptomatic mild case anyway. simply bothering get tested either assuming another respiratory infection hay fever know could covid want quarantine miss work. Delta dominant changes lot factors spread, typical viral load given space sporadic community transmission, etc.

Furthermore, studies’ authors don’t consider Delta sample size large representative enough. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

He’ll never admit it, disappear couple weeks last year peak Florida specific case? Yes. We’ve reached point data yet there’s subset people equivalent sticking fingers ears singing “not listening lalalalala.” people can’t reasoned with. could they’d gone gotten shots. would decimate state economically.

It’s overreaction would punish lot people trying right thing, included.

A realistic alternative require vaccines interstate travel. every school workplace coutry requires workers vaccinated. want get vaccinated fully healthy reason get it? get paid come infect people, period. Pray find home job.

*There obvious medical exceptions that's large minority crowd unvaccinated. Tell part world eliminated Covid masking?  Didn’t imply that. Anyone symptoms would get tested. Would lying second shot didn’t knock people 24 hours though. among college seniors final months school, yeah might want get second shot friday think big part want see long effectiveness lasts needing booster bring effectiveness level back up. Pfizer would obviously like everyone getting booster every month could since lot money gain they're trustworthy source terms booster timeline recommendation. government may give little go 6 months we're nearing point able get vaccines earliest (besides trials) would hitting 6 months. kills less flu, FAR.

People comparing final flu deaths counts current death count ongoing pandemic aggressively moronic.

And like said, even account schools shut kids congregating anywhere close used pre-Corona. news: water wet.  go urgent care centers get done. also go Publix, Walgreens, CVS. Lots choices honestly. Yeah. called highly recommend seeking vocal virologists immunologists explain vaccine escape highly unlikely. Priming immune systems way antibodies whether prevent testing positive. They’re defanging immune system comes contact it. many ways virus could mutate, vaccines address those. 

Honestly, step back present risks think longer term, it’s probably likely next killer virus emerge something Covid many viruses don’t vaccines less stable circulate widely humans animals. behaving like flu far less collective immunity flu. enough people get vaccinated/infected, calm down. We're trying find guy running patience morons. Yeah definitely. getting shots people countries yet problem. over-1% CFR we're seeing over-50s vaccination makes justifying booster shot pretty easily older people. Whereas younger people looks like whole thing's vaccination.

(Thanks.)  Same. know two people currently ""break through"" Covid. One near end quarantine mild symptoms. diagnosed past weekend also mild symptoms.

They healthcare workers imagine bigger viral load exposure average joe. already explained last year former President. ""If stop testing right now, we’d cases, any,” Trump said White House event.

Our Delta math *way* off. That's wrong, could stopped quick decisive lockdown.

The universe happens one restrictions instituted Chinese New Year travel. lol I'm propagandhi guy days wanna look im consuming agree, hospitals south completely different breed.

Look hospital staff vaccination rates Rouge General Hospital reported 53% staff vaccinated, said plans mandate vaccines time. mask mandate lifted hospitals, unvaccinated employees required continue wear masks.

That's *in fucking hospital* actual vaccination rate may higher unallocated vaccinations. VA, 26.5% state's population vaccinated allocated specific county.

Looks like states number &lt;5%  yes, are. Pfizer CEO ""In Bubble"" last week discussing this. working specific boosters many variants simultaneously, according internal studies/data, third booster original vaccine better Delta booster.

There is. Vaccination. 

If enough people given country region get vaccinated, get occasional small flare-ups vaccine evading variant comes, we'll go back horrible winter. let's enjoy can.

You're afraid vaccnie-proof variant help along? Every new infection another chance mutation. I'm syaing live hermitage take pointless risks, keep protecting needed. here. get sick last year really showed easy catch spread germs. Washing hands coughing elbow good enough, flu shot protects certain strains. Masking incredibly simple way making sure stay well.  still literally fact, stop butthurt 2 seconds, original post nothing contradict you, fragile poster. “Biden pressured approve early.” Nobody knows long covid immunity lasts yet; trust single source right now. Take look Arizona. tried ban mask mandates districts outright defying them. Luckily looks like mask ban done illegally governor that, still. Fight! Pensacola couple weeks ago. like covid even exist. county 38% vaccinated time (article says 44% now), masks almost nonexistent indoors - maybe 5% wearing them. Tons reasons dick jb one live Tampa Bay various times life. Mostly take care Dad elder years. finally left behind 2017. Unless tourist money spend rich retiree want go there. levels stupid bigotry nauseating. kiss ground practically gratitude live elsewhere now. governor he's typical Floridian. 🙄 comes time boosters think gonna switch? biggest lie we've fed ""stopping Covid"". virus.. us likely forever. one perspective, it’s threat child’s emotional development. Toddlers learn people around everyone’s faces covered freaks out, tantrums, generally anxious doesn’t know respond (developing kids look people around determine whether happy/sad/scared etc). That’s quite assumption make EVERYONE lives Alabama No, place relevant patrons, like sex club, would reasonable. kinda wish trump that’s would take take damn shot Isn’t AZ double-shot dose though? 

I understand two vaccines work way still completely different vaccines different levels effectiveness. don’t think it’s easy compare. 

Just like people assuming Mederna &amp; Pfizer level effectiveness b/c work way... it’s cut &amp; dry. (This first search result GOVERNMENT website). don’t case right? POST IT!! Go ahead!! We’re waiting!! Lmao course does! There’s list variants coming. Google happens create laws solve problems don’t exist. thats sadly true. That's good hear. I'm salty work (with public) us wear masks public don't. that's fun.

I hear governor issued school mask mandate really good news. hope help teachers year. Actually think ones sending memo. Seatbelts aren’t emergency rushed &amp; outside body kids 12? wish, FDA already announced want time study trial results see EUA kids 12 December/January. lot infectious diseases lead long/chronic illness. Post infectious IBS ruined life Totally. actually like fact they've normalized (though politicized). used want wear one shopping pre covid, self conscious.

All remaining concerns general public thinks gone now. respect trust judgement anymore. think cherry-picked somewhat. seven day average still shooting up, that's matters. #ThanksDeSatan Ignoring Covid play well Trump. Hopefully play well fuck either gets elected out. joked “Florida variant” .,.,, pizza Gaetz?

Either way……. I'm central FL. part everyone seems blissfully unaware situation. tell hospitals running space say 'the liberal media lies"".  
When go shopping I'd estimate maybe 20% public wear mask. Lots times unmasked glare us wear them. Maybe try deceptive? cousins 4 year old covid last October since complains constantly chest hurts plays hard. She’s seen specialists think heart problem probably covid. She’s FOUR. 

My cousin sending school next week, state masks considered big joke. 

I don’t want kids seeing parents negligent children’s health makes angry. That's works. mean 50% chance getting infected vaccinated, means chances getting infected 50% lower vaccinated. Cutting infection rate 50% necessary keep hospital capacity reasonable levels. wear seatbelts? bet didn’t get accident whole trip. Guess stop using seatbelts disable airbags, since they’re useless. Overwhelming no, thinking ton people won’t get vaccine hospital bills would paid hilarious. bet also think US healthcare system unethical, pro student debt forgiveness, probably shouldn’t fan either. Yes flu seasons... covid seasons though, left key step comeback plan. Two every three Calhoun County residents yet roll sleeves single dose COVID-19 vaccine, according statistics Alabama Department Public Health. 28 percent completed full series safe &amp; preventive measures abstinence condoms. emergency rushed V That's narrative. Well done. need way securely demonstrate vaccination make HURT vaccinated. Sorry, grocery store - curbside delivery only. bars. restaurants. church. sporting events (from NFL peewee baseball). Incentives working. demonstratively counter-productive. 

If Mr. Biden leader told make happen. executive orders. leadership. Like Franklin Roosevelt fireside chats. Pull country together LEAD. Set politics aside LEAD. really want lie. I’ve 2 Moderna I’m thinking j&amp;j, I’m probably comfortable enough wait guidelines implemented booster shots lot daily cases/deaths. already turning away people? Anyone who's paying attention already knew this. places checking insurance information...

Yeah, data (of course), enough anecdotal info me, least. asking questions! What's question? answered? saying things substance them. I've literally linked state health departments say, clearly written out, need insurance, people comment thread verified confirmed need ID.
Do think pharmacies place vaccine administered? Like said, Oregon Washington STATE hosted mass vaccination events. 
How going accurately track vaccines administered someone without ID insurance?

If know anything US, would understand. ""You *believe* latest business requiring proof vaccination employees!"" interesting FLA recent numbers John Hopkins You’re still good doctor, system letting down. Again. I’m sorry. That's fine, hope people become comfortable wearing masks certain situations, that's different thinking everyone needs wear mask time leave house. [""That's Private - war's over. won. Turns big hero.

Too many worried poop masks. Questioning whether poop, covid, what’s actually making kids sick. 

People wearing masks. all, isn’t natural immunity better? course ignore deaths, long-covid, HCW PTSD. Parents, won’t mask, aren’t going mask kids unless forced so. 

Isn’t really spread foreigners/illegal aliens? (For need spelled out—NO. It’s not. It’s spread people refuse mask refuse get vaccinated.)

Hearing House—someone believes it’s communist bio-weapon. 

This state fucked numbers don’t really matter. also unprotected sex person riddled STDs get STD. mean good risk take safe effective preventative measure. kid wants vaccinated parents won’t consent. Can’t test positive don’t test! ::head tap meme::  Historically, quickly mutating viruses tend find less deadly mutation takes dominant strain spreading. likely COVID may forever, likely mutate less dangerous strain.

That's I'm hoping for, anyway. that's like last resort. get point already shit bed. Chicago (we're anti vax morons here). Cases up, even gov calling ""pandemic unvaccinated"" basically letting happen... totally agree with. Unvaccinated get covid, reap consequences. Hospitals full, vaccine makes virus less deadly flu, vaccinated, please stop worrying go back business usual.  Depends location. local hospital system super strict time.

Thanks! Gonna lot unemployment soon /r/Unexpectedtheymightbegiants Yes, I'm sure they're quaking boots prospect mild head cold, days bed worst. Especially given they've made sacrifice past year. It’s kind true though. see missed study saying less 50% unvaccinated convalescent individuals detectable neutralization Delta 12 months. seem significant, though understanding declining disappearing neutralization losing immunity.

The stuff relevant question, though see would asking evidence vaccination could better protect convalescent.  Florida, 3rd world country wonder guard schools caught new surge.

Possibly true, much hospitalizations lagging cases days?

For instance, mid-March mid-April smaller ""spike"" Florida (~50% increase cases), seem like hospitalization rates lagged all; peak hospitalizations days peak cases.

Winding back end last year, nearly 100% spike cases Florida peaked 1/9/2021 looks like hospitalizations peaked right around time. Looks like dude needs worry weight, masks. Sheesh That’s nice say.

But DeSantis? Eh.. watching part debate last election gillum (sp?)... .. whew.... acting stupid, man... I'm impressed. Yes, faith. Remember last year saying think we'd get lasting immunity vaccine? SA variant supposed able evade vaccine? Fauci talk worst case scenarios- wants motivate people get vaccinated/ leaders take stronger lead vaccination.  65 immunocompromised? not, country this.

I’ve always struggled lax sometimes, but… one I’m best hold ground on. like said, hopefully, it’s motivator people actually get vaccinated, especially they’ll miss important things otherwise. think (and when) there's ever variant concern comes FL, name DeSantis Variant. Always Sunny. symptoms ""long covid"" seem mirror depression anxiety episodes. would depressed caught covid. Yes. read article. read article? vaccine, people would dead.

I'm sure simultaneous infection immunity prior infection. infection second strain happen immunity develops? read masks suddenly work delta variant? hope make sound like asshole mean all. think unfair parents / parents immunocompromised children expect vaccinated people put lives pause unforeseen future. I'm truly sorry people situation, like Dr. Fauci co always say, take rational risk assessment.  felt like mini covid went away couple days compared weeks / months symptoms lasted sick (March 2020)

I smell better vaccinated. TIL water wet. theories I’ve read won’t go direction seem conclude long asymptomatic contagious period puts almost selective pressure severity disease. 

Basically kills people slowly reason ditch element evolution perspective. 

It waiting game point. study plenty facts, exactly stated. anything reach straw deny them. understand it, things now.

Why people still trust government MSM complete mystery me. consistently lied us years now. necessary really research find anything approaching truth.

Even Governor Whitmer kidnapping turns FBI op. WTF! 12 18 suspects FBI informants. Notice silent media this. FBI op freak everybody Trump. 

Caitlin Johnstone, usual, says Even depressing see state breakdown surrounding towns okay vaccination town bunch anti-vaxxers. Always been. hopefully increases vaccination numbers Children still spread adults. US political game states lower 50% vaccination rates Serious question, honestly think posts would end ton downvotes? seeking attention? admitting something even recommended even allowed.

The Biden admin said time time need boosters would vulnerable crowd. Clearly don’t remember Tellula Lake incident 1991. there. still hear screams of, “Read lips; new taxes.” weird disconnect seems exist. NC announced vaccinated stop wearing mask, please keep wearing it. Everyone, **EVERYONE** knew unvaccinated people going take advantage that.

Because anti-maskers also anti-vaxxers. Oh yeah say close beginning thread important, **4.4% developed symptoms**, since children get symptomatic COVID, very, low chance even develop this.

?

What get lying minimizing crisis bro? Stop that! Highly vaccinated populations virus still spreading favor development spread vaccine resistant variants. needs weighed too. J&amp;J well, asking site physician, I'm assuming guidance would get booster CPT would second dose. I'm neither medical practictioner biller, though I'm wondering remain true Delta variant hates much keeps commenting thread. Death bad outcome. tired repeating this.

It takes time. now, I'm point say kids safely vaccinated, everyone wants not. can't go forever. Even crazier goto covidactnow.com put Louisiana versus high vaccination state like VT, MD, CT, MA. Puts context. site allows compare States, Counties, Metro areas graph. go trends change location.

* [extremely high vaccination rate greater feeling safety population] 
* [greater feeling safety population higher density people hanging pubs, etc] 
* [greater feeling safety population less wearing masks, social distancing, etc] 
* [extremely high vaccination rate higher number asymptomatic mildly symptomatic (among vaccinated)] AND
* [ higher number asymptomatic mildly symptomatic higher viral R0 population (regardless strain)] 
* [higher higher density people hanging pubs, etc higher viral R0 population] 
* [less wearing masks, social distancing, etc higher viral R0 population] THEREFORE: 
* [extremely high vaccination rate higher viral R0 population]

This logic consider apparently open question whether vaccinated lower viral load unvaccinated.

What dillweed. Know what's even frustrating? attend work university Tampa flat said weeks ago need vaccines (the medical school/ public health college covid research analysis)...and university turning around saying ""everything back normal fall"" vaccine mask mandates staff, faculty, students. DeSantis. fucked up. Well obviously wearing masks make matters worse /s Well thankfully fine numbers I’ve found Wall Street Journal looks like 4 1000 kids test positive need hospitalization. considering kids get don’t get tested asymptomatic severe cases children pretty rare. cousin's toddler ICU 3 weeks due covid... that's true there's sure lot two 😅😭 think people (read: idiots) say rushed use means discount thousands upon thousands actual scientists doctors real research (not confirmation bias ""research"" social media).

I personally know several people worked clinical trials vaccines. reasons vaccines came quickly following:

1. Companies government threw crapload money problem.
2. Employees worked 80+ hour weeks, 7 days week, months.
3. FDA prioritized reviewing data minimize delays approval process.

That's it. That's reasons vaccine came fast. 

People think vaccine would somehow safer took twice long come idiots. amount work done vaccine drug many people sacrificed months lives work record time. 

Do get people hesitant taking drug EUA? Sure. I've also never met anyone actually intelligent enough articulate press them. So, yeah, it'll interesting see ""rushed"" excuse continue full approval. want? Covid over.

What stop it? 

Not damn thing! go droplet school give lecture. This. business press looked cost Florida economy due Governor’s response.

Got kid right age Disney theme parks. over, booking California parks. guess we'll see. imagine tolerance level high this. shot political shitshow, COVID disrupt combat effectiveness like transmissible virus. really room dissenting opinion this, especially medical.

If lucky, approval comes sometime near labor day. Idk from, US context happen? feel like even decently effective vaccines delta, we'd need nationally coordinated period time reintroduced restrictions get numbers super low, happen. Like sure parts country reintroduce restrictions get cases lower it'll kicking around somewhere seems like cases go everythings 'back normal' there's really end sight. Ugh. vaccinated likely die car accident way covid. Paywall - someone summarize? US already donated 110 million doses countries. We’re donating 500 million more. We’ve done part. there’s evidence waning immunity, however, can’t turn back citizens. Ask doctor reddit Health first. get vaxed(which soon ffs) move life. Hard grave disabled body. deal me. 13 year old vaccinated 10 year old awaiting approval fall. completely understand children low risk spending 7 hours room 24 unvaccinated individuals seems like bad idea. Droplets least 5x larger aerosols that’s big deal point I’m sure us vaxxers I’ve talked anti vaxxers none underlying health concerns, ( unless consider confidently ignorant subject COVID, vaccines, common sense )
I talked friend yesterday anti vax health nut ass hat. They’re mind made won’t get it.
Insert dip shit reasons:
I’ve never vaccinated

I don’t put non organic substances body

(You medical background &amp; failed biology) 
The governments bad test people don’t trust 
(Okay Tuskegee experiments happened you’re even African American &amp; fuck situation?) 
Tell covids mutating it’s real
( dumb shits keep spreading that’s mutations work spreading different hosts) 

Literally didn’t even bother reading articles sent perfectly happy living life correct, he’s fine willfully ignorant. It’s sad someone feels control life take (this) hill die 

Or change tune someone close gets do, I’m honest longer sympathy anti vaxxer, I’m rooting anyone get COVID won’t show shed sympathy anyone able get vaccine chose get it, ended COVID result gave family member you’re stupid choices straight goes friends family anyone else holds stupid opinion. 
These people don’t care logic want control life
-_- normally isn’t bad thing you’re selfish choices effects others fuck right off. 

Sorry rant. address point point:

I concede odds getting severe case vaccinated person low. That's point getting vaccine. point trying make wanted prevent creation additional variants, variants affect us well. It'd kind nasty think safe catch severe case. odds low mean happen. mean, think skin cancer. Yeah, people go play sun, people put sunscreen, right, reduce risk? 

In order reduce risk, vaccinated people need make sure follow guidelines set out. means protecting unvaccinated people extent. 

As ""most people immunocompromised children""... 2007 survey United States estimated “prevalence rates diagnosed \[primary immunodeficiency\] 1 2,000 children, 1 1,200 persons, **1 600 households**.” surveys suggest prevalence rates might even higher.   don’t seem complete statistics prevalence secondary immunodeficiencies, would include:  10,000 children teens living HIV 
Just 15,700 children teens diagnosed cancer year, many treated chemotherapy 
Almost 200,000 children teens diabetes mellitus 
About 1,000 children born United States year sickle cell disease 
Also, children many conditions increased risk infections, including lupus, cystic fibrosis, syndrome, etc.

So. No, ***most*** people immunocompromised children, prevalent think. listened public changed course? make sound like bad thing. Original coronavirus said extremely contagious, UK variant, contagious, Delta even contagious. metric express terms percentages? Hmmm yes, floor made floor I'm upset live community low vaccination rates I'll get watch friends/neighbors/extended family/coworkers go crap went Jan-Feb again. dealing impact job personal life. I'll get worry another covid spike might economy, especially since industry really hammered pandemic.

So may fairly 'safe', means insulated happens people live around, even extension entire world.

This pandemic much personal health. i'm going toss math let masses decide i'm right wrong.

if delta R0= chicken pox R0 that's 5-10 people sick per person infected.

if 80% vaccinated changes R0 1-2 average. toss masking, social distance, hopefully common sense drops 0 make progress ending thing, right?

edit: yes, 1, sorry find nose thing uncomfortable also want cautious.

For it’s like charm scare bad virus.

(Referring people stores, people convenience outside pulling properly stores crowds) Again, shit. (Insert smiling nodding Jack Nicholson GIF)

Delta variant like: ""yesssssss, yesssss"" fast. 1. fair premise, yes. 
2. though.
3. Definite exposure small (in case miniscule) risk vs. uncertain exposure large risk basis medical interventions.
4. doctor giving advice runs contrary medical science, absolutely listen them. would thought obvious. happened Portugal, example. Similar new cases curve, similar deaths, similar lockdown severety dates. half vaccines. Nobody expects ~~Spanish Inquisition~~ Florida Covid 'Response', main weapon politics!...and greed! main weapons politics greed!... incompetence... Okay, go challenge fist fight something dude. It’s anecdote. Calm Chad Dickens. People may realize even numbers low community (I’m Texas) we’ve seen people die every month ICU Covid. perspective small ICU burbs Houston. July alone 4 deaths maybe I’ve forgotten. reason stand one 36 years old, another 30 another 21. 4th stand 60s vaccinated Johnson. appeared nothing going eyes public. saw small perspective, imagine what’s going places like Florida unbeknownst general population. not, seeing breakthrough cases U.K. example. till move goalposts yeah expert, head admit getting fed roller coaster ride type experience pandemic become (or maybe always was).

With said, seems like mask mandates ever, keeping honest people honest, guess something, long run seem terribly effective.

I listening Dr. Scott Gottlieb one TV-experts said mask mandates point going much effect people wearing large vaccinated wearing beforehand.

I get nose thing annoying, (possibly lack knowledge really shows here) but, maybe maybe reduction exhalation better nothing, mouth nose covered would best, covered mouth better nothing?

Edited correct sentence structure new delta variant filling hospitals unvaccinated people new variant causing break infections among vaccinated turn, able infect unvaccinated. 

Refer: delta's R0 5 8, ""herd"" immunity increased 70% target +90%. many unprotected people walking around like cord wood bonfire.

Once people active immunity prevailing flavor SARS2, life return normal. ain't yet, matter much wish true.  source? lot pushback soldiers want it. bracing potential personnel loss result.  don’t really see point masks anymore. 

The way FDA give full approval vaccines approval minors, don’t seem hurry so. Meanwhile, CDC making new recommendations based single study.

Given dysfunction multilayer alphabet soup bureaucracy, could see people could believe conspiracy theories. Sadly, really dysfunctional. 2% chance 8+ weeks
  
Don't worry, study done Delta variant Alpha variant, even worse   see daily articles states across US showing massive increases child hospitalizations Covid-19? Delta variant different beast. pray kids, any. like good nights sleep 100mgs would kill me. 3mgs trick. Yep, here. We're NE too. We've also major turnover school, rare super irregular. can't imagine teachers handling constant stress. look burned defeated see them.   That's it!! That's long study ran for. 20 weeks ""at least long - data longer periods."" said vax. history GBS cited risk factor CDC. get vax wants to.

even couldn't, reasonable accommodation require anyone put risk. unvaxed, persona non grata community spread happening. E flat? going pretend studies done mask effectiveness since start COVID outbreak exist roll back clock two decades last conclusion supported? Yeah, comments Floridians deserve insane me. 49.2% voted guy governor, people realize right? Half state voted someone different, you’re going say let die sympathy?!? wrong people. mention TB, doctors article voted Gillum… Gillum county 9 points! don’t live Florida, certainly feel bad going thru sympathy. Good luck all, stay safe. Interestingly, got call wife. telling informed exposed covid vaccinated client contacted say tested positive shortly meeting Monday. vaccinated. she, she'll tested precaution.

The latest stats people vaccines infections great. argument vaccination. seem prevent infection half cases help prevent serious symptoms remaining cases, ""everyone knows someone vaccinated tested positive"" may far truth get spread control.

However, vaccines still provide enough protection curb spread. still seems pretty clear latest surge brought us courtesy unvaccinated. sure, plane speak surrounded older men big honkers sticking mask. Oh lol. genuinely know. listened early 90s stuff Fisher price radio kid. That’s funny. It’s also established left testicle tolerant right testicle. Oops, no.

But since, responded wrong one, I'll respond here. identity politics purely liberal problem.

IMO, pathologies right exist left well, society threatening (ignoring global warming) resistant facts (vaccines tracking device). So, still common sense choice. part operation WARP SPEED made think rushed?  methods control spread disease mysterious. understand well. There's need ""find"" way, way well-documented.

Please correct relevant expertise here. Yup, they're likely false negative, COVID may manifest respiratory symptoms, gastro-intestinal symptoms present.

There cases fecal test produced positive, pharyngeal continually negative. knew sis Providing boosters providing initial doses aren’t mutually exclusive. I'm sure fact FDA responsible BLA approval, CDC. way see Covid handled here, I'd suggest US wait little.  possibility vaccine resistant virus immerges still real. could global killer people acting way casual it. One political party deliberately scientifically obtuse makes unavoidably political. lead singer PhD Biology makes sense  ever hear guy prophecies doom, never proposing plan “well, maybe ask SUPER nicely, anti-vaxers change minds.” Brit - process invoke remove obviously insane governor presents danger people represents? Testing going reduce number people covid.  many people get ""long flu"" year? I've never heard that. even publish articles like this? new information obvious. there's possible end pandemic, see should'nt enjoy what's left summer keep seeing friends vaccinated protected, much danger.

Because vaccine evading variant comes, we'll go back horrible winter. let's enjoy can. Lookout! comes Florida Man!! Sadly, live Los Angeles. Yesterday saw near 100% masking OUTSIDE. insane, mandate that, science says virus spread well outside. everyone productive home. live 2 hours office go couple times month. get done couple days days working home combined. workforce 50% vaccinated specific employee not. symptoms stomach issues put work Monday.

Right now, plan get PCR tested see. boyfriend real sick needs go urgent care according her. asked isolate clears unfortunately anywhere else go. rest week . countries/places really carving exemptions people medical reasons get vaccinated?

This excellent point. stage situation, people part set ways least, method communication, conscious otherwise, set stone.

See someone wearing mask poorly? know need avoid bad behavior likely pending. They're suddenly going say ""hey, right!"". treat like terrain features move on. country healthcare current state? free? lol.. one unstoppable, even MRNA technology 

US least using mRNA technology well.  probability ""long covid"" reasonably common, long covid huge catch term, covering mild severe eventualities. study children 2% long covid symptoms 8 weeks, falling 4% 4 weeks, age group unvaccinated UK. problem ""long covid"" phrase covers everything cough months, bed bound due sheer exhaustion. reality small minority long covid sufferers actually suffer severe long term symptoms. people suffer mild symptoms, suffer worse symptoms recover months. unusual sick viral infection. happening centuries. probability fully vacinated person severely harmed long term COVID miniscule. Ultimately happen people, every year non smokers die lung cancer people die car accidents. Say back. there's episode House made scared sex while.

Not scared enough stop me, still, back mind. disease killing children numbers whole new ballgame.

I hope right, unfortunately know politicians US, Brazil, UK would thing masses children get Covid-19 Again, managing read lines get conspiracy spread covid misinformation, even going far corrupt doctors lying doctor's advice. case vaccine dangerous getting covid (again) that's exactly stated part overall explanation, major point wrote. fact HARD see skepticism vaccinations statement, sure manage it.

GBS ranges almost nothing life-destroying 24 hr care needed disease outright fatal. wide variety causes, symptoms triggers leading flare ups. different every patient.

If personal doctor thinks particular case (and chronic medications may on) risks vaccine outweigh potential benefits, that's that. CDC guidance fully agrees - need blanket ban covid vaccines GBS CONSULT DOCTOR. could ignore doctor, get 2nd opinion actually did, make informed decision patient get vaccinated right now.

All guidance regarding J&amp;J GBS etc **developing** GBS covid shot. already serious case GBS, another vaccination absolutely result adverse outcomes.

GBS|CIDP Foundation risk former GBS patient developing GBS vaccination known complication rate vaccinations recovered GBS patients properly studied. Members GBS|CIDP Foundation Global Medical Advisory Board deliberated safety immunizations former GBS patients offer following guidelines: rare person developed GBS within four six weeks receiving immunization, **it seems prudent avoid vaccination **Ultimately, former GBS patients discuss pros cons receiving vaccination primary physician evaluate benefits risks**. decision former GBS patient receiving declining flu shot **or immunization** well thought out. Discussing matter primary physician likely best means assess vaccine’s value.

Which exactly did. see corrupt doctors vaccine misinformation. Maybe report twitter, get banned social media? Man's clearly menace society. Yes. I'm sure getting at. 

I see anywhere article implies supply limited. They're saying ""Hey vaccinations up, much really need be."" People talk US military power Taliban win war Afghanistan lmao Unless study shows long COVID prevalent Delta infections, please make claims. India rising too. UK miracle may over. You’re first heard happening to. Rite Aid screwed friends. Good luck you. Nice know freedom mere convenience. anybody information anecdotes regarding delta variant amongst babies? Overwhelmed anxiety 9 month old can’t really pull daycare stop going work.. I'm glad getting downvoted this, truth. _always_ way out. might seem impossible. might hardest thing ever do. form actual plan take step step, designing step based actual circumstances wish were, little can't accomplish. cause greed feel.  nastier side effects like headaches, flu-like symptoms etc. generally due immune response viral proteins. would kind response proteins expressed via vaccine, makes sense think equally severe real virus, extra problem real virus also multiplying time. Simultaneously believing vaccine kick ass covid nothing pure magical thinking, probably meant rationalize wanting go get vaccinated. Florida's numbers always lower weekends (7/31 8/1) lasted harshest lockdown world. economy suffered most. government ran money pay police etc.

Please draw conclusions little info matter Based statement he's using GBS excuse. fully supported vaccination rant many vaccine dangerous disease, he'd say ""please health conditions, get vaccines. wish could.""

To reads like someone who's clinging flimsy premise sneak ideas backdoor. could die! also even couldn't... agree, governments earth politicians, they'd balk. might literal mouth breathers well metaphorical ones. Good. Virginia red? decent vaccination rate much worse time last year. Schools start back next week counties desantis signed executive order saying could mask mandates students. 

in area 34 total available icu beds- that’s bit stretch hospitals 45 minutes away. one near 150% occupancy. 

It’s really bad. I’ve stopped taking kid store (they’d wear mask) longer going indoor play parks. 

Also two three massive concerts state 30,000 plus attendance past weekend. 

So yeah. It’s going great. diagnosing everything COVID obviously /s feel much! Someone team unvaxxed. There's also lot talk getting counterfeit vax cards mask required . WTF? surprise literally one except CDC.  doubt knows it, trying say research still close, exactly mRNA. Yeah. conjecture VOC evolved within single immunocompromised host, gaining 2 dozen (for delta) mutations somehow spreading someone else. see VOCs they're lot contagious circulating lineages grow number. 

So theory new host could start process again, priorities vaccination pool much smaller now. 

But there's real reason evolution stopped. Maybe host even cured yet evolution ongoing; found original host VOCs. conversely, delta could easily apex evolutionary chain additional descendants worse. know.  Love you’re getting downvoted perfectly rational risk assessment actively Covid-19 public space without knowing it. spread Covid without knowing it.

Is viral load high enough actually spread vaccinated asymptomatic? possible could take long time. hope doesn’t get foothold. must covid fuck us much over. care die this, preventable need prevent it.

That's crazy. Since kids die car accidents time, kids banned entering vehicles then? preventable, all.

Kids can’t get vaccinated, even you’ll parents refuse let kids get vaccinated, immunocompromised unvaccinated 40y. male still wears mask, taking care distancing sanitization. Thanks. cases vaccinations picked it’s really something worry about. ""Hug Unvaccinated Day"". think need many hugs possible. And, feeling generous, kiss cheek. sure based in, I've never scanned register location. show green-tiered health code good go. Heck, I've even tried using screenshots previous health code entire process takes bit time (&lt;1min), nobody stopped subway even hospital (the code real time stamp it; still). course, even possibly risk; domestic cases logged months, stopped recent days. short memory spans locked country 300 cases. government got extremely high criticism it.

""Damned do, damned don't"" You’re getting optimal sample size. You’re sampling high risk group. methodology wrong. doesn’t reflect general population makes flawed representation. Yup. Since March. I’m curious hear explanation. Someone actually hit “logic” shortly got vaccinated. First tried say cut line. explained group 1b due work moved saying contributing vaccine inequality. I’m honestly fascinated hear folks even thinks that’s possible. person drive everyone car? refuse turn tap everyone clean water? altruistic sounding excuse could come justify selfish towards community?  know… morons. 

RIP Gene Wilder. hope much you’re right think going take longer that. history indicator we’re months short halfway point thing. know didn’t vaccines historically prior pandemics, half measure uptake among citizens gives virus plenty time circulate near vaccinated population. wouldn’t continue evolve deal population? read case Lambda Houston - maybe 2 weeks ago.

Example would Virginia, listed .7% cases breakthrough cases. last month (so, we've surge), 3%. Still indicates surge driven vaccinated, lot accurate doing. think mostly coming journalists reading data sources thinking sampling biases, though.

Give us maskass! yep, canadian think dose interval 6 weeks. mixed vax boot... 1 pfizer 1 moderna hehe. 

Good luck sorting Canada... many combinations timeframes people got vaccinated data nightmare sort out. largely done state governments broad guidelines set federal government.

This case India well, managed single app digital certificate mechanism. states use platform provided central government citizen's vaccine status gets updated receive vaccine anywhere.

The problem US think disagreement even simple fundamental aspects state federal governments, even individual views whether information collected / used. done least capture vaccination status single platform let states decide later whether actually use verification individuals later point. instead, information exist all.

I wonder going impact international travel, US travelers standardized way proving vaccination status, though US probably get free pass regarding countries anyways. funny liberal reddit became that. you? them. Getting vaccine communal act. want part community even discussion. 

But...I'm also crass opinion f..k them. Eventually burn worry poor choices longer. Nope. Jansen vaccine one elevated risk GBS even ridiculously tiny. mRNA vaccines increased risk.

Ontario 14 million people - would 5 6 largest state, 4th largest city North America (Toronto). reports long date range December 2020 July 2021. 18 million doses given, huge sample size

I hate popped dominates news cycles negative review vaccines instead analysis different here. need questions virologists. 


Is delta variant robust vaccine right now? I’m sure we’ll find another vaccine much sooner. tighten mask mandates again? I’d ok that. less politicized method implementing vaccine would now? BET ASS HAVE.  Tourists AC summer heat. vaccination rate among 65 (large portion local population) really high, it’s much lower younger people, younger people likely partying tourists stuck working around them. would unexpected herd immunity lead sudden drop UK seeing. Herd immunity isn’t either UK reached (if has) cause gradual plateau gradual fall. quick plateau sudden drop we’ve experienced. parents advised reaction baby (in 80's).

Seems like people hit limit, unfortunately. think kids start getting sick hospitals shut down, might change. Literally cant go tits Yeah I'm really confused comment. anything, seems maybe Euros helped weirdly - people congregating indoors pubs houses watch games together experience younger lower-risk demographics less likely fully vaccinated. data shows wave largely big concurrent spike cases age groups, may led Delta quickly running non-vaccinated, non-previously infected hosts running steam much quicker Euros happened.

Also, schools open, current case decline began closed summer holidays.

In regards hospitalizations made vaxed group significantely less likely end there.

I see evidence significant reduction mortality got hospital, makes sense, vaccine probably little nothing still ended hospitalized.

But can't die COVID without getting getting serious enough end hospitalized, reduction ended something like 10 fold, basically 10 times likely die COVID vaccinated someone vaccinated.

instead keep blaming Republicans ignoring actual people refusing vaccine gotta get tc tugger calico cut pants view unexpected decline due combination of:

- natural peaking wave,

- approaching herd immunity due vaccination recoveries,

- better weather.

Gandalf made poor choice GBS successor. Good Japan hardly containment contact tracing aggressive testing. seem learnt nothing year pandemic contain it. 

Stringent mask compliance helps cases Japan lower Canada, Japan 4 times population Canada. 

Edit: clarity. Wtf talking about? literally everyone know tested haven’t felt well course last year half keep vaccinated gathering? saw family week like 2 weeks ago. Everyone vaccinated. thought guidance changed 8 weeks 12 early July. people could get doses earlier. liberals LA call racist 3... 2... *can* explained utter madness! Unfortunately going terrible side effect pandemic. medical staff make huge chunk long Covid folks, they’re also burning high rates due PTSD. morbid, pediatric cases increase, that’ll get much worse. someone ate deer got virus. 25% cases LA vaccinated people, that's dependent whether even bother get tested

it's probably vaccinated COVID unvaccinated point guess. even back days, never personally knew someone used fake ID *after turning 21*.

Before legal drinking age, sure. 21, makes sense. I've never met someone 21 actually *had valid ID* still chose use fake ID ""cool"".

I think got used facing harsh, cold, painful reality life. I've faced many tragedies life learned fake optimism hope nothing. guess lesson useful time around. I'm angry surprised recent news. like said: accept deal. endless state denial hurting us. lets hope stays way flu season 2 months time, thats question mark me.

Agree.

This also important open did. waited months would also flu season contend people would spending far time indoors due inevitable inclement UK weather. would bad combination.

Opening seeing minor uptick overwhelm hospitals IMO far preferable waiting see would happened we'd reopened society period transmissible respiratory diseases known contagious. Moreso second, people GBS. Also people get GBS fully recover. symptoms lasted longer 8 weeks, hence chronic nature diagnosis, closer first scenario described
I can't perform many daily tasks days without ongoing treatment. Diagnosed May unsure lies ahead. english thing, vaccines called jab, get flu jab every year, children jabs, I've 2 covid jabs. Scotland call jags. he's english, seem reason taken over.  sharp, duh huger issue quarantining entire fucking boats weeks, keeping people due return home sea due random covid shenanigans.  UK stopped public sporting events.  


And throughout pandemic, know effects superspreader events take 1/2 weeks really make effect cases. So, expect cases would skyrocket 1/2 weeks events decline. Hell, experts ex+ecting 100k cases day. Agree 100%.

I'm hoping booster significantly assist here. interim vaccinated people need take fucking chill pill put mask back avoid crowded spaces.  We've recently gone 12 weeks 6 Sydney cases continue climb. Props Dexter Noodles engaging specifics one - there's classic misinformation tactic used gains traction debated. 

1. Take solid truth: people can't vaccinated medical reasons.
2. Add undisprovable personal circumstance: Pete medical condition
3. use reasonable premise slip lie: vaccine harmful virus

If he'd said third part outright lie would blatant, caught plausible truth focus always shifted back called out. 

But obviously can't pull shit microbiologist friend. body can't cope vaccine, definitely can't cope virus. condition refers specifically triggered catching viruses. excruciatingly obvious someone studied virology there's point engaging allowing less informed people see debatable point. 

It's shame still giving benefit doubt here, like said, deliberate misinformation designed hard spot. Tested positive Covid yesterday. fully vaccinated since April (Pfizer). Thought cold realized smell anything. 

Feeling fine part(although felt pretty crappy weekend) never expected breakthrough case. Thankful vaccine symptoms mild. misinformation, however always manipulate data suit whichever narrative follow. fact is, far UK concerned, over. least. expect remain case though? air far I'm concerned. like that, stopped supporting offspring.

Shame. lot articles right subject; unfortunately, know research needed. 

There actually several pregnancies vaccine trials; information available simple search. 

It well known virus - catch - change menstrual cycles: would also like know. personally- cycles messed up. Granted, went infertility treatments baby january 2020. Cycles back track second dose whack. know several females thing happened.

I’m getting fact “think children” routine makes absolutely zero sense look numbers. 1,800 died ‘09, tragedy.

Sometimes everyone interact roughly social class us, hard see would affected. However people pushing policies done research know exactly would harmed them.

I open voter ID requirements proven voter fraud common issue threatens integrity elections, however seem case. don’t get (I American live eu) people support sociopath? Why? Well, that's worth looking into. course, that's tragically horrible. That's discussing though.  bringing point land mass cases dropping. Don’t treat smokers, people use drugs, overweight people, etc. right? Doctors take oath help treat people. Denying healthcare wrong, even it’s something could prevented.

Literally 2 weeks later country shut down. isn’t anything new. people used “bad things happening” think ignoring discounting valid strategy. Makes sense, part reason kids get sick often badly less receptors COVID binds too. Buuuuuuut increase viral load thousand percent, changes game. Enter Delta variant.

I wait 12 gets approval. One nervous dad. hilarious considering Trump many others got vaccinated perfectly fine still… That's happened Europe, go uninfected people September, US would look like zombie movie. 

It's like huge percentage unvaccinated fuck around find out, obviously susceptible anyone else (unvax) inherently defiant prevention measures cognitive dissonance pushing towards ""this real"".

Basically reduce transmission. fully support vaccinations science based decisions vaccine ""fix"" It’s one it’s longest friendship.

IMHO best leader moment. They're trying save ratings however Trump office Good question dedicated portion Department Health Website Google Apple already support Bluetooth contact tracing storing digital vaccine passports digital wallet.

Places need actually support use it. don’t think anyone saying it’s save fix, absolutely reduce chances getting vs. vaccinated. Yeah. There's really end goal bit frustrating I'm terribly sure answering question really. I'd hope consulted doctor making decision cost band gig. article UK situation general isn’t rosy picture may think. article makes clear people’s contacts 50% interactions pre-pandemic. due schools closing summer, workplaces continuing offer work home, and, NOBODY US talks weirdly, fact Britain contact tracing app enforces quarantine potentially exposed individuals (I idea never mentioned factor UK cases may coming down).

A doubling interactions would seem bring cases right back it’s UK back normal. UK taught us covid cases decline IF:

* Schools fully closed

* Eligible population highly vaccinated H1N1 far less dangerous COVID. estimated 284,000 people died H1N1 globally estimated 700 million 1.4 billion suspected cases; COVID killed 4.25 million people 200 million cases far. COVID killed people US alone highest estimates *global* deaths caused batted eye 

That's plain true all. day, still complaints overblew severity H1N1 governor made forbidden legally punishable government entity including school districts sort rules masks

Why okay? reasonable? complete idiots, embarrassing Dear Leader. certain severe undercount.  Well new data showing reduce transmissibility delta completely wrong. There's lot still know. vaccine certainly helps reduce symptoms think save fix BIG question. 

In case insurance paid vax. prevented going hospital would cost thousands, still paid mostly insurance paid employer. business hook it. 

Uninsured folks covered state and/or Feds, IOW paid taxes. Vaxing cheaper vaxing. Kinda like oil change. 

And taxpayer health insurance buyer that’s bottom line. vaccine hundred bucks, tops. think cost treatment unvax’d spending weeks ICU. Tens thousands dollars each. well hundreds thousands. Whole wards full people didn’t there. paying THAT? are. 

The cost gets folded already ridiculous health care costs.

I’m thinking maybe send bill Fox News. swear reddit told yesterday 70% eligible people US received least one dose far.

Over 70% adults received least one vaccine shot Yes, know that. sure point though, two different subjects. Unless point injustice world, point agree you! let’s fight injustice together! UN actually trying combat injustice, varying degrees success. properly funded could probably more. World Food Program, UN agency Nobel peace prize year it’s work combating hunger. Many UN agencies directly indirectly work end world hunger. world hunger also almost halved last 20 years, 15 8.9%, thanks part research work UN. Well duh mean Brits seem fine despite going Freedom Day. Though I‘d still wait school openings celebrating. seasonal aspects might relevant (for example, UK calm summer last year, places like Texas Florida time things worsened - sure coincidence something seasonal) /sigh Imagine beholden Dear Leader family dies covid hide admit anything... believes germs, sure. Started spraying everything rubbing alcohol brings home store pandemic started. hear airborne though. Maybe able kill Lysol makes feel powerless vulnerable?

I would guess (I talk often exercise futility frustration) argue science he's known years, school science. trust anything FOX News told distrustful of. safe go restaurants (especially ones “popping”) eat indoors everyone party vaccinated? hospitals filling supply chain issues make lousy time everyone. universal mask mandates lockdowns H1N1. time period Covid killed almost 400 kids, flu killed 0. Looking deaths NY, new vaccine pass requirement seems even absurd. won’t enforced September, meaning restriction last even delta subsides (not even major surge moment anyway, digress). NYC deal tourists well, meaning can’t ever time say “ok! enough New Yorkers vaccinated we’re clear!” end game guys. Unless people push back, reality good. didn’t want believe would come this. precedent set awful, regardless feel people choose get vaccinated. left wondering got vaccinated first place we’re still hysterics every person gets sick.

None us care. mad. You’re problem. stay home.

There’s reason you’re consistently downvoted bub.  pretty major denominator problems Israeli study. Pretty sure there’s discussion thread. I’d recommend looking Dvir Aran’s Twitter feed addressing (he one researchers study). ones I’m referring England study found New England Journal Medicine, recent study Canada, CDC’s metrics “leaked” slides.

Idiocracy cute movie, reflect reality. drummer tired global elitists lead singers shoving facts throat. I’m glad are! disrespectful unpleasant talk to. saying. didn’t say one unkind thing you.

Damn Americans internet’s fancy computers mean same. type insurance show state’s database, aren’t going give third.  That’s nice work, bot. noticed purely political posts derailing discussion?

We know it’s impossible fully separate politics issue obviously intentionally politicized still… Na-na, don’t get jab? Plus lead singer molecular biologist. can’t see fucking around that.  Please, educate us. like? tell friends family relatively normal life last 14 months without real fear catching virus. Meanwhile US it’s fucking everywhere name “freedom”. What’s free free fear death injury virus? got health reasons, talk primary care physician options, making decisions yourself. Reactive policy unvaccinated endangering children. Unvaccinated suffer like they’re prolonging pandemic suffering. Gringo bandito! hear also sings band time time Children major disease vectors, doesnt matter they’re relatively unharmed it. still spread like crazy.

Theres evidence support hildren major vector covid. dont even know you’re talking “why children arent required” statement... children arent eligible get vaccine hasnt fully FDA approved yet. Thats issue hand.

Plus overwhelming data shows far least susceptible virus  Coroner, Medical Training also said caught last year mild. 
Maybe drummer made uniquely qualified beat it. get chance stick around band find out. 
But he'll end becoming kind cymbal every Tom, Dick Harry pedals misinformation anti-vax crowd, even ensnared debate circumstance. Hope he's got thick skin. 
Good statement, thought. Hats him. 
There, hopefully hit bad wordplay good ones show up. talking different things. Cases per day falling. Currently active cases (those infected yet recovered) rising, /u/Hawfinch seems referring US excelled ignoring obvious truth years now.  read news last week? I'm gonna upset (yet glad) Delta variant false scare. ""People like me"" realize still middle deadly global pandemic, behavioral changes needed going forward keep dying. Time play comorbidities!  subreddit gone full panic mode point sticky post saying lot points made wrong. I’m also pretty much living life normally. I’m vaccinated. I’m talking last year churches know that. again, stupid dangerous. You’re cool badass rebel fought closures. mRNA fragile gone within day two vaccination. data something doesn’t exist. mount immune response left immune memory. long term effects immune response subject thousands scientific studies decades. nothing new here.  


There thing side effect vaccine starts years later. Vaccine side effects occur within six weeks vaccination. also chapter snobbish leaders like DeSantis refused put egos aside save lives, instead double downed policies made harder control spread. Braces for? It’s shot. Yes UK 80% massive new wave hit. think truth bit complicated this. (also UK relied heavily AZ offers reduced protection delta)  Early letting people handled rather well. problem became quickly looked sea people needing get in, limited entrances much longer would take basically sped line.

If anything example need way entrances checkpoints going verifying vaccinations negative test results. Vegas pretty intense ironically, given Nevada pretty anti mask/vax. Almost large events I've attended whole separate line verifying vax status (atleast one dose) prior entry conventions requiring proof doses. Fully support damn tons folks talk ear un-american is. VSVAX. parent, way avoid child getting illness affect beyond normal symptoms.... fucking avoid it. Even it’s miniscule really bad shit happen.

Why take chance children overwhelmingly affected virus yet FDA many vaccinations children required get attending public school. one clinical trials completed it’s approved FDA.

So, wait That's bit misleading. average age admission indeed gone down, 61% daily hospital admissions still 50+ Florida. 

Below table based [CDC admission rate Florida. use census data get populations, roughly accurate. 

Age Range|7-Day Admission Rate Per 100K|Total Population Age Range|Total Admissions Per Week
---------|----------|------------|------------|

Note distribution hospitalization admission rates age Georgia would result ~20% fewer hospitalizations per capita Florida. Well, I’m here. Stupidly dangerously living life normally. Wish luck. really hope comment true. thoughts exactly. Im scared freakin vaccine avoiding variant rise im scientist/doctor ill leave knowledge.  I'd say going better unvaxxed vaxed quarantine sytem defunct now, made app pretty pointless many people getting pinged

The app's notification period changed day two ago. soon see what, any, impact case numbers continuing fall. Lambda hasnt able outcompete Delta all, dont think going dominant US time soon basically bigger screen like usually Hospitals, please! WTF using public funds treat COVID cases unvaccinated!?!
 They've demonstrated disdain Public Health System, drive right past Church Party Headquarters get Hospital. Smashing Pumpkins? Thought Halloween Many people think they’ve covid, cannot get again. true.

A Coronavirus Epidemic Hit 20,000 Years Ago, New Study Finds

A dozen human genes rapidly evolved ancient East Asia thwart coronavirus infections, scientists say. genes could crucial today’s pandemic.


By Carl Zimmer
Published June 24, 2021Updated June 28, 2021

Researchers found evidence coronavirus epidemic swept East Asia 20,000 years ago devastating enough leave evolutionary imprint DNA people alive today.
Sign Science Times Get stories capture wonders nature, cosmos human body. Get sent inbox.

The new study suggests ancient coronavirus plagued region many years, researchers say. finding could dire implications Covid-19 pandemic it’s brought control soon vaccination.

“It make us worry,” said David Enard, evolutionary biologist University Arizona led study, published Thursday journal Current Biology. “What going right might going generations generations.”

Until now, researchers could look back far history family pathogens. past 20 years, three coronaviruses adapted infect humans cause severe respiratory disease: Covid-19, SARS MERS. Studies coronaviruses indicate jumped species bats mammals.

Four coronaviruses also infect people, usually cause mild colds. Scientists directly observe coronaviruses becoming human pathogens, relied indirect clues estimate jumps happened. Coronaviruses gain new mutations roughly regular rate, comparing genetic variation makes possible determine diverged common ancestor.

The recent mild coronaviruses, called HCoV-HKU1, crossed species barrier 1950s. oldest, called HCoV-NL63, may date back far 820 years.

But point, coronavirus trail went cold — Dr. Enard colleagues applied new method search. Instead looking genes coronaviruses, researchers looked effects DNA human hosts.

Over generations, viruses drive enormous amounts change human genome. mutation protects viral infection may well mean difference life death, passed offspring. lifesaving mutation, example, might allow people chop apart virus’s proteins.

But viruses evolve, too. proteins change shape overcome host’s defenses. changes might spur host evolve even counteroffensives, leading mutations.

When random new mutation happens provide resistance virus, swiftly become common one generation next. versions gene, turn, become rarer. one version gene dominates others large groups people, scientists know likely signature rapid evolution past.

In recent years, Dr. Enard colleagues searched human genome patterns genetic variation order reconstruct history array viruses. pandemic struck, wondered whether ancient coronaviruses left distinctive mark own.

He colleagues compared DNA thousands people across 26 different populations around world, looking combination genes known crucial coronaviruses kinds pathogens. East Asian populations, scientists found 42 genes dominant version. strong signal people East Asia adapted ancient coronavirus.

But whatever happened East Asia seemed limited region. “When compared populations around world, couldn’t find signal,” said Yassine Souilmi, postdoctoral researcher University Adelaide Australia co-author new study.

The scientists tried estimate long ago East Asians adapted coronavirus. took advantage fact dominant version gene starts passed generations, gain harmless random mutations. time passes, mutations accumulate.

Dr. Enard colleagues found 42 genes number mutations. meant rapidly evolved time. “This signal absolutely expect chance,” Dr. Enard said.

They estimated genes evolved antiviral mutations sometime 20,000 25,000 years ago, likely course centuries. It’s surprising finding, since East Asians time living dense communities instead formed small bands hunter-gatherers.

Aida Andres, evolutionary geneticist University College London involved new study, said found work compelling. “I’m quite convinced there’s something there,” said.

Still, didn’t think possible yet make firm estimate long ago ancient epidemic took place. “The timing complicated thing,” said. “Whether happened thousand years — personally think it’s something cannot confident of.”

Scientists looking drugs fight new coronavirus might want scrutinize 42 genes evolved response ancient epidemic, Dr. Souilmi said. “It’s actually pointing us molecular knobs adjust immune response virus,” said.

Dr. Anders agreed, saying genes identified new study get special attention targets drugs. “You know they’re important,” said. “That’s nice thing evolution.” problem, Thailand study shows antibody lasts 3 months update Indonesia 600 doctors dead, also include 500 nurses, 300 midwives, hundreds dentists, pharmacists health workers, according independent data collection site Lapor COVID-19.

Yeah got shock month ago looking British numbers. Good news already petering without causing nearly many deaths (100/day opposed 1,500/day January).  right approach. works right now, might force live like forever. vaccine less effective ones also. day open little bit more, screwed. believe UK right approach right now. USA good lifted many restrictions early. Canada wait get 75% fully vaxxed lifting remaining restrictions think similar approach like UK after.

Zero Covid impossible require tremendous amount ressources delay problem. rate, cases double next week people start die one two weeks hospital. going really ugly. early indicators showing vaccination increasing 5 states hit hardest COVID low vaccination rates (Louisiana, Missouri etc). 

I'm judging people, quite frankly tragedy likely could avoided. I'd also point media politicians sides aisle this. late summer 2020 steady number articles democrat leaders planting seeds doubt vaccine implying Trump would pressure medical professionals accelerate release vaccine even safe. Kamala Harris leading charge. viewpoints safety vaccine used political parties political points based presidential politics. They're reviewing data already. Generally drugs get EUA take years full approval (read: wait turn). obviously priority. surprised couple months most.  Yes clear that, particularly two doses Pfizer continue take care myself. 
 
But thought vaccine would help lower contagion numbers. 
 
But shocked see graphic Iceland many people vaccinated yet contagions like year ago worst times.

I know wearing mask taking simple precautions equals ""not living life""; seems bit melodramatic though common formulation sub. goal meant met June could've even earlier people willing. make much difference since herd immunity probably around 80-90% total population. monster Ok, saying three categories? Asymptomatic, suspected confirmed daily briefing says new number category transfers various categories (so would something like 3 numbers 3 4 transfer numbers). seems like complicated way communicate cases. Obsessively unvaccinated? Oh entering strange times. assume anything

You Imagen band mate molecular biologist, he's probably got strong opinions COVID traveshamockery.  Damn Americans using American website American daylight hours. call hollandaise hot sauce Scare word according who? Can't say see way guess. asshat job-shadow covid unit nurses least 3 12 (in reality, 13+) hour shifts. 

And help post mortem care everyone dies. it’s happened it’s suddenly BFD.

Oxygen-wasting asshole. Here's thing though. Even check everyone, threat possibility actually help. Go train ride Europe sometime. rails ticket takers wander train check tickets...sometimes. times honor system. still ensures people buy ticket. bad move. would data hurt? Seems want hide data. 

A high positivity rate tell much community spread. There's disturbing contingent people online (and media well) going palpably upset/angry keep getting ""bigger badder variants"". virus blockbuster movie franchise keeps upping stakes pleasure/amusement folks.

For know next ""big"" variant going super spreading innocuous virus super low fatality rate.  makes confident get rid it? explain 45% young people, least likely voted him, still vaccinated. I've read claimed last year "" mild "" him. agree 100% concerts tours. events done proof vaccination. Cool, deleted post.

It excuse putting bullshit anti-vax oneliners instagram post. Would surprised still reason booted. Didn’t learn Sturgis last year….what makes think learned anything since then? 90% elderly vaccinated, hospitals aren’t going initial surges long shot remember events, haven’t seen connection (although it’s obvious)… literature/ analysis it? It’s resistant Covid classic  severe reaction previous vaccine paralyzed. 

Forcing people likely negative reactions vaccine creates doubt people see severe side effects. 

You find dozens stories. stories create antivaxxers medical professionals checking see patient checked doctor first getting it. 
We know side effects vaccine range next nothing, like me, severe. fear legitimate antivax confirm. Abbott definitely tool who’s concerned pandering base making life death decisions favor corporations citizens. total ass. problem young kids covid babies responsibly kept home getting colds illnesses strengthen immune system. parent 2.5 year old, one cold since birth, Im concerned. Oh required show something? Plus it’s outside??

Yeah whole bunch press nothing truly negative vaccinated, would good test vaccines. Maybe? bet either gets Alzheimer's diagnosis charge money laundering 2024. watch interviews 60s, mental decline really apparent echoes Reagan.  There's Delta PLUS variant?

Oh boy.... people legitimate reasons vaccinated

Yeah, immune compromised people, like cancer patients transplant receipients (the people rely everone else get vaccinated).

He isnt either either those. statements, seems least halfway countless folks (like me) shots carry greater risk virus. us don’t publicly share private decision made careful consideration doctors. know it’s easy conversation unfold. looks like half population shockingly different reaction jabs expected — it’s probably life experiences actually shockingly different, reasons range conscientious risk/benefit analysis, financial inability take time work/lack health care event potential side-effects, understandable distrust system never prioritized health well-being communities. would physically impossible. 100 0 absolutes. Even Measles, R0 high 17, herd immunity threshold 100%. 100 high go, like 0 lowest go. HI threshold 100, means every single person get infected vaccinated.

Basically get HI threshold 99%, increases R0 Basically move HI threshold would keep adding another order magnitude. go 99% 99.1, 99.2, etc. hit 99.9%, would go 99.91, 99.92. infinite amount keep reach 100. would call tripling surge Lmao literally mention confirmation asymptotic spread kids all. gotta kidding me! one tell migrant carrying covid car? ""migrant covid carrier"" mean here? Seems rather racist. like one gives shit whiny vaccine mandates.

Stay home. already isn’t false scare many locations. Iceland, Israel, US forced reimpose restrictions, right Louisiana hit time high hospital bed use. Shit like believe hospitals turn away people refused vaccine. shouldn’t take hospital beds.  also implies nothing feasibly end COVID. It’s endemic around long gone. yes, significantly less dangerous H1N1 children. spreads faster. God hate guy  that's case might well go die  lot people apparently think there's zero risk vaccinated unfortunately. obviously true. drop mitigation practices return pre-pandemic life. get it. liberating hell, risk, albeit low. go expose large crowds confined spaces prolonged period time, gonna get blasted ton virus someone positive. Delta, viral dose apparently, much stickier spike protein. Hell, people get vaxxed, so-called breakthroughs reported. Numbers. long keep peeps hospital morgue matters. that....   comment understand? Surge general scare word. Could used doubled, tripled, etc 2-minute search subreddit shows articles. arguing bad faith Children group seem protection original virus maybe Alpha, youngest children always higher risk school age children.

The early data China However, found proportion severe critical cases 10.6%, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1%, 3.0% age groups &lt;1, 1 5, 6 10, 11 15, years, respectively. results suggest young children, particularly infants, vulnerable 2019-nCoV infection. feeling whatever natural resistance children infection disappeared Delta. It’s much infectious. perhaps year largely staying home precautions, they’ve stopped exposed regularly various cold bugs blunted innate immunity. actually read article see actually talk different reasons medical ones. hope every single one gets COVID additional complications positive test would put someone either ""confirmed case"" ""symptomatic infection"" category, would definitely reported.

Not according criteria linked. document used ""confirmed"" ""suspected"". Maybe saying even additional categories end, China's reported numbers almost certainly much closer true numbers reported countries - simply China tests extensively.

It depends mean ""true numbers"". country catching COVID symptoms considered case COVID. PRC catching COVID symptoms considered case COVID, numbers mean different things. 

Also (if understand correctly) according sent ""symptoms"" (enough considered PRC suspected case) would need positive X-ray blood test (not positive PCR test) addition normal symptoms like fever. see anything discussion ""symptomatic"" document sent. Though criteria seem make much harder considered ""suspected"" ""confirmed"" would considered symptomatic countries. forget tens thousands dollars care treatment. vaccine free, staying hospital cost money. Entensive care expensive care. despise him. He’s complete fucking moron IQ lower ballet flats. supporters dumber is.

I certainly didn’t vote wouldn’t least bit upset removed office. would like see actual data instead news stories since know data reliable, opposed media hasn’t proven same.   Terrible idea. fair people living areas people won’t get it. card says bring back back card right? Apparently not. I’m gonna go concert next Tuesday there’s nothing it. Stop trying control life I’ll stop making assumptions. good one!! could maybe sympathize didn’t include last paragraph informed consent everyone doesn’t want vaccine whatever stupid reason heard. Once, security guard festival found glass bowl poorly tried sneak back pocket waved clarified smoking pot. Got Snoop Dogg’s set time. Don’t know downvoted it’s true laugh. gets deployed Afghanistan (or whatever terrible mission) resigns account vaccination? Forgoing sweet pension bc won’t get shot? don’t see Defintely Army trying downsize anyway. significant risk ""long term"" effects covid vaccines use. risk pandemic going unabated far greater.


For one, know vaccine works, components leave body short period time. something that's going continue effect body leaves.

Even care people care disruptive pandemic life. best weapon end move vaccines. starting. want see high goes? Well.. guess really choice. Thank POS Amlo think baseball game Yes treat people inflict harm lower priority others. flood antivaxxers going take significant amount medical resources responsible people vaxxed people start dying need reprioritize receives treatment ppl refuse get vaccine? article linked literally says government preparing lockdown September.  punishing families. Actions, meet consequences. Florida herd immunity first, also casualties ""someone add 1 look suspicious""   worst over

Not Louisiana Florida, set new records hospitalizations. Texas, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi far behind.

If could stop spiking ball 5 yard line, would great. We'll never get unless do. agree incentive place day 1. Lack foresight. Next stimulus checks tied vaccination status well COVID-boosted unemployment benefits (if still thing, I'm thankfully still employed) two options- reply, use ad hominem argument terrible. went latter. LMAO. seem dubious roll Australia. People location approximately time tier 1 contacts, people different times contacts first tier 2 contacts, etc. works. Covid eradicated approach (or could bit late rest world now). variants eventually percentage go 100% I’m really seeing there, chance could link specific page? comments already getting removed uncivil absurd, stop.

Vaccine mandates coming. allowed bars, restaurants, gyms, businesses require it.

Your problem. I’m laughing you. people like you. 🤷🏻‍♂️ people Reddit downvote hard over. someone points it’s keyboard warriors enforce mask mandates. It’s largely underpaid service employees. Easy 100% mask mandates you’re separated public consequences. Fuck can’t get vaccinated, right?  Same… aside mask requirements don’t recall told needed Covid test vaccinated (although am). Ah, makes sense. Nope. concertgoers share blame. CDC's site says avoid large gatherings like concerts, possible. absolutely chose part mess.

Also responsible: public officials concert   Avoid reposting information, please. Let em face consequences. Avoid reposting information, please. Delta means need like 85-90% fully vaccinated/acquired immunity.






Source? I'd read elsewhere cases reported mire recently, also unusual small number cases vaccines given triggering immune response. privilege able vaccinated. actually read [the study referring opposed CNBC’s distillation. “Discussion” component study, published CDC’s “Morbidity Mortality Weekly findings report subject least four limitations. First, data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, outbreak. population-level vaccination coverage increases, vaccinated persons likely represent larger proportion COVID-19 cases.

They aren’t saying vaccine doesn’t anything, isn’t true—it keeps alive hospital worst. saying that, people getting vaccinated, inherently comprise larger larger proportion cases.

They don’t even say anything vaccine discussion implications study public Jurisdictions might consider expanded prevention strategies, including universal masking indoor public settings, particularly large public gatherings include travelers many areas differing levels SARS-CoV-2 transmission.

They primarily using event discuss likely benefits masking large events taking place indoor areas significant amounts travelers, especially come COVID hot spots. acknowledge several limitations study, however, one related demography going events.

They say nothing vaccine worthless, it’s true. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

And people ate indoors 2020 glad I'm vaxxed.  thinking Trump all, looks nuanced originally appeared

Woah, mean there's story clickbait headline? I'm europe, NYC, offer example; get ""digital certificate"" scanned QR code app. get jabs, apply 6-month version antibody test. There's provision prove negative.

A negative RT-PCR test valid travel (for 72 hours), get QR code bars checking. ...did go back 2020?  Well means 70% adults America [protected least virus 98%+ people survive own. That's pretty good news opinion. never get 100% population get fully vaccinated, okay sometimes celebrate positive news. Came say that. People tying knots ignoring medical exemptions. COVID-19 Delta might require 5 minutes exposure. 

**One Song.**

Think it. lol Exactly like US presidency senate. Majority enough. poetic similarity... Spray tan seems bit place. Great news! Fingers crossed makes through! Melatonin powerful antioxidant anti-inflammatory properties fights apoptosis (programmed cell death). also helps boater nitric oxide (NO) levels, been/is studied symptom severe Covid (lower levels example, airway obstruction sleep apnea), treatment Covid delivered nasal spray (see SanOtize example). 

Interestingly, bats, host 124 coronaviruses, produce high melatonin levels, children produce adults, even older adults.

Here’s great article explains melatonin great detail layman’s safe one allowed restaurants gyms.  I’m pretty sure paper records accepted. I’ve heard Excelsior Pass (what state using) accepts NY records. Key NYC app accepts records, though Sounds like feelings hurt.

I think loves dropping quotes media.

He's Trump-level troll, that's Repubs love much. “many” already vaccinated… got j&amp;j April ny, signed pfizer got first jab July 24th. signed second dose automatically.

Should get skip? ended BLM protests probably want care. Let people want? What? person says antibodies.

Many, many people ate restaurants pre-vaccine. Would like needle right left cheek? cascade covid sturgis last year, BLM Trump Jan 6th protests.  


I nurse vaccinated, seen huge spikes covid type gatherings know Ohh mean like COVID went rampant Tokyo? Kinda thing ain’t it? Large groups people unmasked including nonvaxxers sure masks Waiting republicans spin this.

I'm assuming Hutchinson reverse himself. seems standard response accidentally spoken truth Republican. would anyone proof this, point? 

Is supposed tell every minimum wage employee private health history take word it?

There needs official medical exemptions. That’s NYC making system, separate Excelsior Invest no-fog spray Amazon. least, that's hear. glasses normally fog up, pretty good fit around nose wear frames edge mask. Thanks bothering type reply rather heap people downvote question doctors cited reason history Guillain-Barré Syndrome - that's associated viral vector vaccines

Yep seems questionable. didnt know mRNA links GBS statement went echo sympathy usual antivaxer BS

When posted read first paragraphs. yeah seem bit dodgy. 

There going small set people recommended vaccinated. must suck immediately lumped antivaxxer morons. mask mandate Louisiana schools? Vaccinated people likely get covid even less likely seriously ill die it. vaccine available every adult months now. Everyone wants one getting one. adults make decisions. can't force them, time let go let suffer concequences decision.

Or maybe anti-vaxxer think protect you? Particularly one PhD mRNA vaccines.  Interesting MS community watch discussion around brain fog. common disease, long time issue significantly discounted majority others. sudden called disability. 

Welcome. forget shortly.  Im likely die car accident covid right (vaccinated 31 year old good health). wear mask lower risk indoors im putting life hold it.  First off, get frustration anger. I’m you. many people freaking idiots seem set self-destruction.

Second, yeah it’s drop bucket. Every time save half-gallon water (I live parched CA) gallon gas environmental good deed, think “so what, corporations undo thousand times minute”.

But it’s *I* do. can’t become CEO change corporate policy, little letters congressmen probably unread - tiny part make problem worse. 

My dad died Covid, along sad, shrugged shoulders - didn’t believe masks went eat etc. Live sword, die sword. mom spent year house, wears masks faithfully needed, every little thing reduce risks. I’ll keep wearing mask me, people like her. state New York using Excelsior Pass app, city New York using Key NYC app  Anyone’s guess. Mine US, fall likely see sharp decline cases get delta surge. Depends local transmission level, health, health people around, level risk tolerance. actually kind sad. According Pete, actually medical reason get vaccine (Gillian-Barre Syndrome, peripheral neuropathy/demyelination autoimmune reaction people vaccinations). Apparently J&amp;J vaccine 100 cases 12.5 million doses administered It’s ridiculously low incidence, he’s person increased baseline risk. type person herd immunity meant protect. It’s unfortunate put situation hordes selfish idiots allowing pandemic rage on. Honestly though numbers place I’d probably still get it, guess doctor knows better seen GBS reaction first hand. 

And want try call idiot anti-vaxxer, take look post history think I’ve past couple years. Avoid reposting information, please. don’t ID get vaccine passport?   Oh no, cases! CASES! case! PCR tests faulty, vaccines leaky covid scam. Vaccine still effective. Stopped reading that. Im vaccinated family Yikes internal CDC document stated risk severe COVID vaccinated 1/25th risk severe covid unvaccinated, else equal. That's efficacy high 90%'s. 

With that, cases go 25X (as happened last months), vaccinated actually higher risk severe COVID unvaccinated months ago, else equal. Exactly. greed, disregard environment, arrogance nature, thinking control everything, brought us are. deal consequences, long time. Right, /r/worldcoronavirus fight it. who’s going enforce this? people barely enforced masks. Lololol many China EU donated far? Next month? Schools went back *this week* many districts.

The shit upon us friend. Random stranger, i'm pulling you. Hope get better soon. think might live streamed it, date? 

Also it’s festival season right now; lineups bit weaker usual point wooks coming full force one stop them. It’s good time. Things pregnancy, fertility, long-term effects cases like MS already seeming immediate effects.  realize feel frustration. work office one wearing mask still got covid I'm pissed too. every little bit helps comes kids especially tried get tickets zootopia sold man. Demographics. cases past year returning chinese citizens, generally younger healthier individuals. cases running rampant retirement homes.

Maybe. That's cool unless children child. know minorities low rates right? 3,582 people 10 million. Thays .0035% population LA county.  yeah, pretty easy know vaccinated person tested positive. Wondering too. determined go backwards, it’s starting feel like never. Yes question could rigorously vet religious sincerity? asking anyone heard anything medical exemptions posts immediately removed. two talking different things. 

Them: vaccinated higher risk spread around less spread around them

You: vaccinated lower risk unvaccinated. 

Both things true. Look baseball games, festivals, outdoor concerts, etc. don’t get particular one upsets many people they’re required get vaccinated anyway. You’re American website.  herd immunity smallpox.  vaccine wiped out.

Pretty sure polio.

""50% Ameirca vaccinated"" ......is statement least 1 shot (the whole series vaccines require 2 doses i.e. Fully Vaccinated)? Probably close, like 48-49% latter 50% former. Yes, absolutely think possible reason moderately intelligent person would fence mask wearing. we’re pledging every country combined. Scaled population every low income country, numbers aren’t exaggerations US expected this. don’t data yet, know viral load far higher preliminary studies show greater infection rates. nothing else, force fucked with. understand data robust J&amp;J lack reporting extremely frustrating. saw NPR article weeks ago saying J&amp;J effective completely conflicting articles saying really effective. get logic 

If FDA approves month, suddenly needed. day/week/month wasn't...? 

In world other, equally reputable, non-US agencies approved recommending 3rd dose, blindly US-centric perspective help anyone matter r number. infected people average infecting half people reduces r half. makes think that? keep seeing poeple say it. Delta basically wildfire unvaccinated kindling point, going burn schools quickly . 2 kids 12 wife teacher. told 2 weeks ago expect 4 us likely infected within next 2 months. seems inevitable point. Wife fully vaxxed going matter amount exposures wife kids exposed classrooms 8 hours day. 

My two hopes. 

1. school districts go virtual first 4 weeks school(i doubt happen though)
2. Statistically 4 us either asymptomatic mild infections still give much assurance though. say 3.7k symptomatic

No didn't

I said : ""Out 7k 3.7k symptoms **long enough log**""


You literally read study dumb understand (even though literally included flow chart) completely agree.  Well, could try protect people real stress test given understanding, people previously infected got vaccinated expected even better protection vaccination earlier infection alone. Lol, ass gasket. understand now. Never understood point that. like tissue paper stopping anything I'm afraid ass touching. Seems like wierd waste paper... 18 USC 1001 kinda catch-all statute false statements related federal government. Faking CDC card would likely fall it. faked CVS proof vaccination document might kind state-level fraud statutes violates, fall federal crime. Well IVIG 1st 3 weeks later doctor determined didn’t work plasmapherisis finally stopped white blood cells attacking nervous system intense physical occupational therapy. year could get back things used 3 years get feel today - hang hoping find relief soon sort relevant licensing body here? people told mask mandates would lifted vaccinations rates 70%+, lot people would willing comply. CDC fault enacting reenacting mandates quickly. Thank you! keep trying remind that, stressful sure. selfish. I'm angry elementary children work high school angry they've deal going college. beyond unfair third school year affected. I'm ready done. seems like never end. Maybe Governor DeSantis help.

* course, might take months powerful new variant comes need whole new vaccine. approve without going normal process, layperson seems like inevitability anyway, would seriously undermine credibility public's trust agency.

Plus, *were* find strange safety issue serious enough warrant rejection, want know stop using vaccine, give people boosters, etc.? would giant cluster fuck, pretending issue exist right move. statistics relevant discussion. simply matter virus mutates become less deadly due vaccines - current lethality arbitrary lower common flu due vaccines. vaccinated people start dying regularity, makes sense discuss again.

It's like getting ocean, worried dying rip current 10 people last week died rip current. Seems reasonable, ask lifeguard rip currents, says there's rip currents today, safe. answer good enough me, friend continue discuss potential chance death rip current ocean today. appropriate thing worry rip currents today, continue ask lifeguard rip currents go back beach tomorrow next day. Sure, requiring proof vaccination party outdoors following CDC health guidelines. need public good. development paused? throw room 29 developmentally challenged kids? 

So long they’re interactions humans, it’s probably going fine. don’t attend in-person school school unmasked doesn’t mean won’t interact people.  us kind accept go broke due health care costs anyway Might dumb question, okay take xanax receiving mRNA vaccine? reduce effects?  way help people need getting damn vaccine reduce amount virus circulation. 

Fake virtuous people annoy even plain old selfish people sometimes. I’ll keep trying! hope don’t get delta’d anyway enough people SF announced J&amp;J people get mRNA dose. know thats 1 city likely doesnt help unless maybe coming soon combat maskne? I've heard using mouthwash right wearing helps kills lot bacteria would otherwise become trapped face. wear mask long enough period learning see really helps, though. try keep trips places people short possible. GA parent here. thought too. local public schools decided masks optional. measures dropped entirely. BUT, they're still tracking cases quarantining close contacts. 

I'm angry, also genuinely baffled. series thoughts possibly led set policies? Let's maximize conditions fastest spread also shut everything whenever find cases.

Fun fact: school street house sent first contact risk email official first day school. Apparently bunch families attended open house, found COVID, informed school. Thank clearing up! Real life Plague Inc.  Headaches, fatigue, difficulty swallowing, can’t quite get eyes focus, randomly armpit opposite side hurts.

Hopefully passes soon There’s lot requires debunking, minutes.

First, Israel better finding breakthrough infections they’re actually looking them. It’s within last week US stopped discouraging doctors administering COVID tests people vaccinated. means intentionally flying blind breakthrough infections.

Other countries realizing something wrong, they’re starting testing delta breakthroughs, they’re finding lot them.

And death become lot less common, long COVID still happening 20% vaccinated. That’s worse odds playing Russian roulette.

Then there’s organ damage blood clotting issues. need studies them.

You *not* want get COVID even you’re vaccinated. It’s far plausible you’re going end severe health problems next couple decades.

We needed irradiate COVID start whole mess, back people it. big business prioritized short term profits, pushed governments get things reopened quickly possible.

There corruption, manipulated, way many people seem think. Begone, troll. he’s politically smart knows base. name “freedom” base eat anything think he's mad think people :""( poor baby I? Nope, never have. millions upon millions dont use reddit never see comment? Absolutely. dropped box outside drive through? seen tests done stores. 

Surface transmission covid really happen like bag snot samples radioactive.  great comment knuckleheads. even knuckle-draggers. 

These people use wrists land-rudders. that's case taking forever U 12 approved get vaccine? never heard UK referred 'the kingdom' ngl sounds pretty cool. never Florida. public restrooms paper toilet seat covers put seat sit down. flushable believe. friend calls ""ass gaskets"" there's actual mask mandate nearly everyone wearing cloth surgical masks effective reducing amount virus getting expelled room. offer minimal protection wearer breathing in. environment many others wearing masks best wear respirator provides filtration. 

However even day CDC explicitly recommends N95s (claiming necessary reserved medical staff) refuse endorse foreign masks like KN95s.   Hence confused. Vermont shouldn’t red/orange/brown counties. (Except Essex.) may may much good long run, depending specifics whatever variant emerges next. unclear evades immunity replicates fast immune response sufficient. guess that's semantic, spike replicate much still able bind epitope. replies mention, *did* live viruses. Additionally, COVID-19 polio, smallpox, similar horrible diseases. Look, it’s bad, already seeing mortality reduced substantially. US 20-60k influenza deaths year, that’s vaccines treatment. trying one crazy people try call COVID like flu, point we’ve living influence tens thousands mortalities annually long us alive. eliminate COVID, suspect vaccinations, treatments lingering immunity infected (notably lasting B cell responses), virus going less severe time moves on. That's great us got J&amp;J vaccine? I've really worried efficacy Delta also wanted get Pfizer Moderna jab without professional guidance. remember idealistic utopian promise free flow information. days. Tennessee too. can’t tell jealous Illinois school mask mandate. daughter started school yesterday. one wearing mask. pointing specific actions one country try explain entire region performed better.

I'm pointing specific actions illustrate large cultural differences East Asia West. Countries East Asia follow exact policies, share broad common cultural characteristics make organizing effective societal response getting widespread compliance possible. people isolate asked so? careful people everyday lives? government says leave apartment, comply? leaders willing mobilize large, organized effort (to test, distribute food, etc.), population participate? people mind tracked public health would love hear perspective Peru could possibly beat back virus, say entirely doable.

I said entirely doable Europe US. much poorer societies, much difficult take necessary measures, get effective compliance known, currently unknowable.

Not possible, done years pandemic: widespread exposure hypothesizing simply occurred. Ya true.

Vaccine could still make less likely get infected infected contagious anyone.

It’s like said bullet penetrates bullet proof vest, person bleeds much someone without bullet proof vest. Doesn’t mean bullet proof vests don’t work time.   Close eyes, goes away. Plus I’ve seen isn’t likely vaccine evading variant. MRNA vaccines pretty good job. Romania giving vaccinating people. population can't bothered get vaccine. Anyone wants get right away, doses given countries expire unused. “you believe actual statistics”? Lmfaooo

You nothing. Literally nothing. blatantly false claims take two seconds debunk. Everything said abject falsehood. Shameful.  People think future never fear repercussions. way get widespread present day ostracism. That's react badly called out. Gov. DeSchultz-is. Exactly.

I’m sorry :( heart goes still thinks high school college students suffer die. Right. even academically peer-reviewed, feedback could still article shit. developed critical condition vaccine. Use brain. links studies? found one singapore used moderna/pfizer found:

""Seventy-one individuals fully vaccinated therefore met definition vaccine-breakthrough infection. Sixty-six participants (93%) received two doses Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine.""

Which means 7% breakthrough cases study moderna, doesnt say many overall vaccinated population two. could way people vaccinated pfizer.

My wife RN. said get people run ragged save people tiny, effortless, trivial thing protect themselves.

If comes hospital asking care COVID patients, retiring. course unrelated. 

It tells us much lack breakthrough cases becise lack contact virus. 

The vast, vast majority breakthrough case numbers vaccines, gotten infected even unvaccinated. recurring assumption probably arises entire year reading nothing bad news. I'm sure number accurate doubt VA 600k active cases 700k total cases. Delta showing there's talking endgame without herd immunity levels vaccinations, probably done within short enough time frame they'll effective whatever variants gained traction meantime. problem US there's way keep virus evolving, people still sabotaging effort deal even old version winter.

I’d say that’s pretty low.  hear this, also look around actual people know, vaccinated not, look fucking sick maimed are. don’t need media tell avoid shit costs  nothing statistical never vaccine history vaccines shown long term side affects outside 2 month window. considering we’ve vaccinated 100’s millions people period longer 2 months rational waiting time side effects doesn’t sync scientific medical research happened point humanities history. risk calculation woefully base. people still catching covid giving disease ample time opportunity continue mutate potentially mutate strain better evade vaccinations even worse position start whole thing. appears driven unvaccinated country others vaccines readily available said unvaccinated think smarter researched people living. This. I'm let natural selection take course point. I'm beyond tired pandering around select group wanna help anyways. (I get kids certain groups people literally can't get vaccine)  unvaccinated case rates per 100k there? Yeah there's really going back square one point. Setbacks expected, though recycles. Never late, especially get amended school starts. Sad many feel need cater fact-free feelings. Murphy, that's insult Knuckles Echidna. maybe know, would explain they've saying months months.

SURVIVE.  you’re USA, check Walgreens. coronavirus Ba Sing Se sources confirm bias valid. get it. unless compare unvaccinates cases. 

If COVID spreading there, course breakthrough cases. 

So what's rate unvaccinated cases per 100,000 there? Yeah, disagree completely think naive expect happen. notice ""a vaccine-evading variant mutations away"" thing Walensky? indicative direction public health take coming months/years i.e constantly maximum alert permanent restrictions can't return normal vaccine-evading variant around corner. actual probability happening irrelevant, even proven be, sake argument, 0.00001% they'd still back permanent mandates.

Even made vaccine mandatory got shots arms bet enough remove masks now, least Americans got taste normalcy while, much Europe probably remain masked decades come, feels like every day there's another ""expert"" another country calling permanent restrictions.  Lambda already around. may circumvent vaccines...and dangerous boot Kids vote parents change vote, skin nose. lockdown pointing to? others said Tokyo much, much populous NYC. 

Put another way: greater Tokyo area (37m) population entire state California (39m). Lol it’s also fauci we’re talking crazy thing whole thing whole bunch old, white Republicans going fucking die. base. kill base. flu

Practically one subreddit qualified medical professionals, that's decision left relevant individuals charge health mandates. seeing we're amidst Covid-19 pandemic, would covid vaccine. really understand intent question. Source delta variant killing “lots lots children”? ""End"" almost here. Even delta run end sooner think. last year's rally cause surge, CDC still discovered outbreak Minnesota linked (and pre-Delta): brother's friend killed months ago. depressed mostly living except going occasionally old friends. got covid. recovery continued lockdown county got isolated eventually killed himself. “braces”? prepares, plans, welcomes? “Braces” implies negative connotation military going push back. not. required take many vaccinations, one more.

Everyone covered also, actual shot small barely mark anything arm. take bandaid one notice. visa holder wants visit family home come back work. Anyone partner abroad. Business people want see investment doing. Plenty reasons enter USA. outlier I’m sure someone work got COVID ago vaccinated(not sure one) recently caught again.This new variant joke Got data similar scenario virus spread? Oh great, counterfeit vaccine cards? Well makes feel better ones believe science don’t post already left group crazy Yes, peoples brains far hardwired reject anything outside politics. brains physically cannot say yes.

I'm need do. comorbidities, got 3rd short. circlejerk half country(reds) stupid entirely kaiser partnered politifact.

14% blues 58% reds never want vaccine. certainly skews reds detrimental they're alone. reds getting vaccinated.

The strangest divide seems health insurance not. People insurance seem care much less vaccine. They'll move goalposts demand people live entire lives vaccine first.  Breakthrough cases aren’t really news either keep hearing those, too. It’s clickbait. Seems possible places. Florida may gotten unlucky, addition Governor idiot. would want bring back masks? benefit?

This conspiracy thinking. say, ""Never attribute malice adequately explained stupidity."" think anyone knows yet. 1 dose JJ outperforms 2 dose chinese inactivated virus vaccines 2 dose CurVac mRNA vaccine. said, JJ running 2 dose trial expect show improved results. Let's go estimated cases instead go confirmed cases that's we're 148 pediatric 188 reported pediatric flu deaths: 
43% (81) occurred children younger 5 years old 
12 occurred children younger 6 months thus young get flu vaccine 
57% (107) deaths occurred children 5-17 years old 
Of 175 pediatric deaths among children known information medical conditions, 76 (43.4%) pre-existing medical condition. 
Nearly two-thirds deaths attributed influenza B infections.

2019-2020 highest recorded deaths record (It became must report 2004)  possible many older may able get due health issues. People would get vaccinated. 100%. belive me, google smallpox look pictures. nsfl, squeamish rather don't. Ask danger poses. Even water dangerous drink much. 

Ask actually explain mechanism hopefully realize dumb is. Marching us deaths. flu currently active pandemic. still exist, pandemic phase need restrictions fight  It’s worth mentioning 89 years old. Didn’t cause surge last year (no verifiable peer reviewed evidence), probably won’t year. 

Not saying it’s possible, unlikely significant impact. (Although it’d cool vaccination policy place - would probably convince get attend). appear anywhere 3-14 days like previous variants symptoms appear emerge quickly average, around days 3-5, due much higher viral load presence. Loud pipes? Nah son gimme loud ventilator. Yeah, recommend taking break doomsday messaging. Even SAGE report UK last week stated *equally likely* Covid mutated less virulent (on par common colds). statement can’t live friends Covid without mitigations totally absurd ignores past pandemics long history humans viruses. could selection bias since vaccinated people know probably got Pfizer begin North FL here. 7 toddlers COVID ICU local hospital yesterday, wife waited nine hours COVID test. god damn right! Muiuurrrrrrfyxkingcuh! agree you. Whatever saves lives goal every party involved. 

The way around would work better; required go hospital get checked on. quarantine home doctor determines safe so. could also done remotely less-severe cases. Zoom call doctor, talk symptoms state, doctor determines ok stay home.

Artificially limiting eligible go hospitals prevents people getting check-up need most. varies everyone sort tired 99+ temp (not even technically fever) half day dose. gave excuse relax play Zelda. good paying job. Maybe need bring immigrants willing work cheaper. /s politicians would say that. thinking it. China lock city local transmission cases, motive hide cases avoid lock downs. local lock down, cases. Yup lol lol. like every medication treatment study blah blah blah scientific, LA County 0.27% people J&amp;J vaccine tested positive, 0.15% Pfizer, 0.09% Moderna. people even get chickenpox twice. unusual, unknown. daughter chickenpox two (pre-chickenpox vaccine) 5 poxes whole body. doctor confirmed chickenpox. 

At 15 again! far worse case usually older kids adults. believe chicken pox despite distinctive symptoms, doctor confirmed said unusual (not rare), definitely unknown, especially child mild case first time. 

Her body simply produce enough antibodies first go-round fight later exposure. 

The thing happen viruses like covid. enough antibodies produced first time, antibodies reduce number time leading possibility reinfection. thing happen we're seeing new genetic variant disease (such delta) may susceptible antibodies produced either earlier infection vaccination. 

A huge reason everyone vaccinated quickly possible prevent long term prevalence disease population, many ""generations"" organism time chances mutate evolve resistance current vaccines.  don’t think understand , also realize isn’t intention here. 'We dream treated like cattle' Wow, right then. Sorry hear it. Yeah correct

You need mix vectors two dose viral vector based vaccines mean I’m sure I’m going keep since started. Working living best life(pun intended) injured vaccine earlier life. guess shouldn’t expected actually understand context topic you’re commenting on.  vaccine preventing far 90% hospitalizations. 99.999% people hospitalized U.S vaccinated. Jokes you!

Corporate America decided start donating insurrectionists again, instead. called AFC, Walgreens, CVS. fastest time. Yes, probably find place--but experience now. another one fear mongering headlines? didn’t say it’s sure thing. could happen: That’s great hear. like, slam dunks, like remdesivir Following NYC's lead solid move. ever want fully ""get back normal"", let economy fully recover COVID, spend next half-decade forever fighting new variant outbreaks, need real engagement. can't let least responsible people room de-facto decide us.  tried nothing work. father got heart damage flu post-viral syndrome new thing. flu actually quite dangerous cause tons deaths bad years. Guy becoming bigger douche bag day. could hand wave biological explanation either direction, proof ultimately data points Fox testified court think parents idiots thinking Tucker Carlson news anchor entertainer. let know that. wrong, interpretation incorrect. current vaccine effective original Sars-Covi-2 Alpha. messaging vaccine true.

So, yes true would likely prevent infections Alpha earlier strains. Now...it true vaccine prevents hospitalizations Delta always point vaccinations, prevent hospitalization death good job, best we've ever seen, ask anybody they'll tell you. SERIOUSLY underestimating flu don’t see lot people wearing masks unfortunately.  think good lowest members society. even COVID ends tomorrow another pandemic line animal agriculture yet enough people still seem think ""need"" meat worth.

'Scuse me? folks like don’t see much difference two parties vote independent

*""Dems/left-leaning/progressives need solidify votes one candidate rather splitting votes green/3rd party candidates...""*

Voting independent contributes republican votes, right, indeed misinformation campaigns, well, still means republican voters boots ballot, reason point remains valid... Covid got politicized. One side care enough virus, caused huge knee-jerk reaction side, resulting many taking opposite extreme. 

The CDC gave political pressure. Given people get regarding beliefs Covid, honestly surprised later came outright *threatened* bringing back masks.  Yes!!! Great decision parent! I’m expert don’t think viruses change entire structure still virus sure directly related, someone autoimmune condition, bug bits ridiculously large get feel like take forever leave. may possible post Covid, person’s immune system isn’t strong prior manage things like yet? Good. That's weird. Drummers usually like needles. That's I'm saying. I'm saying states, maybe facilities, require ID still administer vaccine refuse fill personal identification form. 30 employees among OR, WA ID. know true based experience employees. Avoid reposting information, please.  question. thought sub full smart people. many unvaccinated people per 100k got covid?  would work great homeless. average FDA approval taking 12 years would say rushed. Probably nothing dont already know - government confident enough vaccine approve yet maybe shouldnt confident enough require everyone get find comments really brighten day, taking news. nice see encouraging people be. main vaccines used China right similar efficacy J&amp;J AstraZeneca. They're effective mRNA vaccines (a high standard meet), they're still highly effective preventing serious disease Zero cases impossible

It's possible country time. sporadic outbreaks, mostly localized (so far) quelled within weeks. country zero virus prevalence time. already this... True public safety demands transparency due high transmission rates covid. 
They defined “exposure” impossible meet terms could avoid pay teachers quarantining notifying parents. shady fuck hid behind hipaa. 

Parents voluntarily notifying school kid positive test one would told, even teacher unless parent reached directly them. 

If teacher hear directly parent, couldn’t say anything anyone else, team teachers students parents. 
We many cases. entire department staff covid one official notification exposure. 9 adults work office covid within three week period. Yet didn’t consider exposed other. 

I coworker text tell covid spent afternoon working space (masked) lunch six feet apart reported it, told wasn’t exposure, keep keep serving students usual. (I’m speech therapist.)

Basically ignored situation magically never single full class admin office exposed needed quarantine, let tell you, many staff tried keep safety measures place best possible kids adults aren’t perfect way measures followed perfectly every single instance possible exposure (obviously since entire grade level would swathe students staff disappear weeks come back).

Ok rant over, get chest. 
TLDR: districts ignored covid. sucks involved. shady af Yeah, need survey tell us already figured months ago. July time outdoors UK. Wait winter. Oh god, lost mine 3X stationed Germany .  Meanwhile, ust read story said reason vaccinated folks spread virus get sick virus prefers multiply nose; that’s main point entry well. antibodies don’t really detect there; react spreads lungs throat.

So say people noses hanging out, “Did know virus enters body nose, replicates there? That’s non mask wearers get sick.” i.e. ""Chin Diapers""

Was grocery store last night checkout clerk chin diapered True! meant ""where time go? feel old?"" type way. really, comment thread Offspring surprise apparently dad music now. 😫 general rule life typically simple - white rich folks better off. true investing money well taking care health. reasons skeptical data: first high 15% positivity rate implying testing finding cases R value accurate. also, still 1. dipping significant period time yet.

That mean can't rounding corner, means there's enough data say are.

We expect massive drop infection Delta burned population Missouri's getting closer point every day. people get yearly flu shots? flu shot much worse dose 1 Moderna (I felt bad next day mild fever), get every year. basically guaranteed 2 days fever, exhaustion, body aches, protects everyone around (I work babies children.) I'm sure dose 2 going knock down, that's even something consider getting preventative medical care. school system mandating masks students staff except PE class asking school board they’re managing lunchtime considering packed maskless 130 6th grader - lack answer means one even thought cafeteria.

My school district basically away online schools (because governor pulled funding them) banned mask mandates, we're fully own. would love live somewhere school system least try something protect kids.

As far vaccination statistics, back napkin math zip code around 58% fully vaccinated (not counting eligible people, 65% entire county zip code) include people first doses number we're 79% least partially vaccinated entire population. idea age demographics terms 0-11 vs 12-18 know 8% people 18 fully vaccinated county.

That said, think we've done pretty good job community inside Texas numbers, school starts back couple weeks expect lot kids going get sick going wreak havoc anyway since kids fully unprotected. kids wear masks full permission handle bullies however feel necessary people mess wearing masks, that's still enough. large portion sub children.

The vast majority website falls 14-18 range. course are. OR, WA ID *required* give photo ID complete personal information form. decline. stupid thing say I'm lying about. would incentive? I'm speaking experience. Hey, can't count, everything countless.... Zero CoVID far better economy strategy. requires short, intense periods mobilization quell outbreaks, outbreaks, long stretches normalcy, people businesses face basically restrictions. Additionally, outbreaks localized one cities, people country unaffected them.

Over past year, CoVID-19 placed far smaller burden Chinese society countries, present.

The main people impacted zero-CoVID strategy people want travel internationally. go 3-week quarantine get repeatedly tested order get China. stay country, almost CoVID-19 exist.

My point is, least Florida, un-vaccinated maskless public, catch Delta variant. May odds ever favor. unvaccinated people 3 times likely become infected.


And practically 99% hospitalizations deaths unvaccinated.



Seems like easy, simple decision get vaccinated. personally would cool everything except brain fog work medical setting. still wearing daily lots customers walking around fellow employees. find masks take away enough persons fave I, 1: Often think someone MIGHT someone know(but wrong) 2: often unsure reverse actual person. really make anonymous pay close attention figure whos who. parent children young get vaccinated, keep kids safe school requiring masks?

There simply room school system keep children six feet apart, basically going back pre-covid classroom setting. ""Community COVID Conversations"" something behold. read happen first two weeks chances clear good  Yeah... Colorado... One state.. 49 states.. dummy.. include countries world..

East Asian countries, like Vietnam, similarly well China followed similar strategies China. (Vietnam slipped prevent resurgence summer, well last year.) 90% number came ""actual"" chances. comparison.  come play .. Yes, 1/25th times whatever chance unvaccinated people. 

Remember though, tell actual chance, would depend unvaccinated person's chance tons different variables go that. unvaccinated people exposed virus everyone exposed virus contracts it. Stop reading news go enjoy day. You’re vaccinated. patient bring gun, they’re denied service ER due covid patients clogging system, could see holding doctors nurses hostage get treated “elective” issues. They're really sure part vaccines cause GBS. mil standard vaccines required go Africa holiday one triggered it. pretty bad; intubated. think something flu vaccines, recently I've read J&amp;J vaccine GBS warning, overall big ?. Mil took pfizer ill side effects. Handled better tbh, lol... 

So long, something vaccine triggers GBS, covid get sweet sweet oil though? Seems like US colonized Iraq short time extract much.  goal posts moving, ball is. goal keep virus manageable level. Due delta, spreading quickly. ball therefore gets goal. Yes, except covid going go away anytime soon, discussing go living next years. Health officials aren’t telling sick people wear masks, they’re asking everyone wear them, Asia argument place here. hope it’s clearer now. think basically multiple new strain every year flu. Thats get flu shots year months determine dominant flu strain year. fingerprints DNA past pandemics seemed select specific human polymorphisms (like ccr5Δ32). pandemics many people died change genome overcome pathogen. personally think age greed, since decisions avoiding short-term pain better long-term appear stem economic concerns. 

It's hard take anything seriously politicians experts there's zero talk preventing offices forcing people back unnecessary risk entire shit-show come September.

SOME argument made kids school, essential worker, etc., year working home, WFH slam dunk, easy-to-avoid, already works (better, many cases) de facto stance. 

The fact Cuomo, instance, said last week, something effect of, ""I think offices NYC mandate return Labor Day city cannot withstand even 15% decline occupancy."" 

Which thought, ""Well, game over, man..."" Cause even law firms Manhattan giving one two flex days. right 20% everyone appears everyone least one day week minimum. already know pain coming based DECADES short-sightedness part employers, lack investment transit, gradual increase bandwidth, pandemic forced WFH once, take damned high road urge caution... avoid pain may lead *assured* economic destruction. 

But larger point Governor state first American COVID epicenter saying everyone take chin, get back onto crowded trains buses, go back petri dish stairwells Penn get trains, go office sit DAY possibly poor ventilation, go home fret whether kids get school, like... we've already lost plot. We'd ground stand kids government took stand unnecessary bs (getting vaxxed big one) offices mandating return work big one. 

What, instance, parents kids forced stay home quarantine? legal protections there? say we're taking seriously someone get fired what's right themselves, family, community? Indeed. Guangzhou, Nanjing places. Anhui, Chongqing many places breaches. I'm glad raised point - article [linked days (non-peer reviewed) couple people raised issues assumptions within paper. 

The 1/5000 number comes Israel - reviewed see they've updated it, tend trust CDC since health system monitoring-focused. fairly good data.

Even COVID worse (and believe is), variable taking precautions simply cannot vaccines. Masks, social distancing, staying safe - one family got COVID antibodies received vaccine took seriously start, *and* got lucky. guaranteed get COVID, especially young 20-something year old working home.

I generalized everyone, someone family dead set vaccinating kid better alternative approved. acknowledge risky, can't bear think giving kid heart inflammation there's little data virus affects kids anyway. course they're battling fact kids school, even manage keep masks on, they're interacting others inevitably anyway.

I'm fully vaccinated - got first week can. I'd probably still done knowing know (I high risk group) incredibly stupid they're pushing Pfizer/Moderna know there's link. flu vaccine linked GB safe, produced today FDA approved it.

""A New England Journal Medicine study yesterday details breakthrough COVID-19 infections 39 1,497 fully vaccinated Israeli healthcare workers, cases mild moderate 19% symptoms lingering 6 weeks""

source: take chances get vaccinated since means ~7.5 people ~1500 experiencing long covid. unvaccinated sample population would way infections many experiencing lasting symptoms. disclaimer, regarding alpha. honestly youre vaccinated wouldnt worried delta unless really shit immune system. looking like going get covid point, vaccinated help survive first encounter body produce antibodies naturally well. thought dangling mask carrot would help. 

They grossly overestimated massive bad faith antivaxers. It’s inaccurate, it’s racist. “Model foreigners” misrepresent culture. US didnt 100,000 case covid day november 2020. already 4 past couple weeks including 285,000 last two days combined. coming fall winter going wild fauci’s fears come true, can’t imagine numbers end looking like friend’s GF woke fever today Tampa. Next appointment could find Saturday. No, predecessor.

It hasn’t outright stated, FEMA taskings federal healthcare workers (HHS, DoD, IHS) ever areas mask mandates place, case Texas, Louisiana, North Dakota mandates came hours announcement pending deployment federal healthcare workers.

I ton friends deployed teams past 18 months, never much press first crews hospital ships (which quickly disembarked doctors nurses local hospitals much useable). Thank everything help people, I'm sorry things bad. lots thieves robbers lol comment FB post NYC mask mandate week. ""People still aborting babies. government worried that?"" 

Like, okay abortion okay easily spreadable virus kids getting plus unvaccinated people? So, mothers right abort unborn child health. right spread virus unvaccinated people? Including kids? organization, like CDC, one job - utterly failed it. ineffective political pandemic longer trust anything. saw news clip blaming Biden new cases coming southern border... concerned lives Floridians governor? still answered question. flu kills lot people annually killed people course history covid. covid vaccine matters, criteria included pass? It’s don’t think. don’t know. thought delta supposed satan reincarnated covid.. happened that?.. nobody scared delta fear mongering must proceed.. let's get 1 solid antiviral together here.. early intervention primary goal vaccines.. whole dog pony show ends antiviral Yes that's mask sick Asia. literally advocating mask **WHEN ACTIVELY SICK** entire point. makes better plague rat. People went jail lead water pipes Flint, Michigan. law knows deal leaders ignore right wrong. fanatics jailed someone 3 5 years accidentally voting wrong one time. Lock throw away key. someone told magic button could press, year 3 kids die car crashes, would press it?

What instead button $20 per year extra taxes? spending 60 minutes pulling lever?

Don't compare slight inconvenience getting vaccinated banning cars. They're even plane existence. definitely need crazy system that, live Europe shootings around here. Absolutely.

Getting social media learning offline without lonely good thing. 

When kids eligible get vaccinated taking camping trips first time since kid.
 
Taking time away stress others try recover sense like OK... totally worth &amp; would highly recommend. know turned political thing. sense stupidity winds hurting us creating new variants worry about. protecting protects us well. I'm one guy Florida renounced republican party affiliation November. loathe trump sycophants. I'll never vote another republican life. Well damn. I'm Florida make decision let kids go back school week isolating 18 months. article throws edge. Delta variant affecting younger kids contagious. psychopathic governor playing politics kids life allowing school districts mandate mask wearing. decision sent wife panic attack, thought stroking heart attack. spent 8 hours ER/COVID central. Luckily stroke heart issues her. worst part experience saw numerous ER staff wearing masks. I'm damn sick living like this. Also let know Florida like, people still Trump parades regularly. real. Threatening people mask mandates keep children safe?



They're really going flip vaccines become mandated kids go school. yeah like going block piss seat getting you. lol Right. seen people freeway driving miles mask on.

Judging downvotes, guess entirely appropriate wear mask car. sub insane. Nice politics matters Children’s lives. Hate break you, germs everywhere even swim tub sanitizer. saying want go rub boogers people lick poles point you. discussing people wearing mask whilst sick. talk covid universal mask mandates. you’re talking separate issue. Yeah recently people arguing kids fine right. compare 2020 flu stats covid 18 under. GOP.

At least 20% noone loves due stupid abusive.  Thats really topic response handwashing low sure. covid wash hands unless literal shit them. Schools already shut due covid. Can't believe they're still going go person classes Even needs report complication x due covid. can't ignore it. animal shelters foreign concept you? remember months ago people raving ranting awesome Florida doing. said wait months. are. actually follow rules I’m trying fight believe in? wrong that? draw line injecting foreign substances body without knowing full effects it, mention it’s even approved almighty government entities (FDA). need apologize concerned self preservation?

What punishment exclaim? far know I’ve fairly content. Regarding harm others, follow pathetic rules mask wearing enclosed spaces public. think concerns myocarditis necessarily valid, considering [myocarditis likely COVID-19 vaccines. would better avoid altogether, think there's enough evidence happening result vaccines truly delay vaccinating under-12s virus clearly worse. said, know got 1/5000 number seen indication we're situation parents want vaccinate kids.

I seen polling indicate this. children 12 I'll board vaccinating soon possible. Understood thanks! I’m UK it’s still strictly one parent child’s appointment. Waiting covid results 2 year old. Needed right now. Tbh kinda expected MRA redditor enough balls something slightly inconveniences protect others. embarrassing grandma joins liberal conspiracy dying covid. /s test = problem covid = Florida Man I’m point exhaustion. vaxxed since May, fine wearing masks need to...I thought getting close. know trend going down, it’s nauseating. :/ Also two three massive concerts state 30,000 plus attendance past weekend.

Holy living fuck. disagree you. they're different things ways. Ideally I'd see treated (free) see US countries unfortunately Tell &lt;1% chance catching covid uncrowded outside conditions, even someone would rent from? 
Alternatives?

Where would get dog from? never even heard social etiquette. older millennial thing. dad smoker since teen years, quit around 4-5 years ago. He’s 60 now. dad still great risk chances recovering virus, if/when catches it? He’s currently unvaccinated. general maybe, July Florida hospital admissions Saturday day preceding week.

I think anyone making definitive statements topic next week data ""stable"", preliminary data look like new admissions decreasing. We'll see continues. damn right - nearly killed sister last summer still struggling recover, idea she'll able go back work. Nobody fucking making you.


Except there's global pandemic. God, dense? living fear want spread disgusting germs people now? Pig. adverse event vaccination manifests within weeks.

In fact, probably progress even better break, mental breakdown catching covid fuck time, energy, finances, health, perhaps long time.

People take break delay school kinds reasons: disability/illness, kid, indecision, lack funds, etc. Staying alive mentally healthy among best reasons take break.

One several reasons everyone still wear mask indoors public places. Sounds unconstitutional. They’ve already restored mask mandate without peep state. Depends definition ""Long haul"" is. Loads people every year get ""Long flu"" symptoms. Coughing months, able run far without getting tired etc, however, symptoms ignored people non problematic.

Also, 20% new cases Arkansas among children. 400 children died US far. Far larger number percentage adults serious side effects vaccines. schools open see lot children sick.

The main thing is, know virus finally get. ""long term"" studies original virus. longer exists. next one may twice chance causing death erectile dysfunction one does. better keeping alive current virus. That's works.

I doubt smart person mad skills areas. sound intelligent. However, judging relative risks may strong suit, least based covid arguments.

Good Luck you. Lambda first discovered United States August 2020 like 200 cumulative cases far today. would look testing place drive thru testing minimize potential exposure. 3-5 potential exposure recommended, 4 days sweet spot, according Dr. Daniel Griffin TWIV podcast last week. 

As tests, said antigen tests probably ideal test going forward previously vaccinated people show positive infectious amount virus present. 

Also, don’t count able find home antigen tests last minute. two days ago, couldn’t find anywhere visiting 4 different pharmacies area—they sold everywhere. pharmacists said weren’t expecting new shipments several weeks. today Amazon BinaxNow tests, didn’t available last night. supporters eating up. He’s going ride trail bodies White House.

Bad people smart too. heard radio every day year. South America general believes vaccines. Uruguay 72% total population less one dose 62% two. point spike protein turn itself? Someone please correct aren’t vaccines specifically targeting spike? mutates evade vaccines completely wouldn’t basically mean spike longer viable infection? looking potentially brand new strain? Need explained me.  point corporate America needs unified demand GOP expel crazy. stuff harms American business. also take insurance away fat people we’re it? seems obvious virus can't really propagate much 9 10 person antibodies (from vaccine previous infections) UK.

What get headline one wants admit accept UK (and way saw Netherlands) everyone agenda: media wants keep clicking (CNN lost 40% traffic Trump left office), Vaccine need sold, governments want get power (that whats built for) via coercion. us citizens world want continue signal virtue good mask wearer, wants reason blame hate people vaccinated yet.

And I'm saying vaccinated since April. clear evidence UK hole without lockdown shelter place, buti Think minority people willing accept People like ticking time bombs anyway. current world full media disinformation primed millions go berserk. can’t keep placating them. human shit stain Ted Cruz. Evil, shameless, craven, dumb. That's makes dangerous. charisma he'd even dangerous. Yeah map crap, almost western Virginia labeled metro makes absolutely sense couple months u take 4th shot?? Hmmm hope body handle toxins longer period time  Thank you.   Downvote person!!! Xey’re DOOMY enough!!!!! depends key in. protect this?  Nobody particular subreddit wants hear exact angle, think Delta variant - combined vaccines effectively defang Covid - ends highly dangerous phase pandemic quickly. Delta transmissible it’ll rip huge swath unvaccinated population (as it’s now). People seem think somehow delays end, many ways speeds up. It’s hugely dangerous suboptimal way end pandemic since vaccination would far effective safest route, soon US, like UK, 90% population antibodies kind immune system memory. happens, Covid still exist circulate it’ll kill relative rest pandemic. Covid becomes like 40th lethal killer, we’ll choice move on. Hang tight!

Edit: Concerns mutation obviously fair. Thinking globally (I mean, hell, Delta India likely emerged densely packed slums) remembering large animal reservoir make seem impossible ever dent viral evolution significant way. However, don’t know it’s wise assume it’s *likely,* though, see variant that’s fully evasive still super transmissible. continue hear it’s *possible,* also heard several immunologists explain elegant beauty vaccines make unlikely Covid would mutate way fully evades nature spike protein (without rendering harmless). 
As vaccine experts reminded people of:
•Vaccines polyclonal 
•CD8+ T-cells covering 52 epitopes across spike protein 
•CD4+ T-cells covering 23 epitopes across spike protein
(I recommend following @sailorrooscout Twitter, works vaccines explain better.)

And, thankfully, breakthrough doesn’t mean evasion vaccines aren’t think studies showed mothers giving antibodies child breastfeeding. course poses issue breastfeeding isnt possible. usually, harder get tested get results back weekend. Actually, read reply, also spread antivax disinformation. vaccinated person 50% vaxed state trying balance living “normal” life making effort get covid, feels pretty futile point. still wear mask indoors, I’ve come resent looks get hardly feel worth minimal protection provide one masked person 20 store…meanwhile unvaccinated took masks year ago. I’m tired best seemingly reason. Life goes on, bruh. La la life goes on. Great news! provide sources established information?   MIL lingering bronchitis like 5 months years ago. 6-8 consecutive weeks cold symptoms 2019. pulling stops make vaccines seem ineffective casual readers. think bar pretty high.

The cost keeping everyone uninfected vs cost limiting hospitalizations. It’s huge difference.

The goal covid fight might zero infections. Rather aim limit hospitalization.

We don’t zero infections policy influenza.
Kids get influenza don’t care much severe them.

There middle ground somewhere.
We never free viruses. cleared younger kids hope see big uptick vaccinations. 

School age children many vaccines required order attend school, need one too. cases, stairstep pattern kind strange.. not, live Tampa. Glad im vaccinated. forgot add Evangelical christians masks hold kid back? Give Delta gold medal Selfish idiots selfish, idiotic. 11. week ago posted US follows trend UK did, we'll around 88k cases per day week now. We'll peak around 250k near end August. personally think happen, commenting keep track.


Scary accurate I'm pretty worried we'll actually hit 250k month. easiest thing politically follow experts. they're right saved day, wrong blame them. There's really downside. don't, child make less qualified talk probabilities. child minscule probability suffering long term severe illness due COVID. According study King's College London, 

Fewer one 20 children symptomatic COVID-19 experienced symptoms lasting longer 4 weeks, almost children fully recovered 8 weeks, new study ""long covid"" symptoms mild even moderate symptoms improve. There's way guaranteeing child ill, way guaranteeing child gets flu suffer long term disability, Chronic Fatigue Symptom. reality parents accept anyone, child adult, lives moderately social existence future, get COVID. really way around problem, probability child getting long term severe illness miniscule. far risks 3 month year old baby long covid. Someone else provided couple paper citations said they’re “broadly similar”. 

Do know vaccine would effective **actual** virus going body?

Personally, I’m worried you’re right, since looks like even 100% vaccine coverage won’t get us herd immunity. Maybe we're talking document. Look ""confirmed case,"" ""suspected case"" ""asymptomatic infected persons"" [this document](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m_JX6xP21DYJ:www.chinacdc.cn/en/COVID19/202003/P020200323390496137554.pdf+). masking forever.

Wearing mask home top. way risk long flu long term effects viral infections.

Stop it. Covid flu. Long haul much common covid flu. stop. Considering current vaccines still offer efficacy ~70-80% infection (and even higher hospitalization death) Delta, overshot 50% mark significantly. vaccines really medical marvel. spent year severe depression COVID took huge toll mental health. getting vaccinated weeks ago, feel much safer. Guys, know things scary SOMEWHAT vaccine resistant variants coming left right. know incredibly protected vaccinated trust science absolutely kick shit majorly vaccine resistant variant targeted booster future. 

Keep living life trying find joy every day, knowing live time get highly effective vaccine year virus existing. resistant variant comes get ass kicked science.

STAY STRONG EVERYONE! People seem forgetting vaccine updates hard. Especially mRNA platforms, new formula could running less 2 months. imagine scenario world pretty good vaccine coverage crazy variant comes up, we'll probably +80% protection death vaccines would updated we'd get new shots, like flu. 

Not saying exactly what's going happen I'm sure fear-mongering helps anybody. know sometimes feel lile failure.... read shit like suddenly ithat feeling goes away. mean, means 3.4-3.6. clearly means he’s stupid… grade inflation big thing Ivy Leagues. Especially Harvard. 

In fact, least based recent years, that’s actually lower average grade. Almost 70% students 3.7 higher. think districts call Florida bluff make Florida defund them.

Then can’t pay employees shut say open state returns funds. office workers stayed home factories would lot safer sorry hear friend.

COVID POTS:  think provides strong argument providing immunocompromised people 3rd shot, give something close sterilizing immunity possible ensure virus little opportunity mutate possible? 

(Btw, clocked username previous comments, wanted mention I've really appreciating input general covid subs last weeks.) Delta looks less benign vanilla Covid. reports coming Louisana hospitals Delta causing severe cases kids vanilla did.

 Yes, can't make argument based percentage number cases kids. need different report it.

 Case point: Ontario numbers, roughly 20% population children:

 see, children Ontario overall represent 20% cases, 30% recent cases. tell us *anything* severity epidemic Ontario? No. anything, right kids overrepresented case numbers, vaccine available them. Good luck that. alone buddy. Stay safe. matter! get this. really fucked wish applaud anyones death, regardless cause not. people take vaccines still human beings treat such. die take vaccine, well demise, circumstance anybody laugh peoples unfortunate choices. Death thing laughed at. ""Rendered useless"" severe misunderstanding least mRNA vaccines concerned. vaccines target aspect fundamental fitting ACE2 receptor thus infectious.

Delta's reputation breakthrough (at rate that's still low, worrisome) much vaccine mismatch, viral load overwhelming.

Really need moving beyond supply constraints - last time going need rapidly produce administer mRNA vaccine globally.

It's important get availability everywhere, also get sufficient saturation early adopter countries demonstrate full population vaccination boosted depth actually solutuon - vs partial population vaccination, clearly demonstrated mitigation measure use concert masks distancing. California know Delta causing higher viral loads.

The headline taken seriously higher viral loads typically correlated sicker people. Delta cause people get sicker faster causing higher viral loads strains covid, would exception, norm. enough start warning people possibility there's concrete evidence take proper precautions spreading. 

Worst case scenario people keep ignoring precautions get sicker quicker. alternative take precautions help protect nothing happens. alternative much better worst case scenario. kinda comments coming purely theoretical ideal situation. would great could shut every human planet followed guidelines point alot us kinda done specifically vaccinated. likes limelight that's good trait person position. hope us covid-free vacinated folks similar situation future... Ironically, play amateur cover band (no Offspring songs though!) drummer get vaccinated either. Florida he's really political, he's scared. He's scared get vaccine, he's scared get covid.  rest us depends income music can't sequester. supportive tried get get jab, end day call.  Half people around us vaccine fatalistic current thinking is: going get exposed delta considering contagious is--I'm glad family vaccinated effects minimal.

His buddy bad dose covid well, buddy told wish worst enemy. evidence need, still it--just shaking head going concerned people ignorant. Realistically probably required whole time vaccination rates increase people shitty there's constant pressure remove mask mandates. Stay safe! alone!

But takes resource prospector indigenous person bring something back communities go there. great deal control Covid choose take correct steps. fucking high go? R naught 648484? think took vaccine actually protect harm? Lol got sick died. That's happened past. like happening ffs.  nature's way telling us there's fucking many you; slow down. framing textbook selfishness advice

Asking data isnt giving advice. Im sure going about.

As study, address delta variant I'm referring to. Israel study stopped collecting data back March. delta variant issue.

**Vaccinated People Breakthrough Infections Spread Delta Variant, CDC study details COVID-19 outbreak started July 3 Provincetown, Mass., involving 469 cases. found three-quarters cases occurred fully vaccinated people. Massachusetts high rate vaccination: 69% among eligible adults state time study.  viral loads suggest increased risk transmission raised concern that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected Delta transmit virus,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, CDC's director, said statement Friday.

I'll never understand people confident, little information. people praise science time, dont even keep it. They're awaiting ""further guidance""? obvious Florida worst COVID state US right every action taken slow down? high I’d hoped damn, need rapid antigen tests like everywhere one hand, makes sense. think issue *velocity* evolution seeing. Remember headlines said “viruses mutate PhD tells us good thing.”

It’s completely understandable didn’t conclusive evidence also believe take seriously. Yes, viruses mutates either prevent slow happening. Pretty sure CEO Pfizer said would take 3 months make new vaccine. don’t know includes testing considering takes days create mRNA vaccine genome sequence. still don’t see virus mutating enough spike cell virus least next years, mRNA vaccines train alert immune system look for. outbreak spread multiple cities 70-something infected people? thing simple; either Chinese officials suck contact tracing, don’t believe , underreport numbers comical fashion. STDs don’t cause global pandemics kill millions cause billions dollars damages. point things going happen world control over, what’s point fretting like people love do? wasn’t implying similarities events. wonder forever war happen pandemics past?

It actually - plague, smallpox cholera remained endemic centuries, radical changes technology society occurred, barely 100 years ago. Science kept deadly contagions bay century, run extremely adaptable virus one hand overwhelming human ignorance arrogance run miracles time being. tracks state level, much agree need way better tracking national global level breakthrough cases. 

I've irritated CDC's decisions lot pandemic, really damaged trust them. Defining breakthrough cases hospitalized cases, even opting track pretty absurd, damages trusts vaccines ask me. masks work well done right, established start pandemic. However impact masks binary, probabilistic based type mask, type environment, age, immunity level, sanitization, crowd sizes, number people infected, sadly dishonesty truly masking.  lockdowns, unless done properly, useless, issue lockdowns stop spread, course human interaction; rather issue human behavior compliance. Well ever dealt coronavirus pandemic? dealt flus. different really don’t know CDC's finding breakthrough cases, viral load vaccinated people unvaccinated people similar. key applies breakthrough cases. vast majority vaccinated people, infection asymptomatic, extremely low zero chance spreading people. 

The vaccine prevent 100% transmission, 90% prevention still lot better 0% definitely still slow spread overall. COVID-19 really opened eyes phenomenon

I never knew viruses could long lasting impacts country high vaccination status gone back lockdown? even worth reporting god  children infected COVID ICU's across country. So, yeah... getting sick. That’s awesome - go medical school?

I literally don’t even know begin ignorant uneducated comment. people used wear masks noses chin straps. 
I’ll keep wearing mine stores thank you. I’m still eating inside restaurants (but spent plenty take out). using wrong btw. apply rentals. Children getting COVID tragedy. continue get COVID suffer symptoms COVID future irrespective whether get vaccinated not. That's reality COVID. going go away. Countries cannot even vaccinate elderly due vaccine supply real tragedy. get medical advice Ron desantis /s Yep, sad see go waste. think legislatures need pass laws say something effect ""When doses 14 days away expired, shipped somewhere people actually use them"". Might even cause uptick vaccination rate, xenophobic assholes might take vaccine ensure go foreigner. it? hope it’s really behaving like flu mayor said restrictions don’t apply children 12 I'd rather live risk dying virus spend entire life fear lockdown social distancing. Let alone subjecting generations it. Sometimes quality life important quantity. never going go away. 

That's wrong, could stopped quick decisive lockdown. enough cases trace every contact. cases also means mutations highly unlikely spawn variants.

Only truly global tons virus reservoirs around world unlikely fully go away.

Very high vaccination rates may still lead quasi herd immunity transmission rates vaccinated people seems highly reduced even delta. UK never masks school Primary age children, i.e. under-11s. Scientifically really never much doubt here. Germany example, also EU countries, standard get mRNA shot 2nd AZ shot first. AZ JJ shots pretty similar principle.

My guess reach target, message change. far, they've relying willingness/desire population get vaccinated. strongest disincentive virtually CoVID-19 China, outbreaks like current one remind people virus still still dangerous. fact there’s endgame point what’s really scary me.

The vaccine looks like we’re gonna far 2022, possibly later. variants gonna never ending cycle.

I've read significant amount articles indicating higher hospitalizations children severe long term effects fatigue brain fog. sure familiar brain fog cancer patient am. child would get brainfog early years (&lt;2-3 years) would SEVERELY affect development.  Fully double-vaxxed here... Seriously, wear mask everywhere go make sure one mistakes Republican... Assuming you’re US. got vaccine back March April waited line like 30-45 minutes even though appt. Kroger pharmacy though believe packed bunch appts early morning went. vaccines first opened all. 

Now don’t think wait long places demand come significantly. would surprised took 15 minutes. 30 minutes max. usually fill short consent form. 

Sides effects normally harsher 2nd dose. First dose arm briefly tender. hardly issue. 2nd dose felt little fatigued, arm hurt quite bit, body aches day half. anecdote equate science. Also, playing Russian roulette virus like nonsensical. Problem: mutate vaccinated people 

Solution: None Alabama, obviously spiking, reported 32 statewide child hospitalizations Covid last week. It’s way crazy numbers. point say, “I’m 20 something underlying condition fully vaccinated, sorry I’m sacrificing years life make old sick people slightly lower chance getting virus 99% survival rate” going back enjoy life, maybe getting COVID getting it. mean, kinda control wife's pregnancy no? stupid argument.

Yes, germs spreading naturally fine. What's fine willingly wiping snot everywhere claiming that's thing. taking precautions *kill* infect makes disgusting person.

You *are* pig. Nothing change do. Yes, overall, plus tourists coming here. situations Florida UK equivalent metric. Well, trying say without getting comment removed… assume low vaccination countries much testing  Using verb ""ran"" pretty generous you. I'm definitely curious see data, can't imagine there's situation wearing properly fitted n95 equivalent type eye protection drastically reduce exposure common cold/flu shopping. Maybe. problem random mutation nothing certain. best case scenario worst. none really happened Florida, they’re comparable. 

Then would *you* mention Florida response someone praising UK did? UK highly unique far paid off. Singapore also something similar vaccination rates higher Israel's, hopefully, sharing success UK method. 21, 2020 feel friends still college. lucky able graduate 2019 missing nightmare accurate even funny. 

""I friend jumped parachute broke legs! another friend jumped without one and... he's well busy can't even bothered talk anymore, assume. really heard day? think peak near Florida. Like others said we'll see next days growth conts slow peak near. think 10 days national peak particular wave. Find Delta reinfecting someone severely Thousands people lifetime spread germs me. 

Some people wearing masks, wearing masks. good personal hygiene, good personal hygiene. germs make sick, won't.

None spread germs pigs, humans. Please dehumanize people. part sci-fi movie well-meaning scientist tries engineer ""less dangerous variant"" turn us zombies. yet Florida 1/5 active cases Well goes without saying 8mo old article alpha variant doesn’t seem relevant delta circulating. DeSantis bad enough, people critically think crap spews, far worse imo. blindly accept whatever says without question. 

I could never live willful ignorance. 

These people would first go zombie apocalypse theur favored governor says exist. tell statistics disagree beliefs wrong, made up, get parents are. published report week ago saying Pfizer 39% effective preventing infection delta

From horse's probably seen reports Israel low vaccine effectiveness wave. Delta? Waning immunity? think reason mostly got denominator needs publish data I'll take anything say seriously considering published data used wrong dataset denominator. - it’ll get point done everything possibly help look everyone else. matter happiness.

If it’s absolutely hopeless, live fear anymore move life. I’m hoping it’ll never get point end pandemic next year together. individual cohorts taking necessary precautions doctors recommend them. never went around worrying would die flu, grandma lung cancer. want flu? No. wash hands going bathroom? Yes. wear mask grocery store? No. go grimy dive bars crammed people? Yes. grandma that? No. 

Also, ""can"", yes. Likely, could win lottery tomorrow, one stocks I'm invested could become major success. I'm planning life around possibility, happens reassess live. easy enough get vaccine take long. go local pharmacy ask. 

As symptoms could bad case chills feeling awful, absolutely nothing. pretty much symptoms besides tired. could easily disguise symptoms feeling well. take pain killers afterwards help it. #there nothing show unvaccinated people brought COVID event. wife year infection closed window car (then infectious) father antimasker 2 days drove across country. Neither us got sick. 

So take rushed emergency vaccine equivalent

Then stop equating Long covid, itself, worse viral syndromes

You say they're equivalent say they're thing. Congrats least credible person internet today. Makes sense since kids can't get vaccinated. links studies lol 20%... I'm South *maybe* 5% since mandate dropped schools refusing require all. absolutely maddening. large part big box stores want employees police enforce masking. Many police departments even democratic cities said enforce mask mandates longer. means 15 dollar hour (or worst) employees putting health line. Workers literally killed trying enforce masks stores. I’m you. Got long covid. Bed bound 1.5 years. 

I say, learn survive. it’s do. Yea told sister quit nursing job ruins family. winning right unfortunately someone vaccinated, long immune for? like flu go every year? I'm still wearing mask regardless, I'm sure immunity runs out. Thank wisdom, Raccoon\_Full\_of\_Cum. I'm exiting things I've read going take educated guess: think chickenpox mutates fast enough ever exceed body's ability produce new antibodies sees again. start getting older, experience kind immune deficiency later on. get shingles, latent viral chickenpox particles reactivate nerve cells get painful rash. happens frequency elderly.

The often said vaccination, many vaccines need boosters. Tetanus, instance, requires booster every 10 years so. I'm sure that's product bacterium causes it, matter immune system. think anyone knows happen Covid vaccines, except know people original SARS still immunity 18 years later, experienced better outcomes Covid infections. really wish politicians would humanize doctors nurses regular people get tired over-working. tell public take precautions hospitals get overwhelmed. 

Instead, politicians treat doctors nurses comic book super-heroes. demand public party go festivals without masks. stopping variants happening.

We can't bring chance variants zero, drastically decrease likelihood vaccinating many people possible, especially third world countries.

Although I'm still pretty scared animal kingdom cooking us. Climate change human encroachment bringing animals humans closer together, thus creating opportunities type diseases. we've done FUCK curb China's wetmarkets disgusting stuff animals. someone vaccinated, long immune for? like flu go every year? I'm still wearing mask regardless, I'm sure immunity runs out.  still try, it’s become social faux pas talk much vaccine. It’s little frustrating. try level headed debate unvaccinated person, people (often vaccinated) come try end conversation “everyone entitled choice” try immediately change topic.

I get we’re sick talking it, won’t make go away. coddling unvaccinated people placating choices won’t help much either. 

I sincerely don’t want see people around get sick. Otherwise I’d content sit conversation too. I'm asking, sort of? see letting guard masking numbers low enough again, also intend wear one indefinite future every flu/cold season I'm grocery shopping. I've caught cold/flu damn many times Walmart take amount help get. You’re talking circles without ever answering questions. Thanks.

However, guns serve strong deterrance.

Without guns, US military could easily dispose serious rebellions quickly without significant infrastructure damage.

With guns, however, Military needs support would destroy large portions American infrastructure. can't go on-foot kill 50 million armed Americans. would need missiles, air support, etc. so.

I still think misleading tell people crush outbreak country, somehow prevent vaccine-escape variant emerging. Mutations happen randomly (and always places high transmission) there's nothing one country stopping them: Vietnam spared Delta kept COVID 2020.

If virus crushed everywhere world -- humans getting it, animal reservoirs -- then, yeah, escape variant never happen. that, ending outbreak ending outbreak, stopping variants happening. Already Delta Gamma first-generation VOC's, whose parents B.1 (the original+D614G) closely related lineage. idea second-generation VOC would look like, one. religious Tokyo proper 13 million people metro area like 35. Tokyo huge, substantially bigger NYC.  Anyone follow train thought likely already vaccinated. Still makes absolutely difference anecdote arguing makes look like fool. Fuck. Protecting vulnerable means raising vaccination rates 70% eligible adult population higher; meantime, things like masking vaccine mandates NPIs helpful.  efficacy mRNA vaccines didn’t go trials delta variant. wasn’t target. fact provided high levels protection definite plus. 

So whether booster simply third shot provided before, new shot vaccine also designed tested delta variant becomes question mind.

Additionally, asking moritorium boosters people chance get least single dose. US’s responsibility permanently send vaccinations poorer countries though long term question think become contentious line. I’ll curious debate goes. I'm sorry, can't imagine anxiety he's creating you. well, virus definite adapting evolving, unlike humans lol. ""natural herd immunity"" thing crazy, disease eradicated infecting ourselves. Wonder kind airline miles get this…


Seriously tho, get vaccinated already know people get breakthrough infections don’t go get advanced disease requiring hospitalization, susceptible long COVID,” Fauci said. “You’re exempt long COVID get breakthrough infection.”

Exactly refused go back office data this. Luckily boss understanding.  think thorough article containing facts logical person comprehend would sell advertising? Everyone vaccinated get eventually. Lmao “assholes”. sound emotional. see, work government explains don’t understand what’s happening. I’m really saying trust public health officials anymore amongst unvaccinated. also makes sense don’t mask anything recommended. first say “If vaccine don’t need mask” breakthrough cases, vaccinated people need mask, evidence come next showing wrong again? I’m antivax, vaccines think you’re dumb don’t get vaccine, you’re also dumb don’t see understand incompetency entire pandemic handled government public health officials. cdc says wait 6 weeks dose previous brand available.

That's CDC want mixing all, want wait long supply become available brand. Look US sec. Vaccinations stopped months baecause infections decreased likely due weather. infections hospitalisations rising again, people staritng rush vaccines again

People tend reactive rather pro-active unfortunately. way get bother vaccinating fear Lambda already exists US beaten Delta yet. odds stay same, number mutations increase. meanwhile india held mass gathering rallys presidente election...unvaxxed... used major urban/rural divide this. many issues topics. Mask usage high closer Dallas San Antonio Austin. go thirty minutes outside places like Terrell Boerne Bastrop spotty best; head hills places like Brady Brownwood Mexia Ozona practically non-existent. 
 
And mandates pre-vaccine Texans falling dead left right. 
 
Nowadays, pretty much everyone forgone mask Texas - urban rural. cities, still using - would estimate something like 30% best. Anywhere outside city, signs scratched doors, there's rarely mask sight more. 
 
Not crazy - I'm still wearing mask regardless I'm one QT 7-11 wearing one. that's reality people now, think there's much anything able move needle one way point. People hard-set opinions, like political divide there's almost ""middle ground"", ""swayable"" moderates.  
 
And much shame turned way, everything handled better beginning early 2020, hard set group people everything. like go back change various federal officials governors reacted poorly past. Bah. really worst timeline. meant count asymptomatic cases total cases. I've quit trying predict things. answer you, yes keep voting Republican. Republican party leader incited attack country still vote them. Nothing stop it. Lambda also misses production facilities coming line globally, like South Africa I'll explain wrong one else 


Your risk constant matter population. 1/25 means expose, 1/25 vax people suffer severe illness. 25000 vax people exposed, 1000 would suffer. point would vax equivalent unvax terms risk. many? core fault ""personal responsibility"" ethos. Sooo… maybe people get vaxed? Newsflash: scientists governments don’t decide herd immunity comes, virus does. Media making much money fear mongering. context removed. good, reason gives schools employers cover put vaccine mandates place. legally allowed now, balls dropped enough brave.  


Ironically, I'm one LOVES working home I'd longer excuse everyone shitty open office plan vaccinated...but that's selfish.  


It interesting see quits ever happened (my employer requiring vaccines); probably simply Florida -- state government side masks vaccines, go great effort them. effort could used good... Seems bit non article, mostly vaccination anyway. vaccinated adult always wears mask avoids crowds still, confirm. either understand masks work, viruses inhaled exhaled little nosey nose, want spread COVID dose dastardly Dems hurt poor Tronald Dump, cerebral cortex connect rest brain. end? Oh man. hate hypocrites bet get hulk level rage see people positions power telling us wear masks stay home then….not that….lol. 


How define proven work? work mean masks lockdowns again? study showing vaccinated getting delta spreading it? (Massachusetts refer CDC website) study prompted CDC recommend masks vaccinated again. thought one main points vaccine limit transmission would turn limit spread possibility mutation. one vaccinated countries world contemplating lockdowns? (Israel)

Is possible we’re still new don’t know f going on? think people mentally exhausted they’re looking someone something blame. We’re still figuring comfortable patient.

Can provide information one doesn’t use technology? Boosters nightmare. pro-vax begin take them. rest country that's hesitant unwilling never take them. Even thought wasn’t meant. Dude relax downvote. everyone agree you. 
I stop taking people online serious long time ago told unvaccinated *parent little kids* work wear masks protect children- children, mine- looked like beamed Mars.

What hard concept making small sacrifices help many people?? Every kid (I hope) someone's dearly loved child. People need find somewhere sympathy someone, anyone, *other themselves* get this. cancelled large party? can't tell appreciative change mind, outraged caved public. Agreed! Enjoy freedom xx Wait seriously? want third dose doctors able give without much fuss?? relate unvaccinated people wearing masks vaccinated people still wearing masks.  Tokyo big city. Exactly. control much vaccine spread around world - kills less Flu


Yes, also infects much chickenpox now. kids died covid bad flu year 2020. year already heightened awareness sickness. that’s start counting bad reactions. wasn’t. planned months ago different trajectory. would tone-deaf went it. right thing. People think China's covid numbers suspect, still true, completely ignore stuff like China's response. it’s pretty remarkable compare deaths wave previous ones. Despite caseloads approaching levels seen last major wave, deaths much lower. makes feel like I’m surrounded backwood idiots seeing majority state splotched red, brown, pink, orange two light greens 6 counties away. asked take shoes airport tyranny!!! 

I tread carpet wearing socks, sir!!! yet science still shows without vaccinations still less likely wearing masks. telling anti vax crowd listening scientists one specific time? Also I'm disease intervention specialist government. following since December 2019. incompetence USA school system failing many people. get it, never submitted paper.to academic journal idea epidemiology science works yet given blowhorn via internet showcase off. Yes get it. move now. Maybe would responded better commented form question. think also detracts individuals cannot get vaccine. specific medical reason, opinion state it. doesn’t want that’s prerogative many hospitalizations? Deaths? Case numbers moot. vast majority kids symptoms mild symptoms. say sky falling anyone else mild cold-like symptoms. measures taken done reduce number people going hospital dying. Kids never major risk category. ""Medical science and/or technology supplanted natural selection persons positions responsibility and/or authority stupid merely three hundred years ago, would eaten something way outhouse."" Assuming got vaccines Walgreen's, go tell lost card, surely system. situations HIPAA/FERPA overlap (nurses office example) outside agreed. don’t know drives crazy, also cannot stand people say “ATM machine” soooo that.  would help though? Isn’t like eating people another country hungry? It’s like skip vaccine magically appears elsewhere. Wouldn’t better get vaccinated donate organizations working vaccine distribution?  don’t care. Politicians front line. way back mansions laughing us Yeah, would happened variant. clear breakthrough cases happening efficacy vaccine wearing immune escape abilities Delta. Need authorize boosters ASAP tragedy. cannot believe timeline. Totally preventable. reasonable explanation 18 months still people legitimately don’t know

I think people paying attention COVID news all. hear little bit friends. Maybe see mask signs. might even aware mask mandates removed.

Of course, flip side craziness: person driving car freeway, mask on. Unfortunately, plenty people traditional ""Republican voters"" buy lot bullshit around COVID vaccines. lot people also resent anyone telling do, even clearly best interest.

They're ignorant selfish impulses, frankly, playing bad way gain support raise profile. Especially cast ""supporting individual freedom."" can't even count many medical offices, dentists, doctors, surgeons I've last month medical staff refused wear masks, wore chins even cases earrings, patients refused completely welcomed in, sit next cancer patients, injured, sick, children, people connected oxygen tanks.  


If want over, mandated vaccinations else always cultist conspiracy guys directing long variants keep mutating COVID keeps running roughshod US population people keep dying, going bankrupt hospital bills, getting ""long COVID"" suffering pandemic. Employers need stand up, look pandemic costing financially efficiency, make staff get vaccinated pay fines look elsewhere work federal government needs realize playing paddycake opposing party result changing course institute mandates.

And sky blue, science real, viruses spread inhaling particles telepathy sorcery, masks work cover nose mouth, secret tracking devices hidden liquid vaccines.

End screed. public rational educated body Well wrong pretty fucked right Florida leading way. [More 800 UConn students seek vaccination UConn said granted 55 requests medical exemptions vaccine policy 504 requests non-medical exemptions. Another 267 requests, non-medical reasons, remain review, school said.

I wonder constitutes valid non-medical exemption vaccination....

**Edit:** Someone postulated might granted anyone requests, basically, long agree weekly testing arrival quarantines, policy unvaccinated. idea exemption ""because wanna"" international student arriving access vaccine home country wait get vaccinated. “Hey Hey I’ve got anti-bodies!” I’m glad someone said it. graduated Yale 2001 B.A. magna cum laude history.[11] spent year history teacher Darlington School.[12] DeSantis attended Harvard Law School, graduating 2005 Juris Doctor cum laude.[13][14]

i dunno man, cum laude harvard law? get saying, gotta assume man smart. likely sociopath. kids get chance get vaccinated truly shit. job reinstated mask mandate employees gladly comply annoying feels like last year nothing. Obviously prevent shit load people dying go seems. 

But yeah, vaccinate kids ready tune out. care hear idiots finding idiots hard way more.  mean yes could also get another bad illness die it, probably won’t. Yep. US. Everyone know gotten Pfizer said scheduled 2 weeks out. 1 person 10 days. expressed concern told one seems care. Yeah, Wednesday tends worst day week cases, long days less time last week seven day average drop. found killing voting blocks political statement might bad idea think continue make numbers before. aggression stand.... Man. last post I’ll make day: everybody’s thoughts Walensky saying last week we’re variants away vaccine resistant strain? Try state health department Agreed. People riot we’re supposed get boosters, Delta hitting first get vaccinated (who also vulnerable) told we’re donating supply I'm seeing seeing graph. Let's talk week. Every hospital, school, government exists business. People work get paid work. Nonprofits businesses well. selling drugs man wow 99/100 people knew college sold something. isn’t surprising hasn’t really long term study melatonin. Melatonin rather new dosage frequency humans consuming Nice try officer Tbh I’m 9th dose, feel fucking unreal!  Hey guys, I'm going NYC mid september Mexico, see they're basically gonna asking proof vaccination everywhere, could mexican proof vaccination good? get J&amp;J soon arrive let places? Organ transplant patients get vaccine. far know cancer patients. 

Source: fully vaccinated + booster I’ve double lung transplant think things die bit current wave we're in, surprised see another surge later fall winter people gather indoors. declining efficacy time? It’s 6 months since vaxxed I’ve seen reports could start wearing off. Still boosters available.   flood risk, fire risk, burglary risk, government forcing sell home can't job properly injustice vaccinated, yes since they're likely get mild cold flu-like symptoms get it. unvaccinated, even close! LOL, aint real scientist medicine. sell shelf products hand people medicine. need get job like high school diploma GED maybe retail experience.

I interviewed fucking Wallgreens cashier went really well yet zero experience comes medicine science courses taken involves studying planet rather medicine. Got 7 anthrax shots, never problem minus sore arm (which last one pretty awful, unusual). also know many others got time mandatory time everyone. 0 issues, still keep touch many.

I've also gotten Smallpox, Yellow Fever, knows else.

I understand shots problem, COVID vaccine? That's far folks. Sorry, that's true, used adverse there. edited comment. Guillain-Barré Syndrome joke. body cannot handle vaccines. He's antivaxxer actually said he's pro-vaccines.  Seems harsh. people waitlists remaining vaccines? Austrailia exactly position wasting doses... Thats kind frightening thats best 21st century, accept humans get infected. next pandemic 10% fatality rate instead 1% rate? don’t talk Antibody dependent Enhancement (ADE). suggest looking getting well.

Further, vaccination rate US indeed 70% now, combine another chunk individuals natural immunity getting actual virus, seeing massive spike cases. Historical data herd immunity 60-80%. well within upper limit target range, still transmissible herd immunity, way see exponential increases cases we’re seeing vaccinations truly effective they’re saying.  CI including Alpha Delta generalized efficacy number, yes. data collected Delta-dominant setting, Delta specifically mind like Singapore Israeli data was. question you. Say 2 months now, New York decides need booster shot J&amp;J order considered ""fully vaccinated."" carries important consequences let's say need ""fully vaccinated"" certification important things like eat restaurants, visit DMV, go hospital, etc.

But problem already got second shot MA. Let's say state bureaucracy makes hard use shot count second shot. now? go ahead take another shot NY (this would third)?

Sorry long question legit fear happen try get second shot boost J&amp;J. complicated curvature earth, agree.  Guillain-Barré Syndrome legitimately cannot get vaccine. feel bad him. rely rest us unfortunately stupid antivaxxers put people like risk. rule help?  Everyone UK uses Jab instead Shot isn’t excessive burden healthcare system. Since compromised immune system, correct I'm wrong, feel antivaxx crowd shits folks says putting risk say, gathering baseball game anyway, want get vaccine? PISSES OFF.  statement reads like every anti vaxxer. medical concern moron.

Dunno anti vaxxers song dance nobody believes them. along coworkers multi-branch multi-rank environment vaccinated since March, thanks.

Though yes, I'd agree lingering irritating. One even got COVID couple months later, facepalm hard enough.

I can't wait mandatory get holdouts taken care of. anyone explain downvotes? kind stop flu virus, flu diagnosis 99% season vs last season. Depends whether 1/25 risk exposure infection. Ah see. Lucked good thing well then. I’ll take lucky win days. lot larger sample CI pretty narrow. Ugh. October far away. want 9yo get vaccinated soon possible since there’s mask mandate anymore (her school still month starts haven’t mandated yet, 100% lunch person, didn’t last year…) 
Most Yankees did, yes. heard couple got Moderna, might coaches. weird all, I'm Richmond. I'm anyway saying covid Virginia life pretty much back normal.

The correlation vaccination beliefs 0.85 come people ""doing research"" wont want injected weird new shit. 

There nothing new weird point, hundreds millions people vaxed, year. studies mRNA vaccination ongoing 20 would like people would stop trying force vaccinations.

I would like cops stop trying arrest getting drunk driving home. really spoils buzz. However, enjoying nice driver dozen beers public interest puts people's lives risk. Globally think 2 billion vaccines administered. info wrong I'm open corrected. 

But 8 billion people earth, many eligible vaccine (I assume 6.5 billion maybe), many actually vaccinated fully?

Vaccinations barely started administered Africa. Theres lot opportunities virus mutate something worse.  You’re Ken Jennings, babe I'm CVS cashier Delta Plus sequenced hundred cases worldwide. Let's get far ahead story. study, results expected week so. FDA approved shit. run tons experiments military excuse approval rushed. like say trials rushed. (Which weren't, required steps occurred throwing billion dollars problem eliminated lot time). I'm good MMR like 500 years. easy fake difficult prove fake. mean UK following delayed second dose strategy, decided one dose two dose vaccine ineffective delta. Yep.
Real estate become insane since. 

I bought house right started. ( pry dead hands) we've "" made"" 60 grand. year. updates, weird decorating (awesome) would probably decrease value world open concept grey.

Our old house lacking except landscaping bought 80's 60 grand sold early 2000's 220. thought quite windfall time. Meaning concluded prior Delta becoming dominant. vast majority data would way that.  places far less vaccination rates compared rest country. referring states near national average vaccine rate California. made realize... proof vaccination stuff work future businesses making push it? live outside country right although getting vaccinated, getting done vaccine centers. hand proof vaccinations like current country residence. get revaccinated completely return US? hand one lose paper card what? hate dissenter US government, along local governments sort pushing without discussion really work international level. dine restaurants, go gyms future etc return without get revaccinated back states? Cause gotta get Christian vote, won’t get re-elected /s vaccine doesnt prevent catching disease worthless. UK study 14k cases showed almost exactly results. dated almost exactly date Delta ""officially"" became dominant UK. I’ve dealing fog low energy along anxiety(never prior covid) since late April got covid. It’s noticeable difference main reason got first vax shot today. oh Supreme Court Justice? talking butt? doctor told hold he’s increased GBS (and likely already covid antibodies). People sub gone insane. I’ve seen people suggesting people mix shots go vaccine clinics telling need second shot (even though got two) unauthorized “booster”. Bribing patients reward get specific medical treatment would considered HIGHLY unethical doctor it...just saying fully recover, like 100% remaining deficits?
If really good you.
I’d scared get vaccine anything may cause reoccurrence GBS ever it. expect do. average person probably 500 Facebook friends, many scattered around country.

I live outside Denver, rural area virtual option, masks optional district everyone. one kid school age cannot yet vaccinated, one kid vaccinated, 20 month old likely even vaccinated mid winter. older kids want keep toddler safe think options given bullshit, I. ordered homeschool curriculum today. I’m lucky enough able afford $2k, able put career hold another year, I’m freaking angry can’t. untenable situation it’s unacceptable. angry friends neighbors don’t options.  UK 3 month period shots people right? possible that's causing dip... three month gap shots gives stronger immunity response say 21 days shots. see papers? EUA process act surrogate approval BLA process moves slower pandemic. Even current former heads FDA say vaccine safe effective wait formal approval. cannot forgive student loans executive order, secretary education authorized congress. People sitting waiting Biden's pen work eyes wrong target, need contact congressional representative.

Now question actually paying seems fungible open interpretation, looks like could either hard cancel pile top national debt specifically allocate funding that's big deal. reason outbreak notable actually tested everyone...unlike general stats. appreciate misleading tone article. Eh, read writes goes way say supports people also getting vaccine, exclusively medical contraindication. 

It's somewhat sad regard; he's example need everybody get vaccinated - protect can't. get final approval, still mean still classified CICP VICP?  It’s liberating, people know still trying social distance mask still gotten sick, sounds opposite liberating Ya would’ve 100% gotten vaccine hadn’t already Covid mild level doctor said get it. I’m holding seeing suggests different it’s FDA. Fingers crossed data clear definitively get haha! think agreeing what’s happening. I’m saying what’s happening problem. Let guess involves pseudoscience medicine praying? Oh mistake then. Plus, discussion probably went something like “Dude, you’re likely get GBS actual coronavirus mRNA vaccine. you’re concerned GBS DEFINITELY need get vaccinated.”

“But doctor ok decision! can’t control me! choice mine make! Plus didn’t hear I’m concerned getting GBS?”

**Amid week maddening COVID-19 missteps, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott makes worst all**

Maybe shapeshifting virus exhaust us exhaust it. hope not.

Despite yearnings done it, we’re long-haul crisis COVID-19 — lot moving parts lots opportunities various individuals institutions prove winners losers battle.

Consider Centers Disease Control Prevention inability communicate clearly. agency simply must figure deliver coherent message — especially every unvaccinated person walking petri dish virus’ next variant.

The CDC’s latest fuzzy language around even vaccinated individuals resume mask-wearing provided anti-vax crowd easy “See, shot doesn’t work” soundbite.

My profession also deserves criticism recent coverage, particularly headlines (gasp!) proclaim “more 125,000 vaccinated individuals caught COVID.”

Indeed, “breakthrough” number high — higher — cases mild, less scary.

But 125,000 infections less one-tenth one percentage point 165 million fully vaccinated people.

Masked passengers walked security checkpoint Dallas Love Field airport Dallas recent morning.

The number deserves concern 93 million people U.S. eligible vaccine chosen get it, despite easily transmittable delta variant midst.

Then there’s Greg Abbott, might well running reelection slogan “worst governor since Pa Ferguson.”

Long gone Greg Abbott showed considerable political courage first months COVID. Fearful out-flanked right next year’s gubernatorial primary, must know wrong Texans desperately wants win another term.

Abbott’s latest misfire name opportunistic politics came late last week when, doubling personal responsibility mantra, issued sweeping executive order bans mask requirements governments public school systems outlaws vaccine requirements anyone receiving public funds.

The governor may sleeping better he’s repelled accusations two primary foes accuse government overreach. rest us, much.

Abbott tied hands every local leader Texas making best decisions serve.

Among affected North Texas sick vulnerable patients Parkland Memorial Hospital satellite clinics.

Parkland would much like follow lead many hospital systems across state made vaccines mandatory staff. all, people ill enough hospital bed greater risk acquiring COVID suffering bad outcome do.

Yet Texas shows perfectly fine two standards care — people little means everyone else. Thanks Abbott, poor risk treated unvaccinated caregivers.

Abbott’s “I’ve gotta win primary” mandate also rocked families across Texas first students return classrooms.

With almost remote-learning options available, parents, health experts educators implored governor allow individual districts mandate masks see fit.

In response Abbott’s tweet Thursday “Texans mastered safe practices help prevent &amp; avoid spread #COVID19.”

The next day, Texas Department State Health Services reported COVID cases hospitalizations reached highest one-day mark since February.

Abbott’s gamble may provide 2022 primary victory, words “unwise” “opportunistic” pandemic legacy.

Since can’t change governor’s mind, here’s control:

Each us access infinitely greater protection year ago. Every single person, matter poor, immediate means dramatically minimize risk — getting shot.

It’s also worth remembering modest winners ongoing saga adapters: accept that, known facts change day day, response tailored meet conditions.

We’re still good — often opting extremes “carry umbrella everywhere rest life it’s raining today” “don’t even umbrella it’s raining today.”

Masks social distancing hardly seemed top mind crowds gathered local restaurant downtown Dallas Wednesday.
COMMENTARY
Should wearing masks again? cope COVID delta variant spreads North Texas
BY SHARON GRIGSBY
I’m intent continuing find middle way, means wearing mask right public. I’m chance — even vaccinated unmasked — might catch enough delta virus load unknowingly pass along someone else.

It’s true find little galling that, essence, mask largely protect unvaccinated.

But choose think tiny subset people whose medical conditions preclude vaccination. think immunocompromised, vaccine might effective.

I also think children 12 aren’t eligible vaccination. risk severe illness low, wouldn’t part reduce parents’ anxiety?

Most all, think oldest among us contracting breakthrough infection far dangerous rest us. say another prayer longtime friend, 93-year-old Evelyn Willey.

Many people Dallas remember Evelyn, spunky mother former Dallas Morning News editorial page editor Keven Ann Willey often daughter’s side Keven’s 15 years leadership here.

In blink eye late last week, COVID struck Evelyn still-new retirement community residence Tucson. called Keven slurred speech, terrible cough difficulty completing thought.

Evelyn got lucky. doctor able quickly arrange monoclonal antibody infusion mom daughter isolation Keven’s Tucson home. even Kev’s husband, Georges, allowed in.

Keven told Monday swings all-consuming worry mom fury could get shot — won’t. Seeing Evelyn become sick precautions family taken past 18 months excruciating, Keven said.

So much pandemic maddeningly complex contradictory. One thing not: vaccinated Americans, less virus spread.

“The fear, pain loss people refuse vaccine imposing others callously irresponsible,” Keven said.

Let’s hope doesn’t take COVID mutating strain immune current vaccines people get message. zoom concerts? Also edited stats wrong you’re arguing yourself. Downvotes coming people actually read statement saw he's anti-vaxxer listening bandmate PhD molecular biology focus virology. 

Your comment coming someone posts PhD STEM subreddits... SMH ""Ireland cumulative uptake least one vaccine dose among adults older 18 87.2%. Romania's uptake 31.5%.""

Wow even *Mississippi* beating Romania vaccination stakes. Stormin Norman FTW!  know sarcastic, one's experience already clearly indicated this, good confirmation scientific research, used basis policy. Alright we’ve got OJ, purple stuff, oh we’ve got Covid Plus! Thanks Mom! carries Covid he’s risk others. Door swings ways. $100 works know value 'those people' set lives. This. lot people visas stuck went back able get back in. there’s people like end never same. Don’t act like it’s big deal. leave Joe Exotic this!  may appreciate following I’d wager pot smoking greater risk stunting development social interaction lol. kinda funny Indeed. little month went 500 11k 2k cases, still dropping hard. changes regulations closing night clubs. GBS well super hesitant. fine oust really shitty. one telling ignore doctor. 

They saying can't safe around unvaccinated person. 

He choosing follow Drs advice unfortunately means can't part band. Scientists: ""no one really knows what's going on""


Reddit comments: ""I definitely know"" got first dose, I’m fully board vaccinations American. question:

Wouldn’t FDA pretty much approve point cause huge backlash? favorite science class old testament! I'm pro-vaccine, find ethically dubious. That’s listed vaccine risk CDC site. Dementia neuro disease listed. It’s totally possible disorder could cause complication though. However benefits seem outweigh going throw Billy Corgan band antivax?  

Love music dude Qltist. Definitely district Texas. school worked last year, made taboo talk staff student positive covid test. affected person would quietly disappear awhile leaving everyone guessing actual case quarantining safety. made impossible contact tracing never knew quarantining due exposure given time. district told us discussing hipaa violations would meet severe repercussions district would handle notifying us parents potential exposure. Magically, one ever quarantine due exposure school! covid ripped several departments couple grade levels, coincidence! year delta imagine bad be. read article, doesnt state real detail medical condition is. sounds like antivaxxer. \~50% protection mortality ""from May"" link refers \*1 dose\* AZ Pfizer. Elsewhere 80s, estimated 2 doses Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine reduces risk hospitalisation 93%.

Your second link shows big Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine 88% effective symptomatic disease B.1.617.2 variant 2 weeks second dose, compared 93% effectiveness B.1.1.7 variant

If seeing slight reduction, may looking stat 1 dose again. vaccinated. unreasonable risk. thats entire point getting vaccinated. underlying illness get vaccinated chances dying get less dying car accident. celeb 10 years ago school kicking unvaccinated kid refused get vaccinated caused autism entire left would arms. unbelievable. Simple majority? What's point governor? Newsweek article quoting saying he’d it. even know offspring still met created music. Post  Reasonable accommodation doesnt include accepting risk health. fit govern.  organization record said they're waiting FDA approval mandate vaccine? biggest question far, FDA dropped ball getting approved back July ensure kids would able vaccinated prior school starting.  Honest question: confused going Isreal. thought initially vaccine numbers fantastic talking locking September holiday? also giving 3rd shots risk. happened? understanding world case study, looks good wanting vaccine say ""hey look Isreal doesnt work"". good articles? complicated pattern Dan Flashes. Yay, Goons understand CDC puts much emphasis antibody levels. know T-cells B-cells far important long-term immunity. thank :) say wanted fine private businesses too? recommending single mRNA shot previous infection 90 days. Idk large percentage general public knows doctor doesnt. Yeah hadn’t read whole Twitter thread yet. GBS legitimate reason get vaxxed, goes spout classic anti-vaxx talking points. Leave Reddit upvote speculation downvote someone knows full story. disagree this. LOT people choosing get vaxed know side specific political party. used heard happening since least parents' generation. govt digital record.  shit thing. FDA still proper vetting allowing public use. Although approved regular use, approved use emergency use. Said another way, FDA didn’t approve emergency use, none us would it. Yes. neurologist said friend cannot get vaccine ever again. I’ll let neurologist know said. hope UNC school system pushes mandate cover 16 schools including big ones like UNC NCSU. Android camera also scan.

Some states (like Cali) also digital vaccine proof save PDF, add Google Pay wallet. Certain people seem think disagreeing treason.

Of course, people say side can't tolerate different opinions...  vary venue/state/employer. give report covid vaccines workplace.

I work nontraditional pharmacy (as in, chain drugstore) presence 19 states. vaccines reported state federal government. way state's individual IIC (the immunization database) functions slightly different, 19 states service one use it. required report covid vaccines give within 24 hours putting arm.

If think info stored, wrong. could get dead ones vote him, would. CA get digital card saved phone. Authorized emergency use actual approval different things. point still stands EUA FDA approval sense you’re arguing. You’re making bad faith arguments won’t anything except alienate vaccine hesitant folks further. gb. Another identity. vaxing statement political beliefs. taken away big deal. Subverting system way doubling identity.

Proof identity politics purely liberal problem. not. evidence based medical advice, you’re medical professional maybe pipe point many cases: % herd community. 

imagine country expose population gradually virus (of course medical supervision). Serious cases get covered, normal symptom-less cases get antibodies.

I believe that's somewhat called vaccine. Better anthrax Didnt say doctor advised it? really dont see issue here. family member didnt get reason get idiots vaccinate. mention insurance companies. imagine FDA approval comes along sudden premiums double cause vaccinated. Nice! pre-delta variant. Less half unvaccinated still chose get together. think win military access cruise missiles could accurately hit living room sofa 4000 miles away...

Ok Anyone else think Pete's story add up? claims doctor says safer get virus getting vaccine???

Like I'm going pretend expert GBS, fucking way believe vaccine capable triggering it, virus capable. 

This seems like anti-vaxx wants make excuse especially literally defends getting vaccine even totally healthy. Actually misspoke. kids, unvaxed. misspelled “smart”, reminds Colbert quote: “Reality well known liberal bias”. doesn’t actually *have* GBS? probably still get vaxxed yeah that’s one conditions Pfizer list contraindications Thanks. pretty anxious

I feel like I’ve run truck. Hope passes soon Thanks this, friend doctor could chiropractor thinks cracking back effective treatment COVID know.

He's spouting borderline anti-vax nonsense, GBS mRNA vaccines established link, access personalized medical advice expert virology mRNA... network represents approximately 10% US population (~32 million 3,299 sample population 32 million 



The U.S. closer 330 million. See ""extra tidbits"" section -- evidence waning large, well-monitored cohort studies  Thanks. show covid you’re unvaccinated, go back line. That’s 1! Well fair, COVID vaccines first consumer ready mRNA vaccines produced, given rare cases reactions viral vector vaccines GBS, understand amount skepticism. mean they're *new* though; decades research behind them, I'm unsure effects mRNA vaccines GBS studied. doctor recommending it, question reasoning, think doctor's recommendation thrown unless there's actually merit reasoning. read article, comments, full context, surface-level thoughts matter.

I suffer form IBD, immunosuppresants I'm shown dramatically decrease antibody count generated COVID vaccine (though unclear correlates efficacy), still got regardless. Unfortunately, I'll immunosuppressants rest life, really get advantage waiting it. GBS obviously different case though, concern reactions vaccines, necessarily efficacy.

TL;DR, agree advised getting mRNA vaccine link abnormal reactions people GBS. certainly would like hear behind doctor's reasoning regard. there's room nuance here. People sub would murder half population ""save"" significantly smaller portion people power so. copied exact text post well. great info infections kids delta. *don’t* listen personalized medical advice one’s primary care physician it’s want hear. Got it. Prune it

Prune shit right fucking Relative  Literally heard this. actually made laugh. It’s funny kidding me!? Disarmed? Thought Smashing Pumpkins. Isnt cheaper amd easier wslk intp CVS get vaccinated? Encouraging indeed. Still want little one vaccinated ASAP. Delta vaccine evasion capability Beta (AKA South African variant). chances fact you’re banned means aren’t piece shit, congrats! 

SA alt-lite trash best days. i’m ashamed time spent there.  mean guy still dealing legal fallout shenanigans past years. Even one felony conviction would make ineligible run public office.  First all, Euros going people gathered pubs/restaurants/etc.. watch game
Second Euro final held full capacity

So going first point shows idea wtf talking about.

Third, contact tracing works small number cases. It’s impossible US would never work

Fourth, kids school might might good thing do. far, it’s inconclusive whether makes significant difference. might increase cases 10%-14% end day won’t stop COVId.

In this, somehow missed biggest thing actually makes difference, UK higher 1st shot vaccination rate US. UK also saw spike cases eventual drop. US likely going sane stuff obviously spike bit higher fewer people vaccinated. like UK month people saying “oh drop US cases inexplicable” much knee-jerk reaction same, step back realize much know new virus is, kind amazing one fucking asked plus version, goddamnit dad literally looking clinical trials could last summer desperate get it, finally volunteered distribution

Sounds like amalgamation parents, sort of. tried volunteer Moderna hear back original phone survey. lady finally called back *the afternoon got back first shot*, seriously. Fantastic timing! Anyway, point, could get work, I'd done.

My parents (living elsewhere) older would still wait available age group. They're retired, said fuck volunteered vaccination site, given virtue that.

(Meanwhile, niece, *pathologically* afraid anything medical, somehow found ability deep within get shot turned 12 knew it'd way could see friends normally again.) good news everyone barely felt either mine. first one surprised little felt started worrying whether properly. sure did, somewhat unnerving.  Please hold. call important us. COVID representative shortly. Wait times currently years.  5th drummer? Seconded. Can’t eat eggs without far, evidence suggest delta plus renders vaccines less effective, according infectious disease epidemiologist Korean Vaccine Society’s vice president Dr. Chun Byung-chul. That's correct.  Vaccine efficacy compare total chances; rather compares relative chances. 

90% efficacy 1/10th relative chance whether actual actual chance high low. Yeah point I'm going throw towel (meaning give trying mitigate risk say fuck die it). work healthcare hospice. It’s mind boggling nurses justify getting vaccine. Yes, education doesn’t mean common sense, sadly. It’s disappointing Here's [more 4 days bad news variant extraordinarily contagious — contagious chickenpox, C.D.C. said — people so-called breakthrough infections may spread virus Provincetown, news left behind feeling winding clock back maybe April May 2021,” said Susan Peskin, longtime summer visitor moved full time four years ago. “Now clear, clear day, vaccinated still get Covid. Bottom line, really watch think over. nowhere near over.” 1 100,000 pretty rare fear 100% warranted would things way would please health bureaucracy. ""I good excuse, even didn't"" something people say excuse good.  reply counter mine way. Everyone get Covid, asymptomatic regular symptoms (especially vaccinated). post one guys breakthrough case said considered normal nothing would done average person. mean one week crowded dance party´s, wild gay sex unknown strangers every night likely give worse things Covid. So, work marijuana then, drastically increases melatonin levels? 


As far natural nitric oxide boosting, tuning forks excellent. strike right forks, combination them, room begins spin. Tuning forks proven way increasing nitric oxide, weed melatonin production. 


Also probably helpful: low dose aspirin day, amino acid NAC, black seed oil thinning blood. Look believe me. fact nicotine competes virus ACE2 binding really interesting. Seriously big loss. ain’t good it’s offspring it’s easy fill concerned vaccines dr fauci said safe would significantly reduce chance bringing covid home wife kids. quit caring long term effects would potentially cause long would keep safer. People aren’t getting vaccinated point selfish assholes. Bad title, it’s part truth makes look wrong. take five minutes required read Wikipedia article posting this? know someone developed GBS taking vaccine shot amd currently paralysed it. wonder they'll another shot fix him? I'd wager unvaccinated less scared big crowds unfortunately. However I'd guess 80-90% folks attendance likely vaccinated given demographics data I've seen suggests us military likely vaxxed general public. 75%. Want know another reason Delta spreading?????!!!!!

In TN, even tell employer got Delta variant, don’t care now! 😡 
They let go back work wether still not! 😡 

TN doesn’t care masks (I’ve wearing mine still) 😢 

I’m surrounded un vaccinated people work make money live 😢 

There nurses doctors vaccinated, yet still aloud take care people?!?!

I several friends vaccinated already delta variant!! 😡

It bad here. TN shut pandemic unemployment. Except fact efficacy compares total chances two groups said dependent variables. 

A scenario rising cases transmission rate affects chances unvaccinated group getting severe illness, 1/25 ratio actually decreases. kind masks using? tried KF94s? trust science. 99.98 can't got J&amp;J get another J&amp;J shot? What's benefit getting Pfizer/Moderna? Ok alpha 50% primed human cells delta 75%, delta+?  also impact touring. Venues , festival billings ,and even visas denied band crew unvaccinated. It’s financial decision. Thanks much this. Would able provide similar report Lambda? British Columbia removed mask mandates completely, Ontario Quebec kept them. case counts speak themselves. think ""brace"" much ask question jabbed slightly distracted. nearly much giving blood lol. No, that's CDC said. say less likely get (by huge margin) get symptoms similar levels virus unvaccinated person. see lot comments getting second dose months after, study compared difference 3-, 4-, 5-week window. difference statistically significant one three assays used. large drop antibody levels 4 weeks second dose. clear renders possible advantage 5-week-between-doses strategy irrelevant point, since data granular. he's ill health claims can't get vaccine, risking another possibly worse COVID infection. And, definitely putting others risk. Screw people think getting vaccinated them. Sad true, wouldn’t work US. RIP, shame. Seems similar Israel's results. Try /r/COVID19 . sub two things: celebrating, panicking. must feel like fucking king arguments days. Wow! Incredible! May granddaughter baby dealing RSV right now. mandates certain public spaces, great hear.

Apparently Delta variant, exclusively company vaccinated people value thought. Recent events shown vaccinated people catch virus relatively easily, seem spread fairly easily well. Fortunately, vaccinated people seem much less severe symptoms, course terrific excellent reason get vaccinated right.

The idea vaccinated, anything worry ""the pandemic you"" seems yet another misconception kind seen last 18 months. love everyone writes ""GBS"" hip other's rare neurological disorders. I'm sure federal judge overrule it. mean samples clinical trials representative general population. That’s essentially entire foundation trials. use representative sample general population, results trial applied general population.

So yeah, results would almost certainly general population. Holland doctoral student Laboratory Viral Oncology Proteomics Research, Keck School Medicine, supervised Professor Suraiya Rasheed.[13] March 2013, Holland co-authors published paper PLoS One regarding microRNA HIV genomes,[14] titled ""Identification Human MicroRNA-Like Sequences Embedded within Protein-Encoding Genes Human Immunodeficiency Virus"".[15] original academic paper describes use computational molecular biological (in silico) approaches identify microRNA-like sequences HIV. sequences suggested evolved self-regulate survival virus host evading immune responses thus influence persistence, replication, pathogenicity HIV. Holland awarded Ph.D. degree molecular biology USC Commencement May 12, 2017.

Yes is. Look Novawax comes out, also work cells gave  feel like staying successful band would count bribe. holy ghost It’s possible new cases among much healthier cohort.

Although point, it’s unlikely would offset Doubling. didn’t know j&amp;j tho. Thanks pal! live haven’t heard athletes visiting clubs would interested see photos.

I’ve heard people say stuff like “poor athletes, holed hotels/the Olympics village can’t go sightseeing”, find bizarre. Yes, probably athletes afford travel anywhere want pleasure chance visit Japan, we’re middle pandemic right enough athletes games held help sh*t ton taxpayer money could used people actually life here. Honestly goes beyond medicine extends general science. World political business leaders ignoring science name money power. Short term focus extreme few. absolutely inexcusable long time. 

Unfortunately, seems experts matter jives wants needs charge. 

It ironic, live age information never accessible age ignorance better descriptor modern era. know exactly I’m talking it’s doesn’t. can’t tell pervasive disease you’re testing people forced tested they’re mandated to. TY Duh    suggesting us vaccinated stay locked down? Get real. narrative sub Israel data flawed match studies. confirmed say expected. Lots people claiming religious excemption vaccine particular various misinformation-addled reasons Wait closed them? hard concept making small sacrifices help many people??

If admitted worthwhile now, they'd admitting Dear Leader wrong. think meant ""for now"" elaborate-- enter buildings public transport scan [ID], makes easy identify building infected people. 

I'm sure much that. example, friend walked one cities outbreak. Afterwards, everyone city advised quarantine. comply, nothing bad came it. 

To sounds like they're using simple surveillance system universal buy-in seats wings better views. Vaccines work... fuck. Either way, cases also probably increase - but, current wave showed, probably decrease without additional restrictions and/or hospital stress.

According latest analyses Rt UK seems hovering around 1, means we'll likely see peaks valleys coming weeks. We're basically trying protect antivaxer antimaskers forcing vaccinated people wear masks. frustrating would much effective vaccinate everyone. I'm going AAP say. also impossible create distribute vaccine fast (as world) did. 

Where there’s there’s way initial dose also effective Delta. Love propping 2nd coming christ. took almost family, can't rational conversation them, surface level chit chat like stranger standing behind store. Guess nice find whole family complete fucking morons SMH could told free. doesn’t need “control group”. Control groups running experiments, determining pervasive disease is. 

I know mind “scary scientisms”, promise idea you’re talking  Well, friend using special mask every single allergy wearing mask helps lot survive summer. yeah, she’s minority. fear virus evolve current vaccines longer effective. would back square one us all.  Could virus evolve less dangerous variant like Spanish Flu did? know may never happen, want know possible. list problems vaccines.

If told want buy Fiat 500 terrible safety reliability record, would accuse believing safety reliability cars?

If new drug came out, pharmacutical company made said:

""Normally takes 5-10 years develop new drug, made one less year. studies show safe, course able long term studies because, well, take years ten months."" 

""So like drugs I've used, sort different chemical makeup?""

""Oh no, completely new drug delivery system never used people before."" 

""Okay, disease drug helps with, risk that?""

""Well, 30 health issues, statistically, almost zero.""

""You know what, I'll wait till long term studies come back"" 

Anyone would agree perfectly reasonable descision. now, slap word ""vaccine"" instead drug, suddenly awful person refusing.

I slightly higher risk group, took vaccine. based risk Covid young, healthy people, fact new vaccines based brand new vaccine technology, reasonable person well within right refuse, punished ostrasized it. Vaccination rates United States substantially higher many countries, barring Europe. 

We're lot worse right now.  It’ll still spread create variants countries, world vaccinated don’t see big reason force get vaccinated yet. 

The issue see, right least, unvaccinated potentially bogging healthcare system again. happens, say live let live, I’m fine vaccine, they’re fine without one. decision starts impacting health care system, say leave Lmaoooo. Wait learn optimal Sample Sizes!

I promise buddy statisticians thought solved issue you’re describing centuries ago. 

You learn get highschool. It’s like saying number dead condo collapse slowed found 3 bodies first day 2 next day. Increase viral load 1000 TIMES! 1000%. goes show much infectious vast majority deaths children 12 18 range currently get vaccine.

Just FYI fact. It’s almost like that’s whole point speaks employers flexible.

I'm fully vaccinated, there's still way I'd productive office. I'd one wearing mask would think particles floating around air poorly ventilated space. One coworkers anti-vaxx. one wearing mask video conference calls.

It's crazy employers concerned butts seats physical mental health employees. Whoaaa attacking anyone cautious. kids, might radical stuff protect them, trust me. fully understand parents worries.

I’m simply preventing misinformation spread.

Seeing random videos information trickle China enough make educated guess COVID would spread too. 1 China news source can't trusted hundreds tiny bits information random people tells story. TIL liberal = taking reasonable public health measures   result report campus police forging documents. agree. called leadership. We've needed last year half r/HermanCainAward Including nuclear blasts. Wow, I've never heard this. I'm sure places allowed this. minimum time 3 weeks. happening, certainly advocated CDC. takes ten first shot even take effect. must small pocket country. Water fucking wet No. Yeah, many genuine. Vaccines/day increasing. Sure, slowed down, never stopped. 

Every single day vaccine hesitant coming around. see boosts approvals. another boost Novawax available. another boost novawax final approval. second turned looks like half population shockingly different reaction jabs expected 

it lost credibility. give statement, truthful add anti vax rhetoric, second started bullshit detector went off. Adding idea know reasons lots neighbours taking somehow difficult disclose medical knowledge. stupid bullshit, besides fact serious reactions remotely high entirely expected range one issue saying ""I really bad reaction vaccine kid told take more"". haemorrhoids, prolapsed rectum, gangrene dick, something one issue slightly embarrassing.

At point assume he's anti vax simply stating doctor told take one picked random severe reaction make everyone believe him. possible doctor feeding bad info. 0-5 equates like 117k people. Ages 3, 4, 5 children, toddlers. Interesting see we’re waiting updates UK 7/19 freedom day.

Oh let’s see look like Chicago past weekend.  Uh good then, sincerely hope gonna another strain, people get booster shots, cannot. Ph returned finish research write dissertation years ago, focusing HIV immunodeficiency viruses.  Brazil historically pretty good vaccine uptake, even COVID. chance dying drunk driving far higher covid anything

That factual.

In 2019, 10,142 people died traffic accidents least one person alcohol blood. last year-ish, 614,000 died covid. going take lot fancy math make drunk driving dangerous covid that's people vaccinated still get, spread, die covid

But (1) far, far, far less likely get (2) get faster. Consequently, gravity spread wholly unvaccinated. would community spread people vaxed. ITT: know better doctor.  course know him, he’s Me. thank god no! miss seeing live. Considering already covid effects understand avoiding something could potentially make paralyzed. 

I want first person find either. 

He antivacc btw.........so understand people getting this. completely bizarre made rule. least situation merit unlike people. many 'em antivirals? 1/25th compared unvaccinated people, really unlikely end hospital. 

Efficacy ratio vaccinated unvaccinated. total chances, dependent sort variables. see sacking necessary.

You want create situation health workers incentivized ensure *""leftover""* doses conveniently administered family members.

Nobody disputes doses precious wasted. nurse one deciding give to. told superior available doses let decide. 

We know whether someone else available (not family) could/should received doses. Oh noooooooo may dumb, I'm dweeb 
I'm sucker damn vaccine  data report insufficient draw 
conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines 
against SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant, 
outbreak. population-level vaccination coverage increases, 
vaccinated persons likely represent larger proportion 
of COVID-19 cases. Second, asymptomatic breakthrough 
infections might underrepresented detection bias. 
Third, demographics cases likely reflect attendees 
at public gatherings, events marketed adult 
male participants; study underway identify 
population characteristics among cases, additional 
demographic characteristics underlying health conditions 
including immunocompromising conditions.

It's important recognize random sample instead small cluster positives several large public events. know things like overall percent attendees events vaccinated (vaccinated people would possibly fearless larger crowds). 

This snapshot authors even point ""data report insufficient draw conclusions effectiveness COVID-19 vaccines SARS-CoV-2, including Delta variant"". Watch become POTUS answer what- ignore don’t talk it? gives power, lets control conversation firmly whatever talking becomes important openness honesty. Women deserve information available bodies, matter anti-vaxxers might also it. exactly it. I’m much looking forward approval. would strongly advise read article nervous. Delta+ makes sound way scarier actually is. got near 100% vaccinated, would fine. country full selfish, self centered, uneducated assholes. Yeah probably good idea/point. I’m embarrassed waited long is, I’m glad finally. Yeah exactly understanding potential medical problems. Finding new drummer trivial, especially pandemic. That’s really scary. many vaccinated Covid symptoms severe enough get tested, many active infections symptoms many others infect asymptotically? Guess that’s always wear mask public Malnourishment. Wrong types food. Delta variant. Hold beer. Ya one mother die it. ""Some people trying get booster shots pharmacies providers own, without waiting federal government’s blessing. Officials Contra Costa County, home 1.1 million people Northern California, eager offer boosters July 23 told vaccine providers give extra shots people asked “without requiring documentation justification.” Then, realizing policy violated F.D.A. rules vaccines authorized emergency use, county reversed week.""

The *policy* violates FDAs rules giving third shot violates them? know several people gotten third shot area pharmacies without issues I've wondering reported chain... Idk man contagious delta get recommended interval country toddler got RSV take hospital wheezing coughing threw up.  Apparently RSV super bad year.

We pin give Albuterol every hours bit.  fun.    Traditionally, Japanese placed great value preserving ""face"" avoiding public shame...I wonder strong younger generations...

This work well usa - many would consider point pride listed.... Already COVID (tested positive twice course year, actually) mild. would inject something less intense cold, one around ever got sick, there's guarantee contagious even it, prevent carrying anyway? 74% people recent Massachusetts breakout fully vaccinated (CDC). likely lesser chance carrying anything someone fully vaxed due immunity. I'm good risking side effects nothing. Covid makes stupid. True fact. Maybe beginning zombie apocalypse? said people able get vaccine coerced lmao. problem maybe country like North Korea would suit better. Vermont's older brother dirtbike bought everyone beer high school finally lives ""or"" motto, instead ""and"". yep safe mix sinovac vaccines? died? Yeah that’s true. able get mine earlier wait went 4 half months 3 months. Interesting [read whereabouts remaining got first shot today. wait longer second one need study first ? Or, keep kids busy parents work uninterrupted. kids home, lot people can't work. Link didn’t happen I'm bit uncertain doctor previously GBS may receive COVID-19 precursor Delta++ People GBS still safely receive mRNA vaccines (Pfizer Moderna USA). says he's pro- vaccines, goes spout antivaxxer rhetoric. really need watch YT video exponential growth. haven’t followed treatment stuff developed closely. anything close hitting market yet even get infected?  Avoid reposting information, please. hospitalized; July 27, deaths reported.  hospitalized patient (age range = 50–59 years) vaccinated multiple underlying medical conditions.  additional, fully vaccinated patients§§ aged 20–70 years also hospitalized, two underlying medical Also kind weird testing deer Jan 2020 took months get tests humans. knew someone PhD molecular biology emphasis virology...

If knew person, could educate interpret data.

Oh, wait, lead singer (former) band happens degree? Holy old fuck! FDA release may say otherwise? least Y'alls next president. Supposedly even infectious delta.  subway national chain. franchises, I'm sure I'd lump true small businesses.

that signing bonus nuts, tho. think real news Offspring break like 15+ years ago. **Article** 


Full vaccination halves transmission Delta variant coronavirus 60 per cent effective preventing symptoms Covid-19, according Imperial College’s latest React-1 prevalence survey. 
The findings, released Wednesday based study 98,000 volunteers England, provide extensive community evidence far way vaccines protect Delta, originated India completely displaced earlier Alpha variant UK since beginning April. 
Recent studies shown 90 per cent vaccine effectiveness preventing hospitalisation Delta. React-1, 40 per cent participants testing positive asymptomatic many others mild symptoms. Effectiveness estimates always decrease researchers include less serious disease. 
“Vaccination remains highly effective Delta,” said Imperial’s Paul Elliott, co-leader project. 
React-1, running since April 2020, provides monthly snapshots Covid testing random samples people across England. latest survey, June 24 July 12, prevalence infection, 0.63 per cent, four times higher previous round May 20 June 7. 
The spread starting slow end sampling period study stopped soon catch recent rapid fall Covid cases. 
“The Delta variant made 100 per cent latest sample,” said Steven Riley, study’s co-leader. “We pick worrying sub-lineages Delta.” 
This first time React-1 estimated vaccine effectiveness. analysis included AstraZeneca Pfizer vaccines break figures jab. 
“The findings, coupled studies demonstrating impact coronavirus vaccines reducing hospitalisation death Covid-19, encouraging,” said Tom Wingfield, senior clinical lecturer Liverpool School Tropical Medicine. “However, \[they\] also serve reminder that, even extremely high vaccine coverage, highly likely wave infections autumn.” 
A separate UK study, released Tuesday night, gave reassuring results “long Covid” children. Researchers King’s College London studied 1,734 children aged five 17 showed Covid symptoms positive test. 
They found symptoms lasted four weeks 4.4 per cent group eight weeks 1.8 per cent. figures well 10 20 per cent levels frequently reported adults long Covid. symptoms reported commonly children headaches, fatigue sore throat. 
“Many children catch coronavirus don’t show symptoms all, reassuring families know children fall ill Covid-19 unlikely suffer prolonged effects,” said Emma Duncan, senior author study published Lancet Child Adolescent Health. “Our research confirms small number long illness duration Covid-19, though children usually recover time.” 
“The important finding low proportion persistent symptoms, great majority recovered two months illness,” said Russell Viner, professor child adolescent health University College London. “This much lower reported studies reassuring population burden post-Covid symptoms children young people.”   likely. friend one people, know it’s gotten approval, she’s going another reason get it.  Well, vaccination ""breakthrough"" case rates apply unvaccinated. figures used drawing comparisons vaccines. 

A background case *prevalence* would useful draw conclusion *efficacy* though.. know prevalence likely differ vaccination group. Also lead singer molecular biologist still kicked . .. could still get GBS manages contract virus reading contract wrong? COVID deaths right amongst unvaccinated individuals. So, yeah, vaccine isn’t perfect, it’s damn good job keeping people alive. chance dying drunk driving far higher Covid anything” 

In US, 345,000+ COVID deaths 2020. can’t find statistics 2020, 2019, 10,000 deaths drunk driving. I’m sure you’re getting information from. Gullible bowel syndrome. eat rocks keeps trying digest em. Lots good information vaccine fares variants. simple, logical piece information missing articles subject? HIPAA applies everybody medical providers. place work subject HIPAA laws. Oops, yeah...always-always ask permission first go proper channels paperwork. Every dose accounted for, even expires destroyed. Otherwise, four doses go? comes back hospital administrator there's theft. Delta ton brand recognition. give up? first, deliveries started ramping strategy shifted get second dose ASAP one isn’t enough stop Delta. I’m late 30’s got mine 6 weeks apart. Yea real pieces science denying shit. right! sure i'm vaccinated work casino property sales associate, \*not\* get paid enough enforce mask mandate, let alone want one ask see people's vaccination cards (this left online booking/check-in). city also major hotspot travelers careless travel unvaccinated. may get paid sick time covid, mean want to... actually enjoy job

edit: agree you, get sick vaxxed, themselves.

edit trial regular Covid would like unsubscribe automatic updates now. Alright, we’re gonna come guidelines here. think it’s pretty safe say quotes dude, policy involved, purely political. friends okay?  getting sick staying alive enough get months ago. Whatever takes guess though. percentage hospitalized many died? Remember include base rate. It’s basic statistics. administration needs announce randomly audit 250 cards. Anyone caught fake immediately expelled, refunds, information turned FBI falsifying government documents. Problem solved. Yes Like concluded need vaccine deadly disease. we’re burnt out. It’s really simple. I’m dreading going back restrictions. completely killed mental health year. know I’m alone.  Why? Regardless situation someone vaccinated vaccinated. matter good friend they're reasons are. results trust doctor, get second doctor's opinion. guy neither. likely protecting audiences. kinda glad wait 4 months since first line vaccine (got first dose January second April). got exposed covid work get it.  anomaly lifetime politician. People like Trump usually never make far bull china shop tends allowed many stores.

Trump pretending person sycophants love. right blend trust fund, narcissism, speed-induced mental decline ""prove"" stupid assholes greatest. DeSantis pretend Mr Magoo politics lot conpetition (sic). Cases definitely seem plateaued. Deaths increased fact decreased reason meanwhile states surges show deaths increasing. think likely delay reporting deaths. kook Arkansas Louisiana thing happened released big one day increase deaths. still expect see deaths reach previous peaks younger pts hospitalized due low vaccination rates age group. know serious not. saying 3 billion COVID-19 deaths 5 years? That's quite high number. base numbers on? right 200 million cases almost 4,5 million deaths means like 2% corona died god knows many extreme conditions. can't see 7,6 billion people getting corona 5 billion dying. People getting vaccinated, putting risk choice. singer scientist? surprising hear tbh. According latest news, vaccinated person could highly infectious well. vaccine passport means zero regard. would need instant testing everyone coming door. seriously brought back well exactly see joke... checked somehow exactly 2001. exactly same.

And I'm still banned. Nope. told skip Jansen vaccine. Pfizer Moderna totally safe GB patients.  coming getting 12,000, access enough vaccines. shitshow. Hm, think Florida legislature voted greatly curtail ability sue here. knew going go way, provided cover businesses (and government facilities, assume). Actually, every single bar restaurant I’ve gone requires vaccination absolutely packed brim.

You greatly mistaken. longer allowed places get vaccinated. Bye bye. Awe man that’s hard- I’m sorry Yeah. also bullshit philosophy degree know get vaccinated. scientist educated isn’t excuse get vaccinated listen people suggesting get vaccinated. I’m vaccinated I’m done giving two shits willfully unvaccinated point. Literally worse dead weight society. I'll do.wjat need keep safe. means 2x year booster, it. course, science safety need too. Never huge Offspring fan I’m stoked hear OC band challenging rubbish generalization OC home conservatives. fair Paul speaking kinda notable hand, Clapton running mouth anti lockdown/anti vax nonsense lot people hold Clapton high esteem feel similarly McCartney.

In perfect world, guys think public health topics matter anyone tip anybody's opinion, world. It’s literally Supreme Court precedent LOL 

Vaccine mandates inevitable now, legal ;) early last year? January? February? SARS, swine flu, bird flu, Ebola, Zika, maybe epidemics ultimately little effect day day lives Westerners, can’t fault anyone thinking COVID would blow too.

By March clear something different. made mistake, correct it. can’t take Ho hospital  wouldn’t call case drop yet, today’s cases higher last weeks. 

That said, it’s certainly exponential growth. Hoping turn tide quickly free shot...just take damn thing! watch Harry Vox interview 2014. Youtube see feel I’ve watched governor Florida double every bad idea ever had. never admitted wrong anything. It’s like thinks might wrong gets angrier insistent. kind personality disorder. 🤷‍♀️ really hope Florida variant called DeSantis variant. vaccine already gotten/will get? Thanks link. issue testing T-cells effort provide reassurance. / happen advice act consider oneself unvaccinated.. Yeah! don’t want it! Waaaaaa. don’t want it! 

Hey listen pal, doesn’t want it! don’t wanna take dumb old vaccine!   difficult prove fake.

Literally campus health look name vaccination number. kind thing normal course business.  Vaccination verification college admissions new thing. way put making feel DoD probably that, know always projection. Reddit would never that
  ...

  ...

^^^^^*/s* I've got gear ready, Dexter!   survives thru gut sewage tested virus. sure doc says yes. virus detected urine semen.  wife antivax shot. kids shots wife refuses get covid vaccine. current excuse FDA hasn’t approved PCOS immune related issues. understand caution she’s talking doctor it. 

However kids got sick wanted put garlic socks friend recommended it.

I honestly total loss lack process this. honestly came nowhere. single shot provided lot protection realized could protect people giving many people one shot giving half people shots. pandemic numbers game. “Vaccine passport” one insane ideas I’ve ever heard of.

I’m glad none hold public offices. wonder played ""Why get job"" letting go. can’t compare apples oranges? college ready mandate u need vaccine person classes soon it’s FDA approved, happens vaccinated non FDA approved one Delta. last year simply doesn’t work. Add one lowest vaccination rates world policies don’t much limit spread, that’s have. Cases seem leveling somewhat, it’s still gonna take long time get control. What’s actual count ? can’t find band leader literally PhD thesis mRNA viruses. Dr. Holland qualified judge physicians.

What…? No, he’s not. know dishonest, right? Third world countries bad medical infrastructure deaths. talking stuff US specifically cite global numbers. maliciousness. good one, man.   ""weird new shit""? vaccine.. vaccinated ton times COVID vaccines different. 100%  Typo Sounds like kind bad idea, risk clinical trial, none benefits society real random trial would provide They’ve thriving all, business’s stayed open, people headed Disney World, etc…I believe it, it’s somewhat sanctuary state taxes Covid. It’s hard believe people going party, vacation, brings lot money.

I haven’t seen financials, I’m going based he’s saying, I’d imagine wouldn’t saying bad spot, would different narrative I’m sure. Guess im .15 uncorrelated region. can, I'd like link dataset dms.
That's long enough book. 
The chance dying drunk driving far higher covid anything, especially vaccinated. Also, people vaccinated still get, spread, die covid would analogous people driving around buzzed example. Delta fog vaccine environmental control/pressurization system planes. Toyota rename Prius Corona 1970s-1980s(they filled slot marketed Toyota’s US lineup, oil/gas crunch) “roll coal” vaccine mist. 

But intranasal vaccine like one used flu. met science conference, addressed Brian. 

After chat HIV glycoproteins, made cheeky comment keeping em separated (that song keeping experiments separate, seriously). winked. awesome. people outside… vaccinated. always me, worked Medical industry enough know many people legit medical conditions want infect. fully vaccinated enter kind places? don’t save comments often, saved it’s fucking awesome. Sang whole thing head overall concept vaccine passport? significantly reduces risk disease entering enclosed public spaces.  Yep. sucks. live Florida bad part wants people assholes fucking die already- know lot lively people risk done best.I also know spreads, mutates, risk everyone becomes. wasn’t drunk right now, could probably think great analogy proverb, but, eh-

Get vaccinated, wear mask, wash hands-
 anyone comes complains mask, pull cough them. Sorry- that’s best got.  OP I've often found appealing emotion works straight facts won't. e.g. ""You still want see grandkids, you?"" ""We would hurt anything happened you."" ""I want put strain relationship.""  Thinking forward Halloween; likely transmission children receiving candy unmasked people houses?

Being outside I'm worried transmission people adults talking towards children know quickly could catch short interaction. data suggests exposure time required infection?

Thank you! Wouldn’t CDC vaccine card second shot info? mean pretty much given every vaccine shot without choice BT joining really matter. volunteered join military, ass belongs government basic duration contract. got vaccinated May mean, Dexter phd studying FUCKING VIRUSES all.

I get it. There’s also lot RSV cases going around. RSV joke either young kids. 165 million Americans per capita income US$34K/year. cover pandemic disproportionally killing bottom 40%, elderly, immunocompromised, trying sit proclaim fault someone spread disease taking minimum necessary precautions mandated World Health Organization credible scientific-minded groups. get complex explanations many people ill medical spiritual caregiving country sometimes quite atrocious reality led lot unhealthy bodies ""forgotten"" classes. people seem subconsciously loathe poor people simply poor expose fundamentally fatal flaws inequities inherent urgently wayward Capitalistic system, apparently solution sweep problem rug mowing lawn, one hell lawn boy they've sent.  People... voted... fucking idiot... never truly know many people died Covid said done. Sorry, can't help think strong British accent: ""By jove, dropping!"" guess get head start figuring population food shortage problems 😉  Tone article optimistic, belies actual findings. Vaccine effectiveness dropped rapidly one month, 64% 49% preventing infection, 83% 59% stopping symptomatic infection. study's authors think probably means we'll need vaccines target Delta specifically, without we'll likely see another wave fall/winter. vaccine even worse, since latest UK wave hit unvaccinated people aged 5-24 hard. calls question safely schools re-open next month. optimistic side, vaccines still effective preventing hospitalization, prevalence long covid low compared studies found embarrassed. got it. That's matters. what's alternative ? Till taxpayers supposed keep subsidising rent ? Koreas do. We've isolated since son born 2020 January. got HFM last month. got him. thing dr said maybe asymptomatic adult brought touched grocery cart (we bringing cases hours) Florida. yea 100000% recommend HFM. pediatrician said HFM RSV making big come back aggression stand, man. guess don’t like much anyway. Say way, say way ah, waaaay, get jab still get overturned lower federal court meanwhile right ? You’ll luck r COVID19. Real data real discussion. Real information. sub sucks you’re gonna get biased, politically driven information. Vaxx fucker Vaxx! Saving see response 😂 explain it, positivity rate tests done down, yes testing -11% 7 day average sure, cases -20% 7 day average South Korea call Korea? I'm confused surprise literally one.
Here masks still mandatory inside point reliably predict whether someone conspiracy nut whether wear damn mask properly not.
They're ones still keep wearing nose sticking out. ""The unclean"" There's equal part fear losing power, representation, etc. people, zero sum: ""if someone else wins, lose."" pathologically cling whichever charlatan tells want hear. guy masterful snake oil salesman - he'd spent lifetime perfecting playing sides fence, fleecing pandering. would almost admirable depraved condemnable. Make mistake, he's mostly imbecile. he's dangerous imbecile, grave threat collective good. Anyone else vein may well. dangerous ones smarter competent. Glad I’m person noticed odd comment. Like gtfo! guess needed study instead watching dopes real world hospitalisations starting stall? Also whilst testing dropped, seem dropped enough cause much dip cases. exactly truth like 95% people demographic though

“it’s cold you’ll get it” *is* happens vast majority people age demographic contract covid. course people get seriously ill small number die, people days fever sniffles.     plus likely third dose eventually makes irrelevant really open anyone 18, got point 18s next queue. 2 weeks opened 25+ iirc. -___- topic stinks. Oh, women absolutely deserve information downplayed. I’m trying conceive conversation dr prior getting vaccine possible effects. 

My frustration women’s issues usually downplayed, women hard time getting people, including dr believe lot times. 

But woman’s issue fits agenda, big press coverage! Tell don’t know anything punk without telling don’t know anything punk  small 50% population. According UNC President false information vaccination status violation University Honor Code COVID-19 Community Standards. Violations may result disciplinary action suspension university.""

Imagine losing $10,000+ fees, materials, housing etc didn’t want get free shot, tell truth getting one.  

#  Pheww William Schaffner, medical director National Foundation Infectious Diseases infectious diseases professor Vanderbilt University, said point, transmission coronavirus passed gas ""never demonstrated."" 
  ""It becomes highly theoretical exercise discuss it,"" said. ""It's unlikely."" except vaccines don’t protect everyone 100% there’s still chance breakthrough infections. chance hitting jackpot goes cases high you’re surrounded unvaccinated people crowded indoor environments. It’s safer everyone vaccinated. Damn, that’s crazy. They’re practically handing vaccines Sacramento anyone. still refusing lol We’ve come full circle doctor could acupuncturist, doesn’t specify kind. GBS serious doesn’t explain happened him. I’m convinced legit excuse year least definitely see next year projection may occur? pull healthcare provider. It’s app Look Frank, Al Yankovic! It’s called germ theory can’t see germs. Bible School is, actually.

EDIT: someone downvoting actually explain then? said accurate nobody even trying actually try explain not. Earliest i've seen possibility October, far know there's firm date yet. Oof- that's perfect.. That's spouse lives life. 

I'm apologizing shit me.. lol forgot card well, 2, one shot each. 

I guess could copy info one card, one sticker instead writing, can't even read one says handwriting. third pfizer shot booster, recommended, given 6 months 3nd dose. would wait months get least. arent needless arent vaccinated. kids vaccinated reach point people chose deaths. F that. BOOSTSHOT2022 realize Offspring still thing.

Yeah good tolerating COVID foolishness. ask id get vaxed. write whatever tell paper Yeah read vaccination provides good protection virus, especially serious illness. people danger willingly refused vaccine people sort medical complication prevents getting vaccine. That’s good enough excuse shut society. real reason masks. Yea nothing changing live Colorado led believe delay minimal? That’s it. Breakthrough cases reported duh people wanna say. hundreds/thousands cases vaccination likely helped? one feels need wave stories because, well, is. stories vaccination likely helped:

- sister’s boss, parents, grandparents (all fully vaxxed) exposed brother (unvaxxed) tested positive COVID around birthday dinner. inside afternoon/evening, around table eating together, talking, etc. commented feeling well day thought nothing it. Tested positive like two days later. single one five people around caught it. 

- mom fully vaxxed. janitress office caught Covid isn’t vaxxed boasted wasn’t going bother getting shot. Didn’t report work Monday feeling bad. Still came Tuesday feeling bad. Went mom’s office, TOOK MASK TALK MOM EATING LUNCH, said wasn’t feeling good. mom shooed away told go clinic. Bam. Positive result next day. Mum exposed - tested negative. 

- vaxxed teacher friend one students class test positive. Parents still sent child school. Teacher friend didn’t know around child ENTIRE DAY disturbing/collecting exams, taking mask breaks while, eating room etc. catch it. believe two three kids nearest student catch it. 

- (unvaxxed) uncle COVID. around three aunts (all fully vaxxed) day got results (he wasn’t feeling well, got tested, didn’t listen nurses told isolate). He’s sick week half now. Neither one aunts caught it. 

Breakthrough cases much real - dozens upon dozens upon dozens instances vaccinated people caught it. Wow, prop summer camp tax dollars, run political cover maim, murder, starve dispossess indigenous population spy us get treated like this? nerve... mom palliative care nurse, retired 3 weeks ago. pandemic broke her. planned work 5 years. seeing many die hospital reading news, couldn’t handle job anymore. said lot experienced nurses doctors quitting retiring.

I don’t think people fully realize immense impact shortly us. Hospitals staffed fresh faces little experience.  taking whole pandemic, can't hurt Well companies might afraid much longer. School’s gotta start production can’t held random outbreaks. even let country AstraZeneca/Moderna mix. coming? I'm nervous quiet vaccination get approved.

Edit: ""Pfizer said statement NBC News anticipates results clinical trials kids ages 5 11 sometime September, could apply emergency use authorization.""  think both. point view restaurant, want reassure clientele catch Covid. However, know vaccinated people transmit virus, reassuring seemed be. Still, would prefer restaurant filled vaccinated rather one admits anyone. Nice see fellow taquero GDL. fully vaccinated? old you? zero risk long covid? i'm genuinely curious. long haul covid can't imagine young formative years vs late 30s. theory higher ups GOP see whats happening. targeting unvaxxed. constituents. killing voters. pro vax **its hurting wrong people**. requirements like without delta running around would picked gym membership started dining some. 


Before delta, still. people thought kids could get virus get sick enough require Leron Finger Chief Quality Officer Children’s Hospital New think they’re wrong. think first 15 months disease kids certainly hospitalized rates much lower adult population last month we’ve seen many children admitted hospital pediatric hospitals across country,” said.

This quote article. place sub mention youth infection death without deleted. They'll probably delete whole article instead. Nothing see here. need know kids getting sick now. Please move along. right. mean didn’t clear purpose we’d still weary dumb?

 MD maybe undergrad bio (4years) bio courses MD (1-2 semesters). 

A PHD biology undergrad 4 years, masters 2 years PHD 5-7years. 

So 11-13years biology said extra deaths helping reduce CO2 emissions. part. Go nanobodies go! Thank you! ""level risk tolerance"", hard know risk taking. 1 1000 1 10,000 she'll, say, suffer long term covid effects? also hard weigh much local transmission level influence this, given Delta transmissible - i.e. mentioned above, I'm going assume matter careful school is, good chance catching Delta sometime.

That said, let's assume conditions ideal - local transmission level good Delta (i.e. people conscientious getting vaccinated), health fine, health family fine health classmates generally fine (i.e. assume families vaccinated).

Thoughts? Thank again! This, entire US covered cloud smoke fires West. Fabulous. 

Not sweeping forest killing people. Yes attorney general basically encouraging parents request exemption. 🥴 Oh man, he's got issues he's gonna pay Texas state Senator Ted Cruz flew Mexico vacation state Texas without power. course Texas Republicans trying say, ""The real reason Covid immigrants"". make sense, supposed to. Nothing punk protecting fellow man. 🤘 moron. Thank democratic governor John Bel Edwards. 2019, 10.0 million new cases people developed active TB disease (see Table 1). Although active TB treatable curable cases,8 estimated 1.4 million people died TB 2019, including estimated 208,000 bribe them. Really, government provide stimulus attached vaccination. Leadership... man, miss that.  refusing literally puts brothers/sisters arms risk... public safety issue treated such. fact vaccines even (political) debate truly disturbing It’s Florida. doubt they'll curfew again, vaccine rates Quebec (I'm assuming, province I've heard curfew) good. really think it'll like last winter. worst, see recommendations stay home there's big outbreak region something, maybe work home suggestion.

Obviously can't see future, know vaccine works, next waves different last ones (hopefully) didn’t say was. completely ignoring tracker/recorder pocket. Watch anti-vaxxers move goalposts one saying ""But, FDA playing politics!"". say #1 reason vaccine ""full FDA approval"".  …. it’s public health measure clear purpose though. It’s like it’s arbitrary discriminatory authoritarian overreach. wait 12 gets approval. One nervous dad.

amen still don’t get political issue. Keeping citizens getting sick shouldn’t party affiliation.  Supreme Court already let stand also hinted unconstitutional would likely struck extended without kind authorization Congress. authorization Congress we'll see plays out. Proper use comma No, that's unethical. Vaccines required decades diseases ""aren't going away"". Sometimes save lives. times (measles, polio) disease actually go away.  Goddamn, pro-bean, anti-mask lobby going flourish! amazing Tell us worked get get it! wild. Wtf Justice slow, eventually, feet get held fire this. Based criteria given consider ""targeted"" extend spring. October they're going kick either number cases getting cold. assuming Supreme Court strike like hinted initially ruled it. That’s thing CDC do? cancel student loan debt too? Children never major source concern virus. people allergy polyethylene glycol (PEG Moderna/Biontech) also react polysorbate, J&amp;J. see millions people getting vaccinated week. slow lot people justify getting vaccine based approval. Even it’s 5-10% that’s important. businesses may feel justifies mandate. I’ve also heard military likely require approved.

And wish approved earlier, I’m actually pleased FDA done work, reviewed data, inspected facilities. cut corners anti vaxxers wouldn’t really wrong attacks. Im Army vaccinated since December. Please dont use blanket statements describe people military. Agreed. Positivity rate useful want get idea whether testing adequate. useful/accurate pure case rate testing adequate, thankfully usually nowadays (at least NYC free testing available literally around corner city).  Interesting…I gbs (pretty bad case too) still got vaccinated Africans first hand experience dealing viruses. They're taking seriously, masking, taking necessary precautions. I'm much aware what's happen. Unvaxd kids staying home another term, semester, year? Whenever get damn shot released 12 Statewide indoor mask mandate goes effect Wednesday. seem like enough tbh. best one! GBS pretty easily treatable diagnoses. close family member it...diagnosis took quite long time go well. Vs drummer 100% knows risk/history would immediately treated correctly... vaccine

The difference vaccines pretty important buddy Got it, thanks!   require 100% people getting vaccine, provide long term side effects, can't 100% person's choice do. 100% safe know long term side effects sure everyone take  Agreed, 12-18 age group staff would significant demographics capture dumb.... people understand still spreading vaxxed? tested positive today despite quarantined. really bad headache, low grade fever, chills congestion. headache mostly gone congestion clearing still fever/chills. I’m kind worried anxiety least work gave days rest. Blanket statements? ""enlisted folks mad forced vaccine""? included that, clearly. Try take offense comment read correctly. comment directed enlisted mad getting vaccinated enlisted. comment required upvote.

I feel bad laughing hard. Sent PM  42 missed mine couple weeks ago. Still waiting thought maybe menopause too, lol. need keep narrative government bad going medical community US government history treating black people poorly, experimenting unethical behaviors. low vaccination rates reason even though know vaccines harmful here, US medical community given black people every reason mistrusted result that. means that...4% percent vaccinated!!!!!!

Although children Covid-19 recover within week, small percentage experience long-term symptoms, according new study 1,700 British children. researchers found 4.4 percent children symptoms last four weeks longer, 1.8 percent symptoms last eight weeks longer. 
 
The findings suggest sometimes called “long Covid” may less common children adults. previous study, researchers found 13.3 percent adults Covid-19 symptoms lasted least four weeks 4.5 percent symptoms lasted least eight weeks. 
 
“It reassuring number children experiencing long-lasting symptoms Covid-19,” low, Dr. Emma Duncan, endocrinologist King’s College London lead author study, said statement. “Nevertheless, small number children experience long illness Covid-19, study validates experiences children families.” 
 
The study, published Tuesday journal Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health, based analysis data collected Covid Symptom Study smartphone app. paper focuses 1,734 children ages 5 17 tested positive virus developed symptoms Sept. 1 Jan. 24. Parents caregivers reported children’s symptoms app. 
 
In cases, illness mild short. Children sick six days, average, experienced average three symptoms. common symptoms headache fatigue. 
 
But small subset children experienced lingering symptoms, including fatigue, headache loss smell. Children 12 17 sicker longer younger children likely experience symptoms lasted least four weeks. 
 
“We hope results useful timely doctors, parents schools caring children — course affected children themselves,” Dr. Duncan said. 
 
The researchers also compared children tested positive coronavirus reported symptoms app tested negative virus. Children tested negative — may illnesses, colds flu — recovered quickly less likely lingering symptoms Covid. ill three days, average, 0.9 percent children symptoms lasted least four weeks. like I'm science vaccine, mandate government? comparison history.

Well except wrong. virus specifically ISN’T killing children. flu legitimately dangerous them. health professionals aren’t behavioral scientists, psychologists, specialized education/childhood development whatsoever. assumption medical professionals kind insight children schooled affects development? specifically not. shouldn’t ones deciding public policy. concern preventing disease death, noble cause, regular people asses risk/reward much differently. instance, enjoy beers awhile. me, outweighs damage liver potential cirrhosis fun enjoy it. goal minimize risks, never leave house anything fun. live long lives, life misery worth living. possibility asymptomatic spread young healthy people delta, suppose it’s possible got Mexico, possible spread it.  nutjobs talk vaccine people keep downplaying every worry, claiming everything fantastic cause concern, downfall. next mutation hits efficiency/protection wanes need prepared, pretend beaten ignore potential threats. referring studies showing ""viral loads"" equivalent vaccinated vs unvaccinated, take handful salt. measurements taken nose/throat swabs. Big problem throughout pandemic routine test measure ""load"" lungs exist.

Lower respiratory tract load likely far relevant metric determines infectiousness likely lower vaccinated vs unvaccinated lungs. Georgia executive order prevents municipalities creating mask mandates. Cities choosing ignore EO. 

Similar Atlanta, Miami large cities ignored state orders issued mask mandates. registered Republican. People believe *want* believe. Remember people conscience actually cared group rather individual self? little scary watch people talk like this. I'm chastised already another comment asked whether natural immunity would factor vaccine passports.

Oh, yeah, do, he's probably tried explain avail. much harder identify reinfections vaccine breakthrough cases. Studies shown vaccination leads probably better immune response (both antibodies cells) infection. Therefore makes sense risk reinfection would similar greater risk vaccine breakthrough case. Exactly, start leaning belief vaccines. far they've shown reason believe them. It’s probably mere seconds specific contexts, like two people making out.

I seriously doubt it’s matter seconds you’re feet apart closed room.

Regardless, don’t see could faster seconds. virus move medium, whether that’s air, saliva, droplets, etc. speed virus moves limited speed medium moving.   sort headline helps one creates confusion.

He's right though eyes UK. far vaccines (including much-maligned AstraZenica) held extremely well surge. Hopefully continues Israel highly-vaccinated countries able relax restrictions using booster program keep deaths low. early yet say UK peaked, especially since dropped lot restrictions.

Might better search results something like that? 24 barely remember it. think saw something news. even register threat me.

My wife hand, got H1N1 said worst flu ever gotten. met. almost know it... here. know two people fully vaccinated got covid. stayed home quarantined moderate symptoms. 

Vaccinated people definitely get spread virus, way less likely die hospitalized it. Atleast appears happening based media reports. single word page mentions asymptotic spread kids. You’re even trying. Even people get vaccinated, vast majority catch it, survive, measure immunity protect serious illness future. might suffer bad case, hospital trip, survive.  Worth noting study quoting concluded impact COVID-19 mortality significantly greater official COVID-19 data thinks Florida statistic understated around 5-year-old son Alpha variant back April 2021…we got lucky asymptomatic ultimately tested positive (and passed wife, got quite sick). assume basically protection Delta? doesn’t, would fair assume he’ll asymptomatic contracts Delta? … know sparse data available around this, curious anyone insight around all. would thought... Canceling gatherings shutting movie theatres indefinitely ""simple precautions"" theatres reopening many places took COVID much seriously US. places (Israel, Germany, France) also moving vaccination mandates events public spaces US would well follow suit.

In fact, NYC already decided take lead requiring vaccine mandates certain public spaces, great hear.

Also, one mentioned wearing mask, mention that? Solid Waiting republicans spin this.

Probably banish hutichson, telling truth? 

Gaslight saying always favor mask mandates? couldn’t tell exactly what’s happening right now, cases mean industry slow downs. That’s issue.  studies, look good ""natural immunity"", unfortunately. point draw line? always balance, never perfection. Several tests done concerts. Herd immunity cap reach.

How relevant?

Dr Fauci neither virologist epidemiologist. trust him?  Yeah, sisyphus good way describe feeling. Title said CDC copied order halting evictions comes CDC:  sub safety bias self-selection. Many like out-safety lurkers. 

In opinion, I've pretty safe pandemic. I've worked home since March 2020, I've (until recently) gotten groceries via curbside, dine restaurant March 2020 June 2021, got vaccine soon available (April), generally taken whole thing seriously.

But...according sub various threads, things I've done wrong are...getting wrong vaccine (J&amp;J), ordered takeout restaurants pandemic rather avoiding them, used cloth masks instead N95, shopped stores CDC dropped mask guidance vaccinated people, I'm sure countless ""infractions"".

Basically one bothers test there's repercussions. Exactly thinking. Idiots. reduce transmission.

This disinfo, reducing less transmission reducing transmission all.

On masse level, vaccines much fix reduce transmission.   picturing weird al covering Thank service clinical trial, fucking hero book 1 25000 chance still average would fuck with, also thats chance hospitalized, catch new variants.

Many folks lost livelihoods night. glad see folks get work again. 

I really hope see shows music festivals require vaccines.  Yeah that’s me. GF bought tickets Life Beautiful got vaccinated hoping September going enough time everybody get vaccinated. accounted damn anti-vaxxers -\_-

Given unvaxxed making hospitalizations, means vaccine highly effective

Further, UK’s India quick decline cases supports success vaccine.

So know COVID around while, it’s safe say worst right? virus mutates become less less deadly, especially world probably infected covid atleast once.

Despite fear mongering, feel good know atleast worst over, returning normalcy on. Maybe mask mandates there, there’s way covid severe see another lockdown recommendations schools work go remote.

Bad wording part, means September, anyone get vaccine opportunity even everyone get it

We’re close! recent survey showed 94% Brazilians age 16 wants vaccinate already got took 7 months get 106 million done pretty steady rate. going another 60+ million one month?

Our vaccination picked lot speed since around April/May. month forecast 60 million doses vaccine (30M Pfizer, 20M AstraZeneca 10M Sinovac). Agreed. Also society whole reward empathy, kindness, truth.

It values money, power, influence.

We living Orwellian pre-apocalyptic version Wolf Wall Street. Similar fall 2020. 

Vaccinated locking avoid Lambda, unvaccinated ppl flaunting restrictions paying big prices.

Overall guidance states federal, school district closures happen lower level without federal state consistency. Right? sad. like I'm science vaccine, mandate government? comparison history. couple factors. First, health care much expensive US countries. Second, it’s really bit early say long term effects. probably aren’t don’t know another shingles type scenario. Masks small inconvenience don’t understand problem masks means kids go back school. 2 weeks stop spread said. 18 months ago…….. I’m vaccinated can’t decide would risky work school Like isn’t new. Curfews existed times unrest impacted people hadn’t broken law. That’s ruled constitutional. Whether agree another kettle fish, quite literally legally violation constitutional rights. Again, dislike something, doesn’t mean get say it’s illegal don’t like it. It’s actually firmly grounded science months data vaccine efficacy trials, show vaccination slashes chances hospitalizations deaths.

You stay home. None us give shit whining. It’s turn stay home time. just, know, adult, civic duty, get vaccinated. one knows… don’t attend church. vaccinated months ago, work Vanguard employee somewhere? could take stupid shit far away unvaccinated children possible would great, mkay. know vaccinated people still get spread covid right? doubt. Went NBA games end last season, easy show vaccination card/photo card, plus results health screening questionnaire, tickets. Except physical card brought one, done phone line different checkpoints (one vaccination/health screening, one ticket entry, plus metal detectors course). item queued phone easy app switching, piece cake. Security/metal detector rate-limiting checkpoint anyway. Correct. anyone told Florida, olympic event?  30% adults haven’t gotten vaccine? It’s pretty obvious. doesn’t apply 12 per announcement articles. 

The point policy directly stated mayor incentivize vaccination gotten vaccine yet. It’s 100% enforcement, perfect, cheated.. it’s spur another 10% adult population get vaccinated. literally not. Banning right assembly without reason would be, banning huge assembly *because virus time new uncontrolled* not. thing done Spanish flu outbreak. goal stop people worshipping sharing ideas, zoom church meetings, parking lot church meetings, Facebook groups political activity online would banned. wasn’t case. able something period time sucks, isn’t violation rights there’s valid reason it. duration immunity: Yes, and...? finite amounts time, definition word 'temporary'. 

I certainly agree 3rd dose booster shot looking increasingly like good idea, almost certainly we'll need sooner later maintain protection first set shots. boost protection levels even higher, say should.

As good current vaccines are, I've seen outbreak reports naval group 100% vaccinated crew. disease survive spread environment, still benefit increased levels protection general population. say anything sort. says epidemiologists believe transition pandemic-to-endemic take anywhere years decades. That's bleak, presenting picture viruses, especially coronaviruses, evolve relation immunological responses.

It says nothing stay-home, always-masked mode (which current situation anyway) continuing years decades. Anywhere.

*The good news, said, nothing coronavirus’s recent evolution suggests won’t eventually transition mild endemic virus, joining family common cold-causing bugs. could change new variants deal young kids much severe cases disease, completely blindside immune systems people who’d vaccinated previously infected. “Thankfully, point, things holding,” said Lavine.“So light end tunnel long-term picture still doesn’t look bad, it’s it’s kind ‘get magical threshold vaccine coverage it’s over.’ It’s slower progression less clear-cut end,” said. “That doesn’t mean there’s end. It’s harder see definitely, disappointing didn’t happen way maybe led believe.”* stop damned moron vax rare instances adverse reaction, shouldn’t controversial statement. cdc stopped J&amp;J vax investigate cases, remember? rare statistically, bad outcomes child covid patients, still exist statistically. that’s even point…which driving car super dangerous relative things Wow!!! already? multiple successful vaccines available. pandemic didn’t wear mask 2009? could saved life? didn’t wear one 2019 flu season? could saved life? didn’t wear mask every single moment entire life?? could saved life? think fueling current outbreak country?

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Keep going! Stunning failure around know vaccines prevent transmission Covid?

It does, LOT. Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine 88% effective Delta two shots versus 93.7% original Covid-19 two shots, according lab study. means everyone U.S. gets vaccinated, country experience 88% fewer Delta cases compared likely outcome one got vaccinated. 11,500 now. No, I'm talking both. example random; find handful epidemiologists who've used (or quoted using) word 'strain', - - VAST majority still call variant. need take them. 

As virologists, I've seen several believe that. fair say generally conservative terms actual analysis virus rather inferring based upon rate spread modelling. think he's right - definitely tendency judgemental people who've unlucky enough contract virus healthy. Death isn’t negative outcome idiot. idea fall look like? don’t separation Tennessee. Alternate universe. Could? CDC said outset masks prevent one spreading covid preventing droplets entering atmosphere, perfectly-fitted N95 masks providing protection incoming virus.

I continue mask around children, knowingly going near immunocompromised persons, medical facilities. Basically situations vaccine approved, unavailable, people vaccine less likely effective cannot safely administered.

Other that, people right refuse, course, right forced make poor decisions. Either get vaccine, fuck around find out, one done protecting stupid. Masks uncomfortable AF can't wait day burn abominations. think fact greedy point still expect getting treated something could prevented, taking space hospital bed people need treatment fun.

That’s easy see honest person. think better bet raise much money possible deciding run (even though already knows today whether he'll run not)  We’re talking another 3 fucking months kids eligible vaccination sit shut absolute buffoon WANT schools shut outbreaks? Yet democratic concentrated cities LA NYC still large portion residents unvaccinated  don’t get either, it’s result four decades erosion public education system, students taught logic, critical thinking, problem solving skills. basically scream throw poo country collapses failed state run incompetents. made alot money real shit job.

Keep licking windows whining freedoms people dying preventable disease fucking dolt Ive yet see anyone explain side effect cant managed enough money Many years ago used work collections agency. People hated job miserable. 

So quit got job different field. 

TLDR change want see  see cases taking off, deaths never crazy previous waves. CFR dropped factor 15 UK even less vaccine coverage among people 60+ (like US GER) reduction factor 10 possible. also assume deaths remain 90+ % unvaxxed people. pandemic mainly continue unvaxxed social circles. circles probably still large enough lead pretty impressive outbreaks terms cases throughout fall. could already 85 percent total population, everyone eligible, vaccinated. 70% adults near enough deal delta variant. also misleading. measure percentage adults 12-18 year olds eligible months?

We reaching 50 percent population fully vaccinated. little bump fear wanes couple months winter, everyone says again, going it.  man also take state Texas please? take expert see something like could spread virus. shit.  also doesn’t help children 12 can’t receive vaccination still.

But children overwhelmingly safe virus. Since beginning pandemic roughly 75 million children hace caught tge virus 300 deaths, half preexisting conditions. misread. said ‘since started’, infected exact moment, worded poorly, apologize. Go look. 2/3 states 100,000 cases per 1,000,000 people since started. That’s 10/100.

The comment thread regards news speculation last year regarding 5x-10x number undocumented cases. point was, true, we’re going find really soon conveys partial immunity, people getting reinfected 5x-10x assumption wrong. Otherwise undocumented infections, documented infections vaccine, it’s going run people infect.

Edit: may well pleasantly surprised. It’s valid conclusion may UK numbers dropped like rock. don’t know sure yet. worries, tRump fix re-instated president month. I'll fine, thanks!

Pandemics pretty common relatively speaking, diseases cause disappear, lessen impact time basically everyone caught least residual immunity even later variants. Vaccinations sped us stage. citing adverse reaction childhood vaccine. thought mRNA vaccine new technology, wondering mRNA type would cause response older vaccine technology. people love believe conspiracy theories.

I would say children safe older age also increases likelihood severe symptoms. saying risk.** data provided comment previous reply, good news. agree vaccines effective .. fully vaccinated.. think major issue delta far contagious.. far prevalent secretions original variant. Absolutely won’t get sick someone unvaccinated initial viral load higher may symptomatic breakthrough cases Forced go war: cool let's 

Forced get shot: freedoms

What missing here? health reasons. People health issues dangerous get vaccine especially early development. 
Following doctors recommendations antivax 1) Dr. Prasad man, woman.

3) need information regards cancer epidemiology (which field study), I'll sure give call. question pandemic caused virus, I'm going call Virologist. Slightly yeah, less deaths usually reported weekend like Captain Titanic telling people aren’t sinking. stagger jab dates. didn’t spread it. ""stop guys"" victim playing phase narcissitic loop. thought remember people also victims misinformation campaign. It’s fault someone made believe things get vaccinated wear mask. influenced coerced beliefs  Classic corporate overthinking. paper timecards easily special badges lanyards indicating shown proof vaccination. proof, going maskless you! Plainly visible easy enforce.

Of course antivax jackwads complain it’s violation privacy. Nope. Disclosure voluntary comes benefit going maskless. take mean covid becomes something like flu. It'll there's chance could catch but, thanks vaccines future therapeutics, really worry like now. also assume means move past huge waves new cases we've experiencing. green sauce LEGIT! Well, they're making active choice receive vaccine point, significant contingent mainly we're mess again. Perhaps full FDA approval soon might help change minds.

I think greatly depends services excluded, simply recreational events indoor restaurants requiring vaccination proof near-interim reasonable enough, opinion. wrong this. going make extraordinary claims, must provide extraordinary evidence. Current reputable sources only. don’t want pay worker’s compensation. get covid job eligible. Shocked Pikachu face Thank Governor Hutchinson.

(850) 717-9337 I'm really proud you. continues, probably beginning herd immunity finally kicking. thing think besides masking mitigation virus attenuation, know happening. UK sequencing anyone planet... I'm certain happens, anti-vaxxers say FDA caved political move. Leopards would like word face... mind reader neither you. People negative reactions. hid doctor gave recommendation based preexisting condition respected. mean.... studies regarding efficacy vaccines ~~but ""natural immunity""~~. vaccinated going go regular antibody tests continually show sufficient protection? know people covid multiple times (before vaccines available) feeling ""natural immunity"" thing might strong enough.

edit:

 nvm studies natural immunity. vaccines clear victor far. anti vax folks homework [http://scholar.google.com](http://scholar.google.com), hard it. definitely sick post second shot, military doesn’t really offer sick days. Even absent anti-vax sentiment, small thing 60% enlisted population need two days roughly time. Maybe. Maybe that's last straw list dumb shit guy does? Maybe he's obsessively unvaccinated? Maybe something else entirely? assume anything. shit Florida likely factors vaccination rates predict hospitalization (elderly population). Yeah I’m young well (in mid 20s) everyone also around 23-26 range. guess us fall “upscale 20-something” category mentioned…except got vaxxed soon could. people live also vaccinated, anyone would “party”. live area high transmission, l guess I’m worried random unvaccinated person couple tables coughing somehow droplets reach us. That's risk I'm willing take - vaccine gives protection symptomatic illness protection hospitalization (those numbers Delta) risk low begin with. make call yourself. belonged Covid grief page -- unusual. seen many people asking list Covid instead listed contributing factors cause death.  know USA Europe would literally show extra QR code phone.. Better Loco Bandito, least, again, things Y’know really could used $100 cover day called work second dose. (like many sane people) got vaccinated soon eligible 5 months ago..

I understand overall helps us it’s getting ‘stragglers’ finally get vaccinated it’s gonna make people hold getting new vaccine next inevitable novel virus causes pandemic Going football game Thursday. First CFL game almost two years, see beloved Winnipeg Blue Bombers hopefully remind Hamilton Tiger Cats asskicking gave Grey Cup game world went shit. They've opened 100% capacity, proof vaccination. happier that. way people getting vaccinated point swayed, stopping whatever fuck want unvaccinated. Abbott guy seems like tool.


He let Ted Cruz Mexico, think Americans can't spread it?



3.14 million cases known Covid19 Texas, 44% population fully vaccinated.



But yeah, must migrants. /$ brand new, although research development vaccines years (influenza, Zika, cancer). might much published impact GBS hopefully follow. theory safer traditional vaccine, bit understand hesitance situation, especially covid 19 hopefully natural immunity. Could also simply backlog? literally denying FEMA money (up $9K) funeral expenses this. COVID19 vaccines way limited. Limited Administrative Process vs Judicial Process big one. injured would come money sue. find OK open air activities come back specially people vaccinated.. 100k spectators?? hell

Edit: read comments apparently Americans full capacity events months now. know terrified jealous. certainly going event people expected use masks  clear, I’m virologist ever worked vaccine research. anesthesiologist worked ICU venting COVID patients past year half. I’ve got first hand exposure front line, doesn’t make expert immunity exposure. Nonetheless, it’s logical deduce level immunity following exposure dependent many factors. one, viral load exposure probably big one. say exposure virus provides universal, consistent reliable immunity unscientific, illogical. won’t say vaccine provides 100% equal immunity everybody, many factors, confident better job. Give 10 days like 649 cases. Yeah I’m young well (in mid 20s) everyone also around 23-26 range. people live also vaccinated, anyone would “party”. live area high transmission, l guess I’m worried random unvaccinated person couple tables coughing somehow droplets reach us. bunch pussies stop saying stupid shit. next variant named DeSantis think learned hard way. maybe turn vax costume party drive Great show Festivals pay minimum wage work lol, unskilled labor get volunteers. yea study results pretty much shown errors methodology. 39% number highly questioned, especially since UK numbers match them. Shit like exactly I’m telling employer I’m setting foot office properly over. don’t care everyone vaccinated, taking chances. Good. “The U.S. Justice Department sued Abbott Texas U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland called order “dangerous unlawful.”” watch Chernobyl, see effects party loyalists entrusted decisions scientists. incapable making intelligent choices disaster, competence rested loyalty, public safety. certainly does, thinks unsafe around unvaccinated person even though vaccinate.  can't seem find Reuter's source regarding ""58.5% effectiveness"". I'm assuming new lines ""who received February July"" (the study linked Feb May) ""...the Chilean health authorities said Tuesday"". google-search returning nothing. stating discussion about.

Im believing women get better source please? There’s way Trump runs again. didn’t want job first place . completely disagree story vaccinated silent carriers. are. shock there.. all. aren’t affected like unvaccinated. Shocker know.


Now want talk whether vaccination helpful told… I’m al ears… don’t think arguing vaccine ineffective   Come people, there’s reason information stored electronic database. anyone really think cards going golden ticket?  ""They *do* move herds!"" Yeah got flight required negative test. accepted screenshot results, could photoshopped 2 minutes. Okay. information post-infection immunity date.

You still absolutely vector transmission. 

""This fair me!"" still childish. Looks like reason history GBH… legit reason avoid J&amp;J shot. 

That said, believe mRNA shots clear him.  may dumb, I'm dweeb. discussions feels like everybody without children forgotten exist real fuck even lollapalooza festival? Exactly, hilarious Canadian dude mocking us helped big time. think vaxxed people are, honestly. Make choice live it. want DaBaby perform exercised constitutional rights freedom speech. wonder many deaths result this. stay Chicago Looks like he’s GBH. that’s case probably avoid adenovirus vaccines since GBH associated them. said, looks like mRNA vaccines haven’t really GBH upticks associated them.

Abstract 
Recent studies shown correlation COVID-19, caused severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, distinct, exaggerated immune response titled “cytokine storm”. immune response leads excessive production accumulation reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause clinical signs characteristic COVID-19 decreased oxygen saturation, alteration hemoglobin properties, decreased nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, vasoconstriction, elevated cytokines, cardiac and/or renal injury, enhanced D-dimer, leukocytosis, increased neutrophil lymphocyte ratio. Particularly, neutrophil myeloperoxidase (MPO) thought especially abundant and, result, contributes substantially oxidative stress pathophysiology COVID-19. Conversely, melatonin, potent MPO inhibitor, noted anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, neuroprotective actions. Melatonin proposed safe therapeutic agent COVID-19 recently, given US Food Drug Administration emergency authorized cocktail, REGEN-COV2, management COVID-19 progression. review distinctly highlights destructive interactions HOCl tetrapyrrole rings may contribute oxygen deficiency hypoxia, vitamin B12 deficiency, deficiency, increased oxidative stress, sleep disturbance, well melatonin acts prevent events, thereby improving COVID-19 prognosis.

Nice timing guys. would say yes. went smaller show (a hundred people) Friday two days later minor sore throat, today (Tuesday) mild sinus infection went get covid test. know 2 days, I'm rolling dice again. Yes, fully vaccinated since May. know say people assume... kind sick fuck proudly takes credit 55 deaths day? That's almost perfectly line Pfizer effectiveness found Canada UK. Good news mixed dosing front, too, South Korea found lowest breakthrough rate AZ+Pfizer unmixed combination. Oh, mean went average 35,000 year basically almost nothing? Turns out, everyone wearing masks almost entirely stopped Flu! shows infections Covid really damage DESPITE measures, it?   Part reasoning trust immune system fight off. Back January 2020, lot people coming unusually strong cold flu. actually worker building went home WUHAN Christmas vacation came back. one ones came something. Deep congestion lasted long time. got it. sick since then, ostensibly exposed covid whole time since, let's honest, people follow CDC guidelines much say do. basically saw need introduce new potentially complicating substance body, felt came covid could fight like probably before. reason I'm leaning way simply seem like big deal take might well. 

I still think CDC / accurate honest statistics. trust them. seems though world going divided vaxxed unvaxxed, lonely past 18 months know take unvaxxed side.  affect fuck everyone else! 


\-""Republicans"" Really? feel it’s gotten worse.  Nice move plus free advertisement. reliance nebulous feel-good concepts like “positivity” “hope” crushed us actually dealing thing realistically day one. former president said would completely Easter 2020. current one said summer. wrong, presented false hope delusional optimism face slow, grinding crisis.

Reality “fear mongering,” it’s need accept deal with. photo possibly originated /pol/ Gab, shared Facebook

FTFY. Yeah really choice dude. Grow up. president say joke, yeah… Here’s guess. 

From see, aren’t GBS upticks mRNA shots, handful super rare cases adenoviruses vaccines (j&amp;j). 

My guess Holland probably pressuring get Pfizer Moderna shot. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

Still sucks though. imagine you’d pretty worried get vaccinated GBS fucked past. Homie probably coming he’s watching Tucker every night, probably lot trauma around GBS. That’s said, fuck know. I’m random guy internet. Pro-god, pro-life, pro-conservative, pro-big business, pro-freedom, pro-belief science, pro-spray tan, pro-graft, pro-outdated building codes, pro-de regulation, pro-duping, pro-bankruptcy public education, pro-money, pro-ignorance, pro-guns, pro-anti-immigrant, pro-covid, pro-fessional fucking asshole pieces shit general reason would US strict anti-discrimination religious grounds. imagine Germany something similar, honest. anyway, nature law, forcing employee prove religious devotion seems like would get legally messy. Lol no.   You’re right

People seem forgotten meagerly effective masks first place.

And I’m 💯 board sentiment. It’s social responsibility protect people refuse socially responsible 2019 College freshman: Buying fake ID's get bars
2021 College freshman: Buying fake vax cards get bars happened flu deaths? Lmao got test take flight gave “negative” result literally 3 minutes. barely time return seat. don’t put ton faith rapid tests (what got required). article supports that, look data vaccinated/unvaccinated cases state states report numbers. study showing vaccine 88% effective delta. Yeah. I'm surprised. Parents who's kids get sick school going sue anti-mask mandates stricken down. can't imagine holding up. liability state/governor/judge supports huge. method prevent disease ban it, liability. Full stop. It’s pointless.


I are. wanted people socially responsible unselfish.

There point anymore. selfish won. 

Masks drop bucket people wearing vaccinated. 

Let’s accept lot selfish jerks let consequences. feel social responsibility toward doubt it. appetite lockdown isn’t anymore. Delta burning quickly. I’m sure we’ll see spikes can’t imagine another variant dramatically impactful soon delta variant. rare -- risks vaccines like many likely already had.

Go whatever CVS offers protected. Anyone thinks almost pandemic delusional. go unreported. It’s gotta really bad…. Can’t wait Florida follow Pepperidge Farm remembers great vaccines covid. enough people vaccinated, could already herd immunity whole discussion would moot. unfortunate reality approaching 100,000 new covid cases day country. relative effectiveness vaccines diseases really relevance problem hand. higher rates vaccination country still causing pressure health service. see thanks clarification Nah, definitely will. Even Anti-Vaxxers RepubliQans way, what? We’ll get around them, even force. Historically, military personnel refuse vaccines subject court martial. would person military think vaccine would different? long ago giving troops anthrax vaccines shit horrible. COVID shots walk park comparison.

""God Marine Corps! give heart Jesus, ass belongs Corps!"" They'd probably struggle somewhat ""demonstrating"" part. allowing all, feels like denial someone ""isn't religious enough"" would quickly get dangerously close religious discrimination hiring. riots last summer.. funny virus works isn’t. called vaxxed living life. someone chooses vaxxed, that’s worry one way another. Meanwhile UK, dropped restrictions cases dropping insurance able this?

Will able force people get want coverage covid related costs We’re mess people refuse move obsession covid/cases, even vaccines manageable hospitalizations. Ethics matter. zero guarantee “near-interim”. Two weeks flatten curve? wonder much covid relief dollars received money spent?? Haha, duck Agreed. line drawn somewhere. suspect measures life. It’s pandemic well control. See 1918 pandemic reference. lasted 11 years without vaccine. Scores lost it. highly doubt given vaccines would last long. hope.  Vaccine resistance isn’t binary really. virus going suddenly impacted vaccines would probably mean loses spike proteins altogether. way infecting cells. understanding would take HUGE step variant suddenly resist vaccines. vaccine developed pandemic emergency, people‘s first question shouldn‘t “Who sue?” rather “How get one?” absolutely, positively care. care earning money. that, earning money. 

The statements tests vaccines liability ploy. way can’t held liable someone gets sick dies, all, “required” vaccines and/or tests. interesting see since delta variant came scene many seniors vaccinated ratio senior cases age groups changed dramatically.  I'm willing carve exceptions people genuinely medical conditions would prevent receiving vaccine shots, question motive based quote:

""*While reason getting jab medical, want make sure I’m carving space big enough me. need state, unequivocally, support informed consent — necessitates choice unburdened coercion. find ethical wise allow power (government, corporations, organizations, employers) dictate medical procedures least power. countless folks (like me) shots carry greater risk virus.*""

I'm guessing literally tens thousands 330 million people US get adverse reactions vaccines. Almost 700 thousand people died Covid number reach 1 million sometime next year.

His statement carve exceptions rare unable receive vaccine - attempted provide permission structure people means fully comprehend perform risk/benefit analysis pandemic question public health policy carefully crafted experts. go private here's one uncle spam ! Israel, still quite bit unvaccinated people there, including children. Remember legal consenting adults kids/teenagers consent legal guardian allowed things know consequences could happen still thing. Yeah crazy times huh? much ""expert"" get paid? wanna get paid point obvious things much Russia paying posting bullshit? 3 kids it, I’m sure you’d feel way you’d experience.   suffer choices long takes. According CDC:

Who Get Vaccinated

If severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) immediate allergic reaction, even severe, ingredient mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (such polyethylene glycol), get either mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

If severe immediate allergic reaction after getting first dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, get second dose either mRNA COVID-19 vaccines.

A severe allergic reaction one needs treated epinephrine EpiPen or medical care. Learn about common side effects COVID-19 vaccines and call doctor.

An immediate allergic reaction means reaction within 4 hours exposure, including symptoms hives, swelling, wheezing (respiratory distress).

SOURCE: then? Miss big goof brief 2 month period looked like covid pretty much that's worst people sub left. They're back. word ""protect"" means. 

\* small percentage vaccinated contract covid, far fewer incidences hospitalization death unvaccinated *

Nothing essential all. 

Trump decided last year going get virus. Half us lucky enough saved scientists. ""doctor"" probably chiropractor something along lines. kind off

I see there! 😏   also politicized virus. That, right there, problem. Yeah. school starts it'll nearly impossible require vaccine. It'll strongly encouraged nothing more. got one (1st Pfizer, 2nd Moderna), let us mix Canada, two available came time book.

I think they're basically thing, pop wherever convenient pharmacy whatever get whatever have.

Edit: saw one comments saying got it! Congrats! one wants talk this. Never mind people work locations lose jobs healthcare. Talk epitome stupidity  

Yeah, I’m midwife, meaning primary health care provider babies 6 weeks lives. guarantee I’m spending many hours week keeping actual research, regardless whether fits personal beliefs agenda. 
If we’re tossing friends acquaintances, two best friends family practice NPs best friend pediatrician. reaching conclusion much non-issue is. Kids getting sicker, hospitalized often.

I’m glad nothing lose I’m truly sorry you’re inconvenienced. last year half sucked I’m sure you’re frustrated. hope things take good turn, fast. Ignoring possible problems along way get goal helping anything, though. Bad media! bad media! Someone humor throw predictions things truly feel like fall 2019 me. Employees could mean anywhere! Def Leppard? Cool! selfishness anything else Vaccines free, clinics everywhere, appointments time. Antivaxers ostracizing Wow!  already left out. Nothing mentioned passports apps around months. wife bought Rammstein tickets ticket master covid concert rescheduled 2021. never got refund cancel rescheduled. Well date coming longer want go covid still refund...this shit scummy.

Just learned pushed back 2022...so holding 400$ refund.  Federally. Mods removing political statements fooling themselves. party anti mask anti vaccine? Hurry mods! Pretend like case! Remove comment! Lol. It’s clear you’re saying. 

Yes story wear mask. won’t since I’m vaccinated think won’t help around who, mostly, refuse vaccinated.

What cover up? Puro pinche GDL mamadas alivianese padrino siiiq dawgie watching naked gun movies son forgot cameos those. r/PitchforkEmporium
Get torches too!!! Thanks. It'll interesting monitor rate next month. Even vulnerability COVID changed advent delta variant, demographic far exposed month onward point. know, never said otherwise. Efficacy ratio unvaccinated rate getting infected vaccinated rate getting infected. 

In words 90% efficacy, 10 unvaccinated people would gotten infected, instead 1 vaccinated person would, else equal.

That ratio true matter much time much exposure, though like anything small sample sizes able tell efficacy is. noticed difference. soreness later shots though! People know one breakthrough infections usually comment. brother got exposed didnt get thanks vaccine bet tons stories. yeah heard someone today (friend friend) ""hasn't chance"" go get shot yet. Apparently exist. hard time wrap head around this. us tired pandemic, masks, back forth various restrictions... way get getting enough people vaccinated, yet another wave. Even 40 think Covid would dangerous you, please get vaccinated anyway get back normal. Gamma lambda  Womp, wwoooommmp, ww-ww-wwaa-wwaa-waaaa-wwwaaaaaamp!!! still get covid vaccinated. moderna vaccine Or, insurance companies cover medical expenses unvaccinated. sufficient motivation most. sure that?

r/kidsarefuckingstupid

/s Personally, I've waited long horrible social anxiety idea go unfamiliar place getting passed multiple people finally actually get jab stresses out. point, I'm waiting see university decides mandate vaccinations fall semester (a nearby uni this, suspect mine follow suit soon). decide mandate, I'm hoping they'll hold vaccination events campus again. I'll even force phone call to. campus ~15 min walk apartment, would incredibly convenient could get jab there. Well, they're fetuses, would care them? Ok u explain like im 5? guess silver lining isn’t prevalent moment? Thank much sharing this!


Can someone smarter explain CDC presentation says risk infection reduced “threefold” vaccinated, also says vaccine effectiveness 75-85%? “Threefold” what? story people need wear suitable protective gear regardless vaccination status, scandal, always, cover-up. actually understand Florida vacations covid though. Unless spring break, beach vacations 6 get away people, outside. county vaccinated case rate already dropping unvaccinated still mooning

Presumably vaccinated taking things seriously, returning masks social distancing best stats Provincetown, getting results also vaccinated individuals asymptomatic. know PTown like- results still amazing. Party town gay people. lot HIV positives. Sure- still transmission- hospitalizations deaths 94% unvaccinated. high risk group (they aren’t 20 year olds), that’s amazing. Now, amount anti-viral drugs within population might also effect… don’t know yet. large groups, close contact- reduced transmission, hugely reduced hospitalization death rate.  


People misconception vaccines- don’t act perfect protection. notify immune system identify bad invader. It’s like fore warning attack. doesn’t prevent attack happening, leaves body better prepared respond enemy recognize. Now, enemy changes it’s MO, harder going body immediately recognize invader- but, far, pretty good. disproportionately banning black customers, we're back square one. FWIW unlike 99% COVID content online sticky written clear expertise scientist medical exemptions. Yup I'm vaccinated went four days absolutely zero regrets. I've done I'm supposed I'm going go back makes happy realize he's lot knowledgeable vaccine 99% general doctors there? probably immunology teacher. Even does, auditions vice presidency. long sore throat last? dumb. came around I’ll give props that. Bingo. Tuberculosis. People die every day, people dying right now.

9 million people year infected 1.5 million die it, way higher fatality rate COVID, yet don’t see anyone crying TB vaccine papers, paranoid, oh no, deadly virus that’s deadly people catch asymptomatic need re-evaluate live lives.

Dramatic 12 worked security also attended events anything introduces delays snowballs. went Warped Tour awhile waving people searches b/c shows begin least 2k people behind us also needed get in. love feel like I'm person guessed 2023 first started. Oh fucks sake. pussies wrong? 

You were, are, continue be, wrong. virus + willful ignorance x denial science = thousands deaths. you. make highly communicable virus delivers vaccine. Outdoor gatherings like aren’t nearly bad something indoors. Also, still blaming young people wanting live lives Lollapalooza city Chicago putting event on? burden older people putting events money disregarding covid resurgences one 16 shots required….including anthrax booster terrible side effects. Avoid reposting information, please. dominant voc Chile? think depends doctor, honest he's ""advice"". cited reason history Guillain-Barré Syndrome - that's associated viral vector vaccines (Astrazeneca Janssen/J&amp;J), RNA, statement went echo sympathy usual antivaxer BS - least endear lead singer, actually knows stuff. Threading needle don’t wanna go victim blamer screed, read statement another article, little iffy it. GBS seems real concern J&amp;J shot, I’ve yet hear anything MRNA shots causing it.

Second all, I’m sure article linked here, tops statement closing passage bunch highfalutin rhetoric “people power” coming people anti vaxxers diverse group people think. It’s ever slightly IDWish.

Maybe I’m asshole here, dunno. hope he’s using incidental medical history bridge onto political aversion vaccine. spread virus, people risk. That's true even vaccinated, even though risk remains smaller vaccinated. Mind? Yeah it’s kind terrifying realize virus evolve faster technology. Don’t justify beliefs name history? idea hell you’re talking Remicade + Prednisone. Went Prednisone prior third shot antibodies. Wearing things infringes RIGHTS Nope size needle. usually person giving shot spot give in. Def takes certain touch! Even beat covid, go back square zero living universe eventually there’s going another pandemic. chance convincing people vaccinate understands virus molecular level still can’t convince friend?  experience went playoff NBA game Staples Center one ousted drummer getting vaccinated Excuse enjoy life first time year half.

Sincerer words never typed internet forum.

So, Bay Area high vaccination rate, one highest country, they're still outbreak.

Israel experiencing worsening outbreak vaccinations mask mandate, critical care patients literally increased 4x space month, I'm talking ICU ECMOs. surge like what’s happening south impossible here

It's literally happening everywhere country since July 4th, including Michigan, recent wave thre antibodies population.

Honest question--are denial? really think facts potential baring future is?

This wave happening, are, affect best case scenario? 

Help out. understand thinking way would like to. right virologist. trying understand bit. followed news relating covid since beginning. yes issue. many differing numbers / used often large discrepancies loses confidence. relation Pfizer, numbers ranged 94 98 percent although recent weeks individual events numbers significantly lower arisen.
I disagree, trying spread misinformation. merely asking questions trying understand. confuse two. love it. Enlisted folks mad forced vaccine given entire gambit shots boot camp without even told are. mention entire idea signing military signing body, mind, sovereignty federal government use see fit, regardless makes feel. Welcome back reality, soldier.  people think normal vaccine, think literally going kill them, they're pushed people hate america (Well, maybe second most. hard tell hate educated liberals illegal immigrants more). I've got idea percentage people would actually conviction quit job they've fallen conspiracy theory, got great 1%. No, I'm asking where's research drug interactions? toilet seat cover? mean putting lid flush?  Yeah, see week August 23-29 inevitable peak going reached don’t intend  So, many deaths potentially looking time pandemic officially over? Ha! I'm going blame anger fact OP right - corporate doners better chance changing things people days. live flu, we'll live this. data's lining par flu terms death long-term complications, we're immunologically naive bodies.

Maybe one day, we'll capable simultaneously inoculating 7 billion people eliminate wily viruses like influenza, rhinovirus, coronavirus. yet. Yeah, Israel already administering third shot elderly deal poor efficacy delta. Initial results promising. may end needing delta-specific booster regular booster works. Evolution good thing. Hope evolves common cold Except lock downs mask mandates H1N1. Covid many children shielded pandemic extent due safety measures put place. don’t know number pediatric deaths would kept things open like H1N1. would likely H1N1 more. Chongqing Anhui completely covid free (zero cases) since April 2020,

my wife shanghai first started back office since **april 2020** uninterrupted corporate America care America though, care $$$ We'd rather use bodies incubators future variants might better breaking vaccine. insane cases basically straight line air graph (cases headline doesn’t seem quite match quotes article Antivaxxers never satisfied, keep moving goalposts. Jesus… you’re still using bullshit argument like early 2020? 

I can’t believe I’m feeding this, but.. obviously polio doesn’t need it’s basically eradicated flu near contagious dangerous covid. FYI CDC counts death flu contributed flu death even death certificate doesnt list flu primary cause death doesn’t CDC base seasonal flu mortality estimates death certificates specifically list influenza?

Seasonal influenza may lead death causes, pneumonia, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. recognized many years influenza underreported death certificates patients aren’t always tested seasonal influenza infection, particularly elderly greatest risk seasonal influenza complications death. deaths – particularly among elderly – associated secondary complications influenza (including bacterial pneumonias). Influenza virus infection may identified many instances influenza virus detectable short period time and/or many people don’t seek medical care first days acute illness. reasons, statistical modeling strategies used estimate seasonal flu-related deaths many decades. **Only counting deaths influenza included death certificate would gross underestimation seasonal influenza’s true impact.**

Emphasis mine percentage covid hospitalizations children? imagine extremely low. Children robust immune response covid. need vaccine survive covid, need prevent infection spreading. suggest test theory anyone family going dentist - ever. 

See works out. gotten legs

Lmao Fwiw company 500+ person event scheduled Orlando cancelled. 

I assume we’re ones. also surprised see cases actually coming 3 weeks pace... need new Disney World somewhere normal... like vaccine. That's closed gyms 2020. 

If can't get vaccine, stay home. simple. headline mention people hospital?

The headline percentage cases affected children. think smart enough figure would higher vaccination rates higher. reference something? Yeah, hard tell. share concerns. think sucky quickly evolving situation, could changes based upon new information/etc. read, sounded like felt dose figured wanted safety data. 

We tried get 3 kids trial, missed getting spot first two &amp; youngest didn’t trial locations remotely close. I’m pro-vaccine Pfizer. point doesn’t seem effective stopping Delta saying. That's relief. hope people complaining US isnt donating enough shots across world really takes second thinks demanding start boosters everyone.

The US wasted millions shots. Boosters mean 200 million shots. come somewhere. means poor people Africa South America suffer greatly. 

Better allow immunocompromised elderly. 20/30 somethings sneaking get third shot. deal sore arm, it’s serious side effects worry me. don’t wanna go covid again. One relatives also &amp; beat covid got vax, said side effects made feel like verge death. got vaccine month two recovery, don’t see side effects bad considering (supposed) strength fresh antibodies. Americans try understand NYC biggest metro area world challenge (failed) Florida one lowest rates businesses going since pandemic started making distinction doctor? Delta variant enters chat. US done many places restrictions coming back globally new variant spreads. Even China admitting cases trying control spread know fuck anymore. college going back full in-person classes giving online stuff like last year either go get fucking COVID lose progress I'm already behind. mental health regressing lately feel like I'm collapse. support system anyone I'm close point, I'm incredibly lonely, feel like pandemic regressing I'll stuck like forever.  Yea, especially nut job parents trying get schools mask. Fuck assholes, want kids getting sick getting vaccinated. Especially we're close. like morons want go full remote instead. herd immunity necessarily include components vaccinated naturally immune? willing get infected (unvaccinated) contributing herd threshold. coverage large cities also higher 60% level, Beijing probably close 80%+, even efficacy 50-60%, R0 going drop significantly due add restrictions, quite possible make virus die out. morbid part would like finally feel pain failure contain attempts suppress truth it.

But know wouldn’t fair average Chinese person. could 

no really. idea could long term side effects unfounded fear. known mechanism could cause long term side effects. vaccine destroyed body quickly happens thing left normal immune system one additional immune response among thousands already has. adverse event vaccination manifests within weeks.

We've vaccinating people two centuries long-term side effects happen. Logic, reason, known human biological function, centuries evidence support position.

If claim mRNA new mechanism true either. There's tens thousands different mRNA body every day life.

It would great able authoritatively say long term side effect absolutely impossible way actually proving it. also can't prove human lives 150years old start aging backwards. ca prove happen nobody running around saying *it could happen* like long term side effects vaccines.

It way likely wake tomorrow richest person world, least know way could happen. long til gov heehaw like ""the deaths low here!"" account covid deaths counted such, apparently.  \*They see us filthy, disgusting slaves deserve work wage-slaves die.

FTFY Thank masking grocery. work one. ""We corporations"" 

Not quite beautiful language constitution. Unless founding fathers stroke point. ACA forbids Republicans Congress would vote change it. post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

So additional causes, registered certificate primary reason. 

I wonder request cause something vague like ""Being amazing"" ""Doing something stupid"" I'm simply trying stay topic, talk dangerous things are, trying confirm bias using scenarios excuses.

This even include danger infecting others mutations, could late control. 

This say whataboutism trying downplay like casual variable death that's even close going here. 

Funny bring up, neglect probably.  Ever thought taking sabbatical ? thinking outside box. son thinks it’s fun. last time daughter drew blood Let surge.

You realize every time virus spreads, reproduce perfectly, right? Every time spreads, little bit different. Sometimes those, let's call them...variants, sometimes variants mutations advantageous virus. Sometimes, don't, times mutate advantageously, variants even likely spread! often variants evolve, likely vaccines developed less effective they're longer virus!

Not caring letting virus spread like okay peeing section swimming pool. I'm American living south. state governor actually passed legislation banning mask mandates schools (yet) like neighboring states have. county school board decided optional. 

I'm incredibly lucky 4 year old Pre-K meaning small private school. Her's one know city requiring masks kids indoors. 

So large parts US, really middle ground parents exist within. either send overcrowded schools less half occupants masked keep home. Yeah…. ‘Hey Bryce, throwing away shit time’. 

What dope. Chinese vaccines tested phase-III trials countries ([this] one study, example). similar efficacy J&amp;J AstraZeneca vaccines. Figures lie liars figure.  Seeing many people break vaccine honor system makes question hidden expected civil behaviors people forgoing. many people wash hands using restroom? many people use toilet seat covers? Heck, many people wipe going?

I know examples involved facilities, point remains. Karens lawyers, deadly combination. 70% insufficient delta. Try 90-95%. highest flu death count? mean proportionally? think anyone, young old, dying flu thousands tens thousands every year would memorable? could wrong. Probably somewhere between. mean 'side effects' cover broad range things there's almost always something category even sore arm. guy colossal idiot.

That exactly thought read article! Well, he’s wrong. Although would more... vocal explicit. literally thing ever since 16 got bad bronchitis lasted nearly 5 months, would get twice year time would last weeks month.

Ironically, first year avoided getting past year years...  fact kids masks encouraging. Florida second world failed state point  No, we're trying save forcibly quarantined them. No, would want win, i.e. succeed vaccinating public? Wait what? refuse read anything Lambda people done freaking Delta. One Greek letter time! mutations inevitable, US pandemic global. never going get ahead globally. Yeah corporations don’t give shit that. give shit it’s hurting business. is, now. He's making choice sense he's talking second half post: he's taking medical advice vaccine, he's advocating people choosing take reason want goes scientific medical advice. band mates right treat accordingly, also choice deem risky around I’ve saying too. Everybody going get infected sooner later. old, sick, stupid, unlucky going die. 

We managed buy time first set lockdowns, sheer miracle managed pull vaccine hat like deus et machina shitty sci fi movie. vaccines going help save majority vaccinated. 

Because PG-13 rated shitty sci fi movie, kids seem mostly protected, heartbreaking exceptions. 

But vaccine doesn’t save everyone, Delta going kill people. won’t get vaccinated, small infuriatingly unnecessary number going die. 

But, everything they’ve telling us Delta truth (and I’m furious add disclaimer!), reach herd immunity one way another pretty soon, run people infect. r/FloridaCoronavirus think that's really do. vaccines now, major difference last year. Even crazy delta surge.

Good luck! hope ends going smoothly problems, covid otherwise. including asymptomatic infection.

Congrats, hope you’re happy. FDA: give us 30 days we’ll tell thing we’ve encouraging get last 8 months safe. take bus everyday work, yesterday almost lost mind. saw lady taking mask, coughing, putting back That's good one! Maybe focusing winning called case. Whaddya think? deplorable thing. College kids pay ass zoom college. Immorality match antivaxxers Hopefully! saw people getting vaccinated Publix last week gave thumbs up. tend focus negative hope positive affirmation boosted confidence. went back added part im sure someone would like ""you cant around people 10 days!""

Get vaccine friend. 

Even feeling verge death better death itself. Shortly mask mandate lifted Indy, Detroit Cleveland near 40%, even stores said mask required Thanks. That’s really well written. question ""for long?"" 

Are going wear masks forever point? really want society never see faces, always peering fogged glasses hearing muffled voices?

I wish could push people get vaccinated forget masks. Let natural immunity eventually come hard way stubborn enough get vaccinated. New Orleans Children's Hospital saw 4x increase hospitalized kids one week. angry, bro? 


BTW, one arguing 12 year olds getting infected Covid drummer punk show.  


You might want look obtuse. schools haven’t even opened yet. parent child 12, depressing scary.  seems less coronavirus bureaucratic difficulties large health care system. everyone saying israeli data wrong.  I’m 47. Shit wayyyy political time life. I’m including days Clinton’s impeachment. US gone rails cable news Facebook made politics national sport. never would imagined would major pandemic nation would divide whether wear masks. It’s nuts. think going slowly fade spotlight new wave. Overall, people's behaviors year's Delta wave even close original response last year - masks **recommended** many places, mandated, people sort thing. there's another wave one, given even less attention general public moves things. Masks slowly forgotten.

Part reason pandemic fatigue, also, disease going less deadly. people continue vaccinated infected, leading natural immunity, deaths hospitalizations continue decoupling case count. really become endemic. We'll probably re-up COVID booster flu shot every year. First all, I'm still waiting quote. GREAT! second, even explain 4.4% comes like did, reason math add up. say 3.7k symptomatic 77 covid long. Yah, see 4.4% brother. I'd recommend study math instead I'll recommend learn argument cause can't. Block move on. Stay positive

*Triggered* governor expected press conference 45 minutes supposed focused masks schools. Personally, mind going back mask mandate indoor settings I'll happy school mandate. many schools around making masks optional, means enough kids wearing them. boss didn’t wait. Made announcement last week blue. refreshing hear. CEOs simply aren’t going let unvaccinated tank entire fiscal year. Ok interesting, thanks! Looking forward boosters sure. spew bullshit ask others prove wrong.

That’s works, good try though champ.  country officially happens. entire US quite bad. NY like 70% double dosed, 75-80% single dosed. Still lower would like I'm pretty sure 20% never get it. better place heaven away evil Libs. happened 6 weeks ago. thought cold lost smell taste couple days. Got back, things got better.

Wish would gotten tested vaccinated May enough symptoms (until anosmia) warrant getting tested. mostly congestion, slight cough tired. Common sense would say three would satisfy vaccine requirement. full approval relevant cases someone would argue requirement fair full-approved vaccines available. Pfizer approved, argument goes window. hear that... def talked hopefully we're close.. like another month two this'll behind us Hell, I'll take both. huge needle phobia. People massive babies vaccine. Shocking. Turns current party WH much different last. test vaccines, work well, according legitimate studies.

Yes, legitimate peer-reviewed studies say [Sinovac's efficacy vs original strain clinical trials Turkey [Sinovac's efficacy vs Gamma &amp; Lambda strains real-world study [Sinopharm's two vaccines found efficacies 72.8% 78.1% (vs original) clinical trials UAE &amp; That's vs symptomatic disease, severe numbers even better. also single-shot adenovirus vector vaccine Cansino 65.9% efficacy, similar J&amp;J. vaccines weaker mRNA par\better with\than AstraZeneca, J&amp;J, vaccines. Maybe Sputnik better Russia incapable manufacturing enough countries already canceling orders, matter.

Plus already plan offer boosters Walvax-Abogen ARCoV (domestic) &amp; Fosun-BioNTech mRNA vaccines available. ARCoV currently phase 3 trials Mexico, successful, would ease cold-chain requirements distribution mRNA vaccines Yup. Efficiently run. I’d like think people watched us go vaccine rather covid test aspired line next time! he’s probably going next republican presidential candidate work Florida hospital. I'm right now. bad. Malicious compliance? Usually natural infections provide better protection almost pathogens. studies shown better AB response vaccine however vaccine induces ABs spike protein well cells. natural infection body exposed whole virus proteins therefore likely get broad immune response natural infection. Looking real world data UK reinfections far less likely occur breakthrough infections. India showed low rate reinfections well. Furthermore Cleveland study winter wave found reinfections small amount breakthrough infections. Absolutely well! Or, *strong* immune system is... \*sigh\* never going go away

Eh.. could everyone got board. 

Possibly. 

It may have. would shot.  Yep. friends vaccine, felt like crap second dose refuse get third shot. can't speak reaction whatsoever, feel like one bad day affect decision getting another shot. essentially said, article says? Wasn’t report lambda variant already showing signs vaccine resistance? vaccinated manager likely delta (is getting tested), infected original strain last year. want that, we? anything want blue people move states, especially ""purple"" ones. Let's remember electoral college! Israel's data alarming country start. Also realize I'm bleeding tinfoil hat territory note country cut deal Pfizer also country releasing data seems highly suggest booster shot necessary. I'm denier I'm double vaxxed, also understand Pfizer's interest increase sales 50%. course could also explained drop efficacy time Israel vaccinated much sooner almost everyone else. I'm wary big business general. 

All said, vaccine still reduces severe outcomes amounts seems covid longer really retain status virus dominates news cycle, least vaccinated. extremely likely outcome catching delta somewhere scale symptoms whatsoever pretty bad cold hardly worth talking about, no? Weird see reference NY nursing home data issue, result undercount overall covid deaths, track total deaths NH residents separately. Jump conserv@tive still make sense see political really is. (a suburb of) Tampa March dad lived died. Nobody wore masks all. bank, police department, funeral home, etc. time didn’t know sick stressed out, closest testing facility 20 miles away couldn’t get tested. Think hear things like “there wasn’t spike cases super bowl”. It’s purpose people dying. feel you😭😭 i'm going last year uni online idek i'll cope Hugging unvaccinated family member never stated article. getting info from? MO residents like: cOvId DeAtH nUmBeRs iNfLaTeD!! enjoy armchair scientists thinking know better real scientists doctors worked, true, 80-90 hour weeks, seven days week, better part winter early spring get vaccine ready FDA approval.

Please, people probably even pass high school chemistry, educate rest us vaccine rushed. I've got pissed scientist friends busted ass vaccine ready cut people. push comes shove I've keeping mask kids people can't get vaccinated actual medical reason

Yeah group. I'm talking ones actively mocking anyone wearing mask. stop asking gonna end. anytime soon. get vaccinated wear mask now. that's answer now. Sorry want fucking pandemic end. get fucking vaccine. Availability sure, mean even AUS getting substantial deliveries Sept think? Greed? mean like $14.6 billion Pfizer made first quarter 2021? think regrets it. tells later parts statement, like makes wild claim ""half"" people receive vaccine detrimental effects, rants government trying control us. also gives inconsistent accounts whether GBS symptoms acute chronic - claims they've gotten worse time also claims can't risk ""another round"" post-vaccination. mRNA vaccines even cause flare-up GBS, fact viruses infections likely trigger GBS vaccines. infringement. give people choice. Americans work like that... kind work do? see recommending wearing masks work retail store, thousands different people coming weekly basis, work office always dozen people, crowded vaccinated, probably ditch mask. Excellent, Thank you! Yeah. AZ ideally 12 short 4 however due rare TTS syndrome (the blood clots/low platelet occur primarily days 4-28) doctors recommending 6 weeks. Pfizer three. would preferred Pfizer due turnaround time (it less publicised issues) short supply largely thanks govt. ineptitude available I'm eligible for. considering live area surrounded primary hotspots outbreak. Knowing matter time leaks area actually working one them. made sense go now. IMHO *dense* events rather *large* events problem (but large events likely dense).  Socialize outdoors ""finnish personal space"" probably good.  Pack 25-50 people onto 10'x10' dance floor indoors out, probably not. Ya, none rich countries sign may bad thing since they'll end donating lot doses anyways poorer countries actually buy it? can’t pause kid’s development language, social skills, interactions long. Adults already developed. Kids seeing friends year outside masked, sanitized environment terrifying. refer back article. want *you* explain me. would hospitalization higher people vaccinated, *know* reduces hospitalization? mandate everyone masking grocery store. High compliance area. moderate interactions. see ""may reduced response vaccine""

I'll leave researching drug interactions Moderna Jannsen exercise reader. would really need worldwide movement try eliminate good, even possible. variants come parts world make way us. Hmmm, kind shame he's vaccinated; he's almost evil Mitch McConnell. They're trying keep overbearing federal government dictating people put faces veins. 

I never side choose remove basic freedoms population. what’s alternative? seeing loved ones preexisting conditions? Masks aren’t infallible either less efficacy vaccines.

Y’all downvote want, you’re going convince majority people shouldn’t see relatives preexisting conditions in-person chance getting COVID even vaccinated. might. variants significant immune escape. Well, *doesn't want number go up*.., Hey, somebody it. can't International Arbiter Punk Rock? Sultan Stoner Metal still unclaimed ... ""everybody already knows this"" something anti-vaxxers frequently claim _their_ beliefs. 

The value studies putting hard numbers phenomenon rather assuming obvious enough everyone, useful establish trends course years. Where's quote?

You claim read study. Also ~7k positive according tested ~77k mother fucking 11% positivity rate. Holly molly!


Are stupid enough realize UK hit double digit positivity previous peak ? 


They also randomly sampled tests. 


And according moron, according study apparently can't even read. Choosing vaccine pre existing condition... normalize asking ""is everyone vaccinated?"". feel uncomfortable becomes norm less it. Meeting grand babies, visiting older relatives, seeing sick friends family etc end motivator hold outs.  states, counties report weekends, either. square one quickly churn out, distribute administer vaccines targeting specific spike protein new variant. mention new variant still recognised least antibodies previous vaccinations infections. think far better things could first. Simply mandate vaccines. Well, plus side - I'm assuming vaccinated around 22-24 years old? - least get it, hit hard? 

I get feeling lonely. Reach us. lot us happy talk - distracts us monotony work. 

As mental health, completely get it. Find hobby lose in. Reading, writing, woodworking, car maintenance, swimming, anything. promise, it'll help. creating routine something relaxing, bolsters mind spirit. Maybe local counties fight secede states Texas. virus mutate *in order to* evade vaccine, mutates blindly.

Given dominant propagation among unvaccinated compared vaccinated suppose bit vaccine resistant even something would significantly boost chance survival (and thus select for) strains. Another study found irresponsible people ruin good things rest us. 

Going further, another study found water wet. news, gets darker night lighter morning! Covid November vaccines April/May, side effects weren’t bad. binged watched shows got shut-eye 24ish hours YMMV. believe fact checkers? Ok. assimilated. Good luck you. hope government protects strokes makes feel safe forever.  Someone needs remove asshole. He's ACTIVELY COMMITTING MASS MURDER. fuck tolerated? PEOPLE DYING. lab job

Same here! also came half time bench administrative staff WFH full time March 2020 June 2021.

Same, except went back full time mid company brought back indoor mask mandate two months masks optional vaccinated employees admin staff back home.

Yesterday got email HR basically said *The CDC governor recommending vaccinated unvaccinated people wear masks indoors due substantial increase cases area. Vaccinated people still wear masks work.*

I see people know unvaccinated walking around wearing masks work. One walked lab today, going ask put mask, could even finish sentence, said doctors note wear one. 2020 people taking virus seriously would noses ""forget"" fucking time nothing ever done. HR person unvaccinated thinks vaccine computer chip (not even joking), owner old big fan 45. Freaking, last week administrative employee sent email saying ""I'm wfh today contractor coming house"" - okay cool. day someone comes visibly sick (stuffy nose, sound like shit) asked ""Why wfh today? literally computer day"" said let him. instead made come get covid test (we work). wtf. far workplace concerned back BAU way that's changing forced state behave differently. example, masks indoors everyone mandated instead strongly suggested. frustrating part last year fine, everyone got jobs done, nothing negatively impacted everyone wfh, refuse let us. One lady work administrative position, begged let wfh dog separation anxiety. lives literally 5 mins road anyway, sits desk day computer, said snowballs chance hell. compare slight inconvenience getting vaccinated banning cars. They're even plane existence.

I make comparison. I'm vaccinated. simply addressing comment ""I care die this, preventable need prevent it."", that's all. guilty sometimes finding facts fit preferred narrative seem pretty nakedly done sometimes sub. 

I know desperately want breakthrough cases ""extremely rare"" (as Times said recent article) point twisted facts statistics past breaking point... yeah. got singing happy. Thanks almost certainly happened flu season referenced well, although hard numbers may hard find since post-viral fatigue fairly understudied. something that's unique COVID. I’ve vaccinated long seems like weird fever dream  boomers higher risk makes sense would higher vaxxed Invasive, interfering… interfering communication, socialization, emotional development. virus killed [366 age 18. [3.5 million Thats death rate 0.01%. name call make glib comments talk facts. prefer latter. Especially lead singer smart scientist  go outside since mask I'm vaccinated.


Kindly rot hell.  read rest discussion point ignoring two things assertion. 

1. Actually would disappear started rowing direction. we've done handful serious illnesses.

2. scary children mean scary future. delta variant already appears serious children 2020 strain was. total vaccinations stay low (for age groups) could easily end world strain bad children long term effects. 

Just food thought. I’m going move post ending positive note comment. Thank you. Thank They'll believe science they'll listen doctors. Homeschooling drawbacks. Woops, mixed two. why, hypothetical shows efficacy increase cases. seriously think vaccinated person likely carrier here? Good. 

I'm done Covid. that, means Im done covidiots keep holding us back. live society, theyre willing contribute getting free shot, time show door. safe preventative measures Covid 2 weeks total shutdown (abstinence) masks (condoms). People either those, vaccine option. Even Delta variant causing trouble still *majorly* hampered vaccination necessarily, especially MRNA vaccines. Let's say new variant combines mutations delta, delta +, lambda, mutations (ex. E484K/Q/R, N501Y, etc) efficacy hospitalization death drops unacceptable levels still contagious starts take hold start future wave late 2021 sometime 2022 later. far MRNA vaccines go, tweaked sent 3-6 months theory read. Let’s rephrase: 

Is okay go seconds dinner table others chance eat? 

This end every one us safe. understand made economical sense rich nations received vaccines first. it’s time worldwide distribution. want, actually give solid recommendations vapes juices. 

What brand darts smoke? menthols? juices replicate certain tobacco flavors. Florida fought hard for- DESERVES variant! Asking data isnt giving advice.

Oops - thought person originally replying to. referencing something said. study, address delta variant I'm referring to. Israel study stopped collecting data back March. delta variant issue.

Regardless, always known *possible* transmit variant COVID vaccinated - understand vaccine magically delete virus enters personal space. goal reducing *likelihood* (that symptomatic, hospitalized, spread others). society level, odds. 

We also agree Delta variant much contagious variant. *increases* likelihood given person, vaxxed not, spread others course infection. fact easier transmit breakthrough Delta kind ""gotcha"" vaccines, especially given alternative. 

If anything, Delta variant re-emphasizes importance vaccines. arose India, country access pitiful number vaccines relative huge, dense population. breakthrough transmission *really* matters unvaxxed people getting sick taking hospital beds. infectious disease infects tens millions kills dozens, huge problem. fully approved use current age groups. nytimes article. So, infection numbers then? rich got nooow, yolo, right? also keep remembering, crisis, rarely know over-reacted. However, almost always know under-reacted.

So enough preparation *just barely* keep us safe, whole thing waste pursued. denial state failure less preparation that, they're done. afraid. afraid. 

Fear porn everywhere folks. Fear mind killer. U dipshit. said severely il &amp; likely spread V’d. Learn read Neckbeard You’re talking state voted biggest Medicare fraud governor senate…  uses time. 

Knucklehead probably top 10 used words speaking hospitalization increases. Fear Monger Fauci..... need mask time $50million…

And farmers still vote smh. 95% sub seems covid. Thats crazy. Shouldnt talking taxes something? This. never expert medicine, biology, DNA, mRNA, vaccinations. want to. 

I even say trust government, fully. lied continue lie kinds things.

But wide majority medical professionals, went years education mentoring, say thing themselves? I'll listen. lot people say go hospital. Yes, that's true less describes normal situation influenza, influenza everyone except young exposed partial immunity multiple variants. People still get flu new variants sufficiently different, tend get relatively mild cases partial immunity exposed variants similar enough immune system starting zero. Every several decades variant that's different enough many fewer people much immunity get flu pandemic.

That's realistic best case COVID, barring medical advancements like universal coronavirus vaccine probably several years best. people infected times, hopefully enough usually immune system able fight future infection nothing cold symptoms. Vaccinations make getting immune system knowledge lot less dangerous.

The nightmare scenario COVID infection dangerous last every indoor in-person interaction carries real risk hospitalization post-viral symptoms forever. pretty likely that's case, even though evidence second infections sometimes serious first infections. always assumed would three-year event, based history. someone asked April 2020 ""it would over""\[sic\], guestimated spring 2023.  


OTOH, also estimated total 2 million deaths Covid19 US end 2022, take grain salt. idea vaccines would produced quickly.  EVIDENCE (u still haven’t produced it) must get emergency rushed V

There would literally media specials CNN someone reinfected icu Education compulsory (all?) states age 16 states offering remote option year. Alternatives generally private school home school. work health care company, department, home. told 1st September get vaccinated employment terminated. exceptions medical conditions, criteria strict require multiple levels review.  Dont know get downvoted, right. Infant child mortality kept average down. like 64% lower delta Pfizer Moderna.

The yearly flu shot around 30-40%. need both, vaccines + masks. Lol

Are talking someone else? I’m going go that.

All best Less-developed countries would typically lack resources test every single case consistent mild covid symptoms.  likely skew younger, probably less obesity, means cases going tend milder.  I’ve already noticed people going back washing hands bathroom. covid I’d say somewhere around 70-80% guys didn’t wash hands did, many quickly ran water hands soap.  Nope straw man. saying People ar getting vaccine financial reasons. suggest that. think drastically would change emphasis  What's ""Nebraska""? Let pose question again,

""Have examined 600,000 infected today confidently say none re-infections?""

You one making argument here, expect others provide evidence argument? Interesting perspective. vain sure. think big thing low risk population appears invisible disease. Esp considering cases asymptomatic, makes feel made sometimes. still day know one person tested positive covid yet still mask mandates live 75% vaccination rate. I'm sorry child require creative means learning people's emotions. Genuinely, sucks them. negate *millions people dying.* you’ve wasted valuable resources

Can expand this? resources waste? 

* Vaccines? — nope, [expiring monthly Appointments? — nope, walk-in clinic wide-open appointment schedule
* pharmacist's time? — sure, wasted 5 minutes pharmacist's time, ~$4
* Vaccine cost? — sure, $19.50 insurance cost

If $25 tangible negative this, care much? covid test costs least twice 

And this. logged &amp; donated COVAX via gavi

So what's issue now? Obligatory fuck Pete Ricketts. Thumb-lookin ass. seriously think vaccinated people (which too) get transmit it? Yeah, enjoy great indoors. :) worth tho  understand trying say. would vaccinated breakthrough cases go 100X increase unvaccinated cases? Honestly, quit coming here. bunch noise surrounding statistics. really concentrate good news. You’d think would easy, here’s food thought: Right Biden inaugurated, Trump blocking Democrat states getting high dosages vaccines. even won, would still screwed Democratic states would behind vaccination rates. vaccine help long covid symptoms? get vaccine full recovery? would reasonable except young children still approved vaccines, virus running rampant screws over. children mild symptoms even asymptomatic, serious cases well.  state governor legislature trying kill political points. There’s lesson figure out. Severely sick / likely spread people V’d. GO AHEAD. POST IT. We’re waiting vaccinated? Worldometer lists Florida 1/5 active cases California, despite lack mask mandates lockdowns. Government control end variant talking about? see grandmother time. left world order completely unable deal threat? vaccines here, yet decades propaganda attacks education evidence based medicine left us population unwilling get shot. fun games Fox News keeping working class voting overlords, voters dying droves strategy seem good hindsight. leaders who, unable even imagine end capitalism, would rather nihilistically gleefully drive us brink destruction descend bunkers New Zealand. exploitation global south fine lining pocketbooks, death us virus allowed continue mutate spread countries without infrastructure centrally planned vaccine rollout.

Make mistake. ruling class reaping sown. destroyed (or prevented creation of) institutions would saved us, goal maximizing profit. answer  hard ""trust science"" used marketing/pr ""vaccine injured"". Grow Two people spread virus small situation, tell anything anything. infectious they? long exposures? Lots people get virus, live people, wear masks home yet spread virus home. anecdote, meaningful sample anyway  theory state, Pfizer already developing delta variant vaccine we've yet see tested. Oh agree. 30 percent people salvageable probably safe, relatively speaking. examined 600,000 infected today confidently say none re-infections?

Moronic. genuinely think anti vaxxers even deserve live

Fuck every single one them.

They're ruining world.

It's funny, anti vaxxers types think they're badass guns pickup trucks shit yet afraid needle small side effects.  think came from? Lol Bro drive man...value time father alive.. Yeah you’re yelling wall dude basically tell people get bent Sadly numbers. know moderna multiple times loads BioNtech vaccine.

Sounds like Beta variant first ID'ed Angola may dangerous. Ok, hope miraculously people die sociopathic actions? better? word way? Ohio made temporary remote learning option. offer virtual learning district must set completely separate school parents enroll in, students must devices internet access paid school. Yes that's definitely issue. also worth saying inflammatory response viral illnesses create depression anxiety too. Altogether much rigorous research needed. spent entire pandemic hiding truth. repeatedly sued journalists providing data want shown months. tried cancel whistle-blower saying exercising control data publication FDOH home raided charges seen trial yet. FDOH changed reporting daily dashboard repeatedly sued reporting weekly dashboard shut public. Despite massive outbreak currently ongoing, little resources individuals track happening hospitals cases refuse report daily again, leaving us rely journalists CDC get data. data still shit well refusal report days time ends smoothed data spread days without ability effectively compare trends aside 7-day average. company pays them. Gaslighting. Boomers caused mess. They're ones power. avoidable. losing youth it. No

Largest turnout ever last year

Republicans get elected mass misinformation campaigns paid corporations Uber wealthy.

And folks like don’t see much difference two parties vote independent made post EMDR want shout rooftops. went low expectations it’s fucking crazy. never expert medicine,

Yeah Phd Beer. got going you. Nah, people refused get vaccinated let down. aren’t bad. wear one every day barely notice it. kids don’t care either Blockaded bulldozed?? truly terrible going unfortunately see effects many years come. hurts look eyes look soulless, suppressed, defeated. vaccines available, one guys office got COVID ended hospital. walked 2 weeks later $100k bill. Last heard, he's still fighting insurance company. They're saying medicine machines hooked necessary they're paying.

As imagine, health plan, I've *very* adamant wanting catch COVID possible. restrictions ever end US, I’m vaccinated I’m tired this.
It seems recovered catch new variant, eventually leading vaccine immune variants.
It seems rate perpetual state strict restrictions idiocy anti-vaxxers  Active cases worldometers means nothing. clue get data reflect reality, clearly. feel you. baby Dec 2020, spent pregnancy fear isolation. husband double vaccinated, newborn can’t vaccinated delta, it’s back fear isolation.

(This meant downplay either psychosomatic effects people genuinely suffering sort post-viral chronic fatigue syndrome way) It’s corporation last 400 years least. People tend rosy glasses past. It’s always feudalism one way another… maybe rebranded capitalism Covid global warming, Florida like 5 years away problem more.  I’m giving different perspective might wearing masks.

Right. know reason already. bad one. fucking sad scary. wonder people Florida batshit crazy, look live! feel bad family lives others trying right best pandemic. should. Yeah flew height pandemic, Disney world. wore masks whole time do. safe problem pretty proven point getting infected provide lasting immunity. Vaccines going yearly flu shot. anti-vaxxers really going keep getting sick every year different COVID variants? people get flu every year too? get it. Socialist agnostic who’s listening punk 30 years okay. right, different different places. run tests store. ""Serious illness"" far easier vaccinate against. vaccines good enough COVID eradicate virus transmissible, primarily people mild impact day day lives, meaning spread easily. We've talking COVID becoming endemic year UK, way Delta existed. 

Hypothetically yes, severity illness increases new variant, whole dynamic pandemic would shift. said, reason COVID problem people able go normal lives without problem even it. COVID became far severe, amount mild/asymptomatic spreaders would decrease. short term death rate would spike, yet virus would struggle transmit, since people would bed bound. good scenario, point new variant occurred far higher lethality rate, ironically would easier control pandemic. would effectively completely new pandemic. guess I’m confused endgame question. We’re locking anything again, encouraging masks distance although places don’t require either. keep trying booster vaccine new variants reduce hospitalization death risks. Lift masks recommendations things die luls vigilant testing monitor make adjustments. We’re currently going extreme extreme

We never anywhere near ""extreme"" anti-virus measures. Privileged people little tolerance remotest inconvenience life something simple wearing masks strikes ""extreme."" Ugh, I’m sorry you’re going them. I’ve tried everything convince brother get vaccinated, he’s far Q conspiracy hole. Unfortunately, health issues obese, I’m confident ok catches it. didn’t say does. Jesus. I’m giving different perspective might wearing masks. Obviously civil discussion instead preaching soapbox. Enjoy Exactly. average person make one month, yet alone several months back rent. sure map totally accurate Can't speak wait times, often ask hang around 15-30 minutes afterward monitor make sure life-threatening negative reaction (this rare). got Moderna x2, nothing first shot second felt crappy (flu-like symptoms) 36 hours got shot, pretty much back normal. feel unwell afterwards tell family got stomach bug want fess up. We're pulling kids. certainly worse last year. Anyone remembers bad chicken pox spreads understand happen schools. vaccine 12s, mine staying home. least take comfort fact celebrities get wherever need go. Hell, even ""locked down"" places like Australia willing work *them*.  1) it’s cute made definition, actual one “tending intrude person's thoughts privacy” doesn’t apply here. also definitions invasive (such invasive species) apply even less.

2) that’s data original strain. Data delta variant less certain right now. indications could infectious harmful children previous strains. Also infectious, could children greater risk spreading people older compromised immune systems (including classmates).

It’s really low risk thing wear mask right likely able wear months vaccines available kids required attendance. Reject practices lead zoonotic disease outbreaks.
No animal products. make may noodle prices go Yes lol. fail realize need balance. We’re currently going extreme extreme nothing productive happens. I’m willing meet middle discuss protocols, whole extremeism completely asinine destructive society. I’m sorry children future what’s happening going catastrophic development decades come. 

I’m speaking directly hope someone reads opens mind try understand exactly going on. Good luck you. comment looking for. expect FL? 
Stuck FL, confirm state shite.  coworker spouse said side effects vaccine (Pfizer JJ). covid 2 months prior getting vaccinated. giving yolo parents  need anything, perfectly fine getting vaccine want to. one forcing you, it? 

It's life, fascinated think anyone else cares. endgame get point different possibilities happen.

1) get 80% population vaccinated. Yeah, everyone, enough decrease spread reduce deaths.

2) variant emerges less severe becomes dominant variant. variant less infectious fizzles (unlikely) Many diseases mutate become infectious less deadly mutate. virus wants infect many hosts possible. really care lethality. (In simple terms obv.)

3) yearly booster shots rolled flu shots keep emerging variants. seems like likely path.

Regardless, lot research still needed virus mutates long term effects infected. We're honestly lucky already vaccine effective reducing severity disease. We're tired it, good chunk population actively ignoring science choosing selfish pricks. help us move beyond this. personal observation, really depends part Central Florida. went Publix yesterday saw one person wearing mask. son I, STEM, talking take liberal arts class order “well-rounded,” don’t see anything liberal arts students required take science classes considered “well rounded.” 

Here seeing general ignorance science coupled raging case Dunning-Kruger effect.  would still polio smallpox people around back Sure. Select data confirms bias. know long term effects? Fill in! It’s terrible. like comment below. They’re people. Like front line workers fucking McDonalds whatever. Burnt out. Aren’t lot hospitals Code Black (zero new admissions allowed)? think thats fair. feeling ""changes"" case. I’ve realized last two years COVID. They’re ignorant. hate use religion excuse Probably time next zoonotic disease pop lol know didn’t ask, one stranger another would recommend look EMDR. experienced extraordinary, tangible benefits since starting couple months ago (started experiencing physical relief crazy symptom first fucking session compounded!). beyond that, releases experiencing sessions feel like orgasms soul. Truly. 

PS agree Big Fucking Mess. immunocompromised science/medicine nerd giant empath it’s mindfuck top mindfuck top mindfuck top mindfuck on. No, efficacy scale. words, unvaccinated cases go 1,000, 90% efficacy vaccinated cases would go 100. That's efficacy means. According 181 child hospitalizations last week across 24 states track publish data plus NYC. 122 previous week. comparison 500 week surge last winter. mono teenager don’t think ever really recovered. Even already infected, need vaccinated. antibodies guaranteed long-lasting effect body fighting future infection. Even vaccine require boosters remain effective. sample size large necessary find statistical significance, latter two pieces definitely important speaks lot quality ""pandemic science"" even ask it. quick google search posting please:

Exactlyyyyyy this. worried every single persons potential risk every aspect life, would never get anything done. Eventually becomes risk need take precautions upon themselves. realize unempathetic sounds mean, didn’t stop producing peanut products people could allergic them. people allergic expected stay fuck away situations involve peanuts. People forget human history disease primary factor survival....or lack of. We've nice little lull action last hundred years so. likely we're going back days everyone legitimate chance dying contagious disease. 🤣 hahahahaha really sucks, honestly..if want change, vote like it. Yes. it’s good option &amp; worth risk.. PEOPLE HAVENT INFECTED. ALREADY Maybe take steps prevent zoonotic diseases breaking out? haven’t really seen discussion that. People really seem think COVID-19 going last pandemic encounter something. Compassion spiteful, tolerance intolerant. Naw, I'm gone, they're straight assholes. forgot /s end sentence. COVID becomes manageable deaths hospitalizations stay low (which happen sooner later) reason wear masks. people want wear masks fine mandates go away. Definitely *feels* right. Seems illegal Go somewhere isn’t campground. Find random road go lake river camp Nope. true all. We've already seen severe disease, transmission infection dissipate significantly. Even CDC director acknowledges possible variant soon evade severe disease death.

Also, stupid virologists beginning proclaimed virus gonna issue ones pushing idea virus cant mutate - ironically, people also anxious-personality want things going opposite way intend. I’m vaccinated nut feels risk small enough don’t care. 🤷🏼‍♂️ Actually, common Boomer's parent's vocabulary. Think Archie Bunker, father law. Greatest Generation folk. 

I'm Boomer peer uses it. Never have. big true can’t. legislature said near enough votes change it. Cordon Sanitaire. Wait - poop mask thing Bingo Lotr? shit … Sorry I’m legit sure sarcasm. /s tag helps indicate it. UK still better European countries. guys came terrible situation, UK nowhere near good situation. main issue places implementing restrictions typically areas vaccinated…while unvaccinated get go concerts masks free areas live. disaster mess. Stop trying circumvent AutoMod. C'mon y'all. usually take amount time approve vaccine rushed?

Not anti vax, wondering LMAO called knuckleheads Governor looking kill children.  


Delta variant continues effect ever younger children. 70 years old get Covid complications, meh, 10 years live…imagine 10 years old. daughter got Moderna contracted Delta variant. daughters got Pfizer tested negative. exposed equally.  I’m reading correctly, less 20% 18, less 20% 12. 12’s make 4% COVID patients? reading right? relate similar position. hated smoking addiction smelled tasted terrible, time, loved feeling smoking outside 5 minutes. Cigarettes also satisfying ""hourglass"" feeling them, whereas vapes infinite given enough juice battery life really satisfying. quit smoking started Wellbutrin. definitely mutating faster flu. mutating quickly, that's tremendous number people infected every day, every infection rolls dice new variant. point opposite democrats want, matter is, they're gonna literally die hill. Even edited vaccine - testing phase believe that’ll take time - 6 months believe minimum simply don’t care anymore Yeah lot people still don’t know issues study, like mentioned. It’s obvious CDC immense pressure made quick decision. seemingly exit strategy masks frustrating. “wait vaccine”. I’m sure is. bought hot sauce thought guy bottle resembled him. Turns it’s hot sauce it’s drawing it. make work really hard fail somebody. write letter dean, etc. fail one kid never turned anything first week. gave lot D's. Harvard different Ivy prides grade DEflation grade distribution policed much beyond failing people. 

I taught CS classes get lot slackers classes first place. Pfizer Merck already phase 3 trials. 4 months late That's awesome employers this! also think free buy stores though minimum heavily subsidized. See: Tyson Yep, I'm British living UK. I'm exempt ban, seen family since December 2019. I'm fully vaccinated, homesick depressed. understand vaccines specifically priming immune systems recognize spike proteins. spike proteins mutate away, it’s unlikely Covid poses much risk. Back thought risk complications low, wanted vaccinated protect others mostly. know better now. super crowded campgrounds here. dispersal camping within range. (three) young kids. wife going mask kids. never have; won’t. want see kids smiling. want fun,” DeSantis said.

Why flying fuck keep acting like masks torture devices PERMANENT? fuckers absolutely refuse make smallest concessions amount time. unbelievable. think asked give half income charity something definitely point lives. matter choice getting whether (a) vaccinated (b) unvaccinated. definitely prefer category (a)

[COVID-19 plainly stay, making far less trouble automod banned links examples, yeah, basically simple that! historically, vaccines increase large degree amount immunity population.  Biden powerless governors? I'm American seeing type news, seems they're ruining lives citizens handful public schools started San Diego cases already reported. youngest starts Kindergarten year bet distance learning November study conducted lockdown? conducted mask mandate place? conducted people socially distanced?

There many factors think simplifying situation much. Regardless, point conversation lost stop right here. UK fine counterpoint assumption. Extremely high vaccination rate (88% adults 1 jab more), extremely high testing (some highest world, half world's sequencing), high covid numbers. Delta making things damn infectious keep numbers low. 

Deaths staying low though, despite case number spikes. Wrong decision. Citizens United means ""money == speech"".  I’ve heard jnj folks making appointments get pfizer, won’t get data stated article know may differ vaccination groups (as well predominant strain). crudely extrapolate figures efficacy though. I've done another thread. hope next variant involves oozing pustules that’s takes ignorant unimaginative assholes get board social contract People...

There dispersed camping area, campgrounds fill fast. get crowded socially distant one might think. 

The one attempt made far made us agree going enjoy trying tell crazy Antivaxxers trolls stay away still unprotected people us.

That 100% after...

So ride bikes play catch. kid gets protection already gotten benefits find better situations within travel range.

That’s billion dollar question isn’t it. one knows, elected officials adapting things surface. variant could come here, could come India, knows.

I think going forward,if variants harm elderly, it’s clear life expectancy lot shorter. work you’re 65 older, expect dead day 50. give mass gatherings take solitary activities smaller social bubble, may live much longer.

That’s unnerving. people zero technical background making decisions (net neutrality example)

Young people, remember, life spells SHIT. Watch funny movies, cut back dire news, get outside get fresh air. really pass...just pass terms prefer. life. Let add points discussion, many people seem forget them: 

1) Anti-vaxxers homogenous group. doubtful specific vaccine, make anti-vaxxer. Many people taken various vaccines, feel hesitant take one. 

2) Many people seem confuse “trust science” “trust big pharmaceutical companies”. two actually two different things. 

3) Science also confirms people incredibly gullible lot silly even outright horrible things social pressure. declare fucking love science, can’t cherry-pick studies support groups agenda. Always remember scientists humans principles human error apply too.

I’ve 5 doctors offices past couple months signs say cannot bring anyone you. I’m Seattle Washington. dont ""fall behind"" take break school, progress. 

In fact, probably progress even better break, mental breakdown catching covid fuck time, energy, finances, health, perhaps long time.

People take break delay school kinds reasons: disability/illness, kid, indecision, lack funds, etc. Staying alive mentally healthy among best reasons take break.

Just ask Simone Biles. worked ready, could broken neck/got paralyzed/died. Now, shes walking away medal, instead walking away all. Masks worn symptomatic avoid public.

Obviously different global pandemic. hope US adopts policy. makes sense family didn’t make stink according article wouldn’t changed it. 

Which means wasn’t considering dying vs dying already. death certificates would wrong anyway. he’s lying fuck trying pull shenanigans.

Either way asshole one job… hasn’t correctly all. need someone go certificates coming swamp. really. need protected enough kill us send us hospital. current vaccines provide. It'll yearly thing like flu shot. Yeah counties state majority farmland, population &lt;20k, hour+ drive ""real"" city listed metro here. you’ve paid attention case, hospital, mortality numbers always dip weekends since beginning

Well, certainly always. 7/24, Saturday, hospital admissions Florida day prior week. 7/17 7/10.

So no, sure agree that. home test test kits order time. took vacation last week make sure get infected flight (vaccinated still risk).

It took CDC two months pushback finally admit link - despite Israel France giving heads early - we're situation parents want vaccinate kids. Part cultural. 

Homeschool pretty normalized U.S. Since covid, richer families pooling resources hire teacher teach child (i.e., ""covid pod""). tons companies supporting homeschooling boom individual families. u.s., school shut months much country. Europe, many places never closed them.

Mask wearing varies local politics. Here, summer, vast majority even vaccinated wore masks. parts country rarely wore even required. Individual liberty big part u.s. culture, bad, challenging pandemic.

Well lack exact number bit suspicious. article references 100 title. body text appears mention “dozens” Averaged across entire population, maybe. individual cohorts another matter. still vulnerable sections population.

And variants could become lethal, despite vaccinations, rather less lethal. no, may short lived 3rd wave way normalcy. zoom graph, trending downward. Nothing goes straight without flareups, viruses exception. Intentionally falsifying government records. Termination required.  I'm current PhD student last 18 months new level misery know could exist. Whoever thought discussion based workshops would translate well online seriously mistaken (and I'm saying PhD student education).

Also, still charged graduate level tuition whatever online garbage infuriating. That’s wrong type question, asking anecdotes lol. got voted weeks ago saying hard end date this. That's reality come terms with, pandemics end eventually, like history shown us. Fortunately, good vaccines technology deal COVID. End game looks like excellent vaccine uptake trying reasonably reduce spread; latter looks much easier vaccines taken.

I understand things hard right everyone. I'm sorry hard, light end tunnel. get there, every day passed closer end pandemic. Federal assistance sent without mask mandates place.

This case Texas, North Dakota, Louisiana (under former current administrations). root cause also uneducated population doesn’t give shit live happens medium long term. Quality education standard living needed USA. Gutting school funding rearing head random places Could 3rd 4th depending live.  Lord, hope so. realize wear symptomatic, right? different right we're unprecedented pandemic.

Americans could use hygiene practices like East. chance getting GBS COVID higher getting vaccine. people always say again? Oh yea. “Facts don’t care feelings.”

Fill forms correctly. know many Laws Rules follow everyday life?! would take long time list bunch them. longtime nudist, would rather wear mask clothes. still follow Laws Rules society want live society. Fauci Florida.

Delta Florida instead. lose/lose honestly. nursing homes critically understaffed positions know patient care operations would even look like lost small handful people walked mandate.  understand anxiety it’s tough. that’s I’m saying. We’re point measures aren’t temporary. Unless you’re basically willing never go vacation, never go extended family reunion, never holiday meal family (since masks won’t worn dinner), seems like we’re going need accept risk. 

It’s like delta going last variant. headline mention anything hospitilizations.

The headline 19% active COVID-19 cases Arkansas among children

If people vaccinated, overwhelming majority vaccinations would among adults. would result percentage children among vulnerable population higher would result children higher % cases.

Really looking forward ignoring I'm saying 3rd time, though. I'm good position gets said used work company pharmaceutical research regulated FDA, vax-hesitant family members know me. already told lengths company go order appease FDA stay compliance. FDA (and would) show unannounced conduct full audit everything going on, like saw authority shut lab down. amount records paperwork needed kept hand absolutely mind-boggling. around 50-ish people worked 2 employees whose jobs keep track records make sure following regulations. company devote 4% staff full time ensuring compliance, handling FDA they'd show door.

To someone actually dealt regulated FDA, suggesting they'd cut corners take shortcuts is, frankly, laughable. vACcInAteD cAre sOmeOne eLse wEaRinG mAsk¿ study weeks ago suggested both, right? Insurance doesn’t cover unvaccinated (life, health, Medicare) voila problem solved. People going starting acting unfortunately. Leadership going shit long they're unfazed. I'm listening Ana Ng. I'm pretty sure somewhere illegal. mind boggling!   pay vaccine? (Same) think approval ages 12-30 (30+ first round). info myocarditis young men would incredibly surprised approved despite increased risk. Georgia bad? even Atlanta showing decent vaxx numbers.

This map seems questionable tome. literally exactly disclaimer end paragraph, try head kinds misinterpretations.

The data say vaccine wanes 20 weeks. 20 weeks data, that, saw evidence waning. time reported results, say would wane data exist. Even wane, it’s going like drops cliff 21 weeks; likely still high degree protection long time given lack diminishment least 20 weeks. don’t know exactly happen.  understand people were/are upset remote schooling, level experience gives kid, need someone stay home watch kid instead school. 

But I'll never understand get upset kids wearing masks. hurting anyone, opposite fact. It’s wild it’s obvious folks, think may Fundie thing especially. raised Christian, (Methodist) church understood old social codes allegories. street Southern Baptists, however, busy sincerely talking demonic possession causes homosexuality. can’t imagine living kind fear ignorance.  said, child give special knowledge child's health. Parents like believe otherwise, ultimately correlation. didn’t see post. Thank you! can’t believe need hear stuff Fauci people believe it, many people still won’t. virus mutates, mutates pretty quick. know this, need think critically understand path forward look like. stop thinking CDC needs job correctly order stop virus, real burden people behave appropriately. stop thinking politically virus see clear enemy. Nobody friends virus, nobody wants be. isn’t second side, supposed one one team it.  Also two three massive concerts state 30,000 plus attendance past weekend.

Is incubation period Delta still viewed 4-10 days? Pull online program. I’m teacher. Maybe point right direction? Okay...do then. Still nice cheap hangout place. good pandemic unvaccinated times nothing really happens. bunch time lawyer pleeing case want spend bunch massive protests Chile pandemic nothing happened it. naive fool. Didn’t DeSantis get vaccine? would think alone would convince anti vaxxers state get one.   Thanks info think point natural selection. Unfortunately kids can't vaccinated yet. hope soon. feel bad breakthrough infections. stopped masking short social distancing. masking social distancing now. Everyone wear masks distance. 

No Thanksgiving dinners grandma anymore since you’re going wearing masks distancing. aren’t hanging around maskless, unvaccinated people may infected. 

Isn’t whole point vaccinated people *can* infected? ""Listen, we've sex awhile, gotta safe take condom now"" SCENARIO: person asthma coughing lot faints. end ER subsequently tests positive Covid. Covid ends becoming severe due asthma end ventilator pass away. family tell guy, look don’t like Covid death certificate cuz loved one always suffered asthma. jackass says ok Fam changes death certificate Asthma COD. 

WHAT FUCKER.  thresholds based R0. Based R0 pretty accurately determine percentage population need vaccinated halt spread. think media want worst happen. pandemic given new life. often many us even look local national media sites COVID?

“If people tested showed symptoms Covid, would close point.”

This large majority tested though that’s you’re missing. It’s representative broader scope population. Front line hospital workers symptomatic people true random sample. That’s tested. They’re testing people grocery stores. It’s job mandated testing sick enough get curious go find out.

They aren’t testing random people random office random people random plane. testing specific segments don’t represent whole population. It’s good randomized sample like want. doesn’t track asymptomatic cases, even mildly symptomatic ones. It’s meaningless stat. 

The fact may tell percentage people directly exposed sick turning positive. sample always varies too, one days it’s hundred symptomatic, next day it’s hundred front line hospital workers, next day nursing home residents. 

To correctly get positivity rate actually meant something you’d randomly sample general public perform say 10,000 tests day course many days you’d get better indication.

What they’re though akin testing 10 sick people, 8 come back positive claiming 80% positivity (exaggerated point I’m trying make here), next day testing 10 country market 1 come back saying it’s 10%.

You can’t control group one day it’s one thing one day another. Darth Desantis risen.

These people chose continue risk communities. It’s different drunk driving. 

Healthcare workers didn’t get profession sacrifice altar ignorance unvaccinated. mean could mutate another country, come infect people. fact, Delta already much sarcasm. Sorry dude Moms whack. would anybody come vaccination? leaves country packed vaxxed people come non-vax country? make sense! wrong? husband whole command required get soon available. base, deployment-ready/sub commands required, base medical staff, etc. branches/commands/bases requiring already? Also… forget assembly line boot camp got injected several vaccines, weren’t even told were…? 😳 Sure none word ""symptomatic""

They use word ""asymptomatic."" also describe specific symptoms lead one classified ""suspected positive PCR test symptoms still ""confirmed case"" ""suspected case""

Three people mother's 55+ community death's door two ventilators. One supervisor job put ventilator yesterday. Another died last month. Two husband's co-workers covid. republicans, unvaccinated. know one person included list caught fully vaccinated, ok within week. friends vaccinated. We're 30s. 

I'm especially social, knew couple people catch covid 2020. Fast forward today people dropping like flies. nucking futs.

I'm seeing masks Publix, I'd still say 25% masks, 75% not. establishments seems taking joy thumbing noses safety (my husband's place work included, hence whole ""two people covid"" thing). pretty much resigned bringing home we're going catch it. sucks. We're vaccinated we'll probably fine, still want get sick. Seems like inevitability.  still 35 million cases that's insultingly low, mean tell 10.5% Americans ever tested positive? 1) shouldn’t say this, I’ll assume 13 years old. multiple definitions. Words synonyms. synonyms apply fine.

2) Show proof new strain harmful. contagious, possibly current credible scientific evidence showing far harmful children. child immunocompromise, stay home. protect people need protected. Everyone else serious risk going lives actually get thing instead delaying inevitable masking locking down.

I work children living. I’ve seen effect mass hysteria done psyches. kids terrified leave house, walk around outside without mask. Virus practically nonexistent realistic chance scientifically speaking kill irritable harm them. psychological effects, emotional effects hysteria enabling effects could far greater reaching far harmful poor kids Covid.

That’s opinion. follow science. I’m going moved brow beating name calling. get going, mom calling dinner. mandatory masks February onwards.

Kids wore day, got two ten minute masks breaks outside, obviously wear eating. kids complained.

Those parents complained school board meetings. starts home...If parents supportive least explain ""why"", kids understand. ""covid flu, MuH fReEdOm"" parents teach attitude kids too. fair, used word people another post mods deleted it. =\\

... Well said! there's animal reservoir SARS-CoV-2, can't eliminate like smallpox, latter animal reservoir.

Smallpox also much deadlier. Despite extensive vaccination coverage decades even polio still endemic. 

The lesson learned here? Viruses *insanely* difficult eradicate. “The virus stable mutates slowly” miss days vaccinated? so, risk, need worry. true. 6 people small office work in. 3 vaccinated wear masks, 3 vaccinated one wears mask time. Makes uncomfortable truthfully. They're also dumbasses per surveys must covid fuck us much over.

Why would virus thing? majority pops doesn's get vaxxed continue thing. 

American find hard way neither reason shoot way crisis time. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Covid demonstrative showing like smallpox bet ass people would lining vaccinations, mask wearing/social distancing. wtf going people feel like witch hunt going people vaccinated wanna strip unvaccinated everything, still pay taxes!!!!!!! ultimate point vaccines reduce risk

Nobody's doubting that. still risk provided much suggest small say long covid sufferers actually suffer much.

I also know necessarily true. statements may end true, making pretty authoritative claims things jury still on. USA isn’t going another lockdown again. promise that, can’t afford it. Laugh European Children mean nothing guess. Don’t worry aren’t alone selfish attitude. Correct. US, least 

Israel, UK, Germany rolling out; pfizer early data shows impact; pfizer planning EUA US month. That's enough assume safe (at least somewhat) effective

I'm happy accept risk point. think reward getting infected &amp; (more importantly) spreading others/ at-risk family far greater Taking 3rd dose base "" research"" anti-vax level cringe. people sides think know scientists?

You get public comply restrictions long significant enough amount people decide it’s over, over, socially. makes sense. proportion people suffering long Covid 12 weeks initial infection remains uncertain, estimates varying studies 2.3 per cent 37 per cent, paper said.

37 percent - even halved - pretty fucking high.  smart choice. I’m ICU RN Los Angeles, doctors nurses get sick COVID vaccines. 

Some doctors nurses quite sick. hospitalized, know one doctor close friend nurse (healthy 30 year old female, Caucasian) bad neurological symptoms. agree, it’s insane. think keeps going going, deadlier variants keep coming….and people refuse vax mask….  insane is, unfortunately it’s far fetched. suggesting he's cherrypicking numbers, you?!

We're point worrying deadly vaccinated silly. remain seen masks alone enough reproduce lack getting sick 2020.

China, everyone contact-tracing app. South Korea, government gets everyone's cell data - people largely accept that.

From Chinese perspective, unwillingness Europeans Americans end outbreaks countries - something entirely doable - completely baffling. really wide cultural chasm. 2 5 always ass. Yes, particular topic, covid. need talk about, let's say, dangers forks, compare virus.

Edit: [definition bit nuance it, mainly re: defining core counties, urbanized. makes vaccination success rate stats confusing. vaccinated people tend continue wear masks avoid crowds course lower infection rates. want see infection rates similar cohorts: people wear masks avoid crowds. data. Anyone start noticing certain online friends talking segregation vaccine mandate? I’ve noticed trend conservative/“Alternative” thinking friends posting Oh absolutely would see neighbor’s kid wheeled body bag. anti-vax parent thing many serious illnesses affect children rare (thanks vaccines) vax kids there’s good chance they’ll fine. smallpox polio still going around silly anti-vax parent movement would never gotten legs. Well, UK half hospitalizations among vaccinated.

In 80%. 

Some highest vaccinated places world US ""very high risk"" travel list. Malta Gibraltar among them, something like 90% fully vaxxed rates.

If see inconsistencies need head examined. saw one *rebel* mask chin - older fella too...  Spoken like someone privilege never losing it. internet supposed allow people express knowledge thoughts without filtering. qanon, January 6, etc sure want know what's going people's mind unfiltered.

Worst whack jobs find create alternate realities. things mentioned pose significantly higher risk peoples health covid point pandemic. Completely agree. vaccinated along ride point. Stay positive enjoy yourselves. sound selfish, sound human.

All say I'm sorry alone. absolute bs gone 1.5 years this, gotten vaccine, are. MMR required participant many parts society. notably public education.

Polio endemic US, there's compelling need.

As influenza? think treat respect deserves would opposed increasing pressure flu vaccines. necessarily need jump mandates order eat restaurant, think mandating employers grant 4 hours sick leave go get would great. Yes, nothing article indicates  percentage positive cases say. remember, many mass testing sites removed. way this. Literally number. fine Columbine Sandy Hook, fine nothing this, too. come across articles think ever see zero cases Covid again? CANT VACCINATE THEM! That's rough, likely undercount too. loved traveling Indonesia, noticed health care system needed work; especially rural areas. probably can't test enough manage spread, especially densely populated place like Java. I'd actually surprised US doesnt hit 200k+ 3 weeks well said. insane... keep hearing distinction serious form disease hospitalization.

Does anyone know definition serious infection would result hospitalization? know possibly blame humans Covid spread across globe scale hundreds millions infections. country able go widespread community spread eradication, countries keep initial infections low *still* struggling keep (see: Australia) despite closed borders. Additionally, countries simply cannot lock indefinitely hopes eradication (see: developing countries). vaccine prevent infection, even 100% people got it, virus would still spreading.

It's highly infectious virus. done anything unless China successfully contained beginning allowed help collaboration outside nations support venture. dorms allowing vaccinated people socialize? rules restrictions place stopping seeing others?

There reason whatsoever anyone vaccinated isolated. go thing, one stop you. see Nothing! Nothing! Even better, thank believe killed people immune response, much stronger younger people. Antibody levels way easier measure. So.. medical fraud. 

These numbers going mess scientists come study REAL impact covid. 

Also, fire clown faking death certificates.  Smallpox polio different viruses. comparing apples oranges.  feel like they’re holding hope eradicated keep people vigilant longer, reality, kids vaccinated there’s full FDA approval, likely thing next Spring latest, average American do?

There’s always gonna variants, it’s endemic point. There’s eradicating Covid.  see lot answers question pointing behavior. it’d wonderful ended deadly phase pandemic vaccines alone, seems highly probable Delta *speeds up* current phase pandemic (just dangerous way). 

Covid won’t eradicated, likely reach point circulates much less kills rarely. Vaccines best tool get us there, Delta proven every nation became dominant *highly efficient* finding “dry tinder” (people immune systems aren’t primed it). there’s little tinder left, it’ll drop manageable numbers. 

Then question *we* respond endemic virus like ~200 others circulation. really need protect people? not. HIPAA magic shield prevents non-healthcare employees discussing contagious diseases. Yeah NVAX making want. combination flu/covid nose Dude… Pete took recommendation doctor R9, like chickenpox brother GBS. Discovered got Lymes Disease, tick. Apparently, one 4 people medical history once. terrifying. I've looking uses Johns Hopkins CSSE.

This typical antivaxer. reason rest us NEED vaccinate. notion boosters taking away rest world dumb. reality shots, least US, going waste. Thousands dumped one using them. I've said elsewhere, rich countries want help, buy, manufacture, ship AZ vaccine. One easily stored long periods time.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I’m trying decide. school system mandating masks students staff except PE class asking school board they’re managing lunchtime considering packed maskless 130 6th grader - lack answer means one even thought cafeteria. 

Our county, like rest VA 71% vaccinated 18 up, 54% estimated 12 up. wife vaxxed 7th grader. even though “studies show” week recovery time kid, wife neither want afford sick ATM. 

September going shit show. read great article BBC (maybe search site), highlighting research suggests 8-week hiatus effective. think many us hoping so. Currently data shows 3rd shit safe, nothing regards 2 year going forward.   fairness get wanting keep kids safe that’s obviously entirely understandable.

But people taking wayyyyyy far really seems Americans virus politicised there. 

Just strange seeing extreme views country. one hand people won’t even bare minimum like wear mask people even letting kids go school they’re living side side other. 

By contrast, Europe near everyone wears mask everyone’s sending kids school. much one extreme other. There’s plenty Americans like I’m sure bit food thought. leave simple  give money Reddit give awards others gild comments pay forward, free awards use every couple days. bit dry spell I'm saving comment back award surely Reddit's 2021 Comment Year. Put genuine mug splitting smile face morning thank you. Source hitting 5-24 hard UK?  He’s better it. Offspring irrelevant decade. found Covid19 causes widespread vascular damage throughout body, even people symptoms. That's good future prognoses. possible someday, people infected never even knew organ damage, increased mortality, decreased quality life.

I'm interested that, long short term. Im vaccinated I’m study sent home antibody tests. One month ago positive antibodies I’m negative antibodies. Hey baby, let bad time roll point either get shot covid. Best choose shot.

Well put. Don’t Get Jab long numbers get low enough, transmission low enough, die out, like polio. Right now, numbers high, transmission among vaccinated, low percentage, still high enough issue. Plus, currently chance additional mutations high, could real shit sandwich. thing is, vaccine exempt school outbreak occurs cannot attend school outbreak resolves. Usually it’s issue aren’t lot outbreaks, measles spreading years ago vaccine exempt kids didn’t measles vaccine stay home school places outbreak occurred. non vaxxed people know “wait see” types. political. I’m betting it’s 50/50 among unvaxxed.  Right…I bet try shift funds instead. It’s incredible they’ve set responsible whole country’s outbreak. I’ve heard nonstop comments echoing this! 60% reduced risk infection including asymptomatic good. Symptomatic likely much more. Incredible sub filled people consistently see negative matter what’s front them. addiction fear real. Ahhhh don’t kids! never understand responsibility instinct comes soon become parent protect kids cost. rather troll think you’re smarter actually raise kids instead depending others raise kids.

And someone faces discrimination LIFE CHOICES would think people would understand annoying others can’t relate weigh doing. I’d like meet person proposed study.  simple covid patients taking hospital beds born old man strength like Chuck Norris. advised vaccines end game. Festivals, concerts sports games got approval someone go ahead full capacity. 

Feeling need live life based perception others—not risk profile beliefs— direct result pandemic handled. 

Go festival. now, when? wouldn’t surprised another variant popped next summer time ruin it. Pretty fly vaccinated guy yeah, one whole points getting everyone vaccinated try also cover people can't reason other, seems like one people. liking response :/  told ID laws racist homophobic. county BOE still said they'll abide CDC AAP guidelines. think they're waiting state make decision mandates they're basically bunch cowards.

School starts less 2 weeks. That's awesome. would ideal situation people. Unfortunately case lot major cities US places like UK really thought see kids getting sick hospitalized, would change mind mask mandates vaccines, like Gov Hutchinson. Maybe Republicans interested good parents following party line. Survey also finds water wet snow cold. Meanwhile, Netherlands decreasing time doses... remember many people get vaccinated. number still increasing (accelerating, even). Also, it’s impossible get 100% people anything. seem missing point. Nobody wants long war, enemy give in, stuck one whatever. know one person dozens gotten vaccinated also got covid. They’re boss since everyone vaccinated longer mask mandate I’m person still wore mask day. got everyone office went get tested one else got it. Further, boss fine back work little week. goes show effective vaccines preventing really matters, serious illness, hospitalization death. vaccine also definitely helped prevent spread either didn’t enough viral load transmit, everyone else protected enough vaccine get likely combination both. Without vaccine everyone would much worse off. break cases likely increase delta continues spread vaccines still designed do, save lives limit spread. Hopefully media start reporting positives vaccines encourage people get indeed work.  Probably way less people think. Ok, last 3 medical studies saying far differently delta…. pretty much confirm 
95% prevents severe illineas
88% symptomatic
63% asymptomatic per Singapore, Canadian, UK study…  someone write extensive timeline guy's schooling? Google search, says went one school four years got PhD...how work?

Cooking burger correctly (medium rare) pretty hard, Here’s good video number TB cases US 10k annually. would need stipulate anything disease? Compared millions cases 600k deaths tear COVID. really see difference numbers? sure policies different countries TB worse. talking policy US. Stick topic. Oregon, sick admitted. IE lot trouble breathing. village 100 people. 99 vaccinated, one not.

2 people come virus. One vaccinated. 

The accurate way depict situation “50% infected people vaccinated.” instead vaccinated people don’t get infected.” Let’s impose stiff felonies making fake vax cards using well. Good summary subs since beginning lol. read recommendation says know therefore recommend getting it. 

But science saying natural immunity robust long lasting may better vaccine immunity. many times CDC messed going trust doctor first need fully vaccinated. read Delta pushed closer 90% Criticism China cannot tolerated, please good citizen. Pretty sure no. notion seems largely Reddit/Twitter tell, though wouldn’t surprise floodgates indeed open happens. Guy right looks like he's tell someone ""pop trunk. it."" Even true frontline workers getting tested, heck *especially* true, rate change positivity extremely important detecting outbreaks early. case, positivity rate may representative population whole rate change canary coal mine. Wastewater testing another good example this. depends vaccine getting. *think current ‘optimal recommended gap’ AZ 12 weeks Pfizer 3 Moderna 4.

*Disclaimer. could wrong Someone make buddy movie big city doctor returns rural Georgia old friend-turned-enemy also doc never moved town.

It practically writes itself. next variant going Delta Plus Ultra? This, plus analogy pretty bad, equating covid symptom 8 weeks dying car crash. There’s even guarantee symptoms permanent either, persisted 8 weeks. fact I’m certain amount would be, plus know vaccination also help remove long term symptoms. bad news.  So, someone posted - deleted comment started getting upvotes:

""following popular choice really line going with? recommended health experts drink several glasses water day. punk stop drinking water everyon... ""

I'm going call name... but... e-mail notifications forever.

After reading drummer's reasoning - I'm absolutely going line. fact stand behind post turn popular anticipated, proves point influenced PEER response. something say - saw getting support \*I\* saying - changed mind saying loud people could hear it.

And \*partisan\* perspective. another example, conservative friend complaining Olympian dropping complaining pushed coaches parents hurt leg last Olympics.

His point achieved medal people pushing her.

My rebuttal was, ""If success matter her, \*resisted\* pushed anyone HERSELF. used coach would berate push several high school athletics. ""You could BEST pushed yourself!""

One day flatly told him, ""What know limits best, push myself, I'm happy ONE best. ""The Winner"" important enough *this* contest?""

Which still principle life - post believe, never delete post getting downvoted. I'm win social media contests grow karma. I'm express views - even ones turn unpopular Reddit.

That something seems largely missing whole generation grew instant feedback dopamine-rush cycle group affirmation Likes Thumbs Ups. I'm first note lot people ""post Karma"". Right going r/BMW \- longest time, everyone dog-piled posts M4 guaranteed instant Karma downvote car. people started getting sick dog-piling started downvoting anyone band-waggoning M4 hate - suddenly, downvotes dried up. ""taking side social benefits,"" thing goes beyond social media - affects ideologies. People pick team tribe, root win - WIN... rush victory - even know team deflating footballs, driving cars track, playing dirty politics. winning side matters.

In threads below, people supporting drummer took exception last line, ""That supports people taking vaccine \*whatever\* personal reason decide to."" Everyone supporting drummer agreed support said last paragraph.

That misunderstanding drummer, misunderstanding point.

Nobody's opinion drummer's decision get vaccine matters *except* drummer's. Dexter Holand, Anthony Keidis, Jello Biafra Henry Rollins, Tommy Lee Nikki Sixx \*certainly\* opinions mob strangers Reddit. Thinking \*absolutely\* \*not\* punk - band trying publicly shame him...

...is also punk. punk AF.

Punk making decision, unpopular not, believing YOURSELF, even one else does. Trusting reasoning, even everyone else makes sound like unreasonable. Punk ""I felt RIGHT,""

Not...

""I Dexter Holland wanted PhD microbiology.""

TL:DR - Yeah... line I'm going with.

By way - I'm two dose, Pfizer vaccinated. opinion choice \*matter\* me, reasons. own. course not. crowd though think cloth masks ineffective get n-95 mask. controversial comments come look patterns user histories.

My mom chemo immunosuppressed. clue fuck we're gonna do. I'm beyond furious people refuse get vaccinated.  people choose get vaccinated.

But death rate dropped dramatically, percentage cases (0.2% CFR UK compared 2% previous wave) terms fewer cases happening otherwise would. Deaths US barely started rise (as expected, since surge weeks old), current deaths tail end Alpha surge. wonder Goya going play this...  Much better florida.  assumption socialization. Total lack socializing causes developmental issues. Woo! Time widespread mandates, good. actually like masks. Really prefer anonymity. China buying Pfizer-Biontech and/or Moderna well?

Also, I’m gay really doesn’t matter me. sperm aren’t children thing all. agree it, want drummer band shares anti-vax bullshit one-liners instagram.  folks kids different perspective this. totally get it. Keeping home often huge deal developmental standpoint. still social interactions play kids, quite bit selective where. That's lot words ""I know often unvaccinated people getting infected.""  agree, mate. COVID still novel; 25% population (ish) unexposed vulnerable really high rates spread high hospital needs. number gets lower risk catastrophically fast spread drop it'll move endemic phase.

Yes, Austin different talking Seattle area competent governor. China's making something like billion vaccines per month. older vaccine (that really much prevent delta spread), checks out. agree completely. reading drummers statement seem clear understands bands personal safety concerns around him. Regardless wish health luck life ahead Punks huh healthy view. Thanks this. looks ridiculous lol. take mask walking around heat.  mind sharing source this? Would like take look myself. continue normalcy ones vaccinated fine get COVID. choose get get really sick thats decision.

I mean - sounds good paper except fact healthcare workers strained deal yahoos.

Oh there's 47 MILLION children 12 years old US increasingly getting disease well.

So decision impacts everyone else. understand point, however true worst case scenario..there plenty examples great powers professional militaries struggled even failed insurgent/rebel groups grossly outnumbered outgunned

And expand that, notion would occur US soil terrifying would probably go think would. military police would probably split. Tons innocent people would end caught crossfire. country know would  Pfizer approved fully there's vaccine mandates, happen people J&amp;J Moderna?

Interesting. always hearing good news now, context always important. tend agree this. hate seeing types comments, presumably vaccinated people upset vaccinated people trying live lives best given circumstances anger misdirected. You’re vaccinated, I’m sure else possibly do. FYI, Vietnam received additional 3 million doses USA five days ago stated expect USA near future. read remembered post. Figured would give update.

Probably. choose use that, children choice. teachers, sold “next year back normal” message.

I never believed stupid ass shit, lot teachers know going thinking ok. Tis going poopshow. Get popcorn ready. I'm UK bear mind, think there's definitely cause cautious optimism.

There huge body evidence show vaccines massively decrease chances getting seriously ill dying, significantly decrease risk passing on.

This autumn winter likely painful, *that* there's good reason believe COVID become endemic virus comparable flu learn live with.

By stage recommend whatever makes comfortable probably consider ignoring news bit well. take serious/critical cases divide active infections get hospitalization rate. It’s less 1% US worldwide using world-o-meters numbers. Im assuming cases hospitalizations unvaccinated. sure make it. Viral load 1000x, 1000% FYI. Otherwise - agree. Mild, context COVID, simply means hospitalized dead. 

It still captures group people difficulty breathing, gasping air middle night, 102+ fevers, experiencing brain fog fatigue, and/or unable taste smell (potentially months). miserable experiences categorized mild since people hospitalized dead.  don’t know you’re wearing public, butt already double masked. Amazing 3 guys seem like alternate reality versions Rob Lowe. GBS already Coronavirus. he'll immunity anyway, take position (double jabbed myself) Full Flavor Delta 100s smart people primary told wouldn’t get vaccine either history GBS. seems CDC didn’t know removed mask advice vaccinated people high vaccination rate helps fight spread better higher vaccine effectiveness.

I'm going store store something like might exit one store, pull little I'm walking around outside, pull back I'm headed back next store. walking around probably wear (yes fully vaxxed) I'll respect mask store, want wear fully walking around needed hot out. 

But saw walking street point probably say look jerk wearing mask nose. Yes, also true. Good point. think picture would’ve different transmissible variant like delta could easily “evade” first dose early days? Israel actually stopped pretty early. Even they're 59.5% fully vaccinated. 18th April 55% fully vaccinated. vaccine uptake dogshit months.

But....no.....I put cruelty people, sometimes people barely know, I'm afraid go another near-death experience....or worse, death. anti-vaxxer, anti-lockdown, anti-maskers, people generally think Covid big deal 'why go sit crowded restaurant maskless us'. Fuck depressing 18 months been. Delta Plus get Covid without ads. Maybe idiots get vaccinated then? overlap people chronic mental illness self-reported long Covid symptoms seems high. wish people understood this. many Covid discussions devolve ""but long covid!"" Would support work anywhere?  Go office five days week want, WFH five days week want.  don’t think many people think required WFH - given option. history indicator we’re months short halfway point thing.

but hear, people tired, That's great. vaccination prevent infections new variants? seems mutate quicker able produce new vaccines. wasn’t eligible point… never humans animals getting it. like Fauci overall pointless comment misleads people. Overall Fauci much less reasonable time went on. aren’t traveling special work papers, stay country. countries, treat us same. People don’t need vacationing abroad pandemic. mean that's exactly question.

This headline literaly ""British Scientists Fear Forever COVID War""

They scientists, know much virus I. would COVID19 would exceptional case, saying it? would go forever? It’s technically allowed right now. I’d hold tad bit longer allow regulatory agencies catch up.

The FDA looking give Pfizer full approval end monthl. happens, physicians prescribe label give people 3rd doses.

I vaccinated December among first group I’m pretty ready get 3rd dose. government limits people’s ability travel time 

That may true, government never completely limited people’s ability travel particular state, violation constitutional rights. 

It doesn’t matter ‘believe’ it, legally cannot. isn’t grey area. Freedom movement states constitutional right prohibiting travel Florida would violate that. sub complete opposite. Everyone downplaying every concern, dismissing worry, calling negative data reporting fear mongering yelling ""great news! everything fantastic!"" every opportunity. case numbers dropped rapidly UK India, here’s one link I’m sure there’s better one - Plenty people don’t though, doesn’t mean everyone did. you. father needs booster survive, expect gov't prioritize life someone another country. would fully expect gov'ts prioritize citizens us things reversed. numbers higher kids hospitalized. It’s playing game percentage. Actual children getting sicker faster delta variant Best get medical information medical professionals, economist. No, person took upon sneak around system so. anyway official recommendation so. said nearly states way many doses throw away. knew abortions going get mentioned. I’m vaccinated (Jan-Feb 2021). (obviously) last year. majority forced repayment plans vs. discharge secured creditors retain leans modified repayment plan. days discharging walking away pretty much over. Damn wish got paid get vaccine. Oh well, least protected covid months  favorite lyrics:

Do told! Listen mom! hang people think differently! Trust government! Conform, comply, knuckle under, proud it! Black Death, 30 - 60% dead Europe, herd immunity heard guy radio say this. ""What decided approve them. gonna do, suck everyones arms?"" 😂 Laughs Canadian decided to. Here's [comment felt safe Israel, Germany, UK rolling third doses; pfizer set request US authorization month. feel like taking anyone's dose, considering excess supply US tranches expiring month

I'm immunocompromised/etc. trip planned later month may include indoor/bar behavior, wanted extra protection want bring anything back home older family members

And generally, think breakthrough cases public health worry, boosters rolled ASAP. they're better defense requiring masking (which unvaxxed less likely follow anyway...) it’s over… Eric Topol threads  That's Tucker Carlson got vaccinated, right?

I'm aware he's grifting viewers vaccine ""skepticism""/disinfo. might another angle try parents. die, replaced.

And probably cheaply, that! mean “the way delta seems sudden drop”? want feel optimistic! messages churches completely uncontroversial, make news headlines.

They wanted open churches major social mental health outlet many people. preacher giving sermons small portion value church.  That's good question, probably go unanswered. political decisions, scientific decisions. Thankfully vaccine mandates aren’t actually HIPAA, significant Supreme Court precedent [on vaccine mandates, case involving smallpox vaccine. national system QR codes would problems legal regard, ESPECIALLY imminent full FDA approval within next month.

The anti-vaccine crowd quickly going run places go. It’s matter time point. I’m sure someone working national database already. makes traceable helps asymptomatic people know might contagious. asymptomatic person tests positive exposure self isolates reduce infections. even better share, wore masks maintained social distances I'm getting life.

And surprise dropped dead despite vaccinated Unvaccinated? I’m still completely sure Lungs 100% healed. see last Xray June 2020 wanted another Xray Dec, really slammed time. 

My VO2/Max continues rise (I’m within normal range age now) still averaging 10miles walked day. Probably close best shape life. Crohns disease result viral infection. Post viral syndrome real thing occurs great number diseases. think it’s unfair put blame hospitals medical professionals. don’t know “other places” dealt it, doctors nurses limited number patients. It’s irresponsible admit patients cannot cared properly IMO.

What find problematic frankly scary government implemented strong, effective measures actually curb current wave infection. sit around, patients we’ll have, infected people infect even people, infect others (rinse repeat). Managing medical resource important resource finite. seems much attention paid hospitalization issue root problem (ie government failing/not bothering contain infection).  Covid incredibly serious disease, people need take precautions, wonder many deaths among children car accidents, diseases, drowning, etc.

That’s say shouldn’t take seriously, children particular, long history panicking wrong things. Masks, distancing, also letting kids play together bubbles, go school (masked), turning rare disease among children common epidemic mental health problems, also important. There's actual proof Delta+ transmissible..... 40% public school teachers NYC still gotten vaccinated. Resistance seems stronger specific political party universal. think people understand importance kids schools in-person. would like precautions taken like masks social distancing possible, think pretty basic, non-intrusive asks… Underrated comment right here. fucked applaud someone *exercising right choose manner death?*  


If anti-vaxxer chooses get vaccinated, endorse efforts kill themselves. Personal freedoms, that. I'll laugh themselves.  


***What worry people they'll drag along way. :(*** Many people already own. slightly wild west however, studies indicating help. Physicians least state safe given enough time doses. go saying always ask DR first.   Username check Actually wanted say consider quite selfish got vaccine fast could, two weeks actual priority opened, wanted wanted protect good possible. people got bit mad faster them. Queen?

(Wait, wrong field science.) let people go lives get natural herd immunity? unvaccinated risk serious outcomes, vaccinated well protected. Let infect done it. fear could step outside door airplane engine could land Heck, quick review Facebook posts creates pretty accurate starting point create 'person interest' list. bring session musician one tour. wanted fire guy whatever reason- using Covid excuse poor taste imho. Good luck virus, need  China, Japan done well all. Japan cases  
throughout entire pandemic. China largely CoVID-free since  
about April 2020.

Yes, that's really point. I'm claiming East Asian populations perfect immunity Covid. Obviously many contracted disease, began China.

My claim substantial portion East Asian Southeast Asian populations *some* immunity, either acquired immunity related coronavirus infections, potentially even [genetic result multi-generational exposure horseshoe bat coronaviruses, endemic area, simply elsewhere.

China many restrictions, makes perfect sense China would lower cases deaths Japan.

However, Japan cases since beginning pandemic, never done much control spread, barely even tests anyone, let alone contact tracing, still packed schools, public transit, restaurants open, etc. Japan done better every single country Latin America, North America, Europe, without single exception, often leaps bounds. obvious, massive cultural societal differences 

Obvious, massive \*unnamed\* cultural differences, soon name wash away like chalk. Japan experiences seasonal flu, RSV every year, tens thousands deaths.

Mask adherence Latin America nearly universal, mandatory, since start. Europe, countries like Germany reputations social compliance done much, much worse Japan, despite much severe restrictions. got tested last week literally zero symptoms friend friend exposed. stating facts Fair enough read FT time, say reporting typically downplays virus risk (while sensationalizing either, like US coverage). surprised article, normally I'm big fan FT. case think gave due coverage data declining vaccine effectiveness. think that's reasonable, even now.

With current outbreak, die cast. never seem understand mitigation efforts need start early, first signs outbreak, effective.

Forgive want participate endless arguments dysfunction regarding done now, already know what, already happened. Fuck shit. Hello Delta plus Glad you’re okay now. wasn’t hospitalized Covid long hauler sometimes wonder lungs looked like vs there’s long term scarring something. HA shit! [Commemorative figurine unvaccinated adult presenting believe scientists said 4 weeks everyone wearing masks go away. can’t even correctly America Yep tell it. support going back work, everyone else wants WFH forever, productive overall people. Saw article DeSantis killed covid number votes by? may go away, (hopefully) eventually mutate something less harmful.

It already has. Delta variant less harmful even among unvaccinated people It’s churches threw fit went virtual. Without everyone crowd going along hate-preacher says, messaging gets lost. 

They know need people back pews worse. He's disguising anti-vax stance concern children's mental well-being. wouldn’t make sense cohort shift overnight. Absent lockdown, trends take time. April July year, 517% increase number cases 18 years nearly 690% increase cases children 12 said hospitalizations among children 18 270% recent weeks, ICU admissions among children also 275%. 20% individuals 12, said.

Holy shit. don’t say… legitimately understand folks fled Cuba (or whose families did) Venezuela, etc. signing GOP authoritarian cult Trump. Objectively, future orange-man led GOP wants closer ""socialist"" states US constitution. UK month two behind Israel US pretty much same?

UK really woods yet, bad could've UK still barred many places love whataboutism? Thus likely catch Covid-19. isn’t full story. Clinical trial results always symptomatic infections: *that* 95% for. Asymptomatic always thought lower closer 70-80%. 50-60%, certainly big drop, nowhere near big 95% 60%. 

When people say flu vaccine 60% effective, don’t really factor asymptomatic infections cause asymptomatic flu doesn’t exist (only presymptomatic) think 100% comes from? I'm confused disagreeing this. Efficacy calculated comparing data two groups.

I'm saying chances getting COVID go spread saying math complicated linear relationship.

Let say, hypothetically, every 1 unit increase transmission causes 100% increase infection among unvaccinated groups 1% increase vaccinated groups, rate transmission increases, efficacy actually rise. include microchip GPS transmits coordinates time next shot. They'll think there's microchip either way might well.  Florida high vaccination rates among risk populations recently got tested Walgreens (fully vaxxed, wanted extra cautious possible exposure) test drive-through only. Maybe depends Walgreens?  comparable percentage people never recover viral infections (e.g., around 1% people catch mono, believe). definitely real poorly understood, also cases. issue 1%-2% cases means still large number people comes millions cases.  ""The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium since said delta-plus variant unlikely transmissible delta variant trends yet emerge, according Hindustan Times.""

For bit looked like sub lineage AY.3 might outcompeting traditional Delta US, might founder effect something - traditional Delta back growing % cases. It’s selection bias issue. Remember one posts tell didn’t get COVID today. post posting got breakthrough infection want others know. 

Virginia great job providing dashboard restricted particular date range provides vaccination status individuals test positive, hospitalized, die. July 1 July 30th, Virginia, 97.69% cases fully vaccinated individuals, 96.05% hospitalizations fully vaccinated individuals, 94.75% cases fully vaccinated individuals. So, vaccine perfect, vast majority getting COVID right unvaccinated. Breakthrough infections rare (303 fully vaccinated vs 12784 fully vaccinated). Well someone risk profile infected I'd likely mild symptoms. What's wrong natural immunity? 

Yes asymptomatic people spread infection, would putting risk? unvaccinated people opportunity get vaccine? worried getting virus means get vaccine. I'm worried week cold symptoms, worse I'll suffer consequences decisions. Florida also lower vaccination rate required host vaccinations order live college dorms, 2003. even get one previously (meningococcal vaccination around 2005). parents, students, media made fuss it.

But course world changed drastically since then. manipulative media conspiracy theories mainstream along social media warping everyone's mind, things noncontroversial battles now.

Just surreal sight.  thought went Delta, Delta +, Delta Pro Max right. say it, make real reason. would bet makes next difference. 1-2 percent max. say bad word ""lock-down"" though OK? need Florida safe, effective, proven countermeasure. unvaccinated MIL ditched mask SECOND could, despite pregnant constantly coming around me. 

There “threat” head. probably doesn’t think putting type risk whatsoever. What’s lot number? Pfizer’s usually 6 characters Moderna usually 7. Offer tendies Yeah, school FB page full "" zero issues anyone wants wear it. Free country, make choice thats best you. dont force choice others."" 


Ugh, people get it. fucking stupid. done. Protect regions tourists return home. also puts pressure Florida right thing. It’s 4-6 weeks here, I’ll wait September so. Georgia crazy spike, like we've 2k-3k case (I think) yesterday like 10k. sure that. article states effectiveness going go regardless look minor cases.

Of course spread matters, Delta created first place. goal still get much population maximally vaccinated. changed. encouraging part kids forced back school already variant likely kill vaccinated. Varies per person, said sick, said less/the same. 

Most people said symptoms different time, lose smell/taste first time haven’t lost second. didn’t fever fist time, second time high fever. 

It’s really place, everyone different. New Nintendo Delta Plus Lite feel way. week really hard I'm really angry. 

I agree comment stop reading news go day. reason want extra cautious IMO need get negative covid test order travel something looking forward to. Research indicates refusing vaccine linked related forms stupid behavior. virus really knows market itself. Lol, exactly. Hint: never cared fda approval. quick research.

Looks like risk GBS low, causational, applies AstraZeneca J&amp;J. 

So get Pfizer / Moderna shot. one forced attend UNC. doesn’t really apply. 

I forced drive public roads, do, need licensed. 

People aren’t forced attend college, do, UNC already requires decades. 

Did wake falling asleep 1920s?  wonder hostile headline seems imply. Apparently Parada experienced Guillian-Barre Syndrome, really rare side effect vaccines. brother-in-law's father experienced getting flu shot years ago doubt whether he'd even walk again.

I'm 100% pro-vaccine but, honestly, get Pete's perspective. No, can't.    RSV kills ~500 kids 12 every year, covid killed 300 18 (vast majority 12) entire pandemic.

RSV much much dangerous Covid kids 12. I've heard social media times children 12 excluded mandate allowed restaurants, seen linked citation. Abbott ass! Somebody told DeSantis stops testing now, he'll cases (and can't get head.) Yeah it’ll take coordination sure. bones already thanks rest immunizations do, still gotta distribute every base. us virologists, likely order operations matters?

If Pfizer first j&amp;j less likely would get result 0.7% breakthroughs?

Or simply unknowable without actual testing? think right track, also happened places without formal lockdowns.

I think changes behavior overall, including voluntary changes (i.e. people careful thing get bad, less careful things get better). would keep voting people told bs would disappear one day 15 months ago, 13 months ago, 10 months ago, voted, etc.... talking herd immunity end last summer? People zero medical background making medical decisions listening medical professionals. Unless reason especially concerned (e.g., 80 years old, kidney transplant recipient, etc.) would go. feeling really concerned could quarantine however many days they're recommending vaccinated people exposure (is 3? 5?) get tested afterward.

Na-na, get jab? really need study prove antiVaxers don’t give shit people? Ok. Thank Captain Obvious 👨‍✈️ Thank insight. previous record? complications. felt bad 12 hours second shot that’s it. It’s wonderful able see huge relief vaccine working, social circle multiple instances COVID. think spread virus matters all? every state state vaccination database schools get vaccine confirmation. state, students go health department get specific form/copy vaccination record database. Yep, week late, odd me, next month week early, surprise!! fair, info probably outdated, used work hospital Public Safety Officer stressed shit ton HIPAA. it’s prob environment begin with. It’s shame can’t said vaccine. Tampa doesn’t…but get dragged town rest state. gotta kidding me, watch version completely evade vaccines too.. 100% ""actual"" number. 

And saying chances getting COVID go average spread? Sure don’t know herd immunity threshold since don’t know big previous outbreaks asymptomatic cases ever result lasting immunity amongst unvaccinated. There’s real recognized number there, assumed ones. year. 

Hint: vast majority ""Im vaxxed I'm never wearing mask fuck everyone"" folks vaxxed. 

How know.. tone. hateful, angry, antisocial tone. People wore masks that. Link broken? completely insane. Covid mostly harmless children, disgrace scared adults forcing crazy measures scared virus. appreciate gesture, extremely happy submitting criticism. not, society, get point policing private citizens' private events. Legislators make rules, yes; monitored ensure 'rules thee me' thing. former POTUS private citizen - celebrity, yes. still person deserves privacy trusted make decisions. They'l shouting without mask, suppose. track insurance information moron. Whether it’s private insurance government covered. remember back December 2019 watching video someone padlocked home. real? I'm sure, thoughts that's takes China control (the states) really fucked.  Long covid mostly myth. infections, severity post-acute symptoms strongly correspond severity infection itself. Mild infection? real long lasting symptoms. Small studies based self-reporting, self-selection control-groups say otherwise worthless. matters larger studies better designs. Like want government able control force put want inside body?? I've seen people Georgia mask mandates wearing around chin. That's even confusing! would affect ability tour quarantine 2 weeks everytime cross border. fucking shit. obvious lifted mask mandate June. 40% adults fully vaxxed store 15% masked up. difference. work governamental office nuts refused entry. Guess what...they learn immediatelly. think put vaccines case, mRNA much safer GBS (as cases linked vaccines far). mean, REALLY concerned, greater concern, shouldn’t exposed random viruses all. Lifelong quarantine.

Vaccines could trigger it, it’s magnitudes lower person restaurant coughing near random cold bug. college students faking cards. employers requiring vaccination return work. Anti-vax employees making circulating fake cards. hope terminated found out. No, one year olds don’t need peers develop socially—they need family. Kindergartners different story. Ah damn… sucks…. Maybe CDC guidelines then? 😕 Archived page (read w/o paywall): Color shocked I'm fully vaccinated. Got mild fever day second shot. side effect mr. Pfizer os all-natural organic free range SARS-CoV-2 virus mild form? knows?
And relatives fully vaccinated.

Anyway go closed place put mask fully, except forgot, problem it.   dont disagree. People seem missing point. point military mandate shot, simply mandating shot large orgainization like huge undertaking  That's biggest concern district goes ""masks optional"". 75% wearing staff supporting ones do, really even much point? There's also going enormous pressure shutdown classrooms, quarantine, contact trace go around. going mess. call contradiction. 


A higher vax rate leads higher overall effectiveness least short time. long run there's much difference 95% 99% assuming reach gets immunity. This. vaccinated. long risk contracting within tolerance level, go fun.

Edit: want good citizen, get tested come back see anyone immunocompromised 12. might mean prepping ahead time, go grocery store, etc. know negative.  Selfish people selfish. Got it. ""natural selection"" several studies looked cases people got GBS Covid infections. study you’re linking says number new GBS cases early months Covid outbreak less usual. could due people going hospitals height pandemic unless thought would die (even cases), could due quarantine reducing exposure causes - like viruses.  someone MS, sounds like antithesis MS. lesions brain/spine guess GBS everywhere brain/spine won’t tourism florida, I’m sure many complex reasons I’m dumb articulate Every parent know kids know kids tested positive covid. None concerning symptoms, even unlucky toddlers tested positive. 

These parents want kids back school socializing children normal fashion. Kids can’t pause life like adults can. exactly say test 20 people 10 positive achieve 50% positivity rate it’s small outbreak one else tested day exposed weird circumstances? You’re testing wide enough portions population. local data around something like 80% tests days employer mandated testd many hospitals. It’s really good control group. something given millions people already still final approval? They're taking long. friend stationed overseas. Apparently got like 90% vaccination rate base telling could leave base fully vaxxed. Yeah, I'll cool endemic vaccines available kids young 6 months. now, need protect vulnerable unable get vaccine.

News 11. China fuck around decided something. second clear pandemic real first time around shocked entire world closing whole city, something basically unheard covid. 

I'd suspect time keep increasing measures numbers drop. argue anyone wait politicians work courage, hit button gears start grinding instantly.

Western countries watched happen last time heard excuses like ""we governmental mechanisms here"", instead kept half measures trying downplay death toll. Hm? related article? Let break you. 

1. Vaccinated people still catch COVID. chances getting severe case much diminished. number breakthrough cases, however, show happen.
2. Vaccinated people still spread COVID. large number us children young vaccinated. Oh sure, they're traditionally hit less hard. Except us children respiratory conditions also associated severe cases, we'd like kids go ICU.
3. New variants COVID reduce vaccine's effectiveness. Delta variant, specifically, severe dramatically infectious original, responsible number vaccinated people catching COVID severe enough noticed spread around. 
4. COVID spread, likely variants arise. 

So no. pandemic over. yet. douche.

I calling names. appreciate it. Also, either he's lying doctor's advice, doctor got degree licensing dark alley third-world country.

It's theory, way. [There work difficult study.   Good news! He's dead. YouTube videos miss them. Oh....lol.. gop, disagrees. vaccine fucking FREE wtf “But muh economy” HUGE dose. need take 20 over-the-counter tablets get 100mg. really seems like something done medical supervision. Following governmental guidelines new punk greed. best way reduce numbers reduce testing capacity, duh! Remember world leader said something like that? back SARS obviously topical. Back advised masks barely matter droplets, much less aerosols use lockdowns, see anything like numbers. lie anyway. Think way:

If population 1000 people, 1000 doses - give everyone 1 dose, half people two doses. 

Using Canadian (Ontario's specifically) data, they've shown one dose effective preventing serious disease, even symptomatic covid. even Delta mix - Delta made less effective, like completely washed away benefit. 

In end, entire population 1000 people partial protection, herd immunity effect going play larger part.

Using U.K. example, recent spike, concentrated unvaccinated population (30s younger). less likely kill, could see extremely high case counts. 

Canada really thing play - we've Delta province months, seem really thing here. significant portion eligible population double vaccinated (12+, 81% one dose, 71% two) - quite uneven, something like 70% eligible one dose really started second doses earnest. 

I imagine combination factors - (had) tougher restrictions, still mask time, also added benefit larger swath population level protection via immunity, wider gap doses added benefits top that. 

We've hovering around 10 cases per 100k population month now, even Delta something like 90% cases. 

We still prioritized double dosing vulnerable health care workers quickly too, ensure would get highest viral loads likely worst complications protection. 

I think way slice it, hard see mistake process, worked exceedingly well us almost mutating effecting different parts population first began. Weird, could seen coming? Same. frustrating!  better question is, China going **not** keep control? 

The methods control spread disease mysterious. understand well. There's need ""find"" way, way well-documented. 

The practical question severe measures need particular case particular moment. Unfortunately, COVID-19 shown us world full selfish idiots, politics among general population, would prefer die, lot people die too, rather suck done control pandemic protect population. 

Say Chinese government, time bullshit general population, even without authoritarian government, much collective-minded Western countries going readily cooperate control measures, matter inconvenient are. 

The CCP order lockdown moment think warranted, also provide support affected population. Wuhan sealed, government delivering food elderly vulnerable need go out. 

Mass testing vaccination China question if, fast. efficacy Chinese-produced Sinovac Sinopharm vaccines somewhat less western variants, research shown much better vaccinate population somewhat less effective vaccine less population effective vaccine. rolling own, China total control production distribution they've pumping jabs spreading hard fast. 

Masks socially normalized Asia decades, government even really need order use. people masked own. 

Anti-vaxx China? luck. Nobody giving time day getting locked shoot mouth off.

A lot countries would crawl broken glass get numbers China's ""worst outbreak."" Unfortunately speculatory realm stage.

However, there's pumping breaks infectious variant may be, especially relation primary strain.

Bottom line is, declining vaccine medical reasons, repeating ""all voices deserve heard"" trope. Sorry pain ass, title potentially hugely misleading (I know one Reuters used, blame OP).

I’m saying lot people think symptoms means nothing bad happening. isn’t quite case Covid. get vaccinated, rock mask crowds, maybe try get infected all. guy yahoo answers told bad. scientists know breakdown probably useful way China CDC. 

I doubt useful PRC CDC. Right. I'm researching best masks get now. cloth ones work great EVERYONE wears them. But, everyone does, need move medical-grade 95 mask.

But context data favorable.

People asserting taking 3rd dose current formulation safe effective based upon idea Pfizer proposed testing. That's incorrect, Pfizer proposing new formulation testing.

That prove 3rd dose current formulation safe effective, means untested beyond whatever Israel relying upon justify using over-65 sub-population. looking forward Omega variant.

Plasmapheresis steroids fix up. Unless actually virtual meningitis, treatment kill him. 2 hours run differential. There's magic. China responds single case city testing every single resident city within days. always find lots secondary cases.

The recent Guangzhou outbreak began one person, multiple rounds testing entire city, identified close 200 infections. also locked parts city infections identified, imposed severe restrictions people trying leave city. took weeks quell outbreak.

The current Nanjing situation ""oops something airport, don’t worry, people tested positive."" They've repeatedly tested entire population Nanjing. Parts city lockdown. can't leave city without negative test. Even then, hundreds infections identified, including cities. absolutely massive response across several provinces now, multiple metropolises testing entire populations imposing travel restrictions. would CoVID-19 already common around country. sudden response makes sense context country zero-CoVID policy.

Not according document linked says. fact symptoms positive PRC even enough considered

Children, outcomes par typical flu? unvaccinated aged 50s-70s according article. Yeah, went window 90's advent usenet. clear doomed.  Hmm.. 

1. Polio? - Polio disease caused virus lives human throat intestinal tract. spread exposure infected human stool: e.g. poor sanitation practices. 1952 Polio epidemic worst outbreak 
the nation's history. nearly 58,000 cases reported year, 3,145 people died 21,269 left mild disabling paralysis, victims children. ""public reaction plague"", said historian William O'Neill. 
""Citizens urban areas terrified every summer frightful visitor returned.” Polio vaccine first became available 1955. 

2. symptoms Polio? - 95 % people infected Polio virus aware infected, still transmit others. develop fever, sore throat, upset stomach, and/or flu-like symptoms paralysis serious symptoms, others get stiffness back legs, experience increased sensitivity. However, develop life-threatening paralysis muscles. risk developing serious symptoms increases 
age ill person.

TO REPEAT: 

-Up 95 % people infected Polio virus aware infected,

- ""only"" 3,145 people died WORST OUTBREAK. 

Yeah. may right. may shitty comparison. Thanks sharing this. hopeful wish states would track this. People need see effective vaccines are! wish could push people get vaccinated forget masks.

Focusing much masking got mess. people minded wearing mask Target waited vaccination rates get past 70% ones mind wearing anyway. problem CDC goals plans dealing COVID long-term little horribly conveyed public. even said, ""Once surge ends, people demask keep masking surge continues."" 

That may best advice, better acting like wearing masks everywhere indefinitely. got J&amp;J too. wouldn’t worry much. even says article approved due high amount requests J&amp;J still effective it’s intended do. 

My state doesn’t allow additional shots yet J&amp;J it’s even option me. people J&amp;J getting seriously ill &amp; dying vaccines, would enough data support now. Right seems like may least effective stopping Covid outright it. 

If it’s consideration, everyone personally know breakthrough infection got Pfizer vaccine. Might well white supremacist vote conservative, obviously hate race 50% efficacy twice infectious variant...it's infectious unvaxxed last year assuming community spread. good news guys! matter hard tries, fully vaccinated people go live live, except sub Oh yep, thanks correction! stylish though. Got bedazzled eyepatch vision wonky haha good question I'd like hear competent individual answer... seem remember proposed before, addressed. employee could step ER waiting room immediately book vaccination wild. Saw 5 people 7 hour span stumble in, gasping air, rushed ahead people waiting 10+hours. People sitting around ER hooked oxygen. see still shrug off. 

Fun fact, made sign waiver acknowledging following CDC guidelines. covid positive people sitting 2 feet away others. People packed next other. makes feel better current thinking data younger child, less risk. ACE2 receptor virus primarily binds maturity antigen. young less none receptors doesn’t give virus much attach to. 2018, based 2006 - 2017. laws changed 2021. 

Chapter 7 longer exists. stupid. shouldn’t try micromanage global vaccine rollout. Yes rich countries getting double vaccinated poorer countries struggling get supply. pleading redistribution strategy isn’t going help things. Supply increasing every day world getting vaccinated. focus continuing keep supply coming poor countries. shaming countries receiving vaccines.  Oh problem. didn’t want people think two outbreaks. That’s gets overwhelming. GOP expelled crazy, wouldn’t much left afterwards point. Look happened Romney going crazy, example. think mutating faster flu. Keep mind difference *strains* *variants*; everything we've heard covid mutations single strain, Covid-19. hear flu mutations, talking completely different strains, even factoring different variants among strains. I'm epidemiologist anything like possible I'm way base here, impression Delta passed, another variant come along take place, another variant come that, another, ad infinitum. reason believe dealing form another rest lives? trying fearmonger here, genuinely know. thought best could hope vaccines treatments simply make another routine illness like cold. previous exposure influenza would prepared immune systems elderly protect them.

Like vaccine does. Yes hard hear sarcasm voice jeez Wishing isnt saving anyone. fear monger, thats people (some people) love Exaggerating comparison save lives really think we’ll get this. Sometimes remind saying “darkest dawn,” though maybe little cheesy, contains quite lot wisdom comes cycles life. 

Be well. disagreeing you, articles stating it’s safe, doesn’t exactly mean implicitly, it’s safe. long term studies back up. 

The biggest argument side understand simply know happen line, skepticism healthy feel. shouldn’t blindly follow masses say... 


Of course counter that, stating possible effects severely reduced you’ve taken vaccine, however doesn’t say anything point that, again, simply concrete way knowing absolute certainty happen (even road) it’s taken. So, that, understand people’s reluctance get vaccine.  kids definitely getting delta variant public schools. guess comes personal choice that's something okay exposing kids to. Los Angeles consider proposal require proof COVID-19 inoculation condition entry host indoor public spaces what, passed, would widest-ranging vaccination-verification effort city motion, introduced Wednesday council President Nury Martinez Councilmember Mitch O’Farrell, would require eligible individuals demonstrate they’ve received least one vaccination dose visit indoor places restaurants, bars, retail stores, gyms, spas, movie theaters, stadiums concert “Enough enough already,” Martinez said statement. “Hospital workers exhausted, moms put aside careers tired, kids cannot afford loss another school year. three vaccines work readily available, what’s going take? kids return school, unvaccinated putting lives risk every day. Ask questions, talk doctor get vaccine. Let’s put behind us.” not?  surprise occurring UK. India's curve same, even vaccines. Delta transmits communities quickly. look forward scientists explanation. Isn’t way viruses work complex often misunderstood concept? Mixed rapidly spreading delta variant, people US natural vaccine immunity ever before.

That may mean horrible wave ahead, subsides, immune system often memory combat future variants, even it’s 100%, make virus turn much manageable common cold like illness mixed yearly boosters?

I feel like talk worse case scenarios still never happened. halfway scenarios. seems like part problem news articles titles like these. Debate implies multiple sides threatening violence. not. Imagine teacher room unmasked kids can’t vaccinated. don’t pay teachers enough I’m sure applies fans. articles seems indicate applies staff individual tracks set rules spectators. Could wrong though. Oh is. Unfortunately, picked date back 2019 well covid. Sigh. Yes. dare we... *checks notes* .. try save lives. 

What monumental bunch assholes are. unvaccinated children? new flu strains every year. one description. google ind many articles.  I’m Anti Vax, let clear. got Pfiezer think everyone get it. encourage people get it. I’m going ignore either. I’ve got loved ones underlying conditions. What? think ""jab"" antivax thing? Fire falsifying government records. assume there'd relevant laws trial also.

The reason outbreaks stop repeated blanket screening entire cities, leads vast majority infected people picked up, often even become infectious.

The US: trust me, want right I'm boat minus kid,my mental health taken quite blow therapy help. Cant begin tell many times thought ending . can't that... I'll certainly wearing mask flu season. want wear much next guy know ever go another grocery store without mask sanitizing groceries. 

Maybe overkill I'd rather safe sorry really minor inconvenience. think it'd wise us adopt wearing masks crowds flu seasons. I'd like nuance bit: science never prescribes policy. There's always judgement call, weighing benefits negatives, scientific itself. Science provide supporting knowledge. roundabout numbers I've seen Alpha 50% transmissable original wild trpe strain Delta 50-60% transmissiable Alpha. Herd immunity means, ever meant, one thing easy measure. new cases due difficulty spreading resistant populations = herd immunity. x amount catch disease, amount get vaccinated, z talking point occurs. new cases.

Everything else attempt explain herd immunity might achieved (if even achieved now, increasingly unlikely). Yep. truth, issues. death death. people loved same. I'm curious news enough go public it, become national news statement rest band. also answer dude's question vaccinated phd concerns band, kicked pf studio too. I'd actually like hear concerning one guy could explain it, booking venues, that's nowhere article. extremely reactionary response downvoting fellow oblivion questions creates antivaxxers. I'm sure get voted shadow ream too, opinion. necessarily true: would matter? anything coronaviruses better flus mutate far less frequently (I'm talking functional mutations) drastically, including one. It’s plateauing, though. Cases probably level soon. hope don’t increase again. Well still does, many concurrent infections continuously happening. still doesn’t compare influenza, whose mutations actually *can* evade vaccines. expulsion. Glad see faculty using tenured status greater good! Friends 16 year old POTS Covid. need wheelchair senior year. thought Polio. Looked up? 1-2% paralysis rate. Given time people room called ""Parlor"" they're used hosting dead bodies family, think stuck, all.

So given rosy, sucker's view history. March Dimes punch faces in, people got spat on, counter movements--this nothing new.

The eerie silence White House is. 

A month ago Biden said breaking Virus like blocked Facebook something, two weeks ago live town hall spread misinformation Delta doubled vaccines save us.

And week articles people like Osterholm quoted best anyone get WH ""an official want named"" talking nobody knows plan is.

So--it's kinda feeling like square one. 

Israel's new guy flummonxed, case someone thinks political job. got new PM, first guy long time, Biden. Touted vaccines, says great everything going since took over, bam. Sudden surge. 

Only difference? He's talking people third shot, he's setting metrics shut exceed nationally, got nation put mask back numbers went back up. 

We need Americans aware situation really bad. need messaging top saying really bad.

Where it? It’s criminally negligent. Public inquiry prosecution every political leader responsible excess covid deaths. Well good thing tokyo huge multi country event going hospitals able care covid patient California recall good governors, f\*ck can't Florida recall inept ones? would back square one us all.

Not really, on-off switch. get better evading immunity, completely, setback, going way square one. There's guarantee happen though. current vaccines effective variants. simply point fretting next variant now, fretting next novel virus. might happen, might not. get tested highly contagious disease right area public go shopping clinic patients seeing dr non contagious disease? completely stop tests, we’ll drop zero cases.  Cases continue go forseeable. That's life. One week good weather decrease, week colder weather increase. Yes, luckily wearing mask huge inconvenience I’m thinking worth risk sending son back school (even knowing 4 year olds probably good wearing mask day need unmask eat).

However, IMO, US media done good enough job sowing fear entire pandemic given prevalent vaccine hesitancy. People **terrified** getting COVID19 transmitting risk; terrified enough take extremely small risk getting side effects safe lifesaving vaccine. anyway! may may stories people “mild” cases long term effects, plus don’t know long term impacts even mildest case anyone  Apparently Bill Lee (R - Tennessee) Facebook science group. is! remember (April 2020) 50% effective vaccine enough seek approval, time first coronavirus vaccination, even got one. gonna it? Mandate vaccines live shit rest lives. 2 choices.

Hopefully every restaurant, school, workplace, concert venue, stadium, airport world starts requiring vaccine proof shutting world protect anti-vaxxers option.

It’s bad hope private businesses right thing beat rather government stepping in. Except desantis objectively dumb trump. people grifting… however….  lot students watch siblings elearning last year. suck don’t option. husband work teach, fortunately works nights. article June, lot new information come since then. hope scan goes well don’t find anything bad 🤞 True, there's difference admissions people still hospital. tired changing goal posts. one week mask required indoors, next week required back required..soo annoying mask mandate airline travel ends September 13th. can’t see extending requiring vaccinations fly… know sub.  Posted there. Yeah unfortunately think Delta really increased need booster

And know lot companies frustrated FDA providing full authorization. Beyond public sentiment toward vaccine, mandating EUA vaccine much tougher sell one full auth. Delta (the airlines) said EUA-only driving factor they're requiring vaccines 

It's also hard social media companies combat misinfo saying ""iTs eMerGenCy aUthOriZed &amp; fully approved"" totally legitimate thing say currently  Respiratory viruses trade severity transmissibility severity hinders transmissibility. E.g. virus makes people ridiculously ill sheds phase die become less severe time — almost mechanically. SARS2 spread asymptotically it’s clear virus subject evolutionary pressures.

This sub one delusional places earth. Give fucking head shake. Month old article. lot changed past month. Moderna still seem protective Pfizer J&amp;J though. least according various case studies. Which, realistic scenario, far likely side effects vaccine. Stronger plague? point even deaths community mean nothing. assume factors. asking logic behind actions unreasonable people. Minds poisoned sake ad revenue entertainers reasonable person would believe. Fox's lawyers successfully argued point court. That's large part problem. ton people actually believe paid actors (to borrow phrase) legitimate harm done. Like [""War worlds"" radio actually caused widespread panic somehow lasted months years.

We counted recounted votes. Many got counted again. counted that. substantial widespread voter fraud Jan 6 still happened. People still convinced Biden somehow stole election. least popular president modern history, publicly failed literally everything entire life, somehow going win re-election landslide anything less could explained voter fraud.

We watched federal government, direction President, decided leave COVID response state local governments actively meddle supplies aid hurt Americans vote him; point governors enlisting sports teams smuggle medical supplies. Even though problem everywhere time exactly scale scope federal response. National emergency declared giving sorts emergency powers money problem actually help ***people****?* Actively promoting rubbish pseudoscience oval office, constantly contradicting medical experts refusing lead example. Masks could sign patriotism, still opinion. reasonable person see happen make smart choice involves little sacrifice pathetic there's resistance hesitancy first place. remembered attempted genocide facts come out. True. RemindMe! 5 years “COVID-19 apocalypse” fuck, oklahoma going wrong way. state motto. usual another biased article BBC, completely deliberately ignoring fact Kerala removed restrictions Eid triggered massive wave infections. shameless bunch hacks. medical professional. vaccinated, CDC lists 3-5 days suspected exposure [see incubation/symptom on-set looks like 14 days. DeSantis = Bobby Kotick???

He sounds like earnings call convincing investors spend money company... CDC fucked saying could ditch masks vaccinated. 

The science right. vax rate 50%, soon said average indoor mask rate dropped 20% absolute most. honor system failure. Yeah, let’s go Arkansas get road we’re it. Neither fucking heat balance entire planet, are. Spock aghast. mean straight anti vaxer rhetoric misleading information statement implies otherwise.

Half people taking amuch worse reactions expected, oh really. first half sounded okay second half sounded like anti vaxer statement. medical condition makes mild cold symptoms vaccination much body handle, covid would probably kill him. either got kicked leave house, kicked he's lying scumbag. Oh good. case? Yes. doctor might know less singer band, *definitely* spouted dumb crap basically giving people permission avoid vaccine flimsy reasons. something violate natural rights literally results people dying, yeah, fuck informed consent. Nobody gets consent breathe viruses spraying around everywhere. thought same, right looks like half population shockingly different reaction jabs expected

From Given personal medical history side-effect profile jabs, doctor advised get shot time. caught virus year ago, mild — confident I’d able handle again, I’m certain I’d survive another post-vaccination round **Guillain-Barré Syndrome**, dates back childhood evolved progressively worse lifetime. Unfortunately me, (and family — hoping keep around bit longer) risks far outweigh benefits. Since unable comply increasingly becoming industry mandate — recently decided unsafe around, studio, tour.

From [FDA News July Today, FDA announcing revisions vaccine recipient vaccination provider fact sheets Johnson &amp; Johnson (Janssen) COVID-19 Vaccine include information pertaining observed increased risk Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) following vaccination. GBS neurological disorder body’s immune system damages nerve cells, causing muscle weakness, severe cases, paralysis.

There systems. Interesting, said GBS first time GBH second, making think talking group b hemolytic strep. Oh, medical abbreviations, eternally obfuscating instead clarifying. Weird I, random loser Reddit, tougher *every single* member military hasn’t gotten vaccine. firing nurses. Well BAD pharmacists proven idiot wasted thousand vaccines. elite haven’t! Masa?! Bullet Club 4 LYFE going small set people recommended vaccinated. must suck immediately lumped antivaxxer morons.


My problem medical conditions. 
My problem anti vax event wear fucking mask. 

Most people understanding people health issues. That's us continue social distance wear masks despite vaccinated decision allows states mandate vaccines. current Supreme Court could much rule federal mandate. said, stick strictly states rights, federal government able lot stuff, including stuff *that* half country likes. friends different part NY told NYC may well different country ways. Maybe NYC trying help tourist industry... mean, I’m Florida hate here. I’d likely visit place could trust inside more. huntington beach redemption arc Canada (my two doses 2.5 months apart), guess eyes us next see happens.

 countries spreading doses interval? Come guys. really fair judge governor based ability keep constituents alive? kinda cringe standard. IDs free, ID facility DMVs everywhere, appointments time. Minorities ostracizing themselves. Well good go next month go get it. Literally who? Ok, ""they?"" referenced ""them"" twice. I'm time seen that- link? think people MS, autoimmune disease, better getting virus rather vaccine? include approval kids, too? help speed anything 12? That’s talking virus though ignoring social science IMO biggest blunder Pandemic literally known bad rhinoviruses colds going around. would definitely wait least month. Brits Canadians told wait four months second dose. 100%…I always 10% paralysis right side face still little bit neuropathy things considered complaints here…it’s 10 years summer got blue. definitely bit scared get vaccine want COVID even  got GBS Pfizer mRNA vaccine. many us, we're there. long, difficult four months. Bizarre first one hit nerve hurt, second one feel thing. shot randomly gonna hurt based exactly hit Basically thinks world live in. going accept huge hospitalization numbers spike. Healthcare workers damned. long death numbers don’t increase dramatically he’ll claim win.

From article think summarizes doesn’t care numbers aren’t bad: 

“DeSantis credited response COVID, focused vaccinating seniors nursing home residents, fact fewer Floridians dying last August. year ago, Florida averaging 180 COVID deaths per day early August spike, last week averaged 55 per day.” Woodstock 99 documentary, there’s clip stopping telling crowd molest crowd surfing girls. last 24 hours, learned guy 20+ years. went “pretty fly white guy” “pretty smart good guy”. Molecular Biologist, dude Doctor Molecular Biology. doctoral thesis research HIV. Dexter really knows shit here. saying is...you understand difference scientific paper news report paper 🤣 are.  


I’m Broward County Florida, friends teachers. majority kids suffer dire consequence, disabled students teachers, employee, will. 

Again, little sympathy adults choose vaccinate- but, pregnant women? honestly think would hard choice. Parents students compromised immune systems forced choose job insurance staying home kid rather sending school? Another hard choice. choose wear mask public help them.  


Don’t think don’t resentments- do. client got kidney transplant sister, goes around without mask (but can’t pet dog germs). doesn’t mean I’m going best help others best. you’re it, please give call idiot Texas. Here’s best way reach him.

I sometimes forget vaccine roll slower outside America. guys must watching us thinking we’re bunch spoiled lunatics—I would. Florida particular pretty uh... special. *zero* restrictions. even laws preventing restrictions like mask wearing. hospitals burdened longer accept patients now. one wants lockdowns, lot us want vaccine mandates (for example, 40% health care professionals unvaccinated. includes nursing home staff). 

We different experiences. interesting see shapes world coming years. received first shot week ago. long wait? think matters. longer arguing anti-vaxxers. giving private public entities ability mandate vaccinations without excessive fear litigation. pretty much near guarantee we'll see around 3 billion deaths within 5 years, world filled people right thing can't wait die set punishment look happened Ohio. Trump strangle hold part. endorses DeSantis, win.  Come man Source? “The so-called FDA!” Goal posts moved hard core. Not… JAB!!!  may saying it, true? imaging family reasoning: “Hey, grab kids, let‘s go Florida dump couple grand Disney aren’t requiring masks … golden opportunity.”  
Most people plan vaccinations months advance. Sounds like full shit. illegal Covid?  reported misinformation. Maybe openly honestly state truth works effective dosing regimen instead deciding change recommendations cater boneheads already paying attention evidence? approving vaccine authorizing booster soon might also offer conflicting messages effectiveness.

I'm pissed this. Basically denying booster shot trying convince anti-vax people.

Like dude, no. let people want boosters get boosters, anti-vaxx people want stop trying convince them. going convince anyway. talked pharmacists agree go get shot. isn’t Tuskegee government fucked shit behind people’s backs, though.There’s active pandemic that’s going since last
March. 

I empathy trauma US done fucked shit, especially black Americans (assassination King, Malcolm X, bombing black Wall Street, MOVE bombings, etc), can’t see difference here, society leave unvaccinated black community behind.

It’s systemic racism, nobody barring getting shot. So, longer come play?  Likely buying/selling/trading drugs. Getting fake Id met first dealer Nice We’ll need masks Gringo Bandito hot sauce best! seriously get people get vaccine. I'm ready CDC fully approve vaccine, states start making mandatory. Theres already many mandatory vaccines get childhood, none significant issues, one vaccine going do? Bravo this. Couldn’t agree That's fucking hilarious. Exactly PhD would zero tolerance. Nana ? DeSantis Abbott take turns sucking Trump’s dick. Remember assured us matter vaccine got?   also drive places even come house. Might want check around call doctor. Right??! Aww poor woobies! That’s happened strain flu 1918, right? Isn’t one two prominent endemic strains now? husband opinion SARS-COV-2 going end way wasn’t ever “going away.” Well yearly/semi-yearly/whatever timeframe COVID vax yearly flu vax, that’ll status quo next pandemic. **Aug. 4, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

Models gross abstraction process.  Nothing little bleach can't fix...  spiral I’m published scientist directly studied (and published on) covid infection also impacts vaccine autoimmune diseases. Vaccines best chance beat covid. able vaccinated, get vaccinated. vaccines CAN, certain circumstances, cause autoimmune disease. history autoimmune disease, like GBS, inflammation (which required effective vaccination) exacerbate autoimmune disease. everyone get vaccinated. everyone gets vaccinated develops protective immunity. That’s whole point herd immunity. It’s really shitty discriminate people cannot get vaccinated MEDICAL REASONS. Many people infected covid develop proper immune responses, general infected important still get vaccinated. simple antibody test would show titters comparable someone vaccinated. reason couldn’t this. even didn’t good titers, let ask this: someone vaccinated whatever reason body unable generate adaptive immune response, would fire them? many people get vaccine can’t develop response. Again, whole point herd immunity.

so- shrug- need accept isn’t work patience kindness (me included). wear mask public help risk also wearing mask- don’t protect themselve, continue put risk situations- won’t feel guilt responsibility. go home hug dad (who heart failure, vaccinated) feel like asshole. diidn't contact trace attended last year. .  

Those numbers made everyone attended left Sturgis went back communities America brought covid them.  


It year, except Delta variant lot less safe. Covid certainly anybody went unvaccinated serious risk. 

Honestly, fuck ‘em. vaccine proving incredibly effective. near-zero sympathy anyone vaccine eligible hasn’t gotten it. plenty opportunities unvaccinated people contract virus, I’m much concerned bars restaurants outdoor music festival.  Yes. Maybe I’m asshole here, dunno. hope he’s using incidental medical history bridge onto political aversion vaccine.

I'm pro-vax, way explanation:

It's identity. vaxing statement political beliefs. taken away big deal. Subverting system way doubling identity.

Falsifying vax record would pretty open-and-shut Honor Code violation result expulsion. mean, free. sure second jab top might help nominal percentage (not doctor, work take grain salt). Adding +2 armor empty slot better not, right? country New York resides in, we’re talking per article post, already opened many 18 (12 currently) opening 6 months-11 likely coming months. countries speak often held 18 supply issues, U.S. doesn’t supply issues, also don’t rely “other” countries determine guidelines regulations anyways. Gotta keep em vaccinated! FDA waiting tho? Yeah. People zero risk tolerance mindset. Apparently J&amp;J vaccine 100 cases 12.5 million doses administered (source). It’s ridiculously low incidence, he’s person increased baseline risk. 

Honestly, blame deferring J&amp;J shot, even chances seeing GBS complications incredibly rare.

But, far tell, seen evidence GBS resulting mRNA vaccines (Moderna/Pfizer). IMO, chance another GBS occurrence would Super Powerball winning percentage. Dang! Getting drug using sleep switching Melatonin benefits thought! also working great get sleep!  Mayor Lightfoot genius. I’m sure come something… unvaccinated idea exclusion put through. We're seeing businesses HAD. IT. actually following doctor's advice, problem it.

I also problem band wanting work someone unvaccinated. world perfect. members band loved ones want infect. hire another drummer, he's founding member, missing gig, like number people missing good work covid. Got hit paywall. article mention percentage kids long-term symptoms? believe odds escape mutations occuring actually decrease active infections decline. said, believe variants choose track/name future less potent due necessarily high similarity w OG strain. Oh gosh. misunderstood. implication cognitive abilities, it’s purely comparison dumbass. Thanks clarification. statement reading comprehension problems meant pejorative? you’re helpful again?
Lost? Ok, big shooter. internet today. Congrats, guess? Link correct data. misinterpreting CDC data hospitalizations? Pants like masks butt. Experimental Use Authorizations allow use unapproved medication declared emergency.  created Congress normally FDA approval usually takes several many years lot paperwork ..

The widespread successful uses EUA doubt cited evidence vaccines safe enough &amp; effective enough get FDA approval. People google something, read quickly see fits viewpoint WORST.

Edit: neither support oppose information third vaccine tweeked formula given third time? explicitly saying ""isn't illegal something?"" anyone wondering:

No ""cases"" matter since depend much testing do. 


And spare ""researchers"", 90% heard pandemic ""experts"" wrong, terrible models predictions bad person 1 year statistics school could debunk.


The fact average age infections gone much clear indication virus largely left older people untouched despite super contagious, older people almost vaccinated.

Infections COVID fully vaccinated targets still happen, pretty rare, left young people generally vaccinated. That's large pool, couple fact school ended run ways virus spread people spread to. taken study context. 1 20 children hospitalised Covid, 1 20 April 2020 January 2021, identified 52 cases children less 18 years old neurological complications among 1,334 children hospitalised COVID-19"" probably worse since chose tell vaccinated people get tested while.

Just preview we'll handle climate change, new pandemics, antibiotic-resistant bugs, Etc. Well, technically correct, maybe.

New hospital admissions (according CDC data):

7/30: 1842 
7/31: 1768 
8/1: 1668

Of course recent data treated provisional potential reporting delays.

DeSantis suck shit available data indicate *maybe* daily hospitalizations peaked 7/30. hope true. GOP terrified real C19 numbers. Man, looking previous UK surge vs latest one:

Last surge: ~60k cases day

Deaths: 1,242 day

Latest surge: 47k cases day

deaths: 83 day

that's 75% cases, even 10% death rate. That's pretty good indication well vaccines work. Using expiring doses boosters fine, think wants avoid wealthy countries ordering hundreds millions new doses use immediate boosters rest world still waits dose one.

We really need encourage vaccinated people start viewing COVID another minor disease catch snd like cold. cases long COVID hospitalizations along vaccinated rare media hyping leading kind insane though process “well I’ve waited year half foe vaccine, it’s still good enough even outside everyone vaccinated.” That’s fucking ridiculous, happening messaging around piss poor everyone else vaccinated statistically \*remarkably\* safe, Holland \*knows\* - understanding statistical data big part PhD microbiology. gets little extra safety ANYONE established business, enforces one employees business *no real purpose asserting will.*

The people potentially significant increased risk drummer people made personal decision vaccinated. Holland's job force people take precautions believes necessary. job sit there, play guitar, entertain audience.

If truly believe sentiment comment, feel even worse you. finite doses vaccine does. least within timeframe ending pandemic soon possible. booster doses might increasing efficacy 10-20% could instead used initial doses places without increasing global immunity far per dose. Well well surprise. ppffftt. Unless live area hospitals overwhelmed turning away patients. Vaccines aren’t protecting yourself. Lmaoooo mean risk probably small... remembered article long lost virus pathogen recently discovered frozen ice. Sigh.  Amazing different reporting first day week week increase vs first day week week decrease.

When cases started drop, took week media outlets believe it’s real. Minimal risk. respiratory infection. Trust me, smallpox pandemic would 99% vax rates anti-vaxxers anti-universal healthcare too....

Either vaccine works protect us doesn't. can't hide hole next decade we're fully vaccinated. Obama everything could've right.  people responding saying “we ever cared hospitalization data here” BS. data sub ecstatic back November last year protection infection, hospitalization. people told November vaccine 50% effective infection (rather 95%), would dismayed.

The drop protection infection serious implications herd immunity, also negative impact ability drop public health measures. Claiming care ability starve hospitalization short-sighted. or, fking birthday happens every year lol....  Cool, know one post this, file *one more* article pointing 'duh, yeah, fucking shit, Sherlock' information pile. 2 Moderna shots disagree I’m anti-vax. continued posts begging government implement vaccine passports.

I acknowledge, CDC, vaccines aren’t magic shield think are. major religions practiced United States, Church Christ, Scientist (whose adherents known ""Christian Scientists"") Dutch Reformed Church two religious groups openly discourage vaccination.

Source:  Yes, that's masking public for. reason I'm irritated get people attacking efficacy vaccines without data. I've seen lot baseless claims vaccine curb transmission. We're fighting misinformation war push increase vaccinations yet.  mean duuuUuuuuuUuuuuuuuuUuuh r/NoShitSherlock drop 7 day average slowing past week almost nothing, actually increased today. one hand, get it. Getting vaccine rest world overall save lives end pandemic quicker

But other, fuck that, give booster safe Thanks Captain Obvious! absolute must actually prove vaccines safe actually work efficiently children, even important thanks Delta.

I personally feel masks needed public spaces like airports, hospitals, schools, large gatherings like festivals concerts on. CDC's pivot based P-town study pretty bogus, agree. Masking always benefit unvaccinated, nothing else. Lol I'm glad work profit motivated sector. Putting profit lives big brain time. Miss please. hey work private sector! matters profits. cares quality life, happiness, advancement human race? I’m person mask alone car. reason 99% laziness forgetfulness. I’m lazy taking take off, I’m likely forget it, go back car grab mask, etc. 


That 1% go hard singing car music without people seeing weird ass expressions. Duh? large population US cannot yet vaccinated, children 12. Delta need get almost 85% total population vaccinated herd immunity effective. Wrong way around - claim smart medical professional thoroughly fed antivaxx nonsense. 

To fair Pete, think came kind ruse. think genuinely believed reason people believing plausible. someone somewhere thought disguise dangerous message reasonable sounding framework, seems perpetuating good faith. That's vaccine mistrust spreads. 

I honesty worry amount blind trust placed someone's assertion doctor told vaccinate. doctors never wrong, misquoted, (in America especially) corrupt.  No, Commission mandate it. national governments decided implement it. ID, system links databases together. 

My point US federation reason can't vaccine passport, literally every country one.  Yet  Oh goodness, fucking love that. feel you, though! Hahaha many things say reading headline brings tears vaccines US…what’s right word…fungible?

Best part still meeting clients idea outbreak not. Apparently we’re following state mandate. tried show messed is, know? mixes Astra Zeneca Pfizer right? UK also find Pfizer 88% effective symptomatic Delta infections. fucked anyways, Delta Comfort Plus. Can't admit hospital hospital already full *taps forehead*  huge question lot people sad see downvoted.. got vaccinated weeks ago, I'm still wary potentially getting spreading virus asymptomatically, everything I've read regarding sterile immunity basically amounted ""we certain anything yet"". Taking chance shit like could taking chance accidentally killing relative lot people.. gladly keep masking social distancing there's data (though admit enjoy face covered public excuse interact people 💩) Actually probably even less people take booster shot. bad side effects avoid booster, took initially get college, travel etc media help throwing blanket statements big scary numbers. That's reasonable. here? Well check, didnt stop people know. Idiots much time hands whine wearing mask based huge leaps logic hypocritical reasoning. need read article. ""but purposefully rushed approval can't trust it!"" Would second generation mutation variant? Like Delta’s child? Well thanks vote confidence, starting think taking crazy pills something. would absolutely foolish throw doses could used boosters can't used elsewhere. Unfortunately, US handled many things foolishly. Approved 12 kids? I’m sure would like nothing done, finish gathering &amp; analyzing data, adult &amp; teen age groups. can’t cut corners, even we’d like too. 

I’m also desperate see approved &amp; anxious bc read headlines 1-2 weeks ago FDA may asking Pfizer include even children latest pediatric trial. would mean even linger delay 😫😭

That’s goes though. can’t skip important steps, can’t. there’s already least one variant spreading around follow behind delta here. Vaccinated, wear mask anymore. People make whatever assumptions want, Colorado wearing masks anymore. Yeah obvious anyone paying attention.

By large, lockdowns mandates protecting people want lockdowns mandates.

And us normal, vaccinated people, it’s really hard say “fuck em, funeral. part, let live life. That's still whole lot people. Survey also finds sun sets night rises morning. let you? tested &amp; approved? assume weekly tests free. kinda means they're subsidized students got vaccinated, charged it'd incentive forget vaccine cards order pay.  week ""When idiots power""!! Duh. Oh boo hoo Every time someone tells FDA approved, ask they'll get vaccinated is. always say won't. respond pointing lack FDA approval thus never actually part objection first place bringing disingenuous derail, good faith argument. mass testing sites wont spread infection everyone goes get tested?

considering contagious version is.  im sure much time zone much even mask+distancing.


non delta seemed like spend hour + room someone unprotected. 1000 times load seems like even several minutes could hazardous nonvaccinated MIL same. works school got fired caught covid spread building. children wearing masks face shields. also wanted hold baby sick. 

Shes well head. best part is, people swear survived vaccine. omega variant comes.  always make perfect decisions first time forever evil. I'm bit surprised he's 60, seeing hair turn gray office. UNC Board Governors selected State Legislature.  extremely regressive. reality always risk long covid, way risk long flu long term effects viral infections. always going chance getting long covid, chance small. new data going prove vaccines eradicate long covid. willing go work now, never go back, since COVID around foreseeable. Awww feewings get hurt🥺😂 Look, wear masks followed advice quarantines start. keep following rules I’m lawful good.

But even wonder end. COVID already endemic mutates quickly, it’s going us years come. years vaccines booster shots effective, times won’t be.

Statistically, virus hasn’t deadly children par flu. understand every death tragic. also acknowledge don’t actually ever put practice policies would stop preventable deaths. (If did, we’d lower speed limits 35mph. would certainly stop preventable death cost minor inconvenience traveling. Everyone knows someone died car accident, deaths occurred speeds higher 35mph.)

The standard can’t “we end restrictions eradicate covid.” We’ve intentionally eradicated one disease human history: smallpox. transmissible mutates faster. can’t “we end restrictions there’s preventable death” covid always us. standard something like “we end restrictions death rate nears flu’s death rate adults children.” 

That’s sucky still death. think people frustrated/skeptical nobody government clear end here. tragic reality life. reality, child twice likely die car accident year covid. strep throat. pneumonia. influenza. bacterial meningitis.

the reality simple. world fucked up, many young lives get cut short. Exactly. Eventually every country ask many daily deaths willing accept go back normal. UK government already answered. virus behave differently somehow appears far less contagious.

What basing on? Guangzhou Nanjing outbreaks, hundreds people infected within weeks initial Also, began one person lunacy.

Each new outbreak China caused single inbound international traveler. initial patient often identified basis genetic sequencing virus detected patient already contagious infected others.

That's true. new outbreak China, first detected infection tip iceberg. One person showed hospital Guangzhou, led nearly 200 infected people eventually discovered. exactly Again, numbers work magic.

I'm trying understand point view, seems everything saying happen - like virus spreading rapidly first detected infection one many - exactly what's happened China. caring human would given Flint better opinion happen national level many state governors refuse. UK see much relevant comparison USA.

In fact, UK even see death spike period Delta wave.

Also think honest mistake thousands cases week kids, thousands deaths per week kids. scaremongering sub getting control. Lamba big threat, know variant 1 year, effect vaccines beta got enough transmissiblity dominate delta. Look chile cases jump lambda even use There's shortage idiots point stupid idiot, even magical vaccine person still scared shitless. “Mostly normal”😂😂😂

And even though it’s rule #1 subreddit, still can’t manage civil. Canada really took mixed approach, like said - provided two doses age groups high prevalence deaths complications, doctors, rest population, focused spread. 

I think proof pudding, take look recent spike cases U.K. driven by. inherent problems significant portion population sick covid, even likely survive - hospitalizations going go up, overall population level 'viral load' going higher. know Delta puts confounding complications mix, looking data see efficacy single dose significant. end, Canada high protection vulnerable, good protection everyone else. Today Ontario 130ish cases, population 14million, around weeks - saw slight uptick dozen cases day, already seems subsiding (I guess we'll see next week so). vast majority active cases unvaccinated well. Okay, put way, Catholic Church doesn’t believe contraceptives exist show one Remember Chinese videos people falling spot China, lol.

Well obvious. saying Fauci Biden saying vaccinated don’t need wear masks anymore causes unvaccinated people take masks anyone know would happen. proving point. Yet downvote me.

Given far active case data looks UK im suspicious metric certainly using reply people patronising italics    zero risk. much lower risk unvaccinated person. I'm young, healthy, vaccinated (and ULTRA hot spot) I'm eating restaurants. can't make decision you, think risk vaccinated person substantially greater many risks I've accepted casually life. There's chance I'll catch it, I'll almost certainly something like cold flu, person live (vaccinated, young, healthy) wife who's restaurant me, I'm wfh coworkers infect.

Sinovac efficacy (8.6 million people considered study, probably number considers vaccinated control group)

58.5% symptomatic Covid (down 67% last study)

86% hospitalization

89.6% ICU admission

86.4% death



Pfizer (4.5 million):

87.4% symptomatic Covid (down 94%)

97% hospitalization

98% ICU admission

100% death



Astrazeneca (first real world results Chile), 2.8 million people: 

68.7% symptomatic Covid

100% hospitalizations, ICU admissions deaths.  newer, actually new. adverse reactions inflammatory responses. Eliciting inflammatory response whole idea. adverse reaction children experiencing mild form myocarditis cleared couple weeks. likely tuned much inflammation need eliciting children provoke desired antibody production levels. don’t think here.. funeral homes.

Florida: Putting *fun* back funeral! Yes know far go. far. 70% country 1 shot. 12 shots months.

There exponential increase. Wonder governor blame ""Media Hysteria""? definitely help solve problem, right?! way overcomplicating it.

And yes, also can't wait get 10 month old 6 year old vaccinated like parents. then, limit indoors wear masks cautious data Downvoting data ludicrous. Look link. 3,299 18 WHOLE PANDEMIC hospitalized.   Seems like everything I’ve read assistance program mess, lot blame falls states getting right people. mandatory back summer?! ridiculous require vaccinations allowed one political one. virologist? Studies shown vaccination leads probably better immune response (both antibodies cells) infection.

Correct, infection viral loads vary wildly, lead varied amounts anti-bodies. vaccines, doses specific should, part, load similar anti-bodies people.  last GOP called media hysteria ended covid - 55 days hospital intubated needed liver transplant. It’s hysteria though. would like picture face...that’s it, see surprised look 🤦🏼‍♂️ not. admins would get list people organization current vaccination stats. vaccinated ordered get shot certain date. Happens every year flu shot.

Sure, might complain procrastinate, think vastly overestimating many career military people outright defy order. thing happened anthrax vaccine declined, especially started getting discharged. Poverty correlates intelligence. count people covid natural immunity, well conservative estimates people asymptomatic, likely herd immunity example, late last year Jeffrey Tucker showed World Health Organization (WHO) suddenly, “for reasons unknown,” changed definition “herd immunity.” Using screenshots cached version Internet Archive, Tucker showed altered definition way erase completely role natural immunity. Before, rightly said “happens population immune either vaccination immunity developed previous infection.” WHO’s change stated happens “if threshold vaccination reached.” long Tucker’s piece appeared, restored natural immunity definition.

This conversation. I'd like someone make genuine, good faith argument natural antibodies people covid counter towards herd immunity. enough unvaccinated people fill hospitals places. 

Unless think unvaccinated infected people magically safe getting sick. Honestly, new real info comes posts repeating themselves. shit. Really need expert tell I'm currently hunting 3rd dose immunity first 2. medication infuse every 6 months wipes B cells immunity along them. I'll probably need booster every 6 months long goes on. So...fun times! claims seems personal medical history side-effect profile jabs, doctor advised get shot time.

Hard see doctor would make claim basis belief. 

Either way, leaving even medical exemption legit seems reasonable. 50,000 people hospital. require experts? requires 1st grade intro communicable diseases understand. needle bigger second vaccine dose? barely felt first Pfizer jab could definitely feel needle pierce skin second one. Maybe second nurse bad day, lol. gotta keep 'em separated.  1.	You’re condescending ass. 2. Half military already vaccinated. 3. Active duty already heavily vaccinated. vaccinated contract covid, get paid missed time. Hmm, tried insufferable murderous prick? deadly disease air borne? Also, 2% US population would 6 million people. Assuming everyone gets it, ok 6 million people dying, correct? I’ll grant that. I’m still going listen doctors whose specialties lie fields relevant studies I’d listen one not. Again, it’s cancer related call opinion. sit down. Nope. like Sturgis.

Yeah that’s I’d large percentage military already vaccinated -- going huge issue. What's huge issue outbreak COVID limits military preparedness. parents live FL (thankfully vaccinated, they’re elderly). think he’s great job. 50% America vaccinated

Not quite. least, **fully** vaccinated. 57% total population 1 shot. understand helps, it’s important note **especially** Delta variant discussions third shot may needed combat it.

Herd immunity always going 70%, tbh. professionals thought least 80% Delta. it’s 80-90% consensus.

In words, it’s going happen. literally linked actual hospitalizations across whole United States. bother open it? 

And please link 50k covid patients hospitals right now. Jesus. fucking link right there. That's wild. far things would cause lower chance kids go, covid vaccine pretty damn far list. *Fully approving vaccine authorizing booster soon might also offer conflicting messages effectiveness.*

There's conflict here: vaccine works well, even better.

I wish they'd focus promoting best science rather essentially trying mislead people right thing. deception approach backfired horribly masks last year. call heartless, year half staying house got vaccine maybe onus vulnerable part. I’d like go visit parents see siblings, haven’t done like two years. listen carefully hear people running onto field pick goalposts. new percentages are: 58.49% symptomatic infection COVID-19, ""remains significant,"" advisor said. Meanwhile, 86.02% effectiveness preventing hospitalization; 89.68% preventing admission ICU; 86.38% death.

In words, ""if entire population vaccinated Coronavac, 86 every 100 would died, continues good population performance,"" Araos said. summary: ""protection infection COVID-19 falls protection important outcomes maintained,"" added. I’m confident. Mostly stunads like talk sides ass, pretending know better every public health professional planet. Cut bullshit already. problem. Oh word “wane” btw. native English speakers would know that. actually country? asking Bc lot misinformation foreign sources dubious motives gets sprayed subreddits like diarrhea. [the data says people saying small percentage head sand refusing trust science quote says ""clinical trials,"" think 10,000 unless I'm misremembering. 
I'm wondering that's case general population though. happened crowded major events? sounds like brain damage. Surely checked? still requiring vaccine proof festivals venues.

And guess business feel like requiring masks better idea? less effective social easier...really get it.

We're dumdums That's seems like lawsuit waiting happen. Imagine sick teacher comes in, gives child winds ICU. first I’ve heard funding loss… kind crazy Right. 13x bigger UK though, point. ""I'm young enough, I'd rather give [the vaccine] people need it. need it. I'm healthy, young individual continue work health.

""I think taking vaccine away someone needs good thing. dad perfect example. got [the vaccine] early he's diabetic. People like need get it. mom got it. want take away ability.

""Now time goes on, [the vaccine] mainstream, really, really mainstream, yeah.""

This guy colossal idiot.

Back January, limited availability much greater demand supply, sure. young athlete skip line take vaccine dose away elderly immunocompromised person would horrible.

Now, though, making excuses anti-vax. enough supply anyone wants it, walk in. one wants vaccine getting lack availability. People getting vaccinated today choosing get to. simple.

His comments fiction young people immune one age group gets hospitalized dies. Maybe shadow ICU nurse Florida get little insight misguided beliefs. graduated 1993 sympathize. Sucks student level today. Well, end undergrad, Master's PhD program especially need learn live miserable anyway. interesting see people's feelings BLM track covid beliefs. observation. They’re significantly less effective delta though. Israel published report week ago saying Pfizer 39% effective preventing infection delta, UK also says they’re seeing huge drop efficacy delta. quite bad Israel reported, ballpark.

Though we’re still period uncertainty. CDC says vaccinated person probably spread delta rate unvaccinated person, Israel says vaccine cuts infectivity half.

There’s lot don’t know right now. Everyone agrees severe outcomes lot less likely vaccine, long COVID bit less common vaccinated (though 20% still terrifyingly high). looks like consensus building vaccinated particularly well protected contracting spreading delta, though unlikely die. Policymakers quite touch. next Purge movie could adapt concept. thats case, wonder many people infected within hours time? probably staggering nationwide.... would finically crippling large portion population help lmfao Check subs. They’re happy DeSantis, all.  health professional honestly, best solution seems US donate vaccine doses countries don’t enough, especially African countries, 10% partial vaccination rate. enough demand, sending countries low vax rates (and *higher* vax willingness us) help prevent variants appearing.

As far I’m aware none major variants came US, maybe key prevent spread elsewhere. amen you’re vaccinated don’t children, go. Thank you, appreciate response. again, pointing specific actions one country try explain entire region performed better.

It true China Korea dramatically better contact tracing Germany. also true Japan substantially worse contact tracing Germany.

There good contact tracing China, Korea, Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore.

There bad contact tracing Japan, Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar, Laos.

Yet countries dramatically better outcomes every country Europe, North America Latin America.

In group East Asian countries great contact tracing, *markedly better* results. China Korea lower mortality rates compared Japan, Japan still 10x better tiny fraction people Southeast Asia exposed novel bat coronaviruses

This known, currently unknowable. even complete catalogue bat coronaviruses, hundreds, never tested population antibodies vast majority Chinese perspective, unwillingness Europeans andAmericans end outbreaks countries -something entirely doable - completely baffling.

And saying one reason perspective might wrong failure consider naive reproductive rate virus different populations.

I would love hear perspective Peru could possibly beat back virus, say *entirely doable*. country ridiculously draconian restrictions year. Massive, massive disruptions daily life reduce mobility social contact. Peru launched mobile contact tracing app April 2020. universal masking enforced guys guns.

What want country stop pandemic, killed 0.5% entire population?

You can't throw hands point sociological phenomenon everyone assumes true. point specific measures reduce mobility, test trace, physically stop transmission occurring, contrast best examples Asia, cases like Japan, government done nearly nothing, population still closely congregates large numbers.  End game everyone gets people die. else there?

You don’t need therapist tell it’s gonna ok ain’t. Life never is. percentage thread ain’t gonna live end year due car accidents, heart attacks, etc. 

Live moment, managing personal risk, let take takes you. 1/3 country talking 'uncaring society', makes sense fear that. translate section answer article, basically two categories deaths Covid, confirmed probable.

Ah, explains it. Sinovac's numbers vs deaths also rose bit - 80% study yes, Pfizer skewed towards young people, AZ beginning also skewed given men 45+ women 60+.

What mean since 50+ age group predominantly vaccinated Sinovac, either way Pfizer &amp; AZ data going mostly sampled younger population. Considering that, seems AZ &amp; Sinovac perform less similarly, Pfizer better. However, would interesting see CIs Pfizer &amp; AZ since doubts really 100% efficacy vs deaths (and vs hospitalizations &amp; ICU AZ), probably simply enough samples big CI.

I wonder many people vaccinated AZ total though moment Chile halted rollout completely, added age restrictions mentioned. wish would tell split study cohort vaccine. covid 18 months ago. still antibodies. said, get vaccine, feel like I’m going covid again, safe assume I’ll get shots without side effects? question:

Yes government subsiding it. you’re getting government coverage without providing social security number. already addressed earlier comment said whether it’s private government insurance you’re tracked. government simply handing pharmacies money based honor system. It’s obvious idea you’re talking about. even get vaccine? Yes 40s definitely known era peace longevity.  here. respond thread titles without reading post content. Humans stink communication :) going endemic. People get unfortunately die even vaccinated. said, it’s stupid ignore major benefits vaccinated. hope loved ones everyone else’s best stay safe keep others safe healthy well throughout PLEASE don’t undermine benefits vaccine focusing hospitalization  ""If kid dies, make another one!"" ~pro-lifers probably. people, punish whenever however possible. Give shitty service. Refuse them. Fire them. Throw applications away. Shame them, eternally.


Nice. Floridians tell us like live right now?     Where's quote? Also ~7k positive according tested ~77k mother fucking 11% positivity rate. Holly molly! 🤣 died excess stupidity. I'm still aghast someone making final decision could aware public would behave. Lol that's whole lot words say ""i care people"" 

You're purposely obtuse prove point I'm even arguing. blast dude, coming understanding.

My kids twelve vaccinated. care kids neighbors kids. friends idiot short sighted parents sentiments like yours. school start again. dumb kid kills kids classmates, lets circle back finish chat people would hospital vaccination rate *higher?* explain that? took year get bacterial pneumonia! kids compare highest flu death count past 10 years. Also, like said, far.  Yeah, understanding it’s highly improbable COVID-19 evolve new spike independently. fear might intermingle another coronavirus steal spike it. idea likely is, probably aren’t ton people infected COVID-19 another coronavirus time, pool eligible hosts isn’t huge.

But mask wearing would help prevent infection another strain coronavirus, might help prevent evolution vaccine immune variant COVID.  I’m sure that’ll go well crowd There’s also group people— included— vaccinated getting back life, may include crowds wearing mask. 

Just like isn’t always one right way things, unmasked people see street store willingly unvaccinated. 

These articles surveys divide already divided country. It’s pathetic. think Standardized Testing get. capitalism works, money social power.

If experts listened benefits elites, say lot experts?  two problems this:

1. Children unable vaccinated, suffer approach. Prior variants/the vaccine plan hope suffering could get good levels school started. That’s case here.

2. risk another variant, exactly Dr. Fauci talking about. Say got new variant immune vaccines, means it’s also immune whatever antibodies already COVID have. like massive reset button, we’re back Feb 2020, we’re super tired it.

For 1 likely see effects real soon, schools open back up. There’s probably nothing point.

For 2 hypothetical, real one people (including Dr. Fauci) really worried about. hope doesn’t happen, real terrifying possibility. Scientists public health pros think ""the boat."" That's they're telling people who've Covid need vaccinated. There's merit it. extraordinary circumstance calls something different vaccinated opinion folks eligible vaccination choose to. push comes shove I've keeping mask kids people can't get vaccinated actual medical reason, folks immunocomprised vaccines less effective. lot people asshole friends family can't say to, assholes lie family friends vaccination status get disinvited gatherings. I'm protecting second degree separation people can't see Covid. ""official""

...

""punk""

.... honestly believe reason side fence mask wearing it’s inconvenience wear store? Faces mostly protein option working home make office least 3 days week. Feels better office cause puts ""work mode"". also means lot socialize coworkers. ""wearing mask home"" part became sure troll comment. Yes, non-influenza pandemics historically lasted 4-5 years, rather 1-2 year lengths influenza pandemics. People hopefully COVID passing quickly. heard muddy pig wrestling popular not? anything, kids flexible adults. issue school districts hotspots aren’t offering options required masks virtual learning. Many parents aren’t comfortable sending unvaccinated kids school environment. 

While kids may risk, still spreaders data says 137, 288, 124, 37 pediatric deaths 2008-09, 2009-10, 2010-11, 2011-12 US influenza seasons, respectively. age group data indicates 0-17 year US comparatively little prevent children getting H1N1 pandemic compared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. kids something worry read about. think people would think twice actions would risk ruined financially? screenings come outbreak. before.

They happen *during* outbreak. They're one measures cause outbreak quick fix

It's quick fix. massive effort screen virtually every person. PCR tests sensitive. single testing sweep population, find infections. quarantine close contacts, even fewer infections slip net. repeat process every days, find every infection pretty quickly. Hospitals open business! Business booming! healthcare system designed cheap. Pace supply limited campaign steady, apart things like ruining batch quite predictable.

Pace demand limited one unpredictable jumpy. Key political decisions mandates could alter demand large bursts overnight. lasted two days pretty much came went. fine one day, sick two basically better third full recovery dya four False. You’re regurgitating blatantly false nonsense. see required 2022-2023 school year places.  Humans learned live cancer wreaks havoc throughout population. 

You also taking account get greater understanding covid good chance vaccines treatments improve time. static situation.

Holy crap, chose pet political beliefs grandchild? Sure none word ""symptomatic"" word show document used search. 

I using document linked, according criteria document, positive PCR test symptoms still ""confirmed case"" ""suspected case"" Considering daily cases much higher Florida daily deaths double, I’m guessing difference “active cases” calculated. World meter aggregates data different sources. sources using different definitions won’t try account fir differences.  That’s ended do. helped get see recovered I’m remission. really doesn’t help anything literally hate people.  really dude🙄 complication X due covid? simply die traces covid them? 


They're different things. someone shot chest, lives make hospital, died 2 days later, tests comes back shows covid, die Covid, gushot wound chest? think answer obvious. It’s dumb comparison quite frankly mentality comfortable coming vaccine passports indicates you’re insane kind crazy me, it’s literally never done it’s frankly rather large infringement basic ability go places. 

Like fine whatever want make sure everyone safe Covid need it’s like little thing that’s asked it’s big one there’s really way doesn’t stay rather long time. area Gerrymandered shit?

There's problem fucks lot voting. He's new Trump terrifying. He's allowing constituents die popularity Lol, usually don’t look post histories usually don’t think people need religion maybe do. Talk angry little boy. virus nose throat area, expelled nose mouth infect others. DeSantis blocking else would propose do? options fight best pivot throw hands accept millions people going die.

We’re fighting virus learning time.  Okay 75-85% effectiveness CDC’s rough estimate protection vaccines provide transmissible infection reviewing evidence stats — means vaccinated person 75-85% less likely infected unvaccinated person. 3-fold thing bit harder interpret — think they’re trying say based Israeli data comfortable lower bound safety? certain there, they’re saying communicated vaccinated individual 3x less likely get infected unvaccinated person. Yeah, fortunate gifted *The Great Influenza* early pandemic I’ve returned times since sense context. 

I think it’s likeliest see two waves (the current one one fall/winter) watch recede endemicity. That's simply true. Covid count 416 18. 2014-2015 flu 803. I'm saying 416 bad course, course terrible know goes counts right now. Yup, can’t afford hospital bill hospitals US collapsing it’s still important. everyone knows number Floridians read would suggest Florida subreddits def reflect opinion majority. TN treats cows better people. fix that.

Istanbul Constantinople

Now Istanbul, Constantinople

Been long time gone, Constantinople

Now Turkish delight moonlit night certain that? Almost country reached 70% yet. kids, making sure get enough Vitamin C D.

We also plan gargle salt water spraying nose saline blowing school decrease potential viral load.

We also made sure best kids masks - ASTM Level 3 certified masks only. highly doubt would able KN95 mask day school. That's simply true though. CDC admits myocarditis concern young men side effect vaccination (somewhere 1/5,000 1/14,000). Everyone 30 get Pfizer/Moderna - really need approve AZ J&amp;J high risk group among males. Village idiots got together every village idiot gets megaphone : social media 101 me, I’m thinking means I’m going double mask indoors try stay 6ft away. know 2 masks around 80% effective helps soothe anxiety. study surgical disposal mask cloth mask. 

Although family vacay end month I’m sure. It’s 6 people we’ve going around without masks, hanging people unvaccinated. Especially mom lives part state lot folks vaccinated. first heard wanted spread word.  COVID literally causes pneumonia, still willing remove Covid death certificates. 

He knew wasn’t right interested plausible deniability. Macon County coroner omitted COVID-19 least half-dozen death certificates cases another major factor — **pneumonia elderly patient** “you know, grandma one lung smoked life,” example — could **justified** sole cause behavior seems vaguely familiar... high prevalence area bet find lot ""asymptomatic"" positives simply came contact virus swiftly fended infection. CDC one time recommending surveillance testing fully vaxxed individuals. Delta changed minds group described almost certainly still exists. Hillsborough Board County Commissioners majority last election, county government known be, well, shitshow times, split majority R makeup used be. *should* par Tampa proper now, kept much BOCC 2021 tbh. Regarding incentives: where's $100 getting vaxxed early on? Right. Florida great vaccination uptake, went waves *enforced* lockdowns, *enforced* mask wearing, electronic contract tracing…

However, none really happened Florida, they’re comparable. Florida “open” free-dumb things pretty much whole pandemic. It’s catching bc delta transmissible everybody inside AC.

So said “no restrictions” Florida result putting work UK done, outcome different exactly we’re seeing play out. I’m tired developing countries telling developed countries hold back protecting citizens favor sending vaccines countries. get agree helping countries vaccinate moral thing supply par demand, telling us sacrifice citizens favor others. also heard people complaining US made vaccines available people 20 hoping make available kids 12 winter. Don’t come us wanting protect kids —the future nation—from death long term effects infection don’t even fully understand. vaccines paid taxpayer money taxpayer I’d livid US decided vaccinate kids shots approved FDA kids favor shipping doses developing countries. fits one Reddit’s favorite sayings-you shouldn’t set fire keep people warm. Yeah, think map right Vermont. Vermont vaccinated state country. way many red spots. entire us government idea they’re doing. information factual closely related covid vast majority unvaccinated point stupid, selfish, dangerous. don’t care hurting others. long get “freedom”, world could burn.  Unfortunately no. They’re still trials kids 12. approval rumored coming October November. Oh sorry, forget folks sub love shit US specifically whatever reason lol Womp prayers may chance school requires vaccines? Lots universities US that. make sure wear N95s haven't. maybe able meet people school? 

Best luck remember pass, last forever.   know right, I’m sure offspring drummer agrees yet shit bullshit storm 100% you. baby March 2019 starting enter pleasant social “mom young toddler” phase went down. It’s miserable. Long covid simply latest long line expressed concerns anxious personalities afraid since start pandemic. real concerns (too much stress healthcare system). false (such kids risk long covid real threat). Variants Time. Always. Im pretty sure it’s actual distribution oxygen supply. shit really hits fan they’ll send national guard federal COVID response team. article explains various issues better. answer yes, vaccine stronger natural immunity Delta infection previous variants doesn’t seem translate Delta well. Preliminary reports also suggest Delta Plus binds lungs better transmits even faster even higher viral load. Like article says, antibody evading variants uneven level immunity natural infections general issue. Remember, everybody develops amount antibodies level immunity, especially asymptomatic cases. 

What I’m saying is, that’s hefty chunk naturally infected population either developed immune response (~10%) and/or significantly weaker response variants, means mutation chances. don’t think vaccine evading strain likely, that’s rough ride unvaccinated stuff continues mutate circulate hopefully less lethal form. also includes unknown mix AZ. known lower efficacy Pfizer. makes wonder much evolutionary pressure behavior society puts virus. virus super transmissible yet never elicits symptoms (or super mild ones) would fit wouldn’t try stop spread masks, distancing, even vaccines. perhaps behavioral changes, especially considering comply them, strong enough influence virus’ evolution. Beef dairy cows clearly important bottom line covid mutating faster rate say flu? Even prevalence flu since 1900's, strains couple generations. Yet whole laundry list strains COVID 18 months. that? mean wouldn’t want sanitize Florida technically Oh sure, let elaborate. I’m largely saying it’s control that’ll it’ll get worse gets better, pretty scary. get sense people would much rather see us *do something* stop this. seems like Delta relentless unstoppable force that’ll burn unvaccinated pretty fast. brings end sooner later… pretty way. way absolutely should’ve avoided via vaccines. that, sadly, didn’t happen. Doctors high 90s, nurses around 50% aids even worse.

We ""nurse anti-vax pipeline"" problem US. Seems growing number cases people, often mild cases covid long term loss smell taste. returns report everything tasting smelling rotten meat generally bad.

May level side effects definately life changing lot ways. ^^Floats ^^away So, I'm clear... argument everyone someone they're worried staying home - disregarding industries actually allow that. go out, ***they*** wearing masks - disregarding mask use primarily protect everyone **except** wearer preventing someone infected (whether know not) spreading. 

So people actually need protecting acting protect ***everyone interact with***... need part protect them? without mandate, students wearing one. Even wanted to, would make target bullying, would anyway rather useless gesture majority opting to. tried asking daily discussion thread got removed, think relevant here: endgame? convincing antivaxxers get vaccinated (good luck)? getting under-12's vaccinated? 

What exactly goalpost we're working towards? Damn. sucks. wish around 1984 high time.  IMO, crazy say ""Covid like flu"" brand new. really becoming like flu many people some-to-total immunity, think okay say that. finish testing yet. feeling US large assume track. might true south northern states clearly shown resistance wave - probably seasonality. wonder comes one two punch like summer/winter waves again. includes you, too, buddy. go ahead tell humans generally stupid hell despite smartest thing planet. they're somehow ""filler"" obstacle rest us.

Tell Bubba monster truck ""Tr*mp 2020"" permanently airbrushed rear misunderstood genius reformed sensitivity training.

Cringe want; save human race itself. entire family vaccinated still comfortable flying delta variant spreading. They're across country driving practical, may option we've got minimize risk them. admit, truly conservative position take.

You got vaccines freedom hide inside want. Life full hardships virus one things God throws way. precautions whatsoever, change life 2018. walk around guns deadly virus variant go work party like nothing different. Doesn’t matter people mostly going wrong thing, offloaded responsibility, arguments moot. Don’t live fear!

Irresponsible. Utterly uncaring public safety, sticking conservative principles. really good case study government making rash decisions without thinking long term ramification could be. even embarrassing GOP prides empowering local governments make right decision citizens. ban removes effective tool could used keep vulnerable population harm. 

I hope take lesson restore legislation back deliberate body make laws foresight. course are. believe pandemic. feel bad kids. deserve this. Getting sick, potential long-term infirmities, infecting families friends, etc. Literal children worry things like that. is, uncertainty also dumb people latch to. get message, hear know sure. eternal battle science vs faith. Show large (10000+ participants) study, control group, data based self-reporting, I'll accept long covid might real significant problem. Republicans cause serious side effects including shortness bank account, coughing even donations, illness, mental dysfunction death.

It's never Ehlers Danlos! Except is. That's boomer insult. love it. Yup. Probably large overlap long covid things like chronic fatigue.. Well true 95% pandemic recent developments. asshole golfers? even tried taking approach Florida, point. There's real reason work done exactly done UK. Uninformed people Keep shouting unmask kids thinking virus behaving like still come grips virus changed kids greater risk long term illness. students vaccinated state? mean according stats places like Chongqing Anhui completely covid free (zero cases) since April 2020, that's unbelievable way look it, even regional NZ rural Australia outbreaks they're remote islands.

i mean even look talk locals why?

Thanks! curious see data state. they'll start saying they're discriminated against. got sick died hundreds thousands got vaccines going. Let's judge post history. Racist, mocking liberals.. go on? post history mocks bigots, profile shows one Imagine government decided weren’t allowed eat restaurant overweight.. bet mom would lose mind. think vaccine requirements completely acceptable. ( younger ) cousin weeks back totally loop delta rising numbers. He's focused day day life clueless. time age group came vaccines covid numbers US cratered. couple older family members kind set straight went got it. kind embarassed know.

It's easy us groups like obviously concerned enough covid join sub like miss fact people really live little world sometimes. Another study finds rains ground gets wet....

Tip facing unnecessary work travel give get answer email it’s written documentation. understand YMMV, also don’t luxury say no. Wtf u taked already 3 shots? that's another standard covid denier anti vaxx idiot line

Also, there's, ""I *probably* got last year. tested, I'm sure COVID."" Today looking like won’t pretty. Already 13K US minimal states reporting in. guess 30k, currently 39k Florida died.   average. state 70% vaxxed. reality county 80% western tip, counties 35% lower. OP here. agree wiser wait agencies catch up. made choice personal level understood risk/reward; balance might match others

However, really need get moving. personally think 3rd dose would effective mask mandates, especially considering already vaxxed who'd participating either way author living rock? one overly dramatic people thinks entire world locked underground bunker alone year half?



I mean come past summer, probably fall. Thank you!!! far off.

Ya ya ya ya ya two doses effective one, wouldn’t larger proportion double vaccinated people save lives

Yes, consider availability capacity administer vaccines. 

My comment pertains vaccines (and administering capacity) limited back January-April. Now, protection afforded 1st dose gave great protection severe disease &amp; death (as Wuhan alpha strain), lives saved delaying booster thus freeing another 1st dose give someone else. way around happen.

We're replaceable. I’d lying said it’s never kept night thinking would/will happen next Trump comes along he’s actually smart malicious. could actually mortal blow country, feels almost inevitable. Trump could’ve easily done way damage even TINY bit smarter it. really got easy ego, loose lips, general incompetence.  Covid19 risk syndrome may occur infection want take one two safe vaccines could help prevent getting Covid triggering GBS. not. added back Okanagan region. Masks much stop delta variant though, accomplish anything make people think something useful. keep mind science exact is. likely spectrum likely someone transmit virus. safe say believe far likely prior variants. much exactly going take many studies converge number. thoroughly tested vaccine history human race. Yet people like, want wait see. See what?? realize covid stay ""zero-covid"" thing start looking covid like illness lived with, mentally things get better. 

No one thinks worries flus, even really bad years lots hospitalizations deaths, people go day day.  start feeling sick, stay home, rest get back life days feel better. 

If vaccinated, thats treat covid today. (I guess outside ""get back life days"" test positive, since supposed stay 10 days - imagine guidance change road) thought opinion pieces weren’t allowed? Apparently he’s already covid19 once. Gotta love Parks rec reference.

On lighter note, may one favorite scenes entire show. surprising. guess little surprised Isreal, diligent. guess less I'm pessimistic lately see end sight. one likes masks. enjoyed month didn’t need wear one 6+ hours work. 
Cloth masks effect base covid. Still point n95 equivalent. 
The mRNA vaccines always going two doses. Maaaybe better rollout comms plan might avoid third jab, don’t think could avoided delta emerging. think perfect response would see additional 10-15% world vaxed point. point hope avoid 4th jab anytime soon.

And yes, covid poorly managed. Shockingly around globe, definitely US. American angry too. NYS did. Excelsior Pass. takes less 5 minutes set numbers almost meaningless people vaccinated. Covid us spreading indefinitely. need thing lot countries shifting reporting hospitalizations much emphasis new cases anymore. can’t hurt.  far

Wait two weeks it’ll new headline variant du jour. would make people angry. really care feelings, I'd feel bad teachers, kids, kids, I'd worried someone would something stupid. choice like choices series consequences.  Politicians care vaccines new way divide people. country want vaccinate people countries impose sanctions it. would go. vaccinated. Honestly bigger concern new variant comes India China makes gains useless. vaccinated try enjoy life right now. really important points. vaccines crap, simply need antibodies times want avoid infection together. Especially Delta hits harder upfront. mom wears mask fucking chin. also diagnosed COPD still smokes pack half day. point I'm hoping alive wake every day. going suck gone worry anymore. band mates, one PhD Molecular Biology wrote dissertation mRNA sequencing HIV.

Kind relevant fact.  state one Hahaha yeah cos ""punks"" white supremacy conservatism like every anti vaxxer. Fucking moron “Study: Selfish people consistently selfish” Stop.

IF covid prevalent (aka delta), getting second shot important. not, could argue waiting. people ended 6-10 weeks. Seriously, people understand every single vaccine full FDA approval less testing done prior full approval? vaccine 100+ million people take shot prior full approval like covid-19 vaccines had. adding stickers badges proof   Yea, I'm gonna need ""evidence"". Especially CDC contradicts 

They say -

*Data multiple studies different countries suggest people vaccinated Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine develop COVID-19 lower viral load unvaccinated people.(41-44)*

then say regards Massachusetts study -

*It also found significant difference viral load present breakthrough infections occurring fully vaccinated people cases, suggesting viral load vaccinated unvaccinated persons infected coronavirus similar.*  Y'all. I'm worried delta China. New NYT reporting delta least half provinces. could go sideways real bad them.

Also need vent people getting vaxxed USA. I'm angry. be. be. medical condition says could lot worse brought vaccine. Apparently condition affects immune system see stuck rock hard place, came consulting doc two free passes Bonnaroo husband, I'm torn. one hand, we're fully vaccinated feel we've done everything asked to, deserve right go. accept vague risk could get mild infection we're there. We'd wear masks avoid pit/high traffic times areas reduce risk catching we'd also quarantine avoid part web contagion. hand, I'm reading many comments anger towards festival goers, vaccinated otherwise, mass gatherings pandemic still happening. Honestly, depending time day mood moment, flip flop side I'm on. It'd also feel like massive disappointment catch covid long managing avoid it.

Having paid nothing passes, something guess need decide right now. Nothing lost go. also live close enough could drive see feel, come home feels much. knowing me, I'm I'm in. decision needs made go. 

I dunno man, I'm rubber ducking thoughts here. 2021 got feeling confused. Nothing joked ""catching all"" like pokemon took seriously Oh definitely sarcastic study try understand one’s thought process. I’m fully vaxxed never comprehend anti vaccine mind set beyond people legitimate medical issues prevent one inoculated. I’m honestly point zero empathy folks make choice willful pure ignorance. Máscar-ass high correlation people uninterested respecting around them, don’t wear masks. really matter point. understand vast majority people whatever excuse, continue excuses vaccine no-go. far beneficial point ram through, allowing institutions mandate vaccines authorization waiting on. syndrome may occur infection the COVID-19 virus. also rare reaction receive Johnson &amp; get one two vaccines, since getting Covid19 could trigger GBS. Yeah I’m vaccinated also GBS triggered vaccine 18. can’t believe people criticizing drummer. excuse FDA approval takes years therfore one rushed. Also use fact Pfizer continuing monitor phase 3 trial participants evidence still ""experimental"" seems reasonable medics explanation isn’t simply saying Lol one another trigger. People would surprised get upset…like ok sir/ma’am telling idea stopped paying gym bill 6 months ago…or cases people would like “I idea” different worker already left note file “they warned notified past due can’t come it’s paid etc”. No, that's enough similar flu vaccine. also reduces probability getting severe illness transmitting others. usual, eloquent analysis someone barely knows China.  ""highly theoretical exercise"" (\**makes fart noises*\*) sort stimulation immune system trigger flare GBS. scary thing. GBS actually like playing lotto. I’ve flare cold before. think that’s point important part. Many people using waiting “full approval” excuse. Scleroderma, taking immunosuppressants. (Not reason I’m aware of)

edit: lol got downvoted mentioning reason immunocompromised people can't get vaccinated.  vaccine choice nonsense? made choice get vaccinated due doctor's advice fired job. course he's happy that.

Edit: even ridiculous, already Covid likely protected someone vaccine. Mine came early also came early even heavier covid November. covid period one worst I've ever several conditions make periods awful. bled month covid.

So likely likely happen catch covid too. happened person live too. 

An OBGYN set straight issue. friend L/D nurse PCOS. accidentally got pregnant 3rd child getting vaccine even trying.  Feel free correct I'm wrong believe vaccine efficacy around 65%? know 2-3 floating around but, that's around average I've read past months. going vaccinate entire population.  


We around 90-95% efficacy J&amp;J, Moderna, Phizer. 


Last year told could take vaccine 65 efficacy rate would done along quite people sub. think that's minimum hoping get vaccinations. lucked out. 


At end day entire population vaccine vs Western populations current vaccine rates might end much different. 


Also, wearing masks going parade restrictions lifting reinstated sans past week wife stopped wearing mask months ago restrictions place whichever city affected. Aside handful people whole population embraced correct way things. Politics cultural differences western eastern cultures. interesting see different areas handled it. 


Zero cases impossible, China figured make impact cases low unless impacted area.   THIS\^ someone had/has long term damage viral infections. hate people pretend COVID respiratory illness cause long term effects, isn't, ALWAYS case!  That's lot words ""I understand question."" Go read maybe? Kids can't protected want to, hospitals can't really handle outbreak among unvaccinated people. lot hospitals can't currently support overnight procedures (e.g. cancer stuff) due COVID need beds COVID patients.

A minority's stupidity affect them, affects everyone. shit, given. studies/surveys getting dumber dumber. [Here mask entire society time protect asymptomatic mild sickness. Exactly. harshest lockdown world

hahahahahaha, no. catching tend hardcore Republicans % fall ill die would impact split republican democrat votes next election? I’m American interested state dynamics. something officially something decided do?

Not judging way, kinda considered tbh. wondering. yep.

A new study shows delta COVID-19 variant produced similar amounts virus vaccinated unvaccinated people get infected — illustrating key motivation behind federal guidance recommends fully vaccinated Americans wear masks indoors. 
 
Experts say vaccination makes less likely catch COVID-19 first place — do, data suggests could similar tendency spread unvaccinated folks. 
 
""High viral loads suggest increased risk transmission raised concern that, unlike variants, vaccinated people infected delta transmit virus,"" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention, said statement Itll go full black death it'll never, it'll trim lower branches IQ tree. Sharing data point successfully getting 3rd pfizer

I've also gotten new ID new home address since original two. gave (work) phone number instead main/cell. sure two things mattered Companies continue follow clinical trial patients drug approval time. deliberate talking point meant undermine one common abortion arguments. popping place. Thank God ""KIDS CAN'T SPREAD COVID"" anyone Florida, actually difficult get COVID test without mass testing sites? testing convenient (e.g.) pharmacies people aren’t getting tested much, opening mass testing sites really help?

Where I’m at, mass testing sites also closed, it’s easy get same-day test hospital, doctors office, pharmacy, locations. sure it’s FL. hell closed? even want know? word national app hold HIPAA pass validation token? I'll invest company Oh. 

So didn’t read article making claims about.  

Ok. headline?

No, totally preventable. fact, percentage would higher people vaccinated.

But case numbers article? Eh, tough say easily Delta spreads. Could matter timeline, ya know? Lambda delta could combine though spread covid misinformation conspiracy theory, one biggest problems public health right now. 

Again, risk vaccine virus. misinformation. can't make clearer.  please... people wanted. even safe thing city FDA guidance booster strategy? live Park county mask wearing, least stores, creeping back spring last weeks. It’s surprising, many ways, county low vaccination numbers. It’s either people truly don’t want get sick crowd does. Yup.

Whether legitimate concern demographic.  harsh truth guarantee ever will. we're lucky enough virus limited amount possible immune escape mutations, might get point new variants evade vaccine. that's if, when.

It's also possible scientists could make new vaccine that's able repel coronaviruses. again, that's if, when. 

The possibility social distancing lockdowns become normality many generations is, sadly, impossible deny. Then, guess, would end like pandemics: many people would died spread would slow down, well mutation rate. make smart. I've worked Ivy leaguers smart come expect. Time proclaim incompetent failed job governor. Calling smart he's abusing power making terrible policy decisions justice. Time call really is, people FL need see is, failed leader. Tried anti-vax parents. budge. read 6 places internet vaccine dangerous. Nevermind tens thousands sources say safe. sources lying course. Also, Tucker Carlson appointment TV them, surprising. tell can't around unvaccinated (because age) grandchildren, they, kids vaccinated day, fun. not? Explain me. know really grinds gears. weeks vaccinated people got infected Delta Variant, exhibited symptoms headache, sore throat, \*lots sneezing runny noses.

But here's CDC week saying 'Break-Through' infections, occur 1% vaccinated folks infect others. Well symptomology 'Break-through' infections list symptoms COVID-19. first group mentioned respitory issues almost none fever. similar seasonal allergies. surely group mentioned pass virus others.

So CDC, 1% vaccinated folks pass virus others, crapload people. need mask mandates need educate public pay attention feeling get tested exhibit mild symptoms. We're ""bracing"" we're shaking collective heads getting ready it. We've known since day 1 second FDA fully approved would mandated Except one time got (edit: unofficial) 3rd pfizer dose yesterday. Similar effects second dose, minimal (sore arm, little tired)

Question others — managing two CDC cards now? transferred booster info original? Could ask pharmacist write over? No, feelings weren’t hurt. would been?

You apparently can’t even keep track you’re replying to.  know virus dangerous mutates rapidly impossible consciously control many people asymptomatic cases. 

It controlled herd immunity across world. close herd immunity Amercia, let alone globally. 

When achieve herd immunity? respond pandemic, instead political issue culture war. trump come urged everyone get vaccine, would likely already herd immunity America. today, could herd immunity 2 months. won't. make weak enough live it. video channel, Pope said wants promote health way generation’s grandparents experienced got sick, didn’t need crutch pharmaceuticals antibiotics get better,” said video. “They got sick got well.”

Just...what? intentionally dense? grandfather barely survived polio I'm grateful vaccine it. Wizard's First Rule fits perfectly many last year/these last couple years (maybe forever?). 

&amp;#x200B;

:( saw someone face shield mask break! ever anything anyway, wear even need pretend care anymore? Ester ester crime. Tried still smokes. even persistent long term symptoms. drops around 4% less 2% move 8 weeks. lingering symptoms seems much less worrisome. Bad colds take resolve. Sometimes get sinus/chest/ear infections extend entire cold ""break up"" seems take forever. This. many anti-vaxxers conspiracy theorists America? highly religious society teaches ok, even admirable, believe fairy tales truth makes sad.

And so, naturally, many extend method thinking outside church too. Sure, individual selfishness plays factor. don’t discount pressure capitalistic system return normal, even normal necessitates mass sickness death. Incentivize vaccinations, booster shots, upgrade ventilation systems public places, avoid dense indoor gatherings, continue normalize indoor mask wearing, etc, hopeless. Pfizer too, right? It’d single dose vaccine. logistics blow darting random person exactly 3 4 weeks apart seems complicated. point state governments local governments using logic using. projecting onto situation dominant reason mask mandates masking, decisions things made, rationales match own.

""such reasons"" refers simply reasons offered original post.

Where say anything many dead kids ok? point may tangentially relate this, though, I'd say zero mask mandate decisions made based idea must zero dead kids adults. would require total shutdown rather mask mandates. decisions-- decisions made governing bodies fellow Americans-- assuming dead kids ok.  seem like smart person trying use logic possessing zero medical expertise.

The drummer got GBS childhood vaccine. STILL progressed worse symptoms. personal doctor (a neurologist) advises getting vaccine time, standard advice vaccine-related GBS. vaccine ABSOLUTELY harmful virus **which already got** mild symptoms (and obtaining natural immunity boot).

By way link covid GBS basically zero, read something last fall speculations disproven recent major studies. 

It's honestly impressive entire take away reasoned explanation entire thing ruse slip misinformation stoke anti-vaxx sentiment. Almost amazing thinking band member's biology degree somehow relevant situation medical doctor's professional opinion. virus keep giving UNC one elite schools country. already place? truly understand hard people understand. guess people really can't deal fact say *might* happen, sure *will* happen. People well uncertainty. personally think difficult understand. Covid likely die like Polio. high mutation rate wiped out, also infect tons animal species, meaning always retreat animal populations come back.

What achieve end pandemic endemic situation, waves disease still happen (similar flu), vaccination, population whole immunologically naive therefore rarely get severe symptoms. immunity, also can't infect many people once. factors lead lower death rates prevent hospitals overflown. virus disappear, we're creating situation live lot better could year ago No, mandates effect forcing local businesses area turn away potential customers, majority POC. We're talking 50-60% Bronx residents able sit slice pizza. Great work everyone. clear indication Biden administration decision roll back mask mandates vaccinated people ""to incentivize getting vaccine"" simply stupid. Stunningly stupid. 

I'll put administrations refusal support, develop, roll Federal vaccine passport similarly stupid. We're going 60 different incompatible systems different time frames lower security. road Hell paved good intentions administration dropping ball kicking away. mean like kamala Harris said vaccines rushed trump office? article horribly written. 
I assume school around 1300 students. 
The 4.4% people symptoms test positive. 0.1% people test positive. 1-2 students sick month school. foolish risking health. would rather roll dice virus know long term effects take vaccine. It’s smart decision anyone.

Why would want natural immunity means infected first? 

Also, know since January 2020 asymptomatic people spread infection waiting symptoms isn’t saving anyone contagion. False. Look Tiberius database.  India one first countries lock 2020... criticized strongly perhaps premature. next time government lock down...

Also spread 2021 happened Mumbai elections religious festivals. stuff news trying find reason pin govt one actually knows caused spread ended... cowpox ftw! Wah? Hospitals Doctors close unvaccinated people point. See fast get jab then. End story. Virus over. done? They'd probably drop out. clinical trials test symptomatic infection? People forget vaccine force field magically repels virus entering body. enter body there's chance PCR detect genetic material it. However body trained enough eliminate maybe develop symptoms worse develop cold-like flu-like symptoms. help anyone? really stupid? Ship sailed long ago dude. Plot totally lost. easy declare bankruptcy anymore - laws changed past decade that. makes lot sense honestly. want keep mind much know vs. last year, much hope things improving. understand urge panic also want people stop mega downers. let headlines scare you. Get hesitant family friends vaccinated.

A dear friend mine going first dose Pfizer evening. Cool! join people don’t believe COVID right there. Christ. don’t understand works all.

The vaccine deny sits storage gets thrown out. doesn’t get shipped Botswana said “no thanks” thing happened Flint. even need water expert. firmly believe could've called *any* scientist would gotten much better option ended doing. I'm thankful them, since meant could get first dose much sooner expected. Looks like dude also spout good amount antivax BS reply. ain’t GBS.  doubt, that's makes words &amp; actions particularly dangerous don’t even care may leave kids without parent. That’s point stupid idiot, even magical vaccine person still scared shitless. “Mostly normal”😂😂😂 ...it require studies use common sense.

Science exists can't trust ""common sense"". Right I’m talking people places you’re forced wear one. mandates near basically store requires yet still see mask nose. indeed go walgreens doses. I'll go ask. emails shot dates. shit.

And here's thing, known (and everyone told) requirement likely BEGINNING due nature coronaviruses medical realities.

However, make slippery slope argument dispute documented facts. Bulgaria even worse. like political divide there's almost ""middle ground"", ""swayable"" moderates.

Regarding masks, disagree. seeing people swayed trends. really want wear mask, strong opinion follow crowd. first 10-20% started taking off, majority quickly took too.

Its also areas persistently high mask usage even mandates removed. Without first 10-20% willing ignore trends take masks off, majority kept on. still subreddits encouraging behavior. auto moderators censor posts talk Tr#mp Republ#cans supposedly derailing discussion (even though I'd argue can't meaningfully talk pandemic without understanding context public policy) Uneducated* today's political environment.

From CDC site Smallpox

""In past, 14 52 people every 1 million people vaccinated first time experienced potentially life-threatening reactions. reactions require immediate medical attention...""

""Based past experience, estimated 1 2 people every 1 million people vaccinated could die result life-threatening reactions vaccine."" way, easy photoshop cards buy fakes. Lucky. required go back office full time couple weeks ago. new pandemic comes, questions precisely before.

There’s school district 730 students/staff currently quarantined + 43 active cases 2 weeks school year. Arkansas House currently debating bill would allow masking district jumped bunch hoops.

Tell families victims. ""Numbers"" going great, numbers still people.

I think people cowering corner house, attention paid actions taken. Vaccinate, wear mask, conscious surroundings. fear end game depends get people do.

We might able get enough people vaccinated soon enough dies given country, there's manageable amount spread introduction countries eventually vaccinate globe. probably best end game. point, even new variants spread less rapidly, even protection 100%.

It might take years get everyone vaccinated much resistance. people probably also resistant masks, distancing, everything else may help slow spread. Eventually, reach equilibrium much protection going get, Covid still spreads around lot, people die needlessly, hopefully filling hospitals time. really end game, think look long enough timeframe (say, ten twenty years) vaccine normalized enough people getting MMR shots everything else. name TheGoodCod hero need hero deserve. Cheers  long international flights flown all, chance containing new variants virus.

It's initial spread, delta etc reached world quickly. think still samples stored CDC’s lab Atlanta Russia’s equivalent. 1998 mean absolutely nothing anybody? I'm wondering thing. county still released information safety plans year. feels like they're waiting state BOE make first move and/or wait absolute last minute avoid public backlash.

""We plan follow applicable CDC AAP guidelines"" default position really frustrating. Don’t forget anthrax smallpox! contrast, Europe near everyone wears mask 

Where getting this? Anecdotally, European friends paint different picture. Holland wasn’t even masking last summer, people cognizant personal space apart. Another friend went France said covid people done restrictions. pandemic COVID disappearing one ever getting sick prerequisite end pandemic. lot people want hear that, true. Sometimes yes, quacks given reason, GBS, sounds really wrong. order things trigger GBS, it’s viruses virus-based vaccines stuff life. going live life quarantine avoid random viruses? take mRNA vaccine data shows doesn’t trigger GBS? tour expose new variants contagious disease.

Sorry, GBS personal doctor free pass. Conservatives dying claim personal doctor sacred, really depends wtf they’re saying. HQ Chester County, 89% vax rate. doubt much pushback all.  covid vaccine. 

Just like I’d rather get vaccine risk virus, I’d rather take melatonin risk insomnia-based lifestyle  see haven’t missed anything. prefer get Covid information actual virologists, immunologists, infectious disease physicians. Reddit threads always gold. I'm also VA, county 43% vaccinated, less 30% 12-17. Masks optional. I'm utterly pissed Northams decision mask mandate Schools. Leaving public health decisions local elected officials really bad idea. Florida chose path. Florida choose another. feel sympathy. Let surge.

Edit: seems like people would like blame current governor problems facing Florida. That's 100% correct. shares blame, people Florida failed take advantage vaccines available also blame. Data convincingly shown vaccines effective preventing hospitalizations death. Florida population decided want vaccinations. I'll say again:

Florida chose path. Florida choose another. feel sympathy. Let surge.  people say COVID going endemic, kind thing they're talking about. testament power vaccines Florida actually high vaccination rates, bit asymptomatic/mild spread community would issue. lot lie it. law, US Department Defense wait FDA approval mandating vaccine soldiers, marines, navy, airforce etc.

My kids' school district summer school person year. wife tentatively allowed promised they'd top things, make sure kids wore masks. 

They not. Kids wearing masks day two three. youngest's class couple kids catch COVID, sent whole class home, notably restrict families sending siblings school either. madness. Literally expel.

We really need teaching HIPAA high school. number people understand important set laws truly horrifying. I’m wrong. test 3 sick people it’s 100% positivity. test 3 healthy people it’s 0%. positivity rate flawed concept statistical standpoint since essentially control group. It’s cherry picked sample. biological parent connection one without children wouldn’t understand , person critical thinking common sense appreciate research understand comes from. think asked questions parents wish expose children virus also involved find ways engage children socially development without throwing setting others parents don’t care busy bother. I’m saying bad parents ways without sacrificing development, social experience health. also like think makes better people future ask 4 million people died. probably nothing.

Hell, might forces good clear absolute dumbest. Crickets... /s

The mRNA vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) [not contraindicated One person developed GBS J&amp;J trial, also someone J&amp;J trial control group receive vaccine. see person walking alone wearing mask, know person fully vaccinated. don’t think vaccine dangerous kids Covid.

It’s approved they’re figuring efficacy kids right size dosage give best immune response. gets figured out, approval probably isn’t far away. Children still humans it’s like vaccine effect whole lot different adults.

The heart inflammation rare side effect. Maybe problem living around shitheads. feel really bad kids parents right now. think way keep super safe environment. impress upon important wear mask cross fingers get covid, it'll easy illness. middle tourist season, FL excluding non-residents (eg tourists) numbers. FL undercount well. Except viruses much likely cause GBS, addition getting vaccine ever, neurologist would also recommend lifelong quarantine.

Yeah everything risks, mRNA vaccines appear especially safe since contains virus people GBS prone, absolute modifier like reckless *wrong* part doctor. doctor advised vaccine, nobody elses business.

China least 61% vaccine coverage according Bloomberg. Although Chinese vaccines efficacy mRNA ones, vaccine look like reduce transmission quite bit, specially person asymptomatic.

Look Nanjing, initial outbreak, 3 cases today.  couple cities Anhui one asymptomatic person each. mass testing, find people infected. pretty clear asymptomatic vaccinated person, even Chinese vaccine, transmit much. too! I’m wondering check stuff. live shitty conservative town I’ve heard lots talk faking vaccine cards.

Overall changes human behavior could it, though, India imposed strict lockdown. Noodles look like Austin Powers? you’re reading it’s already late.   logic sound likely ""give inch take mile"". probably believe masks mandated forever believe letting government mandate something lead restrictions future even unnecessary (slippery slope fallacy).  Yea tested year ago. Farts spread covid underwear works fart mask Lucky. I’m jealous. ;) concern seems widespread adoption boosters mean less supply developing world, remains serious problem. Ensuring everyone 2 shots remains far important reduce spread prevent hospitals overwhelmed. Reducing spread also prevents formation new variants. booster shot remains luxury, might turn unnecessary. hmm-hm-hmm gay cake I'm finding COVID lead GBS. provide source?

DeSantis continues let Delta spread, Biden anything? acknowledged situation people Florida (there care including me) in? Depends state Florida unique low vaccinations even know making joke think are, I'll upvote half Offspring lyrics vocalizing like this. Still one favorite bands ever!  think vaccinate people getting Covid from? Definitely. logic fails they're party ""freedom small government"" yet they're constantly pushing things like ban abortion restrict gay marriage limits freedom. ""limited power control"" except enforcing beliefs. Mr. ass. venue employees. sound equipment guys Republicans large don’t care personally affects them. even there’s change they’ll deny blame someone else. 

They actively cheer this. Literally. Remember rally cheered country’s low vaccination rate?  Nice.

I hope people's governments take heed go ensure many people world possible vaccinated (even 1 dose) soon possible. vaccines (including booster shots) may end rendered useless unless swift action taken global effort taken prevent new variants popping continuously.

Very sad think countries talking vaccinating 20 ASAP example majority countries especially vulnerable places little access access kind vaccine. simply following Trump playbook. feel bad sick, dead, orphaned kids. sucks matter side you’re on. California east bay they’re calling jab mostly aren’t vaccinated/not planning get it. NCSU requiring masks regardless vax status classes, addition submitting COVID vax card getting tested every week. Theoretically, could try stop planes trains busses. Couple issues though. 

1) business agree stop routes lose money already have. transportation companies cannot afford keep losing money way fold thousands people work. 

2) Even able stop that, people still able drive FL. right American citizens move freely around country. government cannot tell can’t travel place inside borders. 

It #2 #1 probably happen  Imagine getting PhD shits giggles one successful bands 90s. usual, wrong team oversimplifying. realize protecting EVERYONE making choices right?  Aren’t talking country whole? Florida unique. Ikr. feel like point even vaccine unsafe (which highly doubt) would quite unlikely admit it.

Meanwhile states like Florida currently leading country cases passing laws ban things. What’s really crazy colleges mandating vaccines staff…but public elementary middle schools. Full disclosure, I’m fully vaccinated teacher. However, know many colleagues get vaccine. soon they’ll classrooms unvaccinated children.

Problem not, anything UK still worse European countries. 'dip' amazing may seem some. vaccination halves transmission Delta variant coronavirus

Does mean tell assholes keep saying reduce transmission they're full crap? debatable given links evidence safe widely recognized authorities subject thread. Sounds like anti vax guy chose yes man doctor true cheaper PCR testing generally advice mandate someone tests positive antigen also get PCR test. makes math quite bit harder.

I think looking right direction total cost (all parties combined) would cheaper. point though costs mostly people get sick US, free tests would get paid government. country social healthcare burden people giving free tests lower hospitalizations (which far expensive) whole different story. That’s funny way say unvaccinated people aren’t taking pandemic seriously. COVID never existed Florida, would Delta surprise them? Fair enough, hope things continue right direction! Let pay consequences lul experience. look top comment positive news item, it’s always counter point negative slant. know health insurance works US. fall ill something insurance company figures off-label use medicine, deny claim based that? I’m inpatient healthcare facility amongst vulnerable people. think booster healthcare workers vaccinated 6+ months ago priority. That's literally fact Actually, flawed data*, issue wasn’t people questioned data- issue Israel never released studies experts couldn’t review data. Data zero context pretty much useless. 

On top that- always suspected Israel’s data merit (even flawed), assumed early on, even started correlating waning immunity duration someone vaccinated- antibodies waning vaxxed first. read AMA seasoned virologist back May said would case.

*  Wasn’t intentionally dismissive, chiming others experiences. absolutely crazy case spike last month deaths still pretty much flat 2-8 day cases fallen well Yeah, fucking shit, Mycroft. regularly wear masks Covid? thought it?  wish Indiana would this, won't. hope local county right thing, kids going awful year full illness many schools closing due teacher shortages. extremely heavy prolonged bleeding vaccine. couple trans men know recurring periods since mine heavier. It’s obviously way better death, you’re talking heavy blood loss severe dysphoria, it’s worth dismissive over, know? Especially clearing confusion gets people vaxed. society good society important. That’s many early 1900 Supreme Court rulings vaccine mandates.

If society formal framework, comment holds water.

However public health emergency, still in, there’s different set circumstances citizens/members collective society. almost half year ago general - know extreme minority people can't get know every condition. going retake vaccine eventually anyway. good, I'm lucky good support system still able work. One day time! lol meant man. cant comprehend country fully open economy restrictions ahead (in sense well passed peak latest wave). Also wide open transmissible variant. mean....FL shut beaches last year. No, 4.4% positive cases. Mosat people know, including me, 2 months shots. Fwiw, school mandating students masked fall. would send child school without mask; I’m even hesitant enough mask mandate. So: even self-service tortured logic, still 100k. Thanks!

(It ain't arbitrary, boss. kids, clearly.) seems unlikely. see happening that: 

1. people infected COVID young, immune reactions fairly mild.  
2. childhood infections, people build certain amount natural immunity. 
3. People given recurrent vaccinations adulthood, especially risk death. 
4. Even people get recurrent vaccinations level natural immunity childhood infections. 
4. COVID evolves become less lethal less lethality results less severe lockdowns allows greater spread strains. dishonest children (588 younger 1146 older children) positive SARS-CoV-2 test result

Valid test positive test. think we're injecting soldiers today vaccines predictions world 30 years? Yup. time bring masks back. imagine morons thought way wearing shoes shirts public upon time. need accept masks going part everyday attire. personally wear one home along wife children back work, kids school. percentage covers hospitalizations serious illness. headline statistic refers getting infected all.  Honestly, fact developed 90+% effective vaccine almost virtually prevents deaths still amazing me.

Even northeast outbreak resulted 5 hospitalizations vaccinated, aka Bruins hockey night. never going global lockdown - would *only* way - even then, takes one place enforce one allow Covid spread. 

We accept Covid endemic, act accordingly.

Assuming everyone group vaccinated they're public, think people would willing take risk mean, increase 270% sounds horrific right?

Yet know 3,200 18 hospitalizations happened last 18 months? There's 75 million 18.

At time, western media pretty arrogant towards developing countries too.

Lets call draw, that? Well least drummer die. Yet. already happened. pandemic made realize FDA CDC designed emergency times like this. They're reactive organizations, proactive. way since beginning testing difficult come FDA slow act approving testing measures create, along CDC. 8 9 months since EUA. 70% adults gotten least one jab.

Anti-vaxxers say rigged studies show doesn’t reduce RNA levels vaccinated unvaccinated people. Nobody knows means vaccinated people likely transmit. It’s certainly possible, also possible level RNA vaccinated person translates less infectious virus. Remember RNA infectious virus (the actual meaning viral load) necessarily correlated. seen studies looking breakthrough infections note level RNA vaccinated people peak antigen tests (which detect actual virus shell protein) less likely positive, kinda suggesting could remnants virus people. Either way work needs done. CDC doesn’t time wait find what’s actually going change mask mandates, scientists absolutely will.

HIV, organ transplant, heart failure, children can’t vaccinated yet …

I relieved got vaccinated it’s disappointing - run sympathy don’t vaccinate wear masks. loves hate he's getting media. movement fueled owning l b perfect aspirations.  India also lot smaller densely populated US. new cases Mass fully vaccinated

What study July 2021, following multiple large public events Barnstable County, Massachusetts, town, 469 COVID-19 cases identified among Massachusetts residents traveled town July 3–17; 346 (74%) occurred fully vaccinated persons.

The sample cover ""new cases Massachusetts"" implied, small, local sample single town several large public events.

Thanks gilding, someone! study posted weeks (days?) ago third shot regular vaccine provides protection original variant .i.e 3 shots Pfizer Delta = 2 shots original. literally throwing doses garbage. Let people intelligent enough get booster get one. AKA ""Common clay new west"" Well, took almost 200 years eradicate smallpox first vaccine created. seems like going never ending chain events. another variant that. another. another. 

That’s viruses do. evolve. Covid never going go away. Luckily tools make much manageable disease. wish knew endgame shouldn’t afraid anymore. really except protect ourselves? CDC study used PCR detects viral RNA necessarily correlated viral load. may looking actual infections virus. wait, do? DeSantis good playing politician. knows exactly rile base. He’s still POS, he’s smart, conniving POS. reaction cases plummeting CDC loosened mask recommendations, ""All unvaccinated people first stop wearing masks"" lol stupid Japanese way, sure, govern never gave shit actually minimizing spreading lol responding someone talking separate comment made heavily down-voted. Nobody getting upset down-votes - discussing negative reaction comment reasons it. comment added nothing noise here. ""dick-nosing"" people look fucking stupid. good visual indicator intelligence Well then, guess stopped getting boosters lol. Yeah know risk serious issues low. I'd still rather get sick. Every day stay there, making choice stay. something took long time learn.

Unfortunately getting vaccine might enough, vaccine doesn’t grant us 100% protection. Iirc lambda variant interest variant concern COVID also cause GBS

You follow logic already covid thus obtaining natural immunity good chance never ever catching covid again, gets vaccine sure shit 100% getting vaccine? ALREADY got GBS vaccine child that's stayed entire life. doctor recommended getting vaccinated that's personal medical decision informed consent everyone's harping perfectly fine.

btw link covid GBS tenuous, fact basically zero according recent large studies. projecting fantasy personal heroism onto situation.

Basic hygiene make *hero*. Jesus Christ.

I think might telling yourself, here. Ok, level got harder we're even near year's end nothing said, ""we"" (i.e. Americans polities, whether state local) instituting mask mandates explicitly order protect children can't vaccinated. could wrong! point delta variant seems like fearmongering rather refutation said. seem think post something personal habits. can't help find condescending ""pray kids"" remark insulting, frankly. One year olds need around bunch people develop socially. Plenty kids around age had/have stay home parent play many children/people.  


Honestly, easy say ""it's 1-2% kids!"" kids never seen child hospital before.  data come from? worldometer showing TN Missouri still rising 7 day average THANK GOD! UNC student believe one ways make sure everyone stays safe. make sure low-income students placed bind thanks hapless university administration. sickens know ares students faking vaccination, tested weekly weekly testing literally takes 10 minutes day they're central locations close classes. seriously hope goes disabled student, need herd immunity make sure students like going stay safe. UGH sucks. actual real world studies (not lab) wearing cloth mask day?

CDC advised wearing masks preventative flu measure.

I think waves pandemic we’ve learned impact marginal. Unless believe peaks valleys coincide society embracing masks, believing them, believing again, not. I'm glad neck woods almost 80% fully vaccinated 90% people still wear masks stores. auto mod doesn’t mess around comes anti vaxxers guess"
