0,2020-06-28," want hear president say this. Instead divisive bullshit every time speaks. Weird science tends liberal bias lot time. Nope don‚Äôt really evidence that. We‚Äôve phase 2 1 week known lag death rate. basically current stats we‚Äôre seeing consequence state things weeks ago (aka lockdown). Wait... so... happens military doctors asks boatloads mask money? happen ask enough issue whole populace? entire study political nonsense. 

There way things like protests Pride celebration didn‚Äôt cause spike all. read countries? Brexit? Hell foreign psyops thing forever.  politicians know everything??? America. I‚Äôm shocked President handled pandemic. there‚Äôs Brazil. Good call. Providing testing sufficient, community spread Australia incredibly low opening internal borders no-brainer really hope serious reckoning regarding political leadership this. It‚Äôs saying all, it‚Äôs something keep mind. factual occurrence uses emotional propaganda support dems &amp; rep. purpose sway discord erratically. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm hurt people find decision ignorant dangerous.‚Äù Then....don‚Äôt make decisions ignorant dangerous. extremely, extremely unlikely we'll never vaccine. fact people seem immune getting means body fight reliably knows look for, matter finding safest effective way induce immunity. virus also mutating, multiple strains, primary reasons flu vaccine effective long-term. actually read book Genesis? Ok percent. everyone saying I'm getting impression essentially death sentence body functions moment get it, 90%. Majority minority? Hahha cucks let millions snackbars walk shoot amount rapes assaults 300% Arkansas castle doctrine. familiar ""Stay fuck away me"" - state emphatically endorses right keep others out.

If force Mary Mallon onto island rest life, impose restrictions movment prevent spread deadly disease. learn history, civics, laws, governor. skills good chef

sir Chili's sorry. maybe estimation deaths issue. number deaths report death covid covid. open since May, except discos, movie theaters turistical sites. nobody cares much tourism: fact it‚Äôs kinda sinking. Government hopes internal tourism. would borderline miraculous developed nearly unparalleled pace. Also, would safety efficacy vaccine? like whoever replied deleted comment got removed. Fun times. 

Good spreading good word tho. feel bad her. experience invaluable patients  Thats overstating it. vast majority elderly immunosuppressed people vaccinated. expect immunosuppressed list people vaccinated early. Upwork couple weeks ago. started again, maybe store start tomorrow? wasn‚Äôt way today though. I'm really sorry hear that. I'm boat. (well, living Singapore, current travel bans place, ways, partner Australia), see we're lucky 3 times year, everything booked due fly March, week said flight Australian border closed. last seen October. say heartbreaking understatement. Back April, trying stay optimistic perhaps things would get better maybe July, that's going happen, I'm hoping maybe couple months line. Word Australian border reopen till 2021.

I know seems #firstworldproblems crying getting see bf gf, like me, think lot couples affected one way another, problems legitimate. Yes, get it, course, grateful health, understandable ""why"" restrictions place. course, totally get respect that. looks it, it'll 1.5 year last visit next. that's pretty heartbreaking hard. situations despite know literal pandemic happening. we, couples that, like families separated borders restrictions, problems worries real.

I hope u stay strong. That's got now. They‚Äôll probably get pay cut tbh. Hospitals losing millions. company announced raises. overtime dont think realize dangerous is. majority Americans federal student aid, force deferral used up, meaning required 6 months start paying student loans. wont get 6 month deferral back, meaning go back, stop paying upon graduation, they'll pay back immediately. everyone privileged enough choice. They're not. They're getting YouTube Facebook. Ever meet someone grossly overpaid job clearly qualified perform. mental gymnastics make sure they're person blame. Please tell serious... Yeah, like going crowded political rally.

How irresponsible.  Australia sound? üòú American .. good them. dumb ass gov't can't seem remove heads asses make folks responsible right thing. Yeah, rest country get's infected people coming Victoria support jobs. Yeah, hence /s  #Cuomo2024 u/undeleteparent  even mean? test old people first anyway. going allowed get first launches since high risk. small chance next 2-3 presidents stick use Trump's legacy excuse fix lot fucking silly shit American politics thus ironically maybe end good intention part course.

Stuff like maybe making sure people meant oversee president's actions cannot simultaneously people politically dependent remaining power.

Or things like using 125k+ dead rallying cry proper universal healthcare solution.

Reforming police, shifting spending military social programs, increase education spending, get rid gerrymandering, impose limits supreme court justice durations etc.

A whole host things *might* get fixed next several administrations serious so. 10 seconds small business owners international business start screaming. themselves.  going lose bigly last time too. people get complacent there's every chance he'll win again. One-time panic attack went walk-in clinic thought stroke. gave surgical mask. Wow, panic attack got lot worse. 2010.

My guess novelty masks causing panic anxiety new wearers. Two youts  much want believe that, strong possibility he'll cheat get reelected. He's dumbest piece shit POTUS we've ever every racist America loves him. Racists vote Honestly, despite MA, reminds I've lucky area. hospital never hit 100 hospitalizations, even worst, urban area. got saved direct public transportation Boston, imo I‚ÄôM NOT! comment ironic considering chastising people reading keeping healthy level skepticism fake news badly written article site stuff like posted an, err, _unreliable_ user, say least. 

Did anyone else thread read past headline? article fake, quote interview cited article exist; whole article disjointed probably made bot feed CNN article.

This site sucks:

- page mess,
- privacy policy page incomplete headings without text end,
- ""Admin"" author articles,
- social links bottom page redirect privacy policy. there?
- address site ""Endurance International Group"", AFAIK. web design / marketing / hosting company, guess. least according much info. think _could be_ theme site using, find address theme grill. Either way, _not_ reliable.

I agree you, making clear disregard it. stuff like this, articles even saying something common sense, get us. going ignore see comment crosspost. Please careful next time. hospital equivalent unsinkable titanic attitude? American must admit 100% wrote incite reaction. well please!  Welph survival smartest 6ft apart like corona virus task force press briefing? Trump rally? Actions speak louder words. pamphlet said welcome check we'd beat invisible enemy. think effect meaningful complete ignoring mask use &amp; social distancing wasted enough. Happy Birthday advance. Maybe two guys night home - play video games together, order pizza, maybe stream big movie he‚Äôs never seen. Hope stay safe. patrick long though? call panic attack, give Valium send home. return send psych evaluation. Dammit Kevin 4th July bbq‚Äôs, ignorance arrogance many Americans insure pandemic continue surge. Thank you, kind. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è aware three articles date back March? also aware virus called ""novel"" book rather new? Lastly, also aware science self-correcting thus cases like new information constantly coming out? No? Well, be, latest scientific evidence suggests said - fact, take long two months infection and, ultimately, death.

To wit - 16 June Calculating accurate IFR challenging midst outbreak relies knowing total number people infected ‚Äî confirmed testing. fatality rate especially difficult pin COVID-19, disease caused SARS-CoV-2 virus, says Timothy Russell, mathematical epidemiologist London School Hygiene Tropical Medicine. That‚Äôs partly many people mild symptoms, whose infection gone undetected, also [**the time infection death long two load shit. 

This entire POST political.

Fuck you. ok. imagine lot health care workers especially reach breaking point sometime soon, already. There's many days go watching people die mental health completely shot shit. happens people say fuck I'm out? many get virus themselves, leaving already overwhelmed hospitals even overwhelmed? course detrimental poison.  Yes, that‚Äôs better. guess leaving room serial killer something Long ago Trump basically told state fend themselves. States literally bidding try score PPE state. Pence Trump acting like Karens ""these states need control kids"" could pretended human, thus creating sympathy. Thats big question even tested negative coronavirus? seems... excessive extreme. would think would exception people tested negative coronavirus. live different lives. live city describe daytime activities. bars restaurants night. family hang property...city folk don‚Äôt space that. 

You aren‚Äôt wrong (what describe fun people know), isn‚Äôt fun everyone. also get hint googling allergen counts. 100% accurate wake runny nose feel post nasal drip something, check one two things. High allergen count itchy eyes? allergies. Either way mask hand sanitizer transmission low use educated guess get information Trump young, talking about? makes perfect sense, people seek information reinforces current beliefs. politicians telling people wear masks lol. ""Social Distancing"" DONT listen media. sadly politicians allowed bar scientists speaking Dude Georgia worse SC terms cases deaths say that? keeps encouraging followers kill base states like FL AZ Youre delusional. believe book genesis? It‚Äôs wild can‚Äôt talk ‚Äúpolitics‚Äù one side clearly trying kill everyone. point, it‚Äôs ‚Äúboth sides‚Äù, need able call out. happen somebody really close, believe fake news...


The worst happens go public ""boohoohoo fault know"" message... getting hard feel compassion sometimes... states think like break US point ...And people surprised why? *Proceeds burn masks* Thanks Obama!

Errr...wait... Hopefully you‚Äôve already appendectomy. Fauci warning month two ago. Trump said warp speed something like said scaring people like you. worry actually different vaccines. rushed vaccine we'd already one. Otherwise think stories people already getting one people getting showing stopping getting disease, lessening symptoms? live Toronto, early crisis Health Care System made public triage protocols. spoke quite bit household sobering information time numbers increasing. information greatly impacted households approach managing exposure. took greater care grocery shopping, invested masks disinfectants etc. acquaintance mine realized obesity factor might prevent receiving care triage condition since taken isolating driving city day hike, order loose weight improve respiratory system. Virginia going phase 3 opening climbing numbers. economy properly capitalize upcoming 4th July. Bro, want go Disney World. Europe ain't thang relate too. couple weird things breathe mouth. Sometimes hold breath think someone looking appear ""normal"". I'm store requires stand across checker hold breathe kind breathe side mouth (it looks like I'm chewing cheek this) feel breathing mouth feels rude. anymore! I'm sure exactly talking wearing mask make comfortable. kid 104 temp, one things remember literally seeing faces coming wall. Freaked fuck out. Parents hospital, can't remember sick from, stuck me. 

Have friend coma talked types things, nightmare stuff. Please tell sick joke amendment brought argument one hahaha Lmao read username heard sung like commercial.

Call J-J WENTWORTH!
877-CASH-NOW Idk, know decent amount people age gotten they‚Äôre fine, one friends sick day lasting symptoms sense smell. I‚Äôm worried getting sake, families sake don‚Äôt want infect  Ok, must dolt pun celebrity's name, real name. ""insult"" even work. low bar. low bar. Sorry hear that. I‚Äôm going back work next week I‚Äôm curious see it‚Äôs like (I work swimming pool bunch new policies keep distance). Hopefully won‚Äôt bad it; couldn‚Äôt imagine deal kinds people daily. also live Canada---Toronto. Including me, half company temporary laid customers lies U.S. Additionally, parts used production international suppliers. Hence, despite reopening Canada, place worked getting worse. fortune policy work recall laid first hire. Go back /nascar I‚Äôll take throwaway account still trust give credit you‚Äôre physician. 

Still one study peer-reviewed used prophylactic early stage virus. tell I‚Äôm physician used didn‚Äôt work. Well evidence? Send 1-2 peer reviewed studies used way described better conversation. 

Look vast majority studies mainstream media showed public. VA study. garbage. Study done France garbage actually poisoned patients tripling FDA approved dosages.

And hydroxychloroquine used millions people worldwide. There‚Äôs literal clinical practice guideline using you‚Äôre physician. 

Risk factors
Female
Over 65
Cardiovascular issues on. 
It‚Äôs extremely easy identify higher risk population shouldn‚Äôt use it. 

Below NIH study Zinc. don‚Äôt care use HQC Quercetin either fine help people used correctly. Won‚Äôt work Thats like holding gun someones head demanding something. choice? yeah. but... really though. probably wont getting one. Im antivax, dont fucking trust big-pharma, corporate rush-job doubt backed pushed shady ways trump. jury still whether lot test kits even work, believe vaccine different mean Canadian geese POOP! Yea, I'm climbing wall. 1) stop giving shit karma 

2) find political subs participate comment viewpoints in. plenty Reddit, idk happened got banned def don‚Äôt let get end account. fact I‚Äôd say shift away strictly politics, find subs fit contribute accordingly question-what testing criteria-are testing people symptoms close contacts turn positive-or everybody want tested encouraged get tested-bc sees like would way get somewhat true idea asymptomatic cases. He'll outright refuse matter casualty count.

In Trump's mind never wrong, add someone calls something deflects. else never admit getting something wrong ultimate sign weakness. he'll continue make big deal it, power through.

That said can't imagine he's happy privately number two guy going message. Well, go. Many young people get asymptotic mild symptoms, smaller amount young people fine. Preexisting conditions increase risk fine. people get sick even without preexisting conditions - don‚Äôt know why. long term effects known. nothing race, everything factual, statistic based, scientific minded decision

It barred Chinese. Also, ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù isn‚Äôt race....

I said xenophobia. Also, race isn‚Äôt even real. It‚Äôs social construct. remember clearly watching Italy news every day unbelievable 5000 died, 7000, 10000 seem real. 

We 125000 seem much Italy 10,000. 

Sadly gotten accustomed seeing much higher numbers deaths. Well...um...could mean 60% 7% people said never lying? trying find silver lining here. o.O Want know many people need study give accurate figures fall claimed results bogus study?

A general rule thumb probably need minimum 100 - 1000 participants per arm, depending accuracy need. accurate results need be, people need. need really accurate results ¬± 1%, may need almost 10,000 people. See diagrams below. 

""Suppose 10% patients expected survive 5 years, wish detect improvement 20%. Figure shows would require approximately 200 patients per group. suppose decide unreasonably optimistic difference seek - chemotherapy trials seem produce great improvement; perhaps 17.5% realistic target. need 300 patients per group (since p - P2= 0.075). maybe 15% (p-p2=0.05) targt: 600 patients per treatment group! Thus, apparent even small changes input variables result dramatic variations sample size estimates."" sample estimates margin error, compensates imperfection sample compared population. example, recent Newspoll put Labor 2% ahead Coalition two-party preferred basis.

Newspoll says surveyed 1,728 people, maximum sampling error ¬± 2.4%. means largest plausible win Labor would 4.4% (2% plus 2.4% margin error), it‚Äôs also plausible could lose 0.4% (2% minus 2.4%).

For tight race might want reduce margin error increasing sample size. costly gains accuracy diminish greater numbers. sample roughly 2,400 people would needed reduce margin error ¬± 2%, massive sample 9,600 reduce ¬± study group 17 given treatment. 
""The medical researchers found 3/17 patients study arm required supplemental oxygen, compared 16/26 control group.""

So think study enough power used guide treatment. Yes, exactly using contact tracing test *people actually may exposed confirmed case/patients.*

Instead, testing ""strategy"" opening testing sites telling people ""go get tested.""

In places like Houston Phoenix, means every ""scared Karen"" -- dinner bar last night took flight week -- going get tested ""just case.""

This means we're 1) delaying tests isolation symptomatic positives 2) extremely inefficiently -- like needle haystack -- finding asymptomatic carriers.

This totally insane. confirm. Years ago take toddler local ER 3am breathing problems. network insurance tried bill us 100% 5 day emergency hospital stay wasn‚Äôt pre approved network visit . spent 12 months fighting take arbitration judge chewed out. problem, place I'd expect people outside state know unless they're also retirees looking relocate lol. 

It's huge place almost 80k residents, believe. hope so, too. &lt;3 Totally BS state lucky 2 3 shoppers wearing masks, outside parks etc one wears masks.
Such bullshit make people believe false narrative feel pain, hurts me. Waiting see Sweden keep looking news everyday... Wait... think shape going gym... can't catch virus? February 26 named head task force Coronavirus. 

**4 months 120 days later.** 

George W Bush's 7 minutes 9/11 NOTHING incompetence tool named Mike Pence. vaccines based past coronavirus vaccine research already tested shown safe. like Oxford example. worry much safe, one vaccines already development shown safe this.

 would assume they'd call destination hospital whether beds full sending chopper. wondering webpage removed. Trump block travel China Jan 31st declared racist media using arguments ""Past studies, too, found international travel restrictions could delay path spread diseases little contain them."" Americans reporting numbers quite scary making stuff like China ok mentality (I recognize cases reported due undertesting, US ramped testing lot past 2 months).

Source quote think realistic chance avoid cataclysm rest US TX/FL get hit really hard mandating shift federal response. really hit Pence Co TX gets hurt. think finding hard come excuses point outright say fucked up. morons LET virus take world. See: Military Keynesianism one said forever. raging pandemic killing hundreds thousands completely filling hospitals. 

I cant imagine someones face could sensitive avoiding thin piece cloth worth risking lives. Bunch narcissistic wimps throwing temper tantrum. Feels like did...... US country obsessed masks Sooo, declare Florida state anarchy? Censorship... sound like China That's death tolls work. Masks distancing great strategy, long people actually use them. now, half people wearing masks distancing half screaming liberty, never work, masks distancing need majority people compliance effective  thats controversial. covid vaccine ""well...you first"" thats unreasonable. Day Tomorrow think we're referring 2 different definitions ""second"" wave. Fauci referring ""global"" second wave, type killed hundreds millions Spanish Flu. referring spikes. Spikes bound happen then. second wave come, hopefully won't, truly devastating. state would whoop states ass One death tragedy. million statistic alternative ""get sick *don't* die, risk living heavily impaired cognitive abilities inability walk flight stairs without gasping air"", I'll take sitting inside. like able think clearly potentially putting higher risk serious health issues rest life. 

Eventually controlled able adapt daily routines reengage world. I'll keep working home meeting friends family weekly ""date nights"" online. Works fine *and* them, I'll years years healthy living ahead me. ‚¢Ä‚£†‚£æ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£†‚£§‚£∂‚£∂

They've also announced they're cutting teachers (no money) must attempt maintain social distancing classroom 20-30 desks. (These changes span elementary, middle, high schools). world handled bars sure handle Flordia too. PCR antibody test results never combined measure fundamentally different things. Positive PCR test shows active infection, probably shedding virus self-quarantine ASAP avoid transmitting virus others. Positive antibody test shows immune system produced antibodies virus, either middle later stages infection infection cleared. Seems fair. exactly demonstrated (as majority) trusted follow rules socially necessary behavior. never mind went bbc directly Blight clubs Americans stupid understand. never happen. I'll get vacinne second available public. kind ironic end presidency border open US Mexican one lmao
 
But actually make good point, wins perfect position isolate US world la North Korea  Illinois. like think we've learned thing two engineering last 80 years. video rights organization Educo says children living world‚Äôs largest refugee camp face heightened risk various forms violence including child trafficking, child labour child marriage amid worsening socioeconomic conditions brought Rahaman, Cox‚Äôs Bazar emergency response Head Mission Eu need understand Rohingya children refugee community already facing various forms violence safety risks due desperate living conditions camps. appalling pandemic created even bigger crisis within existing crisis Rohingya adds: ‚ÄúRohingya children cut outside world schools still shut down, many access learning alternatives. know experience children likely suffer violence homes communities families face extremely uncertain times. difficult imagine level isolation children already living remote camps.‚Äù accurate compare deaths hospitalization rates. I‚Äôve seen plenty medical professionals buying pseudo science make quick buck pandemic.

And masks, lot people recall government lying effectiveness keep stock readily available healthcare workers. feel like lied again.

Its simple, way administration handled epidemic (Us least) caused back forth lead majority population taking seriously believing batshit insane conspiracy theories.

I wish people would wear mask tho  take seriously. said ok confused. don‚Äôt know exact situation Sweden seems careless epidemiologists. risk human life should‚Äôve apparent Wuhan, Korea also Italy. may warrant investigating came decisions. even mad, totally deserve this. one sentence supporting headline. Also, we're worse March lockdown? Makes zero sense. MSNBC trash Fox americans want this. cruel comment work one companies oxford consortium. Production starts assumption license given, stock pile ASAP Gates Fears People May Reject COVID-19 Vaccine

Can‚Äôt one person sit anti-vaxxer another person injects vaccine? Ugh. 

There‚Äôs point one person‚Äôs personal freedom puts people hospital. Bad example, Tacoma Narrows. Bill gates? okay listen to? Yeah bad, read first half, broke completely accurately. Germany Norway went making data public. past 24 hours, Beijing reported 14 new cases virus, taking total since mid-June outbreak food market small number compared thousands daily cases US South America, China reacted quickly contain spread.

We entire states going covid flames noting done. governors even make mask wearing mandatory boy white house would sad! Remember people flipping shit China lying hiding data fabricating data? 

Using common sense, believe people accusing China *OvEr RePorTiNg* cases &amp; death, leads didnt take virus seriously?

I mean... either 

1. Accuse China reporting, make overreaction response like Vietnam/Taiwan. 

or 

2. Accuse China reporting, nothing it. 

Why many falling 3rd option? hurts common sense. Anyone trouble link? Jamaica ‚ÄúCOVID corridor‚Äù. They‚Äôve sectioned part island tourism amenities tourists allowed visit, prohibit going anywhere else.  lucky. dropped everything flew America landed Germany March 16th knew wifi go would probably see knows long. easy decision make still Germany thankful did. went park 2 days reopening. empty, random trash anywhere, meadows didn‚Äôt trails made visitors much wildlife. 
I spent two weeks park changed within short span time. quite. See comment think thats fraction problem .  Yes, caught from. hero need. Thanks fine redditor. well deserved reverse uno card offer even less protection? bad right, huh? Fox News owned Australian Rupert Murdoch. ""with covid"" vs ""by covid"" kinda silly. anything, countries underestimating. Also, patient got ICU COVID dies complications coronavirus, meantime he/she found negative COVID last test, considered cured death counted overall toll. world China's military get vaccine means Good News? wearing mask goggles?  agree California, increased testing partially contributes increased confirmed cases.

Unfortunately, California also experiencing significant increase covid-19 hospitalizations past weeks, see example charts:
 cannot explained increased testing. undeniable fact situation getting worse California.

There also interesting article, although specific people (severely immunocompromised allergic people, example) actually cannot safely take vaccines. complex ""if die disease there's vaccine, fault"". agree every word wrote except going take drastic steps right mitigate loss life coming.

""are going to"" implies happen. won't. Trump worst possible human President United States time. pandemic surely brought painful shortcomings US' functioning whole... outdated talking points, half million dead far. quite bad beginning. fact, took herd inmunity approach first weeks realizing COVID-19 far deadly 2009's H1N1 flu pandemic. Although looks like change heart getting COVID-19 himself. I've thinking this. almost GOP wants base get infected early, survivors mostly immune November.
The ones wearing masks built-up immunity less likely show person vote November.
That's politicize virus. Oh lol. meaning ask OP that? Reddit way offer politics, idk you‚Äôd keep 100% Brit, find worrying using us example follow here! taken diminutive, microscopic, invisible agent unclothe, demorolise expose the

Glaring, uncaring, enormous, TRUMParian EGOtistical NARCISSISTIC veneer, much like Thinners Turpentine paint. 

Trump ""shallower"" bathroom sink. shit ton people going die regardless, states never even peaked peaking now. virus run course. NYC responsible 30% US deaths one point, lack deaths nothing wearing masks right now. Deranged thing covid19 opportunity populist leaders actually claim be, bold decisive. blew completely. counter example look prime minister New Zealand's speech announcing lock down, explain understanding populist fix wrong. understanding populist someone tries appeal majority whether giving promises regarding concerns behaviors. guess mean ""trying popular"". 

The way see politicians populists degree get elected. get elected, remain populists time remain position. guess pretty stupid Covid.
47 days hell, ~30 mildness. Still dealing cognitive/neurological things. 


I‚Äôm younger age range. gave full play play daily going Covid. tried raw possible people young age range could see there‚Äôs it... ELI5 everything. frustrated couldn‚Äôt understand remember smallest thing. still issues... especially speech. Thinking. It‚Äôs always like something tip tongue couldn‚Äôt speak. 

At one point okay dying. feeling towards interest going hospital short breath (I blood clotting disorder stopped taking blood thinner couldn‚Äôt remember things died... well, died. attitude it. would sit bed day... thinking anything particular extreme pain, horrible headache weird things. wasn‚Äôt depressed. there.. 47 days. 

Things definitely different post-Covid people close noticed. It‚Äôs good change bad change. bad last. Wing can‚Äôt pronounce words I‚Äôd like admit. Words I‚Äôve said entire life. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm learning first time. There‚Äôs lot I‚Äôve got get sleep. 

Stay safe. Italy, massive stretch. economy shambles, COVID strongly downplayed last weeks. Suspicions numbers reported raised here. However, proportions people think of. Intensive care units indeed quite empty late, numbers far away real ones. hope humanity work together homogenously prevent climate catastrophe feedback loops, many of, interconnected? European:

We would love see soon possible also visit you.


Can maybe put stamp passports nutcases don‚Äôt take Covid seriously, refuse entrance only? become political posted joke (lockdowns made worse?) Deaths 1k 20 days. keep moving goalposts well. first ""wait 2 weeks see deaths "" 5 weeks. (It's 18.5 days)

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* said leaders echo majority population. implies majority population support supported Trump even never voted him. However failed win popular vote historically unpopular since isn‚Äôt case.

People supporting system allows populist leaders win different point originally said. didn‚Äôt misread anything. feel this. Well said. Germany (state Bayern) bars still closed, since beginning March - riots seen... Yes. However, wear masks.

Source: Nova Scotian. October virus evolved zombie plague fit Spooktober's theme. Absolutely. skepticism, however, not. PTSD cases probably spike roof like happened wars. fact I‚Äôd say shift away strictly politics, find subs fit contribute accordingly

I responding this. Sorry. What's exact place residence? late. late heed warning. late lockdown. late take seriously. late win reelection! collapsed 4 years ago Fair question. quality systems manager pharmaceutical corporation. read lot industry. Bear mind numbers come one region only, Lombardy, control Lega Nord (far right party Berlusconi's allies).

Still, think there's much misinformation going on. truly believe least 10 times infected ppl confirmed positive. good news bc mean death rate equivalent bad flu season (not taking away brutal effects covid) Well.. stupidity What's ideal tine wearing ? I'm really surprised see John propegate research. sample March tested retested. 

Good research methods? Let's least wait peer review. That's nice way putting I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs missed? trying say Karma reason point Reddit? Like said original comment, find communities you‚Äôre interested suit you, subscribe contribute them. get updates via posts topics interest you, interact users via comments share similar interests, meme/shitpost others form bond complete internet strangers. That‚Äôs makes Reddit great IMO, there‚Äôs subreddit virtually anything think get customize feed ones interest you. 

Funny thing karma less care get. you, find subs interest post/comment accordingly. What‚Äôs REALLY happening China bad situations right now. government published enforced evil mask social distancing guidelines, taking away freedom people. Billions people died following guidelines, except leaders smart ones actually listened advises US president instead, cure drinking bleach, exercising freedom gathering large groups, wearing masks.

But unfortunately even leaders smart ones country running bleach. jealous freedom high quality bleach US. government sending spies overseas buy hoard bleach American supermarkets. Buy drink many bottles can, bought Chinese spies!

Unnecessary /s case. Intelligence level people really beyond imagination days, Jesus. shit hits fan they'll cancel surgeries.

Out curiosity, would define ‚Äúshit hitting fan‚Äù? I‚Äôm kinda surprised apparently doesn‚Äôt include variation ‚Äúconfirmed COVID-19 cases spiking ICU beds across city reaching capacity.‚Äù Death tolls hugely lagging indicator. Like, people dying today result policies place month ago. number people die due today's activities show stats month more.

Three reasons there. One worst spreaders younger people, lot less likely die. Two takes weeks go infected dead. finally, reports deaths sometimes delayed several weeks.

So idiot college student got infected bar last weekend, gives granny family event next weekend. Granny kicks beginning August, hear death two weeks August. Quite frankly, mortality stats nearly useless understanding current risks disease, benefits social restrictions. best testing world. logical consequences appalling. guys going - please God, I'm atheist, one favor - Trump loses 2020? going look good next review. True, many die they‚Äôre kicked insurance can‚Äôt afford it? many die can‚Äôt afford rent mortgages commit suicide (look rates they‚Äôve gone staggeringly high since Covid ‚Äî it‚Äôll worse UI goes away). Covid bad, economic collapse devastations come much worse. thought 2008 housing collapse bad, walk park compared this. Economy can‚Äôt go 5 months + shut like this, point it‚Äôs going give. responding implication me? didn‚Äôt claim Yang right-wing. respect efforts, don‚Äôt agree policy ideas. think misunderstood operating given left-wing, would love try persuade centrists/right-wingers (and get moderated comment spam), personally. I‚Äôve seen left-leaning right-leaning people back Yang, didn‚Äôt assume personal politics. That's *exactly* true - areas flattening curves least maintaining level stability. know that, top head, New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Massachusetts decently.

The places sky high infection mostly ones governors decided smarter physicians opened shit back way early. California's spikes, four main counties (most suburbs LA, recall) outbreaks heavily conservative areas thumbed noses Newsom's regulations.

This America collectively gonna flatten curve all, think. We're tragic year (hopefully) get vaccine end early 2021. work restaurant Amsterdam amount noncompliance tourists becoming really frustrating. aren‚Äôt researching rules arrive.

On weekends usually fully booked (we required reservation only) tell people this, look restaurant say ‚Äúwell see loads empty tables there‚Äù. constantly explain social distancing customers building can‚Äôt use around half tables usually have. amount crap receive atm people actually getting down. People won‚Äôt take answer take me. don‚Äôt power require say required, haven‚Äôt done. Spring break shit show. Play cd Strange 2 month ago Indians told everything control won‚Äôt problem. Especially slums. Florida test run Trump November. DeSantis survive nothing contain virus battleground state, Trump see sign survive November. American people political guinea pigs people. everyone talking unsafe vaccines, believe Oxford one proven safe long ago, they're testing efficiency now. potential vaccines, faith Oxford one Cool scapegoating. far two-dimensional portrayals boob tube, different kinds real people need look angles together. vaccine treats one kind technology one price, another twice research 5 times price going issue. way would take publicly-available, free shot government program. definitely following administration. flaunting masks distance

Confused... would good. _Flaunting_ means ""to display ostentatiously"", in, ""Mike flaunting rhinestone mask today.""

...

Ah... mean ""flout"" ""openly disregard""? I'll bet that's it. 
 look like really flout thing though - could ""flout mask regulations"".  Hospitals routinely checking people‚Äôs temperature upon entry. that, haven‚Äôt seen applied. Italy Spain currently left leaning PMs. article mentions right-wing leaders. 
The article well written, fails mention left-wing populist leaders like AMLO (Mexico), Pedro Sanchez (Spain), etc.
The lack criticism towards left-wing leaders doing/did bad, makes think article might biased. need leftist see failure though. Americans Europe still go US back see family btw well said. send Vice President talk President want risk loosing ‚Äúface‚Äù. Why? even use Reddit? Honest question. government can‚Äôt enforce second lockdown they‚Äôre unwilling provide support people. 

Tens millions people unemployed, edge eviction, postponing crucial elective medical evaluations treatments. reality damning second full economic lockdown condemn millions crushing poverty, violence non-COVID related deaths. world thing general outdated term used describe countries sided cold war. would describe country bad disaster response. comment get downvoted? he's surely agreeing comment above. Hey I've saying since March corona lead formation cascadia CDC Fauci lie us models masks. matter worried shortages PPE. profit 'good news'. reading everything bad that's situation, made worse media. means something negative (please read it) often goes hand-in-hand fun side effects anti-intellectualism scapegoating. Look VR technology. Speaking someone VR nearly good right next them. would least help. count seeing long time.  article biased leftist rag piece. require swab test reentry.. talking whether voting ""the right guy"" would've made difference opinion. have. Unless maybe Chinese would've raised alarm earlier would've spread become global pandemic. u infection every country Earth blaming president US seems ridiculous. would nice. bunch older Americans I've seen tried regress old memes lies Facebook try avoid facing reality situation. don‚Äôt need ventilators. need oxygen stunt. short-sighted way keep stock market. cattle milked harvested. seem like looking reasons fail. using general logic, would whole world looking vaccine couldn‚Äôt make good use it? cares world spinning boomers won‚Äôt speak virus, US ‚Äúlosing‚Äù influence, it‚Äôs larger that. Soviet Union fell decades ago, trade partnerships still act like containment strategy. let member states skate NATO contributions years foreign policy interests, w navy secures *all* global trade. All. 

We finally moving towards transactional set relationships actually get something exchange stop rolling tariffs protectionist policies. saw Trump banded Merkel hyperbolic bill ‚Äúservices rendered‚Äù Germany whole world put surprised Pikachu face.

As WHO, US US entities fund operation, didn‚Äôt label thing pandemic March, long China basically welded residents dormitories. useless us.

Lastly, huge mistake non-Americans make operate belief President unilateral authority whole county. federal courts stymied Trump administration almost every turn policy, local state governments dictate policies like businesses operate capacity - courts loaded cases too. It‚Äôs like hearing someone complain EU didn‚Äôt act decisively enough. EU doesn‚Äôt make German French health policy. US government doesn‚Äôt make North Carolina Florida health policy either. Yes. smart, informed citizens care neighbors small business wasn‚Äôt hard enough already. going fail next 6 months America, land free stupid Alas, summarized modern Western societies Top 3 states account 320,000 cases approximately, guess right. amazing way finally see EU action actually working hand hand make europe ""great again"" 5g Sorry, fired up. right that. Ny announced yesterday 5 deaths. seems weird considering worldometers showing daily deaths around 30-40. worldometer showed 32 deaths instead 5. idea theres discrepancy? work hospital .... doctor nurse? doctor studying COVID? role? many journals reading understand them? 

They analyzing strains. 

It doesn‚Äôt take months symptomatic. 

Your spreading fear without credentials. research long viral particles stay body? want fuel/quell anxiety super crackpot theory COVID airborne HIV. Yeah, people predictably ""stoopid""---all time. First thing buy masks filtersfor respiraors case gloves. Made couple gallons hand sanitiser loving gf started making cloth masks wear every day. Also traded beef cow one ready butcher put freezer. TP? Hell, gf huys stuff case big box stores never shortage. Cant understand people hoarding tp know damn well food water survival calls for.... Even China lied take worst case prediction happened. probably still less severe US. New challenger entered arena. Welcome show... Nebraska! 

Now look forward following cycle: 

1) one following half measures put place government, 
2) protests go back work, 
3) spikes cases get 100% ICU capacity, 4) premature reopening, 
5) repeat. Around 400 deaths per day. infected three 3 states reporting around 50-150 deaths day. rest country another 100. Hello fellow osider. agree shit ridiculous here. People absolutely fucking whole town house parties not. also depends define adult. saw video woman throwing tantrum grocery store (and tossing everything cart onto ground) asked wear mask. chronological age suggests adulthood mental age not.  That‚Äôll stop virus!
/s  true.. couple days ago bus saw guy army cop wearing masks. uniform. Shit like help official looking people even wear masks everyone gonna use excuse either..

Also made lose faith humanity went shopping mall get groceries. right stores opened again. lines sometimes 50+ people front shoe clothing stores. saw mothers 2 children baby waiting get store. mean first can't order stuff like online? second, really important get new pair jeans risk families lives for? whole mall packed least half people wearing mask nose.

That also made realize officials beginning said masks help. Cause people apparently stupid put correctly. lot comments screaming ""don't let cure worse virus"" Trump speak. Gotta,gotta,gotta get out. Quarantine inhibited bar patrons bad, get drink spurt defiant nonsense bad sucks. Spraying everyone within 20 feet laced sputum. Either shut mouth wear mask. social gatherings important shout boisterous beliefs sucks. Learn stop talking loud much. Learn swim... It‚Äôs video show graph doctor goes mask wearing politics. numbers deaths looking? spiked much, guess recovered people truly recovered left lightly. Hi there, may know situation now? keep going better? what's percentage people pull ask workers question? experience 90 Here's hour long video analysis Zooming Simone Gao, interested: [The Coverup early Chinese response Corona. disagree. worked, UK better end US. UK shining example either. Compared similar countries, even considered epicenter pandemic Italy, done poorly. 10% new cases ( 4\~6 cases per day ) unresolved days certainly remain undetected community spreads might cause future cluster.

However, immediate problem speed reproduction fast quarantine authority barely keeps n-ary infections existing clusters. still feel pretty much then. need alarm panic, death toll pretty small. basically severe flu outbreak. can't reason sadists. never worked then?

Dunning Kruger shit right here. Quit spreading ignorance masked authority. know serious George Clooney get involved. come diesel software? actually hug because... Well covid wear mask google see PLA protected people 1998 flood 2008 earthquake, pandemic year. Don‚Äôt forget selfish entitled. biggest mistake US made telling people mask wearing would protect PEOPLE, themselves. wear masks tell people wear masks, setting model? ""balanced budget"" didn't, basically praise country earth. need get self-aware 

What flawed premise. fair, thing ad safe vaccine virus. Vsccines takes years develop test. Testing important part due pandemic, curve big time. know long term effects vaccine many vaccines. 

So yeah... anti vaxxers time even people medical field already saying get it. reasonable thing. hes saying that. really need forget vaccine rely that, screwed. problem non compliance seeing many people. one closest launch Military people

CCP little regard troops, imo. I'm Chinese, know nothing PLA internal politics know little bit way soldiers fed treated.

I'm still thinking much lockdowns seasonality endemic human coronaviruses caused decline: curve reverse pretty soon!
So keep telling me. know fact Florida, protests haven‚Äôt tied large amount spread. Outside protests combined mask usage seemed helped. Now, reopening indoor spaces bars/clubs/full capacity restaurant social distancing tables, etc‚Äî led community spread younger community seeing now. friends (20-35yrs) partying clubs, bars, etc alcohol banned onsite consumption.

So summary extremely unlikely child die covid, would expect quite similar flu (which joke itself).

Nothing lasting, effects, would bet 4% required intubation bounce back week like nothing happened... what? Meanwhile people keep blaming protests. clubs good event super spread.  Cutting corners?

It's matter life death. would dare cut corners?

I can't understand Western mind. UK made joke brexit, wonder would continue corona crisis. believe poster trying say Chinese military willing many troops die attempt achieve victory, shown less concern casualty rates western armies have. 

Although one reads WW2, Allies seem much concern would expect now. joke depends ""Pedigree""?? Lol. vicious.

However, husband student loans relatively high income earner area (so I, matter) number rapidly tilted favor positive worth since then. knocked mortgage last year, car done next month, I'll student loans worry about.

I'm part couple 10k+ community FB groups crazy reading posts last week. due testing, explosion cases. 

Most people two groups think got work family gatherings. People scared. Trying find places test. wait long lines. Urgent care places packed people standing outside 7am. 

I've never seen anything like it. like watching movie. People really sick too. sniffles. Wheezing, coughing, diarrhea, high fever, headaches. Florida serious trouble. promised never speak night again. still think USA NUMBER ONE !!!!!!!

Everyone (as well many experts) saying probably missing 10-20 cases every confirmed case March April. We‚Äôre probably missing many now. Florida reported 70k tests Saturday Sunday, days 30-40k tests. I‚Äôm trying minimize things all, compare raw numbers confirmed cases confirmed cases March April. 

Additionally, know lot covid now. remember first started psychopathology professor said us would probably get virus vaccine available, goal everything power hold getting it. Outcomes would much better 6-12 months March. know that‚Äôs true too. also know hitting working people opposed nursing homes (which Florida‚Äôs deaths come before), also decrease fatality rate. biggest difference population density. Florida dense NYC suburbs. Public transportation joke. It‚Äôs situation. much counteracted New Yorkers taking seriously Floridians yet determined. 

Not trying minimize anything, it‚Äôs new confirmed cases similar. That‚Äôs good enough metric. chinese lived US 10 years, found ironic even behind great fire wall, chinese youth knew world US young generation access ""free information""

People general desperate answers return normalcy facing may insurmountable obstacles horizon result whole thing. 

The media, left right, manipulating nation tearing apart finger-pointing, misinformation, blame, panic, deceit.

Anywhere served food requires order food want drink.

It's fucking joke. countries seem manage drug research without need bankrupt everyone. suspect ""research costs"" ridiculously inflated USA system, way medical bills charges are, keep profit flowing every stage process.

just alone helps infection rate shoot faster cruise ship individual rooms, bathrooms, hygiene, fucking quality life. valid concern. Scientific research usually moves forward incremental steps, confirming building previous studies data becomes accepted facts. really two steps forward, one step back kind process. 

Now preliminary studies reported media general public accepts everything facts. months later see contradictory study erode societies already fragile belief science. Europe Obama might loved

""Loved"" probably big word it. ""Well liked, lot better Bush!"" like it.

Americans need learn integrate. created coronavirus vaccines aplenty, none FDA approval use humans.

There also veterinary coronavirus vaccines. believe whole 'dont buy masks' thing buy healthcare professionals time acquire masks. Thats 'stay home' orders, rest us need masks, since home anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

We basically bought 3 months time order fix supply chains, personally still cannot find N95 mask anywhere. kind people USA would want travel July August exactly kind people want coming country. Actually went weekend *very* nice Italian place (my city known area great Italian food) quite frankly best evening I‚Äôve months. many others don‚Äôt understand useful simple pleasures life, like going nice meal, us humans. cut extras exist mindless husks, aren‚Äôt really living. me, growing number others, fate worse &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;0.5% us dying anybody gonna make Jaws reference? 'We've GOT CLOSE BEACHES'  What?

You said rather 'vacation hell' kids home semester.

Why fuck anyone feel bad person 3 kids hates spending time them?

You always give adoption; people would love single child maybe way they'd grow well adjusted.

But guess people need control someone.

Sucks kids, lots people get shitty parents, hopefully kids too. 6% total New York nursing home residents died COVID due orders. allow testing within facilities. forced facilities accept COVID patients, even facility inadequately prepared handle care. changed policies early May. Since NY seen rate 2%. 

States forced similar orders Michigan 5% New Jersey 12%. States actually listened CMS Florida rate 1.6% California, similar orders Cuomo changed quickly, rate 2%. June 15, 2020.

Then Texas would allow employees within skilled nursing/assisted living facilities. Employees residents tested weekly well. 

New York highest nursing home deaths per CMS 37.3% reporting said deaths. California 1/3rd number nursing home deaths compared NY 94.7% facilities reporting. Texas 1/6th 93.6% reporting.

So yeah. Interesting. virus entering human cells easily, would expect shorter ""incubation period"" well. ""incubation period"" really time needed virus generate enough replicas significant impact body. United, divided right now. sad situation US moment. general biological basis, viruses try reproduce much possible, viruses can't reproduce kill host, mutating viruses become infectious yet less deadly host, mutating good thing. I've always questioned anyone bars. 

Alcohol cheaper stores drink home (or wherever), worries driving home afterward.

Big plus avoid potentially fatal virus. thought reason Aerosmith wrote song ever want miss thing ""There's reason anyone walking around mask on""

\-Fauci's Coronavirus advice March 8th, 2020 clearly racist. beaches thing draws tourists. depends were. Northeast shut real. going used ""DaNEs CAUsEd SwedEN'S InFEction"" argument, negates ""but imported infections Alps Sweden worse off"" narrative pushed Tegnell co.

According researchers University Copenhagen, argument indeed seem negated. know makes happier, seeing argue infections Sweden Sweden's fault, meaning Sweden's situation Denmark's fault.

It's interesting 1st time 20% come threshold number, however. believe month 2 ago someone theory 20- 30% needed. think cross immunity also reason given, I'm recalling right, I'm sure even found articles anymore. weird headline, trust US world leader going drastically since year two 9/11. opening.

You‚Äôre looking consumer point view, that‚Äôs fine. look economics, it‚Äôs simply unsustainable. fund lot county health education housing projects licenses city county fees. There‚Äôs lot non business owners know adds quite bit. would say average million $ per year business contributes $30,000 year licenses bar food industry number real? means decline great there's something fishy it.... knowledgeable area, sanctions affecting children Africa? Vote! way. Never understood people come sit next 100ft empty beach. Also stay far away tourist insist feeding flying rats can. I'm city west coast Florida beginning shut beaches Miami others tourist started showing here. closed beaches started showing place could park near body water. 

We beautiful bridge goes one barrier islands people crowding parking grass, median, insane like nothing I've ever seen. opening bars today. I'm stressed. 6 feet suggested distance people pass walking, sitting right next 2 3 hours more. 6 feet nearly enough case, airlines even spacing people apart. Masks help, they're 100% effective, especially something flying crowded airplane hours. consider food essential. grow food home. need garden supplies. Growing food home reduces amount trips need take grocery store exposing potentially getting spreading virus. Going get groceries highest risk activity do, reducing amount time spent inside crowded grocery stores helps.

This spring shutdown, indeed many plants still planted. Beans, lettuce, carrots still fine plant example. **This AMA begin 12pm EST. Please refrain answering questions guest(s).

Again, loss drawing conclusions said. vaccine goes clinical trials see effective not. vaccine yet complete clinical trials yet proven effective. point suggest vaccine that's tested different vaccine that's also going clinical trials. Trying make rent go homeless.

Making sure someone spends time energy coming basic means subsistence fantastic way make sure someone time politics activism. that's Aftonbladet's business model. shitty tabloid puking sensationalist headlines grab stupid peoples attention. thing realize one person make difference. great learnings bureaucracy built protect nation...really world, swept away. learned one man pick grossly incompetent servants overcome obstacles presented previously good administrations. Well done President Trump, got rid deep state state chaos. didn‚Äôt data time suggested masks effect keeping safe Covid. 

On top fact certain masks, like N95 masks, effective worn properly, includes fit tested. they‚Äôre not, would literally wasting it. 

As far masks go, anything N95 going protect covid. cloth mask surgical mask mainly reduces spread you‚Äôre sick. doesn‚Äôt really block virus infecting you. Cheaper buy flight ticket India get infected U.S. news said made drive-through test, test site Austin Emergency Center ER visit. 

$6K test insane. PSA ... don't. Two options. Bottle, Depends.... underpants type things incontinent older people wear. I'm surprised they're already marketing people long haul drives. use barbell lifts, wipe after, least lower risk touching every machine half dumbbells everyone else touched. Great post. see people people (in groups) focusing almost irrelevant minutiae letting big picture escape reckoning.

None us pay this. would suggest 1‚Ä¶ better safe ~~pregnant~~ sorry! brexit coming... can‚Äôt even tell us masks truly effective (only past 2 weeks pushed this) can‚Äôt even tell us transmits surfaces, distance transmits.. coronavirus‚Äôs aren‚Äôt brand new phenomenon they‚Äôve studying years yet somehow they‚Äôre already stockpiling potential vaccine? guess there‚Äôs way vaccine WONT distributed they‚Äôre stockpiling it.

Yup, make couple fairly well people good insurance bill $6,408 procedure $199 make writing stuff like off. example made mandatory public transport

Nope. Masks mandatory public transport shops states (as far aware). numerous places (depending state) e.g.:

- taxis
- hairdresser beauty stuff
- hospitals doctors offices 
- museums, galleries, etc.
- cinemas 

And (serious) talks getting rid it. 

There also really people wearing masks need to. people wearing badly alarming rate. live city basically Corona free 7 weeks straight. mom thing me. lawyer able get removed mortgage, could prove parents financially abusive. pretty infuriating, probably never actually home everything done use get money themselves.

No. worth effort me. 100k down, guess 200k go Eat dick doubt interested. hate guy most. politically incorrect rebel, mask probably comes hood. ilk made bad situation worse. they're scrambling- public good November coming fast. Better argument made UBI/income equality forcing low wage workers hot zone afford ramen month. States mass protests seen rise cases though. Probably actually protesting without mask relative states essentially reopened. there's state income tax, yes, many permanently reside state (Oct-Apr/ Nov-May) take advantage lower taxes retirement disbursements. can't imagine wanting set permanent residence elsewhere pay upwards 15% state's taxes. Look asshole. I'm shit everyday. I'm market. never stopped working. keep spouting bullshit It‚Äôs flu really care 60,000 people killed flu every year? Honestly. ever thought discussed poured empathy out? I'm guessing no. not? They're valuable who've died Covid. yea 300k remark anti-vaxxers.

Yes tards big ass fans! That's literally brand name them. Ah yes say true. dreaming successfully behind us really hope surge cases make number tripple coming weeks. Hard disagree. Physically mentally it‚Äôs one best things yourself.

The gym go machines taped access every machine. Temp readings check in. Everyone wiping machines.

Is risk? I‚Äôm blind fact. opinion COVID-19 isn‚Äôt going anywhere business operate safely possible, leave customer base.

If absolutely precautions taken, that‚Äôs different story altogether. Spam stuff nursing homes, I‚Äôm sure Hannity let sleep point. Same. Age 32, married kids. 2 cars paid off. Decent house nice suburban middle class area 1/3 paid off. minimal student loans (&lt;10K) paid first couple years college. Neither husband dormed went away school. went local universities (for engineering nursing) held min wage jobs living home minimize debt.  grants, scholarships personal savings cover costs. far mostly unaffected pandemic. 401k went back up. would like Gilligan‚Äôs Island, except they‚Äôd Gilligans lol. makes little sense able stop it. locked everything hell down. Trust one China going around without mask and/or coughing people told wear mask (like America). still question numbers, people spread virus. spread itself. Masks limited contact work. wear N95 better, confer protection. people wearing those, though (and worn correctly another issue). go start non-profit multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical company. Absolutely! definitely want nation states done nothing mitigate spread travelling across Europe end thousands cases every day hundreds days.

We've managed 4 days 0 deaths Scotland.

A refreshing change. outdoor bars open SF, saw plenty people drinking street weekend, even shit June gloom wanted let know hard relate sitting here, thinking crippling amount debt years since last ""vacation,"" saw headline. scared last night thought experiencing shortness breath knew might make it, despite 27 years old, able afford healthcare. fucking sucks like said we're alone. Alex, 4 states highest per capita COVID-19 death tolls?

Four states stopped spread letting C19 max damage. Good job, guess? Driving is, then... month? American, fucking good. bunch irresponsible, dumb fuckheads. Glad Europe takes. Everyway want agree hes right. Since right die less important right protest. Also, protesting founding nation? Founded slave holders owners. gonna say something? clear mean OP likely reinfected, it‚Äôs likely OP protected second infection. there‚Äôs downside playing safe. Also someone immigrant parents, cultures lack stigma around normalize adult children living parents married (and even then, multi-generational households occur). always found mainstream US attitude isolating. I‚Äôm married I‚Äôd want close folks/extended family rather pure nuclear family thing. There's paper breaks pool size versus prevalence community that's pretty easy follow - high-level here: personal understanding prevalence needs low enough could reasonably expect none 1 positive sample per pool, every sample needs tested again. So, 30 would huge sample, small one. efficient pools negative. Even means ""pool"" two. Florida number going but. good sign. perspective city recording 80 cases per day, population 300,000. America screams! know modern medicine business? work one majors cited it‚Äôs completely inaccurate less half. fact, reopened lock step Abbott, receiving employee communications contained exact wording regulations days ahead public announcement pressers. Hmmm. 

And guess what, we‚Äôve surge positive cases. Though won‚Äôt attribute location. Also hmmm. run masks anyways. But, know happened hospitals said masks PPE needed people US donated masks started sew make donate. Every craft brewer distiller became hand sanitizer companies. People attempted hoard profit called out. 

They tell truth Feb build trust equity cashing now. tell American people truth masks work please lets make sure health care workers, first responders essential workers first make one old shirt.

We panic buy toilet paper legit shortage overnight half demand TP went Commerical Residential usage completely different supply chains distrubution networks. No, article saw yesterday, 1 person gym group got coronavirus 0 non-gym group. terrible study never released. Yeah I‚Äôm 30s living folks can‚Äôt afford buy one wage. They‚Äôre state caravaning 80% year days anyway it‚Äôs allowed save enough money survive years without work lol.  Thats good point. right say inevitably, huge web. Spreads loved ones opposite side political fence come home. Forgive ignorance. believe he's : dumb ignorant. ""Very stable geniuses"" need learn stuff, find brilliant solution themselves, see. enforced meaningful extent. Yeah guys saying months now, kinda gets old.

Fl numbers handled leaps bounds better NY, media somehow makes sound like FL apocalyptic remember time toughness valued American trait. Although like over-praise obvious decent thing, feel good making good decisions when, let's real, yeah, pretty fucking hard sometimes. live alone area even plateaued yet, sucks. I'm tougher bad days. That's thing feel like Americans used share.

And fucking crybabies throwing toys around can't whatever want months entire lives. Good fucking grief. imagine we'd sorry bunch rely WWII? We'd fucked. Currently there's 5 active cases Atlantic Canada (all NB). That's true everywhere, time. Portugal one countries makes easier, wages low though Yup, we've three coworkers test positive corona virus since reopened indoor dining. state report management sweeping rug. even closing proper sanitation cleaning restaurant.. Let‚Äôs say, use numbers, costs $400 research, develop manufacture drug. everyone buys $60, don‚Äôt make profit, don‚Äôt research drug, covid treatment. 

India can‚Äôt afford $390/vial, sell cheaper order make enough cover $400 cost R&amp;D.

If funded drugs upfront public money, wouldn‚Äôt need make profit back drug created. since rely private corporations develop drugs, price make money back sale drug. 

The solution universal healthcare. mean, live Vancouver so, yeah. Pretty easy say January mostly lot rain maybe snow soon melts away. Would make sense become lethal? I‚Äôve seen dodgy websites claim something like ‚Äúthe new mutation much deadly‚Äù, clearly click baits feasible theoretically? They're meaningless. tell you, fairly good accuracy, whether RNA sequences detectable swab. 'gold standard' would patient cough culture plate see culturable virus, that's wildly impractical everyone. However, definitely randomized trials test accuracy PCR tests. Ugh. area's lot better that. Oh ok thanks blood think America's insanely high numbers correct? president literally announced loud he's taking actions suppress actual numbers. mask mostly prevents spreading droplets direct area. little protect breathing people's droplets buildup droplets unventilated area 

Masks situations short, face face interaction unavoidable, magic shield. store running 3 weeks pick up! But, every time walked place, literally employees standing around kibitzing shit.

No idea employees filling orders, super annoying. NY went Nursing Home Hospital died Hospital, 'Hospital Death'.

A lot states go back clean attribute case fact patient originated Nursing Home EVEN THOUGH died hospital.

Cuomo trying cover butt calling nursing home deaths. üëç think mask requirement help ton despite house parties starting see now. restaurants area pretty dead indoor dining, still seems like people eating outside mainly take out. deal whole process sounds shitty stressful regardless outcome.  feel guys. customer service roles disproportionately young. science proving covid spreads extremely easy indoors people dont wear mask.  19 times harder spread covid outdoors.  Therefore pretty simple conclude non essential business doesnt require mask closed globally. NYC seems control, space handle bump, probably best ER people world deal given experience, patience caution save lives. Good hear. waste time? 

If could prove point, would, clearly case. Oh man, wants much, rally middle biggest increase cases USA. stay opinions. someone lived city RNC: Jacksonville need shit. kills business convention area (and really whole city, like COVID done enough already), chain linked fences blocking traffic police riot gear everywhere, tensions police people high, crucible.

0/10 recommend basis alone. stock market already priced V-shaped recovery. (I know reflect economy...) assisted living situations foot grave like true ""nursing home"" residents.

Not necessarily, lot folks want go nursing home come assisted livings instead. people pretty ill even hospice.  Good. Throw mad shade anyone following rules. really refuse take money. Doubt that. mayor sherrif tight. trust random, accountants algorythms take bunch criteria determine bill. suprised [soft credit hear teachers unions threatening strikes cause lower pay kroger employees got early time this. Makes sense...force teach control this. Cant done let alone low pay. districts already squeezed tight cutting it. Crazy times. severe later symptoms probably mostly immune pathology correct?

Thus, RNA polymerase inhibitor, might expect work best early on? long term healthcare compromised might insane. still solid understanding long term consequences virus. that's job remember problem fines? Shame Abbott make clear (unintentional not) ""loophole"" municipalities could force businesses mask employees *and* customers which, book, ""passing buck."" small portion population gets mad, it.  r/FauciStatesTheObvious don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre getting downvoted. closed lot beaches means people crowd beaches closed rest go restaurant bars day. R number you‚Äôre referring to. European focus keeping R 1 means virus slowly dies down. I‚Äôve heard focus USA obviously don‚Äôt live hospital, procedure, ER visits; first time without insurance (pre-existing condition pre-ACA) billed $15000, second time insurance billed $3000 (still ridiculous CT scan) paid deductible. prices CT scan itself. American healthcares system abomination. you? entire point people don‚Äôt get banned r/politics. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs case. safe outdoor gatherings drinking someone‚Äôs deck 6 feet away other? I‚Äôve turned invitations kind events, tbh really want hang friends :) Why? China call say they'd like another round PR?  refusing wear masks eligible health insurance coverage COVID-19 contract within 15 days concert. sue singer venue cover costs realized can't afford care, already many people taking precautions avoid COVID-19 need coverage. believe apply political rallies protests. Vladimir played well: cannot beat ""them""? send somebody pulls right strings name national greatness ""them"" implode don‚Äôt see issue getting bottle favorite booze sitting outside friends six feet apart. Cheaper. Safer. Hell, order Uber eats you‚Äôre it. want understand 3 year old child could died low numbers, take look video covid wing Hospital San Juan de Dios [this right first photo. article happens good too. stocks go fire hazard. confirm, Texas. family member texting another relative Covid-19 back February. shocked heard this. real truth comes iron taken blood every week told antibodies Covid-19. thought getting antibody test Quest Diagnostics lab said even positive could mean one 6 human corinavirus. family member several others think care follow guidelines. Exactly, tell states indoor dining opened weeks. Maybe hotspots start closing again, bet many states keep keeping open restaurants. also mask wearing dumb guy, alarming know pretty dumb yourself, yet see MANY people clearly much dumber everywhere. never left vs right issue first place. virus care, it'll treat same. Monte de Oro winery!! already here, long states. social media. Canada type divide USA does. think potential become divided USA issue. different parts country/world, Arizona schools usually open late July/first week August. Sad. :( NJ resident restaurant worker - going open indoor dining anyways. outdoor seating modified menu carryout. let go half FOH staff surviving. Canceled liquor license too. Whatever takes outlast thing - support mom pop restaurants ! forget tip :) That's excellent point thinking well. Sure, flu doesnt spread quite effectively coronavirus, seen extensively respiratory virus spread last months. There's doubt outbreaks get seeded people carrying south, extent big question ‚ÄúLook tough guy *open nose throat!*

-Bill Burr remember thing didn‚Äôt remember story poster linked to. /r/itrunsdoom, mean? üòÇ  Oh, think least bit tenable, governors plan today. entertainment, hospitality, events, convention, sports industries dead Illinois. Based Lightfoot's abrupt change ""stay inside forever"" ""we need open restaurants early"", think reality setting in. know Pritzker changes mind, deems something random ""effective"" treatment (even isn't), waits forced courts. Don‚Äôt bring this. ü§ò Half Americans scream rights, half wear store half refuse wear outside Yep, pretty young - went see ""The Elephant Man"", it. proudly say got spat on. overjoyed time. Funny, seems little icky now. Federal seals immediately contact nearest FBI field office. don‚Äôt agenda all. 

It‚Äôs two part answer.

1. There‚Äôs absolutely way protests advisable terms controlling virus. don‚Äôt know level spread contributed to, impossible know, you‚Äôre suggesting impact all. laughable.

2. media completely forgetting Covid thing people protesting mass gatherings undermined lockdown contributed people returning lives degree, better worse. think beloved protestors aren‚Äôt people that‚Äôs also hilarious. I‚Äôm separating two. 

The proof numbers. I‚Äôd suggest agenda that‚Äôs can‚Äôt accept it. Apparently type exercise matters. Yoga classes may carry less risk than, say, spin class zumba.  Well it‚Äôs risk I‚Äôm willing take. 3 months video games puzzles sleeping, want one thing thats lifting. I‚Äôm inside rest day. even get groceries delivered get slot. point, even me, introverted person world, start losing it. mental health much better don‚Äôt mind staying inside rest day. hope right. Texan hard time believing though I've witnessed last couple months re-opening. Damn August 17th seems pretty early start school. going back this? sound voluntary exactly fitness results looking I'll bet 99.3% Americans diagnosed it

Per CDC 99.6% get survive.

Hopefully two facts help calm nerves Iowa Condos vent other, fire hazard. charge based saving hospital patient days though. recouping billions research drug failed everything else trying be. they've found new niche billion dollar bust drug pushed Covid wonder drug 50 cent 1 dollar options ran off. teachers probably plastic box front class yet he‚Äôs still wearing mask! That's still way better flying commercial. could avoid going gas stations except absolutely necessary. Make brief thoroughly wash/sanitize leaving getting back car. much control situation driving yourself. You‚Äôre braver people am. try landlords wat? We've already hugely affected this. forget lockdowns? thanks. get allergic depth info.

It weird climate online days. I‚Äôm genuine. Hope you‚Äôre able speak someone mostly Sunday‚Äôs numbers correct? Christ, LA alone accounting half CAs numbers far...that can‚Äôt good LA pretend complete fucking scumbag, one's fucking buying it, absolute bastard. Around believe think term rural means immune... nuts!! still mask, stupid either. son back daycare force think germ factory he‚Äôs time. Thank God China $100 per person isn‚Äôt hard. It‚Äôs solid ballpark decent Friday night IMHO. 

If go bar hopping afterwards, add another $60-100 top.  Like old people article pic? beaches? look predominantly young me. would violate constitution, freedom movement clause. forgot add countried like sweden guy. warnings reopening early. liberal media telling people immune outside protesting.

Nobody saying that. [4 days NY/NJ numbers dropped drastically. Everything essentially shut changed way living, except knuckleheads South Jersey/Jersey Shore.

Damn knuckleheads. woke!!? That's really question asking. question is, right now, much trust government regulate speech 1st amendment rolled back? correct answer all. crux issue roll back constitutional rights must accept they'll never come back cede power entity times ran worst possible people. trust Trump regulate speech way shape form ever favor rolling back 1st amendment. wary first think enough examples point places like Taiwan Japan somewhere responsible enough consistent enforcement things pretty safe. Unfortunately US that's pipe dream across board gym appears meeting standard members well. also helps close hour mid-day clean go pretty soon after. feel safer gym grocery store. far. Canadian here. insane part pay test all. 

We see bill tests (inpatient outpatient), inpatient treatments hospital. Yes. live society.  I'm going 2 - 3 times week go times one there. max three people time I've gone. mental well me. Ok. see want see. leaders definitely picked side that? maskless. Nobody wear mask called good anymore. I‚Äôve travelling tube buses London (the time it‚Äôs mandatory wear UK) mask wearing easily 95% hundreds people I‚Äôve shared carriages buses with. Someone wrong thing, decides right thing. That‚Äôs good thing. Better late never really  Oh see introduced Trump's bigly ego. puts lives danger. guess could open whole worms.... looking antivaxxers 7% must concentrated entirely within state Arizona.

On multiple trips past weeks, ratio non-masks masks increased drastically walk store basically assuming one else (save staff) wearing mask. Yes course many reasons ICU beds used. Covid pushing past capacity surge capacity. unsustainable hospitals communities implementing.

That always concern exponential growth.

I don‚Äôt think disagreeing talking differnt things. Absolutely!!!!!


This going EPIC!!! 

I going need lot popcorn I've seen source document AZ cards. Hoping going lose biggly, base scary... that's factoring Russia going vote Mother spoken. Except it‚Äôs easy prove weren‚Äôt wearing seatbelt time accident. going prove mask wasn‚Äôt time infection? one wear 24/7. Sure. Could nature rights comes when. anyone else. Nature's ultimate B. Unless lab created thus man made repeat.  That's lie 

Source: work gas station see /all/ types people. I'll partially disagree pandemic, *lot* mobilization required prepare combat dependent politicians part *correctly*. Securing ramping manufacturing PPE would still dependent govt people put charge ensuring national stock pile depleted, new sources acquired, equipment delivered.

We could go enforcing shutdown measures, ramping vaccine research funding, ensuring people work financially covered, etc., part overall response required. problem part people listen doctors scientists, part inept people power can't properly act advice experts. big state ig haha. I'm Williamsport. Yes. Although read eight times posted it. work competitor AZ? Oh lord jesus, guessing drunken fireworks play part I‚Äôm concerned outbreaks, highlighted talking they‚Äôve seen massive daily spikes. 

NY seen lowest daily deaths today deaths tend follow cases weeks.

California ridiculously bad, worst, they‚Äôre trying contain mask orders etc.

I think anti-mask, anti-lockdown stuff proven effective. Four months. Absolutely unforgivable. fixed (almost) everything Watchmen. Well, really good. Ok, helped bit. local mask orders. seems helped. Prior orders 50% mask wearing. something probably enough. Everyone still go work even work home. However, businesses going back work home employees staying onsite refineries. They're also going back paying people call isolate homes. Frankly, big oil gas businesses, part, seem take seriously government.  Wut goes hand hand short termism prevents loads see Yes. believe ignorance lack trust institutions, rightfully so. honestly think hospitals, including roofs hallways everything city 7+ million completely full? suburbs cities able help? ICU city's 4 hospitals run 85% full normal day year ago. one Houston opened elective surgeries got high number. shit hits fan they'll cancel surgeries. That's worries young people getting virus may actually good thing. Closer herd immunity think virus exposing interesting philosophical divides people. rush develop vaccine results one gives complete immunity 99.5% time, kills 0.5% oldest, immune-compromised patients, good vaccine bad one?  Would pass vaccine October 2020, stay locked October 2021 better one?

Because that‚Äôs virus does, kills 0.5% infected, leaves rest immunity. FB commentors may look conclude it‚Äôs real threat.

If Allied General D-Day, trying wipe scourge deadly government world ever seen, take beaches win war 99.5% troops surviving, good attack bad one? 

Again, that‚Äôs calculation young people doing. get (no way social distance/remote work min. wage jobs), survive (according science) they‚Äôll immune able put food table. 

Not saying it‚Äôs right calculation, wish folks would try understand people‚Äôs points view attacking brain deads (like comment doing). federal guidelines linked released May recently 2 weeks ago Trump discouraging mask-wearing downplaying pandemic claiming almost over. sets example followers, that's states asskisser governors take independent action proportional actual severity pandemic. must follow science. Triage - sort like might seen MASH, hospital decide get ICU bed based various factors like survivability, age, ability Washington almost 20k tests day. Might want check sources. Around 11k Friday 9k Saturday. Wait, really? live Pensylvania I've seen people wearing masks.  include fauci Bill Gates? Lmao. y‚Äôall hypocrites. That's fair rebuke, he's really done harm good. Listen doctors scientists *that beholden Trump. situation Beijing important future policies. 

Beijing hit heavily first wave (only 100-ish positive), resident antibodies. current cluster circulating least 10 days ""flared up"", quite bad considering contagious virus is. far 300 positives event. eventual cases contained 1000 Beijing month, would think whack-a-mole approach optimum. 

By way , current Beijing lockdown nowhere close Wuhan Hubei back January. problem comply similar level lockdown 2 months Shanghai; (However, agree 3 months Wuhan-style lockdown probably unbearable living souls. ) think people paying attention doctors/scientists now. Everyone instantly turned influencers lol I'll take biden, bitter pill. So, Florida. I'm wrong all. posted proof, posted opinion.  That's AZ hospitals asked Ducey allow yesterday. Leave US politicize pandemic. That's good question. first started introducing easier tests shorter turnaround time provide result, lot widespread reporting worrying effectiveness tests. However, South Korea used one types tests essentially cheek swab results 15 30 minutes. know whether using tests. Objectively, across data South Korea, one would conclude they're testing really effective, include easier tests faster results. check CDC FDA answer essentially seems stage pandemic US, difficult gauge effectiveness particular test.

I wish better answers you, that's able find.  It‚Äôs deaths either... there‚Äôs lasting harm disabilities come people disabled rest lives. Ok, face dick handing out? count.  ""Lockdown II: Nothing"" movie living in.  That's universities refusing cut tuition. Universities need right thing slash tuition prices they're going bullshit online learning Can‚Äôt rest easy infected southerners invade. Politicians listen Scientists Doctors tell people listen them? going lose biggly

D√©j√† hope works (hopefully age) threesome partners. Dating tough know say- three‚Äôs crowd.  Nope. even tried al fresco dining. get take-out pizza week thats far go. Please keep indoor dining &amp; activities closed (especially summer possible!). 1) overweight risk overweight person.
2) wearing mask puts everyone else risk. Aside n95 masks, give minimal protection wearer. mainly prevent spread infected (and unknowing) carriers people.
3) loosing weight easy slipping mask, would pressuring people weight related issues issues worsened obesity put huge strain medical system America. since generals Doctors Scientists want ppe, ventilators gloves ignored them.

He wanted beg lives, governors didn't. truly crass man. said behind polls. Minnesota NYC havent seen increase either ground 0 1 protests. pretty obvious point protests cause spike. Man boobs double chins oh mods keep adding new words filter every week good news NY. suffered greatly height viruses attack state. think Cuomo excellent job strong presence throughout mayhem. Also, want taken seriously wartime president, important spectacularly underestimate enemy, downplay enemy's destructive power point start telling us always thought reopening good idea like tell us never invading Iraq.

And much worse team sports. Even hockey enforcers code ethics. death surge says non-expert I‚Äôm near New Albany. like here. It‚Äôs like New York ‚Äúending it‚Äôs lockdown‚Äù assload restrictions still place. Also gyms, theatres, casinos bunch things still remain closed anyone bought yet ? I‚Äôm little skeptical curious I‚Äôve seen god damn pitbulls. Self righteous assholes worst. Drunk Florida man without access beach holiday weekend going make amazing Monday morning news!!! long healthcare workers tire taking care people refuse lose stupid? knock people make pathogens political? Plus, *y'all wear fucking masks.*

If Chinese ~~Joe Sixpack~~ Êó†ÂêçÊ∞è tried ""I woke free country morning"" confronted wearing mask they'd whatever Chinese word gulag quicker could sneeze them.

It even taken draconian measures US keep becoming **disaster.** People wear masks. even people wear chin, uncover nose, etc. would could, family recently moved state go school haven‚Äôt asked reconfirm address. take break whatsoever, I‚Äôll reconfirm state residency, obviously can‚Äôt do, take $30,000 spike tuition, top losing scholarships. sucks, can‚Äôt learn online person smart either. go tell visited hospital without mask on. Okay, take downvote. 

Brian‚Äôs cant pull high road pull high road. makes look... odd. 

Its clear virtue signaling want feel important. tell Ben Shapiro dismantling semantics technicalities rather overall truth. 

Does really matter call government funded lab? matter funding comes from? ü§î  hope start giving pay rises, retirement funds, maaaybe ad campaigns encouraging respect nurses treating like scum doctors. inform must wear one order counter, need use online ordering system pickup order outside Yeah still need careful doctors scientists listen to. Annoyingly hard sure ones least knowledge subject area.

Coincidentally, answer question 'when ever going need stuff?'. TMC 72% non COVID patients hit capacity Wear masks. Wash/sanitize hands. Socially distance. 

This needs massively promoted nationally. PSA campaign. Fight virus! Save America! part!!

Until it‚Äôs Us vs Them. Dem vs repub. old vs young. Young vs old. City vs county vs state. Well darn. Easier said done. Political backed research prevalent potentially even dangerous corporate money politics (Altho case, two go hand hand.)

It‚Äôs easier people told believe scientists doctors making claims mercy funding years. 

Never forget long ago big tobacco plenty scientists doctors claiming smoking cigarettes health benefits.

This product systematic issues way business society. That's ny state well. Cause they're (mostly) smart enough wear masks. Utterly deplorable. zero reason happened. predictable, predicted. morons, best people field.

If country believed principles says would gallows built. Basically. listening medical professionals scientists politicians.

Until medical professionals scientists waded politics said mass gathering protests OK. Hating another country won‚Äôt US good. I'm right edge city (Buffalo) favorite story share cpl weeks ago. standing line store guy front getting close people checking asked pls step back floor markers. 

Guy like ""o shit bad. "" Steps back loudly proclaims store ""You know though? think whole thing hoax! (Paraphrasing now) yeah, worries I'll follow rules I'm here"" went cite protests, going long point why. hey, dude stillwore mask cordial store employee talked him. take long time concern. China lot people vaccinate. Doctors don‚Äôt realize many America see enemy guest. Start discourse watch circles end in. they'll disappear reappear another thread stating exact contentions refuted. r/politics hospital exceed 100% usage resources. difficult concept understand. 

The difference people US receiving bills hundreds thousands dollars. Please tell physicist obtained better job? degreeless always beating degree. going pursue one tho' given job already pays stupid money wont make w degree. crazy true. thank Uncle Sam pay grades. still would nice degree would taken seriously ""but god dont even degree!"" CanNOT wait! Yup.

This 2nd time fucked disease outbreak.

He get 3rd chance that, imo good, time travel make orange baby chief say 4 months ago. Unethical life tip: fuck job, scapegoat young people. wasn‚Äôt replying you. replying guy said mask wearing bunch hooey. yelling Like what? Genuinely curious. ultimate irony Maybe people stop thinking travel bans racist now.  Oxford team saying looks good end October. know something don't? fellow American, agree. virus unrealistic Smart. Americans part selfish pieces shit. America spiking parts couldn‚Äôt stay fuck away bars. Guess turds!? They‚Äôre closing again. Soon enough they‚Äôll probably impose stay home orders again. 200$.... Ha it'll low.. Id buy bargain day. ~~almost~~ literally worst imaginable person charge. It‚Äôs nightmare. 

FTFY. Hey! Texas governor already *used* excuse! original! true, expected cases would dropping 3 months, making new daily high. i‚Äôm saying nurse won‚Äôt feel like hero, i‚Äôd pretty angry people opposing guidelines. Rednecks taking polls issue keep afloat can't never open go insolvent ever make profit reopening.

Either ask congress bail kind businesses (and disproportionately affected businesses) out, let die write off. they're causes public health disaster put businesses wanted save permanently anyways. high fever Flu, years ago. never forget fucking hallucinations. terrifying like endless loop. never going vote him, genuinely rooting well thing started. Or, rather, clear thing start, pretty much came gate shot us collectively foot.

Much knew would helped chances November, unimportant next handling health crisis successfully. oh well. Texas opening early ploy get people unemployment. State player games fund years even decade almost mass layoffs going run funds weeks. another scandal itself. 

Also Abbott moron. Look Jade Helm. folks caters too. Love y'all! get shit together I'd love see Scotland someday. never left nervous system come back worse, like chicken pox/shingles. Well let‚Äôs hope anti vaxxers decide take Lol what? governors going go political ads future intercut dated graphs wild spikes murderous lies leadership hawking time? going leave fucking country? way doesnt follow them. see ten hour ken burns doc now; failures laid bare world. missing something? I'm pretty sure wants stay avoid jail elect supreme justices. Thank saving night new inspiration. Fucking tankie Yeah man get it. reply weird context. offering solidarity someone overseas already done told wear mask. 

Good info tho.  much practical get drunk home well, pass put allredy home save going home hassle. angle, curious. couple small businesses various industries. Mostly graphic design, marketing, kind engineering life safety, sysadmin side enough make shit work. 

I feel like debating you. already know real, believe makes feel superior. mean nicest way. They‚Äôre ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù like driving speed limit mandatory. live downtown Miami 50% people park go wear them. enforcement. Saw four cops congregated park today weren‚Äôt even wearing them. ten cop cars park single person stopped wearing mask. long expect people wait though? Smh. Thank post. reasonable take hope everybody could get behind. knows works, thing months guessing upset getting treatment, Arkansas voters are, show KnOwS RiGhtS! Greta gonna snap... quite easy enforce establishment. Post rules outside, whomever comply served told leave. shame posting picture 86ing good.

Damn people Florida can't even follow one way aisles supermarkets. I've pointed ppl I've told go fuck myself, care, know, mind business.... 

I drove restaurants downtown Cape Coral weekend since bars closed restaurants packed ppl spilling onto sidewalks, masks, social distancing... 35,000 new cases week Florida wait 30 days death rate catch up. 

Wish us luck Florida desperately need new Government officials hope Canada swear god can‚Äôt handle American Parasites Except lot elderly immunsupressed people can't get vaccines feel like outside chances transmission got super low. Imagine lighting fire living room vs park. open air dissipates smoke immediately. don‚Äôt wear one outside unless come close others, like within feet. But, I‚Äôm lucky, live area plenty open space. Pretty sure it'll get extended, though. horrible realize power know things, still continue opposite

how sleep night/???? obligated anyone. Definitely coronavirus concerned. LIES political manipulations covid-19, contradictory information, et all. take order wear facemask &amp; shove sun shine.

I pretty good math &amp; using numbers given media, lie exposed. LA county 10.7 million people, 150,000 people tested possitive coronavirus, math, tell chance could infected. then, refer last sentence previous paragraph. course did. lie thru teeth. Unfortunately, think type people trust politicians' input science going deterred telling to. Well that‚Äôs choice. Slippery slope start allowing government imprison without due process. idiot? sarcastic? America country, continent Divide conquer. like losing votes statement Definitely. dude r/worldnews tryna tell Texas better Canada, argument age well. Yeah? When's last time saw patient? gotta dig history business details. He's tied lot profiteering whole thing. Take note names see ever decide actually look past. degree mean he's practicing. Doctors wrong time, especially large sums money involved. Fkin A.. need laws like we‚Äôre seeing surge it‚Äôs people grouping up? Fit R'nt Us? Americans want get angry one places actually letting (The Bahamas, much disagreement) requiring negative COVID test travel demand follow country protocols masks social distancing carry fines and/or imprisonment followed. least still enter country (even though, citizen, I‚Äôd much prefer stay country little longer).

Can‚Äôt go Europe Canada wanna complain Caribbean countries trying protect themselves. Still learning though, they? case copy marriage certificate. kids came I‚Äôd copy birth certificate listing French citizen mother mother. American, brought hopefully learn this. *Crosses fingers* Doctors say it‚Äôs late. Anyone really going trust China this? So, we're ""abstinence-only education actually works, need get message out"" phase. Equally shitty results come. Bars still closed here. open tomorrow. ****Facepalm****:-(  Fire person, totally missed window weeks ago #He‚Äôs going lose BIGLY folks. Believe me.  That's roll.

I work hospital.

If one symptoms denote emergent issue, one routinely images you. one checking labs see creatine levels indicate kidney failure. extremely difficult determine heart experiencing inflammatory disease we're seeing asymptomatic children.

We study cases. long time, almost one did.

Now, we're starting examine follow mild asymptomatic cases we're seeing disease processes: heart damage, lung damage, kidney damage, blood pressure issues, clotting issues, neurological issues, brain issues.

We know infrequent frequent although several every high quality study know prevalence high enough repeatedly documented anyone looking.

We know strain specific exactly causes it.

Do want know know this? Disease progression. Asymptomatic mild cases go family doctors order tests. get headlines like, ""Lung disease discovered asymptomatic patients.""

Hospitals almost never catch patients sick enough warrant admission beginning. may take months start feeling symptomatic. symptomatic COVID-19 symptomatic whatever disease progression may experiencing.

A severe headache, racing heart, frequent urination. Whatever.

We know there's thing asymptomatic case virus effect pandemic, assumed asymptomatic cases without complications. cannot see we're looking for.

A tank simply even going try fight drone, that's job. like drone can't jack squat another aircraft, interceptor aircraft can't anything tank. like rock paper scissors.

The reality tank field got support form dedicate anti-air escorts ruin drone's day long chance fire tank. I'd certainly take 10 LAV-AD's, essentially anti-drone tank, drones.

Even subtract 1,700 covid deaths, still 2,000 excess pneumonia deaths, doubles reported number covid deaths.

This whole thing complicated.  context, population Hebei 75MM. Beijing 20MM. read article? Examples? source claims? Thailand - counting deaths pneumonia rather covid...until officials realized farce unsustainable. shut whole country down. think: Florida‚Äôs officials taking page third world country‚Äôs playbook. sad, especially retirees willing sacrifice. We‚Äôll wait see long continue charade. ""Bert frrdom!""
-Americans probably. wear face shield well mask N95. muchnexposure unmasked customers puts great risk. 
Or--set plexiglass barrier entrance. Every EU country lock rules. federal countries like Germany, every state rules. states moronic people follow rules. even read article? side effect virus especially true Modi. Far many blind believers India either incapable want question supreme leader. dental appointment Thursday question. Wtf Wear like badge honor. Gee. Remember empty streets ???? cite anything president said would lead people believe virus hoax? seen evidence would certainly like highlight true. disturbing might actually qualify. ton loopholes. mean ""born little late""? Meaning, born became American citizen? still qualify. great grandmother American? was, married April 21, 1983 automatically became Italian citizen upon marriage... Italian citizenship survived loss via naturalization ;-) could, theory, pass kids without even realizing. might fall 1948 rule stuff. please expand upon seriously may still qualify. seems sensible. 

Just like setting example wearing mask. saying ""See mask? Wear one yourself"" What! travel ban! Noooooo!!!!! That‚Äôs racist!!!!!!!!!!! thats true another level tracking masks perfect slogans match #MAGA Coming someone lives NYC area, saw clubs / indoor outdoor restaurants opened last night packed. one person wearing mask! 300 people. Yeah, media telling nothing flu late January/February. it‚Äôs apparently deadly disease everyone die catch it. :( Genuine question - go credible information virus?

Here already. thoughts :

at home,someone sick spreading family

also, wear sometimes. heard colleges plan dealing either. 

You would think plans made publicised. maybe I'm loop. hope assuming virus problem gone fall obviously happening. Same. nuclear family fully vaccinated per ages. I'd consider vaccine quickly 10m, I'll giving children data available. (the children) masks though, sure social distance long necessary.

I like vaccines/science. also like kids alive. Yes is. free chose gun, not. free say want, not. free press, not. ... Choices without consequences. Giving choice consequence freedom. Hey funny, Mexico rightist plot damage lider! bizarre pathetic hill die on. don‚Äôt like political. seems US even made believing basic science political. point give up, I‚Äôll political. severity existence virus fact.

Fortunately country major political parties still listening experts none advocating masks testing.

I also don‚Äôt think mask wearing really limits much. They‚Äôre annoying sure, it‚Äôs small price pay reduce spread suffering. Got link good ones? gonna fly august that's happening anymore. think gist can't call second wave virus never really went away. talking another spike. actually happen, meme. Also, ask, ‚Äúin last fourteen days contact anyone covid?‚Äù. It‚Äôs like : ‚Äúwell don‚Äôt really know, literally everyone exposed office today could covid?‚Äù yea, no, perhaps? able help, wait asked

That really moving Dont worry. Europes borders Open. get flight free enter. police wont Stop anyone. little worse flu, haven‚Äôt noticed now. 8-12h. vissible exhausted end first peak. Currently flattened Belgium doesnt see covid people anymore.  satire right?

Ever heard ""too little late""?
Most people refuse wear mask arent paying attention anymore Pence. entire nations attention least couple months. health officials globe telling necessary. opportunity prioritize mask production. screwed up. point youre rubbing faces failure acting like forgot. would go mask 6 month old little guy I'm protective think going him. i'm looking forward Trump's reply Maybe it‚Äôs time spread freedoms Europeans ?? Ugh I'm exact situation. ticket go Europe April bought January. hoping go see girlfriend summer idea can. May, Florida's excess mortality numbers line reported. proud governor forced nursing homes accept covid positive patients? deaths followed result?  Good luck pull nato. fun fighting Russia. think humanoira would like humanities, focuses cultures evolution society. 

But yes, apparently need president failed gameshows, bad tan balls court overtly racist people still stewing 8 years black dude good job. one realizes it‚Äôs every country page. People within US can‚Äôt even unanimously agree take virus seriously SOMEBODY. thought Trump blame states shutting requiring masks? places weak federal responses also poorly like Germany.. Oh wait Thank kind words. Unfortunately, lot people US cant grasp gravity situation slowing progress significantly. people see situation clearly, becoming nightmare. See 2nd highest population state 29 million, Florida 3rd 21.5 million. Distribution likely months long process. would hate person people deciding gets vaccinated first.  Americans NYC, north east actually, listened pretty quickly. NYC essentially shit March 12th. Unfortunately southernors southernors. 

There Wuhan level quarantines. North East CA 90%+ mask usage keep offices closed. bounce .7 1.1 Rt see vaccine. Daily deaths relatively low, dozen day 80 day NY.

Florida, Texas, New Mexico like low mask adoption weak social distancing. going spike. real quarantine prolonged shutdown. Politicians residents would prefer large numbers deaths that.

We see 220k 400k dead, hope vaccine comes end year. could ban Canada over. bill rights inherently choices, statements. something betray bill rights, ie creating law goes principals, choice consequences whoever that.

But keep living bubble consequence free choices. Goodnight. narcissist world better place This. need everywhere unfortunately (fortunately normally) laws place preventing it. Outdoors seems low risk, maybe pumpkin patches ok!  Hopefully ends case. Like mask mask anything? Wearing bandana bad mask helps nothing pretty much let's breathe freely. think American passport strongest point time. American here, country take surplus idiot population? saw [this think channel linked [from another would seem top, except comments nurses made think probably accurately described like. Made careful, Iƒ∫l tell ya! god damned embarrassing American. tired stupid country. Pog need check consulate example czech Republic requires 2 documents. Residency card school/work document. Ok, since adding antibody tests working key metrics....here's happened....but know like half percent easy math voodoo.... wonder percentage people get neurological problems is. interesting study. uneducated memory, thought neurological symptoms flu occurred extreme cases? covid 19, seems much common? I'd interested seeing studies come out. Trump businessman way Bill Shatner spaceman. guess so. also helps old people, apparently disposable, bulk strongly affected. Oh well, seek immunity get vaccine. want run gauntlet don‚Äôt expect society isolate choice made. 

We re-open, may get sick may die. ultimately it‚Äôs fault. Native American, please kill disease. think used get coffee Wow, wish would happen Australia... (ie: Everybody WEARING mask cussing anyone else isn't.)

""And news today, pig seen flying sky..."" established R0 virus environment mitigations least 2.5-3.0.  Florida 2.0, cant say they're nothing mitigate it. They're enough, they've proven mitigate reasonable assume mitigate virus spreads like every single population ever dealing outbreak recorded history done.

It's going lot worse been, going run unchecked rampage half year. Kid Rock fans /s I've seen lately. Interesting people actually Bravo giving fuck.  I'm sorry experience that. Nothing like keeping us waiting metering coming back not. Reminds good ol' days charged per character text. I'm happy see reality impending disaster finally dawning White House I'm frustrated took long get message out. infection rate going climb time people start following rules. guess populism going popular even dumb. get lot 'our problems due foreigners let's sock them'. 'this covid stuff way overhyped, let's ignore it'. policies flaws. Thats cool Yang right leaning dont know even call donald trump anymore lol. Worse Hitler? yeah exactly, China that's well. gonna question China also gonna question Japan, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea? I‚Äôm getting really sick repeating fact benefits need outweigh risks order justify using medication particular purpose. 


Do people die taking HCQ? Absolutely. Cardiac episodes (particularity LQTS, prolongation particular part heart rhythm cause significant enough disruptions normal rhythm trigger cardiac arrest) happening many years.


As trials, I‚Äôm sure can‚Äôt use google yourself, several. first two ones first hand knowledge (started strong, recruitment sharply decreasing people dropped trial information available) basically flopped. Although they‚Äôre still technically ‚Äúactive‚Äù, chances useable information coming forth great since whole point large scale study US put issue mother, father grandparents liberals. One grandparents grew old plantation deep south. ex-slaves still living old slave shacks. Somehow turned liberal. Maybe cause saw close.

Me changed much all. anything think sometimes government needs decide throw weight around. pandemic prime example. they're generally going well. I'm British Chinese Dad flew back China shit starting get bad improving China. also half american half Chinese friends living there. they're Shanghai dad going business trips quite regularly many social distancing measures outside places lock proper track trace system.

to able go places need green light code phone. privacy considerations relation topic another day terms effectiveness combating Covid would say China done relatively well especially consider population 5 times US.

no matter much people want dispute reported numbers, I'm seeing UK US numbers UK almost 20,000 excess deaths period March May. video doesnt wear mask. Way hit home message rules thee me. lived England 1994 1996 (as newborn baby) don‚Äôt want blood? 

Well that‚Äôs mean. guess time CDC Fauchi to, again, tell Americans masks work healthcare industry stock again. That's small town china. Mexico - 203k total cases adding 4k-5k cases per day

Canada -103k total cases adding around 200 cases per day

USA - 2.6m cases adding 40k cases per day last week.

It seems like Mexico Canada virus relatively control compared US. saying Mexico Canada ban travel into/out US enforce stricter border control? Would allowed wear 3M P95 N100? Go back time several years organize execute clandestine effort dismantle American conservative media. deeply concerned I‚Äôm hoping someone able help understand I‚Äôm ask. March, primary headlines especially places like Italy number COVID-19 deaths. isn‚Äôt case US? see days ridiculous increases number cases mention number deaths, case? look numbers comparatively lower peak saw Europe, curious see anyone shares sentiment. america perhaps. I've never dry (though actually can't remember last time alcohol - probably within last week).

However, exciting life years, many friends did. awkward mention alcohol, everyone time, know this.

To me, like someone saying peanut allergy. Thanks letting know, I'll make sure peanuts around. see allergy judgement eating peanuts.

(I'm basically quoting good friend here, whole injury/opioid prescription/doctor shopping dealers/quit everything yet would always good beer parties would never drink. said, ""I even think problem drinking,"" said, ""By end, alcohol glue holding whole thing together."" Luckily, caught really bottomed out, friends figured Problem ""a lot partying"".) Well UK listening ""scientific evidence"" prepared entire February, decided go Herd Immunity. Luckily, real scientists Imperial College (I little faith government's scientific advisors) able turn around weekend government able listen.  leader responsibility alone..no use citizen didnt follow guideline keep bitching fighting something useless last heard armchair general discussion US military longer pursuing MBT(such Abrams) near future wars multipurpose vehicle serve multiple platform loadout APC, IFV, Anti-Air, Command Tank, Tank Destroyer, Engineering Tank etc. additional armor added depending mission. Even people reddit said ""I think I'd need mask needed pop grocery store way home"". Uh, cool, that's exactly need mask. imagine particular way grocery trip fits *your* day bearing whether mask required public indoor activity??? Yeah, seemed like PR talk actual details INO-4800 vaccine 

Thanks describing, nonetheless UV helps destroying particles Vitamin production.

Being outside instead inside helps spreading virus.

Vitamin plays role immune system.

According Worldometer 10% people (200.000 tests per 1M inhabitants) tested New York Florida.

As opposed people coming Hospitals March, that.

Hurricane season influence, folk Louisiana Texas tell rescued resort shelters science fiction. Meanwhile, 40k+ new cases USA we're finally getting around VP saying ""Well, maybe people wear mask."" read story government choosing invest machines could produce 1 million masks week. 

It end June right now. shortage masks point poor planning idiocy. Many. Especially often criticised ""technocratic"". think Angela Merkel might good example.

Don't confuse ""populist"" ""trying popular"". Wanna hear something scary? 

Next weekend 4th July. also shilled Yang politics lot. didnt use vulgar language wrote lot pro-Yang comments got 15 days ban it.

You self-aware, right? someone else pointed probably temp-banned spamming. I‚Äôd love reply every ‚Äúcentrist‚Äù right-leaning comment see here, 1. don‚Äôt personally time, 2. would totally expect harassed comment spamming did. give ear notions may hidden favouritism moderation, expect proper moderation give space people don‚Äôt time comment 24/7, default subs would become ten people shouting other. supposed sing choir mask on? Yeah it‚Äôs like world best scientists worked / tested / deemed safe / scrunitised peers it‚Äôs made available you...

Much better sceptical without real foundation catch / spread / perhaps die virus said ‚Äòrushes‚Äô vaccine would likely prevent.

Muppet.  OP - username üòÇ CoROnazviRuS eXisteD LOL jesus christ reading comments trying say anything said this. Asians look led believe do. brain gives trying differentiate them. Trust even lived Asia would say shit even though everyone else see difference. Maybe lied us much, Dr. Fauci, we'd trust bit vaccine. Send DM link well. Thanks advance!  wire biased fuck, comment India. think another person would done better. probably zombie outbreak happened america. There's lot jobs risks far, far, far outweigh rewards. job puts contact hundreds thousands people day. think he's going military behind him. Hard junta without it. No, real populists, actual sense word. parts internet misinterpreted populism means turned something inherently positive. something positive. idiots too, mostly American. Nah I'm joking Dutch. live 1 thousand people mask. That's crowded here. bigger cities here, masks see be. really understood u ment bottom. mostly agree beter stay home outside inde people. That's importance good air ventilation/ circulatie. something 'the wire' still qualify news? make permanent? There's regulators outside US reviewing vaccines. agree political interference may issue administration, vaccine approved advanced regulators (EU, Japan, Australia etc.) assured properly tested. finally, glad see people sub coming around able praise certain actions countries even governments generally appalling. USA world's Florida. Pence, urges Americans wear masks...... This! Erie County one first western counties PA locked down. thankfully bad here, unfortunately numbers steady instead decreasing. anti vaxxers don‚Äôt want immunize let die. cares herd immunity point. Natural selection thing morons wipe out. fact reaching herd immunity long run.  Lol think Asia accurate numbers mistaken, especially china like 90% reopened. number daily deaths dropping steadily last month continues someone say F R R N??? Lol said mask overrated took Netherlands social distancing examples. joke. from, Amsterdam? Well I'm Hong Kong, small population 8 millions stuck area smaller Amsterdam, ranking us 2nd dense city world. Guess what, 1000 cases, 6 deaths. 

Wear fucking mask. point covid positive spreading virus two weeks even symptom all. many people one person infect two weeks? Aaaaand then, many infect within two weeks exposure? Literally tens thousands, mathmetician could probably give closer numbers. TSA agent local airport infected? many could infect? mailman? grocery clerk? One cook restaurant get ""touchless delivery"" from? numbers staggering try figure them. contaminated person infected one daily numbers would staggering 14 day period. Nah nah got wrong, didn‚Äôt steal manufacturing, executives handed silver platter. key ""the electorate"" means electorate, 'base'... 'wear mask', said, without wearing mask. we've seen last four years, *way things supposed work* gone crap, cares move numbers one ledger different ledger? Yes. rights rights family? want unvaccinated people mixing us potentially threatening family - particularly vaccines given 100% protection.

Do bit community part it. intended proprietary vaccine company development.

Tsunami suddenly EVERYWHERE! bans people simply speaking narrative

Ah, like every partisan subreddit website? Yeah, think? want say ""it's f'ing time"". Unfortunately, way past point.... IIRC both. Herd immunity means enough people immune, either vaccine getting virus can't spread anymore. carefully omit certain words use @lternate way wr1ting them. yes minefield. don‚Äôt think knows vacuum tubes are.

This also false, though already spent months researching it. Suggest Read oxford vaccine. new, updated. Im talking ina terrible state economically direct result C19.

Good bot Start social media campaign #iwearamask get celebrities, athletes politicians support it. like everyone blacked social media weeks ago. Corona closes hoax. Especially since CDC even thinks 90% cases go undetected. words, Corona harmless 90% infected people even notice infection.

The moment real scientists time, results show seriousness current Corona mutation limited healthy person. story different person kind health condition. already obvious data arriving China. finally proven data Italy.

What world do?

Wasted resources general lock-downs instead protecting vulnerable part population.

Only two things could added since Corona outbreak Italy. USA shown 40% population could vulnerable overweight people added list. Peru finally showed lock-downs pointless.

Sweden lock-downs made one mistake. isolated elderly. obvious isolation could led aa similar number fatalities done reason.  know international travel significantly reduced, Coronavirus strains split continental strains.

Delhi n Mumbai two places India. much Delhi n Mumbai govts absolutely failed BJP considering stopped testing pretty much completely states like Gujarat optics even though death rate Gujarat concerning. 

I'll paint picture ignorant nincompoops 

West Bengal 4000 tests Gujarat 80k tests conducted. due idiocy govt WB fudged numbers hid deaths. brought light center good WB actually started testing tackling issues hand instead avoiding them. 

Currently stands 363k Gujarat vs 468k WB. Weird ? suddenly specific states certain party helm adopted policy WB govt done initially play optics . 

Ignorant people buy propaganda reason country never actually go anywhere always full idiots puff chests false idea patriotism. say I'm surprised well mask mandate AZ worked.

Went seeing maybe 70-80% people wearing masks grocery store 95-100%, 50-60% stores 80-90%. It‚Äôs like people think Cuomo should‚Äôve making tests himself. solely role haven‚Äôt seen yet, it‚Äôs pretty depiction little knew early due inadequate preparation. rooting vaccine initiatives, race, china first, what, fails, appreciated initiative. goes Moderna Oxford. even results good, deep respect scientists done effort.

This stance take. guy LA‚Äôs Sometimes agree sentiment times don't. 

Sometimes agree, takes much effort resources engage fucking exhausting. 

On agree, because, think like cult, would seek rescue people it. extremely damaging dangerous them, people know society live left alone fester away hate-cult. get lone-wolve terrorists etc. Rt.live estimates Florida's current R 1.4.

Anything means exponential growth unsustainable. value 1.4 means every infected infects 1.4 persons. Considering incubation likely infectious time 1-2 weeks, lets take 10 days. 1.4*1.4=1.96 means takes two periods numbers doubling i.e. 20 days. 

A factor 1.4 scary. running longer also expensive. undo period r=1.4 one would need roughly period r=0.7 incredibly hard. able get r=0.85 significant limitations discipline. means every week going take least two weeks get - minimum. It‚Äôs Fox News echo chamber regularly bans people simply speaking narrative, evidenced commenters here. that‚Äôs thing great, fun glad you‚Äôve got safe space. Personally there‚Äôs nothing want anything Life sneaks quick, huh? Likewise Boris Johnson belong list Trump Bolsonaro. Two actively working containment virus two trying prevent spread, varying levels success.

I dislike Boris think delayed response resulted cases they're relaxing quarantine measures early, first hand experience disease trying. belong list two. live alternate reality, constructed selective media consumption online offline echo chambers reinforce worldview.

Especially people big critical thinking particularly well educated easily get sucked echo chambers telling smart rightfully opposing science / logical thinking / government rules.

And everywhere. Netherlands crazies suing state end social distancing too. Internet nasty side effect making finding echo chambers far easy. states always authority, merely delegated Federal gov post civil war. US Federal government weak prior 1860s Fucking finally. hard. fucks sake *Too ignorant capitalistic health care New York same. told great healthcare system isn‚Äôt solely determined much little money throw it? also political possibilities outside far left far right become synonymous liberal conservative.

Maybe bit travelling talk native Chinese might better idea. No. shut 3 months boat US form cyclical shutdowns year. even close comparable Part problem also doctors refusing test anybody without severe symptoms. Politicians healthcare officials generally done terrible job educating public threat. Everyone wear masks symptoms illness like plenty Asian countries.

Some right wing leaders west even believe Global Warming comparing modi them, appeal international audience bad.

Only thing like modi government included marginalized muslim communities CAB. YouTube kooks lot answer for. Perfect example sure downvoted, simply wanted primary source read. Tampa, fuck Orlando Jacksonville See that's point. Chinese govt extremely protective military. people. little strange giving military first. especially considering fact strengthening military placements land among borders sea. gym go takes temp every time come in. daughters dance school back session weeks take temps well. Saw this, thank god second passport, saw banned list... shit, what‚Äôs odds. Two two! history vaccines, none rushed year. typically take least 5-10 years develop fully test.

The Oxford vaccine started development around 5 years ago entered human trials around 2 years ago.

Here one human trials: really rushed scheme things, originally MERS vaccine (another Corona virus) allowed easily modified target COVID19 - similar Flu vaccinations shuffled around year depending strains expected circulating. bozos inject anything point Yes, are. PPP loan extra $600 ends July 25th. governers start shutting we're fucked. *If* going crowd, want beach rather pub. Yea restaurant (except to-go)
In opinion, bar restaurant basically True, that's name aussie, call Aussie often mate, well Aus, Oz, West Island, Across Ditch, Land Underarm Bowlers. start boss?  ah yes let's get vaccine people said masks work I'd keep expectations pretty low. happens United States started shit. Florida also lot old people large communities. Expect see large spikes become infected. *Doubt terrible news love Trump. systematically wasted decades good diplomatic credit take years (if ever) recover from.

For love great news. free loading foreigners finally pay way still ripping great country.

Nothing changes. Sigh.  hamster lungs (old girlfriend gave one) I'm going around people N95 nothing. get shit I'll ventilator immediately. 

That said, I've missed two days work year office allow anyone past door. honestly surprising all- US leader much source fear outwards inward long time. Recent shortcomings part addressable reasons come say ""Hey, I'm sure leaders other-side pond looked to."" COVID-19, China transparent.

it shared gene sequence early, provided information daily, transparently shared diagnose principle.

almost every epidemiologist visited China, looked data provided, worked them, positive towards China's effort.

it's just...later got labeled ""bought CCP"".

remember media/politicians/people accused WHO? Yea sure mentioning every comment us obnoxious. necessary point making  Yeahhhh everyone older 16 still parents insurance got check parents got check either. 24 year old full-time employee here; check. still '10 cases, zero soon!' true believers wild?

Yikes.  Aside fact numbers completely incorrect unless believe deaths labeled pneumonia statistical norms (they‚Äôre aren‚Äôt even close). 

The U.S. medium lockdown still we‚Äôre dealing obscene amount deaths. nothing happened hospitals would overwhelmed deaths rates would skyrocketed. maybe die get really super sick get mild case long term damage internal organs.  compared populace New York City many people live there. believe somewhere range 3-4 million?

17.5K remembering quite low, especially considering dead start pandemic little data treat prevent virus. trying make people aware. need criticize. makes sense keep mind likely infected probably got tested first cases. 10k infected 90% show symptoms willingly go get tested, get 9k positives system testing 12k ""high risk"" people versus 9k + n blanket large-scale testing, n number 0 1k.

Obviously real numbers exaggerated show point, wanted show could lot complicated simply saying ""well testing people now.""  Constitution seem yours. sort law pretty firmly court states. Sure FAA regulate masks airplanes, someone Federal government things fall Commerce clause.

Also sub: upvoted post Bingo! Ok sure. harsh lockdowns extended period time that‚Äôs also cost life. It‚Äôs zero side effect measure. you‚Äôll balance consequences.

Add retort fact people survive infection, continue neurological physical symptoms likely *forever*. Things getting better protests Life bitch honey. possible president fire Vice President?

Legitimately asking. 

Can president time opt get new Vice President? Also, news said May we'd see 3k day deaths early June. Day 20 row 1k. Also dont forget cleaner air currently have. breathed easily years years. I'm also asthmatic. also missed fact Italy already reporting single digit deaths. US rise likely pass Italy. countries eat big shit sandwiches mean OK US eat one, too. comparing US failures, comparing successes. checked Sweden's death numbers lately? know like 7 states never locked down. We'll never see deaths like ny again. agree 100%, except lot respect Fauci he‚Äôs probably paying attention everyone else right now. He‚Äôs technically wrong per say said ‚Äúat rate, everyone‚Äôs going get end next year anyway‚Äù headline would everywhere cause panic. happens leaderless counties see. That's great explanation. Thanks. Post world war 2 coalition western countries led America acted concert Soviet Union like India China sat sidelines ""the nonaligned"". world live America, Europe China economic superpowers everybody else nonaligned. sad decline America. stop people going hotspots bringing back home. also unfounded way denying sick leave. virus everywhere picked anywhere.

Kudos you, random internet stranger. I'd ask hold hand get jab. pathetic. breaks down? stated also require insurance. They're state's official watchlist, means cannot get disease control 3 days, bars close. 14 days, full shutdown.

2 week notice. course not, least vast majority not. also think majority super supportive US whole. general supposed pick ally among China, Russia, USA trifecta superpowers people would heavily lean US would rather shoot leg. Truth is, never heard epidemic overwhelming hospitals this. seasonal flu, swine flu, major outbreaks past century. 

Regardless ""harmless"" is, combination fast spread whatever rate severity resulted several countries -- including advanced economies best healthcare world -- brought knees.

The *population* stop infection. Japanese government practically nothing, alert populace mask wearing culture helped curb spread kept hospitals functioning. Saying virus harmless people blatantly overlooking dire situation healthcare services in. Completely false adjusted population Coronavirus aint match good 'ole US freedom! Quick question: affect 90 Day Fiance? ""Oh, revolutionary idea. Looks like administration bad after-all "" glad one takes bet . simple friend .the leaders Florida commit dumbest move history like new york leadership did. follow average age patients see crystal clear covid cases people 60 leads deaths .sadly possibly criminally new Yorkers, cases people 75 result huge numbers deaths .
No place Italy end making new yorks numbers like child play one dumb new yorks leaders. respects friend China.

I would think Russia China. Simply because, long ambiguous history Russia, like got rid Nazi invaded half Europe price. Provide us gaz time flying plane close border. Supporting military operation (Their giant Antonov plane) supporting different side on. Yes. ER doctor here... think need stop listening politicians together. Right medical field screams read this. Mhm. case see private healthcare much better unlimited resource /s.

In addition, hospitals Italy hit capacity, one left die halway. moving patients around hospitals country, decent number covid patients sent Germany treated.

Somehow, doubt USA hospitals would same. Im waiting vision Trump needle vaccine giving young child.. 

\*cringe\* could months Europe accepts American visitors. They're going pariahs. Considering affects brain aswell make lose natural respiration think insomnia added virus symptoms cases. Betting people dying seems like bad idea karma wise might get collapse basic governmental social function, least long enough destroy current status quo country

There's also part 2 event YouTube patients gonna get taken care thousands hospital employees sick?

You can't. Staff work best can, hospitals stop accepting patients, sick people travel hospital hospital hospital desperately looking help they're either admitted give up, people die simply sheer overwhelming number patients, staff traumatized make decisions make due lack medical supplies lack personnel. staff going traumatized years years, bunch going leave medicine entirely. there's emphasis overwhelming health care system, but, hey, least go beach get drunk bar /: late. Eat dick pence. US Trump. first time crazy president. One Crazy politician enough remove things like research done US, cultural weight Hollywood, military weight NATO on. 

We discuss whether Korean getting Oscar Trump threat stop funding NATO (which European perspective would good thing) sign US loosing influence. 

but whole Coronavirus crisis gives bad image US people seems land crazy Karen, add whole *Blame China, Blame WHO, Blame everybody US* make US government look bad, Russian/Chinese propaganda making look bigger is. It‚Äôs going next president Happy cake day! ""I've discriminated 5 times last two days wearing mask!!"" says harmless virus people. harmless even notice infection. measurements taken government help stop infection.

Apparently none enough.  gonna lie, Cult 45 makes yearn wrap lips around Colt 45 sometimes. period com wait til us Petro dollar world reserve currency collapses state governors decisions vary, actual power limited. individual decisions re-opening states commerce quite questionable. Available funds legal issues limit enforce. goes mayors individual cities. Now, comes citizens choices, that's goes back national leadership. Trump 100,000,000 followers. see president heavily downplayed virus, refuses wear mask, touts idiotic ineffective treatments, disregards medical scientific advisers, thinks testing reduced, politicizes situation...I go on. followers take que reason think act way. numbers actions enough continue spread virus. failed leadership core largest part blame situation. Good know. right-wing party Germany appeared bit confused. First supported closing borders that's platform anyway also, IIRC, supported shutdowns initially. remembered troll whatever ""establishment"" saying, joined freedumb rallies.   Smile tell asymptomatic carrier.

""Some may die, risk I'm willing take"" - Trump 2020 (probably) 

/s It'll hell hill climb fuck it, we're going let MAGA morons run us country without fight.   Astoria Saturday felt like giant block party... much Bourbon Street Vibe. social distancing, outside mask wearing... even see bars ID'ing anyone buying outside drinks def looked underage. actually never seen lively there. far wearing masks inside yet see one maskless person. Even bars restaurants open fully WAY see indoors. Outside seating only. think Air Condition one worse things this. I've seen local Apple Store area  Probably lack space hospitals wish preserve spaces higher chances survive. 

Now, could done sensibly. example, leave aside one nursing home COVID patients dedicated staf, shuffle patients home another one. Jesus Fucking Christ.

I'd assume US would strategically use 3 months lockdown stock supplies...  Wuhan lab made US scientist( Lieberman) espionage secret ( many talents ) program. FACTs DOJ website. Trump running pretty much ran businesses. It‚Äôs like skilled businessman. Yes. official advice buy much toilet rolls, productions material supplies affected, yet doesn‚Äôt stop hoarding. Imagine issued advise masks recommended can‚Äôt find shops. Btw people buying loads toilet rolls again. Medical tourism opened couple weeks ago Hate say told so........ No, everyone knows murder is, ignoring means suit narrative. opinion official agencies officials ‚Äúexperts‚Äù people like virus new made really stupid mistakes decisions along way. 
I view Faucci politician point lies view CDC used view pandemic.
People lie people also make mistakes 50-60 per day means community clusters remain undetected isolated. That's misleading. Reality is, we're going ""open close"" regardless effective lockdowns infections *will* raise open back up. We're open/close schedule there's vaccine. Covid: Come play guys. get start day 1.

This misleading.

Reality is, continue ""open close"" there's vaccine. we're lucky, come early 2021. opening/closing/opening/closing plan outlined first model. Wait real??

Details!? trusted ""world leadership"" first place?! Oh sweet innocence! 

Europeans: think looks bad outside, see inside mean take advice leader free world drink bleach? guess can't control kids neither? Paywall me, chance someone post article here? I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve wonderful life experiences respect anyone willing move new country, (most Americans don‚Äôt leave state born in) lack savings little US haven‚Äôt lived decade 4% tourism turnover Europe comes american tourists. Since Europeans mostly foregoing holidays continents year (either acting sensibly is, example, like USA, ban entry Europeans), absence Americans affect tourism. 
 
Since many countries restrictions number people beach, example, almost European destinations upper end capacity anyway. Except already 10x many people dead half year measures place average full year flu Uhh pretty sure trust detonated sometime around 2016 early 2017. Wish Democratic Primary canceled halfway through. Could great questions healthcare right now. perhaps that's canceled. Can't labor capital start thinking human beings. I'm keeping typo, heh.

Edit: I‚Äôve also never given medical advice don‚Äôt know comment even coming lol. calling fear mongering proving think overblown 

Believe what? virus real? course is. kind reporting purely agenda driven, leaves key facts, entirely designed instill panic reader giving little context possible? Absofuckinglutely.

I wear mask, social distance, I'm naive enough believe reporting without due diligence. increase cases TX low risk groups, probably result increased testing, no, I'm gonna let bias reporting fear-bait me. Wear mask, others gawk, laugh silently mask.  Housing still cheap. cash credit, able buy property 10 cents dollar. 

It happens regularly. Buying opportunities. rigged game. like stock market crashes. family member Arizona travels land visit relative Maine, one know then? hope ticket people. see plan following law. bf get tested learned one customers tested positive, works one-on-one physical therapist. Even though customer wearing masks, obviously necessary get tested case. tried almost week schedule appointment testing center closest/cheapest him. would $200. next cheapest $500.

The website claimed walk-ins okay showed midnight (the earliest could go found needed test) said website up-to-date would come back 8am schedule appointment *next* available day. showed 8am said totally full, he'd come back midnight. next two days kept saying max capacity, come next time, etc. shitshow.

Anyway, another coworker helped customer recently managed get appointment tested negative, 10 days since bf seen customer, boss approved come back work without one. impossible get test. mind blown. NY done everything could bring numbers down. problem stateS not. live small community lot tourists, downstate around world. also Snowbirds coming back up. Many small businesses already gone.  

When opened phase 4, went 9 cases 31 last week. I‚Äôm thinking Memorial Day people complacent. 31 number means probably many more.

 bars restaurants trying right, it‚Äôs people crowding venues opened. bars want money course, can‚Äôt keep everyone away other. 

I think Cuomo best keep everyone safe, covid raging highest number cases US right now. 

We billions corporations, military. need get this, making sure financial stability it. moneys there, need right now. :/ still guaranteed. I've done well without, retired 53. health issues. haven‚Äôt defeated first boss still reveals second form. Seems increases cases south still first wave me. also think, like cousin common cold, mutate time next wave fall. think vaccine forgone conclusion. also think know much long term effects virus. OK, enough doom gloom questions/thoughts simmering surface me. Somebody tell wrong please. True went got tested didn‚Äôt pay thing. might‚Äôve different insurance. 10:1 Google voice number 500? guess bonus nice, seem like enough. long worked there? That's fair assessment Gov.

Desirable death. uninsured people uninsured choice... approximately 8% population. yes, absolute hell. kids adapted well (assuming computer/wifi resources begin with) parents afford take help, struggle teach working home. 

Is bad hospitalized? No.

Is bad losing job? No.

But absolutely hell. 

To think on-line learning/school closings big deal people worse, I'd try make work deadlines teaching kids seen friends 4 months straight see fare.

They last week, let alone 4 months. yes, would call hell.

You say school closings necessary still admit despite valiant efforts educators, on-line learning failure - hell teachers, kids, parents alike. horrible swine influenza last year killed like half herd right SARSCoV2 appeared. 

You can't treat animals way get away it, breed super bugs. 

We entering new phase humanity many people exist want eat pork, keeps destroying everything have. H1N1 pandemic **we lucky** kill many people thought. 

China needs go low pork diet, country actually ask citizens that. God knows that's political suicide here.

Meanwhile reduced regulations raising slaughtering hogs here, sell China. We're taking burden possibly creating disease here! awesome money making opportunity, EXPENSIVE breed viruses! Fucking bullshit! give watch: 

It helps explain risk catching COVID. could lead desperate move? I'd willing bet they're major outbreaks military, recent major flooding also probably factor, military could move floods manage destroy country, they'd need new territory.

In grand scheme things that's nothing nearly everything back open, masks longer mandatory things looking (Numbers also slightly going again, expected. Contact tracing localized quarantine keeps check).

Plus course people infected went home. really Trump's fault went bar night certainly need tell bad idea. knew bad idea. need convince millions people need start acting best interests...that's much harder job convincing one solitary person act best interests entire country.

Why that?   Well.... collective bargaining governments insurance companies - mandated agencies - organized publicly regulated healthcare system. That‚Äôs Insulin costs fraction price Europe, compared US. relief realize problem overcome

At point?

(Assuming logistical issues, ofc) New York antibody test results actually said healthcare workers infected comparable lower rate average population.  masses still vote him. Undecided maybe not. put forth stronger candidate Biden would agree would Trump. Interestingly enough, believe emphatically Bush JR would handled pandemic grace competence current administration. 

My perception Bush Jr manipulated something useful idiot bad intel. 

Don‚Äôt get wrong, he‚Äôs far blameless made many disastrous decisions (Katrina notwithstanding), years past presidency I‚Äôve developed compassion towards various reasons. 

Please don‚Äôt misread though, bad president who‚Äôs failings created instability caused significant hardship home abroad. 1% cases scenarios?

Worse part, family owns construction business. never recovered, moved software development instead even I'm worried layoffs coming. Great, shut gyms again. Oh look... I'm 5% category.

Any young people want try kill me? I'm glad escaped horror rejected hate surrounded child. Many situations like I'm sure. honestly dont know anyone iam living germany believes trump good president. Ring around rosey... Fortunately can't repossess degree European love this. quicker pull away USA, better. Stonks go up, unless go top work way again. Right put money recession. Canadian provinces still require I'd like see data actual use.

Along way opportunists like Rush Limbaugh Rupert Murdoch saw money made amplified message conflated ‚Äúpatriotism‚Äù ‚ÄúJesus.‚Äù

But evangelicals promote narcissistic, wealth-worshipping, racist, basically sci-fi version Xtianity. bible prop them. Trump seems understand this.

So makes sense people give lip-service religion would politics. don‚Äôt actually believe teachings Jesus, tenets traditional conservatism. 

Just wealth, race, themselves, ‚Äútheir truth,‚Äù abject nonsense. Although get raptured won‚Äôt complain...

So are. everyone, people. Family emergency, essential work cannot done remote, forced relocation due job loss, etc... city corona free 2+ weeks people still wearing masks taking precautions. Wtf going US, numbers constantly climbing people thinking gone absolutely father daily crossword puzzle every day eventually heart disease caused stroke. Even body falling apart around him, stayed pretty sharp day. Oh God ... None happen. 

If asked anybody 6 months ago US president would ever suggest ingesting bleach, everybody would said would never happen.

Some things already happening. lot particularly likely, might still happen. disease start wet market, first super spreading event occurred. market happened wet market. represent serious health hazards pandemic risks. need done away with. There‚Äôs reason China can‚Äôt replace grocery stores.  Ugh, go Bradenton area see grandparents (who poor health) Friday parents I'm getting nervous, could provide insight expect region? see there. escaped lab Spain then? ü§îü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ""Serious academics..."" ""Pretty good science""

Strong claims need strong evidence. looks like false positive me. finding confirmed E, N1 N2. PCR kit Institut Pasteur. March 2019. nothing January 2020. triple-checked instead **speculating**... Staying away grandma issue.

Staying away *everyone's* grandma is. guarantee everyone comes contact someone 50 day. Trump collapsed? friend cases job made everyone get tested. tested positive still symptoms 2 weeks later. would never known get tested. I'm glad testing asymptomatic people spreading around think part driving numbers course leftist media never blame antidemocracy BLM riots, perfectly correlates second outbreak delay roughly 3 weeks. level maturity expect pedigree. like 20.

When W became president symptoms present already. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre uncharted territory pricing new medicine, novel medicine, pandemic,‚Äù Gilead‚Äôs chief executive soulless spawn claims human, Dan O‚ÄôDay, told Associated Press. Hospitalizations deaths spike good thing where‚Äôs paper? scientific evidence prove disprove that.

No Antibodies doesn‚Äôt equal immunity could absolutely reason. Normalizing data amount testing first step. 

And yes possible explain increase many ways. Reporting lag, change reporting, change testing protocols, opening business lead increase amount people tested, etc. data answers none questions.

Never less point cases increasing hospitializations deaths seriousness? 
This came lol, fair Airline industry razor thin profit margins, surprise me. There's saying goes:

""In order make million dollars aviation, start billion dollars""

So there's easy solution this, since country really functional passenger rail system medium-long distance essential travel. can't really social distance plane either, confined metal tube hundred people it. Masking probably helps, idea % compliance is, people need pull masks want drink water eat.

&amp;#x200B;

Part thinks airlines nationalized, could essential travel safe manner short term. long term, look Singapore Airlines compared US3 (United, American, Delta), look ME3 (Emirates, Etihad, Qatar) vs US3. comfortable, affordable national airline, even loses money, provides massive economic benefit interconnecting country better connecting smaller cities world. Final note: It‚Äôs shame wh Exactly. many asymptomatic people really theater. I'm sure sentence made sense head. schools open.....and we‚Äôll see spikes again. thanks! recently bought tyson chicken first time read outbreak plant. disinfected package kept freezer. we'll see! both! read wellbeing wellbells. personal risk tolerance $500, buying house debt. even...

Spotters aside, lift alone. gainz REALLY important him, home equipment?

he sounds like must little baby bird legs vanity muscles. guess maybe says gains important, means showing bros thicc traps, oggling women important. Otherwise would invested gainz system get thru pandemic.  crazy virus different person person. know total 7 people got it. One friend 6 subcontractor works got it. pretty much hit everyone company work site each. one 7 got actually got sick. 6 would even known got it. mild. reason knew whole company get tested. take back. say lost taste sense smell bit. said weird feeling feel ""sick"". mild everyone. common cold would worse them. say healthy though. smoked work construction day. I'm guessing probably healthy person though, make real dangerous. really overweight really bad shape? also dangerous condition like diabetes sort lung disease. still crazy seems like 2 different versions virus there. healthy people even realize (I saw first hand many times) people dead 3 days get it. crazy. Luckily able make flu-like symptoms. say overweight unhealthy general, would try extra hard stay away others. could end like worse. never know symptoms be. move abroad. agree stressed you. Life sweet Europe. Global cases rising well 3-4 weeks deaths lagged behind whatsoever. Deaths globally pretty steady two months I'm fine allowing gyms reopen, agree gym goers allowed grocery stores essential businesses.

I care get sick something non-essential. care get sick something non-essential spread others. reckless behavior increases risk others allowed. mine political one I‚Äôm replying Oh gracious! heart &lt;3 Working kids come potential side effect death. work way planche one legged squats.

Wear eye protection too. Protective eyewear lowers transmission rates ~14%. Right around time he's talking masks (10:33), heard loud cough audience... he's wearing mask here, knows, maybe coronavirus way? personally care who. Might seem like it, swedish studies usually get faster others reason ;) 
But covid world wide problem. works stuff better. thank link, know before. Right person wanting human beings thrown street pandemic... that's selfish one. 

IF that's logic, arguing you. Keep punching babies. Mandatory masking help. Surprisingly Walmart also working like well oiled machine. order furniture since got first apartment, spot scan bar code emailed you, told parking spot go to. send employees pairs make go faster masks gloves. We've amazing leadership BC. Dr Bonney, Adrian Dix Horgan played roles perfectly. afraid admit bit luck side, they're calm demeanor focus educating public things fantastic.

It's also amazing thag Horgan pretty much background figure right now. pops week, letting experts communicate.

I'm proud BC neighbours Province. We've done we've do, ready need. ""They asked wear masks"" 
Almost entire ""wear fucking mask"" crowd full shit can‚Äôt argue people. It‚Äôs cool subreddit called ‚ÄúPOLITICS‚Äù bans people clear hive mind. there‚Äôs something wrong conservative subs it. Can‚Äôt make shit up. patient visitation makes money? Definitely. can‚Äôt think much nonessential gym hairdresser rn. disrespect anyone works jobs worth dying over? No. I‚Äôm England live Kansas. (UK) health system amazing. really eye opening move see people pay see Dr. friend went Dr toothache (couldn‚Äôt afford dentist). gave script OxyContin pain, that‚Äôs it. wonder opioid crisis too. waiting approval corporate office proceeding.

I think mean you'r waiting lawyers math liability Wait, what??? shit realize ? Pulls brakes puts brakes? does. What‚Äôs happening people seem continually underestimating time frame virus. act like gym opens week two later people get sick. That‚Äôs Covid works, exactly.

I‚Äôve seen individual cases people got Covid renting Air BnB used someone else previous day. actually surprised hear cases people coughing others get beat down... (at least heard any) maybe Chickens people working someplace.  I‚Äôm working field long become unemployable? Yeah that‚Äôs mind heavy well. government still set price controls drugs even produced corporation. overwhelming majority US landlords giant corporate landlords. business loss personal safety issue. dont even see hypocracy. okay someone else bearing burden. sad.

Bills need paid. Times rough. obvious government needs step help people.

Instead saying landlords eat instead. Look selfish being. lol im that.. mask fully on..tho 3 months Wow sucks. company letting stay home work long takes. thankful. also said they'll cover health costs anything comes up. Yeah, support right people protest lockdown. exercised right call fucking selfish morons reject science care nothing fellow man. legal right so. Vast vast vast majority people wont happen couldn‚Äôt pay gym right now. normal day people don‚Äôt wipe stuff down. Throw coronavirus that‚Äôs big NOPE me. Universal masks would both. anti-life people way, even medicare medicaid everyone would expected save tens millions healthcare emergencies. even sure prices, never ""hotel vacations"", least flights cheaper looked flights home ... 
And right, sound like blast ... even countries would open, sticking pre-Corona vacation plans, meant solo hiking &amp; wild camping Swedish mountains. Hoping trails much crowded locals stopped hoa fees, property tax, utilities along I‚Äôm landlord personally responsible fuck yeah. not, I‚Äôm pretty screwed Let's make illegal. frequency see happening US higher first world country. There‚Äôs always burden placed someone prove something, even legal system. Usually it‚Äôs set person least amount power situation given benefit. 

In instance legal system, burden placed accuser rather accused. makes sense, legal system designed help address scenarios wherein state could say ‚Äúshe it,‚Äù would end that. 

Even presumption innocence, accused challenging battle fight. Juries may told presume someone innocent, it‚Äôs clear don‚Äôt actually feel way. 

In workman‚Äôs comp scenario, employer like state. power employee. Therefore, equitable system requires burden proof created safe working environment.

Without burden proof, employee could ever expect file workman‚Äôs comp claim win. That‚Äôs system set way - mitigate potential abuse employer. 

By way, even system, employer still likely comes ahead. Imagine going back gym 5 months get sick fuck.

The irony... thought farm workers. young people? 

Look mirror - that's reason. 

Per CDC guidelines reopen, FL met 0 requirements yet went full throttle. Take personal ownership - oh wait, can't, like hero white house. [Relevant mind changing me, it‚Äôs one biggest ones. Insane terrifying! don‚Äôt remember leadership feels likeÔøº Good lord, they‚Äôre weaponizing Boomer vs. Millennial feud! 

Also, call bullshit statement: ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt control ... they‚Äôre younger people. They‚Äôre going they‚Äôre going do,‚Äù DeSantis said.‚Äù

Desantis fucking governor, could made mask wearing mandatory, imposed required enforcement fines, could done without vilifying segment population.

If you‚Äôre younger live Florida, feel scapegoat? Protests banned hope? Largely everybody else stayed completely home protests riots occurred. downside, tho, politicians scientists staked positions hardline lockdown tightly clutching pearls stay home lockdowns flipped loudly supported even joined BLM protests. shot credibility. everyone fence thinking, well get want, I. Lockdown over. feels ableist. son special needs know would rank IQ test honestly even though think he's pretty smart. like wearing mask bugs knows keeps others safe anyways. German always supporting U.S. came political discussions. since Trump came office really started losing faith.. America please get well soon! Except he‚Äôs exactly right, there‚Äôs one known case gym. There‚Äôs confirmed cases beaches outdoor spaces really problem? seems virus takes crowded indoor areas like churches bars Show us article evidence claim.

Hotels.com show tons open rooms Martin county. thought said 100% capacity? ""Metro"" = metro Nashville. could like comment 1,000 times would.  tourists go TN forth? oh yeah, sevierville almost 600 cases 90k people, that's 100 cases last two weeks (presumably active ones) 1/1000 would like florida getting 21k time span (florida got 42k iirc) still pretty bad since many people infected tourists come days spread back ""home"" favorite line heard ‚Äúyour right spin around arms ends fist connects face‚Äù everyone got N95 respirator type mask wore public 3 weeks?

Yes would uncomfortable 3 weeks. Could eradicated? like dream! spread gyms South Korea. Even Yoga gyms. cluster found Zumba classes High energy thing.

This study probably funded gym chains. I‚Äôm gym rat, idea damaging lungs permanently anathema! I‚Äôve learned mountain biking it‚Äôs better skip risky stuff still ride tomorrow. took 6 months recover separated shoulder. That‚Äôs looong time love. 

Now imagine rest life. Stay fuck gyms. go local gym .. it‚Äôs 24 hour one small town.. chain. go weight machines bottom floor .. make sure gym empty floor someone comes put mask leave. 25 less cardio outdoors  person graduated 2013 assuming traditional 4 year degree straight hs. Situation '13 far cry 2009 lows. agree guy, perception landlords wealthy completely wrong. 47% people rental units single rental unit. 

Also, there's income cap farting around Reddit. Rich people ""better"" you, certainly petty bullshit. Look Elon Musk, example. I've nurse tell 3 days norm. point long lasting damage vaccine ask for. I'll take arm pain mild flu symptoms. Hopefully don‚Äôt run shelf life problem. But...the corona virus real America it? ""Wear mask. don't. I'm sign cop"" serves right employer spouse's employer requiring us return work. means 600 employees returning two separate offices, despite fact case counts, hospitalizations, deaths increased since began working home. We've asked continue work home, kind work allows it, denied. Thank you. Wow, I'm surprised going happen. I'm assuming local level decision Governor nothing it? DeSantis pretty firm reversing reopening FL. hope still awake sane. made point - ok carry COVID-19 go work infect, kill others not, ABSOLUTELY DIE without paycheck. gave long list excuses justify point.

Put different way, different anti-maskers, Karens Chads there. willing kill get/keep want. People much freedom whatever want, virus going keep spreading. Solution government step offer pay rent. already housing programs assist needy. hope Spain stays safe friend.

And I'm glad adequate leadership! Interesting discussed. keep telling everyone talk AC issue office. one listening. went doctor‚Äôs office 11 year old‚Äôs yearly physical guess what...

I'm hoping extra punctuation sign sarcasm please hate me. Well, stocked one thing matters: guns. Guns cure anything, mean could take masks people force. South Carolina 1300 cases.

A candidate like would decimal percentage support country shit pulled, fact he's still another 4 years depressing shows systematic failure education, mass media bipartisan game democracy turned sports event, rather reality.

And Trump re-elected, fallout voters terrifying see. Jesus Christ man Europe opening back without spikes.

Unless want everyones profession seems little rude single out, no? win corona - goodluck America Like Shoes, Shirt, service? say ""No Pants"" we're IN! ^^/s US trust US world leader collapses pandemic 

FTFY let everyone idiots pay medical bills. Tax payers insurance payers financially burdened idiocy. Well look responses month related public responding. 

""Feb US OK"" well introduced this, given warnings thought government would heed new developments revealed day (still true day far info goes). also downplayed heavily administration course people ignore warning given scientist government longest time simply denied serious was. 

""Mar: Masks necessary"" countries enforced others didn't. everything still brand new basically controversy based information known time. mention ""lockdown"" even though lot people protested too. However see lockdowns eased states like Texas Florida decided open without containing virus seeing even high cases initially March. Texas' hospital capacity 100% showing effects little reduce/stop spread. 

""Jun: Yeah, gonna hard convince folks take vaccine anyways"" hard convince people wear mask. Look individual states/governors handled this. People still downplaying existence virus refuse wear masks even data gathered throughout world stating effective be. recently saw article study 80% Americans would simply wear mask could theoretically reduce country's infection rate 8%. believe article read here's link idea behind it: vaccines always going groups outright deny kind vaccine thanks anti-vax propaganda. vaccines safe released derived already existing vaccines works. MERS/SARS (which resembles SARS-COV-2) example Oxford based vaccine of. vaccine works back threats fresh much like new coronavirus. headstart knowledge interacts body done altered COV-SARS 2 (virus causes COVID 19) order speed process creating vaccine. Mulan definitely getting delayed, damn Nope. way keep 50 pre-existing conditions unemployment leave. mom way likely get grocery shopping getting haircut school. Kids big spreaders. I'm amused USA death toll numbers fucked around badly appears lowest mortality rate world well highest obesity rate.

What chances? Unless physically closing borders states, doesn‚Äôt matter draw lines make rules. lowest common denominator going fuck whole country. Good move, 7/27 peak recent reopenings.  Indoors people = death.

A better A/C change that. little fair, trumps position lot support many allies done actions lot US bashing weakening effect web leading general attitude among groups support/defend despise us much. turn leads trump crew demanding equitable cost defense said allies. equitable share reduces US's soft power since ally less reliant US. question is, much soft power worth? Trump supporters ether consider it, think worth spend willing give up. worth give affect trade, actually useful tool securing trade, probably worth giving up. Time tell guess.

Tourism worse less important something else. Places attract tourists setup economy supporting demand services. general need services supporting economy grows. true also areas many go business trips. areas new residential buildings.. new shops soon people move in.

What saying numbers today countries locked better sweden. Still heavily affected many ongoing pandemic suggest stay home fact lost jobs. pandemic block drugs, alcohol gambling?

They're source poverty. course does. can't say virus burning anything along line are, moment time, still seeing results mitigation. simply cannot logically justify stance. mitigation removed equation, still true, become coherent conversation. Right simply cannot say whether seeing result efforts taken result burnout herd immunity. look pure practicality, New Zealand time country supposedly ""beat"" virus, went absolute extreme opposite anything remotely close virus burnout herd immunity. thing empirically know right mitigation works. Anything else pure conjecture. We're bossy assholes. Agree like malaise 

Not hell family resources others barely hanging work savings could hellish Maybe could start shaming people 20s live parents. Especially since jerk free. Guns! 

Seriously though. We‚Äôre point. Talking worrying $$$, government definitely leader problem. welcome! need vegetable, fruit let know! chickens eggs lambs slaughter too. buy 100% think government needs kick asses high gear help. Keep helping dont stop. ""Relief"" going wrong pockets. needs go directly landlords, tenants, health care, school systems, food. 

I never ever would think tenants get paid. come larger cities know mass homelessness looks like good economy. millions families sleeping cars pitching tents stereotypes typical homeless community (severe mental health problems addiction) see true problem. 1st world country 1st world facades attached. country ready average family mass standing soup lines starving streets. That's everyone still talks great depression super fucked psychologically damaging culture. 

I want everyone get paid safe. feel like landlords sometimes dont see eventually come point gotta stop demonizing tenants inability pay start knocking white house door force. arguing bad idea position sell stock life emergencies? date Tegnell say ""plateau""? April 18.

What date revealed 6% population infected? June 18.

That's two months talking ""plateau"". antibody test results released changed criteria testing, showed ""plateau"" lie.

And forget, Tegnell forced rounds media talking true number higher delay testing report admitting shocked number low.

Even then, trying control perception bad news (from pretending trying hide it. 

I'm pretending, obvious.

They talking ""plateau"", despite knowing numbers reporting low, way knowing fast spreading intentionally restricting testing.

They expected numbers much higher, instead talking ""plateau"". reach 6% population infected, thousands new cases per day period reporting hundreds.

They know people math figure really going on. seriously make sense, seem understand basics diseases spread evolve. already admitted decision based science, wanting cause run n95s. Scientists knew masks worked since January. I‚Äôm pretty sure something similar happened London Bus Driver, London underground worker taxi driver died caught Covid 19! seriously believe old people go bars clubs?

It fascinating people get heart stuck narrative, they're capable ignoring everything else fit it.  takes cake.

Let guess - MSN article demographics contained within conspiracy-drive fake news.  reports crowded bars clubs beaches lies too. permanent disability.

It actually often is. breathlessness fatigue irreversible lung course find studies say something like ""*Some* patients survive Covid19 *may* suffer permanent damage"".

Here's understanding hold up. liver organ remarkable regeneration skills.

Your lungs remodel degree almost scaring permanent. COVID fact. lung fact.

So read stories understand disease process could causing anecdotes. align research saying.

And confidently say damage irreversible. that's lungs work.

You might waiting someone explicitly say implicit knowledge mistake lack evidence. We're saying understand implicit implications ARDS, lung scarring, kidney failure, etc.

The problem know frequent infrequent is. extensively studied it, patients difficult find, lastly take symptoms catch disease symptoms divorced positive diagnosis (e.g. Kidney failure). Yea money. lasted population decided fire service public good funded publicly benefit society, instead operated privately profit. We'll get healthcare, big insurance companies little intimidating private fire departments. I‚Äôm hearing anecdotes Western Europeans often compliant health recommendations, especially Dutch. Countries crushed curve seem downplaying importance masks distancing should.

Also, Canada province known patriots muh freedumbs- Alberta. average, drug help reduce hospital costs $12,000 per patient, said. Gilead estimated savings based data showing day hospitalization costs $3,000 patients taking remdesivir discharged four days sooner receiving standard treatment, Mr. O‚ÄôDay said.

As counter opinion, physician. get vaccinated every year flu. hesitate receive vaccine gone 3 trials testing - fast tracked not. Especially one vaccines built upon already known proven safe research testing i.e. Oxford. Well guess screwed big time used gains buy new air conditioner. im rich person I'm clearly screwing somehow according many people. sounds like whole premise argument, wanting burden fall tenant.

No. crux argument people need fairly compensated work services.

I would employer withholding salaries working employees ""NO ONE GETING PAID"" tenants living unit without Landlords get paid too

Agreed. That's Warren's piece legislation garbage. Putting freeze non-payment rent evictions breaking another camel's back instead. government step hope everything dish gets served right back throat.

Ah, another person irrationally hates landlords. There's many guys Reddit. time, idea pre-symptomatic cases. 

Absolutely false. first studies asymptomatic spread came late January. go, *sighing again*. data might reflect number tests done recently, number cases least 4 -5 days behind. Private labs better (4-5 days) Dept. Health labs 6-7 days behind .

So numbers we're looking tests done last weekend approx Weds. last week. 
Of course, bad news...when see numbers next week we'll know much doo doo we're in. predict horrors. Watch hospitalization case counts. one could predicted covering dumb face could complicated! going states trouble reporting numbers, suppression work? WELL üò≠ 

AZ dead last virus spread reopened. Ugh. naive. places lock down. did, weeks. Like instance, area live Texas. 3 week lockdown. Nevertheless, people could definitely work. far herd immunity

I believe 60% people need virus herd immunity. New York State population nearly 20 million 400,000 positive tests.  means 2% state tested positive. That's LONG way herd immunity. miss sitting bar too. never liked eating tables, usually myself. know now? go. take food home eat comfort house. Sure, miss social aspects, really fine.  That's real irony this. Even moderately competent leadership would've made 2020 red wave election. Respond early, avoid politicizing response, let pandemic experts drive bus. president show little empathy, model right behaviors, call America unify around common purpose.

But nope. Trump it. are. almost certainly going guarantee President Biden maybe even full Democratic control Congress, I'm happy with, cost going high. NOVA well. Outside walking around neighborhood parks 10%, there's lots space distance. local (just reopened) library stores basically 100% seen problems. That's lie..west Virginia protects people.. especially vulnerable US, number one cause individual bankruptcies medical debt. guilty thing?

No aren't. people absolutely must travel right now. respect individuals, rest us avoid costs. ""I miss mommy"", ""My mother dying"", ""I'll fired can't feed/support family make flight"". ‚Äúloathe‚Äù sports.... word used completely different meaning ü§∑üèª Gentlemen jury, I'm curious, bear me. aware we're making history? define equally? Pure equal division like Vatican pays USA? based population like India pays 4 times USA? Wow! long take? Again, article trying cause drama.

Nowhere say insurance has. could fringe 3rd party coverage, could plan high deductible. would nice know specifics article saying ""One persons insurance charged 200, 6,500"" INSURANCES? 

As mentioned, plenty carriers taken steps assist members time, charging all. feeling adequate information, we'd lead information showing patient accepted random 3rd party plan clause making stuff like patient responsibility. America's fault standardized healthcare? No, insurances fault swindling people plan. Insurance something equal, unfortunately sign subpar plan world privatized healthcare. 

But 99% cases personally working COVID, written professional courtesy. take will. husband's work confirmed case share is. husband co-workers can't sure exposed wasn't. I'm sure reasoning behind less respect employee's privacy whole lot fear people exposed self quarantine. Granted, outbreak would see drop employees well guess figure today put tomorrow? Monday's results come 41,600 tests, Saturday's numbers came 78,300 test results.

The state seen huge increase cases past week, 46,000 confirmed span time.

The percent positivity cases reported Monday 13.67%. fourth day row rate 12%. jury thinks do. Truthfully lot doubt DA going try cut deal press go jury trial DA probably waste time dismiss case ""For tell everybody required wear mask, able enforce it, give false sense security believe everyone following rules,"" McMaster said.‚Äù

So cannot enough rule 100% it‚Äôs required?  Time get rid speed limit laws then. Absolutely. primaries Bernie tried get culinary union board M4A camps convinced interests would lose union medical benefits. Ultimately, chose endorse anyone officially. pretty much said Bernie. policy would make difference point we‚Äôre still pre election wonder still feel way realizing they‚Äôre personal safety net isn‚Äôt protective thought. relying employer health care make something coverage family. like 15 mile runs 95 degree heat rural Illinois, there's people. Ah, Federal IT, suck much. Well want look Texas specifically, death rate climbing since June 14. 7-day rolling average deaths increased 50%.

US whole begin rising new cases June 9. started surging June 15. Thanks. needed vent little. would much worse it. Man, I‚Äôve always wanted move Columbus. makes want even more. Thanks! 

Benzowithdrawl far unpleasent thing ever expericed. However know end choice quit correct one.

 wishes certainly needed! meet number IHME assumed longer strict distancing measures shutdown. also prescribed additional shutdowns. current model includes assumption states decrease mobility like 90 percent hit 8 deaths per million. I'd states going blow right past projections. Way past.


All state assumptions hope people use model correctly. time publish models personally think assumptions reasonable. states change up, willing look model recognize initial assumptions longer true. yes, said ""sorry chance voucher may expire"", not? there‚Äôs enough warrant objective conclusions, there‚Äôs substantial evidence suggesting new studies needed, argument. hope. don‚Äôt count fucking trash family staying away politics either. Pay attention man behind PPE curtain. Arizona Florida swing states. accurately predict people wear masks Trump bumper stickers. math. That's crazy, truly can't control reaction, ever even truly tried? We‚Äôre 2 million capped like 87,000. Wtf goin sign - social worker arrest power. south. purple states happened go red governor last election. governors states like mine act universal support barely won. fact, mine Governor elected R governor hot mess. basically correct, scientific adviser said COVID-19 virus actually significant mutation rate, extremes HIV genetic reshuffling influenza. indeed better proofreading system flaws, sheer replication rate high inevitably mutations pile up. another reason virologists public health specialists trying push R0 1, indeed risk harmful mutations arising rips population high levels. exactly narrative every American subscribes to? MN summer camp (my work, yay) open two weeks social distancing adults wearing masks. We'll see turns out. Kids utter crap social distancing, even reminders every two minutes. 

I either allergies acting up, COVID I'm getting tested tomorrow. We'll see goes! Sometimes forgot go store bc need dirty looks VA stores let child fragile lungs idk...guess something lose  Academic labs government funded... lumped together anyone brain ever worked one (hint! myself!) would know that..    Consequences science denial, political footballing pandemic, lack care countrymen fellow citizens. country chosen learn hard way. play professional sports. already are. they're kids care want party. Otherwise, anti vaxxers anti maskers same. Viruses cannot read care. there's way accelerated spread, buy articles hasn't. we're starting see trends cities. think read lines problem large part country spoon fed information can‚Äôt think past today tomorrow. discovered originated USA. 

This highly unlikely. Genomic research shows SARS-COVID19 passed civet way becoming human-hosted virus.

Civets tropical roughly Ghana west Taiwan east. 7-day average US risen 40% one week. got naked twitter. Indeed. Politicizing health abhorrent wrong. know fact capable reading I‚Äôm supposed dumb southern rube slob doesn‚Äôt believe masks though. Unlike sophisticated types panic New York Times headlines. Hahaha 

(Incidentally live NYC numerous personal spreadsheets tracking covid data)  science?? conducted nationwide test suggest finding? Lets see source that.

How explain 65% increase Seattle? also mask hating rednecks? take kids

You demographic people want go fun. Death rates many states. Here's clues may be.

* Indiana: 1,832 COVID-19 deaths; 2,149 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 384)
* Illinois: 4,856 COVID-19 deaths; 3,986 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 782)
* Tennessee: 336 COVID-19 deaths; 1,704 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 611)
* Ohio: 1,969 COVID-19 deaths; 2,327 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 820)
* Virginia: 1,208 COVID-19 deaths; 1,394 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 451)
* West Virginia: 72 COVID-19 deaths; 438 pneumonia deaths (five-year average: 117)

Data sourced &amp; rate dropping"" ass. people die pneumonia get tested COVID counted pneumonia deaths. Shockingly 5 6 times pneumonia deaths 5 year average states shitty testing rates. wonder Earth could possibly explain this!?! already got sued, claimed exactly cried frist amendment, judge dropping case them. Sickening. watched old man die want listen female doctor, warned complications fell roof.

It one saddest moments life. feel like I'm watching again. Yeah handled pandemic proper response beginning could‚Äôve gone pretty good him. economy wouldn‚Äôt also taken huge slide it‚Äôs twice. Maybe research one Bc credible data linking masked protest surges. I‚Äôm Houston rise Bc mass stupidity.

From experience tutoring lately, teachers seemed taking opportunity lazy possible. Making half-assed ""courses"" assignments. Im sure different every teacher though, experience teachers arent great. makes worse online.

As American, feel embarrassed know people country think enforcing masks freedom. Army Corps Engineers planned do? Yeah, florida basically thing. Here's post made FB response someone linking article claiming increase due increase testing: 

Interesting, definitely another spike anyone points death chart below, site:
""The Deaths Day chart shows total number Florida residents confirmed COVID-19 died calendar day (12:00 - 11:59 PM). Death data often significant delays reporting, data within past two weeks updated frequently.""
the death data reliable couple weeks passed subject major revisions. subject deaths, Florida under-counting deaths 
Pay special note column: ""Deaths involving pneumonia without covid-19. excluding influenza deaths"". Florida, number 6820.
Now take note column: ""All deaths involving covid""; 2802 Florida
This gives us amount 4018 pneumonia deaths involve covid (according Florida). Florida fair normal year? actually outside normalcy them? Absolutely.  
That's mortality data Florida 2015 - 2018, took liberty extra cautious including flu deaths total well. notice worst YEAR 2018 clocking whopping 3091, extend data back last decade find years number sits 2000-2500, again, entire year.
So currently, exclude covid deaths (and flu) entirely, we'd already extremely bad flu season, that's counting feb june, 4 months.
This also include increases heart attacks strokes seen areas hard hit covid (because clotting disease presents primarily damaged lungs, high blood pressure, rapid heart rates) probably good data quite time.
So yeah, Florida roughly 1000 excess unspecified pneumonia deaths even taking flu related deaths, counting potential heart attacks strokes related covid are/were missed. They're definitely fudging covid numbers.

Now, rest article...
He shows complete lack understanding exponential growth works. super common, I've seeing everywhere. People assuming average lag time covid infection test/hospital 14 days, time there's potential super spread event (IE re-opening, protests, etc) going see spike around 14 days later. That's infections work though unless significant portion population already infected meeting significant portion uninfected. actually happens people infect each, 2-3 weeks almost unnoticeable, looks mainly like noise data even perceptible all. Give couple weeks though, we're working third/4th generation infections, point starts become noticeable.

The protests (like said guys before) show data 4-6 weeks, means another 5-12 days least cases start really popping up. Likewise, told end may re-opening would spike cases 3-4 weeks, 3-4 weeks later cases starting spike. Horowitz also got ""flatten curve"" wrong. flatten curve, go back normal let spike again. keep flat, means continuing distancing wearing masks closed public places large gatherings (if go).

Last note, yes, death rates going down, generally expect pandemic progresses get better treating it. Unfortunately Florida's case they're even actually deaths, overall death rate continued go sitting 103% normal levels currently (all causes) pneumonia taking large chunk excess death%. death rate likely going start going another 12-15 days case surge starts reach critical 12-15 day window either get better get hospitalized. Florida's increase cases linked increase testing (although average age is), tell % positive tests also going rapidly, means spread virus outpacing testing again.
So, yeah things consider. I'm optimistic disease gives immunity while. people get it, regardless age, slow spread later.

So lower risk people get help prevent even people getting later possibly overwhelming medical system. Half-arsed lockdowns nothing. closed already smh probably misses nana much frustrated.  lol, knows climatologists feel. Nationwide work, one enforce it.

States enact them, hope get local law enforcement enforce it

States also ban people states even cities. Like Arkansas banned people New York, New Orleans, hot spots months ago. course Governor Arkansas whining New York putting travel bans states. +1

Recently moved FL (whoops), Indiana born raised. Please fuck Pence. Still plenty denial going on. Look DeSantis' comments today, example. Dude it‚Äôs time shine!

 I'm European America aching visit family think that's good call. hurts, people dying can't breathe obviously hurts more. Bot test:

Green state realize warned people ahead time could avoid killing murder.

Oh wait, that's works.

It's also literally impossible Noah warned everyone, great many would died without warning.

Never mind ark could contained humanity plus breeding pairs animals, thing impossible point would moot anyway. would believe magic fairy tales think so. Australian states still completely closed borders. while, state closed *internal* borders.

Is hurting economy? course. necessary? Absolutely. Man, thought summer would temporary reprieve pandemic

I felt exact opposite. Every day shitty weather spring live like ""Yesssss, people stay inside shitty out!"" part did. rainy cold shit March, nobody wants go outside. going outside? Shiver muddy yard drinking beer buddies? course not.

I knew minute summer came combination regular ""thank god winter over"" energy + ""I can't stand quarantine anymore"" energy would blow fucking lid everything are. 4th July weekend going *wild*. Either massive COVID problem mental disabilities, maybe both.  bad idea, similar issue tourism general.

You want ""low value"" travel pandemic, ie people coming really planning spending money. may still want make exception planning making large purchase, business deal, spending thousands.

Tolls borders one way filter out, form tax, deeply unpopular. ie ""fuck WA, want $200 even able visit"". moment, closed + seek approval travel economic compassionate reasons. bureaucracy, popular people, easy understand. make cut, costs person applying nothing, don't, does.

More realistically, full questionnaire contact tracing details (ie itinerary) would better middle ground, although general think soon whilst country differing levels openness - especially Victoria looking real prospects tightening controls. get wrong, WA lockdown letting domestic tourists, it'll political potentially economic ruin.

Need remember too, biggest industry mining basically underground cruise ships w/ ground dorms. unfortunate many tourist operators, ""good economy"" complex topic comes borders pandemic. look Texas, state opened bars ""for economy"". knew soon, know we're cautious, - cost opening ""too soon"" severe I'd rather err caution personally.

I'm sure healthcare professionals best have, resources, there's resources. authoritarianism enable enforce illiberal ways. That's power Iran possess way China, China's case better worse. I've stated right thing do, claim ""victory"" simply wrong.

I've looking around, I've seen threads last week Reddit also Swedish news regarding population thinks response, honestly can't find proper source. Yet remember (unfortunately can't source though) support decreasing - we've also lately seen lot critique among opposition parties Sweden - support current strategy among people still somewhere inbetween 50-60%. dare say yes, average Swede still does, albeit overwhelmingly so.

As asking elaborate why, can't give complete answer. guess simple answer since we're living liberal society (something quite honestly case quite countries) people trust state (which true also illiberal society), state also trust people. might sound absurd read, way look it.

A lot people course critisising Sweden's response whole pandemic. say they're right, time get feeling done patriotic point view, basically using Sweden scape-goat boost morale prove right thing. that's weird thing say, compare things like that, pandemic (remember long took actually call pandemic?) actually done with.

I'm trying argue Sweden things right wrong country, think countries complete lockdowns enforcing quarantines right things, nothing quite black white many wants things be.

You might look I'm ""grasping straws"", would disagree, professor (Harvard professor William Hanage) article I'm refer defend approach per se, [he makes quite many ways widely misunderstood. Also [this interesting read, might tell development can/will happen many western countries, albeit delayed due previous lockdowns.

Sounds awesome. want guy next big one comes. outsider looking in, I'm really sure would think vaccine enough. 

  Somehow pandemic took world, became political issue US.

Curious see things changed. Probably mix. We'll analyzing ages scientifically aspect human behavior totally forgotten, least while. 


BUT likely personally affected feel guilt remorse etc. enjoy Italy trip without ignorant, rude demanding American tourists. Exactly.

I‚Äôll wait answer. can't disease populace outbreak sign pneumonia then, year later, severe disease. chances novel disease would cause outbreak 10 months small almost impossible. GO CUOMO!!!!! Probably bulging fat tumor growing everything read whole pandemic, thing sticks accounts Italian doctors deciding would get care, basically sentencing person worse odds death.

Hahaha fuck waiting Talk shithole countries. hated everything video. They‚Äôre literally paint Karen victim she‚Äôs one 100% wrong What??? Yeah, kind makes sense, since seem able reach herd immunity levels influenza (flu) either.

Which means like flu, people decide get vaccination, hopefully protect family/household,

OR

Decide get vaccination whatever reason, hoping everyone else does, ""protect"" family herd immunity.

Yes, know people medically cannot get vaccinations, far in-between, that's include options.

We've ""outbreaks"" disease/illnesses essentially thought wiped out, people choosing vaccinate, time passes, overall immunity levels end dropping, end herd immunity levels, expect see make come back.

I wonder anti-vaxxers, planning ""Chicken Pox parties"" like days past? end essentially result getting vaccination, without actually getting sick potentially issues and/or complications. 

I really feel bad people cannot vaccinated medical reasons, actually depend herd immunity try reduce risk infection illness.

It makes sense me, may able reach herd immunity levels 'Merica well because, ""freedom"", ""freedom"" believe stupid things stupid things.

Sigh.... restrictions want lifted? C'mon man. honestly sort health issue, neither selfish obnoxious speak needs. Problem assholes mimic shit like get away whatever want, like Hollywood set declaring small dogs ""therapy dogs"" get away using fashion accessory stores. 

I really curious going she'd claim ""health condition"" was, I've yet see condition would prevent mask-wearing. absolutely increase work breathing, they're ultimately *healthier option* COPD asthma entirely possible wear, tend two issues hear brought up. arguing totalitarian government? Yes big misstep intentionally lie public masks (even white lie preserve almost nonexistent stockpiles). think assumption anything N95 useless -- though new data finally showed even simpler surgical masks beneficial effect. However, administration, Pence Trump, turned masks political issue circus, along social distancing many aspects compliance help reduce spread. California hair ahead much bigger state. Arizona wins per capital Florida Texas look ready overtake California overall number soon I'm probably traveling long time tbh. oxford's vaccine grant immunity maybe mind idk mean he‚Äôs wrong... sure they‚Äôre probably fudging numbers shit ton, it‚Äôs like testing there‚Äôs already overwhelming amount cases. going impact single parents two-income reliant households?

So thanks- get $1400 back stimulus citizens us got. remembering wrong? Trump would hold daily press conferences would let Doctors Fauci Birx speak first do. would follow-up saying follow recommendations CDC. role talk federal government taking steps mitigation like Navy hospital ship distribution stockpiled ventilators.

 never offered medical advice apart fact personally refused wear mask recommendations CDC, largest misstep, opinion. Science: Changes mind new research data accurately combat virus slow infection/death rate

Reddit: INCONSISTENT WISHY WASHY NEVER TRUST THEY'VE DONE NOTHING CONFUSING BET WANT blah blah fuckin blah Oh... want reasonable discussion. Alright, way. they're choosing so. politicians keep inserting themselves! fuck man, karens ruining :( Socialized healthcare mean magically create new hospitals, PPE, staff overnight. means costs lower get situations like U.S. beg people call ambulance you, take Uber hospital, life saved deal $100,000 medical debt rest life.

I‚Äôm done conversation urge better educate topic posting further. world doesn‚Äôt need misinformation, especially now. part solution, part problem. crippling issues America extend far beyond Trump though, started way before. Even Obama, objective standard far better, delivered inadequate solution America's lack universal healthcare could make critical reforms. also got US involved disastrous foreign wars Libya Syria. would help America plurality, first past post voting system traps two parties, easily bought campaign contributions resulting corruption it.

They're adapting president's approach ""if keep ignoring pretending exist go away"" Hey America, sat around 4 months finger ass, today finally decided good idea tell everyone wear mask thingy Here's hoping.

Rochester we've outdoor dining month now, we're still curb stomping virus. thing is- Cuomo strong regulations place, almost every restaraunt bar following guidelines fear losing license, people seem following guidelines. 

So, seems like outdoor dining possible, least. started indoor dining 2 weeks ago, numbers continue decrease. Hopefully trend continues staying phase four future aint fucking bad. Fuck think might getting sick stupid people listen simple rules social distancing. scary happening Washington Ohio. got hit early on, great job getting control. flaring back reopening.

Texas, Florida, Arizona ignorant assholes start. course, day care. sucks majority cannot trusted keeping families isolated, minimize public activites, wear masks, wash hands, etc. kids families took seriously, would less risk open schools. takes one dumb family put everyone risk. Ok that's true. worst risky person, likely significantly less risky. classes taught outdoor open area? Perhaps erect temporary pavilions? lot evidence says chances infection outdoor environment low. Yea, instead waiting till 6:50 started talking 4 months ago. know that.

Bing Google make sound like disability try translate Chinese. Baidu? something even better? quit making virus political idiot. Thing is, always one doc scientist say opposite, whatever reason, give pols saying opposite enough room operate think full preventative measures immediately implemented hotspots (which gonna happen let's pretend) current spike reach previous spike's presumed infection numbers, already late? one hand data theoretically might able stop earlier, hand done shit exponential growth curve might locked point... one shot across bow... 

I think tremendous failure due fact majority simply unphased it, believe will.

When next one comes, will, far deadly believe people pretending they're worried quit bullshit wear mask.

Being quarantined month stressful, life need go on, please -- wear mask!!! Target isn‚Äôt limiting number people going far tell. drive now. used long line outside, everyone walks in. 

The market seems taking seriously Trader Joe‚Äôs.

There's ton research that. confusing, none agreeing.

So guess would argue can't view somebody recovered virus truly safe. get infected again, least open question, they're infectious early stages pre-symptom early stages post symptom. fullest. Cuomo crooked. Everybody wants ignore apparently. Corruption follows guy like dog. followed quite closely.

When chinese doctors went Italy, one first things said initially let people self quarantined home. Turns 80% infections family members. That's important separate asap.

Of course watch videos, good stuff makes good tv, usually core, later day night, especially tear gas gets deployed.

I would estimate 98% mask usage protestors DC. Hell, 50% people wide street sunny day slight breeze still wearing masks. agree you.. spicy mayo ate burning tongue distracted 4 months America lol happy cake day! Theres two reasons. 


1) cynical. dont want word order keep panic keep businesses going. 

2) optimistic reasons. dont want people flooding system arent sick ,oh man get tested sister usually goes bar. mean hasnt weeks could gone there.and talked last week it. Also, usually theyll ask sick , hey name everywhere last Thursday.

I hope election get change someone balls something sweep rug go golfing Alright, fine. free, cheaper US. realize excess mortality = COVID deaths, right? reason ""excess mortality"" statistic exists benchmark eliminate possibility misdiagnosis similar illnesses.

If wore masks every flu season, suddenly stopped one season, ""EXCESS MORTALITY"" would spike dramatically. trying justify hypocrisy, failing miserably. could also include China, China allows EU travelers visit well, EU officials told the¬†paper

we looking 125,000 confirmed Covid-19 deaths 4 months. 

the difference staggering. wearing masks people dying, we're wearing masks 10x many people dying. 

so yes, acceptable number deaths taking drastic measures falls somewhere normal flu season Covid-19. people reject even blood transfusion even traditional medicine, expected accept vaccine? tl;dr: *not* criminally indicted.

What would make disgruntled employee? care patients? care safety? care licenses many medical professions worked hard achieve them? hospital put license risk? whos liable something bad happens?

Wouldn‚Äôt want everyone experience good days? many us shopping hospitals? many us want first place? allow people get better care others managers told staff less, fair us? fair health? kind healthcare want?

Rather focusing specific numbers, pay attention trends displayed charts. Follow trend. mouse line see daily total day. NY reporting 8k cases per day, like 20k tests.

Nope. Anti-drone capability readily available man portable, since introduction FIM-92 Stinger missile system similar systems there. 

You can't hear Abrams coming outside main gun's range. also can't see pops behind terrain, behind hill w/e take shot, aim still concealed via scopes systems. Hell, shells supersonic, hear shot blows Toyota Hilux technical tiny bits. 

We're actually building ourselves, we're replacing new variants like M1A2C, soon M1A2D, many major minor improvements. 

We're selling old ones like hotcakes, mostly M1A1s, allies like Australia, Brazil, Greece, Morocco, Taiwan, neutered models like M1A1M allies really trust, like Egypt, Iraq, SaudiA. 

The overall number tanks inventory going go bit. essentially they're getting countries bankroll pimping ones keep. factory makes bit cash since they're servicing/refurbishing used tanks needed they're shipped out, they're ready use. 

Tanks are, lifecycle wise, far like planes ships cars trucks, chassis supposed last many decades repeatedly upgraded incorporate new technology responses emergent threats. M1A2D's built new chassis one originally M1 M1A1, selected re-manufacturing. 

The difference original 1979 M1 brand new 2021 M1A2D staggering. drone would kill M1 trouble without M1 seeing coming. M1A2D would detect targeted drone, deploy multiple countermeasure systems, potentially even shoot incoming missile. time information systems would automatically notify assets area fire aircraft, resulting immediate response.

Serious question: happens country goes unmitigated disaster uncontrollable disaster?

Collapsed healthcare systems across country? national shutdown? Mass graves? know, I'm asking. Yes, gyms need close. catching asymptomatic / pre-symtomatic cases actually helpful stopping spread, provided something done information

And 100 people show testing sites they're ""just wondering"" they're infected given moment time? way catch asymptomatic/pre-asymptomatic people testing presence confirmed case -- contact tracing -- insanely encourage entire population ""show get test"" they're worried. hope fewer people die dying March virus overblown.

I love movies, watch dozen films week. wont going theater anything soon regardless protocols. Bars clubs attempting keep patrons safe awful, like forcing people inside. make breathing mouth difficult.

Plus, wearing mask makes mouth breathing less obnoxious. someone allergies lot, often trouble breathing nose, something learned fast. think might well mark window ‚Äòshut‚Äô point. country? Great: whole stage, apply logic US overall. Now, also take account Florida Texas still reached NY Cali numbers, even per c√°pita. take account median infected range.

Ta da.

If wife never gotten tested would've never either, probably would've assumed wasn't... yeah... symptoms anywhere near describing... cough starters... sore throat? Yeah... Headache? Yeah... One-third Americans get it? yet, one-third Americans anti-vaxxers general. weird stupid. mean Florida also population 170+ countries. saying we‚Äôre fine still valid point would reasonable--in fact would advised--not put Covid patients nursing homes, dont think? agree I'm provax, would say vaccine drops January 2021 get it. seem man knows lot China.
I agree China's values different West, policies cannot replicated West.
I'll make point inherent West see correct.

The social construction COVID-19 China United States markedly different. China's approach COVID-19 ""SARSized,"" U.S. approach COVID-19 ""fluized.""
There clear understanding early days impact COVID-19 infectiousness, harm, lethality. choice facing Chinese government mid late January, choice highly subjective designed maximize risk avoidance. Fear not, fear unexpected. determination largely based past experience knowledge - China knows must repeat 2003 SARS. imperative avoid repeating mistakes past. China, little awareness control respiratory diseases (such influenza), ""SARS-izing"" epidemic Chinese government prevent spread diseases. matter concern levels government, society, individuals.
The situation different United States, understanding respiratory infectious diseases basically built influenza, influenza studied fought year round. mortality rate influenza relatively low (2 3 per 1,000 even lower), society limited prevention control influenza, impossible way introducing massive social control measures would bear greater economic social cost.
But months passed, data converged converged, found COVID-19 mortality rate around 5%. situation different.
Obviously, COVID-19 closer SARS flu - half mortality rate SARS, 20-50 times influenza.
In case, US still wants downplay COVID-19, complicated reasons behind it.

Political civil rights Western system ""negative"" rights, ""negative"" freedoms, ""negative"" rights. freedom), is, want ""free"" something; government can't anything me. freedom person, freedom speech, freedom assembly, freedom religion, etc., advocated Western societies basically belong category, limit. rights government. West believes rights fundamental, ""inherent"" inalienable human being, possessed individual. rights, possible guarantee rights benefits (e.g. economic rights, education rights, health rights). may even argued full political rights citizenship sufficient condition rights benefits (efficient (condition). contrast, economic, social, educational health rights ""positive"" rights, ""positive"" freedoms, often resource rights. , requires empowerment government available individuals. Similarly, category affirmative action, requires different people, regardless class race, access similar resources rights (equity). same, requires society resources government intervention direct limit distribution wealth resources. modern Western thinking, rights considered secondary. Western system, references ""human rights"" often narrowly defined, referring Political civil rights foreground.

Therefore, Americans believe government cannot restrict personal liberties citizens, difficult enforce segregation, limit population flow; Americans believe government never access individual's privacy - health codes, tracking trips via real cell phones. Nothing like creation big data network possible; government cannot restrict individual's freedom religion freedom assembly. see conflict security epidemics freedom religious assembly, judges prefer protect latter.

In United States, individual freedom highest level right, fundamental ""human right"". Whereas vaccination treatment medical field, resource-based, lower-level benefits (not even rights) cannot used to... Interference destruction fundamental ""human rights"".

This fundamental value, fundamental ideology. saying Internet Americans ""free dead"", indeed reflects fact extreme cases, ""freedom"" ""survival"" things matter. ""There conflict them. put specific individual, specific situation, think everyone rational definitely chooses survive. larger values orientation society favor individual's right freedom ignore individual's welfare (especially welfare collective), consequence led state ""better die free"" whole society.

We understand Chinese talk billions people eating ""right live"" totally unacceptable Westerners. philosophy eating right all. right live belongs pigs. believe long people given political civil rights, problem billion people eat. deeply rooted idea.

It's entirely different worldview.
But Americans could control coronavirus without learning country, would admired around world, including Chinese
And now?
Again, alien invasion right now, would never let Americans lead fight aliens. mean need stop precautions

Absolutely agree. Wash hands, stay home sick, cough sneeze people (use elbow), avoid elderly vulnerable friends family sick. common-sense stuff, basic decency. Maybe Americans struggle this, insane attitude health care sick days privileges rights -- isn'r radical still killing ton people

Not really. hundred people day, might dying ""with COVID"" instead ""from COVID."" ubiquitous virus, infecting millions Americans. someone dies testing positive mean died ""from COVID."" lot hospitals around US capacity.

Not true all. aware hospitals aim keep ICUs 80% full? Sometimes higher? Hospitals businesses U.S. and, like hotels, want beds full. onto bootstraps pray don‚Äôt need hospital thing over.

I worried. U.S. plenty hospital beds. major problem lot hospitals forced close furlough staff, patients showing non-COVID care. Oh? Get out! American living America, done fucked friend. ask guys doing? sick, symptoms? lot urban schools really lot open outdoor areas, there's climate problem. live western NY gets cold late fall, warm mid late spring. I'm sure places like Arizona Florida hot much year. WTF. I've got 50000 haggis-hunting licenses ready sold.

Ach well, see etsy. Ho. Lee. Shit. confirms people understand don‚Äôt Americans, sigh. American logic - ""I freedom so, will."" educated vs uneducated. parents‚Äô neighbor, older retired lawyer educated Harvard 60s, also doesn‚Äôt believe mask efficacy refuses wear one. Clearly, must something else play convincing groups people wear masks. something like circuit breaker stock market? source article:

""The E.U.'s announcement incredibly disappointing, step wrong direction seek rebuild global economy,""¬†U.S. Travel Association Executive Vice President Public Affairs Policy Tori Emerson Barnes said. ""This unwelcome news, major negative implications economic recovery‚Äîparticularly ban results cycles retaliation, often case.""

To start 2 kids date immunizations dont plan getting proper vaccines.. BUT, big one...
This admin proven time trusted, push false treatments, so, unless great assurance medical precautions taken get vaccine market fast safe, much reluctant jump in.
And hate happen people resort scream antivaxxer arguing everything except matters, health safety.

This interesting interview scientist developed rotavirus I'm Orange County, CA. get shit dumb ass white people protesting wearing masks like Huntington beach.... butttt city, like 15 minute drive HB almost everyone wears mask. got cvs plastic shields cashiers like 90% people mask. pockets ignorance stand out. I'll pass guinea pig rushed vaccine. supposedly based fast spreading still would come contact reach herd immunity time released? 
Maybe I'm missing something sum: herd immunity unlikely even vaccine critical mass can‚Äôt reach current antivaxx levels.

Coronavirus actually crown anti-vaxxers pro-plague idiots are. others didn‚Äôt also pay price. Interesting perspective. I‚Äôm Canadian living California past 6 years (just moved back Canada today) say similar experiences. chalked California worse rest US. LOL. Jaws. wish one little town. Bah. Respect EU rocketing hospitalization rate meaningless? attribute to, think won‚Äôt result deaths? never wanted come... without covid. Cool, thanks first Confusion.... memory loss.... indifference... must Covid since 1995. mean, mom late march principal threw gym celebration right quarantine started 0 social distancing, got tested weeks ago antibody, came back positive. almost literally worst imaginable person charge. It‚Äôs nightmare. Lol what? It‚Äôs good dude. seems capricious arbitrary. I‚Äôve wearing mask every day since early April employer required it. Don‚Äôt even notice anymore get used quickly. It‚Äôs like fastening seat belt. It‚Äôs something don‚Äôt even think twice about. Shame. Otherwise wouldn‚Äôt 10M+ cases half million deaths. planning international travel right now? American I'm glad.  Without consequences nothing ever change. anyone thinks bar among first things reopen beyond me

Tax dollars  Wishing health wealth fellow countryman. goddamn shame responsible, empathetic folks. point spread protest, probably limited due mask wearing higher percentage Tulsa rally outdoor.

Do need hug? Bringing political affiliation constantly really bad look. 

It's makes hard take serious 3 month old account. Ask Governor Arkansas. banned travel Arkansas hotspots like New York, New Orleans, etc... earlier Time bomb Europe KKona Actually, it‚Äôs big mistake EU allow anyone in, thats second wave start Fox News merely parroted government positions. government officials like Peter Navarro promote hydroxychloroquine potential cure, example, Fox would make made themselves. mean, back back World War champs American, I'm American. you‚Äôre married French citizen go well. countries limits travel allow immediate relatives citizens travel well.  trying trick us wanting go Europe? Oooh gotcha! Sorry!  every state nuance laws afaik. one cases go r/Teachers  Nah isn‚Äôt simple. Plenty people- included - don‚Äôt college degree wearing masks since beginning. unfortunately know plenty college education folks refuse. would say along political ideology lines, even isn‚Äôt completely accurate. I'm gonna call anyone I've seen unexpected sentiments coming couple familiar usernames lately say ""finger ass"" without blushing feeling overwhelming shame. context. administer 100 tests, 5 positive one week, administer 200 tests 7 positive next week, looks like cases probably testing more. legitimate argument isn‚Äôt actually worse, better measured. 

However, happening last 4 weeks we‚Äôve getting higher positive rates percent tests (like 2 4 6 9% positive) meaning isn‚Äôt increased testing, increasing transmission. ‚ÄúWe New Yorkers assholes caring assholes‚Äù - random New York grandma talking everyone wearing mask. Bullshit.

If govenor want restrictions, better get Arkansas order then.

Don't punish states Arkansas failure. Add please!  Serum Institute example single producer. many vaccine producers totally agree. although sufficient, stimulus money absolute least could us meantime. even throw us hand trillions corporations God knows 40,000 students due roll college town six weeks. They‚Äôve decided person classes, we‚Äôre testing 10% positive right now. president he‚Äôs rally 6000 people. great influence conservatives we're talking state like Florida, absolutely yes...and I'm saying someone who's spouse unemployed since March unable collect unemployment. good changed policies shit got bad. Whereas De Santos ignored information doubled opening quick state one of, state highest elderly populated state. Yes, Cuomo fucked up, admit mistake, changed policy reflect that. that's rare trait politicians That‚Äôs true. vaccine needs safety tested 12-18 months minimum prior general use approvals. Ok? America giant red flag? Suffolk county pretty much 99% rate I'd say. I'm genuinely surprised walk someone without mask. big take away reading places opening direct observations - many people utter idiots.

I know sounds cynical I've literally seen eyes day day.

Just today Costco saw people refusing free marks young kids. Zero social distancing store. know feasible police everything, rely upon efforts reasonable educated people. Sadly people far between. Yes quality life Europe would better years. longer, there's massive pressure PM make longer. far month time extended week expires. got cover too. One worker per station. (there 3) one server touches pair utensils. 3. US Scotland - although count EU travel ban point? vaccine arrives. Sigh. hoping visit France work next year :( debated years college pursue masters Germany try settle never did. Goddamnit regretting that. Next life, guess.
Cheers Texan actually following guidelines, taking daily vitamins, trying keep healthy sane insanity. They‚Äôve laughing since 2016.

Ah mAh ROCK, Ark.- Governor Asa Hutchinson announced Tuesday afternoon restrictions lifted recreational travelers non-hot spot spot areas considered New York, New Orleans, New Jersey governor said advised people areas considered hot spots want travel Arkansas self-quarantine 14 days get worth considering IFR fixed value. goes hospitals get overrun. true, coming back much experienced situation videos see aren‚Äôt wearing masks.

It's like Sun fucking Enquirer.

Yes, understand people hard time grasping takes little go sick dead. past week absolutely insane Florida far infection concerned, grim reaper gonna playing catch real soon. can't get herd immunity? Studies SARS, MERS, also Covid-19 far seem indicate immunity last long enough countries develop it.

We could end situation live manage it, end situation two sets countries, Covid-19 control don't. I've forced go back 40 hours two weeks ago. 8 people small area. okay put signs everywhere stay six feet away put mask leave desk... nothing coworker 2 feet away sneezing direction ü•≥ Even protests didn‚Äôt cause mass spread, definitely put people‚Äôs minds gatherings can‚Äôt bad 1000s people protest yell supposedly spread it.. media encouraging well weak leader.

I love way think. Would take one instead growing ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞) mobs chanting ""that's racist!"" yet? also exported like ten million masks January believe. mean unreal we‚Äôre going pandemic government allows exportation masks profit. Problem ""Hundreds millions"" might even good enough. billions people planet. need vaccine... 

Its feasible, depending ingredient supplies. all, coke produces hundred billion bottles coke year. we'd definitely need ramp production, might take year two really get going. Average time death infection 18.5 days.

Y‚Äôall risk fucking lives go shuffle chips play cards. It‚Äôs dumb. say wise dumb feel knowing ""China evil"" comments thread getting downvoted? Lmao

I guess CCP shills taken subreddit, right? Haha populists

What think word ""literally"" means? already acknowledged Bernie populist traditional definition word, point modern mainstream use word exclusively reserved right-wing populists. covid 19 hit them, Americans part europe used mocked others country asian paranoid, claim ""just flu"", point belittle asians 'savage', dirty stuff, thinking actually higher class human, playing modern civilization etc  yet coronavirus situation proves otherwise. offense Ah yes. antivaxxers, we‚Äôll never free idiocy. Small correction, Reddit isn‚Äôt left leaning. Reddit extremely liberal. Post non-liberal left argument it‚Äôll get downvoted too. Firstly, vaccines based proven technologies.

Secondly, I'd prefer take changes vaccine Covid. can't think cult not. 150 million Americans ages spread country. can't save ""it"" ""it"". 200 million much better. civilized country trump elected would removed office now. US culture problem going take longer fix us see lifetimes. know it'll fascists win fight happens.
I mean, they're gonna take control anyway, respect ""get Apocalypse with"" attitude, coronavirus sub, wishing death countrymen kosher. That's subs! Lol it‚Äôs like clockwork honestly:

Step One: increase cases due increased testing 

Step Two: We‚Äôre slowing down, we‚Äôre going move forward re-openings remove restrictions 

*increased number COVID-19 intensifies* 

Step Three: damn kids irresponsible behavior exactly told reason cases surging 

Step Four: Everyone social distance wear mask, we‚Äôre going enforce it. 


See guess ‚Äúleaders‚Äù followed blue print T. Mentally though, otherwise Automod remove comment would know read article. UK count Antibody tests number tests completed results, positive antibody test wouldn‚Äôt cloud results. 

The UK publish breakdown though - it‚Äôs *that* deceitful. look France, study showed 3-4 % people got antibodies corona , 30.000 people died.. (&lt;1%) well 65 years old suffering underlying disease. (There exceptions offc) like typical flue.

Numbers played with, blindly take it, present with. DYOR.

The cases presented media tested confirmed cases, actual cases. 

We probably agree, look different, that's ok. pretend know everything, draw conclusions, based perspective.

It's just...that overreacting this, that, alot people die, cause starvation, job loss, economics halt etc. 
Wich sad. hateful statement hope get help. Someone must hurt you. fair, idiots America. It‚Äôs idiots don‚Äôt wear masks should, rather wear masks don‚Äôt need to.

Masks public nearly always situations common folk don‚Äôt get dictate ventilation. Stores, workplace, etc. can, like home, it‚Äôs easy meet outside. way superior industrial AC HEPA talking - lurk conservative page many complain banned (downvotes aside). Fox actually consulting lawyers felt liability this. 1 case 2, rate infection would rising doubled. hope exemplifies metric alone useless. 


Ignoring human life purely capitalistic society like every US state reinforced, metric truly matters hospitalizations afformentioned stated spiked hard those. nah, that's silly generalization, thing chinese xx thought it. citizen journalists voluntarily went wuhan report truths disappeared authority. ceptu, do, be, think, do, be, think unlimited matter k Yeah family going Cabo month..... blame them. terrible job üò≠ many selfish people. infuriating. can‚Äôt force on,‚Äù said Arthur Emciuc, employee First Bank branch downtown Roseville.

Yes... can. enforcing shirt shoe policies decades.... Bernie AOC literally populists tho ""the peoples revolution"" ""people"" yada yada Biden Romney folks like em establishment public service politicians beer hot sun, waiting bus stop interview chipotle day. already outside hour half beforehand... true. felt like garbage after. one drink. don‚Äôt even like drinking depressed knew bombed interview :\^/

I feel like even street amphetamines easier body drinks. Sad even need say wait Wire India


Pure leftist shithole Yes ChinaFlu sub end January stopped going two weeks scared. 

At time thought we'd catch month two lots us would dead. people work thought even come UK. Eventually fears concerns met somewhere middle. couple people asked ""How know going happen?"" wanted know thought happen - exactly hard see information happening. 

It's interesting people could deny facts happening right last moment. Probably US would fewer cases someone competent would charge. That's different bans, that's people dislike opinion, censored usage word ever used describe right wing populism mainstream. Bernie populist using classic definitions word, today's populism strongly associated xenophobia reactionary politics. Bernie get referred ""anti-establishment"" though. Yes. think ordered beach shutdown specifically starting 3rd running 7th (Friday Tuesday). original claim wrong said. Staying home kids, horrible. wait Wire India unbiased. 

They know happening, know part India worst affected also know happening area ignore. 


Can't expect much calls terrorists innocent sons school teachers martyrs.

And Populist leaders, print Modi return third term bcoz populist communal basis work done ground Yeah do. Pillars 1 2 diagnostics, pillar 3 4 serology Anti Nationals best. witnessing Darwinism finest folks! stop spread instant ?

How many Delhi Mumbai's type red zone might created ?

Now migrants sent home preparing special trains keeping corona protocols mind. Peak? think Johnson badly. lot reports put 40% Belgian, I'm allowed Greece either. blame understand totally. also totally understand Trump banned European entry US soil start crisis. 
No hard feeling, global pandemic, people travel anyway. need politisize decisions. goes ways - anyone tries bring right-leaning argument (rationally even) r/politics they're pretty much downvoted banned oblivion. Reddit extremely left. UK break figures different tests, though: like told everyone Weston Super Mare local lockdown friends living confused local lockdown, one mentioned none residents informed. Iq less even know whataboutism is. hope cows can‚Äôt catch zombie outbreak actually happened, guess US part Europe doomed.  people Morocco still work home? post would appropriate r/COVIDProjects satellite images leave much desired though. massive increase that's show ignores new car park built, photos taken different days week, extra week national holiday week. That's extremely left leaning sub. probably banned violence. thought something like January. worst lung flu ever nobody else caught it. Curious international flights'll resume, got family trapped atm mention states majority cases. include article. news supposed unbiased. Present facts let readers decide opinion. else could expected 'The wire'? don‚Äôt know happened, means ‚Äútest dump‚Äù, cases jumped like 5k 9k exactly doubled amount tests reported, literally overnight.

Not downplay Florida‚Äôs current clusterfuck hell difference cases doubling test numbers stay constant vs. cases doubling testing doubles. america country zombie law applies state employees. big population, nearly going impact think We've back since mid-June (Bavaria- classes kids moving started earlier) split class two groups. One group classroom homeschooling. switch every week. absolute arrested doctors tried warn world.

and evidence virus may existed covered far back August. 

They ‚Äúright‚Äù thing eyes world watching. Yes know. Deaths definitely lag behind cases, bit cases least plateaued deaths consistently gone down. definitely seems like there's delay, like treatments getting better, detecting mild casesaverage age going down, etc. cases really started shoot like week ago, almost certainly see reflect deaths weeks, probably rise much cases will. Politicians get elected tell people need hear. get elected tell want hear.

Biggest Achilles heel entire democratic system.

Good luck fixing issue maintaining good parts though. seen piles BYD masks Costco recently? think Chinese companies sell vaccines US make profit. like BYD masks applies state employees. basically needle-less injector vaccines. history vaccines, none rushed year. typically take least 5-10 years develop fully test.

There several examples fast-tracking vaccines backfire. massive campaign vaccinate 1976 swine flu flopped disease turned mild, hundreds people suffered rare nerve disorder vaccination. vaccine used European countries H1N1 flu 2009 caused people develop sleep disorder full believer vaccines. got TDaP vaccine 2 weeks ago since wife pregnant, it‚Äôs better get vaccination whooping cough protect babies.

However, Trump currently desperately trying ram vaccine sole purpose getting re-elected, don‚Äôt trust hair guys wig. elect stupid offense zombie outbreak actually happened guess America doomed rest world especially Asia handle better..not world apocalypse except america like movie lol I'm tired lol true, makes virus even problematic already is.

It means people appear fine may carrying virus, even smaller doses. means longer fine alarmed coming contact sick people, alarmed coming contact people.

Which likely explains masks appear proven defense, social distancing hand washing. Situation requires empathy highlights psychopathic traits people working job attracts psychopaths. Read it! That's start screaming spreading fake news horse shit. Omg much eyeroll. Lots debate masks USA yet see much mention technique common Asia...which constantly checking peoples' temperatures.

Is considered waste time public health experts? Looking US example, people decades decades remove electoral system replace something little bit better, either woefully ignorant ones willfully support it. majority people may voted Trump, support system created him. Newsome allowed it. Populism originally pro-labor anti-interventionist party wanted focus average citizen, elites. also necessarily countries, felt could help others without caring ourselves. become co-opted uninformed like term ""Communist,"" often said without ever reading Manifesto itself. Everyone listed inherently pro-elite actively parts world guise ""populism."" like saying China actually communist, brainwashing already succeeded. Wonder learned dismiss literal physical evidence fake news... Notice Fl hospitalizations headlines anymore? Tx seems thing. everyone saying Fl smudging numbers really cute :) anyone image graph? come? Wife yelled young waitress Olive Garden offering house wine. placed coin table. know.

Best quote. teachers training full time job someone else‚Äôs mild inconvenience? lot PPO networks, fee schedules, usual customary billing. pointing messed two similar visits ER two different types insurance, two types insurance pay different amounts. 

For example, rotator cuff surgery area person group health probably cost less $20K. Work Comp surgery, facility fee, physician fee, anesthesiologist fee going run $55K. Meanwhile, kids haircut place masks on. Period. Plenty parents same, see ones about. school childcare unavailable, think every single parent see would kid tow, that's case. us chilling home kids ordering curbside, waaay past cabin fever phase pinky brain territory. apologize rest. I'm seeing lot ""what mental health kids"" talk now, think valid point I'm best keep everyone safe maintaining level sanity without touring Target toy aisle. probably wait bit see actually real world benefits.

Take Massachusetts - they've already something like set awhile, websites listing prices hospital fees costs. Turns - almost nobody uses it. People go particular facility based word mouth - mostly doctor's word mouth.

An elective surgery like shopping groceries. price disclosed pocket amount, depends insurance have. (Although forcing hospitals disclose cash payment option front good thing.) there's whole lack choice thing depending circumstances going for.

But fine, let's say accident knees/legs, still conscious transported ambulance. google hospital prices... procedures?? ""repair nonunion/malunion tibia w/o graft""? ""osteotomy tibia""? Maybe procedure ""prq skeletal fixation tibia shaft fracture"".

Turns required disclosure *useful disclosure.* reliable. Well considering beaches Colorado I'm going disagree here. curiosity, Floridians know seriously 70+ retiree demo taking covid threat? sheltering place part? avoiding restaurants markets? assume many transplants high enough income order online use delivery services stay isolated, away crowds. tough us millennials. got shafted, second speak told quit whining, bootstraps, yadda yadda yadda. got blamed everything. live world, future world, undermined consequences actions ignorant, selfish ""elders"". parents boomers, love them. jesus christ, absolutely stupid beyond belief comes many, many simple things. need selfish pricks, that's defining trait generation...

Good lord public education failed country. Call child's pediatrician, probably give best guidance.

I went Saturday morning took mask like 5 people 50 foot radius me.

Its acceptable risk since:

1. area hit hard yet
2. study 
3. go hours
4. interact anyone high risk category
5. high risk activity do, like twice week

At least that's justify myself. good mentals though know Chicago going live theater, music, comedy vaccine. think NYC less restrictive, going years arts return. Also MA. home working since Mar12. I've yet witness mask-denier. Well, one time went NH something. Seems like deniers there. care. yes gains important me.

One could argue going work puts risk, people making money pay bills important enough risk it.

Everything nailed comes flying one direction eye passes over? shit comes right back direction. answer question : 2.6MM people watch Fox News daily. content shared millions via social media channels, described. Fox made decision early underplay virus weeks, spread unfounded rumours dangers, discourage preventative meaures, directly leading greater infection rates. evidenced article's linked reports Harvard studies rapid spread right-leaning areas, degree Fox viewers took preventative measures. say largest conservative media outlet country nothing spread virus, spent weeks telling viewers platforms ""hoax"", deny truth front you. 


This say Fox alone guilt. believe media outlets sides aisle share blame. CNN also downplayed virus early days, fearing panic. However, say sides thing mean everyone innocent. means everyone guilty. Even everything ends getting closed except businesses selling food(excluding restaurants etc) might end mandate **only** sell food combat this.

So Walmart would take everything food shelves, it'd drastic would cut people going people would able go food literally sell anything else. I'm baffled mask refusal people.

They want punish others going along denial.

Some Trump acolytes well, following madman pretend utter fool. avoid evil CCP claims, U.S. military gave bunch vaccines approved general use troops going Iraq. side effect profiles contributed Iraq casualty count would acceptable civilian use. rationale risks casualties biological warfare worth side effect risk individual soldiers marines. mom thing me. lawyer able get removed mortgage, could prove coerced.

Both parents financially abusive. pretty infuriating, probably never actually home everything done use get money themselves. MASK POLICY?! Wow. They're operating assumption send kids option. IMO they're wrong right. probably needed government something landlords well, still pay mortgages properties receiving rent. mortgage freeze would benefit landlords well every homeowner mortgage. Similar [ticked (note: swearing) outlined - freeze mortgages 6 months tack extra 6 months end mortgage term instead interest 6 months grace period. Everyone still gets paid, paid later.

Right whatever rent paid due next month. 3 months rent paid, month 4 due 4 months rent. furloughed 3 months possibly going come 4 months rent month 4?? Logic. eviction moratorium goes effect, property owners going shit creek. holistic solution required. Plenty people skip flu vaccine it‚Äôs flu see 20-50 million infections year.

So, one baby seems cost million, give take. might realizing people wear masks economy really toast (or carbon remnants toast).  Seriously. We're running country ground listening other. I'm chaotic neutral try be. Wear mask, also recognize deaths stagnant month we've made huge advancement treatment putting thousands patients nursing homes. lean left feel weird saying media absolutely garbage. That‚Äôs indoctrination works. Fox primary source info nothing else mattered. Especially ‚Äúfake news media‚Äù. used get small doses I‚Äôm gym. Tbh draw didn‚Äôt know better. 

It‚Äôs tragic news became 24/7 entertainment last 30 years.  Then, yes, have. scientific organization present facts theories. definitely actively mislead part strategy (regardless fundamentally good idea keep masks first doctors).

We solid proof masks prevent infection, although looks like countries found benefit them, however due shortages encourage population self-isolate instead using masks preserve availability health professionals.

See, hard communicate \_the truth\_. No, problem populism almost always leads policies actually work play well public. example: ""Let's build wall make Mexico pay it"".

Populism also completely corrupts discourse cause leads fanaticism. idea one person one lead country inti prosperous future. AKA everyone wrong except me.

And finish off, populism almost always ends distancing pragmatism. seeing here. need pragmatic pandemic. almost populist leaders aren't. 78mm, you‚Äôre classic example uninformed barking bs refuse face reality. Soaking head bucket ignoring what‚Äôs actually happening going benefit you. 

Maybe don‚Äôt know anyone who‚Äôs contracted COVID-19. Well, one best friends Switzerland placed medically induced coma 40% chance ever coming coma. coma 8 days. effects recovery easy lasted two months. 

Get head now. COVID-19 serious. I‚Äôm going expend real effort wouldn‚Äôt accept real facts. chosen spoon fed bs completely disregard anything confirm existing belief system. 

You offer credible citation claim flu. 

Here‚Äôs site factual information. Don‚Äôt worry getting concerned numbers, look trend charts right. click state see specific trend. even get county level information. doubt you‚Äôre even going look factual evidence threatens belief system. 

You claim you‚Äôre healthy, that‚Äôs awesome. assume you‚Äôre getting tested multiple times per day, every day, sure health. Let‚Äôs hypothetically say missed getting tested one day come contact perfectly healthy people transmit virus you. 2 3 days become symptomatic spreading virus others. prepared deal eventuality infection pass ends death deaths others? Maybe don‚Äôt care others, you‚Äôre choice, bringing closer home, planning deal infecting family member, significant other, friends results hospitalization death? mother, father, son, daughter could victims. 

I‚Äôm going respond you, feel free reply moral responsibility playing unnecessary part deaths others.  Pretty good death toll? That's terribly high. Based data, seem like Florida get close death numbers NY. Texas well. Perhaps combined. American said start booking flights 100% capacity starting July 1. Apparently, United Spirit already so. AaaaAHHAAHHHAHAHHHHHAHHAAAAHAHHAHHHAahahahahahhahahAHHAHAHHAAHAHAAHHAHAHHAHAHHA AaaaAHHAAHHHAHAHHHHHAHHAAAAHAHHAHHHAahahahahahhahahAHHAHAHHAAHAHAAHHAHAHHAHAHHA AaaaAHHAAHHHAHAHHHHHAHHAAAAHAHHAHHHAahahahahahhahahAHHAHAHHAAHAHAAHHAHAHHAHAHHA AaaaAHHAAHHHAHAHHHHHAHHAAAAHAHHAHHHAahahahahahhahahAHHAHAHHAAHAHAAHHAHAHHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAAahahahAhhahaha It‚Äôs insane.

Right, apart he's *totally* great job. Deaths declined lockdown bimbo. Karen scream top lungs like banshee: ""You‚Äôre fucking Demo cratic pigs, you!"" medical breathing problem precludes wearing mask?

Get real LOLOLOL! That's dear leader level lying right huh? agree, title clickbait. actual article decent though. trying shore administration/reelection prospects. Trying move needle bit saying, ""but look, adult room!""

Nothing see here. People see something can't understand jump conclusion must fake. arrogance. Genghis Khan‚Äôs conquest Eurasia. r/politics absolutely horrendous sub anyway, dozens subs serve purpose politics given on. nobody born, don‚Äôt want contact ever rest world? Even god given right mask god given right shop given business. wearing mask protected class. One one hand, yay?

On other, WTF?! I‚Äôm Toronto, mask usage close 100% everywhere people together inside one space. lot stores won‚Äôt let without mask, plus dedicated staff wiping commonly touched objects (like carts). anything. get kick it, whatever reason. Okay good luck. safe know.  supplemental reading program using? Would love recommendation. Us them, US v. Them. says it, wearing mask room full people. look same? That's sad, really still large portion American population thinks virus either real ""not bad say."". 

Unfortunately city live large portion people, police chief live even encouraged people wear masks...so stupid. nations would exposed also free press. 

There nations good job... Huh? would look bloated budget..hmmmm. US states implement interstate border lockdowns like EU members done earlier March? I.e. ban everyone else coming New York state, recovering. U need study history more. Four months since appointed lead task force.

Who could *possibly* imagined Pence would miserable failure choice husband sings he's fixing bottle baby. ""It's milky need now!"" lol Lol. get know? Animal
planet? suggest watch science videos Khan Academy YouTube. fear slipping people simply choose live way

And people die. unfortunate, right. blame lack federal/state/city leadership want, dozens articles scientific reviews shown wearing masks best social distance easiest ways reduce spread virus. People stupid, lazy, selfish. Without strict governmental controls (fines, arrests, forced long-term lockdowns, on) feasible way get average person bare minimum protect around them.

I'd say hope we'll use example future learn grow, know that's lie. Wasn‚Äôt few. tens thousand executes. shows power compounding happen two hundred generations. Title misleading, reminds ""Nobody could seen coming."" People talking attacking endothelial cells months. blow quote representative article. (and decent summary).

Plus always forget go someplace high risk cloth mask, like hospital baby's physical therapy. old people follow guidelines. dare reddit smater common forks there! /s Maybe never, depending long antibodies stay system much mutates time. Yeah, it‚Äôs feeding frenzy. Dizzying, exhausting, self-defeating. slow wake up. caring people dying.

that's people work Even two lower r0, rule idea they're nothing cough cough

Might want get checked out. thoughts exactly, every Nebraskan catch twice? read somewhere patients ""see"" since faces covered PPE Memphis, see wide variety troubles me. Definitely higher 30% days places. see people Sprouts Whole Foods mask Kroger Walmart. also see probably 10-20% wearing regularly minimum, another 10-20% wearing *properly* *100% time*. Literally saw man take mask sneeze last week. People take talk sometimes. lot people, including employees, nose sticking out. So, depending crowd, 1-2 5 people wear mask properly, all.

It seems like combination ignorance apathy, opposed straight opposition. people know masks work wear one half hour grocery store. people know care learn won't. shame given day, latter upwards nearly half shoppers. that's also Tennessee among shameful states skyrocketing cases absolutely correction. do, spend time raking forests issues data too. estimating ~10x infection rates compared confirmed cases, absolutely makes sense timeframe blood samples taken from. 3/23 4/10. basically hospitalized sever symptoms, direct contact someone traveled Wuhan, China get tested time.

Tests became much accessible later, places around country. expect 10x number hold circumstances.

Again, need better data. supposed get married fiance (both American citizens living USA) Malaga Spain 5 days. Obviously happening anymore things started spreading outside China pretty much new screwed. took bit self denial officially called American federal response strategy ""see evil hear evil..."" became apparent new going problems.

When called off, right Spain start spike. much worse USA statistically time knew right away size US sheer willful ignorance world renown going botch even long run. 

All guests time worried catching plane foriegn country caught it. Obviously one main concerns older relatives caught came wedding (No one wants grandpa die direct result wedding, sorta gets things wrong foot in-laws) logistically practically knew something like would happen country responded. predicted exactly bad would screw country (we far exceeding expectations) know would....

TLDR: supposed get married spain canceled saw shit storm coming mile away knew USA would epicenter. There's excuse point still PPE. blame Europe. Despite living one harder hit cities pretty fucking liberal mandatory mask requirement, people still constantly make shitty comments folks wearing masks. Ruins us give fuck part. Would nice people could remove heads butts instead pretending virus stupid conspiracy. ooops! anyone's gonna start world war anytime soon gonna anyway going PSAs people describe hell went through? really think religion Sikhism cult? We've made top Reddit many times recently feeding thousands admist lockdowns worldwide. What's cult like lol tHiNk EcOnOmY I'm hoping first step citizenship kids. Weve living US last two years. youngest even America Well tell people living pay check pay check basically may home livelihood this. think maybe best thing right masks, social distancing, curbside delivery, take out, holding opening big venues. I'm sure job gonna let use w.e. mask want use tbh. also doubt mall gonna open public maybe I'm oversee curb side pickups etc. I'm assistant store manager. Idk see. That's good news then, death rate much lower current estimates. Hospitalization rate lower also. I‚Äôll honest know people traveling Florida Texas week don‚Äôt seem worried all. Update they‚Äôve posted photos beaches restaurants wearing masks all.......wtf I‚Äôm glad watched subreddit early daily. Soon jumped China two three neighboring countries, started planning worst early February. 

As read pandemics, got right, got wrong based learned.  got hazmat suits...probably waste, however also got N100 masks hand sanitizer, able share family friends. knew valuable would become...

Anyway, Thank Reddit. personally I'd rather wait least year 2 see vaccine side effects. Normally vaccines take 5-10+ years develop, right we're trying rush vaccine thru end pandemic could either go well bad. think they're trying spread knowledge complications sequelae wider audience. Now, even running shit dem nominee, don‚Äôt see win Trump.

I've heard before. surprised see USA worlds hotspot much time prepare compared EU. Federal govt lead choked response states forced choke. states reopened early making mistake mistake denying plain old science public health directives. hope right Nov 2020 brings end circus along power washing senate ... lost popular vote 2016 well. cronies going play tricks sleeves. Add me. Australia Chile. hemisphere, side world. Met AU fly back outbreak thinking safer there. dead wrong Gov. Jim Justice

That's badass name Texas 2nd populated state shy 29 million people. Florida 3rd populated state almost 21.5 million people.

The difference population density. Due large size, Texas population density 40.6 people per square kilometer. Florida, hand, population density 121 people per square kilometer. Yes. fucking military, need use it.

Enough enough months prepare.

...and didn't. entire problem? Damn, really hope american truly hoping pandemic kill many fellow countrymen forces society crumble (with thought would come would better...which, btw I'd give good odds - think things would better society collapses... lives least). Resign. It‚Äôs way get country learn. family pulled wife healthcare job aren‚Äôt going die y‚Äôall‚Äôs stupidity. imagine Brazil also. turning continental pox party apply refugees status?  Anything skirt responsibility.. bad numbers, doctored reported cases death fits perfectly pattern peak decline observed neighbours. complete idiots would that.  even retaliation. based active cases / 100k. US gets limit, people allowed again. directly targeting them. Sometimes credit. Georgia governor tried force Savannah open beaches, locals rallied said no. really going put damper European vacation never planning taking first place. Uh...there plenty people wearing masks NYC. Also streets completely empty, stores closed. literal streets look like ghost town making millions dollars week. know area well. lived Greenpoint 10 yrs. stay safe. suck idiots right outside building.  Economists warned lockdown would devastating people's livelihoods, yet we've ignored pressing concerns pandemic. Similarly, doctors position say time lock open up. speak health implications, that's one (albeit big one) many factors must considered. many polls people flat said would circumstances take proven safe effective covid19 vaccine. We're talking third nation type numbers. European living America, fuck.

Best wall immigration strategy ever :) GJ Murica. Americans live abroad?

One issues traveling Asia seem care country citizen of, you‚Äôre actually coming from. haven‚Äôt home country years. Oh look, exact *opposite* conclusion, surprise! People post old articles sub always pushing agenda.  ""No it‚Äôs wasn‚Äôt.... grown man, MURDERER playing stupid."" - Mezmo14

In reference to; words of? ashamed back up, seeing deleted comment? think assuming young person vaccuum battle hashes out, doesnt spread this, young people, like family members leap desperation flat lack leadership. It‚Äôs unbelievable bars opened up, sit restaurants opened up, barbershops, etc quickly hardly one appears enforcing masks worn times people using establishments. It‚Äôs hilarious see people like comment it‚Äôs protestors causing this. No, it‚Äôs people given ability go people don‚Äôt listen, see people flocking restaurants sitting crowded environments masks on. lack stricter leadership it‚Äôs honestly reason sped control. 

The government needs develop proper reopening strategy instead ‚Äúokay everyone open stay six feet apart wear mask‚Äù. trust establishments enforce rules one seems putting hard foot mask, service. go space? Ironic there's travel ban US I‚Äôm going call ‚Äúscoreboard‚Äù sorry ass. saying something fucked hard US. deaths / (known cases) = case fatality rate (cfr). get right denominator deaths adjust people usually taking longer die COVID get better it. number makes sense closed, defined population, there's enough time know outcome cases. Face it, current ""leadership"" country place, well truly screwed. time get competent leadership place...January 2021 earliest, county nothing Covid factory world pariah state trapped.

Stock lock loved ones much can. help way current regime running show, count that! Anything skirt taking responsibility. seem really good that. I'm really surprised EU courage it. thought nobody would. Now, expect everyone follow I‚Äôm sorry, exactly trying cherry-pick original statement? Read again. None false accurate current verifiable data. never said majority overall travel Europe. said majority overseas travel, make false statement. 

Furthermore, compare Europe US also make genuinely curious factors pointing stat concentration nations close together similar states US. data it‚Äôd actually cool see learn I‚Äôm serious. rebutted arrogant subjective comment give hint that, majority, many Americans actively travel outside country, many going Europe. Given subjectivity comment, subjective opinion may well hold weight least statistics help form less bias: Given expense overseas travel, course majority haven‚Äôt visited Europe, however showing many least outside country tourists, it‚Äôs easy assume majority would given financial opportunity. compared sophisticated enough arrogant annoying statement time waste replying to. Could ask refund since passport fit purpose intended?

""This passport garbage! even let US need valid visa depart can't get one ruddy stupid thing "" dog ancient blind absolutely thrilled pandemic. Well catching do, numbers given Texas nothing lets get control. Brazilian president even believe covid exists Brazil's infection total might beat America end. lol. 1)I never said anything thread using prophylactically. Please put words mouth. 


Now since bring up, actually several studies US using HCQ prophylactically healthcare workers. larger ones shut although started several thousand participants, dropped either due getting ill Covid, getting scared possible repercussions taking particular medication particular fashion better information became available. smaller studies still appear active, although doubts ever seeing anything published them, since participation waning even them. reason getting stage peer review people want involved study exposes risks information available medication absolutely effect virus.



Thanks informing HCQ used worldwide malaria so, lupus, right. It‚Äôs almost like knew already. Like said thread, people benefits PROVEN outweigh risks. Going opposite extreme Tylenol example attempt explain understand, you‚Äôre claiming basically chemotherapy must dangerous since it‚Äôs used 80 years! people benefit it, mean it‚Äôs safe everyone.



You keep talking zinc. I‚Äôve met one physician disagrees using zinc (not got Covid either ‚Äî significant respiratory infections) almost sure you‚Äôre going I‚Äôm arguing using it. Like said before, even studies don‚Äôt mention zinc used HCQ, it‚Äôs safe bet unless specifically mentioned not. It‚Äôs pretty standard protocol, new idea. 



Bottom line far covid goes??  Zinc = good. HCQ = pointless (does nothing except increased risks) Knowing cruel universe year, wandering hermit probably catch malaria something.  Fake news. used n95 mask every day work, medical field. Literally pull straps tight don‚Äôt beard. n95s lower blood oxygen levels 99.9% people. people would need worry ones copd serious lung issues. special training propaganda mask shortages.  takes someone explaining make sure mask tight. Mediterranean coast Spain cities English German residents businesses neighbourhoods degree even speak Spanish daily lives. Florida - Hold beer. Yep, meanwhile since Melbourne, Australia's second largest city second wave, months getting thing control Victoria New Zealand zero community spread back 'normal' nationally.

Don't think that's gonna help Aussie economy much. Politicizing becomes ""us vs them"" elections believe /s.   

I accept downvotes plausible.  Fucking idiots. Especially one points people dying conspiracy usurp him. elaborate mental gymnastics engaging wind ""Thanks Dems!"" Enjoy death cult. perfectly reasonable opinion like voted, go back Facebook stay echo chambers can't handle someone offering logical intelligent concern. LMAO. Anything thewire automagically goes ignore list. Thewire, theprint, quint trio far leftist news outlet. Don‚Äôt let views get clouded biased reporting. vaguely remember Spain one countries get citizenship property ownership. I'm saying mentioned making lot money Ditto. Well said described situation perfectly. I‚Äôve keeping track given data beginning - keeping notes comparing data news county info. doesn‚Äôt add up. I‚Äôll also add thousand excess deaths state attempted suppress information about. would love investigative reporter actually dig this. guys realize he‚Äôs real doctor... one tell he‚Äôs real doctor?? üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Dangerous twit Yeah, she‚Äôs fucking piece trash. reason great idea vast majority people get sick die. Joe Foxnews goes says covid hoax gets it, odds fine whole idea overblown fake news confirmed mind.

The thing virus need super lethal disruptive, we've seen. need pretend covid get people act people know lied to. No, Bernie self-proclaimed Socialist. over-arching, comprehensive view politics agenda. Populism simply trying align government people without overarching philosophy. absolutely agree, attest people around saying abide it. 

Does mean shutdown protests? Businesses ignoring closures? Police involved enforcement? I'm Australia assuming Texas huge population due size, Floridas population? I'm curious don‚Äôt think third arm it‚Äôs worried about. Cancer main concern already nailed shut bricked over.

You might want look dzungar massacre cultural revolution. massive pitched battles streets Wuhan cities PLA Mao's Red Guards. Especially often desperate revenue. defense state government, kind let people businesses learn stove still hot considering rhetoric coming federal government. 

Everyone busy finger pointing instead listening doctors scientists wearing fucking masks. annoying. places grocery shop days, even early morning. I've still seen people Harmon's mask. Fox News disbanded years ago. disgrace media journalism everywhere. Eliminate costs.

Well, no. That's think means looking word alone, without reading it.

[The Wikipedia good job explaining it, recap: heart populism ""us vs. them"" ideology ‚Äì *us*, common people, vs. *them*, corrupt elites. matter populist billionaire, long portray *champion people* seen part in-group elites.

So, implies ""elites"" inherently untrustworthy conspiratory. That's dangerous many people dragged idea ""elites"", including academics genuinely know area expertise average Joe. That's populism often goes hand-in-hand anti-intellectualism ‚Äì populist politician promises average Joe need listen anyone nagging inconveniences like climate change Covid safety instructions. ""Those scientists know they're talking about!"" (Or: ""Those scientists lie they're paid to!"")

Populism also relies simple explanations/fixes complex problems. Anything bad average Joe's life? people's fault. Unemployed? fault immigrants taking job! immigrants get here? conspiracy elites, course.

Ultimately, populism mean trying popular, means appealing lowest common denominator general populace, lowest base instincts shared resentments. working fine, would become pandemic. Glad noticed! America many trashy people - huge proportion residents - course trashy potus, plus 3rd world social foreign policies - seen equal European countries. Possibly. Unless tou teates everyone protest there's way know. lot due home transmission immigrant families gatherings ""The E.U.'s announcement incredibly disappointing, step wrong direction seek rebuild global economy,"" U.S. Travel Association Executive Vice President Public Affairs Policy Tori Emerson Barnes said. Interesting. Houston's metro pop. 7 million, though. Could account higher expected hospitalization rate? Also 98 ppl per 100k based average, higher rates groups people risk. Could seeing form higher rates areas older possibly obese people? Europe gets vote. Good job. Yes. wear wrap around shop glasses, sealed goggles better. plane would. guy pulling punches. clear masks need n95 well(which never enough over). Yes, wear damn mask stay f*** home. R/politics supposed unbiased. can‚Äôt complain conservative subs that‚Äôs entire point. Practice make perfect. surgeons great. Nice put downs too. Start argument strong. remindme! 2 months  really don‚Äôt think guy paying attention. vaccine widely available January 1st, we‚Äôll certainly near herd immunity late spring. point 75-80 percent country either taken vaccine caught virus.

The people won‚Äôt get vaccine ones masking downplaying virus. They‚Äôll get next 12 months wear mask. I'm liberal lol. I'll look tomorrow wake up. World leader ass. Every country cares itself. That's world live in. maybe police brutal idiots solve problems. ""Except smoke pot. we'll hunt like animals are."" hurt Maybe Japan soon allow Europeans?

Because OP's article mentions Japan EUs list

The article also says list may include China China allows Europeans, mean Japan allow Europeans included list? Florida Arizona YOLO 'bout whole thing.  


Who knew phrase would still value 2020. many asymptomatic people actually virus hiding cells, akin HIV know behave.. looking immuno epidemic coming years. seem angry confused clearly need help understanding this.

First, CDC says 98 100,000 people need hospitalization. means positive cases need hospitalization. let‚Äôs extrapolate numbers.

In US, 328.2 million people.
3.28.2x10^8 / 1.0x10^5 = 3282
3282 x 98 = 321,636

Seems pretty low, right? go look right wing media outlet. keep repeating, ‚Äúit‚Äôs less 1%! It‚Äôs less 1%! It‚Äôs big deal. Ignore it.‚Äù

Too bad already 125,484 DEATHS US. 0.6% death rate means 20,914,000 people infected. population 328.2 million, 15.69% population exposed. 

But I‚Äôm bored work COVID hospital, let‚Äôs take better look CDC data looking age demographics. 

Kids 18 0.3 per 100k hospitalization rate. 
Ages 18-35 3.9 per 100k hospitalization rate. 
Ages 35-50 9.7 per 100k hospitalization rate. 
Ages 50-64 148.6 per 100k hospitalization rate. 
Ages 65+ 297.6 per 100k hospitalization rate. 

Can calculate averages? I‚Äôll help. It‚Äôs 98.4. 

According US census estimates population age 2020:

There 63.16 million people 50-64yrs old. equates 93,856 hospitalizations. 

There 52.42 million people 65yrs old. equates 156,002 hospitalizations.

This clearly hits older people harder younger. ‚ÄúBut reaches 3%! scary!‚Äù

Remember estimates. tool hospitals reorganize facilities house maximal wave hospitalizations. 

The TMC link decent evidence hospitals better prepared big wave March. first graphic shows number total beds available who/what filling them. 414 cases ICU - generally meaning they‚Äôre ventilators. OP, error missed 1106 COVID patients sitting outpatient/converted surgical rooms. still active infections, they‚Äôre critical condition. 

While COVID waves need planning preparation, standard ICU patient flow still needs go on. big difference COVID ICU beds standard ICU bed occupants COVID much preventable minimal effort. 

Additionally, MASSIVE point conserve-tards can‚Äôt seem grasp massive range outcomes living dying. 

Yes lung issues big one. Scarred lung tissue leads recurrent rounds pneumonia fluid leak danger tissue. 

There‚Äôs growing evidence neurological issues associated. Seizures, prolonged acute viral meningitis, neuro-vascular issues like strokes become common. 

Blood pressure regulation doesn‚Äôt always return normal, least right away. causes issues kidneys, eyes, heart &amp; lungs. 

There‚Äôs also evidence suggests pancreas gets damaged. Enjoy type 2 diabetes. 

Providing links make argument stronger don‚Äôt understand data within them. But, means, means justify don‚Äôt need wear mask... go it. Risk health sake righteous online post. stay away better people.  COVID deaths US way down. That's good news.

 actually making excuses guy shouting ‚Äúwhite power‚Äù trumps retweet villages Florida. 

And wonder people think racist No. think what's happening ppl going something totally unrelated tested positive. hospital COVID19 COVID19, makes sense. would also explain seen spikes deaths, even though ""Texas hospitalizations surging"" headlines going since June 4th average infection death 18.5 days. seen something now.

This article lead believe FL hospitalization headlines disappeared Atlanta here,there far free testing places now,than past months,there literally 2 within blocks house.This could another cause number jump.but get kind handle actual numbers got beat.seems bottom line. going step up? thing disability. go screaming throwing fit business asks follow rules. expect let want. calmly go someone charge explain disability would like accommodation. case able wear mask, would ask speak manager door ask could shop provide list. whatever part make easier help you. know this? disability.  


What woman throw childish fit feels world wants. always thought antivax issue joke, handful people shouting protesting. Guess wrong... WTF wrong wit Americans? boggles mind.

This never choice ""save lives"" ""save economy."" always ""save both"" ""lose both."" 

Europe, Japan, SK, Australia, NZ, places outbreaks less control reopening getting economies back operational status people feel safe go socialize drink again. 

In US? ""reopen"" plenty people go massive death tolls economy still shitter. Certain Party bungled taken seriously, America could reopening. we're not. pretty complicated core, different animals different vectors different diseases way pass diseases onto humans differs too. Look zoonotic diseases want know more.

From understanding (could wrong though) less conditions susceptibility factors. could look management cows/pigs/chickens mad cow disease/swine flu/avian flu epidemics curious arose managed. Honestly, meat industries treat animals pretty poorly (conditions ect. regardless people believe) matter bamboo rats breed pristine environment not. vector covid19 (i.e. Carry disease affected it) pass onto humans, get passed regardless conditions (although evidence environmental stress ect. cause animal vectors like bats shed zoonotic diseases readily). It‚Äôs side effect cocaine misuse hallucinate American, can‚Äôt say blame one bit. response far many ‚Äúleaders‚Äù country absolutely god awful get go Maybe difference UK Johnson got infected? ... they‚Äôll come work sick doubt. fever (assuming employer checks) good go. Everything else ‚Äúallergies‚Äù anyway. Probably availability masks. shit hit fan Feb. entire world short ppe----hell, nobody even *knew* proper self prtection would help nobody idea spread, long stayed infectious surfaces. Gotta say it... riots. media show that. mean vaccine works China using strengthen military? see would approve faulty vaccine? account new create post Houston 

KTRK-TV: People crowd together downtown nightclub COVID cases think Step Five is:

Hey, heard herd immunity?, lets (smirk face)

And proceed remove restrictions. Hmmm, isnt vaccine production methods shared published? then, pharmacy companies particular region one setup production line produce people? 

So, unless government pharmacy block vaccine/prefer vaccine, else would issue distributing vaccine. Well British too, may perfect actually worked quite well. numbers fell dramatically. see lasts. still open? UK bars, restaurants, coffee shops, nightclubs entertainment venues closed 12 weeks. US made mistake following rest world, trying tell everyone locked sooner harder.

They didn‚Äôt, locked regions cities. amazed even New York seeing highest numbers US, still allowed golf courses operate. took long shut things down.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* don‚Äôt report doesn‚Äôt exist

/s Yep. People want ""both sides"" problems, COVID clusterfuck United States solely due one side reduced once-reasonable party paranoid conspiracy group. Quarantine isn‚Äôt stopping virus it‚Äôs overwhelming healthcare system. quarantine would give time hospitals adjust needed, unlike ICU‚Äôs hitting 100% capacity go again. Many people decided over, we're pretty much back normal. bullshit meter half bar tables. airborne virus travel meter disappears. well said, Poop Steam. Jim Jones still alive today hed probably taking notes. Yeah... show claim deemed invalid? I'm seeing data. guy cussing read report. probably start attaching photos ppl. saying official numbers trumped receive funding attention something?  largest slum i.e. Dharavi control I'm saying death rate likely similar flu. effects symptoms same. Agree - American executives chose send manufacturing China call center/tech support India boost profits.

Separately, forced tech transfer hacking, China Chinese companies make knock offs, cutting American companies out.

This current US government lazy coordinating PPE production hard work. Maybe interest rate cuts help? certainly implies data suppressed, untrue, probably title changed article updated. implication probably accident either, clickbaity. federal government need meddle lockdowns whatnot. unwillingness *anything* useful ridiculous. They're support. could've supported dragging feet testing infrastructure, procuring PPE, funding states public offices (USPS, USCIS), financially assist people directly. nope. Lets let states go bankrupt, bid PPE, actively try stifle testing ""the numbers look bad"", print trillions dollars actually distribute people organizations need it. actually share line thought. thimo numbers finally get tallied actual death percentages vs. infected super low. though, without mass testings cannot compile data. Like stated state, dead tested. since free testing done compare numbers? cant---not enough data. tested ones actually felt sick enough go tue hospital it. Shit, bet isnt even 1% people suffered like would flu. decided make false statement claiming UK (where live) deserves Johnson echos majority. expect people react fairly insulting completely incorrect opinion. don‚Äôt want argument don‚Äôt make idiotic statements first place. Ahh see, bitter lying cunt since pandemic started, get blocked tinfoiler, talk yourself. Career politicians need politicians. Official DoH policy test _everyone_ close contact someone Covid+.

Here's thing though: 90% tests actually turn _negative_ results.

The idea asymptomatics major spreaders fact disproven over. ones spread symptomatic. 80% cases caused 10% symptomatic cases specific conditions.

As example: church choir US ONE guy cold infect nearly 90% choir. Two eventually died.

Meanwhile asymptomatic Chinese couple attended packed church Singapore back January.

A grand total 3 people 200 became Covid+. That's basically 1%.

Don't afraid asymptomatics. ones people look ones coughing sneezing, especially mask. Oh, you‚Äôre bringing back flu false equivalency?!? Let repeat: like flu!!! Meanwhile I'm getting permabanned /r/covid19 pointing long term damage patients article.

Those moderators agenda, purely scientific. never happen live world, course, god, want him, DeSantis, Abbott, Ducey, fucking enablers hang. Literally. sort mass murder perpetuated populace 100% deserving death sentence. saw unique statement reference

The United States places one-sided emphasis political civil rights.

This one difficult things societies outside West understand. Political civil rights Western system ""negative"" rights, ""negative"" freedoms, ""negative"" rights. freedom), is, want ""free"" something; government can't anything me. freedom person, freedom speech, freedom assembly, freedom religion, etc., advocated Western societies basically belong category, limit. rights government. West believes rights fundamental, ""inherent"" inalienable human being, possessed individual. rights, possible guarantee rights benefits (e.g. economic rights, education rights, health rights). may even argued full political rights citizenship sufficient condition rights benefits (efficient (condition). contrast, economic, social, educational health rights ""positive"" rights, ""positive"" freedoms, often resource rights. , requires empowerment government available individuals. Similarly, category affirmative action, requires different people, regardless class race, access similar resources rights (equity). same, requires society resources government intervention direct limit distribution wealth resources. modern Western thinking, rights considered secondary. Western system, references ""human rights"" often narrowly defined, referring Political civil rights foreground.

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, Americans believe government cannot restrict personal liberties citizens, difficult enforce segregation, limit population flow; Americans believe government never access individual's privacy - health codes, tracking trips via real cell phones. Nothing like creation big data network possible; government cannot restrict individual's freedom religion freedom assembly. see conflict security epidemics freedom religious assembly, judges prefer protect latter.

&amp;#x200B;

In United States, individual freedom highest level right, fundamental ""human right"". Whereas vaccination treatment medical field, resource-based, lower-level benefits (not even rights) cannot used to... Interference destruction fundamental ""human rights"".

&amp;#x200B;

This fundamental value, fundamental ideology. saying Internet Americans ""free dead"", indeed reflects fact extreme cases, ""freedom"" ""survival"" things matter. ""There conflict them. put specific individual, specific situation, think everyone rational definitely chooses survive. larger values orientation society favor individual's right freedom ignore individual's welfare (especially welfare collective), consequence led state ""better die free"" whole society.

&amp;#x200B;

We understand Chinese talk billions people eating ""right live"" totally unacceptable Westerners. cognitive system thinks eating right all. right live belongs pigs. believe long people given political civil rights, problem billion people eat. deeply rooted idea.

&amp;#x200B;

It's say anyone wrong China West/USA. completely different worldview. death total us europe? correct. see people Fibro Lyme Disease lot told head never taken serious something want believe takes place. saying Corona real never take anyone serious many things like Lyme Fibro. sudden come list tie Corona symptoms years labeled something like Fibro, Lyme. expect us trust know went doctors basically gave us medicine depression anxiety. know sudden causing symptoms decade. Ahm. No.
ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Step Five: Hospitals begin reaching capacity, news picks up. Governors urge citizens wear masks stay home aggressively. Still enforcement.

Step Six: Case growth still growing rapidly. Hospitals crisis situation. people getting concerned. Governors pressure impose stricter measures.

Step Seven: Inevitably governors impose mandatory stay-at-home and/or mask-wearing order hospitalizations ultimately deaths start decrease again. Media reports: ""How could states seen coming?""

Or variation this, *I hope*. Link? gotta keep scary narrative going, right sellouts? 400 million barely blip.

Interesting comment considering hand-wringing thrashing saw much smaller events 9/11. South Korea cases ""climbing."" pretty consistent 40~60 new cases day. bad densely populated country 50 million people. I‚Äôm sorry, 0.01% population dictate way world works. It‚Äôs unfortunate, people would probably die virus‚Äôs. world afford isolate much longer. financial impacts would take lives lost people mentioned above. That‚Äôs reality, however unfortunate. 

I wish could help reality best that‚Äôs do. cannot cater everyone unfortunately. Individuals must take ownership. government aliens real, giant meteor going straight towards us. Indeed. coronavirus made even worse. Yeah, hilarious see comments. 2 ppl pointed irony headline. want 4 months back we're worse shape now. work hospital, never got break. Oh workload doubled past 3 weeks. make things even better, raises year. would love situation. I'm getting semantics reddit thread. misunderstood wrote clearly care 100% fidelity impossible reach, small percentage thought would good use keystrokes start argument. ""The land free"" willingly put situation, Trump echoes people wanted (Whether directly indirectly), therefore get deserve. End story. Bye Felicia. Mods: *Did someone say information?* 

*No no, said formation! See? Nothing see here!* Honestly that's real dumb study expect people Harvard publish better study counting cars parking lot finally buy Mercedes-Benz boyfriend :D However, Trump currently desperately trying ram vaccine sole purpose getting re-elected, don‚Äôt trust hair guys wig.

I think good litmus test seeing Europe does. zero qualms taking vaccine that's approved someone reputable. I'm position decide what's rushed vaccine isn't. thing china values different not, value matter what, disagree things communists propagandize etc ""urges""

If truly wanted US citizens wear masks, would stated clearly press briefing Coronavirus Taskforce Today's generation lucky get grow old! nearly ***four months***.

On top fact supposed ***THE FUCKING GUY*** that's running Covid-19 task force. 

You know, guy that's seeing information. talking experts (supposedly). 

Fuck administration. understand facination identifying waves. started comment. gave name.... begins. Probably worst populist all, se√±or hijo del blue demon think US fall pit hole opposite china did. China impose lockdown, US dont that. China urges citizen wear mask, US dont that. China contact tracing things, US dont that.

That's politics get fuck away science. leader populist? Fester die then.

States bar state owned medical aid regions refusing enforce measures meant counter spread. get create diaster drain much needed resources areas supposed too. Oh whoops.

We‚Äôve worked hard IL get stage 4 reopening. 
I fear everyone‚Äôs gonna blow last might resurge like dumb states south. missing exposed virus mean specific immune system fights thus learns again. Maybe got low dose virus able start multiplying, maybe general immune system helped little.. corona patient infects one six members household. highly infectious mean everyone interact gets infected. Feels like writer trying axe n e r back tying p p u l bad things attempt establishment maintain power scaring people.

""The top 30% earners pay x e help bottom 70%"" p p u l idea.

C p e r v e inherently p p u l empowering coop members. coops great, higher satisfaction, less income gap, etc. actually took hydroxychloroquine preventative measure...yet refuses social distance wear mask. made decisions yet.

Honest question: perceived risks associated rushed vaccines/rushed production? likely risks? know visa valid past certain point? final year university leave suddenly left lots belongings behind. Summer session starts July I‚Äôd like get things, visa expires September. would month long session past expiry date. Oh good Physics PhD, books racism, declaring fake pandemic.

Peer review gonna lit af. people morons know voted. Youre correct, small literature coming coronavirus may indeed cause mental ailments like encephelopathy. misunderstood me. saying Wuhan virus outbreak use ""digital artificial intelligence"" beginning.
Wuhan's health QR code launched Feb. 22, month city closed. baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id= 1659225983350927100&amp;wfr=spider&amp;for=pc
The new cases Wuhan February 22nd 541, highest number confirmed cases Wuhan single day 14,840 February 12th, exponential drop new cases use call ""digital artificial intelligence"". read early thoughts vaccines alter way immune systems work. careful, vaccine could work well corona class viruses, but... would wipe ability deal flu common cold. Basically gain security something hits every hundred years lose ability fight something hits every year.

Not sure confirmed was. key take away, wait safe. side effects far worse society virus.  time next president office way easier contain virus since good amount people already immunity. one cares Bill Gates thinks made laugh hard. peds notes exact reason. 

Also I've rolling eyes country question months. Ruling 1.4 billion people already hassle. CCP top officials already rich enough. 

They probably got scared shit Jan/Feb thinking people would overthrow government incompetency handling covid inevitable recession.

But ended Boris Trump saving ass. essentially happened Western Australia. want kids educated public school must prove required vaccines. private schools allow many. Visa, move problem. Funny mention that; we've reached 500 000 year yet.

Do math genius, even made number off. concur Central NJ. Unfortunately, reporting Shore alarming.... even social media feeds it‚Äôs bewildering see folks blasting ‚Äúbend curve!‚Äù memes couple months ago posting photos gathering large groups friends maskless beach.

I'm confused ER, become ICU nurses take care patients inpatient holds floor opens bed. Hawaii US. It‚Äôs ocean, duhhh! Fox News helped kill ten thousands Americans Unfortunately votes still count. yeah succeed flattening curve back March? fair: defender free speech, think every community accept everyones free speech.

That said: Trumps tweets marked, course they'd shout ""What free speech?!?""  comment made wonder computer software good analogy. test it‚Äôs release, every user every computer different, always issue bug fixes almost immediately release. human body million times complex computer. exposed EVERYONE are.

Perhaps hes ready throw trump bus yeah incredibly unhelpful dishonest. ""If stop testing, we'd little cases"" going advise masks time, too? edgy Eh. probably wasn‚Äôt even going Europe time soon anyway. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs FAZ. They‚Äôll grow 16k official figures still denying community spread. Madison here. /: possible though?  amount actual cases could going reported cases due testing. hospitalizations deaths going that‚Äôs positive. It‚Äôs like he‚Äôs saying slow testing like Trump. So...global. politicians actually enough common people, would fine. means unemployment systems giving people enough money within week applying. Full healthcare coverage.

I know bunch people WNY stay home rest year got $2k month healthcare covered. Fact politicians throwing bailout money elite common peasant issue.

Don't get wrong - fucking catastrophe. slowly get better treating disease, US grows exponentially. Hospital systems overwhelmed. think learn stay safe better know lying pandemic. agree, require people stay within state school holidays.  Problem number patients get high, overwhelm health infrastructures point enough bed especially ventilator, ECMO serious case people less priority maybe die get treatment. However, Vietnam low amount covid patient, handful serious case resources concentrated cure serious patients like (that said serious case like uk, probably dead cannot spend much resources like that) It‚Äôs flu guys, go back work

Next time tell idiots asked wear mask prepare shitload unexpected crazy mask-lovers insist wearing mask anywhere go show 'free' are. things worse anti vaxxers. realize kinds scary ass diseases would freely ravage population pre vaccines.

There's famous Penn Teller video anti vaxxers hilariously explains even anti-vaxxer claims true (they aren't) would still easily choose vaccine. really see necessity, sure could probably help numbers Sweden lot even without masks. slower go obviously since mandatory lockdown would go masks game changer? 

I'm arguing strategy make clear, genuine question. [Nothing alarmed let's continue ignoring virus. CFR meaningless. IFR never changed.

Overall figures awful UK. restrictions worked put effect, seeing declining rates now. done far late, resulting way deaths elsewhere Europe. Deaths per capita higher anywhere else world except Belgium, that's ignoring huge amount excess deaths, would add roughly 50% more. That's much, much worse US now, although catch quickly.

Boris Johnson's government utterly failed efforts tens thousands avoidable, dead Brits show it. include Kompressor air filtration system?

Those disabilities enough difficulties navigating world without able-bodied individuals taking advantage selfish wants. suspect like Americas, despite early intervention like closing international borders early implementing lockdowns, sequence actions cases went lockdown sealed fate.

Their enforcement lockdowns different across different states, poor social safety nets meaning people cannot afford stay poor sanitation infrastructure means virus easily spread throughout community.

From seen, lockdowns consistent national wide, one area go lockdown, go order effective. seen Italy early days USA, almost pointless going freedom movement.

Oh sorry dijon mustard fucking sucks Obama. 

A Trump supporter would NEVER admit anything Trump best. get it. criticize everyone everything life.. can't criticize one thing ""you muslim"" ......seems exactly like something anti intellectual, bellend, bumbling fool supporting corrupt govt would say. thought neoliberal.

It's hard keep hashtags. predate Twitter Internet, that's - Labels get stuck things, nobody authority decide mean they're stuck right things. What? That's true. ""soros bill gates started this"" crowd also likely anti maskers. think thing me.

Obviously Trump gang useless, level shitcanery engaged absurd. Truly truly awful.

And governors? Florida Texas especially, watching really really bad disaster b-movie. propensity dissemble appears innate trying virus. absurd. 

The really concerning thing though: media reports get people getting worked 4x3"" scraps fabric risks mass death throughout communities. defies belief. children

That's oxymoron Get cases much possible, test many people possible, track cases cases continue drop, hold people accountable actively endangering communities, prematurely begin easing restrictions still enough active cases undo prior efforts sacrifices vain.

Also, article title. Technically, got confirmed.

Apologies, referring SARS 1 (SARS-CoV-1) No, that's why. studies different parts world, they're bug chasing. studies need active COVID vaccine regions in, prove efficacy. That's people testing places like Brazil.

Also, ""genetical"" word.

/s Billionaires got us insane madness. Fuck Gates hyper-wealthy. Tax existence. CA NY, seems get test pretty much reason. talking doctor friend Maine, said can't get tests non-symptomatic people. seems nuts. 
Here SF, heading 1% positive testing rate, tragically gone back 3%. son school right now, I'm fine that. read 25% positive rates Arizona, blows mind. Yes many people fail it. frequently see shit sub highly upvoted taken fact reality talking early preliminary study verified. 

And top that, seen shit like surveys phone passed scientific fact here. That‚Äôs Survivor season 21: Nicaragua runner-up Chase Rice you!

He bit jackass show managed lose one biggest (but loveable) doofuses ever survivor.

Anyways surprised tied this.

Lmao sorry I‚Äôm big survivor fan I‚Äôve always hated chase rice ""If hate wearing mask, really hate ventilator"" cases confirmed? Bullshit. They‚Äôre best preforming. worse. doesn‚Äôt matter many cases popping people aren‚Äôt dying true rate worse. So, corollary absolutely controls people age groups? Exactly this...most wars somewhere else. send troops, hopes prayers ok it. people never type people think government spying poll try act good. happenedddddd Nope. teach 2nd grade. It‚Äôs going nightmare. 


However suspect many parents keep kids home. sound like doctor who's sorta censured. 

Originally told vulnerable people stay home everyone else keep smart, wear masks hole weeks max. said walmart exposed anyhow. 

Other doctors folks charge happy. So, listened doc listen folks charge too. 

Now job, circle unemployed many know sick handful went hospital precaution. ER laid half staff, nurses unemployed bunch people go scared go hospital legitimate problems suffering consequences.  

Doc talk COVID anyone short terse answers. 

Oh, real shortage PPE. supply chain red tape problem. know warehouses full stuff access connections get out, they're 'in' right people. lockdown social distancing. huge spike new cases areas country taking seriously.

Shits get bad. one wants go America trust thing A'me'rica care about:

ME Anyone time stamp quote ?  went hiking today literally two groups masks besides family. one else masks.  fuckers even bow Hobbits saved Middle Earth. Speak yourself, obviously Melbourne. vitamin maybe? 10% 90%?

Half any, probably 50-75 percentile significant amount, pumping stock market help all. Even half people wearing masks, think difference would make right. 

I don‚Äôt know mean 50 percent wearing masks, go anywhere counts, like big box stores grocery stores, mask usage exactly 100 percent. Outside depends crowded is, crowded, 80-90. say outside need ten minutes close contact someone get it, simple passing stranger street isn‚Äôt enough contact spread it, actually seems like fairly appropriate response. mask usage isn‚Äôt enforced. US big place maybe area different. haven‚Äôt traveling lot lately all.

But really silver bullet, even experts divided see countries successful without them? Even though personally choose wear one appropriate, don‚Äôt get mad someone chooses to. experts don‚Äôt agree, judge? behavioral issues masks make less effective general public clinical settings. C'mon

Ya gotta get shell little bit! Eww Wire. 

I know countries bullshit comes India. J1had1 shit. trump politicizes pandemic, acted strongly instead, would ahead polls maybe. Borris done well politically it. mmmmm fuck yea Agreed. Let‚Äôs hope goes well work forces... thought 4d chess stuff internet joke?

Are telling Trump fans actually believed shit??? üòÇüòÇü§£ many people likely die total 2020 Covid ? Guys made bet 1 million die total. think win, told confident would bet even money. Please tell guys think ? probabilities opinion ? 1 million people die 2020 Covid ? already half million. Imagine thinking United States good anything except making iPhones. Agreed, trust rushed vaccine profit-lab. Oxford really money, reputation prestige important risk putting vaccine that's less ideal.

Any vaccine, non-profit/for profit/government/university/private/public source, tested exact way. matter comes from, data analyzed independently ten times released general public. think virus spreads people believe it? keep selling masks US vaccinate population work favorable arrangements nations. best guess, soldiers deployed China-India borders UN peacekeeping force, potential encounter Indian soldiers locals. many domestic places phase 3 testing. That's also testing Brazil.

It risky many unknown parameters (how long, strong, dangerous). point test domestically. Killer song. No, even french extrem right wing,Marine Lepen, wears mask public &amp; complains advised wear before. never , ever, took USA model pandemic. travel high risk states - fine. curb people making trips unnecessary. Hate say told so...... add Leicester residents leave city except essential travel thing outside Leicester know difference reliable sources crackpots, I'm scientist (although field related anything medical). whole system scientific research slow process *never* certainty. Tests research course years strongly indicate something safe, something works, case COVID 19 whole story. Scientists even cleared exactly spreads, well survive surfaces, whether antibodies provide long term immunity. Overall little known compared known diseases.

I'm pretty much always willing bet medical scientists say best research works that's far best bet, aware humans perfect, system scientific research far perfect, especially tight situation like one.

The two examples gave exaggerated caricatures Reddit likes pretend two opinions exist. point betweens. smart person concerned validity rushed scientific process without crackpot, guillible person trust incompetent malevolent doctor something that's best them. Well TIL something new english language. Thank you. appeared pretty good shit hit fan New York State (can't speak actions prior, really covered)

America simply stopped caring. People would rather risk sick risk bored. puzzled downvotes. got vaccines, kids (if future) get too, completely different situation.

I'm American. Yes, Ad5-nCoV well Oxford vaccine recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine. basically except two vaccines use different serotypes adenovirus carrier. It‚Äôs money need ...SHUT FUCK UP! Eww 'The Wire'. literal propaganda bullshit.

I know countries Wire India known bigoted Jihadi loving. often publish biased fake news comes India. lies often revealed authorities people themselves. 'The Jihadi-Liberal Ecosystem' that's keeping Alive.

Regarding Pandemic they've kiss-assing Delhi Maharashtra government Islamic Tablighi jamaat. vigorously defending Jamaat single largest source spread Covid-19 South-Asia. even banned Islamic countries. (Multiple threats even made media houses reporting Tablighi Jamaat started reference 'Single-Source' 'Specific Community')

The Wire tried pass fake NEWS (some called take back). even used months years old pictures Bangladesh Myanmar (in one particular case Photographer objected). social media even put years old video Sindh, Pakistan example Police brutality. 

Their attempt create fake news bad get D- score it. IMO things blatantly target audience Jihadis gullible-idiotic people worldwide.

The Wire also displayed blatant Hinduphobia months. even published fake news regarding Rath-Yatra ( tradition older Prophet cults religions).

Despite circumstances India handled Pandemic best could. could better Appeasement leaders, two major States respective hatred Migrants.

Delhi allowed Tablighi jamaat Markaz hold event (Tablighi jamaat quite notorious Religious violence Honour-Killing). also co-operated Jamaat Jamaat hid various Foreign workers Priests illegally, Markaz Mosques around country, hid information presence whereabouts. (Evidence Delhi Police)

The Delhi government central government already issued strict guidelines regarding Flights whereabouts. strict guidelines gathering. Multiple events festivals like Holi Milan, Ram Navmi, Barsaiti Puja etc. cancelled advance.

The Tablighi Jamaat later became single largest source spread Covid-19. Jamaatis Corona-Jihad well. Local well National papers, social media sites, viral videos etc; multiple sources evil actions Jamaatis quite visible. Even local people (Hindu Muslim) co-operated get arrested. One incident happened Patna, Bihar Tablighi Turkestan, China.

Some actions Jamaatis : spitting Public places, deliberately touching railing, handles, counters, coughing sneezing others, dipping fruits vegetables drain selling them, throwing stones injuring Medical teams, molesting nurses harassing staffs etc. (Multiple video evidence exists. Various FIRs registered actions taken respective Police stations)

Jamaatis Evil. Anyone defending well.

The Delhi(also Maharashtra) government stop there. cut rations, electricity supplies Bihari migrant communities. Fear misinformation spread. given false information made ply overnight Buses dumped state borders railway stations. Many notorious orgs also illegally transported alleged help State govts. (Witnesses' victims' statement)

This increased cases communities states later went tracking became difficult. handled well( could done better) Bihar struggled.

Meanwhile favourite vote-bank Rohingya Muslims( ask Rohingyas Sanatani community went missing) Bangladeshi communities stayed well Delhi.

Few Mosques even received very, generous gifts donations Ramadan. 

(Controversial) Even retired Judge(and BJP) objected alleged Delhi government trying change Demographic create another Kashmir.

Ruling Delhi government AAP probably blame Bureaucrats would probably get away. allegedly also behind Delhi riots (and murder Ankit Sharma Pawan Negi) people involved Instigating people, creating public mayhem extremely close AAP usual ideology. 

Evidences many already Delhi Police viz: Sharjeel Imam(speech attack Kaffirs, Police, Army, seperate Assam etc), Tahir Hussain, Pinjra Tod(riot-planning, organising, storing acid, Molotov, stone, slings weapons) Umar Khalid(speech create riot dring Trump's visit religious duty kill Idoltors). 

The Jihadi lobby tried blame Kapil Sharma (speech attempt create another Shaeen Bagh, whose organiser Imam issued murder riots threats local businesses people), heavily spreading propaganda news west editing Wikipedia.

Situation getting better Delhi Home Minister Amit Shah took charge. AAP still busy playing regional religious politics.

Describing events Maharastra long reliable source.

Muting Jihadis advance. Yes - voting trump way build wealth. sure guys didn‚Äôt recover - maybe invested instead always upgrading iPhone would Portfolio Well fact, recently Intra-European border closed tons paper justify travel essential service linked COVID fight.

It's petty unusual wait border, even unusual border police asking every car... Yeah, seem antibodies weeks studies suggest. might immune get reinfected, maybe serious case. comes 1:07 video. haven‚Äôt seen yet you‚Äôre looking kill brain cells great way it, gives great example Orange County CA currently starting see rise cases Lol Fake. never used boat offices extra ventilators wasted money on. I'm promoting certain kind mentality redditors taken, that's I'm downvoted. WHO, China, CDC, Imperial college model well every single model, wrong. so-called experts scrutinized highest order, otherwise they're experts can't answer questions. models based on? can't give answer. New York say needed 40000 ventilators tiny fraction ever used? nursing homes forced take covid patients? Fauci CDC early say flu bigger threat covid wasnt big deal? say early masks necessary? necessary felt need lie masks misleading regards models?

That said, mask, wash hands, stay home sick. basic common sense measures. we're it, agree also...

Take Florida example. population density Denmark busy criticizing Florida holding spring break opening beaches early, fewer deaths per million Denmark, lauding ‚Äúmodel‚Äù response. season changed.

Go Hawaii lol'd headline. normally get really bad migraines I‚Äôm sensitive light I‚Äôve got another reason. hope cuomo thorough talk public health peeps this. lot evidence covid spreads well via aerosolized particles HVAC systems. _do_ lot evidence covid spreads well via droplets spread air currents _caused_ HVAC systems. conscious airflow inside mall definitely reap rewards. Filtering air HVAC system? Maybe? little? definitely deal droplets spread air currents first. That‚Äôs true. relative humidity measurement 100% necessarily mean rain falling. means air holding much moisture given temperature. usa economic collapse yet. Sorry country going way.

Ferfal great blog economic collapse like argentina 2001 till present guess..though relocated different country.

Economic collapse means big big spike crime personally need protect deal ..among things. Yeah. One case. We're aware one. ppl every state basically killers withholding critical data public? Wow! ‚ÄúZero cases‚Äù? range! Masks proactive, reactive, though keep places epicenters future. phrase way, futa lovers, everywhere, trying buy American masks... Due really really stubborn people lot say happens state(WI), probably never mask order. Hell, town bar crawl last weekend, middle highest case counts per day we've ever had. like everyone cant bothered small things ""inconveniences"" them. anyone actually defend US health system? can‚Äôt people stay TF home??? thinking bed last night. 10 million less 3% population.. seems totally plausible, maybe even low well... Darwinism action Eh, fair could presented argument bit maturely.

Some Redditors came mutual understanding deeper conversational thread.

I suspect many people reflexively upvote/downvote based initial trends peripheral biases.

Its rare Redditor actually wants engage good-faith discussion.

I'll take thousand downvotes means engage one critical thinker. mean go late night absolutely one might ok. even I‚Äôd wipe everything used it. always women freaking videos/news, thought males wearing masks problem? 7% never must live South Well, kinda. definitely depends live. number MRI machines Iqaluit versus Toronto definitely different obvious reasons.

Source: immunologist/I also medical degree Actually.....it MAY prevent getting flu.  Seriously, even consider profit MAGA masks? guess small money compared shorting stock market..  96% audience must always ~~reminded~~ told saying open. UK clothes stores open pubs opening weekend. think gyms safe adequate precautions taken. clearly government decided getting pint important allowing children continue education, I‚Äôm hopeful. So, no. disagree OP, see point. Perhaps phrase ""very well"" would better understood terms variance expectations: Georgia well considering governor know presymptomatic transmission six weeks rest world. don‚Äôt play blame game. reality situation matter FEEL it, watching thousands people gather streets days end undermined lockdown entirely contributed people emerging homes.

Don‚Äôt worry, 70 days ago told people inevitably society face virus it‚Äôs far contagious can‚Äôt controlled outbreak severe. also said lockdowns remained would civil unrest riots. 

Now people surprised civil unrest riots undermined Covid strategy. I‚Äôve downvoted hell every step way lol. Waiting one assholes get fist sandwich! Yeah would super easy obtain passport. say, Greece might best place look employment according Greek friends. English skills I'd look elsewhere Western Europe. Good luck godspeed. wonder it‚Äôs different everywhere. 

My test came back 90-minutes. Save America! Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! 

-The US govt PSA campaign plastered media platforms.

Then could take credit curve goes down... know difference CFR IFR? death rate people 50 literally less 1% shutting things down. r/titlegore someone please take picture beach 4th see enforced    problem last LIFETIME economic collapse, forgot really important LIFETIME economic fixing. good comparison would LA county California. 4 million people 4700 square miles. 3200 deaths. 

I agree wearing masks social distancing saying New York trend setter hope mirror using factual information. Exactly, masks bipartisan. president wearing mask, encourage people wear mask. they've taken masks Massachusetts laid 200 800 contact tracers nothing do. 90% success rate contact tracing. working there, now. ##r/Sinus

In seriousness though, likely wants know state people acting like New York would pretty surprising, whereas Florida, par course. I‚Äòm even surprised... he?? Ugh Idiocy unaffected seasons. multiple factors. One big time lag, others fact treatments continue improve current crop cases less severe first wave was, testing capacity significantly better, we're catching much higher percentage sick. get excited America's reputation globally Trump. Apart Obama, created genuine hope worldwide future USA, almost everyone I've ever discussed travel 20+ countries living 4, thought USA danger world (whilst mostly also wanting visit).

Trump turned concern problematic joke. got incredibly much worse since Trump, can't even begin articulate well. constantly intervening countries domestic benefit already ensured people world hate USA, willing take money entertain tourists. bring travel nurses staff. NYC paying something like $12k per week travel nurses. addition VA hospitals deploying staff nearby locations hard hit areas. helps. Usually condos self contained. maybe HVAC common areas. Elevators. Receptionist could it, everyone passing lobby thus got it. Let‚Äôs say Trump‚Äôs CDC approves Germany says it‚Äôs unsafe. listening to? New York Tough!! üí™ see Aftonbladets headline much critical post link sub. actually kinda pissed Aftonbladet wrote way did. According CDC, 81% deaths 65 significant increase deaths would require lot old people get infected, appear happening. mostly younger people getting infected.

[Younger people factor surge COVID-19 cases, analysis People 45 made 42% cases Memorial Day weekend 55% cases reported since then, new USA TODAY analysis found. die soon get it, complicated expand logic - using fake numbers memory, read something like 20% cases 'serious' symptoms, 5% requiring hospitalisation. remaining 80% represents broad spectrum cold &amp; flu like symptoms, including sore throat, cough, fever, diarrhea, loss smell, gamut symptoms may indicate COVID. case, every 5 people wound hospital, 95 people disease need hospitalisation. Would curious see math exploring real world numbers stand - extrapolating spectrum known positives break cohorts. I'd curious even basic sanity test infection mortality rates explore real official numbers are. Eg - 500,000 people died COVID, 10M infections, that's raw global mortality rate 5% .... .... real number infections allowing tracked 15M. higher ?  real global infections 20M, mortality rate obviously drops, also 19.5M people immune disease become obstacle spread. intrigued understand read aspect. 
Thanks time, sorry question already posed. Weirdly, I'm interested data rational information, personally hate math, I've put anything stupid here, forgive me. became interested pubmed datasets relating medical science trying understand cancer (which beat). stumble upon thread, authors submitted addendum response COVID-19.

Now everyone Connecticut Rhode Island 'KnOwS RIGhTs!' demand barber open ASAP presentable pack Golden Corral like sardines first time months enjoy fine sit-down meal. think death percentages exact same, death caused exploding lungs anus falling off, we'd see traction wearing masks. okay ""let people die"", unless course disagree you. /s Nice reach pithy comment

I‚Äôm certainly anti democratic, quite opposite. Good elected leadership responsibility good governance includes listening using guidance expertise. 

What right many leaders outright ignoring advise clearly leading poor outcomes doesn‚Äôt serve anyone‚Äôs needs

Big government / small government canard used job specifically argue government bad. Yes much government , little, fundamental problem leadership serving constituents needs, exacerbated gerrymandering disenfranchisement. 

Only USA misguided arguments. pay services (efficiently?) provided private sector socialize loss privatizing profits. It‚Äôs time realize balance serving citizens, top economic pyramid. 

I declare whole anything unscientific didn‚Äôt mention right left (you filled )- that‚Äôs obviously issue moment current crop (not predominantly conservative politicians) Congress White House. mention way OT comment gender?!? Really? known, generally self limiting nerve disorder. 100,000 deaths nation shut vs 100 people temporary disorder seems easy decision.

There much information narcolepsy one manufacturer vaccine showing 4x increase children. concerning, still unlikely outweigh benefits. going change seat belt laws encourage, require seat belts? Wearing seat belts seems less necessary since negative consequence wearing seat belt affect people. Also, seat belt disturbs freedom. CEO Scott Kirby said social distancing impossible planes anyway; even empty middle seats, people less six feet away other.

i mean.. point (of sorts...) 10 (?) feet virus shedder jet, seat space going help. 

If MUST FLY, wear mask whole flight - touch face / eyes, sanitise hands, drink sealed water using sealed straw ditch it.

I fly, don't.  responsible - act intelligent manner. Minimise risk. It‚Äôs crazy long disease drags on. mild symptoms develop something couldn‚Äôt ignore, lasted 1-2 days. felt fine 2 weeks. lungs absolutely burning terrible chest tightness. US lost credibility leader long time ago. falls started Bush jr. work security mall it‚Äôs job enforce state mandated masking impressed level compliance. 99% people entering already masks, 1% don‚Äôt readily accept one hand out. 

The issue people don‚Äôt put fully cover nose.  Homie literally anyone investor, download robinhood buy stock that‚Äôs $5 boom you‚Äôre investor. instead driving beach

Now they're going drive beach that's outside area. anyone point what‚Äôs happening Texas Florida? cautionary tale. victory.

Trumpists hear Trump saying ""Wearing mask sign person like me.""

They hear Pence saying ""Wear mask"" Doctors tell truth, politicians tell want hear. napkin calculations correct Blekinge 17 cases per 100K per week week 26. It‚Äôs going interesting see Denmark opens without provide negative test result. Europeans trusted Trump (at least, outside far-right populist parties), many thought election unfortunate one-off mistake, actually much (be due checks balances due barking dogs seldom biting) basically US's position world leader would back perceived normal. seem realizing thing serious though. Ah, ""assume"" fine way making ass u me. Especially US government involved.  looks like Minnesota got stuck bill geese, least get honorary Canadian citizenship? can't wait hear China's fault. Good point. Also \~20% new cases people coming get isolated immediately, actual community spread numbers lower.  Wear mask, numbers worse new daily cases ever before. think lead deaths stupid idea. Wear mask asshole. hope die. Valid good point. They're priced badly need alternative death. now, US airlines require passengers wear masks duration flight. However, problem people wanted drink water eat personal snacks airplane snacks/meals flight, could take mask that. What's even point then? eager allow trigger happy police solution studies repeatedly show prevention effective? importantly: common people give damn. Sounds like you‚Äôre one rich millennials think recession sale stocks real estate, way become billionaire. Fuck leeches like kicking families streets. normal person doesn‚Äôt love recessions. someone fucked head does. heart disease. Car crashes. Suicide. Murder. flu interesting seems incomplete. Also probably lot universities actually going open irl classes happens July. people keep pointing lower death rates (for now) seem Abel grasp fact don‚Äôt get positive test result immediately fall dead.

Test positive. Get worse. Go hospital. Get worse. Get ventilator. Get worse. die.

So yeah, deaths lag behind confirmed cases. It‚Äôs done worldwide, it‚Äôs happened US, it‚Äôs still happening current increase confirmed cases. Take still way go unless want McDonald‚Äôs great ambience. go **fundamentally wrong human being** asked take simplest precautions protect people somehow intolerable imposition? Please do. grandparents 90s enforce masks arount grandchildren they're idiots. Sorry blunt, birthday horrible idea. Go check Dave Blake Twitter. He's simple modeling similar (I assume). He's statistician GA hospital biomedical engineering PhD.

His work 10 day rolling average calculates population density. thread directly related hospital capacity. Hospitalizations lag cases 15 days deaths 27 days model. uses adjustment confirmed cases actual infected based test positivity. actually lines well YYG model covid19-projections.com

I'm guessing could projects based actual protected infections based growth rates. Implement age adjusted IFR based infected hospitalization rates state, go straight simple IFR.

Either way, good work, I'm interested really seeing shift now, leery won't. Things like

* still test limited deaths lower testing many cases?

* mortality lower know much i.e. four disease phases? 

* really seeing age shift infections we're allowing younger tested? (I think latter) yet see PSA, really anything, Asa encouraging use masks saying going encourage use masks. ignorant prick! .... grown man needing crowd boost confidence? liberal hack  NY also moved recovered people long term care likely fully recovered spread long term care residents.

Some rookie mistakes like likely killed hundreds more. Add lack testing nursing home/LTC employees due low test availability, you‚Äôve got tons deaths nursing homes NY NJ.

Being ‚ÄúFirst‚Äù sucks every way. Interesting. English speaking countries?

My theory many conspiracy theory sites floating around English languages. again, Australians Canadians reaction masks? Yup disgrace? numbers disgrace to? numbers great considering schools partially open again, businesses never really closed, SK never locked down. never compared West, brought West numbers look phenomenal. simply commented article used words ""climb"", really numbers seen significant increase weeks. Life begins first breath, according bible. can't kill something that's alive.

Also, ""pro-life""? support death penalty military operations *overseas*. Reddit removes comment critical China potentially abusing coronavirus situation. collapse health care system. everything that's around exact time implemented it. stupidly decided follow Texas, decided close. deaths would even higher. bat probably enjoyed talking tourists Florida right now? considering many people recovered Covid bunch long term effects chronicaling journeys YouTube, yes?

The COVID positive sub wonderful job showing people many complications months they've officially recovered. 

However, walk example. know one potential outcomes, especially cases double lung interstitial pneumonia, requiring double lung transplant. unfortunately rare least initial infection. We've seen process take months 

These people live rest lives that.

This true people survived strokes heart attacks.

There's one young Broadway actor contracted COVID. permanent lung damage, amputation, several strokes. survives, he's documenting it. eventually, expect research does. 

Most studies focusing long term health consequences many. bulk research understanding virus beat it.

Although I'm optimistic we'll see studies. first last active communities r/amiugly r/amiuglybrutallyhonest? idk, think continue diversification like still end working Walmart 60s. cards stacked you.

But that's still apparently hard millions people. Billions, probably. clearly demonstrated mental capability understand cause effect level. Climate change MUCH harder understand, observe, agree on.

I speak everyone position speak everyone. every department.

When piece together concerns, hear:

Mask mandates require enforcement hospital staff, especially work security, may placed situation they're forced enforce mandate. Beyond that, there's concern mask rule used lieu actual shutdown. there's concern PPE shortages. sanitation department worried mask litter - people dispose masks way health care workers - creates risk.

They want settle half assed measure still makes job unnecessarily dangerous. Yeah, Nashville, TN barely shut down. employer spouse's employer let us work home, we're required return. Even though nothing changed, new case, hospitalization, death counts gotten worse, employers, coworkers, neighbors acting like nothing happened. fair know anybody who's really ""ignoring"" advice....that's got judgemental tone it.

Having said that, got back cross-country trip (funeral). Colorado/Kansas/Missouri back. guess *maybe* 5% Americans ""on road"" (this along I-70) wearing masks all. half people working places wearing masks, half one nose chin (i.e., useless).

Many papers published past months explained differences herd immunity achieved vaccination, herd immunity achieved infection. latest puts herd immunity threshold 43%, though estimates ranged 10% (20% probably realistic lower bound) 50%.

Note numbers assume mitigation measures all. Even America's abysmal mask usage limited social distancing, effective R drops significantly, pulling herd immunity threshold even lower. given 5-10% US population infected already, may far herd immunity even without vaccine. Even 50% vaccination rate 75% effectiveness rate, insanely conservative estimates, would enough carry us well herd immunity territory. simple truth time vaccine available, we'll likely herd immunity anyway. would cheap Silicon Valley. shit's PRICEY here. link said need testing. some. larger scale prospective cohort studies needed assess whether presence correlate protection pathology. it‚Äôs not.

""In firm‚Äôs Phase safety study, 108 people got one three doses vaccine. people developed immune responses, measured levels antibodies cells target spike protein.

But scientists make distinction antibodies simply bind spike protein prevent infection‚Äîso-called [neutralizing believe developing neutralizing antibodies crucial step bodies must take prevent virus gaining foothold first place.

CanSino measured concentrations neutralizing antibodies prevented virus infecting human cells grown dish. 75% people received high dose 50% people received medium low dose vaccine developed levels neutralizing antibodies deemed high researchers (*Lancet* 2020, [DOI: one knows levels neutralizing antibodies needed protect SARS-CoV-2 infection, explains Dennis Burton, immunologist Scripps Research, levels induced CanSino‚Äôs vaccine ‚Äúare overwhelming means all.‚Äù

 virus here..not going away anytime soon.

A lot freedom taken away.

Folks cant handle this.

Lives lost.

Time get creative,and find things safely.

Stay safe everybody! Well, somewhat agree you; mistake... forgive Fauci still trust listen understand motive lying time. let's say right Canada acted late? explain current outcome? Almost everything opened right parts Usa shutting again.

Another Canadian here. I'd also say that, *at government level*, acted late. travel bans, *especially* blocking travel USA, incredibly delayed huge source spread COVID-19 throughout country.

Having said that, though, government reactions incredibly well handled started put place, even late. Additionally, lot people taking action far lockdowns put place, much better support government throughout lockdown (compare CERB Trump bucks obvious example), province also taken good local action ensure lockdowns lifted quickly (EG Calgary delayed 2 weeks behind rest Alberta phase 1 reopening ensure spread restriction). Due better personal-level response issue better governmental support shutting down, able far effectively reduce spread disease.

At personal governmental level, we've handled far better USA, hence better results, mean government responded fast could, have. don‚Äôt know lot it, know covid-19 barely impacts health children might mean symptoms. may also less likely spread virus, idk sure. Netherlands kids allowed play sports together basically close contact other. haven‚Äôt heard anything wrong kids infected.

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Correctional detention facilities face unique challenges detecting mitigating transmission SARS-CoV-2 infection.

**What added report?**

Testing among quarantined contacts patients COVID-19 correctional detention facility identified high proportion asymptomatic presymptomatic cases identified symptom screening alone. Approximately one fourth cases found serial testing quarantine.

**What implications public health practice?**

Early detection isolation persons COVID-19, along testing close contacts, slow transmission SARS-CoV-2 correctional detention facilities. Serial testing, particularly close contacts patients, important complete identification cases prompt public health response congregate settings.  I'd like know truth, come across anything verified confirmed, I'm ears.    hundreds variation swine flu circulating around world ever year, reason gets attention China Seems right say line, said useful. Learn read, please. think simple solution problem mean correct. Moving might something easy you, easy everyone. Try expanding perspective bit vomit useless suggestions. Yes they're increasing  morticians sales year. Okay I‚Äôll say doc. Remdesivir doesn‚Äôt seem useful preventing mortality, like you‚Äôre gonna die Covid you‚Äôre probably going die Covid regardless take remdesivir. decrease length stay, maybe personally won‚Äôt benefit. let spell situation see how/when would benefit:

We‚Äôre hit hard Covid, hospitals capacity, supplies running low enough hospital beds. situation, remdesivir extremely valuable patients backlogged hospital, less people able treated front end. it‚Äôs useful drug move patients hospital quicker don‚Äôt run space. 

In situation, see doctors prescribing everyone hits ICU. It‚Äôs ok, don‚Äôt mind kind stereotype like African American won‚Äôt feel offended stereotype big dick March 19, 1907, Mary sentenced quarantine North Brother Island. quarantined, gave stool urine samples three times per week. Authorities suggested removing gallbladder, refused believe carried disease. time, gallbladder removal dangerous, people died procedure.[25] Mallon also unwilling stop working cook, job earned money other. home own, always verge poverty. 

Next up: *Covid Karen* also think many travel countries.
Not real difference pandemic wise (there might safer destinations) sure country feels ""safer"". probably mitigating factors makes outdoor activities (protest beach) safer, including ventilation, sun light, space socially distance, really advised increasing exposure people increasing correlated activities outside (gas station trips, drinking bars, eating restaurants, shopping). Honest question. even possible american states institute border controls limit movement people american states?  Thats said lack better term. used covid-18 express possibility endemic precursor variant covid-19. possible thing exists, would relevant terms studying disease origins. Exactly this. whole point OP makes Florida look like nice beach great weather amazing alcohol anyone like can't find good things life. Sure there's lot enjoy Florida, forget life Florida different rich retiree lives Pensacola. 

I thought using term Happiest States would little less depressing instead mentioning fact 3000 suicides year rampant undiagnosed depression growing mental health crisis. You‚Äôre right two sides are. sides people - ideologies. People individuals think behave homogeneous ways. even do, even hateful, even hate me, still deserve life love. It‚Äôs false equivalency. human am, even think trying deprive health freedom. change everyone‚Äôs mind love turning cheek? Probably not. you? reckless make broad generalizations group people. Surely protests nothing spread amongst young adults. massive solar flare away Apocalypse bingo point. Perhaps also people need careful careful we're aware beginning. disease mostly spreading younger people current surge America. old vulnerable people Europe avoiding public spaces certificates compel employer allow work home. Almost certainly latter. also likely devastated actions led deaths people knew closely worked with. economic system inherently cruel. heartbreaking situation. Dr. Fauci looks like gang banger on. graduated Master‚Äôs degree. laid internship June. ass home nothing. Waiting unemployment kick in. young people home unemployed trying die COVID education. (Saying ‚Äúwe‚Äù friends situation) keep seeing tho tourists people driving get ratchet beaches. whatever fuck right, left 8 years schooling behind know. Stop 2020 WTF Hospitals fought it, can't bad. know whether vote down. 

It reminds 20+ years ago California TV news reporter broadcasting location say "" would especially bad place arsonist start fire"" wildfire season."" Tiffany Trump you?? owned house rent apartment. Renting lot cheaper much easier. Landlords aren‚Äôt getting something nothing. Middle aged people blame. 41 year old specifically. initials R.D. wag finger bloc least likely vote them. sure article fear mongering, I'm also going gym. daily number cases live 15 right (200K people), outbreak. go 6 pretty easy social distance. Everyone also wipes equipment use (they're sanitation stuff everywhere). negative I'm ultra conservative country literally one wears face mask. I'll stop going though cases start rise again. know gym smartest thing virus going issue next year least, think Sweden actually correct strategy. wish we'd get state wide mandate masks. People around going wear unless they're required. go hospital this. work community clinic they're free. known lockdowns. what? No. That's 400,000 people required hospital treatment. Like explained total number infected 10-15 times higher. Look! blind deaf person using reddit!

(Sorry actual blind deaf people, mean associate person) Okay, see point, consider factors would impact cost. However, still think we're something wrong people charged much way knowing ahead time. agree people downvote people cause different opinions. downvoted constantly subs though disagree here. 

Just voted though I'm grossly voted.  tendency american mainstream political discourse blame individuals systemic failures exactly we're mess lol. Let's take step back self reflection. sad true virus care politically honestly don‚Äôt know either. confusing times. much uncertainty world feel like emotions roller coaster. am, rather getting reduntant goes effect next month. also live States matters much things expensive Shame told everyone asymptomatic risk spreading virus ""VERY RARE"", back track late. Worst PR move history. I'm 34 idea owning stock retirement fund actually pretty comical. is, sense laugh cry. already know never property. car 14 years old nice guess. health dental insurance speak costs well $200 month job horrible Band-Aid coverage.

All I'm actually management company. imagine bad everyone else. ? y‚Äôall always gotta portrait China like this?
They tons volunteers lining eager help sakes nation. 

You know every country like western democracy majority thinks right? ‚ÄúT cells type white blood cells specialised recognising virus-infected cells, essential part immune system,‚Äù says Marcus Buggert, assistant professor Center Infectious Medicine, Karolinska Institutet, one paper‚Äôs main authors. ‚ÄúAdvanced analyses enabled us map detail T-cell response COVID-19 infection. results indicate **roughly twice many people developed T-cell immunity compared detect antibodies in.‚Äù** contributed nothing useful discussion.

Lol

Ah yes, OP cant find work decent work city 12 years. Mentioning moving option super line huh. Haha reddit never change. Large public gatherings outdoors little mask usage sight? could seen coming work federally qualified health clinic they're free. test people day long.  live around popular area Boca Raton. see hundreds would determine ‚Äúat risk‚Äù demographic adhering masks social distancing. fact, get dirty looks evening walks I‚Äôm wearing mask deliberately change course avoid coming close contact someone. NY nursing homes? Wait, United States pay money get Covid test? 

Do guys pay traffic light pull too?? Bars usually ventilation system, recylces air enhances spread covid. Outdoors this. way bar would truly safe outside  Maybe 1&amp;2 weeks incubation time. Gileads first hep c drug cost 75 k us 900 saudi arabia, central American countries. mean. There‚Äôs protection 0. 

A lot population data suggests 20% regions start see protective impacts Bullshit, nearly everyone ragged anti-lock protests people wanted go back work month half ago. included. BLM given free pass. thousands gather one spot care indoor outdoor, another group able same. understand post indoor particular care one group gathers groups gather. thought June. guess goalposts move time perpetually wrong. get saying. widespread earlier testing makes wonder. I'm really curious far along Florida (and TX, AZ, CA...) NY's trajectory. even worth comparing two since many factors like population density knowledge virus make big difference. 

What would best metric compare states NY? Hospitalizations? Estimated infection numbers based % positive tests? want better understand actual magnitude what's happening Florida data seems frustratingly incomplete... Fauci isn‚Äôt running show? He‚Äôs said numerous times üçäüë±üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è listens enacts advisories. healthy would smarter assume could asymptomatic carriers meet outdoors masks distancing. way even need tests. fuck going also death rate seems high. Seniors sedentary, already compromised, get sun extreme risk. No, would contact someone infected ofcource. T-cells develop, antibodies could, without noticeable symptoms. would still get covid someone. Never understood boomers blame us everything lol Yeah indoor dining insane me. I'm also Hudson Valley town shutting main street Thurs-Sun entire summer restaurants put tables road stuff. Went ice cream place town last night (which always packed) getting anxiety crowds even though attempted control it. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs important separate scientific discussion everyday practical advice. Scientific discussion considers possibilities, everyday practical advice based what‚Äôs likely. Murphy (NJ) this, Cuomo kind already. tri-state area governors trying identical plans one state ease restrictions sooner 2, causing people 2 flock opened state. that's something 100% would happen around here, especially NY/NYC NJ.

Seeing happening states think wise halt opening indoor dining now. thought 7/2 (for NJ) soon imo. would ask much owed said cane probably try take back payment.

That said, think middle ground could‚Äôve suggested cloth surgical masks, instead blowing face coverings altogether.

PCR tests still miss \~30% people virus lungs longer nasal passages. Unless need make decision treatment, quarantine work, there's much reason get tested. Waiting longer testing really help (e.g., Germany) people recover clear virus, small fraction still detectable viral RNA noses. Antibody studies (including estimates NYC) give information many people got virus without ever getting tested active infection PCR. still catch everyone, early course antibodies yet mild illness (or poor adaptive immune system) generate detectable levels antibodies. fraction missed antibody tests varies somewhat among tests, numbers still debate. Consensus still good antibody tests detect people recovered infection. Confusing things antibody tests also detect recent infection coronavirus common cold (e.g., April results Santa Clara Co., CA).

If afford put away even $100/year. worth long run imo. key make sure money literally never pull out. Considering lots people can't survive even 6 months unemployed, unlikely they'll able follow truly saving retirement. need tourism dollars badly, island also extremely low infection rate right now. second wave opening early, island‚Äôs economy could destroyed permanently. We‚Äôre hard place can‚Äôt afford shut much longer, got second wave island would nail coffin.

Ugh. hate say this, half coworkers already assuming county enforce, consequence, saying BS.

We've extremely weak restrictions states; California New York best vague ""essential"" business is, left stores limit people wanted (most don't), restrictions visiting people. live pro-Trump area Illinois, people wear masks tons businesses stayed open. decent lockdown (not comparable lockdown) we've drop cases, we're seeing numbers spike again. I'm also near Wisconsin (seeing big spike cases), completely reopened month ago one wears masks social distances. 

The lack national policy huge problem here. DC example reopened restaurants limited table size four people; Illinois tables spaced, Wisconsin (like many states) acts nothing happening zero restrictions. restrictions movement, many people cross states go bars/restaurants/shopping, bring virus back them. feel bad business try enforce restrictions, employees often yelled attacked (in case murdered) trying enforce social distancing and/or mask rules. lockdown much effective. job instead trying save economy rich peoples money would‚Äôve fine time. Everything incredibly obvious right beginning China country covid cases, blood hands poor leaders, shut fuck live? state don‚Äôt mind saying.

Grrr cats. Wait. Maybe. would pet gone? Yep. canceled membership Agreed. also thinking about.. happens vaccine? available right away, people refuse get it, maybe like 25-50% people get first year? then... restaurants/bars make people show vaccine card entry? Ok, people fake like driver's licenses? Man. Indoor dining, concerts, etc.. might dead long haul, joke. agree that's horrible thing say here's whatabouism.

 

We agree make parties example idiocy racism right? paddle boards Yup. parents worked harder could educate kids. weren‚Äôt lazy parents wouldn‚Äôt need teachers all. virus going ping pong North South, East West, Coast Center, Urban Rural... state can‚Äôt lock borders. travelers abide self-quarantine mandates? disaster.

Also people love comparing ‚Äúbut country got worse, smaller!‚Äù Yeah, word out, China locked fuck really severely. know!!! us worse option bro need worry Weird I'm expert btw, explaining understand it. oh yeah stop diseases.. makes sense.. hundreds people every state working identify infection epicenters. protests outdoors people wore masks spread infection- question settled now. 

If answer question ""why cases surging"" ""it's protestors fault"" jump huge rube-goldberg series logic arrive conclusion also ignoring simple (and correct) answer. 

Cases exploding people stopped acting responsibly. blame protestors suggests agenda.  Best Buy one first stores MA/CT border curbside pickup right shutdown happened. surprised efficient quickly figured compared stores.  Worldometers says 5400 ish far. sure report. Goddamn, Alabama disappointing state America? Seriously, even Florida *less* disappointing - disgrace. Asking doctor snarky? post alot, surmise profession, sorry. Ass. Bars restaurants way worse spreading Covid. Can‚Äôt tell /s misremembering. real thing anger behind it. Trump base aped it, vulnerable types low info shouting campaigns. time 'classic' GOP still control message. still lower numbers US... Yeah? Times moved colonial era. Lol everyone pisses ocean, ocean water half fish/sea creature piss shit anyway food thought. One best statistical indicators safe reopening could calculated infection rate per positive person. 1.0 means one person infects one person. social distancing thing rate calculated 5.0. NJ managed get rate around 0.7, recent spike south brought rate closer one, influencing plans gradual reopening. want celebrate freedom bad, let them, catch covid could get win freedom living us deal much longer. Montana 48th densely populated state entire country. agree mask mandates populated city centers, practically entire population Montana involuntarily social distancing. Baby boomers' economic pacemaker firing hard keep old heart beating. stagnation slowly drawing 401ks going immense younger generations investing market offset boomers withdrawing. Apparently also major PPE issues, causing spread hospital staff. Waited next bus first one came almost full. kind little decisions make avoid rolling back lockdowns. 

And you‚Äôre going wear mask, wear correctly, I‚Äôm start passing PSAs won‚Äôt locking anything back down

-All cool people think it‚Äôs big deal hate living entire planet Lol buddy sports going played. Nba season gueantee literally fans ""big ass fan company"" least don‚Äôt wear masks unless business requires it. Look hypocrisy breathe. Going beach? Evil. Going protest? PERFECTLY FINE again, took 2 weeks long... actually found one super nice steak places area fantastic, amazingly prepared, nearly cheaper Outback. last night. $48 steak feeds husband daughter, cooked perfection, USDA Prime. Versus $28 USDA Choice cut Outback them. I'm glad New Yorkers thing finally (some) control. state lot already. Let's hope keep numbers time goes on, 'cause people tend careless time.

I also hope countries states already worse kindly look rest us help much can. I'm holding breath that, hoping happens.

Good luck, NY. John Prine have. vast majority won‚Äôt affected this.. stop think 5% overly pessimistic. India skews young population curve, proportionally asymptomatic / paucisymptomatic cases compared full-blown cases would require ventilator. good number awareness standpoint, puts enough fear people get serious changing behavior.  even joke, I'm still playing Last Us: Remastered. People seeing rising numbers getting huge ‚Äúi told so‚Äù/doom boner. Like yeah, sucks, it‚Äôs hardly end days. feel like least people hoping another massive SAH order delay return real world months. article old still true suffer economical Australia much robust healthy economy us. also dig stuff ground. Australia one countries world recession 2008.

What need compare NZ economy would shutdown. predictions show economy stronger eliminating virus. live Jacksonville exactly happened last time. mayor moron. Outdoor dining working fine, dont see many people problem it. face facts certain things wont able vaccine  lots people. 400,000 hard grasp brain, imagine sealed 100,00 people suburb Houston save Houston metro.

Commendable book. also possible doctors become proficient treatment compared March April think thing NYC that, given much they've flattened curve, even *they* dont want open restaurants indoor dining... ever open vaccine? 

I'm advocating one way another, seems like implication. officials saying loud (yet). read table top simulations back like February. assume government done based apparent Clearly know eighth-grade homeroom teacher. Never said compassion.

Simply said better shut stay open let everything fall apart.

No need making shit people stick said. R2, shut down! Yep! I'm college campus took away basketball hoops, volleyball nets, etc many people gathering play (because nobody anything do). hoops still open crowded af. Beach bad. Packed main streets ok ask doctor at? Florida dun fucked up.  completely agree actually. 

Executive orders thrown around constantly, president(s) notorious this. would even worse Trump. necessary precautions baked legislation, like many things government simply ignored late. 

Although say think majority states thought best, really need feds everything. New York really prime example great state could responding pandemic. little googling would tell 39th largest GDP. again, might uneducated. Yeah else going give away 500 billion dollars companies don‚Äôt even need it. Cant group workouts they're unsafe want 22 sweaty dudes running around hugging eachother games start? How's supposed safer? Literally look subreddit 5 minutes that‚Äôll answer question. I've said start, Trump took seriously, quickly decisively temporarily banned travel everywhere outside US instead China slow incoming wave got ahead everyone containment taking lead finding treatment/a cure, things would happened politically:

1) would election past couple months, without question. 

2) People would taken seriously screamed China. would made stance even stronger. evil China caused this, us strong Americans, lead even stronger leader, took care it, we're going go political offensive.

3) hammer home #1, could immediately start blanketing country trump-branded PPE. PPE worn real Americans.

This moment triumph, instead he's everything snatch defeat jaws victory. Grow backyard! start planting now, can‚Äôt wait see grow. Also make pumpkin spice lattes it‚Äôs complicated fun fall activity Human race USA. going respond continue sound stupid. downvotes, entertainment I'm bored morning. mind boggling. store offers service awesome. local Sam's Club stalls used except two people used regular parking spots. Unions pretend care members increases enrollment much money collect.

When actually matters, look themselves. Also Upstate NY person, go rural areas bars.and restaurants upstate.i..there simply social distancing, masks worn, cult alive well..it rural areas rest US, even rural areas states whose rates dropped. areas get ""second wave"" I'm afraid. Millenials afford stocks much afford anything else. Stocks like real estate, barrier entry nil.

But can't. 69% Americans less $1000 savings. 45% money savings. know age breakdown is, going baby boomers savings large. ""It can't happen me, I'm worried."" 

""It happened me, careful."" Interesting article. say piece, suspect virus become contagious, also become less deadly, seeing many new ""cases,"" deaths continue steadily decline. 

## ABSTRACT

SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) isolates encoding D614G mutation viral spike (S) protein predominate time locales found, implying change enhances viral transmission. therefore compared functional properties proteins aspartic acid (SD614) glycine (SG614) residue 614. observed retroviruses pseudotyped SG614 infected ACE2-expressing cells markedly efficiently SD614. greater infectivity correlated less S1 shedding greater incorporation protein pseudovirion. Similar results obtained using virus-like particles produced SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, proteins. However, SG614 bind ACE2 efficiently SD614, pseudoviruses containing proteins neutralized comparable efficiencies convalescent plasma. results show SG614 stable SD614, consistent epidemiological data suggesting viruses SG614 transmit efficiently. Utilities follow tenant. Wear tear comes deposit damage deposit bill gets sent family. getting paid landlord understand argument. sounds like narrative against. get money want out, still get money, hey looks empty clean got way. 

All families go homeless something cannot control. Mass unemployment.

Once everyone job long enough applicants able pay either. seen end wont long time. Get ready sued I'm actually really curious flu season going go year. areas social distancing still effect (at least somewhat), impact spread? Actions take minimize Covid spread going least effective Flu, going see best flu season ever? fair, people decision needed protect themselves. matter government said something not, still follow guidelines. downvoted? people think everyone able set garden full subsistence crops available year round? Well, Expressen *really* good imo. Esp. stuff they've done re: HCWs pandemic, investigative journalism generally. TBH looks like could come NY Times it. quite impressive. yeah lot trash. Like tabloids. 

This might make smile: actually think, joke, Swedish tabloids better Danish tabloids whole. tend *often* put serious journalism makes sense. even read Danish ones usually, check Swedish ones daily now. Drove LA Fitness parking lot packed cars. fucked. work PM later sent them! cases anything post includes chart shows cases risen 1k per day well 5k per day deaths remained relatively constant (actually downward trend)

Maybe there‚Äôs consider # cases. I'll never lumber like again. bought fence boards early last year. split boards, knocked knots boards looked like snakes stack. bought 200 boards brought back 30-40. hassle exchanging least all, time lost returning boards equal saved letting pick boards. Wake Millennials Gen X

We 75 year old Boomer Biden (he actually pre Boomer!) beat 70 year old 60s leftist Bernie 

What happened us?  leaders ideas? Maine's 2nd congressional district half-convinced COVID democratic hoax.

That said: state bitches entitled tourists much do, treat see someone act like fucking hypocrite. We're well corona thank you? Key difference here: universal.

Being part society means taking care everyone, society shouldn‚Äôt like bunch crabs bucket. You‚Äôre thread talking fantastic health insurance that‚Äôs good you, fellow countrymen can‚Äôt afford healthcare skip doctor visits? go bankrupt? matter you? dislike stereotype Americans idiots.

A massive amount US voted tv personality become leader. thing think single wanting meet someone sex thing life months now. even then, hell would *that* good idea? Or, people really boring nothing else life get fucked local bar familiar faces run high school. Start fining people it. People fined speeding, littering, wearing seat belt, etc. There's reason someone can't fined ignoring requirements prevent spread deadly virus. UK. stay least metre apart, groups 6; unless heatwave throng thousands beach, BBQs parks, raves. Apart events, oh, outside pubs, remain lockdown. Agree Sweden friendly post tenyears ever. 

He completely twisted facts suit agenda. Even statement "" EU countries returning business usual"" total bullshit - yes, many restrictions eased, call ""business usual"" rubbish. Sweden's numbers looks rather similar worst hit countries hard say Sweden's number would looked much different lockdown not. spread widespread compared neighbors? 

I agree - difficult make call minute. said poster call Sweden's strategy failure juncture ridiculous. ignoring factors bigger picture basically become equivalent climate change denialist. lacking testing evaluate effect strategy. testing increased course number infected people increasing would nice compare... 

A lot emphasis put testing, wrote COVID-19 PCR Tests Scientifically Meaningless. RT-PCR used ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù Sars-Cov-2 fit purpose. tin-foil hat theory - even FDA CDC admitted much. complete waste time. True that. hold transcripts due delinquency though. excellent points. general, things nightmarish looked Wuhan January February. absolutely terrible outbreaks NYC, Northern Italy, Madrid, nothing quite like Wuhan. let spread several weeks imposed social distance masks, maybe reason. weather anything it, then... know fuck happens, would horrible.  mean don‚Äôt believe country billion doesn‚Äôt cases day? way! yeah CDC guidelines really dangerous. feel like point Trump got GOP nomination, Pence asked runningmate basicaly said ""What could possibly go wrong? likely win improve platform, even does, much could actually eff own""?

And rest history. woodworker horrendous allergies means great lung protection. difference Walmart departments connected. can't employees electronics section.

At HD Lowe's gardening section essentially separate outdoor store. even cash registers baggers everything. gardening center open requires employees opening another area store. block off/lock doors less employees exposed way people walk steal things.

Also idk picked talking full lockdown essential businesses open. easy search find examples seen zero comprehensive studies frequent outcomes many long lasting. ok worried outcomes, course worrisome, spreading everyone recovers going messed life supported data right butt worlds jokes since elected Trump.

Since Bush Jr, Obama got hope back Trump elected. friend works county test center, takes 5-7 days tests come back. 30.00 schmeckles is:

No. logical invent lot methods, mentioned anywhere. course, also worth mentioning entire argument builds unsubstantiated statements like 

Wrong buddy. Mathematical departments hire mathematicians, contract tracing teams.

Epidemological departments contract tracing team. it‚Äôs turn again.

See here‚Äôs thing lockdowns, fail address issue reopen, people lock again. people need go ICU can't get proper treatment they're busy treating fucks missed. Dearly. Texas' problems nothing weather AC. Greg Abbott's incompetence. Thank you! That's I've posting. nothing magical ""summer"" makes viruses disappear. outside summer makes difficult spread, air moving, UV sun helps deactivate viruses. course comes assumption that... outside. So, may helpful think ""being outside good, inside bad"", rather ""heat somehow kills virus hanging AC!"". 

In northeast, summers BBQs friends family backyards. go restaurants eat patio. go zoo, beach, hike woods. things low risk spreading disease outside, sun wind distance friend.

In winter family big dinners inside. eat inside restaurants, go science center, bowling, movies. inside, high risk transmission.

So ""disease disappears summer"" makes sense talking somewhere northern, summers time outside winters time huddle together warmth indoors. south, opposite. Summers times hang outside time, hot. So, higher transmission summers (which we're seeing right now).  We'll nuke 'em like World War 2. states built-in social distancing still can't get infection spread down. takes amazing level stupidity part governors. Charleston, SC resident really hope follow suit July 4th beach shutdown. fear though, despite reaching new peak number cases nearly every day county/statewide.  Often agricultural infrastructure responsible declines soil quality. Protesters wore masks. Trump rallies Trump turned masks political symbol enemies. know, right?!? stupid oldies going living along time, shame. buying closing costs $30k? Mine &lt;10k times bought house.  Yes , essentially North Carolina governor told RNC would follow CDC guidelines social distancing Trump threw tantrum Mayor Jacksonville reached out. NPR day talking great would Jax go plane right would wear half mask P100 respirator Source? Masks Houston unlike 10 days ago hospitalization explainer logged attacking using minimum source? prove anything cited source.  wish would least sell filmed version/streaming rights these. could potentially help productions least little bit. family enjoyed streaming Cats, Shrek Joseph Technicolor Dreamcoat, etc. Wish available. course good person. We'll see gets homeless move are, ""canaries coal mine"" small army hopeless Americans ""on street."" pocket cost? Texan here: please don‚Äôt disappointed us! Large number us indeed taking seriously promise! Plus produce went really badly downhill even I've gone store, crappy place like Walmart even better produce now.

Even raw number deaths seems lower right now.

On national level, started getting close 30,000 new coronavirus cases per day beginning April. also started 1,000 deaths per day time, jump 2,000 per day end April.

We stayed around 25,000-30,000 cases per late May, started trending 20,000 end May/beginning June. 

But deaths still trending downward. June averaging little 1,000 deaths per day, days well that. (And New Jersey adjustment added 1,800 deaths last week.)

Something clearly changed deadliness virus and/or ability treat it. Thanks!

Yes, wonder makes sense withdraw everything 401k's now, effect. huge factor actually, infection rate risk, instilled greater population ""if they're allowed congregate huge groups, going trouble socially distance."" mindset, unfairness seeing thousands protestors get pass, stuck home, wanted, meant stopped vigilent.

Its sad case punishing people right thing, punishing (ie. protesters). Regardless views happenings America, protests never permitted happen (all state governments showed incredibly insulting double standard, doubt pissed LOT people staying home), thumbed nose people trying everything right slow infection. Weird, go little island town hospital right get tested free drive-thru testing site. 

Oh, I‚Äôm oppressed universal healthcare! freedoms, they? graduate medical school? making ""doctor money"" yet? could seen coming? meant ""marginally"" economics sense, order magnitude. US also ""flatter"" setting new records daily cases.

The US setting new records *cases detected.* Ntionwide, infections March they're now. Although places rising, never really ""first wave"" now. I've got theory heat related. virus still transmit heat, individuals wont get high viral dose. Dunno. I'm preparing total shitshow Fall. Holy crap! idea! 

I went ER last year head scan. discharged medical facility claimed sent invoice. However found sent address lived 10 years! 

Fast forward finally sent itemized list speak manager. real kicker sent itemized list sending collections. top list sent even services listed. another pending collections notice. 

They really screwed me. credit shot I'm making payments $2000 know of. Meanwhile there's another bills know there. I'm wondering what's point. probably know u/TenYearsTenDays days ago lauding Norway trying stop S√°mi going Cringe link pretty much proves point...the flu shot prevent millions hospitalizations year.

There's also mention take flu shot every year either, guess would harder study. sounds realistic. I‚Äôm banking anywhere September-November. It‚Äôs pretty believable take account covid infections mild asymptomatic. needed sizeable portion city infected end high death tolls. Would agree fake news weaponized tactic? first generations exposed instant media, millions sources push agenda. always believed freedom press means liberty censored, however blatant publication false information used influence people certain way shouldn‚Äôt legal. 

But separate fake news? seems though every day new troll evil internet entity born, it‚Äôs safe say fake news overpowers stronger impact cold hard facts. fighting losing battle? even worth fighting ignorance misinformation? makes sad person's comment many upvotes, presumably people find relatable agree (would get vaccine) - responses talking reasons 'fast tracked' equate unsafe vaccine kind there. 

I guess never mind already rolling phase 3 testing Brazil one candidates. Maybe they're different /s That's one voice amongst many, though, including article. experts divided, every day get 'masks work' paper frontpage, hand hear statements like hers. We're (as UK) increasingly alone this, though - one countries left still majority wearing masks. I'd say that's normal. Sometimes get nosebleed scratching nose wrong way. nosebleed swab anything worry about. ""Hold butts..."" even remotely close over. Less 1 tenth 1 percent confirmed COVID. Let‚Äôs hope Pillboi Donkey Doug safe. know dope masks. I've wondering last days hearing opening plan schools fall: thoughts school fall?

I'm bit torn see real risk opening schools fall. Risk teachers, students' families, etc. 

At time, *lot* people cannot afford kids school. can't afford child care, job capable WFH, maybe household anything substance abuse domestic abuse, even rely schools provide meals. families also tend among risk virus too.

Locally plan to:

* Make kids wear masks (good luck younger kids)
* Make kids stay 6ft apart lunch facing (again, good luck)
* Tell kids play non-contact recess (Do even need say it?)
* 2 days on/2 days alternating Wednesdays (What single-parent low-income families?)
  * Also, parents well equipped basically become child's teacher 2-3 days week. There's reason parents homeschool even wanted to.

I personally think shitshow, that's me.

This came due local plan shared following video MD Zubin Damania:  


The TL;DR is:

* Open Schools
* Ramp production surgical masks public
* Suck wear mask, even cloth one. good protect others yourself. gosh, government would take seriously..well, gonna do, like easy put mask try caring others..so tough Living poverty doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre young. associate age groups people. educated financial investments privilege lot people simply America. poor extra money often spend money entertainment. Like tax season rolls around children get expensive new shoes. many respects people poverty view objects status instead good money management. One large issue idolizing celebrities much. Controlvirus TBF far ""others plane"" concerned guilty thing?

I've mad parents flying FL twice past month see dying grandparents, saw someone tell similar story downvote lol would empathize someone put gun head take debt attend expensive school?

It's kinda two-way street it? Calling slavery offensive. Probably short term, anything GER : Public transport shops. Also need wear restaurants seated. Also teachers wear masks time even mandatory students, find quite stupid. hospital patients, people visiting doctors employees doctor's offices. Well, fuck. hope. help leadership downplaying everything. Asymptomatic cases different strain. shows lethal strains covid-19 easily spread unlike flu. Ive heard opt pay cash pocket, cost goes way down. guess shows may true claim within 6ft someone punch them. Also sturdy mountain guardrails be, various decisions regarding road safety.

If life infinite value, wouldn‚Äôt able make reasonable trade offs building things.  get buried, MA, opening tons daycares across state. I‚Äôm preschool teacher I‚Äôm worried prolonged exposure children (who don‚Äôt understand social distancing keep masks on), despite safest practices put risk. I‚Äôm also worried daughter (2) carrier home school. state announced reviewing data, strong evidence suggest children carry much lower rate adults unlikely children pass adults. However, I‚Äôm still scared. hardly sleep. need work don‚Äôt qualify UI job offered work.

I addressed initial reply. ‚ÄúThe problem people think flu massive boogie monster pneumonia big deal hear Covid causes pneumonia, ‚ÄúEh biggie, least it‚Äôs everyone gets pneumonia gets flu pneumonia flu. pneumonia deaths higher influenza deaths.

That also addressed initial comment. ‚ÄúBut flu pneumonia bundled together? relationship strong unique warrant characterizing single cause death? David Rosenthal, director Harvard University Health Services, said, ""People necessarily die, per se, [flu] virus‚Äîthe viraemia. die secondary pneumonia. many pneumonias viral pneumonias secondary [pneumonias]."" Dr Rosenthal agreed flu/pneumonia relationship unique. instance, recent study (JAMA 2004;292: 1955-60[Abstract/Free Full Text]) found stomach acid suppressing drugs associated higher risk community acquired pneumonia, **but drugs pneumonia compiled single get flu weakens immune system get secondary infections die died flu. like saying someone got shot dies bleeding saying getting shot cause death.

No, like dying parachute failing gets reported automotive accident body stopped abruptly. 

From link

‚ÄúCDC's model calculated average annual 36,155 deaths influenza associated underlying respiratory circulatory causes (JAMA 2003;289: 179-86[Abstract/Free Full Text]). Less quarter (8097) described flu flu associated underlying pneumonia deaths.‚Äù

And another section:

‚ÄúMeanwhile, according CDC's National Center Health Statistics (NCHS), ""influenza pneumonia"" took 62,034 lives 2001‚Äî61,777 attributed pneumonia 257 flu, 18 cases flu virus positively identified.‚Äù

If look CDC leading causes death page even says **and** pneumonia: 55,672‚Äù admission get pneumonia without flu. takes us back original point. 

‚Äúnow people think flu massive boogie monster pneumonia big deal hear Covid causes pneumonia, ‚ÄúEh biggie, least it‚Äôs flu!‚Äù‚Äù Good luck side effects it.

Folks political orientation typically violent, uneducated, unintelligent. almost like caricature right.

Good luck, little man. Stay home. Stay safe primary problem actual effectiveness remdesivir remains question, devoting immense resources administering way could costly diverting scarce resources away less flashy measures might effective. contracts spring helping data collators pull together study data new drugs diseases, COVID-19 drugs naturally topping list. whilst gotten much press, review Gilead data New England Journal Medicine raised grave concerns much actually helps

 

The core issue something called ""outcome switching"" alleging NIAID study authors dishonest, rather looking dozens outcomes see remdesivir helped, found virtually nothing large majority, re-pivoted time spent hospital 10-day administration findings turned outcome anything potentially statistically significant. one scientific advisers team pointed out, comparatively weak sauce. say remdesivir ineffective, clearly something least fraction patients clearly dramatic effects, questionable devotion resources set mass infusion centres weak documented effects. inhaled version might help somewhat still best questionable effect size even IV form (which rapid high-dose administration) seems relatively little. trying overly negative one worst things done current context rush supposed panaceas simply pan out, wasting untold critical care resources process. Nothing it. wait nature work. Natural selection get them. US losing fight virus lunatic political play people's lives. don‚Äôt disagree. views community don‚Äôt align personal views many issues. thankful free accessible testing community, recognize country yet. 

I think situation communities really need look local regional data. testing accessible rates skyrocketing certain area, kids shouldn‚Äôt go back school person yet. testing easily cases stable (with low hospitalization rates) decreasing, schools probably reopen modifications precautions. month silly. article May 18th 'Texas cases surging!' think there'd kind death spike. nothing changed. virus still there. go back ""normal"" take long resume spreading +30 percent day day. ‚ÄúBut muh freedom‚Äù ""listen every doctor"" listen medical consensus. Ben Carson doctor too, mean he's bat shit insane. doctors logical smart people, ""most"" are. also grown exponentially time. far cases first 12 weeks. everywhere, probably compare next flu season covid period disaster movie actual disaster. case psychopaths enabling bullshit would actually end falling victim it, instead vulnerable people society.

My hot take Ron DeSantis thrown jail life cover-up he's lead. He's sacrificing many people state alter corporate power. natural deaths old age car accident. pandemic(the deadliest far), think people spanish flu brushed statistics? happens regional ICU full?   die. thats happens. respect. Almost studies put practice regarding students. schools let started get officially bad (at least US). ever study referring going put practice 2 months (or longer)on mass scale, either kids online school help much educationally, mentally, socially go school become factory germs ultimately take home present families guardians. Smaller kids affected much ways health worst part can't really consent like young adults have. Yeah, sounds great. Yeah, know. bottle lotion pocket reason. urgent care, wash hands way often inpatient setting since interact many patients. inpatient facilities get priority PPE supplies. many gloves constantly changing them. 


There's much control. wash hands, spread whatever what's everything everyone wash them. do, dry become prone bleeding. people walking clinic asking results even though explicitly told self-isolate receive call results. turns they're positive. 


The workers essential ones abused least influence policies affect most. Slaughter houses traditionally don‚Äôt wear ppe everyone close proximity everyone else well aware, never found sub particularly useful. wasnt doubting ur info.

I looking sources spread em around country lot ppl think schools open normally summer, consider bad idea. fuck you?

an adult capable mature much make work for?

now, six times made worked minimum wage fifteen years ago Citation needed live, Tennessee. Obviously lot rednecks  great news. problem like every place people try get back normal New York ripe second wave.

NYC going particularly tough time dependent upon crowded public transportation upon public schools watch children parents work. high temperatures, brain basically melting. Lastly, taxpayers town? paying property taxes children school five days per week. two three. paying less property taxes then?

I whichever country in, case here. Plus, everyone afford high price daycare young children.

Daycare heavily subsidised even free here, again, different country. days students school? care them?

This would work every culture primary schools, secondary schools, staying home alone school parents work generally accepted. couple times teachers sick. even work, never tried past?

Because never least double amount classes moment's notice? 

As said, suggestions, heard media clear happen. Also, heard Germany, culture, tax law, etc us different. SLAMS American, basically gist it. sunlight ( UV rays) sun directly overhead summer kill indoor places receiving direct probably surviving long surfaces exposed outdoors...but people spend lot time indoors.

I‚Äôm really sure point you‚Äôre trying make. Americans sick hard-on war, eg George Carlin. language Based many asked? don‚Äôt recall telling anyone anything, lol. someone covid months ago recovered come contact after, still get it? kind like extremely likely terms service nobody else reads? can't put absolutely ridiculous things get anything. hold court. can't put terms service using service come house, kill you, multilate corpse livestream it, likewise Fox able say technically news source small print site, news title every single part programming appearing legitimate news. seems highly likely. important know that. Trying guilt 1% whole thing pointless even main source resistance. Remember Italy - case growth kept accelerating WEEKS lockdown, curve ton steeper tail down. 

This let get bad - KEEPS getting bad long see turnaround, slow case growth slowing ends being. remember household one person catches likely pass around - even shutdown stop that. manage polling location precinct always votes Democratic. driving home night sudden horrible sick feeling knew trump won. expected everything shitty he‚Äôs done (although hasn‚Äôt started full scale war yet) fully expect rig steal election. Yep left acknowledge this. get wrong, Fox News terrible rest mainstream ""news"". Corn huskers lotion also really great. think this?

I get argument. think flu kills people objectively wrong. Yeah pneumonia scarry want easily get pneumonia flu. part understand? died flu even though pneumonia killed got pneumonia flu.... Sigh... Who? Two grades went back school 3 weeks ago first week half 2000 kids tested covid schools 200 schools closed covid incidents. clearly saw I'm talking South Africa right?

Despite emphasizing ventilators, Cuomo de Blasio administrations hospital leaders didn‚Äôt ensure supply quality equipment, health-care workers said. big surprise doctors nurses number shoddy ventilators, called LTVs, distributed state stockpile state city federal government‚Äôs reserve.

Several health-care workers, including Mr. Thadathil, Elmhurst respiratory therapist, Dr. Meyers, ER physician, said government ventilators old many patients worsened them, leading collapsed lungs complications. LTV alarms often rang, ‚Äúit‚Äôs impossible know one vents actually trying indicate something dangerous happening,‚Äù Dr. Meyers said.

The Health + Hospitals spokeswoman said many state ventilators ‚Äúwere ‚Äòready go‚Äô came.‚Äù said system additional maintenance could used patients.

Ms. Lever, governor‚Äôs spokeswoman, said state tested every ventilator sending hospitals received complaints faulty ventilators.

The government hospital action plans also failed procure enough equipment including IV pumps control medicine flow, dialysis machines‚Äîeven though, early March, evident Chinese data kidney failure main issue Covid-19 patients face.

At Health + Hospitals Lincoln‚Äôs ICU first two weeks April, Dr. Donya Bani Hani said saw Covid-19 patient die every day two complications dialysis might prevented though worsening might died anyway. Bellevue‚Äôs ICUs, least 10 patients died couldn‚Äôt get dialysis time, doctor said. Another physician there, Dr. Buziashvili, said saw patient aged 50s die waiting line machine. Still, said ‚ÄúBellevue well adapt restructure appropriately gained knowledge virus.‚Äù

The system‚Äôs spokeswoman said patient died due lack dialysis treatment.

The discord Cuomo de Blasio administrations, long history conflict, complicated patient transfers.

When New York City‚Äôs Office Emergency Management realized massive mobilization would needed coordinate transferring hundreds Covid-19 patients overwhelmed hospitals, mayor‚Äôs administration sought state‚Äôs help activate centralized evacuation hub previously used emergencies like superstorm Sandy, according city officials.

Twice, state‚Äôs department health denied request, officials said. state gave green light March 26, hub used transport patients Javits Center USNS Comfort Navy ship, officials said‚Äîfacilities set federal government ended disappointing hospital executives weren‚Äôt initially built critical care take Covid-19 patients eventually took mild moderately ill Covid patients.

Ms. Lever, spokeswoman governor, said throughout March, city publicly made clear preference handle patient transfers move patients all.

After state officials found hundreds open hospital beds going unnoticed hospitals overrun, Mr. Cuomo announced state-run program March 30 coordinate beds, equipment staff. ad hoc team agency officials top aides Mr. Cuomo put together mapping tool began calling facilities close capacity helping coordinate transfers, said Jim Malatras, president SUNY Empire State College advising Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs pandemic response.

But system didn‚Äôt supervise transfer medical records patients follow conditions moved, said. ‚ÄúYou trying manage volume,‚Äù Mr. Malatras said, ‚Äúnot necessarily individual patient need.‚Äù

State officials said transfer system ultimately helped save lives, oxygen-tank lines began freeze overloaded ventilators Flushing Hospital Medical Center Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. state able coordinate 26 transfers within hour hospitals city upstate. spokesman hospitals confirmed episode declined comment further.

The state didn‚Äôt coordinate transfers inside hospital systems, inadequate coordination made matters worse Covid-19 patients. Health + Hospitals Bellevue‚Äôs emergency room, ambulances hauled 30 transfers nearly every day weeks surge hospitals like system‚Äôs Elmhurst, Lincoln Woodhull. Often, patients arrived critical condition‚Äîsomething unusual normal times‚Äîseveral nurses doctors Bellevue said. died soon arriving.

One April evening, ER nurse George Good toe-tagged corpse saw newly transferred man mid-60s roll breathing tube. ‚Äúhanging onto life thread,‚Äù Mr. Good said, heart rate started plummet: 63, 43, 32, nothing. Mr. Good said saw transfers die soon arriving ER. ‚ÄúIt something kind deal with.‚Äù

Three transfers Health + Hospitals' Woodhull Brooklyn came one night ‚Äúcoding‚Äù need resuscitation within 30 minutes getting there, another Bellevue doctor said. three died. normal protocol, patients verge death rarely transferred.

Dr. Buziashvili Bellevue disturbed times transfers lacked records prior treatment‚Äîrecords normally standard part patient transfer. three four ‚Äúpatient unknowns,‚Äù arriving name. one case, family member came identify patient.

Health + Hospitals said transferred 850 patients crisis declined disclose many transfers survived. ‚ÄúCovid patients generally unstable, conditions changed rapidly regardless area care transport,‚Äù system‚Äôs spokeswoman said.

As New York lurched action mid-March, shifting state, city hospital policies sometimes put patients medical staff risk. Early on, hospitals told staff isolate suspected Covid-19 patients rooms negative air pressure limit spread.

But patients flooded in, hospitals including Maimonides Medical Center, Health + Hospitals' Bellevue Harlem, Northwell‚Äôs Staten Island University Hospital housed suspected Covid-19 patients together, sometimes side-by-side vicinity confirmed Covid-19 patients, health-care workers said. Sick patients likely infected neighbors days sometimes took get test results, said. passed police call untouched.

The staffing shortages led hospitals losing track times admitted patients. Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center Brooklyn, family member called ER inquire mother 80s. ER doctor said looked patient up, realized died two days prior. ‚ÄúThis happening daily,‚Äù doctor said peak.

Brookdale spokesman Khari Edwards said hospital‚Äôs staff ‚Äúdid absolute best provide care need pandemic.‚Äù

During surge‚Äôs early days, Mr. Cuomo, Mr. de Blasio hospital officials often talked publicly urgent need ventilators. procurement emphasis, medical workers said, overshadowed staffing vital needs like oxygen oxygen monitors.

Supplemental oxygen became especially important keep Covid-19 patients breathing dwindling supply ventilators, especially became clear patients ventilators dying. least eight New York City hospitals experienced problems oxygen supplies, said health-care workers state officials.

It wasn‚Äôt oxygen wasn‚Äôt available market, said gas experts. Kimberly Menard, spokeswoman Pennsylvania-based Airgas, unit France‚Äôs Air Liquide SA, said company saw increased demand hospitals, ‚Äúhas experienced inability supply requested medical oxygen anywhere U.S.‚Äù

The problem state, city hospitals‚Äô action plans didn‚Äôt quickly step ability procure dole enough oxygen related supplies, including vital-signs monitors keep track patients. Health + Hospitals' Lincoln Bronx, severe oxygen shortage hit mid-surge, said doctors including Dr. Dasol Kang. said Covid-19 patients, including woman 50s man late 40s, languished without portable oxygen tanks, worsening much needed intubation later died.

The Health + Hospitals spokeswoman said hospital didn‚Äôt experience shortage never rationed oxygen. facility nearly doubled daily oxygen supply response surge, said.

Mr. Dowling, Northwell‚Äôs CEO, said hospital system using 50 times oxygen ever ran pressure points. ‚ÄúDid locations address oxygen issue? Yes. run oxygen? No.‚Äù

With scores patients needing ICU-level care, hospitals ran short vital-signs machines needed effectively monitor patients staff needed keep track them. Covid-19 patients gasping breath sometimes weren‚Äôt properly monitored lay hooked oxygen, sometimes died without anyone‚Äôs knowing, said doctors nurses least eight New York City hospitals.

That true case. ‚ÄúIt hit like truck,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúEven young risk, it‚Äôs pretty scary.‚Äù

At Methodist, majority coronavirus patients designated medical wards, I.C.U.s.

That might increasing proportion younger, healthier patients. Hospital leaders say also getting better treating patients, avoiding need transfer I.C.U.s. length hospital stays virus patients Methodist day half shorter month April May.

It remains possible proportion patients I.C.U.s could rise, time lag patient first gets sick develops critical illness.

On Saturday evening, making rounds, Dr. Faisal Masud, medical director critical care across Houston Methodist‚Äôs hospitals, described younger virus patients I.C.U.s. ‚ÄúTypically definitely 30-year olds, 35-year olds,‚Äù said, adding severely ill young people often obese medical problems diabetes, kidney disease high blood pressure.

That said, think EU surpassed US long time now. developed far better system co-exist eachother. current climate US one examples. lot systems place EU combat in-equality, promote decency fight global corporations. notion 'freedom' 'freedom market' along lines 'freedom citizens'. course Dutch, European i'm biased grateful born EU US.

Trump supporting Karens willfully going maskless public places expected wearing mask, throw temper tantrum like toddler screaming ‚Äúmuh rights!‚Äù  Lock up, let talk let rest us finally live jump conclusion yet, hospital best mortality rates city still lost 40% ICU patients. absolute deciding factor access ventilators, bipaps hiflow get patient far. think 2 factors come play next surge spots, ventilators staff. NYC area fortunate hit first, incredible amount patients, influx travel workers come alleviate work load. Base staff get sick need replaced. think different surging states access travelers right now, multiple states surging, wont enough emergency staff go around. 66% better 65% can't compare towards diseases. percentage required depends base reproduction rate infection, that's different species species, strain strain, even country country (and sometimes even lower, local level ) extremely confused I'm sure untangle level confusion.

The takeaway bottom line virus set chain reaction maladies even asymptomatic cases thoroughly studied means yet know frequent asymptomatic cases see sort chain reactions they, themselves, often asymptomatic disease progresses something detectable.

We capabilities know genes encode less lethal, lethal. Although that's I'm referring to. know strains disproportionately associated different symptoms. example - diarrhea likely found COVID-19 cases West Virginia Georgia.

It's true say damage done patient infected simply studied thoroughly yet.

Further, clear many infections hide body. We've seen multiple instances recovered case falling ill again. We've seen studies show recovered cases consecutive negative results symptoms, labs still show active infection body.

We understand often asymptomatic cases associated serious disease caused COVID-19. know infections long active even symptoms disappear tests negative. developed asthma viral infection pneumonia couple years ago. never caused pain. I‚Äôd definitely get second opinion. miss zero? 15k euro seems like small amount money live pretty good life style. Ya, seems something this. even chatter crazy news network it. First ""it'll gone Easter"" ""it'll gone July"" ""it'll gone November"" know he's getting info, virus gone November. hopefully Damn straight

I feel like I‚Äôm lucky live state work everyone wears masks every store I‚Äôve requires well. Lives Matter. Case point: coronavirus. can't breathe. tourist season over, they'll lock everything back down. 

Gotta make money fuck schools. point I'd prefer coin flip everyone. It'd actually favor considering steadfastness governors local law enforcement ensuring die. weeks dying home. Long video Zero explanation it‚Äôs fantasy. Agreed. rhetoric also extremely annoying. No... say, yes try conversation them... Lol, may may be. However, keeping money savings account losing proposition. Inflation goes faster interest accrued. Scientists journalists really focus efforts preventing current spread making sort political game. doesn‚Äôt matter came anymore. get information? Here's Johns Hopkins information mortality. Exactly. That‚Äôs nurses wear face shields + masks. handling coronavirus badly handled anyone read Ken Folletts ""Pillars Earth"" would done better job. 

Isolate early, wear masks stay clean. exceptions, even priests authority figures think know better.

Not difficult, pretty sad fictional character 30 year old novel better best minds today! know anecdote too, don‚Äôt know verifiable facts I‚Äôll join stupid cult. cunt. Europe cries small GDP vaccines first invented dead viruses. probably thinking that. important realise talking about. small possibility something might wrong vaccine, even smaller possibility thing that's wrong actual serious side effect. side look around - hundreds people dying every day, thousands seriously ill that's massive restrictions businesses people's lives try mitigate damage virus doing. 

You need slight suspicion maybe vaccine rushed order choose take it, need evidence something anywhere near bad current state vaccine. think changes becos administration. overall system. they‚Äôre gonna end extra $600 week end July. That‚Äôs things could really get bad, people don‚Äôt money coming jobs hiring. What‚Äôs gonna happen then? disproven time time again. Almost every hit area right middle summer hot regions. Everyone hoped summer heat would kill off. It‚Äôs not.  realize thousand dollars saved makes huge difference emotional well being. started saving made 30k year. hundred bucks month adds up. Okay, asked? Seriously, posted giant war comment section. spelled Wookiee.

At least use proper spelling grammar bot making lick sense, Tr*mper. ok wumao Lack excessive freedom China concentration camps. least people get wiped naturally occurring virus government sworn protect them. Wondering thing. idea still world leader. aware someone means say ""free healthcare"". way pedantic dweebs talk global warming instead referring directly anthropogenic climate change. sure would trust filtration particles. go well Diesels. time becomes available you, hundreds thousands already it. Frontline health care workers, police, fire etc get first. market months already time supply trickles you. understand concern, get wish sense. suspect virus back detected novel coronavirus human-to-human transmissible, else number cases Spain would exploded year ago, especially suspicious following summer.

* Updating ...* RemindMe! 16 years got flu shot though. flu shot literally guess flu might mutate comes back around globe seasonally. 

I'm sceptical first release vaccine I'm sure understand works completely. USA routinely goes war manufactured evidence, prioritises corporations people, routinely denies established science, rarely ever keep agreements.

Those characteristics global leader, predate Trump many years. want ignorant. also thought really medical condition really cannot wear mask. mean masks make super easy breath big surface air pass through.

And yes, face shield another option. thinking like one little ‚Äúlessons‚Äù said Stan, end Southpark episode. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è said comb desert, we're combing desert! defies belief.

Yup, tragically stupid country 100 million citizens untethered reality. We're deep shit.

Reason #98 I'm moving another country over. US finished. It‚Äôs literally whole reason got people care EU. saw triage Italy thought holy shit don‚Äôt want that. Europeans never saw US world leader.Only Americans see US world leader. Wait China starts using lockdowns whenever want people stay inside suppress rioting human rights.

They've spending last three months lockdown huffing noxious Q propaganda online that's telling anyone going part global chi-mo/bloodsucking conspiracy he's secretly fighting US armed forces. recently saw video Florida woman shouting passionately wagging finger stood podium city council meeting, citizens invited share opinions whether masks mandatory public spaces.

She yelled, ‚ÄúAnd YOU, DOCTOR! going JAIL CRIMES HUMANITY!‚Äù

She talking doctor supporting mask wearing.

I lost lot hope moment. 1, 2 , 3, fight! Yeah, real Handmaid's Tale bullshit warming up. Shutting barn door horse bolted.

VOTE people going live long enough enjoy policies. I'm 96 honestly feel generationally homeless. Whenever there's one memes things different generations remember/experienced, I'm always half half two. fact already getting food plants tells happen anytime recently, means kind irrelevant.

My point telling story supposed happened quite recently. experiencing massive resurgence cases ""gardening stores"" list essential businesses states. However, hardware stores are, good reason.

They complaining wait line things given gardening section.

**(oh let's ignore fact order seeds online without going store)**

I pointing right now, midsummer, given current situation virus, gardening section hardware store operating, store allowed open first place sell ACTUALLY essential things. Like AC units, lightbulbs, plumbing stuff. seeds take months grow. meantime grow still needing go grocery store producing essentially exposed people nothing. get five months? Won‚Äôt available early next year they‚Äôve working since feb/March. I'm little loop(serious question troll). keep seeing tiny ifr numbers. look death/case numbers posted.

Italy 188,891 vs 34,738 (16%)
Iran 186,180 vs 10,670 (5%)

etc etc. I'm sure fr lower reported...but testing gone death rate really fallen all. instance tons testing ny, yet still seeing high death rate. people getting super low case fatality ratio often quoted? 95% wearing near FL. TL;DR: Sweden restrictions many countries originally stricter measures. seems strategy trade short term pain via temporary lockdowns Test, Trace, Isolate infrastructure put place paid dividends increased freedom movement assembly compared Sweden. Sweden's herd immunity policy may temporarily granted freedom, appears opposite: NPIs maintained unknown period whereas EU countries returning business usual. government take next bailout failure. like you.

So study, then? claiming scientists stop recording data, suddenly disappear, way course antibiotics would flush body stopped midway? 

Or desperately grasping bad analogy proven wrong can't confront it? please point wrong. asked source, gave source said exactly claimed.

Problem is, theres armed group privatized terrorists tanks guns called cops weve seen..even peaceful LEGAL protests gets violent cops camt control themselves. thing left grab arms take force. Unfortunately government sheeple afraid stand them. Failed state somewhat specific term essentially means government little power. US messed political establishment definitely lost sea, federal gov still shitload power legitimacy therefore failed state. even close. failed 10 years ago, gone almost 4 years havent looked back.

A complete failure education protect young. wrong. 

The articles explain method is. cannot get says that.

My guess either newspaper misquoted him, things article describe. Places act craziest ones desperate. tells airlines facing bankruptcy even flying half-full planes.

It's like people baffled Florida acting recklessly. course - entire economy based travel. Unemployment topped 40% there. things change soon, they'll need cut state-wide budget half next year, they're rolling dice praying. 

Same story - airlines acting crazy they'll go business sure act sane. I'm hoping mandate insurers cover cost. Lol thats kinda weird question. Cambodia example? Full tourists, yet arguable one biggest shitholes there. One literally nothing other. 

Btw look official statistics even tourism U.S. growing still far growing rates actual tourist hotspots do. tourism industry growing whole. lose educated audience compare COVID HIV.

no Miami Gardens Cop Arrested Charge Battery Pregnant Black Woman

üì∑[Nicholas news reporter Forbes, primarily covering U.S. South.Updated Jun 26, 2020, 10:27am EDT

TOPLINE

A recently fired Miami Gardens police officer shown graphic video January holding knee pregnant Black woman‚Äôs neck tasing multiple times stomach arrested  charged battery official misconduct, Miami-Dade State  Attorney announced Thursday.

The officer, Jordy Yanes Martel, seen video dragging  33-year-old Safiya Satchell vehicle putting knee  neck stunning twice Taser, Satchell  screams. Na im Canadian, get tested, get treatment govt actually provided funding people lost employment. FREE! ü•àüåä  way could see would discovered virus mutated far less deadly got outbreak 100% control pressing need went away therefore funding. Since neither seems likely we'll keep pouring money research eventually one work. 13% Nope, [Mass shootings continued steady pace increased May ~30 50 pace close 100 June. possible fight Covid effectively without well, look Denmark. Plus half physical distance advised US does, 1 meter instead 6 feet. isn‚Äôt late copy them. started lot cases. longest time cases per capita Florida criticizing Florida fucking spring break gasp, open beaches. Meanwhile lauding Denmark model response.

Now move season spend time outdoors Florida hits season spend time indoors, tables turned. escape blame people go grocery stores breathe back neck designated spot stand 6 feet behind me. Grocery stores crowded daily basis dude people work receiving free money. allowed throw protest equation? Majority people downtown protest unmasked well. many different things go equation yet we‚Äôre blaiming Florida beaches like don‚Äôt overcrowded full people without mask. Ah missed article‚Äîgood point. would love right friend. Hopefully we'll get constitution worth toilet paper written on, especially country japanese americans ""lockdown"" many things. Different kinds social distancing slow virus different ways.

In particular, avoiding church services highly effective, impact economy. reason, that's one thing cannot even *suggested* American leadership. Funny thing facts, they‚Äôre true whether believe not. Somewhere 12,000 ball park. Florida‚Äôs highest 10,000 Friday. We‚Äôve already likely passed New York‚Äôs highest record day won‚Äôt officially confirmed till Tuesday Wednesday. Isn‚Äôt CJD infections tainted meat 80s? Trump promised us wall got one, problem China still better wall. ask 7-8 days deaths start catching cases. Oh no, can't never going do. lol don‚Äôt *exclude* kind thinking (since ‚Äòdisregard‚Äô makes sense context). However, making general statement made single reference article. Thanks. overlaps sure, think enough massaging made believe wearing masks en masse good idea. often forget add /s - think break space-time continuum. try remember everyone‚Äôs safety. Right. term 'left dead' makes envision upside truck bleeding screaming man EMT saying naw heard hospitals full covid patients. Let's leave head home. articles this? God hope catches it, would quite fitting. Honestly coronavirus took Pence Trump commission weeks/months/forever, US would much better shot actually dealing shit. started counting. current pace impossible kill inordinate number people back Good answer one. Well played. Insult ppl backed corner. Take care fuming stomping served you.  Says guy wear mask look people eyes speaking lolololol Thank goodness. Cause official til says /s..... Meh, wants go USA anyway? lot universities severely limiting person class size encouraging classes shift online. Mine rule something along lines class 25% normal classrom capacity. agree gonna likely get shut soon semester even get chance open first place. lines can't crossed. look people getting sick grocery stores. gets worse staff run store. üèÖ people get really bad cold sores take low dose valtrex daily prevent it. talk doctor see okay given health history medications take. taking medication daily doctor send regular blood tests see liver kidneys even taking vyvanse. would recommend getting blood test starting long-term drug treatment. compare results thing comes later. example started non stimulant ADHD called intuniv rarely prescribed doctors know much even specialist. really helps lets take low dose biphentin everyday instead large dose plus booster. read could cause heart problems (turned true) asked EKG. EKG showed bradycardia. Psychiatrist wanted reduce dose since symptoms EKG started treatment showed heart rate normally borderline bradycardia medication. 

I would say weary online cures might find /r/nootropic parts internet. find single study, usually preliminary study good enough rely use proof effective. companies sell hype cure all's motivation, depression, fatigue, pain coincidentally also happen symptoms affected placebo effect course find lots forum post saying help lot. pretty dangerous health, addictive ( case also likely ones might actually help) ones addictive potentially way make chemicals legal sell. safe effective cases would prescription medication least counter. need proof listen people internet, field (engineering) well know measurement tool accurate 10 times displays. scale measures 1 mg trusted 10mg. see someone tell take 25mg better 18mg whatever unless 0.0001g scale costs hundreds dollars know exactly dose is. know dose take $20 0.001g scale same. That's part it. Another part small percentage New Yorkers anti-science. People (in NYC) like, ""oh, staying home wearing mask public recommendations science health community? Sounds good."" Thank god Step 1: surround really smart, hard working people. (This really easy. president United States)

Step 2: Listen really smart, hard working people say.

Step 3: Use information make informed decisions Oh definitely. live colorado everyone wearing mask. Even walking around outside. Except surgeon general lied everyone masks stuck! He‚Äôs doctor. So, symptomatic get tested three days symptom onset. asymptomatic, get tested 8 days exposure?  ""magically better"" lmao. handled better magic via strict lockdown world. course worked - akin throwing nuke army batallion. That's insane. trivial number cases per day, dropping. plans school completely flexible. know teachers students stay virtual vaccine found, know classes quarantined time time, know specials teachers can't go class class spreading infection. Pretty much every class zoomed kids another classroom (because half kids school spread out), kids home, kids teacher there. half school campus given time (whether alternate days half days varies). barely cases real prospect surge everyone masks socially distances. Great job, NY! Keep up! said another way, voted politicians listen doctors scientists wouldnt mess virus right now. dense fuck much you‚Äôll news fired named lawsuit don‚Äôt say exactly right thing ""We've tried nothing we're ideas!"" annoying part first four steps make life dangerous us comply safety guidelines.

The last one? vaccine works me, care plague rats anymore. realize there's perfect protection even vaccines, I'll *probably* okay, bad people refusing masks threatening spread plague directly. Oh, fans bite matter what. That's he's 40% approval rating. think he'll lose lot independent voters voted like Hillary. focus every country worldwide media conspiracy theory oust Trump? 'stop electing politicians can't even trust dispense obvious widely-known truth'? Plenty politicians understand respect science, ones seem bunch one party, makes even easier avoid supporting them.  Boston: need start quarantine area NY, CT NJ stop border crossing. 

Hopefully force Maine, NH, VT RI behave well pretty solid block. Probably even Hawaii Alaska could let us fly there.

I think really needs happen. healthy areas country need start aggressively managing let in.

Economically could great would hopefully get exempted EU travel limitations restarting ton business. Yeah that's they'd do. like understand space means? need million people hospitals 'no space'. comment said left dead rubbed wrong way inaccurate. I've life flighted multiple times I've chest tube installed outside helicopter roof hospital cause crashing. ain't gonna leave dead side road man, works  fat huge health risk, imagine proposed ""social pressure movement"" ridicule fat people lmfao

You guys insane masks holy shit never really closed first place. Yea I'm calling BS. Pennsylvania right ONE wearing mask. problem state (Ohio) doctors dont power issued restrictions. People started hate doc. it? notice article not. praise Cuomo instead criticize many mistakes. governor, Trump. state federal government values citizens much case, it, it, simply value people money. rare. Everyone basically lower income lower middle class. majority wealth gap middle class upper middle class. Everyone‚Äôs playing field, opportunity. helps. Kinda small city stuck time almost. ""I literally job. even tried."" One person make happen. Americans general are/were selfish begin with. live culture instead like Mr Orange got elected. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs like well 20 years honestly.  Man would love deal complaining parents. agree hard well. big test entire country especially states handling right moment, feel like coming stats highly dependent people act 4th. Stay safe New Jersey, hoping best guys well everyone trying right thing crisis It‚Äôs sure thing all. Currently Biden ahead ‚Äúlarge margin‚Äù 10 points, polls Bernie Sanders near insurmountable lead primaries Biden Hillary Clinton landslide Trump 

Keep mind electoral college votes matter handful swing states voters white Christians I‚Äôm fairly liberal. started thought ‚Äúok, important anything else faced awhile. Trump manage keep shit US get contained somehow. would seriously probably vote him‚Äù

That‚Äôs bad situation is. We‚Äôve knocked pegs hierarchy needs could‚Äôve kept us virus free. Well least that‚Äôs worth something. 

But are. exact opposite. kind knew would. guess you‚Äôre shut country many people getting sick? Well, you‚Äôll take deal avoids guess. list 54 countries pretty strange. Turkmenistan officially denies coronavirus refuses publish stats let officials, yet allowed? I'm rural Arkansas majority people around wearing masks grocery store (with exception staff members). Maybe 20% customers wearing masks despite recent spike local cases.

That said, spike mask use even lower. Sad. time line people. time line discussing, earnest, Kim Kardashian would legit better job Commander Chief current one. Bask moment. People US straight tripping. drove get kids meds yesterday. Maybe 10 minute drive. Saw three parties. one wearing masks. Apparently got tired virus decided solution forget precautions take control spread. helps, previous antibody tests showed New York healthcare workers lower Covid prevalence rest city.

Ideally, get tested 3 days symptom onset, reliability peaks 80%. get tested point, higher risk false negatives, see graph research: [http://r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation\_in\_falsenegative\_rate\_of\_reverse/](http://r/COVID19/comments/gjgst2/variation_in_falsenegative_rate_of_reverse/)

For people means 8 days exposure (medium incubation period 5 days) incubation period vary, would reliable go date symptom onset. get tested symptom onset, negative, may want keep mind possibility false negative get tested symptoms develop.

""Over 4 days infection typical time symptom onset (day 5), probability false-negative result infected person decreases 100% (95% CI, 100% 100%) day 1 67% (CI, 27% 94%) day 4. day symptom onset, median false-negative rate 38% (CI, 18% 65%). decreased 20% (CI, 12% 30%) day 8 (3 days symptom onset) began increase again, 21% (CI, 13% 31%) day 9 66% (CI, 54% 77%) day 21."" Horrible idea. instead outdoors people indoors house parties. Yeah, well people brain know take part survey imported case, quarantine foreign travelers used short 14 days. 21 days. doctors scientists clueless politicians.

Everyone claim doctors everything figured end this, reality one knew effective method containing virus countries managed handle virus well ones imposed somewhat authoritarian control citizens. idk everyone wants businessman president. Businesses literally set like autocracies. Ah you‚Äôre finally ad hominems. way finally conceding you‚Äôre wrong wasting everyone‚Äôs time? Thanks downvote though way, really felt emotion come that. right! pressuring leaders work faster implement restrictions. agree. know lot people simply decided quarantine boringso they're done sure backs anything said. gay men still HIV other. 
This homophibic probleme. Understandably. Biden US presidential candidate misspoke recently said 120mil died instead 120thou think FOX bad... see Censorship finest. Don‚Äôt know country like right now....Texas new China.  thing I'm certain I'll see Fox website boobs. There's always story ""Some actress Flaunts Bikini Body!"" I've one whole life still like lot Travel equal vacation. Among things, people's visa's ending, meaning literally required law travel. Lol dude. Memory goldfish. Cuomo delayed implementing restrictions WEEK. put Covid19 patients NURSING HOMES absolutely need to. cognitive dissonance New Yorkers maddening. infuriated local leaders yet pretend fine job. Insane. I'm sure trust based language. qualified speak matter point character. reason anyone believe person can't keep composure, act Donald Trump does, screaming nothing, moping, hating. racer; man, lard laden man.  Officials finally realized episode ends virus runs people infect may well happen sooner rather later. (Of course, can't actually come 'say' that.) Maybe misinformed, impression Sweden overarching legal restrictions stay open for. Without significant change ""constitution"" allowed lock population anyway. 

So scientists represented best case approach see could social distancing only... wasnt enough hindsight shown us blame public?

The past three four months seems Bill Gates forefront go vaccine discussion production reason.

Now top discussion today ""ER doctor‚Äôs plea: ‚ÄòStop going politicians news science'""

Maybe Bill Gates, someone medical science field, getting much attention he's receiving. people think vaccine exists, fine dandy. people conflate flu common cold, think big deal. Yep. Saying word starts R ends epublican one starts ends emocrat gets post automod removed.

It's damned shame reality situation politics deeply involved virus response. People die told truth politics. ""official"" reddit sub COVID19 censor reality pretty f'd up. don‚Äôt work well. found go ventilator die later takes long recover virus (weeks) longer ventilator less likely come it. Successful ventilation would days, weeks. it‚Äôs best go possible. try things. know brand, definitely feel ""Hurley"" seeing mans budding breasts belly poking tee shirt. 

And dudes shirt ""Snowflakes (don't last?) long Texas""

More accurately: Tacos, queso, bbq ribs, anything laden high fructose corn syrup last long Texas, apparently. pity inconsiderate assholes like this. Statistically still kills seniors higher rate non seniors. younger people getting infected greater numbers though death rate lower engaging close person-to-person interactions business socializing large volume younger cases cause number severe cases climb accordingly sub-59yr old demographic. lead younger profile populating ICUs. Publix may require it, also turn away wearing mask. 2 weeks lol. According headlines month trouble keeping memes Mask cure. cure. wear mask remainder healthy life. Unfortunate. losers aiming POTUS status. realize done anything except lay blame things go poorly take credit things go well. He's basically idle president. old guy lady said day public forum, apparently combination violating American freedom constitutions, god's something 5G. imagine Fauci‚Äôs shenanigans sense despair misinformation keeping post. like can‚Äôt retire time. Cool. Again, person said. You‚Äôre making totally separate point. sure. still think outlook quite grim given people‚Äôs attitudes point die? situation, parents NC, I'm Alabama. think I'm going keep waiting, it'll get better eventually. People Massachusetts, least region, good it. sometimes see people outside without on, they're usually super spread out, often around necks case. Inside, people wearing time. lot places let in, serve without one.  think death upticks would slower round. know mortality rate largely function age people getting infected. virus infected people eighties, would kill 10% them. infected people forties, would kill 0.1% them. (I'm trying downplay seriousness, 0.1% still ten times bad traffic accident deaths.) heard major outbreaks nursing homes recently assume better protected now, nursing home deaths made 50%-80% deaths back spring, mortality rates current waves much lower March/April death rates keep up. current pool victims much younger, better testing (capturing milder cases went unreported before) less adherence control measures, current situation different Wuhan/Italy/Spain/NYC, clear yet deaths/hospitalization situation evolve here. Sounds like half people work with. far less risk. Thanks reply, glad gotten treatment. check doctor see may something look possible diagnosis. started Zoloft Wellbutrin circumvent cognitive deficiency it‚Äôs helped ton. it‚Äôs working, it‚Äôs amazing, studded nervous twitches go away, speak clearly without fumbling words. possible underplaying medical issue that‚Äôs actually persistent would worth checking myself. Possibly, thought one supposed *Brian‚Äôs* operation ! !remind 1 week course recognize that.

I want people armed numbers, world children children inherit depends it. 9 10, 99994 100000. could also try making ear saver, maybe headband kind. Why? makes look like bad job. good job? scared backlash would get Trump. anything contrary stance, throws bus, lose constituents, potentially re-election. that‚Äôs it‚Äôs election yr sides using crisis push agenda instead best USA.  mean come people Rona another version flu! reason death count high hospitals incentive attribute Covid deaths bill refer children teach ""disgusting?"" know people respect teachers. /s shouldnt revel peoples' deaths thanks denialism, I'll say ""see, told so"". People reap sow. know difficult people understand.  want know what's insane... Germany pool testing back March surveillance.

It takes pack numbskull dipshits coordinate stuff federal level us figure out.  *was* one cringy [Trump children ad. surprised he'd incompetent managing crisis? really. looked numbers massachusetts. 2.5% spread think low? 

The Oregonian said 8000 people ONE DAY protest. That's 200 people infected based 2.5%.

On last friday, 250 new covid cases ENTIRE oregon. kind growth leading uncontrollable spread.

You've proven point. hope actually listen numbers take things seriously inatead sticking guns finding excuse continue killing people. life death talking. Sounds less like contingency plan like inevitability.  cases day Australia since Pandemic started. Im wondering this? Online classes UNCC cost twice much. around $1500 campus, $3000 campus per course. Also, professors know bring lot grant money. effects salary teaching. teach one class take semester teaching. I‚Äôm surprised one paying attention masks people wear. people wear surgical cloth masks. I‚Äôm fairly certain N95 masks effective. Maybe it‚Äôs better nothing, ‚Äòmasks‚Äô effectiveness!? undo everything worked MONTHS for.

Months?

We ""shut down"" 1 month. one.  Haha. Going -4000, eh? Compared neighboring countries, great. still long term health problems infected. Yup. Glad backed ""experts"" say family picnic huge covid risk massive BLM protest not. Real sound science right bud. dont forget, science racist. Happy cake day! And...I mean, that's takes. I'd prefer competent teachers, enduring roads, efficient buildings. I'll take get.  I‚Äôve seen used argument reopen things even cases surging. Apologies misunderstood you.  scientists smart knew doing, wanted discredit HQC achieved it, sheeple starting suspect something don‚Äôt think someone posts openly social media considered authority anything. obvious link rates know it, regardless feel movement. I'm sorry saying anything else ignorant. wear masks even I'm friends middle field I'm anti Vax way I'm taking rushed vaccine nobody knows secondary long term effects could provoke Damn right. who? person could possibly know thread. fair question. Covid virus cannot infect mucus membrane, need specific receptor bind enter one cells. imagine cells lots tiny houses little doors locks them, Covid virus one key: protein spike unlock ACE2 receptor, none other. find ACE2 receptor, enter cell, hijack it, start multiplying, take body. ACE2 receptors located cells inside mouth, tongue, inside nose, airways, cornea eyes. touch mouth virus get in, stays oral chamber maybe bind one receptors (as matter fact, think pretty unlikely well, infections believed spread directly inhaling people's droplets, touching). eat food, chances pretty good food bolus would envelop virus particle never touch mucus membrane all, gets washed saliva, unlikely linger mouth long enough find ACE2 receptor bind to. Saliva produced chewing also contain anti-virals regular saliva, maybe provide additional protection. food zero risk, considered relatively safe.

 (And no, one confused this, copy paste twice week) I'd administrators actually lightened teachers' load all, don't. don‚Äôt know trust numbers. 

Meaning submerged cases? 
All regions share test data daily, affected (Lombardia) getting 2% positive cases daily. regions well 1%.

The way people spoken keep speaking us bloody annoying. Get reliable info shitting enormous personal financial effort whole country went sake collective health. Sentencing death? Get grip reality please. certain become infected, less 1% chance dying. Yes, serious. quite dramatic. **THEY TURN FREAKIN‚Äô FROGS GAY** Thx ur effort.
Stay safe! like HIV cold baby called Covid-19 There‚Äôs images hospital score cards floating around help decide get care doesn‚Äôt. sure they‚Äôre legit, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs plans place. Medical care resources stretched aren‚Äôt infinite. I'd vote you. Odds worse. brother intubating people covid. church member keeps insisting covid bad virus hoax implement chip vaccin check us 5G. suspect mental ilness. licensing costs we're seeing far pretty low. $2.75 dose. Could come down, unlikely go up. Serum Institute crank hundreds millions doses, example. going scarcity long run. Bigger concern logistics distribution. Thx ur effort.
Stay safe! goes theory heat killing covid19... /j  radical concept. Not!  Psh. Pocket change. buys attention half committee meeting.  way people believed ventilators. people believe anything fits narrative. ME, agree. Chinese studies looked contact tracing data claim vast majority infections contracted indoors. Outdoor cases quite rare. wearing masks. them, think long term exposure indoors aerosols biggest issue. Even here, keep distance, going without mask relatively safe. shouldn‚Äôt ask local mayor genital warts? Yeah corporations government are. stop... protests didn‚Äôt impact spikes entire concept social distancing completely useless. attended multiple protests Los Angeles entire basketball arena amount people standing shoulder shoulder blocks. live Kansas, near 80% wearing mask. Klinefelter‚Äôs Syndrome. physical frame thrown clues years, mental health drew seek answers. refusing service comply? Sauce! Likely around year. Maybe two years. likely annual shot while. many times teach lesson old man Fuck shit. It‚Äôs big fucking hoax #infowars mean younger sister billionaire. family's social media. She'd able garner lot supporters. Keep keepin‚Äô on, NY. USA easier easy mode Plague Inc. countries ransomly reopen infect then.

The countries game tbh behaving rationallt USA come think it. Hell no, Florida Arizona showing us happens let guard down. one said stop. think people US CDC people dying England (not UK) homes elderly. known England would required protect them. someone works grocery store call bullshit. simple fact many higher paying jobs closed don‚Äôt college degree. won‚Äôt even look you. I‚Äôm banking Oxford they‚Äôve already made ton doses I'd worry slightly efficacy, know what? work, work, I'm screwed either way virus continues spread whether get vaccine not.

I'm going get soon possible hope best. want able go see family Vietnam die, I'll overjoyed vaccine available soon. Someone said day. like ""nah I'm good thanks"" fact successfully ran increasing military budget, claiming military ""in bad shape"" drives crazy. could anyone honestly believe military budget insufficient?  I'm unaware vaccines behave say regard population group. offer example? Age sometimes factor. read last sentence?? grasping straws. honestly think people hanging beach Florida covid risk tens thousands marching chanting shoulder shoulder (not mention fighting, occupation police precincts) absolutely believe science.

In fact, know science racist part BLM demands get rid STEM? Source? saying lying haven‚Äôt heard this. We've spiking cases month. worldometers 'serious critical condition' number starts rise I'll get worried. think countries successful combating resurgences heavy-handed dealing outbreaks. China Australia, quick react deal virus heavy-handedly, preventing growing.

We'll play whack-a-mole vaccine found. Thank kind words, friend. May happy healthy well. say government. Say GOP. ones anti science.  Hire sexy teachers build sexy roads buildings ? It‚Äôs both. Many states opened didn‚Äôt meet CSC guidelines opening. Even everyone wearing masks, you‚Äôre going hard time controlling spread virus open still widespread. yeah old fat milanese, unlike impeccable specimens US would never old fat live petrochemical smog soup like houston rely sails couldn‚Äôt get fuel Cape Verde stop 10
days Brazil huge wave understand anyway. Dog whistle? You‚Äôre trash. Ignored. Worldmeters third party source. Trust NYS numbers, Cuomo tweets every day.  tell haven‚Äôt read article. There‚Äôs point arguing someone doesn‚Äôt consider facts Lack leadership every level government testing duh......including dead Depending part, much Washington shrugging :( Doubt.  seems like partisan hit piece. example, point California issued lockdown March 19th, New York remained open. make mention, though, California literally first U.S. State issue lockdown order . New York fourth U.S. State issue lockdown order three days later.

It also mentions CDC guidelines prevented testing. That's something completely control State New York affected every U.S. State well. news debates polices new local federal legislature digestible way public understand proponent given time frame rebuttals later on

instead reality tv reality politics technology failure. intended campaign misinformation. inside bar looked like night opened Civil disagreement fine. matters incivility. like neighbor saying, ""yeah, like ni*****. Sorry disagree me. We're still friends though right? "" invalid viewpoint. Sir Reddit. Lol

I agree, lots self fulfilling narratives here. Mathematically you‚Äôll get ‚Äòmore cases‚Äô test more, raw numbers. important factor % Positive. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs increasing well. real issue. said, testing expose cases turn exposes grim reality seem think is.

As said, yes tests mean cases, doesn‚Äôt work ammo saying ‚Äòwell course cases testing more!‚Äô.... yes.... what‚Äôs point... ton cases undiagnosed. It‚Äôs good thing matter light paint in. anything it‚Äôs worse many people hadn‚Äôt tested whatever reason we‚Äôre likely isolating tested earlier; they‚Äôve exposing people longer, insinuating there‚Äôs even invisible outbreak occurring.

It‚Äôs bad situation. It‚Äôs really bad. It‚Äôs end world, zombie apocalypse either, Armageddon, it‚Äôs really, really bad, going get worse gets better.

We fucking stupid throw cloth mask Public 10 minutes. hard ask? Even you‚Äôre young person don‚Äôt think impact much, putting people‚Äôs lives risk.

Not directed btw, people general saying case increases positivity rate increases aren‚Äôt much revelation issue 100-person choir insanely singing maskless.

Superspreading event. wonder many cases generated? 100+ probably hope spring breaks bar hopping worth it!!!! Ugh!!!! Rip! Maybe ya'll praying wrong guy.. anyone tried spaghetti god south american monkey god thing.. sayinnnn' Bars meeting random people tight confined space socializing.

I think underestimate 7 billion births past century. right you. I'm bored hell, terrified leave house, except essentials like groceries. I'm depressed. meddling kids. Oh noooooo god whatever doooooo None people know anything Yup, people don‚Äôt want it, great, quicker get get life RIP plans travel abroad school

:/

Maybe one day. Public health state issue good reasons. NY clearly different issues Alaska Wyoming. Knowing that's case, treating every state simply foolish proposition. Neither Islam, stop fuck nuggets claiming Trump's travel ban racist it? Currently going route Hungary Poland, good amount requirements involved EU countries. I'm American blame TALK MOTHER LIKE /pence tan women,tequilla,corona,tacos, cheap services/ goods. Whats like. stay lower crime rate areas good. addition others already said, testing ramped lot states, new cases capturing mild asymptomatic cases previously went un-reported. people's pets animals? always risk. Vaccines come risks well pointed virus could mutate point vaccines may effective. people given freedom social distance protect way see fit? Making vaccinations mandatory make less charge bodies. long mandate people need implant microchips data collected better track diseases. vaccinations stake. line drawn somewhere. loss civil liberties taken lightly. death rate disease? 1% so? Can't new cases there's one left get corona. !remindme 3 months !remindme 3 months !remindme 3 months think country claim ""numbers bad"" one point, try counter spike cases ""more testing"" argument.

A recently fired Miami Gardens police officer shown graphic video January holding knee pregnant Black woman‚Äôs neck tasing multiple times stomach arrested  charged battery official misconduct, Miami-Dade State  Attorney announced Thursday.

The officer, Jordy Yanes Martel, seen video dragging  33-year-old Safiya Satchell vehicle putting knee  neck stunning twice Taser, Satchell  screams. Well, also cases asymptomatic people get scars infections well Georgia stay low long? state Trump said opened early. 

I wondered padding numbers. maybe not?

People make fun say would willing stay duration pandemic reduce risk really significantly happy make sacrifice health. Drones pretty well too. also know many doctors/nurses real life downplaying 

Yup.

I kinda double take doc original vid said ""Listen doctors politicians.""

And local family general practitioners getting wrong, we've also got people like ""Bakersfield duo"" highly publicized press releases people scientific credentials like ""Plandemic"" -- leading people wrong path: worse flu!.... hoax... less harmless say... masks help... masks actually hurt...

I know correct formula is, little complex ""listen doctors"". based cases/100,000 people past 14 days.

So India passed based numbers.

Although criteria much influenced number tests country. DeSantis given new instructions Trump. He'll stuck endless loop then. billionaires? seems come go. SARS-CoV-1 linked civet, read anywhere SARS-CoV-2 is. link saw that? tried googling find anything, thank you. Thanks, great point. I'm going bring doctor well suggesting small dosage Valtrex, hard body. 

Also I'm going start taking liver detoxifyer supplement. currently take B complex read good kidney health. right take daily:

Vyvanse 50 mg
Yaz (birth control used acne PMS symptoms)
Valtrex (I cannot see MG bottle tore privacy, read standard dosage 500-1000 mg adults. I'm curious cutting 250 would helpful less harsh body?)

For supplements...
-Standard Women's Multi-vitamin Whole Foods
-Mageneisum

She‚Äôs still crazy jerk. deserve sympathy empathy here. employees deal right thing deserve higher pay dealing Karens. 1400 cases. 20 deaths compared 128 flu deaths--with vaccine--in 2019. So, yeah, immune. *breathe Sold american, they're something right don‚Äôt need go NYC know truth. well, it‚Äôs advised moment  feel like it‚Äôs less people GOING politicians stuff, plutocrats media hijacked plane on. 
It‚Äôs pretty much wild ride lives point. type fail mention protests?

The protests started weekend Cal ‚Äúopened‚Äù. seeing many people asymptomatic even know got it, would follow people long term effects severe enough ""kiss bodily functions goodbye""?? get worried think freaking little much right. probably coming realization strategy pretending virus might work. finally agree that's fake news right there! Maybe numbers backwards?   no. antibody testing told us people (like 2% sampled) antibodies. Masks worked always worked. worked SARS. worked Spanish Flu. It‚Äôs ridiculous ever argument it. Thank you! lost credibility throughout crisis. makes want move Europe now, but.. know.. also note reason haven‚Äôt heard bc vaccines typically go extensive trials w large n /diverse population ensure work different populations, sure one would heard specifically works one race bc usually wouldn‚Äôt get final phases clinical trials Fyi, check library Kanopy. free Great Courses may differ what's free Prime. wear masks CA. it‚Äôs mainly it‚Äôs required. ~~If~~ virus still raging US October *States bad job*: ‚ÄúThey didn‚Äôt told do. wouldn‚Äôt listen. listened me, things would‚Äôve lot better.‚Äù

Anybody using anecdotal evidence measure literally anything isn‚Äôt worth listening to. America could keel die , still wouldn‚Äôt give shit. actually go NYC, you‚Äôd see actual truth. Yep. H&amp;M, Coles distribution centre, people working quarantine hotel seem recent ones. Spreading across family clusters. aren‚Äôt protests. agree actually. 

I disagree blaming administration. think anything centralized power could done honestly. 

People dumb really care. Locking 2+ months brightest way go either. think people going get out? Prohibition thing, country behaved tried best short while. really try go dry, like stupid government regulations real staying power ended huge mess preeminently changed Government citizen relationship bad.

If Walmart still open granny shopping without mask (after told wear mind you) whole thing bound fail. NYC even close subways. Excuses reasons subways kind biggest vector path spread. 

Governments altogether Prez Mayors attacked problem sledgehammer used scalpel. forgot human element forged lambasting citizens failed left right.  

COVID-19 shows systematic failure government across spectrum. got whole smorgasbord failures mixed messages well intention lies straight propaganda. 

My neighbor deals medical equipment warehouses full PPE. No-one take because...it's veterinarian equipment books. So, millions N95 masks government let get allocated hospitals intended vets. 

And live Ohio excellent. Cough, shortness breath, headache, body aches, smell taste, extreme fatigue.  want progress. I‚Äôve stuck quarantine feeling like garbage week waiting test result. Looking hope. First all, you‚Äôre looking reason yell don‚Äôt tread me. 
Secondly, wrong. stop. American, hope annoys Trump young person 25, call bullshit. Blame parents kids. seen projections work one way accurately yet. 

That county almost 1% death rate Covid, far smallest I've seen large metro area. article one paragraph. Hardly great journalism.  Bidets much better tp It‚Äôs little harder that. long meet whatever Houston‚Äôs restaurant threshold is, classified restaurant.

In states, well Fauci. shits Trump/Pence/some governor say. 244 years respectable. Hicks gonna hick. Fuck south Um coronavirus numbers time-lag, deaths even so. I‚Äôm pretty sure takes time officially called COVID death. Deaths 600/day Well, maybe Harris County safe say *all* businesses requiring masks employees customers they're taking answer. Mask wearing, here, higher ever seen it. beyond wildest dreams people complying like big deal. literally thought would never much compliance night day. noticed drop customers right lockdown numbers think stimulus money unemployment cash run folks, though. They'd stupid restrict travel places like US. found funny article posted specifically called China needing return favor. Ya, rally shows others countries effective US not. seems they're instantly taking action dozen cases. US, see 5k cases days state get messages like ""Don't worry, hospitals still plenty capacity."" heard anything. Last time talked him, online classes stopped rotations.  bet look male vs female within profession see gap unemployment. mean issues, think driven sexism. could wrong tho. spoke one owners club. owner said nightclub opened registered restaurant.

Entertainment 720 shrimp cocktail wall, using loophole. don‚Äôt even need perfectly healthy beat this. fact I‚Äôm 17 obese gives 99.999% chance survival choices, unfortunately consequences... older article illustrates example little better. states reintroduced similar steps last week. expect we'll see lot week. ""we""  country Houston, Texas in? I'm permabanned r/conservative. People got bored said fuck mask Bye Felicia know came CHY-NAH mean ain't wrong lmao. understand saying ‚Äúeasier‚Äù, I‚Äôm sure recognize genuine connection someone quickly outweigh concerns easy difficult regularly see them. Especially since actually quite simple, easy, pandemic hit. long afford travel, is. wear mask, Mr. Pence point really. articles written, protest two, minimal coverage, month later one remember care No, really haven't.

3 months ago trying help protect supply lines PPE essential health workers.

They've since updated recommendations mask supplies become much available known effectiveness COVID. problem exhausting air cost. outside air cold, cost heating new fresh intake air indoor temp high. outside air warm/humid, cost conditioning fresh air, high. Retrofitting heaters air conditioners sorts capacities, also expensive....  exhaust filtered pushed outside, anyway, someone outside building could breathing near exhaust point.

By using existing recirc system, filtering air, capital cost operating cost minimized. ideal, practical enough retrofit. Mixed signals. tried UV Lights via sun Florida failed confuses DeSantis. Next line disinfectants, they‚Äôre still waiting instructions like inject true. 

No one sees long time job negative. long time good company basically best thing resume. 

A lot job hopping salary bumps sign things weighted favor employees. Honestly don‚Äôt think matter I‚Äôm American living overseas UK. can‚Äôt even go different country Europe passport says I‚Äôm american? even point article? mean, spent 3/4 article talking MERS outbreak Middle East, homophobic South Korea is. couple paragraphs issue hand. expert weigh ins, possible solutions. fair American culture fucking terrifying. perhaps could third factor

Those wear masks may less cautious quarantine, thus go often cautious wear masks

Perhaps people see without masks going frequently actually aware risks involved jailed  I‚Äôm Victorian one wants us anywhere right haha Stop going antivaxxers pros vaccines. country accept american refugees? Happy Cake Day! think read research referring to... except kill 34 minutes. Meanwhile planet earth, take virus 34 minutes travel aerosol droplets person talking (without mask) respiratory system. again, little knowledge dangerous thing ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è now? ü¶Ö=üêë way school funding works doesn‚Äôt allow that

THEN FUCKING FIX FUNDING SYSTEM.

I'm Education I'm fucking tired hearing fucking bullshit. dude absolute buffoon, freedoms aren‚Äôt infringed mask. basic safety precaution order prevent spread COVID-19. Stop absolutely blinded dumbass conspiracy theories grow brain yourself.

-Herb I.... realized dirty kid world..... one ate boogers shower SHOCKING damage local economy would barely old people die (along younger people). harsh reality. truth.

Ending restrictions today would massively beneficial economy. Well, original post, use official data calculation respect authorities. assume country number cases based projections/estimates/conspiracies whatsoever. one brought specific countries tried compare. besides tests conducted 90 mil u mentioned included detecting antibodies? Otherwise, conducted way long initial outbreak. topic, still kinda topic, can, tell consult plastic surgeon. got deviated septum fixed insurance took care it. don‚Äôt know sort financial situation you‚Äôre kind insurance have, quality breathing, life, gone ten fold since procedure. quarantine 14 days, same, theoretically good. say, everyone goes grocery shopping today, leave house 14 days. symptoms = visit possible. that, outside visits + 6 feet apart good. see gloves necessary touching other. words hollow refuses wear mask It‚Äôs actually sickening hear dialogue change now. people dying thousands NY promoting fake drugs telling people drink bleach. said sarcastic. take trump supporters realize big fuck He's cheating, antibodies loads generations Coronavirus! 

/S Fox News Local Fox affiliates largely autonomous news organization IIRC. Edison. isn‚Äôt even second wave, that‚Äôs sad part.m, it‚Äôs still first. Second wave fall That's bit extreme really hope STDs can‚Äôt jump species well. deserve top comment lol arguing Sheriff anyone authority matter enforce law regardless ridiculous law may be. tens thousands risk lives getting year? even face total failure people keep supporting them. Ya certainly feel weird breathing too. know many materials patterns tried, found much better others. imagine feels comfortable easy breathe may different me, hopefully resources buy craft different ones, eventually find something manageable! üòÅ stuck ""home"" internship.

I study abroad. managed find internship home country.

I internship outbreak happened. stuck there. Luckily managed flight back. Yep. Don‚Äôt open indoor restaurants bars. Imagine thinking perfectly healthy really not. lot people died rushed vaccines. Really magic perfect enemy good. even voting presidential election votes count? get voting local. point us voting main election electoral college shoves results window anyway? 'iPhOnEs' always come context? 'iphones' benchmark that's laughably low.

BUT IPHONES!! What's average delay reporting deaths? insane.

Here's hardest thing ever endure career, may literally even kill you, keep mind rewarded we're even cutting wages. Thanks. Oh, PS, here's T-shirt says hero shit. Islam race. Would say Christian Buddhist race? Europe spikes well. whatever. one really cares truth. people npcs seems. thought too, Trump would immediately take credit covid vaccine officials everywhere would urging people get vaccinated hopes stopping spread virus elections 5 months. democrat mayors it, republican mayors rock hard place. issuing stay-at-home order undermined republican sherriffs. die better tell people covid, die drug overdose like everyone else! It‚Äôs Fox News... allowed leave cottage groceries stuff, that‚Äôs it? Sounds like pretty solid plan actually... I've terrible asthma since child wearing mask real length time actually pretty difficult me.

My solution stay fuck stores everything delivered. Would like hit Trader Joes every while? Sure, shopping without mask birth right absolutely disrespectful fellow citizens. Nah, forgot Europe got hit first, made sense US banned Europe first. way worse US now, so... 
Smarter case follow science. Definitely, problem lot vunerable people require assistence young people. Nursing homes infamous example. examples include multi-generational households. Yay new excuse poor go vacation. going give dude benefit doubt assume sarcasm. checked profile. Yikes. could help sub reporting post reliable source. prevents site appearing sub content like [this site, post popular one it. influx popularity, site going show search results such, OP account going seem reliable due high karma count. Permenant brain damage common often undetectable. think Australian constitution may prevent tolls etc state borders. US here. Serious question; indoor dining night clubs opened Australia? city really good [0 cases day, 90 cases day one week] till opened indoor dining bars. Sorry, do. going waste year shitty work conditions could potentially get infected working retail, food, Amazon warehouse. probably get buried, fianc√© British, stuck UK. supposed come school US August. one know anything student visas gonna go down? Haha I'm alcoholic happens regularly funny see surprise peoples faces. Like telling fatal disease still hang cause I'm cool fatal disease though...or something like that...üòÅ  milk maids!!! Welcome conversation, Dickweed. also ‚Äúwave‚Äù. South Korea probably half dozen mini-outbreaks since first wave. Media gets excited calls ‚Äúsecond waves‚Äù assume either people lying varies wildly location and/or demographic. Outside Costco mandatory enter, see maybe 50-60% people wearing masks trips regular grocery type stores. even want think bar/restaurant crowds tourist towns... Oh choice. People need get notion everything right free whatever choose. everything world right. Travel, example, privilege countries require immunization proof Yellow Fever traveling many places Africa last checked school, parents show proof least MMR (among things heck remember full list now) think recently colleges pushing get proof Hepititis immunizations students campus. 

you 100% free choose get vaccine, also choose consequences go along that. \*shrug\* stand one. It‚Äôs VERY, deadly drug. wouldn‚Äôt FDA approved used 60 years! 

There higher risk patients screened make determination. fairly easy done visit. remove masks eat though least outside table.

Social pressure hard thing buck. people point stare though, wtf? probably get buried, fianc√© British, stuck UK. supposed come school US August. one know anything student visas gonna go down? something stupid ass half measures could putting shit behind us now... Hey, charitable. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. one knows everything. 

Sure, might made one [honest back late April. *at time*, head national COVID-19 task force, full resources entire federal government's medical specialists briefing him, 63 days. still onboarding. 

And, *may* literally physically inside Mayo Clinic time, flanked dozens medical doctors, spoke fluent English... 100% doctors wearing masks, perhaps hear clearly saying stuff like ""please put mask"".

(""/s"", case COVID-19 task force leadership reading this). us live would like friends knock off.

And yes, American citizen. gonna make impossible get home. Genuinely asking, running/biking park, mask on? Waddle fat boy, go get teeth fixed aswell think false dilemma. We're assumption manage affairs better governments states, especially federal level --- done relatively nothing. Neat, article two months ago vote alien invasion. can‚Äôt get much worse maybe they‚Äôll end nice. aren‚Äôt though hope least go beaches bars first. government flexible, would also little oversight great deal reactionary power, neither compatible Federal government. Ever countries? Believe me, Tokyo like rural Montana. Beijing like city Michigan. American cities compare crowded Seoul. Social distancing rarely option cities. crowded even NYC rush hour. protect social distancing possible? Obviously use mask.
If talk small cities US (most US cities small compared Asian cities) social distancing easily observed, focusing masks forgetting social distancing stupid lazy. ‚ÄúDEA StAtS say so???‚Äù read article, assume based comments you, actually confirmed. Good chance, yeah, technically still legally air list made legally binding.   mentions right article received $20k donations... parent 6-year-old attempted three months ""remote learning,"" assure actually much better learning all. Kids young simply developmentally capable independent learning. spent hours every day trying cajole Kindergartener schoolwork, also trying full-time job; hated it, learned hardly anything, mostly resulted daily frustration tears. parents I'm acquainted felt way- massive failure.

I attempt remote learning unless literally options. would absolutely hire private tutor instead. got banned within hour posting exactly posted here. hate can‚Äôt stand half people around forgot mention also doesn‚Äôt shovel, snowblowing mouth. gets like 80% though. ignoring pandemic long did, failing implement 1st world safety protocols airports, undermining Fauci, getting bored still demanding control testing process order suppress it, sure, citizens dumb chance way adult Oval. least office that. I‚Äôm one wears one gets subtle lingering looks mine on. course. turning experts expertise. Medical experts tell us healthcare, economic experts tell us economy, legal experts tell us law, factored comprehensive policy people vision intelligence weigh various concerns other. arrogance experts thinking final word policy led embarrassing spectacle healthcare professionals making sudden about-face mass protests politically sanctioned causes. one needed criticism one asked approval either. Trump would've kept Obama's pandemic response plan original team would vastly different. article says stimulus check made 100 trays. received $20k donations rest. Watch trump going mad even tho thing earlier also hit people car fly cabin. Yay. Nothing like able go back Germany visit family country live can‚Äôt take things seriously. FDA US. Chinese. I'm doubtful idea working on. Exactly ! federal government showing great example !üôÑ Jesus, that‚Äôs kind scary. getting trapped country power‚Äôs incompetence. Dr Li eye doctor reprimanded spreading factually wrong information. information wrong zero expertise. defense meant well, people accept died. Nothing China ever said virus wrong, including virus ""preventable controllable"", is. FUCK. hope doesn‚Äôt count UK cause planning migrating... truth. many jealous European inbreds anyway. I‚Äôm ready visit Smokey mountains April 30? Two months ago? Seriously? 50% country can't even read fifth grade level expect understand anything? nightmare situations I‚Äôve wondered about. many kids lost interactions teachers students. little moments teacher says good job nice effort little boosts (I know oh well school days). online thing tool, kids could easily find way starring screen long already issue kids. Even found free tutor, would want coming house? Can‚Äôt go library tutoring, likely won‚Äôt reopen schools (in area follow similar schedules). right answer anything anymore. Everything world needs constantly analyzed. God bless you‚Äôre time being. keep safe healthy. Maybe try work small life skills, like financial stuff find it. good luck keep good fight. Getting 200 million+ doses gonna HUGE undertaking Americans dont like truth virus can't infect show fear. know that? proof rest world intelligent Absolutely- anyone sits around watching TV going see impact memory overall cognition.

People need think brain muscle needs exercised . don‚Äôt use it, atrophies.

Most stoners would see huge decrease memory issues played memory games every day, read books, expanded hobbies bit more. 

Taking day two sobriety also pretty helpful. Gotta give brain rest sometimes. TN cooking books start. much winning üëèüëè looking stats there‚Äôs chance obese I‚Äôm not. goes without saying, sadly there‚Äôs thousands millions see opposite way, including president Anyone uses word ‚Äúhooey‚Äù immediately dismissed. correct information there, yet continue ignore it. *That* onus them. Great info, thanks! would also gotten rid pandemic preparedness team. try things.

what I'm sure

-_- New Yorker here: Mistakes made everywhere, single person entity blame. Regarding NY, fueled fire first major US epicenter CDC testing still didn‚Äôt work. Obviously 31K deaths nothing celebrate, given work with, NY overall great job. rest states should‚Äôve learned NY‚Äôs successes mistakes, plus don‚Äôt faulty testing worry anymore. Right now, Florida like, ‚ÄúOkay great let‚Äôs take prior knowledge throw window!‚Äù  area almost total compliance. Notice WOKE people forgotten preventative care eating properly (no corn syrup, seed based oils, sugared soda, etc...) REDUCE CO-MORBIDITIES tied COVID-19.

You reduce blood pressure lose weight reduce risk major complications ICU visit lower probability.

If 200M people focused lock downs instead tiger King, fewer deaths would happened.

Nope, ONE human pushed articles I've seen. woke crowd, politicians, ER doctors, etc.... Instead, focus improving Healthcare system. Noble enough.

Improve Man directly, system repairs man. Absolutely. need contain, isolate, support immunocompromised contact IC populations self-designate, predetermined supports allow multi-step isolation program reintroduction similar populations (linear IC need base comingling). enormous part ask employees designate subset groups IC/IC household, mask-optional. schedule businesses open different times, run subsets, designate specific stores IC/mask optional. must give best PPE people cannot survive this, us unaffected immune systems. thought brown people fields, moved young people... He's going ""boys boys"" defense increasing cases inadequate testing numbers. Nope, I‚Äôm quite fit. You‚Äôre lying, however. know are. take couch 38 yr oldSIL dying cirrhosis, 1st ICU, ran room get put cancer ward, needed room people actual cancer sent nursing home Tuesday apparently sending rehB facility tend open wounds healing part Raleigh NC area everyone entering businesses mask. Outside mix keep distance meets requirement governor's rules. see many people nose mask though, even employees making food sort defeats whole purpose.

Sat night downtown Raleigh lots 20-30 yr olds masks groups going bars even mask requirement posted. local news site interviewed usual ""I believe media"", ""God decide get sick"", ""I'm afraid get sick"" reasons. predict we'll see efforts smudge data, hope folks brave enough blow whistle refuse. 

I think count continue due low testing numbers coding causes, pneumonia, alzheimer's (already 15,000 would expect months), natural causes, etc.

As discrepency excess deaths becomes big ignore, fear attempts classify mortality counts. Total crystal ball talking here, prediction/fear.  clever feel? Ooooops. Trump say? Serious question: wife two N95 masks sanding work pandemic bunch surgeons masks everyone has. Whenever thing significant exposure (like food shopping) wear two N95s over. limit this? really use maybe week told that? Sheeple line Haha good question! Thanks well-reasoned analysis. want family part passing anyone, even know them. Especially matter simple missing one two seasons. helpful - thanks! Pence saying ""wear mask"" Donald continues refuse wear one publicly kinda like Melania saying ""be best"" ""don't online bully"" even though one worst internet bullies world husband.

This administration ""Do say, do"". guess there's nothing else be, since asshole top think rules apply him.  point 1, agreed. Point 2, no, borderline delusional look rate deaths decreases constantly getting smaller smaller, rapidly increasing positivity rates multiple states indicate spreading epidemic , assume deaths keep decreasing indefinitely.  needed, SARS MERS burned vaccine required. lazy read? would explain reticence. ""Verily ye fully fornicated, saith Lord"" Cucker Tarlson explain one ya boy? Lmao nothing narcissistic supply. Well done, America. took 4.5-5.5weeks Iran (the comparable curve ours) cases started clearly re-rising (5/1) deaths started clearly re-rising (6/1 6/6, depending day you‚Äôd define start): less two weeks ([6/19 first then-abnormally high day](: we‚Äôre already asking fatality surge is. American impatience means never ever going get like countries. whne doubt, sun orbit around america. not? mean stop spread ! appears sort correct. 40% passports close 100 million travel internationally half Canada Mexico. imagine huge chunk central south american countries. Overseas 35 million, literally rest world, europe bars really responsible? I'm stunned so-called public health officials politicians claim closing bars notching restaurant capacities 75% 50% going save thousands lives. 

Wear mask, stay home much possible til motherfucker blows over. American, thank Christ, great here, Europe overrated. There's lag surges cases surges deaths. part comprehending? ‚ÄòThese findings nonsense, echo chamber banning people disagreeing thing, all. sure getting downvoted. People faulted wanting share personal info. fucking article changed Houston specifically perhaps could understand better. math source says it‚Äôs false..... wow, never knew that. Europe‚Äôs end see it, US end, seems silly let people less likely citizens need technocracy. Except LA county hotspot. Blue team HQ. flip end roll'n ü§£ Lmao, reddit place full facts, logic, reality hasn‚Äôt‚ÄîEurope completely closed foreigners Spent 8 years China, bitched Tips Applebees. doubt it. Ya say? can't reason anyone position reason into.

And sad ultimate truth - amount logic, reason, rational thinking going change mind someone used none things get are. something I‚Äôve noticed too. bring statistics numbers actual science argument d0omers stop arguing can‚Äôt.

I really someone today say ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt research don‚Äôt know‚Äù like I‚Äôm literally giving research right here. look spread dumb stuff. Smh smh That's mighty fine counterfactual history tearjerking got there.

You claiming, without evidence, Sweden enacted measures Norway, would death rate Norway.

Belgium enacted much stricter measures Norway Sweden, still suffered higher death rate Sweden. would stricter measures Sweden get results Norway Belgium instead? Brussels Stockholm comparable population density, Oslo's much lower, therefore, clearly, Belgium closer match Sweden. No? 

There many, many unknown variables determined outcome. sub suffers persistent wrongthink claiming strictness measures ordered one be-all-end-all deciding factor death rate, simply true. That‚Äôs total cases, active cases Mexican food white people

AKA 99.9% Mexican restaurants United States Sick burn man would comfortable enough leave 5th/6th grader home. mom left (12) younger sister (11) unable find childcare; able take care hours got school (3P) mom got home work (7/8P)

I'm 35. can't image kids less independent back 90s. technology easier parents keep kids, easier kids school work. ideal, think 3-6 months tall task.

Also, economic view-point, kid caught COV19 school &amp; passed parent, quarantine and/or symptoms could keep parent work, possibly put employment jeopardy. Unless death toll increases drastically don‚Äôt see true. 125k 400 million barely blip. Yeah. virus wasn‚Äôt expected wonder statement get banned faster. 

On second thought anything information likely get banned. absolutely true volume tests increased dramatically. clear epidemic waxing South, bad confirmed cases would suggest, exponentially testing April. I‚Äôm Canadian, learned little ago actually loophole border. Americans cross Alberta go north order get Alaska. 

Problem is, Americans try stay Alberta.

Shhhh... fit propaganda Yeah, granted lot videos back we're edited, fabricated something else. Like context welding, burning infected buildings etc.

But yes. world known seriousness January. world chose look way.  Conservatives blast spreading disease infecting many people can. know may kill someone without consequence pumped it. leaders already knew shit. many close friends family exposed shocking me.  still better Obama Hillary Something note county closes beaches people travel nearest open beach. half measures seems almost ensure spread virus. remember Memorial weekend city "" taken "" Miami / Orlando strict rules regarding restaurants beaches.  Funny quickly America adapted old Soviet Union China tactics censor distort. give fuck. sick you. fire die it. seen anything indicating Covid-19 foodbourne virus, yes. Yeah, though initial outbreak Mexico fairly scary CFR (that's made reaction pretty strong). Turned jacked, otherworldly, influenza. Vaccines dealt pretty well. Incidentally two great things stock article go experts define populist leaders definitely caring people. aware core support base inherently narrow, consists ‚Äúthe real, authentic people‚Äù deserve support good government. And, even vocal opposition certain quarters, insist represent entire nation; assume control entire state apparatus name people basis appeals ‚Äònationalism‚Äô. provides place liberal dissent opposition scope checks balances procedures ‚Äì legal constitutional ‚Äì might constrain leader.

Trump essentially divisive persons. key strategy, Jan-Werner Muller notes, ‚Äúdividing citizens blaming minorities sorts Other‚Äù, unified race and/ faith basis, also shaped monolithic defined essential negative traits ‚Äì criminality, lack patriotic ardour, gross misconduct, even poor personal hygiene.

Trump again. think best evidence people clinically significant course probably going full immunity least better part year, much improved ability fight subsequent infection good that. could side effect coronavirus could ventilator heavy sedation. remember grandmother, emergency surgery, convinced doctors nurses witches. didn‚Äôt remember recovered enough go home. don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs new virus. research needed. press-up prove it. No, I'm joking. Whataboutism. Typical bhakt. It‚Äôs shame didn‚Äôt learn happened China, Italy, Spain, France.... months ago. 

You know asked people handle hit months line. Hell didn‚Äôt even need ask, doctors published experiences open. It‚Äôs open, people basically forgot corona 2 months ago Yes, dumb people actually believe discrimination

What is? choice action. actions, nature, consequences. deny this, must argue causality.

Your choice speak freely resulted consequence getting called out. Pence pull 25th Amendement Trump happens ""I there, great concert,"" tweeted. ""There plenty room people wanted social distance. Masks nothing. Can't live fear forever... venue large wanted could 50 ft away people times... plenty things could get sick that's worse COVID. Chase Rice put great show! 

If mentality, God help us. event contributed spread, hope contact tracing able showcase wrong doing. interview Fox News' Sean Hannity last week, Trump said virus ""fading away"". Speaking the¬†WSJ, said people might wearing masks show disapproval suggested, contrary credible public health guidance, mask-wearing might increase people's risk infection.

Can‚Äôt wait country fall apart. New York terrible model acting outbreak. good model how, America, put outbreak (hint: relatively strict stay home) and, hopefully, reopen soon. 

In contrast, Texas Florida probably going Northern Italy reopening soon quickly despite cases going -- cautionary example. Covid goes there, big problem. time infection death long two months.

You probably take statistics class pay attention talk mean standard deviation. Alaska Hawaii come too. kind need go Europe gf wanted propose Unless working medical field first responder wearing masks. require special training use decrease oxygen levels blood could cause severe problems unless know warning signs watch for. I'm Kansas things pretty tame. outbreaks meat packing plants assisted living. far terrible. Unfortunately, job essential, worker expendable. Ah yes Arizona, state voted Re**blican 11 times last 12 elections. Truly prime example swing state /s doesn‚Äôt actually matter. mods ban people see users posting subs. CFR COVID-19 5% date, 0.26%, IFR, IFR Black Death 45% Really sorry that's awful.. think know count. depends seasonal winds direction. Usually people plan sails match trade vaccines human trials based past coronavirus vaccine research already tested shown safe. like Oxford example. worry much safe, one vaccines already development shown safe So... he‚Äôs pro condom distribution now, right?  Much sucks point I'm probably hesitant whatever vaccine Trump finds CCP.

Only latter would scrutinised West made available here, would earnestly trying regain goodwill left stake... former pushed Hydroxychloroquine kind miracle cure, far beyond science said, long past caution-by date. Praying hail mary.

We'll see, guess.  course he's fine it.  nba disney also shoulder blame. Indoor dining opened social distancing, includes pubs (like diner/bar). Nightclubs yet reopen. clusters (this isn‚Äôt second wave) linked 2 big extended family gatherings, suburbs. 

Authorities going house suburb testing everyone ! Symptomatic asymptomatic. Florida sure lot excess ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù deaths though Deaths usually 1-2 weeks behind short crappy article. know they're reporting info have, damn, depressing. illegal make access info anything open automated. [It 
 
I know hell Williamsburg's dysfunction is, many NY's stories COVIDiocy come there. chance extend to...everywhere? Asking friend. pull numbers thin air? 25% IFR without treatments ridiculous. even 25% COVID-infected need hospitalization, much less would die treatment. People need get out. stay inside keep sanity long. mean can't wisely though. could election acting human couldn‚Äôt.

If US demand children use masks school would probably country that. interesting compare numbers. epidemic resuming, there's doubt that. also true we're testing exponentially March, therefore catching tens thousands cases would missed months earlier. 1:1 comparable metrics deaths, we're 2-3 weeks away able compare.  Thats problem. non unified response, waste time. Hahaha. 

Build WALL said.

Nah, world wall up.

Cheeto Chief. Good thing I'm poor travel! survive then... Oh, killing LOT distinction?

80,000 people died 2017-2018 flu season america. **None** needed die. wear mask back protect at-risk population, hypocrite? almonds every screenwriter. Also good wine. They'll ok. true, we‚Äôre irresponsible things open sit option. opened fast, order pick option delivery apps could easily gotten us through. People without masks everywhere live San Diego county. common illness involves high fever. Don‚Äôt know anyone expected COVID different. Thanks! obviously comparing deaths per capita total deaths. It‚Äôs also nothing like terrorist attack: governments making policy decisions delicate balance lots things. government earth isn‚Äôt actively making policy decisions could seen lens, whiners it‚Äôs gun laws, pollutions laws, emission laws, drug laws, alcohol laws etc etc etc. person Muslim country said ‚Äúyour country alcohol legalized literally committing genocide intentionally killing thousands citizens‚Äù probably wouldn‚Äôt agree statement.

Thank Good....now cases gone....that's works, right?.................................. American here. people telling take vaccine people led charge far, better believe I‚Äôm going hesitant. unfortunately, means places stay shut. Can‚Äôt wear mask you‚Äôre drinking crowded bar eating crowded restaurant. bar doesn‚Äôt outdoor space, it‚Äôs Petri dish. awful. half million people 6 months, seems picking steam. Sure, simple. tri-state area. Every area get turn. That's virus spread works. Anything else southerner answer you. Lol always buy hurricane season somehow never remember eating it. buying It‚Äôs law enforcement. Businesses don‚Äôt want fines liability would also likely refuse service statewide mandate. look series Karens grocery store freak outs get denied. lot businesses wouldn‚Äôt stick policy without force law don‚Äôt want hassle loss revenue. Agree 100%. think tai-state area already ways yea, could ""guard"" irresponsible states would go long way help freedom here. put hard work 4+ months, fucking benefit it. Holy shit I'm allowed donate now? Wear Mask!.... don‚Äôt. Yeah, wartime morale historically driven many decisions, hiding pandemic seems one misguided ones.

I knew name came from, know virus came from. idea first detected Kansas! Texas Florida, presumably GOP controlled states, heavily underreporting cases deaths.

The US basically already worst hit COVID, likely worse even appears total 150 new personnel tested positive COVID-19 among Maharashtra Police last 48 hours, taking total number positive cases 4,666.Besides, one death police personnel also reported state, per Maharashtra Police.  last 48 hours, 1 death 150 new COVID-19 positive cases reported Maharashtra Police. total number positive cases rises 4,666 death toll 57,‚Äù said Maharashtra Police.With 1,59,133 COVID-19 cases belt, Maharashtra continues worst-affected state country 67,615 active cases 84,245 patients cured discharged state far. 
The death toll due COVID-19 stands 7,273 state. find hard believe.. shrug buddy always said similar thing never understood went bed thinking that.

Are ex-pat? Shift work? 

Because worked normal-ish hours, even east coast obvious bedtime tap-in Clinton. American, living Los angeles, CA. 
I approve decision.  threat people's lives. Would rather spread disease lose money? Take walk. Whoa Link isnt working either. Pretty sure ship sailed fucking ago You‚Äôre. post never said didn‚Äôt, dipshit Chronic allergies nasal polyps (holding removal), know mouth breathing. 

I hate world become ‚Äúmy comfort important anyone around me‚Äù. People damned fixated privacy blasting life social media. Basic trust strangers eroded everyone suspects one another good. 

These sovereign citizen folks think whatever want freedom... agggghhh. Right. Hong Kong Taiwan South Korea Australia New Zealand, everyone side world covering China.

Which probably million cases /s I've always theory never expected win first election, could say build shitty brand. real story pretty much psychologically unequipped handle virus thanks leadership gaslighting daily past 3.5 years, causing recession left 40% Mainers unable afford $400 emergency pandemic even started. 

(Trump's trade wars hurt Maine's lobster industry, defends confederate monuments 10 year prison sentences, wants dismantle 5,000 mile ocean monument Obama left us conserve environment) include Moon Jae too. Curious. acting like ever go away? Like we'd wore masks March.. (which media told us do) it' ""blow over"".

It's really going away get form herd immunity even it'll keep coming back without sort drug suppress it. 

Second waves always table. started places mean won't. **blatantly** disingenuous. CDC extrapolates lab-collected data small number hospitals spread across country. try compare widespread ""symptoms=confirmed"" coronavirus across entire country fucking shameless.

You care lives, care mad. Americans, hate you. stay Iceland!
- Lars Erickson Huh like that... Serology studies grounded science. guess argue science conjecture. Yes really bad Italy, one point situation u guys. high increases cases one point highest death toll, hospitals full, icu‚Äôs full etc Omg I'm sorry! sub rules. read them? No, solution. ""we live it"" really stop. Maybe can, good you. ks living goes years, simply gonna kill myself, even doubt point sure far alone. forced bullshit years, death toll mental health make 1 percent mortality corona look like child's game. maskless fuckers Home Depot instead jacking general direction, I‚Äôd say ‚Äúsure, slap sock it‚Äù! Elephant walks totally chill face face good man There‚Äôs got middle-road.

Masks social distancing. people that, we'll fine obviously people stupid aged horribly lmao Serious answer: bots, propagandists, individuals psychosis deliberately flamed, along many good faith conservatives.

It's much ""safe space"" latter, form rest kind hunting ground sadly. Thanks Eh fuck dude, let's go bowling America fucked 1st world country right now, full corruption beyond reasonable scope - strongest military world incomprehensible margins. countries start worried... I'd argue general state public's distancing today actually MUCH better going March, even perfect. Yes there's portion population flaunting masks distance pretend live business-as-usual, business-as-usual exactly vast majority people living thru first half March (at least states). number people making hygiene, distancing, masks, etc. integral part daily lifestyle today orders magnitude pre-lockdown. mention sports arenas still closed, travel down, schools shuttered, offices closed, etc. 

Maybe I'm optimistic even 70/30 split YOLO'ers concerned distancers better 99/1 split common Feb, March April. Thats gotta count something? happens communlst trashcan regime. One day chilling living life BOOM!- 400,000 people lose freedom recourse, protests, nothing. Fuck CCP, fuck left, fuck anyone wants bring tyrannical, inhuman garbage shores. It‚Äôs gonna happen. Unfortunately we‚Äôd likely rush one first, disaster. We‚Äôll paint flat. Please don‚Äôt send back.

Honestly toss trash bin, I‚Äôll take carrot pretend it‚Äôs him. Lol ""hella"" bay area. never heard term San Diego till became friends someone San Francisco Nothing ironic conservative mask hater calling someone else ""brainwashed"" world walling American stupidity. ‚ÄúSomething happened‚Äù. Uh yeah people essentially threatened return work. cause create content catered it? 

I think times forget much control audience has. cater beliefs audience audience watch something else. 

It's easy blame media vs blaming people themselves. personally see Fox News media this. grass roots people often misinterpreting data personal experience. 

NYC America America virus hardly around called peak. America large nation multiple local areas. areas like NYC hit hard peaked lock down. others locked virus really spreading there. 

So people seemed fake. Add natural hatred mistrust ""media"" (aka certain media) perfect environment take seriously. 

And audience audience going try convince them? going give want? mention often bias creators matches audience. literally part audience create for.  perfect echo chamber.

Just remember see biases echo chambers call disagree with. Wow site sucks. Can‚Äôt even read article without bs ads. get past UX QA? Like okay let‚Äôs hide read million video thumbnails nothing article. NYC like half population state, we're talking state. overall state rate antibodies really low.

antibodies NYC explain Buffalo Rochester great Covid-19. So, overall according CDC 4.6 coronavirus infected would need hospitalizations 100k. varies age younger crowd I'll leave 4.6.

Coronavirus leads believe patients hospital coronavirus, coronavirus cause death.

Also, seem concerned. still Phase 1 Phase 2 pandemic conditions. Lol sterilize oven set 160 30 mins ... think Stanford came one ... otherwise inhale virus n95 sits mask live long time ... meanwhile got karens throwing food ground grocery stores they're asked wear mask He‚Äôs Floridiot Hey remember handled HIV epidemic Indiana? incredible became Vice President that. I'm ready go Yosemite grand canyon. Breath taking views there. I‚Äôve traveled many European countries saw lots poor people there. you‚Äôre helpful other, don‚Äôt help get streets..? smug ‚Äúwe take care everyone‚Äù mentality it‚Äôs clearly true all... Even still lunch thing. need bite bullet go virtual foreseeable future. trying tell fox news spews lies 24/7/365 tear America apart divide us hateful lies?

Shocking known today! /s Boy lot people gonna rough time COVID diabetes combo meal. pick side? Long term lung damage, heart damage, kidney damage? pair nicely. thing scares whole situation, many people either: overweight, diabetic, heart disease hypertension. seems like ticket bad time talking protests Florida? experience protests Indiana opposite. Everyone mask, many people brought extras case. People walking around hand sanitizer share. social distancing felt safer sit grocery store. seriously light.

Taiwan 35k fine break quarantine. everything becoming politically driven. People cannot fence filter decisions information anymore. They're either one group other. sides sheep leaders groups. Humanity going backwards America confusion, mainly distrust media government. sides equally blame. everyone eats lunch outside cars.

With heat we‚Äôre Houston right now, getting people would near impossible. originally May 21...

Then, became June 21...

And now, it‚Äôs July 21...

Guess we‚Äôll see goes, don‚Äôt high expectations That‚Äôs I‚Äôm suggesting. 

Really think gap number tests vs positive cases. Compare experience every single country planet.

I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs coincidence also least transparency one enormous outlier what? IFR seasonal flu 0.05% Bad link. maybe already deleted it? This. 10,000 cases means something different testing 12,000 testing 100,000. former case, implication MANY cases don‚Äôt know about. latter case, may capturing huge percentage. straw Han ethnic groups can't talk anything first place. XinJiang? attended Uighur folklore musical opera house staffed uighurs. Also, Uighur languages taught schools, Mandarin. hostile, ass news, 3,000 people diagnosed cancer today none died. guys, cured cancer. Florida cases per capita leave running. Yep, thought thing. quite noble gesture given extreme poverty. told went England tourist slept cow could still donate. even matter many times. England 3 months, donate. Luckily spend time Welsh cows. Karen, get Amazon Fresh. San Diego almost fully open we're starting spike new cases. Drove beach last Sunday going hang bit family, soon got intersection Mission Beach roller coaster saw several hundred people hardly anyone mask. I'm pretty sure they're going start shutting places again. whats photos chest? seems disorienting patient.. downright weird. Unfortunately disagree you. currently hospitalized cases first infected weeks ago. I'd say number people infected since large enough make gap New York, we'll start seeing massive surge deaths coming weeks, regardless steps Florida takes now.

This even accounting fact Florida deliberately hiding true death count classifying pneumonia. surprised however, denying people based passport person holds? I'm banned Europe even though I've living abroad three years morons... undergrads send medical school typically less knowledge infectious disease Bill Gates, pretty well informed non-scientist/physician. F Oh ok. Ifr true death rate though. morons well, TV station like Fox News, attempt manufacture dissent actively attempting divide people. makes easier get majority people reasonable. they? wanted stop say you‚Äôre awesome. Keep good work. Sure glad charge Coronavirus response team. Texas isn‚Äôt even top 10 economies lol. No, know might find hard believe look numbers small part NYC/NY population got virus died it. Still massive infections deaths % wise? still lo people get it. 

If live know, behaviors saved us. states partied shit, state shut fuck super long time. mean 3 days states whined about. 3+ months. still kind going right now. Shit like Orange County explains quite bit surge Golden State. Plandemic made doctors, fair. agree, people listen doctors specifically work researchers patients COVID19. Great! get us sweet sweet mandatory vaccination laws! Sufficiently large studies accurate tests (post-March) probably pretty accurate. idea people show antibodies, however. People mi going. saddle point soon return exponential growth everywhere. take away 414 COVID19 patients ICU would leave ICUs well normal ICU capacity really make sense seeing hospitals shut ppl probably ignoring serious stuff. Also, NYC seeing 5 times normal amount murders month. assume cities are. So, 22 year old gets shot, goes ICU, test positive. positive COVID19 patient ICU. could terribly wrong even Fauci saying ""deaths take several weeks we'll see."" seems sense urgency anyone public. weird. wish dropped ball deathly hard beginning. 

Stay safe,mask up, vote! lot countries dire need tourist money honestly need physically lock infected down. Stamping virus force far important letting people roam freely.

We could avoided lot better leadership. still, scares yall weil fine Yes. rather immigrants contribute bigot idiotic american tourists. Stay fuck away. Given state American education really surprised? talk majority healthcare providers tell want quit. Lots good lives taken. America gg heights probably order 60-70%. Could way worse. see Georgia released health advisories dust cloud? pretend Covid fine. Back one person week getting groceries lockdown garbage rules had. Like getting reported buy cough medicine fever reducing medicine. neighbors report you. nightmare. think we‚Äôre well aware states screwed. That‚Äôs say things China going well all. i'm saying crowded bar good idea right now, going around people way different thing drinking alone couch. try limit one two nights week. yeah... doomscrooling. love term. I‚Äôm confused thought epidemiologist said it‚Äôs ok protest despite virus politicians bad. thought msnbc said too.

Maybe lost credibility say identical behaviors good bad despite politician beliefs. said, ‚Äúif you‚Äôre one care about, guess that‚Äôs American mentality‚Äù insinuating country‚Äôs citizens morally superior attitudes towards less fortunate. 

I donate hard earned money time various causes care about. don‚Äôt need told Reddit ‚Äúfuck you, got mine‚Äù mentality much average European (yes know you‚Äôre European) you‚Äôre 100% aware that‚Äôs feasible right? fear slipping people simply choose live way response would rather people lose jobs Lise life. Vote Republican = VOTE DEATH Try think Reddit like you‚Äôre relatives in-law. love wife‚Äôs family, also know talk lot shit disagree almost everything. Familial culture often influence behavior opinions. Kind like hive mind mentality here.

The difference in-laws Reddit anonymous nature interactions, repercussions say regardless falsehood impact, doesn‚Äôt matter. Likewise, unable qualify users comment basis individual. top comment post could 17 year old watched CNN PhD. enables opinion based fact culture probably guilty myself,Enter hive mind.

Does Trump COVID? many ignore news, especially related virus. 1. rumor '7 confirmed case SARS' traced back group. time experts already knew new virus.
2. Lock make sure virus control. 'Out control' presence strong measures mutually exclusive. Yet everytime mention people say ""ya thats reporting"". Like mention low deaths countries like Japan South Korea. cat better ideas managing crisis current US government. high bar. give two months wish 500,000 deaths.

Add self-selection people seeking (or agreeing to) antibody testing, low numbers people actually tested, quality study becomes suspect basically throw window. places stop seeing increase cases reach testing cap. American living America, please get in? Give days, I'm sure we'll beat Wednesday...

He's built three miles far.

The US Mexico border 1,954 miles. I'd like see transcript.  Articles indirectly partially quoting interviews scientists long history misleading. targeted lockdowns would helpful though. locked nursing homes staff stay on-premises, we'd saved nearly 50% lives right there.

Also, agree way people acting stupid, health experts known better assume people would rational. needed sociologists psychologists take leadership role along side epidemiologists. People rational actors simulation unfortunately. I‚Äôll cake eat too, downvoters Haha. saying travelled have. America, even problems fucking golden goose compared MANY countries. Good argument detective. according Facebook feed still leftist plot oust Fearless Leader??? Serves us right. Nationally, acting like imbeciles. worn mask three weeks ago two minutes also qualifies wearing mask ""some time"". Fuck south

Can confirm. live south. I'm arguing totalitarian government, are. 

You put words mouth, I'll put words yours. Finally. little, late though. Way set example, wearing mask HOSPITAL visited MAYO CLINIC. idiot. seriously call Europe whole shithole?
And American?
lol honestly cannot wait go posts comments history, gonna good. Muh Freedumbs!! Nope. said US one obsessed masks give shit social distancing. Asian countries use social distancing possible, do, use masks. little late... trying belittle so-called ‚Äúself-hating ‚Äòwoke‚Äô redditors‚Äù trying intellectually superior them, would smart verify statements, especially easily verifiable.

While numbers November December 2019 registered NTTO website, draw conclusion based either 2018 numbers and/or using YTD growth (7.6%) 2019 relative 2018 (92.587 million). 

It correct assume almost 100 million outbound travels made U.S citizens U.S 2019 based above-mentioned. However, majority outbound travels made within North America. 2018 numbers 50.812 million 92.587 million total. number U.S citizens traveling Europe around 17.742 million account approximately 19% total travel.

Furthermore, per capita basis, US even close europeans comes international travel. publish it. FYI: Grant money goes straight university. Faculty see none it. claimed two store managers told would okay shop without mask. That's illegal Los Angeles managers would subject termination that.  exactly boat... updated mortality % current cases ranging 5% 11% incrementing 1/2 percent. Yep. keep seeing people without masks now. better lockdown... strangest thing rest country much control. You‚Äôre absolute idiot god. Don‚Äôt talk economics ever again. mean, even nominally third world countries better infrastructure parts flyover country. well, without NASCAR gotta something...  publish it. Everything get back normal relatively! poor go anyway  Well entire family Colombian... so... lol

We‚Äôve lived entire life U.S. coronavirus testing ""strategy"" absurd. Instead carefully testing isolating symptomatic people, say ""go get test"" anyone feels like swab put nose, means capturing thousands asymptomatic infections (i.e. people sick *aren't* experiencing disease) force actual sick patients remain (i.e. experiencing COVID-19 *disease*) wait forever test results. Unfortunately, makes U.S. epidemic look worse actually is, insane numbers -- thousands thousands ""infected"" Floridians sick likely never become sick.

Say me: *infection* novel coronavirus guarantee one experience COVID-19 *disease*. old job admins got super helping people quit smoking documenting patient mandatory question smoking history you‚Äôd get dinged didn‚Äôt answer it. Problem worked young children questions like ‚Äúhave ever use tobacco products‚Äù. stopped asking answered no, toddler use chewing tobacco. That's lot Italian food. champ lady is. like, half fucking country pissed at, basically. must put Ten Commandments courtrooms. /sarcasm Ever Rick Steves? imagine thinking trump trying let corona cause much devastation possible ""savior"" American happy cake day Good. place smells like fish anyway Paid CCP.

Just get CIA bots do. time now, almost  parents major Fox Newsers. able convince mom it‚Äôs real danger wears mask dad thinks lot data false many people actually died/gotten seriously ill COVID. Distance education triage bs last semester same. Half country know Puerto Rico US Territory. way mother would leave USA different country sadly. tried around 2010 graduated high school able get passport. fuck vacations Florida summer? want ppe, ventilators gloves ignored them.

Yes no. Truth hesitated making utmost priority gate January, items simply available medical staff started ask them. 

It would great could gotten least one large order PPE India put blanket ban export early February, colossal level fuck administration immediately retail America stop sale respirators pull shelves stockpile. Instead bought truckload Chinese-Americans shipped country first weeks February. know witnessed first hand tried collect respirators mom friends (all nurses) emergency situation. 

The second India banned export knew bad, nation basically fucked, one time China India aren‚Äôt going care dollars it‚Äôs matter life death people. 

You would imagine leaders jumped right issue India put blanket ban, would wrong. another three full weeks Trump even seemed notice. That‚Äôs day, late February, panicked surgeon general sent tweet demanding Americans buy respirators, ‚Äúthey won‚Äôt anything you‚Äîonly medical people!‚Äù [paraphrasing here]. masks/respirators long gone, majority bought export country China. 

The next day federal agents raided warehouses large suppliers like 3m, managing find one noteably-sized pallet. goes show manpower available could easily done month earlier‚Äîand process actually able seize millions masks instead thousand.Unfortunately us, one administration seems capable critical thought‚Äîeven par something seemingly simply creating pandemic preparedness checklist going line. ‚ÄúDo masks‚Äù question middle January, late February. 

So right say Trump ignores asking PPE, ignores forced administrations ineptitude. Amazing someone never China boasts know China Chinese.
I claim know West Westerner anyway. lol Ya fucked here. live really popular northwest mountain area people flooding place masks social distancing etc. gonna stuck mess long long time... apparently many people country zero self control. live M√©xico although horrible US look, yeah great response either There‚Äôd better guidance administration guided Discord Little Pony.

I think much politics dictatorship.

I also know Sweden maintained open voluntary social quarantine coronavirus pandemic, banned gatherings 50 people, stopped Visiting nursing home (and I'm trying accuse anyone anything) surprising. Medical staff taking huge risks treat patients hospital, potentially sick patients living freely outside hospital. actually wonder average Swede approves Swedish government health authorities doing, unbelievable Chinese. so, elaborate that? There's always big difference what's media what's factual. stress. [Visas processed ""wherever you‚Äôre travelling from"" starting July young American held rally Tulsa? Oh wait... I‚Äôm done. would cluster infections 100% mask usage. post post people listen doctors. absolutely nothing even protests. grasping straws trying argue circles. Direct result failure highest levels..

No plan, real guileless states, little way programs assist states testing contract tracing..

States pretty much left own. Stop turning scientists policy. know saying attack said.

It really grinds gears ""we"" this, done many us. Millions us wearing masks, physically distancing, staying away large gatherings, listening experts. Oh good, they'll lock right metastasizes even Sensory processing disorder? Claustrophobia induced anxiety? ass Trump favorite.  yelling brick wall.

The people go politicians COVID-19 news people listen scientists/doctors begin with. like went Mayo Clinic wear mask like asked ? Trumpdemic blame Europe, I‚Äôm guessing anti-maskers aren‚Äôt traveling-to-Europe types anyway. mostly penalize actually taking virus seriously. ""MAGA"" Source?  reports 512 deaths yesterday.... usually get 15-20,000 steps per shift.

Good shoes? That's lot steps every day guidance? top two ways prevent disease think pro-diseaser.  Damn, big driveway would take three hours? believe one good. However, know others believe do, wear one make others around comfortable... kinda like wearing pants. could also create manufacturing plants health equipment instead relying China. Montgomery County, MD still largely masks. many children parents, they're masks. U r asking kids wear masks?

I energy Trump listened Fauci Go city hospital Yea lmao cause cluster infections South Canadian, think they‚Äôll let even though passport says I‚Äôm America? No, France already announced start processing visas students, including Americans, July 1. ban predominantly tourism. Regardless people do, remember sheriff back election.

However, regard regulations right now, cops around managing crowds lines like normal summer weekend. Good. Luck.

Wear mask. Lies I've road trip people barely wearing masks stop. fucking mind blowing. Hashtag coronaenvy Thats case everywhere cases rising everyday Yeah. quite unthinkable lockdown months, least one time. Obviously forced (which also happened countries Italy) it, physically mentally would demanding.

As say lockdowns aren't- probably get - bad Wuhan/Hubei, applying strict lockdown even small number confirmed cases, feel could happen again. due feeling (granted, idea it) virus less acts like sort guerrillaesque sleeper cell lockdowns due traits, spreading radar, ""wake up"" start spreading rapidly lockdown done with.

It's hard, maybe even impossible, situation handle. That's view it. People across world probably going refuse vaccine, Americans exception, guess they‚Äôll need relative friend develop mild worse form covid-19 convinced.

Have seen numbers lately? Europe masks mandatory social distancing possible, seing numbers infected dead drop. US, focus masks, numbers dropping.
And read scientific studies. study showing masks effective social distancing. people outside US, make sense Ah yes awhile since I've heard people screaming ""the real numbers.""

Glad hear better! mate. critical fox news. honestly turned whole idea leaning right..fuck shit friend works hospital Houston going told Houston would never reach peak need save economy. way people believed things fine numbers shot crazy.

They're ~1965-1980 (i.e. 40-55 years old) plotted mid-40's. many 35 died? really gets bad, suspect people like friend find wall end.

And rightly so. I'm fan vigilantism, told elderly parents I'd sooner shoot let covid-denying, uncaring asses home, imagine I'd go someone knew infected family.

We're far civil war, pandemic may well push Americans edge. happens, there's whole tribe morons find children neighbors gunning them. Yes would! outdoors plus wearing mask much safer outdoors.

Pure science. from? Went NYC Sept 2018 wedding anniversary. Awesome trip. Make sure check Ride. press done shit awful job covering pandemic virus part reason much misinformation spread.

They make arbiters right wrong instead reporting. 

For example, major news media reported China forcing minority women take birth control order breed existence.

The actual news China's 2 child policy applies everyone, press made value judgement news made judge reporting on, pushed activist narrative.

On covid-19, press downplaying pandemic, trying influence dealt with. actively choose political parties align with.

Right now, Western press political party self- interests. changes, governments continue block them. Damn. wasy letting anti vaxxers kill off. guess way forward criminalizing corona vaccine evasion Coronavirus coronavirus, HIV HIV.

The point is, RNA viruses, make claim covid slower mutation rate RNA viruses makes point mute considering absolutely virulent virus easily spreads.

A Covid vaccine happening, anytime soon. peddling delusional thinking, ignoring reality infront saying ""all going get better"" without scientific backing, isn't. 

We going able make vaccine virus we've never experience making vaccine time frame ridiculous year, timeframe never made vaccine in. may well pull bible tell God cure them.

Or say virus ""magically"" disappear like Trump. fucking hell, y‚Äôall afraid virus shit? mean know virus real all, like least country deaths labeled covid deaths people died things. expect believe shit don‚Äôt know anyone virus died it? wear masks? NO. get virus? NO. place people said it‚Äôs high risk?

From I've learned contract tracing class, one contagious 2 days symptoms appear, 10-14 days symptoms present go away. Essentially, yes. Vaccines fully stop infections. pretty much always dosage virions still productively infect you, although high depends virus.

Think like arming military. works well enough unorganized militias, shit full-scale alien invasion.

The goal vaccines reduce r0 1. Currently, somewhere 2 2.5, meaning infected person infects 2-2.5 people average. vaccine 75% effective, would mean would able infect .5-.6 people, meaning generation virus would far fewer infections last. super sweet mean supporters?

It really like that.

Good intent bad outcome situation. assumption would depends low starting point is. current infected cases UK higher Netherlands bound pick see exponential growth easier say countries low case counts.

Yeah live ny family adult one year. Never again.

Maybe third wave realize best thing could done economy full lock down, full measures taken right get go. Get control quickly, reopen economy much much sooner. know, like world now. 

Not 'Murica though, cause mostly right wing folks ""tyranny"" lockdowns wearing mask making effort whatsoever. Enjoy deliberately misinterpreting words?

Thus appears designed exert political leverage slow deliberations regarding next stimulus.

Seems stand-alone stopgap bill designed similar effect, also designed actually pass, would mortgage forbearance written well. way people hook banks holding mortgage, landlords. banks would pissed course, could perhaps direct energy making sure comprehensive stimulus bill gets passed quickly money start flowing again. right going get downvotes anyway.

These estimates, virus seen affect older people far younger people. know herd immunity - acquired catching disease rather vaccinations - would likely occur without also causing lot older people infected, therefore lot dying.

Even mortality rate quite high 8% old people, still seems affect (and others show symptoms) badly.

Can West really elect leader Trump's caliber electoral policies functioning properly?
What's amazing Americans think election policy unparalleled unassailable, one political responsibility touch election. system cold hair ground, system seen old irreparable.
In China, taught children American two-party system elections, one party elected, party exit dignity, party power also Evaluate policies put interests people first.
Now? Even post-election political reckoning come out. Hi 4mo old China propaganda account! Another example journalist spitballing instead asking epidemiologist. 

The low rate testing means get tested already flagged likely virus. artificially inflates percent tests positive. 

A low rate testing may artificially deflate apparent death rate, since may deaths due disease counted.

A low rate testing means sickest people tested therefore counted disease. deflate apparent recovery rate. Northeastern states can't afford to. Well, ""to"", one thing, dumbass.

c) technocracy might sound nice realise specialists scientists aren3angels. wrong (matter fact: scientific method teaches anything wrong time.), corrupt (like tobacco companies), personal interests lie (like anyone else) Truth told: purely technocratic system nothing aligns incentive structure governing body interests citizens.
d) politicians figure heads. actual influence day day operations government minuscule. people power manage stay positions longer election cycle: bureaucrats specialists. true government.

Oxford group expand Brazil since COVID-19 cases plummeting political posts allowed sub like rules state? said evidence. can't cite one study dealt 200mg doses HCQ early indication infection. find extremely high dose studies oh studies slamming HCQ later withdrawn erroneous. Fox News government-appointed censor. way irresponsible. think used prevent meat packing plants open pretty much waived around instead anything it. arrivals go government mandated 2 week hotel quarantine. However, breaches (hotel staff/security catching virus bringing home family), we‚Äôre trying get top it!! entirely Governor's fault.

If interested what's happening Texas, would strongly recommend Daily Podcast [A Dilemma Except ""impartial"" judge literally last month quit accused bolsonaro trying meddle investigations sons. Provided proof congressmen close bolsonaro trying persuade promises chair supreme court even forced cabinet meeting video released bolsonaro literally states change whoever wants family gets ""fucked"" investigations. yeah. ""impartial"" judge really sale lol

This judge opposite opinion piece/interview suggests. Lol 

And media CNN brasil, Globo, estado de sao paulo, etc running front page articles nonstop government. Directly accusing him, sons former lawyer, sons former aid money laundering without consequence. estado de sao paulo went way supreme court bolsonaro reveal corona virus exam ended doing. 

He might personally press often tell supporters simply read news lol actual action taken freedom press.

He protodictator mouth bollocks. government hangs thread. picture perfectly captures Texas‚Äô strategy coronavirus Looks normal It‚Äôs actually ignorant think people support/ed bumbling idiots. case? doubt would able achieve much destruction. Plenty well educated evil people supported continue support him. go up? Small town west TN here: 30% mask usage estimate too. Finally killed drat cockroach car. bites mum. Downside need clean car üôÉ insect killer used catch gang.


Also urgh, hate dust allergy. Hopefully doesnt blow round . Really dont get people free COPD sinus issues yet yelling put masks. Yeah, think people lie (which big if) thinking 1 time maybe 5% time actually wear mask. glad finally required indoors washington. I‚Äôm hoping rethink idea August. problem parents want kids 5 days week way reduce capacity would x amount kids M,W x Tu, Th - something like that. get addicted heroin needle phobia dissappear one fine day like mircale /s states reporting recoveries accurately math going work live two blocks Prospect Park. seem like lot younger ‚ÄúCOVID roomies‚Äù breaking guidelines hanging masks around necks, maybe they‚Äôre outdoors transmitting much. It‚Äôs possible wearing masks park path security theater, you‚Äôre never really close enough infected people long enough matter. never take mine outside, it‚Äôs clearly important wear indoors. try bunch things like head size shape didn‚Äôt work. found kid sized single use ones pharmacy worked great. (They much lighter cloth elastics softer works. I‚Äôm ashamed sewing custom ones didn‚Äôt work better honestly.) happened near live meat factory. think ended spreading 1000 people week so. Yeah. I'm Chan month ago would say 80% wearing masks. 50/50 now. Hell, Home Depot like 10% BLM protests. fucking tunnel-visioned insects. looking nationwide numbers. Looking graph, surge began around 6/18. visibility Texas's death / hospitalization data hand.

So 11 days ago nationwide daily cases 26,239. Today 40,498.

In county live in, first inkling surge June 17, cases double per day (was 150 per day, today 497). Also positive test rate went 3 percent 6 percent (average 5%). surge real increase. Testing level.

Cases city went 1 - 4 per day 17 today alone. since 6/17.  80% lying Agreed. middle ground collectivism forced collectivism. ""lockdown"". Nothing would described ""lockdown"" virus. like definition changed overnight. shutdown bars stuff told people work home. Nobody outside jail prison ever ""lockdown"". gotten innocent people jail/prison right? already done good world president really see leading super spreader events peoples homes neighborhoods.

But go Florida! productive! world still eagerly waiting US implement first lockdown. There's multitude factors. gatherings equally infectious. Outdoors airflow massively decreases infection rates well widespread mask usage. Mike pence refusing wear mask time says something like this, know situation beyond emergency now. followed debate whether mandatory masks students. lost interest realized even mandatory masks, sending kid school.

I think worth arguing masks schools - least lower grades. little guy rising first grader. Would trust class full first graders keep masks even mandatory? would not. kind assume masks going come time time. kind wood/metalworking home improvement that's going produce lot dust want breathing fine, care cases breathing out, great partly trying avoid spreading something may breathing out. Nelson Mandela said that, sort Probably tbh lol. NYC family says almost everyone wearing masks stores Uyghur Muslims. Mosques mean shit. China also 'Churches' mean recognized Roman Catholic China allow exist: ""Chinese age 18 permitted join officially sanctioned Christian groups registered government-approved Protestant Three-Self Church China Christian Council Chinese Patriotic Catholic Church.""

You pass government approval register religion. used 'boys boys' excuse... real life? matter could read it, even would read it. never even find exists. problem. LOL isn‚Äôt works. make outrageous claim it‚Äôs provide source. Otherwise anonymous troll spreading fake news Reddit. doubt said false every media outlet would reporting this.

Edit: wait, covid died? died covid? Even can‚Äôt seem keep story straight. think we‚Äôre done here. think beaches probably ok....if shoulder shoulder like spring break. Depending live. Ask local hospital health department Far man since protestors wearing masks, assume know whats going Maybe never it‚Äôs really slow, think it‚Äôs busy? something looks fairly accurate give comparison different times year interested. One thing right - it‚Äôs miserably hot US surgeon General told people wear masks.... thought stopped making them? Today hypersonic missiles  like informed get information sides. Ironically young party goers may get favoritism ICU.  someone make clip shorter states wear mask it‚Äôs portable/viral post social media. needs heard loudly clearly. actually enforce it? healthcare doctors said stay home, we‚Äôre seen advocating involved protests? Lol yea wonders credibility. Texas really try lock announced opening back up. Trump's drum beat messaging virus big deal, would magically disappear, fake news, plot libs, aquarium chemicals medicine, etc., Americans refuting virologists doctors. take everything says total lie. base takes everything says gospel. depressing think much earlier could've squashed people stopped think fellow human instead selfish? 

I liked quarantine, personally. felt lot safer kicked Netflix Switch action day.  hope does. anyone wondering blue MAGA looks like, it. Renewable energy, community food gardens, new, safe nuclear power plants... 3 work all; fact, would backfire *spectacularly*. Why? little-known congressional act called ""Continuity Government Act"" basically states that, event catastrophic failure electoral system (such election suspended without end due unforeseen event), next person line presidential succession would automatically assume presidency January 20th noon. Also, Vice President's term ends 20th noon, automatically excluded assuming control.

That means next available person *Speaker House Nancy Pelosi*. Oops. doubt realizes that. don‚Äôt trust China anything. lied whole time still are. Herd immunity, obviously. They‚Äôve already said continue even got positive tests Fuck you, got mine

Got anything say [this Little, Late. Oh. frack going bar? mean, sit mask face, 6 feet away closest person? Where's fun that? minority cases. People stop fear mongering. serious enough without dramatics. month old dude Go Bills Lol Reddit I'm still skeptical happen though. take one player testing positive whole thing get shut like Rudy Gobert tested positive March. responses, truest religion lol? Falungong?

China 40000 mosques.

They entire streets shops run muslims. Maybe propaganda video. ""their propaganda documentary"" who's their? Beyond? That's documentary, film talked eating whole foods plant based, something Beyond considered be. Also read ingredients nutritional profile know healthy consider rather ambiguously skeptical.

Look out. Big Broccoli coming ü•¶üî™ shit? Yeah, agree more. damn shame. One best things India affordable healthcare system. CA now, hard get anything OTC medicines damn expensive. IBS couple immunity issues meds (Allegra, Flonase, IBGard, Psylium Husk etc.) cost well 150$ per month, that's buy cheapest sources Costco/Walmart/Amazon those. India, used 10$ available 3 med shops less 100 ft apartment price. i'm sure would change mind tbh really like idea. keep actors staff working. Occassionally live show air local channels. dont see Absolutely. That's assault. seem unaware, eggs4meplease, bulk society agree ""Human life price!""

The bulk society say ""Human life priceless saved cost!"" alternatively, make wearing mask temporary law, quick, easy, cheap way it. People central eastern Europe hated mandated masks much Texan, follow law regardless, want pay fines thrown security. Honestly matter time. shocked ripped retirement communities already. never Florids - absolutely riddled retirement communities snowbirds. really option though? know reason cost living low areas directly correlated fact actually jobs available outside scattered retail? Tons people would moving country could reasonably make living there. really can't, there's career path majority places suggesting people move to. referring owning stock gambling ignorant.

They're coughing children they're coughing employees others Karen's get want. Wait till health insurers employers require it, change tunes. profit medicine end.

If ever needed proof drug companies cartoon caricatures stereotypical drug dealers go. related sidenote: Capital/money extremely harmful, virulent meme, changemymind.jpg Forgive me. judged company keep. r/Coronavirus all... Good point. Pence political snake. visions President. live Indiana almost destroyed state's economy (his RFRA debacle, anyone interested) suck religious right. I'm sure feels Trump sinking ship he'll one first rats jump. kidding, even bother 20mil infected, 80% even know it.

The phase tracing months ago, failure. depends someone's color. someone black, shoot her/him, even think he/she might cough you. standing ground feared life. Otherwise, must show restraint. mine open would go. time slot method certain block pre-book exercise good middle ground. That‚Äôs thinking, too. NJ, teleworking since march, got email saying going go back office starting July 17th... write internal documents, meetings people states. happy. correct, best estimates .5%-1%. 

still hell lot people, that's including people hospitalized survived and/or long-term damage. still really, really bad. Bit cruel there?

Coronavirus care feelings. Maybe good came made people knew real.

Yes exactly! Like said, feel good story. spending hour sharing air bunch people breathing heavily expelling tons respiratory droplets grocery store. Also can't really wear mask gym. seems lot vocal virus multi-billionaire American business magnates. manufacture cost this? charging 3K drug costs 10 dollars make... problem here. drug shold 3000% markup. Period.  Speaking distribution I'm actually interested countries would release data many people vaccinated per day comes out. It'll interesting data see fast slow world would vaccinated.. fast current testing worldwide....
:/ fucked since currently 200 mil people tested worldwide need filtering indoor air, run UV light returning buildings. UV light recently proven kill virus among several virus bacteria. days? mean every day necessary mandate. DeSantis Trump set better example, current anti-maskers (almost exclusively far right people) would board we'd really high compliance without mandates. third-world random price fixing european perspective, happens Morocco(North Africa) private clinic (I there).The cost coronavirus PCR test 60 $ France covered 100% Health Insurance. US tourist health insurance would paid 60 bucks here. years ago, met student France Texas told suprise pay full price without health insurance less would paid USA insurance. Based writing, get impression sophisticated understanding subject.

Same, friend. talking ass, making incorrect statements, all, simply refuse address base concern market prices stopped pegged fundamentals. market philosophy tautology-- people paid money stock, therefore value. moved parents losing job 26 years old ""for year"". 31 put 50% house managable morgage. sex life suffered 2 3 girls dated 5 year period also lived parents still regrets. many people time spend months, endless phone calls, waiting hold hours get bill negotiated? 

Imagine working full-time open office major city way make private phone call. can't even call outside street noise cars loud. mention discussing private health financial information within ear shot strangers street, office coworkers boss hear.

It's ridiculous expect people go hoops get cost lowered, ultimately still going pay 10-100x people first world countries pay. 

And process I've personally go time time insurance! NYC think better preparaed now. worth it. see, earn respect order offend me. Pretty sure UW mill. Also pretty sure uneducated. Good luck there. need it. Omg..

Yep, read whole actually quite sad.

No sad ""The Emperors new cloths"" parable. That's optimistic, I'm betting next summer. big participant group need? big group, acceptable, FDA agrees already approved Remdesivir treatment covid-19.  really asking good things happening difficult time gives humans hope?

They weren‚Äôt highly contagious either. world split two halves - countries deal it, can't screwed.

i wonder 3 parts. two also deal screwed anyway circumstances beyond control Well, honest... one could forseen pandemic like one. Sure, doctors saying ""We going pandemic sooner later!"" saying 50 years were... honestly brushed Chicken Little's. Herd immunity estimated achieved 70% population immune SARS-CoV-2. depends R0 pathogen trying achieve immunity for. agree you.

I bought hair cutting kit Wal Mart back taking things hands. absolutely is!

However, 3 dead bodies 15 sick people, 10 tests, test? 

You bury dead test sickest 10 people. bad enough watching NY hospitals reach capacity seeing tragedy came after. know little equipment/time prepare, really prepared then? now, situation happening multiple states once, long think we‚Äôll last everything collapses? don‚Äôt see realistically handle surges many states without real federal help it‚Äôs clear fed still focused profiting this, rather helping states prepare.

It also pittance compared corporate give aways approved time. Truth need test act early.

We needed hundreds test acted day 1, need billions test since acting like morons. It‚Äôd total no-brainer haha it‚Äôs literally empty there‚Äôs bed furniture elect them. need elect someone listens Eye storm refers quiet spot middle hurricane.

Whenever get circular wind pattern like hurricane typhoon middle spot there's rain wind blowing hard. Sometimes people think means isn't. probably works then. make policy covid treatment given refuse vaccine. Considering access nuclear launch codes reality actual shooting war could end badly (putting lightly). Hes exactly known restraint pressure... weird pretend pandemic isnt deeply political.

In many places, isn't. Where's mentioned? Phase three trials going separately. vaccine appears approved military use. means high confidence efficacy vaccine. Exactly!! purpose quarantines lockdowns ""stop virus"", protect vulnerable groups (in terms health conditions elderly) ensure healthcare system handle number patients admitted.

Look happened Italy, doctors literally choose give ventilation to. choosing could live could die. purpose quarantine/lockdowns prevent happening. Naw upset mate? Every day two check south carolina covid-19 testing trends also webcam riptydz Myrtle Beach -  \- like alternate universe seeing packed bar zero masks customers staff R around 1.2 month... nearly exponential growth still consequences takes 2 weeks double rather days; come slowly enough notice, guess? never look extinction events ever floats boat. time amount. kill progenitor certain strain gone one generation offspring. kill 2 generations reduce number gene want eradicate low number procreation pressure high basically eradicated generations later yield (dominant) super significant advantage competitors.

It took one thing: visit archangel Gabriel. Pence reasonable man, God sends message, abide.


Here's went:

Flash light, Gabriel appears glory.

Gabriel ""you pregnant son God"".

Pence: ""???""


Gabriel: ""sorry, wrong script... TELL WEAR MASKS!""


And are... 401(k) crashed 25% lost good job job pays half much. ‚ÄúPainful‚Äù understatement day. raking ""floor"" forest exact also ask ""how many times wrong?"" Australia, watching US rest world...hoping better decisions made soon give hope situation. thankful everyday mostly control (at ment least) want everyone else around world. Nope. approved military use, trial. unavailable commercial use must logistical reasons. No, brothers boyfriend assumed brother asymptomatic, got back tibody test, negative. boyfriend positive. Obvious guess Don‚Äôt know comment downvoted. Makes perfect sense me, people weird. They‚Äôve lying can‚Äôt trust people anymore, there‚Äôs vaccine I‚Äôm taking especially go safety process.  Cases people meet criteria disease, infections people infected. example one may infected SARS-COV-2 developed COVID-19. case total case count COVID-19 possible people without symptoms counted, e.g. PCR serological tests positive, people symptoms (which would qualify case) never tested. often case better estimates CFR iFR IFR determined fact. Bothe IFR CFR disease affected treatment, example many people HIV never develop disease AIDS due treatments keep viral load extremely low see literally talking removing people houses quarantine couldnt effectively send elders assisted living soon they're mild fucking burden.

Or single mom cant take care father dementia. No, partially right ALOT info coming China, US, UK, Italy France Germany list goes mental issues surviving corona even people asymptomatic developing lung complaints mental issues. ability people dismiss scientific studies ridiculous. Oh, experts think this, ok, I'll ignore everyone says thing. Sorry, really taking toll, mean rant. say black people? then. Simple US ones capable carrying research? There's plenty places Earth. dude, world divided ""vaxxers antivaxxers"". wish people would stop treating everything like fucking teams sport. like either completely one ""side"" would drink herbal tea rather measles shot, completely ""side"" would inject gasoline someone lab coat gave you. sides, think head head internet community, /r/vaxxhappened antivax facebook group.

I think concerned vaccine pushed what's normally 10 years process 1 year perfectly legitimate would insane concerned. Sure, concern might soothed later, *not* concerned? people can't pull heads asses let alone pay attention countries. Anyone doubts number come see hospitals. full COVID19 patients. spare ICU beds. Maybe countries learn us.  Egypt yet peak. don‚Äôt test. Look number deaths per day notice rising. Look things turned out. It‚Äôs pretty bad. Sounds like poisoning Yea poll stats something trust I'm looking accuracy. Especially U.S. lol alcohol also detrimental immune system? old wives tale?  Look, idea fun isn‚Äôt everyone‚Äôs idea fun. One cannot dictate fun another human. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs convenience distance learning making people seek homeschool options.

I think lot parents acknowledging they‚Äôre basically going homeschooling part time near full time anyways next year given lot schools won‚Äôt able fully reopen younger kids need lot person supervision even distance learning.

So that‚Äôs case-why find program that‚Äôs well tailored tested homeschooling rather school districts/public school teachers come afternoon zoom in-service online learning?

But doubt it‚Äôll convenient parents. Many families probably looking spouse quitting job make happen. Pretty sure every vaccine diseases like trials across world order get approval specifically differences genetical make affect vaccine works. ""They need sued existence""


But Fox viewer/believer far stupid follow lawsuit. commentator confidently tell lost cause put heads forget everything. ones think they're smart sue they're counting loyalty investment get somewhere life. lawsuit would get blacklisted. Washington never got 20k tests per week, sure you‚Äôd claim Fuck you. Deactivate bot now!  get news comedians mostly. 100% Don‚Äôt think need wait 5 weeks Kudos New York taking steps combat this, unlike many parts US per capita basis, arizona worst world far ?!?

He's got vote long runs ballet lifetime. wrote op-ed wsj weeks ago amazing gov's response this?!? lol obviously people mostly go pharmacies they‚Äôre sick.

My brother lucky enough catch coronavirus back February, people, started sending store stock stuff (he immune system, he's rightfully paranoid).

Anyway, whatever point everyone else buying bleach, toilet paper hand sanitizer, sent pharmacy absolutely *massive* list. everything thought either us could possibly need pharmacy next six months: toothpaste, deodorant, cough drops, allergy medicine, Q-tips, bandaids, multi-vitamins, Gatorade, Ensure, pulse oximeter, etc, etc -- anything everything cough cough, allergy, health hygiene, first aid-related could think might possibly need, either everyday life deal covid.

It like $270, might ever need stuff -- hopefully ever need it! thinking that, needed it, need stressed trying find ended shortage. also worry hanging store bunch sick people, considering benefits different types cold syrups, *and* worry decontaminating everything brought home.

The longer thing goes on, grateful brother forward thinking, ever enter cough-and-cold aisle rest year. Y‚Äôall die home VIP 1Million dollar treatment hospital.  Oh definitely know bad habit. It‚Äôs reveling one mans death deters millions death.

The feel good comes person Fox News watchers can‚Äôt relate make question previous ignorance. Damn. bet break maternal sewist's heart! thinking trying again, pharmacy gets different brand next time styles like two strings come together ends apart middle sit around crown head. Personally use ponytail anchor masks! lot non-billionaires non-millionaires know too. realize California 5th largest economy world right? prop many social services reach many states, Undoubtedly kill state economy.

People government realizing trying get things open..it didn‚Äôt end panning well can‚Äôt blame it. Things get much worse US economy California tanks pandemic..don‚Äôt believe me, watch.. step 3 mean everyone dead? /s Sorry hear that. That‚Äôs horrible lied masks effective keep people hoarding them. intentions may noble, effect sow distrust cause message turbulence reversed course tried get people switch homemade masks. 

While saying wear masks, Hong Kong *screaming* anyone would listen wear mask, improvise face shield, *anything* better naked face. info available, thought better lie get people right thing. accomplished nothing - dumb enough fall hoarded PPE anyways, ones *were* dumb refuse believe new message. Lose/lose. #winning Hmm seems like 7% people live Oklahoma  matter people get don‚Äôt die? Isn‚Äôt whole concern spreading many deaths? guy idiot.. suspect time day plays role well. Aerosoled virus lingers around 6 minutes direct sunlight summer. sunlight lingers around 125 minutes. Cloudy days between. would guess factors wind humidity. lot play. illegal alien invasion Canada Mexico. Sounds like gram gram needs put home forgotten about. possibility don‚Äôt discover vaccine? 

Someone brought thought random conversation day wondering that‚Äôs real possibility. so, would long term plan dealing covid without vaccine? You‚Äôd think that‚Äôd brainer. much waited. They're lying. less 50% around Texas probably surpass NY soon.. thoughts death rate react this? hope stays low sake humanity I‚Äôm worried death rate climb correlation within next month thing stopping would sap power power return people. Power corrupts. good flush away old politicians every term two Don‚Äôt go nbc either go published studies anything like school district spend money district-level supervising employees going meeting Bahamas.... new Lexus superintendent 29% Fairfax county kids qualify free reduced lunch. Yes it‚Äôs rich county still poor working poor. saying send kids back school force teachers work (which also proposed plan), inaccurate dismiss Fairfax county students many come wealth families. 14 cases? 14k cases? Nobody trust China. Beijing overrun virus moment! Ahhh fuck dude. know it‚Äôs old people throwing tantrums masks. government business. designed turn profit. sigh. Safest way think keep testing regular updates.

Yes, important get data compare, epidemiology models even match reality.

But again, Swedish science understood covid19 spreads like flu cannot contained, also thought testing pointless. initial understanding nature covid19 said testing pointless, also missed chance get data would challenged initial understanding. Correct, *not* South American, I‚Äôm Dominican.

I fuck politics though, haven‚Äôt read enough, know superficially correlate DR‚Äôs leftist revolutionary movement.

Any reason someone would dislike them? really loaded question, I‚Äôd honestly like know He's suffering Monte Carlo fallacy right now. He's said big deal long changing pattern would suggest maybe wrong. doubles down. Presidents Men great movie, politicians smart Jaws realistic.

Also Night Living Dead people spend time arguing instead getting organized fighting zombies.

I watch Idiocracy. thought largest conspiracy ever orchestrated global scale discredit Trump. easy right? work states actually took seriously.

The tristate area couple dozen new infections per day per state deaths single digits.

Pay attention, sport. denied state assistance 2+ years punishment. far Florida.. Fuck. know ask permission that... they're already it... anybody claiming doctor scientist someone clearly resume experience role.

It's like people take Doctor Phil seriously can't attack fox news way supportive current wave protests. attack fox news want, going support outlets encouraging defending protest time, enormous hypocrite. There's also festering paranoia everyone ulterior motive. Millions people literally believe epidemiologists doctors get control them. strange way, Covid crisis exacerbated mental health crisis.  stop going politicians

Norway opening means hospital free beds. ¬´common holiday¬ª soon people usually heading smaller towns smaller healthcare wilI interesting see new wave approaches. believe people start slack vacation time many new cases. 

The key probably majority listened government. open even said something like ¬´we dont know right approach try adjust time¬ª. Yes. We've 1k 20 days. demographic getting sick right extremely low IFR still permanent lung damage hospitals filling up. Hopefully see spike. Fingers crossed. Wear masküíö That's make masks mandatory places like supermarkets want positive impact lockdown. asking people please wear work. Far many people still think Covid-19 joke Guinea pigs food, people Guinea pigs...yup...zombie outbreak time. Think city itself. telling 49 states people eating faces fights? unpopular truth wrong. point wear one? Likely answer; never. crazy nowadays people use brain all. seriously think CCP even ask overseas chinese buy ppe?

If country outbreak family friends back home short masks another country masks plentiful gonna nothing?

Around time Wuhan locked many people Singapore buying masks send Wuhan. Many chinese many Singaporeans too. Even celebrities publicity.

To even believe buying resell markup even ridiculous. think free ship ppe country China? deducting cost shipping much mark worthwhile?

China spend $100 billion building entire cities Malaysia lulz. even worth time think flipping ppe. Month it‚Äôll continue going unless lock again... really bad couple months continue nothing Arrest assault. went golfing Lindsey Graham. -- won‚Äôt change minds people opposed masks. need mandate. school posted assignments every Monday morning assignments weren‚Äôt due following Sunday lots leeway. didn‚Äôt even grade lot assignments grades due give students time complete them. Grades Pass/Incomplete assignments completed grades changed January next year. might want check district‚Äôs policies. Sure long take classes  Another Kentuckian here. agree. way soon. Beshear great, imagine he‚Äôs faced lot pressure continue reopening plans. He‚Äôs great encouraging masks public, everywhere go (ie, grocery), see less less masks time before. People tired they‚Äôre sick masks, going make whole thing worse long run. want indirectly enjoy life times Alex Jones, would recommend Knowledge Fight podcast two dudes go analyze Alex Jones clips. usually pretty entertaining. live Canada wouldn‚Äôt occur might charge test. Besides universal health insurance, tests public interest. barrier testing. It‚Äôs crazy. Finding job damn near impossible. Also. full time job that‚Äôs ‚Äúguaranteed‚Äù 40 hours week $12 hour joke ""Detected cases"" ""Cases"" two different things. levels testing early awful. real cases numbers needed get levels deaths charts. 

I certainly concern US border states experiencing surge, anything like happened already NE. NE lock downs came late actually effective.

But helps sleep night.

I guess agree disagree. Ok well, went restaurant weeks ago found employee test positive. go store every week, pretty sure they‚Äôve customers and/or employees affected well. mean, guess it‚Äôs right thing tell businesses you‚Äôve test positive, point become living fear?! 
I‚Äôve going gym treadmills. Every one blocked distancing. least 20 treadmills first row itself, walk way end away anyone. guess what? People still come way jump next available treadmill. don‚Äôt get it!!! I‚Äôm ready make sign says Stay hell away me! Nobody said that. said people even realize minor. You‚Äôre dreamland think bars barbers main reason spread. Really sorry struggling. seems like matter us fall line millennials rough time general. hope future things start looking up.  wish people thought like you. I'm sorry hear grandma, probably jumped car. Chiropractic nothing cheap way get degree.

But usually branch one 2 directions: science (massage, phys.therapy, etc) pseudoscience (reiki, ear candling, anti-vaxx, etc). Wall posters often tell way lean. *Chiropractic* part bullshit either way.

Or go directly masseur, physical therapist, etc. know get, probably cheaper. might even get happy ending $$$ more. I'm going see management first protection employee. Weekend report tends dip Sunday, gets reported Monday. that, far see. However, lowest Sunday total months. #Heros Wear Masks mask wearing must big part it. here, don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen single person inside store without mask, although people aren‚Äôt wearing outside unless I‚Äôm crowd I‚Äôve seen. also nervous indoor dining. don‚Äôt see done safely can‚Äôt wear mask eating. I‚Äôm hoping restaurants best keep doors windows open get airflow absolutely mind blowing considering we‚Äôre re-opening across US now... Holy....shit. Please please please stop. 

I also love you‚Äôre getting upvoted despite insanely incorrect information. 

This level walking behind someone street‚Äôs ‚Äúslipstream‚Äù everyone obsessed months ago. 

Dispersion air movement good! One single virus isn‚Äôt getting anyone sick. need get hit enough innate immune system can‚Äôt fight off. fan adds air disperse dilute virus. 

I still think gyms bad idea open it‚Äôs kind fan spreading virus around that‚Äôs going it. anyone know get orange masks like that? looks amazing mean, ever Henderson county? thing like 4 rednecks moonshine, think ok. Imagine many people thinking ""I'm sure covid, want go get tested can't spare money""

It's hard see much hiding real infection numbers!

Here NZ, testing + treatment free, consult phone, everything contact traced. That's beat virus, none expensive testing forcing cases underground stuff!

And that's thousands tests day finding cases community months, quarantine. ""Leaving people die homes"" sound like reopen rhetoric.

No one that. one calling that. fibbing. agree, uptick new cases weeks significant uptick deaths. based demographics latest surge infections death toll may climb significantly. JFC warning city wide protests three weeks? know radius this? surrounding areas affected? surprise, country music show. jokes write themselves. Deliberate not, foolhardy wrong.

They could come start advised general populace make homemade masks.

They could begged governments corporations switch anything possible mass production n-95.

But didnt. said wearing mask fo harm good (essentially thought‚Äîcorrectly turns out‚Äîthat lot people would stupid wear mask right would end touching faces more)

But actions help implant idea masks dont even work lot peoples minds I'm Chinese, there's social cohesion, trust government say going lockdown disease serious. 
No reason trust that, government right mind would impose destructive plan economy unless disease serious? right around new years too.
Compare I've seen since US, I'd say people much ""social cohesion"" do, bad wrong time expressing them. Thank much reply! Really appreciate time took writing in-depth answer question!!! Tegnell top world too?
Swedes like tell top world, best health care world, on.

I guess people refer ""Sverigebilden"". bunch lies brainwashed herd tricked reason know story Sunshine laws, make police reports open public. Guaranteed state laws we'd hear batshit stories news, would State-man whatever state from. Actually, protests Canada. I? shouldnt charged lol question. wife working home USA. Roughly 1 month ago decided start sending infant son back daycare. mainly due fact felt give attention thought needed feeling burden trying focus work. Yes, probably sounds bad. Anyway, wondering poorly informed maybe sent back, and, take out? 


 mainly based decision send back based friends whose infants go daycare. friends similar situation previous judgement responsible people. I'm good keeping news want sift multiple conflicting recommendations do. seek advice.  


The daycare says taking precautions, like washing hands surfaces frequently, children ""socially distant"" letting parents inside. said, pickup, I've noticed none (but one, quit) employees wear masks. always wear mask go out, bothers bit, everybody seems think fine. Given state trying fully open back next week, pretty conflicted, also see US handling situation well, recent spike. think deaths spike? 288 deaths single day? know possible blame multiple people right? Stop pretending matter gets charged (unpardonable) state crimes second he's pres i'm sure risk leaving office. Sounds shady fuck Three counties wow. Meaning governor absolutely nothing. Depends mean hot weather extremely quickly suppose. study ""should considered caution"" points risks relying normal (i.e. human tolerable) hot temperatures short durations kill strains Sars-CoV-2, virus causes COVID-19, survive temperatures 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees Fahrenheit) hour, researchers found. kill virus laboratory setting, team heat 92 degrees Celsius (197 degrees Fahrenheit) 15 minutes.  study, appears [pre-print website published scientific journal peer reviewed experts, findings considered caution.  team, led Boris Pastorino, Emerging Viral Diseases Unit Aix-Marseille University, France, looking heating chemical requirements needed inactivate virus. looking risk virus poses laboratory workers regularly contact SARS-CoV-2.

 That's exactly use phase 3 (leaving aside involuntary part). want use people high chance dying vaccine work. think absolutely OK go public asymptomatic. glad Canadians like care less safety fellow Canadians.  There's shocking number people think dinosaurs hoax. anti-science foundations indeed laid while. Canada didn‚Äôt nationwide protests like US did. That‚Äôs main reason I'm aware, easier explain way people. MERS extremely limited reach. wouldn‚Äôt surprised coronaviruses similar enough offer protection. That‚Äôs suspected past. That‚Äôs exactly meant. Thank you. wish phrased way. antibodies doesn‚Äôt equal immunity. truth can't stand smell breath body temperature fluid, person already swass going might feel wow, Obama compotently leadershiped Italy, Iran, Korea, et al ? that's why...

edit: oh Bird Flu happened when? Obama even Senator yet. he's just.. that... good, guess. one turned water wine well? California? didn‚Äôt realize case much states, would definitely explain hit 2,000 cases day, already shut down.

We highest death tolls long, unfortunately, even improvements treating covid patients People keep saying this, even unrealistic poorer people. 

I started investing 1000 USD experiment. (I American though trying understand poor American mindset. average). could afford 3 SPY one vanguard. That's it. diversification (I admit spy somewhat diverse), little hopes hedge different situations absolutely 0 hope buy Amazon Alphabet stock. 

And unless stocks good dividend, get almost nothing back retire. sounds good theory (investing letting money thing), catastrophic event happens, like covid need money, stocks also fall. counter need actual savings.... poor millennial experience. Low stability 

Now also really dangerous time get stocks. feds going brrrr months knows happen. 

**But.** people lets say 5K+ USD nothing bank, agree assessment. Buy index fund forget like 10 years later happy little surprise. Oh America. LOL Enlighten me, closing cities help ""them"". saw comments youtube news channels, saying things like time. get it. WAPO's take hospitals get overwhelmed, states like TX AZ *right there*, death rate almost certainly going up. It‚Äôs old people getting admitted hospitals ICU, fact video posted today inside look Houston ICU...crowd younger you‚Äôd think. 

The doctor vid says himself, they‚Äôre two weeks max maxed happens people going die. It‚Äôs really don‚Äôt like narrative ‚Äúit kills elderly sick‚Äù...that‚Äôs reason ignore threat, let hospitals get overwhelmed see way unnecessary deaths. like maturity level T-Cells. Stop second think is.


Why would company develop vaccine something kill people mild inconvenience? happened 2016 DN.C convention well. B. ernie delegates walked half convention empty, never saw TV. Thank goodness Periscope. district handed Chromebooks wifi hotspots well, enough devices every student. students didn‚Äôt devices whole time. High school middle school prioritized hotspots one students couldn‚Äôt get internet place block address. wet market first observed, necessarily first happened. even research coming suggests circulating prior wet market. additionally, sent team China within last 48 hours look depth origins virus. never fact originated wet market, initial assumption, science said likely time. now, assumption reconsidered. 

it similar SARS betacoronaviruses, means related bats. remember correctly, novel coronavirus 96% similar coronaviruses bat populations. 

i asking true, asking possible, considered. looking around journals WHO's website, could find anything points postulation even considered, asking something possible, therefore, worth considering. again, explain why, listen. Finally. talked months via reports elsewhere. Many fighting it, saying it‚Äôs true, despite past reports studies. 

Hope gains PR people aware. Restaurants, malls, office buildings, homes, etc...

But flip side winter northern states - something needs thought especially flu (and massive complications facing WHO) COVID. combo one anyone wants.

Ultimately... even reason everyone needs wearing mask public place. Ahhhh... another touchy subject some. T-cell antibody blood donors blood tested  mentioned anything yet. bet not. done zero restrictions outside mandating masks. live, today, ten ICU beds left entire city. Going get fun here. ""new"" antibody. T-cells. Everyone them. groundbreaking (other studies suggested while). would like say American populace never ceases amaze but.... made illegal wear mask public transit Quebec? Absolutely nothing all

\- City LA   need lock half millions 18 cases. find people people connections like tawain. tell us locked every city 10 20 cases? they? link points future study. Getting 10K people volunteer experimental vaccine easy. also donated something like 125,000 treatment courses, $3120 per treatment course comes $390 million dollar donation. bad $70 million investment. H1N1 end?

I remember also wide spread, 50 million peak? generally use bathroom alone, wash hands afterward. Hand washing highly effective aren‚Äôt breathing someone else‚Äôs air. course masking still important since prior users person another stall could infected, flushing causes aerosols. I‚Äôd probably cover cloth mask dispo one skanky rest stop. it‚Äôs still much safer breathing recirculated air packed tiny space hours. Gig driver here. Went 2 different restaurants today. Big sign windows ""mask required"" total 3 customers establishments placing go orders w/o masks. North Carolina hospital tell call collect though. well Always ask itemized bill contest charges. It‚Äôs ridiculous fucked charges be. Many hospitals like Methodist won‚Äôt treat unless prepay send bills afterwards well. friend horrible growth neck hospital refused treat prepaid thousands dollars. growth wasn‚Äôt life threatening huge noticeable. much affected quality life. Insurance companies like blue cross blue shield ended relationship Methodist caught overcharging customers. went county hospital recently. got wallet check looked like crazy. I‚Äôve used prepay hundreds thousands dollars get treatment didn‚Äôt know didn‚Äôt ask money. even paying premiums turn around crazy expensive deductibles. educator one largest school districts state. benefits lack fucking criminal. fucking hope so. I‚Äôve lost much respect others this. It‚Äôs internal struggle. Cases low country, 3 yesterday, progress fragile. go try enjoy myself? towing line saying home avoiding friends family? no. I‚Äôll stay home. I‚Äôll watch cases skyrocket again. Mother fuckers. Oh yay county üôÑ I‚Äôm sure 10s thousands protestors gathering days end nothing it.

Bars opened LA county less full week already shut again. 

Let‚Äôs real though, anything made absolute mockery extended lockdown CA, nightly telecasts thousands protestors gathering every major city around US. 

I don‚Äôt care feel protests justified not, still occurred middle pandemic still likely contributed spread people comparing states 1000s miles away. holiday around corner everyone gets drunk hell large gatherings. could go wrong? Doubling time without intervention like 5 weeks.

Shutting means find cases, extinguish spread exit lockdown sooner. something related recent seasonal cold strain possibly providing layer immunity? Spoke T-cells well. would mean 100,000,000 people died. (also using 7.5 billion figure amount people alive Earth, original 7 like OP said.) 


EDIT Yeah right too, expressed decimal. said percent, totally care enough change it. Oh totally. fill paperwork etc. Took month time finalize. Damn glad though.  Statistically still wrong less wrong now. People ignoring advice rather listened Trump look got US. Countries listening scientists people work field much better countries completely ignorant science. surprised all. Thank you! üò∑ that, small businesses gotten ground:  Figures. things never change.  Sounds right!   
 *cries* first week March make shift mortuary erected land far me. see window. one dead person gone gates. busy nurses people going in/out.

I believe second wave know coming bigger.

Pubs stay closed least September even though predict second wave full swing come October. people hating ""boomers"" selfish? I've always wondered like retarded could interpret ""roughly 50% patients diagnosed Sars-CoV-2 ‚Äì virus responsible causing illness Covid-19 ‚Äì experienced neurological problems.""

as 50% get CV19 permanent neurological damage.

What's like? That‚Äôs great news all. risk people isolate constant threat death *years*. lot risk people... 

Either way enough young people get sick fast enough still overwhelm healthcare. estimated 6% population exposed still leaves 94% naive hosts.  jobs they've pretty much $40-60 paycheck. Pretty standard mind employee assisted insurance. I'm pretty middle road income. can‚Äôt get past pay wall, charge COVID test all?  CARES Act makes COVID tests free everyone. mask wearing policies should‚Äôve present back April. course people wearing masks, there‚Äôs lot people really pushing pit us none would‚Äôve happened kept shutdown place much longer was.

I‚Äôm saying find weird there‚Äôs overwhelming amount headlines masks, there‚Äôs lot incredibly stupid political decisions led this. Guess who‚Äôs gonna beg even money already get. Florida pathetic. don‚Äôt know get information from, could r/MapsWithoutNZ ? hear ya. Last summer, husband broke ankle. lost count number bills explanations benefits. 

He fell July 2. fell difficult-to-access place, meant needed professionals (EMTs) get safely. ambulance arrived took nearest hospital. ER stabilized break, gave pain meds referred surgeon. (Everyone involved amazing, way. Top notch care).

He went surgeon days later, booked surgery week later, recovered home couple months. nasty scar, completely recovered end summer. 

But bills. 

* Ambulance: insurer denied coverage that. reasoning wasn‚Äôt life threatening, taken urgent care. I‚Äôm sure would dragged ditch steep hill myself, ten phone calls later still hook pay ~$650. 
* ER: Hospital network, pay $100 copay. resident treated wasn‚Äôt, neither radiologist, pay (b/c, know, got pick treated got /s). don‚Äôt remember exact amount, out-of-pocket maximums different in-network vs out-of-network. hit max in-network right away (he‚Äôd expensive procedure earlier year), out-of-network nowhere close. Something like $5,000 pocket. 
* Surgery: Surgeon in-network (thank god), anesthesiologist wasn‚Äôt, money (I don‚Äôt even remember...thousands). out-patient surgery center also state (we live northern Virginia, right Maryland border), caused headaches... nothing crazy, phone calls. 

In all, choice own, husband fell hill, ditch, $10,000. lucky bunch money health savings account, covered lot cost. One broken ankle...I can‚Äôt imagine nightmare serious. 

If lived developed country, bill would would parking hospital. need look deeper subject. entire fields people devote PhDs calculating stuff. One really simple calculation doesn‚Äôt require lot maths remdesivir cuts hospitalization three days value brings cost three days hospitalization. would charge according value. need adjust behavior accordance science disease, otherwise fucked.

Yes, part behavior going accepting risk time. safe visit family? No. going safe visit Christmas? No. going safe next Christmas? Probably not. question is: take risk visit? americans really think health care bad? Since KC resident, I've used many Star articles. So, case included, texts mayor got. states are? parties, healthcare workers, morticians, ect board this? passing infectious bodies get buried without lot ppl? Please explain think is? States report data. don‚Äôt know. We‚Äôll make first wave find out. Sure. express view anything beyond legal question whether landlords sell income properties eviction moratorium.

A sensible policy would provide assistance ""mom pop"" landlords truly need rental income pay bills. Landlords general sector scum make us actively worse off. I'm landlord-tenant attorney, FWIW. We‚Äôre supposed stock? üòñ

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  state in? Downvoting link scientific report?  article claims herd immunity 43%.

This pretty interesting, examples world.

For one, New York‚Äôs sudden drop cases widespread nature suggests could number close it.

But there‚Äôs Ohio prison 80% tested positive.

Are examples 40%+ positivity? anything prison example could different majority kids' school re-opens face-to-face we'll homeschooling next year. high-risk family members face-to-face school risky. 

Can imagine kid bringing COVID home school parent sibling die? never want kids situation. Doctors necessarily scientists. also rolled public, especially without testing (too bad confident gave kids). normally need least two rounds clinical trials healthy volunteers. Doctors follow scientific principles time unfortunately. Thanks sharing this. face exec level quite telling Thank. You. 

The day smoking cigarette epiphany... conspiracy theorists (like Alex Jones) seek something normal, scared change normal. like idea grand illusion, fear behind curtain, regardless is. So, reality (the virus) hits want true apart worldview, weird Minority Report-Orwellian science fiction stuff. breaks illusion. hard point wild notions conspiracy becomes painfully apparent disorganized fa√ßade-like world truly is. game puppets, bunch selfish people grabbing things like hungry hungry hippos. 

If made sense. dont think worded well.  recently told employer (outpatient physical therapy) would longer providing us KN95 masks (provided week ‚ÄúN95s available‚Äù) studies shown beneficial surgical masks surgical masks cheaper. I‚Äôve poked around CDC website cannot find info. I‚Äôm wondering familiar know wheee find it? Thanks whole lifetime, they're longer scared show publicly. think begs question happens never develop vaccine, least years.

Life continue like forever. People simply comply government orders certain point, especially costs livelihood. disease maximum 3% mortality rate, mostly impacting elderly immunocompromised people. certain point, young people especially comply. People early- mid-20s hurt job losses, they‚Äôre least impacted virus. provide source? need excuses stop testing cases. Problem solved. They've mostly left legally armed protesters alone. sure fuck much consistency days, there? chalk insane amount stress everyone under. Stay well!  faaaaaair...

Oh, might be. mention possiblity short report tho. fucked people?! Christ.

I guess answers question. horrific. I've ventured little since March. couple times someone confronted regarding mask. funny though, always back right let know fiance treats COVID patients every day I'm wearing mask protect them, me. move towards act like I'm going take mask get real fucking interested elsewhere. 

Same thing work. I'm attorney several judges pushing transition back video court person... Except me. They're absolutely fine video.

Also, people harvesting food industrial scale also suffering bad outbreaks. need keep working long people still need grocery stores cannot shut down. Minimizing exposure also helps them. 

You right. can‚Äôt grow absolutely everything yard, every item grow less time need spend grocery store, maybe one less visit month. means less crowding grocery store. less crowded grocery store, less virus transmitted.

I feel like companies eat cost rental cars safety employees. think people understand risks flying. mean, TSA agents testing positive early masks on, believe airports bad environment, let alone airplane.

Curious type contract work, least essential view on-site visits. I'm disappointed people need government say whether travel work restricted, that's determines whether agreements upheld not. 

Forget pretzels, lol. stop that! Sweden did, I'm sure I'll trust anything Covid-19 though. Maybe evictees shoot cops coming serve evictions we‚Äôll get police reform royal officials. Sweden republic.

I get people refuse accept virus real change daily lives. longer people refuse mask distance longer surges be. guess we'll playing wack-a-mole, state state, next 6-12 months. lot people truly believe thing US.

Yet government employees listed inventors, one expert suggested corrected, especially era federally financed research might leveraged collect royalties or, arguably, lower price medicines.

So government money, facilities, employees helped Gilead develop drug Gilead make money from. Privatize gains, socialize losses. Assuming testing rates keep increasing (and admit know India) minister telling truth (big assumption) outbreak hitting peak soon places driving numbers. big county, outbreaks shift elsewhere, U.S., driving new surges. that's different story.

This exactly happening. think best rule thumb wear one times indoors (except home course), least one outdoors put getting close people. probably need one taking walk around neighborhood quiet, want one walking around busier city street. think know forced means haha could home schooled. could transfer schools. could go school year. decreasing mostly flat fringe outliers. can't bunch rest use reasons shut entire planet. 

It's pretty pathetic amount panic. see many people alcohol kills year, yet liquor stores deemed essential?? cost manufacture tell whole picture include cost development. expect video game cost 1 cent cost 1 cent print CD on. There's years development, production, etc. goes video game. army scientists, doctors, regulatory specialists, etc. working drug around clock get data approval - going see costs look production costs.

I understand public getting swindled they're getting free drug least 6x tax money paid for. put $70 million get $390 million. That's $390 million tax payers pay anymore get sick, pretty good return investment.

Because originally 'deaths' scary word use headlines. media would drilled Coronavirus coverage indefinitely demonstrations occurred. riots looting fizzled out, media quickly shifted back Covidland. Since March, country ramped testing slowly started phase re-openings (which people seem realize to, problems much worse stayed lockdown forever seems people sub REALLY REALLY want.) Anyway, re-open people leave houses cases going up, fucking obvi. media still needs keep people terrified though, 'cases' replaced 'deaths' scary word. shocking majority cases equate deaths many people test positive symptoms mild symptoms. try talk Reddit, monster wants kill grandma. incapable thinking rationally, watch many downvotes get. Hospitals, city, county, state, right? comes zombie apocalypse... website broke computer freak out. viruses literally found every day except click bait. karma finest prize funded tax payers? members committed elected officials? 

Guess not.  oversight CDC, need criminally investigated. absolutely nothing done preparation pandemic. NOTHING. 
Billions wasted every year. need heads roll massive criminal negligence. They're probably big problem we're seeing states. stupid stupid florida.

Fuck goverment, feel sorry people. blame North Koreans Kim done would you? know evil country is, others idea way life. terrifying. title article slightly misleading feel. Air conditioning comes many different forms system types. Generally public think AC think cooling main job HVAC system provide suitable enviorment space . means controlling tempreture, humidity air quality. talking systems cool room air move around within space also bring fresh air outside. Therefore could argue need good air conditioning design rather air conditioning within spaces. 

Therefore need look ventilation issue AC issue. restaurant instance rows tables opened window air move window across several tables potentially moving virus accross room. ventilation system local supply extract could reduce potentially air pulled one side room maintain constant refreshing room air.  


Where waters muddied generally restaurants ventilation split unit cooling room pushing stale air around. would argue AC unit isnt problem lack ventilation. 

On larger systems another issue contend central systems recirculate air, dont think studies concluded increased risk transmission systems advise seen systems set 100% fresh air possible filters changed regularly. increse energy costs system potentially systems capable operating way.  


So yeh, personally think AC isnt issue rather poor ventilation lookn increased HVAC systems HVAC systems turned exhasperate problem reducing air change rates occupied spaces. think crux issue pandemic control indoor public spaces always increased risk transmission. Example NL: call test Sunday 19:00, get test done Monday 09:00-09:03, results online &amp; phone call Monday 12:30.

At point think important every family help risk family members help convince stay home general public really care getting others sick (for whatever reason). do, government failed us, point need personal responsibility, even limited others (not wearing masks public) absolutely ruin every personal precaution taken last 4 months.

Stay safe everyone. Probably different factors.

Let‚Äôs cross bridge come it. need around 40 percent people antibodies think good There's crazy... there's Donald. whole new level crazy. Trump makes George W. Bush look like saint.

But face big crises, didn‚Äôt crow greatness hold big rallies talk himself. didn‚Äôt deliberately shit constitution calling press enemy people. salute leader country hellbent nuking allies.

At bare minimum ability act like president Put policy ego. year military budget 721.5 billion dollars case countries like San Marino, Vatican, Malta shoot top. per capita rates useless. good day, dude. see rooting prolonged pandemic Much better, active cases 16,681.

It‚Äôs bud we‚Äôre way past 4 degrees warming 2050 talk yet live. live Tampa Bay, Florida. That‚Äôs middle west coast. Beautiful beaches. People come world.

The problem may literal beach itself. squabble whether it‚Äôs ok outside socially distanced. 

Here problem... anyone tell majority beaches surrounded bars restaurants right beach. 

It‚Äôs lifestyle. go beach, walk crowded restaurant eat drink. go back beach lie around enjoy sun water sober up. maybe stay bar keep drinking hanging new friends.

Our gov MIA, take elected county officials. recently made masks required, I‚Äôm hoping right thing here. Yes, well said. bit one sided biased post history special Redditor often post factually dubious content. wanted post-balancing mostly factually wrong information. think problem even coverage people take precautions won't. get large geographical areas like deep south like less 20% mask usage (I live GA that's I've seen Publix, let alone Walmart) spreads like fire dry tinder. course Trump big reason.. European feel US handling first world country. proper social security means people lose jobs go bankrupt.. saying happening Europe, lot less extend.. issues US much like poorer countries.

Same goes healthcare. People able afford treatment typically something poorer countries, first world countries. AIDS vaccine still. Polio vaccine took decades. curve generally flattened. hospitals may overwhelmed, majority havent been. areas hospitals stretched, sure, require masks. wasnt one make claim 20%, I'm one questioning claim. 

 person made claim one support it.  I'm Utah. Heart Trump country. Utah County. heart heart. 

As many 90% bare-faced. varies. Early morning shoppers masked, nid-day shoppers aren't. there's surge cases, masks days. Excuse violates constitutional right foundation mask. injects disinfectants daily. Good enough. Covid 2 wk period still contagious little symptoms. Everyone 100% reasonable case.

Wear fucking mask. Well good Gilead. I‚Äôm glad American ideals record breaking profits back suffering still alive. yet hope us! /s record stuff w phone discreet manner. case.

And let us forget Europe got done first wave USA still middle it. Add Europe's significantly older population USA's, fact Europeans smoke far Americans, fact COVID hit Italy knew nothing treatment, time came USA least data protocols coming Europe... Truth matter gonna find something resembling real death tolls maybe four five years line areas. states like Florida learned lie. Also infection wave last week. Death wave doesn‚Äôt come til 10 days later. Wait til next weekend say dEaThS?!? corner Washington I'd say damn near 100% everywhere go. Except old people clearly redneck types look like they're hoping confrontation. ""I need gather thousands, destroy stuff, social distance, essential!!!!"" Football arena. It‚Äôs stadium. Question untracked community transmission 

Does anyone credible information speculating untracked community transmission ?  Maybe scholarly article positing 'real' numbers might ?

I see infection rates bandied like concrete, seems absurd me, unless I'm missing someone. logic pretty simple:

1) asymptomatic mildly symptomatic

2) Large volumes people unwell told go home, self isolate (escalate symptoms become serious), basically cuddle pillow

3) Therefore possible, outright likely, real numbers would inflated people would measured official infection rates

I think actually positive - recovered persons represent herd immunity, basically living shield infection. wondering anybody seen credible scientific sources project herd immunity, ideally considers whether real infection numbers higher official cases.

My country makes bald statements like ""no community transmission state"", understand assert (without adding ""(that know of)"", state absolute firm.

Anyway, curious untracked illness recovery, persons access tests, want wait line amongst rows sick people, feel sick enough justify one way t'other.

My family went bout flu, know we've recovered COVID19, understanding there's way know, interested wrap head around aspect epidemiology. 24-hr cable news: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand question won‚Äôt respond it.‚Äù I'm sorry. nothing luck. every opportunity better failed.

Do better, get Trump OUT, care others communities. Stay safe. Agree, clarify i'm saying open (they closed). yes club dumb opening, see bear hospital bills someone getting virus establishment (except employees). like club forcing people come (except employees). countries slowed virus without full lock down. Ultimately comes person part stop spread e.g. wear mask, avoid unnecessary outings etc. way see it, bigger issue actually people packed club. slow recommend masks. I'm Australian, didnt know US supposed world leader lol. thought friend nice to, avoid conflict, laugh behind back. ""The beach"" lobbyists DeSantis's ear. Restaurants, bars, hotels do. thinking last night: Pence believes still going Heaven everything come Trump administration - probably left come years come - he's got another thing coming. trying say? AC-130 private insurance...? Would meeting one family member outside ok? Would eating food cook ok? thought would considered like take out. thought boring plates utensils style. Cause many people fundamentally self-centered selfish pieces shit.

I've come across several older folks existing breathing conditions like asthma, COPD chronic bronchitis able wear mask fabric face covering needed short periods time public. people would likely deserve pass needed, instead, folks without conditions bitching making piss-poor excuses themselves. ""It's uncomfortable"", ""You're breathing CO2, dangerous"", ""It's flu, whole thing overblown."" One person went far say wearing mask mentally triggers PTSD car crash, 'masked shamed' others causes similar distress anxiety. Someone actual empathy others would realize *not* wearing mask pandemic causes others anxiety fear catching potentially life-threatening illness. 

Wearing mask sucks, want precious economy remain open, fucking deal it. mask usage becomes consistently accepted widespread shit, I'll continue spend money masks instead local businesses. Even masks absolutely nothing, many at-risk people would least *feel* safer going spending money. Fuck excuses, fuck lack empathy fuck ""freedom"". I'm sad, people make world worse place, tolerance created entire generation though? GW‚Äôs terrible worked media admin remember freedom fries meme nod back WW2 freedom fries liberty sandwiches (hamburgers). Like remember joke something admin actually said. Title edited original article title. delete re-post real title. even read articles anymore. come comments continue believe everyone country moron. Love New York. Beat it, pretty sure fucked entire world lol Let's prop Fauci either. Dude TV doctor spends time air anything else. prefer get facts source without going mouthpiece. wonder happens state declares they're postponing holding voting need mail ballots unable get Yep, guess we'll see Roberts still conscience else conservative elites supposed perpetrate genocide minors poor people?

However, Dem controlled house put across bandaids solve gaping wound social welfare program. Hillary would solved issue either (seeing interest solving it).

Would Hillary‚Äôs tactical response pandemic much better? Yes. Would solved underlying issues broken healthcare system, weak social safety nets, throw solving systemic police violence? No. even anti-mask crowd. can‚Äôt count many times I‚Äôve seen post deaths Reddit one top comments be, ‚Äúyeah, old he?‚Äù, ‚Äúbut asthma‚Äù, ‚Äúhe overweight.‚Äù fucking dismissive.

Would interesting see said redditor would posted article hadn't. major newspaper, previous posts account clearly used feed biased opinions Follower... Narcissistic arrogant assholes care anyone else sure. attacked years successive right wing governments point nearly collapsing. Needs rebuilt. Super dooper. Afterwards let people travelled Australia's border without generating carbon pollution. Jesus would Jesus want destroy Pacific families' island homes. Don‚Äôt forget administration also openly trying repeal ACA global pandemic replacement plan sight! office (in Austria) still says ‚Äústay home possible way. come office, Anita teams plan, keep distance, wear masks, sanitizers floor - use disinfect workstation use‚Äù


I see office since mid March won‚Äôt quite time. Homeoffice new way everyone it. ones can‚Äôt teams allowed mix up.

Man hope guy enjoyed bat day... Excuse mate sub r/fnafcringe overrun it‚Äôs bad please make mod help run sub? mods abandoned reddit please act let help No, reasonable. places is. places isnt. Rural residents already generally isolated.  Put masks you. Separate much share common items little possible. Disinfect home. Get enough supplies food medical last 2+ weeks without going out.

Yup! recorded proshot 2016. trailer here: say that. says China's done 3x many tests America.

Breathlessness fatigue go hand hand. Separately, example, fatigue alone suggest lung scarring. Fatigue breathlessness would. 

And also medically accurate say lung damage frequently irreversible. support healing scar tissue often becomes dead lung. significant amount dead lung personal experience particular. dont believe ""permanent irreversible fatigue / loss breath"" extremely common effect COVID. 

I genuinely care believe. I'm paid convince you. point knowledge limited areas here's emerging research saying. 

I think serves anyone believe I, stranger, writes internet. I'm encouraging sincerely care reject I'm saying. 

Like things, emerging research emerging foolproof.

All identify trends I'm seeing emerge contextualize them.

Soon enough, we'll either see issue scaremongering. Yes, cases seem come Covid serious effects. doesnt seem common *at all* would visibility it, among recovered Covid patients.

Information important. Even information might make people scared.

And, again, ton studies long term health problems COVID-19. lot evidence says happen lot evidence period.

It's like... deciding study crime scene declaring Todd committed crime. Sure, might have. still investigate rule suspects.

You evidence say minority recoveries. evidence say common enough, see almost every study investigates it. Evidence support claim exceeds evidence supports yours.

I still care believe it. think we'll find soon enough. Tbh, never quite got idea social distancing cramped tube hurtling sky. truth Quebec‚Äôs earlier spring break gave virus jump start really understood impacts travel. time, really China Iran looking super bad travellers taking precautions upon returning. time rest country spring break, lots known lots travel cancelled. still travelled better understanding risks act returned.  record heard posted thank you. want point two paragraphs somewhat contradict saying though.

""There data infections among protesters. circumstantial evidence, anecdotes, basic biology suggest protesters got sick spread coronavirus even overall case numbers didn‚Äôt spike.""

(I'm dumb know proper quotes)

But paragraph merely seem suggest evidence pretty much hearsay, however, one directly it:

""An increasing number new COVID-19 cases across country among people 20s, 30s, 40s,¬†the New York Times reported. Protesters predominantly younger age groups.""

mind nothing directly connects rise cases circumstantial evidence. that's point.

my point /not just/ right causing rise seen anyone point yet. thank posting I'm glad seems like protesting much damage could be. Recovery period last two months. yes.

Let big business help themselves, money, time focus people change. trying spell whoosh? Let's simple math.

If reduce infections 90%, 90% fewer cases it.

So 10%, masks used, infect others, right, 10%... means 1% people infected.

So masks continued worn, 1% infect 0.1%, forth yes, gone.

And want wear mask. know explain China using fact national company owns shares media platform proof paying hide fact using COVID cover global takeover. think originally given option 30% capacity, NYC starting shut things went batshit crazy. chose shut instead running 30% profitable.

Thank much  financial systems loans disappear without word, stuck. can't pay back, 1 paycheck even drop interest loan. Every company loans work me, would start, take one payment plan, company would gone next payment. **Right now, one holds loans, actively collected.**  

This sounds.. either fabricated like extraordinary circumstance. I'm sorry deal uh.. holder(s) student loans passed loan balance around one another multiple times folded time? certain balance loans 'not held' right thus unpayable? credit report say far balance owned whom?

Being unable make required monthly payment unfortunate, though. much fault loan holder, though. sure that's meant imply, could never attended expensive school, Kaplan University, I'm one caught predatory school. Stop trolling.

Who's trolling? made horrible financial decision attend one fake schools genuinely sorry fucked badly. made choice - one forced course. 

To compare debt knowingly acquired slavery just.. work. poor taste best. thing happened AL today. Low yesterday big spike today backlog. That's really good idea one suggest parents! talking mom seemed nervous well hopefully try make work best can.

Apparently nursing home supposed allow people near porches though, they're letting us cuz know grandpa dying. shooed mom away FDPH inspector showed lol.

iMask trendy enough social media people use fashion wealth statement instead trying political it. (if) vaccine becomes available something go dr for? don‚Äôt insurance? 

It‚Äôs hard imagine mass world wide vaccinations. US public health officials forced change stance mask wearing becuase NYT op ed 20 years East Asia wearing masks outbreaks.   packed bar???? least outdoors. Big article highlighted   Well I'll tell joke retired friends know one exactly one temporarily transition new property. That's know expenses are. know expenses really makes numbers pulled nowhere seem silly.

Your arguments respect counterpart's situation. crass landlord said ""Why pay rent. always work money."". freeze rent without accounting landlord's expenses really asking stranger pay housing risk becoming member working class, member working class pays house, can. can't become member working class major credit hurdles. would anyone that? sat front row show once. see lot spittle flying. went NYC see entire thing avoidable.

I live Seattle know $15 tough wage live of, much less thrive of, fully support government increasing minimum wage. However, happens, it‚Äôs complex situation businesses. draw line acceptable wage? happens businesses proactively increase wages others don‚Äôt, thereby gaining advantage terms operating expenses? think massive spikes Florida Texas caused protestors? Protestors wearing masks also outside, ideal far seen anything saying cause new hospital filling outbreaks.

If really want precious risky gatherings start thousands crammed together, indoors, masks, listen Trump. long protestors less reckless Trump modeling, who's really bigger problem? cost make said $10, actually. Sooooo post bunch data vomit.

Okay, start easy one. Tell essentially useless statistic.

""Twelve states hit record highs daily new cases Wednesday based seven-day average, analysis found."" realize perfect, worry work kids. get WFH wife made decision (for now) stay-at-home mom. But, ton people across US can't that. rely schools provide child care meals kids. means kids suffer - parents can't work much kids eat.

Even worse add substance/domestic abuse equation. Studies around pandemics shown typically make poor poorer really affect rich since money weather shutdowns.

The real work weight risks sides. would guess case Schools, risks teachers/kids getting COVID-19 still going lower risks kids/families rely schools. seen stated, least clip article read, would shocked waiver RNC.

Wishing moved Canada 2008 let Americans :( don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre seeing that. According covidtracking.com, didn‚Äôt start averaging ~500k per day mid-June.

Also, comparing late March/early April now. Early April, deaths peaking, roughly 100-150k test per day. it‚Äôs well 500k, clearly difference. 

But don‚Äôt misinterpreted I‚Äôm saying mean don‚Äôt think problem right now. Cases clearly rising dramatically across south southwest. One example propaganda convincing Americans Covid-skeptics kind people. making emergency fund grow cash. making for... emergencies. huge difference ""there always risk finance"" giving financial advice could put people debt. What? connect ""it"" contextually sort substantive ... Mine loved yell break stuff.  way moving back him. test positive
I Asked sharp joint pains especially ok sides believe ignore problem long enough it'll go away. isnt headache governors, herpes, go away own. pay college? graduated 2004 $75,000 student loans. One social trend I've noticed lot people picked 5-10 friends/family members they're ride die with, seem limiting circle them. granted turn 30 year, part definitely natural progression growing older, seem like pandemic accelerated process.

I feel like lot ""second tier"" friendships getting frayed whole thing. people maybe prefer way, least fair number friends would enjoy seeing 4-5 times year may see person quite now, that's bummer. state spends $17,000 per kid per year. Online homeschooling programs $4000 year. difference could help lot families. It‚Äôs tough. expensive. You‚Äôve got whole new set people - production crew - well new choreography blocking. factor watch actually pay watch it. hand, networks experience presenting live shows get advertisers board, could run limited series. funny commenting wife last night lack new episodes things reminiscent writers strike 2007-8. don‚Äôt want us finding bay harbor butcher  moved back parents 2008. chic 2010. got rude comments work wished I'd never mentioned anyone people asked lived. years people jealous need loan reduction form work I'd paid student loans heads debt car loans rent mortgages. Honestly dude people like playing ""devil's advocate"" disease last 4 fucking months, always end wrong. saying. lol need force. Coercive measures way ensure compliance 35-40% country thinks pandemic fake, Democratic/Chinese/WHO plot, flu. cannot use logic reason people.

Start fines, arrests repeat offenders. Staff stores authorized order people leave. Regular citizens shaming shunning people wearing masks.

I like type tactic people's lives risk real threat (unlike exaggerated threat terrorism """"""national security"""""") I‚Äôm sure make post without deleted. Let‚Äôs say used phrases like ‚Äúmoral turpitude‚Äù ‚Äúshame‚Äù may directed failure lead see every day Florida US. would far faster list ways WH response went right.  nice option oppressive government locking home weeks sounds like improvement right now, might smart American. definitely exhausting. would like link aggregator sites, I'd appreciate it! Better late never.  mean, us would rather wrong person see error ways EVENTUALLY rather all.  Hopefully Pence's new stance save lives make easier convince ""certain"" people worthwhile mask up.

That said, given importance role Pence Trump fill, made answer past (and ongoing) negligence vote November.  (Hopefully vote!). Per article ‚Äúlap dances canceled.‚Äù we‚Äôd get close 100k daily cases then... last flight took, two guys those. dinky little Aura looked laughed. Take seriously don‚Äôt fly all.

I really wish better PPE stockpile here. Everybody getting proper N95 keep them. Stairway heaven. beaches packed either way, likely makes difference. makes think ""increase corresponding way cases""?

Also, 7 day moving average deaths FL level increasing since late  also helps bunch loser rats proved claw away votes let oldest senile bunch goddamn choice vs trimp.

Biden could die still. Bernie runner up. better future ""nothing fundamentally change"" still possible. Good thing authoritative word subject. Exactly point. listen politicans. okay use dearth data say can't talk long term issues terms lack time needed properly evaluate dearth data used fear monger long term issues? color confused dancers:  Fuck dumbass doesn‚Äôt mean anything going filled anyways free literally something called ""lunk alarm"" caught making noises lifting weights



It's kind tiresome anything that's supposed promote ""inclusivity and/or equality"" country immediately pivots hypocrisy within execution. Well, tested whole re-opening immediately strategy largely failure economy struggling result. please get back reasonable measures now? husband ER once. tried asking doctor, insurance point person, nurses much we'd charged could prepare looked like insulted them. That's US healthcare system. call that. matter happens November, we're looking sudden turn-around kind. We're looking trying go horrific bad. Bad's definitely improvement horrific, good whole lot fronts. I‚Äôve two gym memberships since 2012. One lunchtime one morning work weekends. cancelled soon Louisiana went phase 2 gyms started billing against. I‚Äôm working garage least next year. F this. Okay, fair. (correct) logic - testing = new cases...

Re: Florida

6/22: \~3000 new cases

6/27: \~9600 new cases

Is anything indicates they're testing 3x number people day 5 days? Unless somehow figured test WAY people days, cases are, fact, way up. American, sadly, solidly category 'can't handle it' due complete lack leadership rush 'reopen' well ahead reasonable guidelines. 

Exhibit A:  May 12, 2020 World Health Organization (WHO) advised governments reopening,¬†rates positivity testing (ie, tests conducted, many came back positive COVID-19) remain 5% lower least 14 days. [As June 29, 24 states remain recommended positivity sure European joke rich person joke. decision made. beaches thing draws tourists. least Florida something. Even hypothetically using Vitamin took death mile cough days, headline would still true. So, thanks...? would test 12 year old? Using logic, would 20 millions people dead now.

There public assistances place help situation (food bank, churches, unemployment agencies, charities, free health clinics,...) lied, ""no symptoms"" go work, ultimately, killing many people.

I'm reopening debate getting clarifier (like always lol) arguing gardening sustainable time! lot people seemed think was, ever wanted argue stores open full lockdown non-essential services aha. I'm done *drops keyboard*

I think get saying friends, also think empathetic willing accept wonderful personality trait! see much way promoting pride Toronto usually huge here... worry much virus anyways point. Though none political leaders stupid enough hold indoor, unmasked affair right now, even great numbers. Tell stop getting news reddit, facebook, twitter. home improvement stores (Leroy Merlin, Brico d√©p√¥t, Castorama) closed first weeks quarantine. reopened, everyone wear mask, stores could allow limited number people store one time. drive service things, generally essential items: light bulbs, plumbing stuff, things like that. hand, currently 634 COVID-19 cases ICUs entire country, compared two months ago, that's pretty good. prevent coronavirus think anyone ever thought did. saying low levels vitamin causing negative effects people get levels check immune systems fight infection better. get paid twice month? That's unusual. (Or maybe there). $40 really cheap, might want keep job while. reminds mom mother-daughter trip NYC spring 2000. going go World Trade Center see view, she'd never been. got busy like, ""Well, it'll always there, we'll next time.""

Shit go planned. agree protest good idea right now, however need one hundred percent people wear masks. nothing every little bit helps. pictures protests I've seen like 95% wearing masks. 

If people general took seriously always wore mask anytime public, including beach, beach probably big deal either.

look Japan South Korea, deadly populated countries got early outbreaks kept control way better america, everybody's willing wear mask. mask effective less locking did. means economy better. Nearly everything open. Bars, restaurants, open everyone wears mask whenever possible. Ask someone lives there, business usual except hygiene. Masks=good economy. wonder stock market North Dallas suburb, see maybe 50% masks anywhere go.  I'm sure overly sarcastic condescending help people learn error ways. guess still afford gas? speak them? Gee... go figure  care attendees, care hundreds thousands convention hospitality workers exposed GOP hogs, many poor likely family members pre-existing illnesses exactly problem articles. WANTS work feel sick? absolutely symptomatic. I'm sure felt terrible.

These articles exactly point blame tell story way easy assign blame.

I'd like see article blames power creating conditions nurse might choose insulin taking time due COVID-19. ü§î Glad boss covered cost. Back March, tests free. going on? Apparently become president Sad awesome time üòû ... think farmers get seeds gardening supplies from?

Farmers usually seeds agriculture supplies delivered farm semi trucks... evidence say minority recoveries.

It's really responsibility prove that.

It responsibility people say ""serious permanent damage common result Covid"" (and *a lot* people say that) need show proof back up.

And far havent seen information studies practical examples indicate true all. mayor, previously said issue mask mandate, Curry present announcement mandatory mask order Monday, done virtual meeting held 12 Kimbleton said Curry announcement ‚Äúimportant prior family commitment.‚Äù

Goodness, makes seem like made he's sulking. No. culling. wait second term. finally get reforms passed pointing mods want something it, they'll aware larger problem one post. Removing one others would biased approach. someone going dox you, piece puzzle. E.g. say live X state one point, six months later say something like ""I live near one biggest cities state"", five months mention really like Alamo Drafthouse, bam, pretty much know live. remember office started sharing coronavirus memes Jan 14, already talking get crazy, like idea simultaneously viewed outlandish people almost joke doesn‚Äôt size-able level vaccine implementation slow spread? Like seasonal flu R0 1.0 even vaccine doesn‚Äôt dismantle society every year? Like even half Americans got would still impactful? would like know mild means lasting effects impact lungs organs may permanent even mild. Ad5-nCoV, recombinant adenovirus vector vaccine. 1. ""Who numbers disgrace to? "" disgrace Asia.
2. ""businesses never really closed, SK never locked down. "" Excuses, excuses. Yeah true, think mean 'BREAKING NEWS' kinds stuff Italy still much higher death per capita US Houston, TX fucked lots people like post like you‚Äôre fucking idiot hating people Wow, Jonestown massacre?! really make comparison vaccine???

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Smart move. Pubs, restaurants hair dressers opening England 4th (with social distancing) can‚Äôt say know many people actually wanting go. late. already managed divide us even trivial topics. well said. Drinking sealed container May slight problem, since typically offer peanut level, go full flight without eating drinking greece, number tourists visited Greece 2018 rose 30.1 million.

1.1/30.1= 3.7%

And also Greek hotels reduce capacities order comply different distance rules, 4% really important.

If add Germans going Turkey year due restrictions (over 5 million per year) 2 million Germans allowed enter USA (the entry stop also applies direction) Caribbean, Asia, New Zealand (together also 2 million), think missing tourists USA problem Greece year.

I also understand always turn downplaying side. 

I planned holiday New York year postponing now. Fortunately USA let enter moment. wanted go anyway least deal cancellations. go next year 2022.  agree‚Äîyou clearly 100% immune outdoors, sense still get sick careless.

I say Japan urban unsurprising would transmission people moving around bustling streets, etc. even masks, substitute true physical distancing.

In places US (possibly all?), possible move around outside maintaing 6 ft even 10 ft separation. case, think risk becomes truly negligible. I'm not, DD trap really trigger happy police. know people drink US. falls owner to, know, discourage drunk driving.

Sounds like entirely unconcerned though. Still does. pretty much can‚Äôt believe done purpose encourage isolation testing especially countries South equator head flu season. commenter probably talking fact many, many mild cases. even though cases end badly, lot people simply go flu-like episode recover. 

If 90% people contracted virus ended ventilator coughing blood people would take lot seriously, right easy enough pass flu uneducated/ignorant people. easy turn back (statistically) ""small"" number serious cases huge portion less serious. I‚Äôm gonna speak slowly super special people reading this:

March still ton rules could tested. state cleared 70k tests two days row, 40k two days that. wasn‚Äôt happening March. even though confirmed cases looks really scary, don‚Äôt actually think many cases March. 

That said, people gotten complacent scared shitless March. That‚Äôs problem. I'll wear mask health reasons. state mandates everyone it. point, becomes necessary act civil disobedience wear mask.

This partisan issue, everyone governmental overreach. Oops, late.ü§≠You‚Äôre screwed DeSantis thank mind exploded also post story chloroquine studies (roughly price aspirin) got pulled shady company published massive fake study partially written porn star, study somehow got peer review inexplicably ended published one main medical journals fraud got found out. 

The damage done though. Chloroquine bad. Seems like would better idea close businesses leave beach open. Beach seems much safer bars restaurants. great desperate. There's good reason Buffett want anything turds. Yikes making neccessary trips? I'm sure protests riots helped fuel spread well sure dont seem hear media.Start setting steep fines jerkoffs,.money thing ppl care anyway apparently. never trusted US president living memory..

You could alternatively bring worries larger group, see people willing make trip also make concessions social distancing ""rules"". Ways travel together stay seperate? Maybe optimistic there's always possibility working something out.  watch videos recent Mexico City earthquake (just days ago) see people buildings streets almost unanimously maskless watch videos recent Mexico City earthquake (just days ago) see people buildings streets almost unanimously maskless feel like population democatic country made large proportion populist buffoons populist buffoons likely made leader so, essentially, getting 'we' wanted. I, one, looking forward populist buffoon 'we' wanted UK's economic recovery programme coupled insistence leave world's largest trading bloc circumstances half years time! called contract made *under duress* thus invalid. ""hey folks, going socially responsible sit one out. know infected careful far, would hate spread anyone else."" Please see reference article English Euractiv page: takes long time happen quickly mutating viruses- flu often takes multiple waves see substantial mutations. Covid-19 mutates much slower. Beyond that, many diseases never become mild. AIDS, Rubella, Measles, Polio, Meningitis, Ebola, etc., etc. top that, nothing lethality virus. communicability, complex lethality. Flu, example, hits people 3 days. get serious flu, you‚Äôre staying home instead going work. milder strains get opportunities infect people people go work gym etc., sicker individuals stay home. lockdown continued social distancing, NOBODY going work, people go necessities. top that, disease long incubation period, even severe strains spread.

Long story short, take misinformed best. Unfortunately Houston, 6 million people within metro immediate surrounding area. Added ""car city"" almost everyone drives vehicle travel somewhat easy large freeway system. population extremely mobile spread quickening result. Yes it‚Äôs fast tracked, it‚Äôs skipping safety trials. 

Normally vaccines drugs go trials, report findings, start production next phase. Instead, production next phase starts immediately hopes current phase goes well. one times it‚Äôs throwing money problem. normally isn‚Äôt done it‚Äôs far costly, it‚Äôs worth financial gamble instance. 

It‚Äôs five months. Five months would now. Realistically, vaccine first available end year would go neediest groups first. Idk are, you‚Äôre 65, serious pre-existing condition, work healthcare, probably won‚Äôt eligible. 

I understand skepticism suggest research making decision. journal articles vaccine trials available read. Feel free read make sure safety trial double blind randomized control trial. would say that‚Äôs probably threshold I‚Äôll trust. wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone else holding treatment standard. Dumpster fire, engage!! I'm not, DD trap really trigger happy police.

Then paying attention.

And I'm interested stranger judging politics wanted reply talk something scope. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ Yesterday's daily report included people died far back April 15th.

lmao, ace reporting  take free flight conditions, fuck getting planes? That's know audience. Instead saying 'masks save *lives*', instead say 'masks save *you*'. Maybe people individualism wear mask meant they, themselves, get sick. anti-maskers people think COVID regular flu that's whole different ballgame.  per pill? huge regional variances regarding wears masks doesn't.

Also people want know things already do. protect nothing saying things social media accounts. heard heard update weeks, still going happen?

The latest particular vaccine undergo phase 3 trial Brazil July. Makes sense Brazil lot cases Canada not. realize people like work insurance billing mess system starts make sense. Dont worry, mass evictions start US.

The relive rent expiring right now. extenuating circumstances necessary. mom getting surgery needed help fly LA MI help out. However, go back couple weeks skipping flight taking train back private room. Taking train across country bucket list anyways. understood original comment businesses fail follow guidelines would pay people's hospital bills

I guess misunderstood crux argument. particularly believe business paying hospital bills either. takes two idiots tango, saddling business another idiot's bills pretty distasteful well.

I think agree country overabundance people demanding personal rights accepting personal responsibility. whole reason medical bill expense insurance whole bunch complicated relations middle man profiting

That‚Äôs self pay much cheaper using insurance unless you‚Äôre poor insurance free Medicaid Water flowing underground thousands continue protest without social distancing protection country. little consistency would nice. Mass gatherings good not? care choose longer hypocrisy continues less care this.  still reporting time. Sadly testing T-cells harder antibody test. complicated advanced. would require special labs. right testing T-cells available. KI wants continue testing T-cells see long protection lasts. going baby boomers savings large.

Then met lot boomers know, lived whole lives taken everything given parents, told kids, saved nothing living lifestyle certain level comprehensible, expect kids support get point ""earned right"" retire. Try C-SPAN ALLSIDES

stop listening big media corp, get garbage Lmao worries bro. I‚Äôm thankful they‚Äôre production rn Rt 1.4 Florida SCARY. Murica! describing epidemic.

It's pandemic infection causing large numbers deaths worldwide. 

You disagree definition, really can't argue delayed following existing scientific definition. county data graphs, along lists highest proportional world wide stuff, find good graphs countries one worldwide, according doubling hospitalization that

and i'm sure know jhu worldometer right, get counted columns follow post, take combined pneumonia deaths column subtract deaths covid listed (this removes duplicates probably extra covid deaths involve pneumonia). leftover unspecified pneumonia deaths (influenza already removed) roughly 1k normal even remove flu go combined flu+pneumonia worst flu year recently. Europe rocky start, amazing job containing virus! Luckily don‚Äôt friends anyone gives shit don‚Äôt worry this! outrage, wait reopen influence operation hears this! Holy shit, rather dense, you?

You say ""A vaccine goes clinical trials see effective not. vaccine yet complete clinical trials yet proven effective.""

And would read damn article realized already went clinical trials. again, since apparently idea what's **The Phase 1 2 clinical trials CanSino‚Äôs vaccine candidate showed potential prevent diseases caused coronavirus**, killed half million people globally, commercial success cannot guaranteed, company Separately, AMS received approval earlier month test second experimental coronavirus vaccine humans. doctor saying vitamin defiency healthy. even 0 causation related covid (i think some, said, related outcome), check levels take suplements/sun case deficient. I'd like hear precautions they're enforcing (on staff member side). Gyms seem inherently risky side scale far activities go, I'm curious looks like practice. Checking FL, don‚Äôt leave us out, stupid stuff like state! governor seems think everything ok long younger people ones getting sick.

Not really sure proceed best ha Whole thing handled like complete shit day one simply something half sweep rug several times later hope goes away. &amp;#x200B;

The real cost would probably shock people. 

While donate everything sew (spent half yearly bonus buy material), certainly begrudge make living many people jobs, can, many donate much sell.

Theres LOTS costume designers one group frequent sewing gives something do. indeed sell great, time take skillset actually something helps others well make little coin possible.

However there's horror stories goes along that, like people wearing mask wanting send back get money back....ew.... prevent flu either, helps regulate body's immune system response. practice help prevent complication, death long term damage. said low vitamin (which common vitamin deficiency developed world) definitely consult doctor taking vitamin supplements regardless coronavirus virus. Vitamins general crucial regulating body's functions. although taking vitamins excess useless also dangerous, vitamin deficient almost always treat fast possible! Vitamins definition, even meaning name (vita life Latin), substances absolutely need live. remember taking excess good, aspire recommended vitamin levels. surprise half business owners Dallas concealed firearms nearby... Man! busted buble.
We'll catch up, see. throw loonies Serious question, remember anyone wearing masks, social distancing, etc. exactly leadership well contained outbreaks? Covid Fitness? neither confirm deny statement, say lot things (don't take I'm negative realistic) knuckleheads gonna knucklehead. ever learn Avoiding would know! Dude know trump bad. need every thread. Agree. seeing lower income areas hardest hit, groups folks may insurance probably cannot afford $40 vaccine (maybe X5 spouse kids). agree 100% vaccine want eradication way close 100% compliance vaccines take away every roadblock getting it. 

Also, healthcare always right- privilege. free UK? Hah...woops :) Thanks! makes seem worthwhile video would believe. country hot spots though really fair compare one province entire U.S compare worst state Canada also certain cannot know false positive rate PCR tests without widespread testing people certainly virus, proven method independent test (having solid gold standard).

Therefore, hardly surprising several papers illustrating irrational test results.

For example, already February health authority China‚Äôs Guangdong province reported people fully recovered illness blamed COVID-19, started test ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù [tested ‚Äúpositive‚Äù month later, paper published *Journal Medical Virology* showed 29 610 patients hospital Wuhan 3 6 test results flipped [‚Äúnegative‚Äù, ‚Äúpositive‚Äù third example study Singapore tests carried almost daily 18 patients majority went ‚Äúpositive‚Äù ‚Äúnegative‚Äù back ‚Äúpositive‚Äù least once, and[ five times one Wang Chen, president Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, conceded February PCR tests [*‚Äúonly 30 50 per cent Sin Hang Lee Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent l[etter WHO‚Äôs coronavirus team Anthony S. Fauci March 22, 2020, saying widely reported social media RT-qPCR \[Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR\] test kits used detect SARSCoV-2 RNA human specimens generating many false positive results sensitive enough detect real positive cases.‚Äù*

In words, even theoretically assume PCR tests really detect viral infection, tests would practically worthless. right! that's point. 

My point full shit. investments risk guarantee return profit. amount housing stock exist matter happens.

What people invested stock crashed? worked jobs closed? landlords special investments special guaranteed?

If landlord cannot pay share always opportunity sell property. Renters don't. come Mexican immigrants come live together cannot? We‚Äôve become soft. ability retire based much money give mega corps barely regulated?...

Haha sure, PCR useless masks dont work, hangin around reddit time working pre-fab texts.

How weather Sankt Petersburg, tovarich? ;-) OK, doctor. Thanks astute clinical opinion. can‚Äôt serious question. exactly scientifically rigorous, fun visual demonstration benefits masking distancing. [Researcher Rich Davis showed effective wearing mask simple experiment sneezing, coughing, talking singing agar dishes, without mask. results showed mask blocked virtually microbs. also showed effect distancing agar dishes placed 2 feet, 4 feet 6 feet away droplets. Consider death rate laggs behind cases.

It takes patients weeks show symptoms, get sick, die.

Without federal control boils to, feel nervous need stay home. like Jaws again. Lol. China going allow investigate jack shit. Bet it. always report number time. would issue. number show tomorrow‚Äôs report. ? Probably virus worse initially thought. high school anyone 97? latest 93'ers class 2012 would've been.

But right there's less differences 93 97 lets say 2000 baby need put cut somewhere cause everything's spectrum. visit r/zillennials discuss stuff like this. West coast... go! It‚Äôs bad think. go pretty large gym nobody wearing masks, people go social distancing done default 90% time people 10+ feet apart. say re-opening issue. said ""re-opening immediately"". agree need common sense restrictions place. I'm saying ""lock down"" maybe keep bars open zero social distance measures masks. cases go up, need scale public activities back compensate. proof all. would count. Pretty sure widely illegal Good. think people need see widespread is. bright idea NBA send players there. Lol. Good luck them. case blind leading clueless.

If outbreak traced concert, sued? absolutely pandemic February. actively avoiding testing, anyone paid attention could see that. state got first known infection January crying loud isolated, wear mask.

When close proximity people, do.

Is hard understand, deliberately obtuse? drive thru testing Illinois free. avocado toast fancy coffee proves point.

7 day moving average deaths FL level since May.

Meanwhile 7 day moving average daily cases increased 599 May 1st 1700+ June 15th.

So, numbers corresponded see
3x many deaths today May. 

But don‚Äôt.

And purposely used June 15, lag cases deaths. Since June 15th cases shot 6k per day.

That‚Äôs 10x May 1st. May 7 day average deaths 40.

So corresponded see 400 deaths per day next two weeks FL.

How wrong think number be? also examples helping. See far certain it'll ineffective.

Just declaring something work certain fix everything exactly recipe making progress. NBA playing games next month, can't NFL fall? problem consistency US, every group state things differently. ""If going lives, can't we"". Stats/Data thrown everyone following them. Answers:

So guess China allowing enter? One thing helps trying remember view US much like entire EU instead single entity. states far better - mostly one‚Äôs hit hardest earlier. 

Some facing real outbreaks due mix naive foolish leadership, misinformation rumors social media, human nature trouble seeming far away small locally previous months.

So really different stages pandemic depending American lives.

What I've noticed since moving NYC that, full people, city ""works"" everyone participates. creates real sense community rivals small rural town used live in. also find absolutely ridiculous is, every time wife goes regular monthly pregnancy checkup, 1 single visit, doctor (besides nurse checks vitals stuff), every single time, receive 6-7 different bills, pretty good health insurance. constantly dispute bills since we‚Äôve already prepaid whole thing. They‚Äôll continue send us bills calling us finally gets paid insurance. got VA quarterly check, get 4 bills, dispute argue covered VA since it‚Äôs VA requested checkups ‚ÄúAT VA HOSPITAL‚Äù, fax/email paperwork prove it‚Äôs indeed VA hospital visit. always takes months bills get adjusted cleared.

There's direct indirect revenues associated patient visitation.

The direct revenue stream easier understand. Visitors visit gift shots, eat cafeterias, purchase coffee, often inevitably inquire tools care team uses. might hospital beds, resistance bands, balance balls, walkers, etc.

But really revenue stream that's limited.

Indirectly, hospitals want patients feel safe positive experiences think hospital things like elective surgeries birth plans. 

We know that, example, new mom's rated experience less favorably partners could present birth children. hospital concerned new mothers contextualize birthing experience phrases, ""safety"" instead ""lonely"" they're concerned means hospital one consider again.

This, turn, means less patients.

The medical team countered obvious, ""no one want visit hospital constantly battling COVID outbreaks, either,"" responsibility prevention would using mask policy.

Also it‚Äôs dark less embarrassed post weight loss loose skin stretching. studio it‚Äôs vinyasa flow, it‚Äôs mix yoga poses almost like dance. better type group exercise. 
As heat; admit it‚Äôs fucking miserable started getting real nice post class high. Like pushing hard feel like going die got ‚Äúfuck comfort‚Äù attitude go afterwards feel amazing.
On side note suffered pretty traumatic abuse kid although I‚Äôve done tons therapy emotional healing happened class giving everything memory one worst beatings. talked 30yrs class, it‚Äôs hot, dark fucking exhausted middle class swear look mirror 5yrs old relived experience time adult mindset actually experienced emotion. cried rest class it‚Äôs dark hot sweaty music loud one could me. cried first time 20yrs. ptsd think episode life. It‚Äôs like someone took pain it. happened twice far. yeah it‚Äôs wonderfully healing. New Zealand take immigrants 40 (except rich ones going work). Canada point based system age 40 fewer points, plus need $10,000 per adult immigrate job waiting you. English speaking countries similar rules. 
I could probably get 2 year travel visa job, would allowed stay long term anywhere.

 Also, disability once, would prove would burden socialized medical system. 
It's easy leave unless retired self sufficient want live there. need work use medical social support system rules quite strict.  went back February although specifically document origins. I've learned stop engaging types people. learn lessons perspective. everyone homeless sit around gain perspective eachother -tenants landlords- together streets. 

But someone previous thread told I'm probably full shit. 

Plus person talking nonstop argues back change view wasted energy.

Edit: word already know best restaurants shops went 4th July. Celebrate America blowing piece it! think thinking bit industrially am.

We buy seeds neighbours gardening stores, stuff hardware stores. small shops markets closed lockdown hardware stores choice there. Ummm, testing Australia free... appointment required. GODS GREEN EARTH would CHARGE COVID-19 TESTING? /r/covid19positive want firsthand accounts people tested positive.

Local city state subreddits pretty good regarding local news virus. 

/r/COVID19_support emotional support. /r/COVID19 scientific discussion. Wouldn‚Äôt porn even safer option? time I'm super concerned taking attention away things like climate change going wait pandemic end. still think time get businesses, especially energy manufacturing, invest green upgrades alternatives. ""it would worth shutting production line this.. already shut down"" type situations, time. don‚Äôt hear anything leaders? It‚Äôs strategy stop thing. leadership. States took seriously got hit hard early. Michigan, NY, NJ, Conn, Mass, RI big numbers early, acted appropriately seeing something like 1% positivity rates testing. Ohio took seriously still seeing 5% positivity, though numbers creeping up. 

When states instituted strict policies, got control. states used ignorance weapon, states getting hammered now. article titled ‚ÄúYou still might get beach even it‚Äôs closed holiday,‚Äù doesn‚Äôt outright suggest going certain beaches, article‚Äôs intention clear. There‚Äôs enough vague language deny liability, intent one pretty obvious. close entire #2020 Well, doesn‚Äôt sound good. Hopefully find wtf happened cat bag stopping it. ideal world right, way things world. Unless everyone Board, aint shit gonna going right person knows price know *until they've seen everything done you.*

Even something simple sounding ""how much CT scan cost?"" something answer spot. There's multiple types CT scans, they're administered, medications like contrast given &amp; given, etc.

They **can't** tell much cost know **exactly** done. one's going ballpark either, turns ""wrong,"" well there's lawsuit hospital deal with. kinds people would buy property non-paying tenant kinds people non-paying tenant would want landlord. never said people garden right now. also say gardening stores close sold flowers... (how dumb would come think that...? Hmm)

As matter fact believe great idea. great idea going today, June 29th, state that's shut down, demanding garden stores opened like eating fresher foods (in months).

I talking complete lockdowns like Italy NYC, way talking shows picked presenting scenario reasonable leave something immediately critical survival. disingenuous 99% people claim would starve death without able go TODAY buy seeds sprouts.

Going grocery store something everyone do. can't grow everything yard. already there, grab produce can. Maybe get eat exactly things want every day. People literally dying. think that's important.

Why would want open another industry middle lockdown people homegrown veggies couple months now? Exposed workers trying keep food table could already partly eaten worms got first bite food *you* wanted. really amazing someone ""in biotech industry"" clue manufacturing happening alongside testing. Free Canada, yo... Ya gets looted could see happening. real news two hundred people going gym West Virginia. know right? think gave stroke that‚Äôs wrong. I‚Äôm native Floridian. watch many idiots ignore closures. wouldn‚Äôt surprised idiots state. got haircut. fine. 3 clients time. Mandatory masks. Temperature screening. Etc 


It probably safer going grocery store Idiots. DA use video evidence needed file charges without permission wimps. appreciate cool, thought-out response. mean you‚Äôve lifting general 4 months total lifting home? I‚Äôve lifting several years moment I‚Äôm trying lose weight. Working physical gym increases something called NEAT (Non-Exercise-Activity-Thermogenesis). Basically NEAT calories expend blinking, jitters, walking around, ETC. case, difference several hundred calories body fat % calorie intake calories make difference world. 

As assessed risk virus itself, point little 600 cases county far. I‚Äôm one states hasn‚Äôt explosion yet showing large increase cases/hospitalization/positivity rate. course gets worse I‚Äôll reassess potentially wear mask, right it‚Äôs nearly bad. hard time taking seriously. I‚Äôll admit never really paid attention Pandemic, began watching daily briefings January. first, fair weren‚Äôt really sure give concrete guidance. much uncertainty. became dreadfully incompetent neglected advise wearing masks; never debate! declare pandemic was, definition, already pandemic. soft. amount sack-stroking appease China January February absolutely asinine.

Mixed feelings.  So, let get straight. bunch young people, asymptomatic, testing positive coronavirus. group, even asymptomatic, would still 99% chance recovery. expect take fear mongering seriously? fuckin NOT? agree college pro football pressing ahead. seems like think covid respect game season. LOL Replaying 1 playing 2? still transfer surfaces via particles like spit such. Something common gym. Same. hate December March. least global warming, November early December bad anymore, late March usually getting okay. times, man....depressing.

The weather right awesome. Wish like time. friends furries, dont ignore fur suits. Hahaha! made Trying get Floridians listen like trying make cat sit. agree ultimately decision. mean everyone thing. That's happens convince general public better things possible. way America best healthcare. overall logic society better without luxuries? Well, hes still living city. 

Yes. Hence ""just move"" likely table. Glad finally caught up. good advice, that's contribute. Based OP's posts experience I'm guessing job openings his/her field scarce urban area live, non-existent rural areas, incredibely common. I'm assuming work, desired field and/or desired salary. things black white seem think are. closed spring break there'd lot less coronavirus concern indoor dining Europe, sure say there's vaccine. Unless mean way dealing it. Personally, even antibodies still many unknowns long immunity last protect you. keeping distance remaining vigilant hygiene measures seems like good safe habit build foreseeable future. disagree gyms. able go gym big impact physical mental well-being, turn exacerbate coronavirus symptoms. Maybe biased, think fist indoor spaces open Hopefully followers know gym reported it.  Demand freedom harm others see black mayor swinging tree. America we've made. Selfishness assholes far eye see. party. right. again, trying safe can, I'm willing sit inside 24/7 nothing next several months.

And IMO conversations need focused finding intermediate ground less binary virtue signaling. changing anybody's mind trying shame them, shutting ears creating foxholes. Leaving parents entirely cultural phenomenon zero bearing decision stay contribute household includes single mother.

We work together share expenses. Fully taking old age finishing studies enable live decent life. fair cared every need birth.  Completely different use cases. Remdesivir used much earlier, dexomethasone used severe cases. Probably $$$ made happen. Call cruel, really mind. Darwin rest give maybe 7-14 days. Covfefe19 USA! USA! universal health care today! constitution say force wear shirt shoes grocery store? I've always looked line cant find it... think it‚Äôs common misconception things opening it‚Äôs safe, it‚Äôs - people need work. seems like drinking alcohol leads people make dumb decisions ‚Äî someone research this. scientific basis stopping spread - sure person talking said that.. simply trying slow spread prep, quarantining ""flattening curve"", US public never chance feel pain countries like Italy felt, lead mass denial virus even real ""as bad doctors telling us"". Hence - even bigger problem looming ahead us, federal government little possible prevent complete catastrophe. 

Needless say, matter weeks away feeling pain - hope finally band together society instead continue toxic path division highlighted even protests (the message fully support). Deffinately not...I'm sure nothing best practices used educated people rioting Open everything! It‚Äôs boys! world split two halves - countries deal it, can't screwed.

Oh, little kind...

Some do,
Some don't,
Some can't,
  and
Some won't. Florida fucking shit show. Pay landlords directly? Life gamble, life insurance, terrible argument. Look graph stock market since inception. show graph decreased I‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs gamble. thought trump needs reelection legal protection. Otherwise I‚Äôd open theory  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs it. Let‚Äôs put idiotic life form misery‚Äù thought COVID tests free now? That's sad investments fail. Alex, say hello little friend. would say level traditional risk fairly low.
1. approved treatment proven work.
2. R&amp;D development costs recouped.

They pump 10 million doses week little investment - contract pharmas make well- sell every 5 10 pill pack 2-3 thousand dollars pop.

It's called minting money. super interesting. Thanks.

Space Force potential pretty cool.  stated lot eloquently I, exactly mind. Ehh lukewarm sushi best know dude‚Äôs T-shirt Texas full stars gotta admit looks like Texas full coronavirus. people refusing wear masks kind who‚Äôd dismiss patients video crisis actors. absolutely nothing said done convince people stand science ""losing freedom"" anything. Unless family gets sick, waste air. Ignorant Americans real, everywhere going is. still crazy reopen indoor dining. Sounds like forced take time process it.

In therapy I'm doing, lot stopping process feeling. brainspotting, neat.

I normally get flashbacks 2AM, letting cry accept awful, excuses, disables lot memories. things popping means brain trying deal express emotions; emotional part brain, uses imagery rather logical thought. Logical thought, thinking talking it, really translate part brain. 

Once sit feel it, flashbacks come less frequently stop carrying much weight.

You may benefit taking time alone feel, sans talking explaining. Nah lol. doesn‚Äôt explain asymmetry all. want bad things happen, care we're willing anything stop them. Apparently. was, also right decision Musicians, maybe... 

""Stars""? Nope. wear mask barber wear mask right? preached everyday wear mask stop spread. There's thing COVID-18 endemic precursor. Scotland here...

Our leaders told us silly selfish listened.

America's leaders told people silly selfish freedom.

This nothing point. vaccine, treatments mitigate risk get us back normal  shareholders answer to, can‚Äôt please.

Bad combo. suggests, would think.

That number really high even still. need grow backbone 

Typical redditor, stay safe space. Man find bit wild everyone's trying shift blame lack use masks. governments mistake attempting reopen way soon? economic reopening put complete halt right now, mandating masks gonna slow spread, might already late. like way describe going gym mask extra bonkers cam tolerate it? think *more* like authoritarian shithole? I'm means one ""reopen"" people surely there's middle ground insanely high cases people go concerts forcibly suppressing movement, welding fire escapes shut leaving people die homes.

Edit: apparently middle ground ""let everyone get covid"" ""weld emergency escapes shut"". Got it. Wow guys. Still means nothing unless donnie boy comes says Let clear up. protests. rights, exercising rights. pisses leaders still ready fine people large gathering ir going beach seemed concerned protests. society, cant pick choose laws rights want enforce good news, might inherently bad tell people. large groups people, especially USA think virus point immune. them, probably never it. Dont want seem like negative nate, Stupid Americans gonna Stupid  play victim one sentence tell others next? üëè fact opposite happened. looked like Bernie bag Coronavirus happened.

In Texas primary, majority voters said Coronavirus influenced decision. people said Coronavirus #1 issue, Biden voters nearly 2:1.

It's kinda ironic, Coronavirus highlighted healthcare problems America hurt candidate highlighted Coronavirus did. chances reverse course upcoming convention too? Masks far 100% effective, course. Gathering groups still reckless stupid, even masks, reason. nice tan least show go on. Exactly.

We're averaging 40,000 new cases day. I'd like fucking policy little comprehensive than, ""wear masks.""

It feels like everyone news talking points depending news source consume, meant go beat people head talking points.

This reframes conversation away failed political leadership onto masks.

We're given bandaid treat cancer diagnosis.

And lot people falling it. Face shield? 

Or maybe time choir. That‚Äôs also thing. There's vaccine types coronavirus cause colds either. But....Muh freedom? I'm sure people follow guidelines. complete joke healthcare system, even called that. They're contact tracing, yeah, would know. Boomers said back day.

Better way? still millions virus unknown us wonder keep finding China anywhere else world. Damn, WTF wrong USA healthcare system. going cost approx 70 USD India. Anotha one! sucks though people punished restaurants even opened. LOL Look employment 99% US under. 

You fired boss like color eyes reason all! Freedumb! 'Murcia!

Not mention Karen's getting fired acting camera lately. Ahhh fuck, forgot Alex Jones existed. Wow, you‚Äôve while! I‚Äôm really glad still ok sounds it! really appreciate sharing insight experience this! It‚Äôs refreshing hear someone like actually completely destroyed it! really hope ok wish good recovery! Best luck! necessarily. There's pressures so, long incubation period.

Generally viruses pressured become less deadly killing people faster spread. That's case COVID. takes week show symptoms (if going all), people live, even kills generally take weeks die -- plenty time spread matter scenario happens. there's pressure lower lethality.

That mean become less deadly reason, higher infectivity necessarily mean lower mortality. Locgh straight student tried help everyone big project, screwed royally, helping obvious/easy questions. worry wearing glad trapped island pandemic? Gotcha thanks little, late. Actions consequences- man get TV admit made wrong decision ask forgiveness millions people endangered. Telling facts boomers impossible task. They‚Äôve left us plethora bullshit. mention elect backwards fuck, non-progressive politicians (not mention stupid hell President now) literally pamper boomers retire. Also 12 deaths last Monday. 2 1 pandemics 2020 when? **taps out** want us that? People getting sick whether bs half-lockdowns not. sucks there‚Äôs simply nothing didnt ""ruin it"" anyone, anything saving lives people shouldnt eating inside restaurants right anyways. People seriously arent taking pandemic seriously enough Unless show real, trustworthy data contrary never able convince clubs bars trusted reopen properly without strict supervision dire penalties.

Some responsible, many won't. That's enough reason keep shut unless authorities spot checks shutting offenders. *INCLUDING* bars boonies. Nah outdoor only. Nothing indoors open rn eating drinking. Restaurants even little bit outside space, even town sidewalk, trying get many tables outside safely manage, 4. sad see trying make tbh NJ well want us start seeing spike reopened soon, *looking 46 states*.

I went restaurant outdoor tables last week owner happy there, kind heartbreaking. whole thing tough, think businesses. Yeah, us choice. They're advocating death. want out, unless count idiot population partying us Price chosen fair dice. Im hoping ok. Little bit worried restrictions lifted able get next 4 weeks spike think we'll really decent position. Maybe even virus free september It‚Äôs late least it‚Äôs something?

At least Atlanta area could impact test positive recover negative test two weeks, still get infect people said ""we told BLM protests transmit Covid"" patently false. article details doctors' acknowledgment protesters transmit virus, still advise wearing masks, keeping distance, etc. 

I'm sure issue here, Reopen protests shut either. protests allowed (as been) risky events pandemic. agree you, US def pressures expectations move (or sometimes kicked put) ASAP. would gladly live woth mother city needed care. Wow... never hand single cent wife's pregnancy, time, even coverage.  That's nuts. There‚Äôs practically 0 active cases Atlantic Canada atm dentist, type doctor performing highly variable procedures, able quote kinds prices willing ballpark yet medical doctors dealing planned procedures cannot?

How Epcot interesting? Sure, ""interesting"" living cave never encountered anything actually interesting. Jetblue middle rows blocked mandatory mask wearing (that actually enforced). Felt pretty safe, things considered Really, as? Hundreds thousands people maybe millions work industries shut foreseeable future. Hospitality shut down, events shut down, millions magic jobs? 

Remember lot people able collect dime run extra money almost brought even. annual pride parade march cancelled. Instead Queer Liberation March highlight injustices LGBTQ+ people color experience, even hands people look like them. tell, people wore masks congregate big crowds. 

Also, difference march equal rights live music show complete opposite ends spectrum justifying worth risk attend. Tell squat 3 plates small condo apartment bodyweight exercises I‚Äôll that. then, I‚Äôm going gym second opens here. weird. really miss sense unity. Seems may close things young people like do.....NOT Welcome reddit that, also like... many people going parties now, since cannot gather beach? they're parties congregating inside instead outside beach. def potential backfire, we'll see things play Beware. air coming mask wearing, going sides. test petri dishes place air comes mask, place mask, mask would empty mask would show growth(likely less though). Point is, masks work, demonstration IMO gives false conclusion masks stop almost virus particles air. Obviously front do, air gets masks places. parents send school.  first yes, back hospitals sufficient PPE. They're gonna move cruise ship guess. Agreed. city Chicago good places. suburbs chains kept cutting corners long really disappointing. Even nice places occasionally served cold food reminded heat stuff up. expect everything cooked order cost business gone up, quality food really gone down. testing important, [remove federal funding covid News... half US household stock.

Such stupid slanted meandering bullshit propaganda title.

Putting generations reason. Gen X gone THREE events.

However, women, one 30s 40s, allowed leave isolation site Auckland early visit dying parent capital, Wellington.

They made mistake allowed people leave quarantined area 14 day mark. Thus, new infection started spreading.

Its possible stop infection. requires coordinated efforts government people.

Thanks different perspective it! Guess really effects everyone differently. important stay safe. Glad turned ok!! Honestly I'm younger knew rest countrymen best ever that's literally deplorable. Reminds kids middle school would invade personal space ""funny"", kids came pencil trick: jab em get close. insane someone actively trying make people get infected easier. live small condo apartment outside space weight lifting. need gym else mental health creeps time low. still allowed isolation zone positive. likely spread others, we‚Äôll never know we‚Äôre testing small portion cases Great move applaud Florida. Fine anyone ignores closure No, get that, totally agree. DeSantis moron who's burying head sand, whole thing going result another spike. pointing state mandated closures bars, localities have. Enough places (unlikely, theoretically possible), overcome DeSantis' idiocy.  think he's suddenly getting worried re-election would suddenly say anything positive this? 0.05% fatality rate US, KNOW enough people tested. Pretty safe say rate far less given nice chunk people entirely asymptomatic experience major symptoms.


You're fear mongering. Actually give money people, hard? long countries screwed, everyone‚Äôs screwed. world can‚Äôt move forward closed boarders. like boss fight ""adds"" come in... get mobbed mini baddies, forced manage still fighting main boss. economy US unlikely recover long time. inevitable reality attendance apparent, doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs going. Trying distribute blame averts accountability Ragnar Lothbrok help you? wear indoors around people. There's guarantee always stay 6 feet apart alarm physical barrier forces maintian 6 feet apart.

Also 6 feet hard rule. suddenly step 5.99, mean get infected automatically.

General rule: house, car, sure go without mask. Outdoors exercising? comfortable mask, try best stay hell away others. still generally recommend people avoid public trails get overloaded people. exhaling running that's one favors run past even 6 feet away. Indoors store, public transit, put damn mask on. like aids dumb people wear condom (mask) oMG 200 potentially exposed? certainly alarming! next?? Direct stimulus keeping people poverty. one-pricetag-fits-all approach, going keep people losing homes apartments. 

When person paying $2500+/month residence, UBI close gap also working collecting unemployment checks. property, housing, rental markets still crash. Actually fact schools charge $50k per year makes perfectly legal. means lower priced option. lower priced options might legitimate case. correct. messed translation terminology even tried translate objective possible. Haha.. wonder netflix never answered subtitle testing job application. bother one bit people get wealthy, long also means live tent parking lot, eat shelters, shit bucket behind bush. Matt Taibbi thinks source ""monetizing anger;""; thus, greed. counties aren‚Äôt closing beaches. :( Mine free Belgium generally agree also causes trash pollution see lot disposable masks kinda thrown everywhere üôÑ

Generally think cultural problem regardless. use cloth disposable using disposable haven‚Äôt washed cloth mask. long roaches. course there‚Äôs numbers regarding who‚Äôs infected. day 5 exposed 24th. Sometimes takes 2 weeks get sick...then tested...then 2 weeks results, (depending WV testing.) exactly bad wearing mask? Defend yourself, coward. goes So-Cal greater LA lol  hospital use swab made Unicorn hair? aaaand. Stock market 530 points. Cirque du Soliel went bankrupt today too. Implying anything actual impact base's vote. There‚Äôs dozens us! DOZENS!!! considered US failed state moment trump chosen. 

Everything mean everything failed ( government wise). even consider US democracy believe US brink civil war.

I invite everybody change mind thought frightens me. change world know it.

China might align either Russia Europe.

If russia, Europe forced submission. 
If europe, ideals lost.

I think even biden elected, time so-called ""leftists"" clash so-called ""conservatives"". inevitable.

America lost requires Renaissance entirely. hundreds thousands coronaviruses cause common cold ever mutating can't really nailed vaccine. We're lucky new virus mutating slow well strains identified less lethal permanently deleted pieces genetic code. think uptick Benadryl sales lot anxiety allergies. I‚Äôm going lovely beaches of...Cleveland. Think I‚Äôll whole place myself. bit facetious said second understand severity 2008 collapse personal level. family owns construction business built new homes.

I'm really hoping current turn stock market normal cycle another complete collapse. convenience. mean cooking, easy stock stuff, particularly fresh meat produce go bad time get it. in-laws staying north. come winter anyway. lot neighbors way. still phase 3 test public use, skip military use. like using military phase 3 test. Governor Kelly done fantastic job. actually disagree first reading. Peter Lynch's books better beginner. Intelligent Investor imo better someone kind already feel investing wants solidify understanding it. Even Buffet's commentary, super dry read. open starts again. play yo yo dozen cases?

Watch hospitalized rate. whole reason lock downs stating obvious, still needs said. cant go run outside? Yup. It‚Äôs hotter rattlesnakes taint Texas. weren‚Äôt pool/lake, inside air conditioning. beaches crowded 36% unemployment right now. Another one? mean complete dearth data. data similar things affected people past, we're expecting one affect people similar way. That's ""fear mongering,"" that's using past data make reasonable guess future. Fellow Bay Area resident county providing free testing, appointments day. depend USA live. imagine would happen government declared food ""human right"" required grocery stores remain open let people take food need paid year?

That might go well short-term, would probably chaotic shitty. Food basic human right though, government spend SNAP, food stamps, etc. would easier cheaper cut middleman buy out/nationalize grocery store chains, though. know every state. would appreciate people decided wearing masks important though told was. thinking different bar? There's types stories different states. Makes sense roll back pack planes US continues lose control smash daily records nobody wants smash. Lol. I'm starting less frustrated upset trajectory. begged worked hard make sure first wave end quickly. Well, everybody. enough ruin hard work Mar-Apr Preaching choir. would go medical school knowing headed towards socialized medicine? know government never pay enough ever cover loans? can't even say, ""well they'll forgive loans eventually"" still make minimum payments minimum payments $450k got entire starting salary. Unpopular opinion, Indentured servitude slavery. Count cost making decision. consensus scientific sub appears multiple strains COVID-19 circulating higher lower fatality rates. Hundreds unimportant mutations (that affect virus functionality), one strain.

""Viruses, including SARS-CoV2, mutate time evidence yet mutation, including one read about, impacting severity disease. Florida fewer deaths virus hitting younger people better treatments.""

""I'm skeptical claims, coronavirus historically slow mutate verified report functional difference. long time ago speculation one strain may contagious (L strain vs strain) found one common other, think sampling bias. hundreds different strains still study reported clinical Dang really?
My trip Sept 28 still books. saw press release Hawaii preparing announce starting Aug 1, visitors come proof negative Covid test. I‚Äôm hoping get test keep trip. thinking beaches won‚Äôt crowded. Dry air virus friendly muggy air: problem logic people driving outbreaks adults responsible actions. protestors went wearing PPE protected fellow protestors. people watched protests TV decided protest masks abandon PPE fully responsible willfully ignorant set actions, act though actions natural consequence protests, logic doesnt hold. Lol. copycat likely. scapegoat. Netherlands: children dont contribute spread COVID, single one died they're likely get hit lightning die virus. Middle schools fully reopened 2 months without spike without social distancing. High schools get fully reopened fall without social distancing.

She'd send back work want us revise/rewrite (I use *we* 8yo still needed lot direction supervision learn new material teacher pushed time) everything due end day. mornings post day's work 9:30am. ""purpose"" weeks, prepwork me, facilitator-turned-teacher, days felt like blindfolded slog uncertainty.

We got report cards. new material made even show report. entire subject, needed prerequisite knowledge child even begin assignments, graded incomplete teacher ""didn't evidence learning"".

I also trying lead first-grader teacher's assignments, ""partner work"", attempting help 3yo independent stages potty training.

A lot parents kids younger 10 complete assignments year, even attempted all. shame, since vital age reinforce concepts kids work independently get later grades. Distance learning needs big tweak overhauled expectations (younger) kids might continuing learn fashion. Yeah is, real dumb shit like throwing everything shopping cart, store employees asked wear mask personally seen internet Netherlands. dumb people also Netherlands. Americans dont even passports Hell yeah --- 100%!

[archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/yJTaV) extreme economic collapse country

The, uh, jury's still one, might want hold 1-2 years declaring it. jinx it. People talk ""spoiled"" Millenials are, they've lived decade war, right came age work, economic collapse. facing another.

To honest, previous generation leaders really let Millenials irresponsible management economy, and, recently, pandemic. think misreading it. They're saying Tuesday larger-than-expected numbers combine two days' worth data. shouldn‚Äôt protests either right now. lot millenials finishing college entering job market great recession. perfect time start 401k. Cuyahoga county, Parma area rare see anyone mask.  kids 12 18 (i think highschool) start fall also without social distance eachother. need keep 1.5 meters teacher.

The rule social distance 12 18 longer needed starts first july. 
 Almost noone uses masks here, exept public transport, mandatory there. Doesnt seem seasonal. burn burn burn. physical distancing, hand washing mask wearing bring down. health organization charging anything $0 test.

In Minnesota, go CVS, tell test free enter health insurance info case. be. sure gets downvoted, pretty fair comment. Guess managed upset sides. also much change equation ""should go doctor"". Like, diseases, catching early best health, best health care system. quick dose antibiotics better week hospital everyone. symptoms something, know cost $400 go GP, go, think ""I could really use $400 something else"" hold gets really bad?

Like damn, upside this. lower less lab activity, number tests done. Virtually nowhere USA &lt;24 hour turnaround tests.

This Thursday-Saturday high days new cases. know. certainly wouldn‚Äôt go beach weekend literally laziest response local government spike didn‚Äôt come beach itself. won‚Äôt close restaurants real problem generate tax revenue beach doesn‚Äôt. people large indoor gatherings go restaurants pool parties. don‚Äôt think end helping all. I'd go far say American democracy died ago due voter suppression.  shit Yeah! Sometimes even us prison labor fight wildfires!  I've heard neurological damage like CFS, clear due severe Covid causing oxygen issues something else. hope momma 1 because, well, stupid said like 100 times better! Holy hell 50k semester criminal. get medical school ridiculous. I've noticing lot doctors who've graduated 2009 struggling financially, extra years medical school plus multiple years low paying residency allow enough years worked debt. mention interest alone 450k going least half making residency. 'Infrastructure' road on. also societal infrastructure broader sense, structures place keep people healthy, prosperous safe. 
 
But analogy works comes bad soil health: fertile soil infrastructure needs stay one piece become barren land.  
 
Barren minds void critical thinking bring country. going cause LOT upheaval reaches point.

I hope so. ""Going back normal"" good enough. Normal sucked. need revolutionary change. wake coronavirus pandemic, industries fallen far fast tourism. 

Taking snapshot tourism losses difficult, data changes quickly virus spreads. pandemic continues several months, [World Travel Tourism trade group representing major global travel companies, projects global loss 75 million jobs $2.1 trillion revenue. Losses come daily; April 2, British Airways reportedly poised [to suspend 36,000 travel industry among hardest hit. [U.S. Travel projects loss 4.6 million jobs May, figure likely increase. U.S. weekly jobless claims [skyrocketed stunning 6.6 doubling week far biggest spike half century.

And guess folks - AIN'T SWEDEN... countries also affected. would thunk that??? June

And combining studies clarified related studies mind. think fantastically helpful article. China precisely fear. Otherwise think would healthy, specially Middle Eastern Muslim countries. People 4th July generally considered day celebrate fun plane like beach. People normally aren‚Äôt regular beach-goers likely go beach holiday like 4th random day believe there's way knowing, cheers Ok, first read article see ""SARS vaccine bad"". read talking university texas showing mice still got lung damage lungs given vaccine exposed SARS. say anything bad reactions vaccine, ineffectiveness. tested 4 types vaccines couple reduced damage. also noted antibody responses. even tried injecting massive amounts vaccine mice mention side effects. Also mention testing mice may apply well testing primates humans. indicated back 2012 4 vaccines tested might effective stopping lung damage cautioned human testing. even mention tests showed strong responses animals check lung damage. 

The monkeys tested oxford test showed signs virus replication lungs. far I'm aware none people already given vaccine severe side effects. Also oxford expanding human testing Brazil south Africa. We'll definitely know works Brazil testing. Right...because two day‚Äôs worth numbers...not people sick? reality is, people going directly affected mentality change.  Worse: ketchup Florentine steak.

I shudder thought  people happy whole country becomes ghost town Correct. never begin with. Let‚Äôs take look five day forecast. Whoa- looks like we‚Äôll getting throttled yet half country keeps saying, ‚ÄúIf get it, get it.‚Äù duh  really underestimate packed beaches get big holidays. Thank you!

I swear states re-opened cheered week later cases didn‚Äôt surge clearly don‚Äôt understand even basic course virus takes infection. takes week two infection hospitalization, another week two hospitalization eventual death. 

Any measures take now, START see reflected data maybe 3-4 weeks best cases starting drop. Deaths won‚Äôt stop dropping another 5-6 weeks data based measures take TODAY. 

Southern states horrible summer, exacerbated fact everyone trying escape heat crowding indoors. We‚Äôre little concerned you‚Äôre rushing something serious here. Miami summer town. NEED summer dollars. 
You scream ‚Äúinfluenza,‚Äù people go, ‚Äúhuh? What?‚Äù yell COVID-19, got panic hands 4th July. burn quickly 

Spreading quickly. pretty much every epidemiologist saying February: less curve flattened people die quicker enough people antibodies suffocate spread, thus ending epidemy. Love username. Tocantins first season. Better letting everything fall apart. chart correct, first one fear mongering. know two weeks one correct. I've never heard someone getting flu shot every year ending hospital. Yeah, that's point...everyone take flu shot every year (barring medical conditions). Flu hospitalizations entirely preventable. pity.

That's actually bad way describing it. (actual, real) friends US I've known long time now. never awkward talking leaders, saying someone idiot.

But now... dude entire country. fuck? become increasingly evident legal system utter corrupt. police force insane. rampant racism sides. huge part population denying science. government torn split ever. Rising inequality income, nation already lead. elected person rule country, considered insanely inappropriate position, Danish media even bothered covering first half ""he's obviously going win"". goes break treaties agreements, piss alliances go back almost hundred years, praise dictators, commit obvious illegalities one anything about.

I even know say anymore, without sounding like I'm racking country. Like... really, what? can't say ""Your President moron"" anymore - problems become massive size numbers. Bad take. know people party wear mask, physical distance, going vacation, staying night friends, etc. one party president talking suck def one sided thing. Could lockdowns mass mitigation efforts actually cause less people get infected sick? way. Can't be. virus must decided suddenly slow around planet time virus particles hooked hivemind overbrain right. Nothing measures taken showing delayed results. Nothing all. truth. Look last 5 school shootings. sell stock due something happening life like car breaking needing new roof, right. sell stock need money quickly great way lose money stock market. can't understand it. People promised never forget 9/11 (and reason, dammit). everyone worked toward goal. country even went war that.

Then, virus already killed 100k people country people taking hoax using something simple face mask avoid killing people even courage act entitled ask wear mask stop virus killing more.

This country fucked... I‚Äôd say normal. Fingers crossed it‚Äôs negative result mean, yeah cancel it. pbc social distancing fairly well. Masks worn everywhere, noticed many violations trips grocery store. kid responsible think risk much higher anywhere else. irresponsible folks going create problem go back home. didn‚Äôt buy fresh food, could limit grocery trips month most.

...and... get fresh food? garden. plants come from? Gardening stores.

It means entirely different sector retail industry restart, completely re-open stores, send employees, get point. think impact: relatively minor reduction overall grocery store traffic, opening entire stores bringing dozens people make former happen?

And accuse bit myopic... Uh... that's death... States control borders thus interstate travel sense iirc. believe anger coming huge misunderstanding legal matters us really absolutely clue about, convoluted nightmare navigating. 

The problem individual state US individual rights, suddenly stop coronavirus. 

Regardless, coronavirus effect every aspect life everyone incredibly interesting see changes come result. Pardis Sabeti, computational biologist Harvard University Broad Institute, noted vast majority sequenced genomes come Europe, G variant first emerged, United States, infections thought introduced travelers Europe spread undetected weeks country shut down. could least partly explain appears dominant. Hurrrr durrrr hurrrr?


Sorry, thought spoke language you‚Äôd likely understand point. problem spread (to include infection deaths) primarily split along racial/social divide. allowed GOP push re-opening, knowing dis proportionally affect outside base demographic. hear talk sacrifice needed keep country open, economy strong, talking willing sacrifice others, better life. like slave owners old. This!!! Made day. need get rid lobbying, would good place start. Agreed, sides corrupt don‚Äôt care. Bro even Florida‚Äôs corrupted Health Department admitting contact tracer‚Äôs finding zero connection protests mostly coming people going club like nothing happening. whine cry want protestors showed need mask usage we‚Äôd fine open everything that‚Äôs outdoors. It‚Äôs reason Hong Kong protests short ago didnt cause spike it‚Äôs happening even states haven‚Äôt reopened bars

I dont say sarcastically, states referring to? dont know state bars closed spikes happening. Even foods cab provoke it!? Omg that's annoyingüò¨
It seems kinda sad easy humans feel like lords Nature, can't even cure thing like that. California fairly comprehensive shut too. citizens complied still complying. One extremely common symptoms recovered patient ongoing extreme fatigue. patients problems catching breath talking.

I understand desire see evidence now, myriad studies show outcomes happen sufficient evidence does.

We know frequency yet hope learn soon. real hero Jaws: secretary treasury criminal Steve Mnuchin enlarge balloon sees fit.  $13,000 vanguard fund. nothing I'd qualify insignificant terms discussion. made virus approximately 10 times infectious lab mutation seem lead worse outcomes patients. alter virus‚Äôs response antibodies patients variant, Choe said, suggesting vaccines developed based original version virus effective new strain.

This bad, horrifying. may actually help us achieve herd immunity among young people quicker. zero implications vaccine. Wow you‚Äôre well educated That‚Äôs good hear. Best luck. title misleading. saying 60% patients coronavirus patients 50. article actually says 60% coronavirus patients 50. Big difference. shirt shoes law thing actually, health code food store/eatery Sunday numbers. Mother approve! Yeah really shit, elections rigged gerrymandered there's accountability actually getting elected representatives come promises. really, it‚Äôs anti rhetoric seems started him. Also paying attention confirmed human human transmission 3 weeks notified virus long spread around world.

Please provide evidence point mental backflips. keep replying criticise belittle view never make attempt back own. confirms opinion nothing please provide evidence prove wrong. I'm never going able live comfortably fucking hate it. Really interested living roommates mom rest life. Maine thing remember people idiots, best stay away. another thread, much whining online school kids needing ""socialization."". No, need kids, families, school workers, grandparents safe. Education wait months. Little Kayley survive without common core math cases go back down. part life-changing pandemic people understand? fuck off. /r/lostgeneration would welcome open arms.

Boomers pulled ladder. put Betsy fuckin' DeVos charge student loan policy time closed bootstrap factories. 

It's like war children... tried getting bill goose? really want get it. Ketchup pizza I'm veeeeeeeery little reddit. saw subreddit today recommended top feed. try make look like anything. things happened. Scientist, news agencies, etc confirmed it. redditors become extremely anal proof, show them, 18 reasons proof count. I'm done :) China #1 :) ""you entitled, spoiled, delusional c\*nt""

looks like looked mirror writing post worked bar fight coworker allow people sitting bar area. many people building one time plenty free socially distant seating available, according him, people miss sitting bar. Fucking idiot Wow, many friends never recover alone. 

Entire lively hoods totally destroyed. kill her, surprised. literally mayor Jaws insisted beaches staying open, despite giant predatory shark swimming water. Victory! reopen state! Open mouth kissing new handshake! said people- SLOW TESTING PLEASE! Sorry. referring statement prior outrageous stunt madder people are, better him. Lol ok, odd surge cases prior protests then.

And checkmate? Lol Illinois fine! lived hole? That‚Äôs including alcohol, right? can't speak areas live (VA) we're ordered wear mask law public, law one thing; enforcing another...and latter little none live.  Lol BLM protest Belgium here, works, owners stand ground. parents restaurant, boy...it's kindergarden. removed 50% tables, use MANDATORY sign pigheads sanitizr hands entering. Luckily throw tantrum like Walmart respect it. reservations, max 4 people now, waiter mask, clean every chair/table service, installed plexi register. Also, take away call ready order 5 people next waiting. stand ground, communicate clearly works. Must say though Belgians easy going people easily get offended helps lot. NYC also distributing free face coverings parks almost 2 months ago. Cuomo provided great leadership throughout pandemic many ways, publicly calling masks months hate play devils advocate, actually exercising little overall body shape. MUCH many calories take everyday vs amount calories burn. Take someone dropped 30 pounds since last year; hard work happens kitchen top takeaway: UV lights powerful weapon fighting spread virus, indoor settings course.   2020: aggressively scribbling notes last part correct.

They intend never stop working. One day they'll keel it'll done. Odds even bad country it'll 65. Uh oh, coronavirus precaution protestors 2: electric boogaloo. thing Cuomo proactive try stuff could work proven work. Public transport disinfected request recognised transmision fomites less likely. operates precautionary principle let rip principle. Maybe time precaution proven right. prefer approach. tell aren‚Äôt sort thing serious hobby trying explain need equipment like talking wall. feel pretty safe knowing already please stay home, I‚Äôm sure far gym rural Ohio. say addicted, feels important me. Lifting really heavy stuff amazing stress relief. also establishes routine structure, going gym probably large part mental health regulars. definitely outweighs COVID risks me. Honestly Murphy run President next time option. handling pandemic better anyone, except maybe Cuomo. sure. lot dogs extremely shitty, like beagles experimentation puppy mills essentially industrial dog farming. We're pretty awful basically everything planet including ourselves. one best podcasts world... Can't get enough xD one 6 feet apart protests apparently ok Yup. we're back square 1.  lot even look like respect themselves. I've yet hear outdoor transmission significant source. 

It's obviously difficult prove, case tracking positive cases linked back indoor environment (work home often, bars shopping centers etc).

The open air ventilation good dilutant particles concentrate particles well. 

The spots might concern restos/bars toilets etc. fair, lot hot food really doesn‚Äôt travel well. either throw insulated container turn hot soggy mess, don‚Äôt turn cold congealed mess. There‚Äôs reason restaurants weren‚Äôt already big players take-out market. Going Upper East Side NYC feel like even outdoor dining people wayyyy close crowded. even hold breath bars people drinking outside. Shit horrible. This, ladies gents, brain fear porn agree. headline blaming bars doubt spreads even faster crowded bar, indoor restaurants seem safe. party spends least 30-60 minutes table, unmasked, enclosed space wait staff parties nearby. There's nothing magical 6ft separation, guideline ultimately comes exposure dose time. standing 6ft someone line minute two might ok, stationary 6ft infected person hour much worse e.g. reopened without stressing protection: masks, wash hands, social distancing. People went like clear, virus here! visit /r/CoronavirusAZ see utterly boned state is. Latest word street hospitals looking triage patients due lack resources. likely 30,000 range deaths Jan-March timeframe, opposed 2,500 reported.

Makes bit sense coz place dense there's way keep contained. feel like 30k still good outcome 2.5k bit ridiculous think anyone would believe that. Illinois one top states recovery, been? don‚Äôt be. would easy give govt money time crisis they‚Äôd rather let small businesses fail blame people Right? impossible, especially piece shit president Brazil right now. worst floods 80 years could last weeks, major natural disaster country. could reignite Coronavirus cases millions displaced, destroying massive amounts property already strained economy, shutting businesses, destroying crops, etc. three gorges dam also extreme duress questionable quality, shit hits fan thing breaks China deep deep shit. Closing tab make deadly virus go away. best aware store you, family, friends prepare!!! anyone else follow live-streams way back February? remember tuning every single time made announcements, especially interviews right team returned Wuhan. need find transcripts again, remember thinking was, ‚Äúyeah bunch crap, unfortunately ones able report source.‚Äù That‚Äôs back said contained COV19 risk West low, along statements turned wrong misleading. headline made want laugh, depressed groundhog-day sort way. Public ignore sheriff announce enforced LA following protocol long fucking protests. article basically said nothing implication previous comment traveling plane obviously much risk, part, least. see full space suit avoid suck ego put mask Translate scroll good sir. That‚Äôs want think. They‚Äôve sucking us years, know they‚Äôre doing. Ah, thanks! get feeling sub kids talking shit sure man, tell me. Maybe scroll every comment I‚Äôve made find out? AAP make whatever statement want right now. However, return school becomes driver pandemic, kids stay home - social development damned. We'll see.

I'm optimistic considering selfish jerks refuse mask now, certainly mask kids.

Kids past much worse things contend with. much adaptive resiliant give credit for. things could do. liked comment thread talked get creative injured get creative now. lawmakers see need change. coverage would worse ""the common man"".

Most lawmakers old need healthcare get. live major city unless talking 5 star restaurant spending anywhere near unless talking expensive meal serve plus expensive adult drink. 

It's like deliberately trying spend much. big balls. Seriously though getting laid 54 absolutely devastating 30 sucks. point, I'd probably tear dining room make entire restaurant outdoor area. air  could say Americans‚Äô Trust People understand this, money noticeable level. Sure technically buy $10 worth stocks whatever, budgeting $100 entertainment money whole month, realistic expect somebody that. sadly, think happen CA. Newsom reopened pressure.. even now, ordered bars counties close. ""May exposed"" applies business people go to. non-news story made sound big used big number, 200. finally found mask inside Trump's asshole, maybe stole Desantis' pair? Fauci's role give good advice. role give response team credibility.

Kind like Epoch Times 100% accurate reporting normal news build credibility comes Falun Gong claim cure AIDS.

Fauci may good intentions knows moment pushes back hard he'll get replaced.  I'm jealous countries right now. American... please come live you? known cure back April remember saw video seemed ‚Äúconspiracy-ish‚Äù mentioned Remdesivir known drug generally treat Covid Ageist much? want discard anyone 60- plan here? Murphy's law Hooray, finally! really going announce every time exposure? Kind moot point, no? use sending team investigate dogs crap yesterday.  surprise me. New Orleans hot enough unbearable outside, chance would eat drink outdoors. I'm sure many restaurants/bars indoor crowds. Use mask protects yourself.

I made masks with

* Material lab tested almost N95 filtration
* Design lab tested pass respirator fit test.

Then add goggles. Plastic face shield. protected three routes entry.

Also, check room filters. good enough filter this? so, keep one desk board.

Plus, know windows open classroom, do...open them. Open windows school policy. Outdoor air, good. Recycled indoor air, bad. forgot *that* governor. Projected cumulative infection 2 million. people saying higher? Cause seen anyone say higher that. knucklehead great PG-rated term dumbassedness. I‚Äôm Looking forward next [knowledge totally read title ""**Karen's** require..."" I've much internet guess.  #How abt rest July? No. said follow exact lockstep person you. allowed. harder reality cant close everything indefinitely long term solution. We're going come terms fact 1). going away 2). cant quarantine rest lives. 

A lot people want point EU sort model handling this. realistically ""solution"" fragile single tourist could kick whole new outbreak there. what? Back quarantine? 

People high risk need take measures stay safe, time show go on. CA wasted initial shutdown. Newsom kept it, would better shape. reopened soon. start over. 3-4 months hell. 

The worst yet come Pretty there‚Äôs still state two doesn‚Äôt seatbelt requirement laws. think NH one them.

Edit: consequence reducing federal funding highways. Much like increase drinking age 18 21 occurred. Louisiana‚Äôs highways still notoriously shit held long. Asking Americans selfish like asking fish wet. Yeah influencer exposing smart either. gotta willing protect others also decide ""well came way I'm already here,"" exuse put harm's way. smart. 6 feet thing sanitized weights thing honestly joke comes risk spread given huffing puffing coughing travel quite distance...but class size capping important part come basic symptoms screening someone comes in. think doable, risky, primary fear giving someone else dont know it. example lady friend healthy autoimmune disease mom mid-70s.

Time tell comes smaller gyms happens them. That's September. That's ridiculous. Imagine actually thinking trial Brazil somehow linked Britain's history colonialism. leads believe situation hospitals bad Arizona way governor would shut businesses bunch young asymptomatic carriers testing positive. asked snarky question lmao. 

A lot people lot opinions u singling for. Nobody credible, I‚Äôm using professional opinion help people sort fact sensationalized. send Barcelona instead. months late learning asymptomatic cases spread disease, too. Good thing he‚Äôs position consequence worthless piece human trash absolutely correct. Phase 3 trials going including Canada. Approving vaccine military speaks efficacy vaccine, China's intent using troops guinea pigs. Military budget $750 billion FYI  Navarre here. really hoping region would step things COVID spike, I‚Äôm getting tired keeping fingers crossed. Ugh. American hate America gib upvote got censored writing dorit0_garnish (with instead 0, spaces instead underscore) Trump learn Tulsa let convention postponed. Turnout lower wants another huge embarrassment reelection.

Actually, let convention continue embarrass Trump again.  stock market leading indicator, trying price expected happenings. Unemployment, wages, things affecting workers tend coincident lagging indicators. There‚Äôs disconnect many like claim‚Äîat least way like claim it. It‚Äôs affects pandemic, recession, etc work way economy. It‚Äôs like dominoes. wonder could ever property Florida doesn‚Äôt report hospitalizations they‚Äôre trying hide stats. ‚ÄúBro‚Äù read post? directly addresses yours. Things like traffic fatalities, significant contributing factor US, way 2020, likely dampen death toll somewhat. Disease related deaths may 2-3 times year, agree poster data date doesnt support speculation. Even see exponential increase cases, decline deaths seen later months covid despite ever increasing cases indicates medical community knows better treat covid patients, providing better outcomes. said, hospitals ever reach capacity, see explosion fatalities. federal government certainly actively working prepare second wave since administration loathe admit virus even still problem. result many deaths necessary. already know. EU, almost nowhere else New Zealand. Everywhere else incredibly huge, incredibly solvable problems. issue America love problems we're trying give rest world.

We live functioning society buy iPhones here. \+1 hell yeah! saying enough lately. HELL YEAH.

I wish best yours. There's almost always hope... people put forth effort make it. there's will, there's way. live St.Pete well refreshing going Publix weekend seeing every single person wearing mask. hope trend continue. really hope Hillsborough relax mask policy. really hard wearing one, point even notice (Sidenote: understand people medically difficult right impossible wear mask. small number people. Many people selfish medical condition stopping wearing mask) careful conflate something sinister (intentional reduction testing) versus benign (Sundays slow labs since people typically take weekends off). leaders U.S. certainly believe socialized healthcare themselves. seasonal, flu is. flu season ramps fall, slam hospitals even now. top that, colder weather drive people indoors compound spread covid further. thst right wing idiots always parrot shit heard fox news instead using brain. Cry pRotEsTs much want, us understand significant difference risking spread virus taking sunbath risking protesting beeing killed streets skin color. Charon electable official USA? evidence **intentionally lying**? Shocking news Americans, country for-profit business Yeah nothing enforced, thing matter government number essential workers exposed every day. food stamps charities; people going literally starve death without gardening stores way could without grocery stores.

I problem open restrictions like many stores... STATE LOCKDOWN. ""essential"" businesses run, open. That's big ethical worms safety continue phase 3.

Plus military mostly young fit, poor way look efficiency population whole. 

You want wide range ages health conditions. cells can‚Äôt stop infected. can‚Äôt even ‚Äúsee‚Äù virus infected cells. 

They able help clear virus quickly. it‚Äôs important point cross reactive cells Coronaviruses also make immune response SARS-COV-2 worse. immune system defaults using whatever memory cells making new response, cells weakly respond SARS-COV-2 aren‚Äôt great match might end worse nothing. Florida's government poor responce Covid, surge cases fault young people... joke. Gotcha. Yeah, CFR come 5.9 5.0. born 96, people know started using social media teens, idk Trump fucking up. I‚Äôve paying close attention since mid January. watched briefings almost every official national level briefing since. think I‚Äôve seen evidence need know opinion exists anti-trump regardless backflips took get there.

Like capitalistic version four stage strategy: Aftonbladet certainly better tabloids. type Omni reporting quite crappy. Expressen much worse though. Sometimes forget early states actually opened. recently got reminded Texas started reopening late April. LATE APRIL?!? 

They steady rising numbers started reopening. That's... supposed work all.  also know 18 turns 40 turns 200 really fast. I‚Äôm totally sold idea protesting now, sounds like protestors diligent wearing masks. Especially organizers, want see people masks.

What absolutely agree unmasked protestors firmly asked leave made feel excluded choose stay. Let hear body talk body talk According Worldometer, yesterday's case total 3,857 AZ. bullshit. Letting people get away treating employees like this... disgusting. Remind 3-4 weeks conversation. see Florida's numbers 'remain relatively constant'.  Looking DeSantis. deaths always lagged multiple reasons. First, comparing current case numbers New York early stages pandemic tricky since tests available time there. know countries testing adequately around (see Korea) time young people likely first group catch spread virus large scale due mobility. also patient group typically get severe symptoms, get symptoms related hyper-immune phase infection, occurs later initial respiratory phase infection greater variety symptoms. good example young Covid patients show ICU large vessel cerebral occlusions (massive strokes large blood vessels brain). That's condition affects young healthy people since alive long enough large enough blockage build enough clog largest blood vessels brains. run away clotting caused Covid create massive blood clots essentially produce results minutes. point being, younger people likely amongst first infected also less likely show hospital mass like older relatives, do, cases complicated fit stereotypical description Covid patient.

So expect see massive death wave two weeks group infected. also probably group people picked testing New York since reserving tests people actually presenting hospital severe condition. brings next phase.

After variable amount time depends localized things, like population density, poverty, familial living styles, ect, older generation starts contract virus younger people. could relatives, random people store, people work. really depends steps society taking proactively social isolate well characteristics society looking at. example, live somewhere financial support work home years, housing multigenerational started restricting movement young people bunch caught it, still see huge spike infections older people almost like sunk cost point. stop everyone leaving houses day, got situation bunch infected young people home unknowingly infecting older relatives. Due dragged course disease virus still huge crisis months even much spread virus outside clusters. basically happened Italy. point, expect see wave hospitalizations older people weeks.

This one scenario though. apply set different societies, like somewhere less multigenerational living, people age groups socially distancing public wearing masks. somewhere certain demographic groups impoverished others, embrace crowded living conditions likely working essential service jobs that, regardless age, require spend extended amounts time public.

There different factors affect virus hits, affects, affects them, pass to, who's likely become severely ill. got apply open minded approach community state whatever looking get good idea specific area's weak spots strengths are, ultimately determines course pandemic whether communities adequate capacity respond.

Tl;DR: Young people get first spread older people. two week delay hospitalizations matches accurately older patients. Initial testing earliest affected parts US, like New York, missed initial spread amongst younger people specifically showing hospitals droves. two week thing still good keep mind lot older people test positive, due bunch I'd reasons need rethink timeline looking entire society, starting true beginning large scale community transmittion there. one thing pandemic shown wife true colors certain people. contact list phone social media dropped significantly recent months. question would be: would say; Banner Health, charge patient treatment?

If one ""bill insurance $20k, because: profitability"" things, I'm going need much larger cut $200-$300. 

Not care patient. I'll damned I'm going supply bodily fluids asshole desk jockey Banner afford second boat. forth stage strategy: paid DLC.  undoubtedly dumb guy something dumb end spreading virus even further. many Fouth Julys population America dies out.

Starting last week new definition positives, ""debolmente positivi"". Literally ""weakly positives"", better translated ""barely positives"".

New procedures put place easing lockdown, specifically blood tests pre-hospitalization tests.

The blood testing procedure following: suspected positive blood tests quarantined get confirmation swab next day. negative ok positive quarantine 2 weeks pass two negative swabs.
In case hospitalization tested swab admitted hospitals become outbreaks like march.

After weeks turned swabs would come positives viral load extremely low (less 5000 RNA units per mL). comparison march units millions per mL.

Starting last week cases ""debolmente positivi"" follow different procedure.
Another swab performed next day. negative patient free go officially counted covid positive. positive (barely positive positive same) quarantined.

The big difference positive swab would automatically result 2 weeks isolation + 2 negative swabs required. barely positive result considered ""neutral"" result next day operation repeated. think one day:
06/26 cases: 8942
06/27 cases: 9585
06/28 cases: 8530 lucky nursing students safety aware. also small incoming group new students, 15 less half usual. landlord, plenty new applicants able willing pay. several vacancies February couldnt fill March-early May people really going out. flooded people looking apartments.

The fact money printed unreasonable levels means something going predictably rise, sure. people going make killing predicting that. ain't me. 
 
My wild guess things: (1) massive inflation devalues every dollar middle class holds bank (2) massive revenue loss means many small business fail (3) massive unemployment means far less people homes property value decreases bit, meaning money sunk property also lose. 
 
So all, middle class loses big, inequality grows. Now, one sink entire 401k betting ""inequality"" ? Whole package stupid crashing down. block people unable contribute discussion.

Blocked! One medical expert stated wore masks consistently correctly public next 5 years so, could eradicate novel coronavirus, seasonal influenza, common cold viruses, oral gonorrhea.  young people allowed/encouraged do?

Don't know surprised. adding 2-3 months determine safety? true vaccine. real determination safety vaccine years. something readily duplicated.

We take flu shot kids vaccinated normal schedule get vaccine probably soon can. But, completely understand 30 year old white male (whose chances dying this) rate safety issues getting vaccine. 65 year old, see would get vaccine soon possible. 42 year old Afro-American male diabetes, would guess would line early too. personal risk profiles. both? sure. want argue researchers methods, it. share exact concern however read done article presents.

But definitely clickbait. article title accurate. Anything necessary people survive open lockdown. garden luxury. sustainable, productive one, luxury. get food grocery store. People arguing want gardening stores considered essential, realize many dozens workers would come back risk lives that?

Right people unable get CANCER TREATMENTS cases ""essential"" stuff yet guys arguing gardening part that? Schools mandate Meanwhile, millions hidden virus colonies walking around inside stupid people across country. way worse back March things actually closed. jails infections happened short period time. well known epidemiological phenomenon called ""overshoot"", people infected herd immunity threshold would suggest. I'd say do:

2. universal health care, free education, workers protection

3. police robbing murder gang

4. accept rule International Court Justice, commit war crimes world, break international contracts agreements soon serve need anymore enough, believe emphatically Bush JR would handled pandemic grace competence current administration.

*Any* previous president would handled pandemic better Trump done.  great depression 47 million people lost jobs last months people need pay things like rent. Yep. it. People steel certain number new cases deaths reported every day. I'm Southeast city pretty good mask usage overall, rest state yelling ""faith fear!"" trying go life.

There closings, probably instituted individual-business city basis (""choice! scared, stay home!""). Several restaurants Atlanta closed, reopened, closed positive COVID results among staff. They'll probably reopen, close again. 

Schools open August, local systems pretending go back normal. We'll see long lasts. border, license plates IDs? 

Yes, way tell people Sweden, like country. 

As well, Swedes consider fine Danes enter country lift weights training center. 

It makes sense start policing Sweden allow people done earlier. Denmark done so, situation right now. Proper education problem need solve late. 

It would much easier educate Swedish governtment closed border nothing gain, things lose, closing border.

So allright, screw it? want us it? could always something like Norway enforce quarantine return.

The quarantaine ATM voluntary, yes think enforeced. hoping change enforced. tell people hobbies they're allowed allowed enjoy pandemic? lot people struggled shutdowns, getting high mighty *gardening* things reeks ""I'm better you"" type thinking.

The USA case increase started mid-June. It‚Äôs early tell what‚Äôs happening yet. know isn‚Äôt good situation. Beyond that, see speculation, informed otherwise. Undoubtedly, tourists packing city beaches weeks I'm sure look much different there. One silver lining, guess, FINALLY mandatory mask ordinance going place July 1st.

That's businesses operate. think would happen got airplane paid for? tried walk store something paid still get money, hey looks empty clean got way.

An empty apartment better occupied one paying rent.

Even better finding new tenant families go homeless something cannot control. Mass unemployment.

Yeah, government pay rent. simplest everyone job long enough applicants able pay either.

That‚Äôs bummer. hoping good news somewhere. Besides rare edge cases like yours, essential. Schools essential many kids depend school lunches reliable meal day? Tbh think even be, live somewhere populated enough gardening store going grocery store let's pretend Americans suddenly start wearing masks social distance vp said should. Breaking news didn‚Äôt anyone tell us?? Houston's (Harris county) latest trend friend.

And here's ranking US counties, per capita death rate:

 mean Morale lot death illness rate well. I‚Äôm sure would good patients see families long could find kind responsible way go it. Exactly right.

Pandemics expensive. get paying cost shutting down. still cost. pay hospital bailouts Medicaid claims saddle society lock down.

And Congress ability help states financially. Congress could lockdown give everyone minimum basic income.

Congress want to. States want to.

They'd rather us die quietly we've stopped useful. get grocery store, grocery store food isn‚Äôt healthy stuff goes harvest table minutes.

Also, less time spend crowded places like grocery stores right now, less chance catch spread Covid-19.

You could eat less, yes. Perhaps eat month right Covid goes away. maybe all. would reduce chances getting Covid substantially. 

You know also get food online, seeds. maybe close grocery stores well thing goes away.

And no, didn‚Äôt tools last year. rent tiller every year. don‚Äôt one. Plus ran things like compost fertilizer. Plus problems pests last year needed materials keep year. Plus needed fresh straw strawberry beds, carrots, etc. plus, really scaled garden year specifically wanted reduce exposure virus needed new tools.

That said, I'm getting married 25 days (small, outdoor, 50 person wedding) guests keeping asking situation like here. 2 weeks ago gave article well doing, ask I'll say idea. 25 days like eternity COVID era. crazy rapidly changing.

The ""World"" health organisation requires, much whole pandemic requires, cooperation, coordination communication. Without things fails World.

It individual governments leaders blame directing traffic. guy crows nest stating sees, Captain steer ship danger.

The majority developed countries prepared refused listen act.

When did, acted alone result pay USA dealing well.

There Pandemic Role-play training exercise time current administration took office, Pandemic Department, defunct, CDC funding drastically reduced etc.

In addition Twump cannot claim someone elses fault PPE cupboard bare took given 3.5 years fill it.

This WHO's fault, PPP (Piss Poor Performance/r) part leadership.

It's funny Fauci back camera again, defunct taskforce revival tour people suggesting Federally led response. 

Kinda late wish better guy charge, leading front people, rather PPP shafting behind. 1) there's lag time someone becomes confirmed case die. 2) There's huge impact fatalities hospital system becomes overloaded cases compared they're overloaded. 1500 cases day necessarily going fill hospitals, 10k day will. 3) Florida accused several times obfuscating hiding data fatalities, even report hospitalizations anymore AFAIK.

Florida #1 state question data. I'm still confident dire straights next two months consider every Floridian tested yesterday you‚Äôd likely 20-50k positive. Would change view fractional (incomplete) case count means?

What? Asia disagrees.

They recommending masks start. Nope, nothing agenda. quality reporting. Tabloids especially useful often report things msm avoids. often FORCE msm report things msm otherwise wouldn't. Italian American wife bad news, since planning go Italy stay next 6 months closer relatives. may able enter considering Italian passport, wife may not. Also, far know, checking residency country, since moved away 8 years ago, may also issue get Italy. Here's Arizona's case/death chart, 7-day averages. Looks pretty here's states ranked per capita deaths:

 currently middle pack, 22.09 deaths per 100k. mean, bank. Post armed guard door. Thank you, rather listen S√°mi council Swedish government. know bit stupid rather listen minority government foreign country, politicians, guys still treat us like shit racism S√°mi sadly still thing 2020 (and far tell, Swedish government pretends happening, we're ""foreign minority"") simplified description layman's article... 

Read answered last time wrote that.

There's another guy thread bothered read paper. external source data, think two seconds...

No contact tracing teams Latvia mathematical department. reminded live Florida put chairs front porch watch neighbors private show.

In Florida also applies porn. Naw, what'll happen credit get trashed &amp; nobody want rent you.

Your credit gets destroyed, lot good jobs become unavailable it.

So wind pushed fringes society bill can't pay off. think know rights are. thing called Constitution. gives us right assemble peacefully. People's rights end disagree Haha, damn, guess means get hopes release then. earn back almost everything ""lost"" poorly diversified.

If sold bottom - well, fault really it? Doggos trained detect virus!   THING.

If understand asymptomatic patients spread virus easily WTF else say? like rocket science.

Unless seriously believe infectious strains Ugh, sounds like basically south Florida couple weeks ago. need super spreader events bars private parties able match record setting pace. we've shown states, 'muricans responsible allowed shit like this. Yes, would assist smaller property owners. 

Currently bigger landowners given supersized credit, potential buyng property pennies dollar. Destroying smaller property owners. Why? Tests CVS supposedly free fault. They're great job, I'll tell /s guys living country something? come situation looks different another thread? 

Note: /s, genuinely curious. ""Woman criminally assaults bartender tried save life."" FTFY Don‚Äôt bother ain‚Äôt place informed scientific discussion, fear mongering throwing blame around. Go r/COVID19 actual info need figure educate business homes.

Rethink evaluate.

It new normal. 

Sometimes can't go back. Nothing insurance, based tax dependency status. read says november  Maybe, probably not: think evidence conclusive. conclusive NYC city state government get page Cuomo slow-walked shutdown, even though cluster another part state knew probably community spread NYC.

I know Cuomo puts good press conference performed better, can't ignore facts political biases. Maybe everyone allow lot pickup delivery options. Would create jobs deliverers also decreasing person-to-person interaction 


EDIT: Also, would also nice many people stupid I'm Scotland. people observe rules can't arsed. challenged grudgingly comply.

Nobody I've met thinks anything politics human rights. simply disease faster people scientists want, faster get back pub. tens thousands young people hospitalized, many potentially long term health problems, dying seems like good plan, sure not.

And define ""young"" plan. Nah collapsing way I‚Äôd say started really going Hell Bushes took charge. case forgotten let‚Äôs forget current war Middle East caused deaths Trump ever did, thanks Bushes.  That‚Äôs trucks uniforms red. Last Monday 2,926. True. Yea it‚Äôs pretty shitty restaurateurs entire service industry. However think public health trumps hope get creative. Yeah still infections. discussed right doesn‚Äôt really play conversation What‚Äôs point frozen head still need go doctor? come zero infections COVID-ward?

Hmmm... must magic, maybe proper PPE.

True reason Britain still hasnt enough medical system. US. aren‚Äôt testing enough take see multiply 10. That‚Äôs current estimate. life may worth billion dollars yourself, insurance companies government. There's cap much they'll spend you, since people insurance, drug prices set based they'll pay. get people construed consensus science. Empiricsm basically dead. Tesla called it. Scientists stuck theories models relation reality. see makes sense really 

The trouble drawing line people either side closest together 

I pleasure sitting mother‚Äôs knee listened dial connect haha 

Deee di de de da da deeeeeeeee

Something like haven‚Äôt seen anything close know vaccine exceptionally well really get lucky. Every government planet wants thing gone everything happen sooner rather later. I'm betting Southern Baptist.

Let check.

I win bet. --  They‚Äôre also highly adept propaganda. true.  Thanks u/bmc1010 \- Tommy here. great question, one enough people think ask. answer yes, economic condition connected belief misinformation conspiracy theories. Often connected sense powerlessness, often related low socioeconomic status. Explanations powerful way regaining sense control order.

But, mind, also important acknowledge us vulnerable misinformation. Assuming misinformation something affects others one psychological features make us vulnerable misinformation - there's even name it: [the third-person important acknowledge certain socioeconomic circumstances lead false belief, also look mirror think may fall misinformation too. It‚Äôs literally Sunday drop.  Yes specific situation matter? also knows situation people works with. ain't saying suggest he's saying. wrong. 

I not, dude. read huh. feel like ordering pizza, also call someone else who's hungry pizza instead of, Iunno, pizzeria?

A pizzeria pizzas mathematics department mathematics. Neither would expected Latvian contact tracing teams :) think people often fail realize luck plays part success. Learned prevent disasters looking high reward low risk circumstances help one lucky, there's guarantee. I'm american, I'm European, trump blame all...

So agree could suggested travel ban instead discouraging it? No, no, get it. virus knows hivemind agrees attacks detractors! smart virus, genius virus!!! We're fucked!!! well, got used demanding countries/organizations reform past decades clear, wondering months, seen long-term issues take years know full extent of? Time shop cheap houses soon  Correct hope comes door step shown courtesy. tenants pay, cannot get tenants door -BECAUSE ONE GETTING PAID- hope cannot survive join us streets. 

You utilities included rent sounds like problem contract. used incentive best times take away worst times burden fall tenant. sounds like whole premise argument, wanting burden fall tenant. denying, arguing going follow us, know one lives free pay bills.

This incredibly difficult time families right find appalling tearing eachother instead tearing system relief. Landlords get paid too, government provide relief. pay taxes. humans. tit tat carpeting hallway bullshit despicable. 


All hope everything dish gets served right back throat. Same, mainly saw old ppl wearing masks grocery store. Maybe want die... impression Canada fairly well. Active cases peaked new daily cases dropping steady WTF! give steroids shot serotonin. Incubation 2-14 days average 5 days.  Sadly, agree you. dont understand culture react event like 9/11 unity shared purpose. guess since virus can't seen, easy pass off. talking flu. Jfc. Idk many times say damn thing read Flu, example, hits people 3 days. get serious flu, you‚Äôre staying home instead going work. milder strains get opportunities infect people people go work gym etc., sicker individuals stay home. **During lockdown continued social distancing, NOBODY going work, people go necessities. top that, disease long incubation period, even severe strains spread.** maybe meant ""flaunting lack masks distance"" forgot word? clearly actually confused given knew exactly meant.

Not really time petty semantics. knew perfectly communicating, need flaunt vocabulary. bit disinformation scheme impressed thought clever. Probably stuff confirmed true yet. want pinned statement sure still idea.

And kinda explain mentioning significant: lot people head like completely controlled China Chinese pointing leadership direct duty western countries. Mortgage Backed Securities ( remember 2008? ) credit default swaps. go away. typical American fashion, jack shit. reversed 'critical thinking' interesting insight, thank you! Telling person something like might help crack open doors: ""- believe Earth flat critical thinking suggests mainstream idea brainwashed masses without proven facts?"" right wing loony like police. posted archive link could read it. also posted several paragraphs.

Here‚Äôs link posted archive Parts Florida suck, generalize whole state unfair. happened ""china got control, reacted like china did""? Hmmmm... inconsistencies, contradictory messaging across board part country mess dealing virus. social distancing capacity limits enforced things like restaurants nonessential retail stores, giant metal tube full recirculated air people sitting inches apart hours allowed operate 100% capacity?

States impose distancing rules restaurants inside borders. Airlines hand regulated federal government, asleep wheel since least January. Seems like wasn‚Äôt bartender theory. cases supposedly came Denmark 1 Uppsala 5 Norrbotten. case study. know California burden employer prove didn‚Äôt get job. many states like that. vote low lying island. people believe sea levels rising, since water now, fine altitude. Troll :) I‚Äôm healthy. won‚Äôt get me! can‚Äôt work home - don‚Äôt equipment! (Said fake exercise people can‚Äôt bothered look body weight exercises run place outside walk stairs jump rope home.) Hi u/JClimhazzardJ \- David here! think hit nail head there. researching book, found there's loads evidence showing drawn ""cognitively fluent"" information. Essentially, ease processing contributes ""truthiness"" statement - intuitive sense whether right wrong. authors one paper put it: ‚ÄúWhen thoughts flow smoothly, people nod along.‚Äù problem conspiracy theories designed simple, whereas facts something like pandemic complicated, that, ironically, makes feel less ""truthy"".

Simply adding image ease processing material, truthiness easy create - people attempting myth-bust fake news aware messaging family taken seriously early on.

If China worried people dying it‚Äôs serious.

This makes worry much going month. index funds 401k in? Tickers specifically? Stock market ones dipped 25% recovered now. Ie majority minus 5% range positive. result Americans resisting hospital.

I $2,000 deductible. can't afford get sick. crucifiction good people? anyone read actual article? Lol way without totally evil letting people die shut *properly*.

No idea going take happen, screwed. Turns position between

‚Äúdon‚Äôt use anything funded presented large company government everything produce, ever, evil harm you‚Äù

and

‚ÄúUse product regardless fact it‚Äôs shown harm good‚Äù could always get job poorer country, gain certifications such, apply country want job market better. know US expensive live in, especially considering jobs, pay well. I'm Millennial heading toward 40 soon. I've come accept half life wasted, there's nothing much it. still cant admit data show reduction fatalities infections? feel like best. let anyone try shame gaslight you. ways child get education socialization. situation deal public live parents, I'd avoid seeing things became less severe. She‚Äôs lying cunt. enough samples mutation family, six danish strain. Five norrbotten one uppsala making really silly claim denmark major source swedish cases. uk mutations far common.

It's hard tell, Swedes tests surely missed ton cases.

When 5 1 sample, guess many people could completely different strain maybe did't pick up.

But yeah, future pandemics super important understand spread pattern. demonstrate financial need, lower outright waive cost end. 5-day stint hospital years back came hair $50,000. co-insurance time capped 20% $5,000, whichever lower. fresh college, way hell kind money one nurses discharged told let bill call got it. ultimately waived $5,000, submit bank statements copy work's contract show paid. said, believe it? Half peasants cake all!

Out touch goddamn boomers. why, revolution comes, I'm saving them.  facts, readers:

NY state began implementing shutdown policies death toll still hundreds. lot people died virus still running course, would substantially worse already they'd waited much longer. is, weak federal response NY's bureaucratic inertia start could prevented even deaths response agile. no, wait ten thousand dead anything, they'd tens thousands now. point masks public starts panic hoarding, won‚Äôt enough frontline workers. Reading Taiwan‚Äôs management, controlled supply distribution masks right away, including rationing every citizen encourage use. Without strong state control highly sort commodity, end chaos. Singapore issued free cloth masks mandating use.

I know trying say stocking survival. without considerations impact rest society, unintended consequences. example toilet roll ‚Äúshortage‚Äù due hoarding lead higher use wipes, ending clogging sewage system. h1n1, pretty bad got flu vaccine next year. got flu anyway. get flu shot years others not. think great potential jobs come back. like said ""once over"". peak cases. think responsibility government pay every paycheck look us global crisis. That's is. many people going work straight dangerous. People work minimum wage tips forced risk lives others eat get haircuts whatever. It‚Äônot Amazingly said Yes, doesn‚Äôt apply citizens/residents Actually it‚Äôs screwed over. bet economy would tank mid February. put money it. Made good amount. saw US still jack shit mid March. bought shorts US stock. 

Mr. Jerome Powell decided print trillions bail irresponsible companies. mention prop stock market.

I figured. I‚Äôll buy shorts economy screwed least shorts well. economy well least I‚Äôll job.

But herp derp. Economy &amp; shorts got fudged. Yes, true. shutdowns March April, middle summer want go walk, hike, ride bike etc. 

I perfectly fine lockdowns place back then. But, virus still vaccine need learn live mask, social distancing, without public gathering etc. one case. Unless want shit never end.

Abandoning allies, constantly threatening mutual defense agreements, threatening trade wars whims, committing human rights abuses, exposing depth racial inequalities US. America still leader level confidence dropped. may lead multi-polar world US one powerful loses monopoly voice liberal democracies around world loses economic dominance. agree you, however heartening view masking right thing. lord Americans truly stupid country.

Oh, bigot take opposite approach wearing [funky beach. Irreverent Australian speedos repel multitudes FL beaches, thereby enforcing social distancing.

 Also, they're awesome open water swimming. Bonus. know history virus multiple countries around world major reason lag period case diagnosis resulting deaths. contributary factors major one, worth noting healthcare resource saturation significant factor mean time death (TTD) hence long lag period is.

**The key thing understand current situation US obvious data already late.** major mistake Uk government made Covid response UK biggest number deaths Europe despite pretty comprehensive lockdown still struggling contain it.

WHO, US US entities fund operation, didn‚Äôt label thing pandemic March, long China basically welded residents dormitories. 

You can't declare something pandemic pandemic. beginning March epidemic mostly focused Asia Europe. regions active community transmission cases.

But love 99% pictures saw peaceful protests wearing masks. I've seen plenty pictures masks. I've masks. credible?

Do think luck asian countries wear masks somehow control? think Pence would actually come tell people wear masks work.

Think else wrong life. Oof. means half Americans religious nuts Karens

The rest world evolve without Resistance what? Republicans run country. you‚Äôre basically sitting eachothers laps, yes cloth masks, case. apertures far large stop airborne viral particles, however viral particles airborne they're exhaled - carried microdroplets. Cloth masks act magnet droplets. droplets exhaled evaporate, leaving behind airborne droplet nuclei, cloth mask protect particles. However, *everyone* wears cloth masks, simply clouds airborne viral particles people inhale become infected. 

The fact Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, S. Korea managed avoid significant outbreaks, despite densely populated (Seoul 1.75x densely populated NYC FFS) high usage public transport, likely owed largely fact overwhelming majority people put masks public news outbreak broke.


Now, N95 mask, protect airborne virus laden droplet nuclei. cloth mask *with electrostatic HVAC filter insert* offer least **the degree protection N95 mask**, provided good seal around edges. Oh maybe. answering quite messages gets mixed :)

# Fired Miami Gardens Cop Arrested Charge Battery Pregnant Black Woman

üì∑[Nicholas news reporter Forbes, primarily covering U.S. South.Updated Jun 26, 2020, 10:27am EDT

## TOPLINE

A recently fired Miami Gardens police officer shown graphic video January holding knee pregnant Black woman‚Äôs neck tasing multiple times stomach arrested charged battery official misconduct, Miami-Dade State Attorney announced Thursday.

 

The officer, Jordy Yanes Martel, seen video dragging 33-year-old Safiya Satchell vehicle putting knee neck stunning twice Taser, Satchell screams. Except actors topic, made choose Bernie Ecclestone people reddit username? 2020 going referred future ""The Great Culling"" Well, black death killed 1/4 Europe.

I think experience made humans cautious pandemics. emergency laws states allow move things around state declared emergency. Declare emergency yes, move around funds. Still butt hurt getting asses kicked? long ago, get it. 
Blame young people? Really? many people work sick, dead, leaders wouldn‚Äôt wear mask all. shouldn‚Äôt high numbers stage, going helluva Fall/Winter don‚Äôt get vaccine cure.  

One worst presidencies ever history United States. absolutely quarantine arriving. insane US requiring even recommending quarantine international travellers. I'm sure live best. Idk, nurse post day saying know treat it. medicines thought effective not... vacuum tubes: sound perfectly like nano technology right getting downvoted hell it. simple fact US willing takes get rid virus (free massive testing, mandatory masks, involuntary contact tracing, lock people homes, seal border) even possible long-term. lockdown delayed inevitable US. Reddit likes pretend countries beaten thing around months. Island countries chance strict border control. seen single person Reddit call border control US. Even lie effectiveness prevent hoarding validates underlying assumption wearing one. turn one anti mask person? study right states 43% needed achieve herd immunity. peer reviewed submitted Science magazine, refused publish it. released statement. Confusing. see y‚Äôall VR!  borders money. knew half billionaire would fly anywhere customs part handled later. Thank GOODNESS!!! Keep OUT! I'm American btw. Sorry stupid, guys. Bingo. must it. real number must least double quadruple. Based past history PRC, providing factual correct information, highly likely numbers manupulated. *ye* ""It one thing employees feel ill disoriented wearing them, another boss can‚Äôt wear long without feeling faint, dizzy, needing rushed ER. "" would Trump make people stay home primary? said anything. parents built addition house. big bedroom/living room area, bathroom, dedicated AC. like small efficiency apartment. intended grandparents ever became infirm rather nursing home. thankfully ended living home died never moved it‚Äôs like really awesome space guests. Since loss sense seem sign neurological issue, sure could easily recovered from. Beaches packed every weekend SC. July 4th even yet. 

McMaster helped this, either. issued state emergency week ago briefing, got rid capacity limits stores reopened bowling alleys. He's sweet, sweet tourism industry $$$ two weeks since spike. count chickens they've hatched. It'd great death toll rise, ICUs starting fill that's bulk deaths come from. always excuse. Hand waive away costs, rather face music.

After Texas Florida decimated say thing next place flares up. matter many examples exist. Stop blaming society failings foreign boogeymen Send National Guard enforce whatever. really can‚Äôt see way point mandating masks public vaccine highly effective treatment here. Either shut again, shutting would completely destroy economy point unthinkable. talking 30%+ unemployment, millions starving homeless. actually shut March would place rest world leadership appallingly awful.

I hope - HOPE - see mask mandates. see New York work well. Yeah there‚Äôs way kind study could measure that. think mainly talking pneumonia damage lungs, pneumonia always taken long periods time recover from. Western PA inexplicably spared much outbreak. Nothing paid taxpayers, cost CARES Act borrowed money never repaid.

That‚Äôs actually guarantee. There‚Äôs way know getting PPP money. casually posted media bias chart recently. I‚Äôm sure didn‚Äôt click totally see discounting this. tested positive antibodies weeks ago, great advice! know they're able use blood specifically help patients Covid? Ever wonder people cults don‚Äôt see lives fucking crazy? don‚Äôt quite get either, that‚Äôs is. required to. second grade up, IIRC. Good point. Yeah, too. Several. never called ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù labs - consider NIH CDC ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù labs. 

In training scientist taught provide evidence claims instead lobbing ad hominem attacks. source claim drugs developed ‚Äúgovernment‚Äù labs going hurl insults spout myths? going get interesting Ironically, one charge World Health Organization doctor politician. keep living denial problem becomes big deal with. really prefer cure problem prevent happening first place. Ironically, one charge World Health Organization doctor politician. also whats needed attain herd immunity....whats alternative? Seriously....I keep waiting hear serious answer this. can't live way forever pray vaccine. Life go on. annoying bot, FYI. He‚Äôs bro, don‚Äôt get caught listening tall tales wife‚Äôs district south Florida. Hi, dangerous consider Valtrex? Idk it‚Äôs coincidence feel high energy today. 

I also don‚Äôt want hurt liver taking pill everyday. already take Vyvanse everyday. 

I try take lot vitamins supplements eat organic. Clear answer, thank you! flu joke. 

That said, deaths diagnosed flu drawn estimates excess deaths on, typically long time flu season finished.

Most 500k deaths confirmed diagnosed cases measured outbreak. excess death rate likely already significantly higher ""a bad flu season"" significant lockdown social distancing measures across world. clearly much worse regular seasonal flu. nowhere near over. some, harder sympathize thousands deaths single death. key‚Äôs. That‚Äôs fucking point mate. I‚Äôm making conclusions, pointing studies discussing inconclusive ends spectrum.

How comfortable making dietary guidelines based data aren‚Äôt statistically significant? would nice discouraged downplayed need masks everyone. Agreed, point time blame. blame president, blame governor, blame mayor. Youve seen Europe burn, scientists TV *daily* warning you, evidence front eyes. Play stupid games win stupid prizes limited experience Floridians....they like stupid games. So... lockdowns late March obviously work seeing much dire situation now. sure Florida Texas going hit like NYC. average age gone way down, severe cases go well. Also probably less cases overall, took NY ramp testing, Florida Texas starting better place regards. Lastly treatment gotten better. rather get 3 months ago. course rather get 3 months could cause knows better treatment might month away. try find way compliment every kid see supermarket wearing mask properly. glad kids old enough fully understand, hopefully kids compliment kind responsible caring others get buzz even compliant future. Yeah, hit hardest, beginning. implemented strong restrictions, result virus well control spread diminishing greatly, opposed states nothing, opposite happening. Look data yourself, freely available. really think hit nail head. coal miners. expensive. really puzzling me. easily put ""Trump 2020"" MAGA style mask use pump mask compliance re-election odds time. Looks like non-brainer decision me. 

Instead resorted bleach crazy shit. track hospitalization trends. study flawed:

[Scientists Fix Errors Controversial Paper Saturated ""The authors took one study omega-3 fats, one type unsaturated fat, show slightly negative effect while, fact, shown strong positive effect. correction means meta-analysis says people report eating lots particular fat significantly less heart disease; previously, said significant effect.""

* Critics also pointed two important studies omega-6 fatty acids authors missed.

* address people reduced intake saturated fats consumed instead. 2009 review concluded replacing saturated fats carbohydrates benefit, replacing polyunsaturated fats reduced risk heart disease. Yes lol

Not defending anything.  choose believe exist. there's nothing early imo. time low would zero. Boy someone told before! noticed lot ""We're Hiring"" signs... think he's actually going lose? overestimating power racism bigotry dude. make america great "" "" --- like look back forward- ""coal future "" Haha ok pizzagate man.

Not saying parent commenter go out. maintain lot distance. can't confident caught covid. I'm sure every country telling people snap n95 mask they're much better. spend two hours watching contagion figure thing going problem Self-pity. first rule NPD always victim. second rule NPD talk unfair is. They‚Äôll dump mayors shoulders pretend it‚Äôs none responsibility. put ""may"" title? did, ""may"" it. Okay like think way. tf gonna spend time coronavirus poll, someone invested safety virus, someone wearing mask gaf. opinionated poll.  idiots barely graduated high school small town say bullshit. Man, supposed believe???? There‚Äôs reasons administrators.  Regulations need obeyed.  Complaining parents need talk someone. Lawsuits headed dealt with. black person white person look quite different, die shoot head. matter European Asian strain, covid19 still die antibodies way. normalised now. Sure, home day, going out, things, learning tolerate feel mask. He's thinking immigrant caravans. Lol. Nah, I'm concerned. Remember wisdom able change faced overwhelming evidence. used hard time that. looks like groupthink, whatever feel like calling it, there's ton evidence believe it. whole world got team shit. Seems like would rather burn down. Considering admits lying effectiveness masks months ago, he, CDC honestly resign replaced competent people. move contributed destroying trust medical establishment, led full rebellion wearing masks social distancing many circles. Dude NY still highest death count country, mainly Cuomos blunders, know right? bit premature bragging NY dont think? would probably better job trump honest. physically space, operate ambulance?

But still questions order, followed, result misdemeanor offense individuals fines businesses comply""

Gov. McMaster enough... Thanks. It‚Äôs good know people still persuaded sound logical arguments beholden political tribalism. Good points! think much needless deaths lied masks. I‚Äôd agree assessment based data snapshots alone taking general state public‚Äôs distancing mask fatigue (which honestly take long develop), I‚Äôm inclined think point moving forward, would lean toward much worse outlook believe population has: become divided following medical precautions based political lines, people expanded isolation include ‚Äúsocial bubbles‚Äù - overlap way helps spread infection - general feeling business socialization outweigh isolation protection. don‚Äôt think people gotten scared disease sufficiently act accordingly. Cook county anywhere near ""cultural south""

Your closed minded bigotry showing think non southerner would defend south ignorance ‚ÄúEvery disaster movie begins people power listening scientist.‚Äù think so. could step down, defect Russia wherever hell wants leave Pence charge really wanted done.

Finally, children old enough care themselves, really prudent leave alone school day? know mischief latchkey kids got 80's 90's left unsupervised hours school whole school day!

Lastly, taxpayers town? paying property taxes children school five days per week. two three. paying less property taxes then?

Increased cases says fucking lie.  also never really properly shut down. Feels like Abbott mumbled word back April, Patrick told us die economy are. cases rising. unless Louisiana shuts bars/restaurants/other stuff, it'll back big league matter RemindMe! 4 months

RemindMe! 4 months nothing politics... De Santis self serving @$$ shameful poorly managed this. mean? hasn‚Äôt really significant link protests outbreaks, especially compared coronavirus outbreaks states reopening (like home state NC)

Some great links lots another article read today Vitamin expound, 70% would nobody natural resistance (which true) literally one changed behavior way (which happens).

In real world, yet see virus surpass 25% large area We're dire situation people went right back acting like everything normal lockdowns ended rather continuing maintain proper social distancing protocols, things taking worse many people pretended like COVID even exist anymore, whereas pre-lockdown many people least somewhat cautious. agree good use we've learned make things safer, sounds like making assumptions drawing conclusions state safe fact rather presenting data back up. No, totally understand. teacher itching get back classroom. teach low-income neighborhood know kids need school education. But, virus tricky.

Oh homie stance going age poorly New York kind lockdowns even heyday pandemic. never restricted inter-state travel, NJ royally fucked. 

And made think states even strict lockdowns NY did? people going scream lockdowns killed economy. No, didn‚Äôt. Even half country take seriously, you‚Äôre looking half country traveling, eating out, basically exactly we‚Äôre mandated now. Almost 1/10th Florida‚Äôs revenue tax tourists 750k directly employed tourism industry.

I'm right Also refuse admit used logical fallacies

Which logical fallacy use? Identify Well would love reasoned debate

You started debate saying would kill people would disagree you. lying. Lack education- I‚Äôd say there‚Äôs fair chance I‚Äôm probably well educated actually.

You clearly end another ad hominem

Yup. gave reasonable conversation kept insulting me. decided return favor.

You intelligent enough keep up, I'm done. I'm sure takes donations online this. yeah, cheese $2/lb, meat probably $3-5/lb unless using high quality stuff, flour dice tomatoes cheap perishable bought big quantities.

I remember going costco business seeing legs prosciutto like $7-8/lb blown away. choice clear, one man fit run 2020 presidency, true American prototype.

AND NAME JOHN CENA!!! fear mongering, fact antibody tests arent good. also fact CDC stated reinfection possible likely. Fuck right want research you. clearly internet use it...or dont guidelines schools AZ ridiculous. Implementing would require schools build new buildings, acquire new busses, hire WAY staff appropriately implement. 

That‚Äôs state says they‚Äôre ‚Äúguidelines.‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚Äúup school district‚Äù implement can/want.

One best friends teacher largest district state. It‚Äôs interesting hear take thinks happen school. 

I think going see lot online learning. I‚Äôm American expat Spain, 6 years live/work life completely fluent Spanish, many people say don‚Äôt even accent. 

I infected March shit completely hitting fan Barcelona Madrid, like entire knowledge Spanish drained brain. much, much harder formulate ideas thoughts express things Spanish partner, understandably concerned. Never brain fog like life. Interesting strategy! sampling works best large population infection rate believed low. working small group, pool testing isn‚Äôt necessary. working large group suspect many people positive, it‚Äôs helpful group together, many samples retested individually.

Much Sun Belt (South / Southwest) may far gone large scale pool testing, may help parts country like New York registering 1% rest positivity (an incredible achievement). think do, shut again? Also stupid end long term lung damage recovering. "" reported Critically ill patients. ""

With due respect that's overstatement, yes commonly seen ICU elderly patients several studies documenting finding, found T-cell reduction even patients without severe illness. 

 

It's fine inveigh overdone headlines favours going extreme. correct answer critical illness undoubtedly increases risk T-cell reduction immune impairment finding limited alone, appears somewhere all, enough information yet sure. American sue Fox News destruction caused??? pretty evident spread outdoors easily all. Boardwalks beaches packed NJ quite awhile studies showing outdoor spreading hard come by, even crowds Consider China one significant spreading event(beijing) last 3 months, think worked quite well. US states issue. getting point, ditto NYC area (NY, NJ CT).

We went lot pain things control, rest country gone hell handbasket. roughly zero appetite let people Arizona Florida people come fuck force us back full quarantine.

It quite interesting lot clamoring lock border rest US. would be... interesting, given implications. Yet, ""clean states America"" join new cases per million drop 10 something. yet, trajectory promising. reasonable people (that wearing masks back February orders) rush take fastest produced vaccine history. Trump: ‚Äúwhy can‚Äôt let wash country‚Äù Lol available EU. keep news virus yourself... working hypothesis protests large, unusual, visible, highly reported events. makes seem natural point fingers we're trying explain spikes. many people comments kneejerk responding ""this feels like bullshit"" they're operating assumption, taking minute think protests fit daily city life.

Very people protesting every single day. Many people go protests immediately self-isolate afterwards. see big gatherings instinctively think, ""that cause!""

When really single cause. observing states strong coronavirus response general (longer lockdowns, slower reopenings, widespread mask-wearing) decreasing cases, seen NY's numbers. suspect because, protest cities, participants go home, obey lockdown orders, wear masks, take preventative measures - that's normal them. side, places reopened early, likely protestors, like general population areas, take adequate measures prevent spread.

In words, protests places high risk exposure, areas virus better controlled, escalate super-spreader events. suggests single biggest contributing factor coronavirus spikes local government's response! makes intuitive sense, too: government policies affect day day life citizens. Aaand said, vast majority people, protesting daily activity takes relatively small proportion time.

I also think protestors general conscientious potential coronavirus spread take precautions general public...but really that's important city's existing policies culture regarding COVID. Third World War end, shock. state scientific research pretty much impairs memory using go back normal quit. kill brain cells lasting damage. AFAIK mainstream recreational drugs neurotoxic alcohol, MDMA, meth, possibly amphetamine although I'm clear one. testing, that‚Äôs also true. Ohio‚Äôs percent positive rate remaining ~5%. lot people going Myrtle Beach Florida vacation. It‚Äôs matter time things get worse. Rheumatic fever cause porcelain heart way line. heart calcifies hardens. That's grandma died. fever contracted age five. Pretty crazy That‚Äôs fair.

But hospitalizations going fast happen get overwhelmed could horrible. Funny, ALSO happened Tennessee. chances? happened? protests? cases people 35...seems like must connection. many millions would say joined crowded protests past month? down. fuck you? much make work for? seems cases ‚Äúreinfection‚Äù emerging care admit, testing positive months after. Right classified relapses. That's like even close works 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, blessed CouldWouldShouldBot! think big problem reopening people act honestly. 

This. many people thought lockdown lifted, back normal. return normal least another year year-and-a-half. 

Even things open, people need wear masks, wash hands, stay 6+ feet away, avoid 99% indoor spaces that's home grocery store. well though mature comment.

In early March Health + Hospitals' Elmhurst, Dr. Chad Meyers colleagues emergency room worried missing community spread Covid-19. called city‚Äôs health department get patients tested, rejected testing even many patients satisfied criteria, Dr. Meyers said, leading ‚Äúoften protracted unproductive calls‚Äù department.

Hospital, city state officials said relying federal government testing capability limited criteria set Centers Disease Control Prevention could test. Jason McDonald, CDC spokesman, said: ‚ÄúCDC testing guidance always allowed clinical discretion. So, set guidelines, states health-care providers flexibility determine test.‚Äù

In April interview, Health + Hospitals Chief Executive Mitchell Katz said system prepared best could, given difficulties building additional space already-full hospitals. May 15 city-council meeting, said acted quicker.

While leaders states like California Ohio acted quickly contain spread, Messrs. Cuomo de Blasio delayed taking measures close state city even number cases swelled, despite warnings doctors, nurses schoolteachers. California issued statewide lockdown 1,005 cases March 19, New York remained open 5,704 cases, according updated Johns Hopkins data.

Even New York announced first coronavirus case March 1, city health department advising New Yorkers likely get flu. ‚ÄúI speak mayor also one‚Äîwe think best health-care system planet,‚Äù Mr. Cuomo said March 2 news conference.

Five days later, Mr. Cuomo declared state emergency, medical emergency-response experts worried city state administrations still weren‚Äôt taking matters seriously enough.

Richard Serino, adviser city former deputy administrator Federal Emergency Management Agency, told senior aide Mr. de Blasio early March 13 ‚Äúconcerned cavalier attitude hospital community‚Äù city, especially compared cities like Boston, according email. Officials city‚Äôs emergency-management agency agreed, according people familiar matter. Mr. Serino April said didn‚Äôt recall email praised city‚Äôs response.

March 13 became turning point became clear community spread one man New York City suburb. city went planning future crisis responding one already there. Two days later, Mr. de Blasio said known New York City cases already ballooned past 300, reluctantly closed schools. Los Angeles closed schools around time 50 cases, according Johns Hopkins data.

By March 20, ICU Northwell Health system‚Äôs Long Island Jewish Medical Center Queens overflowing, Health + Hospitals' Elmhurst borrow ventilators sister hospital keep up, Journal reported month. governor ordered New York put quarantine two days later.

On March 23, Mr. Cuomo ordered hospitals increase capacity treat Covid-19 50%, anticipating need 140,000 new beds. hospital executives asked would get staffing, beds protective gear, state officials told ‚Äúdo best,‚Äù said hospital executive familiar conversation.

Ms. Lever, governor‚Äôs spokeswoman, said state offered every hospital access 90,000 volunteer health-care workers central inventory system resources equipment needed fight virus.

Once realized widespread virus become, Messrs. Cuomo de Blasio sparred President Trump procure equipment sought creative ways jump-start ventilator production. frank gravity illness daily public briefings, Mr. Cuomo‚Äôs job-performance rating soared. Mr. de Blasio focused inequities within city, establishing food program, providing meals city schools using out-of-work taxi for-hire vehicle drivers make deliveries homebound residents.

Among missteps would make matters worse mid-March, health-care workers said, government officials hospital administrators failed create adequate plans provide needed staff expanded beds operating theaters, old auditoriums lobbies.

‚ÄúCreating beds isn‚Äôt difficult thing,‚Äù said Northwell CEO Michael Dowling. ‚ÄúThe issues get complicated creation beds staffing. isn‚Äôt like put staff bed place.‚Äù

The crisis would eventually peak nearly 19,000 hospitalizations, even number overloaded system.

As Covid-19 patients flooded NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, private hospital created new pop-up ICUs. inadequacy staffing levels quickly became clear one operating-room-turned-ICU, according medical staff emails residents sent attending physicians. Garbage makeshift 80-bed unit overflowed contaminated needles, masks gowns. Urine blood stains times found ground equipment, according workers emails.

‚ÄúThe scope patient needs compared training resources available presented absolute crisis,‚Äù said Julia Symborski, nurse worked new ICU. ‚ÄúYou magically make ICU appear, can‚Äôt make staff appear immediately.‚Äù

A NewYork-Presbyterian spokeswoman, Kate Spaziani, defended hospital system‚Äôs response ‚Äúunprecedented challenges, many anticipated, others unexpected.‚Äù

Across New York, hospitals sometimes mismanaged staff slow staff additional critical-care nurses key respiratory therapists manage growing number patients ventilators, dozens front-line workers said.

It isn‚Äôt weren‚Äôt staff available nationwide: Brian Cleary, CEO Krucial Staffing, agency Health + Hospitals tapped send 4,000 medical staff crisis, said could sent 6,000 ‚Äúwithout blinking.‚Äù

A Health + Hospitals spokeswoman said hospital began securing additional staffing early January Krucial ‚Äúdoes encompass full scope assistance sought outside groups.‚Äù

In cases, available doctors trained critical-care nurses said hospitals failed reduce bureaucracy get quickly. Chelsea Walsh, traveling nurse Hawaii, said red tape NewYork-Presbyterian‚Äîincluding request take drug test‚Äîdiscouraged working there, took shifts elsewhere city. ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt work hospital middle crisis wanted paperwork help save someone‚Äôs life. paperwork administration‚Äôs rules delayed lot care.‚Äù

While travel nurses arrived Bellevue locations, ‚Äúa lot experience whatsoever,‚Äù said Laura Jaramillo, Bellevue ER nurse. spend time training also juggling patient care.

The Health + Hospitals spokeswoman said new staffers ‚Äúformally trained cover areas posted in.‚Äù

In new operating-room ICU NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia, one respiratory therapist times cared 80 patients shift, according workers emails; seeing 10 shift typical normal times, respiratory therapists said. Overworked staffers weren‚Äôt able suction mucus patients‚Äô lungs often enough, resulting patient complications, according workers emails. Intubated patients‚Äô lips bleeding many developed sores backs, called pressure ulcers, turned enough.

‚ÄúWe running ICUs safely appropriately,‚Äù Columbia resident wrote email attending physicians. ‚ÄúThe emotional burden working sci-fi-movie-gone-wrong ICUs roof.‚Äù

NewYork-Presbyterian‚Äôs Ms. Spaziani said hospital system began recruiting additional staff February ended 2,850 volunteers temporary front-line staff, including 150 additional respiratory therapists.

Joji Thadathil, Health + Hospitals Elmhurst respiratory therapist, estimated staffing better equipment could saved 30% 40% Covid-19 patients died there. Rio Flores, respiratory therapist, said documented 50 patients died part due improper ventilator settings untrained staff state-provided ventilators limited functionality NewYork-Presbyterian system‚Äôs Lower Manhattan hospital. Respiratory therapy specialized job requires license least two years training.

The Health + Hospitals spokeswoman said system ‚Äúmobilized quickly shift staff‚Ä¶and equipment hardest hit hospitals.‚Äù NewYork-Presbyterian‚Äôs Ms. Spaziani said hospital received reports ventilator malfunctions. like months. could 50,000 infections day- missed window opportunity that. mean...if beds, beds. lie again. explicitly stated proved use whataboutism. denied.

Oh well. not. all. politicians.

stop lumping progressive wing democratic party everyone else. politicians corporate military industrial complex slaves. vote politicians.  I'm tryna move hopefully we've gotten less dumb 3-5 years two possibilities. One provoke immune reaction 70% people. still get virus, may much less severe. Animal testing (which sometimes HIGHLY inaccurate) indicated one vaccines may function 2nd manner. good news test animals got severe case COVID. 


There's also question boosters. vaccines may require couple doses. know wet markets terrible unhygienic conditions cause. bamboo rats, raised hygienic farming conditions, dangerous cow pig farming correct inherently carry disease?  American here. They're 100% justified this. Could be. hand, severe respiratory pains discomfort doctors leaning telling Covid-19 make obvious. 

If still called flu that, would 100% lost cause. Get newsreporters, writers, president, make look faces people lost mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, cousins, friends virus try justify stupidity then. easy pull shit behind camera. people VOTE.. lot people think nothingburger. Putin always wanted isolated America, he's free expand. is. imagine he's pleased. nah... province Canada even commit keeping min. wage current level.

won't know tomorrow's package stimulus work projects happen. (again; doin hth opposite doing.) ""Shut up"" that's Alright, that's prerogative facts Same.

Um... worldometer nifty tool shows mild condition patients (non hospitalizations) serious critical condition patients. recover/die go said category. serious category budged month (1%) deaths going up. 1% starts move, worry. Patients going hospitals opened reasons finding COVID19, getting listed that. Money strapped hospitals get money COVID19 patients well. Notice FL left headlines hospitalizations wise? secretly wish it‚Äôs people like would wind ventilator. Watch Trump call return Freedom Fries Liberty Burgers, among food name changes. Yes, news much better something kind profound idea battling virus really depends much worst us willing care everybody else.

You‚Äôre absolutely right. win situation. vulnerable always suffer greatest. don‚Äôt think however springs distance learning used indicator distance learning done.

Cite wearing masks public allow health insurance charge higher premium drop altogether. One one hand: totally understandable since can‚Äôt follow simple restrictions.... hand: Guess long longer get finally travel Europe. embarrassing American right Yup That's people dying old folks homes basically lock room die. disappointing thing (among many, many disappointments) Trump handled passed easy way actually *LEAD*, so, save lives...

Imagine response come said, ""This virus defeat America people. cast aside differences wear masks protect brothers sisters better socially distance sooner reopen economy"" blah blah, patriotic speak. get point. 

Dems would worn masks social distanced, science. Trumpsters would worn masks social distanced Trump said. Anybody would face immense peer pressure sides. could saved tens thousands, reduced economic impact, potentially.... gotten reelected. Instead he's doubled pretending ever problem, people dying. military pick plants go give two fucks shut plants. 

The said so, record, straight congress' face. 

Congress said tank printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr  makes mad f2ck routinely see people refusing to,wear masks ""know better"". Long Island, say there's 100% compliance, there's enough. I'll say lately, interact folks usual stuff going lives, people generally great, recent examples.

I go Home Depot wife timed buying house baby middle this, needed get stuff move in, get crap there. guy front guy exit counting many people building allowing folks capacity there. Markers ground let know far back stand. Plexiglass windows customer service folks. Employees masks. customers masks, even wearing properly.

But generally, curbside. Order online, scan phone window, guy mask brings order throws trunk. Never interact anyone. 

Or day, go UPS store. allow 4 customers spots stand. Masks required. 20 seconds, interact one masked employee. 

Go pediatrician, call get there. tell waiting room go in. walk right waiting room, take forehead temperatures ask covid symptoms. never interact anyone doctor nurse. Hand sanitizer wipes hands card checkout. Again, 15 minutes. 

We movers move shit closed June 2nd. Three guys felt like hottest day year wearing masks problem whatsoever. 

Now, 100% people noncompliant plenty people give crap anyone themselves, there's enough people right thing, make difference. Honestly, might faster focus efforts developing medicines. vaccine cold 1) worth 2) doesnt mutate, neither true Covid, even vaccine can't found might worth make medicines it

H5N1 H1N1 troubling oseltamivir found effective treating virus, even though took year vaccine arrive that. case, think something similar would happen Covid: doctors trying medicines none work, could find _does_ treat effectively non-issue like flu - get tested, take medicines, boom solved.  lead even young people right direction, true leadership sorely lacking DeSantis others like him.

I'm 30 year old obese male I'm scared death getting it. deaths last sunday. 13,000+ cases Urban areas come back. there's vaccine. living suburb rural area bad idea it. many cases 2 hotspots, NY NJ. 6-10 hot spots growing faster rate, now. Yep. article states trace amounts, might false positive. virus similar respiratory infections places zero tolerance harassment policy.

And yet remains rampant. ok, matter much is. What's kind logic? Well, guy‚Äôs point video it‚Äôs way worse lack public buy-in lack commitment government point, agree with

In terms cases, want put something perspective though: deaths peaked ~2,200/day early April, IFR ~0.8%, point prior that, must ~275,000 new infections per day, even though fraction confirmed reported via testing, since testing limited time.

Currently, we‚Äôre getting ~40,000 new *reported* cases per day, much widely available testing (yes, know it‚Äôs still limited, it‚Äôs clearly readily available March/April), even though we‚Äôve exceeded previous records newly reported cases per day, positive we‚Äôve actually exceeded amount new *infections* per day late March early April.

That‚Äôs say situation isn‚Äôt extremely serious couldn‚Äôt get soon, wanted provide perspective since case per day somewhat murky number doesn‚Äôt necessarily give full picture. riots didn‚Äôt help.

That's works. go another hospital full. They'll bump lesser priority somewhere else work you. ain't gonna leave dead look whole picture. NY hit hard super fast Feds denying virus even really threat. literally DAYS respond best could.  Ok people still fun without bars restaurants even don‚Äôt kids. feel good stories wish shared often board.

That. win. exactly last time. People stay home think bag. happened last time, absolutely, 100% happen time. honestly may looking worst turnout history year.

Don't get complacent. Dont think over. Hahaha think trumps opponents Washington media would give credit anything could potentially ever do?

he could cure cancer would attacked putting cancer researchers work. told us listen doctor, would attacked knowing job. gotta write congressman . . .and include 25,000 dollar check. could possibly snowflake-y feeling threatened thin piece fabric?

I didn't. used word might. It‚Äôs data hide. Hoarding valuable information expense public heath traitorous behavior. Wonder loyalty lies it‚Äôs clearly public interest. Oh remember, it‚Äôs profits. couple highlights: 

""Attending child‚Äôs school event may leave someone house-bound couple days able needed tasks, like laundry.""

""Taking shower may leave someone ME/CFS bed-bound unable anything days.""  I‚Äôm really hoping everyday front runners get us need give toddler mean look? need guilt people wearing masks.

But summer camps day care working parents. recent poll, it‚Äôs one poll it‚Äôs respectable snapshots since March polls gap Trump Biden widening. Biden passed 50% approval Hillary never did, Trump 16 point difference approval (40% approve, 56% disapprove). won‚Äôt matter everyone votes, campaign need make significant strides make up. pandemic recession Oohhh told happened Milan elderly population poor air quality? Considering daily new deaths Florida Texas remained flat weeks now, median age new cases 35 (under 30 lots counties) I‚Äôd say data doesn‚Äôt seem dire. It‚Äôs entirely possible might increase 2-3 weeks, remain flat. Idk, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve saying ‚ÄújUsT wAiT tWO wEEks‚Äù that‚Äôs everyone saying Florida months now. Glad see 2 weeks took 3 months state loll. remember, broken clock always right twice day. 

As right NY NJ leading daily new deaths day, states, top IL still see deaths FL TX consistent basis. someone concerned virus understands data, come haven‚Äôt mentioned states seen spikes? care TX, FL, AZ. concerned spike CA, top fact see double amount new deaths states always mentioned. Washington Oregon? states seen huge spikes, concerned? 

I say, concerned states, understand data enough know happening states lead next NYC. Unfortunately, aren‚Äôt concerned virus, want certain states get hit hard fit whatever rageboner them. It‚Äôs went back comment 2 weeks ago, bet you‚Äôre patting back rn. It‚Äôs sick, it‚Äôs clear pandemic brings worse people. aware 4/5 week lag infections deaths? that's seeing - expect full effect runaway rise cases show death column towards end July. TL;DR: dying???

One post obsessing T-cell drop seen ""only critically ill patients"" several anxious commenters expressing nervous relief, like OCD patients going hours affirmation repeated mirror. Even though true. Yes seen commonly severely critically ill patients, seen patients milder infections too. main point recent research. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article ](http://archive.is/06IDz)

Pretty useless tbf it‚Äôs interactive graphic doesn‚Äôt show listen Reddit data point current spike family gatherings non-100% mask use. It‚Äôs great live state people actually look other‚Äôs well being.

After weeks seeing mask usage drop, sometimes point one, today saw masks I've ever seen. think might 50% grocery store.

The mayor issued mask order Friday. though I'm county, order seems caused people change behavior county. maybe know city limits are.

Either way, mask usage up. thank goodness Florida new cases cross 5 digit mark next week. I've quite skeptical healthy even watching propaganda documentary Game Changers. restaurant 3 tables next bar that‚Äôs also guests still don‚Äôt put face masks walk restaurant I'm moving!

Don‚Äôt forget memes RIGHTS *COUGH COUGH Let rephrase: pretty good quantification consensus sees race standing.

Where stand day election accurate 99 100 times.

Sadly, 1 100 important election all. think news outlets done extremely bad job. dont watch lot news, go online even find video inside hospitals. Obviously politicians caused harm, think reporting also really poor. videos mentioned nightly news months, probably lot fewer people would think hoax. /shrug wouldn‚Äôt say so. Rome people mostly wearing mask outside bigger part wears inside shops. fucking idiots young ones, it? mask movement big USA, get listened City Council. city council would allow get in. guy micro penis balls what‚Äôs right. 1957 Asian Flu burned 25% population infected. it‚Äôs entirely question herd immunity could achieved lower level. Quite factual actually bud wanted beforehand, utterly horrible people (refusing weak masks, calling virus hoax) desire greatly increased. want nothing people days. call they‚Äôre leading right now? aortally, might also ordering foodstuffs itno homes Wal-Mart grocery stores delivering. doing.

Sure, sometimes things stock cannot get wanted benefits go store great.

No need wear mask, need worry someone coronavirus sneezing face, etc.

I've already disease once. want again, enough considering killed parents. someone tell already phase two development one knows long antibodies last? I‚Äôd like see many believe actually accomplished anything. wear one, unless it‚Äôs legit medical mask believe nothing. Aerosol particles small. Thank help! Lmao mask going much. problem hundreds thousands people protesting, rioting, etc., actually encouraged politicians. going weeks, could expect uptick? People walking arm arm, maskless. I'm glad least people getting entertainment this. someone lives Florida...I'm thrilled. I'm already hearing fireworks live city limits. Love idea Came stop calling Fox news cal fox opinion? *In mess right hail science right? Bro, I‚Äôm actual essential worker. wear mask. go work mask. 

Teachers protected, I‚Äôd consider essential workers. ways done, costs little $. heaven forbid actually spend money giving kids education keeping workers safe.

I mean, know probably sucks kids like you. mean, it‚Äôs lot harder blow school play video games day actually building. don‚Äôt give kids real education, we‚Äôre going generation unemployable, ignorant people suffering long pandemic ends. Yes. Applies students travelling U.S. passport. Reddit jealous, bitter people planet. pay mind. Ngl give two flying fucks. I'm worried trying keeping food table, avoiding deadly virus vaccine, borderline civil war levels unrest getting laid going Europe time. Okay, I‚Äôm week early - don‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôll come back next week - I‚Äôm checking *guarantee* 2k deaths day. One week go deaths kept falling. sign 2k daily deaths sight. rolling 7 day average approaching 1/4 that. Fingers crossed ü§û I‚Äôm right least fall slightly worst level next week. 

By way, here‚Äôs global relationship daily new cases deaths been: Thats Germany normal leadership Probably vaccine. Oxford expects vaccine done end year, heard drug trials clear timeline. agree vast majority sizeable minority not. sympathetic someone get many many vaccines  european dont blame neither. Oh great, "" need masks"" Facebook posts medical field again. Hope stock time least older conservative folks ones dying. might seem mean got us mess take life important wear mask. I‚Äôm saying things aren‚Äôt bad can‚Äôt expect change drastically happen overnight numbers. 

Even every single person followed guidelines 100% likely least solid week ‚Äúrecord‚Äù days begins slow.

You seeing every major hot spot. Hopefully slightly background approach, offer guidance nurses already practices procedures; experience NYC gonna save many lives. follow dark.

-Death Cutie Michael ""Draggin' Dick"" Pencie think there's enough evidence supporting public qualified decide themselves. Oh telling shithole intentions ever visiting wont allow in?

The absolute horror. American taking seriously, it‚Äôs really nothing short embarrassing. Even highly liberal areas there‚Äôs lot people taking seriously, takes handful. one too! Please find source 4/5 weeks bc 18.5 days. doubled fit narrative. Funny ""2 weeks!"" turned 5 weeks. Thank god MEAN MUSLIM BAN?!?!!

There‚Äôs muslims America racist fucks?! there‚Äôs legitimate intelligence threat you‚Äôll ban muslims?! Fucking racist fuckers! could possibly expected guy whose catch phrase ""you're fired"" horrible boss? He's like 80 years old. amazing - looks great IMHO. I'll look like shit 80 :) familiar LA? tons trails, even normal times absolutely possible go hiking see people. Woman work got doctor's note say wear mask... told she'd wear plastic face shield instead *got another doctor's note* saying could wear mask. real, thought world would closed us years ago. yeah, science process scientists humans.

the history plate tectonics fascinating tale scientific obstinance. mental gymnastics flat earthers also great deal acrimony top that. Exactly dude. Supposed 2 months visits; we‚Äôre closing 5. people refuse wear masks social distance. CT pretty much 100%. We're also one two states cases declining. Rhode Island other. Hmm. interesting. grandparents born US great grandparents born either Ireland, Poland, (now) Slovakia. would realllllly like leave US never thought could option. I'd love learn more. That's one biggest problems country, politicians act like scientists discrediting people believe China came it, let's say viable vaccine, prepare ""Trade War II, Electric Boogaloo""

And course, it'll simply Trump going ""tariffs!"" China going ""there 192 countries buy shit US"" - China fine US one day get vaccine 2025, ironically, counterfeiting it. Yep: Austerity chickens come home roost. ‚ÄòThis comment ironic‚Äô-you Thank Mr Scientist, feel much better course, would less inevitable breeding ground virus right next door nation

Inevitability self fulfilled prophecy there. following. rationing US. hospital full, think system going magically create capacity?  Throw another stimulus check could totally sweep things. know, since DT gave us money last time. (Yes, know people said did.) Fair. travel great deal, lot folks community grew seem sort confused I‚Äôm always big hurry gtfo states. Many means travel frequently more, don‚Äôt seem desire so. fine! Different strokes different folks. I‚Äôve always thought factor us taught pinnacle society earth. that‚Äôs true, leave? 

But sure think you‚Äôre definitely wrong. full time positions held 2 years covid.

I actually realized SIL.on side also lost job BIL remained employed. position falls line getting at. full time, essential, contract based service probably first thing would cut used them. Mostly took seriously Alright, what's best place buy masks online? like, what's best mask get mailed me? 

I'd like use amazon speed delivery quality hit-or-miss sometimes I'd rather informed purchase.  American, monument topple represent outrage situation? feel distance learning 6 year olds? ""the way school *[anything]* works"" part way world developed point.

They're going better excuses like that. Dude work 3 hours day. home. fact gyms incredibly risky right - closed room great circulation, heavy breathing, shitloads surfaces everyone touches. Gyms one riskiest places go right now, probably bars worse. need update thinking, serious virus completely naive growing incredibly quickly population right now. need modify behavior ensure infect entire population. Pretending risk acceptable affected putting risk, putting everyone risk. Oh man cant wait see deluded Americans start complaining rights infringed bitchimg freedom go wherever want.

I honestly kinda expect least hopefully one actually fucking dumb Mostly younger patients.... nothing see folks outside events please. sports concerts. 

The ppl encouraging kids go protest protesting ones screaming lockdown. hypocrisy. Whoa big guy. aliens coming here. built wall Canadian geese. guys get bill? populace morons. curiosity, church belong promoting something erroneous/dangerous still part church? Especially many churches online services would easy move church that's actually making sure members stay healthy. pastors priest get voice people keep listening instead going elsewhere. dont scared, going survive regular ""middle class"" American neither vacation time money plan proper trip Europe. So, oh well bad rich people guess. probably part New world order Hate say it, going much bigger China-level shit. RIP Americans. good lasted. drones expensive? 4 million drone, almost 9 million tank. Fuel wise, yes, drone expensive, difference much imagine. missile far expensive shell, yes. I'll bet money properly armed drone takes tank, reverse.

Most importantly though? Ease deployment, speed arrival, stealth capability, rock/paper/scissors. one side 10 drones, 10 tanks, bet on? likely be, effective anti-tank capability, effective anti-drone? important questions.

I actually like drones, agree, they're expensive, create problems fix them; that's ease deployment. can't move tank halfway across world, even country, without detected, target moving. good bad comes it. Fox dismantled, either forcibly acting public good via series lawsuits. OK, Karen gave doctors time develop treatments. Death rates bad outcomes things learned extra time. Kind like Desantis saying 'you cant control young people.' transparent Lego bricks floor actually think *most* Americans irresponsible this. guess depends from. America massive many different types people. Seriously. Thank think people realizing mega cities longer viable options considering another pandemic could likely happen lifetime. Businesses flee New York subjected restrictions can‚Äôt business anytime. Sure Tech companies survive that‚Äôs one industry diverse economy makes state. actually think states cheap open land low cost living going see huge population increases. Especially, Texas, Idaho, Utah, Arizona. People seeing value low cost living desperation people. Tech workers moving California currently ability work anywhere want make much better quality life. wish way isolate fools themselves. could idiot die without harming reasonable people. think mean last Friday. (not WSJ though) God damnit, literally sports league actually end playing. Fuck sold DraftKings stock last Monday fuck even saying, ""blinded political stance""? about, ""being crushed police state""? i'm non-american i'm rooting protestors, they're making change happen.

granted, america circus world reasons, mostly laughable leadership morons emboldened misled said leaders/mainstream media.

masks also proven significantly cut spread, shit going ""repel 100%"" that's infectious diseases work. hear ya ! really hoping better candidates fucking deserve it. Fuck trump fucked us real good. best friend forced back work paralegal lawyer think big deal. wears mask like pocket square makes fun wearing mask meetings. Meanwhile clients stance dictate whether office wear masks day. Last week, one wore masks meeting client caring elderly parents recovering Covid. Brilliant fucking people can't fucking dumb.   Trader Joe‚Äôs never curbside pickup footprint tiny. back room small dont way creating place pickup order storage. It‚Äôs nature design. story fake news loser. admitted yourself. site may reputable information article is. Jesus. Nah what‚Äôs going save us local leaders saying screw going anyway. time anyone challenges order courts positive impact started felt. Early Houston tried make masks mandatory phase 1 reopen, Abbott publicly announced orders wouldn‚Äôt legal. latter. good friend who's med school final years studying teaching hospital. initial outbreak said hospital thinking temporarily certifying classmates could help. Luckily never came that. little, late. see backside, downsides! Imagine comparing 50% death rate vs 0.26%, get mad people compare corona flu I‚Äôm dumb ass crane operator couldn‚Äôt possibly self educate anything... thought mask made look like mortal combat wore it. Why‚Äôs everyone else wearing it. I‚Äôm smart enough figure out. 


I hate people like you. can't fix stupid. Impossible lol whole time every country world trying keep people separated groups. Riots massive groups people screaming, hollering, etc....please use head. Asians racist Americans still seek asylum dumb ass people here?! *Asshole friends. Lol... US slowly revealing actual 3rd world country hidden behind glitz glamour. saying productive stuff towing party line? (which wouldn‚Äôt surprised one hopes) privileges immunities clause? It‚Äôs reserved power it‚Äôs clearly enunciated. oh no! planning European vacations right now. Look Governor Whitmer Michigan. She‚Äôs got balls guy lacks. ‚ÄúDo say, do. Believe blatantly lie over, great Americans. Know lies sincere, well planned, serve real purpose. last Friday, porpoise said flattened curve; cases going testing more. see hospitalizations skyrocketing many areas country, states may well become control outbreaks. Don‚Äôt mind that. Don‚Äôt even pay attention data even science. keep focus saying you. best interests mind. pray understand remember November.‚Äù

/s Sounds pretty racist. US bars Chinese entering called racist. different? Live NYC... it‚Äôs not. really closed governor didn‚Äôt mince words hold back talking us truth. masks help course, first month two mention masks importance. Thanks. go Europe places make effort learn language, least polite show made effort. rude people every country too. Lets remember Sunday reporting though- said Thailand handled things well. Yeah bullshit. Go Walmart. Escape movies? heard dead. see whoring cheeseburgers again. I‚Äôm also Iowa I‚Äôd say 80% people wearing masks wherever go!! Des Moines though, maybe it‚Äôs different smaller towns?  SW Washington hilljacks also wearing masks ignoring en masse giving stink eye wear mask. I'm always surprised go see people responsible hit us hard-- yet. April 6th weeks ago? Weird. 28th day June time zone. wonder US expats included ban. So, reason listen politician? building even shut down. visitors allowed, residents. go outside meet delivery person. cleaned elevator every use, temperature check front desk, put hand sanitizer stations everywhere. live super, sat lobby enforced everything. believe bot. Sorry aren‚Äôt. similar bot would do/say country different reporting standard constitutes confirmed case. early days outbreak March, China consider symptoms pneumonia along coronavirus confirmed case. Everyone China emphasized associated virus pneumonia. Furthermore, Chinese authorities consider asymptomatic carriers confirmed COVID-19 cases (they even separate figure asymptomatic carriers).

So think it‚Äôs difficult compare apple oranges. Thanks anyone wondering like was, population Nebraska 1.934 million. Whenever drive would guessed 20k. Lol we're probably gonna shut Fake news. weren't, cannot justify murder warning first.

We're never going agree murder 120 years advanced Yes, know humans living Americas well timeframe Noah alive. place Noah way accessing, let alone warning them. people way traveling across ocean. 

r/Whooosh even work? doubt it. Definitely makes prioritize things. It‚Äôs 3 months, smell/taste still hasn‚Äôt come back, frustrating. But, think people didn‚Äôt make ordeal. secretly side pro-income gap? sister starting Northeastern decided let everyone move since Massachusetts well. said whether testing quarantining everyone two weeks arrive campus trying keep ‚ÄôAmerican Virus‚Äô , Plague, contained *CommonSense.dll missing, place missing .dll /DeSantis/FrontalLobe/Cerebrum/dll continue proper functioning.* Halting largest economy planet embarrassing. pandemic cure. fuck, sit ruin global economy wait cure, probably US? sub ridiculous. stripclubs operating like that.they legitimately kitchens mean 

It's weird loophole. Reciprocity listed one criteria actually. 

Regardless, US failing miserably. wouldn‚Äôt invite us either foreign country.  People love disparage Americans, roots Asia Europe talk friends colleagues daily business, would say many ways, people took seriously. Mask wearing close 100 percent anywhere counts, like indoors big box shops, even outdoor venues like beaches aren‚Äôt back 100 percent capacity, restaurants still struggling half cap well. Offices still aren‚Äôt back 100 percent loads precautions taken, really nothing life same. sure wouldn‚Äôt harm good disrupt normal running society have.

We fucking something doubt. majority people see everything reasonable.

You small minority really dumb people going things like political rallies protests. Even miraculously got vaccine end year, general public won‚Äôt get hands months later simply front line workers prioritized everyone else. 

We may well write 2020 regarding vaccine saving rears; isn‚Äôt going happen. people. like user said, people travelling higher risk areas, anyone goes risk. Low-value tourism desired right now. stop watching news past week? Although shots jammed crowds bars Nashville recently aroused controversy, believed first instances stars drawing standing-room-only, non-distancing crowds ticketed performances large numbers since national quarantining began, least first lack social distancing proudly shared stars themselves. Deaths state flat months, cases gone way up. However, New york, death's chart almost identical positive cases. Why? we're testing asymptomatic people. likely many initial surges far higher now. son went problem appendix last week (which removed) still coronavirus test. testing everyone chance... People make money selling tanks guns. 

When COVID shit went first thing get Jared Kushner build enterprise make money medical equipment.

Teachers make anyone money. Doctors make anyone money. PPE makes money restrict control supply resell large enough profit worth trouble. plan that. honestly know. Hard tell much reduction much measures put place stop spread shutdowns, masks, social distancing, etc though. I‚Äôm fine ban making fun blumkins support trump god I‚Äôm going hate slight tinge embarrassment saying I‚Äôm America I‚Äôm countries sheer fact rest world thinks we‚Äôre mouth breathers think masks denying gift god air American death count least triples, won‚Äôt give shit. numbers still small potatoes. Downvote troll Hopefully things bad November Don‚Äôt know you‚Äôre downvoted this. People politicized beliefs they‚Äôll accept one type congregating spread virus other. people congregate regardless reason, virus spread. Pure simple .  Whether another debate. Yup. assuming left image ‚Äúno mask‚Äù right images ‚Äúwith mask‚Äù lose 3-train commute find annoying, you‚Äôre gaining something Said someone likely knows nothing wellness takes build immune system. ... FREEDUMB! American, understanding citizens Europe wanted decades! lol Good. suck. link study? Mmm still allowed investigate Wuhan (pretty clean bet), still numbers recent Beijing outbreak. Usa locally getting ridiculous China, China still wins prize. I'm sorry hear situation previous health condition andso sad healthcare worker protections non existent. Screw guys. Better anyway could also include China, China allows EU travelers visit well, EU officials told paper.

This part seems little bit based reciprocation. understand 400k/8.4 million ‚Äúburning through‚Äù lmao. Considering mandatory masks here, much better typical american still go daily life.

I didn‚Äôt downplay virus saying isn‚Äôt lethal people think, kills 1 1000 people probably already didn‚Äôt even know. flu isn‚Äôt dangerous covid isn‚Äôt lethal HIV Spanish flu many doomers seem think scare others. China swift reaction knew reported rest world. ok cause people people hoax travel domestically. healthcare might be. rumor started us bringing Chinese Olympics. Thank calm explanation. nurse educate someone recently. always look blind discrimination, wait time backed science. Especially considering takes minimum 6 weeks HIV really start coming back positive Protest factor, much people want admit it. guys let through? wanna get shithole full retarded people Sure, peanut brain. Keep thinking Europe actually enjoyable place live. Tolls might stop poor people. poor people getting sick? not, dumb idea. Won‚Äôt ever happen makes much sense. simple people still get common colds? vaccination made them? truth guarantee vaccinations stop herd immunity ever reached. Animals get infected. going round every animal vaccinate well.
You keep saying everyone else, sounds like interested could careless rights others.
You bring kids, disease affects kids less elderly more.
There always risk. People die car accidents everyday, yet continue links links research showing vaccinations may safe masses led believe.

The last thing want inject healthy children vaccination rushed sleep better night. higher chance long term harm kids vaccinating children dying COVID-19 makes sense trust math.  Good idea! I'm listening Hopefully. Sorry come cynical jaded. Facebook friends post new ""miracle drug"" every week make covid-19 go away summer heat going ""broil"" coronavirus.

Obviously Oxford Vaccine Group fall category. Ah, see. surprised still wins ... cure hidden till election. thinking maybe nurse deserves basic ppe job, stuff mentioned would cool lived country respected life effort needed save it. going backfire spectacularly New York. state verge bankruptcy limiting interstate commerce essentially guaranteeing recovery slower states. coronavirus stay. Likely 2 years, it‚Äôs going spread back states anyway. get chose whether economic collapse along mass death coming us. someone living Oklahoma, good luck, really wish bars closed good without vectors open (I like idea outdoor eating help minimize spread). someone needs ICU beds full COVID patients, answer simple: someone die.

This death toll skyrockets ICU capacity reached, ""flattening curve"" thing. American, really care guess California fairly poor Democratic leader power? Waitstaff: ‚ÄúHow would like cooked?‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúUh.. chefs choice‚Äù

17 year old line cook: ‚Äúhmmm... microwave 2:30 2:45...‚Äù  Certainly indoors greater risk, sunlight takes roughly 90 seconds kill airborne covid particles according not-peer-reviewed research. Ninety seconds still long time, definitely instantaneous. I'm wary indoor outdoor transmission, although--as say--indoor shared ventilation greater risk. Kind like hot Canadian girlfriend? fictional? man. Corona affect you, woke. work retail. claimed wear masks inside businesses. lie detector test determined lie. fox news mass murderers? damn Figured that. Won‚Äôt years folks. That‚Äôs prediction. Lol live NY moron American‚Äôs (myself incuded) America‚Äôs bullshit Ppe manufacturers need get lobbyists order... Oh wait. Good.

&amp;#x200B;

Continue using greater amounts thinking, European politicians deserving thanks this. I‚Äôm sure. drugs promise, turning patient stomach helps, anything really worked things wouldn‚Äôt dire. Nothing sure thing. Banned coronavirus isn‚Äôt big threat anymore headline. much higher actual capacity. I‚Äôm mad. completely understand. I‚Äôm expert integrating immunocompromised populations public nonmedical sector (think schools, grocery stores, camps), also training hazardous materials exposure protocols disaster relief work toxic environs. feel like enactable plans quite different currently failing miserably. know containment, worked extensively voiceless population subgroups, tell current plans way addressing real issue, gross misuse PPE. explain exactly think help actually getting everyone sick. think like lockdown? I've lost job. I've lost insurance. Newsom kept lockdown, we'd better shape. since lifted it, nothing happened. Might well done first place US government incompetent? never felt unsafe country's healthcare system. solo power water powered things? think florida opposite new york almost everything still first wave Well least we'll something look forward people saying Singapore 2 months ago. S'pore over, pandemic, control.

What Beijing? 

What South Korea? 

Nobody safe until, if, vaccine. Unless island low cases high compliance like Taiwan NZ, lockdown measure stop modulate pandemic virus fantasy.

Lockdowns like amputating leg treating infected toe. Right. look solutions people [just days ago convinced Florida &amp; Texas re-opened without think going lot people inclined pay much attention ""advice"". dunno, maybe, heard anything like that. joke years still funny Ya, don‚Äôt call us next time need someone bail world war per usual. Whatever mechanism, 100% clear February masks work reduce spread , every country corona using good effect.

Saying """"stop buying masks, work"" LIE, dangerous lie. Even later CDC lager found way ""harmonize"" contradictory messaging mean tremendous damage telling people wear masks 2 months. fuck people even want eat right now? take home eat, goddamn hard. go take picnic. deal mask. people making hard.

Being allowed vote complain mean guaranteed representation looked after. Even 100% still capable handling something like 4 times many coronavirus cases currently have... tolls essentially form tax, paying privilege using road gaining access side. doubts itinary based stuff a) requires know fully advance, b)i) can't change plans there, b)ii) change plans they're accounted for, c) requires complete honesty.

Yeah see gamble, everything right now. hope benefits outweigh costs.

The Texas one terrible idea. friend Colorado said everyone flocking whilst open neighbouring states weren't. can't see foresight manage it. We(UK) opening pubs restaurants Saturday, England. It'll interesting see happens border crossings Wales Scotland. Uhh, close fucking beaches bars fucking piece shit enable enforce it. That's power Iran possess way China, better worse. I've stated right thing do, claim ""victory"" simply wrong.

I've looking around, I've seen threads last week Reddit also Swedish news regarding population thinks response, honestly can't find proper source. Yet remember (unfortunately can't source though) support decreasing - we've also lately seen lot critique among opposition parties Sweden - support current strategy among people still somewhere inbetween 50-60%. dare say yes, average Swede still does, albeit overwhelmingly so.

As asking elaborate why, can't give complete answer. guess simple answer since we're living society (something quite honestly case quite countries) people trust state, state also trusts people. might sound absurd read, *a* way look it.

A lot people course critisising Sweden's response whole pandemic. say they're right, time get feeling basically using Sweden scape-goat boost morale prove right thing. that's weird thing say, compare things like that, pandemic (remember long took actually call pandemic?) actually done with.

I'm trying argue Sweden things right wrong country, think countries complete lockdowns enforcing quarantines right things, nothing quite black white many wants things be.

You might look I'm ""grasping straws"", would disagree, professor (Harvard professor William Hanage) article I'm refer defend approach per se, [he makes quite many ways misunderstood. Also [this interesting read, might tell development could still happen many western countries, albeit delayed due previous lockdowns.

Again argue no-one ""declare victory"" midst it, await ultimate facts arguing better worse. Would include study abroad programs? well, young people new blaming target Uhh.. sarcasm? you

Yes fantastic job reactive rather proactive! Fantastic! 

Oh wait, waited tens thousands died anything right? Reactivity pro activity shouldnt praised? bad.

It‚Äôs much closer truth could ever realized.  honestly don‚Äôt think societal collapse certain states entirely question. Especially overpopulated areas like Southern Cali. Oops, meant greedy. Lazy troll, 2/10 Despite original comment somewhat tongue cheek, studies think 5-10x many unconfirmed covid cases confirmed ones. NYC may 20-30% positive antibody testing selection methodology used accurate. Hotspots like Arizone currently 20% positive rate testing insane shows many cases falling cracks. US already almost 1% population confirmed cases already. even though mostly joking, US kept pace increased actually think would take multiple years run entire population, least major urban centers.

What non-sense gloves? would anyone advise gloves?

When worked food industry, gloves worn everyone kitchen. clear plastic disposable ones went shit load throughout day. used think insane well, work one plants. see exactly insane so-called safety measures bullshit. 

My plant news, ton cases...yet. reason say ""yet"" couple weeks ago, apparent reason, everyone work stopped giving shit. one wears mask anymore, everyone acts like joke.

My guess plants either never bothered care first place ahead stupid curve stopped caring. safety measures world matter practice enforce them.

Yeah that‚Äôs basically handwashing.

Absolutely tiny risk compared breathing virus laden droplets. isn‚Äôt? Serious question. self-proclaimed defenders free speech can‚Äôt deal kind opposition. What? mean like turning epidemiologists disease control experts for, ya know, pandemic? Get ur head ur arse. Europe pretty bad shouldn‚Äôt hard them, all. know exact details early days, first death NYC March 14, lockdown put place 6 days later RemindeMe! 14 days Compare Florida deaths NY. sure?

Ok, double rate south america (and India) scary. correct, flat number hospitalizations.  strain virus European origin, necessarily imported Europe.

The chief epidemiologist Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention interviewed said

You believe want believe believe want believe, science medicine something change believing believing. Many, many med students across U.S. allowed [graduate early even skip help hospitals. admirable also frightening-- imagine standards care drop less experienced less trained people thrown deep end. Many experienced doctors nurses places like Italy, New York, Wuhan, etc., said never seen anything like this. imagine we're going lot healthcare provider burnout, deep-seated psychological effects trauma survivor's guilt. country kept separate covid ICU available units. know obviously many taken normal allocations used Covid seemed manage regular usage well.

A big factor lockdowns reduced accidents illnesses capacity time. 30 new infections found! must many more! Lock stop spread! Yo thanks sharing article, I've never heard term ""doomscrolling"" comforting know people stuck shitty pattern.

First, long-term consequences even die, even need ICU/Ventilator. doctors hypothesized might cause sterility, certainly cause serious lifetime cardiopulmonary consequences might damage immune system similar HIV/AIDS does. likely degree even young people. common unknown.

Second there's this. Young people die accidents age group. ICU beds taken up, chances dying go up, whether longer trip hospital open beds, longer wait times, inadequate support.

Oh global times.. state sponsored media.. DeSantis stuck February loop handwashing, even though virtually none transmission due surface contamination end 2020, New Zealand's economy could 10.4% smaller, Australia's expected 4.7% smaller.

It unclear terms used, appear deceptive context. talking GDP year, sure, will, larger contraction total dollars changing hands period including respective lockdowns.

Is economy ""smaller"" end though? look GDP considerably *after* lockdown, including it. gives better measure well economic damage confined, well jobs saved.

Also, correct record: Australia certainly keep bars open, serving takeaway. permitted to, perhaps sold overpriced delivered cocktail, although certainly know anyone bought one. kept viable primarily JobKeeper, ie govt paying wages making kind services almost irrelevant ability keep afloat.

I‚Äôm also guy, mayor, governor, health commissioner NY.  Insults? Reported blocked. people vote deserve leadership get We‚Äôre seeing drop mortality new infections rising.

The spike infections places like Florida first started 4 weeks ago. would expected show trickle deaths statistics right now. Jun 1st 7 day average positive test results 726, peaked Apr 7th 1143, past 3 days 8,000. It'll another 4 weeks start feel death rate current headlines generated positive test results Florida. death stats ticking upwards indicate change behavior virus.

And Florida get hit hard begin with, people reacted headlines NYC Italy initially actually stop virus. Since Florida 2.5 times population NY State, virus able kill least 80,000 Florida alone (not counting excess deaths might make 2x bad based analysis NYC). They're currently 3,419 they're even 5% way yet.

There's also still ways go, though, spread hits New York-levels daily spread virus -- 1/3rd absolute level NYC peak (adjusted number tests) across whole state would 1/8th so. good news r(t) virus 1.4 nearly 5.0 like start outbreak NYC. means there's time react people may start voluntarily start behave ways slow again. could see 64,000 infections day Florida month nothing done (although suspect testing capacity shot get there, point it'll bad would hope everything shuts happens).

There may bit blunting effect older risk people careful, virus rips entire population they're going make mistakes get infected still die -- it'll show at-risk population slightly slower -- like old people Florida hermetically sealed BSL4 facilities.

And that's thing, there's many old people Florida may wildly conservative assuming numbers look like New York. Somwtimes whatever source fits narrative within goal posts good enough source, catch drift. can‚Äôt argue statistics lol. You‚Äôre denying facts calling dumb one. agree. don‚Äôt mind getting sick.

Doesn‚Äôt mean need stop precautions. It‚Äôs still killing ton people lot hospitals around US capacity. numbers aren‚Äôt slowing either. Hold onto bootstraps. San Antonio beginning June recovered cases active, case counts outside jail system, less 20 per day, sometimes single digits. Abbott took away ability local government prepare respond city‚Äôs unique situations broad opening including bars movie theaters saying it‚Äôs infringement civil liberties require mask. we‚Äôve solid week 400+ cases day, yesterday record 695 cases. 4 weeks went stable, schools projected open time, high school sports played, beginning sense kind normalcy 4th fastest case growth nation. bullshit ‚Äòyou‚Äôve solved puzzle requiring masks‚Äô - bullshit. It‚Äôs different trump waiting 70 days acknowledge virus. time without masks cost us we‚Äôll continue pay. lines waiting cars indication, numbers continue rise we‚Äôre getting started. 100% Abbott happening. Also, T-shirt deducted pay. What's that? yes company makes t-shirts owned hospital director's nephew. it? tell China's real plan spread misinformation masks work everybody gets sick tanks economy. Trump's last resort elected blame Pence Coronavirus dump ticket. Pence wants job 2020 unlikely VP, that's he's finally pretending human. saying reason... job... I'm... paying do... is, job do? saying? trying convince of, exactly? useless asshole right here? \[taps elbow\] Well guess what, Buddy. think, fucking convinced me! digitalisation AI investment something China becoming world-leader in. Iran is... know word use compare them, they're ages behind, would argue Iranian government given chance would use exact tools monitor control population given chance. loads articles documentaries discussing advanced China becoming AI field, give one example, BBC probably rather reliable starting honestly simple - China invested areas rather outstanding way, course bring great advantages common Chinese man/woman, also allow state enforce views onto populace.

I looked around more, found Local article supporting previously said. based IPSOS enquiry. support ""authorities"" (i.e. government) dropped 50%, whole thing support Public Health Agency (currently 57%) state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell (currently 60%) matters. there's source, guess - like not.

While medical staff tired (I nurse close family Stockholm), levels april long gone now. Things improving, seen official statistics regarding number people ICU, number dead. using mayor browsers, [this take official statistics Public Health Agency. translate ""Nya intensivv√•rdade fall per dag"" (on right side) represents number new ICU patients per day, ""Avlidna per dag"" represents deceased per day. represent typical ""flatten curve"" thing many shouting back february/mars, right things look rather stable, see. trend clear. ""Sjukdomsfall per dag"" - meaning number confirmed cases per day - increasing, real correlation lower two graphs, since testign doubled last months (yep, tested far little initially, obviously). doubled testing, number positive tests would increased, ICU/deaths numbers would decreased change compared now.

I'm glad agree however victory claimed whole thing. country able claim ""victorious"" - even best case scenario country say New Zealand Taiwan manages actually erradicate virus, still suffer immensely due toll tourism international trade taken due pandemic. one win.

I ask though (if feel like discussing whole thing further), quoting you: ""the important way control epidemic respect science medicine"" - mean? would argue lockdowns related sociological economic aspects rather scientific medicinal ones. Science medicine affected approach countries take pandemic situation. curious. agree you, move barely half-measure going help. governor needs shut everything immediately. next days numbers going explode, shutdown not. Exponential growth like ""boil frog"" scenario, already close spilling over. know hostile can‚Äôt hear true. Rates infection surging like never before, rates death either flat falling depending read graph. lag weeks see surge cases see surge deaths could spend two weeks ventilator die. said, already couple weeks past last surge, death rates climbing.

A possibilities exist (or mixture them): 

1. could virus mutated less deadly. doctor Italy claiming true. 
2. could testing much robust catching asymptomatic mild cases even tested March April. So, could several orders magnitude cases back then.
3. could treatments therapies improved much death rate tiny fraction used be. steroid, Remdesivir, better practices treat patients. one go asks you‚Äôve sexual contact mail. Specifically Good know. Right. Still, I've seen plenty articles stating thing over. new, karma-farming. guess fine since people want space complain America without getting banned. Whatever, enjoy s**t-talking space, I'm real news.  use COVID-19 all. literally shows action virus. 


I physician, please don‚Äôt tell ‚Äúthe actual facts‚Äù Covid treatment. using HCQ + AZI + zinc protocol beginning treat Covid patients thought big risk qt-prolongation worth supposed possible benefits. saw benefit increased mortality. Whether fact zinc part treatment protocol along HCQ documented completely separate issue good reason read peer reviewed studies, pre-prints information. Covid, public release pre-print studies virtually nonexistent. stayed way general public doesn‚Äôt understand importance scientific method. There's lots can't dead! way addressing real issue, gross misuse PPE. explain exactly think help actually getting everyone sick.

Yeah, tell us thoughts experience this? need safe space too. Thin skinned little bunker babies. would willing bet money someone try pass bill ensuring people dying Coronavirus votes counted alive states...

We spend lot effort really focusing emphasizing small number worst people. fair take mask giving speech, even Fauci. simply make sure distance here. Six feet apart masks unless rally. Got it! can‚Äôt wear mask? still breathe mouth mask on. ‚Äúnominally third world country‚Äù talking about? give example this? Young folk make cohort bad unmitigated times Q1 longer list expected. suspect ones restricting specific states would get challenged thrown anyone willing take time. treat everyone like states. know Rhode Island's NY restriction immediately ended challenged made apply state. totally clear cut courts allow gray area. past states like CA tried block people specific states like OK (Okies Grapes Wrath) entering. Counties NC tried block residents homes Outer Banks accessing properties ordered still flights available US EU meet exceptions entry (dual US/EU citizens)? want see research hypothesis virus, left untreated would affect survivors 10 years (since asymptomatic common mean damage-free). Unfortunately consequences. He's necessarily going lose bigly.... virus may end excuse suppress vote. careful vigilant.  Im Chicagoland area there‚Äôs lot Europeans friends good amount. seems like taking super serious ignoring guidelines lol That's weird. I'm mostly young people wearing masks abiding rules actually set place.. think see lot places pressure open schools. Georgia. NYS mean?

Good case, bad case middle road???? isn‚Äôt economics. It‚Äôs changing demographics U.S. states... can‚Äôt deny Western states experiencing tremendous population growth. It‚Äôs going decades now... *and cover nose too. need training? American isn‚Äôt deescalating point shoot? Oh no, I'm totally missing interesting part world.... It‚Äôs almost it‚Äôs scientists‚Äô job specialize science :o still reporting hospitalization icu patients % capacity. metric good measure create needed. Texas hospitalization total went today. China bullies nearby nations. Well done blm funny, funny. enjoyed comment / joke. good one! really interesting, Thank you! especially part below, well good tactics heard give best PPE people cannot survive south pretty sweet glad. Let everyone ban us show stupid country became. won‚Äôt even protect citizens surely can‚Äôt trusted leaving country. Almost protests India lockdown masks.

But social distancing hard india, population density. example, city like Mumbai would twice much land actually able follow social distancing protocols, still would difficult considering many people get every day. 

[This normal day Mumbai give idea many people are, New York 9,500 people per square kilometre, Mumbai 20,000. 

As solution, possible thing shut down, that's done days. lockdown can't continue long though, many poor people poor survive without wages. others (who considered ""not poor"") live paycheck paycheck spend half salaries rent.

So people either succumb COVID economic famine, unless rich. doubt, use categorical imperative. everyone did, would things turn out? think want everyone cross country trip looks like hotspot time covid 19 america. stay put year. SC blowing cases risk it. ""I prefer shopping."" That's needed read. prefer stuck house, high risk person, it. husband would prefer work 12 hpur days making covid testers, essential. 

This PREFERENCE. Nope, me. Employer covers costs taxes lower. pay far less. difficult believe European Redditors? site made misinformed life US actually .... think could deal arm coming ass absolutely right. 

I live Europe - Munich, Germany. measures taken severe comparison USA. 

We still wear masks going stores use public transportation heard anybody protest it. People mostly use private transportation bikes now. 

The main goal stop spread fucking virus give services time respond find best solution it.

Wonder invested much testing, tracing, lockdowns given disease goes away own. Even surprising though, Taiwan Hong Kong seemingly helped China cover numbers.

Remember Taiwan repatriated 700+ Wuhan found 1 positive case? Wonder many random samples Houston try find fewer right now. Can't say that, given Spanish Flu. even people --- yes American cities --- knew wear face masks. Patients brought exposure sunlight help cure virus important precursor knowledge Vitamin play part stemming flu. also flu outbreaks, one came Korean War, another 1957, also got HIV, H1N1, Bird Flu others. sorts diseases spurted sorts medical technologies. 

We got used flu, gave up. left mid far right? ""some activist"", president Brazil. 

And people barge full wards highly infected patients film them. Insults thing  No, Patrick But..but, told leader Covid would disappear warm weather like magic!

I mean owner bankrupt casino expert infectious disease medicine not? $urely would rea$on lie u$ right? /s I'm San Antonio portion people refuse wear masks still go regularly. customer today without mask telling conspiracy theory number 33, freemasons, something ""lucifer,"" deep state. would rather fucked worked car else would validate nonsense?

With said please everyone stay are. Haha back March! week later, though, bidets sold also. ""fine,"" I'd hate see control. Yeah, lost job, possessions freinds travel restrictions. That's fuck get responsible thing lockdown. Air conditioning office buildings real serious problem spread. Houston summer heat joke air circulated constantly... like giant cruise ship.

No idea going solve one unless everyone masked 24/7 buildings everyone eats lunch outside cars.

The first order magnitude probably ensuring everyone properly educated virus spreads ways spread. Seems major disconnect lack understanding there. many people still eat inside restaurants proof pudding idea get exposed and/or expose others around positive. I've worked home since '14 like go much all. I'll probably waiting 6 months so, using masks rare outings. Outings highly crowded places. beach, gone bar. possible, need make easy everyone follow guidelines. spread student desks country?  school covered whole room desks 1-2ft apart, kind social distancing impossible. Also cafeteria locker rooms school always jam packed. Mind ask state city you‚Äôre in? go Karen, nothing scarier that. wish like everywhere else. NYC here.. glad know whole state acting like this. That's serious comedy right there. ass. hugged fucks sake wanna escape damn country used take driver's license get in.

Isn‚Äôt still case? They've gone hoarse past years. Good, Europe fuck Probably Americans don‚Äôt shut American not. pandemic around globe called pandemic. trust issue MSM since comment posted businessinsider news actually fake news.

Also, stop going news outlooks download opinion worldview. Usually American presidents fail political judgement quite good enough situation, example, Jimmy Carter. someone can't competently day-to-day decision making really weird.

Congrats Trump, turned us one shithole countries.  wildly politicized. Also making young kids put masks on...what 1st second grader going keep mask day obviously comparing deaths per capita total deaths.

Fine. 2400 extra also nothing like terrorist attack

The point is: people equally dead. country alcohol legalized literally committing genocide intentionally killing thousands citizens 

I would agree that, already know disastrous effects Prohibition.  Prohibition WORKED - would probably support it. Face shields look sillier masks, even concern.

That's certainly true fundamental problems american political system place extended last decades.

What Trump really shatter trust historical Allies US, brazenly expose broke system really much shit corrupt party get away with. one could catch glimpse maybe realise flaws could exploited. even GOP abuse system much shine light it. always benefit doubt party would go full actually working together president want's go full authoritarian. Trump willing make gamble GOP jumped train. mask exposed whole world see. believe me, western countries taken note act accordingly secure best interests. Including trusting US anymore, well knowing someone like Trump could come system fixed. US feel damage Trump done decades come. American, that's pretty cheap.

You're going ""fairly careful"". us plebs cattle class? dont really care, jacket first lady Texas voted office USA treating Mexico like poopy long time historically, even worse recently wall bad hombre talk. 

Despite that, Mexico still letting infected Americans visit party. Mexico like victim abusive relation ship say late night booty call (aka hotline bling kids say) refuse treat then.

I'll wait month see happens, hopefully nothing, anything reported local news.

Remember mitigate risks well gym personnel need 1 person infected (Asymptomatic) infect others. 

Outside MA, mass CoV testing. Doctors refer CoV testing unless obviously *show signs* CoV symptoms, absurd (talking you, NH)!   We‚Äôve made great progress. really waiting see continue drop numbers return indoor seating whatnot. Also, people could use sun, let‚Äôs limit outdoor seating least summer &amp; hopefully kill fucking virus. Ha! Jokes you! signed draft February 2011!

The future totally unpredictable stock value tied market performance all. bunch hopes dreams next year maybe stocks fare better cash.

That‚Äôs good hear that‚Äôs you‚Äôre seeing, specifically identified I‚Äôve heard anecdotes contact anyone lives familiar discussion region, idea what‚Äôs happening places like Netherlands formed hearsay.  Percent difference/reduction death treatment good (sorry, fieldÔøº). 

Thanks reference, looks like call ‚Äúhazard ratio‚Äù seems pretty likely less 1 (95% CI ~.5 1.05), better control. 0.7 means 30% less likely die study?

I hope would also follow longer outcomes, maybe hig enough study. Make happen? Homeschooling? Already happening 2M US kids. Covid Hi u/anomaly_BW \- David here! new pandemic, natural degree uncertainty data - scientific bodies upfront this. studies paint largely consistent picture, refined everyday. would say important look sources disagreement, try think critically data might resolve questions. 

I'll give example. UK, lot sceptics (including high-profile journalists) claimed Covid-19 different flu. case, would expect see high mortality rate period, compared previous years. start pandemic, clearly data resolve particular issue - now, shows we've least 65,000 excess deaths since March. opinion, refutes sceptical opinion quite convincingly suggests scientific concensus broadly correct. much would hate living Gulf Coast Galveston, needs happen Texas too. also didn‚Äôt expect people actually anything 9/11 except ‚Äúsupport troops‚Äù ‚Äúgo shopping‚Äù. Covid ethereal enemy requires 9/11 necessitated general populace. specifically mentioned social distancing original post also arguing virus burning merely observation. massive protests everyday people wearing masks clearly good sign obviously people still get infected It‚Äôs funny much liberal websites like Reddit circle-jerked Sweden last couple years yet there‚Äôs talk guys response unless it‚Äôs negative.

It‚Äôs Trump took stance wants open things people it. questions it. large portion society automatically takes opposite side party charge. I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm accepting way Sweden handles lot things I‚Äôve following method towards wish would done something similar. trained stock shelves, count 3 bags Doritos gallon milk. know hard is?! Yes that‚Äôs ridiculous idea ever. universal coverage everyone would pay price. that.

Every year get universal health care, every year create better safety standards, every year examined health care sole metric profitability. /r/lostgeneration would welcome open Boomers pulled ladder. put Betsy fuckin' DeVos charge student loan policy time closed bootstrap like war children...

We really need break cycle kicking problems road, make future better yet come. Way higher that. still lots unburned forest burn through. read question?

My question poverty areas experience relief addiction cycle?

It might bring hope future.

Poverty never defeated addictions dealt with. Dude wanted karma witty one liner. negotiated option drive employer wanted fly. tear gas makes worse. I'm close, somebody helps pay mortgage lease eventually reopen. Closing right option otherwise. make laws, criminals break them.

üôÑ ....December fall. That's winter.

And no, deaths trending downwards lag behind reported cases. They'll shooting back 3-4 weeks. Actually, know online education.

Including buildings? covering genitals public. able air on. mean, he's right though. labor physical. higher ranking jobs fuck all. work physical work. Management sucks. Paperwork sucks. political bullshit corporate structure sucks. I'd personally much rather turn wrench paperwork day. far know Sweden excepted opening. I'm Svalbard, sometimes bit hard keep track mainland doing. 

Thank you, we're taking day time keep fingers crossed Yeah... right... that's thought read headline.

Why feel need lie? people medical degrees seem think masks help, protesting safe I‚Äôm much inclined believe them, sweetie. think risk tourism. course states rely tourism others pushing reopen. come italy uk sweden even quarantine example.

But think need see different way. free movement EU citizens Schengen area since decades. long country/area matches criteria (being new infected per 100k, ICU availability, testing capacity whatever prefer) reason stop travel.

The situation monitored. germany locked area, country problem normal allow travel there.

Let's say cases spike italy. Germany rights say citizens go refuse italians. business tourism change much.

The problem tourism somebody lost job scared spending money vacation might top priority list. that's initial point: area reasonably safe not?

I see alternative. cannot close borders forever know best way control virus put head sand simply close everything.

We need monitoring, cooperation prompt actions needed. take risks. fail temporarily close areas learn lesson. woosch?  It‚Äôs Jaws quote lol no, way off. stop spreading dangerous misinformation. Medicare 65 paid taxes least 10 years. covers population.

Medicaid reached certain threshold income, determined it.

This change fact private insurances would still exist continue they've doing. UC would sent ER anyways, would ended 2 bills. last numbers reported mondays:

june 29: 5266

june 22: 2926

june 15: 1758

june 8: Yeah, that's crazy me. mean, let's honest, even though going ER costs $0, still place like hang out. always ""is worth time go, worth time look me"" kind calculation, least money never enters equation! 

Let's see, many times ER...

Appendicitis - removed within hours getting hospital

Heart going crazy - Luckily fine, family history heart disease taking chance

Baby stopped breathing - fine now! 

Other baby fever 105 - Also fine now!

Car crash - real choice here

So yeah, ""free"" mean hang time, can't imagine make choice. to, least Appendicitis would gotten much worse, since time arrived, withing short period bursting apparently (and definitely would held would pay thousands). people still call ‚Äúplandemic.‚Äù

Insulting. would anyone pay inflated NYC prices time near future? already proven people need commute every day much NYC's businesses built serve office workers. Buddy lives west palm posted snap beach day. shit PACKED. lot one thing though ‚Äî student loan debt

Feeing threatened life typically falls cases physical violence (assault, brandishing weapon, charging someone weapon, etc). also would dependent stand ground state... tendencies lower threshold feeling threatened. also dependent county judges bias crimes like this. Conservative judges tendency side people attempting protect liberal judges (this obviously generalization). jury used it‚Äôs air jury variety experiences would inform position.

So safe answer would would I‚Äôll advised clear cut answer. 

My husband attorney goes trial lot I‚Äôm familiar factors selecting jury chances dependent judge. aches pains endless. feel bones. feel like muscle joint pain. times pain turns numbness (dealing left fingers right now). fun random stabbing pains can‚Äôt quite figure they‚Äôre coming come where. kinda count :| science unclear. seen single formal study (and I've looked) showing commonly side effects people mild asymptomatic cases. I've seen lots anecdotal evidence small case studies, which, correctly point out, anecdotes.

I also talked couple people miserable, infected, one long recovery, one older relative die.

I also seen anecdotal evidence serious side effects vaccines, harder (but impossible) vaccine serious damage. 

So know risk I'm likely take, though I'll recheck known vaccine virus actually available me. old sick anyways. stocks doing. /S Masks help, end-all be-all seem think Yeah know California it‚Äôs matter medical confidentiality. information available employer employer right disclose anything isn‚Äôt public information.

So you‚Äôre swimming stranger‚Äôs spit snot. 

Does ocean socially distance? can't wait someday start. Personally, yes, I'm holding cash next dip getting dividend notices also nice. Good, vaccine rest us. It‚Äôll take losing someone care getting sick realize serious is. It‚Äôs awful people refuse see passed social bubble. I‚Äôm VA, people wearing masks distancing. illness arteries capillaries lung concentration products environment! think mean specifically 40(although moving countries difficult anyway) given kids and(presumably) spouse, presumably friends family live. big deal move another country leave friends family behind. Especially kids, would leave school friends likely never see again.

Plus spouse would need find job wherever move to, depending country need satisfy stringent criteria. They'd need expensive work visas know visas kids. work visas could difficult obtain require lengthy process, risk deportation lose job.  Wait mean happened... lost trust way I'm fucking done US response.

Essential workers risking lives House recess. apparently essential workers.

And Senate go recess.

And thing McConnell wants talk fucking vulnerable big corporations force employees work unsafe conditions big corporations need immunity cannot sue killing us.

And thing Pelosi wants talk fucking mask mandate.

We want close down. polls pretty clear this. majority want close down, ride virus safely, without financial penalty.

This course action that's best public health hospitals, essential workers.

And yet we're fucking discussing masks media owned corporations make less profit shut get articles masks. Oh wow, mean like almost everywhere else? spam sub! American culture definitely interest European‚Äôs genuinely interesting, really don‚Äôt understand much culture directly Europe. 

You listen UK music far think, Americans obsessed Irish, Italian food heavily popularised America, French architecture, like German cars, ‚ÄúFrench fries‚Äù Belgian. That‚Äôs thought.  Probably people given up. Explain five 38k figure track in-state tuition. lot states, like California Maryland, in-state colleges ultra competitive force students expensive state university, usually double 38k figure. doesn‚Äôt even account secondary education like paying masters medical school.

Still, agree general gist you‚Äôre saying. think college free entitled education, equating slavery pretty insulting. Anyone went college willingly chose take debt, even it‚Äôs much choice want career required degree. Still choice tho.

But worth noting can‚Äôt write problems American education system saying ‚Äúlife hard‚Äù. Working job isn‚Äôt feasible many degrees, even studies shown literally impossible pay degree working job, it‚Äôs different financial landscape parents faced. top that, student loans somehow one forms loans washed away bankruptcy death, fucked up. Yeah, they're mean blame mistakes. irrelevant top comment. Yes, people that, needs available access order online things like essential. think Italy lockdown kept gardening stores open? I'm still saying same. Look spread India.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Nobody knows shit virus, except perfect global pandemic, last years. Less 10th % global population virus. 100% honest you, haven‚Äôt went checkup talk doctor since battle CV. know sure I‚Äôm 100%. energy level same. Running, working simply work yard feels 3X harder ever before. like I‚Äôve dealing anxiety issues since kid. 

I‚Äôll hopefully build courage visit doc request full check up, case counts keep growing. Mostly I‚Äôm sure happens infected again. There‚Äôs many unknowns IMO oldest son (9yr) hit hard. We‚Äôre constantly watching oxygen levels since CV weeks first felt symptoms. Lowest point hit 81 stayed children‚Äôs sometime. I‚Äôll visit doctor need take wife kids. I‚Äôll keep waiting there‚Äôs chance spreading home again. Yes probably best idea deep CV scares living shit me. SARS exist humans, gave attempts produce vaccine it. 

MERS rare disease contagious caught people Saudi Arabia direct contact camels. People working vaccine it, there's much rush given minor disease is.

HIV unusual virus, easy one produce vaccine for. comparable covid-19. mutates rapidly, attacks immune system itself.  Covid-19 mutates slowly. happened, see twitter. ""Send um nursing homes!"" too. stories coming corona survivors left lifelong health complications reason enough. this, talked airline CEOs**, Mr. American Mr. United,** could flu possibly get plane. 

FTFY Trump. We're shaking heads disbelief american people going protest pandemic exist.

If leader said ""Jump window,"" looks it, many Americans would so. remember dealing Parkrun events UK. waited late could, stopped events, stopped across country - candid saying knew stopped some, people would travel, going far telling parkruns continue officially stopped, stop people travelling them. Covid-19, AKA Trump Virus, taken another ( XXX,Xxx) today... Well yes no, yes cautious post vaccine, virus severe vaccine (at least Oxford's) stops developing pneumonia SEXY BLACK!! Yeah everybody knows Chinese bad math. obvious nothing could possibly say would convey reality. Definitely lol. You‚Äôre headed France? France school don‚Äôt mind asking. I‚Äôll Paris parsons... hopefully  gets finds father flew Portugal meet him. shit Aussie, nearly bastard knocked off. Sux. snide comment saying US universal healthcare, Vietnam universal healthcare too. 


If genuine question, can‚Äôt say haha Article month ago. increased numbers even worse thought. Average flu deaths last 9 flu seasons 37,440 US. accuse people base can‚Äôt defend 80,000 flu deaths 2017-2018 season. report today places NZ forefront recovering nations. Hence blame ‚Äúleadership‚Äù.

There hasn‚Äôt clear message entire time. It‚Äôs shit show.

The fish rots head down. I‚Äôve decided stop birthdays won‚Äôt age. following lead. Anyone want join? Doctors fudging real numbers money (didn't know get subsidiary patients corona?). 

I believe either! first year vote, since turned 18 back March. Hopefully help fix mess hear type things throughout Northeast. Massachusetts pretty top mask wearing I‚Äôve heard. 

Figures much, data shows region country really one that‚Äôs flattened curve.  don‚Äôt deserve it. No, selection bias combined prevalence certainly does, especially specificity test could low press release, NYSDOH said test used survey specificity ranging 93 100 percent. Bruno declined provide explanation accounted range specificities give additional information validation process test.

So potentially bad test. let's look sampling methodology:

These samples taken people 
A) shopping grocery store peak pandemic NYC metro

B) willing take time day take test

These two factors mean likely get people 

A) either willing forced circumstance public spaces height pandemic

And

B) desire take test, possibly believe interested outcome.

This representative sample. even close.


Show high-quality peer reviewed study I'll totally willing accept. is, paper ever published study data garbage. Lots papers estimating IFR prevalence seemed based info, far know, paper ever published study itself.

I stand statement supposed 20%+ infection prevalence NYC conjecture. America center flat Earth government needs help something, stimulus checks sort rent/loan forgivenesses businesses shit gets handled, likely vaccine. Good. listened told us masks us good believed much many people refuse wear them. lied pretty damn difficult believe now. I'm unsurprised. Thanks much advice, definitely take easy possible( rambunctious 9 year old) I've seen studies saying masks effective, studies go say masks, combination measures like hand-washing, social distancing, contribute towards slowing spread virus.

That's good thing allows us avoid lock let economy work without overwhelming hospitals.  open minded fact something know little about. Like topic. Holy moly.. numbers still growing US?! guys. Corona becoming side topic meanwhile probably criteria get tested stricter. Stop spreading lies u know nothing area, whenever someone doesn‚Äôt know shit xinjiang talk Uyghur music dance culture, CCP, want xinjiang ppl dance open restaurants nothing els. spend 5 years Urumqi 3 Chengdu lot Uyghur Uzbeks friends. also made lots Zangzu ( Tibetan) friends Chengdu. European...... Same.  would build surge field hospitals, times war natural disaster. 

Lets forget medical profit health care system country. Somebody pay even worse case scenario. Says MSNBC.... joke. They're bad FOX. someone lives near lake confirm. Different kind beach. want throw ball dog, go kayaking, go fishing Lake Erie great. want swim sunbathe need ocean beach. üåàüêª goes back school august? Hey: Close bars people might start rioting. balance things probably concerned since people known be... well... nutzo.  Nordic countries hard get elected party dont masters degree political science. degree political science means taken pretty hardcore statistics course, science theory course understanding humanoira(Think called arts America?) natural science(think called science America) economics. more.

Some people also also lawdegree getting smaller numbers shocked many licensed attorneys plain dumb. really hard graduate last law school class get lowest passing score bar. Targets displays them. cloth disposable. first American state get hit mass cases

I would argue Washington state, perhaps followed California. dad way. reason haven‚Äôt talked 10+ years, tried catch recently see anything changed, nope. He‚Äôs still xenophobic piece shit watches Fox every night pounding whiskey. 

In morning he‚Äôd jump truck probably hungover fuck 8 year old me, pop good old Micheal Savage Limbaugh whatever alcoholic troll vomiting hate morning. Congress use power granted Constitution. Congress general ‚Äúpolice power.‚Äù such, Pelosi - well Congress would struggle - find constitutional way enforcing mask law. 

Even could lie cheat steal get law passed, would enforceable federal authorities could compel states act. Imagine living Spanish flu.

Or paying attention death statistics causes. may well ok. least mostly ok. odds parents survive bring virus back home infect them? grandparents. Visit them? boy/girl friend's parents/grandparents spread him/her. 

And also scenario young teenage gets rare horribly traumatic symptoms. ICU full. sure he's going get spot ahead old weak less likely make it. Triage afterall prioritizes likely make it. 

It's me.... I'll likely fine. Middle aged, known health issues. I'm regular contact least 5 others risk. convenience worth suffering worst case, lives. also say PA too. know depends region region, state really seems top mask wearing. thread makes worried, many people really hate country much? Like even taking shit hate looking good? Reddit sucks man. 6. Windmills cause cancer CB also pretty massive. Florida least 3 major cities (Miami, Orlando Jacksonville come mind)

The state 21-22 million people (approx). 3 4 million people short entirety Australia. 

They approx 4x many people state does. kinda wild. LMAO Well, fuck me. Going back Sweden backup plan since I'm really sick unsure afford health care need spirals much more. (I apologize advance length response. got rant.)

Thank red_byrd tremendous comments. hope I‚Äôm able convey thoughts eloquently done. 

I‚Äôve also read herd immunity numbers could need high 70-90%. 

In case, many good people die unnecessarily herd immunity developed. 

Also, like living things, mutations adaptations make simple herd immunity 60% tough target hit. Viruses change time response receptors attacked host body‚Äôs response. cite couple examples, consider Influenza virus, HIV causing virus, multiple strains affecting animals, strains Ebola, different viral strains pneumococcus. 

I‚Äôm medical professional attempt paint kind ‚Äúexpert‚Äù ‚Äúauthoritative source‚Äù epidemiology. 

My background includes disaster risk management. Back AD, knew US NBC Plan case nuclear, biological, chemical attack nation. long time ago. still want know plans there‚Äôs obviously attempt execute plans?

Is plan account large number casualties case nuclear attack scenario. Even military balloon ever went up, strategic bases communications facilities already considered destroyed exchange. Without releasing anything sensitive, assuredly sufficient time relocate base personnel time. general orders time keep base personnel families busy preparation move keep unaware impending disaster. 

What demonstrated past months lack focused national response. COVID-19 concern state borders. lack credible information different information coming many directions created air distrust quickly degenerated. American people lost critical thinking capability. large number refuse believe anything anyone doesn‚Äôt agree preconceived notions. 

From enemy‚Äôs perspective, US prepared biological attack. Similarly, shows American people easily swayed via various social broadcast media. Additionally, watching people throw hissy fits wanting wear face mask, even avoid large gatherings, laughable. aiding enemy using credibly recommended PPE distancing. 

If anyone seen bacterial colony Petri dish, might observed continued growth long sufficient nutrients environment available. However, come point colony starts die virtue colony‚Äôs waste. American colony starting die waste? vaccines said assumed 100% protection would obv wanted, means avoid risks sides, consider new norm, even post vaccine...

This deep 1 week ago mean? Yeah, obsessive reading pandemics past months, one almost seems like easy mode. real panic come get one high death rate healthy people kids. Hopefully one we'll actually learn mistakes. Save Economy"" going looked back extreme contempt fall. killed economy seniors hope stopping coming disaster.

Seriously. Especially lot experts said beginning dealing virus (increased testing, contact tracing, isolation, masks, social distancing etc...) way bring economy back. happen way, could done right things would see curve flattening like EU has.

As long federal government taking lead plan implemented whole country every state governors board get better. (I swear everyday hate states rights more) hell anyone would think countries let people plague hotspot enter?  Yeah, closed minded. Quite opposite, educated world travelled enough know talking crap. ""Mother, they're saying mean things internet."" kinda idea Australian Kiwis kinda like honorary East Asian adopted child frequently visits other, adopted child learned adopted relatives ways ethics. I'm also beachgoer despise bars. peace relaxation beach offers wonderful times like this. actually lay sun take naps delightful. Equating beachgoers woo girls right move.  would wash spray tan tho That‚Äôs okay, travel bans, best everyone cautious afford traveling days anyways That‚Äôs correct. He‚Äôs stupid, he‚Äôs evil. I‚Äôm exaggerating don‚Äôt use word lightly. never seen genuinely evil human life. Serious question, what‚Äôs point farming negative scores? Although don‚Äôt agree it, understand positive one sell account. negative do?  way things US going they're going need put overtime... would Hefty brand trash bag given human form Would great simple video game math built ability control degrees re-openings send jail. complicated: one right endanger public health I‚Äôm parent shady way presented parents every teacher every student would get choose whether wanted virtual person. get logistically that‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt work course teachers choose virtual parents choose person. Brabrand said teacher‚Äôs could choose. there‚Äôs requirements isn‚Äôt teachers, principals making choice teacher. Yes fuck can‚Äôt. Watch piece whites trash.  problem, living worse case scenario soon. figure SHTF fall colleges schools reopen pretend virus gone. interesting Flatten curve = hospitals ration life death services COVID-19 patients everybody else. Flatten curve = time develop better treatments even find cure.


But frankly serious answer time: times like really think USA screwed ambitious enough. focused much slowing spread, forgot possibility. 


Large regions EU China *and* East Asia found ways smother virus entirely. wish USA tried route, would've required incredibly severe lockdowns capable contact tracing.  RI pretty well too. always forgotten. would care? he's really Cersei ;-) nothing statement. think wrong impression saying.   unfair. already proved hospitals wouldn‚Äôt overrun COVID patients... 

...when shutdown. Pretty sure deaths dropping since early May. dunno, eco chamber sounds pretty nice. Wait, establishment suddenly wants decouple health care finance form employment status? I'm pretty sure exposed moral monsters 98% political spectrum ""leadership"" happens be. Maybe bad idea focus 40% already widely regarded monstrous. all, can't actually change things keep working obviously false information suggesting officials established power structure fix body counts like these. ?

Florida peak already.. sub really weird mods, Posts removed apparent reason. Refer comment below. Mod deleted article regarding pro-nuke proposal Yang, coincidentally opposite Bernie. also shilled Yang politics lot. didnt use vulgar language wrote lot pro-Yang comments got 15 days ban it. fair lot body builders I‚Äôve seen get screwed clearly steroids. Idk I‚Äôd willing bet plays big role considering laundry list side effects have. There‚Äôs also fact guys probably eating 5000-6000 calories day shed weight pretty quick experience food aversion seems pretty common COVID. leaders large amount inconsistency conduct - means even appears align ends justified - keep followers happy. 

Always keeping followers happy get group think leave least one visible loser group, enemy other, there. Typically end results totally useless resist speak out, extreme nepotism. really doubt anyone get arrested face serious consequences. Look Cheney. long acts himself? anywhere read GOOD news regarding virus? like keep updated it‚Äôs bad news, don‚Äôt want lose hope things get better eventually. meant said ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù America! Honestly, fuck bot. shirt

It going hard wear half smirk/scowl I've developed behind mask response dealing assholes masks come off.

""Why grinning like someone going enjoy murdering me?""

Sorry, forgot mask :P Andrew Yang? Ringed bell? Posted article pro-nuclear laws proposal hit delete 15 days ban shilled bit much there. dont believe me, Yang hated politics. Hold minute... thought statistics showed men die Covid-19 higher rate women. 
This free job positions women take... 
Or saying women first victims covid19 husbands son die left alive take care children instead pursuing carreer ? Never said everything fine Bengal. despise Bengal govt much despise central govt. However , said paint picture Gujarat example. 

This unrelated free ignore anecdotal parents doctors senior doctors working private practitioners part time govt hospitals full time. ground situation mentioned parents March April scary. potentially fatal even one conducting tests. Patients denied tests. Like usually want get surgery need get covid test doctors operating likely heavily exposed back ppe scarce doctors provided torn rain coats hospitals kolkata. least deaths reported ppe supply, people influenza like symptoms tested anyone going surgery also initially tested. even though situation good definitely better before. 

All said , 'certain' shall say, worse. BJP states, however , BJP states also included. hiding shit states said , optics. ever hospital? almost always run like that. Covid not. maybe issue tackle Covid. right anyways. Great point! also lot data sewage water smart thermometers well. think harnessing potential data could really help understand big picture. Honestly people don‚Äôt get see true side humans. I‚Äôve slowly building home gym even though free access employment. Mind 95% gym goers take care mindful environment people around them. 

But public health crisis trust 5% ruin everyone else? I‚Äôve got say shit started alright. allergy season started... developed bad anxiety. still anxiety go out. worry myself, people live with. It‚Äôs horrible feeling. Seeing numbers decline certainly helped anxiety, holy shit can‚Äôt wait over. near daily anxiety terrible wellbeing. mean, generational moniker. 

And actually generation, Millennials named mid-80s couple researchers kept fighting mid-90s whether named Gen (or even Echo Boomers) ultimately decided Millennials punch; probably aware since people feel like complaining generation adults. See book written 10 years graduated high school:  


Similarly still can't really decide want call Gen Z/""the Digital Generation""/Zoomers. pandemic made think less country many fellow Americans. can't assume best anymore. It‚Äôs way everywhere. And, saying stuff make true. No, people visible symptoms isolate way people severe ones.

Seriously, you‚Äôre pissing stupid shit is. ASYMPTOMATIC CASES SPREADING LETHAL STRAINS COVID-19. DIFFERENT STRAIN. Jesus Christ. fact asymptomatic cases self quarantining spreading lethal strains covid-19 exactly covid-19 evolutionary pressure become less lethal, like flu. Holy fuck, say one time prove you‚Äôre dumber sack bricks. started 3 1/2 years ago. didn‚Äôt think actually him? Exacerbating. Absolutely agree though harder picking one Federal government state governments placing hand scale force choice *profits*. expect change policy, least federal level. state level, may need backing Federal government... idiot mayors governors still allow thousands gather large groups, many without masks none observing distancing, protests country wide. Fucking idiots. policies violent cruel.

That's it. That's reason.

And politicians never care. lives hold value beyond slave labor inmate quotas.

And occasional human experimentation them. That‚Äôs I‚Äôm seeing. I‚Äôm traveling every week along east coast Midwest. It‚Äôs almost even. Many young people wearing masks many old. Middle age people seem wear most. It‚Äôs also interesting stores area mask use. recently Bristol, Virginia. Va mask ordinance. Walmart 50% wearing mask. Mostly 30s 60s were. Target 75% wearing seemed even across ages. 

First interesting thing masks mandated there, compliance low.I guess it‚Äôs couple hundred cases. Also Va doesn‚Äôt seem penalty non compliance. interesting thing socioeconomic difference Target Walmart customers seems directly related mask compliance. due expense difficulty buying masks? reflection political affiliation? differences education? 

I went rails bit there. I‚Äôm really saying experience people wearing masks 30 60 age range. spread thanks tons disinformation, especially media (CNN, FOXNEWS..) Merci l'ami ! No, that's is...

This rest world pointing Sweden saved economy following strategy nations successfully suppressed epidemic manageable levels.

We heard Sweden's economy going better rest Europe chose lock down... story changed ""their economy worse nations"".

In months time story likely change again... ""we've always war Eastasia"". isn‚Äôt Florida Man. Like said, certain amount legitimate labor associated day day tasks landlord (sometimes). landlord job like farming accounting - earth called passive income? owning property form investing?

It's small income owning comes labor huge portion comes sweet sweet ownership investment payback. Real estate management organization legitimate task, people paid that. manager owner two completely different things, even though usually many people 99% pay owner manager.

Like said another comment, tomorrow farmers magically lost ability farm would fucked. Everyone would starve death. Without farmers growing food would probably starve die. 

If landlord suddenly disappeared tomorrow? know guess toilet ever breaks would call plumber instead calling landlord could call plumber. never even happened I've living place years now. Essentially I've paid dozens thousands dollars somebody put little signature piece paper month. less true. Yea right lmao excellent news height?  know country still 1st wave?.. peaked yet. selfish.  kind level headed perspective hoping see here. Don‚Äôt think people going care unless deaths double historical daily average. US, around 7,500 8,000 deaths per day historically. COVID deaths get around 10,000 per day think might start seeing buy crazy people, think going party on. China must report least 1000 cases day eternity time! unfair get 40k cases day get 20, multiply x100 make us feel better! forgive every screenwriter, ever.

I wrong yell television. That's fair - hand, humane way apply pressure government sanctions? Bolton way would nuked Iran now. also assuming everyone insurance like supposed. People see racist tho. call home Lapland us Lappi, that's they've taught school (not Nordics btw, I've heard thing British German guests had) 
We still long way go curiosity, isn‚Äôt lot spread asymptomatic presymptomatic people?
If so, believe temperature checks particularly valuable?
What definition ‚Äúsafe safe be?‚Äù Isn‚Äôt just...false? could possibly safe activity? feels like rationalization feel okay going gym- it‚Äôd _safer_ home work outdoors away others, _want_ gym rationalize it‚Äôs okay. 

It might okay- particular gym mention seems like they‚Äôre taking seriously. think it‚Äôs downright wrong say it‚Äôs safest thing moment, clearly isn‚Äôt. Haha ‚Äúleadership‚Äù

Yeah terrible idea long run. also way prevent run masks operating within crappy political environment dealing with.

Hindsight fun easy.

But there, likely zero idea months (and 120,000 deaths) later people would quoting using date information justify reluctance wear mask.

It‚Äôs easy stand there, moment, think ‚Äúoh well majority America stupid take responsibility actions inform babysit them‚Äù work every day too; morning park. Outdoor spread seems vastly difficult. temperature checking wipedown stuff basically theater, since virus seems mainly spread respiratory droplets. current president trying get rid healthcare tens millions people, global pandemic, arguing court law Biden helped pass. 

the two sides same. shame you. Jr you? going lie I‚Äôm slightly embarrassed country. really hope guys pull stronger ever. üí™üèºüí™üèªüí™üèΩüí™üèæüí™üèøüí™ biggest issue air particles. reason indoor spaces kind dangerous. place people sweating grunting going soup potentially infected droplets, matter many times things wiped down. One sick person comes rest day everyone breathing in. Even good HVAC systems (outside hospital AII units) stop would 6' apart air circulates. 

You decide acceptable risk, change one dangerous venues. switched body workouts home jogging pay go back indoor gym. believe saying is:

You can‚Äôt put toothpaste back tube 

Now governor championed hoax intervention approach spring good luck enforcing peak summer long weekends Cases dropping? seen Florida's numbers? Look almost like spreads like virus! Instead tend see outbreaks driven specific spreading events, arbitrary sub-strain.

That probably depends region time ""strain"" Wuhan friend mine moved US 5 years ago NZ, recently started tweeting ridiculous whole covid ""hoax"" is. dunno fuck happened 5 years he's US, degree used work science communicator. He's 29. 

WHAT PEOPLE DONE FRIEND agree enforcing rule, sure I'm willing go far saying stripped office -- mean, support local sheriff's office willing work ICE, little hypocritical say enforcing law means stripped power.

(Of course, rationalization enforce one one, idk, sometimes consistency good?) would. Contact surfaces proven negligible source spread. Solo sports still sports. Ever heard skateboarding, snowboarding, longboarding?

I think one issue might miscommunication start outbreak - governments recommended use masks - might laid doubts difficult correct new information. (This quite common studies showing hard correct opinions they're already formed).

I think there's also confusion reasons masks protective (some chime well people's pre-existing political opinions). evidence shows mask good preventing wearer spreading large particles - necessarily good blocking small drops, already hanging air, entering wearer's mouth. primary benefit yourself, people around you. wear mask then, need recognise value ""social contract"" - curtailing liberty sake others - that's incredibly difficult people stomach. 

We know something challenges someone's deeply help belief, resort ""motivated reasoning"" - apply intelligence defent opinions (even they're wrong).

Seriously, why, anyone need help ""setting up"" iPhone? need help? say might potentially lead us health crisis. EU bit greedy too. Let's idolize faulty response too. tourism largest money maker EU, I'm sure influential factions waited see excuses could found reopen tourism 100%. 

Unfortunately greedy factions, US abysmal matter, there's excuse reopen. Okay guess sue CNN NPR encouraging people protest, despite week earlier saying went outside selfish, ignorant, etc... protests huge factor massive rise cases. coverage counter-intuitive public health goals, also public health officials mislead people signed document saying ""White supremacy lethal public health issue predates contributes COVID-19."" supposedly signed 1000 health experts. see problematic (hopefully).

1. 1.a person qualified treat people ill.

I've living outside US years, would still ban due passport even stepped foot States years? Today local grocery literally 100% mask compliance, store visitors maybe bit depleted sure -- less random 2 item type shoppers sure. damn joke. math curious... used worldometers daily stats used highest number per week (most peaks came Fridays both). I‚Äôm lazy every day...

Assuming two weeks confirmed infection (probably 2-3 weeks depending quickly state returns results) death, mortality rate dropped 6.5% last week April around 3.2% now, makes sense testing become available. Florida hasn‚Äôt maxed testing capacity (if haven‚Äôt, they‚Äôre close) they‚Äôll see roughly 33 deaths per 1000 cases. It‚Äôs bad New York‚Äôs numbers, best case they‚Äôll ~1300 deaths week 7/5-7/11.

Here‚Äôs scary part though... cases saw FL week tested last week. We‚Äôre already 2 cycles numbers. week 7/12-18 they‚Äôll lose around 2800 people, ~400 people per day. There‚Äôs nothing stop numbers. took 3 weeks see NYC‚Äôs cases slow lockdown.. FL takes seriously TOMORROW, they‚Äôre still going lose ~800day third week July, 7/18 worst day 1k deaths.

Just remember every 100 cases see confirmed, 3 people died don‚Äôt even know yet. Well remember...‚Äùthere life living‚Äù...üôÑüôÑüôÑüôÑ Mainers? least let Mainers move Newfoundland? faith numbers all. one, infections deaths data biased fairly substaintially towards women, opposite what's seen elsewhere. top that, daily % positive vary quite substantially. know mass testing larger towns, used q-tips running proper nasal swabs, going pretty much guarantee sample reads negative. childish nonsense Governor plan deal increased cases? I'm conservative even agree you. handed victory Biden. old Boomer's tactic. Always blame kids taking responsibility themselves. racism. hate us cause ain‚Äôt us /s live Queens too. haven‚Äôt gone much, go local deli, like 75%-95% people wear masks. Fox News, keeping senior in-laws terrified world (but ok politicizing virus). However say Obama would take guns. Remember that? /s bad takes long control politicians Yep.

Exactly. using allow Zinc cell block virus replication logical reason use it. 

These studies used late stage COVID patient already hospitalized extremely sick ventilators. virus already replicated thousands thousands times. It‚Äôs going help people. 

It‚Äôs concept Tamiflu. Completely useless given certain period. FYI anecdote hospital. staff test positive, 60 week later. days hundred front line staff home quarantine possible exposure. two months since we've hundreds positive patients, dozen deaths single confirmed case front line staff getting sick initial hit. Happened way hospitals area. admin infection prevention teams learn real fucking fast handle start dropping.

Now, heard last covid patient left last night staff positive 7k total system. pass. Peak logic lmao Please vote tho. simply shut infections? 

I mean stop signal shut statistics, clearly must smart people. one cared put mask ""Inflation happening rapid pace""

Not really:  anything things deflationary savings rate bumped some, especially wealthiest. That's ""pent demand.""

I'm saying going pain. is. think indoor restaurants, travel, tourism, hospitality toast. We're going see another wave layoffs white collar America. Eventually people start getting evicted probably we'll see wave foreclosures (the latter takes good amount time get going). let's prematurely declare high inflation depression get data actually showing either. seem think people physically hospital guarantees care, doesn't. many healthcare workers. cannot cover infinite amount patients matter much fucking Tetris play fitting inside rooms. course can. domesticated wolves generations. Scientists done prove it. What? Heck somewhere 20% 40% even realize sick. highest case fatality rate I've seen \~25% elderly people lots health problems (in couple nursing homes almost everyone caught virus). current estimates fraction people 50 end needing medical support? Maybe 5 10% (at 15%)? Definitely **minority** people get virus end long-term problems (such dead disabled). estimate far bans lifted? mean I'm assuming answer ""when people start taking virus seriously"" quantifiable answer always nice. really one greatest humiliations country ever suffered. Europe humored us years. rolled eyes Trump figured needed wait storm. something new. Yes, it‚Äôs safe let Americans anywhere we‚Äôre going wind longest chaotic outbreak virus anywhere world. something that, it‚Äôs recognition America terminally ill, ungovernable pariah state longer able take care itself, much less lead former allies.

Provide example. cite peer reviewed paper. making up/ agree spirit message, fairness, even best scientists still figuring things out. that‚Äôs normal. Even Dr. Fauci didn‚Äôt recommend masks healthy people beginning. know more.

I see easily hitting number, could much worse that. Even though information supply availability improved since initial outbreaks, South rural, much population old poor health, medical infrastructure nowhere near developed urban northeast west coast. things could easily get much, much worse. Well reports total number infected much higher reported death toll inflated, unsurprising people view merely inconvenience. certainty vaccine. could never vaccine. 50% correct, problem hospitals get overwhelmed simply enough resources decent level care leads far deaths. Put simply 2019 ""back normal"" next 2-5 years without effective vaccine, thus crisis would continue. ratio added experience reductions pathology comparing believing one true.

Freedom speech protects government censoring you, shield people choosing tolerate say. probably will, still suffer consequences ""free speech"" general population, say... governments. example, someone could make public statements foreign political leader country could legally deny entry country chose visit, based entirely free speech protected statements.

Similarly, right vaccinated, comes consequence. Like refused education private college or, access foreign country.

Further - bill rights give rights without limits. free pass. example, entitled freedom speech used incite breach peace.

Now let's look case Wire journalist 28 June, India reported nearly 550,000 COVID-19 infections 16,000 deaths. numbers galloping upwards last three weeks stringent national lockdown eased. outlook remains grim: **Ramanan Laxminarayan** Washington-based Center Disease Dynamics, Economics Policy, estimated September India could 200 million COVID-infected persons, surge infections rural areas migrant workers return villages major towns work them.

Mr Ramanan Laxminarayan made following prediction India PM believed official numbers #Corona wouldnt drawn World War II analogy,"" says renowned expert Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan #Mojo,""our model shows 300-500 million #Corona cases India, July end, &amp; peak, likely lose 1-2 million lives.""-a according 'expert' Wire cites India declared roaring success ~16k dead compared predicted 1-2 million. 

If would like go deeper, 10k 16k deaths (about 2/3) Maharashtra Delhi - led highly populist anti-Modi leaders. states account 1/10th India's population. Definitely 2:45 thought already agreed Sweden says matter. one particular thread said ignoring/ignorant risks - that's samey narrative sub tries push backed wall logic. Oh forgot go Florida California! need signs pictures properly wear mask too. Went target day saw geniuses mask covering mouth.

I woke morning symptoms headache (no temp 97 degrees) feel tired. I‚Äôm getting tested afternoon Walgreens. told dad (from distance) freaked out, mom annoyed family freaking COVID (more would say justifiable. It‚Äôs serious course, they‚Äôre little much) know deal worrying. dad immunocompromised it‚Äôs made pretty clear need house least till get test back. Okay fine.

Here‚Äôs problem. go? mom annoyed situation. She‚Äôs deal sisters calling constantly world ending daughter might COVID. wants take hotel get away wait out. think that‚Äôs stupid. wants ‚Äúprove point‚Äù

Here potential solutions see

1) sort hotel Airbnb throughly clean stay till get test figure something 

2) go back college apartment it‚Äôs five hour drive empty 

3) grandpas house empty (he died couple years ago hasn‚Äôt sold) live Italian/Irish family Irish guilt real there‚Äôs hullabaloo I‚Äôll inconvenience others since family members use house various reasons

3 seems like logical least 1 till get test 3 needed. questions this. 1) what‚Äôs best option 2) long typically test results stock market pandemic over? that's...not actual legal thing. well, might go mitigation lesser charges, get charges. According friend mine Hawaii, state shifted tourism budgets COVID response includes buying plane tickets visitors violating quarantine. one, point advertising tourism amidst pandemic two, plane tickets dirt cheap. state better strictly enforcing measures. It‚Äôs pretty easy g beach stay distant others. People cough others charged aggravated assault, however fight back prevent harm must proportional response. someone punched you, can't pull gun shoot unless fear life states. someone coughs you, able diffuse moving away that's do. continue pursue cough probably recourse given covid19. would literally way could stop someone coughing people/you punched. thing goes fighting. someone punched walked away stopped, can't punch back.

I'm happy service I'm really support.   Right! major English undergrad. hindsight, emotionally prepared college would done better taking years work. Instead got laziest degree could get least amount effort.

My master's degree hand specialized demand. tuition $25,000; take loans around $20K that. upon graduating, earning potential immediately double. ROI two years school less one year. worked master's degree cover COL expenses, boot, getting valuable experience tech support, laying foundation current career software team. started years ago. jumped jobs every year salary increase without issue. Now, admittedly bit location specific, every county region that. live near relatively large city work guaranteed. market, starved people. vacant positions literally can't find enough qualified people. ended hiring bunch first timers hoping learn fast, including new hires year.

Instead science ignored get worst worlds... mass outbreak/deaths broken economy. get bailouts anyway what's difference, least people actually helped time. Thank thorough reply. feel inclined agree many folks open changing minds. think need constant reminder genuinely wish change minds manner avoids antagonizing isolating conversation partner(s). Yes. need take reasonable risks. Stick large mega cap companies fine. Life risky. could die afternoon. Well played!
Even so, can't believe permission given large number people 'at risk' age group engage one dangerous activities known. entire states. guarantee that. Texas state lockdown aside business types.  means lot broader sense things. 

If young people ICU risk young people ignored, young people share equal responsibility acting appropriately. they're working next you. they're 6 feet apart. certain number members allowed time. 

so people imaging like beginning pandemic thinking things opening. nobody opening without pandemic mind everyone knows thing. gym taking precautions members aware what's going protecting other. 

again, sure i'm downvoted spite. i'm sick particular subreddit hatred logical posts sake going narrative of, 'GYMS BAD, HIDING FEAR GOOD,'.

It's like restaurant better regulated covid.

Dude...I sure losing. people know blame everyone else say Trump one knows doing. Especially Hanity Tucker Carlson spreading bullshit place study linked says people protesting stayed home, protests ended wash Covid cases. Protestors exposed, overall cases consistent. Whats ""may have"" shit? Herd immunity, eventually. survivors... Evidence continues show children ones dying here. yes understand sentiment. keeps getting horrible day corrupt politicians. cares people literally die long make extra money, right? Definitely went oh shit .. lol open ? America, powerful people don‚Äôt follow rules. sheer insanity. then, that's got point Florida anyway, it?  You‚Äôre assuming affected states reporting honestly. political motive report accurately. One did. young mother twins. GET r/all !!! Post everywhere. Trump administration FINALLY stated wear mask. It‚Äôs longer political. Make sure red family members friends hear sound bite. may listen science, reason Trump Pence only. I‚Äôll take step forward right direction (in case though) sadly far, far late. Although Netherlands they're bit subtle, they're completely ignoring scientists, seem erring whatever side caution fits narrative best. 

Initially took absence confirmed cases confirmation absence, became clear right thousands (possibly tens thousands) infections, finally took action (in nick time turned out) although dragged feet closing schools, even research validating decision came months later (thankfully sound smug revealing result, able control myself). recommend reading [NRC's exact timeline.

And they're charge deciding restrictions end loosen up, going erratically best. Thankfully without problems far, really worry long going take react next time. need check parks popular hangout areas like Dumbo flushing meadows. sooo many progress groups wearing masks. find hard believe covid roomies family. also ton people walking huge paths masks. I'm thankful people wear indoors least. Close bars, I‚Äôm early twenties friends give shits.

Early 30s, friends concerned surviving albeit compromised state spreading elderly grandparents. take much effort see 10-years-ago-me giving fucks, especially 10 years ago H1N1 pandemic, worked real good desensitize people threat pandemic...

That‚Äôs currently dire situation.... people followed protocol properly, socially distance treat Covid-19 pandemic truly is, situation would happened. Isnt American problem, President Ukraine former actor got famous playing President Ukraine TV show. cant make shit up. Oh pretty stupid . What‚Äôs point exhale valves then?

It's far lesser Karens US, still kinda shocked people ngl Prexisting condition! (I'm sure they'll say Trump gets way). Could tell two days worst? Texas going full Italy, see.. They're going need bigger hospital. Competent leadership United States could drastically lowered numbers important, think effect suggest together follow unified approach. absence leadership, everyone forms plan. Exactly! January honestly thought Trump going get elected. thought gunna hand ball Fauci, half ass thing barely job, get elected result.

He couldn‚Äôt help trying steal everything nailed ground.  don‚Äôt reason think covid need get test college requires it, places test even though i‚Äôm ‚Äúpriority‚Äù patient. wrong. soooo many cases never recorded effects fatality rate lots cases recovered marked such. already circulating population time CCP actually first one discover it.  course Bill Gates worried! needs people get ~~nanochipped~~ vaccinated

/s sub shitshow lol. Conspiracy theorists making fun doomers, doomers get salty respond. Meanwhile look like idiots lmao I‚Äôm sure. New York locked around March 22, cases didn‚Äôt peak April 10, seems like Florida could completely lock today still face weeks exponential growth.

However, someone else pointed New York, lot people weren‚Äôt tested arrived hospital serious condition, whereas people tested much earlier now, dynamic bit different. Oh okay, totally fine make get sick potentially life-altering effects.
That's much higher percentage 1%. People make full recovery.

Also, almost guaranteed they'll infected. They're working fucking hive germs. need exaggerate severity this. Teachers revolt severe increase hazard pay. disgusting expect work fucking pandemic without sort protection compensation. could start cutting administrative bloat that‚Äôs exploded last 20 years. Ministry peace. always war East Asia. won‚Äôt argue that. would actually wonder would matter, never know now.  ""Total authority"" ""no responsibility"" Wtf? aren‚Äôt. look every single day WA Coronavirus subreddit.

Full shit

Today‚Äôs update: guy updates EVERY DAY since February. ‚Äòhistorical‚Äô figures well. There‚Äôs also someone who‚Äôs coming MAs 7 and/or 14 Day Average, well County Breakdown. Essential workers excepted sure. say 20% people leaving house essential work 8 hours, 5 days week, we'd lot better 90% people whatever want.

It‚Äôs honestly bad anti-vaxx groups find one paper support batshit theories run away them. mean evidence outside protests entirely. MSNBC goes politicians science masks exhale valves defeats half point wearing masks. Rather capturing droplets moist breath, vents valve. protecting people around you. point simple -- airline deciding, now, pack airplanes without social distancing behaving irresponsibly, profitability expense consumer. Yes, AA airline abandoning social distance seating, accept singling unfair. AA one many abandoning passenger safety COVID era -- mean 'safety' mechanical flight disaster, something even worse, way -- trust major airlines excellent mechanical safety protocols -- must. kind safety different issue. Passengers people, everybody lies defies. We're era people show fake ""immunity"" cards, idiots refuse wear masks public despite overwhelming evidence masks drop infection rates. People stupid, need rules based rational science comes threats public safety. now, American Administration wants profits first safety second, would hoped corporations like US-based airline would balk idiocy. strip rules ensure equipment 99.99999% safe fly. virus infects kills people distanced masked. Airlines packing passengers like sardines decades pump bottom lines, made shitloads money. I'm fine sardine 6 12 hours -- big deal matter discomfort. increasing rates infection pandemic just, plain, irresponsible. So, fuck airline packs people pandemic, fuck airline allows passengers take masks. OH! MEALTIMES? put least one seat passengers, alternating columns, staggered mealtimes, maybe least might make difference. none truths matter corporations, idiots charge US moment. fine policies ensure illness deaths. Why? tell -- looks like want people money keep money. hire replace them? get around union easily. amusingly ""much much much smarter"" still covers 99% world population.  high bar lol Yeah need pray Range Rover  Money. Kellogg General Mills basically funded Food Pyramid curriculum.

Guess who‚Äôs big fail now? student parent, I'd want know tuition refund policy prior enrolling. Although students generally younger less risk, possibly get sick. Maybe get sick enough hospitalized, still sick enough get knocked ass couple weeks. might long enough they'd miss exam, get behind coursework, etc. university going give least partial refund? Allow students drop classes rather fail them? Need details. Still proof Chinese numbers fake. Meanwhile, passes Benford's law US shady government fakes numbers. Yeah. Imagine walking around feeling paranoid like that. He‚Äôs got terrible boss. dont know trump lied greater good. greater good. faith average Americans. really think health organizations around world recommend lowering saturated fat based inconclusive studies statistically significant? would this?  sure it‚Äôs alone, he‚Äôs encouraging dangerously bad behavior. cohesive grownup response crisis would saved lives, question. virus gone away. lurking. 

And moments might dangerous others, vaccine potential victims. Ah, care affects you. see. note- many regions entered phase 4. We've outdoor dining month, numbers continue decrease. includes big protests throughout month well.

We started indoor dining two weeks ago, still havent seen uptick, though I'm still weary going indoor bar think spike still might happen. 

The thing is- almost every business following regulations people following rules. Everyone masks public places indoors. 

My hospital- biggest one Rochester, NY epicenter COVID pts- officially noone ventilators first time since pandemic hit. entire county less 100 hospitalizations. Finally, 23 people tested positive past 24 hours.

Really, really hoping trend continues. say, county curb stomping virus day one. actually locked-down four days earlier NYC, first one reopen phase. We're showing possible semi normal life regulations put place followed businessed general population.

Im fucking lucky living region consistantly taken threat seriously. We're reaping benefits today that. Bars probably bad idea still. can't really drink mask on, frankly actively destroying judgment process.

But yeah everything else fine Cos see bomb blow shit news. PPE means healthcare workers don‚Äôt get sick. doesn‚Äôt get viewership figures.... Wouldn‚Äôt drive little order go bar? Wouldn‚Äôt spread even more? decide gets idiot Nope research restaurants go eat, painfully obvious see ones incredibly strict rules, ones aren't. Coincidentally, ones already think cleanest ones following rules. you? even look, target trump. Maybe he's actually worried get less help trumps dirty work make things look fine. far Florida. think surpass NY soon, pulling peak NY #'s without shutdown. implies things gonna get really bad florida soon  can‚Äôt automod truth New Yorker, knew fucked virus even hit States. populated city, relies heavily public transit, literally way stop outside closing city single case reported. would major backlash people still believe virus. initial response good? No. much Cuomo pain ass, actually comforting see handled compared states. Online classes take way work well. cutting pay. MD terrible cases people taking seriously fuck. see people even wearing masks walking outdoors. new excuse death rate goes up?

""It would much worse without current leadership, 250,000+ deaths best could since bravest nation world"" Glen, you?  Love Trump responsible according reddit. 2 fucking week ago suddenly cool gather thousands protest shit anyone pleading restraint damn racist. going get it, bothering stay home? get get with? many kids continue home schooled, many people continue work home.

The bottom line Federal many state governments continue fail miserably. Hong Kong, much densely populated US, seven deaths. Singapore, 26 deaths. possible contain virus. Unfortunately many people US selfish, know ‚Äúmuh rights.‚Äù difficult know, kind action Sweden would legally able do, Sweden public health agency wanted take hard actions, instead current agency mostly wants avoid Swedish Constitution mandates government agencies work independently government relevant expert agencies must issue advice prior government actions within agency's area, case aiming prevent spread virus, strong mandate expert agencies initiate actions, avoiding rule Tide delicious, bleach also good way cure COVID. Though prefer pods, hard inject. Fifteen, soon zero Liberty Death. American way. countries want handle Coronavirus different way, let them. Different laws different jurisdictions different laws different populations. 

Meanwhile, live known risks take educated true nature country. Neither society government duty protect (see: SCOTUS cases Deshaney v. Winnebago County Castle Rock v. Gonzales). like not, nature nation change pandemic. Amplified perhaps, changed. God, love country. glad became citizen. Nothing final get phase 3 results, even followup past 2-3 month timeframe needed evaluate longer-term efficacy. Yea u also cant control virus wants well.. duh This. seen strict countries like SK China way stricter policies. still there. scary part cant figure unless stay people asymptomatic long time. top head UK least Idris Elba talking infection take serious. I'm sure Boris Johnson got attention people well. Novak Djokovic set tennis tournament Croatia Serbia fans likely thinking safe. Vegas?! need close casinos first need PUA. Yes trumps base refuse ever wear mask. surprising that's 7%. Perhaps country actually concerned virus. obviously south american love FARC. Unfortunately see many grocery store wearing 1/3 still don't. really wish state would make required public. since seeing rise case rates going have. talk grocery store manager employees wearing though. felt like epitome Karin afterwards.  I'm using numbers reported 

I aware reports 6 24 *times* many cases recorded.

We access unknown data model it. disservice try speculative data.

What us model data published numbers available. say ""wrong"", source unreported cases, can't model unpublished values. 

All I'm modeling results cases US time obtained data, 4:30 PM CST, Sunday, June, 28th, 2020.

That's point here. Model outcome cases already know see get. 

And modeling data total active cases 1,409,317 10%, 10.5% 11% death rates, gives us amounts deaths.

##US Coronavirus Deaths Modeled Current Deaths + Current Active Cases 
Death Rate | Total Deaths 
:--|:--|
10% | 269,300
10.5% | 277,051
11% | 283,393

It's utterly terrible even without new cases know come even without factoring additional unknown cases. covid ""blown proportion liberal media""

Do think still case themselves, elderly family &amp; friends come virus? Hey AIDS ARDS one letter away, never know! /s  fascinating, aware this! stopped following Bolsonaro news around January since US DR‚Äôs political drama got big took time.

Do info this? I‚Äôd like read Exactly. government country listened health agencies, scientists economic experts, *then* informed public devised strategy based input sources. super well, pretty much totally opened (with common-sense restrictions ofc) weeks now, surge infections. got mine cool....  seriously folks, mental health joke take care other. sad died. still enjoy bit irony, even wish *just* gotten sick recovered. Pain instructive, hard learn death. least tial new York tourist South get back home Health care cheap get better own. die.  Sorry didn‚Äôt mean aggressive lol people trying paint rosier picture reality wholesome! Good her.. Oh, sure. think it‚Äôs even simpler that: 35-40% Americans live alternate reality created mainly Fox News. clock ticking union US. give 25-30 years 50 states break coasts middle. curious trump gonna insult pence yet New York did.

How say shit like empirical evidence possible calling daily basis. reinforces idea social distancing works preventing transmission protests lack intimacy affection. family gatherings drinks bar people opposite. lack alertness casual. Honestly personally believe this, think tourism based economy want tourists come back. Kitsap Co even worse, highest wearing rate I've seen maybe 30%. since state mandate yet though. live rock?

ICUs beyond capacity that's deaths start ramp up.

Did learn nothing past three months? really, like wannabe pop singer. Shallow garbage music geared toward least intelligent , I'm surprised turned concert. Good speaking out. people listen scientists doctors' warnings, maybe they'll listen peers. Permalockdown baby!!!  Although you‚Äôd probably change tune WiFi went down.

I‚Äôm pretty safe, follow social distancing, don‚Äôt eat inside restaurants, wear mask, wash hands, don‚Äôt touch face mouth, limit contact surfaces. still work, go outside, go stores, work out, go bike riding, see close friends family outside. It‚Äôs 4 months top 10 county growth nation top 15 state cases (Iowa). We‚Äôve blm protests, full state opening 4-5 weeks, Memorial Day, etc. 

It‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs serious, it‚Äôs jumping trees getting you. know takes one person far good. need break mental health living fear cage. sure sign medical system verge total collapse.. That‚Äôs disgusting comment. We‚Äôre best nations- world. great vaccines unbelievably incredible work wonders many many people. Many many people. They‚Äôre best drugs anyone ever seen. best world. Sometimes people say I‚Äôm best. They‚Äôre like ‚Äúoh Don, you‚Äôre greatest president country ever seen.‚Äù that‚Äôs I‚Äôm president. I‚Äôm sure George Washington would say I‚Äôm 2nd best, many many people would disagree that. really think he‚Äôll lose? Yeah changed it.

I got confused roughly 20k weekly tests May. 10k day leading 50k week, 250 percent increase last month. Chances catch cases article also comments on. I‚Äôm sure passenger going completely honest. doubts ability American people right thing.

Dont cite nonsense.. panhandle near 30A/ destin/ PCB familiar area. like here, stay far away ""touristy"" area possible. instance, Publix near swarmed tourists wearing masks, distancing etc. go bridge town (less people want be/vacation), publix much better. would suggest using delivery things like grocery stores restaurants staying close home much possible. Avoid b/c tourists seem think virus disappeared.  Lol üòÇ thanks mental picture woosch woosch! Control group right quote:

The article linked preliminary study dated couple weeks earlier article linked. ""no evidence"" time, changed new evidence already linked later article. calling people fly not-spoiled something? understand fucking privileged position able fly even poorest seat plane?

I'm spoiled baby entitled Reddit loser brat makes $21,000 year I've never plane quarter century.

If life, spoiled. non plane flying fuckhead like expendable global economy. stay garage fan? What? 30 many, definitely got pretty lucky there. reason school charges online classes Yeah, that's pretty typical things start getting hand testing scarce - save living. predict new virus outbreak hotspot. WTF wrong people? Effing grow already, entitled little brats business model. want lowest prices, get those? 3 suppliers offering fresh fruits/vegetables (say strawberries), offer lowest price that:

* bad quality begin with
* sat trucks/warehouses longer whatever reason, trying get rid they're worth anything all
* suffered issue makes buyers want less

Though, even canned/jarred/frozen items, producers often create entirely new SKU sell Walmart use cheapest ingredients make them. China testing consequence different strategic approach driving toward eradication virus - China intends find isolate every single case country order prevent possible spread. US not.

USA's strategy ""run around yell, hair fire."" Yeah, St Louis guy mid 20s, friends lazy masks distancing. give shit going bars, wineries, restaurants, house/lake/boat parties change last summer. Literally one friend, me, girlfriend ones still avoiding types things, makes efforts feel futile. said ""Slightly"" reason. me, big issue tools already. literally go apartment maintenance job investment tool wise. 

*I* can, job currently varied amount things. I""m going school electricity, plumbing, AC. Even i'm going better working live means starving. 

Times going desperate soon. ""Slightly"" may mean difference life homelessness soon. 10 years prison immediately. Changed life prison victim dies later on. would fair. time! sorry, verbatim ‚Äúbet ya signed dollar true‚Äù. put money name belief diver ‚Äúpedo guy‚Äù. laws dumb too, reason obey I'll shot otherwise. imagine mean well, argument victim blaming. left important thing : MASK REQUIRED (OR MASK PROHIBITED).

Give big hugs thanks! said entered work force full time. kinda made assume phrasing job. laid 401k? That's SCOTUS. reference, 2003 SARS (also corona type virus) outbreak around Asia, till day still vaccines, specific medicine. took roughly 2-3 years reach mask free, people still wear mask illness. Covid-19 rumor start spreading Dec Hong Kong people still panic buy tons mask, wear everyday till today went urgent care last year going $125 pocket $60 copay take chances insurance. Went copay ended getting bill like $300. literally walked in, doctor looked finger wrote prescription antibiotics. Took 10 minutes. basically get experience exact thing back 2008/9.

The biggest difference Millinials point still believed College good route go ride depression, come end good spot.

Gen Z kids sorta option, college looking hot Covid times, see well worked Millenials re-evaluating _is_ good option go college try ride dip. 150 month hot yoga? That‚Äôs kinda steep no? decisions start making Italy.

There's normal triage, there's *this.* Seriously. can't imagine giving someone savage beating this. don‚Äôt understand. planting gardens solely prove point, point would making? whom? Tedros judged crimes humanity. people told do. I've Harlem whole time. Back March ambulances every 10 minutes. Building across street us meatwagon come 10-12 times. Couple big families union got hit hard. Old, young, gone. Anti mask folks shot. Fuck em. Save America! Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! 

-The US govt PSA campaign plastered media platforms. extrapolate extremities like hands/fingers too. article read weeks back lady cleared virus 65 days infected. would high blood pressure one arm, low blood pressure other. White fingers one hand, bruised swollen fingers other. Pretty crazy, atypical case. Hard shows survive even 100% capacity. figure risk performers getting sick plus diminished tourism city, think makes sense. really understated obstacle really counterproductive harmful.

And much bigger issues. CARES Act provided waivers people need treatment testing.

Those expiring.

And hospital bills hundreds thousands dollars. ‚ÄúNovember‚Äù? last line one reason like aggregator sites covid data ones minimal analysis (just sort stuff could excel took effort) rather listen politicians blame group group went drive-in Garth Brooks movie/concert deal Saturday, lot fun, got much shit friends buying media‚Äôs ‚Äúpanic porn‚Äù, wearing mask would walk beyond parking space, using hand sanitizer couple anyone else friends think it‚Äôs complete bullshit, giving shit trying safe? Frankly, half guys lost jobs see think it‚Äôs crap, think shit human call friend paranoid thinking it‚Äôs all‚Äôs grand conspiracy wanting protect family..

Cut life. seem care health care theirs? told woodworking might save life one day, listen? could get tests show pretty short article. Enjoy cases then. goes show lightly taking situation. Yup, last saw basic science like 1/5 1/6 R&amp;D costs. rent will. Nobody asking rent them. It‚Äôs called business. world split two halves - countries deal it, can't screwed.

At point looks like: Either country handle it, can't. institutions culture population needed deal corona, going get it. *laughs Florida* Lol, one guess, stupid analogy comparing virus human enemy. Yep. foget paying planned parenthood, social services, food stamps, Medicaid... would disagree. ages 18-22, depending went work high school, trade school, college - get out. Forge ahead, make path, start life. Governments hiding numbers worldwide, maybe 1 million already died. world 7 billion, math. Uproot life bad advice. 

But yes, offering dissenting opinion internet usually lead debate argument. new? keep media, saying climate? bad virus care opinion. 
What works, works. admit, applied north 30 jobs graduated. got calls back one. that's takes. went job fairs one called back, etc. discourage people away fantastic career getting first job requires lot effort. 200 dollar bill person chose pay cash bother spying Medicare/aide qualify bother paying government mandated insurance. 6k charged insurance company. thing happens car needs repaired covered insurance, charge subsidize cost people pay via insurance. super rich hop private plane go hospital another state to. simple. young give elders. corrected blunder. point still stands. drug would way expensive average family afford, let alone lower class. Good 1! 50% capacity probably wouldn‚Äôt enough break even, probably would many people allow effective social distancing. Buuuut, DeSantos said infecting young people? I'm confused, spread young people old people something? governor wrong? Whaaaat?  outbreak starts one giant retirement communities like villages it'll devastating. Yeah entitled mindset led Florida Texas they're now. ""You whatever want, cause freedom want !!!"" Nevermind countless business lost SiP thousands died. Fuck right ? long get make choice thing despite pandemic. disrespectful way postmortem testing? Take swabs test later? sort viability issue? ""Here stand, mountain dead"" Yeah feels good would jeopardize everyone else's lives get coming result actions. Religion politics might fun game Fox news watching Trump supports way aligned reality comes virus. want point right's fault. protesting could well biggest cause amount rising cases covid US. get wrong source information could wrong, probably made beds quite literally every state go protest time like this. good luck yourself

That's exactly idiots Facebook calling hoax saying. meaningless. Listen experts. picking i'd pick number 2 get away everyone haha job? I‚Äôve laid months due COVID

Live event industry first hit choice mask up. Whole lot ways get 95 percent law. fist simple education advertisement. people knew masks important, confidence science, would likely wear masks. design contest logo mask Florida produces hands people free. sells. Whichever. Slap midget coronavirus costume giant Grim reaper costume go around educating people masks. Hand 10 Starbucks gift cards. Start mask lottery. Florida loves lotteries. Hand tickets people wear masks. politicians setting example going beyond. Indeed politicians TV Florida antrashbjob social distancing mask wearing. People mirror that.

And ideas. entire branch public health deals sort stuff. kind stupid US carried almost 31 million coronavirus tests, according latest Western country, significantly less China's reported total 90 million.

China testing consequence different strategic approach driving toward eradication virus - China intends find isolate every single case country order prevent possible spread. US not. performers talking dancing three hours straight? Trump America's #1 pre-existing condition.  Trump punching air Oval Office right now.  Fair point. literally already once? Obviously needs still, literally happened. Student here. open bars, casinos, restaurants, college campus ample room distance classroom? 

If limit students‚Äô ability leave campus, essentially becomes population. there‚Äôs outbreak campus, immediate quarantine dorms switch online classes period time. Theoretically, students arrived weeks early mandatory quarantine, wouldn‚Äôt cases begin with. Even syllabus week week fully online, would theoretically work. 
The plan I‚Äôve heard student faculty member feels unsafe option teach learn fully online. guarantee almost lectures fully online that‚Äôs type class works for. 


The issue becomes people rebel host frat parties, I‚Äôve read masks mandatory pretty much time campus, spread would minimal.
I understand elementary schools middle schools shutting semester, high school especially college students cognitive ability follow rules realize privilege getting kind ‚Äúin-person‚Äù education, lowest risk groups virus. job offer 401k? craziest aspect Americans let happen long, refuse vote someone willing fix it. Also pandemics generally burn without infecting entire population sampling symptomatic patients, known many asymptomatic, make difficult extrapolate results general population?

What positive rate threshold would trigger generalized testing? clearly defined math, logics statistic, one health policy? ikr thats keep saying ‚Äú magic? ‚Äú saving impossible? hard impossible sounds like enough information. believe fly

I believe catch Corona sky

Cough every single night day

Thinking hope make vaccine day LOL what? Yes Everyone know went regularly multiple times week going back (that's \~20 people). course us 20s/30s. 

That ignorance of/or ignoring risk. 

You presented anything logical. real logic play here:

* one immune
* Young people also risk
* Young people also getting critically ill dying
* Going Gym, going out, going bars restaurants irresponsible foolish.

The evidence apparent. Cases spiking across country, worse locations eased restrictions, Hospitals ICU's rapidly filling nearing capacity hot spots, young people primarily responsible. going out, going gym, etc. officially irresponsible dumb ass.

If want try argue that, means go ahead. happy shut real logic, facts science. Georgia done well covid. Surprising given doofus Governor is. facts facts. Gay frogs?

Disgusting. chargeable least misdemeanor Thats gonna take century start happening. doomed America profit health care system. millions millions people country health insurance?

Do think run hospital get tested feel ill knowing cost 200 6400 fucking dollars more!? LOL! depends lot factors, like convince people wear masks stop going bars, treatments vaccines become available. Best case scenario, might vaccine December, pandemic spring. vaccines don‚Äôt come soon, we‚Äôre going rely masks distancing keep numbers down. chose go school lol 2 MRIs recently used insurance. can't recall exact figures offhand, something like $900 cover pocket total around $4-5,000 billed insurance. 

A fun one recently noticed primary visit bills new bizarre charge ""emotional behavior assessment"" added $10 every time saw doctor. called asked appointments nothing asked nothing emotions/behavior. lady said ""oh that's fill paperwork appointment there's question asking experiencing depression. want billed charge answer question.""

I've getting mask safety glasses, face shield ideal. 

Frankly, saw PPE on, think ""goofy,"" I'd think ""responsible, good person, able find proper N95-type masks stores

If use regularly, N95 masks necessarily great solution, anyway, since understand can't washed (damages filtration), sanitised via ways. places using hydrogen peroxide technology expensive high tech, though ultraviolet exposure may also solution. looked yet. 

From understand, face cover prevents nose mouth coming contact large droplets (e.g. coughs, sneezes, people can't talk without spitting) good, mask reasonably good-fitting help lower amount smaller aerosols come contact with, also reduce chance infecting people infected. transmission via air (and reducing risk it), there's good video watched: [How Lower Risk Breathing crazy infection rate people live, might need ratchet strategies needed. ironic considering happened last couple centuries you‚Äôd think he‚Äôd want safety people wearing masks, aren‚Äôt even half assed federal response help first time. They'll say gay frogs found using 5g towers harvested organs hilary. terrible idea.

You can't use young healthy people phase 3 know precautions gyms taking? believe, precautions, gyms opened safely. go climbing gym. wash hands enter, take temp get in, masks required activities (climbing, weights, treadmill included), liquid chalk encouraged alcohol based won‚Äôt irritate lungs like powder chalk can, routes alternated every 3 days, gym 25% capacity, roller door open better air flow, make reservations limited 3 days week, gym crew wiping equipment multiple throughout day see running around practically whole time I‚Äôm climbers agree contract tracing. hand sanitizing stations throughout whole climbing area bring sanitize climb.

We dont even locusts US complicating things. Yet. :( But... many lucky enough get haircuts bespoke cocktails. Looking fab-u-lous ICU. kind response ""That's good"" reduces credibility side trying convince people safe. worse 2 days numbers reported together, individually reported. 

I'm side deniers, means, feel like can't trust side, either. sides spin shit needed advance agenda. really understand why. need spin anything, facts speak themselves. Spare hysteria, I'd like objective facts here. 1 days numbers + 1 days numbers 2 days numbers. 

Please, u/BumblesAZ, would please explain need make sound worse is? missing something awful really two days numbers reported once? know person amount time? I'm offering suggestions, negative fuck. shit, pretty much testing people required hospital treatment.

Antibody testing NYC indicates 20% people infected yeah, total number NY state probably around 4 million infected 1 month ago. 

Well way herd immunity. someone without mask coughs they're 6 feet away like diagonally
And walk area...(aisle grocery store) mask 2.5 pm filter, glasses, chances contracting virus?

Grow up. Im trying understand post. protest huge gathering, yes can't fine protesting.  hanging out, specific reason. shut beach say can't gathering hang fine totally different protest. ""we keep infection rates differently 'round here"" I'm pretty even-tempered, handful times 32 years I've *truly* furious, I've never deliberately lashed someone (except like, verbally w/ mom teen, which: teenagers &amp; moms), customer service persona nice, lovely understanding etc! 

Truly think I'd lay hands someone me. likely I'd try escalate verbally try get lay hands ME, that's brain seems work I've truly enraged handful times, yeah. would definitely make situation lot worse, truly think I'd able stop myself. I've drunk ahole dude spit kept check then, PANDEMIC happening!!

The scale dehumanization just...absolute disregard human decency and, given could infected, LIFE, just....beyond pale. 

Wish they'd press charges. Groceries big worry. gradeschoolers. little carrier monkeys gonna bring back yucks. best possible way dealing armchair experts. age group personally think really bump all. doubt spikes like NY. likelyhood death (IFR) age group is

With well bet overloaded testing sites/labs I'd put money willful negligence.

Normally I'd agree you, Arizona resident, I've seen first hand effect politics situation here. I'm pretty sure shut things people dying streets -- even political base stepping bodies claiming fake news and/or somebody else's fault. There's huge incentive government make numbers look better.

In political climate growing increasingly nasty, toxic, outright dangerous, easily see numbers fudged ... health department going, ""We like numbers, \*fix\* them, we're publishing \*fix\* ... \*hint hint\*"" No, that's point phase 1. Phase 3 even including placebo control, full vaccination goal certain amount people get sick. analyzed placebo vs. Vaccine. That's volunteers important part process aware may get sick fully informed.

Phase 3 trying see effective whole population, well sniff unusual side effects. cannot call effective know effects elderly children.

I'd super concerned seem care effective safe young, healthy people. dry weather people. year living Vegas, would go jeans loose shirts despite 90 degrees 1am US manipulating data hiding true death toll. Bars essentially restaurants whose sales skewed heavily towards alcohol rather food products.

Just reasons former vary. really hard workout mask decent shape. corona people used purposefully train one. North Carolina looks like flat increase. Measures like:
- Improving Contact Tracing
- Target shutdowns high infection areas
- Walking back reopening steps
- Improving mask mandates
- Good public service announcements. mean say ""The situation deteriorating, need everybody careful again."" polish.

Regardless, coronavirus shouldnt out. 

It revolves around alternative people dont like prevention mode atm.

And may ask yourself...

‚ÄúWell, get here?‚Äù Probably true. team learned months since then

So absolutely none medical/scientific knowledge could inform leading this? guy either liar, completely incompetent. China did. Chinese officials literally trapped people homes welding doors shut. House fires medical emergencies damned! like dangerous precedent. 

This astounding, I'm another thread arguing redhat morons think going concerts Olive Garden constatooshunal right, I'm arguing people like who'll justify anything long means nobody get think bad. 

There's middle ground involve either these! believe too. That's time military. I'm entitled it. Also nowhere near 10 cubic feet lols. little outline scooped 2 cubic feet. gyms Northern Germany live opened 1 1/2 months now. However like couple new registered cases day tops (yesterday 0) population almost 3 million people. feel pretty comfortable going gym. completely different story US though. numbers way would going gym.  Chase singer? work facility, full time level 1 employees get 500. notification say anything 3k. pandemic. able find workout routine home without mask. make temporary sacrifices certain indoor things cause lot spreading. I'm sure many ways get awesome workout home. Hershel Walker (former NFL football player) workout comes Los Angeles County set free testing anyone wanted it. Well, examples randomized populations confined area show untrue. look cruise ships. American me, wonder nations handling fav sports? top 20 countries performed well mix democracies authoritarian governments. mix first world developed countries developing countries, mix high population density lower population density.

The type government simply matter.

What mattered whether government care enough people something.

That bitter pill swallow America, means believe authoritarian governments China caring people, wrong.

That disconnect believe reality America still got control. really understand filing taxes work live outside US, buy/earn money foreign currency, still need file US taxes? Probably built speaker. OK, i'm gonna need shipment samples, Liters please. i'll publish findings online, free world course. Yeah think could fine HS/college, younger kids, missing socialization huge problem. ain't pretending shit. Let's take basic logic

Step 1. Lock people inside 3 months

Step 2. Open bars

Step 3. People go bars

If one mfr aint going, 10 others are. Ain't way around exept open bars. wrong going bar? Maybe. predict control that? Yeah. they? No. dentist, type doctor

For one thing, Dentists treated medical doctors. They've managed carve practice, billing practices, regulations, etc. standards applied medical doctors apply dentists work narrow set procedures &amp; equipment. something unexpected comes up, generally minor. severe, they're turfing doctor anyway.

Finally, medicine *fucking complicated*, even ""planned procedures"" deal insane amount variability depending patients condition, *expected* process versus *reality* start treatment, additional tests may needed, forth. 90 seconds rofl holy crap dreaming Ok. known fact assumption? thinking since sars-cov-2 bunch relatives, might able activate/create t-cells. read anything points towards though. speculation. I'm gonna need see _lot_ information non-death long term effects get onboard that. Like, 10% population breathing permanently disabled, that's bueno. Arizona report incomplete data today. take weekend report grain salt know biggest venue 15,000 max capacity venue, quarter smaller one NC. however arrange TV could drive number further. Here's secret. dumbasses came here, likely dumbasses regardless nation live in.

Probably wholesome news report I've ever read. lol guys willing sacrifice grandma economy. sure projecting delusional year now, we'll laughing virus. Well, us obviously. Anecdotally Californians started really ignoring virus 2 weeks stories started Texas Florida Georgia. going exact shutdowns weeks. Easiest buy hold index simulates s&amp;p 500 masks retail time advice given pretty quickly stopped selling anyways. looking masks since early February disappeared. remember feel good stories local press Chinese immigrants emptying shelves shipping family back home. firmly believe it‚Äôs far many us Americans don‚Äôt really explore cultures travel beyond Disney Vegas. know I‚Äôm generalizing point still valid. depends... older cruise ships much energy saving functions. One recirculation. Newer ships work 100% recirculation public spaces. Cabin air recirculated within cabin, never cabins. Air coming central AC always fresh cabins. Im sure recurculation functions banned replaced eg heat exchangers avoid mass infections...

Office AC land based systems usually full recirculation system. Maybe change.. Brazil apparently enough cases UK Oh man, ""Skipper"" stuck months I'd laugh ass off. Yeah board taking seriously sub whips hysteria sometimes.

So far know article **one** person went gym people **possibly** exposed date there's confirmation spread anyone. Hopefully aren‚Äôt closed end month. Gonna ruin beach bday trip.

Moving back parents valid option lot people. reason husband middle class able get area grew moved area opportunity. went college got good degree industry pays well. moved back would work remote industry work exist home town. 

Living parents option since mother currently lives van... *was* this, last three times I‚Äôve nobody answered phone Thanks, keep trying Google like sick person wearing mask can't find anything. give    actually read anything wrote? Remember people denying serious we‚Äôre using Florida proof time reopen?

Where people now? I'll start popcorn. Mine free?? Yeah might well make Americans go bankruptcy rather considering healthcare human right since current government sucks much. makes sense. probably even try, then.

I've following whole situation trying understand behavioral aspects it, since also know bit psychology sociology, think crisis good test run deal global crises get public work together misinformation age. Couple things going paper. Firstly, mostly modeling paper trying show herd immunity might complicated think everybody equally likely get spread virus. People socially active certain biological quirks may likely catch covid spread new people. people infected immune, virus spreads less easily. virus can't spread well enough sustain pandemic, call herd immunity. parameters used get 43% tentative, also used parameters model paper. authors careful ‚ÄúOur estimates interpreted illustration population heterogeneity affects herd immunity, rather exact value even best estimate.‚Äù 

The second thing consider phenomena called overshoot. herd immunity threshold reached, infected person spreads less 1 new person, fewer fewer people get sick, decrease happening people still infectious spread susceptible population end infections needed herd immunity. Yea isn‚Äôt strictly transmission protests, it‚Äôs undermining lockdown causing people loosen Covid lockdown actions.

If pinpointing moment people started softening Covid lockdown positions protests plastered thousands televisions across country pandemic took 2-3 week backseat protests. 1) Sweden, sorry call bullshit

2) Unless scientific data relating antibodies Covid-19 related viruses, I'm keeping hopes up, like said earlier. stigma wearing one. understand Italy going ban flights USA, Brazil Russia, ok, India, Bangladesh similar countries. Right. controlling everything conspiring us, least somebody charge. alternative, there's lot random chaos around us, truly frightening scenario. folks WANT someone charge, even bad guys. Damn right. seasonal, seasonality signal evident statistics many countries, United States right it‚Äôs completely overwhelmed effect botched mitigations. fall winter going much worse don‚Äôt get shit together. insurance one much expensive? insurance supposed negotiate cheaper price? 5head bigbrainers gathered watch old rampmaster waterlord give speech.

Sometimes think reddit &amp; Onion provide accurate information outlets combined. Captain H. M. ""Howling Mad"" Murdock entered chat. Inb4 4th July Memorial Day roids causes even bigger spike. small protests favor BLM across Europe week two ago mostly peaceful. Corona pretty much news cycle we're talking racism, climate change, bike lanes instead. America getting hit hard countries take virus seriously (USA, Brazil, Sweden) reeping results failed policies. Finland South Korea, hand, came prepared moved quickly, saving thousands lives billions cash.  lying also think likely wear mask also likely participate polls. free? Tourists change beaches won‚Äôt driving south Florida they‚Äôll take detour. Honestly, reading quirks US healthcare system sometimes really surprise me. seems US took general idea insurance-based system realized worst possible way.

In Germany, multiple lengthy catalogues negotiated prices hospitals/private practices charge insurers (both statutory insurers fully private ones) - binding nationwide law.

It's renegotiated every couple years adjust inflation new procedural costs.

The price catalogue costs public insurers set commission interests groups insurers contractual doctors. health ministry way get involved case gets hand.

For example, hospitals/private practices ever charge 66.86‚Ç¨ ($75.18) thorax CT everyone enrolled statutory insurances. Regardless hospital, doctor specific insurer. cover it.

The catalogue private insurers seperate bit pricier. thorax CT costs either 134.06‚Ç¨ 241.31‚Ç¨ (so $150 $270 depending complications). also goes private insurers everyone enrolled doctors.

If every hospital negotiated individually every insurer group insurers.....that would nightmare.

Btw, new covid PCR test covered statutory insurers costs insurers 59‚Ç¨ ($66.31) mandated doctor. negotiated 39.40‚Ç¨ ($44.28) insurers starting July. Agreed, although still pick takeout foods absolutely cannot want make home. Like pho broth? Efffff that. That‚Äôs rather silly back-of-the-napkin math. $3120 they‚Äôre setting price to, actual cost produce it, tiny fraction price.

Furthermore, you‚Äôre comparing apples oranges. Yes, taxpayer money resulted net benefit, misses point public getting swindled thing should, part, belong them. think live ""medical care desert"" Surrey BC. Even 2 insurances can't find doc audiologist need. go walk clinic get really sub-standard, sometimes dangerous care. travel US basic specialized care. I'm 14 day quarantine doc visit put since began. surprised take temp border, go US go Canada! taking seriously though, respecting quarantine, vigilant since beginning! Coronavirus also much better spreading, cases asymptomatic incubation period longer. difficult control spread community transmission started. Hence full lockdown is/was needed.

It's perfect storm. highly efficient virus, incompetent wreckless regime probably US history. Yeah you‚Äôre right, quoting them. tried reading article couldn‚Äôt, don‚Äôt know got ‚ÄúT-cell antibodies‚Äù from.

The Karolinska Institute quite reputable though. hand Nobel prizes Medicine.  Ah yes, 2 states matter Look actual statistics rare events blown proportion. all. Take care stay safe    People calling lead example - also recommended inject disinfectant. That‚Äôs figured, article really mentioned outdoor stuff though. course could plenty indoor gatherings happening mentioned appreciate approach. sub definitely skews pessimistic, think gentle approach positive news palatable here. This. one even admit massive protests, people chanting, sweating, occupying parks living tents remotely risk factor.
Everything become politicized people blame global spread virus people getting haircuts. headed long dark path cant get collective heads straight. see reason won‚Äôt become absurd shitshow... Well.....damn propose two scenarios plausibly explain origin SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection animal host zoonotic transfer; (ii) natural selection humans following zoonotic transfer. also discuss whether selection passage could given rise SARS-CoV-2.

Number ii seems suggest hypothesis plausible, possible virus human populations prior discovered animal coronavirus identified sufficiently similar served direct progenitor SARS-CoV-2, diversity coronaviruses bats species massively undersampled. Mutations, insertions deletions occur near S1‚ÄìS2 junction shows polybasic cleavage site arise natural evolutionary process.

Again, suggesting hypothesis least, plausible. might correct, might plausible, trying possible progenitor SARS-CoV-2 jumped humans, acquiring genomic features described adaptation undetected human-to-human transmission. acquired, adaptations would enable pandemic take produce sufficiently large cluster cases trigger surveillance system detected read past abstract going provide something SARS-CoV-2 genomes sequenced far genomic features described thus derived common ancestor too. presence pangolins RBD similar SARS-CoV-2 means infer also probably virus jumped humans. leaves insertion polybasic cleavage site occur human-to-human transmission.

The insertion polybasic cleavage site, understand correctly, suggested, based genomic data, something developed human-to-human transmission.

Edit 2: Studies banked human samples could provide information whether cryptic spread occurred. Retrospective serological studies could also informative, studies conducted showing low-level exposures SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses certain areas Critically, however, studies could distinguished whether exposures due prior infections SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses. serological studies conducted determine extent prior human exposure SARS-CoV-2.

Two dickheads, one virus. mean effective? agree assessment. Especially considering testing done point. think, however, data available centered around around 30 sequences done January, means representative. Chinese also sort rather guarded since constantly accused purposefully creating this/exacerbating issue treating sooner, political scientific. also makes hard decipher whatever science release, immediately going assumed invalid. also ton press releases go peer reviewed article without data, development vaccine outweighed slow process getting things peer reviewed. 

In process taking samples sequenced, samples taken patients time sick, take samples recovery development antibodies? Putin intends. I'm aware. anyone found COVID19 patients hospital COVID19 COVID19? TMC still Phase 1, non pandemic ICU listed moderate concern. Testing contact tracing good preventing outbreak, stopping ongoing one. 

If 100 people it, test contact tracing.

You might end 10k-50k tests. test contacts, contacts contacts infected, on. 

If 2.6m cases, good luck that. practically whole nation. UAV little dick energy. Yeah there's always ""Mom Dad said scaredy cat unpatriotic sheep"" factor, unfortunately. Hopefully see enough peers wearing masks they'll want go flow suppose depends level compliance live.

I can't believe even issue, think point selfish self preservation would win even ""doing public good"" didn't. There's literally reason wear mask unless medically contraindicated (in case probably REALLY want people wearing theirs!) Cases rising due increased testing hospitals overwhelmed. Even Florida number deaths continue drop. Basically, we're world's richest third-world country. might even call us sh-thole country. Certainly we're exceptional. ment Sweden stop giving it.

Both right wing parties (PVV FvD) said favor short strict lockdown opposed longer less strict one. 
 
And no, right wing. like talk facts. Change mask plastic bag rubber bands experience, worse high school middle school. teens depressed enough think need counseling. Neither depression this. incredibly isolating. students grades counted, would ugly. younger kids much resilient. Teenagers emotional developmentally need peers much more. Fair enough. Sounded like defending Karen, triggers me, pointing someone else's behavior. Except begging government that.

No mask needed, appointment, nothing.

At least 24 hour everyone wearing mask bu appt proves effective, sure many countries offer help produce it. fact downvoted shows insanely deluded hypocritical people are.

Well also say cases probably 10x higher reported. hate headline I'd love stairmill space. Kansan, wholeheartedly support extremely pleased. community announced requirement wear masks beginning Wednesday super happy that, Laura Kelly made even better. hope helps. 

Also, I'm enjoying butthurt whiners crying Facebook news comment sections. stigma free healthcare basic rights Americans. amount people see without masks fucking stupid. Especially considering around villages, pretty much enormous community old retirees... Yeah, even then, rain gorgeous, need umbrella walking, drive hour two, chilling snow. 

Some years worse others rain, otherwise dandy business lobby runs America going teach people next time things open, better haul ass first ones enjoy weekend 3rd lockdown. landlords also need kind income basic upkeep property.

&lt;in sarcastic Huh. Shoulda planned ahead bad luck like this. Maybe take 2nd job make ends meet. Best look expenses see cut back. convinced nobody attending event right 2000 people mostly without masks. little late good them. personally wear whenever inside. Hawaii we‚Äôve 800 confirmed cases total, dept health able contact tracing cases.  Yesterday spike 17 people attended funeral. 

I‚Äôm assuming indoor memorial, still, that‚Äôs hours place. I‚Äôm surprised virus spread quickly. Yup. Useless. 
Like CDC, billions yearly charts flu activity across US. True threat, oops. 

Don‚Äôt blame lack budget. literally CDC for. years? Oh know, friend went visit offices labs empty people showed work 1-2 weeks month. Obama don‚Äôt blame trump cuts. care, states shutting things effects money. true love. I'm sure part cringing about, latest rumblings masks provide personal protection, protection others. president leading wearing mask, I'll take whatever get. influencer influencing people wear good. Protesters wore masks didnt get sick- folks decided abandon masks political reasons ones getting infected. 

I'm sure want blame protestors country's failure rather leader country refuses take disease seriously signalled dangerous months... Pneumonia fuck lungs up. going ask wtf ""savings""? Lol that's probably sensible president would even deadly kids measles, whooping cough, even chickenpox. lot diseases gotten school canceled past.

The kids problem COVID, passing around teachers grandparents. real concern. Yeah no, let's keep gyms closed. tried using useless go inside get stuff left waiting aisle customer taken items cart worker idea find again. Unfortunately survey receipt ""It's real thing."" believe existed?  makeup getting smeared stupid mask sacrifice orangutan chief would ever willing make Well, consider - Merriam-Webster definition word 'Pandemic' says ""affecting exceptionally high proportion population"".

Would agree disagree current number deaths USA 128,000, 0.000390006093845 % population - ""an exceptionally high proportion population"" ?

Would also agree that, considering 61,000 peopl died common flu season 2017-2018 (according CDC) - Covid, killed double number, particularly dangerous significant?

How 'Pandemic'? 

Read stats yourself, times, tell ""pandemic"" leaders FDA CDC unfortunately beholden Trump. agree many actions pandemic bafflingly bad. institutions like universities medical schools (who often depend heavily federal NIH funding) still put important accurate research coronavirus. FDA still pulled chloroquine shelves proven effective. find hard believe institutions *all* scientists country poor response corrupted. Antibodies extremely unreliable detect past infections Covid-19, let alone test immunity.

If article T-cells, it‚Äôs talking antibodies anyway. Though culturing T-cells isn‚Äôt easy isn‚Äôt good method widely testing immunity. dad‚Äôs recovery triple bypass surgery. can‚Äôt even go visit even mask assholes like can‚Äôt bothered to. can‚Äôt buy groceries without surrounded mouthbreathing morons zero common sense decency. 

Yes. fucking expect take seriously. Someone's obviously American. votes count anything. Everything rigged rich. people power say. ""Democracy"" dope. probably make masks mandatory. theory. people still wouldn‚Äôt want wear them, would issues enforcement capabilities. want hire people whose job shake people complying? Seems like dangerous job. police decided bother anyone reason. Plus simply don‚Äôt manpower that.

Plus Denmark fantastic results without masks shorter less harsh lockdowns had, half physical distancing guidelines US. probably something else worth spending time money effort shutdowns masks. Even experts divided mask use practice. think everyone agrees lab clinical settings trained people works, studies general public wearing either limited scope many confounding factors considered good science. choose wear one, don‚Äôt judge others don‚Äôt. experts don‚Äôt agree, feel sure myself? ""My profit seeking damaged someone else profit seeking first!""

If indoor dining opened bars can't imagine also packed led surge. indoors dining really much safer bars opened bars. Unfortunately, judging pages I‚Äôm regarding COVID-19 Texas...it probably assumed people complete morons Strange Core Physicians says otherwise.

Do listing places one get tested, esp. seacoast area?

What's cost?

Thanks! Um trying exactly 40 years now. ask americans vote anything 1,2 answer, eg. Black white, down, almost always get 50% side vote. never understand it. I'm KC, MO right state line. Thankfully mayor issued mask ordinance went effect today I'm positive dumbass governor never follow suit. know pandemic started 2016. really worked them. 

Am late? still excuse. recruiting people trials, also recruit 55+ people. testing simultaneous. problem standard testing procedure tried. Collosal failure. Followed directions letter. Tasted like shit. Next time (if one) I'll skip cardamon fennel seed, use cinnamon, cloves star anise, instead cooking 6 hours I'll reduce 3. That's first time tasted great. brisket cooked fine, too. feel 1920s America really represents that, Canadian. Yes AFIAK, Nobel Institute PRIVATE institution, part Swedish government. 

And [they screw   Yes assumed. means northern winter great yet, nowhere ""article"" say contracted it? I'm guessing 28 people actually live place time.

Leave F(ucked)ox news leave important details like HOW. risk isn‚Äôt 2020. risk taken 2015ish (or whenever started development) committed resources develop candidate. That‚Äôs COVID didn‚Äôt even exist nobody even sure remdesivir wouldn‚Äôt make grow third eye something worse. pay back risk 2015 (or whatever) prices charge 2020.

Do understand that? Back 2015 agree commit hundreds millions dollars something failure. don‚Äôt pay back 2020, going forward nobody want commit projects like that. I‚Äôm confused. According TMC website, still couple thousand ICU beds, reading right. 

So title bullshit reading charts wrong? we‚Äôve also stories Pilots Flight Attendants freaking passengers minor offenses simple misunderstandings.

If airline industry would politely firmly enforce rules time maybe would come understand rules, apply everyone, follow don‚Äôt fly. Instead free-for-all air time passengers crew alike abusing rules. can't trust anyone right thing. they're always themselves.

This helps everyone. gives restaurants want enforce mandate backbone, ""Look, want lose business, enforce this,"" ones enforce get shut down. again. encouraging people who've COVID donate blood plasma Sweden? along disinclination people potentially expose giving blood could skew percent antibodies higher general population. Beaches spread coronavirus. Sunlight + good airflow = 99% reduced spread. 

People holding indoor private parties they're bored due beach closed do. Something/someone wants humans die. I‚Äôve worked contract tracing. It‚Äôs next impossible collect reliable data there‚Äôs high percentage asymptomatic cases. Lol, ok completely right.

I support protests 100% multiple friends straight tell ""Everyone's too.""

They went bars last weekends. 

Granted none friend people I'd call smart.. Well 2020, else go wrong? that's death rate 3.3% known cases, hopefully number starts plummet 2900 cases turn 95 deaths. think millennials political saviors everyone makes be. vote best interest interests many? Like green new deal, universal healthcare etc? Living area state rural orientation. don‚Äôt know trust Washington Nationals fan. ‚ÄúNo, sorry.‚Äù

The thing data represents slightest way much testing.  Graduated high school/started college boom. college, watched bubble burst 9/11 happen, graduated worst economy nearly century. know single person graduated able get field studied college multiple years. Almost every single person working job require degree kind, paid well $20/hr, lived home parents.

And 15+ years since then, gotten worse. Damn. Im one overflow beaches. needs close 100% agree. Houston Phoenix 2 5 largest cities US. small town/rural explanation BS stereotype. Covid spreading largest cities (regardless density). Also 20% US population lives rural settings. anything charges interest stealing? mortgages homeowners auto loans (or loans general)? Student loans (regardless fact college education way overpriced, students still need loans pay living expenses even tuition college charged fees brought 0)? Let‚Äôs say stealing I‚Äôm allowed charge interest. would give type loan there‚Äôs risk won‚Äôt pay back, could instead use money would given buy bunch items sell profit?

I definitely agree rents high, many markets landlords charging level profits excessive due high cost entry forces much working class renting prevents real estate purchase. purely say landlording theft ignores reality risks many landlords taking.

Once again, forced choose health paying rent. 1. Deaths lag infections 3-4 weeks.

2. Improved treatments reduced mortality hospitals overwhelmed.

3. certain cities US danger filling ICU capacity.

Deaths per day go up, slower rate NYC. get wrong, I'm saying tests ""made up"" anything like that, data quality highly suspect.

Using simple extrapolation - 2-3 times Tourists states pouring in. People going lot effort get sick dangerous disease. think would lead massive amount lawsuits idiots claiming got virus X place. Obviously video pretty damning following rules, i'm sure would people digging flaws get $$$. Maybe i'm reading comment wrong, think fine/punishment breaking regulations separate hospital bills. Yes get fined, related hospital bills. fair, majority sub's Sweden articles already? absurd even think people believe someone science background 2020. literally think oposite wtf insanely clear China lying numbers tons reports coming China. joke. Jesus actually put /s behind every joke reddit now?? dare government deprive citizens freedom kill neighbor's grandpa ...how anyone supposed post without getting instantly deleted political? anyone around seen horse?

I noticed earlier barn door open. die. USA absolutely worse March. 265 died yesterday compared high 2000 mean virus eventually spread pace that's going overwhelm system. matter prepared is. Even hospitals overwhelm still worth it. Poverty much higher thus extreme poverty. causes death not, unpleasant living hunger diseases. worth all, specially since saving mostly old lives die soon anyways. Considering president Russian asset would count Twitter Russian propaganda. case get motivation scientists, action journalists despicable cases like country significant population anti science nuts. people opening creationists ""museums"" past decade. hope hire better workers think agree something better nothing. totally agree everyone timing people's lives could saved. Ignoring failing put system place combat virus totally acceptable. No, we‚Äôre actually sit aside say ‚Äúwell, fuck women‚Äôs progress, menfolk obvious busy dealing important stuff‚Äù. Objectively false, go off. probably keep bailing too. country goddamn stupid. caught ü§£ believe Join club Allow translate 3 unmasked men singing picture ""Mary little lamb, little lamb little lamb, Mary little lamb going die"" tetanus shot always gives arm pain, probably giant needle poking hole arm/muscle actually injecting. It‚Äôs real annoying seeing everyone buying Pharma press releases silver linings. best way survive coronavirus continues darndest get first place. loose collective people usually fine following laws. hurricanes coming lunatics drive wrong side road buy Mountain Dew? Doesn‚Äôt feel like laws. Mail carrier coughing everyone's mailboxes?

Pool/gym location?

Touching door handles? effort people go behave stupidly. 

Incredible. 80k? Omg! Stfu fair, venn diagram ""Country Music Fans"", ""Intelligent People"" is:  O

Hopefully, attendance already asymptomatic carriers, turn clusterfuck. virus still infant. 1 infected person (maybe few, knows) 10 million know 6 months. 6 months! greatest severe economically crippling lockdowns world ever seen. 125k dead USA, much mitigation.. Millions die USA another lockdown. Horrible situation entirely avoidable quite optimistic. Even young 0.2% chance death... Middle aged male underlying health issues fare lot worse. 

Regardless fatality rate, learning long lasting consequences even recovery. point family member willing risk? relative willing allow possibly suffer hospital stay, go socialize? staying home, wearing mask generally avoiding ppl help avoid making choices, I'd gladly it. Protests Fed printing money doesn‚Äôt add government‚Äôs debt. adds government‚Äôs debt spending treasury Congress (power purse strings) must approve. spent trillions crisis it‚Äôs Powell‚Äôs trillions here. Im america, fuck government. Im moving canada find pickup hockey year round lol. I'm shocked numbers went riots... Bad plumbing? floor? Yesterday Woke middle night yesterday shivering (I slept sister law‚Äôs AC freezing standards), turned off. strange cold sweats/and chills went away. 

I woke day headache butterflies stomach feels somewhat like cold sweats. slowly felt better. 

I got home strange ammonia scent nose. Smells exactly like ammonia inhalant. pressure sinuses. still strange butterflies stomach. 

I tested ability smell cologne, still somewhat smell. Taste sort absent blame sinus pressure. 

Could Sahara dust Florida? looking actual study, Remdesivir seem actually significantly change patient outcomes remdesivir group, 8% patients died, compared 11.6% patients placebo arm. survival difference wasn‚Äôt statistically significant, however.

The largest difference reducing patient recovery times four days Gilead says save hospitals around $12,000 per patient, said. Gilead estimated savings based data showing day hospitalization costs $3,000 

That's pricing logic comes from. Also wanted note **""the U.S. developed country Gilead charge two prices, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O‚ÄôDay said interview. nations, governments negotiate drug prices directly drugmakers.""** Lol. Yeah totally suspicious active pandemic numbers change week week /s

Are one people still thinks hoax? Literally one laying guilt chain. feel insecure guilty, that's you, said. think realistic , even small mitigation risk make big difference. [This article shows relative risk based seating. Less people plane means less possible people virus, turn reduces risk transmission. United CEO trying justify risk reduction effort make money. last person take health advice someone would put health risk increase profits. didn‚Äôt cuomo‚Äôs policies also kill lot elderly people? quite easy enforce anything unless higher someone enforce things. Nice Fucking selfish pricks enrages me. Anyone using put prison. Exactly. That‚Äôs can‚Äôt afford wait take action surge new cases coming in. Didn‚Äôt Obama administration restore image extent? Yes bars restaurants actually cause spread. Also, people go beaches aren‚Äôt closed counties personal pool parties now. closed businesses along beaches instead. want go, sand swimming only. bare responsibility alone. Every republican stood every democrat refused try numerous crimes bears dead shoulders too. think always misunderstood became intolerable ass process.

Masks important. save lives.

But Pelosi needs fighting lockdown now. Masks would helpful February. Masks would helpful start reopening.

Now, going get overwhelmed unless shut down. Masks longer sufficient endemic virus is.

Those permitted leave house approved reason wear masks. reopen, wear masks.

I called killer obsessed masks, dismissed measure would save even lives. *suggested* people drive speed limit rather requiring it, speed think people Americans would driving?

I swear point I'm 99% sure distrust vaccine russian chinese misinformation campaign, exactly kinda shit would Same, I'd kill chance actually save money change. Wish option like majority friends. wait second term. finally get reforms passed

Trump's second term could result things:

- US kicked G7
- US leaving NATO
- US formally investigated ICC leading vast sets sanctions
- UN moving HQ Geneva
- Exodus major tech firms US immigration policies starve workforce
- Germany kicking remaining US troops
- China - EU deal making euro important dollar.

As legislation: quite unlikely GOP captures House. Even House + Senate + President, Trump got little done. **Boss:** got business trip Orlando next week

**Grunt:** Umm, no? Pretty please no?

**Boss:** going.

*... three weeks later ...*

**Grunt:** got COVID test back. positive :(

**Boss:** Ok, well stay home couple weeks, since traveled Florida, COVID paid sick leave.

**Grunt:** dafuq required disclose anything I'm giving medical advice.

I'm summarizing current understandings limitations supported medical literature.

And welcome yourself. I'm limiting way. I'm asking join cult.

I'm suggesting everyone exercise caution novel virus we're still discovering virus does.

Last week, saw game changing paper suggests infection spreads non-traditional process. told that. huge media network media outlets forcing narrative, president went tv mask on, would like Italy now. asshats conveniently forgot stores private property. law need shirt shoes shop, enforce whatever want property. Dane, just, Iunno, travel Sweden? hard. I'm still going indoor stadium tens thousands people cuz mask favorite basketball team it. die! show em states, lag death counted. example, Florida count probable deaths, deaths confirmed Florida department health. Yesterday's daily report included people died far back April 15th. People died 2 months ago added Florida's death count. ""Do say, do..."" china's fault refrigerated trucks show up, state blame china warning reopening early would cause government's around world make free every person.  lets honest, europeans trust ended 2016 election results Fast track equal poorly researched unsafe. resources poured shorter amount time order get public sooner. Scientists dumb enough give world shoddy half-assed product. wish best hope people around stay healthy. Really hoping yesterday peak guys. millennials ruining aging? trend (lower deaths&amp;cases ratio) confirmed comparable data Italy Sweden. good news. 

Possible explanation: lower viral load moment transmission. Possibly higher temperatures. Keep mind people started dying large scale around March. really appreciate opinion. No, everyone get around it. grandma watching 3 month old 3 year old nieces around 2 brothers sister law none got it. (they tested quarantined 2 weeks) Life throws curveballs.  would unexpected child? unexpected disappearance industry plan work for? unexpected death life partner 10 years relationship?  unexpected disability prevents working?  

What would unexpected death children die?  unexpected bankruptcy company work for?  unexpected failure new business?  unexpected infertility first time aim kids?

No-one *plans* get degenerative disease stops graduating ever working. No-one *plans* world wide pandemic.  Shit happens. Death issues young people. Life long health problems are. Diabetes, Lung scaring, Kidney liver issues. everyone recovers fully.  Asymptomatic people showing months ""recovery"" kinds issues. 

There things worse death.    

Even fully recovered young people often really hard "" **Half US households stock.** ""

So half do. Exactly glass half-empty-half-full kind scenario. BTW, data. Google said stock ownership US 52%, slightly higher cited article. Yes, elected Trump, how's know Bish want fluke, appetizer. Biden elected, relief, going faith we'll stick presidents know get along rest world. like reading story man skeptical existence danger wolves, went wolf infested section forest. immediately torn apart eaten wolves.

... Faux Entertainment needs sued existence. Meeting one: yes, long everyone live together keep least 6 feet apart. Sharing food OK long go take food separately, maintaining distance whole time. Surfaces pretty low risk, infections happen people directly breath other's droplets. Try sit farther apart 6 feet eating chatting people produce saliva eating talking food greater risk droplets. Covid break well. Today six percent yesterday, really big news. happens day day day... Herd immunity? believe misspelt 'GOD' dear fellow redditor! /s Kind wish still pool expenses point, honestly. Ain‚Äôt America though. government hoard supplies people always help one another out. Fucking eh. Sorry can't accept facts come insults. ¬Ø\\\_ („ÉÑ)_/¬Ø least eye protection America world leader? Since when? lol. lol imposing rights curious state youre in? wouldnt want Think I'm gonna print laminate card simply states ""FUCK YOU, STUPID"" show anyone shows fake ADA card. study University Copenhagen shows ""very likely"" Danes brought corona virus Iceland, Sweden Latvia. researchers, background mathematics, obtained ""family tree"" studying public data DNA corona virus, shows virus mutated changed spreads people.

Wrong conclusion. easily Icelanders, Swedes Latvians travel Denmark, get infected travel back.

Thousands Swedes Danes people working Denmark living Sweden, yes disease transmitting countries like that.

There's Icelanders going fro time well, guess also Latvians coming work here, although sure that. Yup. Panhandle still open business. even type headline just...that people conned believing real agency. üò≠ Indeed, least Germany. seems long time ago agree lot undone. Trump illustrated America goodwill, alliances, shared visions unstable. I'm 30s. gave viral meningitis four months. still ass. makes expensive ineffective reducing death rate. shown reduce ER stay. hey, ER stays expensive per day probably ends saving money. 7 infections today take drastic actions like this. happened months ago hospital country FML, I'm like 90% Welsh according DNA test. wish part German Scandinavian could apply citizenship üò≠  Wish wasn‚Äôt Florida. worry

In Europe take good care lonely girlfriends Oh fuck CNN. number antivaxxers extremely low, 10% extreme reports. including people say vaccines ""may dangerous"" mild answer. mean shit I'd tempted answer that, I'm doctor know what's dangerous. I'm still getting vaccines problem.

Antivaxxers stop herd immunity. outrage bait. way expensive. Fucking vultures. I‚Äôm St Pete I‚Äôm expecting 4th announce close beaches. I‚Äôm really hoping I‚Äôm right. Stay safe. This. Florida people around me, locals, taking seriously. It‚Äôs entire area swarmed tourists aren‚Äôt socially distancing wearing masks. see pictures crowded Florida beaches posted, guarantee majority shown tourists. pandemic time year laid low anyways (because tourist season), pandemic made worse (like everything else). 40M here, hope feel normal healthy soon bud. 

Few month sounded like you. definitely rock bottom sickness. remember one worst parts CV probably mental exhaustion endless anxiety. several days evening would hit, debated driving ER chest felt like explode. 

Don‚Äôt dumb like debate. hope feel better soon take slow easy. People severely overestimate importance. Cult 45 two zig zags, baby that‚Äôs need,

Go bar, dark, spread covid-19 Nephew... goes reserve currency status. Southern governors want try cake eat corona, assuming virus bargained with. approve healthcare workers 1st, risk.

Healthcare workers good PPE (in China) extensive training use it. Chinese media reports 40,000+ healthcare workers dispatched Wuhan help out, single one got infected. sharp contrast situation earlier many native Wuhan healthcare workers got infected figured take droplet/aerosol precautions.

I see need deploy military forces crowd control, enforcing quarantine, roadblocks etc, vaccines could come useful.  Yeah try stay away biased news sources. really exist imo. Yeah idea allowed occurring without financial penalty penalty kind matter. I'm Long Island - near NYC - seems like 70% people wear masks unless forced to. (As in, supermarket let in.) used able answer question, right now, can't.

That's point half??? Figured it‚Äôd like 75% least. agree point... understanding still needs profit motive incentivize aggressive R&amp;D leads breakthroughs. everyone gets medicine good feeling saving lives. think insane think theory free market medicine completely evil. know answer though - maybe cap much company could profit particular patent drug? Like, first 100 million cool, dollar greedy. dunno. Also, said redditor would, has, gone far blame Sweden Danish employers firing Danish employees. So... Yeah... US, CCP [United emptied PPE stores (including Home Depot, TSC, Walmart) Planet sent everything China, resell us huge markup. get worried stock, sneaky. fact CCP could send message United Front members get much stuff right away worries most. deeply embedded United Front within countries? sort influence have? Politicians involved, Universities? exact role [Confucius serious questions. go crowded beaches. problem immunocompromised people can‚Äôt get vaccine even want to. So, exposed due people‚Äôs poor choices. think light drunk driving. Maybe think want risk that‚Äôs problem, could hit someone else therefore also risking people‚Äôs lives probably don‚Äôt think moral. protests coronavirus concerns mean pilots? Like F1 race? Dane, urge Sweden close border us. Fox pulling us time now. another example it. 120k+ die bad flu season. Certainly 4-6 months, actual efforts reduce eliminate it(this happen flu).

No matter feelings subject, nothing like seasonal flu. Yep, rest world waves goodbye US, return normal viewing channel. Source? rightwinginsanity.com ? politics ends. Somehow protests spreading virus networks. Please Dude, video, article. ""Article"" description video...  guy criminal. USA?

If estimates true, 10% population may impacted Uh... that's lot in-person college classes were. Professor copies book onto board, gives homework, figure out. curve flattened. longer, rapidly climbing several weeks. spreading old propaganda. science question: know if, lack better term, ""covid-18"" endemic Wuhan, China, SE Asia? symptoms similar flu common cold, two illnesses typically diagnosed symptoms opposed lab tests. possible outbreak due recent animal human transmission, endemic virus mutated, increased infectivity severity? Would even way investigate this? live Alabama wish would mandate masks. would sometimes go local Publix, last time mask wearing much lower, people generally weren‚Äôt following one way signage. much would like luxury items prefer there, I‚Äôll keep using Kroger Clicklist services. hard imagine, right millennial generation primarily responsible unprecedented spike. one getting infected spreading disease. Jeff Daniels? mean, regardless potential severity deflection making sure vitamin levels good. helps covid that's bonus even still helps keep healthy. Cheers breaking cycle! I'm 46 boat; absentee father mentally unwell mother. solid mom top priority. study KI found T-cells protects covid-19 virus. Since alot people covid, always show antibodies blood, speculated different way body could become immune virus. far unpublished study tv4 got make report publishing today reveal t-cell study.

The study contained around 200 cases people covid blood analyzed. bigger amount people T-cells rather antibodies covid, would suggest bigger immunity present Sweden previously thought.

The generaldirector Folkh√§lsomyndigheten, Johan Carlson, says study would explain model spread virus Stockholm area. also says frustrating amount antibodies low, would compliment result good way.  like way think.  Owning property renting property outlandish thing see. actually fairly common. Well apparently long line enablers voted second respected man America . could narcissist ask missing opportunity costs. Sure, could give parent $4k year homeschooling program. even straight $17k public schools spend per student.

But people make $17k jobs, order homeschooling work, one parent going give said job. single parent, good luck paying mortgage $17k year. Even many dual income households would likely struggle. yeah 2 million upper bounds estimates I've seen. dont get vaccine many years goes by.... maybe 95% infected totally question. ya know.. side road haha way better depends. That's ridiculous Yes, absolutely be. Especially like OP college education havent able find decent work city live 12 years. Moving seems like pretty decent option. keep telling people. Buy weapons looting break-ins begin. NY, NJ, CT, MA: joke you?

Seriously. tried reality tv two months ago are. Unless FOX news starts telling people real, half population see continue absolutely self centered actions. Yeah. look NYC dealt long term care homes. sure gyms. staff members find teenagers act many different places. Steam room, sauna, racquetball courts, storage closets. used work 24hr facility wasn‚Äôt staffed night near local bars. normally would work around 1-2am would place myself. 3 occasions I‚Äôve opportunity to. declined drunk well, didn‚Äôt want get banned gym gainz life. hate standards lowered much obvious qualifies ""leadership"". 

We really need someone tell us stay home avoid deadly virus, absolutely nothing solve problem? They've broken us kids.  parent, I've told kids this. want go live lives, one helped 17 kicked house. want leg up, money bank go own. not? different large masked event protest browsing Costco couple hours? Spoiler alert.... yes. jennifer_lawrence_ok_yea_thumbs_up_nodding.gif Remember preshow!

Massive Texas R convention coming Houston July!

Normally get 12,000+ probably half year.  It‚Äôs even worse started saying virus biological weapon would end humanity fear monger hock shitty silver/zinc supplements doomsday prep meal kits. 

Then flip flops virus hoax take Trump protesting lockdown mask wearing measures combat it. 

And listeners don‚Äôt question story line changing dramatically? Boggles mind. Yea governor put patients nursing homes want brag outstanding job they've done. Along 50kbdeathsbwhich double state.

Great Job New York! Depends comfort level. can‚Äôt HURT, surface transmission pretty low. roommate stopped wiping groceries personally, makes feel better, might well. rents paid, mortgages paid, problems happen.

When start selling, big companies start buying.

Big banks artificial steroid credit giving big real estate companies buy smaller default properties. Yeah sadly doesn‚Äôt mean shit anymore neither attorney general. Good job degraded office dumb fuck reality tv star Nobody forcing take person class Thanks suggestion man, mate mine who's starting channel. thought help ;) wonder medical staff feels this.

When hospital lifted ours, without support medical staff.

Elective surgeries patient visitation helps make hospitals money unfortunately feels like bigger driver public health. somehow two Richard Linklater movies. Naples absolutely terrified oncoming onslaught east coasters apparently desperate beaches infinitely better crap, swarm us inevitably cause outbreak. 

OR, officials close beaches obvious defensive response; small, somewhat responsible town manageable Covid numbers throughout epidemic deprived gorgeous sand, flat clear waters, free beach parking. heart breaks watching nurse patient sending message two girls. feel dread. appreciate tone comments basically ""this can't nice things.""

I actually wish Illinois would well. Open outdoor spaces, leave indoor truly things hand compliance mask wearing. dead inside, haunted thoughts, laughed whole world everyone choose turns traitor body mind slowly fails. think anyone would want really president like that. Protesters visiting grandma. saw coming.

Edit: still highly skeptical report considering wrong media Florida since March. Yes. lead country deaths. turned around. isolated, quarantined, wore masks. changed course disease goddamn right we'll pat back.  crazy people acting. Like they've got cabin fever bad cooped they're partaking *more* high-risk behavior they'd things normal.

As example, people working beaches around live saying they're crazy every single day. One quote heard ""Like 4th July, every day"", believe it. state park I'd regularly go years past hike jam-packed pretty much day think visiting. nuts. large tumor showed stupid irrational people are, good. hope too. I'm feeling really numb. best answer person‚Äôs concern. 

It‚Äôs dismissive (there IMO valid reasons erosion trust US gov), informs process, reminds people see research (from countries) themselves. need trust Trump even CDC. Right time! US getting dangerously close pandemic hands! I‚Äôm hoping New Zealand takes over, seem shit together Would change mind learn even asymptomatic infections lead permanently reduced lung function? Like really wanna lose 5% lung function this? called buddy man. lady dammit. Also, yes, passports rendered useless time future, enough time election police/military buggaloos militia groups overthrow government. country, passport.

And talking rhetoric Bernie sanders quote. It‚Äôs dead wrong. there‚Äôs nothing wrong 25, shade. ain‚Äôt mad. depends antibody class. IgM dissapears within week two, IgG last many years. vaccines work, develop IgG antibodies vaccine thus protected many years come. says quote means said ‚Äúit‚Äôs saline solution‚Äù...really seriously take look communication skills. Seriously, it‚Äôll help others. I'm waiting coworker get people killed. husband first ones door gyms opened. think still worse flu, think masks dumb continues say need get done it.

Her 4th July party includes people flying Arkansas, Arizona. going 90 humid Saturday chance people stay outdoors long 6 people age 80. 


What could go wrong? Even Chinese don‚Äôt believe 18 cases. I've always wondered, what's benefit hot yoga vs regular? feel like ever would miserable always sweat like pig I'm working heat turned even able see straight sweat burning eyes. Must 1000s people indoor orgies. opening isn‚Äôt problem. Enforcing restrictions is. People ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù states going another lockdown. state local governments need mandate enforce mask wearing + distancing public. Intentionally coughing someone right direct threat life safety, employer (hospital) back CA basically told us press charges make citizens arrests people try this. felony direct threat exceptionally easy prove intent say try get sick.

It never happened still working there, written memo procedure handle came zero tolerance form evil. disagree someone go downvote ever comment made? Even completely basic ones like saying they've never driven two half hours? understand downvoting stupid comments people really go downvote everything person said? People move work time.

People also wear seatbelts time. ride motorcycles without helmets time. people thing make ""just thing"" good advice. ""Just move"" option, sure, helpful advice slightest. downvotes justified contributed nothing useful discussion. Planet fitness 200 location West Virginia?

Edit: bad. 200 patrons locations. giving ticket someone littering. risk usually enough make people think twice even rarely enforced. stop spread

What happene ‚Äúslow spread‚Äù? Legitimately asking ""DONT COME COUNTRY, WE'LL COME TRASH IT""  covid test. phoned described symptoms, given timeslot next day, went long got tested. Waited 2 days results it. saw somebody's vlog traveling time. surprised see idiots plane bothered wear masks. Smh. obviously there's enforcement crew there. ever time u need wear damn mask, would exactly it! People! 

Imo, worn 100% time flight ie meals, snacking whatsoever! care long flight is.. Tough. category ""could probably handle it, try"" Sir, patrick! Yes, exactly. parks around never closed, I‚Äôve walked dog outside nearly every day. big parks lots room everyone.

Where people get squeamish beach safety number people rises. parking lots get full, people get cars close proximity (sometimes parking garages ventilation).

The beaches also get packed start wonder wind direction whether someone‚Äôs cough blow you. 

Ever see Florida vacation commercials show beautiful, nearly empty beach? It‚Äôs like that. Haha Bar owners never put anything making dime. thought that, although mention it‚Äôs patients halfway vid. first hand knowledge amount medical support would receive federal gov. Here's pretty good explanation reliable source anonymous redditor! absurd testing free everyone country. Yeah shes probably banged hundred thousand.

Good same. understand know, though point 2 weeks college insurance didnt know terrible system time. point way knowing I'd hit $6,000 bills. effective system blindsided costs like that. Certainly fault insurance person, doctor, nurses spoke still sucks. let spread younger populations. barely impact them. Don‚Äôt play coy, I‚Äôve seen rest posts. You‚Äôve picked pieces information try cast doubt refusing acknowledge opinion anyone actual experience.  Gee, think younger floridians come contact older floridians...ever? lot state governments watching happened abroad NYC months yet sat hands. agree needs daily occurrence television net. Infomercials, too. First all, thank frontlines.

I wondering want elaborate shutdown. &amp; co-workers feel giving mask mandate time first see data results? Lol.  Mass gatherings people spread virus long cause fits ""my politics"" topic subject article.   Yet I'm one spreading dangerous misinformation? I'm pretty sure spitting coughing someone usually charged assault normally. Right charged terroristic threats places. eradicated smallpox mass world wide vaccinations.

We almost eradicated polio too.  holdout places difficult get refrigerated boxes fast enough time arrive working vaccine.  need collective throw money it. Someone works campaign team PR goes forum place like 4/Chan whatever asks anyone wants job. 

Or sometimes it‚Äôs people charge social media. It‚Äôs similar hiring process. ask want help run social media accounts campaign sooner later you‚Äôre tasked shitposting various Internet forums given several accounts along couple people 

The rules simple. Don‚Äôt talk bad employer, say whatever want think make look good counter narrative something bad, never respond whenever lies pointed out. 

It‚Äôs like phishing emails. point post much disinformation possible hoping reach many people possible. Sooner later someone falls 

Guy started month midterms. Come October posting 3 times much now. Right he‚Äôs playing cool working 3 month (assuming) ban politics sub. 1 share MoviePass stock RobinHood Right honestly what's point? test positive gonna lock room 14 days? many 12 year olds died this? Like none. live someone highly susceptible act like test positive take precautions, anyway. also wear mask day everyday idiots ruining life rest us going millions cases. one million get drug $2.4 billion Gilead's coffers. stock going up. not? force people wear shoes, clothes, seatbelts, helmets, lots things many different reasons. know makes masks special America exception every developed country mandate. need like spare 50k year lying around that. kinda work pays that?

Try DMT? think means thing here. ""Stopping"" control surges still leaves slowed spread. even China able completely stop it. time college students fly back school. Yeah. I'm leaning way too. years. close final straw. anti-life murdering scumbags overturn ACA (Obamacare), given. They're literally trying overturn ACA peak pandemic. I'm supposed believe repubs want people die? That's absurd. enjoy watching rest suffer, disgusting fucking sadists. Fuck all. can't retaliate. fight back perceive continue harm you. One cough, even malicious, enough. kidding! know CHINA chooses emergency measure immediate financial gain fuzzy-wuzzies. treat people expendable, they're worried about. also ones experience this.  Nothing see, young young. Let spend parents money, can't go anyway. please, go protest, yelling spitting near eachother proven defense virus think there's real movement towards face masks starting US. Seattle I've seeing lot seems going nation-wide now. That's probably good thing seeing recently. know exponential growth means? bottleneck testing, lab processing. Fewer people may get tested weekends samples wait lab time process anyway. means 2100+ TN reported sunday/monday combined include nashville pay $6k test, get test matter fucking what. actual fuck guys there? want kill 1% population? Restaurants luxury. Society better without them. Albania part EU, Greece immigration check border. travelling U.S. passport, denied entry. Herd immunity nice side effect widespread vaccination benefits take vaccine.

If vaccine available anti-vaxxers want it, really care them. get vaccine family. anti-vaxxers want it, it. claim Darwin award. I'm Florida, please say Hurricanes D: First landlord, think would time wasting arguing like are. 

second, gross selfish hateful attitude towards peoples suffering getting hate. 

You presenting solutions, pretending none matters care less fate human beings else go. 

Congrats reached peak horribleness. Physically demonstrate said lab reproduce it. Literally basis science. cannot that, empirical. 'Merica  Unfortuanly Arizona, Texas, Florida summers opposites. Nobody wants eat outdoors summer states. I‚Äôm convinced people actually want country collapse want many people die possible. brainwashing American people driven something destructive straight evil can‚Äôt figure is. Coronavirus can't afford stay property.  Gotta patience stuff. like covid-19 existed long. study going published quite soon, understood correctly(I didnt hear date sadly). want right. always gonna start study. sure, imagine get tiring finding studies fly, would probably enough make travel differently too.

I'll concur Florida beaches nicer--but definitely get beach experience right without risk virus. ubi makes much sense.  Genuinely surprised Lenny Curry this. drove town center day many people shopping 3 masks saw. Hopefully finally slow spread properly now. mask order good people enforce it, I‚Äôm convinced JSO take time issue citations people don‚Äôt wear one, could nothing Wtf wrong u? understanding hard sell property non-paying tenant it, theoretically possible.

 Good hear- well done! think grasp scientific process true, Monday numbers lowest less people get tested Sundays. bat sneezes pangolin sneezes another bat sneezes multiple humans either Wuhan, outside Wuhan sneeze anybody arrive Wuhan. can't, want to. mean sound young healthy. see couldnt interact. 12 year old would fine seems like waste time test So.. saw people Miami. That's whole story here? pretty good experience testing America (in KY) super quick easy Dude. I‚Äôm pro-Trump. Peace blessings.
Edit: Yes joke shouldn‚Äôt made. Don‚Äôt crucify me! see that. true Broadway lovers, could absolutely work like that. wonder test spoonfed Americans. Well opinion means nothing compared data. data says happening.

So again, thank astute clinical opinion. right actually currently poop! order see 3 year old son. Right ‚Äúflatten curve‚Äù graphs internet March didn‚Äôt say that. Everyone seemed agree long hospital capacity that‚Äôs could do. Somewhere alone way changed. no, general public informed March overall plan eventually stop spread. mom 63. feel lost. model mostly bullshit. NC cases never really went down, estimated period R0 &lt; Makes miss Frenchies Palm Pavilion .... Right long getting paid, screw everyone else right? Everyone himself? 

This really ends it, people like deciding selfishness game town. Saves 5 days hospital (5 x $3949) 30%(?) cases. top young people pay back massive corporate bailouts years come form higher taxes and/or monetary devaluation ... Good times. What? replying one comment. said got heavily downvoted. Food thought, max Roth IRA 401k. literally base minimum do. that's much money whole treatment course, new drug made short time frame novel virus. least piss sterile... feces actually shown keep corona alive. Asshole boomers act like fault too. Can‚Äôt wait till expire rational young minds take try fix mess got us into. would mean Ron DeSantis would believe science know going happen. dont see see Taking weekends may quite sinister, definitely negligent. want spread shifts lab. Test counts vary day. change several states made 40+ haven't. thought well. creating situation workers sick virus go work sick due money pressures.  Thanks lot Libtards Advice needed!

Hi - I‚Äôm youth sports coach, started practices last week sat told one kids team tested positive. 

We distancing measures place, took temperatures gave sanitizer way in, kept kids 2 groups (&lt;10 per group), congregated water breaks weren‚Äôt good keeping apart. 

Now job wants us resume practice one week later. many questions implications don‚Äôt know handle it. teacher might... fucking huge. curious. listen media possible. like hear directly doctors health experts, second hand info. masks! try get philosophical. presented case response ad hominen attack. really shows strong argument is. mind, one studies copy pasted even contradicts saying. Good needs celebrate fake freedom got safety hysterical Experiments? talking I‚Äôm late convo please everything expose company online. hotels done exact thing shamed postponing plans expand. Also, news articles hotels laying 1k workers complete bull. lot hotels laid 90% staff‚Äîliterally thousands ppl. reported corporate lay offs. tourism industry won‚Äôt recover years. Graduated 2005, laid 5 times. wonder even 401k, though ""should"" lot bigger. really need someone tell us stay home avoid deadly virus, absolutely nothing solve problem? They've broken us kids.

I mean....look Florida. Wow, I'm shocked proportion 7% must live NW Ohio based trips store. George W Bush wars. big problem people understand Quebec probably place world publishing something approaching real numbers.


Quebec using presumptive numbers, confirmed numbers. virus assumed everyone live it. someone dies symptoms virus, presumed died virus. COVID-19 excess death numbers match Quebec. inflated Canadian numbers comparison others.


Quebec epicenter Canada March break week two earlier provinces lot people Quebec travel Europe vacation ignored advice evidence bad idea beginning March. also lot travel back forth Montreal New York time. Close INDEFINITELY FFS Awesome! Wish best what's answer? Throw millions people street say 'good luck getting sick!'

Seriously, what's plan? accurate conclusion probably drawn deaths per day excessive mortality. fucking terrorism. possible t-cells without contact sars-cov-2? study discussed quite bit general consensus one month probably error. would found waste water months March 2019 2020? absolutely do, that‚Äôs drove mad idiotic ‚Äúso told people, slow testing!‚Äù comment. honestly fight thing you‚Äôre testing enough going blind it? 

If look countries actually control there‚Äôs common practices: React EARLY (like, see first cases early), stop incoming cases (shut borders, close infected areas etc) aggressive testing contract tracing, instant 14 day quarantine anyone tests positive well anyone they‚Äôve come contact with, masks. 

Testing tracing so, so, important. Absolutely blew mind buffoon said legit expecting applause audience. That's it. outside fresh air constant breeze that's present beach super low risk bad people can't go enjoy it. first thought damn that's crazy, realized, hordes people want besides sit beach? Congregate high risk indoor spaces shop, eat, drink, try get laid. sure wouldnt say able spend 100 dollars ""being spoiled"" would call financially responsible. cant find disposable income got big problems little late I‚Äôm well aware increases tuition. It‚Äôs caused high school guidance councilors telling 99.99% kids walk doors since least early 90s college way. I‚Äôm also well aware wages haven‚Äôt adjusted inflation makes point even clear. College isn‚Äôt everyone certainly shouldn‚Äôt racks $90k debt without rock solid plan pay it. 

Your examples ‚Äúentitlements‚Äù entitlements all. Roads funded fuel taxes (ie user pays them). Post offices, though subsidized certain extent federal taxes also user funded organization. 

You go societal benefits educated populace. really really don‚Äôt need another 2M graduates business degrees year land jobs baristas educated society. doctors, scientists engineers went college prior 90s. They‚Äôll continue go. thing types positions good ones rise top become successful regardless boundaries put place. 

By way shortage doctors absolutely nothing shortage people willing work willing tackle education. American Medical Association complete monopoly many doctors chooses allow in. association purpose kept numbers low drive demand ones let drive cost care everyone creating artificial demand. AMA blames cap placed amount residences paid Medicare law passed due lobbying. Hmm. sure grayed out. allowing me.

Answer: deaths increasing (yet?)   Ah yes, proper use interrobang. majority aren't? Iron Chef home edition Yemen dude Wow. think I'd ever see Chekhov reference reddit. find entertaining love kind show. I‚Äôm obsessed circus though love acrobatic performances. went amazing burlesque circus recently (precovid) called Soiled Dove. everyone going strip club ‚Äúget worked up‚Äù people go entertainment. local gym opened last Friday -- way hell going pandemic over. stupidity selfishness excuse?

Mostly, I'm thinking: I'll burn bridge get it. MF ain't nobody watching fox news, read article Washington Post. human beings human beings, tragic loss resulting uniquely human quality: willful ignorance. comment

Top part = gyms fucking disgusting 

Bottom part = still went Good hear. wasn‚Äôt like two weeks ago, admit haven‚Äôt driven since. Jesus Christ would likely tell idiot. English hard. you, governor, responsible covid surge Florida?

DeShitis says NO. failure system allows single point failure happen. executive branch much control. Normally, government pay different. drug takes 10 billions funding research $50 create drug, can‚Äôt forced set price loss least make 10 billions back. Otherwise, company fund research future. I've waiting fellow compassionate human come woods focus something tit tats. Welcome!

Edit: misspelled word (sometimes humanish thing spell word wrong entire land reddit jumps ass calls dumbass!) Yeah, boss could done something too. 

I‚Äôm saying younger people aren‚Äôt drivers surge. I‚Äôm saying, thing one position authority told to.  contrary, desantis opened bars beaches said, doctors telling us follow rules, won‚Äôt consequences don‚Äôt follow them. 

Then, shit hit fan, Desantis throws bus. Real leadership there. Better Mike Pence‚Äôs ‚Äúit‚Äôs good news young ppl get infected.‚Äù

As said

It‚Äôs like tragedy foresee, can‚Äôt anything, Florida months today prevent upcoming tragedy. going? want same. HEROS act $100 billion earmarked rental relief. question get Senate. Probably since helps businesses. Ah, nice! South Florida taking seriously rest Florida. Florida really like three states jammed together. 130k? Sounds like reporting me. don‚Äôt even know anyone who‚Äôs covid, let alone died it! 


/s It‚Äôs false comparison. wouldn‚Äôt use one other. use different stages disease.

If it‚Äôs really true dexamethasone better cheaper one care price remdesivir. would use dexamethasone give shit charges remdesivir. would never use anyway.

But reality used. sorry accusing hypocrisy. different anti lock protests? Covid still thing, spike cases country including places opening opening quickly. One group evil selfish righteous. understand anyone can't see hypocrisy people treated. large group form one reason different group allowed same. one three gene targets SARS-CoV2 amplified qPCR. authors detect SARS-CoV-2 samples 2019 March. Rather, detect IP2/IP4 resembling SARS-CoV-2. Whatever virus E N1/N2 SARS-CoV-2. Unfortunately, mask wearing strongly associated political leaning largest difference mask wearing across demographics.

It's insane think that's driving factor public opinion rather science common Elective surgeries needed. Visitors unless say end life etc. maybe say parent young child much. almost always happens meat particular happened things too. Given mainly happened meat, scanned get right price, think they're screwing up.

My bet scanning reason giving you, maybe even taking home themselves. mom end extra bag Walmart pickup weeks ago could also innocent mistakes. frequency? 'm curious Wave 1 wave 2? between? real point I've ever arguing state completely locked non-essential businesses, gardening centers stores open. Suddenly got bunch people angrily telling great garden stupid know nothing sacred art gardening they'll literally starve death can't go retail store buy plants couple months save lives.

You selfish PoV breathtaking though. ""well reduces risk"". know many workers would risk exposure open complete lockdown? I‚Äôm Naples. already know we‚Äôre fucked weekend beaches remain open here. offense anyone, kind people load car wife kids flood onto certainly overcrowded beaches aren‚Äôt kind people give crap anyone else. work hotel dreading inevitable ridiculousness likely ensue. Umm. think thinking. underage, yes forced go person that's school requires. not, they're still forced circumstance, parents paying tuition, scholarship. Depends you‚Äôre protesting. 100% üÖ±Ô∏èLMwanted protest closed beaches media left would allow back it. media glorified protesting know üÖ±Ô∏èLM money funneled left leaders camp funds. banana Michael, much cost? 10 dollars? People completely unable see forest trees comes anything COVID related. really crazy me.

All clutch pearls scream ""DO SOMETHING!"" ""SHUT DOWN!"" realize actually entails. simultaneously think ""we can't possibly allow people thousand miles outdoor beach"" thinking fine thousands people protest together inches other...

I'm getting really tired completely politicalization hypocrisy all. virus thee virus me.

Sweden probably right along, no-lockdown would similar far less economic/social impacts. graph let change ""deaths"". grayed me. also. wanting see deaths going up. really stat want see. I'm concerned peolle got it. deaths stay low, relieved. can't see graph reason. Might I'm phone. sure. way late affect next weeks growth, late stop next month's. slow moving train, takes lot time get speed long time slow momentum. CBS poll ask Houston Phoenix residents. entire country, 41% said good. Lots areas (especially small towns suburban) hit people ones probably agree. Enjoy cancer that‚Äôs eating alive everyday, we‚Äôre glad dead buried soon. may wearing pants tank-looking thing. hard starve USA. may enjoy eating do, starve government handouts. Rice, beans canned goods friends. Farming joining coop farm good way save money food. Unfortunately one teaches real world skills anymore, last generation needed skills people survived great depression WWII victory gardens. dead point. good books subject picked lot grandparents. 

During first crash delivered Pizza PM 'real' job. Specifically get free food. elaborate prove it. Either put shut up. Stop. nobody getting publicity could ever hoped for. encourages washed performers follow suit act reckless publicity.  

I couldn‚Äôt give fewer shits entire fan base everyone social circles gets critically ill stupidity. 6ft even 10ft rule isn‚Äôt 100% accurate especially gym people breathing hard. Good news people legitimately high risk probably risking going gym contact probably super minimal wearing mask.

But trying say social distancing ‚Äúenough‚Äù gym expecting others agree fallacy.  strategy!. extensive, detailed, thorough strategy prepared previous administrations, Trump ignored it. May ask there‚Äôs still testing symptomatic people? overwhelming majority US landlords giant corporate landlords.

source please. know live 90% landlords individuals.  Saying something like ‚Äûcalled it‚Äú seems rather ghoulish situation, don‚Äòt think? Well, right numbers

 

Most new uptick cases 18-34. course says yes. DeSantis blame. Yeah. lot fields assume something wrong long enough gap. screw live landlords they're minority? Nice. live landlord bought teacher, I'd get priced city live buy price equally, appreciate looking out. I'm glad dumb politicians are, they're still dumb enough suggesting.

And course ignore issue forcing pay house people free, forced provide services free answer that. business treated way making business issue. FL fudging numbers skeptical FL's numbers prediction FL going end like NY? think trouble visualizing small 16√ó10 driveway actually is. That's nearly average length car width two cars. takes three hours multiple breaks shovel circumstances, weakest person planet. Same. I've working 2-3 hours day past year so. Used go gym cardio lunch go lift weights work. February last time gym though, shit started heating bought exercise equipment working home. 

Of course can't get good workout home gym. dumbells, curl bar, bench, medicine ball, jump rope ab wheel - probably less $200 equipment. Definitely wish equipment + body weight excercises stay great shape keep busy hours day. live pretty small apartment lift living room. There's excuse going gym right now, selfish fucks putting rest us risk. 

If feel need go gym get good workout dead wrong. midst worst pandemic 100 years, case numbers climbing everywhere. need adjust behavior chance beat thing. Ignoring rationalizing shitty choices make virus go away. ""No option perfect, therefore even try take extra precautions."" - logic. young old people creating cases surge, simply politics, think hoax think bad, higher ups saying. 

Manys arguments wearing mask played beginning many leaders, leaders said useful.

We far away able absorb new information modern day people can't wrap heads around told masks work we're told do, even understand concept people able change stance presented facts. Gym goers fully aware body weight exercises. think they're paying gym membership? them, body weight exercises either boring and/or suited needs (hard squat deadlift without weights...).

Some need leave house hit gym stay motivated/disciplined, too, makes sense.

So yeah, fuck ""fake exercise people"" attitude. Thank positive post. name?

At least lockdown, Congress could mandate interruption coverage, payroll protection, continued COVID waivers health care, etc. need remind

no Miami Gardens Cop Arrested Charge Battery Pregnant Black Woman

üì∑[Nicholas news reporter Forbes, primarily covering U.S. South.Updated Jun 26, 2020, 10:27am EDT

TOPLINE

A  recently fired Miami Gardens police officer shown  graphic video January holding knee pregnant Black woman‚Äôs  neck tasing multiple times stomach arrested  charged battery official misconduct, Miami-Dade State  Attorney announced Thursday.

The  officer, Jordy Yanes Martel, seen video dragging  33-year-old Safiya Satchell vehicle putting knee  neck stunning twice Taser, Satchell  screams. someone admires Dr. Fauci. Tell gov't... tell senate... ain't doin' jack jack. article put it: US system single point failure, president. build tracker know spread levels concerning. look data every country publishing daily basis. Even countries ""under control"" still experiencing hundreds new cases day. Every country still tipping point exponential spread... - like India, Brazil US thick exponential spread. ever was
Same ever already tried running away them. Retailmenot  Yes do. vast majority restaurants unable provide outdoor seating. CCP allow ream well selected places investigate guarantee wrong results. wining, dining ""entertainment"" ensure ""right answer "" too. Exactly. closing. got friends family work service industry Pensacola. said last weekends packed record. Gonna crazy... You‚Äôd surprised. mean it‚Äôs stupid point casual listener hearing ‚Äúold people already death‚Äôs door making virus seem worse is.‚Äù Regardless true misleading it‚Äôs common talking point hear conservative friends. quote fails prove claim R&amp;D funded public money. suspect true really can't arsed hunting sources I'll let guys continue. quite bots saying needed re-open economy immediately. Ok, even *proven* adverse effects general public, proven effects people breathing difficulties also *no proven effect* *having protective benefit stopping viral respiratory infected person could become sicker wearing mask, *lot* people could become infected sick person person wear mask.

As said another post, RTC study - many - ever carried actually proves theory. Even did, ethics clear: 

In words, debate one ethics politics - one based science. mean kind makes sense, don‚Äôt put short term savings market.

I won‚Äôt comment debt vs buying house, idk situation probably lick coronavirus Even young 0.2% chance death...

According to? [5310 Sweden, 8 20-29 years old. 0,001% chance. Nursing homes everywhere hard hit COVID-19. surprises here. let die? Hell no. ill look investing :) like dip need want it. Yeah that‚Äôs pretty bad, agree. 

Since you‚Äôre soo interactive, maybe correct it. Think like puzzle. Weren‚Äôt poster wanted us say person schooling fall? Wouldn‚Äôt person school help solve concern have?

By way, AAP recommends person school happen link kind stats, maybe State State? people saw saying almost 100% business started stock buybacks asking federal money. problem likely spread others well. you. Yeah, shouldn‚Äôt surprise all. Summer makes easier outside, least Michigan better inside masks. lived awhile, possible things could different now. 

I moved back mine, used butt heads constantly teenager. initially, heated fights boundaries, since I've teenager I've lot better maintaining cool expressing certainly expectations boundaries, reminding (rather, tell me) old importance mutual respect on. 

I help lot here, buy often groceries, mow shovel, etc. they're definitely getting deal vs empty room. mostly get along.

But establishing expectations little hard, sometimes still is, though get fighting much realizing they've overstepped. How? Please explain anything worse death? Fucking Disney world worse death? meant sure, forced go Epcot. worse death. successful. virus loves them. seems like you‚Äôre one people actually read article present facts.  calls probably go like: ""Open faster, ignore virus get economy going make someone look better."" Yeah humans want black people treated standards white people American police forces. Sure. wear mask try maintain 6 feet distance. cases virus transmitted people outdoors wearing masks. make sense though. ICU stays upwards 10k/day? saves average patient day that's worth alot insurance company. Considering almost assuredly already hit pocket max they're icu. think big misconception Trump. Hes dumb, hes ignorant. Theres difference.

His base anti-mask rhetoric. dont form ideas &amp; opinions.

I think wants out. Hes making money president. whole base followers economically exploit. It‚Äôs weird shut everything much less, it‚Äôs worse shut but...we need open up... literally says ""news"" top page.

This science journalism. science translated lay audience. sad common sense proven days nonsense runs rampant. Well, hes still living city. ü§î

What's advice then? ""Just stick man something come up, what's 12 years.""

Never recomend moving. Got it. Pretty sure there's nothing legally do. Wearing masks makes country look like Communist China. Americans. lab rats. rights prohibit forcive requirements like this. read Constitution cover cover? have. Every word. There's nothing stating governments force people wear anything. Karolinska Institute Karolinska University Hospital researchers behind report, AstraZeneca private company develops vaccine. far aware, researchers different. way good news, appauling. need focus next bill protecting funding giving supplies old people homes. know else drew big crowd yesterday? PRIDE march NYC.

The bias much. okay bro? Need call helpline you? Wanna bet? even worse coronavirus. Please spend money fine establishments economy! Here's $1200 stimulate spending!

Sick?

NO SICK SPEND frown places. Scary thing people, even catch virus recover, still learn lesson maintain right, covid ""just flu"" cuz recovered it. I‚Äôve seriously considered killing self living parents. tired winning... relying money would put market, cannot ""afford"" market yet. -- I'm try gate-keep shame way, raising (as sounds aware) prudent emergency fund cover expenses mitigate risk taking equity positions. Recipe disaster... I'd say we've already made recipe, put pan ready oven. Well didnt work planed. üòâ ‚ÄúSome‚Äù We... idea. That‚Äôs pretty surprising it‚Äôs low compared countries. going nice meal restaurant April. That's really misleading statements behalf. First all, know number friends even relative excellent shape, contracted COVID ended very, bad shape. One essentially bed-ridden 2 weeks athlete, drink, smoke lives healthy lifestyle...no underlying conditions. Another also healthy ended ventilator, again, underlying conditions. please peddle 'if healthy, fine' bullshit. 


Secondly, gyms different concert, protest setting many people gather together ability interact closely transmit virus. example Canada that...an example Canada. can't compare apples oranges certainly can't compare one country reasonable leadership another country run orange. misrepresentation lock protests even disagreed with. guns funny people guns typically get tear gased assualted. I'm 90% violent actions police taken. time president wanted Bible photo shoot cleared area outside white house. horrible legal action taken. However people praise BLM people turn around say can't gather funerals party. I'm saying either smart necessary. want standards applied everyone regardless politics reason. I'm sure nothing stoping someone Texas, Florida ever high infection state take transfer low infection one get around restriction. way prove person ""safe"" state didnt come back one high risk states. can't overstate much want one fans, afford ones lights üò≠ I'm choosing remain hopeful. put ass 29 years, beat COVID too. Thanks much support.  racism racism regardless group directed first wave bad imagine second one terms new cases daily, we‚Äôre bad March right now. Here's need turn tides

1) new President

2) ..... That's believe, too.

And think demanding better articles better job holding power responsible forcing us make impossible decisions.

Why alleged journalists better job asking questions, making distinctions? investigate? Btw happened Italian doctor claimed virus become less dangerous? end publishing evidence support claim? ""Employees partners e-commerce company June receive bonuses ranging $150 $3,000, company said""

I'm sure going length employment, $3000 bad bonus, I'm assuming majority get far less. Wow, California bigger leader Trump administration. live Hollywood Beach. Absolutely one taking seriously. Young old, they're here. I've even seen chemo patients (or appeared be) walking around without masks.  not? nevermind suspicions then. Even maddening though insurance companies care get ripped off. hospital one overnight... asked itemized bill thing sent insurance company. extra night day adding charge meals extra night, works. called told insurance company going ripped even hospital 3 days care... worry already paid bill owe anything. Yes, response give ""advice"" sucks. honestly think already considered ""simple"" option moving? Seriously? 12 years person never thought ""maybe move""? really think helping that? 

Lol may true, that‚Äôs great news. get deaths reasonable level proceed economy mostly open get   Gonna spend time Southeast Asia go there. missing point. reason hospital charge insane US healthcare system. hospitals, private insurance companies US government blame. Healthcare needs regulated federal level prices set/negotiated government. fucking country planet healthcare expensive. means. Keep rioting looting. well, lot people certainly dont recognize ""Constitutional rights"" regards virus. certainly didnt recognize talking lockdown protesters. im seeing original comment thread (deleted), heres article pretty much peak hypocrisy : I'm baffled mask refusal people.

A lot people want look ""manly"" wearing mask, like trying impress fuckin virus. boyfriend's work threw celebratory party able go back office, also one wore masks office pretty much ever. Surprise, surprise, there's outbreak week later I'm allowed go job nursing home job delivering pizzas since live many people work office. reminder ""no evidence support"" often another way saying ""rigorous research yet done"". case here. rigorous body research showing benefit would likely hear ""has shown"", ""is unlikely to"", even ""has shown to"".

I'm saying wrong. I'm making recommendation regarding vitamin d. I'm putting proper context oft used phrase ""no evidence support"". Mine (anytime) proactively suspended everyone‚Äôs accounts stopped charging ‚Äúreopening 25%‚Äù call cancel - left voicemail know it‚Äôs going pain ass - already knew would fact can‚Äôt manage cancel account online like... service.  Better ran against, he's running now. check date this. Yup, new story they‚Äôre sending team NEXT week instead say 5 months ago Yeah mask campaign kinda blowing mind right even though totally understand important are. I‚Äôm reading China locking 400,000 people 18 cases, think masks going save us tens thousands cases we‚Äôre seeing day? pointed small town, non-urban, accounts 20% population... even 100% approval (which not); even half way 41%. SWCO. there's mountain goats people.. Americans selfishhardheaded pieces shit humans are. depends. guaranteed payment revenue comes back in? count place holder someone else doesnt get job time get jobs back? back pay minimum wage limit? Even 5 bucks would help feed child. letting child sleep couch payment shoveling dog shit? would take things consideration. 

I think point I'm trying make bad spot super desperate anything survive even sacrificing working 10x harder pay receiving. pay better none. Landlords unwilling middle ground sacrificing betterment people ""I'm getting paid"". Instead asking...can pay half? anything all? work properties properties? bad structural issue needs fixed tenants issue mine homeowner? help fix problem get done little cost? I've helped landlords fix structural issues problem. Never asked pay take money rent. argument doesnt make sense went there. 

I compassion landlords, power scale brought consideration children involved. 

Our government failing us. That's it. agree, I'm basically saying go crowded bar ""because open"" still asshole Millennials gen z two different groups admire optimism, boris Johnson still give fuck. people watch east asia everyone wearing mask acting idiotic? Paywall, cut paste please.    That‚Äôs reassuring. I‚Äôd like thorough. It‚Äôs properly evaluate one‚Äôs health. Donovan's Reef Sea Bright picture...the bar area actually kind open, big. There's bar beach, too. Nah that's always obvious text especially considering percentage people falling myths Florida. /s helps :) Essentially he's saying u get Covid die ur fault Well, problem solved then. guess. hell going drive south Florida north/central Florida holiday weekend? reason places like Washington DC hasn‚Äôt seen spike anywhere near Florida Texas? stupid piece crap spewed Warren? course not. stupid beyond belief?

Other legislation help? Definitely.

Both sides trying sweeten population. issue timing. fourth package come. Probably late July August. think really answers questions. Taiwan appear good job, made sound like questions obvious/easy answers based math, logics statistics 101. risk death. conversation whether would prefer die lose job.

You dramatic say would die couple months without job. I‚Äôm going keep G-rated possible, bear me. put simply: strip club services aren‚Äôt advertised.

Some people go strip clubs level interaction cannot get porn. Half naked ladies chat them, give relationship advice, agree boss asshole. Plus get lap dance two. don‚Äôt time social skills GF, strip clubs keep feeling starved affection.

Some people go strip clubs lose connections, still want party. want connected sex worker party drugs, strip club good place seek sources both. people go strip clubs they‚Äôre open bars close lot sell alcohol loooooong last call.

None stuff written sign. usually go ‚ÄúGirls! Girls! Girls!‚Äù Yes, fucking lame. Nothing done. Employers cant control people's lives outside work. Although imo good time protest pandemic, none protest open back BLM caused spike either like thought would. caused spike opening almost everyone said threw guidelines. Sure protest caused spreading I've seen small cases both. Right everyone right protest can't stop it. Even mask protests right even though hate I'm huge, huge properly wearing masks. Outside gatherings slow transmission virus way down. I'm still go still worth risk rare vasculitis disease. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs mid May lull. picked last week kinda dwindled again. Fuck. Hopefully doesn‚Äôt give wv breakout. tell Florida. gonna use excuse keep everything open 'nursing home' people dying. Watching distant Hawaii, it‚Äôs gonna quite show üçø Still going indoor yoga class. mask fingers? sound like functional political system. governor MIA? Chloroquine doesn‚Äôt work all. Remdesivir doesn‚Äôt work well. There‚Äôs difference Canada one strictest lockdowns? 10 million cases got 500k deaths. 20m(an estimate) even near 10% 338m nowhere near estimated 70% required herd immunity. still protection there. know solution involve evicting 10 million human beings. 

Landlords human beings, like me, many functional human people, hearts feelings compassion. 

My hope find hearts absorb bad month, kick people streets pandemic. Compounding depression that's coming millions homeless needed right now. Sidenote, used live Palm Harbor &amp; *man* miss hanging Dunedin/stopping drink way home working Clearwater Beach. correct. isn‚Äôt silver bullet hey, it‚Äôs pandemic, someone‚Äôs gotta make money America. Unless banned, go want Reddit. guess endure Firstly, I‚Äôm making anything. one likes people pretending victims. Secondly, government push Eighteenth Amendment Bill not? previous President, Jacob Zuma, dancing song killing white farmers? current President political party? Fun fact, company makes fans called Big Ass Fans. also have, least had, funniest hold ‚Äúmusic‚Äù. basically guy ranting awful hold usual hold music infuriating. answer Nice Touch contact biggest risk. It‚Äòs hanging air (which lot due huffing puffing gym) length exposure (probably hour more.) Even though people pretty good countering misinformation, see trolling misinformation there. Mostly people fearmonger outbreak say must shut everything there's vaccine. anybody US team? fact send people back February. would drug companies put money drugs fight pandemics expected without making money. shareholders answer to, can‚Äôt please.  Another difference NFL need fields.  location artificial turf house bubble league NFL. That‚Äôs really option even worth trying.  Trying play games different NFL stadiums isn‚Äôt going work need turf put teams one location regular field get torn much traffic. says feels okay able eat much wants sleep. I‚Äôm sure glad America wait extra weeks. /s Mississippi. I‚Äôm visiting. People fucking idiots died tomorrow rental condo would fall parents, grief would probably sell unit. economy, unit likely bought somebody already owns lot units, would raise rent back going market rate area. Would shovel dog shit day every day weren‚Äôt getting wage? That‚Äôs think landlord arguing with‚Äôs perspective boils see explosion deaths? Surprised position sub. plenty stories actually addressing cases low regards protests. hold motions tightly. Maybe one day sell eBay manage increase value. pass heirlooms kin. point comment? quote? No, that's meant. Vaccines go one two initial trials 100 people they're proven effective not. vaccine still trial phase.

But I'm saying pairing elective surgeries visitation one way make jobs difficult already difficult time.

And think that's unreasonable thing us say. Recall ""last time around"" Florida testing young people much. Well CDC struck draconian testing criteria Florida still required things like _pneumonia unknown cause hospitalization_ get test. age restrictions lasted even longer.

Young people got sick last time. Lots. see prohibited looking. walk stage stick money glass spit. classic 'murica also opened. things spiking CA, risk high. don‚Äôt understand decision. Seems like breeding ground. way safe. really miss it. Wow! Using science sources gets downvotes?

Also assumed large amount risk going increasing production January even knew would work. didn‚Äôt work would assumed tens maybe hundreds millions dollars losses. one government would gave shit. would went ‚Äòoh well‚Äô moved on.

Finally look overall picture. Gilead specialty pharma unique expertise anti virals. everyone, even big players (Pfizer, etc...) expertise.

At end day, there‚Äôs areas outrage drug pricing valid. don‚Äôt believe one them. Gilead done book huge gambles early donation millions doses.

Edit: Also remdesivir originally developed Ebola significant financial risk itself. Ebola virus lot people get (so many potential patients) basically centered third world (Africa). strictly looking reducing risk probably wouldn‚Äôt even developed remdesivir. you‚Äôre going let make kind profit reward risk took don‚Äôt even know say.  process seriously bonkers. doctor ordered couple tests. gave number call estimates, told go clinic location estimate location high. said identical test people cheaper.

I checked online estimate tool. quoted $2,400.

Our insurance wacky glitch halfway plan (which still shitty) catastrophic health plan. So, called fixed. get code return information insurance time, insurance started giving wacky details called. $850.

Paired governor business, 4th July weekend going lethal here. agree this. feel good probably good. true. think states cases, good data collection/reporting, robust test trace, citizens willing take basic precautionary measures, it'd fine. Unfortunately, many here, can't lock borders states. prior lockdown. took kids everywhere us, learning life skills like budgeting, meal planning, behave public, etc. weeks lockdown, TP shortage took last group shopping trip gone anywhere besides riding car pickups riding bikes around neighborhood near-by bike path.

It‚Äôs like investment, using blanket statement buying stocks gambling wrong. shutting next year? So, knowingly assisting ppls deaths. Got it. No, believe *you* missed sarcasm... DeSantis made absolutely effort ask people wear masks. issued mask order. told anyone wear mask. latest version people may wear masks want. one surprised don't.

An executive order masks ""required"", would long way toward convincing people wear them.  explanation required, would also help. tell something, explain important, people cooperate.

By making absolutely effort control virus, governor DeSantis heading toward total shutdown. people give virus older co-workers (e.g., boss, owner), company shut location. one specifically? city live....its usually much cheaper tho Dunno --- many wear masks protest?

In relevant threads protests subreddit, many claimed 90%+.

I work Seattle, one 'hot spots' protests 2nd wave infections.

I tell firsthand experience --- 90% protesters denizens CHOP/CHAZ wearing facemasks.

It's easy forget Trump knew Corona back January. post mortem research suggests problem early November/December. may think that's outside control big issue orgs responsible identifying problems gutted terms competent personel funding thanks Trump administration.

And fact handling hundred, hundred cases early outbreak vastly easier coordinate. Compare ignoring it, spreading blatant misinformation actually blocking CDC others making necessary decisions.

yes, absolute hell. kids adapted well (assuming computer/wifi resources begin with) parents afford take help, struggle teach working home.

But absolutely hell.

To think on-line learning/school closings big deal people worse, I'd try make work deadlines teaching kids seen friends 4 months straight see fare.

They last week, let alone 4 months. yes, would call hell.

You say school closings necessary still admit despite valiant efforts educators, on-line learning failure - hell teachers, kids, parents alike.

My point Almost EVERY SINGLE *WORKING* AGE GROUP GETTING FUCKED way another. *Blinkers* millennials special regard. surely hearing next 40 years .... even way retirement headlines going read something like this

Either way, generational talk total bullshit look certain groups people done well matter generation in.. long fine dandy that? can't like 'wah generation."" .. generation exactly? supposed venerate else? live here?

Look history... look happens every 10 years so... major war terrorist act sort disrupts people way. happening way millennials. sadly going keep happening... generations even notice right now. 

Our next president clean up.. president fuck things up.. etc etc ... Automation going take almost everything human do.....All environment really going make us feel sorry past actions make whole situation even worse. None us immune _none us prepared what's coming.

So going _try_ prepare this? gonna keep generational level status quo ""as long white family friends ok, buying whole foods driving prius game? finally gonna realize problem way bigger **just you** little generation college kids?

USA: 6.5 Million Deaths

India: 27,060,000 Deaths

&amp;#x200B;

As spreading fast though, hospitals overwhelmed Ventilators medicines provide, fatality rate probably closer 5%. 

In scenario, India ALONE likely see excess 100 Million deaths  pandemic shown UBI needed shit There's lot misinformation here. doctor's visit includes test mandated paid government. go ER... stupid. Make doctor's appointment go clinic. stop spreading disinfo. What's risk? 

The risk would getting paid rent losing building, getting bankruptcy record (making renting hard ironically), loss entire payment money paid mortgage.

I think would risk.

I would agree mortgage freeze (as 3 months) appropriate rent freeze. Property tax insurance would nice live fantasy land. case mortgage/rent freeze track together.

Everyone around going wearing something looks like spacesuit. position, it‚Äôs either jack vaccine, take risks go job/live. Struggling pick want breathe fucking tube throat that's sure! people got infected now, die die 3 weeks. Today's deaths represent infections occurred weeks ago, daily deaths can't really give much information future virus' spread thus future deaths. ""Hopefully see spike"" sounds, unfortunately, (and opinion) bit naive. coming months seem worst ones come, realistically. Exactly - we're caught catch-22. rational people leave, we'll even extreme / bigoted leaders running world's largest economy military (including nuclear stockpile).

Why effort make mask wearing hip,cool,sick whatever current slang is.   study patients, enough power decent effect size. think remdesivir effective reducing mortality. placebo group 12% mortality, compared 22% mortality cohorts, implying better-off patients received remdesivir.

Also, may date COVID info changes fast, infections traced back aircraft. cuomo sent sick people back nursing homes infect rest. thats murder Trump himself, specifically. mean sure hell help, overall administration &amp; outward look nation.

If ""just"" social policies belong 1800s, well really affect us. ""just"" protectionist trade stances, well ideal, least predictable. keeps getting worse.

There's famous quote, think Churchill, knowing internet I'm probably always count Americans right thing - they've tried everything else.

One side pro one side anti.  


I find interesting number health professionals saying things like ""Why turning politicians health advice?!?!?!"" I'm sure getting 5%. IFR .14% 64 younger goes down. 5% 65 over. CDC Penn State studies stating could missed 20 million cases beginning. assumption would base price charged hospitals. Insurance companies would negotiate hospitals set price pay.  insurance pocket would lower depending network copay details. insurance, likely default amount hospital take loss write off. Wait, charge medicine works? get medicine work cheaper?

Why would system even exist able get ""medicine work"" lower cost? seems like political content finally legally kill lower class Lmao let's pretend Australia roll go ""how high?"" whenever US says ""Jump""

Not nothing Australia jumped eyes wide open every conflict US started, taken pride it. fact, Australia bends backwards much pretend like US never pulled coup lmao still travel?  Like said, cases evidence every day.  easy search.  Everyone focused death rates post recovery issues drawing attention should. wait year? way tell people Sweden,

You need able tell Sweden. makes sense start policing Sweden allow people Sweden.

It makes sense Swedes start policing Denmark allows people Denmark, like leaving country. Again, Danes entering Sweden bother Sweden. would much easier educate Swedish governtment closed border :)

So saying easier educate Swede Dane? Well, say so. allright, screw it? want us it? could always something like Norway enforce quarantine quarantaine ATM voluntary, yes think enforeced. hoping change enforced.

Do even need ask question plan answer yourself? think agree online classes ideal, upcoming year that. two least bad option, going back normal going happen either way. either risky/restricted person classes online classes. likely mix childcare big concern many parents others refuse even consider sending in. Nothing worry about...it's young people positive tests repeated dozens time per person s/. pandemic really shows whichever party adhering rules pandemic, needs deleted every ballot position power.. Europeans never trusted US, never trusted them.  wait! telling federal freedom breathe agency?

obligatory /s Yes, OP said young people done themselves, others might infect. Oh my! stupidity level increase another notch! agree that. We're mired semantics lets move on.

I personally trust second lockdown implemented way mitigate economic depression.

I know way forward policy inplementation federal level needs carefully measured consideration pandemic economy, socio-political tensions current geopolitical realities.

Its lack consideration latter subreddit thar decry. posted article number times. actually read it? exactly support arguing. fact, specifically states vaccines require 3 separate trial runs Phase 3 reduced 1 time. Reduced testing result catching ever safety issue.

As based past coronavirus - think SARS. still different never working coronavirus vaccine considered safe enough. Obviously, differences still facts.
Anyway, SARS vaccine stopped couple reasons. SARS burned vaccine also causing health issues.

SPACES NECESSARY PERIODS. MAKES THINGS HARD READ LIKE CAPS DOES. Came across \[an article\]( ) today people continue test positive past point longer contagious. raised interesting question me: tests people known virus counted statistics? woman article tested positive repeatedly 55 days. Assuming tested every 5 days so, that's 10 positive tests. show percent positive repeat tests ignored? across states/provinces/countries? Anyone else imagine BBCs coming gaping mouths? Pretty sure NY approached Memorial Day (I think Memorial Day) made plan NJ CT together open beaches one state closed people rush states overflow beaches parks. Ok SEEDS mean things get online without demanding entire industry ""essential"" eat cheaper produce (which already incredibly cheap US subsidies)? one big difference Netherlands right taken account, far fewer Brits there!

A good point!! 


Virtual tenner, on. \*socially distanced handshake\* :) ignorant comment.

Some acting people COVID-19 loitering hospital 2 weeks.

Hospital stay takes resources costs money. $3000 worth drug gets someone 4 days faster. think misunderstand - person talking executive order someone signed regarding tearing down. act tearing down. always get arm pain feel like really good workout gym like 3 days. kind like Humans better suited living around 25 + C. Trump, American general population State level bureaucracies. finding latter two longer trustworthy given current stellar reaction management pandemic. thought Trump fluke, COVID proved enough % Americans really selfish, stubborn, shortsighted. Start Roth IRA. thing stopping you. post public forum confused people respond.

ooooooookay. That's actually surprising hear experience HEB incredibly top this. They've one best prepared IMO. Trust US world leader collapsed, irreparable. elect competent president competent politicians around him/her attitudes go back normal. world really needs USA help fighting climate change, surely president apart idiot Trump board that. asked question Basic right wing platform Europe something like anti-EU, anti-immigration, lower taxes. platform? better worse, universal healthcare system would probably give patients drug en masse fancy new cancer drugs. UK's NHS panel decide gets drug often deny expensive ones patients. second surge first one never ends Every city eventually going agree face masks ordinance. matter many people die lol arizona? developed Ebola outbreak used even ""research"" extend. especially developed SARS-Cov2 virus? No?
That makes ""rather new"" medecine yet ""brand new"".

My comment totally irrelevant.

By way cost cents dose, thousand dollar day treatment actually ""american"" price ask. guess much less (european) country.

But believe usefulness seems bit HCQ : much. annnnnnnnnnnnd comes Virus getting downvoted speaking nothing truth. also work healthcare everything said correct. Yeah fuck that. also don‚Äôt quite see want push price governments Basic logic?

I mean message would racist even sent someone black, obviously wasn't. Pay tenant's rent then. Fuck last decade brutal us. think say gave public enough time get mask one. Yeah fine, mild illness sound like really smart trainer. Great ideas. way trying divert blame away charge. High school teacher here.

This last spring given pretty short notice (in districts) everything going online. district even get students set laptops figure connectivity issues waited long time close. 

Ideally, districts would invest time resources summer revamping potential online learning. I'm holding breath I'm trying get set teach online.

Honestly, biggest barrier teaching kids showing scheduled online learning, completing homework, responding attempts contact them. offered office hours offered help work hours needed help. students followed that.

If view online learning comes kid saying teacher anything, giving homework, contact teacher make sure getting whole story. check r/TalesFromYourServer. Waitstaff posting similar stories hiding infections close country. Restaurants safe. They're barely safe pandemic. Wait brother got attack chopper? need visit ass wow Nope. Maybe perception warped, feel like really significant proportion us humans barely hanging onto mental threads. Makes sense booze big big.

Not justify anything eh, indulging substances dry cut ""get hobbies"" nursing homes? covid test $300 insurance paid $180, owe $0

But everything else. Yes costs billions. Yes remdesivir gone several lives including failures. don‚Äôt think detracts central profit/risk equation. government wants cut check month (or direct deposit account) let people stay apartments current rent, I'll it. First entry : us government I'm talking ppl sub. There's definitely herd mentality here. I've watched one getting gained on. Simply asking question fit direction narrative lead name calling, ect.

I'm talking real life. Ppl watch news. majority Americans FB Instagram. media huge disservice witnessed it. One cry wolf much ppl care anymore. trying completely ignore positive news messing up. Encouraging rewarding (low death numbers) go long way. Rarely ppl see well give up. anything inspires stay course. know Phase 1, 2 3 test new vaccine Human? difference scale. finished phase 1 2 test. Talking guinea pigs basically shows idea talk about. virus likely even infect Guinea pigs, what's point testing shut TX, FL, AZ soon going get control. I'm tired economy coming human lives. Difference EBOLA never hit critical mass makes approach impossible. 

You fighting gravity here. virus wants spread, exponentially. point, rate contact tracing far outpaced growth virus. 

The best solution locked entire regions, reopen new cases appears region 2 weeks.

In mean time buildup infrastructure test contract tracing. meant solve first wave prevent second wave.

America basically fucked got really bad first wave. use 3 months lockdown build supplies prepare second wave (or like continuation first wave). kid ventilator would hell. child hit car ICU would hell. child cancer would hell.

Doing online classes child weeks hell.

We regularly deal driver issues, dial up, registry issues, etc.

Nowadays lot tech works there's competitor better product team makes one works.

I attribute lot ""technical abilities"" simply growing tech. Back literally troubleshoot things else plain work alternative.

How earth look evidence people *do* immunity like ‚Äúno, none counts?‚Äù

She‚Äôs right cases evidence doesn‚Äôt back people immunity. Uuhm last time heard India failing quiet hard Corona containment. Given border conflicts China India seems logical want vaccinate soldiers may come contact Indian soldiers. maybe bring back virus home create flare up. I'm really surprised given many hospitals completely restricted visitors everyone except end life patients seen angry family members going postal hospitals. Yep .. virus kill .... many going wish did. Inferior people generate carbon pollution choosing use machines release heat-trapping gases atmosphere. Lesser people like frequent flyers car owners need stop wrong thing better people. Hey compared covid wasnt actually bloodbath. 3-4 people eaten shark vs many exactly covid?

This certainly increases risk. why? nursing homes? Sorry hear :( Good! work 3 signs saying require masks, yet someone people try whole ""Oh see, need go back car get it?"". Well tell yes, one person made stink that. 90% people come one though. I'm accommodating someone else's ignorance pandemic. never led moron: Trump. know downvoted, right. US went full lockdown end March stayed inside April May, could playing outside rest summer. looks like going voluntary stay home orders till 2021 earliest want mitigate chances getting virus. generation hit hard twice global economic crashes they‚Äôre relatively young might exactly see stock market wise choice

I zero trouble understanding attitude think likely wrong one. Especially young enough afford (key word know lot!).

It interesting though. talking friend said one three people knows stock. one actually buys opposed inheritance gift. actually thought going say ""as opposed something like 401K"". also suspect one friends 401K. (I use 401K buy stock. buy stock, view long term. treat like savings account money goes in). Germs gym? would've thunk it? /s think technically instead hard ""k"" sound supposed pronounce like tickle throat. Like ""locgh"", kind of. Im curious, theres nice report hospital italy worst time - done US show population whats actually going - lets say - houston? I'm proud us despite one around town wearing face masks all. did. done every time I've gone out. one superdrug today though. even staff. Thanks guys. Im trolling fun, basically. likely go HIV route meaning vaccine exists? Why.... know you... south dumb? hypocrite. hope loses seat year. parents live basement?  Fox News *""Fair Balanced"" /s* Amazing. Coronavirus apparently sentient now. infects people want go bars workout, avoids people riot protest. Amazing. studies showed hydroxychloroquine helps observational. large RCT recently showed hurt help, enough close book drug. RCT remdesivir showed shorter hospital stay, significant (p=0.06) reduction mortality. Yea isn‚Äôt strictly transmission protests, it‚Äôs undermining lockdown causing people loosen Covid lockdown actions.

Well that's dumb fuck way think things. limited budget spend 70% big ticket item, means need cut back elsewhere take new line credit. No, really contradict point... enough people vote election, often interests due lack research/understanding, problem. 

We need get rid electoral college, right? that? vote, en masse, every election (especially local/midterms), people want gone instead sitting home crying it. 

Vote, cry others manipulated stay home election day people mentality rhetoric shoveling. You‚Äôre stretching.

1. Masks worn protestors.
2. Masks not, aren‚Äôt miracle virus protectors gathering 1000s advisable. aren‚Äôt sporting events allowing spectators masks?
3. young adults absolved responsibility inherently incapable it?
4. Ok blame politicians want failing act manner may lessened issue. say may aren‚Äôt anywhere near finish line many developed countries suffered similar fate. 

Anyway, thread people suddenly relaxed LA County leading surge cases. answer 1000s protestors undermining lockdown media taking 2-3 week break focus civil unrest racial tension allowing pandemic take back seat.

So 3 weeks later start wondering things gotten worse... that‚Äôs why. school taught us take random credit card debt pay back time interest order build credit rating. Except credit ratings work way.

I fan lying bridge far. States placed bans evictions late mortgage penalties. coukd utilities. funds go nothing life necessities. 

No wine white claws steaks. bread, beans, rice. stretch funds far way.

The government power make lockdown safe effective. never acted interest people, corporations. Arkansan here. one Asa's recent press conferences, directly addressed fact Texas closing bars again, denied spike cases due reopening. He's lying weasel.

When China could produce enough, prices stabilised us. send supplies. One issue already factored debate remdesivir cost U.S. government‚Äôs role funding NIAID funded study showed sped recovery hospitalized Covid-19 patients, expects spend least $30 million study end fiscal year, NIAID spokesman said also invested researching remdesivir. company previously developed drug treat Ebola patients, didn‚Äôt work well drugs.

The USA war, fight Nazi Germany. Many young men died thst war. managed stop murdering fashist regime would otherwise overrun Europe. Many see war just.

The USA also war Iraq. caused huge turmoil whole region, still causing death hunderts young Americans reason (to point make reason start war). Many see war just.

So it: Two wars, bit different Motivation behind them. reasons something taken account. hybris. common sense. Thank finally mentioning this. I‚Äôm tired people saying it‚Äôs Christians fault morons.

There's still massive shortage. Nothing got fixed. Saying wear masks made situation worse causing hospitals become overwhelmed, now.... again. almost like system empowers assholes. Rather pointing finger assholes need fix system.

Eliminate per-party primary.

Eliminate electoral college.

Or pretend whole fucked system magically fix itself. many people, growing food way afford fresh produce. 

Additionally, you‚Äôre ignoring benefit person longer needing buy much (if any) fresh produce future. didn‚Äôt buy fresh food, could limit grocery trips month most. Buying fresh food means go often week, spend longer store visiting multiple departments. 

Even single additional trip garden center, former scenario poses less risk latter. 

I think you‚Äôre bit myopic here. said, stuff happens place, Florida open policy sharing police reports results Florida Man stories. Vote! 5/41 around 12% positive? that's improvement it? steady? They've shut countries longer that. Miami ftl Monday Palm Beach Tuesday iirc obey thousands government mandated laws rules, questionable. wearing mask public places unacceptable overreach? COVID positive sub wonderful job showing people many complications months they've officially recovered.

These stories internet. caught enough people lying Covid experiences easily impressed.

I mean .. course ""worst case scenarios"" like double lung transplant Nick Cordero.

[There *also* woman got flu get quadruple studies focusing long term health consequences many. bulk research understanding virus beat it.

I actually would like see YouTube vids. *stuff winds youtube*. Covid survivor struggling permanent damage Covid .. that's ""interesting"". either person would maybe record journey, local news would story.

But footage like YouTube. videos suggestive titles, real solid cases people living permanent damage Covid. opinion still deserves Noble Prize. read graduate school. pleased find Jane Goodall's library shores Lake Tanganyika. forget, also nose trump's ass time! Stay course NY! example whole.country follow! really like article humanizes COVID-19 victims connecting names pieces life led behind.

It's weird completely unphased country deaths. I'm supposed never forget 9/11. spent trillions investigating Benghazi resulted deaths four embassy workers. Oklahoma City bombing still memorialized. Instacart anything? suggesting people apparently unable physically enter grocery store somehow totally OK entering Home Depot?

Amity means friendship! Unfortunately need use /s. People hate good news (not Florida case counts good news) unironically post things like ‚Äúcovid airborne AIDS!!!!!‚Äù

I think need wait weeks terms seeing whether deaths spike, genuinely believe virus less deadly treatments, better isolation protocols elderly, doctors knowledge manage it. Even entirely non-profit healthcare drug system, would still costs/effort/resources used developing manufacturing drugs. Therefore people would still cost-benefit analyses making decisions regarding best use limited resources.  listened press conference. probably could find reference Twitter. Right flights get much press go quarantine. Vic much bigger issues outbreak. God dammit. anything Sars-CoV-2 can't do? research virus, shit find. Yes too, though friends student debt, limited opportunities, high rent still spend whole paycheck dumb shit like fancy cheeses drinks try make anything happen enough $$$ I'm new this. :( Also, beginning, numbers reflected people metropolitan areas, black people, old people dying. R party always old people bag, two demographics generally *not* voter base. Convenient time 180 Texas, Arkansas, Florida projected face ""devastating loss"".

... 127,000 lives loss prior meant nothing them. wonder why? That's surprising, politicians elected good getting people vote them, that's basically good for. people penalized unhealthy behavior wearing masks insurance policies, strong incentive modify behavior. Yep, good analogy. One good things coming pandemic showing world much America sucks. don‚Äôt right considered world‚Äôs moral authority.  Florida. think enough? Nope. locals, tourists entitled fun beach time already paid vacation. Please continue point. hope American society anymore. That's true, teach it. there's FAR pressing things need addressed. Like insanely high cost higher education compared even 30 years ago, fact Citizens United even somehow thing. freedom die corridor laying floor hospital somewhere hospitals would surge capacity. guy basically lost frat boy head head matchup Survivor  mean, disaster already happening getting worse every day. bars closed since last week. still seeing tourists flood area. Shutting beaches might help stop this, know. TL;DR: Sweden restrictions many countries originally stricter measures. 

Luckily me, long read. check restrictions place across Europe fact *very similar* variations. 

However, interpretation - *once again* \- twisting distortion facts presented order persue personal / political agenda daily Sweden bashing. 

**To say ""Sweden restrictions many countries originally stricter measures"" lie. simply case.** 

The data shows one clear thing - ***as Europe re-opening, European countries moving towards similar strategy Sweden.*** Actually no, reddit arguing reddit idiotic hivemind everyone saying masks dont work.

Aftonbladet running shoddy jorunalism, (despite great articles) common modus operandi.‚Äù

The source article Norwegian Ekstrabladet even shoddy Expressen. Bad reporting Aftonbladet indeed. suits actually filed Warren County Sandusky County, Ohio clarified allowed open actually went suing them. hope enforce mask rule, envy teenage employees dealing people insisting don‚Äôt wear masks. Apparently Dollywood pretty good track record enforcing mask policy, it‚Äôs definitely possible get full compliance. so? crack history book. essentially broken segments crisis. Nah, anti-WHO trump mentioned anything it, made happy talk tho.

French every month. general strike streets filled burning cars. Governor Abbott Texas thinks fantastic job throughout lol Americans intellectually lazy selfish can‚Äôt wear mask deal something tough months? Dear lord Imagine many people ACTUALLY TX, many young people (who told mild symptoms) sick enough present hospital.

Regardless whether testing ""Enough"", % positive results however many tests happening shocking TX, allows estimate case count people want cannot get test. 

if 20% people 50 need hospitalization, assume seeing 20% true infected count look hospital numbers. number much lower younger age group - hospitalization count younger people may represent 5 10% true case count. 

yeesh. long time felt like bad joke.

I born 1988. always ""save cheetahs"" style nature kid. 2006 took first environmental science class high school, feeling climate change discussion was: ""this future problem need address, things it"". 2007, took college course global warming, feeling *that* course was: ""actually, really know *what* do, almost time"". made mistake majoring earth science... took multiple courses history life Earth, necessarily addressed mass extinctions paleoclimatology. Wrote comprehensive papers causes various mass extinctions. Took multiple courses Earth system science... learned historical climate shifts causes, feedback loops carbon budgets. Et cetera. Learned climate change problem known century, ""deadline"" maintaining world like one grew actually decade even born. Imagine! Learning crisis overshadowed half life actually futile since parents high school. humanity ignoring hundred years! great-grandparents', grandparents', parents' generations ignored problem insurmountable. ""wasn't problem"", mine. late.

I graduated 2011 significantly nihilistic mindset, still *bit* hope. watched made progress whatsoever addressing climate change following 9 years. I'm watching country happily trade lives people money, pride, instant gratification. point just... lol. Okay. we're this, guess! Whatever!

Starting think psyche broken, little bit. current state things, guess got it. exactly reading it. Great way collateralize student loans... healthcare executives appreciate contributions bank account. Plus immunity short-lived, previous 20% get infected again. Rhode Island attempted New Yorkers. happen. problem enforcement. fourth amendment prevents it. anti-vax way shape form, however anti non-properly tested vax. mine everything keep getting we'll give vax time get it. reason (or science) expect this. Herd immunity really apply novel virus pandemics thresh hold much higher 20% Wanna bet boomers much disdain millennials... yet never live parents... actual fuck no. it. cave libs sjws. keep beaches open. let bathe viral load think see many locals driving shut area beaches. A) take virus pretty seriously B) go beach time.

I think see lots tourists reasons swarming infected area driving place though. ""Why anybody listen me?"" asks guy repeatedly lied American people thus squandering credibility. That's point.  I'm certainly endorsing large public gathering, wearing mask, etc.  I'm also ready give Cuomo medal, policies basically set long term care facilities state fire. Thousands drug doesn‚Äôt cure, make feel better. 

I guess shorter hospital stay America worth price drug financially. Another reason people may want get tested. get seeds from, curiosity? Maybe, yknow, put bit planning thought get small recirculated air bunch people order cut corners?

But life, risk take, matter miniscule chance. going socially isolate reach treasured mom seen 3 years? I'm going guess not.

At least respect her, plan road trip, isolate along way, much safer *her* around reach her. hell. isolating. help don‚Äôt understand subject. classes (even subjects interesting) boring. get experience learning classroom. 

Also, super easy cheat. one getting actual education online learning. things changed drastically last 15 years, major drug companies small R&amp;D budgets compared marketing. Almost basic science testing done public institutions, universities, research institutions, public hospitals. Big pharmas business model repurposing older drugs maintain patent rights drugs (Prozac repurposed med severe PMS) buying small pharmaceutical biotech companies. no, larger pharmaceutical companies create more.

But remains startlingly partisan issue US:

Only 2 üü•üêò governors issued mask requirements states:

* Larry Hogan Maryland

* Charlie Baker Massachusetts

On hand, Kansas' Laura Kelly board, 5 üü¶üê¥ governors left issued mask requirement general public state yet:

* Jared Polis Colorado

* John Bel Edwards Louisiana

* Steve Bullock Montana

* Kate Brown Oregon*

* Tony Evers Wisconsin

^*Governor ^Brown ^has ^required ^masks ^in ^several, ^but ^not ^all ^counties ^of ^the ^state.

Pretty sure mass gatherings advisable, also pretty sure protestors age 5.

I‚Äôm absolving decided go bars responsibility pertains Covid.

I also absolving protestors responsibility pertains Covid. 

You picking choosing reasons ignoring guidelines ok. I‚Äôm not.

And cities mentioned haven‚Äôt recent surge cases, already severe outbreaks (#1 NY, #5 DC, #9 IL) terms cases deaths per million. Even Minnesota deaths per million CA, AZ, FL, TX.

So surge cases among vulnerable population surprise. they're using Phase 3 testing using military real Phase 2 testing already covered young healthy people. much blatant disinformation going on. media truly enemy people one. got conservative media telling everybody masks wimps freedom haters, got liberal media telling people immune outside protesting. virus meanwhile wreaking havoc everywhere without prejudice. worst case scenario, beginning.  specific evidence suggest wearing masks mass population potential benefit. fact, there's evidence suggest opposite misuse wearing mask properly fitting properly

Here contention:

/r/Coronavirus developed unhealthy obsession Trump single point failure response pandemic.

I suspect much due election year shilling &amp; tribalism digress...

Trump one jackass, many Congress state governments also responsible current quagmire.

IF SUBREDDIT SERIOUS POLICY they/we would utilize collective influence Reddit lobby Congress, Presidential Candidates yes, even Trump, draft, support enact legislation would call six week two month lockdown, massive benefits Americans relieve financial burden incurred lockdown rigorous contact tracing, testing &amp; enforcement ensure one actually works...

...ALL YEAR'S END.

This would require something I'm sure average Redditor capable anymore... Working political opposition knowing names of/contacting/holding responsible respective Congressmen. know? keep making assertions Internet forum sources. Cursory google search suggests 64 top 100 pharmaceutical companies spent twice much marketing sales R&amp;D. know you‚Äôre trying sound like adult room you‚Äôre offering unpopular opinion evidence. Florida video came something special. Found albertan! Fuck UCP wear mask beach LA mostly reopened though. would suggest convincing Americans wearing mask health safety issue political issue? even possible point time? ‚ÄúNow fellas concerned beaches whatever make safe. beaches open weekend!‚Äù - idiot politician Reducing spread useless cure. 

it not. cure, better treatment... example, seems like hooking people ventilators way early, happening more. also seem combination meds that, least, reduce lengths hospital stays. Every little bit help. mean, ask yourself, would rather get bad case covid right 3 months continued research? Yes, sign 3 months now. 

But point needs balance, agree... balance also incredibly difficult find. However, wearing damn mask keeping distance outdoors hard comprehend... respect others. choose go party indoors, that's extra reason wear mask grocery shopping on... government isn‚Äôt MIA, either FLA TB!

I‚Äôve posts removed (falsely) saying ‚Äúthat content posted already‚Äù (at time not). seeing information 20x freaking row? think understanding backwards. take considerably longer report deaths cases. deaths added total weekend lull people died weekend, deaths hospitals officially report state's DOH weekend. look bit more. ""recent reports"" based tests significant false positives, possibly contaminated samples. early phylogenesis phylogeography based RNA sequencing analysis, highly reliable. definitely started Wuhan, probably market possibly lab, definitely man-made (i.e. almost certainly recombination 2 viruses cell non-human species). forgot /s nothing like seeing old people throwing caution wind... first one admittedly generic trying give idea (and one sentence)

The second even say anything shipping **that comment pointing wanting buy seedlings store make much sense right - germinate plant seed, so, unable probably plant outside** think guys expert /u/tenaku?

He gave pretty compelling argument During. 

Basically huge number people migrate villages cities search jobs. there's whole lot villages agriculture (which already employs nearly 50% workforce). menial skilled/unskilled labour cities , largely unorganised sector means job security social security either. people live hand mouth existence. daily labour , earn daily wages (they also called daily wagers) , buy food eat. 

So gem Prime Minister modi announced first lockdown notice 4 hours every one stuck wherever were. first lockdown 21 days, people earned zero 21 days ate whatever meagre savings had. 

But lockdown extended, people literally money buy food. Another pertinent thing mention people migrate backwards state even cities jobs do. every state government provides sort food security people, administration done state government. since people home state provided food grains subsidised price. people option make way native villages still family ensure atleast eat. 

But lockdown meant transport service. People walked. Walked hundreds kilometres. Hundreds perished way. biggest mass exodus since partition happened. poor illusion lives mattered government ordeal shaken core. know government care whether live die, people say wanna return uncaring world would rather live villages try find another means earning living.

Unfortunately see case, agriculture already many people. lessen pie. semblance normal(whatever means now) people flocking back realize there's nothing earn villages.  It‚Äôs price America pays underfunding education three decades. Adam Savage Mythbusters smart. Yeah mean else get fuck sister cares? Europe barely manage themselves. Call end QE...buncha smug idiots Houston problem selfish people packing planes middle pandemic. never heard automobile? Zoom? guess I'm meaning say really think demographic changed? think first month two NY's deal less healthy young ppl visiting bars/theaters etc problem spots now? advanced enough testing tracing really protect older generation better something spreads ease? catching missed then, going end 5%+ fatality rate? trust started collapsing approximately 4 years ago. Every one them? know? experience seed ordering was: Ordered 12 packets various seeds Reiner March 3rd, received em May 27th. Ordered five packets seeds Jung March 3rd well, received em May 15th.  ended grabbing seeds HOME depot (only garden facility ten mile area). 5 months... that's left dumb leader. 4 years competent leader comes around. Ah yes, resorting spellcheck. another way saying lost argument need direct energy something actually make difference, hopefully actually makes sense. 

Your argument like saying medical journals written medical professionals You‚Äôre right, course, particularly onerous piece legislation crux issue. Bush‚Äôs dogshit treasury secretaries, terrible tax cuts led dependency foreign capital weakened economy, general inaction enabled spiral additional 8 years. no, nexus ‚Äî happened 7 years watch. Nice strawman there.

My critique people double rhetorical backflips claim protesters [in crowds thousands] contribute spike new cases we're experiencing folks advocating closing outdoor venues AGAIN.

Discussion policy must intellectually honest &amp; consistent degrades political propaganda.

I'm seeing uneasy transition subreddit month views deviate illogical consensus struck immediately.

I'm simply asking explanation certain venues &amp; activites get pass others don't.

I'm simply asking nuance rational discourse.

Is posible longer here? ability request accommodation disability ends accommodation puts people's health risk.

Wheelchair ramp get store? Legit accommodation. put anyone risk.

Asking gas station pump gas you, unable stand hold pump? Legit accommodation. 

Asking Netflix provide subtitles? Legit accommodation. 

Asking employer provide height-adjusted ergonomically correct desk? Legit accommodation. 

Asking employer ban latex balloons (and forms latex) building due severe latex allergy? Reasonable accommodation.

None things put anyone else risk, often benefit others. (Those wheelchair ramps, example, handy strollers.) 

An employee demanding another employee's insulin syringes (and epipen) banned building needle phobia, want needles gone accommodation ""disability"" -- fear needles? Using argument unable work know there's needle building? reasonable accommodation. that's oddly specific example, really happened place worked, lady needle phobia brought demand letter lawyer regarding this. 

That smacked HR. phobia, unfortunate though as, life threatening. without insulin epi potentially was.

Likewise, demanding allowed shop without mask global pandemic, expense safety others? Selfish, stupid, covered ADA. right put people's lives risk want wear mask. 

If they're physically unable wear mask, reasonable accommodation would curbside pickup, rather allowed shop without mask. (And business owner, exactly I'd tell them.) 

Obligatory not-a-lawyer disclaimer. Youre assuming people well informed. Many people wearing masks think protects them, aware actually mostly protecting others. Cabin air completely replaced outside air 10 12 times per hour. get place, it‚Äôs going AC system.  click then? article claims data suggests 20% infected Stockholm.
Wrong. data. latest antibodytest showed 10,2% antibodies Stockholm. people seeking healt care randomized sample.

The article also claims infections going Stockholm bu know nothing that. recently test capacity increased found cases Stockholm also increased seen short; draw conclusions based data Sweden. saying go, ""One death tragedy; million statistic"" something like that? demand disappears revenue dried up, something's gotta give. 
 
The Great Recession tanked us totally unpredictable unresolvable ways, equivalent Great Toilet Paper shortage. Absolutely.

People young low risk volunteer continue normal lives regardless infection everyone else chooses practice lockdown etc. way low risk people provide ‚Äúimmunity barrier‚Äù infected.

Thoughts? purposefully making irrelevant point, however. 

Social distancing nearly concern size population is. 

1) 6 feet made nonsense anyway. Prolonged contact enclosed environment cause infection distance helps. Nothing magical occurs 6 feet. 7 better 6 8 better 7. 

2) enclosed space prolonged period time fewer people better people. relevant point here. greater number passengers, likely one infected. 

Since airplanes shuffle populations around, incredible vectors disease spread. taken seriously beaches parks areas concern. Allowing populations larger true risk. individual reasonably believed virus. reasonable believe every individual virus. worry, covid wars honestly less problem climate change AI. probably two things could really ruin civilization I'm mildly optimistic us survive climate change lol. lock federally states locked way. put work 8 weeks. parents unemployed. Tell ""no lockdown"". ""criticism"" - outrage? war? tearing greedy company making profit peoples lives? 

No wonder America spends developed country worst healthcare said countries every margin possible. It‚Äôs fault. got politics idea could run state government like business, voters fell it.

You think kids risk Covid. I'm sure getting information. Kids died this. Mind you, many, have. kids asymptomatic mild symptoms, testing them, clue many children gotten it. 

In America, we've probably done protect children. Schools closed. Playgrounds closed. daycares summer camps closed. open them, looking happens spreads. even America 125,000 dead, still want protect kids.

I suspect one two things you: either kids sick tired house time. kids, understand caring kids getting it. kids, must care get sick see often uncontrollably touch surfaces, touch face,  scream yell excitement right front friends. know kids get sick time little self control poor hygiene. So, kids mind possibly getting Covid, must mind getting giving friends family even know it. happen. Even child comes getting Covid effects, get give others. high chance survival, friends family members? positive survive lung damage problems?

For someone claiming know little, claim know lot kids getting Covid risks families.

You got something cautious?

Our kids work staying home least damage economy.

Check state publishing daycare school outbreaks. Follow next month two tell us certainty kids getting Covid.

Kary Mullis invented Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. invention got Nobel prize chemistry 1993. Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year age 74, inventor regarded PCR innapropriate detect viral infection. reason intended use PCR was, still is, apply manufacturing technique, able replicate DNA sequences millions billions times, diagnostic tool detect viruses.

Moreover, worth mentioning **the PCR tests used identify COVID-19 patients presumably infected called SARS-CoV-2 valid gold standard compare with.**

**This fundamental point.** Tests need evaluated determine preciseness ‚Äî strictly speaking ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù ‚Äúspecificity‚Äù ‚Äî comparison ‚Äúgold standard,‚Äù meaning accurate method available.

As example, pregnancy test gold standard would pregnancy itself. Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, example, stated [ABC TV answer question ‚ÄúHow accurate \[COVID-19\] testing?‚Äù:

If new test picking \[the bacterium\] golden staph blood, we‚Äôve already got blood cultures, that‚Äôs gold standard we‚Äôve using decades, could match new test that. COVID-19 don‚Äôt gold standard test.‚Äù

Jessica C. Watson Bristol University confirms this. paper [‚ÄúInterpreting COVID-19 test published recently British Medical Journal, writes ‚Äúlack clear-cut ‚Äògold-standard‚Äô COVID-19 testing.‚Äù

But instead classifying tests unsuitable SARS-CoV-2 detection COVID-19 diagnosis, instead pointing virus, proven isolation purification, solid gold standard, Watson claims seriousness that, ‚Äúpragmatically‚Äù COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, ‚Äúmay best available ‚Äògold standard‚Äô.‚Äù scientifically sound.

***Apart fact downright absurd take PCR test part gold standard evaluate PCR test, distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19.***.

And distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis ‚Äî contrary Watson‚Äôs statement ‚Äî cannot suitable serving valid gold standard.

In addition, ‚Äúexperts‚Äù Watson overlook fact virus isolation, i.e. unequivocal virus proof, gold standard.

Now question is: required first virus isolation/proof? need know RNA PCR tests calibrated comes from.

**Particle purification** ‚Äî i.e. separation object everything else object, instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg radium chloride 1898 extracting tons pitchblende ‚Äî ***is essential pre-requisite proving existence virus, thus prove RNA particle question comes new virus.***

The reason PCR extremely sensitive, means detect even smallest pieces DNA RNA ‚Äî cannot determine particles came from. determined beforehand.

And PCR tests calibrated gene sequences (in case RNA sequences SARS-CoV-2 believed RNA virus), know gene snippets part looked-for virus. know that, correct isolation purification presumed virus executed.

The authors four principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery new coronavirus concede proof origin virus genome viral-like particles cellular debris, pure impure, particles kind. ***In words, existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA based faith, fact***.

This actually means one cannot conclude RNA gene sequences, scientists took tissue samples prepared mentioned vitro trials PCR tests finally ‚Äúcalibrated,‚Äù belong specific virus ‚Äî case SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, ***there scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19.***

In order establish causal connection, one way other, i.e. beyond virus isolation purification, would absolutely necessary carry experiment satisfies four Koch‚Äôs postulates. experiment.

In words, even theoretically assume PCR tests really detect viral infection, tests would practically worthless, would cause unfounded scare among ‚Äúpositive‚Äù people tested.

In [‚ÄúCDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic file March 30, 2020, example, says:

Detection viral RNA may indicate presence infectious virus 2019-nCoV causative agent clinical symptoms‚Äù

And the[ FDA admits results \[‚Ä¶\] rule bacterial infection co-infection viruses. agent detected may definite cause disease.‚Äù*** Im sure would consider rendered ""useless"" would view smart move countries briefly suspend travel.

Also, people pursue medicine enjoy it. everything money. It‚Äôs rewarding career immense job security fulfilling work. across street sisters apartment, people lined shoulder shoulder block get day opened. opened 8 days many cases they‚Äôve recorded FAR, they‚Äôre asking everyone get tested. 

Harpers East Lansing btw, people def MSU students yes, telling that. figured China would first vaccine, since ethical constraints countries. thing would sum month Karen complaining black person delivering package wear mask beach closed, followed police respond beating black dude charges including ""resisting arrest..."" that's it. OP, probably cringing saying felt safe wearing mask even though nobody else was. Masks protect others, yourself. influencer protecting gym goers still putting risk. agree though it‚Äôs good could influencing followers wear masks. can‚Äôt else people see mask turn orange. Racists racist even hate black man trying keep alive... many young ppl know going nursing homes right now? Last time checked putting thousands COVID19 patients nursing homes either.

That's true. outliers CDC says week. It'll different areas, different companies/landlords. Even 2 million refuse leave, still leaves 8 million. 

Also areas send cops evict gunpoint refuse leave? Hard refuse point.  joke?

There currently 300K confirmed cases almost 1K new cases every day.

Screenshot article heres second confirming get mass produced know someone ... matter say ... say opposite.

You see actually thinking said .. trying come something counter opinion and/or statement.

Her opinion opposite .. matter subject.

There many people like her. make good point. I‚Äôm sick line ups, masks sanitizing hands etc. family greater good vigilant.

Advice self-isolate results (in Australia anyway!) Nothing open year two, joke..

You must understand production economies work. Everything else open eventually ensure people dont fall cracks.


Countries far better safety nets (Europe + Canada) far open say impossible keep up. states reigning situation control (1-4% test positivity). USA get eventually, likely within 3 months.

Your economic situation must real comfy think tenable 1-2 years.

Yeah, cause definitely follows law would absolutely sign bill /s Treatment gotten 4 times effective since situation spring, medical professionals gotten much better managing clotting inflammation, also average patient less vital load compared earlier year. Plus mom female (I presume) odds *significantly* better average age group. Hang keep support person talk sake mental health. Oh come Texas already bad enough month without showing up, Nobody deserves that. deeply tired Trump, egomania, incompetence. I‚Äôm counting days finally disappear. :( Brazil‚Äôs Sao Paulo state expects week receive federal regulatory approval start trials potential coronavirus vaccine developed China‚Äôs Sinovac, Governor Joao Doria said Monday.
The trial would carried Instituto Butantan, research center funded state Sao Paulo. Doria said news conference 9,000 volunteers already registered test vaccine, known CoronaVac.
The announcement comes Brazil‚Äôs federal government announced weekend signed agreement produce another potential vaccine, developed pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca researchers Oxford University.
Michael Ryan, executive director World Health Organization, said Monday Brazil still faces ‚Äúbig challenge‚Äù curb pandemic integrate efforts different levels government.
‚ÄúWe would encourage Brazil continues fight disease, Brazil links efforts federal state level much systematic way, focus comprehensive approach controlling disease sustained fashion.‚Äù
Doria said Sao Paulo trying compete federal government testing Chinese vaccine.
‚ÄúThe tested approved vaccines have, better,‚Äù said. Yeah, knows. I‚Äôm still work, stay home except groceries gym. need physical fitness least. let Tell it. I'd happy handful hours week cover hobby costs one wants hire medically limited 'unskilled' person. world tailored shit anyone less fortunate times throw pandemic mix.... :(  forgot part also can't afford health insurance even without home kids. [daily declining muh mask mandated (17/04). fact decline ratio seems slowed... certainly imply contrary, decline deaccelerating point peak natural tendency epidemic. Yeah anyway deep mindset issue pushes people vote interest nation anyway.

When credit cards finally getting outlawed US ? They're de facto country (France). education finally subsidized ? ever going make sense employees pay right skilled slaves ... healthcare getting shared ? gonna drive profit cure grandma's cancer help daughter focus raising kids rather spending grandma...

I understand debates US gun rights, abortion, gays, trans toilets shit. surreal. Lol keep deleting comments?!!! affect leave yet internal issues prevent facing anyone disagrees you. guess voted :) Forebearance kicks road. still need pay end getting income, supposed pay it? service provided without compensation? Could imagine would happen factory told employees keep working pay going delayed 12 months? empty factory.

EIDL advance? mean one get $1000/employee? 8 employees 2 apartment complexes here. long think would last us?

(Give hint, mortgages two complexes run 90k/month both.)

Plus get PPP, can't even get EIDL money without pay back. Forcing companies take loans pay tenants even paying?

Back factory example...what would happen factory management told employees pay would delayed 12 months...but problem, go get loan bank cover expenses meanwhile? No, filling public places. daft? many Karen‚Äôs need haircut right now? They‚Äôre trying push blame onto younger people ENTIRE RESPONSE FAILURE TOP LEVEL GOVERNMENT WAY DOWN. Deflecting blame isn‚Äôt going work here. Clubs bars even open begin with. earned it. patient follow standards states developed.

Instead chose ""freedom"" way virus they've fucked beyond repair. here, started sending lot people home people testing positive sent people (unfortunately me) home recently August. Please link sources shows plenty cases re-infection. I'm chemist, drug extremely difficult costly make.  

Honestly $3k much hard make. Problem hospitals insurance companies play games. Hospitals bill everything, insurance companies try cover little possible. still talking completely different part Florida. big state, there's statewide enforcement. Like original commenter said, people areas closed bars flock parts state case. still result another surge cases DeSantis refuses anything state wide. something something fictoria p ""Cases dropped significantly record high Tuesday!"" -Wednesday morning reports, probably think lot comes financial literacy. barriers entry stock market investments general never lower. Acorn, Robinhood, many brokers/financial institutions offer solutions little invest. Start pocket change build up. solution vast gap ownership? No. think it‚Äôs start way start bettering situation. budgeting tools help people recognize much spend. work financial world can‚Äôt tell many times people idea much they‚Äôre bringing much they‚Äôre spending. solve problems? No. it‚Äôs start people better situation. 

I think many examples like there. help everyone? No. could vastly improve lives millions. solutions need come along form policy changes, improvements education system, better, effective safety nets. Ultimately, though, think two sides solution‚Äîpersonal responsibility form self education/seeking education top policy change. Owning home true luxury days lol apartment complex filled families really vaccine adverse reactions China easily replace people massive population pool

I think meant write ""US"" instead ""China"" someone else said, disclaimer website states Fox News ‚Äúfor entertainment purposes only‚Äù legally say it‚Äôs fault people take seriously.

This literal fake news. 

The origin claim April Fools Day joke years ago.

I fan Fox News right-wing bullshit, always shocked galaxy brains fall fake news try dunk Fox News. yet we've gone 0.67 Rt April 19th steadily rising back 1.00 now... bad. nobody seems talking this. stop celebrating. wear mask. taking cruise low risk Yes can‚Äôt . Young don‚Äôt get sick. 
Deaths decreasing. fear porn msm. 
We need herd immunity gained trough young healthy. proven work aim anyway. 

At end like flu.../s Yeah, that's kicker me. parents live tiny midwest town, there's way could live town actually career field.

If lived in/near major city I'd absolutely live since know sometimes struggle bills. It'd help us out. high school Zoom spring. useless.  fall going hopefully better. probably warn vegetarians can't ever get protein plants, seems important.

The US social safety net trash, plenty people fall cracks.

A garden need provide 100% food family, covers even 20% that's huge savings. There's also ton potential health benefits eating produce actually grown ripeness, avoid using herbicides/pesticides worries consuming that.  there‚Äôs rumors workplace 2 positive cases, still haven‚Äôt said anything we‚Äôre working normal. anything it? Nah. Deaths trending downward. We‚Äôd start see uptick now. agree - many parents happy pawn raising education children people. 

I honestly laughing ‚ÄúOMG I‚Äôm miserable kids home‚Äù messages went around beginning pandemic. parenting kids awful complain non-stop, odds really good completely shit job before. seasonal we're seeing reduced transmission.

Every respiratory pandemic modern era large spike first winter appearance. expect different. 9k 5k 2 days, tis miracle tell ye partially outcome perpetual fear-based cycle for-profit news bathing us decades. Literally everything end world panic. last two three novel viruses news (Swine flu, bird flu, SARS-1) treated exact ""we're gonna die"" fervor, ultimately nothing substantial came them, controlled contained part, people's current default reaction treat COVID-19 like another one those. 

I believe media held accountable way. saying protests super spreaders, last checked country music written constitution civil rights problem.

I realize virus respected constitution civil rights.  That's promising guess. family got mocked, decided go lockdown farm (we're 250km north Kiruna Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish boarder) back March.
As S√°mi, we're allowed herd even across boarders, we're loosing income, Swedish government stupid (again). 
But least proudly say, within family nobody got sick self inflicted lockdown. Sometimes pays listen government stubborn argue dad left? need look county. believe wife oldest daughter weeks ago know post old COVID time, funny posts age. 2 weeks ago, Polis getting praised Vox Politico methodical approach virus (seemingly) working. Now, starting spike. biggest spike world, still could alarming flatten again. takes seven business day‚Äôs get results live (Texas). It‚Äôs joke. Still don‚Äôt understand keep beaches open everyday (besides 4th July weekend) beaches aren‚Äôt nice tbh. hate state much right now. one said vaccine ""a tested proven treatment"".

What mean this? never sign military folks. bidding overlords, way test rat. wasn‚Äôt long ago justified reopening quickly affected older people. He‚Äôs different hero, Mr. research important voice authority figures (both official state representatives media) consistency messaging stopping spread disinformation? 

A lot people seem think biggest difference US Asian countries stark cultural individualism v collective social conscious. However, also would wager many authoritative figures doubting efficacy mask making political issue (since mask wearing already accepted Asian nations argument whenever masks really introduced, maybe even 1918 flu?) 

I think especially important since David's research shows simply showing someone intelligence grasp arguments misinformation believe mean convinced linking correct information. Unfortunately, seems like lot beliefs trickle whatever consider legitimate. Would unified message beginning really prevented lot misinformation (for instance mask debacle probably opened big window skepticism) It'd incredibly hard maintain figures much China claiming without every city turn hotspot, clusters country. Well blame governors failure take action. local municipalities trying best keep people safe completely wrong. provisional death counts CDC provides shows us 80% deaths USA still 60. agree seem many young deaths countries misinformation. I‚Äôm US unfortunately, handling infection well. good news live NJ moderately control late, people already traveled That's me, especially since rural area even get basic dial internet like 2004. ""Patients swabbed April also severe symptoms likely need hospitalisation intensive care, found.""

Isn't simplest explanation testing severe cases April widespread testing picking milder cases? lol rhetoric plain wrong tell high school You‚Äôre actually better age. Read like five years you‚Äôll like ‚Äúoh‚Äù. Going back reading old live journal entries.... ooof could someone explain good thing, something alert over? I'm trying help people understand basic math, know schools closed now. depends whether rate infection outpacing rate testing. got breastfeeding counseling latching painful told covered 100% deductible ACA.

It was... wife. got charged $500 sons portion ""here, squeeze boob like see helps"" logical invent lot methods, mentioned anywhere. imagination.

It's *simplified description* *layman's article*... departments...

Dust bunnies? like Dust storms Agreed. They've decided stick entire bill government's failures handling situation onto landlords.

That fair would cause heap load trouble.

Are going delete post wrong? think 401 (k) retire to. guys need reading state US economy.. pensions forms savings fix debt one way another..

Either remove use funds pay debt hope mass deaths among US population pensioners. ban greatest country nation?!! üò°üò°üò°üò° plenty cases reinfection. I'm trying say is, immunity, strong fades while. like temporary resistance rather actual immunity.

The science still clear, definitely catch several times. feel like chain linked gardening sub lol. people claiming literally essential survival able go Pike's HD gardening section conveniently ignoring fact sources (you ever seen large scale farming operation getting thousands thousands seeds plants HD? Ahaha) Florida reports 11am day People fight closure still show mean less deaths/more cases thing also easily explained fact deaths lag new infections. two three weeks back cases down, deaths today. cases exploding.

We're going stuck sad lonely bubble long time world continues around us think?  Good job florida. problem spring online classes. teachers threw homework students without teaching.  district promises actual online classes fall.  I'm willing give chance.  I'm willing expose kid COVID classroom though. team learned months since then, numbers grown exponentially. changed stance (and pretty quickly said this), know point bringing up. **the test explainer logged in** pee water argued court law entertainment news. 

No didn't. 

There multiple variations claim there, third party fact checkers also argued responsible viewers actions.

No news outlet responsible actions audience. good thing. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ironically, Rachel Maddow recently lawsuit filed OAN attorney successfully argued show mix opinions ""exaggeration facts"". read article first shared it. Sounds like trying assuage concerns police surveillance people attended protests. way language presented article, likely point contact tracing process folks tell contact tracers ""any additional information"" last weeks, people attended protests offer information. 

I necessarily think smartest move, terms able gather much information virus spread. heard happening cities, however, may still able gather enough information, grand scheme things. all, article quotes de Blasio's spokesperson saying, ""Naturally, able obtain information positive cases, engagement among reached high."" Sounds like many people offering protest-related information regardless.

There several states gathering disseminating possible data virus, frustrating data analysis efforts. example, Florida outright refuses disseminate daily Covid hospitalization numbers ICU data. 3 states provide data. impossible determine accurate national totals current Covid hospitalizations, ICU admissions, ventilator usage. return stuff go get right stuff yourself, defeats purpose. guess hedge. get right, awesome mess up, screwed regardless. did. Reddit always side whatever US does. Never luck Lowe's pickup. Even simplest things, like dimmer switch, would get completely wrong. trying exchange store working morons, returns desk scanned order wrong item like 6 times. Hey dingus going work gave wrong item appear anywhere order. Basically deadlier ""strains"" (for sake brevity) die hosts ""cured"" (""sick"" people likely receive medical care) milder, infectious strains survive.

That‚Äôs said. It‚Äôs nonsense can't argue ""serious"" strains spread much ""milder"" ones, also arguing don't.

üßê pools safer, chlorine? easier enforce we're lockdown. workers peoplesworld.org says judge reporting based source rather merits. crazy amount big pharma hospitals charging keep lot people getting tested, probably getting vaccinated too.  Yes. make harder easier engineer vaccine treatment it? I‚Äôm amazed half US households stock... clearly missed point Well, we‚Äôre going March comments bodies piling streets running food, definitely wasn‚Äôt bad thought. never vaccine line coronavirus though, including SARS1.0. Y‚Äôall ready next years!!?!?

Open-Close-Open-Close-Open-Close-Open-Close... depends income. household income $50,000~, that‚Äôs killer. Like whackamole, exponential growth. mean American travelers already stuck EU? 

Im us backpacker whos stuck albania 5 months. left america 7 months ago. going head greece july 1st. denied? Even tho ive us way covid? thinking south like Collier County (Naples, etc.).  parts west coast own, too. 

Tampa older population... FL last days 70,000+ today weekend lag 40,000+ Yes, people, people don‚Äôt wanna wear mask even could save life different person.

I fascinated understand thought post accomplishing...

/In deleted, course mean idiots said blood fucking whatever man meat myth sky would absolve whatever fucking sins people told guilty first place name give money? going end well. Theyve open since May 11th:  Positivity declined along increased testing plateau positive cases. decrease positivity increased testing means true number infections population decreasing well. 

So even though detected cases remained stationary. True number people infected could going down. would explain decrease deaths. way prevent spread Misinformation/FakeNews without restricting free speach? sorry bad english. virus passes GI tract, strips away lipid layer holding spikes that's left RNA. Essentially deactivated virus. bigger concern would someone coughing washroom use there's still virus lingering air middle worsening pandemic resulting world-wide depression, become clearer, clearer small manipulations fruitless. 
What take realize needed economic reset reconfiguration?

There no, cannot be, ""going back way things were."" Easily, don‚Äôt know, ‚ÄúI told so‚Äùers really relax. Nobody knows sure happening right now. Ok typical ‚Äúholier thou‚Äù comment see society shouldn‚Äôt like bunch crabs bucket.

European society much also like bunch crabs bucket. Maybe accessing healthcare, manifests ways Reddit conveniently ignore doesn‚Äôt fit You‚Äôre thread talking fantastic health insurance that‚Äôs good you.

I‚Äôm ‚Äúall thread‚Äù willingly. simply mentioned get better cheaper healthcare 99% Europeans triggered Redditors enough respond nonstop. fellow countrymen can‚Äôt afford healthcare skip doctor visits?

There‚Äôs faux European morality high ground. I‚Äôve 20 European countries saw poor people almost them. fellow countrymen pay taxes still can‚Äôt afford place live? don‚Äôt food eat? matter you? I‚Äôd personally feel ripped paying much taxes social welfare still saw people streets everywhere...

Redditors honestly believe Americans absolutely 0 options get health care doesn‚Äôt come government private company. height ignorance. hundreds welfare groups operating US myriad ways people get help. Whether health care bankruptcy. Here‚Äôs ONE example [cheap/free health clinics mention, sizable portion population CHOOSE health insurance. can‚Äôt afford it, don‚Äôt want (for various personal reasons). 

But points challenge Reddit‚Äôs myopic worldview would never accept reality. It‚Äôs much easier keep hating America feeling superior comments.

FWIW Memphis' (Shelby County) latest case/death chart running here's stats Tennessee whole, plus ranking states terms per capita deaths:

 Oh thanks giving permission, appreciate it. NYC another lockdown takeout. hard understand? Indoor dining proven transmission. Can‚Äôt make money sick clientele problem attempt keep case count low destroying businesses. maybe think that's fine, places employ people pay taxes fund benefits people can't work moment. poorly...what said exactly right. COVID lead gruesome deaths, *visually dramatic* characteristics. things mentioned help people see immediately something very, wrong. 

When people see someone COVID, dramatic visuals difficult people understand severe virus be. 

Like, stuff describing would immediately called mind comparisons Black Plague, something people might identified much strongly. demand disappears revenue dried up, something's gotta give. 
  
Investors putting money stocks try save disappearing value dollar. Sure, means demand stocks. since tied _fundamentals_, since demand dropped record levels, something got give. Good point! Really, public health standpoint imo whole reopening Europe summer holiday thing seems like huge risk. 

What take it? think probably serious negative consequences? mild ones or...? know people power going say ‚ÄúFuck it.‚Äù bureaucracy nothing science, plenty persuading people listen science. people reason always ignore fact MITIGATION inserted scenario early on. saw Diamond Princess example. moment Japan caught wind situation, immediately went work mitigate much risk possible. Measures taken ensure already compromised situation could kept control. simply forget important detail push soke rhetoric virus ""burning out"" somehow changing 20% infection reached absolute nonsense. proven observed fact lockdowns mitigation efforts de facto single biggest stopping block virus (NZ, NY etc). add stopping block, equation changing massively. remove it, things normalise again. Well, good luck. heard nothing good it. flopped. States rights, zero top leadership, etc Theres still articles released one day ago texas florida hospital icu filled closed capacity. making shit up. Guideline whom? feel government responsible putting clear guideline. center disease control silent. administration gutted organization. People heard government inject disinfectant would recommend following advice. significantly higher percentage suffer permanent (expensive) damage virus even die, something people seem want gloss over. like 3-5 years ever. Could please stop pretending harder measures countries ever meant place long. 

The restrictions Nordic countries supposed sustainable. supposed beat virus quickly possible. worked exactly planned. stark contrast genius plan Folkh√§lsomyndigheten - ensuring we‚Äôll spend summer highest risk Europe. Way go Florida, damn selves. üëèüèº Glad know that. hope keeps getting better greeting Singapore üôÇ Alright. Carry on. gonna get thru ya. see you! know. curious virus successful invading host cells, increasing reproductive rate, would increase internal viral load leading severe symptoms quickly... question/theory though... Um, it‚Äôs posted chart article, it‚Äôs thumbnail thread.

Deaths trended downward roughly 40 per day 30ish last 2 months.

I saying deaths won‚Äôt increase coming weeks, certainly won‚Äôt increase corresponding way cases. 

Any daily count cases always incomplete, it‚Äôs fraction real case count. don‚Äôt know truly deadly virus yet. nearly deadly thought beginning seemingly much contagious. Lockdown works least 80% population board. Florida it‚Äôs probably 60% most, lockdowns get cases lower slightly likely get back matter long wide state stay home order imposed. death rates coming people even less likely abide another lockdown. stay home order extremely risky nightmare scenario would locking delay another big surge. pass mandatory mask order would great, I‚Äôd rather keep current practice place keep bars shut down. revenue go sucks base system culture FL, really nothing much do.  I'd like introduce Science
 üá∫üá∏ need you.
Another stable genius. worry, Swedes good explanation everything: 

* special
* things different Sweden
* trust government government trusts us
* mostly elderly homes - makes ok
* everyone else second wave somehow catch thousands thousands extra deaths, see
* everyone hates us, see amazing reasoning STAY FUCK HOME FUCKING TWATS. people fighting lives dignity. can't really stop spontaneous anger driving people onto streets. stop unnecessary planned convention.

Also, there's evidence protests anything terms spreading virus. Part problem items available curbside pickup. tried use lumber store item only. So, time go store. bother getting everything cart online find go store anyways? Gotta dance one brung ya Another US mayor, cruisin' disaster.

It weird relaxed creating epidemic city.

Would reelect gone completely drain? American voters forgiving reelect guy created mayhem? I've ordered dozen times local stores, exactly perfect every time. equally careful single occurances Reminder Gilead effectively cured Hep C HIV contraction, big pharma bad. grateful live Canada, need health care system overhaul States. know SARS-CoV-2 existed 1700, source that? going pretend landlords super wealthy cover this? Seems like government needs cover landlords. Canada got treatment strep cost time. miss worrying sort thing (live US now). Certain p l c l key words get auto censored. different parties, systems, good stuff. Neither. information virus works. 

But pedantic: knowledge always good. Doubt. legitimate concern beach communities west coast right now‚Äîthat people make little daycation east coast holiday. tried Hamilton epic flop.

What? even released yet, I'm expecting Disney+ servers regress back launch day levels buffering traffic. forget can't finish infrastructure already paid please send dollars. Second that! It‚Äôs requirements make patients hospital go through. Unless hospital requirements entry. Again, read whole article anyone know applies private beaches? Hi u/xoxomy \- Tommy here. Thanks question! way I'm keeping date question [New York Times Vaccine They're updating every day, get sense they're at. There's lot them, process complicated, overview quite useful! US trouble concept masks. let sink imagine would happen vaccinations made mandatory. Arizona Florida Texas fucked New York way densely populated need look wrong. tourism great locked reopened. Quite understandable people travel lot less pandemic. even matter daily new cases daily deaths. damn pandemic.  came say people need criminally prosecuted this, highest levels. transfers even happening pandemic? Insane!! frankly insane even worry shit good year, say nothing year US ravaged novel virus. observations medical student Texas.

Our hospital drive thru covid testing center. 3 weeks ago rarely saw cars. Last week, day came 645 am, line already starting. heard line last week got long mile. hospital security directing traffic setup handle lines. 

A fellow student got spit wearing mask. heard her. ancestry Indian wonder much played it. also heard another student, friend, knife pulled children wearing masks. ancestry East Asia told, yelled racial slurs him. 

Just little experience crazy time. Stay safe there! I‚Äôm U.K. predicted million dead, took steps prevent 40k dead. 

I see good result, think it‚Äôs bad? accused ""looking reasons fail"" simply pointing massive logistical problems producing vaccine get distributed billions people. Could made point. Par course Reddit though course. Damn that's true that's pretty massive drop last weeks cases literally lose money ""Al fresco"" mention restaurants can't set outside. Public opinion dumb low deaths hospitalizations. Philly shouldn‚Äôt need another lockdown postpone indoor restaurants/bars roll back indoor services like religious gatherings. Keep things outdoors open see do. Evidence suggests would alright people wearing masks considerate manner.  Basically, learning make virus parts effect behaviors. 

This research change lay person's understanding virus, interesting studying make-up. conclusions draw regarding vaccines severity. Here's NY's latest case/death chart. Unlike south, they've done incredible job:

 They‚Äôre uptick like US. way justify reopening anything. 

[NYT Kentucky - scroll yet... still anxiety go out/feel anything ‚Äúunusual.‚Äù often civic leaders fall victim misinformation responsible stopping it? I‚Äôve noticing Dunning-Krueger effect getting referenced frequently lately regard mistrust scientific expertise circles. promising research methods successfully combatting kinds deeply entrenched views beliefs associated science denialism among exhibit cognitive biases? government step pay rent then? that? ‚Äúclose‚Äù close?

Because say ‚Äúbeach closed‚Äù want, unless enforce it, doesn‚Äôt mean shit Obviously haven‚Äôt invested stock market So, wait couple days another outbreak KY reported. like that's recurring trend states choosing reopen. India #117 cases per capita Brazil #19. Undoubtedly India severely undercounting rural slum areas, Brazil. IDK anyone saying virus horrifying. They're saying visually dramatic way sears mind. people dropping streets pus blood pouring discolored skin, get people's attention. That's undeniably horrific. 

People coughing fainting street? Less impactful. Yes, videos people dying around world gasp air fucking awful seared brain forever. people watching videos - they're paying attention personally see. see individuals seem mildly ill (in public). 

If there's one truth mainstream media, shock value propels content much farther anything else. *visually* gruesome death would get attention, would covered extensively, would caught lot attention.

It's COVID awful. dying gasping air choking fluids horrific. visual impact people watching listening videos sick dying. They're seeing images sick people look mostly ""normal"". means live nice part Florida. everybody state gets great weather, let alone even smallest glimpses beach. true. propaganda anti ~~EU~~ Sweden  Yes, drug companies don‚Äôt really fund achieve innovation. spend less 5% budget R&amp;D, try make sound like won‚Äôt stay afloat can‚Äôt overcharge medication. reality, pharmaceutical companies highest profit margins private industry- many companies see 20%. point know payments individuals going approved senate...ever.

Not either. Paul Gosar, U.S. Representative AZ's 4th District. Pence viable candidate though, can't run President, zero charisma pull. He's stuck now, gotta back Trump till end. going convince enough people take vaccine, one becomes available? I‚Äôm confused many Americans simply refuse it, leaving us vulnerable. Blame China? ""LabCorp bill cost COVID-19 IgG antibody test directly insurance carrier, uninsured, appropriate government program. cost test based rates established Centers Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS).""

that's addition ten bucks taken shot antibody test worthless. Neither. mutations effect efficacy current vaccines development. sure needling often need supplies replace tools due wear tear use year long. Limited funds always kept short supply tool backups.

LA Times - article regarding research conducted Kim Prather, Lead Atmospheric Chemist Scripps Institute Oceanography

She believes beach perfect place Covid 19 spread. again, Redditors arguing keep beaches open also degreed scientists experts field (/s). Death Expertise Tom Nichols explains alot amateur ""expert"" phenomena. negotiate medical bills?  mean ""stupid stupid does""? No, clearly denial. biased interpretation. players union.  probably shouldn‚Äôt college hate coursework much, person online. could seen coming Every single person talked Covid-19 vaccine within past month -- many people, maybe 20, still -- stated take vaccine, Guinea pigs, wait others take first see happens.

If everyone thought like that... yikes chance widespread immunity.  people act like literal fucking children. Lobbying legalized bribery someone answer qiestion? unmasked person tries come face face First put hands blocking motion, say, ""Don't come closer, bro."" three times, legal use physical force (like shoving backwards) refuse comply continue advance towards you? People come world.

That‚Äôs also factor. Don‚Äôt want attract unnecessary travel. thinking thing! Open bars! naive thing i've read day. really thought govt, especially administration concerned you? Pay taxes keep moving. remember Katrina Flint, magnificent responses ""competent admins"". think talking 2 different things... government ppe hoards (which problematic different reasons) people donating cloth masks (not ppe, protect environment wearer instead wearer environment.) lot lack leadership top. party control profits people lot base believes anything tell them

Secondly America first individualistic nation unfortunately kind wild lay like this. world shutting around still managed focus lone channel telling hoax. FOX shit sometimes, personal responsibility needs take hold. I‚Äôm means anti-vaxxer (for real get every vaccine haven‚Äôt missed flu shot since childhood)but think it‚Äôd ridiculous require people get most-rushed vaccine human history refuse treat otherwise. Long term side affects vaccine can‚Äôt studied 10 month time frame. I‚Äôll likely get vaccine comes (I trust scientists, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll fine) also can‚Äôt really blame young healthy person thinking it‚Äôs safer risk virus (which likely won‚Äôt affect much all) vaccine  lies come phenomenon originated time written history? 

Now written history instantaneous electronic proportion people lying increased compared pre-internet times? district 3 plans. one (called hybrid), full remote person.  state government mandated offer in-person 57% parents said wanted remote, realized teaching stuff hybrid well axed it. head scratching stuff. first looked issue, thought - WTF.. surely cannot true??? evidence read, found nothing contradict it. 

It also certain cannot know false positive rate PCR tests without widespread testing people certainly virus, proven method independent test (having solid gold standard).

Therefore, hardly surprising several papers illustrating irrational test results.

For example, already February health authority China‚Äôs Guangdong province reported people fully recovered illness blamed COVID-19, started test ‚Äúnegative,‚Äù [tested ‚Äúpositive‚Äù month later, paper published *Journal Medical Virology* showed 29 610 patients hospital Wuhan 3 6 test results flipped [‚Äúnegative‚Äù, ‚Äúpositive‚Äù third example study Singapore tests carried almost daily 18 patients majority went ‚Äúpositive‚Äù ‚Äúnegative‚Äù back ‚Äúpositive‚Äù least once, and[ five times one Wang Chen, president Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, conceded February PCR tests [*‚Äúonly 30 50 per cent Sin Hang Lee Milford Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory sent l[etter WHO‚Äôs coronavirus team Anthony S. Fauci March 22, 2020, saying widely reported social media RT-qPCR \[Reverse Transcriptase quantitative PCR\] test kits used detect SARSCoV-2 RNA human specimens generating many false positive results sensitive enough detect real positive cases.‚Äù*

In words, even theoretically assume PCR tests really detect viral infection, tests would practically worthless. also possible people getting less sick. people need go hospital staying home. walking pneumonia, could go hospital treated, could stay home. different individuals assess illness differently show every thread reporting numbers explain delayed 2-3 days? must lot time blow. too, chicago. Perfect. 1700-2020 both. Fair. go away get sunlight *inside* body. Exactly. I‚Äôve year bit shocked young Tampa is. explained drug expensive research &amp; development expensive. questioning whether r &amp; actually expensive bigpharm pocketing great deal money too? they're using inflated research costs justify inflated drug costs, they're scamming everyone twice.  called food stamps. Yes grocery store still gets paid person receiving food stamps pay pocket. government could implement something similar cared poor. wont. Instead continue protect 1% exactly this..point finger eachother screaming pay me, save me! made mistake, huge mistake, taken responsibility. Memphis gets lot hype US pop culture it‚Äôs actually poor city, people compliant mask mandate it‚Äôs going affect harder than, say, Nashville. *say* that, that's reads like. also sounds like judge based message, information. bit cherry picking, will. Thanks. Took walk Brooklyn yesterday saw maybe 60% people wearing masks best. people like eating inside fast food restaurant anyway. get missing sit even though it‚Äôs safe currently couldn‚Äôt care less fast food indoor dining went away completely. *so* good hear around! Well, except getting mocked bit, sad hvae heard normal Sweden people decide take disease seriously FHM says taken.

It also good right S√°mi people granted exceptions re: borders therefore, say, suffering caused Swedish government. wondering glad learn case. wish continued good health fortune (and continued stubbornness faced Swedish government dumb things might harm S√°mi people)! AHAHA ran everyone calling out.

Here again: USA 5% worlds population 25% worlds coronavirus deaths aren‚Äôt they‚Äôre doing: masks family 10k per year pretty reasonable. single kids. I've never private insurance cap reasonable amount. dumb. you‚Äôre still going...? cases plateauing while, deaths declining nicely. logic, deaths declined all, cases plateauing. Chances happening unbelievably low CA. basically means inside, shopping checking goes much quicker far less people store. says judge reporting based source rather merits.

You care source good bad. supports agenda? got mine done! said tomorrow see results news, sky blue. Time update knowledge. China upgrading years. Ducey tongue far Agent Orange's butthole I'd surprised taste anything tanning cream. know us anything it. like Doug Douchey tell means somewhat greater infectivity overall. go school? $100k year borderline criminal schools $50k year (with cursory research done) So, newspaper headlines fulfilled purpose, creating traffic ad revenue. Factual correctness? Nah, time.

The Danish paper eb.dk originally story also posts stories like ""Light seen Mexico could aliens"" paper show mutation train specific Denmark also appeared samples outside, like Iceland Sweden. swedish ones northern central sweden, southern.

Many people going back forth, surprising. worked Danish company cooperated industrial facility middle Sweden. people coming every day trucks samples stuff it. people going back forth meetings check things time.

That sort stuff would never closed Denmark think. Sweden either close much.

Another thing Sweden terrible testing like 2 weeks ago amped up. may samles tis mutation regions.

Iceland's testing relied 100%, know doing. Latvia know about. Maybe time expand boundaries try something never done before. Driving across country fulfilling fun thing do. 

You could easily break 26 hour drive three days sightsee along way. science-based sub people either:

1. read study commenting on
2. know difference correlation causation.

You're great, guys. college, would take year off. Yep. virus nailed them. wrong side government. side profiting government. full statement -

**Friends,** 

As number new cases around country continue increase, Memphis different. new case numbers, positivity rate, hospitalizations rise. things mind, believe critical point fight virus.

For months you‚Äôve heard me, medical experts, community faith leaders, requests wear facial covering public, thoroughly wash hands, practice social distancing, stay home you‚Äôre sick. And, keep hearing things City Council passed mask ordinance, enforcing it.

\*\*But, end day, choice put others risk right things.\*\*

I‚Äôm fully aware community around country who, whatever reasons may be, taking seriously. I‚Äôm tell today‚Äîthey should. It‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt want take advice, cannot argue numbers.

In today‚Äôs update, I‚Äôm including several data points demonstrate everything I‚Äôve written above. hope review take seriously.

**The health citizens future economy depend it.**

\----

the choice yours....i even know say ^This.

The 2 things same, conclusions can't drawn both. One extremely common symptoms recovered patient ongoing extreme fatigue. patients problems catching breath talking.

But permanent disability.

It's hear *a lot* - 

""Even people recover Covid, even people mild symptoms, tons live permanent damage rest lives.""

And statements like pretty ""confident"".

But dont see evidence permanent damage remotely common.

Of course find studies say something like ""*Some* patients survive Covid19 *may* suffer permanent damage"".

But surprised people managed find way tell stories. Really could care less

At least care bit then. It‚Äôs cuz step front bus corona virus, media chalks corona virus death. we‚Äôve protests straight month country, don‚Äôt know protests happen every major city Europe now. You‚Äôre correct population tho, we‚Äôre side world, idk got hit hard. Nice! much Florida Arizona test? can‚Äôt atm U.S. fucked, it‚Äôs fucked, way it‚Äôll easier completely shut won‚Äôt happen. Come flu season it‚Äôs gonna get much worse again. Yeah risk innocent people's lives within next weeks risk washing herbicide store bought veggies.

And specifically talking garden plants. I'm denying exist, common easy grow, hardy, garden plants also substituted animal protein? mean smaller exposures virus successful inducing symptoms previous? increase virulence decrease it? Reddit telling old people's fault young people wearing masks. That's I'm seeing, stats say, demographics news cases says.  That's great want believe anyway, I'm sticking facts. lot people making selling Etsy. making giving away, friends. cost fabric supplies adding up, though. Still, something anyone basic sewing machine want contribute something meaningful right now. started, didn‚Äôt even know thread sewing machine much less use (someone gave years ago.) really don‚Äôt need experience... learned doing. transmit faster reduces severity infected cases? mean, I'm either. seems like chlorinated water might marginally safer sea water. ""Fucking joke disaster"" could adequately describe lot systems America. suggesting it‚Äôs bad know it‚Äôs numbers rolling next day? Oh come on, coronavirus hit men far worse women.

But guess ""gender wage gap"" Men dying women peoples eyes. ‚ÄúPeople think patient got well hospital, OK, it‚Äôs over,‚Äù Kim Victory said. ‚ÄúI worry virus didn‚Äôt kill back then, would affected body enough kill now?‚Äù know protests led increase cases? Case counts climbing rapidly many states recently.

P.S. think protests necessary thing happen regardless pandemic, I'm sure assume leading cases. cheap clippers amazon fixed hair problems, i'm probably gonna keep look since low maintenance. can't believe people actualy protesting go get hair done stop espousing mentality I'm sure spent marketing drugs doctors, made even overpriced drugs. could afford make cheaper. cares voters want. cross Trump DeSantis voters venn diagram practically circle. course, fact nobody appropriately socially distanced airplane *also* good reason pack planes full, every flight infected person becomes superspreader. I'm sorry cure, live virus. Cold sores brought infections, fever, stress, sunlight, cold weather, hormone changes menstruation pregnancy, tooth extractions, certain foods drugs. lot people, cause unpredictable. microcosm US general. anti-mask people end forcing spread coronavirus, result states forcing us regress close businesses again. subset protest businesses closed, connecting dots anti-maskers ones forced happen. contracted themselves, severe enough care likely killing someone flaunting naked faces. Im betting alot people going beach day saying virus stop us celebrating freedom. healthcare joke pandemic didn‚Äôt make people see that, nothing objective all. timeline events show significant delay discovery new information release public. Within days. longest stretch week, which, standards, even ignoring red tape, pretty fast.

All information available found it. Confirmation community spread, everyone waiting for, determined multi nation group scientists China (including Taiwan). confirmed human transmission, China shut Wuhan. everyone else notified around 23 Jan.

Not mention CDC knew happening entire time. 

Who power shut CDC months, event designed specifically deal with?

China? WHO? US president?

No, happened still happening, clearly, ignoring EVERYTHING, prideful, arrogant, easier blame everyone else. get wrong great finally seeing stupid fucks, part also, get fucking deserve moronic norm exception? I'm sorry say see online way US people reacting virus situation makes look like morons. 

Is majority US people acting stupid brainless ways, minority making news? think Facebook social media effective spreading conspiracies misinformation?  No, that's retaliation. walk back lean forward again, might able justify self-defense preventing harm you.

But someone coughing reacting punching would get charged battery likely.

It also depends judge opinions situation. may find justifiable climate right now. know Beforetimes. spiraling directly towards bankruptcy several reasons. huge fixed costs massive debt obligations. Even without pandemic, margins tiny sales highly sensitive economic conditions. effects 10% unemployment alone enough completely remove hope profitability. airlines around know couple years would pretty big surprise.

Side note: get protein? Dude, feel you. wife sold everything could moved town 400 Amish country.

We fully expect great depression 2, planning accordingly.  heard local places getting fined violating social distancing, clearly attitude ""let's see get away with"" instead ""let's safe rather sorry"" bar owners travel realize would hundreds thousands re-infections already developed immunity? never feel hatred toward human beings much. thread everyone says anything rational reasonable getting downvoted That‚Äôs got nothing virus burning out.

Of course, people hopefully wake deal shit companies anymore required pay money tests, many think pay? Shutdowns often unintended consequences. thing am. Shutting things, everything causes things still open even crowded.

The thing irked shutdowns city started closing grocery store 6:00pm made people store time. Oh please highlight then. way displayed cognitive dissonance? 

I acknowledged current protests contribute spread virus, considering wear masks, make relatively small portion population, pales comparison 30 - 40% population actually believes masks lockdowns tyranny refuse make effort whatsoever. 

Enlighten wise one help encourage people take mask wearing, social distancing, proven measure seriously? Wait officially decide this? Please dear God no. Lol Europe isn‚Äôt even testing asymptomatic people. wonder numbers lower symptom deeper epidemic within United States. covid19 pandemic shined starkest light. certainly shined light strongest me. They'd murder dollar could get away it. Infinite greed, infinite cruelty, infinite selfishness. There's morality ethics left large segment United States. veneer shattered dark evil revealed. Hah, limes chicken drumsticks two things get ordered. want China develop vaccine bottom heart, making assumption?

No one said you, shut up. stop right clear CCP brigading thread. type like frustrated uninformed teenager point everyone wrong without providing clear evidence why. 

But fuck - I'll continue sake sane people come across this. ""seemingly cutting corners"" response science?

I dunno - following scientific method, one? track record vaccines proven protocols circumvented resulting devastation? know...cutting want know vaccines, consult public information released companies instead making assumptions, progress vaccine's development public, whether thwarted.

Yeahhhhh - companies forced report saying, either all, strict requirements honest truthful (instead publishing positive). **Sinopharm** (the vaccine relying inactivated virus) **state-run chinese company**.

I would think dumbass pandemic would fall unreasonable territory pretty quickly. someone lives people gets infected, away avoid infecting them? Cool I'll add book list. Well, lets look could test theory.

The US population 382M. infect 20%, 76.4M. 2% die 1.528M. 

This would HOPE could contained point (no guarantee) understanding affected gong lifelong health issues, shorter lives.

It seem approach worth looking at. Instead seems better try find ways control spread, reduce infection. LA? Santa Clara County think bar opened governor still advised close them. can't imagine indoor open LA county either, normal pace anyway American‚Äôs trust US world leader collapses pandemic I've read articles people intentionally cough people/store items getting arrested terrorism. logic, beating terrorism ultimate American thing do. Yeah well March country realized big problem was. point many future victims already infected. 

Also weather nicer country, even people behave recklessly likely outside carries much lower risk infection. Dont question stupidity... US can't Mortgage Backed Securities still thing, go, credit default swaps blow up.

I really disappointed sizable minority fellow Americans voted con artist. Austria one countries allow one passport tho. could would change Austrian passport german, french Italien fast could one EU one place actually decide live. Exactly. Back February, friend thought regular flu developed ulcers mouth esophagus. Still doctor London told worry. said went two weeks. recovered, flew back NY summer house, got tested antibodies recently. doctor told immunity likely last one two months. get strains. She‚Äôs scared getting hospitalized she‚Äôs put strict lockdown. Every government wants control press. Especially populist governments strongmen. crisis given opportunity, trend follow even pandemic believe. Correct Yes. I'm antivaxer means. definitely think first running people get vaccine. believe rush finish vaccine necessary, way able confirm bulk possible side effects use more. think vaccine major side effects, possible enough cautious Yep yep yep. JPOW's money printer keeps going BRRRRRR try hide fact actual economy freefall.

It's completely unsustainable ""solution"" that's going leave next government *enormous* sack debt--all artificially prop market investors fucking realize demand nobody going outside. getting publicity media, meaning people going blindsided next gov't steps immediately blame them. absolutely first, allowed white washed conservative politics.

Aussie 100% heading UK path, sacrifice people economy, 2 major things happened.

NZ closed down.

The premiers VIC NSW started demanding same.

Once 2 premiers populous states started defying government immediately started tow line.

Anything else revisionist history. seeing sides aisle decades. guys almost Maritimers anyway. Sure, come in, Nobody Fair Balanced like would Europe look U.S. leader?

Trump can't even lead U.S. right direction Covid19.


He let Dr Fauci speak, let Dr Brix speak, tell people follow local state, county city guidelines, shut international travel, travel industry.


Then appeal base whine local governments eased restrictions, international travel ban still place, people travel industry work. whine like base refuses wear mask. hold rallies one heavily vetted get within 6ft anyway, pack followers in, ignoring local 6ft rules. go back state people follow local guidelines.


So, matter side on, Trump say want see hear least once. flip flop daily basis. northeast great job. rest need learn tough one. I‚Äôm reliant CTA don‚Äôt car. I‚Äôve mostly able avoid working home fixing bicycle, grinds on, I‚Äôve take (e.g. dr appointments couldn‚Äôt reschedule far walk ride bike taxis/rideshare expensive), know people going back work also need take it. going four months it‚Äôs frustrating see countries managed well yet still stuck many cases really shouldn‚Äôt going much. You. are. United States are.

Canada fine üòé US Finland back, cost varies quite bit depending travel. main problem rist contracting covid US required (at least moment) quarantine would come back. Finnish citizen there's doubt could return, quarantine coming back issue, never mind risk becoming seriously ill Covid. actually opposite well said. Anyone asking lots rhetorical, emotional questions making terrible argument.

The fact can't see this, speaks volumes lack critical thinking analytical skills.

""Well said"" needs reserved good arguments, emotional screeds devoid actual argument.

For fuck's sake. say, do... interesting... haven't. share insights here? snake oil anyone? article paywalled can't read it, Sweden guidelines prioritizing away people physical age (based overall health, long lived) 80+. preliminary case overcapacity, and, far know, used today. right now, done case case basis. patent expected survive treatment might humane give morphine instead stringing along painful treatment hope might pull through, do, bedridden complications rest lives. course I'd mad grandma died, trust doctors enough make correct judgement.  Food thought: everyone invested Apple stock instead upgrading iPhone, still portfolio now, Apple stock would worthless. brother Ireland says things like - we‚Äôre bad least we‚Äôre UK.

Probably get lots views someone throws backhand way. going hurt businesses really bad. Imagine bar rebuilt inventories see rendered useless second lockdown...

This exactly us it. Opening indoor gatherings sort guaranteed effect.

Now, going thru shut again. Workers gotta reapply UI, inventory spoil... That's true. Case numbers rising rapidly places riots, many rural areas across country. Case numbers would expected correlate riot locations, not. blaming boogeyman systemic failure actually led tragedy. 

That might make feel better, problem get worse recognize surge due Americans wearing masks social distancing. rioters probably contribute much less folks grocery store masks on. least rioters making effort, Americans absolutely not. riots nearly impactful careless actions tens (hundreds?) millions ignorant citizens. Read advocate strict Blaming CDC Dr Fauci anti-vaccine crowd almost stupid believing necessity vaccination.

I'm saying arguing bad faith, say I've never met anyone made argument intelligent arguing good faith.

Personal social responsibility trump bad feelings one carries leadership. Even Dr Fauci lying, us responsibility fellow humans educate ourselves, act best interest people.

Your comments nothing fix problems, everything bolster anti-intellectual, emotional arguments. sucks. What's journey? much cost? Italy 20% according polls. agree 1-4 factor. seen thing would lead believe 5 much impact.

Also, recently new drug brought deaths quite bit, low dose. increase dose there's possibility could even greater effect. front row seat collapse century old empire. Start diary future documentaries read stars day comprehensive miniseries. /r/gatekeeping kind order. kind order encourages people stay home. collapsing that, let's honest think Pence would tell pray entering elevator. take care ;/ Americans think good drivers abide law.

Face masks required public transport since June. Bars closed shops never mandated close. People always allowed go outside, also hasn‚Äôt travel ban either going out, advise it. People still asked keep 5 feet distance times, wash hands 20 seconds, stay home feel sick way work home possible. guidance obeyed less less look around me. Barbershops opened early May bars movie theaters allowed open since June. New cases still dropping. 6000 deaths total, count surplus deaths would close 10.000 lack testing early months lot undiagnosed deaths elderly homes. Currently everybody wants get tested immediately. Antibody tests show less 10% infection rate total, aren‚Äôt closer herd immunity. Even though live dense populated country.

I say government never asked us wear face masks still seem confined virus. government never asked us wear face masks shortage good N95 face masks health workers wasn‚Äôt clear good regular face masks would stopping virus. really emphasize importance keeping 5 feet apart height spread people practiced keeping distance well.

I‚Äôm advocating face masks, might golden bullet people make be. Although think people wear face masks / second wave hits us. whole issue hasn‚Äôt really politicized.

Btw I‚Äôm surprised Americans aren‚Äôt better stopping virus. would money general fear germs pandemics specific would favor.

No mandated masks. Amsterdam busy crowded again. Cafes, pubs restaurants open since 1st June, four weeks ago yet new daily cases still decreasing trend lowest since mid-March despite huge increases testing since then: strongly question assertion UK's curve reverse pretty soon due opening pubs restaurants (a month later Europe did!) lack mask wearing. way speak tells have, answer this: would planting fresh plants garden?

Gothenburg, Sweden. sharp increase number corona samples breaking biomedical analysts Sahlgrenska, protection stop imminent.

- **The workload huge, weeping stress fatigue, says Marie Karlsson, works lab.**

The department sounded alarm consultation management number tests laboratory slowed sharply.

An emergency round protection set day Midsummer Eve, something Acting Chief Executive Lars Palmqvist claims taken initiative.

""The situation serious risked safety stop, staff worn out,"" says.

#Worked 14 hours day

At emergency protection round found, among things, tests staff managed, overtime unit 170 hours, key employees worked 14 hours day employees barely time break communication hospital management inadequate.

The consequences pandemic major consequences last phase - short change, laboratories would suddenly analyze twice much usual.

**From January end May year, Clinical Microbiology Sahlgrenska University Hospital Gothenburg analyzed many samples one would normally whole year, without resources significantly increased.**

#""We cried felt anxiety""

Marie Karlsson, biomedical analyst, says period March May, effects pandemic grew, workload extreme.

#It pure disaster - sudden, thousands samples collapsed without us able handle everything properly.

- worked worked went extra weekends. end, tired could anything outside work, like brain let go. felt bad physically mentally, cried felt anxiety. midst this, information us would happen extremely flawed, says.

The peak reached month ago decided coronate testing would significantly expanded.

- pure disaster - suddenly thousands samples collapsed without us able handle everything properly.

#The union: ""Feeling stress came door""

The day midsummer, unions called emergency security check. 

Gunilla Lundberg, main safety representative Health Association, says:

- huge burden staff. felt stress soon got inside door. breaks lunch breaks staff take minimal, says, continues:

- fact pressure sometimes severe one thing - load high throughout pandemic increased recent times. long run, risk staff health, stresses.

#The drop caused beaker run over.

She says pressure analytics grown whole time testing groups increased; patients health care, healthcare personnel, professional groups socially important functions - general public submitted samples via Health Center. drip made beaker run over.

- switched health system pressure became great. Partly staff, partly large resources needed handle large quantities, says.

#It always easy wise hindsight- course realized effect increased volumes earlier stage.

It acknowledged region's management pressure testing public underestimated - laboratories well.

Lars Palmkvist, associate responsible Clinical Microbiology SU, says burden staff result corona pandemic high long time.
#Chief Operating Officer: ""Always easy wise hindsight""

- always easy wise hindsight - course realized effect increased volumes earlier stage. gone far, region would acted earlier, says continues:

- hired extra staff, ensure quality assurance analyses qualified work takes time learn, says.

Following emergency secutitry inspection, follow-up taken place several measures taken unions management believe ease burden.

- surely intense weeks measures produce results, says Lars Palmqvist. know since we've moved wear masks time outside actually helped subside allergy symptoms. actually use less allergy medicine wear mask.

The 5 COVID-19 seasonal pattern. Apparently, never vegetable garden. harm. 

If vaccine harm good, failure. We've seen faulty swine flu vaccine, dengue fever vaccine caused ade increased chance death....

There's several severe consequences happen vaccine goes wrong. medical science. That's rigorous vaccine drug approval processes- place past failures.

Not mention people may assume high degree efficiency unproven yet- leading people getting sick.

This western mind. nervous someone gambling human lives. That's normal, I'm shocked comprehend that. Cant say am. nothing start all. Ignored NYC hot spot, people want go bars beaches. Well look turned out. Even politicians would rather keep things open. seeing pig heaed comment constitution amd rights makes sick. Sorry hear that.

Lots stuff built need. Put money towards infrastructure repair country would go places. Obese Diabetics Texas last long  Joey Salads congress Good idea.. cops need break beating black folks.. let beat anti maskers instead. I'm sure getting downvoted. widespread potentially harmful virus is, much possibility companies require take easiest way minimizing spread virus, making sure take sick time, ensure smooth work flow/keeping employees symptom free, given medical restrictions prohibit taking vaccine. Companies follow science/CDC recommendations means best shot keeping company running 100%, regardless agree disagree findings/solutions. Companies likely even pay vaccination healthcare cover it. might even go far requiring tested everytime starting work choose vaccinate (in would pay tests, considering would much expensive getting vaccinated). fire following mask policies, vaccines too. (At least at-will employment states.) memories unfortunately. gerd dayum 'pocalypse, think we're entitled little reveling. also short days. Keep pushing goalposts back. Show average 4 5 weeks pleeeaaasse DeSantis going best ‚Äúdumb shit say‚Äô album rival Trump. get vaccine prevent getting virus. never mean know fight off, means exposed/infected. trying figure population might immunity due common colds. Oh, fuck off. I'm graduate, dick. I've working ass off.
I like either, yet, fucking am.

We already epidemic ignorance country. people like you, I'm surprised. Florida renamed Covida Floridians called Covidians. Stupid, boooo, virus scam Sewage water tells us shit ton stuff factories illegally dumping shit system, diseases, battery dump leakages, environmental health, etc. issue Minnesota protests far active would spiking highest, Florida, Arizona Texas. missing point. Herd immunity PREVENTS mutation. That's vaccine keeps working decades. herd immunity breaks down, vaccine could stop working.

So choose vaccinate kid ""just cause,"" making child take risks consent behalf, also harming everyone else face possible risk vaccine failure.

This decision affects you. get freedom kill people. That's go jail failing disclose partner HIV, people refuse vaccinate face restrictions well.

I can't bothered moonbat carrying microchips (have ever seen microchip needle, dude?). carry block bin. even 80% people always wear masks, still 64 million people USA always wear masks spread virus completely unsustainable growth.

I expect nip bud, absurd borders economy open don't. eg, clubs, stadiums, etc. open, encourages people come things - *despite there's good reason Victorians filling stadiums right now*.

And that's thing. Open borders = generally similar levels economy openness. Personally, I'd prefer open economy closed borders vice versa, respect may prefer opposite. werent election 3 months later pres R c gress would agree R‚Äôs would let expire, one election doubt it‚Äôll get extended fashion. Maybe lesser amount restrictions/limitations, theyre going let expire wholesale.  $500 pop. jail. $500 every time. warnings. many idiots twice? Americans constantly called every name book ban travel another country ours. tried ban China beginning Covid called racists it. Granted, didn‚Äôt really try ban China hard, mentioned absolutely despised it. Arkansas voters are

That right there. knows full well states this, constituents he's seen ""fighting rights"".

God really wish politics could take step aside stop grandstanding times. Floridian here, us wearing masks social distancing... us psycho Karen's complaining God's us breathe air gave us whatever bullshit they're saying meetings. wish would shut state back down. people seem feel like fake news around though, flu. 

I've flu. sucks. want again. dumb. money reinvested infrastructure we'd plenty jobs fill. country fucking falling apart.  Bad news: Doctors worst people ask medical advice. 

Guess common:

Lobotomies, cigarettes, fresh air, cocaine, lortabs, Codine, Fentanyl, blood letting. 

You guessed it, doctors said right prescribing them. 

To sum up:

Politician doctor, guessing time research done something. However, want kill husband, hear Donald Trump said something close fish tank cleaner ingredients cure you.... go ahead knock ex-lover blame Trump. Sweden went crazy deaths per capita. Superb job. Japanese always great wearing masks people following guidelines. uniformed people like U.S complain wearing mask. I'm sure Korea. could wrong, less cases China example, state FL seem right me. share sentiment. lol

you can't think reply insult me. good one. [The Oxford lab head-start already working similarly styled vaccine prevent Middle East respiratory syndrome, MERS, another coronavirus-caused disease first detected Saudi Arabia 2012. Oxford says new candidate vaccine, virus causes covid-19, proved effective safe rhesus monkeys earliest stage may want look r/COVID19 science oriented. Plenty articles different vaccines advancing. Oxford ahead others, others far behind. governments cutting lot red tape this. ~~stupid~~ American? race grouping humans based shared physical social qualities categories generally viewed distinct society. I'm sure Trump throw hissy fit threaten Europe tariffs something not, you‚Äôre trying play race card know damn well can‚Äôt.

Of course, clear case work planned. Personally, I'm going bars venues time soon. Wait, actually open? people went? guess mind Xi world ruler. God-Emperor says it, care  entire god damn northeast jobs stop spread. It‚Äôs fucking south that‚Äôs idiotic mouth breathers usual  body wouldn‚Äôt know fight something it‚Äôs never encountered. vaccine preventative. Helps prevent getting virus teaching body fight it. didn‚Äôt get corona doesn‚Äôt mean already fought body. could got lucky exposed it. put threats quotes. Who? one things would think would law. Kinda seems important democracy. getting ethical dilemmas draw line. think Americans tolerant ~60,000 deaths year mostly kill really old people. tolerant, however, millions deaths across age spectrum. line drawn two points? know. 

But know absolutely take simple precautions nationwide prevent covid-19, e.g., masks, handwashing, banning mass gatherings like concerts, etc. think everybody else crazy, probably you. Millions people stupid. However paranoia helped clearly failing system. Loss trust establishment foster conspiracy. even USA not-test people properly. hope lost. South America Middle East wondering try many take president says camera?

Never. guess he'll never say it. ***May have?!***

WTF. Florida man here... gonna call bullshit one because... eyes. agree more! flu, right? Get evil piece Satan's cloth away poor sick man!! hard differentiate mistake ""mistakes"". *Puts tin foil hat* lolz work University's physics department cooperation Psychology department VR related research. Hes salt posting something Joe Biden said. happens hospitals full? happen SARS2 contained. Kernel panic: Fatal exception casino never intended infect them. life sucks everyone, one's fault, there's nothing anyone it. assertions true? Journalists blame too. Even journalists report science often either don‚Äôt understand science enough report accurately deliberately mislead scientific finding creates better headline.

I discussion guy otherwise intelligent person got idea head Vitamin sole determining factor whether Coronavirus kills shitty reporting one study indicates could relationship higher levels Vitamin Coronavirus survival rates.

So science doesn‚Äôt turn journalists reported people end distrusting scientists rather recognising shitty reporting mislead expectations joe biden president know protests across north too, right? Including New York? place that's currently seeing continued dramatic drop cases? Quit suckling Tuck's teats look data damn self Little Virus Could second wave expected wear inadequate PPE happy it. mean really expect hospitals waste money expendable supplies? I've never felt like cog money generating machine. think Wartime president thing Fauci got Trump play ball, however briefly. didn‚Äôt hear wartime rhetoric Fauci clearly made impact.I think equating virus war made easier coax right thing. interesting see 50 different ways handle virus. think Maryland pretty good. currently admitted one larger hospitals ghost town. live close Sacramento unfortunately mask usage 50/50. Took drive last night past downtown area saw huge maskless crowd bars last night.

Kinda sucks serious note - reactance psychology

For whoever  asking storm beaches Normandy. convince young people that, saving free world? Leadership. hope drones designed take tank treads called ""Track Whackers.""  Maybe, maybe, people protesting BLM care peoples lives likely wear mask sanitize etc. 

I know, crazy idea. ...or use ventilator. Oooohhh noooo. Bad, naughty sex. Well one shock. Total utter disbelief. That's splitting groups online, person. school magically twice big half students given day. So, get Coronavirus get ill it, going forego medical treatment, seeing God gave perfect breathing system all? need insulin painkillers, going leave one God too? ""right track"" clearly means something different him. reason Fox News getting many people killed? One best articles I‚Äôve read Corona far. Raises many interesting issues, starting incredibly tough ones messaging strategy. Consider strategic messaging (‚Äúlittle asymptomatic spread‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt wear mask‚Äù 2 examples article) vs neutral truthfulness‚Äîthe former deadly failure, latter impossible, even dishonest! get curvy mountain roads? getting vaccine rushed system. vaccinated far major vaccinations family well I'll let test out! True! trying clarify ""not Florida"" comment, could made clear though. California definitely two months rolling things back. I'd pissed. I'm WA crossing fingers increases start level soon. Sigh. know protests across south too, right? Everyone knows chance widespread distribution Q4. may get enough doses health care professionals. That's it. 

Expect photo op Trump getting jab October take credit hard work thousands. medical planner U.S. Army 24 years. Planning contagious disease outbreaks one several scenarios wargamed frequently. pandemic usually run peaks valleys infection related mortality course several years. every one unique, follow somewhat predictable patterns.What unique one effort ""flatten curve"", extends length time human race deal deadly form. also unique politicization surrounding it. comment nothing many people get sick die it. Without effective vaccine (and viruses type particularly difficult get effective vaccine for), likely continue 60-80% human race exposed it. comment everything choices news media make regarding stories run. give daily deaths, weekly deaths total death counts. make daily count makes weekly count, plain logic. Oh boy, work hvac cleaning. job would consider quick still shows 150% airflow. Restaurants probably 25% be. restaurants rarely get done since keyholders show 8 9 three hour job more. Gotta gone doors unlock 11 whatever.

We'll occasionally overnight that's usually smaller places owner available, manager. didn‚Äôt ‚Äúbecome‚Äù highly politicized. One group made politicized self interest. post likely get mod-banned facts involve politicians aren‚Äôt allowed here. control already I'll remember it. necessary activity? No. increase spread virus high degree? Yes. putting risk, family, friends, individuals family friends. taking issue seriously clearly listening contributed problem. taking issue seriously decided it, fuck you, trash.

I surprised passed million deaths rate there's solid solution problem, vaccine. Oh, real shooting war, guarantee Trump ego would fuck thoroughly this. RN who's worked EMS, ER Hospice, 91 year old grandma dementia lives skilled nursing facility, positive covid19 who'll likely survive; beg put fucking mask correctly, keep social distance love holy get info people Science degrees! life could save:) heard minor investment, can't take anything says face value. subscriber thanks thinking stoot. lol information months. Issue media many agencies using incorrectly still point likely stated. called ADU (accessory dwelling unit) zoning code lot areas makes difficult build  companies start fire people june 30 still get full ppp loan forgiveness need/want initial 8-weeks support? still opened. Maybe Iceland New Zealand South Korea control, handful others. various European states? much. ahead cases moment reopened sooner. turns opening places put lots folks close contact dont pandemic control unwise. certainly *his* fault.

Has blame someone. Hispanic farm workers. Young people.

In party personal responsibility, responsibility never something goes wrong. always find someone blame.  won‚Äôt last forever Yes, does. I'm seeing quarantines lockdowns wrong, necessary evil. victory go anyway, virus return they're done.

So, hypothetically speaking, starts spreading Shanghai again. okay going another three month lockdown point? course easy (and correct) say ""Yes, I'm okay happening"" humanitarian standpoint, would affect mentally? I'm asking objectively speaking Shanghai many Covid cases yet, unlikely would happen future, unless find vaccine anytime soon. think repeatedly posting clear non-AV vaccine candidates somewhat irresponsible. Yeah pretty close 100% people NYC mask times, it‚Äôs half put crowded area go indoors. you‚Äôre driving around city (or looking pictures streets) looks like isn‚Äôt great mask compliance, everyone wearing matters. haven‚Äôt seen one neighbors fail put mask going pick mail take trash last month two, haven‚Äôt seen single business (supermarket, takeout restaurant, etc) need enforce mask social distancing policy everyone knows. exactly makes think that. that's exactly why. want anything worship altar business profit. people start dying, worry blamed them. refused enough prevent it. think see system, bare minimum nothing deal issues proactive way. profit give shit that. Let problems fester, let gofundme deal ect.

In Canada, area county zero deaths. Yet emboldened skeptics believe conspiracy, though reality people made good decisions protect them, yet skeptics hate even ""liars"" lol.

Yet, big conspiracy wanted scare us submission...why labelling county deaths Covid caused? fudging numbers? Pretty piss poor fear mongering report zeeerrroooo deaths. less 3000 province. Could say lockdowns zealous? Maybe, better safe sorry. reason every country. panicked March due arrogantly assuming would bw fine. things loosening here. Restaurants serving limited capacity outdoors. Salons opening limited appointments ect. Well yes. looking New York tells that. 3k cases daily shut down. peaked 11k 3 weeks later Ok first that‚Äôs stretch. BLM protests number 1) happened reason outside ‚ÄúI want get haircut‚Äù 2) wearing masks, way around. mask isn‚Äôt cure clear, helps big time stop spread. 

Even assertions true, they‚Äôre clear, say were, remember saying kid goes along ‚Äúif X jumped bridge would too?‚Äù. 1000% analogy, honestly feels like explaining children comes anti mask wearing crowd first foremost!!! ask that, no. Thank proactive responsible. Hang there. Second lockdowns last longer first ones. friends mine three months back sense smell still hasn‚Äôt fully recovered. Today pastor church said 99% people fine, it‚Äôs ok. media scaring us. 

I watching live stream marking calendar stay house longer. Itll worse unless full lock happens ... far looks like isnt happen choice Yeah, still loss sense smell taste week though. already taking quercetin zinc prophylactic showed symptoms. upped dosage, waiting test results. Better qualified current president then. Speaking someone worked roofs roofers. signed that. know risks mitigate them.

A casino employee sign infected highly contagious virus. 

Asswipe. I‚Äôm saying wrong riot, riots didn‚Äôt help fight Covid. believe know better U.S. Centers Disease Control, based upon many months reading things internet.

The odds correct 1 million, possible! think everyone eyes wide open first vaccine unlikely ultimate vaccine. We're going speed, effectiveness ability give repeated doses. many candidate vaccines choosing ultimate vaccine may take couple years. arm growing ass. would quite trick shot. Analyze logic arguments- people gathering protest increase Covid infection people almost anything else public does. don‚Äôt need rocket scientist see hole logic. mandate NC plenty sheriffs said aren‚Äôt going enforce call mask violations. Stop that. like it‚Äôs un needed energy worry. looks alot like fake news website. research upvoting, people. one person top refusing take seriously country fucked.

Doesn't highlights fragile government system is? People really kind. Nothing paid taxpayers, cost CARES Act borrowed money never repaid.

Again, Fed propping market taxpayers. That's saying Florida too. Arizona. president saying it. everybody likes say it.

The charts tell different story. Exponential growth climbing y-axis like rocket ship, across country. end, look fools downplayed still stoppable scorn, deserve. Might well start now. Yes.

Watch next week week Florida passes NY's record high new cases.

My guess late next week. Admirable. think might‚Äôve dropped couple zeros... lockdown ended. virus happy clam. know denier name dognotball. Trying spin doctor people following misguided leave. Hahaha okay. Good argument. This. People aren‚Äôt politicizing virus media is. ever heard July 2009 √úr√ºmqi riots ? wish everyone sub would follow suit. read comments you‚Äôd surprised. sure love kool aid.... added 6500 cases 6/23 barely 1000 statewide lockdown initiated.

Confirmed cases misleading. California running like 10k tests back late March/early April. running almost 100k now.

The true number infected people probably hit first peak back early April like country steady decline that, California didnt tests time confirmed cases misleading. lot increase cases California late May/early June due increased testing. Testing increasing quickly confirmed cases, positivity rate also dropping. However, since early June, changed. Positivity rate eventually flattened started increasing, good sign, probably infected today back early April.

And comparing hospitalizations, better metric isnt influenced testing capacity, California initially reach high point early April steady decline early June, point started increase pretty rapidly surpassed previous peak back early April. timeline coincides pretty well opening timeline adjusting bit lag takes opening cases hospitalizations. Food can‚Äôt really contaminated, since virus really survive respiratory droplets. 

It‚Äôs likely virus replicate nose cells. still replicate mouth eyes, really loves epithelial cells respiratory system. Admit completely misread posted first nothing prove point want make. Short term gains expense long term anything. It‚Äôs always plan GOP cartel needs muh guns muh Jesus. Keep moving goalposts Explain said scientists say ‚Äúit strike you‚Äù sounds like pretty blanket statement **way worse** March. showing ""daily new cases"", showed Total currently ill would obvious. Also like March, real number new infections higher accurately tracked due lack testing. line European nations. already control track smartphone. need crazy nanobots. Dr Fauci recommendations mandatory masks.  illogical. ""look good"" end entire Texas infected hundreds thousands dead, would citizens vote next election?

Donald Trump done election. virtually chance winning had, directly indirectly, mismanaged pandemic, twice. March got control NY, NJ, CT MA. Now, FL, TX, AZ unfortunately, CA. governor willing bidding lose respective elections, whenever occur (some occur time presidential election).

I predict hundreds thousands deaths southern states end year--right Joe Biden's inauguration. leap confidence give people businesses much autonomy controlling trajectory pandemic. Unfortunately, California beyond, we‚Äôve proved whole usually act selfishly generally can‚Äôt trusted protect collective wellbeing. Office US ask coworker plans are? I've wide world sports times, initially thought plan made sense numbers low. they're roof keeping players interacting exposed support staff vice versa nightmare.  zero faith countrymen right thing unfortunately. good. Govt enact much stricter laws protect workers. curious mix. upper classes flustered all, lot middle seems strongly committed class division arent even close top. Whilst that's true viruses evolving way, can't compare rise cases deaths yet. Death data least 2 week lag case data.

At point USA becoming like Guinea-pig rest world. deaths suddenly spike, countries relax measures. NJ masks everywhere inside, inside dining going open soon fourth July weekend coming time, know well really going mid July ... economy I‚Äôm suburb connected Columbus. rarely see people without masks stores. even wear lining (keeping distance) food trucks visit neighborhood.

I‚Äôll add tally Yes. screen mutha fucka's strutting around without mask like place congenital idiocy, entrenched ego-centric social disorder pervasive arrogant-as-fuck syndrome. fair, seems done fair share helping prison reform failed mostly one big fat orange reason news covers two positions relatively equally average person thinks there‚Äôs debate positions.

Even 99% coverage correct, morons dig last 1% youtube start eating processed meat every day setting fire mobile internet towers. agree first paragraph half second. rest complete lies.

Somehow Australia become politicised much all. left care peoples health right know stopping spread best economic move. might alternate day schedule instead. class split group goes school Monday, group B Tuesday, group Wednesday, group B Thursday, group Friday next week way around, receiving copious homework day off. classes happen parks outside. possibilities, heard considered. insane. really stupid, wants next Trump, both? Vote November. I‚Äôm pretty sure idea people don‚Äôt want kids get covid Donald Scump. guess feel differently hopefully don‚Äôt children.

Living Italy makes happy, we‚Äôre track 0, stay safe everyone else times. Bill Gates huge fan population control. thinks overpopulation biggest problem humanity faces, also thinks China handled coronavirus exceptionally well, interesting thing Bill Gates absolutely medical qualifications whatsoever. 

There's way hell I'm letting man inject anything me. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs good idea shut things hospitals hit capacity. Less accidents deal with. want first vaccine. want best vaccine. Lol too. adjustment would actually lying. Ridiculous... People actually think virus dead while. working becoming lawyer.

Trump demented madman passing policies taking actions destroy good friendship toward country DECADES.

The executive branch definitely grown powerful (a lot paper per se) military sense, that's even lot damage Trump done. lot he's done requires complicity, party system issue, issue state system, etc. reducing executive power solve much.

Obviously scientific evidence back opinion, feel like protests majority populated younger people less likely hospitalised covid.

There however lots evidence suggest transmission rates much higher enclosed spaces (like pubs restaurants) compared outdoors. Unless, course, masks worn! (Disclaimer: think choral sing stopped without exception we‚Äôre pandemic.)

That's exact bs people used spout waitresses getting groped, back called waitresses. 

Most places zero tolerance harassment policy. 

Not wearing mask inside bar *is* different deadlier kind harassment. Don‚Äôt know anyone listen Fox News think they‚Äôre helpful think it‚Äôs great news many people become infected require hospital stay treatment all. 

Unfortunately, mitigation strategies place areas country, easily pass others lucky. younger healthy people getting passing anyone else right - long effects, big deal. 

Since that‚Äôs case seems still need slow rate infection drastically avoid overwhelmed ICUs stressed hospital workers. Cant tell real news onion.

SERIOUS. 80% wearing masks, cases rising exponential rate? I'm genuinely curious people blaming protestors, blaming anti-mask groups, say rise testings, etc. actual main reasons rise cases America? pandemic first started, Italy one countries kept increasing numbers terms positive covid (in hundred thousands), already scared traveling Italy. USA 2 million positive covid, citizens still completely comply social distancing masking....I wonder people countries looking USA now? Probably going ban products made USA too. Literal shit ton. starting think systems verge total collapse. attempts politicize science effective politics turned team sports one side accepts alternative facts. way see it. nothing done, like stacking deck instead initial infection got 1.8 million active cased baseline.

* Without trial due process
* foreign country thus unable/difficult defend themselves/challenge decision
* citizenship, makes stateless refugee basically dumps whatever country happen in. dumping criminals another country, fair country/citizens deal them.
* Sometimes mistakes happen govt believes dual citizen fact (eg: Neil Prakash, former Australian citizen). Oh wow, sounds lot like state fast-tracking dine-in reopen Memorial Day. :( dare assume gender! Ok then, numbers. much outbreak worth economy QLD, WA, SA? What's risk per individual? much toll be? really feel like can't breathe wearing mask get face shield. look silly, keeps covered. nurse faculty cannot labs online.

It is, word suggests, gross. Time grow get yourself. sit stoically instead. facility experience teaching online classes. really entirely different way teaching.

I agree tuition crazy expensive. Unfortunately, universities utilize lot adjunct instructors, professors seeing much money. Asking faculty work even less pay good way deal pandemic. get sick near Texas, go evangelical church instead doctor help demographics november since hospital beds available anyway? All, , Some!

wtf want people always wear masks public places. Honestly, answer dollar end day... surprising. novel corona virus respiratory virus this.

Laughs Putin! point Putin come straight Call America Trump bitches chumps still wouldn‚Äôt damn thing. Playing right Russia Chinas game. You‚Äôre losers. would banned Europeans Asians earlier pandemic, wouldn‚Äôt problem first place.

Thanks bringing here, Europe / China. I'm feeling really good getting bidets toilets. allow Chinese since CCP trusted. Stop downplaying dangerous virus is. already killed 3 times many people US 2.5 months flu average six month flu season. 

You literally danger we're talking here. New York halfway there. slows lot way mark well, herd immunity isn‚Äôt binary thing, approach it, spreads slower slower. It‚Äôs virus. grows exponentially dealt early.

China deals early, there‚Äôs handfuls cases. US given up, there‚Äôs mountains cases.

Many overweight, older, shape poor medical care. may shoot foot it. Still round 1, bell! Yeah lack fucks given around Texas pretty bad. We‚Äôve got mix ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want wear it‚Äù screw people‚Äù well ‚Äúmasks make worse‚Äù live commute work. 

So mix prideful stupid basically. telling people wear masks weeks ago. wouldn‚Äôt take anything say seriously they‚Äôve done nothing confuse people virus. French American? French tell know two French people went back week. need download form fill out. ticket agent (you can‚Äôt use computer kiosks), ask form. plane ask fill another form showing name, flight number, seat assignment (this track potential cases). get plane go French customs ask paperwork, stamp passport. CDG sign saying ‚Äúif wish temperature taken, go here‚Äù. mandatory. you‚Äôre way. basically it‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness usual‚Äù point. 

If you‚Äôre American let know I‚Äôll tell need enter. Excellent plan get celebrate birthday 2021 Honestly - gives shit? know it‚Äôs harsh say, middle crisis, tough decisions need made business isn‚Äôt important we‚Äôre talking saving lives. money wallet come back, life lost cannot. if

Take scientists! historically accurate model right now, way:  Europe fucked up. Without us Americans make fun person going start hating twice hard now. Ah feck. means gotta make vaccines strains? 2020 plz stahp... Ah yes, obligatory ""America worst Americans dumb"" - American probably. two brain cells left would playing floor. Really man? kind question that? says US banned reopen.

Many European countries already took banning travel.

Nice try, still fucking abysmal job.  actually living Portugal boyfriend &amp; come back US. it‚Äôs taking one day time :( Whatever happens Strip directly affects rest Las Vegas though. surprised. U.S. citizen made right choice. 

Just don‚Äôt write us yet, we‚Äôre trying turn tide. States pretty much left own.

That excuse crappy job did. 

I agree Feds pretty useless epidemic, States could done better job last 4-6 weeks. rushed re-opening we're staring worse situations months ago.

The way ends remotely ""ok"" (not even good) Feds printing massive amounts money basically floating economy vaccine comes. yet people inevitably try come USA talk country acceptable open foreigners told leave, like always. People fucking stupid, stay fuck home. military 

Arms manufacturers 

The military don‚Äôt want half shit anymore don‚Äôt make diddly fucking squat. Arms companies dat lobbying money figured much. see comments starting ""as American...finally"" well. agree, maybe finally put government back place. ""WASHED PENCE



USED GREAT MAN, ANTIFA SPY

SAD"" say live east coast. went amsterdam days 500 bucks round trip including accommodations. know happen ticket prices post rona though. Looks like plan doesn‚Äôt involve us what‚Äôs new? Lmao. Welcome America. Take step back look past 200+ years history look endless cycles never go away that‚Äôs way system developed work. Progress can‚Äôt made you‚Äôre set back 2 years every positive year. America, id like speak Europes manager. giving benefit doubt assumption good faith. clear response know racist. sad. want us take vaccine, maybe avoid conflicts interest like one happening

Trump‚Äôs new coronavirus vaccine czar owns $10 million stock options company developing trust fox keys hen house? Get this: company happens leading candidate vaccine. possible coincidence, reliable way Americans know people making decisions high levels government conflict interest. like Informed vs Deliberately Misinformed Air travel Canada US banned, land.  Bwahahaha!! I‚Äôve hoping would happen ever since became obvious Trump administration absolutely bungling American response. can‚Äôt wait see/hear Trump‚Äôs response this. must angry. LOL. Proof? thinking exponential growth, numbers like 100, 10000 1000000 seem different actually quite close days appart. That‚Äôs good hear. Nothing wrong wrong grow learn it. 

Personally, don‚Äôt thing you‚Äôre 100% wrong here. believe death rate lower surges one‚Äôs saw New York Detroit. Mostly experience treating seriously ill. However, could draw time takes people die. Also, think bit lower testing people pretty much everyone tested hospital already. But, time tell see. Like person said, it‚Äôs novel reason still don‚Äôt know lot behaves. likely win last time. People said everyone took word it. Expect time. Yeah travel banned right general, permanent right? I'll beyond sad never get chance see places antiquity birthplace... mean, early know virus factor well response is?  Yeah, there‚Äôs free. Others pay for. 

The Black Death one leaving July 1st watch now. Times points out, legally binding list...

I fucking hate Reddit sometimes. appreciate input. something makes doubt timing Oxford vaccine? think realistically expect vaccine? Verily part BS? women similar fulltime job contracts. working part-time/ flex 0 hour contracts? No. Good way adjust emergency circumstances.
Period. universal masking, testing everyone adequate contact tracing could avoided prolonged quarantines entire state; we‚Äôd track infections, quarantine sick contact sick everyone else could gone days, lockdowns done local county level. 

Now however virus make damn sure stay lockdown, whether governors decide and/or depression destroys economy half country job. start recruiting podiatrists stuff help. Complete BS. store work maybe 10% customers wear masks. 30 nobody wears them. mostly older people wearing them. funny note though 60+ year old man come wearing underwear face protest Inslee's face mask order, quite entertaining. Hmm didn't? way victim then? realize calling United States America, ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù common one says ‚ÄúAmerica‚Äù reffering North America right? America isn‚Äôt continent, North America is. commom knowledge world wide, come buddy fear time excess mortality already happened. Meaning: ultra high risk would probably died next 1-4 years died COVID little earlier. 
 
We‚Äôre seeing drop mortality new infections rising. reasons probably complex numerous, high Death rate among weakest early might okay huge rule. social media Yup. worries! :) Ok I‚Äôll give little bit trust. Show data science you‚Äôve done personally. One good friends parents live Arizona, still convinced new cases issues tribes, nothing worry dot feather. 

They still traveling like normal. countries world lower death rate Maryland (so far) coronavirus contain 97.5% world's population.

Nice crushing. Generalize/sensationalize much?
‚ÄúAMERICANS NEVER ALLOWED TRAVEL EUROPE AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!‚Äù It‚Äôs surprising it‚Äôs ironic. took orange shitstain 3 years get us banned world. Elections consequences. Thank you. Two subgroups worked intimately undocumented immigrants (in homes, position trusted), severely profoundly disabled children young adults, including lowest-functioning autistic populations. Undocumented immigrants important right allowing access services health care access, 30 million people current estimate undocumented country. want talk period amnesty, would mutually beneficial right (I mean instant citizenship, path forward). 

We properly educating public PPE. Hospitals releasing CV19 patients N95 masks, filter exhale, people using cloth masks, thinking ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù protect people actually IC, horribly reversed. IC populations need masks. show create bubble subsets, focus energy. need talk free will, immune response, wellness, certainly workers‚Äô rights. When? would ideal do.

I lower tolerance death disease you. Great courses ... amazon prime video?! Something something China, something something culture saving face.


Definitely incompetent fuckwits talent making shit things sound good fuck else offer society malignantly prey on. fourth branch government additional checks balance others. brings question states close borders states. Well currently issues sightseeing Americans claiming driving Alaska going there. Also idk expected make Alaska without stopping Canada, I've driven that's heck journey without stopping food, pee stops, even overnight. long drive maintain zero contact. 

Link: Yup! Deaths take longer cases. Patients ICU weeks finally die. Jesus, dude, living rock. seriously need someone recap last 4 months reddit comment? There's vaccine cite.. People still fight teaching evolution school ü§¶ Thank you! One thing. nothing ironic comment. stated need trust professionals personal research. contradict statement way. could pass law legally requiring it. know People aren‚Äôt wearing masks know risk death negligible long they‚Äôre young. way realistically get people wear masks enforce fines penalties noncompliance. way people it. Trust majority people selfish assholes. don‚Äôt exactly inject little bit virus body. 

Imagine it‚Äôs like ‚ÄúWanted‚Äù poster FBI, picture virus shown body cells see it, know fight it. Impossible rn. citizens residents allowed (and people wirking WETA)  ego wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Wow, thanks letting know. Good looking out, m'dude.


One quick question: mention article 'higher actual capacity' might tested? Like *surge* new cases exceed *capacity*, causing *unsustainable* environment ICU? might really bad. reach ... dunno ... *unsustainable surge capacity*. Possibly even quickly. Like 6th July. can't keep protective measures place high enough percentage population gets vaccinated, Covid19 goes away?

If need lockdown again, stimulus checks people without vaccinations.

Require kids show proof vaccination return school. Well yes true. don‚Äôt try correct everything get annoying people spoke one owners club. owner said nightclub opened registered restaurant.

It‚Äôs Houston,Texas way next epicenter US. disagree first part, chances he's going win 2020... makes fucking sick. work well population studies, correct sensitivity specificity. agree useful individuals. RACISTS!!!! South Carolina says hi. Yet it‚Äôs younger Americans acting like idiots. didn‚Äôt see many boomers beaches Florida. dumbass drunk college kids. China conduct ""human challenge"" testing entire population. rest world would wealth information. might plan, possible. would give China enormous economic advantage. F supporters already care stuff sold campaign made China. Holy shit, interests Moderna?? way. much FREEDUMB herd. yet un sexy things . put usa map world stage many years. Covid-19 killing LOT people flu. scientists cant know vaccine safe long term effects havent studied good point tend agree with. Thanks articulating! lot circumstantial points nothing substance. reads like author axe grind. girlfriend works ed tech special ed preschool. got bit last week.

It feels, inevitable. [I've plotted daily difference 7-day rolling average new cases since surge I'm looking flatten drop indicate inflexion new case numbers. Unfortunately growth accelerating, last 2- days look bit positive terms top curve. peaks, probably around half way height peak, currently peak, 7-day rolling average new cases would reach 58k per day. Tomorrows point differences increasing decreasing 45 948 new cases. seems COVID cause mental problems... scientist, think that's reasonable assumption based flu vaccine still ""kinda"" works reducing symptoms able get strain mark. movie Pearl Harbor marked red Xs badly wounded didn‚Äôt time resources attempt save. wear mask go God affect you? I'm scientist, read Oxford's vaccine, seems stop progression covid death.

The monkeys tested still got covid. think that's kind worrisome since studies saying even mild cases covid cause severe damage. Well fuck Europe then. get epic though one taking serious? see San Diego Orange county closed, countries pass driving east south LA. Riverside San Bernardino suggested lockdown, per article. ""not insanely encourage entire population ""show get test"" they're worried drank beer bar took flight.""

If capacity contact trace stop asymtpomatic people spreading it, like NY seems working, not? 

""Despite cases plateauing -- increasing couple weeks -- death toll steadily trending down. means something changed.""

Yes, called time lag younger people getting infected. YYG model showing second peak deaths lower level first July/August weeks. Makes wonder life would like Hillary Clinton president instead time like this. totally agree insights appreciate taking time articulate. Fucking idiots. work one 2 Level 1 Trauma Centers Houston small number beds set aside severe traumas made priority keep availability pandemic surge. 100% sure name Karen! love politicians blaming young people... Sounds like great way win young people come November. rather dark way Covid-19 equalizer; yes keep blaming young people following guidelines states couldn‚Äôt bothered *enforce* guidelines, let alone follow guidelines reopening. many needlessly suffer, ones suffer stand way progress make decisions: old (and states hard hit now, quite lot population since less educated, less healthy higher incidence commorbidities negative lifestyle choices, less equipped outright failing hospital systems pre-pandemic). It‚Äôs sad, aren‚Äôt going demand compliance cohorts state federal level frankly, deserve it. 

Will ‚Äúthe young made worse‚Äù sound better voters dumb politicians perhaps even dumb politicians 6 feet under? American here, agree this. way country, rather government dealt crisis joke. promise Trump supporting racists. Every country EU hospital beds per capita US. Socialized medicine actually cares people. US many beds great majority hospitals run profit corporations. insulted first response. realized response moronic, trying disengage. Crap, go ""find ourselves"" then? guys we're smart make permanent. American blame you. Alright yellow teeth. Old big question. Immunocompromised generally ok. older people weaker immune reactions early trials include lot older people. So, moment, one knows. Phase 3's supposed 55+ age groups. Trump one true god Red Hats. He‚Äôs one hat needs say this. Honestly ths part surprises took long.  unemployed people upset can't go vacation.. oh wait. That's highly inaccurate! They'll also believe OANN Breitbart conservative talk radio! I'm singing small restaurant 2 foot away people side piano bar.
I've reading covid-19 I'm genuinely afraid family.
The funny thing is, I'm also volunteer firefighter. I'm confident PPE procedures bar seems like massive risk based I've read. guys comments talking vaccines may wanna temper expectations 


There vaccines SARS , MERS coronavirus. Chances slim get one agree shouldn‚Äôt massive lockdown, although venues like bars, concerts, sports maybe universities going tough manage Plus well trying exert hard mask on. Even insulating face mask winter pain. 12? can‚Äôt 15 still saying jokes mums. Grow Damn that's amazing. Bay Area, see many without masks outside. Fair points, all. Thank you. anyone notice article 2 months old New Zealand entered Level 1? 

All economies suffering right never equal footing comparing two economies best times. predictions NZ rest 2020 worse teality way tracking since going back level 1. gives fuck.  See pun, idiots? dad told something moved Alaska found true ‚ÄúIn places life hard, people always willing help neighbors don‚Äôt survive without it.‚Äù People move Florida perpetual summertime easy livin. hasn‚Äôt frontier 300 years. disliked things time there. meanwhile, tropical countries : J think NoVA Karen‚Äôs value more? School cops? Problem half country refuses wear masks. even read it? 1/4 article MERS, rest homophobia interfered tracing efforts. Oh yeah. coming together. think people would upset barber shop closing gonna lie..........that's trend anyway. Non AMP version ""Even Gilligan's Island listened Professor millionaire"" Responsibility always goes up. work restraunt stayed open covid 19. first, u.s. cases hit 1 million. roads completely empty, people still ordered food. led creation contact less delivery. time (the course 3 weeks) life returned back normal. Even though regulations expired loosend all. People would CROWD small restraunt staying 2ft away other. atleast wearing masks? Nowadays, people come holding shirt face act like mask. understand they're putting everyone around risk. They're putting risk too. really wish stricter enforcement wearing masks. fines penalties. People can't sit still 3 weeks HOME. Let alone wear mask here.  Double happy cake day! Honestly, wrong. Except others anti-drone capability. Anti-tank capability lot available, portable. Russians shy selling want it.

The biggest change though fast drone strike deployed.

Realistically, right tanks cheaper, though much say. They're also noisy, slower, yes, go walls. unlike drone strike, people time get way. really pro, given drone strikes tend take civilians.

I honestly say tanks even completely obsolete; need building already have. least according military 2015.  Waddle right moms house give thick American beef stick. call daddy I‚Äôll say ‚Äúcheerio‚Äù leave house. Double happy cake day! Technically said masks recommended point, he'll point that. Meanwhile far-right followers listen, Trump refuses caught camera one, pick official statement. zero percent chance protests anything this. Despite Reddits subs pushing multiple articles stating otherwise. Surviving good, get wrong, goal life. many people (likely) lifelong disease stemming ""survived"" COVID. ""meanmug""? Abbott wants get 4oJ economic activity going back it

What absolute piece shit garbage person. mean respectable profession waste management, person whose insides rotting compost. already seeing days deaths given day week week.

I can't think single day except one day last week New Jersey dropped bunch ""probable deaths"" far back March. What‚Äôs typical days give credit Gov main city causing biggest problem entire country. don‚Äôt care blame President, never even brought up. laughing ridiculous notion Cuomo‚Äôs disaster something applaud. OMG mascot. Look them! 

I want like 5 them. want run around home fat cute. animal animal kingdom wants anything Canada gooses Canada mooses I'm pro mask pro vax, honestly blame anyone want vaccine. I'm weary myself. There's many lies much misinformation current government administration we'd stupid question efficacy safety. find first round guinea pigs. Serves right.  problem summarize end, culture. like blaming ""the people"" ""you I"" choose grow instilled values possess, receive miseducation received, exposed well-funded propaganda efforts muddy waters number issues powerful institutions vested interest denying reality.

Meanwhile, actual individuals leadership positions making decisions direct consequences things turning out, better worse. fine conversation broader societal forces play, holding leaders accountable also important. want diffuse blame much.

Also, participating protest activity riskier staying home, also case Black Lives Matter protests addressing one root sources injustice society pandemic one number factors created perfect storm allowing breakthrough progress occur front.

It important movement, unique moment history -- think could even call ""essential"" activity -- perhaps essential individual's daily life, something may prove instrumental bringing long overdue reckoning that's necessary long-term health nation. involves taking risk, borne protestors themselves, there's ethical calculus suggests probably cost/risk that's worth bearing. governor order helps say ""Hey, I'm following rules"" people can't pressure following herd without masking. hope does, he‚Äôs done much damage past 4 years. think things get real ugly matter wins election. I‚Äôm actually bit worried supporters wil react. Yeah REALLLLLLLLLLLLLLLY long ass time. ""weeks"" stretch. go true unbiased facts? friend keeps telling Dr. Eric Nepute reputable source he‚Äôs medical doctor he‚Äôs chiropractor feel he‚Äôs feeding hysteria. Let's forget blame others involved too. dont decide hold concert many people without ok local jurisdictions, pandemic not. dont shits given able go Europe, back year living 6, disappointed become country others restricting due wanting spread disease. 

Thanks, Texas (not live home state smh), Florida, Arizona, California.

Put fucking mask go building fucking animals. 

I believer personal responsibility states rights, dont blame president, blame every asshole thinks mask ""about conformity"" bullshit excuse. 

The US unique states rights flexibility countries' states/equivalent indeed needs states calls adjust necessities. say Montana sparsely populated maybe freedom lax, works out, great.

It easy point president, look governors states fucking up. Pressure THEM. ones making call foe states, president scapegoat really control state actions. Point governors fucking get real action done. don‚Äôt need tell know better! It‚Äôs like saying don‚Äôt play golf electrical storm Shut Pelosi. Hindsight 20/20. NYC right. fuck Trump. people cross Atlantic sail 10 days? May?

Of fucking course did.  good thing? Nature finally chance eliminate conspiracy-theorist-anti-vaccine-idiots. basically, talking ass.

 


I've doctor plenty times too. They've never specifically asked Italy China before. Places West Nile Malaria, yes, like parts Africa India, never Italy China together. I‚Äôm referring ICU beds, beds. 

I think you‚Äôre also making error timing. least 3 weeks growth numbers baked in, can‚Äôt stop even hard Wuhan style lockdown, growth exponential. went 80 daily hospitalizations 2 weeks ago 186/day week. we‚Äôll 432/day two weeks. 

Also, you‚Äôre looking positive test rate. went 4% month ago (which means probably catching lot ‚Äòtrue‚Äô case volume) 22% positive now, means huge untested transmission happening. 

In month, check back post. deaths barely budged TX, maybe point. think evidence points deaths start swinging move 30/day several hundred per day even locks again, won‚Äôt. 7% shop local Walmart?  like posted restructured way presenting capacity ones don‚Äôt get sick. talking friends difference politicians decided ""safe"" drs offices decided safe. I've taken family doctors offices recently a) check temp door, often even driver, b) often allow family members enter, c) wear mask. sort face, covering nose mouth, d) 6' marks EVERYWHERE, interaction closer except doctor/patient necessary. e) hand sanitizer, also EVERYWHERE, encouragement use it.

Gas station: ""uuuuuh 40 people here... P-please wear mask? No? That's okay, employees either."" I'm starting think people unhealthy, people good shape great physical fitness equally susceptible severe infections.

Please define ‚Äúbeat thing.‚Äù mean eliminate virus within state, you‚Äôre dead wrong. don‚Äôt mean that, well always chance resurgence thus states stay completely shut forever (until vaccine, maybe forever) eliminate possible threat.

Or really mean states within *realm acceptable danger*. never see time 0 new covid cases 0 new covid deaths. thing stay. morbid is, number cases deaths per given timeframe comfortable with. plan reaching number *cannot* cause suffering downstream effects Actually, right, I'm sure call country can't contain disease worse slum still charging premium healthcare.

Y‚Äôall better wear damn masks. PLEASE. American wish could ban us, too... 50% person classes really mean anything. still hallways, dining halls, dorms, libraries, bathrooms, doorways, print centers, laundrymats, practice rooms, labs, offices - even half students come class there's 100 different campus locations would reach well safe capacity.

Imagine thirsty gotta go pandemic try get laid. happened today, conversations happening house. many church friends spouting misinformation, could well major change lives around. really sucks, think one around us believe it‚Äôs late. I'd agree low. think still fairly significant level. last study, albeit pre-publication, outdoor transmission Japan 6% 12% cases outdoors. 

6% really low, things considered. still think that's significant enough worth keeping mind. point feeling like people need avoid outdoors anything. think they're 100% immune outdoors. EU citizens states travel Europe though? ticket booked, don‚Äôt want cancelled. NYC seen case increase due protests. case increase mostly dining out, malls, group gatherings etc know Tourism I'm 100% sure wall done President Trump leaves office. go far, decent response would kept things closer. Upstate resident, proud people managed far. No, governor perfect, far it. manage flatten curve! many wars deaths equivalent terms American military deaths? Last checked, combined total Vietnam War, Korean War, wars Middle East. I'm pretty sure add American Revolutionary War War 1812, small engagements since 1945. president even wear mask rallies completely ignoring social distancing standards. Thankfully already coronavirus, didnt symptoms, feel bad people high risk. He‚Äôs saying effectiveness possibility Americans won‚Äôt take it. said unlikely get vaccine 97-98% effective (best done measles) would settle 70-75% effectiveness. cited poll 1/3 Americans would vaccine, said numbers would probably get us herd immunity. CFR, im seeing 1.38% overall, China 5%, Italy 14%. (I know said IFR). think early on, NY great IFR could curve flatter. We've learned lot since then. 

The US averaged 2100 deaths per day April 7th May 7th. looking totals, 65,100 deaths 31 days, would require 8 million infected. 1 million infected April 28th, hidden cases 8 1, would right. think might high, given couple antibody studies indicate quite pervasive. IFR closer 0.12% early on, maybe 4.5 million shadows.

From 10,000 true (mostly hidden) infected March 1st? 5,120,000 infected May 1st would still require 275,000 infected per day maybe 2 weeks? I'd say swag max sustained daily infections time frame pretty close. definitely three big players stick even next tier hospitals offers significantly better care national average. NC best hospitals I‚Äôve worked career. definitely blemishes big hitters incredible. Wow, looks like aged. Shame listening him.  Including state governors. There's use.

Do searching here:  Usually cases rise, deaths rise them. Look every major country large outbreak. least according Worldmeter, peak daily death US peak daily new cases. Ever since everything opened up, protests going on, hasn‚Äôt uptick deaths America, new cases. new situation rn cases increases, deaths still decreasing. I‚Äôm sure flatten, outbreaks driven young people, would unlikely see massive amount deaths, unless median age new cases drastically rises. reached point cases rise, control death toll, wouldn‚Äôt accomplish original goal flatten curve large excess deaths?

And bold assume I‚Äôm anti-mask lol. 4 different masks house, car, box full N95. time I‚Äôm anti-mask go running lol.

The lockdowns thing issues with. We‚Äôre talking action cost +40 million Americans lose jobs, it‚Äôs awful. There‚Äôs also consequences, like depression, people preventable diseases might allowed see doctors. clear bias lockdowns, like certain protests bad, protests good, causing whole lot distrust gov media rn.

If look Japan South Korea did, everyone smart wearing mask, avoiding crowded closed spaces , go hot spots, lockdown would pointless. sadly, many incompetent people country, fueled incompetent divisive government media.

Not many wise leaders US right now. Well know? summertime, one get sick warm outside. stories, on, people tested positive months. know whether stories discredited might explain re-infections taking place. would attribute piss poor leadership. know America country matters?! They're it!

I agree assessment lot cases New York back March Florida, really look hospitalisations prime ‚Äúshit hits fan‚Äù indicator.

The virus surviving thriving though summer non-optimal conditions.

When hurricane season hits put people together football arena‚Äôs, expect worse. I'm saying right go bar, I'm telling point valid everyone: everyone family.

Whats one doctor TV show, radio show, millions followers much ""the flu worse"". come halfass apologies wrong.

Just cause doctor mean can't think covid fake, big deal, wear masks, etc.

&amp;#x200B;

Even doctors make hard. appear flip flop. listened Chinese CDC (pro mask covid-19) put mask correctly American CDC Surgeon General saying wear one. later start telling ""well mask already cause told need buy one sold everywhere take tshirt wrap rubber bands around it"". Clearly *he* can't. $15 hour area enough. pretenure I‚Äôm guessing you‚Äôre 60 years old? maybe don‚Äôt like train commute wear mask (like became less enjoyable)?

But arbitrary fear commute scientifically based.  Great thank much really appreciate don‚Äôt think even understand totalitarian state is. pointing authority country choose enforce laws time. guess didn‚Äôt like blowing weak ass position simple fact accused side ridiculous position. got it, asymptomatic would body know fight it?

My assumption exposed one point another unless quarantined entire time. may severe mask shortage parents sending kids school. Good luck parents there. Way go correcting typo, killer.

Although, considering settle masks, maybe killer inaccurate. cowardly murder someone virus, though. ah that's bad. I'm still American citizen live anymore. wondering would make moving around Europe difficult me. would let us either. population still essentially 100% vulnerable. news,

No, no, no. That's two many caveats. many people think store mask required sign wear one. wear mask practice social distancing, both. Wear mask whenever public period, social distance well. Seems right. state that? Trumps presidency went isolating US potential threats getting isolated everyone else.

It honestly best presidency (for China) could've ever happend. 
So much shady shit could pushed international media constantly filled asshole behaviour, rather reporting something meaningful.
US allies constantly alienated threats middle-school insults.
The people US reassured calmed announcment Trump troubled times. leader means represent every citizen, fellowship. ever fueled conotroversy, resulting hate. weaken nations unity decades. I'm Spaniard living abroad checking updates consulate, would source, check Italian consulate website sure same, able return September even borders close again. Lol, there's 3% chance show symptoms all. smart ass wants ultimately make mandatory lot things (ie: school, travel, etc) unless immunocompromised can't get it, sucks anti-vaxers choose get it. That's called ""consequence"", people. free choose get vaccine, deal consequences choice. means can't get plane go vacation, sorry. choice made.

But we'd repeat ""BUT MUH FREEDUMBS!"" people would cave let adult anti-vax toddlers way anyway.

Still, half country gets vaccine, better nothing. gladly take jab arm know vaccine safe effective.  Nearly half deaths COVID-19 nursing homes. Governments forced accept COVID-19 patients. story unusual think unfortunately. never claimed know China Chinese. said average Chinese citizen less access free information average Westerner. Make mistake, like country. love it, care truth, see China banning websites platforms social media, can't help extremely skeptical easy truth hidden.

Also understanding majority people asymptomatic really get symptoms older bad immune system. 

I'm young family good immune system (can't remember last time anyone sick) guessed asymptomatic. you‚Äôre total dumbass. Life really come full circle much Vit need take daily? possible increase hospitalizations pneumonia like symptoms first death? Hmmmm... Yeah, reason's called population density. explain New Jersey? None ordinary medical system crisis. doubt US could handle suddenly significantly des creasing food output stop CO2 crap already? There's video physician put pulse oximeter finger read 100%. put surgical mask still read 100%. put second surgical mask still read 100%. put 3rd mask still read 100%. 4th mask change that.

If want breathe CO2 need breathe plastic bag, piece cloth paper. suspicion Philly got bad fast western pa benefited quick lockdown. Never came NY. us dominates Europe culturally?

Seriously?

How figure? addition, lot state governors playing ‚Äúhide bodies‚Äù (don‚Äôt confirm COVID, pneumonia) ‚Äúfudge numbers‚Äù (stop testing, stop publishing daily cases deaths, stop reporting ICU capacity).

It come head 2-4 weeks fear it‚Äôs going much worse March. liable negligence??? Damn, remember annoying 17. 

Actually thinking back, total smartass well. Flu vaccine development different ballgame. 

So much mutation happens time vaccine created time it‚Äôs distributed rarely effective anything partial immunity concur. People ready over... second lockdowns, people going completely totally lose shit. can't even get people wear masks. curbside pickup today wore mask car, maybe 1 10 shopping center even masks. they'll never reopen, guess we're allowed inside.  seem grossly misinformed, that‚Äôs consistent Oh gotcha. That's info:) yes.  GlobalTimes, known propaganda arm CCP, makes quite skeptical well. Fine. Fuck you. I'll make Europe blackjack hookers. bet find countries map. said another post, mask used social distancing possible. see many masks Asia rural areas. like exit polls 2016. Everybody exiting swing states claimed voted Hillary. either votes magically turned Trump votes deposited ballot box, many polled filthy liars. Occam's razor says latter. pointed 10 billion times, Sweden‚Äôs lockdown been, average, terms reduced mobility. based tracking. may called plans different names, accomplished reduction. experiencing level infection per 1 million residents.

To appeared early, mutated long, impossible, one crucial exception. There's simply way disease transmitting, without evolving, except fringe case disease released, spread widely, samples virus time preserved cold storage, released ten months later Wuhan.

It's fucking unlikely. Let leave that. 

My money contaminated sample irresponsible clickbait reporting. Pence campaigning election. Trump gonna drop polls get low enough. speculation, Trump loooong history cut-N-run shit goes bad. will, already happening. first month alone wrecked us. think go again.

But good job jumping conclusions! tell skip leg day! WaPo article:

""Two nonprofit watchdog groups, Knowledge Ecology International Public Citizen, also documented large taxpayer-funded contributions toward drug. Public Citizen estimates public investment minimum $70 million.""

In specific case COVID, I'd bet nearly public money. 

Source: ...That's stock image. every one. never trusted trust could collapse. US never meant world leader. Shit expensive, often thankless creates enemies. start dropping I'm travel nurse. Texas, Monday usually lowest number new cases. 06/22/20 started 3,280 new cases, thought one heck week. New cases topped 5,996 Thursday. expected Saturday another record breaking high no. people wearing masks, maybe numbers finally trend down.

Stay safe everyone! florida 3-4 weeks ago, went state park picnic tables turned grills covered (despite picnic location like 50 yards apart) end park transitioned beach open air bar packed people. made sense theyd close park picnic benches bar, well money reasons. bare minimum ability act like president Put policy ego.

For moment. went Iraq show dad also big boy president. articles assume virus two outcomes. Death non-death. That‚Äôs totally unscientific. Also it‚Äôs stupid. We're friends, struggling put food table basic need fulfill, contrast wearing mask super easy, barely inconvenience (TM)... I'm microbiologist vaccinating. Careful that. Early this, placed order store pickup (same thing brought car) pulled wrong parts, wrong quantities missed 2 items completely. course mileage may vary based store staff.  brother ICU doc Chicago experience first. People pretty often new procedures place. Yes HCP got sick patients also got sick meetings break room wherever doffing gowns.

 I'm sorry got sick. 25% hospital workers patient care ended antibodies recent study hospital system. seems like everyone team recovered, immunity fewer getting sick now. two weeks non stop. 

For better worse, elective procedures stopped, plenty nurses available ICU.

This morning sent video walking one ""new"" Covid units. **It empty.** patients, nurses. hope Phoenix couple months. then, going wild ride. I'm 32, suppose upper class immigrant Asia. enough stocks happy enough worried night.

Millenials children man, we're getting quite old lol soft-power optics terrible US, great China: ""Look chaos system government leads to.""  


Good thing EU, Taiwan, South Korea Australia got lid without China's authoritarian measures, otherwise would even depressing time individuals like committed liberal government. effectively 3rd world country given crime, corruption poverty. Let's honest, Europe never trusted us world leader. Tell Texas. hot humid, upper 90s day heat index 100. We're getting buttfucked biggest medical complex *world* already capacity ICU. luck 1% scenario. list scratching surface. time list all.  list grows longer evidence every day.  believe me?, search find hundreds more. company, goal make money. think make going risk losing uncomfortable that's decision, probably data back up. much $ make. 

as private citizen, choose fly, know that's choice. Looking across border Canada:

It hit us time. leaders immediately shut shit down, got bad. Provincial leaders final say details, extremely strong national voice. 

There daily briefings Prime Minister provincial heads. coordinated gave similar messaging, different details depending areas responsibility. messaging science based.

We less individualistic culture. Everyone okay stay in. helped got $2000 month gov, plus bunch help small businesses. messaging clear them, mask usage high. idea wearing masks never politicized.

Right start, US looked like complete shit show. Everyone relieved border closed. clear guys going down. Wildly inconsistent messaging leaders, individualistic culture, less educated population, country many people used going doctor unless it‚Äôs really serious. leaders place. Trump denying problem big deal. One largest news stations (Fox) arguing court entertainment news...

Of course people idea do. course didn‚Äôt want anyway. 

Even though countries got hit time, even though cities density size Chicago, per capita, totally flattened curve like third cases per capita guys do.

We stayed home. wore masks. STFU. listened leaders, said thing. even protests too, racism, mask wearing shit down. it‚Äôs fine. family America miss worried them. holy hell. shitshow. ‚ÄúThe cost making drug‚Äù 

What billions Gilead spent R&amp;D discover drug? There‚Äôs way much costs manufacture drug discovered FDA approved. New Zealand February/March really pushing seasonal flu vaccine. sounded bit strange realise flu symptoms COVID simultaneously community cannot tell people go bed rest, assume COVID put people isolation/use quarantine facilities etc. isn‚Äôt necessary. big flu season could break health services simply this.

A big effort late summer vaccinate seasonal flu planned also advertised/educated explain important season. Like unsaid, vicious. all-seeing. Lol. funny say b-movies. I've watching horror pandemic movies lot lately, realized much better endings reality government. Judging personal experience, watching live streams news Switzerland, Austria Germany dont understand english media portraying europe wearing masks prolly should. Germany example made mandatory public transport, austria public transport shopping already rolling back switzerland never made mandatory (in fact personal experience starts slowly grow, today migros \[a local shop\] like 2 10 people wearing masks, instead 1 0.5) poorest households can't afford save invest least small portion income future.

80% live paycheck paycheck 50% stock. Yes, invest small portion want pay rent, buy food, anything else. even save 100$ every often--hich lot poor--are going start caring 1% change every month? articles covering stock prices corporate goings-on aimed people millions invested actually care minor changes? bad veitnam seen 7-10% growth year last decades. OK, maybe I'll make ""could reverse pretty soon"", strongly pessimistic bias.

SARS die natural causes. killed extremely intense public health interventions mainland Chinese cities, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Thailand, Canada elsewhere. involved isolating cases, quarantining contacts, measure ‚Äúsocial distancing,‚Äù intensive efforts. worked well SARS infectious also quite ill distinctive way ‚Äî sick cases transmitters, isolating sick curbed transmission. Toronto, SARS resurged initial wave controlled precautions discontinued. resurgence eventually linked case first wave. resurgence confirms control measures stopped transmission first time.

**Myth 2: ‚Äúcommon cold‚Äù coronaviruses seasonal, little transmission summer, SARS-CoV-2 too.**

Predicting novel virus behave based others behave always speculative, sometimes little else go on. first problem myth don‚Äôt know whether coronaviruses, go evocative names like OC43, HKU1, 229E, NL63, good analogies virus. Still, worth considering analogy especially OC43 HKU1, SARS-CoV2‚Äôs closest relatives among seasonal coronaviruses. reason myth seasonal viruses population long time (like OC43 HKU1) behave differently viruses newly introduced population.

**This leads us last point: Even seasonal infections happen ‚Äúout season‚Äù new.**

The consequence new viruses ‚Äî like pandemic influenza ‚Äî spread outside normal season longer-established cousins. example 2009, pandemic started April-May (well outside flu season), quieted summer (perhaps importance children transmission flu), rebounded September-October, start normal flu season. Seasonality constrain pandemic viruses way old ones. pattern common flu pandemics. vaccines based past coronavirus vaccine

You're making incorrect assumptions something far complex nuanced understand, frankly, putting ton effort responding every post related topic. stop. Wishing taken page Vietnam‚Äôs playbook....

Still worth get vaccine, though. Hold on, allergy medicine helps sleep? need start taking then. towners coming many states away sure cause woes.

The beaches stay open, restaurants bars closed except curb side pick picnic sets. Grocery stores open require mask.

(Sorry, mind wondered there) mean, YMMV. gym least something, aren't. Things gyms response corona: employees required wear masks, class sizes limited, water fountains turned off. That's it. mask requirements customers. amenities open. Capacity monitored, let alone regulated. temperatures taken.

Personally, went gym use hot tub weeks back, saw literally precautions taken, got cussed wearing mask conspiracy theorist, promptly cancelled membership I'd crazy naive go back right now. believe headlines

hmm pretend problem exist: SOLVED!! would straight landlord. tested positive, can‚Äôt around people. needs extra week two avoid infecting anybody. doesn‚Äôt work, would ask even could one else supervise move. millenial american. millenials low voting attendance rate? never thought way. work medical office annually re-trained HIPPA protecting patient PHI, never applied US work place. one co-workers flu, told us work close asked watch fever, etc. never thought question flaw work place? event, seems pandemic would wise withhold name due diligence trace likely exposed. Running government like business work even without crisis. want everyone get paid safe.

Me feel like landlords sometimes dont see eventually come point gotta stop demonizing tenants inability pay start knocking white house door force.

It's even that, think.

What landlords want is, like everyone else, get paid least amount work possible.

You know what's lot work? Evicting tenants, turning unit, advertising unit, showing unit, running applicants, choosing applicants, moving in, etc.

You know what's easy? Getting check current tenant. Maybe minor maintenance fixes.

In ideal universe, things would continued usual. that's happening.

In better universe, government would step help tenants pay rent. Tenants get stay units. Landlords get paid. Life moves something approximating good.

In worse universe, tenants get evicted. Tenants suffer trying find new housing. Landlords suffer vacant units work gets getting new tenants (if any). sucks.

In absolute universe (for landlords), tenants pay still work required landlords.

And that's piece legislation falls in.  worry. Currently we're allowed herd certain restrictions (staying away settlements etc) really influence lifestyle much, they're pretty close would anyway.
We 100% understand Norwegians, they're scared us bringing virus along, we're scared bringing virus community, traveling. could supported herd home, would probably skipped year's season, order we'd kill half stock, imagine we're trying hardest kill single reindeer without reason true. hardest kind racism deal kind feel person though such. even know say.

The mental gymnastics knows bounds Correct. question ""is Florida fucked."" question ""is Florida going worse New York.""

10k deaths still leaves well ahead NY, especially per capita.

It's stupid compare NY lot reasons, people insist it, accurate. real comparison would happened *no outbreak all*. Right, clinical trial see drug effective. even quoted part said clinical trial.

It's batshit insane can't get info hospital paying/giving insurance. ‚ÄúThere people dying faster ability test,‚Äù Without unlimited testing available, families burying loved ones without knowing cause death COVID-19 related ‚ÄúI test resources available that,‚Äù Jernigan said. ‚ÄúSo family left knowing person died COVID-19 whether heart attack.

These also often excluded studies limited knowledge types cases. No, anything, number displayed low.

BUT - case, saying ""hospitalizations deaths still dropping"" shows serious misunderstanding numbers work.

Note: I'm talking Florida specifically. know dropping places, article FL there, COVID still Exactly right. tell literally everyone know plan ""where party"" shut bars restaurants again. Lake houses, people pools huge back yards, people pools. Stay home business closing orders useless point. could shut cardio machines it'd lot safer. people breathing hard sweating can't safe. could go there, quick 1/2 hour weights it'd perfect. mask even get way. I'm aware fact mild asymptomatic cases occur frequently, there's doubt many, many cases flying radar. point (from understand) vaguest idea ratio really is. could 3:1 5:1 10:1 even higher, theory. assuming 10:1 based antibody assay results seems premature me, given little know body's immune response virus. 

I think may over-optimistic estimate true case number 10x higher, I've already seen discussions media seem downplay virulence COVID-19 overhype possibility reaching herd immunity. Given little know virus point, understanding constantly rapidly evolving, think bit caution humility warranted. theaters old...hence small. Broadway special it‚Äôs small intimate. Large theaters lose certain feeling can‚Äôt explained. 

I think Toronto all, commenting great think Toronto theater. Nothing more. 

I understand expectations though remember even sports stadiums small compared global football arenas. Like racism, adultery, lying cheating? least everyone else learned eventually painful experience; south same? think confusing 401k social security. insanely doomsday this, 401k money. non apocalyptic thing gov could would remove tax benefits.

.... past month, number new cases doubled... keep mind ‚ÄúPlease believe numbers, fact, it‚Äôs worse numbers,‚Äù Jernigan said.

For sure. Sadly sides rough spot right now. ""T"" coo coo ""B"" candidate dems need. Sanders hand much integrity (imo, meaning hes gonna actually says play lip service) well liked non progressive dems indeps.

If ""B"" tries shift back status quo re-instate things like Obamacare tbh deeply flawed anyone without pre-existing conditions, rep base might become re-invigorated next elec.

At point felt like Sander's stubbornness thing shot addressing insanity America's healthcare system. surprised still lived overpriced, heavily lobbied, insurance-tied-to-job based system post 2030, absolutely 0 changes.

Edit: Thought funny ""T"" ""tried"" negotiate pharma back 2017 made instant 180. ""B"" even gonna negotiate, that's sure.

Just thoughts. reference models data. said word data comment.

We even way identifying idiots go Sweden party lift metal. mean, inside Sweden. educate them? Make 12 month programme meantime Ok reinfecting? 

If Sweden closes border, solved right away, best solution.

When kid 5 taking visit family US, made sure vaccinations date chicken pox parties hit. bringing kid former third world country US protect diseases nearly eradicated. SMH.. Regardless, time sun rays inside house/office/building... Every day wake wish cat. Somewhat careful. That's great, want slap phone. feel like state late game reopening early May, lead increase cases early June? time wise increase cases exactly 2-3 weeks protests. Florida - watching Ron DeSaster like B movie close. It‚Äôs like actually scary, grade horror film! Feeling less less comfortable time goes on, tell ya... Actually 72 hourd always hear GYna assume he‚Äôs also working misogyny / fear women spread SARS-CoV-2 difficult predict understand. Diamond Princess cruise ship, example, virus likely spread relatively freely air-conditioning system linking cabins, 20% passengers crew infected. Data military ships cities Stockholm, New York London also suggest infections around 20% ‚Äì much lower earlier mathematical models led speculation whether population achieve sort immunity virus little 20% infected ‚Äì proportion well widely accepted herd immunity threshold (60-70%).

There recent article talking infection rates jails one prison like 80% inmates actively infected antibodies. get got covid Vax (or medically exempt) ID cards, let businesses require card (not businesses would want check maybe cool hair salon favorite pub will). fly tomorrow United... fuck. informed job hospital.

There's harm admitting that. car needs mechanic, I'd hope know do.

I want people knowledgeable work lay person.

It's knock. know job. I'd terrible job knew less. husband different job knows loads job less mine. *covfefe verizon I'm locked 6GB month package get throttled allow stream full HD. dropped went unlimited I'd get throttled HD streaming much want pointless can't get need. another note - can't keep things like forever ya gotta go back it. TY perspective. Sadly product Florida public school education.  Dr. Fauci, Surgeon General CDC said Americans need masks. right get bought shipped did. Goddamn south full complete idiots. I‚Äôd say even way then. Let‚Äôs forget Raegan fucked people. beloved founding fathers owned enslaved people. Nixon. Etc. on. ‚ÄúAn empty vessel makes loudest noise‚Äù

The minority seems getting heard ones politicians want please. don‚Äôt think ‚Äúunpopular decisions‚Äù unpopular. Many people US agree masks keep us safe closing things down. don‚Äôt fear concerned constituents protest death, would responsible them. Instead placate protest able go sit order 3 $10 Chili‚Äôs. No.

The prediction bad.

All nothing. It‚Äôs 12-13% majority week. Seblantics ‚ô°  China mask recommendation start, stuck it.

While US telling us buy use masks, China ignoring advice, buying entire domestic supply, sending back China.

Mark word, go biggest public health policy failure modern times. Trump, Fauci Surgeon General starring roles Harvard Kennedy School case study. world reopening, see explosion cases. said another post, medical establishment takes time change well-established protocols. digest data, discuss it, debate it, usually come new directives quite late. 

For instance, knew digestive form COV19 three months ago. *last week* CDC included list COV19 qualifying symptoms. millenials (or Gen Z, whatever choose call themselves) realize much stuff happened financially caused parents grandparents generations, Baby Boomers?

There's *nothing Wrong* younger people living parents, even short while.

It's American mentality shame people countries (Europe esp. Asia) *Multi-generational* households considered '*normal*'? quite thing. example - hospital permanent residents. patients eat rooms. We're upheld certain compliances state federal levels residential care facilities obligated meet help us maintain higher level safety. 

This outbreaks nursing homes hospitals. 

But, corporate entity sets visitation policy. administrative decision allow visitation recommendation ID department. 

It's important confuse permitted safe do. 

My hospital returning visitor restriction policy we're relieved so. We're waiting approval corporate office proceeding. cannot come soon enough. thanks Mrs. Trump. That's crazy. Everybody went school came making least 60-70 like 6 years ago lol. mostly around STEM people.  Welcome supply-side heaven. Unfortunately main seats taken passengers came you. apologize inconvenience required honor ""reservations"" per terms conditions (you read died? typical).

If 400 gold pieces, get seat immediately first class. Otherwise, need wait Limbo eternities find spot. - oh - Mr. Bezos! - welcome thank business! .... (you're still here?) Please follow signs Limbo call thank you! Literally everything, it‚Äôs impressive awful thing butchered get go Oh sorry didnt mean say might find pathetic like ""one might"" :) 

And yes course, little tourism better tourism, seems quite gamble save much possible letting tourists restrictions - Spain doing. mean something fishy happened anyway, really weird drop numbers suddenly deaths anymore (If compare Spain Italy example). guess really ask tourists worth higher risk, want call criticism without economic background data. agree stimulus, without loosening chokehold necessary service monopolies working class stimulus really bailout wealthy. said ""mainly"" everyone doesnt. person posting earlier griping many wear masks inside gym? Cause post really highlighted said.

I personally think making mistake can't stop you. can't wait see videos Reddit 5th July.  funny thing cant go border cheaper prescription drugs now! bring BLM sign Obviously I'm speaking generally. gyms strict controls mitigate risk, fine. Well country sort leadership could banned sale n95s anyone professionals.

Either way, become apparent lying public masks terrible idea. Yes, Siesta key gorgeous far beaches go. It‚Äôs favorite terms sand water quality. 

But lot all-day fun Clearwater beach even Honeymoon Island (which got one best dog friendly beaches States).

Last summer got late start, couldn‚Äôt park Siesta beach. settle Turtle, never heard prior day. actually really liked weird gray sand. Haha I've literally showed actual studies show differences differences mutations SARS-COV2 appear affect infectivity months ago. documented cases viral load decreasing Italy. last week paper published warning people contracted Wuhan strain may protected vaccine due mutations spike protein.

As said, there's solid evidence, merits investigation. trend seen countries .

And, saying stuff make true. No, people visible symptoms isolate way people severe ones. Yeah, point lame duck, wasn‚Äôt he. Nothing left prove guess. 

I hate guts think painting stupid dog portraits prison. curious what's job title certificates skills would recommend learn wrote long reply examples sources, since moderators believe stating social distancing effective wearing mask rules, removed. 


Maybe take discussion somewhere else arguments, facts, science mean popularity? someone pay advice tells suggesting, fire immediately. go well /s. was.

America basically ignored it. US government said masks needed. Dr. Fauci, CDC, Surgeon General - said Americans need masks.

China Asia needed PPE, actually using yet spun manufacturing. America plenty sale, people asked overseas friends relatives buy things send back, whic did. 

There's conspiracy. Simply basic market economics supply demand work. Hi u/icouldntdecide. Tommy here! good think confront: really persuade everyone?

Nice try Fauci Yeah really shit

The Patient Protection Affordable Care Act reduced number Americans without health insurance 20 million. passed 2009/2010 certain specific majorities* congress signed certain specific president. barely survived overturned 2017 specific opposing party.

Okay wow im terrified shaking mask kinky boots. chance become instructor nursing college? maybe get job university student health clinic? Either one would physically less taxing hospital nursing, would get back good retirement plan. fact is, big chunk population idiots/misinformed/have poor judgement, etc. that‚Äôs leadership important. Ideally president influence idiots behave responsibly.

Ridiculous 

Go Home Found Trumpanzee. mean ""supersized credit""?

My family owns decent sized rental property business we've looking buy something 60-120 unit range next year two, prices apartment complexes really moved. Apartments primarily driven rental income really budged. get outliers like NYC San Francisco appreciation king, majority complexes much income bring in. SEE BILLY AGANS Ok stay inside then? useless society. That's fair, there's difference disproving controlled China saying every mistake made white man, op both. Sorry thought also talking FL.

Lots people learn hard way CoV. bad many people paying price arrogance ignorance. big box stores, Lowe's, Menards, Target, grocery stores restaurants, fast food chains never fully shut MO. Target, Lowe's Menards packed max whole ""quarantine"", food curbside drive thru like month damn near fully reopened. places required masks one wears them.

I'm Scottish, recognise World made isolated countries, interlinked many ways, essential work unison.

The UK, Italy, France etc. messed up, Sweden USA maybe given 1st World status pretend attest have.

I would agree communications always clear, get comments like ""there evidence support"" actually evidence support it.

The states article:-

""GENEVA (Reuters) - World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday ***there need measures ‚Äúunnecessarily interfere international travel trade‚Äù*** trying halt spread coronavirus killed 361 people China.""

They say said unless think necessary, i.e. decision time, evidence support is/isn't necessary.

Then:-

‚ÄúWe call countries ***implement decisions evidence-based consistent,***‚Äù Tedros told executive board, reiterating message last week declared ***international emergency***\*\*.\*\* ""

Seemed pretty clear leader country, soon International Emergency declared would started making sure degree preparedness happening, focusing Brexit, Golf, Tea, re-erection whatever.

I would started battening hatches getting prepared. thought close borders would, would me, WHO.

This covered 100 years ago, proud say foreign tourists far important source income Italy,

foreign tourism actually accounts 2% GDP. Fingers crossed
The council called us careful, since S√°mi travel lot live small, closely knit, communities hygiene always high cities (hard stay sterile Lavvo) 

I'm degree ok people seeing us ""strange artefact time long past"" degree that's are. could happly turn 100 years old without told Halloween, wear G√°kti everyday life, without hearing children family called Lapj√§rvel classmates teachers anything stop it. wonder country ‚Äúopen‚Äù business. essential, others (gyms, bars, hair&amp;nail salons) required CLOSE DOWN. Obviously government capabilities world keep said businesses going under. USA mess. sure better trump hope fight Obamacare LET BODIES HIT FLOOR guys smart money bought bottom 18 day bear market.

Giant ass joke markets rigged. get sentiment, stupid... pepper spraying would trigger cough uncontrollably right back you... I'm pretty sure punishing someone coughing making cough wise response, lol. would legs numb? sound typical. Staff member shot killed asking customer wear mask ..early May/2020 ...   AC That's insanity. damn knew picked woodworking!! Y'know...I read studies China myself. concerned late December, warned family. Anyone symptoms (fever, cough, spreading germs akin Flu spread) given mask. March. standard protocol, protocols take time implemented.  Teaching children part parenting.  farmed convenience. 

Time figure make happen UK envious American freedumbs! Bullshit. live Germany, right border Belgium Netherlands. Border controls lifted people still wearing masks public indoor space, three countries. Outdoor different story, we're still practicing ""social distancing"" see exactly masks became mandatory Netherlands, daily new cases chart. know, equal enough robust irrational decisions single leader. makes sense would stop refunding single country examples thinking Iran, Yemen, Venezuela. Well, agree disagree Expressen frankly bit *confused* NY Times / Pro Publica level journalism ends alongside absolute garbage. 



Ugh, yeah re: Danish tabloids. mean British tabloids still girls thing tbh Danes last planet that's roll world changes mark words they're gonna dig harder one. *sense* kind endearing.

But yea, go ahead keep money savings account let value drop time due inflation. Big Brain. feel like close sort conclusion grocery stores provide valuable goods price reflecting labor put growing making food - whereas part landlords handed massive check work.

I understand landlords things like arrange repairs file paperwork, there's reason called ""passive income"" - labor actually basically function middleman renters repairpeople getting paid 30% income it. 

If farmer forced provide food free would keep *farming* hard time consuming labor every day. Sad say I'm hoping gop able save us

lol usual, refuse try see point party making, toss aside ""just trolling"".

:) genuinely wondering. point become masks longer requirement? Agreed! normally curbside groceries, morning go Publix grab item unavailable curbside location. 100% mask usage. honestly surprised.

Remember incur capital gains tax re-balancing portfolio 401k accounts. advantage keeping money there.

My take need money, certainly take .. may even little bit cushion, certainly everything to. 

The piece advice wait little see. believe rule penalty anything year. so, still months decide longer term strategy.

So big question trust? Major news publications set editorial standards stick to, explain correct stick them. good principles knowing stand news source, think pretty important. encountering new source, [First Draft checklist things check remember acronym SHEEP.

I'm refuting statement. covid serious numbers dropping. they're many places, like FL. Country roads, take home 

To place, belong!

West Virginia, ‚Äòrona country

Take home, country roads Agree. I'm public schools they're going remote, let's give parents choices. Agreed 35 old? Yes. masks worn properly walk cloud pure virus get infected. Hopefully they'll send bill flight back associated costs... There's still like 13% positivity rate, less testing done weekends looks like numbers lower. Im 17.Im gonna graduate next year.How fucked i? Even HIPAA apply, people didn‚Äôt actual diagnosis wouldn‚Äôt protected Doesnt surprise me, drugs cost high six figures year, rest life.

Edit: google Sovaldi. 

Also Gilead. going tsunami change, think going right long run. 

The teachers family saying may never again. Looking species failed react immediately pressing viral crisis like COVID-19 makes resigned fact never tackle climate change crisis (which far slower far-reaching timescale) meaningful manner. know also people travel italy sweden uk spend even minute quarantine.

Tourism surely plays important role countries think part story.
In general resuming travel Schengen means going back normal. when? find vaccine?

A little known fact travel italy lockdown. lockdown travel EU allowed business trips need test quarantine traveller would leave 3 days. special treatment leisure trips. place lifting lockdown. tourists would want go could unless would spend 14 days quarantine government facility actually destroying vacation. locals could go restaurants bars.

So obviously trying say countries care tourism. course do. course push open. course willing take risks tourists.

But general allow internal EU travel need admit uave resume vaccine. late. tourism, economies general. nowhere argument suddenly popping everywhere. Hannity segment new York assisted living facilities something? seems new big whataboutism Thank catch Gyms still closed there‚Äôs vaccine. see books? know they‚Äôre well? see people getting takeout doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre well.

They still overhead. still bills. They‚Äôre likely making fraction normally make. Probably scraping best.

You‚Äôre one people hasn‚Äôt effected all, telling business owners ‚Äúadapt‚Äù watch everything worked get taken away.

Once again. effect you? effect life? working home collecting unemployment? know it‚Äôs one two, it? vaccine end year, making concrete plans kill cannot flee US. fucking way without vaccine, bad options. know sound radical now, viewpoint become common knowledge fall hits. brutal season suffering life know effectively over. grieving there's still food shelves.  According media tells you... sure. one sided. I'm sorry, cannot tell protesting safe ok one article tell people unsafe going beach another need stay inside. exactly sites weeks. governor announcing Wednesday whether go back minimal social distancing, moderate social distancing, online learning, hybrid. position stay home kids unless something miraculous happens I'll homeschooling. hopeful reopen, despite statewide mask mandate already stated optional kids. Also, kids temperature taken getting bus parents ""say okay"". doesnt inspire confidence. I'm getting near people, took mile rugged end trail nobody without modified 4x4 getting. Ill take roadside pics though next time I'm there, use area beyond puddle jumper area testing area Jeep. think so. Also ‚ÄúStupidity, like virtue, reward‚Äù. What's bugging lately we've ignored informing people covid outcomes death vs perfectly healthy recovery. many people ages getting stuck long term lung damage everyone thinks young people dying Gucci. 

Catching covid fuck life even kill you. youth force field wolverine-like healing ability. Let's hope Trump re-elected start fixing childs mess.  I'd honestly like know individual tell fellow employees / friends already impacting him/her. don‚Äôt want lose everything government decided people longer need pay rent. happens landlord foreclose one wants buy complex one paying rent? proved American. 12:59.  hate mask mandates much next person applaud making positive decision. even need mandates sign eroding civil liberties sign _failed leadership_. dozens strategies leaders use encourage behavior change preserving liberty barely tried anything. I'm kinda mad everyone stayed inside shut could awesome 4th july weekend noooooo. Karen roots done.

Your 60! 3 times divorced! one cares look like! Perhaps species deserves fail. would say 50% people wear masks wife's store (its mandatory) noses exposed time checkout.

I suppose facemask covers mouth better nothing, would imagine effectiveness significantly reduced people letting masks slip noses. wow. another huge bill. Oh yeah cause everyone 6 days vacation driving aspect. even include actual visit. Hi u/debt-free-dad \- David here! agree reasoning decision science one part broader phenomenon misinformation, would argue really essential element. Proposed technological solutions, instance, frought difficulties (a ""fake news warning"" social networks shown actually increase people's susceptibility certain misinformation, instance). Ultimately, want empower people improve understanding misinformation, need understand suscpetible.

I would say though, Tommy look disciplines too! book, instance, examines neuroscience, sociology education, attempts improve digital literacy - conclusions often complement findings ""pure"" decision science. [Banning bump meaningless grand scheme things, step right direction. Excuse two talking about? That's article SVT, Swedish public broadcaster. pretty natural Swedish public broadcaster would reporting consequences virus Swedish tourism.

The angle claiming they're taking -- Sweden uniquely affected -- entirely absent original article. imagined yourselves. Seriously must best week ever.

""Oh, I'm buy anything, looking something do."" respiratory viruses *do* follow seasonal pattern northern southern states. Look flu statistics given flu year see high activity virus elevated reporting ILI north south. elevated levels universally disappear north south, meaning factors beyond outside prevent spread. Otherwise see uptick cases southern states hottest months.

With said, mentioned - people outside north less south - definitely contributing patterns seeing now. However, ill-defined aspects summer beyond social changes contribute decreased spread viruses. heard theories increased moisture air leads mucus airways making harder respiratory viruses get need go cause infection indoor yes finally learning? Bunch dumbasses every last one em. gotta gold ish baby :). Thanks laugh! Anybody insults gets online diagnosis narcissism. careful! online doctors get you. Managing properties job friend risk, big risk. taking lot granted. hospital employee, feel really conflicted.

We absolutely need reduce spread masks proven way achieve that. mandates increase compliance.

However, really need shut down.

You think shutdown targeting small business you? main reason Swedish economy taking hit rest world locked down, effectively freezing - possibly destroying - world economy.

But me, economics. also dispruptive destructive effects lockdowns caused continue cause well future. Many untested proven efficacy.

Your abject failure see even open eyes possibility could balanced approach global scale baffling.

So try shoehorn one-sided myopic little argument. said countless times, entirely pointless. like dog chasing tail. Even lower since n95 surgical mask right never successful vaccine coronavirus. town talking set daycare programs remote schooling days. different kids go school, idea. Oh great I'm glad couple hundred dollars per month taken somebody earning work final release always higher recent average US. People reading air travel currently working also pretty good. Lots blame go around.

First personal responsibility. Tough concept many including adults, millennials. actually nobody needs look USA understand bad is, USA need look around learn fix shit. B-dawg directly opposed socialized medicine said public statement would actively veto it. They're looking possibly available moment. mean evidence may encourage testing BCG hypothesis. initial point, replied to. BCG hypothesis deduction-driven hypothesis dozens others.
Similar HCQ. Another ""deduction"" caused spectacular waste time. need another one. Interesting. seems like would hard scale.  everyone says person, happens? still is.

I'm currently one people paying NYC prices continue to. amazing parts NYC return, dont mind seeing fewer ""Just Salads"" midtown. 

The people dont like leave. rest us stay build something new. ""All local requirements abided .... 

Is anyone else noting increase line thought lately? Essentially many businesses running events falling crutch following bare minimum requirements, despite knowing virus spreads bare minimum requirements even meet guidelines prevent spread (i.e. guidelines definition optional enforceable). used crutch justify abhorrent behavior puts everybody increased risk. Ugh... what's discouraging there's nothing rational people it. Jesus came back murdered him. fuck (except 20 years part) even though know US flawed almost miracle still functioning still feel weird wanting leave think something ""usa best "" ""were country freedom"" drilled skull government teachers since kid honestly I'd almost say way we're taught USA almost borderline propaganda I'm making comfortable living early 20s degree music performance teaching code. want $$ get youtube/google get learning, there's nothing stopping you. sounds good Thank taking time ama, field interesting especially modern communication tools seem hard time adjusting society. great job!

How many people? selection criteria subjecrs? Specificity/sensitivity test? test known collisions coronaviruses? samples screened, validated second test? confidence interval? new president inaugurated military new CiC, secret service new boss. serve new president.

How possible suspends consitution prior inaguration day? saying going it, wondering statement jives reality constitutional text. saying would actions, extrapolating hypothetical scenario based events already happened united states' history.

You read constitution, right? God. piece filth Tbh, that's pretty high India. go hand hand. best possible thing could done economy get virus control quickly possible could *actually* reopen somewhat safely. half assed lockdown early reopening worst worlds. ~~wants~~ afford test get one economy well relies tourists. Can‚Äôt pee ocean like normal people?  Strange nearly everyone thinks viral immunity nothing. Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing, OMG we're 85% problem solved!! IT!


5% means 1 20 longer carry pass disease. 15% means 6 20, on... 


It EXPECTED places got slammed early better time goes on... still answer question one said everyone dies it. literally 100,000 deaths short amount time still going on. prudent thing limit travel necessary respect around underlying conditions. start yelling shark! way close beaches 4th July. ""To protect serve."" ain't shit. Jeff Bridges scene Newsroom may 100% accurate, still truth. rested greatness, reset world caught up. dunno; hair getting kinda wild now....

I swung barber's see open. amazed *were*, wanted sign paperwork waiver COVID mess another form contact tracing. crazy second one especially, find way. could monster.

Or could paycheck away losing everything want risk let go.

I wish article clear systemic reasons people might motivated work sick. It‚Äòs simple. Murdoch media. Destroying reason dividing people rich decades. Still better job Cuomo. bad all. sucks 50% capacity lol living $500 mortgage property $3000 rent?

If real numbers actual moron complain continuing pay landlord $2500 difference could buy house yourself, definitely could paying $3000/mo. made pretty serious specific allegations. 

As said, I've looking evidence quite time I've come empty handed. Since seem sure position fair ask makes sure. properties job

Like said, far landlord *actual labor* think paid. factually wrong suggest majority income coming actual labor. case referred investing, form ""passive income"". called couple hours month per place they're getting thousands thousands dollars handed big risk.

What's risk? Becoming poor renters are? work real job living, live apartment somebody else owns? horror. Either way think people rewarded *work* ""risk"". heavy breathing, definitely, there‚Äôs evidence indicate virus spreads perspiration. That‚Äôs hospice/hospital situation. Ball bag 

Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôm sure someone whip govt run nursing home first chance die rotting bed sores. Bye bye. No, they‚Äôre filling ICU. older people folks pre-existing conditions.

Cases gone amongst 20-30 year olds, idea they‚Äôre ‚Äúfilling ICUs‚Äù flat lie.

But hey, keep spinning narrative.

We shut society never go right? find disturbing people dumb afford live Orange County know sure, sure hell likely. /u/ravend13 /u/mbattagl completely motivated post salacious topics feeds ego. always right post comments substance called out.

why find okay make baseless accusations (even appear correct paper) president find revolting talk like neighbor? actually care we're going substitute president every person like country. believe me? look right treated obama tenure.

please hear plea: stop. obvious president leader, neither you. stop. cares mind, move on. focus election without resorting character attacks.

oh kidding, bring downvotes. wOrSt PrEsIdEnT eVaR, amirite???  got nothing folks attend college. Pretty sure time $3k/semester x2 $6k/yr grants plus books etc plus living expenses costs certainly gone worked ass pay it. addition working summer breaks worked +30 hours weekend restaurant would often pick night janitor positions spending money.

So kind lightly touched before, exactly type thing that‚Äôs possible today. Working weekends nights simply enough pay college anymore, even state tuitions. ‚ÄúWorking ass off‚Äù isn‚Äôt enough anymore. *After* adjusting inflation, average price undergrad increased ~161% since 1987. average part time salary applied full average cost tuition four years, there‚Äôs still $20,000 debt left over. context, average cost state tuition (the cheapest option!) range $4000 $30k depending state student lucky enough (or unlucky enough) born into, students best they‚Äôre looking 4 times annual tuition was. top that, average salaries fields kept percentage increase, meaning even graduating takes many years pay debt. say denigrate anyone‚Äôs accomplishments - working hard pay college super admirable opinion. trying demonstrate massive amount student debt today really can‚Äôt attributed lack trying laziness student‚Äôs behalf.

It‚Äôs true society doesn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúowe‚Äù people free education (although could definitely fall ‚Äúpursuit happiness‚Äù part). citizen‚Äôs also aren‚Äôt entitled infrastructure, like roads, postal service. There‚Äôs plenty things aren‚Äôt ‚Äúlife, liberty, pursuit happiness‚Äù government designed provide net benefit everyone, education definitely fits bill that. Encouraging people become doctors, engineers, scientists, etc incredibly important advancing society‚Äôs interests, improving quality life everyone, keeping country competitive global level. start placing many barriers entry fields, could snowball truly disastrous ways, like physician shortage crisis currently facing America. even though free education isn‚Äôt fundamental right, still think it‚Äôs idea worth supporting. Yeah man fucking sucks. Lots coughing involved agree, hell bit hyperbole. positive rate current testing percentile low enough escalate general testing. It‚Äôs math, logics, statistics 101. pic mile two people, trail nothing lifted getting into. use area test new Jeep mods make sure fuck work myself...like wheels falling new adjustable control arms snapping lol. I've spent entirety lockdown social distancing trails totally ruined anyway need shut couple months, many people community (staff &amp; customers) fall ill virus? study specific, dominant mutation spike protein generic properties virus. Well still go occasionally don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm bonkers so. 

Buuuuut, gym small town fitness center go, always person there. actually never go see another car there. hardly ever happens though. There‚Äôs probably 2-3 people total since January 2nd. think anti-vaxxers dumbest people earth. know lot people anti-vaxxers going hold vaccine. 

It's entirely reasonable skeptical fast-tracked vaccine. cases spent decade developing testing said vaccine completely unreasonable.

I particularly personal stance I've already coronavirus. antibodies long-lasting I'll take vaccine. decking screws. decking planks. state quarantine 7 days get test, it‚Äôs negative stop quarantining  accept risk, assume everyone else going gyms accepts well. ""protecting"" people already deemed training public space worth risk. act like saint going lmao Planet Fitness opened near me, pretty sure didn‚Äôt offer shower facilities keep costs down. idea that‚Äôs changed, found whole idea disgusting. she‚Äôs diabetic, demented, cardiac failure, twenty different meds need critical monitoring let‚Äôs talk. even point map Come New York, let‚Äôs keep curve down! think media‚Äôs propensity sensationalism politicization news could cause people mistrust told COVID-19? ‚Äúconspiracy theories‚Äù result general lack credibility media ‚Äúexperts‚Äù? make wear astronaut type helmets, good beaches Florida remain open. What??? Oh no! They‚Äôre going close beach prevent spread contagion? inalienable rights spread disease want. Nuuu, pandemic containment literally authoritarianism! /S üôÑ ...and also GOP trying include indemnification lawsuits virus next ""stimulus"" bill. succeed getting in, employer able require return work even though dangerous, refusing could mean effectively ""quit"" job, meaning compensation, severance, unemployment you. Cheese rice! fucking shithead! problem, Asian feel obligated correct math error also people say ""going start garden"", buy one pot tomato plant, forget it, dies June, never eat single tomato.

But point... lot could. things can't. Daycare problem working parents. gave parents back school taxes, could adjusted well. assault battery then. still pursue it.

Edit: actually, probably still battery anyway. Seasonal flu still follows patterns rest country even warmer states though. dog ultrasound, blood test got stacks medications cost same.

Oh, wait, *you're discussing people??* Thank AMA. happens area I'm much interested studying last couple years.

My thesis (cognitive linguistic analysis Alt-right discourse) led tentatively conclude ideology (as motivated social cognition) manifests cognitive heuristics result ""biased thinking"" (eg believing misinformation).

QUESTION: extent, any, research suggest motivated reasoning plays part explaining people fall specific types misinformation?

Thanks AMA.
(Edit: many words) Post hoc ergo propter hoc. USA USA USA

We're #1! mean that's kinda people choosing allegiant haha choose airline requires one filling plane Outdoors block party much preferred indoors bar activity kind right now. Alpha gen golden then. certainly wonder certain people (you know who. Naming labeled purely political bots) would issue US immigrants Europe had/have African/Arabian countries.

It would pretty ironic large movement US ""back"" Europe. former colonies fought hard independence back former Kings.  That‚Äôs point lol OMG, yes, completely! feel like I'm taking crazy pills person still using curbside everything. hate like 16 spots Lowes always empty. Meanwhile, wait patiently bring stuff out, see hordes maskless people even attempting social distance. Sounds like concept caring elderly think families manage it. live Florida NO-ONE taking seriously. doomed.

My father holding volleyball open gyms faking temperatures thermometer. general problem though reasonable, unselfish, community minded people, ones wear masks they're entitled pricks, ones usually go shoot people. That's interesting teachers family see that. teachers know think public ok indefinitely funding remote schooling.  95% Americans 65?!? 

I‚Äôm gonna stop right bother reading anything else say you‚Äôre dumb. God's sake. many people stupid?! can't take anymore Yup. Agree everything. walked gym day one first thought ‚ÄúThere reason couldn‚Äôt along‚Äù.

I felt less safe ‚Äúessential‚Äù grocery store gym.

And agree. felt great gym. workouts quarantine shit mental toll immense.

I felt better soon finished first workout. I'm answering OPs question, he's one money maybe ask him? better treatment protocols younger people ones likely get sick now. Wear masks. Wash/sanitize hands. Social distancing. Virus fighting 101. That‚Äôs saying. may directly shares exposure market via pension fund basic etf fund That's what's infuriating - learn painful experience. said death, know, America could applied lessons Europe instead going ourselves. AL (and TX, FL, etc) could applied lessons NY NJ avoid painful experience, they're going go themselves. fucking dumb. Thank service Nope. way stating one keep perspective ""hell"" global pandemic. know! Whodda thunk it?! People can‚Äôt spend money they‚Äôre sick dying. So. time worry got first case.

But didn‚Äôt build testing infrastructure (did even test kits worked early March??), contact tracing... didn‚Äôt even take temperatures airport. 

The answer isn‚Äôt fuck it, going screw economy also result massive deaths. answer demand zero accountability leadership mattered. 

There REASON handling worse South Korea Vietnam. worst failure leadership I‚Äôve seen life. meth Texas. know like everyone dies right? Haha like y'all saying second make eye contact gonna keel die Yeah, would quarantine visiting them. couldn‚Äôt live got me. pre-surveyed parents 57% said would send kid campus.  doubt much movement towards person given poorly TX government handled things. Honestly best news heard awhile state. apply convention Ya good luck enforcing that... Lol chinese bootlickers comments..very amusing AC? mine fans resemble helicopters upside network engineer. studied Networking Hardware local community college back 2014ish (I afford 4 year schools). graduating, pursued Cisco CCNA certification. two credentials have. planning earn next Cisco cert - CCNP - year. Lots jobs offer salaries excess 90k CCNP holder experience. live Ohio well quite low cost living.

That said, lot demand fields - networking, Windows admin, database admin, VOIP (phone) people, security experts, development/programming whole additional set jobs degrees. say encourage - lot people hate programming, hate Windows, hate networking - techy person almost certainly something you. really poor logic. individual go beach without going restaurant bar next door. # means theyre coming beaches weekend

me living SC: fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck  guy, HIPAA. LOL Name, shame, lifetime ban local bars. issue hospitals billing practices, actually nothing insurance cover.

You bill insurance 1,000, 1,000,000. get paid same, negotiated rate based similar claims paid jurisdiction (usually based state) listen to? virus might weakening? listen yourself?  Remember, can‚Äôt 15k cases day shit testing!!!!!

It‚Äôs Florida way! surprised. done offtopic? Humans come virus. What? Jk never mind Northeast looking pretty good. Fingers crossed hold celebrate early. hospital ship New York could sail straight in, order happen they'd admit there's problem first place... US that‚Äôs effectively sentence poor bankrupt. people wear masks outside time (though 50%-60%) (this also varies borough). vast majority wear indoor spaces, really matters. FINALLY. took:

2.6 million cases

127,000 American Deaths

for Vice President finally say wear mask. many take president says camera? ton articles recent 3 days ago show appreciable spread protests. think lot fact outdoors, many localities protesters wearing masks. least vast majority were.

Just Google ""COVID-19 protests"" list articles. many include links here.

My uncles live Houston, quick decry protests source spike. present ton data, like another reply mentioned, much attributable frankly, restaurants bars opening soon states never properly sheltered place long enough simply reduce pool infected people kind reopening feasible. co-workers booked vacations South Carolina last week mid July. try effectively refute point ad hominem attack? Earlier year, virulent strain avian flu broke SC industrial turkey farm. Afaik caught humans got infected, prematurely slaughter thousands birds contain it. Honestly we're lucky getting breakouts factory farms are. takes noticing late. 9:30 mark since one posted yet. take highest numbers find. don‚Äôt know why. produce themselves. would certainly licensed production around world like Oxford vaccine.

Which poses question: Would US begin production China-developed vaccine? Boats MAGA flags Guy 1:""Don't open jar, there's anthrax there!!""

Dude 2:""That's deep state wants think. sheeple""

-Dude 2: sorta fatal death occurs. Still waiting hear hoax- ""vulnerable"" half adult population US. going double class sizes? seems counter productive social distancing. I'm afraid everyone thinks going lose big isnt gojng vote wins. Please vote make sure lose individual responsibility society defined constitution. excessively hyperbolic.

Emergency executive authority implement practical public health measures certainly constitutional interpreted legal system centuries, since revolution. approaching urgent public good perspective. best thing saw dark time video grocery store people shaming non-mask wearer...

It ny thing I‚Äôve ever seen Guessing Desantis spout sometime week wacko bullshit crazy arm movements see parties gatherings. I'll go far say totally see case count FL 15k day 4th. ‚ù§Ô∏è Desantis protect nursing homes anyone. way fewer nursing home deaths NY, mainly didnt stuff nursing homes woth covid19 patients, like idiot would. Cases increasing south mainly 105F outside people hanging indoors bars restaurants. play politics day long, really showing a55 so. kid supposed enter kindergarten. I'm working home time, visit company locations every week, can't bring kid me. online option work.

My spouse also teacher, teaching Elementary art every kid school. even kid stays home, still exposed literally every kid.

If would close in-person instruction could teach virtually, could stay safe teach kid two us. is, we're double fucked. !remind 90 days protest shown us need restrict indoor activities. outdoor ones. explains lot. pastors saying this! Ugh! Worldmeter trash completely messed reliance numbers. crazy planning this. Current spikes infections idiots hanging bars going businesses force masks. people go back work kids go schools, crazy. Yeah agree. Even don‚Äôt end ventilator looks like causes organ damage multiple areas lungs. Nervous system, kidneys, heart, etc.  agree it‚Äôs dangerous disease doesn‚Äôt result immediate death, still significantly shorten life expectancy impose debilitating effects lifelong.  anyone ""switches sides"" starts taking virus seriously must met immediate unconditional forgiveness Hey big guy, gloomy, moment living?  ‚ÄúWear mask‚Äù says wearing mask. Safety guidelines restaurants joke, restaurant safe vaccine, midst pandemic left roam wild across country. F#ck! Brooklyn? dumb. go back building drunk spread everywhere!

Edit: see north 8th Street. Williamsburg? needed pray it.

Just like AIDS epidemic Indiana took action help.

Same shit, different day. Remember time Google CEO talked politicians Trump google image search thing fucking stupid made look? health science. legit second wave America right sure, may get earlier, efficacy vaccines also rely herd immunity. what‚Äôs real gain here? even friends wont learn them. everyone get vaccine, would absolutely problem anti vaxxers. people literally can‚Äôt get vaccines need rely herd immunity safe. Also anti vaxxers children suffer too. Russia owns Trump. Deep State around long time. Body Secrets, Puzzle Palace, Shadow Factory written award winning producer author NOVA James Bamford. Deep state, shadow government, etc detailed length books last 1/3 book sources info. indicates always power beyond governments pulling strings, tracking citizens, creating turmoil world drive agenda. said, wear goddamn masks!!! least South Carolina governor asks young people stop behaving like young people... first one really great film definitely touches conflict politics science. It‚Äôs one favorite movies. Florida man puts salt shark neighbor's pool. Dumps truck full sand lawn. Remember calculate death survival rate cases come end. 

Unless someone stays coma, people either die recover. can‚Äôt calculate cases still active. 

So, it‚Äôs this.

Total cases concluded = # deaths + # recoveries.

% deaths = (# deaths / Total cases concluded) / 100

% recoveries = (# recoveries / Total cases concluded) / 100

In US means minutes ago.

As 4:30 PM CST, Sunday, June, 28th, 2020

US Coronavirus Numbers

Total deaths: 	**128,368** 

Total recoveries: 1,088,226

Total closed cases: 1,216,594

% deaths: 0.1055, 10.5%, rounded 11%

% recoveries: 0.8944, 89.4%, rounded 89%

11% + 89% = 100%


We take little farther know active cases, total case count total population.

As 4:30 PM CST, Sunday, June, 28th, 2020

US Coronavirus Numbers

Total case count:	2,625,911

Total active cases:	1,409,317

Population:		330,986,397

1 person infected per 	every 126.04 people US

1 active case per		every 234.85 people US

If current active cases come conclusion 10.5% (11%) death rate, = 

# deaths current active cases:	**148,682**.9435

# recoveries current active cases:	1,260,493.1248

This means spread Coronavirus number cases US stopped increasing 4:30 PM CST, Sunday, June, 28th, 2020, death recovery rate stayed 10.55%, total impact US would follows.

Combined # deaths:	 **277,050.**9435

Combined # recoveries:	2,348,719.1248

That‚Äôs **277,051 deaths**. 

At 11% death rate, it‚Äôs **283,392**.87 deaths.

At 10% death rate, it‚Äôs **269,299**.7 deaths.


This without new cases all.



In US now, reality we‚Äôre getting 41,664 people infected per day measured past days.

New Cases per Day

06/28/2020:	+34,070

06/27/2020:	 +43,581

I really hope I‚Äôm wrong this. birthday 4th July. son asked today we're birthday said plans!  Yea lot news coverage pandemic bugs me, showing totals instead active list. Along showing enough frontline hospital views nasty virus is. get better coverage wars continents happening right home hospitals. Also, [Here's clip I‚Äôm calling local Tops tomorrow morning ask manager hell family 6 wandering around without masks. (Finger Lakes region, no, weren‚Äôt Mennonite.) don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen one! movies US politics, ‚ÄòAll President‚Äôs Men‚Äô great, crazy time, maybe ‚ÄòIdiocracy‚Äô relevant then? Florida reopening fast, Memorial Day, enforcement social distancing

What protests? impact? least double that, sadly might happen election day understanding one reasons 70% Fairfax teachers want teach online. Many parents students Fairfax school system. know kids going home week. teaching online, need arrange child care cost lot money.

I fortunate. work home 100%. wife stay home mom. mother law lives us. two kids. oldest going 1st grade. younger one would right age pre-k going anywhere. Derp - latter, activating triage protocols. Nah, blame African dust cloud. Furrinners causin cloud. complete moron think Biden beat trump  well known fact countries like Russia China actively attempting interfere us domestic affairs benefit. There's substantial body evidence supporting right way sometimes seems hardest way, often way get want get. NY State place test, trace isolate. keep containment Corona. States decided open economy without getting Corona control suffering massive outbreaks. point view many open getting COVID want play like want dealt way would cause this. 

It's like social experiment - watching apes go nuts approaching trying help them. think went Wuhan overblown, Wuhan handling badly Wuhan great job, virus crayyyy hell. immune virus point respiratory.

On hand still think country ease Eid, pretty worried wedding industry opening. hope wrong this, wont go invited since prone flu stuff sigh. Wear protection. [The cannon industry (more-er) unhealthy wear mask 20 seconds time takes wash freedum hands. wish back tri-state. 10% mask wearing panhandle Florida. actually probably high end guesstimate. municipalities near us mandated mask wearing within city limits. start. think main problem government really said all. also lifted restrictions way early. shitshow States which, ironically, could lead next Prime Minister running campaign ""Build Wall"" cite part? behind paywall me. think things like air/sun stability factors overcome mutations. Coronaviruses general pretty easy kill compared viruses. EBOV example stable flu virus air, we're lucky use aerosol transmission main spreading mechanism.

Now hand...UV kill coronaviruses, good news right since summer. Unfortunately, let virus run rampant problem even summer, gets difficult later UV levels dip (leading knock-on effects like lower Vitamin D, etc.)


And winter coming. hero show vaccine found ancient Egyptian tomb virus also from. curse faraos.

Thanks friend Airlines refusing enforce face masks, people coughing others asked wear mask... Soon, people yanking masks people's faces. Well, we‚Äôd it, like 3 months.

But since people making selfish choices right now, could work outside instead others suggested.

To summarize.

Thanks link, fellow ukrainian, I'll check link points future study

That's news report May. trial already happening. see updates site. Like [this one talking ""future"" Phase study already happened/currently happening Doh! let get straight - care anyone yourself. counties handle probably allow citizens counties can't handle enter country like Europe decided US. Crazy times.  wise redditor said: 'If wanted American's ware masks. told would help people. Know audience' Biden run president, see Pence worse. fact far less baggages Trump, would vote heart beat Trump Biden.

Trump may experience Boris Johnson incident, Pence win lot voters hates Trump new cultural revolution America.  Officially

There hundreds thousands deaths go unreported developing countries protests likely contributed surge cases, it‚Äôs black white.

For example Washington DC protestors city, 200-300k people congregating near White House 3 weeks ago.
Yet surge cases DC, MD VA...in fact continue drop positivity rate still declining.

I 98% people wore masks protest, may factor still, protests necessarily cause huge bump cases. need wait weeks sure, don‚Äôt spread virus much one would think. Covid19 deaths mis-classified pneumonia deaths. It‚Äôs value based production based. much better already existing. Industries large intellectual property basis don‚Äôt charge production basis. Microsoft doesn‚Äôt charge based amount money takes print CD program. industry high degree intellectual property component charge manufacturing costs. They‚Äôre making bubble gum. hired thousands MDs PhDs come brillliant ideas. Deaths lag behind spike cases weeks. really looking hospitalizations. Gen z

It‚Äôs gen z you‚Äôre mad at

I haven‚Äôt spring break 12 years. Wouldnt nice first place right theyd reducing restrictions instead starting them. Smh even bunch. some. sounds less like governor Texas saying couple months ago. see works them. point, whether wear mask much intelligence test preventative measure. Regardless that, needed declare pandemic baseline requirements declaring pandemic met. Kneeling idiocy US excuse; clearly didn‚Äôt anything US left anyways. Huh, opposite me.

Canadian could never live anywhere steady supply Ketchup chips. last! likely huge % population NY Metro exposed already. Plus NYC protests happened throughout city. People didn‚Äôt drive them. 

There‚Äôs doubt LA protests led covid spread. Hollywood Blvd packed. wore masks, all. People drove carpooled parts city. know four people went protest. covid now. one mild symptoms. 

It‚Äôs common sense nationwide protests partly responsible rise cases. Good news mostly young people. glad actually saying something now, REALLY could used message 4 months ago. dearly hope people listen him. days ago like, eh, corona noob virus Tucson AZ, mandated mask policy. Everyone public wearing mask...

I would estimate experience, maybe 50 percent people wearing mask...and employees least likely seen wearing mask.

It‚Äôs gotten point mayor gotten many complaints employees wearing masks, trying find way catch fine businesses disregarding mask policy.

PEOPLE TUCSON, PART WEAR MASK PUBLIC PLEASE!!!! they? books, sure. certain point, many businesses operate underground rather close down. many businesses ignoring law, won‚Äôt possible enforce law meaningful scale.

Pick one. I'm curious can't ask prices receiving treatment? anyone remember wash hands keep getting COVID? Quit spouting propaganda talking points like tool. quote Fauci, one size fits situation.

B-cells that. ‚ÄúT-cells antibodies‚Äù isn‚Äôt even thing. many states think are? CA spiking death spike. assume drawing party lines here.

What everything else. ppl involved? Deaths really low. would really easy see discrepancies right now. People coming ‚Äòan American experience‚Äô absolutely want go Starbucks similar. haircuts, don‚Äôt get hair done Australia cut, colour style dry upwards $220 places. similar advanced economies whereas USA it‚Äôs often $80 thing due shit wages poor workplace safety laws.

Even I‚Äôve done I‚Äôm known locally clothing style closer ‚Äòtragically nerdy accountant‚Äô. yes - they‚Äôd stuffed without tourism. Remember folks, *because* lockdowns, social distancing mask usage. goes away, cases rebound rapidly. I‚Äôm trying say even though things looking good, it‚Äôs time rushed re-opening us go back normal fully. assume work people Florida sensible. pass rule bars serve alcohol last week? Gulf Co saw news. miss climbing.


If people wearing masks wearing correctly go long way. 

But havent single place everybody wearing masks. 

With greater activity going get breath coming improperly fit masks. You‚Äôll also get masks coming off. people lowering talk. people using bathroom blowing nose washing hands. agree you. honestly think spike either, like huge jump sudden. happen think trickle slowly IFR low new demographic cases. I'm seeing interesting trends along Alabama border assume lot people travel across state lines. awhile, Alabama really struggling.

I would expect see Florida hotspots crawl upstate within next month, too.

But overall... absolute worst! Depends lot things. A) epicenters virus then. states prepared (NY example), contained. not, repeat Florida. B). Vaccine available not. C) long immunity lasts. ""if country begun locking cities limiting social contact March 1, two weeks earlier people started staying home, vast majority nation‚Äôs deaths ‚Äî 83 percent ‚Äî would avoided, researchers estimated."" comment typo? article literally argues earlier lockdowns would've saved lives, ended them. Spent whole life looking place like that, bounds. Sigh. proved incapable acting like adults face serious challenges- starting President way average citizen. 

We going stuck home watching economy collapse wildfires burn unchecked fall- preventable.  Omg guys scared retweet. especially since parents claim dependent like 24 something US Right. 1.4 million people nursing homes; means 43% deaths occurred .4% population -- arguably sickest demographic country, given half nursing home admissions die first six months. americans think gambling lives worth Applebee's manicures, apparently. Due variable reporting weekday, 7 day rolling average best metric go by. right 600. Voter suppression issue. So: two deadly ones - SARS MERS - never lasted long enough vaccine testable, since need people actively infected test vaccine. 
The coronaviruses among viruses cause common cold, making vaccine cold (which caused many different viruses) worth it. ask, what's problem? Reddit seems think reason people wear masks spite ""science."" Everyone claims major city live in, everyone wears masks they're progressive enlightened. Yet fact remains happening real world. People everywhere refusing wear masks distance kinds reasons. turn blind eye political agenda important calling people spreading deadly disease. Ooh, best part is, can't taken away you! one, get keep. Potential effective Northeast right now.

NY's positive negative tests dipped 0.84%, definitely doable pool testing.  envy world. know least 4 families KY recently traveled Panama City Beach/Pensacola. sure brought Rona back them. That's rhetoric works... context statements. highly doubt Bernie gonna try presidency, like hitler coming back.

I trying make connection ""at point"" comment, implying ""at point"" easily mean indefinitely future.

I'm 25 though that's I've trying tell lmao. like assuming highschool based upon perspective, equating written thoughts uninformed immature therefore fresh highschool... miscommunication. I'm sorry say even real consequences lockdowns, there's way lockdown would cause amount death destruction unhinged reopening would. find comment saying airbags killed harmed odd person, we're better driving cars without entirely. flatly untrue. .013%? lot posts people's parents grandparents going exist. anecdotal noticed it. agree. bars UofI CU campus following indoor capacity say least still learning. People need understand that. It‚Äôs still evolving situation world.

But also main concern immunity immunity, long last? that, insurance, negotiating $1123, pays $200 still pay $900? 

what kind backwards ass insurance that? way around bother even insurance? insurance company, what, makes pay $40 month, covers 18% bill, pays 82% ?!?! 

that's worst insurance plan I've ever heard life!!! get something wear mask, different choosing go indoor gym. doubt, cities unfortunately next hotspot waiting happen.
 Amur ica. realise sub, filtered ""Europe"", basically Sweden UK? follow flairs.And even need see source domain title know anti-Sweden propaganda click reddit post OP, user even categorises increased testing bad news, example.   Let know Germany France also explode cases point Phase III test wide demographic, especially elderly (as weaker immune system, make sure immune response sufficient)

You use young people phase safety side effects tested vaccine works safe, useless test efficacy. things like enhancement vaccine efficacy tested phase II III wish stayed home longer well save up. moved out, got job went college like thought supposed to. ran money school I'm trapped job company sucks ass pay well. knows I'll ever able finish degree. :( large scale trials UK using Brazil large experiment? That's literally said. People Miami already anticipation 4th, going get worse. month? Average infection time death 18.5 days hospitals filling almost 2 weeks. think much sooner that. Fingers crossed pandemic shows foul gross society USA makes.  worthy praise defense. Whether bad health care system, bad welfare safety net, bad electoral systems bad transport systems belching carbon pollution pathetically inappropriate. Probably, yes. really hard grasp? understand, without Sunshine Laws, ""Florida-man"" would exist, would clue goes on? Social interaction easier alcohol fair That‚Äôs lot easier said done. jobs? savings? Imagine touch....some people don‚Äôt means shit might change getting CV19 -- assuming survives. indoor gyms. indoor dining. indoor anything to. 

This really hard. mean, he's right. handled poorly, recommending closing borders, telling people wear masks. got seeded cases Europe USA, spread like crazy told people wear masks.  think good majority us going kids back school within next 2 months basically situation exposed unfortunately, matter careful far. said parents able set tone, would demand masks pickup time interaction adults. Yes shittiness stupid motherfuckers actual reason. ""I got muh rights, man, I'm 'murican."" real reason spread. Bars barbers helped along could first look good faceplanting front bar picked virus from. watching Fauci speak basically said hes never seen virus variant person person, people dont even feel it, feels like flu mild cold, need ventilator 

Is can't get grip virus? already are. Year year, we're seeing abnormally large numbers dying across USA. combination clever categorization underreporting, states (florida) hiding true toll, overall reporting tends lag 1-2 months behind reality.

Add global nature pandemic seeing seen minimum death toll, accurate one. There's much going on, accurate reporting one casualties that. walk around fully naked state. sayin Again, I'd like see proof t-cells antibodies occur patients Covid-19 immunity. doubt there's any. technically old news official Oxford release information. (I know Phase 3 trial example) Unless someone high viral load coughing sneezing bathroom within hours entering, spend 10-15 minutes there, risk negligible compared entire airplane full people taking mask eat, drink, PLUS bathroom use. mention time spend airports including security, bathrooms, etc. It‚Äôs true neither zero risk, one clearly much higher risk simply based numbers people you‚Äôre exposed to. Please please calm down. think you‚Äôre gunna okay. Maybe take break social media start feel sick get tested don‚Äôt stress extra hard. Went coworkers Olive Garden earlier year, first time least 5 years. believe much business prices. much prefer spend money smaller restaurants. oh wow. shocking. /s Creepy never said that. like American though, I'm proud society we've built even perfect. would much rather American citizen country Europe, anywhere else matter. recipe? Pretty sure already baked cake left oven long kitchen‚Äôs fire. Oh shit think US too, long ago streets everywhere. use? Tear gas? Rubber bullets? Wake people, fight corrupt governments oppressed people happening everywhere, China. outraged governments. Orange County population- 3.2 million. 

During week question OC averaged seven daily covid deaths. Yesterday three covid deaths.

Okay. Cool go forth spread covid leader commands. States protests seen rose cases. let facts get way rage, lol. unlike US, rest world isn‚Äôt fucking around Why? state lines shut well? get saying, also see /u/mad_nauseum's point. seen lung autopsies?

I have, I've sought information out. easily ignored dismissed want seen people suddenly fainting streets China/Iran?

I've actually. symptoms could explained anything heat stroke general seen people ventilators?

I've not, generally medical info private, ICU footage recorded public. family member friend seen it, like general public commonly shown people ventilators. I've read descriptions experience.

-----

I think mad_nauseum's point we're seeing obvious visible public symptoms. lacks visual drama public consciousness. virus caused people break lesions, unable walk without assistance, hack blood constantly, would much harder people denial existence severity. They'd also likely comply mask rules public orders, would obvious visual cues infection, rule, people tend ostracize rather embrace comes severe illnesses. ‚ÄúSo let‚Äôs close beaches force everyone inside 4th!‚Äù

-South Florida Depends long wait purchase eating. Even global crisis? Youd think theyd get special perms time. necessarily. certainly could, leeway aforementioned long incubation period. there's specific pressure would, there's also evidence time has. mean, obviously spread, we're going see higher absolute number deaths. *percentage* deaths still same, improving, there's evidence mutation caused higher mortality.

I would say clickbait. Like yeah, maybe people died due higher spread, long percentage same, wrong say ""more deadly."" Care spill beans? Won‚Äôt tell anyone, swear protests? major cities protests occurred, spike new cases. Protesting also bit important concert inbred hillbillies  Whats Monday low terms deaths? therapy similar (EMDR). really help Gym access necessary get workout in. In-home outdoor workout routines exist, too. think done math. 

And comparison Johnstown (a deliberate mass execution) bit top think. pretty sure (s)he meant ""gators"" Bars restaurants packed here. dont need much that.

Especially people think ok go bars restaurants type people wont wear masks shopping around coworkers go visit friends family. *some beaches


Headline FAKE NEWS live least town, people super super careful mask utilization. Believe that‚Äôs case city well, gatherings *can* happen they‚Äôve got severely limited numbers, outdoors honestly it‚Äôs good idea wear mask even outside gathering like that. Lot areas protests saw large mask utilization well, hasn‚Äôt spikes *yet*. 

It sneak fast, see countries freak hell get like 10 cases. know bad get fast, we‚Äôre definitely woods even currently 1 4 states set contain it...it change heartbeat. Establishments letting indoor dining happen soon too, I‚Äôm definitely nervous hope everyone right thing keep check. Like saying idc drive drunk. push US individuals intentionally get get immunity. lot experience faking suppose. Flip upside see truth side. Life first, liberty, happiness üò¢ US also lie numbers, Trump even admitted this. I've great patio bars live, here's problem video:

1. standing. self serve all. tables
2. Tables 6 ft apart, less. get go bathroom, put mask on.
3. FUCKING IDIOTS getting downvoted 100% right. scientific evidence wearing mask... well known masks key facet cutting spread. knew it. lied preserve N95's frontline workers. Even though cloth masks would suited public fine (but one wore told ""masks"", general, helpful). 

If anyone seen HBO's documentary Chernobyl, ""masks bad"" line ranks right lied people Russia nuclear reactor went boom. 

There zero question tens thousands people died otherwise have. tens thousands die lying initially Fauci company lost credibility lot people. even give good advice now, many listen. 

It's redditors gotta worry (most research), zombies listen Fox CNN... latch statements can't change mind. don‚Äôt even like going beach regular Fourth July. true insane person would want go now. Fauci like lone adult room bunch wild children he's trying best watch there's many handle. Truth hurts. easy manage 65k+ people already died it. that's bullshit. friend wonderful landlord Chinese millionaire afford smaller cheaper properties attracts shitty tenants fucked like people power care money... human life. ya'll need much much better job voting gov leaders. sayin  country able end community spread does. takes. scary. homes, businesses well?  No, masks turn face gay frog. ignorant comment. guys actually want help or.... problem people willing change long period time.  That's false dilemma logical fallacy. either 100% quarantine 100% normal life. There's plenty options exercising outside proper social distancing bodyweight workouts park.

Asking :

I worked aerosole generation procedures COVID-patients. infected? none ICU colleagues? infected hcws non-covid wards mask order none?

Got biased C&amp;p list also?

If u would work COVID-patients. Would wear PPE? Maybe get job hands patients put c&amp;p list test ;-) really should. Places reopened indoor dining Hudson Valley idea insane. We're throwing away progress made. hate Supportive! Absolutely supportive. portion Chinese tests Wuhan Beijing pooled tests, 10:1. China absolutely testing.

The per capita thing shows bad job US done containment prevention. tell wearing masks currently big break half hour road next county bunch idiots went Mrytle beach. Absolutely.

And awful position put someone in. Yes. failure leadership. failure public health officials.  said ‚Äú95% population.‚Äù nose running since April.

Money pays things like insulin. Without due.

Money pays things like housing. Homeless shelters, like nursing homes, disproportionate amount illness death tied COVID-19. already thought PCB area would insane weekend, I'm thinking it'll next level shit. Nope. lot major revolutions either general populace hungry nothing lose, middle class swapping power upper class. obviously overgeneralization fits lot historic events. example, protests Egypt Arab Spring ignited rising food prices. ideas fighting right food, hungry spurred movement.

You're sort right. People tend take power hardship, significantly less.

What I'm trying say predominantly, people rarely matters. screaming void history care. victim-blaming it, what's getting goat. Great! state Texas, please! Um...  realize leaders (and citizens) developed nations lockdowns get 'free' healthcare testing right? game everyone loses! 

The non-Florida gulf states probably cheering tourism dollars right cursing beach goers 14 days. seen across country, health officials quitting hostile attacks mention mandatory masks. whole country needs slap face grow stop acting like children. guess 115K+ deaths enough wake call. Car crash - real choice here

Depressingly I've heard many stories people getting car accidents begging bystanders tears please call ambulance bring hospital person lose everything life debt - living paycheck paycheck $1500 ambulance bill wipe savings several times asserted they‚Äôre universal.

But, still think industry needs eliminated. pay taxes US, ships massive polluters, pay shit wages employees. Jonas Salk patent polio vaccine because, unlike people, valued human life profit. Big box hardware store employee here. sales skyrocketed brief lockdown period had. don‚Äôt see anyone thread treating anyone crazy conspiracy theorist. sorry said mask that. making sure reduce risks others would face store. God that's heartbreaking. Coming soon: American Airlines Super spreader badge. Infect 50 states earn free checked bag (restrictions apply). I've argued price reflects fundamentals defined them, also environment business operates in. There's evidence market prices pegged reason, except personal intuition. I'm Ontario would say maybe 1 5 masks.

But city 450,000 40 Covid deaths since beginning. would look US look five months past? mean one that's descended name calling. keep posting reports anyway prove correct. one's saying public funded basic science research important. someone that's received funds wholeheartedly agree vitally important. R&amp;D costs drug discovery design majority public funded. study dispute that. sure. Anyone show full decon suit dare TSA ask take off? true. bars never opened least. Restaurants either. Trump wants chance winning, better get stimulus soon. second REQUIRED get re-elected, imo. terrorism reasonable definition word. assault. print money bro lmao entire family it? I‚Äôm hoping fought thing off. would love learn experience That‚Äôs impossible, Gov Desantis telling months now... son saw cats theatre broadway year. Definitely, better person 1998 theatrical production dvd. 

However, we‚Äôre pandemic right going going anytime soon. would support productions buying films musicals - knowing future could hopefully attend live play. R&amp;D already paid federal fucking government almost cases!

Do source this? article seems say 100% agree drugs priced much lower today. anyone listen him? Children good carriers child deaths single digits they? Children whatever reason seem get fine it. It'll ok say that, know girl caught virus club Miami went beach testing positive. Florida native. stupid ass people here, too. Thank clarifying info there. It‚Äôs nature diplomatic first would resort something aggressive person question intended cough *on* proverbial ‚Äúfirst swing‚Äù doubt trying harm direct way. Based reply, would justified then, right? Per boss via text messages: ""No one wears masks, one gets tested. wear mask want. one else sick, STOP WATCHING NEWS. BOSS, FRIEND."" know exactly wrong study it. Thing is, China first major outbreak, might even true origin, given community transmission confirmed France China even identified was. going YUUUUUUUGE! Agreed! Yeah, shit. country can‚Äôt work team. end position 4 months ago.

Edit: word Dibs cali. mask usage, i'm inside building, maintain six feet social distance, I'm good take mask can't maintain social distance?

Or I'm inside wear times? Obviously, second better, what's general consensus? blaming knuckleheads irresponsible decision top open bars restaurants quickly? Plenty blame go around. Politically easy blame ""knuckleheads""... People still going malls? think reopened soon (the common explanation FL TX), what? European countries strict lockdowns, they're always held successes contrast US. rely it..

But look way..

One party spits/coughs doesnt...

One cought would lot less violent Great. 

Go ahead China. 

Start another pandemic. I've determined I'm going get point. work kids. There's way school 500+ kids get it. I'll probably fine, older teachers probably going die. better heads state era founding fathers? curious believe bad people time, contrasted modern ethical backdrop. reminder Covid daily deaths falling since past month continue downwards wait I'm confused got tested one drive clinics. charge me? Wearing mask respecting people. Looking people see complaining wearing one it‚Äôs quite clear respect one else. news article false propaganda.

Like India example, 1.3 billion people extremely dense population , course they‚Äôll top 5, compare NZ 5 mil population.You can‚Äôt blame leader everything.

And Boris Johnson hasn‚Äôt done bad, jobs businesses supported well, strict lockdown imposed can‚Äôt control everything. Lol... live Martin County (the County north Palm Beach, beaches open) biggest resort 100% capacity last week 75% visitors Miami. seen Martin County‚Äôs cases numbers spike last week? many cases per capita Miami. you‚Äôre incorrect don‚Äôt much problem incorrect people aren‚Äôt driving two hours use beaches.

But yeah, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs decent money states. Research shows many doctors even understand basic statistics behind diagnostic test 

No RTC studies ever found protective benefit face masks stopping viral respiratory infections.

Here examples:

[Jacobs, J. L. et (2009) health-care workers (HCW) significantly likely experience headaches. Face mask use HCW demonstrated provide benefit terms cold symptoms getting colds.‚Äù*

[Cowling, B. et (2010) studies reviewed showed benefit wearing mask, either HCW community members households (H).‚Äù*

[bin-Reza et meta analysis 17 eligible studies. ‚Ä¶ None studies established conclusive relationship mask ‚ÅÑ respirator use protection influenza infection.‚Äù*

[Smith, J.D. et (2016) undertook meta analysis available studies face masks. identified 6 clinical studies ‚Ä¶ meta-analysis clinical studies, found significant difference N95 respirators surgical masks associated risk (a) laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection, (b) influenza-like illness, (c) reported work-place absenteeism.‚Äù*

[Radonovich, L.J. et (2019) undertook study healthcare workers assess relative effectiveness face masks 2862 randomized participants, 2371 completed study accounted 5180 HCW-seasons. ‚Ä¶ Among outpatient health care personnel, N95 respirators vs medical masks worn participants trial resulted significant difference incidence laboratory-confirmed influenza.‚Äù*

[Long, Y. et al. six randomised clinical trials (RCT‚Äôs) face masks ascertain protected either wearer others around viral respiratory illness. total six RCTs involving 9171 participants included. statistically significant differences preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza, laboratory-confirmed respiratory viral infections, laboratory-confirmed respiratory infection influenza-like illness using N95 respirators surgical masks‚Ä¶.The 4 use N95 respirators compared surgical masks associated lower risk laboratory-confirmed influenza.‚Äù*

Face masks work well surgeons want avoid dribbling sneezing patients, useless comes stopping viral infections. terms preventing spread COVID 19 evidence achieve anything all. know someone going social distancing got sick. shes ""people taking serious feel like disrespectful us sick!!"" ignoring lessons, moving exact opposite directions. Southern states opening SCHOOLs without restrictions month. Yeah Flint 5 minutes job. Terrible thing family did, killing man job. definitely also dated term East Asian folk. different negroid. Perhaps contemporary definition changed, person wrong. may never vaccine. willing take gamble? client 6 hours? guy driving vehicle registered freedom driver's license applied freedom paying insurance freedom covering genitals government mandated cloth pants freedom. specify time-travelling bacteria. Yeah, seems like find right people pay appropriately retain them. realize article says they're shut ""at least"" January, can't imagine think could possibly happen allow open January. Even - huge, huge, - vaccine by, say, December, there's way enough people could get vaccinated allow January opening. 

The lack logic even worse movies. I've read release dates pushed September. universe going safe go theater 9 weeks? really wish they'd release movies they're holding. would probably work advantage. generally go theaters anyway wait releases available video, pay $6 average see film. quarantine I'm desperate new entertainment I've actually shelling $20 bucks pop Early Access films Amazon, I'm sure I'm far one. Yeah, used always go gym really slow times like either 2pm people work like 11pm. super excited opened, saw hours something like 7am 8pm decided going back anytime soon. times always packed anyways, peak times even really available going nightmare there. instead I've slowly piecing together ""gym"" garage basically dumbbells exercise ball. much, keeping sanity together that's good. also bench way help lot. submitted article days ago post title, ""Researcher identifies eight primary justifications wearing face masks, paving way future interventions effectively encourage face mask wearing""; however, removed post title article title. So, reposting people found interesting before.

This article written me, happy answer questions. abstract, link full Abstract: Face masks avenue curb spread coronavirus, people Western societies wear face masks. Social scientists rarely studied face mask wearing, leaving little guidance methods encourage behaviours. current article, provide approach address issue developing 32-item 8-dimension Face Mask Perceptions Scale (FMPS). begin developing over-representative item list qualitative study, wherein participants‚Äô responses used develop items ensure content relevance. item list reduced via exploratory factor analysis second study, eight dimensions scale supported. also support validity FMPS, scale significantly relates face mask wearing health perceptions. lastly confirm factor structure FMPS third study via confirmatory factor analysis. efforts, identify avenue social scientists aid preventing coronavirus illness broadly‚Äìby studying face mask perceptions behaviours.

Full Link: Dang.I hope guys find solution. Whether more-breatheable mask, delivery/pick-up options, what. Best luck. Stay ok! 100% agreed

Yeah honestly fuck right wing protestors caused second spike gathering without masks. them, we'd reopening now.  Gyms arent safe. all. take precautions, doesnt make remotely safe. 

Its holding slightly smaller firework hand letting go. Eventually go off. 

You could easily work outside downvoted selfish it. assuming risk every person come contact with.

Do really understand group effort reduce spread actually go back normal eventually?

If whole country assumes risk like stuck limbo long ass time.  woke That's literally cap plans work make 50k year. Lmao. love I'm getting downvoted oblivion stating real world works.

I guess people actually know like job pay insurance said job lmao. reddit all. Testing without acting information gleaned tests silly. Ah vividly remember trump administration saying Obama‚Äôs leave guides deal pandemic. completely false course. Bunch useless morons. amount per lot something right? needs affordable healthcare wilfully ignorant save bucks taxes, tell ‚Äúfree‚Äù ‚Äúchoice‚Äù?... developed countries stupid enough think Americans sure don‚Äôt... China tell 31st December 2019? virus known anyone publicly then? Seems like everyone forgetting CDC told people bother masks February April something like that. need wear mask taking care someone sick, oops kidding. learned anything, first reaction always excuse. That‚Äôs lesson here, proper response ‚Äúoh bad, thanks I‚Äôll fix it‚Äù
Not 25 excuses made mistake every mistake 25 excuses. Don‚Äôt pass coping skills onto kid. Teach take responsibility it‚Äôs cool fuck up, learn laugh take advice  known risk 

Not true. Several studies found significant problems wearing masks. vary headaches, increased airway resistance, carbon dioxide accumulation, hypoxia, way serious life-threatening complications.

They risk frail elderly lung diseases, COPD, emphysema pulmonary fibrosis, dangers wearing facial mask *of kind*‚Äîwhich cause severe worsening lung function. also includes lung cancer patients people lung surgery, especially partial resection even removal whole lung.

In one study, researchers examined blood oxygen levels 53 surgeons using oximeter. measured blood oxygenation surgery well end surgeries. researchers found mask reduced blood oxygen levels significantly. longer duration wearing mask, greater fall blood oxygen levels.

*Bader et al. Preliminary report surgical mask induced deoxygenation major surgery. Neurocirugia 2008;19:12-126.*

The importance findings drop oxygen levels (hypoxia) associated impairment immunity.

This sets stage contracting *any infection*, **including COVID-19** making consequences infection much graver. essence, mask may well put increased risk infections so, much worse outcome.

There another danger wearing masks daily basis, especially worn several hours. person infected respiratory virus, expel virus breath. wearing mask, especially N95 mask tightly fitting mask, constantly rebreathing viruses, raising concentration virus lungs nasal passages.

We know people worst reactions coronavirus highest concentrations virus early on. evidence suggests cases virus enter brain.

Whereas redefinition phrase ‚Äúfailed state‚Äù diminishing real meaning phrase. TBF, NYC much better handle things many ""cheaper"" areas country (looking south southwest). Maybe worth paying premium live area people smart enough actually wear masks follow public health guidelines. People going able enjoy closer life NYC sooner places. Maybe seems like excuses too.

Over Netherlands, past. one gives fuck more. social distancing, mask, virus gone past. We've lucky imo, there's next outbreak, lot people get sick.

I forgot mention multiple people around us sick, corona never crossed minds. weird. dumb can't even see it.

Racists = ignorant

Racists love tell people they're sensitive blatant racism. living parental help? I'm one assholes wears sunglasses everywhere. better nothing. wants chaos. common politicians argue think changing leaders times crisis bad. unless change forced due term limit. 

To chaos better. Can't even get NHS staff wear hospitals policy must worn premises!!! places (Switzerland, remember correctly, one) also closed essential parts big box stores. Repair places, course, that's fine, I'm talking Target says they're essential aisles food, whole store open go browse purses fiddle toys, becomes place go got cabin fever. serious international peer reviews done. 

Antibodies extremely unreliable detect past infections Covid-19, let alone test immunity. 

As yes, medical institutions pressured grants removal grants ""produce fast results"". 

This whole episode eroded lot confidence lot credible institutions. 

The FDA approved malaria drug potential serious cardiac side effects political reasons. go. I‚Äôm south U.K. thanks Bournemouth disaster I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll follow suit within month! think government lifted restrictions way early! Mixing religion politics big force live Atlanta metro area wonder mask compliance might little better average. I've pleasantly surprised weekly trips grocery store throughout whole thing.  going say thing! result end fairness doctrine decades entertainment-news. integral American thing. propaganda fad keeps news-ertainment selling commercials making money. live border US Canada right I'd say half ppl see Surrey wearing masks 90% NW Washington are. Trump loophole. us idiots, make news. Except scientists agencies specifically designed handle event. truly inspired decision Great Leader disband right happened. Yep, sucks. parents start attacking anti-mask friends helping stop spread. Ok. probably cancel Nobel prize you. vote two parties depend it. Reflect fist.

I'd lose job that. I'm dumb shit still one wearing mask work. ones call hoax think actually parasite dumb shit. bar low fucking limbo Well country run death cult sometimes get lots of......death. add pretend Gilead themselves. claim spent billion used government facilities, scientists, university grant recipients along way.

Ay, like 4 months behind schedule Always funny Americans tell us healthcare system sucks slow. like live Canada experience anything lol. peak r/ChoosingBeggars even 3 months ago treatment throw people onto yet-to-be manufactured ventilators give pair dice roll. Seriously.. replying comment made 2 months before..

Also..the people infected close 5.5 lakhs..that's half million..so death rate still low..also need remind actual number people infected much higher official figures bringing death rate even lower..now let sleep won‚Äôt. need preventative measures strictly enforced. never happen. think limp along solid vaccine ready years now. Produce going get worse everywhere, fault grocer. Wal-Mart insane buying pressure.

Primary agriculture pretty fucked days North America. Yep, family rural Western NY believe visited parents saw many folks wearing masks public places. shocked. fact surefire way build long term wealth ""nope"" you, shows exactly much we're lagging financial literacy. entered workforce last year full time, money got sunk medical bills already. I‚Äôll fine avoid going hospital According article, China tested absolute numbers well per capita. top testing also better targeted high focus specific hot spots (11 million Wuhan, 2.5 million Beijing etc). generation order 20-30 years, ones defined study even smaller reason mentioned. Silent Generation 17, Boomers 18, Gen X 15, Millennials 15, Gen Z 15 also. healthiest people world! take better care health, considering cost healthcare here. seriously enforce mask wearing provide penalties caught wearing one provide masks cant afford one. focusing anger wrong direction.

No. don't. Thinking part happening. 

Some businesses incompatible current situation. People can't refuse let anything go expect things different. That's true places fields. accounting """"qualified"""" part. easy get jobs get experience, getting first one incredibly hard. companies simply unwilling hire people college train them. Calisthenics substitute 600lb deadlifts, everyone fortunate enough home gym enough weights that. I've laughing well, know people see smug. make concerned education kids general, also shows kids reared poorly. Walmart strawberries turn red slime morning purchased them... difficult imagine anyone worse them. Unfortunately, level stress correlated pay. known going profession. think looking whole population issue instead case-by-case basis huge part wrong CDC‚Äôs guidelines. must understand difference medical guideline plan protection public containment situation otherwise. always going tell take highest level precaution, even absurd so, otherwise real fear sued malpractice. fixation stock? 'own stock' retire anything else.

You paid living wage employer allows save money essentials life optionals life.

But again, would mean increasing minimum wage least 20 dollars hour even 'scut work' people call like McDonald's. Oh goodness pathetic. I'm chillin watching sesame street. Besides massively bad stomach ache 4 cups coffee drank fine. cleared right good poop. fiiiine. 

Children please stop. learned lesson picking wrong word, spelling wrong word pissing teeth gnashing sports fan. 

Jesus christ felt whenever tripped hallways way band class. Like fuck NFL survive pissy comment haha. Good luck restaurant business. mean insult way life profession. Nothing else say matter anyway. good day stay safe. Yeah want people socially distance need give people space it. Shutting parks, beaches outdoor spaces counterproductive. Yeah, fun savings account want run healthcare like business can‚Äôt think business agree purchase something without knowing price beforehand. might want re-read think read. 

Its main way isnt negligible threat. rotflmao Yeah based I've reading system organ human body coronavirus fuck with.

It affect elbows. thinking same. ""hot yoga"" parents back yard since live rural Texas town.

That, Super Bowl commercial NYC free testing available. landlord job like farming accounting - earth called passive income? owning property form investing?

It's passive income someone else take care you. know people farms accounting firms work either, right? single landlord suddenly disappeared tomorrow?

I strong feeling never actually owned home, you? don‚Äôt really clear picture what‚Äôs going Western Europe, say something like ‚Äúpeople X country aren‚Äôt wearing masks‚Äù I‚Äôm referring single comment saw that. care they're stealing 10,000 dollars 50 dollars month. still stealing.  assumed respect government, past 6 months hasnt earned one moment respect mean 401k, IRA stocks. know stocks cost much right? retirement savings yeah fucked Hospitals need elective surgeries 
Politicians need political cover 

Politicians end elective surgeries What? hope true. bad, thought magic air conditioned gym. literally didn't. actually absurdly stupid. BS.

She could tap unemployment benefits got fired chose work COVID-19 symptoms. charged manslaughter minimum. excuse.

You DIE get next several paychecks. general allow internal EU travel need admit uave resume vaccine. late. tourism, economies general.

As inner-EU-expat thing worried tbh. yeah kinda agree, even think tourism get lower priority re-opening, prospect improving stuff. would nice usual flying-for-10-Euro-to-Mallorca tourism would get ditch - sake environment such. understand confusion. I'm saying numbers going - they're going WAY up.

What saying? suggesting posted inaccurate? so, better (and reputable) source contradicts statement? broke neck drowned! Apples oranges. Florida's demographics, health care system, population density, use mass transit, climate, political makeup... pretty much everything different there.

I'm going guess/speculate Florida going end much worse mortality rate NY these. Sometimes politics intersect sports. Djokovic, he's many poor decisions lately demonstrated hubris. There's reason he's gotten nickname ""Novaxx Djocovid"". Yet still defenders regardless. He's always chip shoulder laments he's loved like main rivals Nadal Federer (ironically probably made great tennis player). really demonstrates he's great tennis player, liked... really brings upon himself. Incoming golf cart protests freedom white power think mean 6 thousand rupee. yes, would definitely feed middle class family 3-4 average Indian city. almost like take something seriously effective! think making assumptions political leanings aren‚Äôt correct. Yup Right, expected people shit always did, feel better it. response 9/11 ""if feel afraid change consumption habits, terrorists win"", forgetting shit spending money pretty well within wheelhouse USA!. snappy come back - yet phd powers, actual meaningful rebuttal. LOL. got diploma milled buddy police stopped murdering people to. plain statement need hear often. Tampa metro one highest median ages metros city proper average looks like. literally repeated fact landlord's greatest fear becoming member working renter class. Man, get one single positive news WHO! loss life devastating, pray scientist find vaccine soon! Never offer advice give alternative options either apparently. gets thrown jail gets Covid dies, would learned nothing. Say what? Dude exchange rate 900? India. Zimbabwe. 66$ something like 5 grand. Good could argue entire reason. Bob fucking mason Arkansas absolutely authority infectious diseases, trump doesn‚Äôt wear mask, he‚Äôs going follow suit. Certainly lack situational awareness. 

The correct example set people responsibility so. Ooooooooohhhhhhh vote!! thought would take that. sign up? get that‚Äôs great buying films support stagehands production crews work broadway around country. might help actors already make sizable amount. crews sitting home waiting UI run nothing...if collect. freeeeeedom!!!! /s guess might make people wear masks. mandate basically says people must wear masks unless want to. hope you‚Äôre feeling better arm pain normal hours next day. rare, unheard of, arm pain last days it. Good thought crazy reopening indoor dining begin with. gamble insured extent? stand opinion, stand yours. Might also know themselves. Using logic, would 20 millions people dead now.

This logic works. neither logical argument inevitable consequence argument.

Your summary impressively entirely disconnected point actually public assistances place help situation (food bank, churches, unemployment agencies, charities, free health clinics,...) lied, ""no symptoms"" go work, ultimately, killing many people.

People still die lack insulin despite programs. realize that, different unprotected sex others know HIV. OK this?

Am sex worker insured? 75th one percent world's population maybe already died.

I OP

EDIT: words, 0.00013 percent world maybe already died.

EDIT 2: Missed 0 doubt could ever ""prevent"" covid-19. want know reduces severity. want know reduces chances end needing hospital catch it. United States, could soon mean death since intentionally control epidemic huge swaths country making hospital availability soon become scarce. Mine planning fully reopening fall, yes. ""precautions"" (which security theatre). Denmark publishes research spreading Sweden, redditors try throw shade Sweden anyway. sanity left? 75% people County refuse wear one? Who's going write fines enforce it? That‚Äôs another large part problem Yes- numbers reported today samples collected days ago, that's relevant conversation. talking collection date we're talking test date.

The reason numbers lower today many labs closed/have less staff weekends less samples processed. vaccine 100% effective, last forever.  tool get herd immunity.  anti vaxxers still play part fucking everything up.  That's change body free pizza front desk. go deadlifting setting lunk alarm though. /Cries America voted ok‚Äôd parties.

It really happen like that. Treasury Department's ask tied much larger bill pretty much passed order provide kind relief general public. Mnuchin Congress barrel. Lol leave New Yorkers lead country cases, deaths start patting back. Put money mouth lol. yet, many, **many** would still consider lucky.

Edit: trying belittle hardships think people realize forget that's started out. One person. us, bud. it‚Äôs common sense. 

Poverty dire coronavirus many.  asked feel something? want cite myself? be, isn't. Write congressman suggest new law. They‚Äôre useless, needs googles, mask full face shield. leaders rally around flag effect approval ratings. Trump too. press conferences solemn guidelines, continued rise. descended madness self-congratulatory statements fell. Called days Risk transmission spouses 27.7%, researchers saying low 3% take precautions. See Table 3 risk transmission children much lower. Take care good luck. plan health insurance turned 26 (parent pay range federal employee). It‚Äôs hands best health insurance I‚Äôve ever had.  know DeSantis, seems pretty bad. elect again, else he'll think whatever wants without consequences. mean planet covid doctors nurses idea much charged, that's looked like that. Sounds like guys wearing masks times work like state law probably mandates.

And yes, pull food down. Sounds like breathed covid it. Jesus. Yeah point even lag still dropping limiting number people stores there? That‚Äôs norm U.K. lol plan world cause test cost 6 grand, please hamster wheel corrupt business. Sorta. Charges get adjusted afterward. Bullshit system, really Without n95 flying safe Close? mean say closed yet public still go there.  USA learned covid still going on.   
Guys..... still going despite dumbass president saying took [Letting days go entitled. gives fuck grandma nextdoor dies.

One going work essential. going lift weights not. That's dumbest argument I've ever heard. Please make sure cover nose what's point?  serve myself, :)
I love Canada!!!!!!!!!!!!!! lucky. It‚Äôs ducking late Wording exaggerated, definitely saw huge fuss meat shortage, well ventilator supply panic/hospital capacity panic general. right folks even vaccine, herd immunity accomplished , we're fucked. Sometimes feel like people staring much numbers. Yes cases gone up. still, offical number 67 677 cases. include antibody tests. ridicolous low number. True numbers Covid-19 cases Sweden magnitude tens times higher. Makes hard draw conclusions trend cases. opinion. Alex Jones trying desperately get noticed.

Funny thing . ...he got crazied Hug mom awesome! I've sewing since February. I've cleared 1500 masks. lots great groups banding together sew (BTW quilter, make dog clothes spare time). Drug companies make money sick people. limits pandemic one limits. I've come believe wearing mask visible manifestation person's IQ... Meanwhile NYC hardly half wearing mask outside... Yes said saying owning stock gambling ignorant, is. Owning stock isn‚Äôt gamble. Gambling zero sum gain. People lost everything crashes didn‚Äôt diversify, gambling. Owning stock inherently gambling.

We're situation start. got symptoms--ANY symptoms--you get test it.

Do week to. Chads. sad..../s operating covid magically disappears time football season plan guess. month late dude really quite proud country achieved. I'd say casual observation, people mostly comply rules, 20% always noticeable.

We've also probably one cautious slow easings lockdown Europe, helps. non-essential shops opened today closed three months.

However, slightly concerned pubs open 2 weeks time, seems fairly impossible avoid transmission kind setting.

Plus, England worry about, still pretty high caseload, may problem tourism opens up. kid, you‚Äôre right. one expect people sit tight isolate they‚Äôre getting compensated it, especially business. Yeah that‚Äôs pain ass. One easy, didn‚Äôt even ask reason, COVID. took bit work. [Yeah Hunt arrest person make example idiocy many time going explain different inside outside person lol? Lock up.

It's impossible lump pile. problem talking ""The United States"" -- diverse hard make generalizations.

I seen anybody outside without mask weeks. Guess live? Guess infection rate is? US recession average every 5 years since started. whole things mistake Yes, still first wave. spent 6 years working night shift ever since get super sensitive light myself. Hence sunglasses. Stop gambling.  real :( many people wear masks crowded beach? Got it, thanks. Good luck you! good luck enforcing Georgia 2,778 covid deaths. well comment context many experts predicting. predicting 20k deaths now. article Atlantic called Georgia re-opening ‚Äúact human sacrifice‚Äù. 

It‚Äôs fact experts wrong Georgia reopening. assume 2 million people die, assumes large majority population becomes infected. official numbers lifelong complications, news coming out, could assume somewhere around 30-60 million lifelong complications infection level.

People need focus that. want virus. even matter of, ""There beds people live.""

Based reactions far, 100% guarantee year so, many people much regret taking seriously. Many claim know bad. larger scale version college students got sick Florida Spring Break fiasco. Ignorance... * Super Wealthy landlords (such prop mgt corps) able cover extended lines credit banks cash funds hand.
* Small landlords (like 50 year old neighbor owns 3 houses) go one Congress give shit. Damn. based tolerance risk health, I'd 65-35 favor chancing it.

But end, me, would come risk finances....not anything insurance hospital bills, repercussions becoming ill....for instance, secure job would miss work 3-4 weeks. Nothing like little COVID19 freedom fondle snuggly creamy center ride sky. interesting indeed. Agreed. Wait, thought sent task force month ago? What's this, going next week stuff? Thanks explanation. I'm 115 lbs 10 lb dumbells well already heavy types lifts lol. never knew this. here. miss going Mexican, sushi, Greek, Vietnamese, etc. whenever felt like it.  Well, anyone would know lame excuses, would WHO. repeating broken points. fun, farewell. think certain aspects are. report legitimate numbers 2 different ways send 2 completely different messages. Doubly shameful leaders Canada used bullshit propaganda justify privatization. God bless Romanow report though thorough comparative look two countries. think report diminished conservative aspirations sell even parts healthcare already have. No. even politicians. parties platforms. UK government currently facing critism opening fast, live idk majority people care. 100% positive Puerto Rico? 

What's that? Reporting error...or? I'm sure masks. live (The Netherlands) masks popular all; they're required public transit. Almost one wears place, yet covid cases declining consistently maybe 2, 3 new cases day. Schools opened back weeks ago increase cases. Restaurants opened back month ago (though indoor seating yet) nothing happened. Hair salons opened back May (appointment only, limited capacity) we're still fine.

Throughout though we've social distancing pretty consistently, seem thing that's keeping virus control. probably parts country hit hard yet. Kind hard say exaggerated live NY. (Although even seen it) idea talking you? Probably watched grant cardone video think know everything institutional investors multifamily. Bars Clubs last things open back up. don‚Äôt even blame you. one right street packed. It‚Äôs apocalypse now, suppose. school district teach wants kids indoors masks fall. Six feet apart, means nothing confined space extended period time. Masks help, exposure time indoors major issue. mom forcing go vacation panama since ‚Äúplanned vacation months‚Äù, terrified. Really? feel like activity picked back since start mid-June surge. Slowed past days late May lull. next money. what's point differentiate brackets?

they fault. hunch incorrect. Money stopped working manner supposed to. Bartering awkward. need alternative can't hoarded rich powerful. contribution element tied trade system directly. state park this? I'm pointing one group (BLM) given free pass everyone else, regardless reason discredited ignored. BLM message police reform necessary. Earth seen normal people, Trump, protesters trashed want thing. Gather, rally near people. thousands gather packed like sardines plaza can't 100 gather bar way? one group group can. want BLM stop want everyone able do. That's incredible.

Above beyond community. Sounds like full mobile medical task force, something could see sticking around even pandemic, least aspects mobile portions. Protesting forced wear mask socially distance way dumber protesting police killing people color skin. many clear news reports BLM protesters way masks way fewer guns Covid protestors. government shouldn‚Äôt preference one type speech another, one protest selfish stupid based United States still grappling original sin slavery. distinction makes complete sense warrants much different response. Hilariously, covid protests got zero violent response. BLM protests consistently attacked militarized police forces. really clue you‚Äôre whining about. company even saying proven effective. They're saying ""has potential"" effective. Here's objective analysis.

But that's saying. literally said vaccine goes clinical trials see effective not. vaccine yet complete clinical trials yet proven effective.

Meaning thought vaccine tested yet. was. vaccine's purported effectiveness different argument entirely. Hope helps! graph shows daily cases way major spike. current one? what's ""14 day offset""? That's confusing me.

Point - there's spike daily cases now. mean deaths spike - let's wait til people start spreading parents grandparents. immediate. overrun bots spewing misinformation trolls. mods killed sub inaction. much better subs topic. test positive Covid antibodies. sick feel 100% fine. Still, I‚Äôd like get checked possible negative sequels. would recommend ask for? kind blood tests? checking pulmonary capacity, breathing? else may affected? think mistaking ""19"" covid-19 19th type corona virus disease. ""19"" name stands year discovered. 
Corona Virus Disease 2019, Covid-19. may corona type virus sequenced 2018(?) super relevant current pandemic. 

Unless, asking perhaps started spreading 2018 opposed 2019? pretty sure (approximately) disease started spreading Wuhan area. Everything virus political, political posts allowed. sucks

I blame everyone makes poor decisions enforcement ‚Äòrequirement‚Äô. suggesting covid-19 could mutation predecessor corona virus transmitted among people SE Asia? opposed bat corona virus presents humans covid-19? \*\*\*This actually false\*\*\*

No disrespect - sake others:

This something gets spread around lot, IM shot (i.e. basically vaccines) something do.

An IM shot, definition, meant go muscle tissue. reach muscle tissue, must pass tissue (i.e. subQ tissue etc).

By massaging site IM injection, forcing least injection tissue (tissue superior muscle tissue, needle must pass superior tissue reach muscle tissue).

This leakage subcutaneous tissue actually causes traditional ""post-injection pain"" - avoided (especially medications)

Edit - better advice would leave needle short time following complete injection substance, rapidly removing needle. prevent least minimize (depending technique) subcutaneous leakage. liked joke.... I‚Äôm skeptical media reporting Florida way since March. Like embarrassingly bad. twitter threads epidemiologists said Florida going NY May. Countless media articles saying FLA would 20k deaths now. 

I‚Äôm skeptical FLA death numbers much different Dr. Rebekah Jones‚Äô numbers (the fired scientist)

FLA deaths according Dr Jones-3546

FLA deaths (official) 3447

Is Dr Jones fudging numbers well? Bullshit, Obama handled swine flu awfully. mention terrible advice many adults give high school seniors college student loan debt. Almost every adult life encouraged take tens thousands dollars student loan debt. seventeen year old idea consequences debt would be. 

I acknowledge mistake take loans, damn system predatory exploitative young people lack financial experience. Look Canada, look many countries. They're better job. virus actual leadership leads cases going down. Lucky us huge movie nerds. given us time catch stuff weekends I'm lucky enough able work home get watch movies day well.

As pub subs, I've few. I'm Parrish area we're quite bad Tampa. waited cuz trust cleanliness anyone wife gets takeout everyday since office still working fine.

I finally caved got Chinese weeks ago (not race thing, Chinese restaurants known super clean), I'm still here. Robinhood, customer, product. angry this, actually hearing I'm telling you.

We know *she* went work sick. created society many people feel like choice so.

You upset low wage workers quitting job may justified going change anything.

What understanding many workers feel way demand protections make safer choices. Personally, unless super busy. COULD contract it? Yes, still outdoors unless running behind people extended periods time I'd take risk. granny home sticking facetime bit right? young healthy bar hopping. live Florida wish people would stop using terms like ""happiest states"". dumb concept sounds like rating 1st grader would make up. know use certain aspects determine ""happiest"", lol, state come on. weirdest, silliest, funniest, coolest state? I'd love see scientific data determined funniest state is. hilarious state? measure that? us favor even mention crap like this. sounds like article straight GQ. sound like child trying tell people happiest state haha. Give 20 million dollars. I'll bd happy state put in. dam live 100 C/ 212 F? Wow that's rough watch. mayor flat says ""that's job"" asked Vegas testing. Wow üëè üëè üëè elderly üëè relatives üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè üëè hand üëè üëè üëè I'm saying fields, things like Accountants, Upper management, Business, logistics, government, blue collar jobs like electricians needed everywhere.

Most bachelors+ equivalent degrees definitely put step lot rural options.

But, someone super specialized degree, true Major cities option. 

That's 2 months though one worst recessions we've US history since great depression. OP replying hasnt found decent work 12 years, post assume means hes actively trying. Something there.

Not mention move Rural states large ""mega"" cities cheaper living growing industries, like Texas Houston Dallas. already experiencing huge growth due people [companies leaving California due large part cost living taxes. Hey count dropping!

^Since ^we ^stopped ^counting... course. Look graphs US, India Brazil, showing exponential uncontained growth. see new market fake medical card exemption industry... would say case also 14 days, discuss people testing hub (or guards). I'ts give crap COVID, we're weighing risk vs benefits deciding worth trade-off us, personally. person make choice themselves.

I'll take reasonable precautions can, I'm willing live life devoid certain things means get COVID, well, I'll get I'll it. Perhaps time take gloves off. That's teachers union nonsense. Yes they're right, purpose school get education, functionally also acts childcare adults jobs. I‚Äôm arguing fact I‚Äôve read remdesivir silver bullet...I thought would cheaper...what heck know Astounding journalists still pushing Wuhan market story even Chinese government, originally spread patently false story, stepped back it. Yes potentially exposed across street potentially exposed infected person running elliptical sweating hand weights kind different order exposure. 
Being infected severity infection depends viral load. breath direct hit risk getting sicker, many opthalmalogists anesthesia providers getting sick (and even dying) early days illness mandated masks inside could drastically reduce risk. Sadly they're gonna Nah learned something it. Yikes. owe somebody! I'll pray Oh shit guys, trump got feel choice risk death, certain harm would come family housing income. job basically death couple months anyways. That's extremely oversensationalised international media. Nobody lost anything years people going that, nothing currently done implement that. wanna sit topic can't make Everything cleaning. Nothing see here. Move along seen police PEACEFUL protestors ?!  see friend outdoors get tested? tf people talk US health care system hospitals like fucking grocery store, know shit costly, start talking hospitals littearly showing like list prices go life saving surgery get life saving treatment, thats like plane wings engine pilots going front plane ground fucking straight nose dive reason one panicking cause theres still hundred meters go crash Hard blame them, since know, died higher rates age bracket.

So point really victim blaming. bunch dead people. Yeah saw ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù working Cross-fit like gym Chicago. mask others didn‚Äôt. Commenters like ‚Äúumm one else masks on‚Äù said felt safe since on... made cringe little. 

In case, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm NYC Cuomo looking air-conditioning units work opening gyms movie theaters. swedish death metal version herd immunity.

That awesome way put that. making iPhones

that's...not made US either lol /r/politics ban people disagreeing. incapable reading? wrote three times now. want refute it, provide evidence. 

What ""you people""? dont even post comment /r/politics. do.

Conservative subreddits ban people disagreeing. need provide evidence agree? similar Boston right now. Almost everyone masked I'm going regularly groceries. People probably take seriously within 1 degree someone getting sick. might start think. Maybe find spread Yoga class SK. high impact classes. lockdowns\*. need clear actually caused it. Covid making appearance specific weekend?

This getting hand. 

They need close immediately keep closed get handle shit. year number deaths never go down. scream help US people, idk does. carnage care homes around western world, looks us considered people expendable.  Imagine America this. I'm surprised, spent 2016 debate pretending none supported Iraq War. Canada without problem. 50% capacity. .... happened NYC hoax shit?

Glad finally got program, pretty fucking late this.

Shitstain assholes... so? Masks proactive reactive, especially speaking medical grade N95 even cloth masks, help stifle germ spread wearer. already reports blood donors couple year‚Äôs ago cells cross react SARS-COV-2. It‚Äôs automatically sign someone actually infected it. variant H1N1 hosted mammal readily compatible human cells worrying usual flu. 

Current massively heightened disease watching, especially China, good news. [What this, rationalistic philosophy *This time* they‚Äôll definitely right thing it. definitely won‚Äôt put red spin go broke like last 800 times sure, would think people start dying vaccine would know working...... health care great still issues. Takes longer see specialist, elective surgeries 1-2 year waiting period. long term care homes need overhall stop slashing healthcare costs. Waiting lists get new doctor's happen. Actively try emigrate civilized nation? easy, else going do? How? vaccine comes fall mean worst coming next months? recall people getting angry signs remind employees wash hands returning work restaurant kitchen. Hm, hard tell you'r serious not. pandemic worse March seem exactly good opening dine-in options thousands locations. Idk tho, really know know hell happening anymore maybe virus dine-in McDonald's vitally important saving economy something ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø Lol, adorable sad thing hospitals MONTHS train nurses ICU care... they? NO. Worried $$$ wanted point rhat title wrong...

The actual auestion survey 

Do trust US (not the) world leader?

And watch trump comedy purposes... ... oh rly, ya think? Masks situations social distancing cannot maintained

This true. Masks addition social distancing. 100% place. Lol old church got bought converted shady part downtown. never sold food prior lockdown, first shutdown put together ‚Äúmenu‚Äù front. 


Pretty sure don‚Äôt open like midnight, one hours clubs houston.

I wondering cover charge revenue helping offset 51% alcohol sales designation. PLA actually many healthcare workers. Wuhan outbreak manned Huoshenshan Leishenshan hospitals. PLA deployed something like 8000 military HCWs Wuhan. Netherlands Scandinavian countries masks outside aren‚Äôt common. may rational, long term goes up. stock market get retire early. Oh guarantee knows mouth breathe. ""One things we've heard Texas Florida particular nearly half testing positive Americans age 35,"" Pence said. ""That's contributing fact requiring hospitalized, testing positive coronavirus, significantly lower two months ""inarguable,"" added, increase testing ""has played role new cases, particularly among younger Americans.""

This surprising considering many young people thought protesting pandemic good idea. It‚Äôs shocking big banks still run COBAL part. aunt works one thought career brink extinction last 20+ years they‚Äôve never changed it. She‚Äôs close retirement age colleagues maybe it‚Äôll change soon. I'm saying permanent lockdown. annoyingly irrational ditch safety measures locked almost 3 months, threat disappeared. People can't afford months lockdown, yet commit actions bringing back. seen results recent KIIS poll SARS-COV-2 origins? freaking embarrassing. 
http://kiis.com.ua/?lang=ukr&amp;cat=reports&amp;id=952&amp;page=1 may work terms curbing spread Covid-19, although evidence tenuous that, hard time imagining reduce harm overall. Imagine that. Ramp testing finds cases. Discussion neurological complications gets shut time Bars mostly closed. understand they‚Äôre technically closed, basically are. They‚Äôre allowed serve alcohol property. works perfectly well months Europe. know single cluster happened outdoor restaurant.  Ok, I'll bite: positive influence US world days (say since 2018)?

I used able answer question, right now, can't. Either choice, think virus bogus, combination both. POS along potus. many die pride political posturing. thr laughingstock world.  integral part US information operations Feb/March: constantly blame PRC burying evidence US airlifting billions masks country blaming. That‚Äôs old data. Back idea long person already virus could get tested admitted hospital. days it‚Äôs easier get tested milder symptoms. goes show masks social distancing risk reduction absolute prevention. Americans fucking stupid assholes. Freedom killed Football. sense smell returned. surprising. Actually recall right, Greenland too. Supposedly virus stable 3 days, I'm sure keep separate rotation generally get dirty. that's safe, need explained why. I'm usually one government restrictions private business, one restriction pharma would absolutely support is:
 
You price drug see fit, must price world-wide, minor adjustments allowed logistics cost. honestly love sub. Community particular it‚Äôs great way keep informed COVID-19. People (for part) respectful one another comments even don‚Äôt necessarily see things eye eye, take deaths mine great example felt constructive informative me, instead us going back forth ‚Äúlol idiot!!! lol d00mer!!!‚Äù That‚Äôs really awesome thing, given get extreme ones either side aren‚Äôt constructive there‚Äôs gonna crap like anywhere go Reddit lol. Overall really enjoy users insights comments. 

There ***tons*** misinformation agree, media clicks drumming headlines you‚Äôve really got analyze things yourself. mainstream sources phenomenally well, haven‚Äôt heard I‚Äôd definitely say check ‚ÄúPeak Prosperity‚Äù YouTube. Dr. Martenson puts fantastic updates he‚Äôs spot since beginning. It‚Äôs adapted wearing mask way back February actually ‚Äúagainst‚Äù official narrative, low behold weeks/months go tables turn suddenly everyone wearing mask now. 

I try analyze cross reference much possibly weed misinfo. I‚Äôve definitely gotta check India out, thanks tip! I‚Äôll give look see find Stocks up. holdings went bond heavy mutual fund purchased two years ago case recession. 3 counties. Truthful headlines hard find! People always say (or disaster). never works way. work New Orleans Katrina (too many speculators deep pockets picking properties), happen 08 financial crisis people eager buy laid off, worried laid off, or, kicker, banks happy lending midst financial disaster anything best terms. 

So people lot money stellar credit may managed pick deals, think exception. Banks ended picking ton properties.

Rates super low right lenders looking borrowers lot harder already, large deposit, years worth payment liquid, etc. Snowstar, attacking people relentlessly fucking plants? gotta move on, you‚Äôre starting act crazy bad comparison, RNA viruses RNA viruses high tendency mutation making creating vaccine incredibly difficult, argue semantics regarding Covids mutation rate, however RNA virus like RNA viruses mutate far rapidly counterpart.

You taking scientists ""word"" scientific evidence. NEVER history creating vaccines developed one timespan, never. nonsensical unscientific even spout evidence, ever support claim.

These trials nothing new newsworthy. would never hear stories like past likelihood actually delivering vaccine low worthy report on, scientists overpromising sake given blank check government, nothing more.

You're swept con artists afraid reality situation, better falling snail oil. many 35 survived, forced live lifelong lung capacity reductions?

There's Corona death.

PS: young people also spread old people die, fucktard. Agreed need small million-dollar loan father I‚Äôve learned whole debacle U.S. don‚Äôt give flying 737 MAX F*ck anyone. They'll explain away somehow too. hypothetical war analogy works well:

""Sweden invaded foreign enemy going around country killing wounding people certain demographic. Military officials hypothesized based gut feelings flawed models enemy force stop they've killed certain percentage people. do? Let go around murdering Swedes say ""ah well, stop eventually, sainted military officials tell us"" try stop tracks protect many Swedish lives possible?""

That makes obvious. always try squirrel one too. downvote it. Show link someone getting cancer treatment. real solutions, either. live near nice local unofficial ‚Äúswimming hole‚Äù isn‚Äôt normal times regulated means. It‚Äôs crazy busy lately folks work official swimming areas closed (some reopening think). annoys there‚Äôs official parking area, trash collection, bathrooms. It‚Äôs crowded free-for-all people leaving pristine area total mess. Benny also collect fire extinguishers case they're needed cockpit. Unfortunately that‚Äôs Hippocratic Oath works. 28 years old, 401k since graduated college still look like it'll add much retirement.

i think retirement options either .45 head, dying revolution, actual cozy retirement revolution succeeds made comment blaming them. influence needs taken seriously. Totally agree us domestic affairs total clusterfuck counterpoint - close impossible socially distance plane anyway. keep middle seat unoccupied becomes close impossible make money. planes (like A330) means keeping 50% seats empty every flight 8 rows across. even keep middle seat unoccupied someone may cough behind cough/sneeze/breath someone front you. everyone wears mask duration flight reduce possibility transmission quite bit even planes 100% full. Agreed, don‚Äôt ‚Äúimportant‚Äù stalkers creeps mess you. didn‚Äôt even realize sister stalker asked windows tinted. actual fuck? would business news articles written people without money business? I'm confused lol. mean, get potato seeds, got one boxes produce delivery April potatoes grew eyes really quickly. cut planted they're already growing well. Let restate - see New York? 

My feeling things won‚Äôt change people lose popular support. It‚Äôs quite interesting look back threads late March Cuomo talking need 30-40,000 ventilators. fair, didn‚Äôt quite know dealing then, believing possible 20% hospitalization rate 2-3% fatality rate. threads, people thought even mitigation measures taken, would something like 100,000-140,000 hospitalized NY once. Turned out, hospitalization rate much lower thought IIRC hospitalizations NY peaked around 19,000. horrible, situation wasn‚Äôt nearly bad thought, one even manageable given two helpful therapeutics (not cures, helpful) experience doctors nurses treating disease (not intubating sick patients quickly, etc) save critically ill. turn states countries already become Europe II love old puppers. Mine's grumpy old man dog going blind, still sees motion well enough growl moving cars joggers outside window.
He copes well enough fading eyesight forget, toss treat, laugh tries utterly fails catch it. remember feel guilty. (He's happy gets treat.) pay get plane right now. Name certainly check out.

People fly lots necessary reasons. point expected social distancing flight none, packed disgust/dismay Nothing like price jacking global pandemic. understand situations possible. key situation kids, good dad. 

My dad wasn‚Äôt around. 47 years saw total 21 days. spend much time possible kids now. try good dad, I‚Äôm perfect, opportunity right wrong eventually. Hang there. living Philippines 2016-2018. Loved it. Simple. Cheap. Natural. come back work, think get permanent work home gig get Starlink internet soon. awesome place $1000/month spend. I've got call bs this. Australia repatriation flight come back Uraguay health officials said every passenger infected.

There lot developing nations stating war. Review testing levels procedures ask question again. beaten virus? Non FDA approved tests developed state lab absolutely publicly released data good aside press conference statement ""93 100 percent"" specificity. Requests information test refused. also significant selection bias.

There never academic paper published. Nothing peer reviewed. whole thing ""science"" press release. genuinely panning move US EU. im listing US vacation list ‚Äúsafari South Africa‚Äù. got lucky bought ton herbs vegetables late February/early March whole world made run them.

My tomato plants put like crazy godsend. **NURSE CANCEL HOLIDAYS PANDEMIC.** 

Shocking stuff. Lol, come ‚Äú$3,120 US patients?‚Äù others?

How decide pays what? know don‚Äôt know lot immunity point but

Say get months. Would easier harder body fight it? Like assume would still antibodies/Tcell memory whatever also could weaker lungs prior infection Yeah, lets focus golfing instead pandemic instead Oh yeah, far ! random millennial taken counter example law :D

But universe brightness bit irrelevant ? Elections consequences. Gyms open months countries, still spikes. Yep. would making perfect enemy good. progress better none. hear you. several big ""what ifs"" answer negative, results catastrophic -- society proceding optimistic assumption.

What immunity lasting?

What reactivation possible?

What vaccine never works?

What long-term debilitating effects?

What mutates become harmful? told mom getting plane come visit right now, she‚Äôs say ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt‚Äù. much better report finding articles quote doctor saying virus less virulent. Lots possible explanations. local farmer's market lot produce good job social distancing get time year anyway, always everything. sucks south like totally different country compared Northeast West Coast. They've always decades/centuries behind social issues unfortunately, they're paying price now. may get secession wishes granted none properly functioning states let travel there. You‚Äôre right. lot people heavy gymnastics justify protests beach going regards COVID. someone supports idea protests- surely help issues virus. forget international cabal scientists doctors too. ironic anti-mask crowd gets accident place take them. Feel good? convinced leftists sociopaths LARPing moralists one's forcing work somebody went family members funeral zoom, completely agree you. Attending funeral won‚Äôt bring person back; attending funeral may kill others. that's sacrifice I'm willing *you* take

Ftfy Critique method message sound.

Where logical fallacy? wrong?

I'm genuinely curious. I‚Äôm talking Sweden, means go ahead try make that. solely claim: ‚Äùa specific location‚Äù

As see talking 30 people either. 30+11 30, two newspaper articles alone. 400 also 30, ‚Äùa few‚Äù.

If want make comparison Sweden, OP making, pretty clear never sustainable way making people follow guidelines. police understood eventually, health authorities, yet defending it. new dental hygienist recently asked ‚Äúso SEC fan?‚Äù clue talking about. I‚Äôm nerdy looking woman certain age later tried figure asked all. THINK it‚Äôs made joke ‚Äúpre-gamed‚Äù Xanax visit. forgot phrase associated sports partying. :)  never said same. definitely not, close better nothing insist socializing. Zoom reasonable alternative completely irresponsible fly. Also cars exist want see friends badly. Nice strawman tore though! home country do?

In mine, British tourist told self-quarantine 14 days. refused it. 23 people got virus her, recovered. Since found new cases. Zero deaths.  international airline tourism industry basically lost 95% revenue.

Trying make Swedish issue hilariously transparent Nah, they'll get everyone else got it, cycle go on. 50% Americans hobby going bar getting drunk. I‚Äôm bartender everyday go work makes question fuck I‚Äôm there. confirm: beaches Maui packed ever seen them.  You, quite frankly, idea talking stop talking do. Coronaviruses well understood, SARS-CoV-2 96% identical coronaviruses we've already caught studied. take ""decades"" ""even century"" settle question. regarding HIV, entirely different virus entirely different order viruses, number features make creating vaccine difficult typical. HIV similar SARS-CoV-2 dog head broccoli. can't extrapolate experience expect right often. Yes, are. know functioning society looks like. People incredibly mentally ill lack Healthcare. affected voting. also affects day day interactions. That's one example. trending towards reducing death. P value like .059. actually backwards, air conditioning season Arizona, Texas, Florida etc. litterally hot people stay outside, crowding inside like North winter. live food desert Home Depots Lowes near by. Right amount need rate production stills shows long ways off. need roughly 8 billion doses everyone 100 million yet much freedom ventilator ICU medically induced coma? 

You can't even decide anymore live die alone. First, aren‚Äôt going indoor sports time soon. Second, start, aren‚Äôt going fans there. It‚Äôs really going choice trying convince doesn‚Äôt make much sense.  Depending live ling growing season yeah buying food plants flowers good.  idea. That's used much healthier society. BTW 2020 greenhouses grow lights work year round. Look states like New York example, seen increase cases. increase cases likely due reopening necessarily protest. I‚Äôm sure cases it‚Äôs vast majority new cases stupid, burns. respect, read thread. completely agree assessment. you‚Äôre busy trail something yes. run residential areas see someone coming towards move street something. mask drove 11 hours avoid 3 hour plane ride. 

I would drive anywhere across country avoid plane ride really. know driving much dangerous flying flying comes almost guarantee infection Exactly. point *he be.* WTF. snowbirds move No, I‚Äôm lucky enough able hide apartment this. boyfriend, though, work warehouse Amazon would lose 10 weeks pay medication got sick. Ah right expect 100% correct information brand new virus instantly. warned human human transmission 14 days first notified virus confirmed week later. course USAs failures started getting cases almost month later completely fault /s.

The advice widespread testing, quarantining infected people tracking tracing infections. Advice USA still largely ignoring Trump wants reduce testing makes look bad.

Right rather provide evidence convince people WHOs lies you‚Äôre going claim don‚Äôt need to. think that‚Äôs evidence need certain nothing believing whatever lies Trump others tell you. political solve problems. easily solvable elected officials care.

The pandemic need get bad is, lacked political save lives, either. Absolutely, completely false. Utter bullshit.

The two child policy hard fast rule begin with. going get arrested tried political prisoner number children.

Also, TRUE two child policy applies everyone. Ethnic minorities (that is, non Han) usually get exception. Lastly, one forcibly sterilized law.

This ethnic oppression slow cultural genocide. Nothing less. fact try downplay claim Western Media bias morally repugnant. also ridiculous, western media monolithic entity controlled respective governments would case China.

Fuck you. factory owner admitted AFP, however, ""distancing almost impossible factories nature job"".

They can't space sewing machines farther apart? 

Really? don‚Äôt many talking masks here, mainly using bushfire smoke late last year know they‚Äôre expensive chemists started selling hiked prices. wear masks want wear seem sturdy fitted flimsy ones don‚Äôt lot evidence effectiveness. 

I see older people wearing especially public transport. online there‚Äôs massive massive push masks despite numbers relatively low seem strange militant things get dire here. Bro, fuck? Masks help us, turning political debate? Smh. Well, follow GWB started war imaginary WMDs finish one daddy's little vanity projects. EVERYBODY knew. 

To Europeans vile shit happened **decades.** forget it. That‚Äôs said ‚Äúre:deaths‚Äù. Good luck there. Bro, paragraphs friend. They‚Äôre already mass producing lot people rely gardens nutrition even make living them.

Those people shopping farm feed supply store. prices much better HD Lowes. I‚Äôm waiting someone pull gun one cases shoot offender.  would totally self defense. Haha. Irony. going Diplomatic Victory points? I‚Äôve gone back work, masks required entire time. Mine adjusts talk, I‚Äôm adjusting. while, fix it, I‚Äôll go someplace one else is, like restroom, need quickly make sure mask properly. tend wash hands fixing mask. find something little form fitting. Imagine listened scientists masks months ago. shameless. go anything worrying week.

It's worth it. Thank explaining. yes majority people know think opinions equal scientists. least that‚Äôs something. millennial born 84 boomer parents. directly impacts me. talking about? Link? Cool! Texas next! VP present events. church. He's supposed setting example. Nice place start. Let's kill South American first, try enter US. ""Tonight 5, drunk people bad following rules.""

Wow idk I'd rather 32 dollars opposed 8 Yeah! Three little pods 2 gallons stock ruined. Sheesh!  ridiculous nasty people wipe machines after. celebrity thing video back April. ok.

ETA: don‚Äôt think said doofus video though, might effective. least entertaining. might (I'm lawyer) able justify gut punch self-defense. Pretty hard cough people doubled struggling breath. ""Purdy mouth"" prison joke, backwoods hillbilly joke. Home gyms many idiots commercial gyms that's amplified fact we're pandemic think ways could get safer everyone. tried cycling hiking? pre-print confirms it. would share since comes sub quarantined removed. also remember hearing damages testicles probably affect fertility men. great economic hardship comes great political change. Vote me, I'll make responsible pay! forget locust swarms, giant killer wasps... oh, sorry, already that. I'll say Covid happened previous Potus' watch, doubt even FOX photog could captured shot Barry, wife two kids wearing masks public. man defined leadership. Yes, look pictures, tens thousands people laying beach next like herd seals Georgia done well playing way report numbers mask poorly they‚Äôre doing. surprising considering Governor played numbers election too. Well thats going piss people... According estimate, takes 5 min face face conversation result infection boss convinced, maybe show set case studies illustrates one person infected half his/her work place: swabs tendency generate false negatives person tested early (before symptom onset), tested negative develop symptoms later, definitely arrange get repeat test. Take care Dang. finished reading news Microsoft News said virus speeding mutated deadly strain. told doomed. keep getting worst worst. Every time read watch news, never anything positive virus. world governments really need implement 100% shutdown nightmare over!!! agree, half ignore, don‚Äôt ignore half won‚Äôt quarantine two days getting bored needing go buy something stupid. remainder, half quarantine week. remainder, half said quarantined two weeks didn‚Äôt. think gets us 12 people actually full quarantine. think number high. actually worked Home Depot corona spike. Definitely brings crowd. one smallest Home Depot's country, ran max capacity (150 people) months.  Could =! nowhere go masks would quickly (pun intended), selfish assholes would turn cruise ship battle royale free say ""battle royale"". many people infected

...

Your forgot this:

... longer. pandemic started pretty scary too. really going festivals Tempe Town Lake and/or downtown Phoenix? events always crowded nightmare! I‚Äôm still nervous going gas station mask surge here, crowds out. forget Houston longer reporting cases, data reflected daily totals positives deaths accurate. 

We've 5,000 'extra' deaths compared previous YTD averages. lot attributed 'pneumonia' could short term immunity. flu mutates every year, new vaccine every year well. covid like would mean immunity wouldn‚Äôt helpful. sure downvoted. Yes, definitely period US considered defacto world leader. Meanwhile, don‚Äôt tell children don‚Äôt get able persist season mean seasonality. would basically unheard respiratory illness involve seasonality.

This may summer intensity, winter intensity even worse. want people ordering cappuccinos dinner here.

What? better time cappicino dinner? release numbers later day? Well weekly drop every monday . Today 4 weeks ago 674 cases .  NY positive.84% wow, Cuomo considering assessing reopening well least LA influencers /s eye-popping. Two people going exact emergency room test.

Face masks keep much fluids sprays yourself. Much better shield. filter small aerosols bc cannot create good seal getting protected. 

You correct I‚Äôm wrong, went whole thing work seemed easiest way break down. give another 5 months hopefully earn trust back. opens week sued Health Dept State Ohio trying keep shut. state gave in. Also, supposed require masks, change.org petition circulating like 15,000 signatures require abandon mask policy. seen many people social media like, har, har, I‚Äôm going wear mask gate take off. dare anyone say anything me. ok, sources really helpful help understand conflated ""dont' necessary"" ""we CANT it, provided PPE COVID pit needs it, cancer patient immunocompromised stay away hospital""

Thanks clearing confusion me. helpful.  Cases usually lower Monday. point I'm trying make constitutional obligations can't ignored.

Unfortunately I'm silenced automoderator.

Thing is, think NYC overtaken anyone end this. cities population density mass public transit system unlike anything US, far main reason outbreak saw.

Large cities Texas like Houston 1/4th population 1/9th density NYC, rural less density, avenues mass transmission. Doubt enforced. Probably try keep tourists away.

The rest said dodgy. **COVID-19 PCR Tests Scientifically Meaningless.** Though whole world relies RT-PCR ‚Äúdiagnose‚Äù Sars-Cov-2 infection, fit purpose.

Kary Mullis invented Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology. invention got Nobel prize chemistry 1993. Unfortunately, Mullis passed away last year age 74, inventor regarded PCR innapropriate detect viral infection. reason intended use PCR was, still is, apply manufacturing technique, able replicate DNA sequences millions billions times, diagnostic tool detect viruses.

Moreover, worth mentioning **the PCR tests used identify COVID-19 patients presumably infected called SARS-CoV-2 valid gold standard compare with.**

**This fundamental point.** Tests need evaluated determine preciseness ‚Äî strictly speaking ‚Äúsensitivity‚Äù ‚Äúspecificity‚Äù ‚Äî comparison ‚Äúgold standard,‚Äù meaning accurate method available.

As example, pregnancy test gold standard would pregnancy itself. Australian infectious diseases specialist Sanjaya Senanayake, example, stated [ABC TV answer question ‚ÄúHow accurate \[COVID-19\] testing?‚Äù:

If new test picking \[the bacterium\] golden staph blood, we‚Äôve already got blood cultures, that‚Äôs gold standard we‚Äôve using decades, could match new test that. COVID-19 don‚Äôt gold standard test.‚Äù

Jessica C. Watson Bristol University confirms this. paper [‚ÄúInterpreting COVID-19 test published recently British Medical Journal, writes ‚Äúlack clear-cut ‚Äògold-standard‚Äô COVID-19 testing.‚Äù

But instead classifying tests unsuitable SARS-CoV-2 detection COVID-19 diagnosis, instead pointing virus, proven isolation purification, solid gold standard, Watson claims seriousness that, ‚Äúpragmatically‚Äù COVID-19 diagnosis itself, remarkably including PCR testing itself, ‚Äúmay best available ‚Äògold standard‚Äô.‚Äù scientifically sound.

***Apart fact downright absurd take PCR test part gold standard evaluate PCR test, distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19.***.

And distinctive specific symptoms COVID-19, COVID-19 diagnosis ‚Äî contrary Watson‚Äôs statement ‚Äî cannot suitable serving valid gold standard.

In addition, ‚Äúexperts‚Äù Watson overlook fact virus isolation, i.e. unequivocal virus proof, gold standard.

Now question is: required first virus isolation/proof? need know RNA PCR tests calibrated comes from.

**Particle purification** ‚Äî i.e. separation object everything else object, instance Nobel laureate Marie Curie purified 100 mg radium chloride 1898 extracting tons pitchblende ‚Äî ***is essential pre-requisite proving existence virus, thus prove RNA particle question comes new virus.***

The reason PCR extremely sensitive, means detect even smallest pieces DNA RNA ‚Äî cannot determine particles came from. determined beforehand.

And PCR tests calibrated gene sequences (in case RNA sequences SARS-CoV-2 believed RNA virus), know gene snippets part looked-for virus. know that, correct isolation purification presumed virus executed.

The authors four principal, early 2020 papers claiming discovery new coronavirus concede proof origin virus genome viral-like particles cellular debris, pure impure, particles kind. ***In words, existence SARS-CoV-2 RNA based faith, fact***.

This actually means one cannot conclude RNA gene sequences, scientists took tissue samples prepared mentioned vitro trials PCR tests finally ‚Äúcalibrated,‚Äù belong specific virus ‚Äî case SARS-CoV-2.

In addition, ***there scientific proof RNA sequences causative agent called COVID-19.***

In order establish causal connection, one way other, i.e. beyond virus isolation purification, would absolutely necessary carry experiment satisfies four Koch‚Äôs postulates. experiment.

In words, even theoretically assume PCR tests really detect viral infection, tests would practically worthless, would cause unfounded scare among ‚Äúpositive‚Äù people tested.

In [‚ÄúCDC 2019-Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic file March 30, 2020, example, says:

Detection viral RNA may indicate presence infectious virus 2019-nCoV causative agent clinical symptoms‚Äù

And:

***This test cannot rule diseases caused bacterial viral pathogens.‚Äù***

And the[ FDA admits results \[‚Ä¶\] rule bacterial infection co-infection viruses. agent detected may definite cause disease.‚Äù*** Maybe read title thread. I‚Äôm failing college online classes. boring. absolutely help don‚Äôt understand subject. PAYING basically watch YouTube videos. professor reads PowerPoint it. boring. feelings.

The US government issue called pandemic response.

And evidence lying. evidence understanding situation evolving.

You may attribute evolution something nefarious lying certainly cannot prove it.

And suggest millions sick dying people, maybe there's pressing goddam issue. remember press conference people bunch major chains talking coronavirus? Maybe unrelated. Maybe not. Florida man: ""Hold beer."" missed part says minimum. I‚Äôd like see numbers bracketed age groups. I‚Äôm sorry term ‚Äúyoung adults‚Äù ever meant people 50. Young adult always meant teens twenties.

/s Personally stopped posting sub little bit comments kept getting auto deleted. also got sick ‚Äúthis sub wants world end trolls‚Äù. Almost every comment tons people complaining d00mers actual d00mer posts got really old. trolls seem calmed little posts don‚Äôt get deleted anymore. Regarding politicization masks: get here, get past this? *laughs american* True, remember refused declare pandemic, believe said pandemic even term use   60+ people crowding bars clubs? live Florida it‚Äôs literal paradise. Clear waters, white sands, endless craft breweries, great weather. feel sorry people like can‚Äôt find good things life. Phew, luckily closed ONE FUCKING WEEKEND! know it‚Äôll gone weekend anyway open beaches back up! We‚Äôre even uncertain keeps creating new strains mutating.....people got initial shock... agree. pandemic ongoing issue long time undoubtedly problems systems procedures need addressing, especially early on.

 Honest mistakes, lapses judgment, faulty tests, simple clerical errors paperwork mixups, miscommunication people/departments, quarantine/testees ignoring/breaking rules, providing false information. Shit happens!

It's tough problem manage. Mistakes made. done well date NZ's success easily rates top couple percent countries worldwide.

She perfect is? Look rest worlds leaders' results. could hell lot worse her.

Who would rather could choose one them? need announcing soon want avoid tourist crowd weekend. Pretty sure announcements south Florida meant make people change vacation plans. sad. infections ticked quickly early May deaths kept decreasing. took full month Iran started reporting increasing number daily deaths record high. People never stop underestimating lag effects pandemic. 3000 people critical condition means deaths likely keep increasing time. Thanks input link. Interesting reading. assumption.

Just wear fucking mask. hard. WEAR FUCKING MASK. NEED DUDE COLLAR CHARGED EVENTUALLY MOLESTING KNOWS MANY CHILDREN TELL THIS. Kinda like mass protests streets. Everyone support that. remember March people saying ""if can't survive business without revenue 2 weeks bigger problems""

People idea small businesses operate, assume every business stockpile inventory cash. Travel bans effective

Not already uncontrolled community spread throughout country. one really bad decision couple Novembers ago that's still paying shit dividends. agree one sided thing, something like masks become politicized means likely believe effectiveness wearing mask? hyper-polarized news networks - likely take virus seriously - someone watching CNN &amp; MSNBC someone watching Fox News tried downplay virus while? definitely people know sides political aisle taking seriously, people sides taking seriously - guarantee skews one way lot other, based way things politicized. Cash close dependent variety factors. everyone‚Äôs experience created equal here. I‚Äôm buying home speak. cash close around 24K 8K payment.

But yeah let's talk deaths, too. looked today deaths look like? I‚Äôve playing ‚Äúremind me‚Äù game people two months. 

Look chart. cases jumped 7-800 per day 2 - 3k per day... jump deaths?

Now cases jumped well 5k per day (nearly 10k) even small increase deaths doesn‚Äôt correspond 10x increase daily cases.

Stop thinking cases = outcome. don‚Äôt. 

Also consider every Floridian tested yesterday you‚Äôd likely 20-50k positive. Would change view fractional (incomplete) case count means? Yes. point .. money retirement. money going away. market wins, win ... take buy new car .. winning nevertheless.

BTW, penalty suspended pandemic.

Many regions stepping efforts detect corona virus.

- contact trace much can, says Lisa Labb√© Sandelin, infection control physician Kalmar County.

In early June, uncontrolled spread corona virus broke G√§llivare municipality. Soon LKAB's mine Malmberget could identified site infection started. 

Similar clusters contagion reported several parts Sweden pandemic. origins included villa party Stockholm , pea soup lunch Kalmar Vr√•ng√∂ Gothenburg's southern archipelago.

It hoped similar cases discovered number regions expand infection tracking. done parallel number covert tests increased following agreement government Sweden's municipalities regions (SKR). 

Earlier, DN stated Public Health Authority received assignment government terms testing infection wounds. authority support active work regions national function. 

Work detect prevent spread corona virus Sweden varied ongoing pandemic. number cases detected still relatively few, healthcare system able put large resources positive test response.

Lisa Labb√© Sandelin, infection control physician Kalmar County, says could call inform travelers buses Austria infected persons traveled with. 

- followed daily almost 14 days. became almost unsustainable. March, Stockholm signaled go along.


Since then, regions forced prioritize resources heavily mainly focused patients staff healthcare sector. now. 

Region Kalmar one several regions building central infection tracking team doctors, nurses medical secretaries. idea able streamline work finding origin infection prevent spreading further. 

- exciting. started little already working routines this. infected much only, ‚Äùsays Lisa Labb√© Sandelin.

However, able dig deep case beginning pandemic. 

- Gradually end good level. think able call fever day 14 days. still expanding compared before. open many get many cases try more. 

Even Norrbotten Region , infection tracking centralized. Barbro Nilsson one 15 people staff unit extended sample response handling. 

After professional life district nurse midwife, retired two years ago. region expanded tests public, new tracking unit started, started working again. 

- said could come days week, since started worked full time. Yesterday went home half past seven. thought, says, points feels good meaningful make effort. 

For covid-19, call takes 7 30 minutes. Together infected person, goes symptoms, housing work situation thereby tries assess others risk becoming infected.

- ask if, example, party someone close period fell ill. business, completely impossible infect everyone time, ‚Äùshe says. 

Much responsibility falls tested person call around tell test response people vicinity. asked pay attention symptoms test needed. 

If someone refuses cooperate, Infection Protection Act clear. 

- get picked isolated. extremes. aware that. problem. Everyone busy, says. 

Region G√§vleborg, Region V√§sterbotten Region Blekingen also announced increase infection tracking, writes L√§kartidningen . Similar measures considered affected regions Stockholm V√§stra G√∂taland, yet implemented them. 

#How infection tracking works:

When person tested covid-19, / receives fact sheet / doctor instructions avoid spreading infection. 

 

It states that, according Infection Protection Act, necessary necessary protect others infection. Among things, one avoid meeting people living one's household. 

 

If, analysis, test response proves positive, responsible physician, person special medical competence, call sampled person call. Together, try find symptoms arose people met period.

 

Thereafter, cases, individual contact persons concerned inform infected encourage others pay attention symptoms test needed. trying argue, set disappointment case. learned lesson hard way last time. Especially time around imagine feeling would worse time around. second native Hoosier. cafes, bars restaurants open since 1st June Netherlands mandated mask wearing.


Result: Four weeks later new daily cases still decreasing trend lowest since mid-March despite huge increases testing since then. You‚Äôve gotta research play blame game. work nursing home community that‚Äôs full story.

First, nursing home resident sick covid experiencing mild symptoms, fair hold hostage hospital person wants return home nursing home? long keep locked for? They‚Äôre people too. Would want held hospital?

Second, nursing homes given strict protocols adhere to. many cases outside staff brought covid, known hospital positives.

I even give basic round numbers community:

550 residents total maybe 1000 staff.

60 sick residents since start covid 
11 passed away 
20 currently ill.
The rest recovered.

50 sick staff.
No deaths. There‚Äôs data virus hasn‚Äôt around year. way know long term effects anyone yet  No, aren‚Äôt certain 100% proven coronavirus. Also, would appear single sample? That‚Äôs spreads Joe Diffie John Prine :(

Unfortunately parents 50s getting hotel room nearby stay aunt uncle. also went two weeks ago going restaurants without masks -_- like goddamnit guys, current family situation remind awful idea losing parent is?

Local Florida governments things mandating masks major metro areas, closing beaches, restricting large events, etc. Also, Florida recently closed bars rolled restaurants back 50% capacity. know sometime next week going effective enough. study : 

*The sensitivity, specificity 79% (27/34) 100% (48/48) initial RT-PCR 77% (26/34) 96% (46/48) chest CT.* 

Sensitivity : test positive patients disease 79%

Specifcity : test negative patients without disease 100% small study, ergo false positives study citing.

Ergo get 50-60% false positives from???

Also NCBI doesnt publish anything. library collecting published studies. impossible tell group transmitted virus

Says you. experts seem think otherwise. United Airlines, letting Americans united covid.

In first class provide covid patient's masks lick. Many office jobs, even underpaid thankless ones, offer 401k matching percent. job definitely jump basically free money (i.e., put $100 per month company also puts $100). know even saving $100 hard even $20 gets free $20, plus grows long term.  healthy people asymptomatic? studies people pre-existing health conditions still know carrier? 

I'm someone childhood pneumonia. left open getting hay fever, allergies, colds. rely inhaler normally get sick I'm still curious people underlying conditions carry virus not.

Young people die severely hurt life covid too. Especially prevalence obesity America, one worst combo economy plummeting 

Letting people die terrible economy.
Your death loved one's deaths makes economy completely irrelevant.

- belief people gain herd immunity springs epidemiologists, bibles. 

If doctors scientists allowed propose convictions facts, people habit treating convictions facts easiest victims. today doctors scientists, habit treating convictions facts. new absolute priests mankind, fancy abilities deal reality infalible tell everyone else believe, based convictions. 

This creates easy alliance theist atheist cultism. 

The personal convictions high priests matter. matters truth. Truth humans past develop herd immunity new pathogens fast epidemiologists say today, real reason convinced will. Evolving genetic resiliency takes much longer (generations), spread around concentration high people die it. 

 - would trust people position epidemiologists, trust God. lightly tempted fly escalating area place 14-day quarantine low case count, Hawaii, trading single day horrible risk low risk thereafter.

Fortunately poor decision-making skills, online advertised rentals hawaii still expensive even though tourism collapsed I'm expat boy. I'm also poverty, claim be. tagline owning stock seems laughable generation, all.

Anyway, they‚Äôll reverse see projected revenue losses American tourism. ""bailout"" covering expenses still business. airlines quite vocal come Oct massive layoffs bleeding money. Unless govt steps provides additional support really know everyone expects airlines do. Really implement mask requirement probably realistic thing do. Flying plane half capacity plausible. Wife works regional bad hoping job come next year. However, message said, ‚Äústaff harassed, called names, objects liquids thrown them‚Äù enforce mask requirement.

The problem mask mandates they're effective enforced. People likely comply mandates suggestions.

And burden enforcement always falls employees get paid enough deal shit.

And sort thing assigning cops handle. We've already seen mask requirements used disproportionately target communities color. Oh yes, remember well. ""We're gonna herd immunity end April we'll safe everyone want come one worried Swedes visiting we'll immune!"" Facepalm. great shame Trump place sense he's perfect scapegoat everything point.

Maybe want call scientists medical professionals liars using facts given rushed prevent spread 

What rush? saying could take months years since beginning. see there's urgency develop one, every pharmaceutical company planet looks like trying develop one. countries still demand trials testing approval, take months. virus that's known least 7 months way said wear masks helping 

Because social distancing beginning require masks. would need mask, sitting home? would need mask going grocery, people home, avoiding contact people, staying 6ft apart? Scientists going recommend something tested prove effective. medically approved masks tested use medical field, used people years training, scientific, medical knowledge. everyday Joe wanting get haircut, go said enough medical staff,

They said enough medical staff beginning. specifically stated N95 acceptable, untrained people may wear wrong, think thingthey needed do, touch masks, ignore every guideline make things worse.

Now, testing, realize non medical professionals wear types face coverings keep spewing germs viruses over. Making safety precautions still need take effective.

Once testing done, states started talking opening more, recommended even basic masks, along precautions.


 expect way push use vaccine prevent spread leave permanent concenquences people. would that, hiding behind greater good bs.


I expect people refuse right thing continue use random Facebook memes prove right vs listening science understand. ""What, bra, good time?""

Yeah, ok, makes lot sense, thanks. place that‚Äôs using masks showing flattening. ‚ÄúIf ignore virus, go away!‚Äù - politicians behind decision making. happened sick unto death (ironically) people saying this. Please, love god, actually *read* statement Page 6 guidance community mask usage starts.

I understand risk analysis sounds complicated, need grasp organizations like cannot make widespread policy ‚Äú Hong Kong screaming anyone would listen wear mask‚Äù. balance available data benefits (and harms, list nice, convenient bullet points) community masking would provide. saying since *March* least symptomatic persons wear *medical mask*. changes predominantly regarding aerosol precautions *healthcare*, community masking. better understanding infectious period (2 days prior symptom onset) percentage people mild asymptomatic cases. data used entire countries government decision-makers, lot riding statement release. cannot carelessly. Remember ibuprofen debacle? based *Tweets* doctors observational data. data retracted statement, still find people screaming anyone listen ibuprofen kill get disease. Please, try understand difference complex policy decisions ‚Äúthe government lying you‚Äù.  i'm flying rhode island see mom bc seen almost 3 years driving 26 hours alone sound appealing. i'm flying american airlines said masks required a-okay me. believe increase 3 4. said 200 additional covid patients increase 3 4 ICU. bit tough tell without seeing actual numbers.

My understanding ICU's Houston 100% percent standard capacity. Maybe someone ground comment? enters eyes infects sinuses first. correct. Kudos you. Younger people accounting greater proportion positive cases. Fatality lower younger populations. Fatality much higher hitting nursing homes older population mostly r_ed states, too? Yeah, there's smoke, there's fire take fire alarm. Also, know said slow testing....

(also, bots c-ensoring running amok point). Yep. two main scientific bodies people might listen to, CDC WHO, lost credibility many. Politicians louder Fauci mic more. think already is. Yeah, even stock, often enough really make much company stock, companies offer employees never really go anywhere stock value remains pretty insignificant. Fundamentals, meaning future earnings broader context alternative uses cash. Also, says value dollar disappearing? deflation real risk here? suggest value appreciation potential? would investors pick stocks then, unless they're considering value holistic context?

Interest rates Fed behavior part fundamentals. can't separate environment business operates dislike consequences.  swear reading China late last year. get credit it. However, also gets criticism hesitation end. It‚Äôs hard decision make, realize pressure. know playbook now. Italy Spain, New York New Zealand. beat prophylactic measures. beat respecting power attack rate ease spread. mostly rich countries contribute USA far largest rich. would probably fair judge contributions percentage GDP.  suppose idea significantly reduce amount people situations spread likely, even still situations, potentially cut infection rate enough impact. 

Of course, big experiment think anyone knows exactly degree need isolate order keep curve relatively flat, may fail miserably. already failing miserably, places.

There cynics reasons come well course I'm saying they're wrong. Yes City Jacksonville decided issue face-covering mandate, city officials announced Monday afternoon.  order, goes effect 5 p.m. Monday, comes **Mayor Lenny Curry said last week** plans issue face mask mandate.  requirement public indoor locations, city spokeswoman said. also apply situations people socially distance. details immediately released city.  experts advise masks cloth face coverings help slow spread individuals COVID-19 vulnerable populations including asymptomatic,‚Äù said Nikki Kimbleton, Director Public Affairs City Jacksonville. ‚ÄúWe continue urge everybody, please practice personal responsibility, part please help stop spread virus.‚Äù  Elsbury, Chief Staff Mayor Curry, said decision made speaking leaders local hospitals Monday morning.  single day, almost, conversations hospital providers CEOs members community felt time take step,‚Äù Elsbury said.  week, **Curry said plan issue mandatory face mask requirements** despite rising COVID-19 cases Duval County calls residents.  think that‚Äôs prudent action take,‚Äù Curry said June 22. ‚ÄúWe need law enforcement public enforcing this.

Centers Disease Control Prevention began recommending everyone¬†**wears**¬†a face mask public April, federal mandate requiring people so. good, think people always vote can, base point voting help like used to. one person vote worth 1000x someone else's whole thing rigged anyways. quite likely barely escaped worst scenario (World War 3) thanks Trump becoming president. remember well Hillary talking escalating conflict Syria, would've (potentially) led quite lot awful things.

I definitely support Trump, least guy start another war... yet. child pre-existing condition? 

With India producing majority vials world‚Äôs furthest-along vaccine, think country world want risk alienating way idea sad people pathetic sheep

I see shit almost daily. Absolutely. marked 18 april graph deaths Sweden you.

I also helpfully written plateau purple it, purple color think America taking smarter choice going herd immunity? heard death rate dropping, still worry people unknown long term effects non fatal cases. get that, need positivity late, means least think taking seriously justice. need go full blown negative times, government people sucked way virus hit us. Blaming China foundation Trumps messaging thru November.  wonder enforced enforcement almost always problem. shame, America free pay much company health insurance wants us to! /s Lol, yea, highest number cases world still arguing wearing mask. Tell side whatever US does. us USA old news, dealing since NYC, Asian countries could problem. bottom line viral transmission people symptoms documented month half mask recommendation.

 whole family sick planning getting antibody tests.

Anyways, last monday 'woke up'. felt normal. sat bed went ""Huh, that's weird"". I've gotten much done. Movers, painters, coding, etc. etc. think you‚Äôre speculating. obviously are. Neither know anything. point seems cases came Denmark since strain common Sweden didn‚Äôt catch on. 

I don‚Äôt really know mean exactly you‚Äôre trying defend. Schools continuing provide food according we're native Scandinavia, we're foreign minority. 

Sigh, every day learn something new obnoxious Sweden. so... Well, let's leave obnoxious. sorry hear that, surprised.

It true people even basic familiarity S√°mi people know are, say, S√°mi. TBH know much meeting amazing S√°mi environmental activists fighting protect land water Norway. [Sara Marielle Gaup absolutely amazing. 

Ah yes, romanticization yet another form othering. Maybe less hurtful way, still annoying. 

I really hope S√°mi come COVID unscathed despite Sweden's mismanagement! pretty worried start, BC. seemed weren‚Äôt acting quickly enough enough transparency, especially considering happening Seattle. However, must say I‚Äôve quite impressed response overall. Attitudes seemed change quickly. Medical records matter privacy. nothing trying hide outbreak staff. That‚Äôs say work places handling correctly. think lot people don‚Äôt really understand work places don‚Äôt right (and really shouldn‚Äôt be) sharing personal medical information employee.

Edit: it‚Äôs actually illegal states.  Every county adopted masks. There‚Äôs places Europe require public transport, all. graduated jobs field available. Feelsbadman. Gonna make due low paying job things change *sigh*

no financial planner going tell good idea position might sell low point due life emergencies.

remember - financial hardship often happens time stocks go down. ordered twice lowes.. took 5 days cancel pickup order. already took 40 min get online order marked ""ready pickup"" pandemic. Profits people. Pick one. That's carry around trusty halberd go shopping. Yes. 

But don‚Äôt need make fun people concerned potential testing slowdown treat like crazy conspiracy theorists. There‚Äôs valid reason concern there. know sweat like hairy man beast work out. i'm fatty would panting like crazy. refuse put people risk. People damn selfish. Wait actually quote redditor sources fact? research provide sources /u/BiologyJ honestly blindly believe people say without proof? took step forward categorized group ‚Äúpeople‚Äù using quotes imply isn‚Äôt even human shouldn‚Äôt entitled opinion? (Of backed sources *facts*)

Perhaps it‚Äôs think ‚Äúperson‚Äù. Lockdowns move risky behaviors less regulated settings. short term might true, medium long term high case counts destroy businesses, overall economy health. Otherwise, half country rest world stays home.

We get international travel back country levels infection countries. Business going conferences employees travel level infection across country.

NYC especially needs really low cases financial service roles feel comfortable employees office, taking mask transit. Disagree.

I‚Äôve going gym since we‚Äôve allowed so. It‚Äôs Planet Fitness, it‚Äôs local establishment, they‚Äôre taking every precaution world.

Temperature taken door. limit number people working (it‚Äôs appointment only) everyone socially distance (beyond mandated rules). spot-checker ensuring everything wiped properly. disinfect I‚Äôve ever seen. Locker rooms closed. Bathrooms sanitized every hour.

It‚Äôs safe safe be.

Then people asked problem favour getting rid 1.5m rules basically pointed (left/green) leader Amsterdam saying handled situation better.

Right wing parties weird.. least keep shit consistant. I‚Äôm done this.  don‚Äôt think first paragraph correct summary. 60% cases parent sibling covid, 60% cases could tested result contact tracing, ‚Äúworst cases‚Äù. 

38% study participants admitted hospital, ""worst cases"". Young people get sick. Old people dies. meant easy. encouraged spend money manage left essentials stopping people buying plants seedlings online? hardware store RIGHT NOW, END JUNE, ALLOWED OPERATE ESSENTIAL, selling NON ESSENTIAL ITEMS.

I hear gardening stores open lockdowns, essential, another store open extra section requires employees risk sell non-essential stuff?

You're arguing green beans important lives entire families HD Lowe's workers health insurance make enough save take time sick. Look guy, thinking people can't go want. laws made bravado. People need understand 70% herd immunity mean virus stops transmitting. slows down. still careful. Like suggested, probably never garden. many reasons growing eating food better option buying store.

People still transmitting it, evolve we're fucked, reach herd immunity need 60-80% population infected get immunity, even know long immunity lasts. Almost every pandemic recorded human history, black death, Spanish flu, H1N1, 2nd wave, almost them, way worse first, notably Spanish flu. Look what's happening China, seem path 2nd wave, even restrictions. can‚Äôt blame friends Europe. sucks, also think Trump terrible leader don‚Äôt endorse president doesn‚Äôt change fact is. that‚Äôs fair thing lose faith us over. say many us know, working it.

What strategies? locked down, numbers decent, raced open everything boom, numbers skyrocketed. there's choice left masks public indoors. 

And since DeSantis already said we're ""shutting down"", really choice mask-up. worst thing I've seen neck woods woman traders calling ""liberals"" trying make wear mask freaking storming away.  people serious condition hospitals it? much hospital bed US cost again? Yeah, USA traveling:

[YOU] - One extremely common symptoms recovered patient ongoing extreme fatigue. patients problems catching breath talking.

[ME] - permanent disability.

[YOU] - actually often is. breathlessness fatigue irreversible lung damage.

So said ""*extremely common* symptom ongoing fatigue / breath"" ""often"" permanent irreversible.

And dont believe ""permanent irreversible fatigue / loss breath"" extremely common effect lungs remodel degree almost scaring permanent. COVID fact. lung fact.

Sure. lung scarring equal kind disability. People damage lungs *all time* (smoking) dont live ""disabled"" life it.

My point Covid causes kind noticeable permanent lung damage, visible microscope, different ""People live permanent damage Covid problem know frequent infrequent is. extensively studied it, patients difficult find

My guess ""not frequent"", patients would difficult find.

My issue scaremongering. Yes, cases seem come Covid serious effects. doesnt seem common *at all* would visibility it, among recovered Covid patients. Maybe first, seems opposite. Young, mild/asymptomatic cases going socializing, bad symptoms either home hospitals adequate precautions place. RNC convention going best greatest best convention evaaaaahh! seriously miss Hooting Hollering health care workers. Ever since city stopped it, I've felt deep sadness. **need** bring back Stupid man. happens over. Price gouging pandemic? Anyone know charged export free research? whoa whoa whoa look who's fucking fancy riding around F250. us prefer sliding webbed penises sisters back rusted ram1500 Inflation explained simply measuring money supply. matter velocity, too. money supply could double today, people overwhelmingly horde new cash, inflation happen. 

Anyway, dramatic decline stock prices easily predicted like suggest, investors would rush sell. Obviously happening. fact, there's already trillions cash waiting invest something, despite stock prices recovered nicely.

The future totally unpredictable new. That's always true. rate, I'm simply saying reasons market behaving certain way likely complicated understand. Based writing, get impression sophisticated understanding subject. Technically yes. asymptomatic people spreading sea... Ugh. routinely confronted work sweeping statements co-workers undermine severity epidemic. 

Things like, ‚Äúliterally every illness similar symptoms Covid categorized such. Flu pneumonia even without testing,‚Äù ‚Äúevery death listed Covid hospitals families get money financial incentive report that.‚Äù new favorite, ‚Äúwe‚Äôre reporting Covid due high testing. It‚Äôs skewing results showing people countries aren‚Äôt reporting.‚Äù 

How counter narratives unverifiable, able empower someone sweepingly dismiss validity reporting data? Tampa proper trending younger. Hillsborough one top counties Florida young adults Orange, Alachua, Leon. Surrounding areas snowbirds though. Pasco, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte counties among oldest state. Oh please. full shit think going gym get gains right responsible ""accept risk"". things said going bars getting haircut look Florida Texas.

Nobody gives two shit putting risk. fact get sick put others around risk. level self entitled selfishness come from? really think ""gains"" valuable overall health society ? Fuck off.  grocery store work stockers (a people I) take cases food put food inside cases smaller plastic bags labels put shelf. call ‚Äúbreaking down‚Äù cases. this, haven‚Äôt always wearing masks breathing within couple feet lot times directly exposed food. One person, might might broken cases past weeks may may worn mask (I can‚Äôt remember), tested positive coronavirus. pull food breathed shelf? needs federal crime people charged named.

Their mug shots names need go website criminal record. period .com read it. thread showing care number deaths, absurd. yes, human beings dying serious consequence virus, human beings suffering horrendously, suffering permanent lung nerve damage, unable contribute economy simultaneously draining society resources quite serious scary.

Plus, seem ignoring catastrophic effects exponential growth, daily new case counts currently portend. Exponential growth leads overwhelmed healthcare systems beds run medical professionals get infected incapacitated. Even exponential growth among young people inevitably lead growth among old people. lead increase deaths.

Fear actually important here. Fear keeps people home. Fear makes people want follow rules. fear makes politicians act quickly enact measures protect constituents. Sure, people site fear mongers even derive substantial pleasure it. think failing see Florida *needs* fear right now. gloves took soon left bathroom put new ones never known perosn stock, really except parents' friends. love reddit clickbait makes sound like everyday thing. Yes did. Conveniently forgot address praised Texas Florida‚Äôs response back May. Well, I‚Äôm parent school age children, elementary school teacher. We‚Äôre probably going back school fall. young children likely miss YEAR school. Partly many Americans cannot distinguish difference essential nonessential, many don‚Äôt believe get sick spread many others know it, places like restaurants gyms. Anyone must living rock know that. Meu pao de queijo üò≠ One thing hospital learned early go beyond keep people home. county hospital poor, predominantly PR Latin community. worries people flooding ED. set multilingual hotline someone come us sent staff swab them. help national guard assist that. positive worked churches community leaders deliver food toiletries needed it. pharmacies shut went 100% delivery mail service.

It's great response, I'm proud hospitals leadership. Yeah impeach Trump he'll learn lesson.

That every works bought ""vintage"" ('85) Toyota Mini-Motorhome less $3,000. live full time parked mom's yard. get benefits living back home, plus privacy place. realize requires rather specific set circumstances (like initial funds purchase tiny house yard large, level parking area) may reasonable option people--but make work, honestly perfect set-up weather unemployment/Corona crisis. üñ§ Short - trump fuck up. pay. layman's term, ETF (exchange traded fund) stock tracks bunch stocks. example SPY tracks 500 American companies (from Apple Domino's Pizza). companies grow, SPY.

r/personalfinance probably best jumping point. sincerely doubt ever say it. Donald Trump Russian agent assignment kill many Americans possible destroy United States America. airports linked huge outbreaks? Honestly tens thousands people still flying I'd think even higher numbers outbreaks linked airports that. bet hurt local vs imported cases, honey, read headline  Most?! small vocal minority. aren‚Äôt white either. People races aren‚Äôt immune stupidity. nationwide mandate. Good counties part. Florida's economy hot rn they've wide open. Getting sick hurts economy doctors take Hippocratic Oath. people‚Äôs livelihoods would likely suffer product becomes unavailable due health restrictions?

Like say university class instructor available zoom she‚Äôs arbitrarily worried 3 train commute despite city reopening plenty others without hitch?

Or impact livelihoods necessary proles bourgeoisie? Well, Trump administration butchered everything get go. 

However, wrong say federal government screwed everything start, ""the start"" really goes back SARS outbreak 2002-2003. article goes detail looking federal government, leadership George W. Bush Barack Obama, actually put together extremely effective system pandemic response, including early warning systems, public-health cooperation nations, procedures containing outbreak original host nation and, failed, stopping spread US. Trump loyalists threw away careful preparation. 

That's point article. enough say, ""yeah, Trump administration failed 120,000 Americans died"". case much powerful compare quality preparations *two* previous administrations put place dealing pandemic incompetence actual federal response pandemic finally materialized. political comment! idiotic. Closing night clubs, churches conventions deal this, physical distance (never understood term social distancing) shops general deal rest test + trace pick slack family contamination. concerned stall door locks, germy shit I‚Äôve said decades student loans easy get. everyone needs goto college. school system colleges need stop preying people. think majority education could moved online. Things value bc agree value. society always agreed value things numbers people. nothing stopping us deciding change value. Perhaps beginning that. Probably not. Agree! liked too. went trades. housing crash many 'good' jobs around. Mostly 'fired hit ground types'. thousands us scrambling work time. went maintenance. 

Maintenance pay well unless willing live work. even worth supply tools. end stuck forever debt income ratio turns shit. Even find house afford, job goes away 'on call'. 

Never ever work live location unless okay someone slave 24/7. Hospitals nuts. Sure, cash payments better $6000 difference? still believe it. emergency C-section 10 years ago, total bill came $16,000 (after insurance discounts) 10 pages. went charges (Operating Room, doctors, anesthesiologist) worst thing found $4 ibuprofen tablet get month's supply price pharmacy today. 

It standard industry practice Hospitals overcharge cover patients ""reduce rates"" cover cannot pay (elderly, broke, illegals etc.) leads unreasonable pricing bills. patient 3 options:-

Option 1: Pay bill full insurance, afford it.

Option 2: Call billing people. Provide paystubs proof income (Social Security etc). Sincerely tell responsible WANT work them, really can't limited income cannot possibly enough pay bill. bill high enough, threaten file bankruptcy. cases lead reduction bill reasonable (longer time) payment plan hospital always views less money better money.

Option 3: **last resort**. really cannot pay hospital negotiate payment plan, get finances i.e. stop paying maxed credit cards!&lt; actually file bankruptcy, especially hospital sells medical debt 3rd party provider. Medical debt single largest cause bankruptcy, shame file reason. Nobody going look person declare bankruptcy $1 million cancer $250k heart surgery bills. 

Consequences: bankruptcy wipe debt ***except IRS Student Loan debt***. possessions (house, etc.) liquidated order satisfy creditors, order priority. Bankruptcy stays financials (credit report) least 7 years. However, aware this, high chance certain hospitals doctors treat future non ER situation. Legally ERs treat everyone that's bills high. Pretty sure hospitals keep database non-payers private use, whatever may be.

Considering COVID hopsital bills coming out, sure bunch patients may forced bankruptcy future, especially patients ICU 2 weeks. severe case, higher bill. Shit happens sometimes. Really, understand that. I've losses, I've gains. gains losses far think I'm pretty average. 
If play can't win. assuming thoughtful, conservative investments line risk tolerance. 

Life full tough choices. get savings account paying 0.01% buy AT&amp;T pay dividend 7%
Man go get money. completely discounts chance stock price going too. Lived parents 27 think. Paid college loans within years, saved 20% payment house, best decision ever made. helped smart cool parents. I'm immigrant, completely different mindset average American. tend think wallets. Hey ooooh! checked 401k recently? 20% 5% year. already recovered   They're heavily progressive, regardless alignment info sourcing solid. inadvertently biased, definitely conservative publishers read listen well. Data data facts undisputable neighborly you. hope new neighbors end good friendship. :) communities Indians frequently travel USA -- New York, Boston, San Francisco -- done that, threaten progress. Tech workers wait months. kill them. move Tampa Bay Area. Also, census information 20 years date... little thing called COVID going around making people unemployed, stocks rich people get richer rest us squirm around dirt  touched door lock gloves touched penis, might want consider STD testing also bc experience different invalidate mine someone lives places would go frequent would different yours. article linked support ‚Äúevidence‚Äù all. study linked even comparing remdesivir control group. simply describing happened cohort patients severe coronavirus given remdesivir. Again, control group study.

The main evidence point indicating remdesivir reduce time recover coronavirus, impact mortality unclear. See following Even though combines 2 days, still concerning. desperately need mask MANDATE instead guidance.  Airwolf says hi makes even less sense COVID since AFAIK HIV/AIDS spread coughing COVID is. funding issues.

It prepared control pandemic CHSLD (province's subsidized health care seniors). mostly people 70-80 age places, mortality skyrocketed up.

Tests remained free available people required it.

ICU remained 25% usage since beginning pandemic.

Also, calculation death count probably severe current US method. I'm Chicago restaurants allowed open 25% 50 max capacity. pressed city would move phase 5, governor stated he's moving forward there's vaccine. Desantis didn‚Äôt anything.. state department oversees things stopped bars selling alcohol (they stay open, can‚Äôt sell alcohol).

Desantis literally nothing. press conference yesterday said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt stop young people young people do.‚Äù

It feels like we‚Äôre thrown wolves.

And, no, didn‚Äôt vote him. 100% humidity actually raining snowing. Don‚Äôt know stock market investors rational type investors always known make shrewd investments? Lol really wish governor would see happening states cancel opening bars visiting assisted living homes today. Ky good people protested think scared close again. describing life-saving care extremely inelastic demand, price little effect whether someone want it. 

and yes, ""free market"" breaks situations. GOP convention moved Moscow.  Seems could start saving cutting city part. Working 40 hour weeks country desire good times cost money. I'm happy enough home able relax. guess cities probably easy sit back porch chill seeing got traffic noise. Brazil better health infrastructure. undercounting far, far worse India.  Save America! Wear mask, wash hands, socially distance! 

-The US govt PSA campaign plastered media platforms. ok, I'm going stop talking this. advocating bad financial advice, could mess people bad advice. Please stop giving bad information, lets end conversation now. Yeah, agree businesses rainy day fund rainy day. But, isn‚Äôt rainy day, it‚Äôs great flood end sight. one planned knew pandemic would happen would close everything. beautiful sight haha. Yea taught wear n95s doctor. even surgical mask n95 precaution. wear glasses gives eyes protection Lenny care RNC coming here. He's trying avoid pressure cancel due spiking numbers. COVID19 also infiltrated county jail due one sick doctor. Vaccines DRM. Got it. Science article also looks like difficult define with30% reporting corporate dividing funds government v business. changed considerably. wish better numbers. I'm good there. Far comfortable spending money highly stressful financially trying times watching free light show instead. already US. Idiots gonna idiot making lost time apparently. Texas getting hammered, finally starting really hit rural areas south - TN, one county went 5-8 cases per day 50-80+ per day took couple weeks get there, got lot people wearing masks smaller communities. crazy. get they‚Äôll calling fish sympathy, like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt feel BAD caught virus NOWHERE? victim‚Äù Nah, giant hungry sharks follows pattern influenza. people congregate closed quarters, spreads. us that‚Äôs winter, AZ, that‚Äôs summer air conditioning time. Right dude finds necessary live Tampa area I'm made place. hate beach hate bars. Luckily wife much worry comes scene, like said plenty wanna that, locals tourists, go Publix breath food.

I really wish everyone would take shit seriously. Yes, stuck home kinda sucks (I actually mind usually) cant stay home months we're gonna end staying home years.

I'm homebody general I've 3 state vacations cancelled year already. I've behaved. stay inside. wear mask go store. sucks us still punished others can't stay inside weeks refuse believe real issue Agreed including diminishes entire graph. Honestly great question politicians. Like said want sides safe fed. would sad landlords started losing properties human compassion humans. Also housing options thats also terrible us renters. 

The state world especially country gives great sadness. 

I personal perspective tenant usually makes wonderful income unfortunately everyone home unemployed. want 1 year old sleeping car, afford?? absolutely not. wouldnt want you. landlord. 

All saying besides thinking utilities, deposit, wear tear, think human struggling. focusing money items. time focus human. right, it‚Äôs ironic things weren‚Äôt really great Good point, it‚Äôs even officially approved EUA. Younger Millenials college never saw issue older lot something. fact reddit hates clickbait references clickbait articles defense well, guess shocking. think wants job anymore. Like US, UK conservative, rather obtuse, leader.  Right that's confused person said closed cause hardware stores essential FDA control drug pricing. I'm fine source too, around southeast work well term ""boom"" relative here. Italy second oldest population world exceptionally low birth rate. hospital four times normal number births one day made news exceptional event. outdoor concert? Can't access article, read somewhere 2/3 concert goers wore masks.

If thats true, concern? told covid spread BLM protests. equivalent BLM protest? 

If many people showed BLM protest holding signs, would criticism? Arizona alike Anton Chekhov play, know going end tragedy can't stop watching. Special sauce ""Inaccuracy"" meaning order magnitude. sound like uninformed child talk passionately topics clueless about.

""In fantasy universe landlords make millions dollars year free landlord immoral"" clearly see lesser.

Another hateful statement.

Where say ""less"", anyway?

My argument forcing landlords shoulder burden without relief unjust. Either let economy run course (not good, fair) step offer rent relief.

Deliberately tying hands landlords without relief unfair. Hi CCP! things China? Yeah well, charts say all. Netherlands single digit dead per day, sometimes zero. even Germany say that, 7-8 times population Netherlands (and meat packing one factory responsible almost 20% current active cases Germany problem factory. chances casual contact near zero known cases tracked whole families go enforced quarantine.

By ""tracked"", really mean it. I've pub twice recent weeks last couple games Bundesliga season. Masks gloves required, fill form name, date, address, phone number, number table sat at, aprox time arrival departure pub.

You think we're taking seriously Western Europe? doctors pictures taped bodies make patients comfortable? Tell made cry fuss drug effective? I'd die spot there. Protecting people gym people come contact with. contagious infect someone gym person goes infects someone gym wanting take risk work go get groceries. thanks! think NPR terrible source though planet living on? wonder could lockdowns create kind pressure. Mild cases stay home isolated spread. Severe cases go crowded hospitals spreads hospital staff non covid patients. AC means Attack Choppers Fabio mastermind LMAO Facebook comments Amazon, Lowe's, Home Depot three places checked back ordered. life moves on...normal life involves taking calculated risks every single day. Risks unemployment mental/physical health deterioration must also considered. 

Wearing mask crowds brainer. Anything else personal choice. Ugly American stereotype while.  expect rebound. botching current reopenings, leaders ensured everyday folk little faith future reopenings, thereby guaranteeing permanently reduced economic activity there's cure. Watch insurance premiums shoot next year.

Another reason need universal health insurance. Yes! damn seagulls.. tourist learns everyone already knows: one sea gull calls 50 friends, swarm. keep feeding them, they‚Äôll literally shit you, stuff, Floridian foolish enough sit next tourist beach. üòÇ Oh, Allegiant. want see one fuckers made sign waiver, DNR rejection ventilator support. Also basic science make pharmaceutical industry R&amp;D costs...running large clinical trials way expensive basic science. 

It may true R&amp;D budgets small compared marketing, reason companies engage marketing generates profit. 

I mind government would ban many forms pharmaceutical marketing though. lost ability smell taste got coronavirus little week ago now. I‚Äôve seen many articles claim people may never able regain senses either back 100%. chance regain them, would start come back, all? people? people that? sound racist friendo saying sound insightful. clearly calmly reminding people politicians denial. That's WHO's job. course are....'Merica!! weeks ago. There's Walmart fistfights *daily* wearing mask store. 3 rent-a-cops entrance. comment specific generalizing country continent. Europe kinda big didn‚Äôt realize run differently over. place handled COVID should‚Äôve US outshined everyone poor pandemic handling sadly know what, think world always USA best prepared pandemic, mostly CDC takes almost mythical quality infectious disease super heroes. 

What least never really considered impact private health care would pandemic. fact people charged money tested Corona fucking insanity me. Like, society best protected people get tested, understand extent problem, work resolve it. Instead people pay cash pocket get tested? can't possibly good idea. Never vocalize complaints internet! aren‚Äôt going immediately change entire life fix complaint don‚Äôt complain! 

You‚Äôre silly. People allowed gripe. Every Scottish person shakes head Loch Conservative race. 

But get it. Reading strong suit.  think landlords able afford landlord? jobs actually cost money. front money front brunt risk losing home everything own. like renter, worse. beach boring I‚Äôd rather boat Miami No, capable critical thinking. u/bla_bla_bla69 count 17,000 today wanted remind illusory correlation experienced need go Florida Refuted posted two graphs ""daily new cases""? saying? would terrible India denied world drugs simply countries imposed travel bans. recommend India that, given India far less powerful China, EU, U.S. -- suppose could make poor decision. considered stock analysis written.
