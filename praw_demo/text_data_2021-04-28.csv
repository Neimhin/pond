0,2021-04-28," set goals going meet. way win even start. Biden done repeatedly vaccine X day goals. sets knows stuff place way exceed ""goals."" auto wins. Ending mask mandates indoors 2021 mistake IMO. mandate lifted it‚Äôs almost impossible put back place may need fall winter. Testing metric worth much. know people obsess raw number tests.  long wait get flu shot COVID vaccine?  top head, sounds like city's ratio well.

I think true case small cities, especially 200+ km away coast, state always extreme difficulty providing significant infrastructure far population centers. anyone surprised? CDC conservative guidelines. also say wear sunscreen every time go outside never eat meat well done.

technically bad advice people live lives like that. Great them. oh shit yea work public. 

Out roughly 30-40 fellow employees, 1 also wears KN95/N95 place plain cloth. 

They're cheap kn95 ones really comfortable.   really think people underestimate Twitters detriment society. really know effective vaccines reducing transmission, especially variants. good 100%. don‚Äôt mind wearing mask work, public, host wants to. wearing mask party ‚Äúsmall gathering‚Äù going anything? danger comes touching infected surface touching mouth, eyes, nose. seems really dumb me. Obviously I‚Äôm masks public though. stupid. took long get everyone use mask? wait people vaccine make masks non mandatory.

As is, people wearing work 'because mandatory anymore"". I've mostly stayed inside big deal look figured they'd better other's hands. right though Bruh nobody wants wear mask bar concert lol  vaping lol New Yorker, I'm happy we're getting better better could people getting vaccinated though Baaaaaa Really? we're going follow CDC guidelines social distancing? Would also support insurers penalizing overweight people

Yes Theres lot places people going Fd up. good voted dollars went somewhere sane.

If everyone would financially support insane asylums wed better off. right, great place misinformation pulled directly rectum Yeah first dose like 100% Rangers game still like 25% stadium lol Exactly!

If someone want get vaccinated - problem people got vaccines. 

This king crap keeps people getting vaccinated - see restrictions eased vaccinated folks say what's point likely skip vaccine. entire stretch road basically public bathroom. God bless Rocky's Greenbush Bakery though PPE shortage like year dude.


And even that, long hoarding, much right everyone else. bought P100 full face mask February 2019. 

If CDC lied us masks, might wearing them. Thanks üôèüèª Yes. 

Remember, UNVACCINATED people wind hospital. Heck, unvaccinated people even gotten infected COVID year. 

So figure effective vaccine is, compare control group gotten vaccine. control group fine, too. look difference see vaccine's effect. Yeah right. guess occurred it'd fine buy ppe shortage. mask protect dining multiple families?!?! sitting talking eating mask on. joke right? LuL buddy adults act like adults.
The whole world watching guys throwing tantrums Walmart many can't keep breathable fabric face. That's adult drop testing problem. really need keep testing levels high move towards reopening fewer restrictions. I'm thinking I'm getting around one thousand false positives. Though I'm unique setting. seen three positives last month clearly active infection . already Covid fully vaccinated. limits vaccine known far length maybe people feel okay things too. idk city 575k 52 clinics (UBS). would 1 per 11k. 

(Not counting UPA, Hospitals clinics). 197 vaccinated people died far covid. pretty good considering like 100 million vaccinated really know good vaccines are, they'll work mutations. 

But can't honest people else follow you. Also, discard maks everyone vaccinated.

Better keep flu season. race

Bait alert Absolute hogwash. precisely zero places world capable ""creating vaccine own"" already it. supply chain available support it, would take many years build out.

You can't plop warehouse, mix ingredients together, start producing vaccine. multi-national conglomerates expert struggling build supply chains. India, world's largest vaccine supplier, Serum Institute trying produce Oxford/AstraZeneca's easier-to-make vaccine, operating much capacity, supplies.

Merck going start producing Johnson Johnson's vaccine contract, start shipping vaccine mid-2022.

It's really incredible world's best effort history combat novel contagion, wildly successful effort never seen, still people looking villains. meant ""your"" anyone acting like Maybe workers higher risk vaccinated. could get real mask. 

An N95 KN95 mask actually protect you. 

It's perfect better fashionable pieces garbage cloth 99% people wear. Funny, sounds like bottle return credit. doubt lower available weeks them. also expect hesitancy younger age group. Also whose going go bother get tested getting vaccine? 

I even bother get tested first time thought it. took 4 days test another 3 get results back. Lot good did. pharmacist told person scheduled week.

I guess poured rest vial vax drain. Sad! training health-related field. 

Now, theory blood clots seen J&amp;J AZ vaccines partially influenced getting injection blood vessel, may gotten blood vessel. 

However, rest assured 1) case Pfizer, 2) theory probably either wrong, perfect confluence many factors along blood vessel thing cause clotting hundreds millions doses give, significant portion would blood vessel count problems fingers. 

In short, I'm doctor, worried all. Like, all.  neighborhood there's clinic

Or multiple. know of, two within 10 minute walk house. Brazil excellent healthcare system. massively underfunded inneficiently run, everything country. It‚Äôs obviously going vary true everybody, people know gotten within last 6 months-they social distance, wear mask, double mask, etc. family members refuse wear mask still sneeze hands? Nothing. mentioned (in many fewer words) another comment. makes laugh you‚Äôre vaccinated, chance breakthrough case really, really small. April 20, 2021, 87 million people United States fully vaccinated number vaccine breakthrough infections reported CDC: 7,157 Maybe ever get substantial data shows vaccinated people pose risk spreading infections. know vaccinated people low risk getting sick; there's also low risk transmission vector, think would reason wear mask. difference bit theatre actually difference bit theatre ~~actually works~~ run different multi-billion dollar industry ones want us constantly fear airborne terrorists school shootings.

A half-assed lock gave us half-assed result half population take seriously that.  BRB, going Detroit round folks lug vaccine sites. bar near shut slammed fees food substantial enough! ridiculous problem, even stated rules read. Kind embarrassing actually, turns submited accidentally sub noticed. also prepared submit UK sub turns load draft submission Rif app limit drafts sub time notice absence UK clicking submit. previously setup draft sub double checked rules abandoned idea. short apparently read rules submission. Seriously, what's point getting vaccinated still required wear mask? get fired say no. almost like whole thing farce society care economic social implications rather healthcare. 

We kept mcdonalds open whole pandemic. tell everything need know. ima keep real chief. soon nurse starts getting ready look way, know large small needles past 10 years. One time college put frozen uncrustable microwave FIVE minutes immediately took bite took microwave. Worst burn life. Can't trust drunk person uncrustable üòÇüòÇüòÇ think many states able reach herd immunity skepticism, unfortunately. say reopen eventually lead many unnecessary deaths.

Antivax = Murder ...because virus vaccines - train immune system recognize virus prompt faster response additional exposures - virus damage process. scientific data back already established knowledge immunity works infection, backs reason always annoyed frustrated people would catch COVID run get vaccine afterwards, effectively denied another person protection earlier - already protection future infection. blame people, since governments still pegging reopening based vaccinations, can't expect every layperson versed every aspect medical science, people probably want get plane point future; personal problem resource like vaccines utilized full potential, case potentially resulting slightly infections, deaths, longer time return normal. uh, probably see I'd little annoyed this. hell stupidity...  courtesy waitstaff, putting mask approach table.

If really cared there. Bruh, reddit. dissertation. Come man, many studies shown amazingly effective pfizer vaccine is. Even variants different demographics, efficacy incredible. Look think going overwhelm hospitals? Children US mature adults certain segment society. People spectrum complain anyone else! fully agree you, trying get /u/darkfuryelf think it, since comment implies *no* risk spread vaccinated people. data showing fully vaccinated people spread implies data showing spread covid well. Thus, cautions still need taken data available. lets real - anti-vax people listening CDC messages. 

Instead, lets give 10 free Powerball lottery tickets people get vaccine. bring people understand statistics. both. Makes hard trust anything. work, people able safely go back normal lives. Saying that‚Äôs case makes people less likely want get them. They‚Äôre getting way. Sure. reddit. Small scope default. Yeah, state people 16 plus eligable 8 days, still impossible fully vaccinated unless J&amp;J surprised places issues people getting second dose. used figure people willing get first would double down. comment little patronizing. comment get people think CDC issuing guidance, question guidance.

One person downvoted saying potential vaccinated people still spread covid, reply gets ""there's evidence fully vaccinated people spread it"". technically true, contrary also true then: there's evidence fully vaccinated people spread it.

Yet cautious person -10, misleading statement +10. Everyone including, historically speaking, worst vectors-kids. Still got mask meantime, vaxxed truly care covid ending. Anybody pays attention CDC guidelines getting vaccine anyway. 
I really understand people think ""if CDC says something bit different, people anti-vax."" Yeah, go somewhere else. That's point post though I'm surprised see coming CNN. Maybe tide finally turning. Really Sherlock? proposing normality. example, I've going bars restaurants mask stand months. fine. seem normal. motivate people normality, should.  think good approach would say ""if demand falls certain level open things up"". certain point going hit plateau many people want get one goal vaccinated percentage high states stuck limbo adjust reopening plans.  small gathering different dining tables? CDC might good science fuck, sure fuck guidelines.   previously infected COVID May 2020, tested positive antibodies time, got first 2nd dose vaccine, informed wasn‚Äôt injected correct quantity 2nd dose, get ‚Äú3rd‚Äù dose. hope means literally power now. I've said places that's situation. Vaccination 100% I'd comfortable people around likely vaccinated keeping distant masked. Since georgia still low total vaccinations, I'm ready around many people close quarters yet. Probably another month we'll place I'm comfortable it. 

I'm weird risk profile, exactly high risk, though. Viral illnesses cause issues chronic condition. Even mild covid could kick flare would leave sick year (that's flu me). I'm trying super careful. mean 94-95% efficiency that‚Äôs expected given large population late week first pfizer dose. chalked stress happened past, kind rarely recent years all. Otherwise cycle regular clockwork. Yes. Hey one advocated letting government whatever wants name public safety, me. wear fucking mask. I‚Äôm vaccinated. point forced wear mask feels ridiculous. virus always going here. first aboard mask train, I‚Äôm vaccinated. It‚Äôs giving extra protection wearing it, it‚Äôs protecting others. get infected that‚Äôs you.

It literally feels performative whenever wear point. might silly question, got second dose vaccine developed side effects. Nothing major, fever chills, body aches. question is, way contagious going on? think unvaccinated people able whatever want? Absolutely agree! feel way people religions? cannot fake spotting coming earlier. I've legit never spotted life, things happened post vaccine.

I feel like they're saying related know enough immune system reacts female hormones CDC bothering announce won‚Äôt need mask walking running outside alone? made laugh - y‚Äôall real sensitive group lol Thank article. Haha not. true, would wearing masks anytime flu, cuz chance could given somebody would die.  meant talking ass. Atlanta walk right Falcons stadium appointment vaccine 30 minutes. It‚Äôs like like 3 weeks. Anybody prioritized vaccine probably already shots now. multiple friends do. 

There reason children receiving vaccines right now. incredibly unlikely harmed virus doesn‚Äôt make logical sense. know else doesn‚Äôt make logical sense? elderly person vaccine could gotten one months ago. 


These scenarios mention extremely, extremely improbable. much going take extra precautions unlikely scenarios, might well walking around rubber suits don‚Äôt get struck lightning. realise little made UK?

Yes do. share little direly needed 2 months ago. right shipping AZ back fourth made little sense eventually deduct send difference whatever side owned more. specific case made sense Halix ready yet afaik (they're approved EMA quite producing, still started shipping). like sharing British made doses Halix repay favour say.

As others already mused, lawsuit may political point scoring rather get verdict proves AZ fails EU, would used broader lawsuit come - compensation forcing AZ terminate contract (which would free IP apparently).

And given current stand British vaccine rollout, forcing AZ export UK doses feel unfair me, long second doses affected. even take every British person yet get AZ jab account upfront, there'll leftovers UK's 100m order. maybe court order could used make AZ supply EU instead UK giving away sees fit. case blame UK suing back contract breaches - that's AZ's problem entirely undeserved sign two contradicting contracts. Nothing open mouths start pushing superiority beliefs others. Girl know lucky regular!!! weakest low energy sentiment I‚Äôve ever seen life Haha thanks, thats thought. Next time make decision .004 .08 percent chance something could happen, let know. Also probably clue hormones interact immune system. Women also reported intense periods post covid.  work city I've managing vaccine clinic. Also I've played small part group going faith based communities help vaccine hesitancy. 

Dude's brutal. Brutal. wish could attend meeting. Actually go find Frank Luntz YouTube video topic. pretty much that.  one ever required that, it‚Äôs wearing near people can‚Äôt social distance. stop it. imagine people refuse get vaccine people pandemic deniers anti-maskers.

At point that‚Äôs fault. want say louder people back, certainly can.  what's point literally changing DNA? TIL Kazakhstan.
I guess said low-income, meant ""not G8"" levels economic prosperity. even read article? freedom wear mask public deadly pandemic infringing someone else‚Äôs freedom live. trumps freedom wearing mask that‚Äôs fact opinion. There's difference optimism ""it mostly kills old people barely kids, stop trying incite panic bad cold"". told variations many occasions. nobody looked testing asked it. women instantly noticed post vaccine started talking it, getting around word mouth.

Mine also came week earlier 1st shot faked 1st spotting going away day, fun pants ruining surprise me.  makes think reasonable thing say someone? lot fucking idiots also ""follow science"" would know 0% chance catching outside running alone heard bad news since Globe Life Field opened doors 50,000 capacity crowd hopefully another step right direction  Age 3?

Age 6? Ah, see - Redfield out. Can't say I'm surprised. like COVID wakes certain time lol district population 200K 60 deaths  April according local news paper 3 confirmed government sources almost 1700 +ve Cases till April . Reports coming delay 2-3 days . People still traveling getting married like tommorow . least know EU reliable global partner, used critical infrastructure, like vaccines. Yeah, going ask ""why now""? Seems weird given winding Canada, least past worst it. braves game day. great....you leave bomb shelter observation what's actually happening. conjecture could happen.

General observation means took number infections divided number vaccinated people study. That's statement way study conducted. Also, numbers include chance unvaccinated person would infected, would 100%. Without that, can't actually compare efficacy. 1-in-1000 non-vaccinated participants got infected vaccinated people 1/15th lonely catch it. Context numbers reality vaccinated people getting covid similar rate people getting struck lightning say ""a lot potential""

Again though, that's we're actually looking at. We're looking likely catch compares inactivated population, captured number say wrong, Although I'm assuming literally mean 1 million using euphemism unlikely.

The person also said ""virtually impossible"", yet assume 1-in-a million euphemism unlikely? got 2nd shot looking forward fully vaccinated.

No, won‚Äôt wear freaking mask rest life even though I‚Äôm vaccinated. Sinovac good option too. India sees 27k dead day. many dying covid cause this? Thousands? also recall reading speculation exposure feline coronaviruses giving people partial immunity SARS-CoV-2. know developments. say 1:1 percentage....obviously percentage changer wi different...but relative change always 1:1 same...if adding 1k increased one 1% by0.75%, next 1k exact thing....

You totally use percentage relationship linear. know need 51% vaccinated end community spread, know need 60% eligible get vaccinated (rough numbers NM example), focus demographics reach people demographic actually get shots.... Since relationship numbers direct simple, looking either metric naturally implies other. USA update first dose shots:

J&amp;J 26k shots update highest week. think starting see early data unpause. Hopefully start see numbers hold little bit gets reported. mean, actually think that's useful number?

Because like 0.004% , time period, like 0.08% nonvaccinated people. can't fix stupid. Well, no, necessarily. we're vaccinated safe even another surge. think likely we'll another event. global access. bottom 5 states south. Ah yes, lying good long protect you. Funny seems happen lot places. know might get infected five people line. could someone cautious able get vaccine appointment, waiting second dose, one small percentage unlucky people get fully vaccinated still suffer severe symptoms die. 

It could someone genuinely unable get vaccinated, could child, elderly person. Weird know guess first time get baby? 

Yeah I've always gotten one shot. right, great news Yea don‚Äôt want coronavirus either. Yo tambien amigo, que te vaya bien.

Ps: keep looking picture gives odd feelings. seems like picture far back, something like Wikipedia article tragedy back 70's going right getting worse  Utterly dumbfounding waived IP yet. knew last year many countries may vaccinated 2024 schedules predicted held up.

Visitors allowed hospital wards investigations ongoing,"" said MOH. mean died COVID.

Simply home others COVID, dying, mean death result COVID.

Fun fact: many people (mostly elderly obese) upon hearing loved one died COVID, heart attacks strokes upon receiving news.

Does mean people died COVID? NO.

People die hearing bad news. Bad news, like death close loved one, cause blood pressure increase suddenly. atherosclerosis narrowing veins, cause heart attack die, quickly suddenly. elderly man dies heart attack upon hearing wife succumbed COVID.... mean died COVID? No, not.

It's better idea wait results autopsy concluding COVID death. wait autopsy? ""*Her sister COVID! probably died COVID!* basically saying. medical professional provides answer, left alarmist article.

 ***AUTOPSIES PERFORMED LIVING PEOPLE LEFT BEHIND.*** autopsy make ounce difference Sarah, dead? Absolutely not. found Sarah died something else, like environmental pathogen, undiagnosed congenital heart condition, epilepsy, cause... Sarah's family, ESPECIALLY younger sister, want NEED know exactly died.

Especially people die suddenly, like young mothers children young people living siblings, autopsy finds Sarah die COVID, died something else, example congenital heart defect... surviving family know go doctor screened defect prevent another premature death family. 

Classic example: families basketball volleyball players unusually tall experience relatively high number sudden deaths, autopsies regularly reveal surviving family undiagnosed illnesses Marfan's syndrome (a side effect really tall long limbs weak hearts) forms hereditary heart diseases disproportionately affect tall people. Mainstream media worldwide must pick story, tune mass audiences, run it, every day report topic: post-acute sequalae COVID-19, also known long COVID. Seriously never thought we'd bring upon situation AZ also under-delivering UK, maybe sue get doses made EU?

Yes should, think AZ made potentially fraudulent contract. question? government keep sending vaccines states use them? states massive stockpile. goverment sending vaccines states actually using vaccines. SSI impressive, Corona vaccines believe Biobtech/Pfizer currently largest? Reaching herd immunity really topic anymore. certainly get think mid summer super realistic.

I doubts country actually opening 60-80% people vaccinated. Germany always super slow adapt new information. caused AstraZennecas image tank, spread mutations ""thrid"" wave. Technically still second wave.

I fully trust vaccines. trust government appropriately react results wide spread vaccinations.

We reach point barley people intensive care anymore still high 7 day incidence. Based government RKI handeled far sure closed months even reaching herd immunity. they? Xiaomi phones made wantonly cruel inhuman CCP. serum institute india biggest vaccine manufacturing company world. expanding increase throughput even . 145 million people already vaccinated  Imo UK EU sue AZ making promises could never realize. *juhuuuu* Antihistamines super useful covid19 too. Oh easy set rules follow benefits weakest us. great injustice god given right little civic duty possible. love country don‚Äôt give shit people.

Mrs side effects second Pfizer. I‚ÄôM ALRIGHT! still spread virus vaccinated. lot less (hopefully) still happen. still spread unvaccinated?  saw list year ago candidate vaccines worked on. 71 separate vaccines. Totally agree, I've seen ""the thing happened last spring"" post several times recently think that's super wrong. I'm saying seasonality factor (there's always lots factors play), situation COMPLETELY different last spring obvious reasons touched on. 

But think even importantly that, fact comparison ""last spring"" actually makes opposite argument first place. SHIT ton coronavirus time last year - official case count obviously justice. day 1 year ago, TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED people died coronavirus. definitely begun slope downward, still total disaster we'd peaked couple weeks prior. current situation nothing like that. peaked months ago, spread totally control (generally speaking) throughout entire period time surging last year. easing restrictions across country (and little/no restrictions places). last year, clusterfuck mostly still confined northeast virus still seeding phase rest country. 

So like... EXTREMELY lighter restrictions, well deeply rooted spread already place across entire country, we've mere fraction coronavirus last year like one fourth country throughout March April. think even remotely similar. seasonality help turn around places like Michigan New Jersey past week two? I'm sure something. nothing like last year. Japan got 39 million doses Europe. taking long get people‚Äôs arms ?  Thanks Edi correction It‚Äôs actually increasing much world. 

In US it‚Äôs still high case numbers high numbers people won‚Äôt take vaccine. surprisingly difficult walk outside myself. went hike last May trail full people, way step two feet away passing, got bunch sour looks mask. always brought one that.

If see there's nobody around, take off, trivial put back I'm going approach anyone within 10 feet. there's reason to. mask habit near suburban home makes sense, people walking dogs time. Passing people sidewalk unavoidable. Breh ban India yesterday Amsterdam still Brazilians arriving every day.  worst may every country. Australia lost control 910 deaths total. make sense. Wearing mask jogging absolute nonsense. Wearing mask generally doinga anything all. chances getting sick Covid outside incredibly small. knew since beginning early 2020. 

Covid spreads best bad ventilated buildings many people inside them. god anti vaxxers fucking morons see mean unfortunately simple; someone could gotten unknowingly passed along. Think restaurant 50 customers months ago; 50 would subject contact tracing thus leaves 50 unique paths one infected person. like finding penny haystack point, could lead lot wrongful accusations. think current system doubled knobs throw parties participate, things get better without risking innocent people's freedom. yet anyone second dose side-effects last longer 2 days?

That mean can't call insanity China Russia though. fact, should. Part failings west soft Russia China. Actually studies show covid recovered people need shot even better protected pop didn‚Äôt two shots.

Put people disagree committed acts violence surveillance ‚â† democratic country. violent send lab ones. stay truthful. interesting see EU's total vaccinations yesterday. Seems like countries hit new records they've finally began receiving enough doses.

This beginning well.  drive 20 miles get shot Detroit, 3 times many staff people waiting shot. Real shame living 45 years Detroit area, hardly suprising.  Basically yeah. herd immunity threshold mean cases stop immediately, epidemic cannot grow more, overshoot, epidemic might go frustratingly slowly (but consistently). Germany health insurance also doesn‚Äôt cover birth control, glasses, dental procedures involving rock screwdriver. 

That's mostly false. Root canals covered 30 50% cost health insurances, fillings, periodic clean check ups fully covered. 

Glasses covered go past point nuisance, e.g. least 50% visual impairment remember correctly - lesser sight losses Fielmann covered relatively cheap sum.

Birth control specifically covered, although wide range women healthcare necessities spent less money healthcare US German health insurance really kicks you‚Äôre dying. 

Yeah that's vast exaggeration. get checkups specialists relatively regularly + regular prescriptions non life threatening issues never paid sum high enough noticeable, usually single US insurance actually paid small stuff needed Germany they‚Äôre like ‚ÄúRoot canal? Best dentures.‚Äù

Again, that's false. see insurances actually make quite dent final cost. That's considering public basic insurance, paying additional care possible translates better cost lot insurances choose cover flu shot everyone do, lot people think they‚Äôll pay pocket even though might to. Combined fact ends 2+ hour ordeal doctors office people don‚Äôt bother.

A vast majority insurance companies cover cost, coverage risk groups mandatory. insurance companies cited cover flu shot even non-risk groups, (other) insurance companies offer vaccination yearly budget fit flu shot well.

All say problem availability. think says bad public discourse become everything black white rather nuance. honest, hesitant get vaccine first annoying get lumped crazy anti-vaxxers think every vaccine bad. It‚Äôs possible. said important context environment possibility go store location where‚Äôd interact one two people passing side walk. big study half million people im showing people one dose vaccine recovered individuals exact percentage getting covid. it‚Äôs true infection doesn‚Äôt give immunity. It‚Äôs perfect neither vaccine. whole point getting vaccine return normalcy (travel, visit family, gym-things haven‚Äôt done year patiently waiting vaccine). Otherwise point getting it? two countriea gift keeps giving. Literally nothing positive coming there. Great people. Why? understand. time come? That's cute... people Germany would get act together vaccinate people. 105 really dangerously high. hope taken Tylenol combat it?  crap again. real issue US right isn‚Äôt vaccine hesitancy, vaccine apathy. People plan eventually get it, could get time, haven‚Äôt it‚Äôs convenient enough. Fair. 40-45% people first shots I‚Äôd imagine least would fully vacced month, plus J&amp;Js happen next month..then add say 15% safe natural immunity, still gets around 50-60% shrinks pool people left get infected less half. Maybe. Wearing one walking dog master planned, suburban community feels pretty intentional though. Stay classy lol half dozen studies saying plasma work hospitalized patients, believe latest ""Among patients hospitalised COVID-19, high-titre convalescent plasma improve survival prespecified clinical outcomes."" 

There another paper studied monoclonal antibodies (kind artificial plasma) good effects given preventatively, injection infusion, make easier give early. I'll link paper later find There's question accuracy reporting states.  Since half population vaccinated, 4/41 cases vaccinated people, means vaccines work. 105 pretty serious. sure thermometer accurate?

Do idea age group eligible vaccination? Fingers crossed far away sounds. medical examiner would likely find embolism (if embolism) killed autopsy, yes.

Blood clots associated COVID show lungs (you actually watch Italian pathologist conduct complete autopsy COVID patient died COVID YouTube... points blood clots lungs).

The reason obese people die COVID frequently hospital due higher likelihood atherosclerosis (clogged arteries), makes much likely blood clot become deadly. COVID patient hospital, they're immobile, yet another added mortality risk blood clots. people overweight especially high risk death COVID, pneumonia, medical procedure leaves patient immobile long periods time.

So CDC saying now, even 90-95% fewer cases hypothetical completely unrestricted, unmasked, non-vaccinated population would much. 

Of course, share vaccinated goes up, amount virus circulation among non-vaccinated goes too, change. cannot look vaccinated isolation, also need look situation large. effectiveness 100%, need to, not.

It's that, also makes easier control mask mandates apply everyone, big part CDC risk calculation.

Maybe me, see people hesitant vaccines group following restrictions whole time.  


For instance, Washington Oregon low cases per person even vaccination rate ones cases going up. Mississippi bunch cases per person far lower vaccination acceptance, steady even without masks. bullshit lol.

The thing percentages changes smaller numbers yield greater percentage fluctuations. mean, look Wyoming. 7 cases per day they're 10% increase previous week. sky falling, end world, everyone shelter place!

Youyang Gu's model (he's accurate CDC modelers throughout whole thing) predicted 28.6% infected February 21. Since 3.3 million recorded cases, conservatively ballpark 8 million actual cases.

For 328 million people, 28.6% 94 million. Add another 8 million we're probably around 31% caught COVID point. Sure, GP typical, dedicating 90min/week could give us huge bump without disregarding patients. masking remains social normal thing people vaccinated. like got downvoted first asking list. sub scary. shouldn‚Äôt removed AZ vaccine banned blood clot research funded Pfizer, fact also cases Pfizer Moderna vaccinations.

I think would multiply 3.6, 4.6. Since already found 1. 

Which would put 118m, 35% still little high. found cases vs missed cases would dropped time, would found Jan today last year time, 1 4.6 would drop also.

I think thats math works Yes yesterday evening received 2 million doses Pfizer stop calling death list file said ""death list"". print names without context, named like that. like it, problem, stop is. 

It considerably different share link vote results composing list voted measures calling death list. attempts belittle act rather worrying, showing quite detachment actual terrorism preperations.

94% pretty damn high, enough us take masks get back normal Trinidad Tobago even smaller population technically able afford vaccines.

The article cremations India faces tsunami Covid-19 deaths crazy many people refer flu *just* flu, considering deadly contagious is. Hahahaha, truth. getting boys back, quarantining them, closing travel countries? There's ""anti-vax"" crowd, there's also ""vaccine apathetic"" crowd.

Yeah, there's kind virus going around too, definitely scary start respiratory symptoms this, even vaccinated.

Bright side, second shot 15th, happy full vaxx day! people start dying due Indian variant, percentage go up. Lol state highest literally ONE work getting vaccinated Good. Essentially anyone threatens lives politicians rather trying use ballot box qualify.

Otherwise even organising demonstrations fine long regularly turn riot. Wooo 33% let's go Idaho, let's show states 51st education spending including D.C. doomed.  Good, would get it. friend got positive Rapid 2 Negative PCRs...I hope infected, keep us updated. Dude, what?! Covid comparable Ebola, entire life society would brink ruin(or straight ruined). mean apocalypse, society broken down, mad max ruined. Way people contract covid way fewer people die it.

66 million, give idea, roughly entire population United Kingdom. 

They estimate worldwide, 3 million people died Covid. 

So no, covid NOTHING like Ebola. 1st wave US particularly bad figured treat covid yet. Death rate lot higher without proper medical care. hard tell due variants due state Healthcare India.

Would FDA even bother taking time review though? think damage done vaccine, doubt FDA approval heighten confidence **Study Title:** Youth Young Adult COVID-19 Impacts Study.

**Study Description:** Researchers Northwestern University recruiting participants research study teens young adults. agree participate, you‚Äôll asked complete online survey two times: day enroll, exactly six months that. survey take 45 minutes. You‚Äôll asked questions topics as: 

You 
Your experiences COVID-19 
Your mental, physical, emotional health 

**You eligible live United States surrounding territories ages 14-24 read English.**

**Study Link:** (ethical/legal):** study approved universities IRB (STU00213711)

**End Date:** Open slamming brakes seems. Supply ample, demand dwindled. know anyone 16-and-over planning get vaccinated gotten Shot 1 yet? positive rapid test, quarantine get PCR result.

The CDC recommendation tell somebody tested positive need quarantine. 70% asymptomatic 29.5% mild rate, ""only"" 0.5% people infected polio complications died. take polio pretty seriously. people can't bothered wear mask SARS pandemic. Oh boo boo widdle piece fabric scared you. convinced made weapon lab? Don‚Äôt shoot messenger heh. confuses well. US screwing countries sharing Pfizer Moderna yet, least waiving vaccine patents? Yeah, don‚Äôt know we‚Äôre falling behind. Makes nervous second new? vast majority covid cases young people asymptotic/very mild. news yet vaccines expected work Indian varriant Oh totally plan to! FDA gold standard places world FDA-approval would sure increase popularity also outside US. repeated ad nauseum young people fence vaccine. 

I scared shitless lost sense taste smell. thought would never come back. controlled definitely disinformation campaigns closely involved with. nuanced arguments AZ, Moderna Pfizer:bad Sputnik good. Masks, least rational people, ongoing reminder disease, death isolation.

As be.

This healthy humans supposed live, day day. That‚Äôs scary headline realize watching people became radical know like anecdotal discussions I'm dealing thing. Luckily bad time Covid hit 3 months post still distinct foul smell various times throughout day, usually smell something especially sweet strong, like soap. really make difference. claim nations part world common interpretation freedom speech, true.

Is single European country stronger protections speech? name it? I‚Äôll wait. find much Greek law, 

Get better googling: think major businesses (Target, McDonalds, Uber, etc) lift mask mandates? can't vaccinated people gather unmasked? need send message vaccines safe protect COVID. untested part, very, likely effective wait. Many countries world waiting months give second doses. even bothering though? It‚Äôs like US going use would US FDA even waste time reviewing it? don‚Äôt know So, I'm understanding correctly, findings necessarily speak effectiveness vaccine *prevent* symptomatic infection? looks group hospitalized 65+ y/o's finds vaccinated people 94% less likely covid complications? 

I, like others thread, kind worried data means vaccine less effective preventing illness previously thought. Still full grasp implications.  Regardless, people don‚Äôt notice symptoms, they‚Äôre much likely spread someone feeling weather.

Flu usually hits like freight train. go bed feeling fine wake feeling like death. 

The gradual onset covid makes much sneakier. Coronavirus that. retroviruses Yeah would weed true anti vaxers ones meh idea cause Joe Rogan told needed. Hold fries!! wait.. give back true. Indians celebrated last year Dussara, Diwali, 2021 new year, harvest festivals Jan 2021 (Sankranti) also several Muslim Christian festivals. Nothing spiked cases. Now, peak summer, cases started raising. major festivals since harvest festival since Jan 15th timeframe.  blase, death happen us point going life avoiding infectious disease costs enough people. incentive greater whether like not. I'm getting vaccine, think personal risk much, a. want spread someone can't get vaccinated b. want able start getting back normal activities getting vaccinated enables so. won‚Äôt starting since t-cell recognition yet evaded variant. Cellular immunity still allows minor infection much shorter duration possibly less transmissibility. Still effectively knocking R0 down. I'd think diversity flu slightly affected, downward. protect animal reservoirs, would probably rather well next years. atheist, find Laicite interesting concept. Religion ever present US, many Europeans come shocked first arrive. can‚Äôt guarantee rights time contradict other. makes rights end little path-dependent.

Seems pretty solid regard far using OG, there‚Äôs nothing say 3 billion shots can‚Äôt updated formula.  Wow, policy seems fearful conservative. wonder long gap eligibility availability. Quebec two weeks ahead? test flu hospitalized it, exceedingly low number flu deaths indicates real difference. today 305 million vaccines distributed, 237 million shots delivered. 77% used. rate 76% 81% last 10 weeks. 

Of course places experiencing lack demand. overall looks like slowdown due supply. Denmark administering mRNA doses get delivered. due getting one extra dose vial. 80M enormous number, large number wasted due human error expiration epic failure. exempt

Lol what!?!?! Whats upsetting Brit acquaintance Thailand clearly Covid wont get tested bc refuses go govt quarantine. Keeps saying cant shake 'cold' yet still keeps going interacting people. God wish people govts could get right places. ps, downgraded friend acquaintance. didnt like told exact fucker every zombie movie pretending wasnt bitten. really didnt like vaccine cards joke. piece card basic info hand written them. hope names sort database. We've experienced flu least once. even see movies. ""Oh darn, got flu. Gonna hot achey days. Great excuse stay home watch tv."" 

But COVID-19 different beast. Much infectious deadly. we've never experienced before. it‚Äôs definitely profit driven

Exactly. example, Serum Institute India got Oxford vaccine license ""non-profit"" basis, sold vaccine Africa 2.5 times price paid West. 

The sole beneficiary waiver Covid vaccine patent rights would China. China means acquire technology undercut Western competitors couple years, even provide vaccines year. least food board top notch. Two reasons think of.

&amp;#x200B;

One done. 
Vaccine tested post-COVID spike / variant population rather earlier population awkward moment pants pre-emptively. Never fails. Health England (PHE) said Thursday ‚Äúno evidence widespread community transmission variants cause severe disease render vaccines currently deployed less scientists said worrying UK‚Äôs detected cases appear increasing rapidly despite England still social-distancing restrictions. India placed England‚Äôs travel ‚Äúred list‚Äù 23 April, restricting arrivals citizens residents must quarantine hotel.  obvious, start, people would need provide proof vaccination--to nations (and airlines) travel internationally, employers, schools, etc. setting system vaccines developed tested. think wave...think like hot air cold air. happens cool weather, open door toasty house? Hot air rushes out, cool air sneaks in. 

These ""waves"" variants happen one variant takes place other. key complacent. open quickly. Manage outbreaks. Quarantine positive cases quickly. Vaccinate, test, test, test.  would go getting flu test recently? live, flu like symptoms told get covid test. doctor would physically see give flu test negative covid result. Results would take 5 days get back then, flu, symptoms would clearing up. wave cases illnesses currently happening among middle class, people cities suburbs houses, etc. first wave earlier among impoverished somehow either bad fully quantified reported. time US mobilize vaccine shipment, send there, india distribute administer shots...the current wave anyway.  YES!!!! think major deterrent abuse sure.
However assuming countries 14 days quarantine requirement, far US concerned average American probably ran PTO one quarantine requirement (at least returning US involve quarantine) unless secure job done remotely quarantine period professions large chunk time like teachers/professors self employed. 
So potentially even prevents abuse system even once.

I glad neither US France requires quarantine, testing fully vaccinated person going fully vaccinated family, testing already additional step okay take despite highly low risk contributing virus spread. 

We need push message vaccines lower restrictions get increase vaccination rates. restrictions refuse part ending pandemic refusing vaccines (excluding valid medical exemption verified doctor) moderna? reason worry India variant? situation sounds really scary I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs bc variant dangerous bc living conditions India. try stay date stuff took break Covid articles mental health plummeting. proven increase time (about 8 weeks data effectively ends), time increased \~90%. Check p. took literally. mistake. People oxygen 30. don‚Äôt recover. 

One man 70, improvement. 

It‚Äôs beyond tragic. perfect, finally half monkey half human hasn't. called parosmia. implies olfactory neurons got destroyed replaced. neurons can't regenerate, can. regenerates neuron sends its' axon towards primary olfactory cortex interpretation. However axon necessarily sent place before, interpretation may off. Doctors apparently good success telling patients make effort smell different foods every day. idea brain eventually adjust its' interpretation smell something appropriate, changing its' wiring new dendrites Yeah that's National/Sharon Van Etten, life'll go on. Wish Parquet Courts show Hokyoke get pushed way November them's breaks least cases down! vaccination cards ever going required anything ""official"", probably going need like state I.D., issued government file verifiable database.  We're 57% 18+ Washington least one shot cases going up, Seattle area likely backtrack restrictions starting next week. weird we're opposite experience. like social security numbers never intended used identity financial tracking don‚Äôt think would help anyone Worst part is, absolutely free. pretty sad newsüòî tired/came excuse Soft Sounds tour, I'll making mistake time around! Vaxxed people spreading 'vaccine-resistant' ANYTHING. Quit bullshit I'm talking basic research behind mRNA tech used both. I'm aware Pfizer took funding US. AZ even trying... took literally cases entire flu season? mean that's started already wrong begin with. course gonna cases, like still cases bubonic plague anthrax infection. mean short answer 3 things simply untrue. lies.

I saw another thread early pandemic rumor going around hospitals stealing synovial knee fluid people selling black market covid hoax way get people hospital. mean know shit comes people believe it.

But worry debating them, get vaccine.  government one person party. model simple reflect real world. somebody show photos idiot: still doesn‚Äôt seem believe Covid worse cold flu Yep, FDA Emergency Use Application presentation, specifically pages very...phallic graph increasing efficacy. surges US scenario afraid happening - loss services means formerly trivial injuries become death sentence could match number deaths pandemic.  Hydrate ride tbh. lasts 24hrs.

Best luck! Except large crowds least safe items least yellow green fully vaccinated people. I'm certainly going things awhile. situations going around unmasked best diaper chinned nose masked people. Also, insuation cloth masks protect well. can't assume offering cash people make willing take vaccine. behavioral economics/psychology rather expect opposite happen.

If someone already intrinsic motivation something, offer money it, economic motivation often replace previous motivation, instead adding it. result less thing want, instead more.

In addition, vaccine ostensibly something good, people would willing pay get. offer money get it, changes category vaccine one things normally want people pay do. confuse lot people, would also make many people suspicious. ""Why want pay take vaccine? wrong it? hiding me?""

There's things suffer effects like these. Making things free seem positive effects. making vaccine free, administration vaccine free, giving people paid leave work take vaccine, free Uber rides vaccination work way want increase vaccinations. wary moving past free. drive in? test covid. Flu never test positive covid, PCR work like that. Sorry hear going though that.

 *-it change DNA! NOOOOO* 

\- mRNA vaccine incapable changing DNA. impossible three reasons.

1. DNA cell housed nucleus. order access nucleus vaccine would need pass though nuclear membrane. that, vaccine would need nuclear access signal (which have). signal means biologically impossible vaccine enter nucleus interact DNA.
2. DNA RNA separate languages. Let's suppose vaccine somehow biologically impossible managed sneak though nuclear membrane. situation RNA vaccine would incapable communicating DNA cell. RNA DNA completely different languages. DNA RNA communicate ""translator"" reverse transcription enzyme would need used. vaccine enzyme therefore impossible vaccine RNA communicate cellular DNA. 
3. RNA cannot integrate DNA without integrase. biological impossibility 1 2 happened, vaccine RNA would still incapable integrating DNA. happen, yet another enzyme would need present vaccine. not.

So short, literally impossible vaccine interact DNA.

 *-If get COVID vaccine, quarantine 2 weeks shedding.* 

A mRNA vaccine actually COVID virus it. Therefore impossible shed virus. 

 *-TONS PEOPLE DYING VACCINE!! many people died vaccine.*

 see one lot. misconception stems misunderstanding correlation causation. people died *taken* vaccine? Yes, thousands people died taking vaccine. Thousands people die every day. *vaccine* responsible deaths? No. Right looks like 1.1 *billion* people vaccinated far, one person freak blood clot unfortunately led death. would likely win Powerball lottery four times die vaccine related blood clot. right. article states still cases/deaths flu 2020/2021 season. also shows graphic flu testing dropping near 0. got Pfizer shots never felt thing either time, even feel shot, side effects all. Cold Another political nail Putin's reputation legacy corrupt leader.  ??? Whhhhaaaaaaaattttttttttttt??? Really right??? covid 19 now? play Florida beginning season 2 week Canadian quarantine. spring training field context, 3 million last Thursday, 3.5 million Thursday that, 3.4 million Thursday that. Thursday low month half.

So yeah, 2.7 million nothing sneeze at, direction we're headed great. Alabama checking in. defending lower average number, maybe help explain it, ‚Äúopened‚Äù pretty early took large case load also early Summer/Fall reward. point, life pretty much back normal minus wearing masks indoors (which isn‚Äôt going change another months regardless). cases really pretty low (200-300 per Day entire state). schools wrapping successful in-person school year. risk older age population (my parents in-laws included) vaccinated. weather nice we‚Äôre ready summer begin. 

So, many, may feel like huge sense urgency get vaccinated aren‚Äôt older age higher risk categories mostly protected. believe would different time last year cases way thing ‚Äúscary‚Äù, vaccines available though. 

Anyway, number looks pretty bad map, daily life really pretty good getting better. people make correct type level immune response even shot, addition MULTIPLE different forms flu circulating every single flu season. 

Scientists look strains quickly literally predict future strain problematic order get vaccines general public time. 

So getting shot still getting flu either 1) immune system sucks horribly 2) one unlucky ones get strain one expected issue. 

Trust I've also gotten shot gotten flu year, happens. tape every precaution necessary get sick.   articles [like doctors who‚Äôve shots still getting infected, think it‚Äôs early know anything new variants normal 5% less severe infections might statistically expect.  last resort....you cannot imagine desperation. majority we‚Äôve gotten via COVAX it‚Äôs much less ordered. Hoping half allocation June, we‚Äôll switching trying get many people possible vaccinated first dose. idea we‚Äôll get around second dose even AZ get. larger countries monopoly really hard smaller countries get WHO-approved vaccines. right here. Sums perfectly. khalsa aid sikh group amazing work help.... please pray them. Scotty! earned pay week! Testing quarantine seems like small cost me. people much inconvenienced quarantine period, ideally also making sure people don‚Äôt abuse it. government can‚Äôt trust people act responsibly people aren‚Äôt responsible even want virus makes may be. people responsible best factor quarantine days travels, think it‚Äôs fair say that‚Äôs part responsible. 

That really seems like fair solution, people still come taking much risk spreading virus further. Quantity dosage matter. got J&amp;J vaccine, put little round sticker plastic center skin, purpose prevent spillage injection site. (Incidentally, felt like *ton* liquid, unsettling trait seems specific J&amp;J.) would feel somewhat concerned shoes. much reaction next 24 hours, might try get additional shot, thing possible area (walk-ins?). even ""green pass"" Israel already hit wall vaccinations? around 50%? so, much longer economically feasible continue cut half society? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Note Lonza, Swiss biotech company mentioned article, manufacturing Moderna's vaccine, making one key ingredient -- lipid nanoparticles surround mRNA. Lonza hardly ""chemicals company,"" extremely sophisticated $50 billion multi-national chemical &amp; biotech company.

This one primary bottlenecks process, categorically something one tens thousands ""chemical"" companies capable making. small handful companies world capable it, operating capacity, primary constraint Pfizer Moderna.

The idea chemical company start producing true.

In event, there's nothing stopping country like India ignoring pharmaceutical patents. India famously ignores time. case, Serum Institute manufacturing AstraZeneca vaccine license, full technology transfer AZ, still cannot large volume due lack supplies.  many things alter woman‚Äôs cycle. knows bonfire vaccine. also could indirect relation due stress. shots suuuuper nervous scared really important metric throughout whole pandemic, still every country access vaccines like US. noticed second dose. entirely true. article mentions, debate whether replication-competent adenovirus vector could efficient generating immunity replication-incompetent one. least short term, risk reducing efficiency future booster shots future vaccines use vector potential reduction efficiency vector adenovirus (basically, vector replicate, body learn neutralize said vector). J&amp;J shitstorm referring to? tiny number people (less .001 percent) severe adverse reactions? Neither. means one approximate 20 fold (i.e. 95%) reduction risk. 

I've forgotten exact numbers, previously 70 year old 15% chance ending hospital got covid. less 1% chance. love comments saying ‚Äúthere vaccines available‚Äù ‚Äúeveryone consider risk factors‚Äù removed ‚Äúantivaxx‚Äù.

Mods playing bit fast loose definition antivaxx aren‚Äôt  that. complicated despite simple. bunch people asking weird situations saying since CDC accommodate bad. completely disingenuous complaint normally are.

Get vaccine none matter. Get everyone know get matter. Blaming CDC complex algorithm passing buck. You‚Äôd surprised. see people walking alone, outside, near anybody within 100 ft double masked. person Indian origin, heart bleeds country helpless people. Watching government's inaction, denial callousness reminds horror felt watching HBO's Chernobyl - except much larger scale. masks never going end, fucking christ. Sounds like might learn hard way point....  Imagine dumb enough read infographic, take seriously, actually says. Exercising extreme caution harms one &amp; benefits everyone. worst it‚Äôs inconvenience. not? Texas full stadium 3 weeks ago surge I‚Äôve heard of.  honestly think 5% dems vaccine hesitant? whopping 40% republicans are? 80+ percent 50 crowd getting shot, seems unlikely. Use reasoning skills instead listening liberal study liberal university liberal state polled 800 people. *barely* enough time since opened vaccines everyone someone get fully vaccinated (plus waiting period after). got first dose 3 days fully open adults I'm still waiting Sunday considered ""fully vaccinated"". we're state fourth last percent population fully vaccinated (and dead last like week ago).

""Slippery slope"" argument. yet. people want drag forever. I'm saying stay ~50% better vaccination numbers - like maybe get 50% fully vaxed? another month. hell, fully open vaccinated. maybe social distanced sections vaccinated sections. like Cali teams, require proof vaccination recent negative test. I'm asking *something*. understand matters cause struggling move forward. bullshit facade move. Good piece. It‚Äôs shame hard CDC communicate regular people. I‚Äôve lurking r/COVID19, reading preprints such, surprised.

Key point: ‚ÄòWe wear masks three reasons: protect people might infected, protect others infections, set social standards norms appropriate pandemic.‚Äú Lmfao....masks joke   Safety measures listed unvaccinated people masks, distance, hand washing. vaccinated, masks. 

I‚Äôm gonna go limb say keep hand washing habits anyway, filthy animals. Lack viewers christian white males? Trying convince regularly. Read article . . . it‚Äôs that. don‚Äôt disagree anything say. It‚Äôs relevant particular post. cares? Yeah, honest question: point this? going help? **bullshit**. Cloth medical masks never helped this. No. pandemic really revealed government partnering pharmaceutical companies hell lot efficient, faster better public health private-sector model. Looking ahead, don‚Äôt see couldn‚Äôt model development drugs cancer, diabetes, heart disease, etc. 

And US, flaws, huge pool research talent universities, combined probably brain power pharmaceutical companies. Seems me, there‚Äôs gotta way harness talent good instead profit price gouging. all, Moderna started Harvard lab. if, instead researchers starting company, would incentivized government competition teams universities?

If Apollo program cancer ... imagine could possible Sorry didnt make cleae, im one people. believe preserving freedoms highest priority government.  Golly, sure sounds like problem ""liberals.""

What happened? liberal swipe girl something? üòÇ

But seriously, I'll happily play game. going like goes, I'll play. go reasoning skills...

So, Trump 65+ crowd 3 points, 51% 48%. 65+ age group, per CDC, 82% least one vaccine dose. Let's assume 95% Biden voters 65 got least one dose (per poll) - that's 45.6% 65 crowd. So, 82 (the percent one dose) minus 45.6 (Biden voters one dose) leave us needing another 36.4%, come Trump voters. Trump 51% age group, means remainder 14.6%. 

That 14.6 represents 28.6% Trump voters 65. said, older folks got vaccinated higher rate, seem totally realm credibility something like 40% Republicans overall want get vaccine. that's get really fun part realize there's entire category even touched yet, people poll identified actually make 38% electorate (with 31% registered Dems, 26% Repubs). So, 65 crowd, Trump must captured good portion independent voters hit 51% mark. 22% Independents refuse vaccine, opposed 43% Republicans, per poll, Trump sizable number Independents (and did) would move needle math get us closer poll indicated, meaning something neighborhood mid-30% Republicans 65 get vaccine.

Additionally, polls found similar numbers! Like one: (, 11,000 interviews, 29% Republicans refuse), one: http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-the-biden-administration-covid-19/#sthash.cI8mHWqH.dpbs (1.200+ polled, 49% R men refuse, 34% R women refuse) 

Goddamn! Reasoning skills. fucking hoot. vaccination process open ages now?   Absolutely mask wearing permanent tenant public life. assume recommend no. Better safe. You‚Äôll see friends next year. got vaccinated I'm done masks. always plan. year, that's long enough. wear one I'm required to, like stores. don' think fair ask vaccinated people continue wearing mask virus poses minimal risk them, simply someone else might lie vaccinated. want put others risk, that's problem, mine. anyone wants know stopped wearing mine, happily tell think makes sense continue wearing mask vaccinated.  I've heard (boots ground) freaking mess everywhere. big difference solid reporting/recording rural seriously impoverished areas.

I'm actually quite concerned one contacts stopped responding text. quite ill last week sincerely hope alright.  That's plan. cases looking like NM? dropping? Yes. case vaccine nationalism begetting vaccine nationalism. Yeah, way hell operate system check million+ people antibodies. attention research issue. Women periods overlooked uterus complicated system, good opportunity shed attention. like mixup me. 

üòÇüëç

Looks like febrile case ""it can't must be""... numbers general observation,

Yes observation what's actually happening. conjecture could happen.

I speaking going ""back normal"" restrictions would still leave lot potential getting sick

If reality vaccinated people getting covid similar rate people getting struck lightning say ""a lot want say 1-in-20 example misleading, fine. responding someone claiming 1-in-1,000,000 though, even father reality.

Yeah say wrong, Although I'm assuming literally mean 1 million using euphemism unlikely. Another slight death increase, enough concern yet. everything else looking fine. Plus positive testing reached new low. best tornado flood takes neighborhood kills bunch people, chance survive.

Inevitably thank god tender love mercy. Literally dead people - god apparently didn‚Äôt love much - piled around them.

That‚Äôs special level self-centered ignorant pride. mention stupid. Please stand say things like that.

Easier hear you.  key is, ""low-impact, cost effective"".
For vaccines would agree factor lockdowns restrictions changes impacts. Isn‚Äôt supposed encourage people get vaccinated? things without mask nearly everyone since last year. also taking consideration multigenerational homes everyone family working outside home (and thus vector) reality can't changed. majority American European households similarly arranged, might recommended height bad waves. Nope, already seeing signs vaccines still work well Bang bang Pfizer Gang. cares, let die. Less dumb people. Saw someone another sub ask US residents felt high risk coming countries get vaccinated. answer same, i'm it. 

Right second, look right window, see pharmacy know fact vaccines going waste tonight. knew walk-ins went pickup prescription today pharmacist asked knew anyone still needed extras. feel terrible everyone can't get country there's surplus area. rapid tests? Right? 

Based trends seems moving positive direction. Two weeks ago 7-day average case number seemed around 7600 daily. good news!  work diseases then? Like I'm vaccinated measles, still spread it? Genuinely asking, trying rude. make sense covid much dangerous. Like, wearing masks diseases then? seems centered around Mumbai New Delhi, least news is. 

What situation elsewhere country? Someone tweeted request oxygen, grandpa dying needed it. folks signal boosted it, trying get poor dude help. Gov't came like fist angry god 'spreading rumors' (*‚ÄúSpreading kinds rumours condemnable criminal offence.""*) anything even *hints* bad things tantamount Crime, guess. you‚Äôre chemo you‚Äôre going severely compromised (or nonexistent) immune system. vaccine won‚Äôt work you. 

Source: friend‚Äôs dad going chemo right I've food poisoning couple times wildly unpleasant, I'm going argue point. above, I'm saying they're wrong - factually, runny eggs definitely likely give food poisoning. Everyone's make risk assessment foods (obviously different COVID-19 since food-borne pathogens transfer person person), I'm going keep eating over-easy eggs, medium rare steaks, deviled eggs probably sat long. Exactly. 

We tracking hospitalizations deaths point. 

Cases relatively meaningless population getting infected mostly unaffected virus. many people would put around someone outside unless required establishment tight large group. never made much sense. Literally care? hurt bother little old lady immune compromised person wants wear mask outside? sense self fragile? Sad.  Honestly, conspiracy theory would happen? think government profits public health measure place? even power maintain unnecessary mask mandate perpetuity democracy? 

Mask mandates end reach herd immunity, earlier. states already ended them. ridiculous people think like this. got first pfizer today :) Rent free Woodstock 30 minutes atlanta. one driving Woodstock access pharmacy. live ten minutes Woodstock able sign shot 15 mins GA dept Health website month ago shot less 12 hours later 20 mins house megachurch. looking get one pharmacy, yeah might trouble Georgia open receive vaccine month expanded mass vaccine locations. person talking butt.

It‚Äôs amazing feeling! Totally! someone zero medical background, truly felt like witnessing alien technology haha What‚Äôs difference mask shirt, shoes? long it‚Äôs common wear? Japan widespread masks think. never heard cities? go rural parts state one wearing anymore. PA NJ. lesson rabbits effective facemask. Probably. think.  Hide bed! Ah, backward. knew one currently approved 16-18. I've gotten salmonella covid salmonella much worse past year we've heard anti-maskers COVID deniers say ""go ahead wear mask! judge you! make wear one! Freedumb!""

Yea. bunch bullshit turned be, eh? going sound stupid, chance someone tries get vaccinated like dozen times? admit give shit masks instead blaming inconsistent messaging government agency. time, fuck masks. wear go shopping chance may stop infecting people that's it. think it‚Äôs Pfizer approved 16+, Moderna 18+ know Atlanta specifically, Georgia one worst vaccination rates country. Definitely risking another surge reopen soon. Georgia open everyone getting fully vaccinated month longer places US. got mine megachurch handled National Guard Georgia, pharmacy, idk pharmacies it.

Again I'm commenting efficacy vaccines vacuum. I'm showing what's actually happening vaccinated people general public. reading way should. looking likely catch compares inactivated population,

Nope commenting vaccine performs person also said ""virtually impossible"", yet assume 1-in-a million euphemism unlikely?

Yeah guess missed part said wrong. Idk keep bringing really give fuck said.

I commenting 1 20 number, assumed 100% infection. even close reality therefore pretty useless number someone whose wondering often people still get covid they've vaccinated.

The 1 20 means nothing unless fully vaccinated person allowing covid positive person spit mouth. Yeah, can't give salmonella friend, gives brother, gives grandma kills her. Wow. Alright, well arent anywhere close page then. Im sorry yet learned happens government given unchecked authority.

This mild crisis India looks like, there's hardly excess capacity built infrastructure whether hospitals mortuaries.

Even ordinary pre-pandemic days good well equipped city hospitals I've wait 3-4 hours get bed. I've experience several times past years admit friends, family myself. Lots old people family needed hospitalization ultimately cremation.


Similarly crematorium ordinary day I've wait hours give bribe get slot. There's usually one two bodies queue often electric furnace would break they'd send mechanic. must present half dozen funerals last years there's always wait time hour least.

Everyone US eligible vaccine.

 understand happen overnight, June absolutely reason everyone wants vaccine US first dose. I'm saying one think are, seems like there's huge subset people unwilling let pandemic end. time move start getting back normalcy. government forthcoming let people following guidelines go back normal.

Trial data accurate, never enough samples get precise number.

For instance Moderna's trial, 9 people hospitalized placebo arm 0 vaccine arm (out ~15000 people arm). claimed 100% efficacy preventing hospitalization. absurdly misleading small sample; 95% credible interval (*) sample would 55-100%. course, stopped everyone incorrectly repeating 100% number.

When real world data tremendously larger sample size, data controlled inevitably get confounding factors. vaccination two huge ones: vaccinations unblinded self-selecting. unblinded, behavior likely (and course should) change vaccination (presumably) increase risk exposure. self-selecting, vaccinations might given first people highest risk exposure (e.g., healthcare workers group care residents) take COVID seriously (vaccine early adopters). Taken together could make risk many times different data shows; actual protection could 99% instance vaccinated simply 6x likely exposed vaccinated.

(*) Using Bayesian estimate uniform prior theta, probability event happens vaccine group; read true, covid vaccine little contracting virus make virus symptoms less fatal. every article vax I‚Äôve read said. Also new variant severe children young adults one easier variants contract one vaxxed transmit. mean pandemic total Nepal equal daily total India. population Nepal 1/365 India. similar infection rates according available data. get source enough data back yet. We're test subjects enough data gathered.

However, imply hospitals still overflowed, especially huge chunks even younger population vaccinated another unknown chunk natural immunity.

German variouse medical conditions (sever foot disability, asthma, allergies) family conditions (MS, Autism, artificial hips knees). 

The real issues life health insurance wanted additional shoes demanded refunds medical travles side Germany wanted go one world's best surgeons foot disability. Look vaccination numbers Northeast. 

Look deep south. Finally, something makes sense. Michigan around 1200 cases day peak around mid February. time US whole dropping rapidly 80,000 70,000 cases. US bottom mid March around 55,000 cases Michigan 2,500 cases starting rise. Michigan reached peak around mid April 7,500 cases time US peak 71,000 cases. means small rise cases US experienced month long period 33% cases came Michigan even though 3% population United states. peak US experienced almost solely due Michigan seen fact went cases time. Probably population older first dose creates robust immune response younger population. Also didn‚Äôt read article yet isn‚Äôt relevant Japan bad history vaccination. It‚Äôs created outbreaks AIDS. Hepatitis. Etc. past come haunt them. careful drug approval. Also authorized Pfizer also haven‚Äôt produced vaccines license yet. person stating fact, even advocate position. actually live several pre-existing conditions, assure first hand experience saying mostly BS, starting doctors ER staff turning away suffering (that's actually prohibited law), content basic UHC, always upgrade private insurance carrier, pay get VIP treatment exchange. 

What feel much important though Germany _everyone_ human right get necessary medical treatment insured receive minimal costs. get wrong, would claim German HC system perfect? course not, there's still awful lot criticise it, countries differently build UHC systems much better job cost effective, compared hugely expensive, predatory exploitative US system, still almost paradise. needs announce something Memorial Day weekend, Shore going insane whether anything not. excellent approachable info. 
I‚Äôve shared immediate family. 
I extended family ‚Äúhesitant‚Äù still, shall say. 
I expect get lit insensitivity rudeness sharing info them. valid opinion, one public health professionals allowed have.

It's also interesting seeing two common discourses mutually incompatible. Namely: 1) cdc dumb, clearly incentivize vaccinated, people get vaccinated see restrictions change based immunization percentage individual status. 2) open everything up, people chance get vaccinated, now, fuckem.

This even including places low immunization rates already ""open"". Germany, started shipping doses every GP really helped accelerate rollout. donating blood two days ago overheard one donors using talking points. **the fucking Red Cross worker** agreed started using talking points. Honestly Facebook ruined people United States. vaccinated? Going get second dose Sinovac (CoronaVac) eight days now. can't wait course, I've heard countries recognize certain vaccine brands comes allowing travelers in.

Knowing that, plan get Moderna family member's company time line -- likely July year country rather slow get brands. safe get Moderna top Sinovac? so, long wait Moderna jab? even wait all? Again, zero mention number tests done. I'm going assume still low.

Japan willingly let virus spread throughout country government proven incompetent. thing stopping terrible incredible mask compliance. 10 million, 10s millions less supposed produced Half restrictions NYC make zero sense. Bar curfews? Food bar? Masks outside all? 

Sorry, public officials don‚Äôt get pass shitty policy year thing. premise flawed, SK Japan aim elimination. Since Japan aimed elimination? look like data comment well spoken incorrect.

You cant chance reinfection exposed virus. would need adjust infection rate. 

19mil also includes partial vaccinations.  Sounds like German fed much propaganda.

I said depends preference.  can't even look anymore. Fauci gone far! /s basic pension system intended stand own

No? expensive ""2nd highest tax burden worldwide"" BS attempt basic math

Just put google. make able drink public basic freedom

Why keep drugs home bother people I'd prefer German smoking rates US child mortality rates given

I say US utopia, better options Germany. US extreme example point expensive social contributions Germany are. Measles around forever public health measures stop vaccine herd immunity. got sick first March 2020. started eye problems confusion last week February 2020. Covid hit hard neurologically. Still, tear later, dealing constant double vision well blurred.

I four rounds antibiotics 4x daily. least three rounds steroids. seems Benadryl helps gets bad day can‚Äôt constantly take that. 

I concert photography someone sneezed overall sick (looking back video have). went around get away time Covid really wasn‚Äôt taken seriously masks weren‚Äôt thing didn‚Äôt want get sick anything. Coincidentally ended one first state sick Covid symptoms showing two days specific concert. Months later still issue doctor explained exactly like this. contacts basically Petri dish stop wearing let anyone lick eyes. laughed mean... Bullshit. nonsense. wear mask, gloves everything still get affected virus one carrier coughs right eyes. 

Or go unsanitized closed spaces dozen people pass everyday( like supermarkets open space offices poor ventilation&lt;-- work at).

It's fun games realize get sore eyes headaches next 2 days, outting one places. Eye can‚Äôt believe  factual, non opion answer give based said local news Japan dont enough ‚Äúqualified staff‚Äù administer vaccines. want doctors nurses jabs. 

Unlike US nursing students, pharmacists, military medics, etc helping vaccination effort.  2nd highest tax burden worldwide. close top10 Europe.


Yes does. mean labor public drinking anything?

I want children grow public transit full drunkards like grew up, public places filled agressive drunkards Yeah sure nothing free. paid taxes. expensive long run. German health care costs half US health care costs.

You mention health care only. education. pension? one negative actually.  think he's referring principles, obviously great. Practice however shows different things. hard? people thread said better, vaccines around 90% effective (70% j&amp;j). That‚Äôs great, wearing mask help case. herd immunity reached covid rates go more, personally don‚Äôt find great sacrifice keep wear mask public moment. feel pain. Lol Plasma therapy beneficial covid-19 patients research back claim is? doctor literally said article said back May/June last year anyone lick eyeballs. said I‚Äôd try to. Let tell ya hard. might get COVID buying eggs, best avoid entirely. children super spreaders isn‚Äôt better vaccinate everyone?  Iam german never experienced ? wtf talking about?

&amp;#x200B;

I back pain Literarily scheduled 4 different specialists 2 weeks atm stomach pain took like 1 month get MULTIPLE doctors plenty different Diagnoses monday next specialist looking ( hopefully finding cause )

&amp;#x200B;

i could also simply called Ambulance 1 month ago get self checked hospital instantly simply didnt want cause doesnt feel threatening also got treated multiple doctors.

&amp;#x200B;

ER ? ask High priority get early.

if fear life dont go ER call Ambulance drive straight hospital INSTANTLY get care near instant hospital make sure PRE bringing treat got bed you.

&amp;#x200B;

also iam living main city like Berlin literarily living ""Dortmund"" shit hole got many ""dont go to"" areas plain criminal areas. doesn‚Äôt matter - going party spreading going grocery store spreading it. Either way it‚Äôs continuing unknowingly, carriers must pay. govt basically still distribution plans together, MDs nurses allowed give injections. stunning incompetence. year plan this, Japan, one takes initiative lest something go wrong get blamed. typically asymptotic, carriers.  Maybe clarify - vaccines reduce risk transmission. Maybe rate reducing symptomatic disease, though guess little bit less. say 80 percent effective reducing transmission.  


Certainly enough reduce case numbers dramatically.  


But US going weird spot 30 percent country refuses mitigation measures including vaccines masks - interesting test see natural immunity less effective long term vaccinated immunity. Europe EU only.

In country I'll probably get vaccine 2022 Seriously people bring wait times countries socialized healthcare forget mention people wait years America cant afford even get diagnosed let alone treatment. Can't shake hands, can't bump eye balls... next? European, two months ago also thought won‚Äôt get vaccinated 2022. speed campaign drastically increased planning done end July. Fingers crossed Japan finally gets going.

What reason using vaccines imported Europe ? 39 million doses huge number. Getting people‚Äôs arms would help lot.   things happen way often America. Also America people ignore medical issues years can't afford healthcare. much research anything medically related, specifically related health, trust primary care physician see 1-3 times year typically, knows medical history, actual discussions concerns with. first one say ""cancel"" takes blame. Neither Japanese govt IOC it. cancelled latest possible time massive outbreak makes impossible, go half athletes, virus outbreaks huge disaster. Thank insight. It‚Äôs good know alone. Unfortunately I‚Äôve reading long haul neurological issues associated post covid. think tip iceberg. particularly aggressively English French languages experience, languages natively spoken within borders.

The language barrier advantage. also initially reluctant get involved help get tested caused delay development. way test vaccines western countries Ebola prevalent due ethical considerations testing Africa. Secondly Ebola comes unpredictable bursts remote areas trials difficult run. Also research funding always scarce almost uncommon disease even many common  still wearing mask brain damage. Look around you.  record, I've observed promotion *vaccine skepticism* part Russian entities. China seems focused shaping narrative regards perception China itself.

Russia's hands much dirtier here, much I'm annoyed China's troll army I've observed sub. They'll downvote anything even mildly criticizing China, I'm curious post even though I've said far less disgusting Russian entities doing. know fucked even reddit calling bullshit   glass half full side, marine study showed reinfected mostly asymptomatic 10x less viral load. want get hit on? crowded temples become super-spreader places. understand people desperate spread disease kill even people.  That‚Äôs incredible. even people reduced mild/asymptomatic illness, really shows fantastic vaccines are.

Oh, wait.... that's EU, sorry! 


Let's see, UK makes behaviour wrong... Successful early initialising manufacturing sites? wait that's good thing. Successful early approval vaccines? No, that. Successful switching longer intervals? Nope, nothing wrong there. Staying silent press others made fools themselves? Nailed that. 

Ah see UK wrong, make easy target leeches Brussels use distraction, must punished. don‚Äôt think masks big deal *because* I‚Äôve wearing past year. real inconvenience pandemic kicked hadn‚Äôt adjusted yet. Fair point worst infections happend vaccination drive started 4 months worst 4 months.

So 1 10. vaccines aren‚Äôt able effectively stop viruses spreading, stop symptoms. That‚Äôs ideal vaccine bc dealing potential ‚Äúleaky‚Äù vaccine scenario. examples certain livestock vaccines. end virulent dangerous strain.
That said, human vaccines aren‚Äôt leaky like this. However COVID vaccine new technology lacks testing vaccines. it‚Äôs good question ask Yeah, Canada. Dug found article.

That‚Äôs question important and, I‚Äôm sure, real reason CDC still wants mask even vaccinated Sorry, bit smart ass. always found kind headlines odd. Probably not... may leave eggs runny absorbed easily skin.

/s mean weld people houses, like seen look like? Also 7- 14 day travel quarantines right testing quarantine dont know mean random lockdowns. dont lockdowns quarantines, also started giving vaccines. suggesting 'minor event' concluded without development? like choosing single frame film there's nothing left see?

Wat. Viable Ad5 SARS2 spike? Kids age 12 getting vaccine anytime soon. Assuming child high risk live anyone high risk not/cannot vaccinate, handling? staying home? 

Now adults family vaccinated, started venture bit: masking go uncrowded stores; masked play outdoors small groups friends; even started daycare 5 yo days week satisfied covid protocols. public funding Canadian scientists shoestring budget decades. ‚Äúthink‚Äù came about?

Get vaccine at-risk person. Stop listening Reddit, common sense. want last person thinking double mask 10 year old, trust me. way could find article about. doubt vaccines? Didn‚Äôt India change rules approve vaccines approved us, Europe, Russia? (I know it‚Äôs topic though) Welcome pathetic justice system

Should seized &amp; sold condo. Put $3mil back medical system. Small chunk bucket sure, it'll hurt way doesnt use producere vaccines now? sure producere less much can. agree. start use COVID tracing way imprison anyone gives COVID another person. people keep giving COVID others caused drag long.  still remember expert advice said, wear mask arent train professional know touch it, actually increase risk infection wearing it. 

Nothing like bad advice side condescension. Amen! People sub acting like we're clear. aren't. vaccines good dealing bit ago right now, rendered useless rate world going. Yes time reported numbers likely completely underestimated absolutely idea happening rural areas happening peoples homes. yes context matters, hand context matters‚Ä¶ ways (how much testing per inhabitant do, many excess death have? aware deaths? many hospital bed per capita have? Etc). 

So yes even put context crisis really bad. comprehend?

There variants circulation..while dominant yet...they may become so..that mostly escaped vaccine already. need continue wearing mask boosters Well entire pharma industry dominated Germany 60s, changed patent system American style system. 

Patents really issue laws 1960s. drug make patented, process make was. Multiple drug companies could make thing getting different ways. German way. 

France medicine patents 1791, removed 1844.

Britain allowed medical patents 1949 missed ""national opportunity"" pencilling. 

France switched medical product patents 1960 Germany 1967.
Until germany developed drugs anyone else. 

The lack vigor patents medical setting diminished 1960s. Us polio, Britain lenecillin, Germany everything.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* random Redditor I'm going say I'm qualified give real answer. I'll leave scientists determine.

But say masks great covid anti-measure. Minimal cost substantial returns. Honestly one last things done away with. almost everything mask on. Even high risk activities like school, public transportation, movie theaters, etc.

It's closest thing cake eating it, too. think high quality vaccines better (if delayed) option. Thanks this. know see first doses given time? bad? There‚Äôs much reason wear mask outside you‚Äôre crowd. Sounds like people actually following scientific guidelines. father poor, hardworking, Central American migrant yet vaccine. Please wear mask times think unfortunate people could potentially get sick innocently walking near thinking everything ok. need parts continuing stop spread wearing masks around anyone all. Well paywalled can't read I'm even sure helpful vaccine global access? countries getting shaft ones storage transport vaccines extremely cold temperatures impractical impossible.

The adenovirus vector vaccines far practical problem seen India shortage supplies needed manufacturing- patents held likes Millipore-Sigma actual vaccine makers.  Well know Falcons fill :'( definitely felt glee first shot. Second shot like ‚Äú can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm close feeling normal‚Äù  Fair enough! go-this get interesting. Fuckin great lol EU bit bloody quiet came German politicians leaking thought (wrongly) German media well Macron's comments. likely spurring new variant spread countries? super horrifying something happen fear mongering click bait, ""Pandemic still causing major problems good job fixing need more."" would accurate title get clicks would good news. data say, month month update.

I'd expect end 2-3 years since found SARS-COV-1. also top-2 country population, so... would spotted post mortem? looked Seropositivity numbers ""hesitant"" states? anywhere near herd immunity, like India thought clear lots people already sick once. enough though. People keep overestimating natural immunity. course, can't stay locked forever. threshold risk that's acceptable we've never shut heavily disease decades. would nice gave guidelines would answer warehouse/grocery store/hospitals/retail/etc essential workers going work every day since beginning. everyone states bud. Studies 5-12 year old started obviously take fee months complete. guess would early Fall mid Summer. guess would one way get people vaccinated, use replication competent vector deliver spike. course, people die resources require lacking. I'm sure we'll ever hit stage current levels vaccine natural immunity. see India's 8% 1+ dose situation quite different (also densely populated country imagine). one point, decision choose get vaccinated means accepting risks.

I'm curious even opened completely, would possible get hospitals overloaded doctors free help patients. god damn. done many studies yet. test sterilizing immunity, test everyone every days look asymptomatic cases.

Which CDC released 3-29 group healthcare workers, huge study, cover J&amp;J. data mix mRNA vaccines showed 90% reduction infection.

And that's amazing, still 100%. Ah, see pandemic denialists arrived Certainly, government much responsible lack infrastructure. Two obviously better one, yes.

I'm interested data whether getting one shot two shot vaccine better zero shots, know going able get second shot j&amp;j unavailable. 

A friend mine USA 6 days, returning Ireland next year, vaccine unavailable. get first shot two shot vaccine week, able get second shot. way get Johnson &amp; Johnson single dose shot return flight. know why, trouble understanding posts title. case one else confused,, ""shift work"" referring jobs people rotation schedule. e.g. nurses fire fighters. article tries justify claim people kinds jobs get covid. everyone vaccinated gets immunity though. Reopening quickly might death sentence (immunodepressed unlucky). vaccine 100%. fact lower efficacy variants even vaccines.

Amount vaccinated people, chances catching go low. Among mixed company goes (on average). surprise Here's mean welding NZ AUS currently lockdown, cases go short lockdown cases. Here's one example both, no? German newspaper 'data' German politicians.

AZ UK tried send vaccines stopped UK stolen purposes. Trying say nuts.

UK export ban way. EU welcome open vaccine production plant use UK wanted, UK block going EU. still weeks everyone wants one full access plus 6 weeks full immunity.

Many urban areas ares still running shirt supply. India undercounting cases first wave. There's sero surveys implying same. Mostly many cases mild/asymptomatic people want get tested. hiding deaths. Hospitals overwhelmed, people dying respiratory distress. variant super aggressive that's one reasons India overwhelmed right now. still restrictions use masks. want fully reopen 50% may turn enough. Remember herd immunity depends R. reopen R rises, percentage required herd immunity rises too. even get zero keeping restrictions quickly import new cases abroad. Brazil started vaccination elderly February, know right? week finish vaccination elderly, actually.  massive shot shortage.

Some friends getting slots July! None vaccines 100%. safer still wear mask less safe situation.

Once/if reach herd immunity, need masks. course needs average herd immunity everywhere nationwide -- like jave 80% urban 40% rural.  suddenly said wear mask vaccinated, get whole bunch people saying they're vaccinated personal freedoms request proof.

And they'd die blame. problem? doesn't, technically, got focus killing one particular group society COVID-19 care Hindu Muslim. dying droves. UK allows exports well.

The EU welcome open vaccine processing plant UK thing stop sending vaccines EU. laws enforce restrictions? countries well majority citizens actively try killing loved ones going outside trying live normally

Yeah, dumb-ass Hungarians! hell EU nothing pain arse vaccine nationalism. Deaths underreported least factor 5, suprised much much higher. course, everyone risk group covered law every insurance Germany. almost every insurance covers anyway everybody exceptions. true supply scarce last year. wanted get vaccinated october wait 4 weeks got new supply. Sure decision take vaccine accept possibility hospitalization Covid. chances low healthy young people (and *tend* type skip vaccine, least now). 

I agree, I'm favor giving like month since walk-ins opened area last week. gives people weeks get shot build immunity.

However, point, absolutely refuse comply requirements protect unvaccinated. Especially effective vaccines dwindling cases, really starting seem counterintuitive restrictions. virus bad bribe people take vaccine... Curious though- less 40% population type refuse get vaccinated? underreported due lack infrastructure, underreported government actively trying hide numbers. banning people social media, intemidate journalists even arrest people asking oxygen. note chart want made CDC itself. whomever made chart left off. CDC says so. remember low risk, risk.

Just like safer sex. vaccines 100%. Remember CDC surgeon general explicitly told us wear masks said wearing masks would harm good? thinking future pandemics. vaccines don‚Äôt work fast day day huge increase.

This seems like propaganda Welcome Team Moderna! u care man whatever need do? put ""not applicable"" left hand side. Tbey willingly left important interactions literally spelled CDC. Nope. Even government suppressed data, can't hide dead bodies. Hospitals overwhelmed first wave, people dropping like flies. variant genuinely worse reason India bad shape.

If mandatory certainly would get numbers up. primavera ain‚Äôt happening June cares. comparison would reducing cases (reproductive rate) similar amount via paying people get vaccinated. additional 20% unvaccinated population getting vaccinated would similar effect (...permanent...) lockdown.  problem small amount people legit health complications can't get vaccine.

Stop argumentative contrarian.

Coercive measures work without trust.  think Italy receives Biontech/Pfizer doses Wednesdays, see new records coming days well Healthcare alone drags US me.

So, chance I'm going wear one unless absolutely required. really understand people wear ""just because"". Thanks. sure downvotes. means vaccine interested getting know feeling safe taking it. think US surveils people? Trouble is, surveil things like wanting lower number deaths hands police, advocating peace, referring God ""Allah.""  I'll admit, pretty sour vacation going eat pics 2 months ago vaccines still hard get qualify. opened up, I'd say go fun (but little nice people still early process high-demand area). lack vaccinations somehow compels government officials maintain restrictions? that's dogmatic statement, really absurd illogical. first all, can't really expect sudden total compliance. second majority people follow them, yet spread continued. can't blame all

Exactly Yes, meant possession.  CDC say couple months ago think many 5X people may number positives identified? that's huge number people least antibodies.  put perspective - 1.5 months ago whole EU vaccination rate 1.1mln per day. Germany literally doubled vaccination rate April compared March. EU countries thing. We're almost 3mln daily doses EU. Yes, course. people around spreading doom logistically impossible vaccinate x00k people day germany, shown plain wrong. Deaths also much likely age group actually fully vaccinated, 70 years old. truly course disease, vaccines, would also trend younger people, right? That's happening all. group downtrending 90% elderly, significant fraction already fully vaccinated. also need take account something like 9% whole city population already fully vaccinated. possible overstate advantages one party states have. understate powers democracies, state emergency have. 

The key elimination strategy two complementary parts; eliminate covid internally stop entering. example powers democracies have, Trump stopped flights mainland China Executive Order - even law change. tools required eliminate covid available democracies -as example, Australian state Victoria eliminated (via hard lockdown) covid outbreak deeply embedded community rapidly growing. What‚Äôs example? interesting, I'm noticing subreddit becoming favor vaccine passports. Youyang Gu's model predicted 28.6% infected February 21. Since 3.3 million recorded cases, conservatively ballpark 8 million actual cases.

For 328 million people, 28.6% 94 million. Add another 8 million we're probably around 31% caught COVID point. week Lithuania (2.8m population) received record amount vaccine doses:

105k Pfizer, 13k Moderna, 95k AZ, 6k J&amp;J somebody say Yoga? adults. Total population 43%, although even amount lead decent level herd immunity receive second dose. Coronavirus deniers idiots, public health hazard pandemic. Pre-vaccine engaged superspreader events resulted uncountable excess deaths expenditure, present potential incubators vaccine resistant virus mutations.

***You*** misled, *you* need information. ‚Äî Germany‚Äôs domestic intelligence service said Wednesday would surveil members increasingly aggressive coronavirus denier movement posed risk undermining state.

I'd argue best poorly written. 

The way interpret surveil members deniers movement. I'd hope see ""aggressive/violent"" members. difference. 

I 100% agree surveil hell violent extremists. someone however says ""I disagree lockdowns"" rise level IMO. source Sputnik V good ""premier"" USA vaccines?  u need sprays (nasal throat) 'protection'? long spray work? No.  

The intelligence service question Verfassungsschutz literally ""constitution protection"". full name is: Federal Office Protection Constitution. One main tasks exactly this: Gathering intelligence individuals groups who/which threatening democratic order Germany.  

This central element ""defensive democracy"" (wehrhafte/streitbare Demokratie), political system Germany. system born experience made Weimar Republic period. democratic system Weimar Republic weak protect democratic liberties provided groups incited hate violence. result, defensive democracy system enables public institutions act anti-constitunional individuals groups - even actually commit crimes.  

So no. opposite: Surveillance anti democratic individuals groups sign defensive democracy alive well. saw article week ago Israel paid rabbis push vaccine. IMO tactic would work evangelical leaders really believe anything lining pockets. Pay say God demands get vaccinated. Yeah seems gross, goal get many people possible vaccinated. New Jersey- 50.8%

Let's goooooo!!! governor recently announced we're track reopen state (in stages) I'm really encouraged fact we're safely population embraces vaccines.  posession goal right? idiots everyone knows about, American refer idiots ""your idiots"" instead ""our idiots"". saying we're idiots. brought up? live news conference, Provincial Health Officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said vaccinated mean transmission stopped precautions must remain place seniors care homes. 

""You transmission even people fully vaccinated,"" said. ""The illness seems milder transmit much [and we] see rapid explosive outbreaks.""  comfortably pass US uptake. doubt. Germany far, far secular US.  course statute reasonable society would means deal beyond putting surveillance.

But irrelevant apparently thread title totally misleading fact put surveillance various reasons.

My last post thread, everybody else gets blocked waste time boring. Moderna, think good then? weeks delivery probably still controlled, meaning figure likely doesn‚Äôt even include increase. June wild month vaccinations EU sure! enough vaccines could deliver way 1M/d? That's great. CDC basically saying well fair unvaccinated come rights. making argument anti lockdown crowd making entire time: ‚Äúhey risk low accept extra risk life covid, let you‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm saying wrong. end day CDC trying maximize health even cost liberties normal life Exactly. born German, tried it... like it. :)

I kid. I'm German / US Dual citizen residing US. Yikes, wonder amount Covid deniers high. Stuff like adds fuel fire. Interesting. know multiple people previously tested positive gotten vaccine, including myself.

Why getting it? he's telling truth post history, German, he's American thinks he's German. parents emigrated US.

Judging comments, never lived Germany, least length time. COVID deniers aren‚Äôt idiots. They‚Äôre putting others, take seriously, lives risk. definitely matters. understand politician much less parent willing get kid sick (with illness) suffer that, even deadly, prove point believe conspiracy. JFC comment section become shitshow? Yeah, contrary popular belief Berlin neither expensive city opportunities  good article. Right Thanksgiving war States rights lol back office long? post know behind paywall vast majority redditors *not* paid Economist subscription?  journalist India says 10,000-15,000 probably accurate albeit conservative estimate. horrifying number. might getting worse.     need keep increasing it. offer $100. number people gets vaccinated well worth it. start working angles get people vaccinated. honestly think $100 cash get bunch 'hesitant' people get shot. problem misinformation campaigns internet constantly pushing narrative vaccines unsafe take vaccine there's ""long term data,"" whatever means (months? Years?)

Fear powerful grows stronger. ""long term data"" seed misinformation grow stronger stronger. find ways combat kinds misinformation, really tricky. Nobody buys going wake one day look vaccine data (let's kid ourselves, people looking *any* data, listening idiots like Joe Rogan) change mind. encourage ways got nothing lose tried literally kidnap certain non-essential activities like sporting events, festivals, concerts, international travel, etc.

That's reasonable people ever saying for. Right, thread vaccine passports domestic events like concerts. think may agreement there.

It's unfortunate fact life people vulnerable disease make different choices rest us - that's case it'll case figure solve underlying medical problems create vulnerabilities. Anything outdoors going less risky indoors. think fully vaccinated, risk going pretty low, especially region cases going day. 

""Attending school/college in-person"" probably hardest assess, talking classroom experience? include living dorm setting, socializing bar, etc. part typical college experience? Eh. People love shit US healthcare ICU beds per capita US anywhere else world. US around 35 beds per 100k people India less 3. yes it‚Äôs expensive uninsured it‚Äôs illegal refuse treatment emergency situations. /s appear case. made claim provide proof form study cdc conjecture. showed following second dose vaccine (the recommended number doses), risk infection reduced 90 percent two weeks vaccination.

So wear mask protect others then. lot people haven‚Äôt chance vaccinated yet.

If can‚Äôt tell difference flu covid, don‚Äôt know you‚Äôve last year.

You using poor logic, wasting energy don‚Äôt want wear piece cloth mouth short times certain settings.

Exercise patience, protect others. Don‚Äôt self-centred douche disregards others. Yeah, JFK EWR direct flights day, every day.  vaccinating white folks biggest issue, you‚Äôre suggesting, government spending millions dollars targeted campaigns get black people vaccinated? Campaigns involve mobile vaccination clinics, vaccine hesitancy education, working pastors trusted leaders black community encourage people get vaccinated?

If bigger issue white community, isn‚Äôt government spending millions similar vaccination campaign white community address vaccine hesitancy counter misinformation working trusted leaders encourage people get vaccinated?

I‚Äôm opinion vaccine hesitancy problem communities America government needs addressing every community, select zip codes based skin color. Yeah. analogy relate contagious disease all. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article mask lockdown winter, stops happening every winter? virus always exist. really wasn't.

Thanks!  costs $300 sick visit I'm going unless feel like I'm die.  recall hearing something last year idea ""viral competition"" -- one virus crowd another's ability engage hosts. seen talk since, keeps coming mind see stories like flu cases record lows. friends &amp; colleagues kids say point pandemic parents divided 2 camps: feel kids missing school &amp; ""childhood"" risks lingering effects infected minimal; who're still super cautious want kids others family circle statistical outlier case Long Covid. people general. Probably waiting see get away vaccinating still get enjoy reopening Maybe two different writer staffs print version online version ( like SPIEGEL ) example?

Otherwise can't really think reason NYT would fall click bait sudden. get nit picky .. headline wrong, many already pointed : EXTREMLY misleading, homework sibling get grounded. That's nonsense. Rapid tests good PCR tests. 

Im sure would even get covid test vaccinated symptoms get ready voted oblivion. I'm huge advocate vaccine-tied stimulus check. surprised much people willing set aside reservations told give them, hell, even $100, get vaccinated. man people really really really really suck making risk-reward calculations. there's reason novavax safer whatsoever, mention massive wide open window one could catch covid waiting trAdItIonAl vaccine. know when. Article relatively empty symptoms 2 days. flight hawaii short end 8 hours. enough virus plane airport that's already significant portion waiting time. 

Stress, poor health, long exposure time seems bad   thing, iced days gone. Doctor necessary. subreddit full people also active anti-mask COVID denier subreddits. large parts day sub basically pro-COVID. 100% going mask crowds public transportation flu season. Wearing mask nothing. flu awful. Maybe flu numbers skewed cases misdiagnosed covid? seems like plausible explanation part.

Will say though, towards end summer allergies flare (ragweed) symptoms almost nonexistent due wearing mask last summer. bet I'll wearing one allergy season. Would much rather take allergy meds. understand point. also understand number people ‚Äúrefusing‚Äù dropping since vaccine idea. open availability 2 weeks‚Ä¶ immunocompromised maybe 4% population, many temporarily immunocompromised, like chemotherapy, they're saying aren't. Permanently immunocompromised closer 1%. elderly protected special senior living rules. 

We can't run country special needs 1% us have. sounds cruel spread vaccine everyone wants it, encourage it, resume life normal. choose vaccine eventually going get sick (depending size population). immunocompromised probably going avoid stadiums concerts crowded shopping. know else do. avoid go enjoy 1% us avoid them. Stadiums concerts retail shopping viable 25% capacity, gain anything punishing everyone. stay home take risk. 

**The problem passports solve flying countries fully immunized yet.** replaces ""negative test within 72 hours"" super inefficient marginally ineffective strategy. also replaces ""quarantine 2 weeks"" us cannot afford all. want passport? fine, can't travel easily, settle one two shitty alternatives. Problem approach variants evolve get foothold. International travel really isn‚Äôt important people. domestic travel isn‚Äôt showing signs vaccination requirements. 

The hard truth unless find way make vaccine-refusers lives less comfortable, passports large events, they‚Äôre getting it. Again, warehouses monolith, ""other workplaces"". gets though find plenty posts 1 2 months ago talking 1 2 months. People gonna say ""1 2 months"" forever. also reduce spread highly effectively. people vaccine passports generally see way entering stores, businesses, restaurants, venues like used Israel talked used UK. provide proof vaccine school setting, like always done US, different concept vaccine passport. think say flu cases decrease globally means general far less flu cases areas dense population would previously spiked (before social distancing), causes data show overall, less cases around world. Small rural towns practice social distancing still hub flu skew data even hold enough merit negate generalization implied term ""global"". 

If entire state Texas decreased flu cases year aside single rural town holds school church various events regularly without social distancing practiced, flu could well continue spread throughout regularly would year. small town would outlier looked data taken rest state, enough impact say ""the entire state Texas seeing regular cases flu despite social distancing"".

Terrifying happening relatively young country. would guess flu would disappear, bet COVID control it'll make comeback. That's kind question anyone firm answer to, depend heavily health vulnerability person. think point question, look happened Michigan, whose outbreak took place time far elderly people vaccinated young people. median age hospitalized covid patients dropped something like 10 20 years, young people hospitalized point pandemic. aware child's underlying conditions I'd say pretty fair knowledge dangerous.  means focus appearance something rather actually matters. example arbitrary dining restrictions probably never limited spread first place. Bring on. kid turns 12 end July. She'll getting close birthday possible. tried get vaccine trials locations far away. Yeah also younger people less neutralizing antibodies. correlates less disease severity first place. immune memory may differ (longer) older marine recruits people severe disease. today That‚Äôs happens hoard vaccines guess least Alabama Mississippi? experience anyone claiming ""protect Constitution"" trying ""protect"" worst parts only... Agree that. Business easier time heavy hand. government tries starts road ‚Äú government forcing us‚Äù let business kinda feel like I'm middle two camps. would never take daughters flight without first vaccinated. enrolled 3.5 year old masked, outdoor soccer masked, outdoor dance classes. really want missing childhood things wanted learn interact peers. entire pandemic constant balance keeping kids safe Covid furiously trying find safe outdoor things learn socialize.   actually admitted presymptomatic thing either, people realize first day two sneeze, cough 1 degree fever harbinger things come. people _are_ symptomatic, feel sick enough stay home yet. Always distrust coughing people matter seem otherwise healthy motto. MAGAts tried hang Mike Pence Jan 6th. would bet older vaccinated person virus typically spread touch.

2. mRNA vaccines virus. shedding. time I've ever heard shedding thing vaccine finding traces virus feces. unless family touches poop regular, need worry.

[This talks fully vaccinated adults 94% less likely hospitalized non-vaccinated adults age group, meaning still end hospital despite vaccination.

But also, adults fully vaccinated yet. people can't vaccinated, due medical reasons. That's we're trying hit ~70% vaccination rate establish herd immunity. Since population hesitant get vaccinated, we'll need vaccinate lot kids ever reach number.

On top that, kids largely unaffected covid, sometimes still get sick even die. think number correct. 46,729 doses need either 2 Moderna/Pfizer JnJ. another \~270K 1 shot waiting second. assumption 1 shot get 2nd, considering two buckets separate. people get breakthrough infections know of... one else get vaccines? don‚Äôt work? in, point?

\- vaccinated 
\- crowded setting 
\- wear mask close someone think may vaccinated

Unironically.. probably two weeks point ""But gets free Windows updates rest life courtesy Bill Gates make 5G phone calls without even using phone thinking number. Totally outweighs negatives.""

Seriously though, can't reason batshit crazy. what? Put situation staying 10 days ICU bed, mask helping breath! could ignorant? Giants. shitty though. Try buy oxygen can, yes - take dying relative crowded public place (which *not* hospital). would accomplish absolutely nothing, would endanger everyone around you.

I get situation ground must complete horror show people thinking logically, they're still terrible idea. I've heard repeated lot, traditional flu symptomatic, right? current climate likely someone spread flu, ie obviously openly sick around people? know C19 transmitted asymptomatically. C19 precautions people take would absolutely strangle flu getting new hosts infect. Yup flu cause immune storms stronger (younger) immune systems Twinsies also vaccinated moron reporting system deaths Brazil works pretty much well.

J&amp;J must wondering thing started another trial used second dose. heard anything trial yet.

I'm 2 weeks second Moderna vaccination far know I'm covered get.

The side effects minor shot nice feeling know I'm unlikely die Covid-19. Well universal rule what's considered elimination level. Let's compare Japan well performing countries context.

Australia - 1,110 cases/1M, 

NZ - 522 cases/1M

China - 63 cases/1M, 

Vietnam - 30 cases/1M

Why would risk vaccine fully FDA approved barely year benefit? 27% Michigan adults say refuse get vaccine.

On question:

In US, I'm gainfully employed enjoy standard living far better German family similar education. global firm work for, income US firm twice European counterparts, even healthcare contributions, take home larger percentage it. 

I live fully paid freestanding house pool adjacent golf course go to. Quite honestly, I'm living resort-style life. 

Meanwhile, relatives similar education &amp; jobs back home Germany live tiny cramped apartments year go vacation live weeks way year. 

The US major problems sure, SUCKS unfortunate enough good income... people middle-upper middle class, I'd argue US damned good place live, many, many, many German Expats clearly feel way.

I know I'm going get downvoted saying US hellish nightmare place stay, people downvote expressing reality decisions, it. term ‚Äúdeath list‚Äù merely used support government overreach. Unless clear violent intent established, government persecuting following private individuals disagree respective government‚Äôs handling crisis. one single German congressman killed covid protestor last 1 1/2 years?  last one, **""I'm young healthy"" point infected w/ COVID19 often warps sense Smell &amp; Taste months (or potentially permanently)**. Sure likely die young, living w/o able enjoy food would huge quality life issue imho. What's hate? Schools many jobs definitely interested keeping people safe. Japan South Korea mask-wearing culture stopped from:

-	having flu cases normal years
-	not *detecting* flu cases last year

Clearly implied correlation exist. Try something else honestly hope I‚Äôm wrong think places like NZ Australia rough year vaccines implemented open borders. zero covid approach makes hard transition - vaccines really good aren‚Äôt 100%. already know ppl fully vaccinated positive. Luckily positive doesn‚Äôt mean super sick, that‚Äôs win still, still circulate. Esp kids vaccinated. do?  issue US want Cuba treating doctors slave labor, countries receiving low quality vaccines freely admitted China Russia? Hell, they've found live virus Russian vaccines Brazil!

So US oppose slavery bad medicines?  guarantee Querdenkers take extremely misleading headline one world's influential news outlets run wild it. confirms many completely f-ed conspiracy theories definitely help convince susceptible people delusions weird shit facebook obscure telegram chat, God-damn New York Times feeding delusions fake news.

Bravo. right. barely possible. bet goals written poll numbers mind. Germany going far higher uptake US. Shit southeast US might even hit 50%. Go Germany! Phylum....? barely know'em need understand covid vaccines make immune, reduce symptoms, means die end ER definitely get sick.  like extremists use Corona cover push agenda (""Reichsb√ºrger"" (Sovereign citicens US?) extreme right wing nazis) wow italy... really? like watching best pitcher game throw 12 strikeouts 7 scoreless innings take decision 1-0 loss like Mets baseball. I'm sure. Cebu metropolitan area gets 120 cases day (and dropping) 3% population. I'd say Manila hot zone areas relatively safe. Bad bot fine, use anyone McDonalds... honestly cant remember last time got order right that's go anymore. better real good variants they're coming late Eh end large majority France get vaccine even lot say wont. stop plane gets dock, put stairs it, passport check person bubble, put bus drive protected cell, take hotel stay two weeks without able leave. test every day they're hotel. That's vaccines work Pretty sure always gonna plan poorer nations regardless UK approach not. simply vaccines available give 2nd dose need give 1st dose many first. They're closed Sunday - reduces capacity 14%. nice increase May April well. first week EU received decent supply.   Living Alabama pisses lot.  guessed hand higiene, self isolation respiratory masks, would avoid flu virus, whome vectors transmission, ones people avoiding.

PS:Sorry bad english, non speaker here. Give fucking break. people go work? get food? Stop assuming people incapable incompetent they're low socioeconomic ladder. Nobody says ""nothing"" prevent infection. really good it. lot people claiming vaccines foolproof preventing infection claims like getting pushed back on.  Oregon better get it. Ugh tiresome you‚Äôre 2 weeks past second doses (or single shots JJ) you‚Äôre fine. Fellow Alabamian? There's lot overlap groups, can't double count them. growing evidence infection provide sort immunity vaccine.   honestly prefer stay place instead taking them... already going. good way get people vaccinated motivated go way get one. they're willing attend events, exact people want get one. fantastic healthcare. I'm actually employed excellent private health insurance.

In fact... grandmother (before passed) told doctors Mannheim, Germany needed urgent bypass surgery... oh btw, can't happen several weeks holiday scheduling.

My father similar diagnosis US (Cleveland Clinic) surgery later day. Yes... pay $2,500 yearly deductible... honestly can't complain one iota quality availability healthcare gainfully employed purchase health insurance.

Ironically, despite ""free"" healthcare Germany, know single person kind means Germany buy supplemental ""private"" insurance plans top that. Yeah - PA's population heavily big cities ""Pennsyltucky"", least % high even discounting folks.  Sounds right! Im Gen X I‚Äôm scared covid, also view fear vaccine idiotic.

Like pointed friends, used ride back trucks, ate fruit jungle juice, took random drugs raves 90s abandoned bowling alleys. 

I‚Äôm supposed afraid vaccine that‚Äôs TESTED?!! Lol. bunch wussies scared MaSkS dOn‚ÄôT wErK.... /s one four people get vaccine experience side effects much likely zero side effects side effects worse actual illness last shorter amount time get them.

I zero symptoms first shot mild arm soreness second. EU did. really enough doses all

yep, people stop blaming Germany it. nothing bureaucracy, supplies never lacked capabilities vaccinate people April 2021....people really still think this? Makes absolute sense.

And assuming infection model holds true (which also accurate far), getting near end mid-June, big drops throughout May. thats result..the problem shortage planning management Keyword ""during"" COVID pandemic. I've seen article recently common cold beating covid nostrils, basically blocking covid entering body.  I‚Äôm bummed supposed see King Crimson music bowl straight canceled, oh well understand correctly, Brazil unable approve vaccine vector replicating higher level threshold set Brazil.

This per Sputnik‚Äôs research something Brazil making up. Sputnik filing lawsuit Brazil‚Äôs regulator telling research made up. 

This, combined horrible presence Twitter, enough hope vaccine considered live. especially love implication they're pro science ones despite CDC literally week updating mask guidance saying outdoors sufficient reason wear mask. Whut? Children rarely symptomatic let alone hospitalized. 

If didn‚Äôt fill children last year aren‚Äôt going to. Regardless whether Covid measures really caused shift, can‚Äôt keep aggressive public health measures going indefinitely eradicate flu, costs way benefits public isn‚Äôt there. Maybe people agree wear mask flu season won‚Äôt agree six feet social distancing avoiding going anywhere indoors yearly basis. 

The flu likely gonna make comeback form soon ‚Äústrict states‚Äù open least outdoor masks begin fade year, even eradicated begin with.  hope Africa spared worst Sort strange article.... title overall tone article makes seem like UK facing sort uptick, every stat chart seen shows overall infection rates still low less plateaued again, stayed really low. 

People still watch Indian Covid variant, now, appear impacted UK significant way, least terms increasing cases. listened months. I'll bring listen it, curious. Emphasis mine. likelihood catching also dying caught it.

Yes, makes even less likely problem think it. two toll gates instead one.

First catch it, _also_ die it. Even catching likely, that's first tollgate. second tollgate death hospitalization.

You've made point quite well. even close.  New York right less cases, hospitalizations, deaths Florida Texas. fully expect improving weather vaccine effort, they'll one best states handling virus similar last summer positivity rate constantly 1%. April *this month* April 2020? 
Damn hope sake former‚Ä¶  much hate say it, think we'll probably get violent riots first. Germany much rest world, younger people stuck home without social life since last March, told would protect elders. 

And elders, got prioritized vaccine, youngsters still stuck homes, get go enjoy freedoms depriving young people of? unfair.

Until majority population vaccinated, nobody get freedoms. give freedoms, ready backlash, ensuing rule flouting corona parties.  major difference flu covid covid contagious 24-48 hours symptoms show up.

As November 2020, asymptomatic spread disproven 10,000,000 person study. one case Stringent COVID-19 control measures imposed Wuhan January 23 April 8, 2020. Estimates prevalence infection following release restrictions could inform post-lockdown pandemic management. Here, describe city-wide SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid screening programme May 14 June 1, 2020 Wuhan. city residents aged six years older eligible 9,899,828 (92.9%) participated. new symptomatic cases 300 asymptomatic cases (detection rate 0.303/10,000, 95% CI 0.270‚Äì0.339/10,000) identified. positive tests amongst 1,174 close contacts asymptomatic cases. 107 34,424 previously recovered COVID-19 patients tested positive (re-positive rate 0.31%, 95% CI 0.423‚Äì0.574%). prevalence SARS-CoV-2 infection Wuhan therefore low five eight weeks end lockdown.

 Even Fauci said might exist, major drive infection back day, results study peer reviewed published. Gotta hang tough Idk pathogens weird pathological personalities express different ways different phases outbreak.

I remember chapter book ‚Äúspillover‚Äù broke interesting stuff measles.  Like vaccines measles would sort burn (but totally) populous areas 200k area 200k would never end.

Yeah, it‚Äôs going one large game chicken see major company drops mask requirements first, one does, dominoes fall. anti-american thinking, biontech vax american, that's it. debate regarding lol. Furthermore, look proportionate % vaccines used world wide....Yeah. Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine developed Netherlands. :) Right? doesn‚Äôt make sense me. way vaccine works every time unvaccinated person would guaranteed catch Covid, vaccinated person catch 5% time, tells I‚Äôm still safer society vaccinated people. think chart referring settings there's mix vaccinated unvaccinated people. Tbh like CDC clarify chart. chart address fully vaccinated gatherings. 

The [guidelines says group vaccinated people indoors need masks. Vaccinated people also need masks visit one unvaccinated household that's high risk. saw guidelines month ago actually big reason got shot. vaccines help prevent transmission massive way.

Imagine keep mentality using mask cold/flu, much would change whole world saw someone know day say MSM report it‚Äôs likely real, find news it‚Äôs real. top also believe government control weather (or ‚Äúfriends‚Äù least, dunno widely it‚Äôs believed) probs think government faking extra money control something think mean distributed administered.

There large number doses discarded due expiration human error. mRNA vaccines best ones available, also fragile expire quickly. entirely normal, understand 80m doses sitting around warehouse somewhere.

US ever able get rid it? problem, though, morons listen morons. flu also drastically Oceania, minimal covid?

The viral interference theory can‚Äôt explain all.

What makes sense everyone *enough* masks/distancing/flu shots heavily suppress flu.

But covid contagious. reduced spread flu also reduced spread covid ... well enough bring R(eff) 1.5.  covid cases still went exponential countries. Incompetent administration white house  Finally something agree on. never said that. said CA agree poster masks security blanket one wants leave behind. ""Im idiot""

I dying live outdoor summer concerts, summer feast them! expecting side effects since flu shot usually gives chills first day, felt little tired first day felt fine that.

Everyone else family friends coworkers shoulder pain.

I think side effects less common appears reading forums online. Im NL also got Moderna. least-commonly administered vaccine surprised too. So, brilliant scientists multi-gazillion-dollar high-tech laboratory finally figured obvious going happen?

Money well spent! both? flu shot pretty poor efficacy. immune system sucks kind thing makes modelling hard. R0 really even well defined, since highly seasonal varies location.

In [January 2018 flu excess deaths increased quite quickly: four-week period. Using 5-day serial interval gives R(t) 1.45 period. period much lower, afterwards back 1. 1.5 might high point, sustained 6 months ""winter"" 40 generations going get anywhere near 10-million-fold increase cases. averages 1.06 would take ~7 years instead 1 year get ""back normal"" (but point transfer animal reservoirs would become substantial accelerator).

R(t) supposed somewhat 1 winter somewhat 1 summer seasonal endemic disease. biggest unknown surely still much immunity wane season without flu. 1.5 probably worst case regard. least testing. imagine people flu-like symptoms, get tested COVID, test positive COVID, call day. way flu 'disappeared'. I'll believe 'disappeared' worldwide see cases flu next winter. mean think messes DNA?

From table see 19 fully-vaccinated people admitted hospital COVID symptoms, 1 actually tested positive COVID, (19 - 1)/19 =\~ 94%.

And 111 partially vaccinated individual (partially vaccinated + single dose), 40 contracted COVID, thus (111 - 40) / 111 =\~ 64%.

Either way, Axios headline wrong, study conducted people already hospitalized definition studying ""prevention hospitalization."" Wow, life hard you.

2. Contact tracing
3. Rapid accurate testing
4. Travel restrictions

This involves citizen cooperation, government intervention, perhaps even private business cooperation. massively complex problem logistical sociological standpoint.

If awful, maybe we'd higher trust institution. post locked repeated rule-breaking comments. Please take time review [sub  county New Mexico 80% eligible adults least one shot 53% two shots. Tomorrow mark two weeks second shot. read somewhere many fans follow him. can't find article, correct edit post. Thanks comment.   stuck mentally toddlerhood like many people are, yes. fringe conspiracy theories getting mainstream precisely websites lack guts clamp misinformation.

Not really, getting worse exactly **because** websites keep clamping it. pushing people echo chambers never get exposed anything else. biggest issue social media sites use algorithms show people things drive time spent clicks, usually means extreme/conspiratory content. ""ban"" something (which usually actual content ban) attempt deplatform someone become martyr people get even curious they're saying could dangerous, drives views. 

Hell, Alex Jones got hits site content he'd ever had, exposure via content creators, youtube banned him. 

GoT great quote ""When tear man's tongue, proving liar, telling world fear might say."" I‚Äôve seen live comedy store (actually night bill showed well) Joe solid, good funny set. think specials goes way top, shorter, casual format comedy store good. 

And I‚Äôve seen Bill times he‚Äôs never bad show I‚Äôve to. Bear mind, ones elected deified reality TV show host decades legal issues ranging infidelity racism outright fraud... study fewer 4000 healthcare workers.

You asking CDC make recommendation based single study fewer 4000 healthcare workers.

That study points conclusion, may well true, holy shit dude. That's science works.

There two ways pandemic remembered. Either, 'we enough,' 'we much.' no, 'we exactly enough' especially virus around two years ago. vote 'we much.' whatever want moral agency 20 year old friends fine. wrong, neither I. graphs show day 10-11 point groups start diverge. Exposure would days prior. first dose, period lighter. second dose, though, normal period way worse cramps Good! honestly want know hell ever actually wearing mask jogging walking outside themselves??? assumption masks never necessary ü§® actually 1 20,000 .00005% reason people officially here. people careful aren‚Äôt anymore - either least partially vaccinated parents are, aren‚Äôt worried getting covid bc young. 

Personally, think dumb. know quite cases right it‚Äôs private socializing ‚ÄòSkepticism‚Äô among ‚Äòfaithful‚Äô hmm... seems people might actually wired entirely backwards Great question, things never 100% certainty. vaccine effective important everyone get get 100% effective. Meaning already several hundred cases Michigan alone fully vaccinate people contracting testing positive virus. also question long immunity last. heard reports infected virus regularly donating plasma longer antibodies present little 3-4 months time meaning could possibly reinfected. hopefully vaccine able last long chances already need booster administered point near future way heck enough people vaccinated time fully stop spread. worry also vaccine escape. vaccine completely dependent particular spike protein virus itself. first steps towards changing way new strain could develop developed immunity original covid-19 would recognize sort like annual flu shot influenza constantly changing. really giving virus opportunities already given learn adapt. heck nice see typical viral infections drop social distancing mask usage. Whats percentage fully vaccinated people get transmit covid? appears immunity starts impact around day 4-7 first dose Pfizer Moderna.

Everything read 14-21 days after.

Clinical studies show 14, Israel real world showed 21. data southern thing bias? dont give fuck cdc says regarding masks. lost credibility long time ago get Pfizer doses, AZ?  Color shocked opened two months ago, around mid Feb. saw cases go didn‚Äôt start go back mid March?

We basically kicked road, highest risk elderly fully vaccinated. Right? 

IM FULLY VACCINATED!!! NOW- uhhhh.... *pulls folded paper back pocket* attend small, outdoor gathering unvaccinated people without mask!!!! reason. multiple studies showing fully vaccinated people highly unlikely spread virus Amen brother mind ‚Äúone million‚Äù comment generalzation.

Theres way forget Im wearing jt might. ""We"" dont.

Get outta garbage. UN help country fast track equipment procurement network global contacts  people blame data, blame people anti-mask, anti-vaxx blame people think big overblown hoax guidelines? 

None would really matter people lining vaccine. supply time places people complain loudest. Trying blame CDC despite people's refusal acknowledge reality laughable bullshit. really good news  Ah ok, realize that. bad. dumb.  Seriously, vaccine works mask needed? vaccine doesn‚Äôt work get vaccine? 

If we‚Äôre free society mandates needed. 

From CDC federal government go full freedom.  Don‚Äôt want COVId? Wear mask get vaccine. Done believe either, free get COVId whatever.  Everyone free person free society.  responsible need stop wanting big daddy government tell everyone else live. Time let panic, fear hype end. I‚Äôd take JJ. Odds we‚Äôll want booster that‚Äôs tailored variants later anyway. none. Ahh yes, I'll make eating indoors restaurant safe wearing mask eat... desperation convince people take precautions meet rest us halfway showing poorly thought recommendations like this. Holy shit bro. No, nationally conducted poll. Across whole country, ""an inner city"" (we know mean that, thanks identifying quickly?

Astonishing read that. Really - I'm shocked. shocked face. üòê think it‚Äôs that, think it‚Äôs human family actually communicate conversations current pains fears impending grief. pets feel even responsible they‚Äôre helpless without us can‚Äôt even communicate everything make comfortable less fearful death. currently approving massive festivals 500k+ people. Reverse psychology? mind ask main reason decision? Well I'm thinking it. Every adult became eligible April 16, obviously everyone could get one day. whatever reason, may people wait bit get one. I'll allow one month grace period want shot get one, think plenty generous. 

&amp;nbsp;

So middle May first dose. worst case get Moderna four weeks second dose another two full immunity. lands us right beginning July. 

&amp;nbsp;

So simple matter courtesy people I'm going follow mask guidelines end June. that, I'll stop wearing one unless required. Enough life sacrificed stopping spread Covid-19; draw line somewhere July 1st seems good place any. 

&amp;nbsp;

But that's calculation. knows indoor spaces like stores theaters stop requiring masks matter policy. 

&amp;nbsp;

Also get sick future, like cold w/e, need go store I'll probably put mask courtesy. I‚Äôve heard two weeks, course doctor knows better. right two benefits vaccinated people have:

1. Easier international travel (then many people don‚Äôt travel internationally, plus travel restrictions remain place anyway.)

2. afraid catching COVID. Except people stopped caring months ago, ones care already got vaccine. 

So what‚Äôs incentive here? Go live bubble Yes useful India there's poor rural urban areas.

 US would say overall average rural US clinic better equipped many smaller Indian clinics. I‚Äôm actually curious, isn‚Äôt sarcastic, doesn‚Äôt vaccine mean longer need mask?

I mean obviously wear one public I‚Äôm asshole, like wouldn‚Äôt gym safe without one fully vaccinated. I‚Äôve bought many reusable cloth masks I‚Äôll wearing far Covid  Two weeks last shot.

I got 2nd shot days ago, feel like champagne cork go off. J&amp;J study showed efficacy increasing day 56. fact willing sacrifice even 1 kid go without mask telling. I‚Äôm curious, son (18 )is serious fatigue problems ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù look like seizures not. Almost catatonic. used collapse. sleeps 18 hrs after. Drs don‚Äôt clue what‚Äôs going on. daughter episodes? always exhausted.  sick last January.  came 3 months. Went away summer. Got covid ‚Äúagain‚Äù November came January lasted 5 months.  It‚Äôs ruining life think hard argue high vaccine use + high restrictions created situation dramatically reduced spread Covid

California high restrictions going last peak, hard credit that. Vaccination demand may high, percentage population vaccinated big enough Feb drive cases, though probably high enough keep down. Texas, pretty similar case pattern CA (peak Jan, sharp decline Feb), lower vaccine demand, low restrictions. must variables affecting case rate. much longer one stay mostly inside? 

Starting March-April 2020, safe normal things outside.

Once get vaccinated, safe normal things inside. Sometimes see people head public bathroom without washing hands. even much frequent covid.  Same. scares nothing that. One coworkers wife got it, yet never got it. Another coworker mine work 3 full days infected testing positive somehow one else managed get it. lot people really lazy masks whole time, going indoor dining lunch everyday. Really surprised never big outbreak. I‚Äôm vaccinated thankfully. ZERO outdoor air ventilation, popping window slightly everyday. call positive cases individuals test within hospital system. far, I've 10 people full series test positive COVID. asymptomatic thankfully.  Makeshift ones. see gravediggers India going try tell India isn‚Äôt Covid crisis. \*yet  reported side effects urge everyone so. guess bias towards low numbers side effects far majority older. younger people become majority vaccinated suspect proportion side effects change lot.  even fill stadium home opener. Besides home opener, they've one game 30k fans. Every game like 50% attendance. [South Africa India countries requesting vaccine open countries already infrastructure place make vaccines. granted ability create AZ vaccine, could build factories--not enough, probably, quickly, sure, amp production vaccine, YEARS developing nations get anyway. say nothing fact many experts predict COVID-19 continue circulating evolving vaccines need develop combat it. still making COVID-19 vaccines ten years that, Africa India tremendously benefit production information shared. know they'll access information, know worth investing necessary infrastructure. not...then developing nations continue dependent wealthy ones vaccine.

I'm sorry rain parade, I'm astonished willing jump defense billionaire turned huge profit pandemic. Bill Gates gone requests delegates South Africa India nonprofits. vaccine's development obviously incredible technological achievement creators celebrated. ghoulish capitalists seek twist even miracle science ends? give pass people something awesome. existence billionaires continues great injustice, Bill Gates' actions continue prove never ""good"" one.  *piano*: mask off

When *forte*: mask fully vaccinated then? see going would bad. incentive getting vaccinated. Got it!  people going say ""why rush this? We're close finish line"" next year. cases explode Georgia pull back wise I'm happy them. thats good point. suppose check antibodies? lot harder presenting vaccination. [Possibly early May looks like Less 1 ten thousand. fair, put forget it. Sometimes I‚Äôm like 10 minutes drive realize take off. Tiny.

I think smallest one make. Pretty sure mine were. *fast*. Like, *so good* *so much practice* lately, sleep now. 

Tell nurse fear needles, someone ready help get dizzy. Got shot? Come out!  Don‚Äôt get it? things vaccinated people do, non-vaccinated well. green passports going movies bar, really, what‚Äôs incentive? people travel internationally benefits. Uh yes fucking big deal. Also username checks Probably vastly underreported due lack infrastructure. still need guidelines. braves allowing 100% means people following guidelines likely spread disease others. soon allow full capacity. problem stadium open considering going one. think we're ready full yet.

And far time allow - little bit longer ""technically long enough adult fully vaccinated"" would. good... EU 2x US population? Per capita EU actually good US, improving. far away motherland family. Last year hard family. Lost lot people. bracing impact year. heart tired eyes tears left. people still wearing chin masks going events, beyond me. PhD help determine whether government trying control fear. nothing expertise it‚Äôs much difference

It's not.

You whatever need feel better getting jab. make sure get one (or two). like one twenty 

Not quite. week, U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention¬†told CNN¬†that agency far received less 6,000 reports breakthrough coronavirus infections among 84 million people fully vaccinated nationwide.

About 1 14,000 vaccinated people caught covid. 30% asymptomatic. 

For reference 1 15,000 people struck lightning. fact don‚Äôt know problematic albeit true. I‚Äôm saying right - people refused beginning people tired defined end point, realistic IMO expect certain % ppl follow guidelines. Imma honest. really difficult wear mask? work grocery store wore almost 12 hrs day. keep sht 3 months entire pandemic history. many crybabys cant even sneeze theire elbow proberly. appears immunity starts impact around day 4-7 first dose Pfizer Moderna.

It improve point onwards towards 90%+ one two weeks second dose. Yikes, three four experience severe side effects? Same, J&amp;J. two way heavier periods covid itself. can‚Äôt stand man Gov. accent national treasure. haven‚Äôt heard talk, say say look up. üòÇ uncrustables never make laugh reason  nuts. many vaccines available, people getting paid bring people get them. 

I want one. Hell, I'd pay $50 get point! Wow they're cranking new vaccines like crypto tokens Yes many kids dying acceptable go without mask? 1% get sick? 0.5%?   went eat past weekend, first time year, lady restroom straight walked using toilet without washing hands. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Wow really weird - made comment earlier today article posted NY Times showed Pfizer manufacturing process. entirely different thread? Weird. Must glitch matrix... Maybe excess deaths report still 1:1. Every eligible person gets vaccinated also counts person total population counted also.

Your point ""fully vaccinated"" locality city block would different percentage based upon demographics one reasons track ""% eligible"" instead continually determine demographics every time looked see close done are.

So mind eligible, think way obfuscate numbers. Overall population % important, yes, also important know close handed vaccines eligible, planning around getting last bits eligible people. good metric too, nefarious thing math undo ""obfuscation"" 4th grade division. Good sad truth that‚Äôs going problem matter many people vaccinate. hell care? part. got first shot getting second tomorrow. family got except brother wait two weeks get second. keep everyone care done right thing? bunch people want assholes get vaccine that‚Äôs them. Let live consequences let live life. Walking outside yourself, half mile anyone masked else isn‚Äôt precautious ... it‚Äôs stupid ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Maybe there‚Äôs cultural / experiential divide ppl live crowded cities v sprawling suburbs.  resumed normal activities last week, 2 week second vaccine hit. friend over, also fully vaccinated. went visited another friend baby recently. I‚Äôm finally going store instead using instacart order pickup grocery store. finally eat inside places offer it, work lunch break. 

Prior went work, went home, followed things asked us do. reason fully vaccinated individuals wear masks. I‚Äôm published scientist kidney field, even could set study screen vaccinated spread corona. havent they? nouthing compared Indian variant  one spectrum, anti-mask, anti-vaxxers. end spectrum, snooty ""no risk acceptable, follow science except science interferes narrative"" people. making terribly difficult us crawl way back normalcy Honestly point it‚Äôs even worth limited capacity can‚Äôt really pods. Common cities US Northeast.

For part US suburban South, people mask going retailers, masks come soon one leaves store. I've spotted couple people wearing masks cars.

The CDC guidance focused social norms, ""Wear masks indoors non-household members packed crowds outdoors, otherwise they're optional."" speaking truth anybody ounce common sense would agree you.

But reddit, fear rules peoples lives, people appear want pandemic last forever, want use masks forever. literal insanity. correlation differs location since age demographics different. 

Using percentage eligible population way obfuscate numbers.  problem small amount people legit health complications can't get vaccine. guess people probably smart enough take precautions protect themselves.

But yeah, point I'm sure case numbers drop point mask recommendations relaxed 100% population access vaccine. reach immunization numbers get legit herd immunity then, could plausibly end situation un-vaccinated people get sick high rate. imagine people refuse get vaccine people pandemic deniers anti-maskers.  No. zero studies show still spread covid vaccination. Likewise, zero studies show spread covid outside. studies far P.1 took specifically evaded ""herd immunity"" there. thing happening Delhi - antibody tests indicated 56% population immunity earlier last year yet they're absolutely ravaged B.1.617 right now. That's modern miracle team deserves hundred Nobel prizes India variant concern? Lol getting downvoted cautious pandemic. bunch weirdos here. Putting aside logistical challenges red tape shipping vaccine internationally, Pfizer Moderna even approved use India yet.

Definitely pray go waste though given many folks around world desperate vaccine. Two weeks standard advice. People, vaccinated not, wear mask outside SIDE! absolutely amazing man people given church Covid left common sense reasoning door.  100k Wow, sending prayers friend‚Äôs family‚Ä¶stay safe! one side planet, people casually getting because, even though they're free. side planet, people literally begging them. FFS. bills pay too. Tell that's supposed happen sink-or-swim society ours? much lake? GREW EXTRA LEG VACCINE

jk low grade fever like 12 hours Dunno. first wave Spanish flu hit March 1918 mostly July 1919, pretty much time frame now. January-March title give away fact likely account currently dominant variants. believe whatever makes feel better guess ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è psychololingustics professor college testified Washington Vioxx. read us sample black box warning written scientists shit writing none us top ten university could understand it.  
Scientists need learn write public. Fully vaccinated, 96,747,454.

So that's 0.00012403%. 99.99988% effective death entire sub infected steady stream background Q crazy point. one side politics isle consistently wrong entire pandemic without question, yet mods demand 'no politics' pure politic people come fight deny usefulness masks, closures, vaccines. disagreeing with? infographic post literally CDC saying masks still used vaccinated. much social media reporting saying research support makes doubt research. like (have shots.) give private lessons you‚Äôd like.. far J&amp;J goes, miss point. can‚Äôt acknowledge there‚Äôs slight risk women childbearing age? you‚Äôre woman aged 12-49, you‚Äôre better taking Moderna Pfizer vaccines access them. J&amp;J option, go ahead take it. risks COVID far greater risks J&amp;J complications. 1) said directly exposed, numbers general observation, they?

2) want say 1-in-20 example misleading, fine. responding someone claiming 1-in-1,000,000 though, even father reality. said done, look mortality rates COVID compare typical death rates get ballpark.

But yeah, I'd imagine tons rural places without resources test properly classify deaths.  Problem antibody studies always sampling done. extrapolate whole population study true random sampling, hard super expensive, places done them.

Brazil's Manaus thought herd immunity one antibody study showed 40% positive rate, extrapolated think city 70% immunity, proven wrong city suffered absolutely brutal third wave. original study flawed recruited blood donors advertising free antibody testing, lot people believe previously Covid came get tested, skewed sample toward previously infected. study told us nothing immunity city, told us many people thought positive fact positive. Unless conference described exactly sampling, would put much stock numbers. Well I'm getting tested unless contact positive person started feeling ill. mean, there's 1:1 correlation vaccinated adults percent population vaccinated....it's coincidence governor set level 60% eligible, happens touch 50% entire population, studies come Israel etc showing 50% population knee curve.  post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Damn kids born six years 9/11, I‚Äôm old I'm cool still wearing mask pandemic still thing majority world, especially situations likely large crowd people. nahh. world stuff control feel confident immediate herd immunity thing, I'm really gonna mask I'm sick, I'm surrounded sick idiots stay home, pollen season. Spoiler: BioNTech/Pfizer Super happy exit criteria set. fair forecast something based upon things going. world changes, change criteria. exit light end tunnel good thing have. Hopefully states follow suit.  Ive seen CDC's WHO's stats, im good. Yet able eat restaurants without masks???

There's definitely something this. think serious long-term, dismissing situation hand helpful either. live similar echo chamber anti-mask, anti-vaxx crowd

Apparently state opening shit.  important realize masking policy choice completely different things. people continue, others won't. matter people want keep wearing masks, to. good thing authority figures US poised move forward resume life without restrictions Biden mentioned speech. believe specifically stressed importance vaccination roll back things like masking.  Thanks news media keeping vaccine hysteria going giving anti vaxxers BS ammo. Alright glad page know dont believe freedom üëçüèª dare they? Maybe judged harder posted comments they'd stop, good us all! It‚Äôs $50 people drive Detroiters get vaccinated people get vaccinated kids 5 2...I know feels.  Yeah, exactly said.  immediately

You think vaccination long line except wait home. gonna get shot I'm good 4G. shot gave 6G?? Sign hell Bruh. dare you. seniors vaccinated now. remaining unvaccinated people go spread covid amongst probably make dent hospital capacity. Can't find information long aerosols last air. 

I assume mask help mitigate risk first dose still taking effect. ""Hogan says hopes children able get vaccine coming weeks following conclusion trials 6,700 children ages 6 months 11 years old Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.""

Say hwhat?

I knew trials thought ready till late year earliest...did miss something?  Vaccines 100% effective preventing death, 90% effective preventing infection. Driving vaccination site far dangerous covid point. I‚Äôd rather wear helmet mask.

Mind you, I‚Äôm 19. chances dying covid practically near nil anyways. sources this? problem statement gives government ability anything long say interest pubic health. Certainly see issue that?

In eyes, governments purpose provide services people cannot provide themselves. Keeping ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù fall realm. Thats make sure family remain healthy. Pfizer one authorized 16-17. No. pay it. Oh nah I‚Äôm chillin it‚Äôs also occurred Covid naturally become less thing time much milder young. new young people born forward never lived world without covid, either vaccinated (approval kids already works) catch disease (possibly repeatedly) young less vulnerable serious effects thereby gain least degree immunity it. people alive today grow old pass away coming decades, thereby removing vulnerable population (ie, older folks unvaccinated and/or reached older age without ever infected). 
 
Along similar lines: possible existing coronaviruses cause colds, brand new newly sprung us, would cause nasty effects older people like covid does? (ie, older people hadn‚Äôt already exposure less vulnerable?) I‚Äôm confused. exactly expecting general public ‚Äúbetter world‚Äù terms global pandemic besides sitting asses home spreading virus? Awh guess someone upset longer justify basement dwelling life soon. You‚Äôre obsessed people‚Äôs behavior doesn‚Äôt effect you. Get life lol makes sense. Definitely sounds like city thing whereas it‚Äôs different car based ‚Äòburb sure. stay home want ?   Wisconsin! Dumb question. got second shot yesterday (Pfizer) fever *have* good ""sick"" cough day long. cough feel fine arm little sore. cough symptom shot? Clocks ticking count hours Haha right?! Indian government refused allow outside vaccines approved yet. What? 

70% San Francisco adults gotten least one dose. Detroit 20%? Yeah, literally first person even comment railed! understand it, based P1 (Manaus) variant, caused trouble Brazil recently.

The P1 variant important mutations common South African variant, shown antibody evasion tested vaccines (the results study Oxford/AZ vaccine particularly troubling). could make extremely useful vaccine near future. higher purpose government protecting freedom life(not confused lifestyle)? Right. $50 pop I‚Äôm sure would people willing lie identity double dip. would seem reasonable outdoor environments. I'm convinced works well theme park when, even reduced capacity, there's tens thousands people walking around. Concert-like crowds zero distancing build real quick.  


The part get require masks people 10 older? What's rationale parks provide one? went limited capacity Blue Jays game. people nannying everyone (who outside socially distanced) wear masks entire game. Seriously people... day CDC changed guidelines too. Annoying  Real totals wayyyyyy 200K. honestly believe 5% Biden voters vaccine hesitant, loco. People situation keep wearing masks. That's it. mean maybe? data already exists commented covaxin week ago got downvoted bunch. Tempted track comment add edit. remarkable much first dose shots collapsed. 15 days ago reached 7-day moving average peak 1,999,185 (never quite cracked 2M). We're 40% high water mark (compared 20% headline ""doses administered"" number folks getting second doses). 

The moving average going collapse next week second doses catch declining first doses. minimum I'm hoping long tail stays strong coming months. go buildings pretty often walking, annoying take earbuds, put on/take mask, keep mask time. National registry flags people 1/2 doses based name/DOB. Well, gosh. would thought vaccines actually work? I'm gonna get point weeks, currently know people still trying get vaccine appointment link isn‚Äôt locked behind paywall? can‚Äôt read beyond first paragraphs.   people want wear masks protect others, personal choice, government mandate.

Triggering offending somebody mean sm intruding somebodys freedoms.

Our freedoms absolute point amendment constitution needs passed remove them. never done covid. don‚Äôt care unvaccinated people get infected lol. I‚Äôm vaccinated. That‚Äôs them. keep scrolling. I've mine. got Jan Feb. actually work medical field, guess what. know tf I'm talking Thanks educating irrelevant concept! I‚Äôll keep Wikipedia article mind future reference go life wanting physically assault people. Tweets like exhausting. Really makes feel like won‚Äôt back normal anytime soon :( Good news, Dane probably best educated county state, therefore outlier sorts.  say seem like good idea vaccinate parents kids. vaccinated think risky since we've much time built in. It'll relief whole family vaccinated.

I'm also thinking child vaccinations we're going hit 70%. I'd bet getting 75% overall point J&amp;J pause. It‚Äôs huge list stuff Oxygen production delivery PPE vaccine components. 

This blurb also probably means AZ production won‚Äôt restarted Supplies: U.S. re-directed order Astra Zeneca manufacturing supplies India. allow India make 20 million doses COVID-19 vaccine. However still catch mild case right? also mean transmit disease? overly cautious sensitive. rest us like, duh course isn‚Äôt necessary wear mask walking sidewalk. Transmission almost never happened outdoors large, dense crowds people did. virus respiratory radioactive. Agreed. probably wearing masks lot protect peoples health, you‚Äôre right. freedom absolute, intrude someone else little ways. wear minute window, sign asking customers wear protect workers. I‚Äôm vaccinated don‚Äôt know that. Let's hope comes sooner rather later. Still really last couple weeks started become less hassle find jab Charlotte, hopefully there's still enough demand get us onto 60%+ really taper off.  ""So we're gonna get back normal?""

""Yes, guess could say approach normality soon.""

""So..normal""

""Perhaps, semblance normality definitely cards!""

""Right, really normal?""

""It definitely similar knew normal.""

""Bruh."" Huge increase could winter surge right?

Just went mean solely due covid vax wearing masks still popular opinion ""CDC sAiD mEdIcAl PrOfEsSiOnAlS nEeD tHeM"". Got downvoted multiple times telling people wear masks became popular.

I'm vaccinated. I'm taking masks off. CDC wrong start, opinion they're wrong now. vaccine for. Around 70% according Vince Racaniello Q tonight YouTube. They've setting mass vaccination site parking lot, idea used though.

Source: live drive pretty regularly believe it. study read said half Delhi slums antibodies assume anyone living better conditions lower exposure. half. means half antibodies. mention every city hit hard probably numbers high. 

There plenty unexposed people spread country stopped wearing masks went like normal.

Also, people vaccinated probably group covid. There's overlap supposed 50% group 10% vaccinated 16-17 year olds don‚Äôt 12-15 year old kids vaccinate. parents belong higher vaccinated rate groups make ones deciding vaccinate kids. cant really attest intentions... Thats pure speculation take account fact live democracy nothing done unilaterally. said anything achieved democracy accomplishment many one. first reaction. Gas price divided mileage there... live here. Smoky Mountains visited national park country. East TN chock full beautiful nature. I'm vaccinated, I'm transitioning mask wearing. That's vaccine for. That's thing. need vaccines enough people take them. could end restrictions today long got 70-85% population across states regions vaccinated virus die out. That's literally herd immunity works (vaccine induced herd immunity, ""let's get everyone sick"" herd immunity leaves disease somewhat controlled level endemic). 

People refuse vaccination slowing elimination *and* end COVID thing restrictions/masks/whatever else perspective. Yeah would suck ... hardly anyone wears mask outside (except walking store restaurant car). Nobody walking neighborhood etc. 

I feel like live (Ohio) it‚Äôs always masks needed outside 6+ feet apart - kids school eat 6 feet apart (outside weather permitting!) Parents haven‚Äôt wearing masks bus stop bc there‚Äôs 2-3 us standing least 6 feet apart. sports back kids ... masks aren‚Äôt really wearing bc it‚Äôs outside. Things definitely loosening probably bc everyone around area getting vaccinated. go further...are going sit pretend christianity religion crazies? Kind hard inject ice cube! ;-) 
Lol I‚Äôve yet meet person another religion try force feed fairytales rules tell I‚Äôm hell bound don‚Äôt believe certain way...and I‚Äôve travelled many countries. yes, I‚Äôd feel ever happen. People sure think know better science, they? Smh... stores mass gatherings.

That's choice then. Enough enough. Georgians since end March get shot. can't forever people dumb dumbs huge increase since that's gone down?

Off memory last year, took 10 days covid case bad enough get admitted hospital another 3 weeks death.

Add 5-6 week process gain immunity vaccine doses.

Everything lags behind least 4-6 weeks. kept simple, limit size social gatherings, enforce mask wearing except eating strenuous exercise. People tend interpret belong group less requirements. also 100% capacity many events. definitely state behind vax Georgia. things correlated..

I agree absolute riskiest thing do, risk, unnecessary one. rush we're close finish line?  long everyone vaccinated [the CDC says vaccinated people visit fully vaccinated people indoors without wearing masks physical distancing post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  better nothing. nothing. There's way make eating indoors safe unvaccinated people. modern equivalent kids hiding desks nuclear war. optics politics. Politicians/interests decided economic fallout closing restaurant industry much. 500,000 dead now. pandemic eventually end, fashion, vaccines, water bridge now, ""better nothing"" simply true. need mask you‚Äôre vaccinated. There‚Äôs absolutely zero precedent that. thought CDC supposed reflect science. could also quite overlap who've covid (asymptomatic, mild etc) vaccinated. databases assume overlap.  Florida like ‚ÄúYou guys wearing masks?‚Äù won‚Äôt speculate correct calculation would be, couple issues noticed:

1. Using 19M instead 11M denominator. Breakthrough casesby definition mean fully vaccinated, 19M absolutely accurate since includes partially vaxxed people. 11M may accurate ‚Äúfully vaxxed‚Äù number either suspect breakthrough cases go ‚Äúfully vaxxed X weeks final dose‚Äù definition. 

2. Even used accurate number fully vaxxed ppl denominator, number would large purposes calculation, doesn‚Äôt compensate fact many people aren‚Äôt exposed Covid. \^ This. applies social distancing, means events possible would still cancelled, regardless vaccines. also want add Masks may helpful vaccinated plenty people still not. agree sentiment around summer everyone wants vaccine get one, start rolling back restrictions, masks still help right now. 

I believe public health practices like currently recommended still recommended encouraged alittle longer going back pretending covid never existed means spread chances new strains.  worry much supply, logistics! every 12-18 months, first shots pretty much spread 6-9 months adults (that's looks like Belgium least), means covid vaccination year round. lot vaccine spots set places currently unused pandemic (sports arenas, event halls, office buildings, etc). organized we're ""back normal""? I‚Äôm computing vaccinated people less likely go hospital...but fees treatment still gone. vaccines tests free now..which stills sucks end hospitalized could ER 2 weeks rack thousands dollars medical treatment. need government tell wipe ass too? important part reduced chance transmission. getting sick protects one person. passing protects everyone. Pfizer Moderna 90% real world. J&amp;J 70%. mention know well certain variants evade (basically anything E484K mutation) natural immunity response, know current vaccines good enough deal theoretically avoid natural immunity (a robust enough response prevent severe COVID likely). ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs private business.‚Äù

That‚Äôs he/she complaining it, busting front door and/or trying make government tell business let in. fully vaccinated odds winding hospital approximately 1/20 someone vaccinated. 100% ask you‚Äôve vaccinated, you‚Äôve virus dates these. also ask whole load questions alongside you‚Äôve spent time previous weeks/month, indoors people etc. 

Source myself, I‚Äôve taking part study since started. 

They probably haven‚Äôt included info data set various reasons. Might bit messy misleading. I'm convinced chance getting covid unvaccinated person really small. Still can‚Äôt figure people put food mask. Crazy man. surprising? basically nothings changed lol math meaningless without looking rate infection unvaccinated time period. Cries Texas Rangers Hells ya, good news! I'm still salty half million people died, know, least go baseball game! Except dead people, course. Even poorest society smartphone. Tracfones smartphones now, touch screen everything. They've way since 2017 think.

But completely right elderly. they're 80, chances either A. probably one, B. one, know work enough would able download app bring pass said app. braves padres fan, agree completely. desperately want go braves game, eyeing may 9 game option. seeing close together unmasked crowd week watching vaccination numbers hovering near bottom, decided it. I'm DEFINITELY going. really wish close enough cali could go game petco. Cali teams seem really shit together I'm totally jealous. They're fun team watch. definitely competitive division baseball year teams contenders. guess natural selection start taking effect end year. Can‚Äôt help answer question since haven‚Äôt gotten mine yet, injection, key completely relax arm, least upper arm muscles. Hurts WAY less, might even feel all.

If you‚Äôre scared needles, probably inadvertently tense up, especially watch inject you. used like look away focus relaxing arm swear never feel anything whenever get shot. take bite put mask back chew. realz. That‚Äôs airlines.. near impossible study level specificity exogenous factors contributing? Drama mama much? teams bad odds specific unvaccinated person getting covid given time period also rather small. Without looking infection rate per million unvaccinated people, measurement infected vaccinated people per million people meaningless number. they're never low enough significant portion population willingly decided get vaccinated?  Eh probably won‚Äôt make huge difference. haven‚Äôt seen sporting events turned Petri dishes year cool cubs could win game tonight.  Dialysis immunosuppressed patients Pfizer shots within 21- 28 days barely mounted immune response. dropping like flies. exploring need third booster altogether different vaccine population. Pfizer may largely produced used vaccine certain patient populations, useless Shhhh, PA/Philly take personal challenge Yes, yet. Georgia enough people vaccinated support plan, mask compliance good enough think might safe. love that. Thanks sharing! pharma company know vaccines

Yeah really shows :/ Also, unvaccinated people ""Attending small, indoor gathering fully vaccinated people different households."" 
For example, fully vaccinated parents take unvaccinated child fully vaccinated Grandma Grandpa's house without requiring unvaccinated child wear mask indoors? Thanks reasonable it! Cuz understand better good? Georgia near ready kind step. Yes, thank you. I'm Georgian huge baseball fan. I'd looking going game soon, I'm vaccinated. upped 50%, saw many people packed close together, mask less course, comfort. thinking going may 9 game, going. ready. state sufficient vaccination numbers support this. wrong decision.  association totally fair. Numerous republican cultural leaders pushing anti-academic narratives multiple fronts years. sentiments coalesced polling data vaccine hesitancy see time writing. mere coincidence.

If republicans believe science don‚Äôt wish associated anti-academic movements, onus reform. everyone else put blinders on. That's 100% true, invest enough research think right vaccine first us citizen, i'm EU enough vaccine everyone few, I'm thinking poor countries... man dying vaccine hospitals... issue break comparing worst flu deaths recent history precaution taken literally every precaution taken last year covid calling similar risk. 

I'd curious see many age group died last 16 months flu compared COVID.

Otherwise position seems much reasonable one originally commented on. Gotcha, thanks!! 'Any' includes '1'. I'm provocative here, threshold minimum usefulness. dodged question many talking here, take can't want answer it.

yes, that's true. know news seems EU also clear that, that's another aspect legal battle clarity Astra. 

The point UK factories producing also EU aren't. course is.  Right, even 19M isn‚Äôt correct denominator start with, ‚Äúbreakthrough case‚Äù defined fully vaccinated. suspect means 2 weeks final dose least it‚Äôs 2nd dose administered (if applicable). 


Either way, great news. sources cases talking about? Georgia must something right. depends live. I've seen person store without mask year. simply going allowed without one. So... take 3 immune? 

I‚Äôm super Genius. I‚Äôll expecting noble prize soon. 15 billion dollar prize. Would prefer second one much more. Thanks young consider lower-risk, worry trying get highest efficacy possible. J&amp;J plenty effective, reach full efficacy sooner it, would go that.

As people get vaccinated, cases continue go down, also less likely come contact someone too. It'll interesting see uptake be. Currently least state 16-17 yo 30% vaccinated. substantially lower age groups, yet somehow seems pretty decent considering underage kids. People wash hands regardless whether vaccine. Go men's bathroom see many people wash hands. I'll surprised half Nope. stories Thanks sharing! followed - talk common sense based data. interesting (and well done) presentation embedded article interested.

In short, numbers NM follows:

Number least 1 dose: 961,634

Fully vaccinated: 690,909

Number left vaccinate everyone 1 dose gets 2nd: 46,729

Should easy! Get done New Mexico!  That's sued Wow that‚Äôs terrible headline options, think would encourage people get vaccinated think we're running with?

1. ""Get vaccinated take mask see friends family.""
2. ""Get vaccinated live life again.""
3. ""Get vaccinated, mask up, keep distance"". Id get mRNA personally. matter. hurt. get shot ASAP. Curfews counterproductive. one place, getting everyone rushing time enforced. much faith  Sometimes solutions global problems political. surprise nobody. Officials need start counting entire population adults ‚Äúeligible.‚Äù People think YAY! Herd immunity! kids, can‚Äôt get vaccinated, 25% population. Difficult get herd immunity 1/4 population zero percent vaccinated. Could allergies? That's guidance fully vaccinated people. Well tested positive covid today anyway, even got tremendously unlucky. 

I really wish joking.  EU contract state ""after AZ taken care important investors"" lol. Yeah, believe idiots don‚Äôt realize they‚Äôre 99.993% protected Wisconsin role model. basically you‚Äôre vaccinated, still wear mask almost circumstances unvaccinated people do? What‚Äôs point this? Lol would been, [Bill Gates prevented Oxford making open that, developing nations would already creating vaccines own. Distressing. Arizona, governor restricted municipalities enforcing restricts. AZ ""florida approach"" describing. Now, go look daily case counts Arizona. They've stayed low despite fully reopen quite while! think happens many people COVID already we're much closer herd immunity official numbers suggest, everyone could get away it. could afford loosen restrictions nationwide? Yes. are. maddening there‚Äôs lot women Reddit talking it‚Äôs effected period. absolutely effected mine. You‚Äôd think they‚Äôd wearing masks building pyres COVID victims‚Ä¶ sucks lol thankfully numbers still side rather low-intensity infection. realise little made UK? would mean shipping shipped in? doesnt make lot sense apart scoring political points. EU behaving like we're major manufacturer we're not. want complete fulfillment order, course deserved, would happen also sued same? would deadlock. think fair EU block EU made doses due shortfall, right demand complete order also shortfall too. Yep think too. It‚Äôs essentially keeping good order population gets vaccinated COVID starts die down. I‚Äôm Michigan, worst pandemic US right (though rapidly getting better, likely due vaccination).

I‚Äôm fully vaccinated due MI‚Äôs status I‚Äôm somewhat careful, even I‚Äôm concerned. possible I‚Äôll get COVID? Sure, it‚Äôs damn unlikely, I‚Äôll almost certainly fine get now, almost certainly won‚Äôt inadvertently spread it.

All all, feel like mostly engage normal life again. Sounds like Los Alamos vaccine levels. I‚Äôm jealous Bernallilo. Seemed like would never hit green I‚Äôm happy new opening strategy. Oh okay puts things perspective thanks. I'm situation bit drastic. Viral vector used Adenovirus causes common cold. virus still alive Russian manufacturing process failed inactivate virus beforehand there‚Äôs problem filtering processes. expected response. Citation? COVID definitely infects animals, multiple countries ended COVID endemic disease (the hard way via lockdowns). Based this, seems like animal reservoirs material source transmission humans. 

A developed country achieved herd immunity would probably issues animal reservoirs. worst, would plague-level background noise (like 5-10 cases year). Well, it‚Äôs good changed recommendation advocate masks, I‚Äôm change, I‚Äôm happened changed. don‚Äôt think health professionals should‚Äôve manipulating public, don‚Äôt trust reason. thought genuinely believed masks didn‚Äôt help time, I‚Äôd feel differently, think solely manipulation. Incredible! Thank think maybe assuming Im mad allowed full capacity. I'm salty chose 2020 good win. agreed capacity rules.

This definitely was. Thanks clarifying. actually looked CDC guidelines? 

Because literally guidance vaccinated people wear masks situations unvaccinated people crowds. Gatherings vaccinated people allowed couple months now. UK‚Äôs restrictions much closer Canada‚Äôs NC‚Äôs, gathering cap 15 Perfect excuse invent some! developed countries? makes impossible? 

Impossible strong word. Difficult ignorance? Perhaps. Tie $10,000 stimulus check receiving vaccine see quickly reach true herd immunity US. Obviously happen, agree would get us there, we're negotiating incentives getting vaccine (or distinctives getting it). reddit/CDC insane use common sense.  Religion generally afforded protection regulation stuff First Amendment related legislation.

If want get *why* behind that, America fairly religious country. That's changing quickly people either turn agnosticism/atheism profess relationship higher power necessarily fit Christian/Islamic/Hindu/Buddhist/Taoist/Zoroastrian/etc box, laws provide protections made ago. I'd get vaccine meant could stop wearing damn mask. There's always gonna risk getting sick public, get it. Probably stupid question: 

If takes ~2 weeks second vaccine fully effective, still taking precautions usual 2 additional weeks (after first 2 weeks), since take long COVID symptoms appear (I think), possible contracted virus first 2 weeks? think like three seconds, see interesting given there's infinite amount time develop myocarditis 2nd shot, finite amount time first. news outlets still insist trying frame everything negative beyond me.

They know uninformed people take ‚Äúvaccines don‚Äôt work‚Äù Certain parts sub gone far rails you‚Äôre going downvoted pointing absolute basic teachings epidemiology. It‚Äôs sad talking enforcement. I‚Äôm wondering standard. Today almost everyone saw mask. Children 16 cannot get vaccine. people immune disorders cannot get vaccine. Even masks 100% safe. help keep safe wearing mask. them. understand agree extent.

It's still soon open activities like 100%.

If think 100% people attending going vaccinated abiding mask policy (let alone policy enforced meaningful way), that's naive. course we'll wait see happens. I'd happy proven wrong want pandemic like rest y'all. could issued recommendation cloth masks regular people suggest surgical masks/N95's reserved medical professionals...

instead, tried shame people mislead saying masks counterproductive, makes feel invincinble, effective all. go Alaska June get shot couse I've enough money unfair... Thanks EU allowing exports, unlike others. Dude....thats fucking complicated (obvious). Wearing mask circumstances *literally thing* CDC asking fully vaccinated people. 

You‚Äôve lived last year, prospect wearing mask concert much handle? that‚Äôs much ask someone, frankly probably never intending get vaccine first place. Vaccine nationalism price know.  find difficult believe don‚Äôt know think short-sighted. Imagine public health agencies didn‚Äôt change recommendations new information. next bloodletting treatment? never walked mask outdoors never walked anywhere without one on. stupid extremes anti maskers ones mask, little much. 22 here, pass two week mark Friday! make UK enemy. 

Given UK's behaviour since Christmas, exactly difficult so, it. Curfews packing number people fewer hours increasing risk bars restaurants whole time. never started. Either open bar fully open all.  Yes different rules make sense still 100 people together indoors 200 outdoors seems like much difference. area peaking right 30 cases day around 850k people. people NC can‚Äôt come directly many people cross border work constantly spreading states affect Canada well.  Get man! Go! well. yeah. that's progress works. vaccines.

half million dead can't move forward anything? logic? keeping things closed ain't bringing anyone back dead.

I think maybe assuming Im mad allowed full capacity. I'm salty chose 2020 good win. agreed capacity rules. guess depends are. North Carolina inside 100% outside like 75%. people wear time, bring put another person approaching someone outside household. Friend teacher one students' parents got COVID couple months ago. month half since hospital, expected pass away next couple days severe lung damage caused COVID-19. get point, would liked defined ""crowded,"" though. descriptive term easily stretched meet various interpretations. live steep hill must climb get city‚Äôs waterfront home. Wearing mask way hill awful.  CDC‚Äôs guidance fully vaccinated people everything normally would, situations wear masks. people tender little ears wearing mask sometimes going ruin normal life?   vaccinated what's point wearing mask. Good you, mate! Getting first vaccine tomorrow, happy.

I actually care still wear masks events longer get herd immunity protect teenagers/kids.

I'll still less stressed constantly sanitizing hands, less scared someone mask nose walking right next me, we'll able go other's houses we're vaccinated, it'll great.  That's pretty misleading. people fully vaccinated short amount time, environment low community spread.  Murphy announced Twitter. don‚Äôt give breakdown anywhere assume privy info.   ""crowded"" left undefined. Also, feel like unvaccinated people likely take advantage regardless. vaccine reached maximum effectiveness. believe takes two weeks J&amp;J vaccine reach full efficacy, Modern/Pfizer reach full efficacy two weeks second shot. Don‚Äôt know EU medals give‚Ä¶ see point, also think ""uncrowded"" left completely undefined, loose term interpretation. Further, feel people vaccinated going take advantage this, given nobody going stopping people asking proof vaccination. Ultimately, make much difference eyes, live residential area major, Democratic-voting American city, seeing 10% people wearing masks outside even this. think emboldens people wearing masks outside, despite fact relatively highly populated residential area constantly passing next people. Seriously. 

How many Californians fully vaccinated Jan 1st? means first dose last November... UK moral right Dutch made drug substance earlier year AZ busy producing EU? still potentially contract, carry spread Covid even vaccinated. immune system primed ready it. 

Since beginning personal mask *never* protecting you, wear mask others.

If vaccinated contract Covid likely fine probably even symptoms, still spread people fine. keep wearing masks transmission levels low  people lie asses they‚Äôll say they‚Äôve vaccinated  Canada‚Äôs guidance even cautious US. least US they‚Äôre talking *can* do, addition can‚Äôt do. federal provincial governments (except BC) basically screaming ‚Äúdon‚Äôt that! Don‚Äôt that!‚Äù like squirrel Marge Simpson. Fuck shit. Vaccinated people wear masks anymore. Would also support insurers penalizing overweight people, significantly increased odds severe COVID? Maybe giving Medicare option refuse coverage overweight-related care, long weight patient's control?

I favor this. feel safe, stay home. Let everyone else assess risk precautions. Exact opposite NYC. wear mask walking around outside sometimes get hounded mask on. sad reality two sides spectrum. get bullied take ur mask get bullied put one on. I'm thinking summer. CDC keeps slowly lifting restrictions, Biden said early 4th July independence virus. think things effectively back normal then. Pretty sure one point Fauci said expects NFL full stadiums opening game. live 850k people adding 30 cases day, it‚Äôs bad outside looks like shambles. EU wants countries get want it. Looks like poor communication bureaucratic processes causing mess. Germany gone entire Europe would vaccinated now.  Exactly exactly full efficacy mean short time period, is. 

And California many cases right even among unvaccinated people. 1,800/day almost 40 million people.  No, contagious disease means actions risks take affect people around choose take risks. That's contagious disease like covid public health issue government's involvement closing things warranted. That's always worked, always understood disease today. many years, definitely past year +, worked way. People sub incapable telling apart medical advice political decisions. Horseshoe theory. think ends completely opposite actually closest other. disagree. think people sacrificed year, gotten vaccinated, rightfully looking positive changes. I‚Äôm saying anyone shouldn‚Äôt get vaccinated. don‚Äôt firm evidence natural immunity short lived. ~80% efficacy better ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù people have. 95% efficacy obviously better though people COVID encouraged get vaccinated. Well...no. would look chart, see two sides same. Family friend heart transplant vaccine doctors said looked like never got vaccine. 

This important get vaccinated. protect people able able fight off. scientist saying Sputnik V, reliable?

Because means either lying developed whole new way fighting virus. really hope I'm 14 really want lol.  national numbers, breakthrough 1% fatality rate, different unvaccinated cases. 

However, tell entire story 1) people vaccinated would risk overall population, 2) could something people cause breakthrough cases high rate death. Mid 30s here, side effects besides sore arm dose 1 &amp; 2 Moderna.  picture reverse, year ago, saying ""young low BMI leave mask anything want, elderly overweight need mask distancing"". hard support statement like that, masked quarantined year. 

It's time let us go out, vaccinated not, taking whatever precautions comfortable with. Boston pushing reopening 8/22 ü§¶üèº  Well never experienced either, anybody know maybe wrong? bad make be? Seven day average 583260, probably go weekend.

Some official data available here: per day bad, 1m average would lot better get fast. hope promises increased deliveries hold true. hilarious projection considering [U.S. Department HHS Annual Report proudly states page 48 OGA coordinated U.S. government agencies strengthen diplomatic ties offer technical humanitarian assistance dissuade countries region accepting aid ill-intentioned states. Examples include using OGA‚Äôs Health Attach√© office persuade Brazil reject Russian COVID-19 vaccine, offering CDC technical assistance lieu Panama accepting offer Cuban doctors. 

We know COVID going Brazil. Western countries shamelessly spread misinformation non-Western vaccines highly up-voted comments thread blabbing ""live adenovirus found Sputnik"" [Anvisa actually tested presence live needs justify promises made U.S. HHS U.S. HHS brags public report.  Well finally. COVID response lacking long time Global warming deniers watch list next? Certain thoughts dangerous society. Islamic Christian books contain passages advocating violence. followers need watchlist? overreach using argument would land huge number people lists Please, get vaccinated...everyone.  would guess so. expect piggyback CDC guidance. Lol.  I‚Äôm talking never wearing it. I‚Äôm talking common sense science. haven‚Äôt asked wear masks month 6 flu shot next shot 6 months that? Flu shots 100% effective start wear 6 months. messaging shitty. want encourage people get vaccinated, tell won‚Äôt wear mask outside able things maskless. 

Define herd immunity. Also tell vaccines 100% effective virus call mask wearing. adults go school... can't legally require adults take it, especially since ""emergency use authorization"".

Certain jobs require see lot companies going route paying employees rather requiring it, legality fuzzy they'd probably get challenged legally tried it.

Some businesses even threatening fire employees get vaccinated. sure legality either.  Think they‚Äôre still working details, fact outdoor longer requires positive sign.  Yeah think numbers doctors exactly right day, average vaccination per day increasing aswell!  Maybe, there's also system collectively reach everyone.

A person 80+ regular doctor, I'd bet there's fair amount go often.

A lot get doctor stock walk right without appointment get whim. also group problems signing appointments high demand.

Oh, places prioritized first responders elderly. offered less time think there.

Sadly, expect group reach nearly 100% America. That's place works.  mean masks? doesn‚Äôt specifically say.  plenty places open minimal restrictions. would guess point R far fully open people still wearing masks cautious probably vaccinated anti-vaxxers probably never really reducing social contacts anyways.   Last year...maybe, seen Brasil, Mexico, USA known gonna get hit prepare it.  mean he's right, I'm german aswell real issues go Notaufnahme get treatment within multiple hours

Also, quite alot violence surrounding several anti corona demonstrations. probably see US ahead terms taking role

In world? American image famously tarnished they're hoarding vaccines. Meanwhile, EU donated doses they've administered themselves.  we're milking ""no, can't thing pandemic"" excuse avoid making plans long possibly can. know logically I'm way safer now, doses, last year. ""two weeks past second dose"" something people understand. I'll human point. then, continue hermit mode people willing say ""he's super careful"". Kuch bhi bhenchod  Uhm - yesterday, news found death lists politicians voted Corona measures. lists circulated chat groups Corona deniers.

So, yes, much ""people disagree"" with, people plotting political violence. Vaccine distribution uneven though day day - doctors get vaccines beginning week, hand 2-3 days run dry again.

What I'm saying is: extrapolate yesterday's numbers. Mainly see mortality rate virus think OK, especially 18-28 demographic said might true, country's prime minister rallying declaring never seen bheed rally 16th April. day 2lakh+ cases, realizes government totally blamed Calling demos peaceful pretty far reality. gathering infos real number seems like hard thing times US, brothers roommate heart attack, went ER, since heart rate ""normal"" (90) sent home, even though told usually resting heart rate 60s (he runs marathons).

After several hours home, get lower went back.
He wait several hours got scan... 3 arteries partially needed stents! could've died.

(at time attack, extremely good physical condition, ran marathons, obese).

Privatized health care mean get seen immediately... surveillance stupid opinion, circulate death lists politicians voted corona measures ...  agree. I'm confident issue neither IOC Japan want cancel it. Japan cancels deal fallout breach contract IOC cancels liable same.

It's obvious, imo, IOC cancel event since seems unfair burden Japan something outside control. Breakthrough occur vaccinated exposed virus, 11mil exposed virus.

This caclulate breakthrough chance/rate. calculates many fully vaccinated people got reinfeced, kinda pointless number says nothing ""real"" chance catch covid again. includes people never chance get reinfected used scale number.

For would need assess/estimate many fully vaccinated people contact many got reinfected. Fever definitely typical second dose symptom actual temp vary widely person person (as well took temperature, woke up, bundled are, etc, etc, etc,). 

If Tylenol bringing get worse think fine -- also even close medical professional, take big grain salt! talk good vaccines I'm bummed still can't get one yet. :( this, epic.   reason Moderna generally isn‚Äôt even brought option outside USA? Less supply? Wonderful news! Thanks sharing! Cant compare efficacy though. important number prevent severe covid symptoms know 100 percent   tables turned.

Is indication AstraZeneca work mutant strains? here, take downvote enough CDC issue guidelines based bottom page, recent data show vaccines may help keep people spreading COVID-19, learning people get vaccinated.

I agree you, they're gonna make part official guidance there's evidence. I'm currently China hopes quarantine drop one week, catch would need synovac shot. probably get syno shot get better one visit family States.  Colleague told friend's 21 year old son died yesterday, hypertension antivaccine. son, 25, illness belief, still intubated.
Seems stories become even common. good sign gravity changing issue. week ago saw media outlets dipping toes articles like maybe outdoor masking isn‚Äôt necessary. fact we‚Äôre seeing article written going even good sign it‚Äôs going influence mainstream discourse loosening restrictions sign people starting change minds vaccines start turn tide covid. Something I‚Äôve saying months people stress restrictions never end. I‚Äôve said know vaccines work, increase, cases drop give politicains leeway open stuff change outlook people worried covid, variants, etc. 2 lakh = 200,000 roll damn dice Jeff true India counting diagnosed cases patients die hospital? Atlanta walk right Falcons stadium appointment vaccine 30 minutes. It‚Äôs like like 3 weeks. Anybody prioritized vaccine probably already shots now. multiple friends do.

Okay, and? unvaccinated idiot Atlanta could start transmission line goes ***outside*** Atlanta place people legitimately unable get vaccinated. reason children receiving vaccines right now. incredibly unlikely harmed virus doesn‚Äôt make logical sense. 

No. lie. Children received vaccine yet approved use children. elderly person vaccine could gotten one months ago.

I say elderly unvaccinated person. said unvaccinated person ***OR*** child ***OR*** elderly person. scenarios mention extremely, extremely improbable. 

No, not. much going take extra precautions unlikely scenarios, might well walking around rubber suits don‚Äôt get struck lightning.

No. preposterous moronic comparison. something happens one million people every year. Got second Moderna noon today, FEEL FUCKING NUTTIN!

This fair point. Though honest, we're fucked virus mutates vaccine-resistant strain anyway, even everyone US vaccinated. There's billions people world access vaccine long time. 

Perhaps would smart keep intercontinental travel restricted countries pandemic control? couple years would guess know true death toll (or least close number) surprised turns 10M+ worldwide mean, wont die, sure, there's incentive  Automod killed comment said bad words. reiterate, Feghorn Leghorn governor never ceases amaze level ridiculousity.

B. ""Israel model"" tells us 50% restrictions cause solid drop. tell us much 50% restrictions. 50% magic number. 

The question whether Rt 1. 

That informed many variables. vaccination rate, existing population immunity (from infection), seasonal factors, existing restrictions. 

We herald Israel magic utopia COVID died hit 50% total population, people forget Israel robust restrictions. people say ""Israel totally back normal"" completely neglect mention back normal *only green pass*. 

Life back normal green passes Israel maintaining onerous restrictions unvaccinated individuals. Indoor dining? Nope, need green pass. Movie? Green pass. Indoor worship 20 people? Oops, need green pass.

Yes do! I'm South Africa whole mess. Botswana 6 hour drive border, wonder they'd let pay one. I'm desperate. Still remember doctor ER asking, ""How many bowel movements today?"" (Around 2 pm) 

23 answer. shock face said all. Fun stuff.  So? It‚Äôs better ain‚Äôt it? Exactly. lot people listen CDC gospel, especially times like this, good reason. CDC said mask wearing could relaxed vaccinated emphasized effective vaccines actually promise amount vaccination numbers would skyrocket Yes that‚Äôs calculate efficacy nitwit.

If there‚Äôs disease kills 1 10k, treatment stops it, efficacy change calculations 0.0001. Lol need compare two groups stupid set guidelines. depending government bureaucrat tell visit friends family without mask eat outside restaurant without mask beyond help! level baseline risk going allow things go back normal? like modern science works, knew? source close family posted Alberta Reddit story found blood clot lungs, supposedly still association COVID. hell ever actually wearing mask jogging walking outside themselves??? 

I did. running sidewalk someone coming towards you, much use put mask see - they'll still end walking cloud old *droplets*. mostly courtesy thing since live neighborhood decent number elderly people. point particular vaccines work really well That‚Äôs efficacy works all. Lol need compare unvaccinated poeple. 80% study outlier. Thank you. context referring people's interest changed.

We'll official news whether AZ works new variant not. Since 90% shots administered India AZ since they're dying new variant guess effective new variant. came looking type first hand knowledge. Thank you! Er 90% effective 20 year old daughter symptoms 2 weeks ago tested negative. She‚Äôs fully vaccinated month.  thought sure COVID last March symptoms familiar. Dr prescribed ZPak antihistamine cleared up. Paywall. Okay take face value then:

- 1-2% fatality rate - assuming infected
- 95% effective vaccine
- alone means average chance vaccinated person dying disease 0.0005% (2% * 1-95%)
- assumes 100% chance effective exposure virus (we know it‚Äôs less bc everyone U.S infected)
- chance exposure goes dramatically people get vaccinated. Even 1/20 vaccinated get infected way less likely spread others bc vaccinated.

So right have: 0.0005% chance death vaccinated person exposed COVID (which less normal flu). also much lower infection rate. get mine 9th too!

Yeah sure nothing free. paid taxes. expensive long run. 
German health care costs half US health care costs. result new president new leadership? I'm America hate that's stupid question. I'm genuinely curious know Biden trying fix corona virus situation there. Japan incapable anything quickly....you thinking Japan long since stagnated away. fine, make sure direct anger people getting vaccinated, public health officials attempting save lives. choice saying fucking bad idiots caught crossfire. professional obligation say that. perogatice ignore them.  extremely cynical part starting think slow rollout deliberate part Japan's brinkmanship IOC. Japan needs IOC cancel, Japan cancel going cost lot money would've nice Trump taken vaccination public instead sneaking one aware. one good thing pandemic investing vaccine development, instead praising effectiveness showing people worked without ill effects, followers left wild conspiracy theories again. Japan's government seriously less competent third-world countries. They've spent energy insisting Olympics happen basically none planning distribution. modern Japanese approach problem freeze place hope goes away, beginning take actions taken year ago. actions taken cautiously carefully humanly possible. get vaccinated late 2022, count it.

1400000000 - approx population India  shall take upvote dignity grace Last heard AZ even approved US there's millions doses sitting factories? Seychelles? They're already far, according Bloomberg they're 3 weeks grom reaching herd immunity (75%). basic pension system intended stand own, ""2nd highest tax burden worldwide"" BS attempt basic math, able drink public basic freedom I'd prefer German smoking rates US child mortality rates given day. Plus, obviously never tried accident random illness countries. Little hint, one might shatter financial existence entirely, leaving broke homeless it, make completely inhuman choice buying next medical treatment (like, common Asthma inhaler) feeding children. Brazilian here. Yes, still found SARS-COV-2 spikes replicated AD5. immunocompromised people, waaay serious shit thought kids vastly unaffected covid? Hopefully every 'Querdenker' thinks living democratic country anymore... :) That‚Äôs efficacy ~95%. won‚Äôt develop strong enough immune response avoid reinfection, case vaccines. people get infected (according study), well people get vaccinated, they‚Äôre pretty well protected virus. It‚Äôs literally observation. Overall, better county USA, get it. 3 days, can't use consequentively, covid use them.

What point?

The federal benefit already covered this.

We needed something would allow people stay home prevent spread everything really, covid.  someone choosing still wear one affect anyway, long they‚Äôre shaming it? Wrong Timeline. demanding health information like vaccination status think treading   legal grounds

It literally though, thing businesses regular certain industries already. Ok, like another reason? Like, maybe really raise vaccine production much? post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:
  
[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's someone saying lived Germany long enough.
You even provide counter arguments Meanwhile Russia sending active virus covid vaccine Brazil. Hahahaha that's american would say xdddd. Data 5-12 year olds expected July according may take 4-6 weeks review.  every adult takes vaccine

Small detail stupid right I'd feel completely comfortable 100x things able feel confident people around vaccinated would correctly wearing effective masks. anti-vaxx/anti-mask people prolonging pandemic preventing rest us able go back normal. One thing that‚Äôs interesting see CDC say don‚Äôt wear mask outside, comments along lines ‚ÄúI‚Äôll still wear mine, old habits hard break.‚Äù

Kind amusing ‚Äúit‚Äôs mask, hard wear one?‚Äù wonder rate Astrazenica  broken pension system, 2nd highest tax burden worldwide, public drinking, awful smoking rates.

Nothing mention free, long run even expensive US, example. image, wow.    told flattening curve hospitals get overwhelmed due many simultaneous COVID-19 complications. Nobody attacking them. watching. glad see amount celebration comment section muted. much. wonder result Russian government spreading misinformation western-developed vaccines, combined Brazil publicly rejecting Russian vaccine.

We're close end thing people get collective heads asses, governments included. way important try end thing globally try create sort brief geopolitical advantage. Doesn‚Äôt add up. Maybe afraid vaccines? Meanwhile France ... don‚Äôt understand able it. Italy around 350k doses per day, yesterday 90% doses used - many regions complain enough doses days. Great news Germany Europe anyway! important issue really listening chef? think they‚Äôre playing safe. may move date things develop. German Covid denier better tape cameras purpose ""Death List""! Death threats definitely illegal. Yeah BS, people keep trying read something side effects, like means strong/weak immune system, were/weren't already exposed, etc. seem correlation. I'm rural Western rarely see people following it. death metric people talk covid? concern death, long term implications aware of. civil. civil. Lying implies intention. like China beginning could simple knowing report confirmed numbers. like saying 5 cockroaches house, saw 5 probably 100 can't see. Literally videos language speak showing events..... parents still paranoid side effects keep procrastinating (SO frustrating). day, centers nearby us less two dose vaccines J &amp; J, refuse take (typical boomers get freaked news). Sigh. annoyed worried feeling keep delaying taking it. Even mom like, what's point get booster? exhausting feel like everyone gone back normal except us. Yes think so. Israel started report herd immunity vaccinated 56%, counted 15% people recovered. closely tracked cases recovered people 15% pretty solid. closely tracked US.

But can't huge waves cases like happened California without large numbers people becoming immune. Dr. Gottlieb estimated 30% population exposed back January. Surely higher now, let's say half people immunity. 40-50% vaccination, 15-20% immunity... think cases falling almost everywhere country. Ah yes, YouTube. Source quality journalism unbiased reports.  That's probably thing people used say Galileo back day. they're violent, can't treat differently universally considered stupid opinion. Well, free, democratic country anyway. controlled Russian intelligence, absolutely makes sense. What's point? issue substance comment make vague accusations support think ""team""?

A xenophobic, nationalist approach public health ain't that's U.S. HHS report describes. one them. I'm really glad got last shot, know sure die it. It‚Äôs kind backwards successful state comes vaccine numbers hesitant get back normal. 

Massachusetts going hit herd immunity well August. That's allowed, surely - public data, it? RKI also released updated paper listed businesses less likely impact infection rates. 

Preety detailed stuff government certainly give shit it. quite literally handpicking advice suits best. ""We listen that, that, oh no"".

The paper lists public parks outside ventures generally places absolutely impact infection rates. Yet still curfew now, means people go outside instead meet illegally inside.

Cinemas also low risk according government quite literally ignores data already. entire branch industry closed shocking half year shit ton jobs lost risk lost government preety much give shit. indoors bad. 

So yea. That's skeptical governments reopening plan. think 7 day incidence awul way determine measures needed. data insanely easy mainpulate. everything rises falls here. Big Apple back! Actually think so. far cases among 20-49 80%+ age 65+ vaccinated. think older people remained sequestered younger people getting it. Definitely overlap think much. Let's spy people ideas dislike find wrongdoing establish reasonable suspicion. Hmmm. write drooling keyboard cellphone Yes, know government follows law, reinterpret however wants justify wants do, can't change law whim legislature, courts always uphold law never poke holes it.

Oh, wait...  Think lot going pharmacy... could schedule one primary doctor they'd less hesitant.  arrived, course could taken different approach lived relatively normally like much East Asia.

Why restrictions place vaccines arrived?

&amp;#x200B;

No one one year ago saying need keep restrictions vaccine arrives. Sadly sometimes get bit reassurance knowing crazy isn‚Äôt uniquely American trait. ‚ÄúYou brought something‚Äù period. didn‚Äôt say addressed specifically please begging read!! nice day intrusive thoughts, wonderful person :) Looks like number shots might higher shipment numbers. They're painstakingly sucking last drops vial means they're extracting 7 shots often 6. shipments continue J&amp;J AZ delivering almost nothing, 4 million shots per week going limit June.

I bet things really bad, they'd use 10+ shots vial concentration said high, smaller amount would likely good. assume modifying existing covid vaccines much quicker process making new one scratch variant boosters amd ones kids easier make, new shots go smae process trials testing expedited process modified vaccines allows us export faster?  concerted vaccine drive, like ""get vote"". needed PR campaign, including information campaign risks benefits, videos smiling celebrities getting vaccine giving thumbs up, outreach specific groups people including likely reluctant, public events live bands favorite public people, social media campaigns ""vaccine influencers"", etc. Rainbows unicorns.

Instead got muddled stiff upper lip message of, get vaccine, remain locked travel, gather, keep wearing mask, etc. guess basis science probably least effective way get people get fuels people skeptical reluctant. also shame got politicized half country deeply reluctant begin with. feel like to. Deaths already pretty much toilet tbf, there‚Äôs one 20+ deaths day last two weeks, 7 day average 11 deaths. Second third highest rate vaccinations country Tomorrow easily beat last week's number, average continue rise 600k accept acknowledging made valid points support argument government abuse citizens. Attack there's real threat assume know people opposing views intend got last line. People right organize attack. one trespassed caused damage. protest, pretty tame one.  And? need private healthcare anything I've described lol, bonus necessary

You still argue point I've made discussion right like look Canada üòÇ mean, adjusted population using calculation daily vaccines us germany vaccinated people yesterday us peak. Nice job Botswana.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, cant say word ""Botswana"" head without using Yakko Warner's voice. point enough vaccinations available, 1M+ day perfectly doable. stress test like denmark 2 weeks ago, normal operation day. Lauterbach said reach Israel‚Äôs levels 6 weeks, one week ago, optimistic see even growth Yeah, accusing people upset leftists. Clearly what's wrong world's handled genius. relax.   Yeah dawg totally don‚Äôt two different systems based public private healthcare, you? Unfassbare Leistung, noch ein weiterer Grund, der ich dort hinziehen will. Liebe aus den USA! Thankfully restrictions going away near future. really help situation inflame things. stash vaccines somewhere maybe unfortunately isn't. yes, people made effort search documentation parliament, compile easy list send around. really need vent frustration Massachusetts right now. news NYC fully opening July 1st, makes much annoying Massachusetts August 1st. We‚Äôre one best states vaccinating already 54% population least one shot. Saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôve still got 3 months go‚Äù many places planning reopenings sooner sucks. There‚Äôs guy rates stuff MA, waited 2 weeks hit 90% population shots, would July 9, 2021, nearly month reopening. Essentially, August way far out. I‚Äôm arguing May 1st, reopening date seems LEAST month long area projections.

I got shot, I‚Äôve worn mask, battened hatches winter. It‚Äôs way demoralizing date far out, least tie metric. Yeah, biontech increased increased supply per week 5 million europe, surely going help. What's status NYC vaccine passports?
I expecting plan hinge this. Worked government, people absolutely idea truly incompetent expensive federal government is. money flying getting wasted reason real estate insanely expensive around Washington DC. 1. even german tf want know (they yesterday)
2. numerous counts property damage, obstructing law enforcement, disobeying Covid restrictions assault  Also, excellent mass-produced beer.  way, that's Canada stopped flights India. Agreed ‚Äîthe result actually might actually somewhat discouraging. I'm going discuss topic further, since obviously arguing bad faith moving goalpoasts suit agenda. U.S. think legal concept called 'probable cause', look that.

Just two points: 

If 'visible property damage' thing worried mob trying storm seat parliament influence elected representatives, either moron serious.

If begin protect constitution would abolish already organized far *be* real present threat, late. That's something learned hard way Germany. ‚ÄúDeath list‚Äù? 

Surely result Parliamentary votes public anyway? Seriously name mexican brand beer Medusa doesn‚Äôt Germany include vaccine proof exception strict entry requirements? Nice  DC area common too. never mandated far know recommended CDC. People it. Which, honestly, understand. air become toxic. get virus people, environment. like allergies. nowhere near someone chance getting mask necessary.  dont actually trust medical science relation female reproductive systmes. dont study enough, dont ask enough questions, dont trust women. includes women scientists doctors. So... will. got 2nd dose yesterday, guess I'll see fucks various issues. I‚Äôm surprised didn‚Äôt get modded oblivion given Reddit crowd. increase 150k week Biontech supplies went 1M per week starting week. one asked know people lived places longer period. told basically this: really well paying job like self employed healthy US place be. make comparatively money, disposable income life easy going. make lot money, healthy family Germany seems better. last one two families know came back, middle one wont permanently live US first one people certain fields went abroad year came back.
Besides mostly personal taste, culture nature fitted personally better. Amazing. Outdid USA despite us 4x population. 

Too many anti-vaxxers America. entire northeast is, probably be, heavily vaccinated region United States, yet probably last reopen. Depends live guess, never wait month anything Show pictures needles give ICU. 1. able shelter place, one is, implies shelter-in-place orders never work.
2. people without underlying conditions, COVID-19 dangerous swine flu. 

&amp;#x200B;

Lockdowns never necessary. agree actually - amazing variety microbrew beer US - thousands choices massive amount different styles. don‚Äôt get Germany - you‚Äôll get regional styles brewed accordance purity law - you‚Äôre gonna find crazy IPAs stouts coconut. someone who‚Äôs places mass produced beers Germany significantly better American mass produced beer. Augustiner Helles vs Miller Lite Bud? even close. I'll take downvotes I'd probably tell sack up. vaccine injection hurts less strong handshake, come on. Yes, makes likely. singling India making mutant strains likely might entirely fair, least little premature. U.S. continually 5 million active cases since Nov. 27, likely stay threshold months. India anywhere close, recent thing. (Brazil still million, cleared number March 9, peaked 1.5, dropping fast, looking drop back day two.) official count, India seems cleared 1 million April 9, though admittedly height ceiling given explosive trajectory, size density India's population rather concerning. think people would also hesitant refuse vaccine flat asked doctor. 'Querdenken' movement simply people denying Covid. founded based that, quickly merged together preexisting right-extremist movements, voicing death threats opposition illegally arming themselves. capitalize people rightfully/understandably fed pandemic measures try use radicalize them. feels like pandemic first new green pass.

I see term. reading, sounded like talking businesses green passed. say it, sounds like people get green passes.

So exactly green pass?   steep drop deaths elderly seems like first sign road recovery. vaccinations Brazil continue good pace, things much better next 4-8 weeks. Better line cook! think probably pulled forward, glad see setting firm date. Cuomo's refusal give timelines/metrics recent months make grandiose announcements improve image infuriating. 

Also think full reopening likely include lifting indoor mask mandate vaccinated people. mean, could also look polls conducted subject see say!

For instance:

* (over 11,000 interviews, 29% Republicans refuse vaccine)
* [http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-the-biden-administration-covid-19/#sthash.cI8mHWqH.dpbs](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/npr-pbs-newshour-marist-poll-results-the-biden-administration-covid-19/#sthash.cI8mHWqH.dpbs) (1,200+ polled, 49% R men refuse, 34% R women refuse) 
* (June 2020 -- R: 58% would get vaccine, D: 81% would get vaccine, I: 72% would get vaccine)
* (November 2020 -- R: 50% would get vaccine vs. D: 69% would get vaccine)
* (February 2021 -- R: 56% would get vaccine, D: 83% would get vaccine)

I make political (that would probably group folks who, back March 2020, claiming pandemic ""hoax"" drummed political opposition...). agenda narrative push, I'm guy internet likes learning stuff. actually facts/figures back assertions, unlike ton folks run across wild electronic frontier. 

Happy keep you, like, suggest find someone else try talk to. ain't gonna beat weak ass undergrad logic. anticipating busy year? exactly NZ Singapore never needed long-term lockdowns US many EU countries failed mitigation efforts plan. 

Not exactly. US fail. Europe actually completely crushed summer point level East Asia. strict enough border measures public health infrastructure keep way ended much worse second third waves. Ireland managed pretty much completely get rid new cases summer international travel grew exponentially.  lmfao Really hoping I'll able visit UK Christmas, especially vaccination programmes going well  assumes that:

1. vulnerable people able shelter. often case.
2. vulnerable people identified. Even underlying conditions, Covid still badly affect you. lottery.

If people ending hospital, Covid still spreading unchecked, lockdowns necessary. There's almost infinite shit-ton great bear USA. Pretty much liquor store walk going 100's (if 1000's) choices. easy live America fall back Germany's health care point life. Chinese vaccines drastically lower efficacy rates. low China trying make mrna vaccine like Pfizer moderna.

The Russian one seem ok. still good premier two usa vaccines. Confidence going effectiveness vaccines downplayed public health officials media. messaging slowly getting positive heard last several months was: ‚Äúget vaccinated life still won‚Äôt go back normal‚Äù. 

The message been: ‚Äúget vaccinated life go back normal two weeks second shot.‚Äù whatever wait period J&amp;J. People respond incentives getting back normal biggest incentive all. every time catch cold getting shot RNA. reached philosophical watershed that? need J&amp;J vaccine doctor's offices. lot harder tell doctor ""no"" give reason avoid getting it. made laugh sympathise. stupidity manifests differently. daily cases sub 1000 we‚Äôre going see big shift suspect hospitalizations sub 1000. think Murphy wanted confident cases would go coming weeks long based vaccine numbers he‚Äôll keep opening more. Especially maintain decent vaccine uptake. Also states like NY opening push already said bars serving bar top think I'd want see actual conclusive evidence that. cherry picked examples ‚Äî conclusive evidence showing German courts, breaking pattern rest world history, operate minimal corruption independently rest government, actually carry justice consistently. That's extraordinary claim requires extraordinary evidence. I‚Äôd rather poor Germany rich US. feel bad kids put karens Reckless.

Given cost pandemic, quite straightforward see positive impact kind global/alliance based ""shut down"" system travel would have.

People argue many complexities, hard. yet alliances like NATO rules place happens there's military attack. cost human life significantly higher war. *At peak*, days. lockdown, fall away quickly got there. someone bought tools vandalize cars posted social-media planning smash cars specific neighborhood specific Date &amp; Time... would want Police something ahead time stop (so car get vandalized).. think Police ""wait let happen"". 

The vast majority people want preventative measures. easier prevent things fix damage sit idly ""allow things happen"". (especially things could stopped ahead time) Pretty much no, distrustful suspicious attitude started long COVID-19 existed. could fly could grow organic jet engine butt, mean impossible fly. yeah, question vaccines. general immune capabilities vaccuum Oh no! horror Let‚Äôs clear. You‚Äôre saying layman. Nothing say educated better informed actual vaccines scientists saying. recommended take this. don‚Äôt know testing looking side effects translate larger mass vaccinations. 

We guess going happen based learned internet end day people always trust doctor internet medical advice. doctors scientists said take this. Covid real serious threat lives, economy, individual health medical bills. There‚Äôs nothing saying vaccines even close risk Covid. that? Lead Paragraph:

Instead listening politicians Yeah, deserve everything free everyone works *The Economist* get paid.  correction here: First, universal concept EU. minimum standard ECHR, really bare minimum basically every nation higher standards.

If refer German denial genocide law (and far know, ones it), never extend Armenian genocide. constitutional court made sure denial Holocaust possible German constitution anti-thesis Nazi regime understood connection full disclosure Nazi crimes. that, acts Nazis outside protection constitution.

While decision controversial, also means argument never repeated historical fact. Outside Holocaust denial, every content based law speech (in contrast function based laws like insult, slander, incitement hatred masses) strictly prohibited German constitution.  reason Berkeley CA antivax capital long cases still high, exactly. Probably someone German citizen emigrated somewhere else became citizen country. can't countries, 40+ countries living free (or low levels of) covid, compared America Europe? rich countries done vaccinating see reason would share rest world. truly end unless it. vaccine get?

edit: adding think clue talking Seems like excellent idea me. Totally rational, easy defend, nothing way meeting goal. ..... fine Right?? 

Keep downvotes coming LOL. Obviously many stuck sub see sarcasm. arguments governments medical experts monumental. loss life staggering, word properly disseminated airborne factor sooner officials, many could saved? Cuz know Germany never anything bad people disagreed them. India ally virus must friendly, China enemy, virus must hostile. That's happened politicians making policy rather scientists. Oh see. Though still seems odd 16+ population eligible know anything german covid deniers you? fair, getting COVID typically emergency room-type scenario.  Let retain hope /s necessary subreddit context. :( Sounds like good boi drinking, smoking football culture effect economy? Wait....seriously?!?

How paused flights India???? benefited test trace cases never low enough so. case future.

A health professional can't diagnose covid without test. similar mild whole host benign illnesses, bar symptoms. Knowing covid means take necessary precautions otherwise uneccesary, sparing others.

You specify testing healthy people, however I'd disagree entirely. need remain vigilant time sample populations monitor regional outbreaks, looking inevitable line next winter due vaccine hesitancy areas.

Testing provides really valuable data weeks leadtime. Without testing flying blind. know anything headline? Source that? thought read yesterday natural immunity great least 7 months?   traditional vaccine technology. He's listened zillion podcasts mRNA adenovirus vaccines feels comfortable older technology since vaccine manufacturers cannot held liable EUA /s thanks. sure question getting downvoted. ain't lyin unfortunately. i‚Äôve heard estimated number athletes, support staff, event staff, coaches, etc, would somewhere 30-50k.i feel like shouldn‚Äôt hard require get people vaccinated, especially alternative cancelling Hero. Except not. god painful watch. Oi growing evidence? 

Below posted says 95% efficacy ""at least"" 7 months. Seems like fairly similar protection vaccine. OMG!!!  Check [timeline cases rose Pretty shocking visualization. know *would* figure made investment, I'd bet always worth it. Everything risks, that‚Äôs individuals risk benefit analysis circumstances. personally think risk long term problems coronavirus far smaller risk mental health lockdown children (obviously older people). personally know multiple children developed life threatening mental health issues past year. risk staying home, risk going out. articles like one unhelpfully skew opinions people. Yup, certainly case lot folks vaccinated. point, know hesitant/extra cautious people expecting? imagine they'll cave going back normal, volition, due social pressure. don't. Check [timeline cases rose Pretty shocking visualization. bother trying explain honest, looks like understand concept appropriate sampling, likely going way head! No, B.1.1.7 UK strain. one dominant India B.1.617. True although never personally knew person died flu. Sadly know someone died covid breaks heart everyday. obviously live without taste smell would pretty distressing simple pleasures taken away. I'm going lie news people going months end without taste smell returning really helped decide get vaccine soon eligible. I'm going say nervous I'm also nervous stuff like this. honestly low end terrible things I've heard covid. I've Covid, weird smells comes strong smells like poop trash. weird chemically smell.

Other that, food tastes good ever did. That‚Äôs awesome :) heartbreaking That's entirely fair comparison. figure flu rate probably follows kind model - like mass testing flu COVID. COVID case rates tests, confirmed test lab. 'confirmed' COVID case rates probably undercounts true COVID case rate factor few. waste 10 years. improved feel better it, that's good thing. one take away you. saying Trump-supporter vaccine-denier patriots actually brainwashed Russia China? wow, mind-blowing  Europe killing now. They're pace first-dose level US 5 weeks ago. Canada even better; they're less 4 weeks behind US going faster pace.

Worldwide though still need ramp production many-fold. We've given first doses 3.3% population last chart showing percentage total population numbers percentage 16+ population. things cause rhino virus invade body, affect bodies natural ability fight rhino virus lowering immune system. Anyone else smarter elaborate though. Augustiner Helles ü§§ü§§ used easy Jets joke, now.....

Oh well. http://i.imgur.com/5llF0Uq.gif idiots made claim actual researchers made accountable it. remember argument doctor pandemic started praising doctor screaming left right masks don‚Äôt work. 

Before jumping conclusions research people use fucking brains little common sense. Masks absolutely protect contagious viruses spread saliva mini particles talking coughing, even 5 year old kid could come conclusion. Everyone knows idiots

Hey buddy, gave away idiots years ago. touch stuff anymore. Maybe get together eventually. way late though. see Trump Modi loved jerking off. ""I would say, please tell vaccine ever shown cause long-term side effect picked first two months""

How quickly whose developed narcolepsy Pandemrix show it? thought came months later. country‚Äôs regulatory agency approved vaccine, don‚Äôt hesitate take it. 

What country's regulatory agency hijacked approve whatever vaccine higher ups want approved, like Sputnik V? 50 cities cremate 22 folks day, that's 1,100 day.  clearing 4,000 day dead COVID alone including regular deaths, still going behind.  that's probably news read mostly Western countries. Trust me, people see much positive news Western countries neither. That's basically propaganda works everywhere. thought UK strain? UK strain months. Again, they're already going game. way future spread prevented risk spreading virus going game day exactly same. Memorial Day. know standard practice japan vaccines?i know US example pharmacists able give flu shots long remember ability carry transmit based contact change mask off. research suggest otherwise would love see it. reason mask virus gotten vaccine.

There ways reduce contact transmission, include washing hands avoiding touching things to. Cloth masks purpose block droplets entering/exiting nose mouth. 10X less viral load good news.

How would rank following activities least risky fully vaccinated people?

Working office, working service industry warehouse, outdoor dining, indoor dining, attending outdoor sports, attending indoor sports, movie theaters, museums, in-person shopping, theme parks, attending school/college in-person, gyms. Really think Lamont co couldn‚Äôt done better tbh, haters gonna hate he‚Äôs great imo Utahn's age 16 older eligible vaccine like literally every state apply logic vaccines. We‚Äôve much longer study effect covid children we‚Äôve vaccines, started mass testing 6 months ago. I'm curious ... President Biden WH marketing team print giant infographic got airwaves 8 PM one night run straight this? Couch direct unspinnable language possible. take questions end.

In week hire Morgan Freeman again. Americans take shots.  flu vaccine rate around 40%. 

Everything virus vaccine terriblely mismanaged parties. 

It wonder hesitation. 

$100 going get anyone homeless circuit get 10 shots each. agree! comfortable decision, go. get second shot today looking forward possibly riding roller coasters summer! let former citizens return live indefinitely, though. get this. afraid covid, want completeness travel such.  mean, we‚Äôre reaching point vaccine demand falling half US vaxxed. That‚Äôs enough. choices passports, dropping restrictions everyone hoping unvaccinated don‚Äôt cause surges worse variants (which really sucks people medically cannot receive vaccine), keep restrictions indefinitely. would choose option one, personally. Spend time NH made satanist baby killers choice. still well seasonal flu levels. 7 day average deaths 730/day 265,000 deaths annually. That's 5-8 times higher flu.

And also consider season. beginning May, flu deaths fall basically go nothing. Yet still seeing significant deaths.  Yes! Apparently, working parts world, think Africa? already immunity adenovirus strain. understanding, technology tweaked boosters. India‚Äôs credit good job containing virus...until Hindu festivals came everyone decided give caring anymore seems. US tracks extremists also, many countries. welcome make comment lmao. really care think honest. Except, not. Sweden got hit hard COVID. thought would reach herd immunity imposing lockdowns implementing mitigation strategies.

They found hard way good Fair enough. May hip back pain subside swiftly. Cheers!  swollen lymph node issue. It'll resolve week so. Adenovirus arguably new mRNA. first vaccine use approved last year Ebola? even made Johnson Johnson also. necessarily nowadays.

Because wanted to? year everyone gone back normal, flu return full force people learned nothing pandemic. know I'm pessimistic, see West adopting personal responsibilities like wearing mask sick staying home sick prevent spread. really hope people do. know people want shot get family wanting visitors potential travel requirements don‚Äôt give shit effectiveness. One shot appeals them. 100%.

But won‚Äôt, it‚Äôs much easier talk bs topic clue Internet. really true - love coffee COVID tasted absolutely horrible. can't even describe taste... 'off'. Luckily taste got back normal weeks since recovery still huge mindfuck time.  True. I'm sure confidence interval particular study was. 1/20 pretty damn good though. Hi, based comment, I'm assuming comment accident. Given context, could taken wrong way believe headline. I'm removing comment. Thanks understanding! this? kid probably got infected someone else, parents According actual number daily new infections estimated around 13.5 million, almost 1% entire population, single day. error bars course wide. know several folks Indian Ancestry went US spend prolonged periods India taking care elderly relatives could emigrate children various reasons. Nothing selfish taking care family members no-one else can. Coming home country citizenship that, responsibly quarantining selfish. Spain easter countries EU hesitancy bigger.

Countries like Portugal, Germany Spain problem reaching 90 adults vaccinated, meanwhile countries like France Eastern european countries might harder time, especially latter That's crazy work office works building multiple businesses (called tenants). White collar jobs lawyers, doctors, insurance agents, banks, etc. Every day someone building getting infected covid point shut building unless special permission enter it. office itself, one person every week get infected would cause like 10 people go quarantine... work hates phrase ""work home"". eventually cave know? Nobody getting sick more. Yeah bad, end May, US another 60m vaccinated.

So basically 300m population 330.  ways masks worn public useful majority

This true asymptomatic spread proven unlikely/rare,

This also true. No, main purpose prevent infection mrna vaccines incredible job (90% effective). spouse got JJ yesterday happy. Poland. need large influenza vaccination campaign, similar happening Covid. large vaccination campaign tandem low prevalence virus could make big impact potentially eliminate virus human population. important note human strains influenza core genome 1918 influenza core genome changes co-infection animal influenza virus. Animal influenza viruses generally jump human population directly. reassort human influenza. opportunity eliminate human influenza. possible. entire family breakthrough cases vaccination improbable point impossibility. vaccine provides stronger longer lasting immunity vs infection.

Well believe tech 1800s shouldn‚Äôt use im sure vaccine classified one usually amish community really dont come much contact outsiders abuse report button.

That seems like realistic outcome me. This.

What efficacy 3 weeks after? curious 3 weeks first dose, 1 week second. happy I'm moving away year. I've long enough. Vaccinated family... except kids can‚Äôt vaccinated. starts edging kind conspiracy theory ask ""okay, believe anything then?"" true many people lying much, end? now? covid even exist, happening now?

I know they'll stupid answers, grows absurd. glad least one person changed mind this! dad bitches selfish people getting covid vaccines don‚Äôt care others. point never gets flu shot, he‚Äôs like that‚Äôs different. it‚Äôs exactly same. Get help prevent spread benefit society. would help? Tell me.

Did know Moderna already waved it‚Äôs IP? completely open whomever wants use it. Yet, one manufacturer done anything yet. That‚Äôs they‚Äôd pay upfront costs test it, pay upfront costs convert plants it, hope nothing goes wrong. 

If state government helping, would fine. state government lifting finger. Fuck, companies India CHARGING vaccine Indian government refuses supplement.

I keep hearing IP talk one tell would work. I'm posting preemptively mock inevitable slippery slope fallacy response.

Carry on. ""*It's flu*"" teaches us one thing: person saying fucking moron. 
We've relatively lucky comes dominant flu strains last decades (even though several hundreds thousands deaths mild strains cause annually nothing sneeze at), several strains high pandemic potential (like H5N1 H7N9) make COVID-19, even SARS MERS, look like attractive proposition... pisses people STILL saying that... Honestly first question going be: go college? Hope so. variants evade PCR tests aren‚Äôt thing? Wow. You‚Äôre really reaching there. Make will. I‚Äôm going put individual studies could contradict CDC guidance takes account various studies opinions. 20 &amp; 30-somethings done pandemic now. They're putting pretense precaution make others around feel safe &amp; secure. Unless literally set mobile vaccine clinics like gourmet food trucks festivals &amp; stadiums half demo bother get shot. Hate say major employers require vaccination condition return office want reach herd immunity year :/ certainly measures kept like paid sick leave masking isolation sick. thought public health folks might things little better back napkin reddit math. think US surgeon general going answers people. offer $100 anyone gets vaccinated

Dont even need much. popup vax sites around breweries. Get shot? Get free drink.

Yeah, might fully ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, able everything could Covid restrictions aside SOMETIMES wearing piece cloth big deal. Hell, probably would good long run indoor mask wearing somewhat normalized infectious seasons. Plenty Asian countries that. Putting aside whether that's entirely true (they tested different times, certainly agree fact one dose still pretty damn good), what's communicated. 

The communication around ""you get one dose vaccine get two dose vaccine"" - there's mention happens get one shot Pfizer Moderna. Anyone who's reading ton knows efficacy numbers make reasonable connections, people reading actual data. I‚Äôve read, variants seem make folks sicker, earlier strains might less dangerous younger folks, new ones *can* moreso. yes... means exactly  mean end May Illinois tied reopening cases I'm feeling good plan.

The likely reason campaigns targeting Black communities specifically various Black communities common concerns, efficient target group tailored messaging. I'm running show, I'm guessing.

For worth, also concerted efforts target conservative religious Americans encourage vaccinations groups. Really, government campaign encourage vaccination targeting every group people come with. article gives useful, simple overview: government partnered with: NASCAR (huge Black following there, know), MLB, NFL, WWE, dozens rural organizations, faith veterans' groups, etc. etc. Heck, man, there's even get idea government targeting Black folks area codes? probably stay away whatever site offered take up.

But, yeah, we're playing numbers game targeting one ethnicity, I'd target white folks since make 76% population.

For example, United States 10% confirmed positives. 1 10 people gotten infected known it. consider usually getting infected leads infecting others family/social circle. 

So take sample town let's say 100 people. 10 would gotten infected. odds high 10 people belonged family friend circle infected other. 90 town stayed infection free. belong social circle outside 10, good chance know anyone directly. could 50 friends town still know single person directly got COVID.

Every American opportunity fully vaccinated by, say, July. absolutely reason keep mask mandates going thereafter. Guys question. family totally fucking batshit crazy giving ton shit wanting go get vaccine next week. need rebuttle following: 

-it change DNA! NOOOOO

-If get COVID vaccine, quarantine 2 weeks shedding

-TONS PEOPLE DYING VACCINE!! many people died vaccine

If actual common antivax dipshit complaints/replies, would love hear I'm sure three things tip bullshit iceberg I'm deal psycho family.  don‚Äôt disagree? agree something citation research? safe still ever be. ubers unsafe now, unsafe 5 years. Covid going away unfortunately. yes, long fully vaccinated, fine FDA improvement useful then?

Also board vaccinations already got 2 douses first point probably lot sway mind doubting people. one could conclude we‚Äôd stuck either, regardless. ruining everything Covid ‚Äúnew‚Äù? I'm huge Bill Gates fan means, reading comments videos see strangest vaccine conspiracy theories. 

 odd phenomenon, assume driven social media amplification self-selection. even lawsuits. think possible prove someone got infected covid enough accuracy would hold lawsuit.

It's wanting backlash first big company ditch masks. I've gotten every year always hate doctor basically shames getting young healthy adult, I'm wasting time Ressources (even though I'm paying doctors visit vaccines). FDA gold standard ***most*** places world 

Says who?? Americans? im FL getting Pfizer shot tomorrow, hopefully side effects wont hurt much. Yeah. one big problems covid. HUGE variability symptoms, asymtomatic course disease critical death everything between. Even symptomatic people get differently. people know COVID one developed cough. fever. diarrhea. Others bad headaches. Half lost sense taste/smell. half didn't. Weird disease Kudos German meticulousness. Without bloodclots stuff (which could found post approval) imagine phase 3 trial USA would get approval.

However, bloodclot stuff really doubt will, maybe would've earlier US rollout now. 


Not matters AZ currently approved 100 regulators around world. Woohoo! exactly, can't see corporate stores/restaurants/airlines/etc ditching masks YEARS ever honestly cover asses sued somehow someone got sick there.. think misunderstand people want vaccine. many, matter 'facts' - matter trust. 

I'm reticent simply trust government lied us illegal wars killed friends, refused anything *substantive* climate change 5 minutes ago, refuses anything homelessness federal level, refuses give everyone free-at-the-point-of-care healthcare, refuses institute higher minimum wage, locks black people unbelievable rates, locks drug users actively participating drug trade Latin America, refuses stop interfering country's business, can't humane refugees, suddenly started care me. think never reach herd immunity Covid simmering many years winter months. Maybe wrong acting guy superstition, feel two dose regiment provide better longer term protection. going something, going half ass it. &amp;#x200B;

 

# Rich Countries Signed Away Chance Vaccinate World

Despite warnings, American European officials gave leverage could guaranteed access billions people. risks prolonging pandemic.

 coming days, patent finally issued five-year-old invention, feat molecular engineering heart least five major Covid-19 vaccines. United States government control patent.

&amp;#x200B;

The new patent presents opportunity ‚Äî argue last best chance ‚Äî exact leverage drug companies producing vaccines pressure expand access less affluent countries.

&amp;#x200B;

The question whether government anything all.

The rapid development Covid-19 vaccines, achieved record speed financed massive public funding United States, European Union Britain, represents great triumph pandemic. Governments partnered drugmakers, pouring billions dollars procure raw materials, finance clinical trials retrofit factories. Billions committed buy finished product.

But Western success created stark inequity. Residents wealthy middle-income countries received 90 percent nearly 400 million vaccines delivered far. current projections, many rest wait years.

Growing numbers health officials advocacy groups worldwide calling Western governments use aggressive powers ‚Äî rarely never used ‚Äî force companies publish vaccine recipes, share know-how ramp manufacturing. Public health advocates pleaded help, including asking Biden administration use patent push broader vaccine access.

Governments resisted. partnering drug companies, Western leaders bought way front line. also ignored years warnings ‚Äî explicit calls World Health Organization ‚Äî include contract language would guaranteed doses poor countries encouraged companies share knowledge patents control.

‚ÄúIt like run toilet paper. Everybody like, ‚ÄòGet way. I‚Äôm gonna get last package Charmin,‚Äô‚Äù said Gregg Gonsalves, Yale epidemiologist. ‚ÄúWe ran doses.‚Äù

A vaccination center Rostock, Germany. 90 percent nearly 400 million vaccines delivered gone wealthy middle-income countries.

A vaccination center Rostock, Germany. 90 percent nearly 400 million vaccines delivered gone wealthy middle-income prospect billions people waiting years vaccinated poses health threat even richest countries. One example: Britain, vaccine rollout strong, health officials tracking virus variant emerged South Africa, vaccine coverage weak. variant may able blunt effect vaccines, meaning even vaccinated people might get sick.

Western health officials said never intended exclude others. countries facing massive death tolls, focus home. Patent sharing, said, simply never came up.

‚ÄúIt U.S.-centric. wasn‚Äôt anti-global.‚Äù said Moncef Slaoui, chief scientific adviser Operation Warp Speed, Trump administration program funded search vaccines United States. ‚ÄúEverybody agreement vaccine doses, U.S. served, go elsewhere.‚Äù

President Biden Ursula von der Leyen, president European Union‚Äôs executive branch, reluctant change course. Mr. Biden promised help Indian company produce 1 billion doses end 2022 administration donated doses Mexico Canada. made clear focus home.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going start making sure Americans taken care first,‚Äù Mr. Biden said recently. ‚ÄúBut we‚Äôre going try help rest world.‚Äù

Pressuring companies share patents could seen undermining innovation, sabotaging drugmakers picking drawn-out expensive fights companies digging way pandemic.

As rich countries fight keep things are, others like South Africa India taken battle World Trade Organization, seeking waiver patent restrictions Covid-19 vaccines.

Russia China, meanwhile, promised fill void part vaccine diplomacy. Gamaleya Institute Moscow, example, entered partnerships producers Kazakhstan South Korea, according data Airfinity, science analytics company, UNICEF. Chinese vaccine makers reached similar deals United Arab Emirates, Brazil Indonesia.

Preparing offload refrigerated container carrying Thailand\&amp;rsquo;s first delivery China\&amp;rsquo;s Sinovac vaccines Suvarnabhumi Airport Bangkok last month.

Preparing offload refrigerated container carrying Thailand‚Äôs first delivery China‚Äôs Sinovac vaccines Suvarnabhumi Airport Bangkok last patents would not, itself, solve vaccine imbalance. Retrofitting constructing factories would take time. raw materials would need manufactured. Regulators would approve new assembly lines.

And cooking complicated dish, giving someone list ingredients substitute showing make it.

To address problems, World Health Organization created technology pool last year encourage companies share know-how manufacturers lower-income nations.

Not single vaccine company signed up.

‚ÄúThe problem companies don‚Äôt want it. government tough companies,‚Äù said James Love, leads Knowledge Ecology International, nonprofit.

Drug company executives told European lawmakers recently licensing vaccines quickly possible, finding partners right technology challenging.

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt equipment,‚Äù Moderna‚Äôs chief executive, St√©phane Bancel, said. ‚ÄúThere capacity.‚Äù

But manufacturers Canada Bangladesh say make vaccines ‚Äî lack patent licensing deals. price right, companies shared secrets new manufacturers months, ramping production retrofitting factories.

Scientists working AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine University Oxford last year. British-Swedish drugmaker said cannot transfer technology quicker.

Scientists working AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine University Oxford last year. British-Swedish drugmaker said cannot transfer technology helps government sweetens deal. Earlier month, Mr. Biden announced pharmaceutical giant Merck would help make vaccines competitor Johnson &amp; Johnson. government pressured Johnson &amp; Johnson accept help using wartime procurement powers secure supplies company. also pay retrofit Merck‚Äôs production line, eye toward making vaccines available every adult United States May.

**Despite hefty government funding, drug companies control nearly intellectual property stand make fortunes vaccines. critical exception patent expected approved soon ‚Äî government-led discovery manipulating key coronavirus protein.**

It would offer great incentive people fence get vaccinated would allow capacity limits raised reaching herd immunity. would also support building rule eliminates use reach 70% vaccinated. headline wrong ... think. see link study, think one Axios linked to. study study effectiveness *preventing* hospitalizations, studying many seniors hospitalized COVID-like symptoms actually COVID whether vaccinated. 1/19 vaccinated individuals really COVID, thus 94%

Pandemics weird. think they'll drop time. hit 70% vaccinated July I'm concerned unvaxxed kids made go back in-person school, people right thing gotten vaxxed might give vaccine-resistant variant vulnerable loved one. 

The fact US capitalists blocked India getting needed vaccines going harm us.  Article says translates ""lateral thinking"".

Sorry questions :D COVID would easily inflict pandemic doom curves without them. Ah yes Russian conspiracy led multiple arrests Pretty sure has, least extremely low. Japan what, 120 million people 10K total covid deaths half million total cases? unlikely periods zero local transmissions numbers.  would imagine flights India still allowed health care system ruins.

this scientific communicators trouble communicating hte public...

the study protocols pivotal trials resulting approved trials goal producing safe effective COVID-19 vaccine prevent vaccine recipients getting sick covid (paraphrased). trial successful showing participants indeed protected vaccine.

the pivotal trial designed detect whether vaccinated recipients transmitting disease. even though scientists know lot covid vaccine almost certainly dose so, pivotal trial never examined point communicators might say ""the clinical trials vaccine test whether transmission prevented vaccinated individuals"" that's taken ""well help anyway.""

[Here's recent guidance CDC released PDF including images person wearing mask activities ""Indoor"" section.

I referring recent guidance, linked above, wrong. 

You referring older guidance personal gatherings, also wrong, answer outside context discussion new guidelines. ask family considered essential global pandemic.)

What could possibly essential traveling family care? 

Well perhaps traveler carrying 100,000 doses vaccine, certainly can't fathom ""work"" purpose important family. lmao People concerned mRNA steered towards Johnson Johnson option. Anyone beat old guy. takes strong person walk away. even saying? covid measures enough keep flu's R number consistently 1.0 - therefore never chance make run. wonder look like fall schools considering kids likely vaccinated then. Brit here, confirm. term ""alternative"", used top answer much better.  difference emergency approval.  fully approved FDA I‚Äôm sure vaccine mandatory colleges businesses. know several people covid affect way taste, couple quite young. couple say food drink always coppery metallic taste. strange certainly something I'd want.  Thanks!  CDC guidelines timid inconsistent. late: We‚Äôve known outdoor transmission much lower risk almost year now. move cautiously, sure, excessive caution creates fatigue mistrust. United States, case counts deaths trending thanks impressive vaccine supply, tragic reality millions already attained level immunity infected. past year, we‚Äôve also gained tremendous understanding transmission risks‚Äîwhere high low. It‚Äôs time rules reflect reality, spell reasoning explicitly, inform empower us trudge rest miserable pandemic.

This paragraph perfectly sums internally screaming computer TV ever since vaccine became available. People town (which never outdoor mask mandate begin with) completely losing minds this, thinking alone cause surge. likely smell fart wind catch infectious viral load covid outdoors. whole announcement anticlimactic delivery brought confusion fear. Even worse, opened another outlet deniers Facebook spew cheeky little comments saying ""There's mask mandate? town!!"" *(population: 50).* Ugh. I'm exhausted.  entire point everything we‚Äôve done, lockdowns masks social distancing, prevent hospital systems getting overwhelmed cases. That‚Äôs it. prevent death. prevent cases. long hospitals ok, good. 

We‚Äôve reached point people already vaccinated, immunity previous infection, low risk group. highest risk groups extremely high vaccination numbers. 

This over. suppose could say implementing beginning another way govt done fuckd thing, perhaps felt like people would less inclined get shot added looks like ""tracking"" it. 

dumb people ruining lives man... clean AC. would work. problem approach people vaccinated keep leading new variants evolving potentially less affected vaccine. thing want say continue insist covid continuing people selfish evil you‚Äôre flat wrong. Clearly people wearing masks distancing enough limit flu flat eliminate it. Covid much infectious, basically way similarly eliminate would lock everyone homes month, never leave literally anything.

Why both?

This virus far infectious flu, pandemic prolonged selfish behavior. easy fight best times, significant portion population following rules ruin rest us. option would covid competing flu, another theory I‚Äôve seen. would pretty nuts basically eliminated flu.

They're separate viruses. compete immunity one would provide immunity other. different variants ""compete"" sense - catch UK variant catch regular one vice versa. even then, likely getting exposed time strongest one wins. one contagious other, actually track different R0 values different variants. Often measures get R0&lt;1 original variant (i.e.: cases decrease time every infected person likely pass virus along less one person) sufficient get R0&lt;1 variants. cases see new strains take over. spread covid vulnerable people take months longer get infection rate stop wearing masks. 1. Take guy wrote slides.
2. math right. 168-96 number people zero doses. 168-96+69 anything. looking number one dose, 96-69. want number people left need vaccination, (96-69)(that's number need 1 dose) +46 (the number need either 2 doses JnJ). That‚Äôs fair Can‚Äôt wait Meadowlands September getting drunk booing shitty team. That‚Äôs officially back normal. think western regulators pretty good job without help. Haha. That's awesome I'm quite sure, think allowed considered ""essential"" like work family. 

(Don't ask family considered essential global pandemic.) Gotta real pathetic use something like this.

Even first dose we're probably basically there. Living? Working? Man, amazing possible population respects science uses common sense. France *even* secular Germany (let alone US), yet one third population sceptical vaccines. Test positivity NYC around 2%. rate cases falling vaccinations increasing, seems like sure thing test positivity fall 1% July. Pretty funny got called Querdenker suggesting focusing personal health, nutrition, etc. good way reduce risk serious Covid.

The whole thing silly, movement, like things, hijacked extremists lost credibility. Well, one ever expects mississippi come anything dead last. Whats really sad deep south neighbors apparently best show kind moronic solidarity. Living georgia knew numbers going poor went appointments booked solid clinics begging people come in. Michigan accounted 10% US cases recently Well point gotta say ""fuck em"" people refuse get it... rest world can't live Covid rules percentage people refuse vaccine. Sorry. Fuck em. 

Downvotes left people. haven‚Äôt found natural reservoir yet. know infect animals. flights India still allowed? problem 24 brought virus directly abroad thus considered part Israeli sample population. like got straight population 55% vaccinated equal footing infected 30 unvaxxed people 4 vaxxed--most people ran first round infections, happened outside country, would likely vaccinated.

Beyond sample size, know exposures occurred random group people. example, cases came outbreak elementary school (where teachers vaccinated) ultra orthodox Hasidic synagogue, would concerning fewer population vaccinated biasing numbers towards unvaccinated.

That‚Äôs true...most European countries travel ban list means cannot within last 14 days want entry US (unless you‚Äôre citizen) pretty sick 3 days, nearly bad flu, weird symptoms place. Mostly exhausted, stayed bed. ok back normal activities tired 2 days. sudden return fever one day, woke perfectly fine.

I tested negative antibodies.

My innate immune system fought fine. know plenty people who‚Äôve side effects vaccine bad worse actual illness.

I may get it, may not. know people who‚Äôve recovered it, two side effects, one, seems resolved heart palpitations she‚Äôs since infection, third sick month unable return work.
My guess myself? side effects would mild. Probably wouldn‚Äôt make antibodies anyway. Small risk major side effects.
I‚Äôm still thinking. know two people died it, literally side effects landed bed, pneumonia hospitalized dead. old. thousand reported deaths. 
I‚Äôm still thinking, I‚Äôm particularly nervous virus itself, gives lot pause. assume it‚Äôs offered along flu shot, I‚Äôll get it. also assume least HALF people yelling ‚ÄúMust get damn shot!‚Äù religious getting flu shot. again, employer fires employees vaccinated someone want work anyway.

Real answer: needles used COVID vaccinations smallest I've ever seen. like needles either I'm going go far say feel it, really felt like prick injection. Look away happening almost guarantee reaction afterwards ""that's it?"" Funny read thread earlier see comments deleted comments haven‚Äôt. guess referring mass gatherings political campaigns religious festivals. anecdotal, reactions Moderna seem common. Likely higher dosages. think Moderna 3x more.  think explains subs obsession masks. I'm people care less rules mask wearing be, want places open allowed see family friends. one countries list link, allowed enter US right now. know Belgian boyfriend able visit past people (on sub anyway) frequently asking for: commits lifting mask requirements 70% vaccinated. interesting see carrot effective.

Interesting concept consider CDC well. That's fair, public opinion U.S. could started working last year. 70% 16+ population, understanding. Okay good you. hope turn well wrong. Time tell soon enough. Pfizer moderna, meant. Incorrect, google ""breakthrough infections"" mask +vaccine condom+ birth control idea. Either helps together nearly 100% immunity getting vaccinated? Spain know nobody 60 got it. opposite dude mid 30s. First shot feeling bad, second one nothing. covid early on. calculating correctly? I'd love someone come along link actual numbers, anecdotally, reinfection seems still extremely rare. 

My current working theory - least US - there's HUGE amount overlap people going get vaccine people already COVID, meaning people level immunity quite awhile even get vaccinated. one way another, many people likely vectors spread point given immunity already COVID. Maybe coupled vaccinated enough get us need go. Get. Both. Shots. People. Hamilton amazing show great crew!! Glad got see it‚Ä¶.  Holy fuck congrats Germany, wish country half well do.

Likely many cases flu, seek medical attention never tested for. think good thing gave vaccine everyone eagerly wanted one roughly 4 months. Vaccine hesitancy always going problem turn efforts toward solving almost 6 months go next fall, country presumably biggest risk another surge. hasnt AZ partner American pharma company knows FDA process? seems like lot issues dont really experience FDA process. one big reasons keep reading BioNTech partnered Pfizer. Pfizer took care everything US. US tried stoping people coming China‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs cool, enjoy.

Countries like Brazil can't get vaccines West period. simply sale. know Moderna already waved it‚Äôs IP?

More precisely, Moderna proposed waiver patent rights duration pandemic lost patent litigation case Acuitas lipid nanoparticle patents, could cost Moderna 20% revenue. also NIH patents Moderna hopes use without pay much.

While agree rest argument, Moderna case shows even demand IP waiver motivated profits. Yeah, mean he's saying need immunity 90%+ range he's saying R0 high - herd immunity threshold pretty simple equation that's based R0. know masking grocery stores new norm That's actually way get people make jump. psychology missing rest. several room temperature IQ friends would literally convinced $100, nothing else.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* that‚Äôs wrong. take representative sample every year comparison. 

That‚Äôs like saying election polling useless talk thousand millions voters. It‚Äôs going exact it‚Äôll get within percentage points truth. case, talking 90%+ decline flu. Whether it‚Äôs 90% 95% isn‚Äôt really relevant overall point, it?   Sounds expensive. Here, take contactless thermometer instead maybe US start exporting? Stop America First, help countries like India. Lol I'm old enough remember Michigan's spike weeks ago Osterholm fanboys saying ""See! See! warned you!"" Then, predictably, cases dropped vaccines + natural immunity started making impact. 

I'm sure doomsday right around corner though Good ole behavioral econ. Ok. think 100 bucks going convince many?  people already got shot, get nothing?

My opinion lot hesitation caused real economic loss injured killed.  government fund starts sending payments seriously injured killed. People fear less. Russia itself, 3 Russian vaccines approved, bashing Western made vaccines technically directly affect efforts. However, likely information makes people fearful vaccines, thus indirectly sabotaging Russia's vaccination efforts. article references multiple geographic regions.  sure flu tracked US, Australia use multiple measures.

1) sentinel doctors (GP‚Äôs) report number (and percentage) consults influenza like symptoms (cough fever etc).

2) Similar sentinel hospitals reporting presentation admissions due influenza like illness.

3) Lab confirmed influenza notifiable disease law doctors labs must report central database.

4) Participants online tracking study report flu like symptoms week. vaccination status noted. vaccinated unvaccinated uptick symptoms there‚Äôs cold type virus going around. symptoms increase unvaccinated group, it‚Äôs flu.  measure designed catch cases mild prompt doctor‚Äôs visit.

By measures, flu cases dropped drastically.  Lab confirmed cases dropped 5,000-10,000 per month 50-100 per month.  online tracking reports flu-like symptoms.  it‚Äôs like serious cases vanished.

We minimal covid cases/deaths can‚Äôt say susceptible people already died.  lot testing.

Can‚Äôt find much flu isn‚Äôt much here. wife got second shot yesterday pharmacist called show ahead her, vacation Hawaii. don‚Äôt need rebuttal. go get vaccine flu barely spread via surfaces. Maybe 10% transmissions max Joe Rogan said .....


/s  here, hate got back return incredibly insensitive. take look thread. I've also lost people, work medical field. people unrelenting care. 16+ years old based first dose. Well duh, actually 6G /s say them, ""here's gun 100 bullet chamber, loaded one bullet, would put head pull trigger?"" makes happy too. obviously superior vaccine terms logistics since mobile vaccine centers new locations every day. Make ultra convenient help stragglers get vaccinated. variant

This thing. Stop fearmongering. problem stress anxiety affect cycle, plus million things. people get stuck confirmation bias. Looking forward seeing what's store mRNA technology. CT generally progressive state that‚Äôs really sensitive issue taxes. Lamont always going criticized Republicans state matter what. We‚Äôve living midpoint listened comments made podcast morning. listen spectrum commentators Covid (he‚Äôs obviously pessimistic side).  understood measles comment section basically saying hard herd immunity new variants. sure referring R0 value much way measles actually ‚Äústop‚Äù spreading immunity 90s. Maybe that‚Äôs splitting hairs. it‚Äôs still pretty alarmist IMO 7/10 people area vaccinated/immune can‚Äôt see unending outbreaks forever seems wrote context statement. least took it. specifically talking people yet gotten covid, sorry clear yrs ago, situation never gotten around getting flu vax. sis got preggers baby due peak flu season, asked close family get shot. non-event, no-brainer started getting every year. easy, sure before. always get flu shot now. Even guarantee right variant, that's risk willing take bc far tell, downside! (not even time, bc get yearly physical, would doc anyway). know around providers planning starting administration early first half May, probably next week. know sure. remember viruses exponential growth decline depending R rate. North 1 exponential growth south 1 exponential decline. look graphs article, pre-pandemic experienced exponential decline every Summer extremely low levels flu exponential growth every Winter. R would fall 1 Summer would go 1 Winter. Covid precautions like masks social distancing allowed us keep flu R 1 even Winter. never chance grow. person is, average, infecting less one person. 

Make sense? got pcr test ill get results hours thx u guys People get vaccinated aren‚Äôt dying though. It‚Äôs even worth discussion vaccines good.

Also dumb people shouldn‚Äôt certain freedoms? What? Aren‚Äôt called french fries? Lol.. also reference sub Reddit called Hold fries. That's great put firm goal there. Hopefully, encourage people get vaccinated. need masks high vaccination rate. sad thing last thing I, British person, want derail vaccination programme cognizant three things:

1. Currently rates Covid incredibly low
2. data changing, negatively, vaccine
3. want much countrymen get back normal

Our rates low makes sense give vaccine anyone age 50 given chance death. would happily sacrifice bit lockdown ensure young, healthy people sacrificed needlessy sacrified go pub normally again. sad seeing vaccine rile natioanlistic fervor people. safer alternatives access to!

Broadly supportive vaccine, good good certain demographics certain timepoints. That's nature drugs, vaccine mean exempt scrutiny.

To honest, cannot believe first comment laying bare simple facts downvoted, like people putting fingers thier ears want hear anything bad. like policy, I'm confident change people's minds. think prefer WV's policy ""want $100 savings bond? Get shot."" You‚Äôre comparing national responses countries response individual states America. States don‚Äôt authority, power types things. you‚Äôre country that‚Äôs fire due lack federal direction, want state like CT. would Toronto follow CDCs recs He‚Äôs wrong things right thinks, like everyone. due diligence take important medical advice cage fighting commentator. 

I will, however, continue listening talks fighting comedy. Similar here. Kind felt like dehydration headache woke up, 20 hours 2nd dose. may dehydrated soccer played night before, typically get those, felt like hydrating well. Snowboarded fine next day. Arm felt sore maybe 24 hours, didnt impact day all. spotify well stock 30% time highs. bro stogan money well spent would extremely surprised hear anyone caught covid second time worse outcomes, unless compromised immune system first case severely damaged respiratory system. 

We know fact happened. 100% confirmed cases (sequencing showing reinfection different version virus residual first infection), good chunk people worse died second time. One deaths most-definitely compromised immune system started chemotherapy infections, think least one known issues. feel going add confusion everything. is, simple mandates ""wear mask"" ""social distance"" disastrous results.  didnt even feel either two injections. needles tiny close painless even imagine. Simple easy.  Oh, ok, one outraged border ‚Äúconcentrations camps‚Äù, aren‚Äôt now, they‚Äôre ‚Äúprocessing facilities‚Äù? 

Yup, two sides different, one super bad, one super good   Fuck that, knew. lot us did. Olympics happening 100% Hello thank you!

Is anything would speak first shot vector-vaccine second shot mRNA one? know somebody situation right now. use go work listening Joe Rogan, use love conspiracy theories would get covid kicked stance took Bill Burr roast ass started realising wrong was. the...?  checked dashboard (NC) numbers going good direction? Tell viruses spreading people contact other. opinion CDC handled well public relations standpoint, standpoint matter? people telling us buy masks last March. They're people flip flopping positions surface transmission. press conference talked asymptomatic spread really meant pre-symptomatic spread? They're jokers refused tests countries insisting develop fucked month shit spread undetected. know, man, think many people issues cdc's credibility? That's motivation. track record job, I'd expect get fired. Stronger arms body hair /s Joe nice guests, joe smart. know anybody watches joe, watch good guests. They're extra tangy since there's much disinfectant applied last year.  ""I got extremely sick preventative mesure get sick."" FDA giving recommendations hasn‚Äôt officially approved vaccines? read? literally did. also called people wearing masks p*ussiess. Bill Burr call out. Stop defending abhorrent garbage. feel like unfair bros. Sure lot bros fans kinds people listening JR makes things like even dangerous. still risk getting Covid, getting bad enough land hospital. None vaccine manufacturers say catch COVID vaccinated. know, details hard understand lol   hear comment. 20% protected reinfection 6 Wish could get vaccine buy-in like Georgia.

I like tieing re-opening goal. really answer questions. 

Is situation mostly caused new variant breaking vaccine/antibody protection like SA variant? so, impact hospitalization/survival rate? case, rest world take early precautions relaxing measures even vaccination

Or situation mostly caused large gatherings? case, safely continue current path.

And saying both. course effects contribute current situation, major cause?  Ever Dont pay attantion virus reached escape velocity. time we've vaccinated enough population meaningful impact, hundreds thousands would died. thing save us right know hard lockdown. Create global stream.  Lmao you‚Äôre anything like rest sub, calling asocial rich. asocials ones calling restrictions mandates year half, crying people don‚Äôt. guarantee people think getting vaccine burden ones carrying normal possible entire time. Shut take onnit throw around kettle bells, you. Vaccines aren‚Äôt 100% effective. chances you‚Äôll catch virus spread lower, aren‚Äôt zero. since everyone already masks gotten used wearing them, there‚Äôs real reason prevent non-zero risk. keep   know dojng He's right lot stuff. mean like them. think? Good thing already wear masks secret orgy mansion. Working automotorator Thank this.

I'm sure already settled test experiment ""vaccine"". Next experiment yearly booster shot.  Good auto moderator I'd say advice starting growing podcast would pretty useless anyone already famous. successful stand TV host started podcast, started time way less podcasts.

His advice would probably step 1) go back time, step 2) get TV, step 3) invite famous friends podcast. gold digging whore epidemic country god I‚Äôm glad someone mentioned it.    COVIDiots told government would never tell us ok longer wear mask, get power. flights almost half Indians COVID positive. Edgy think public figure encouraging 10 million podcast listeners get vaccinated worthy discussion coronavirus subreddit?  Rogan done either things though. Don‚Äôt worry, lot masks  sounds like things really starting improve NJ all. rate transmission crashed 0.88 0.80. Yes, 0.80! seen number like long time now. citizen NJ awaiting end pandemic, enough make hopeful.

Oh yeah, I've heard DiBlasio NYC, he's actually considering ending mask mandate (even indoors) June (depending things look then), so... maybe hold state case. long cases flare NJ (not they're likely to; we're almost 3 million people fully vaccinated, 1.7 million go), lose midsummer.  Joe rogans giant douche swazzle piece shit. gurus podcasts people knowledge insight subjects guy standing next grocery store eat shit like last doughnut earth.

I mean ever met people tried hang them? addicted pod casts I'll tell that.  Joe idiot. Thank Fauci! podcast? love bill burr best sort thing good argument stand fall based merits, credentials person making argument. They're declining never going able sustain rate weeks ago anyway.

I like chart gets posted thread broken age group -- younger groups lagging behind got slow start roughly .5% latest update. even rate holds (hopefully JnJ coming back offset recent decline) we'll another 15% next 30 days would put every age group except 16-17 year olds basically 50% higher.

Also, we'll see big boost kids approved (presumably near-ish future) big help overall herd immunity. come EUA we'll military businesses require vaccination help, too.

Finally fact looks like big percentage colleges requiring help give nice boost younger age groups maybe less interested / fear COVID less.

So, all, happen -- we'll get there. beginning May like rate projected weeks ago, even slowing we're going stopping time soon. Josh Rogin. spouting conspiracy theories pointed things previously unknown.  Yup gave vaccinated people can‚Äôt read reason wear one too. says it‚Äôs safe outside HOUSEHOLD, people act like public park house hold... ~19 million Californians least one dose vaccine, there‚Äôs extremely small 0.01% chance breakthrough infection (since 1,400 breakthrough cases reported California), lot people get breakthrough infections, compared rest vaccinated population number almost minuscule. 19,000,000 vs 1,400. Vaccines work. talk personal experience them, sure. sure shit ain't neuroscientist. Yeah too, granparents got vaccinated today least something look forward to, seen almost 1 year half now. Maybe something similar you? friend another country something? Thank time well!    I'm facing hesitancy 16-year-old daughter get vaccinated. could tell one thing attempt convince would be? true, need morons get shot too, we'll never get virus control. Plenty morons right thing, common sense unless someone muddying waters misinformation. always one 12 year old makes ‚Äújoke‚Äù. random guy approach day walking dog asked wearing mask told gonna get started shouting insulting walked away, like, approached me, man, I'm minding business! wearing mask offensive action sorts people? Honestly, difference huge, even China step in. Last year, cost resources whole China contain pandemic Hubei province alone (there thousands cases areas). can't imagine possibly handle spread country 1 billion population.

But, admit, China one higher chance succeed countries.   . post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Whereas Americans, people free stupid awful want. generally, will. good everyone, know conduct business genuine foundation good ill. Funny *'attending school classroom full people young received vaccination'* there. would *""least safe""* category.

Politics still rules science public health. Exactly.

The CDC absolute garbage entire pandemic. mean students should.not P.E new variants emerging around world less impacted current vaccines. tough estimates Israel Pfizer/moderna vaccines roughly 8 times less effective South African variant 2.5 times less effective UK variant considering prevalence now, can‚Äôt see new strains (and future strains) won‚Äôt pose serious threat herd immunity. can‚Äôt understand ‚Äúvaccines put nanochips body‚Äù good faith.

""All better."" folks think smarter epidemiologists CDC - aren‚Äôt. new disease lots unknown factors. So, course many predictions wrong, course nation‚Äôs public health agency going err side caution. 

But guy read articles, don‚Äôt know people study stuff living. People thinking knew better led winter surge killed many people. What's fucking point anymore.

Vaccinated: wear mask
Non-Vaccinated: wear mask that's case EU pretty strong case Astra promised something knew fulfillable, that's bad faith promised legally penalized sure.

I'm hopeful EU get vaccines. Going courts indicate that. probably showing Astra negotiated bad faith fulfill duties.

Came laugh Karens saying cdc guidelines weren‚Äôt strict enough....wasn‚Äôt disappointed. Glad moved free country Florida. guys never going back normal lol There's difference eradication disease globally ending COVID endemic disease developed countries. Developed countries eliminated tons public ills. 

The goal always get rid endemic diseases entirely feasible, low-impact, cost effective, safe so. And, know today, COVID definitely appears disease case. mutate quickly, effective vaccines, mutation-resistant attack surface (the spike protein), animal reservoirs appear common source human transmission (as evidenced countries eliminated COVID hard way already - e.g. Australia, New Zealand, China).

I know public health notion throwing hands air saying ""meh, tried!"" disease safe, highly effective (90%+ protection infection) vaccine.

There nothing stops us eliminating SARS-CoV-2 endemic United States vaccine hesitancy. Elimination require restrictions - restrictions end long, long disease longer endemic - elimination require vaccinations.

This attitude endemic spread deadly diseases easily controlled copacetic ""because hospitals overwhelmed"" silly absurd. Polio never overwhelmed hospitals either, killed far fewer people COVID ever invested time effort eliminate disease. Yellow Fever Malaria used endemic United States - applied focused control pest elimination efforts end United States. Measles (much harder control COVID), Rubella, Diphtheria eradicated domestically well, although unfortunately measles outbreaks incurring increasing frequency due anti-vaccination communities. 

Cholera diarrheal diseases - perhaps technically eliminated - controlled completely public sanitation. think everyone able fling sh*t streets rivers whenever convenient public sanitation hard?

Just order know talking about: many doses think realistically come UK EU then?

The EU wants doses, 10s millions, hundredthousands.  guys know Joe Rogan comedian... right? Like trade. agree Dr. Fauci? point makes less likely spread vaccine Yeah highly inaccurate apply entire country. fair assumption somewhere like Delhi. think would true south north east.

[Vaccine FAQ Part FAQ Part appointment bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yes, exactly. vaccines. Thats difference. see people wearing masks driving car alone. ALOT seems straight forward. fewer people feel exposed fewer people feel symptoms fewer tests. zero reason asymptomatic testing. numbers don‚Äôt add up. Conservatives tend older (actual taxpayers) ones getting vaccine. liberal youth ones shunning it. Also, I‚Äôm positive poll conducted inner city, else results would way different. knew way then, thats bit short sided. Many reported deaths infections January. month 100 deaths per day. yes, thats many others believe over. Much like ""Presidential lie counter"" went away January. realize exported 60 million vax right?  teens vape People might better able accept defined improvement metric &amp; objective. - keeps getting kicked Yet Rd, many people going sign indefinitely.  gotten religion point. could woods see someone masks 100s meters next closest human.  difference March last year lot unknowns, virtually zero immunity, cusp overrun unprepared country seeing major cities end like NYC things get shut hospitals overrun.

As today high level immunity among older populations vulnerable point anyone 16 wants get vaccinated. There's simply anywhere near likely chance hospital systems overburdened point. mention. much better shelf life Pfizer / moderna stored room temp.  Yeah. Right now, seems like there's incentive getting vaccine. definitely still wear mask. love group. freedoms applicable. hail almighty straight white Christian pro life man. ü§Æ you‚Äôre grasping straws attempting discredit vaccines, even vape pen do. Agree. also think people able criticize opposite without constant accusations wanting kill everyone. Yeah hear you. I‚Äôve even commented shouldn‚Äôt lumping discussion lifting mask mandates discussion lifting business restrictions cause actual harm people‚Äôs livelihoods.

But I‚Äôve realized lot people want full normalcy point, especially they‚Äôre going go effort minor side effects getting vaccinated, see mask symbol lack normalcy. Also, governor said indoor mask mandate end 2/3 NC adults received first shot. would make sense say vaccines first rolled months ago. 

Now US nearing max demand, makes less sense frame way. Hell I‚Äôm keeping mask winters/flu season on! going teach people touch mask/face dirty hands, clean dispose masks use, keep tightly sealed nose around mouth, wear N95 similar? Because, I‚Äôm sorry, Mickey Mouse print cloth you‚Äôve worn every day week pulled 4 times past minute scratch nose protecting anyone. anyone know works like would gotten bad case covid likely get bad side effects? 13 yo wants get it. I‚Äôm inclined let even though I‚Äôm kind careful stuff based medical history. hope means get younger ages sooner fall bc think fall openings schools might weird it‚Äôs available. I‚Äôd really like ditch masks school normal long wear mask? big thanks providing data daily. It‚Äôs interesting me. evidence support claim vaccinated people spread virus? think accurate answer know yet vaccinated people wear mask case. Perhaps get vaccinated they're eligible? Belgian courts may decide AZ ship doses UK plants, doses UK, created contract English law UK government. UK EU more, decision Belgian courts irrelevant, doubtful they'd able persuade English court enforce ruling given UK government would also strong case doses. keep guidelines, mask free since day 1!  TL/DR?    appreciate honesty logical consistency. BUT... username also makes comment hilarious!  Outdoor contact sports low risk. Masks shouldn‚Äôt required. send India

Australia part Commonwealth. Post EU Britain want shake alliances.

I'm saying sending Australia ""better"", merely saying there's obvious reason UK chose send vaccines Australia first. Holy crap right! looked actual study. 

What terrible study. Seriously, straight-up garbage anybody signed name fired. know. I‚Äôll think I'm also enthusiastic vaccines. One best ways get people lining vaccines would skip obscuritanism tell people, ""get vaccinated move life"". spread virus to?

People want vaccine... Thats them. Ever hear guillian-barre syndrome?  Spain ending curfews May 9th. live deep South right now, even access vaccine.

There really excuse yet.  get I'd need wear mask anything vaccination. I'm immune I'm going foreseeable future risk infection extremely low. say time accept small risk part life go back business usual past vaccine.

(I still wear social implications, mask mandates, etc.) Estado de Alarma ends May 9th. still restrictions mid July Bolsomaro result people like bolsonaro..he merely symptom disease Call bit skeptical. numbers suggested cases number vaccines already given U.S., would suggest approximately 300MM would antibodies - necessary theoretical herd immunity. 

We still many cases reported suggested level immunity. ever living hell mean lol. lived taught high school rural African country. definitely competitive interscholastic sports.  Book appointment convenient get whatever have. asymptomatic covid. SARS-CoV-2 virus body. Sure wouldn‚Äôt believe headlines. 

I think media needs knock off, CDC needs quick fooling around ‚Äúlife isn‚Äôt normal vaccination‚Äù stuff, maybe you‚Äôll see people want get it. 

Set realgoal like 70% (or whatever) vaccinated life back normal, watch demand vaccine rejuvenated. 

A real subset people aren‚Äôt interested vaccine doesn‚Äôt lead normalcy. that‚Äôs I‚Äôm asking question. Somehow conflating 8 year old playing little league pay interscholastic high school sports I‚Äôm paying for. thing Trump fucked everything much worse one wants call CDC failures fear giving aid comfort Trump horde orcs.

Yea no, that's why. complicated made complicated people trying hunt certain carve outs regarding situation using carve outs discredit group experts can't possibly account 350 million people's unique needs. Trump not, CDC difficult task, matter would enemy.

Do really believe people would perfectly fine CDC bring clots? left everyone else determine fine it? would worked? country keeps ordering people keep getting them? 

Again, passing buck disingenuous. people last 4 years now, minus people TV. dont believe? fast built hospitals many hotels set quarantine people? know two things could done places, explain thats free democracy?? wait let hospitals overflow decide ration care supplies, undemocratic?

no countries never said cases lmao, dont widespread cases all, anywhere. youre making statement thats true

if underreporting cases woudlnt become like india? like look india whats going there, hiding cases bodies whatever, would look like that, im sure media would jumping didnt obviously didnt happen. Isn‚Äôt Moderna that‚Äôs approved 16+? Might don‚Äôt much opportunity people 18. social media also full fake accounts spreading misinformation don‚Äôt want us get vaccinated. Probably sub. guess world witness Great Barrington ~~Declaration~~ Deception play real life. Nah dont view word freedom others do. ok trading freedoms away little safety. Others us arent. would argue coddled one since dont think know well enough take care yourself.  sitting inside everyone, prep staff included, needing masks COVID checks. several restaurants (including fast food) around close one workers tested positive, otherwise fine continue wearing masks. Right now. Start it. me, like August. everyone chance don‚Äôt give flying fig anymore. I‚Äôve got empathy people actively choose disregard best interest ‚Äúown‚Äù someone damndest try prevent spread whole thing. don‚Äôt care me! I‚Äôm part &amp; following rules compassion well dried anyone who‚Äôs chance, doesn‚Äôt get vaccine simply don‚Äôt want to, end sick. joint pain practically went away within 3 days 1st Pfizer vaccination. suffering knee, shoulder, ankle pain years. Bonus! suffered negative side effects second dose either. should‚Äôve gotten like 7 months ago flu seasons  Ok stay house wear mask forever. Wouldnt wanna make sure u didnt enough. told elsewhere I'm comfortable that. yet. Getting viral illness make sick quite while, I'd prefer precautions place people around unvaccinated. real period months first dose number uterus get shed. month later I'm starting get another flow. coworker ended getting cycle week early day first shot. I'm assuming us unicorns saw enough mentioning (almost) blame shot. vaccinated protects better worn mask did. $OCGN moon. vaccinated infection rates region low least lowering fine. there's reason stay completely locked down. dunno, reducing odds getting sick dying seems like pretty good reason me. find mask enormous inconvenience. It‚Äôs dehumanizing, makes job teacher much difficult regards speaking to/hearing students podium. fully vaccinated months now, last year assumption would longer need masking vaccinated, think fears gotten best us causing people find difficult let go masking. us vaccinated, think it‚Äôs keeping appearances following science point.  sTiLL CaRriEr Wearing mask?

Still waiting clarification. [Reminder CDC statement eggs yolk white firm. Egg dishes cooked internal temperature 160¬∞F (71¬∞C) hotter.

There it, easy eggs soft boiled eggs simply risky. I'm arguing point, putting perspective level risk tolerance expect CDC.  show ACTUAL graph refuse post websites saying mask completely useless- suggested 2 instead 1 year? 

curious minds would like know Florida still rule bar old roommate worked apparently allowed count cans red bull food.... relaxed happy shots. I've insane amounts stress ill health life none ever affected period.

This vaccine has. (Hopefully temporarily.) I'm saying reason avoid vaccine (not all!) I'm fed argument somehow psychological. It‚Äôs probably age-related. Older people (over 60)have gotten vast majority shots ones know issues all. love exploring graphic. One takeaways discrepancy median highly vulnerable less vulnerable bad might feared, spread overall crazy. Frankly people see wearing mask lock couple months (which lots people states didn‚Äôt even follow) freedoms freedom choice taken away Americans really coddled I‚Äôm waiting till Vaccinated people don‚Äôt wear mask inside. day comeeeeeeee infinity stones That‚Äôs great point too. really felt recently. foster go new home 4 month boy. Obviously, point, inseparable. came time drive foster new home, stupidly wanted say ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù course couldn‚Äôt communicate would parting ways good. :( 


Seeing dog‚Äôs confusion came come without foster brother... broke heart. hope future make device talk lol. Christians willing go home Jesus benefit others accept decision makes it. ultimate selflessness, selfishness.

If understand basic premise Christianity, spend enough time church. Today like pictures. still many words. good keep people informed. That's wanted know. Agreed. Perks old fashioned AC haha  planning getting J&amp;J shot day shut US
The reason become I‚Äôm young, already COVID, bit chicken comes needles, thought one done appealing.

I wanted J&amp;J shot, second thoughts, better toughing getting two shot robust protection, misinformed protection different three?

If it‚Äôs much difference I‚Äôll opt two shot, however preferably one done sounds way better me. Ha! Yeah, friends playing Kirby's Return Dreamland, drew characters MS Paint stat tracking endslate. New York already that, didn‚Äôt they? That‚Äôs Ohio too. Wasn‚Äôt able get anywhere near city went CVS Amish country. pharmacist told person scheduled week.  ended today, Legislature NY repealed me. Almost non-existent. second dose last week it‚Äôs looking same. Looking back seems started calling pandemic 1,500 cases per day mid-march. Interesting many people consider 50k cases per day over. guess. kids, know how, ""I din't *ackshully* say that"" works.

&amp;#x200B;

Alppreciate feedback, though. cares people don‚Äôt want get vaccinated. protect one means protect themself opts to?  IDK downvoted. Doctors give patients facts straight up, can't CDC? believe hearts right place, attempting steer people toward caution morally defensible. practice? complete disaster everyone partisan Fauci worshipers see clear day hope wrong feel like NJ last state union remove restrictions. number probably lie(a overestimate per say, natural immunity US didin't get high either even worst peak, beforehand India ACTUALLY practing restrictions spared high case counts intially, meant many people getting it, peak never got 100k people infected per day) got low 10k people per day spiked again. meant many people exposed covid.

Clearly percentage people natural immunity lower even WAY lower 50% India never really got bad now. likely US mutiple bad waves, India 1(which even bad)

Even taking 60% number half billion people still get exposed poor sanitary condtions compared countires like US, UK, Isreal. lot cases = lot lore mutating = less effective vaccines everywhere else here.. bummer. enough room money possible. Sports league pay reap benefit pay OS? host country less direct benefits them? national team want compete? work large non islands. insanely easy close 2 airports NZ allow cruise ships. Again, that's 2 airports. Ridiculously easy. Glad see this. I'm still salty every one hometown teams made sport's final, 2/3 them, front empty reduced crowds.

Can't wait 100% see Bucs/Lightning repeat. People always look ways shortcut safety protocols. 

The people looking shortcuts regardless CDC says. Christ's sake, states require masks distancing all! time stop paternalistic garbage, talk people like adults, get ready open fair, rational manner.  worry, native English speakers speak well you!

 Anxious used meanings. anxious anxiety meaning nervous it. could anxious excited meaning looking forward it. tired hearing this. forced wear mask outdoors university entire time. outdoor mask mandate much alive well Chapel Hill. also real world data coming UK. Yesss. Glad see numbers finally crashing. We've hurting long NJ. winter really hard. 

NJ great vaccine uptake. see sunny summer thread us. 25% gang üòé think quite high overall efficacy numbers reported first dose reports. No, Illinois plans eventually lift distancing capacity restrictions, end mask mandate. allowed pack nightclub full people, required wear masks unless drinking. concerts, weddings, outdoor festivals. Churches, schools, stores, office buildings, everywhere else go require masks CDC says otherwise. never know 55% adults 55% population? 55% population, that's impressive, given Israel 30% population age 16. doses Halix plant argument?

You gotten doses Halix agreed sharing British made AZ earlier year. agree principle. Unfortunately chance missed. tricky British vaccine rollout much further.

As concern another comment - ofc second doses taken away. still spread virus vaccine symptoms show 14 days. triple masking quarintining every trip outside literally trying kill vulnerable That's highly misleading. can't use breakthrough numbers compared total vaccinated time delays.

For example, lets say fully vaccinated, I'm person protected vaccine. lets say eventually catch COVID 3 months now. Well, next 3 months would counting someone protected vaccine reality I'm make breakthrough numbers 3 months.

The breakthrough numbers would eventually trend towards trial numbers given enough time. that's fine - 95% REALLY, REALLY good. There's need misleading actual number good. That's true. agree inequitable access bad. there's way going change asking people less. find ways lift countries terrified needles,

but still got shot ""unassisted"", right.. ?

anyone need hold down? sedate you?

&amp;#x200B;

this poor That's public health contagious disease works.

But right - going. making tentative plans go may 9th game, so. Cries Los Angeles Angels Anaheim California, east Santa Barbera. Life isn‚Äôt promised easy. Close billion people go sleep hungry tonight   Hehe love there's data showing transmissions among vaccinated people cdc says still wear masks indoors. Pfizer already submitted request amend EUA 12-15 year olds Health Canada. would expect approved shortly US FDA. say that?!? Massachusetts no-exceptions outdoor mask rule (it ends Friday). least town everyone follows it. People walking dogs, couples holding hands, people sitting bench, masks one around. creates social pressure always mask on, usually mine too.

I see question posed threads like lot, makes think *most* people living constant outdoor mask use, wonder fuels 'cmon masks arent big deal' sentiment. assure living last year mask constantly outside inside, grinds down. ([Supemercados Guanabara's (a regional supermarket chain Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) anniversary joined chat) No, vaccines contain live viruses. two-shot mRna vaccines contain complete viruses all. feeling immunoresponse.   Sturm den Reichstag would like word you. Lol talking UK? Maybe. Whatever don‚Äôt think Olympics going take place year.

Mask then, stop complaining nothing like many like doing, get vaccine get summer plans set now. Tylenol, actually. temperature last night, 103 last time took last night. Woke 105 again, right Tylenol dose worn off. Took another one 45 min ago, I'm 100, that's huge improvement! I'll definitely call doctor creeps back 105 again. Figured I'd check see typical second dose symptom.  Yikes Adjusted population, would mean around 4.5 Million doses US! Great success, great see positive signs!  month later hoped honestly I‚Äôll take never type experience like 30+ years Deutschland. Wow. fantastic news, getting kids vaccinated start autumn term would massive. focus mass vaccination campaigns poorer countries, bit like Polio efforts.  2 whole weeks?! Yeah that's one pieces misinformation that's particularly dangerous \*sounds\* reasonable like could / true. fine -- everyone's immune system different everyone's body different. 

If particularly worried high-risk job something could go get antibody test wait several weeks do. sad see nonsense spread across globe. saw claims online vaccine could somehow make immune system lazy new variants ‚Äúvaccine created‚Äù antibodies cant deal with. claimed immune system wouldnt able react right antibodies allready ‚Äúthinks‚Äù immune reality isnt would get really sick. 

They said antibodies created getting covid wider spectrum vaccines. 

Is form truth this? Could someone ELI5? Hey, ever feel jealous, think us Indians. government tried best still position march 2020, no, way worse position actually. 

Getting vaccinated extremely difficult right Essential oils still good, right? think want hear *their* doctor need get vaccine, able see doctor person year pandemic.  Highest funded schools state, worst performance. Elimination means virus eliminated locally (as Australia NZ) Yeah that's point, it?

I fully see rich people issues getting top notch treatments US, that's point. trash cleaner germany basically get treatment project leader covered insurance. mean like investigate put surveillance facts found reasonable suspicion established? Hmmmm. Yes 60% population started drop 40% total 50% adults. Legally can't really. specific venue like concert hall sports stadium might require proof vaccine entry. limit business subset population invite legal trouble still it. city state can't require citizens vaccinated. Schools certain jobs can, legally fuzzy. simply way force adult take vaccine. obvious it‚Äôs actually chemtrails

/s Yes, painted - people think number - chance breakthrough reinfection. wrong.

Too many people cant deal with/interpret numbers, really important make misinterpretation even easier.  people gave positive karma exactly what‚Äôs wrong world, there‚Äôs something wrong leftists inability logic math. No. Put surveillance cigarette alcohol company executives. Surveillance anyone studying Quran Bible also. things promote public danger ideas health risks.    interested latest Yellow Card Report UK shows increased incidence VITT (9.3 per million) also 4 cases VITT post second dose (rate 1 per million it‚Äôs lagging indicator it‚Äôs likely higher). really quite worrying hope allow us single dose AZ switch something breakthrough cases, overall? 94% less likely hospitalized get covid-19 fully vaccinated, already less likely get vaccinated? event videographer specializing weddings. studio 10 12 events last year half tomorrow first one back shooting. Fully vaccinated since February I‚Äôll around 100s unmasked people starting tomorrow. I‚Äôve done everything since last March. many sacrifices professional personal life. Feels good come knowing everything could lucky enough lost anyone love. tides turning, we‚Äôre close end game. Stay positive everyone. Short answer Bolsonaro, like heart attack caused obstruction veins

Long answer gets way way longer, disease far dangerous. fair chance Bolsonaro gets re-elected 2022, even doesn‚Äôt wrong reasons (corruption). long Brazilians favor death penalties without trials carried citizens (a.k.a. murders) criminals, banishment public gay affection, praise Old Testament God almightier anything else, deforestation rainforest create jobs etc., new Bolsonaros keep rising power.

I know cases seem flatline places like North Dakota stay whereas Michigan double-hump. North Dakota never lot lockdowns, Michigan's pretty half-assed.

The total number cases North Dakota 14% population. Michigan 9%, Washington 6%. could 10% plus vaccinations virus fizzles given area gotten yet Washington. also depends population density state many large cities etc.

The virus can't spread forever especially vaccinations. Cases may never go zero huge surges almost over. Please, get vaccine. Seven day average 583260, probably go weekend.

The seven day average *always* includes weekend, would go next weekend?

July 1st schools out. First all, thanks snark. know things. key words said ""certain"". new approach I'm curious case made denying services broadly due health status like this. model minority myth shit people claim East Asian countries people wearing masks sickness pre covid really disgusting

It‚Äôs insane many people adamantly defend stereotype. ‚ÄúThey polite collectivist! always wore masks unlike west cause good!‚Äù

It‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs stereotyping based race, uptick Asian violence influenced racism towards Asian even think ‚Äúpositive.‚Äù sounds like people act like it‚Äôs cute fashion accessory. people aggravate end really seem populate website reason Damn great number CDC could ensure 100% people would follow guidelines letter, precisely, guidelines would likely COMPLETELY different. science vs people's interpretation vs enforcement 3 wildly different sets constraints. Hmmm, force pharmacist put mask prior giving UTI prescription. first shot claiming full immunity masks ""personal preference"". Corona virus real like flu real. 

It's likely number coronavirus deaths extremely inflated. Tell India what? Anyone print list! doesn‚Äôt warrant persecution covid-idiots broad scale. people Hopefully they‚Äôll consider moving cases basically nothing June. gotchu. person annoying pedantic. Ignore 'em. :) Fully reopen, minus Broadway large production. It‚Äôs fully reopen it!! businesses yes, specific requirements. broad-brush approach. Oh makes complete sense, national government extremely corrupt ex piliticians end cushy jobs massive companies career trade lucrative deals People back living life like it‚Äôs normal without masks lot states masks strict states. Stores, restaurants, etc least back like 50 percent used covid. think social mobility much higher combined fact areas much lower vaccine uptake. uniformly distributed imagine England. Yeah, I'm favor Memorial Day weekend target. way first dose vaccination rates declining, there's going huge difference overall vaccination rates 5/28 7/1. Full reopening minus Broadway large theaters. ‚Äúon track for. September‚Äù

Partial reopening would better headline US stocks. back-orders already committed release supplied Astrazeneca. otherwise hospitals get overwhelmed people die (see India).

Many saying keep restrictions zero TTI thresholds. Vaccination successful follow path. lawyer, answer ""it depends"". depends circumstances. clear circumstances meant ironic everyone knew list people beaten school?

These kind examples meaningless distracting, always depends circumstances. death list people voted corona measures covid-denier chat group strong indicator meant, matter attempts distraction. ""increased radicalization"" ""voicing critical opinion state mandated corona orders, Attacks Democracy""

In words, coronavirus deniers.

I mean coronavirus deniers idiots, idiocy crime, state putting people surveillance resources spending stuff matters?

If state mandated coronavirus restrictions must means prosecute restrictions. Putting old stasi onto truly sign failing society. want calqued, ""queer thinker"" movement unfortunately nothing advocating LGBT+ rights rather even tore rainbow flags apart stage protests. really well paying job like self employed healthy US place be. make comparatively money, disposable income life easy going.

I one weirdos never got flu vaccine knows get going forward, here's hoping everyone else also state mind cuz would definitely help. mind sharing state you‚Äôre in? Blue collar workers likely gonna remain stringent people office jobs, since office workers work home test positive, service workers lose 10-14 days pay get it, unless really generous employers.

Also yes, reply think bit, forgot coworker mine told back covid, time believe office people mandatory W@H also last year, summer time believe.

I‚Äôve trying, I‚Äôm super frustrated. keep directing app (which doesn‚Äôt vaccine options). might go another provider. Absolutely. I'm happy socially acceptable. So, would post address picture, claiming pedophile...you‚Äôd ok that? since majority vaccinated, one.

We absolutely vaccinated majority adults, nearly at-risk individuals. Kids represent risk, we've barely testing kids first place. thing need track point hospitalizations/deaths. keeping tabs enemies democracy organising vaccinations fuck government two things time ""Querdenken"" leaders denies Covid? Countries close borders place strict caps many citizens return time. (Australia comes mind). something considered. agree. Weird couple weeks ago posts like ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want show vaccine card go ball game, that‚Äôs oppressive dystopian‚Äù highly upvoted. Okay, thanks much replying. I'm still waiting test results touch Dr. think I'm hoping side effects I'm positive, would 2nd time almost exactly year later imagine also looking state sponsored agitators used disrupt government. 

Russia hugely successful asymmetrical attack US. Russia setup protests left right, amplifying polarization hobble us decade generation.

Hopefully we'll hearing news near future...the review 16+ took approximately 1 month. Terrible parenting. keep mind covid symptoms, still need isolate quarantine 10 days even vaccinated. that's huge hassle, bearable since work comfort corner office. But, shift worker Instacart Postmates earning anything sitting home. definitely something consider blue-collar worker. course worsens underlying conditions &amp;/or suffer effects infection virus leaves system. Besides, easier spread, still lethal. suspect will. Certainly UK graph second doses showing quite level would expected everyone getting second dose time (I've looked countries). 

If guess I'd suspect people side-effects first dose put second.  perhaps ""I've taken some, that's enough enough even though medical qualifications"" thinking results people finishing courses antibiotics. Per capita already has. Meanwhile friends convinced fAlSe PoSiTiVeS obviously can't true immediately clear would happen Nope, absolutely 0 experts consulted. actually asked one person every car 5 train thought day be. basically saying government forever always 100% correct never wrong topic?

Well yea. issue tell government correct concerning COVID19 based FUCKING SCIENCE. opinion. something argue one way another. facts people refuse accept facts. reading correctly all.

They talking vaccine breakthrough cases. I.e. interested positive tests vaccinated, interested subset result hospitalization, important obviously would signal vaccine evasion developing variants, makes sense.

It indicative stance testing general. majority us covered present, since majority vaccinated, one.

And again, increasingly narrow point making testing initial argument.  Confused too. think waiting get lot people get vaccinated. going good pace, people getting vaccinated claimed never would, people still don‚Äôt know eligible get it. 

This sub 2.4 million members, country 350 million people. Calm come Texas, almost restaurants 100% indoor capacity, even liberal Austin got manager exposed, simply put roommates‚Äô minds ease. manager wear masks exposed day worked her, honestly basically safety theater. 

But boom, positive. places could gotten roommates coworker guy sexually harassed street last week. 

I understand rapid tests aren‚Äôt accurate, I‚Äôve heard false negatives positives. think I‚Äôll get PCR manager negative, jeez. really thrown loop. Please elaborate. insane exactly? flu covid different. know I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre same. problem wearing mask asked to. I‚Äôm simply asking it‚Äôs us vaccinated wear we‚Äôve already done part. end government stress fact anti mask get ass vaccinated don‚Äôt need it. I‚Äôm self centered douche disregards others. took time get vaccinated. I‚Äôm simply questioning 5 vaccinated people room cater one asshole didn‚Äôt get vaccinated masking up. want come home, wear mask you‚Äôre unvaccinated. won‚Äôt be. Man wish, lived Texas Florida yeah I‚Äôm NJ know July 4 probably gonna point start really get normal-normal. Considering entire political party based selfishness, would correct  getting vaccinated puts others risk including people can‚Äôt get vaccinated (cancer chemotherapy patients) children

BuT sTiLL sPReaD iT!!!!

Okay, okay, yes, spread reduced completely literally every single situation involving vaccinated people, people think herd immunity is? Herd immunity transmission reduced massive scale order reach massive scale, makes sense talk transmission among vaccinated people like zero-sum game. Every individual vaccinated person step towards herd immunity act vaccines cannot work individual level completely counterproductive goal reaching herd immunity. know. want make clear. Otherwise people jump throat making people get vaccine go grocery store take bus. mean flu felt like head gonna explode whole week, coughing like crazy, felt like gonna pass out. still flu flu since risk killing chronic damage low. isn‚Äôt experimental treatment. That‚Äôs anti-vaxx propaganda. ‚ÄúOver‚Äù sense that, like said, measures put place keep hospitals overrun, completely prevent illness/deaths. We‚Äôre likely never getting point zero deaths/infections, especially considering amount immunocompromised people.

It also less 1000 people, hell lot better even months ago. White evangelical Conservatives African Americans two groups vaccine-skeptical. Alabama lot demographic groups. mainly meant in-person class experience living dorm. sounds pretty selfish, something americans incredibly good crematoriums already overloaded... hospitals overloaded... yet expect testing stuff?

It‚Äôs democracy owes constituents. 

Meanwhile, EU slow inefficient, fallen way behind UK, undoubtedly cost lives many Europeans. British must thankful Brexit point. older people mostly fully vaccinated reality far off.

I've seen working movie theatre near stop selling food needed enforce mask mandates. government till fence whether restaurants takeout only/outside/inside distancing/no restrictions. reality live in. heard thing, actually anything conclusive yet. far know right now, natural immunity good vaccine boys tho? sounds like think American military Requiring masks fully open. way unfit? diagnosed condition?

Oh well.  compare think deaths US 100% reported? excess deaths YOY comparison shows Covid deaths countries undercounted.

Sure - might undercounting deaths India much US. even 2x 3x deaths - per capital death rate India much less US Western European nations. No, [there difference droplet airborne transmission.

I'd love see poll reference. look share thread, maybe would like review these:

*  * poll conducted across 11,000 interviews. Funnily enough, shows higher percentage white folks (15%) Black folks (10%) saying they'd refuse vaccine.
  * Given 5.69 times white folks Black folks country, think much, much significant problem 15% white folks get vaccine, compared 10% Black folks.
   * similar calculation done Black folks vs. Republicans. Given 26% country identifies Republican, versus 13.4% country Black, even percentage vaccine resistance groups, would twice bad country overall re: Republicans taking vaccine compared Black folks (thinking total numbers).
* [http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NPR\_PBS-NewsHour\_Marist-Poll\_USA-NOS-and-Tables\_202103091124.pdf#page=3](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_202103091124.pdf#page=3)
  * poll, like one it, shows higher levels white vaccine resistance Black (25% Black folks want vaccine, versus 25% white folks).
*  * one fun too. Here, see 61% Black folks saying they'll get vaccine, versus 56% Republicans. White folks 69% ""yes"" vaccine, Hispanics 70%.
  * Interesting side note: poll shows that, ethnic groups surveyed, Black folks group actually higher vaccine acceptance March 2021 May 2020.

Remember back February 2020 US called closing borders China restricting travel try contain mystery virus called racist xenophobic?

Good times.... strict restrictions Germany now? Michigan‚Äôs infection rate isn‚Äôt high receiving multiple covid exposure warnings elementary school.

We go park, camping, beach, outdoor locations don‚Äôt take grocery shopping places don‚Äôt need would previously come with. 

Kids aren‚Äôt likely get seriously sick that‚Äôs great I‚Äôm going expose that. still trying best safe possible vaccine approved kids 12.  spread virus wearing mask around others, chance new variants mutate, everyone else‚Äôs vaccine made redundant.

So wear masks around others meet indoor settings outdoor crowds herd immunity reached, virus low enough rate. you‚Äôre outside meeting people don‚Äôt wear mask long you‚Äôre getting other‚Äôs faces. 

Your points flu valid flu completely different virus.

The biggest thing preventing end pandemic strict enforcing IP law vaccine formulas. third world favour IP law relaxed, manufacture generic vaccines end pandemic globally. Western governments decided important shareholders pharmaceutical companies make profits vaccines preventing new variants ending pandemic. Yes, wear mask indoor restaurant fully vaccinated.

No one this. Maybe wear mask way restaurant way seated, mask flying second sit down. one eating drinking inside restaurant mask on. mutations Take indian - India's problem also enough vaccines. We're 3-4 million vaccinations day, population 1 billion. rate declining due shortages vaccines.
Do math, rate gonna take long time get significant percentage population vaccinated. Meaning even current wave subsides, may well waves Oh, I‚Äôve seen one before! can‚Äôt stop citizens returning. Indians aren‚Äôt fleeing either. people coming US either pressing business needs family ties.

Anyone landing US test result.

There‚Äôs risk undetected infectious people coming in. think test incoming people independently quarantine days.

My dad passed away last year mom alone. vaccinated plans travel US. test boarding quarantine hotel comes home. odd thing MN #2 percentage vaccine acquired actually injected. wonder MN middle pack numbers. Well Lonza also strugling lot getting enough personel already available production lines, know much realisticaly produce way. Good way continue spread virus East Germany? Thatchoo? science says COVID around forever people vaccinated. politicians admitting defeat claiming victory usual.  preschools require kids age 2. really parental decision point.

And kid home preschool, highly doubt they're wearing mask home ""all day."" wife, daughter (19), fully vaccinated. got really sick recently (covid symptoms) 9-14 days tested negative numerous times rapid tests PCR tests, multiple days throughout duration illness. think they‚Äôre variants evade testing now. really bad colds. seems lot going around now. Covid/cold symptoms test negative.  thinking yesterday seems everything lining huge 4th July party America. Biden even hinted ""small gatherings"" comment months ago know Biden admin super conservative estimates. 

Then saw NYC planning fully reopen July 1st.

It‚Äôs surprising two people contracted covid variants considering vaccines don‚Äôt provide perfect coverage. wouldn‚Äôt consider study strong evidence vaccinated individuals high risk variants. think anyone uses reasoning justify continuing current measures covid non-issue allowed anywhere near public policy.  clearly satire think anyone reading way. Ah, oral penicillin. bad, somehow interpreted injection. makes sense -- sorry hear that, fingers crossed get go-ahead doctor! Stay safe :) UK using ton AZ, evidence AZ even effective first dose.  stance consistent, thank you. Flu vacine, corona didnt any.

I guess corona normal ""flu"" Virus, every year take shot.

Until real Flu Virus evolve, new strain appear dont protection against... booommmm goodbye corona, hellow flu again.. What? airborne?? come one told us!! something keep eye on, thing virus able run billion people going lot opportunity something vaccine resistant arise. Also question possible refugee crisis variants moving undetected SE Asia China result.  Personally, i'm still sticking outdoor activities indoor stuff Fall. I'm worried dumb antivaxxers visiting state city huge tourist destination say oecd random.

No, cherry-picked. deleted yet, already said somewhere German taxes include many benefits kickbacks get US taxes. would care stuff past?

You tell serious, somebody smoking poisoning people absolutely innocent? somebody gets robbed, shot whatever street fault going outside first place? There's good reason countries perfectly functioning smoking laws, Germany one them. Typical German reaction.

Typical American hysteria zealotry. Someone would need smoke several packs day right face weeks _any_ effect whatsoever health, someone else drink somewhere effect all. Plus, German smoking laws functioning perfectly well, meaning: intended, restricting smoking public venues designated smoking audience. would need bow drug user's preference smoke outside?

Because perfectly legal none damn business, personal desire prohibition nonwithstanding, one lights cigarette next hypothetical ""pregnant woman"", ever. Germany. Look Netherlands, Switzerland, Australia. Lower taxes (or social contributions), works fine.

I never claimed Germany best system world-wide, elephant room US pretty much none work fine all, afford pay exploitative medical fees. Again, combine low social security high poverty rates, inevitably get crime, violence, suffering, homelessness... really think things considered, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland Australia way better matter.

Lastly, since lot comments already deleted topic, I'll leave that, we'll probably agree disagree here. might want call I'm guessing supposed happen somewhere else. I'm boat. I'm sure got downvoted, giving reason getting vaccine hurts others. Explaining harder I'd expected here's shot:

A small number vaccinated people found within group infected people. That's know article. math know fraction *of particular infected group* vaccinated.  1/1000.

BUT - know many vaccinated people total - infected not.  also know many total group vaccinated people infected.  

To figure percent vaccinated people infected we'd need divide total number infected people vaccinated total number vaccinated people either figures. 

This might easier pictures. coffee. expect help try. diagnosed cases? I'm pretty sure I've flu, never gone doctor it. still potentially carry transmit others, still good reducing spread. We're still point nationally terms percent positivity vaccinated % would safe roll back mask mandates, we're getting closer vax rates increase. think get 60+% vaxxed national level, we'll golden zone follow trajectory UK Israel did.

August 22nd reopening Boston plain unacceptable. one wants give SECOND ENTIRE summer. 10 days 2nd shot

Am considered full vaxxed wait full 2 weeks? Vaccines negate need lockdowns, vulnerable people simply shelter place vaccinated.

&amp;#x200B;

Most people go normal lives. Yeah mean guess could walk around wearing hockey pads case someone throws baseball something...  brother (26) supposed get vaccine week, appointment Tuesday, tested positive Monday. 

Ffs close, partner hesitant get it, finally convinced (last people family get yet) get positive.

Stupid decisions around could prevented this. measures governments implemented work collateral damage terms deaths missed screenings, delayed surgeries, poverty, loneliness, despair far outweighs number people 

Which province that?  headline incredibly grossly misleading. German ""Verfassungsschutz"" (literally translated ""constitution-protection"" guess) putting radical people surveillance pose legitimate threat security democratic process, denying corona virus.

Some individuals using so-called ""Querdenkerbewegung"" (alternative thinkers movement? idk) dogwhistle fly radar. Germany persecuted, prosecuted surveiled simply denying existance covid.  constant testing see much spreading? really masks make difference that's people doing, would've made company suppress it, bc know sent people home mentioned feeling well, safe

Employers keeping hush-hush everywhere even countries handled well. Yeah sure, I'm fully vaccinated tomorrow. Can't wait hang vaccinated friends saturday cookout. UK prioritising first doses, stretching gap doses 12 weeks. Yes, won‚Äôt convinced. options? better use resources make impact.

Edit add: wouldn‚Äôt even shame calling poor, stupid people. informed, perhaps mislead politics anti-vaxxers, it‚Äôs choice. going believe want act accordingly. 

If outreach made them, continue refuse, keep banging head wall? Okay, ask: obtain point reference? got covid beginning april. luckily symptoms gone, still fighting distorted sense smell comes goes. sometimes things smell like burned carbon/rubber. sometimes not. Plus still lingering cough yea, virus nasty one. Sputnik V Sinopharm/Sinovac aren‚Äôt yet approved SAHPRA. government simply going start negotiating view building ‚Äúvaccine arsenal‚Äù. honestly probably good idea, Pfizer‚Äôs (ultimately retracted) 11th hour attempt get us put sovereign assets collateral opened eyes much (or little) Big Pharma even developed world think middle-income developing countries. Ultimately, negotiated way that, shown difficult even middle-income countries fully willing pay whatever order get manufacturers put pen paper. reason, can‚Äôt simply sign contract everybody else, already includes no-fault compensation clause. Demands changes additions always come last minute. 

The two approved vaccines SA present Pfizer J&amp;J - we‚Äôve concluded contracts allow us fully vaccinate 45m people. Actual fulfilment contracts delivery vaccines (and probably inevitably be, countries) main issue - even finish fill J&amp;J rate sufficient produce dose every South African adult 2-3 months. However, produce final product quickly receive liquid formulation Europe. 

We also don‚Äôt know many vaccines ultimately end needing. Citizens, foreign nationals within SA, refugees, asylum seekers, undocumented individuals - meet eligibility requirements phase want vaccinated, entitled receive vaccine man woman next you. $20 says late. Yo! Fellow Angelino! [check Twitter post walk ins County run sites. think depends ventilation warehouse. poor ventilation, Covid could spread easily.  Spain people know don‚Äôt want get vaccine Americans.

Why France anti-vaccine?

I saw 80s 100% vaccinations probably woods tbh, impossible side effects either Exactly, people consider ""threats"" opinions disagree easy debunk far-right theories anti-vaxx shit.

These people believing stating putting anyone immenent danger unless directing inciting threats someone. saying next pandemic megaflu really matter long takes FDA approve it.

They're generally arguing good faith. soon full approval comes, they'll make arguments like this:

It's either years (which historically taken vaccines go development, testing, submission, approval)...

Or, takes less years, FDA must skipping steps full approval can't trusted. No, haven't. We've 30 years study make mRNA vaccines work, even longer adenovirus, attenuated, live virus vaccines. know COVID causes stress body via heart, brain, lungs, blood, organs, inflammatory systems. None COVID complications mentioned observed people get vaccine, least ones vaccinated COVID-free.

So take anti-vax nonsense elsewhere. Also, don‚Äôt live NYC. Things aren‚Äôt going fully open July 1, post indicates. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôre concerned masking.

Masks required indoors here, everybody wears them. thing brought post r/AskNYC discussing OUTDOOR mask wearing vaccinated people, given new CDC recommendations. Good thing people believe also know globe. wraps ftw37 think

I‚Äôm gonna stop right there. got second pfizer dose ~26 hours ago. moderate side effects, seem mostly them. woods still chance major side effects? Awesome thanks. real world studies prove effectiveness refer to? also depends distribution vaccinated individuals. even hit 70% total population, uniformly distributed. pockets higher lower 70%, areas higher risk localized outbreaks others. Welp, international travel returning back normal while. take genius notice fluctuations often line weekend... le sigh shouldn‚Äôt though. pandemic ongoing, continued testing critical understanding extent it. It‚Äôs one many reasons support passports. Make people aren‚Äôt vaccinated test often access activities good information bad spread among unvaccinated. Better focus people wants it, that's case.

That's true. They're completely different technologies lol. live vaccine different risks adenovirus vaccine, example. already seeing issues AZ J+J seem risks Covid vaccines there. 

Look, got Pfizer jab happy so. someone completely healthy risk factors, threat Covid almost 0. perceives new vaccine technology risk without full FDA approval greater risk virus 99.7% survival rate. illogical think way. 

There papers written Covid theoretical risks mRNA. EVERY vaccine theoretical risks tested-long term. ludicrous say otherwise. 

Check article Nature 2018. Read Safety section Therapeutic considerations part. Theoretical risks, admittedly. agree choice, understand he's acting way.

Because difficulty conducting real world studies masks, isn‚Äôt much real world evidence mask effectiveness, people relied modeling, meta-data (like cdc comparison), lab studies measure effectiveness masking mask mandates, show masks (especially n95s high quality masks) effective blocking droplets.

Not sure agree great news. probably nearing ballpark. Total national protection definitely north 60%. hovering close! 1%! I'm guessing hope next round vaccinations clinch it. far neither Cuomo BDB done announcements shall see lack actual travel restrictions admins since beginning pandemic pretty puzzling. understand limiting domestic travel difficult, international travel even thing right now? aren‚Äôt follow science. Since day one CDC messaging administrations scare people staying inside germs spread faster get less sunlight exercise. way maximize health all, especially many vaccinated continue so. welfare unvaccinated come rights. That‚Äôs flat false. unvaccinated wear mask want hang others vaccinated home. risk legitimately zero cases. 30-35% range makes lot sense me. Thanks input. Even true, wouldn‚Äôt mind much. Turn Covid basic cold upper respiratory? live that. shame small territory there's little written it. I've trying read more, surprisingly wariness still hangs Gibraltar, displayed recent pilot test soccer game boxing match. Worried events could lead fresh cases, authorities required attendees tested before, demonstrate vaccinated get tested 10 days event.¬†

And get tonnes people saying maskless, 100% capacity events entry restrictions perfectly okay now. You‚Äôre focusing wrong thing say sample size. sample size actual found infections different amount people actually tested. Pfizer tested 40k, sample size infections showed 8 vaccinated group 162 placebo. larger signal Israeli finding, controlled study obviously, don‚Äôt know one could look findings say compelling call insignificant (I say conclusive). side effects‚ÄîI basically felt like sick (low fever, body aches) starting 8 hours shot lasting little day. pretty mild, took OTC meds got rough. sore arm lasted 48 hours shots.

Apparently people COVID report worse side effects first shot. first shot bit worse second, maybe asymptomatic COVID point. Dude people spewing left right act super righteous saying keep masks even outside vaccinated protect others (and look others don‚Äôt same). need get internet. Cases rising fast. county Tacoma located already roll back restaurant openings it‚Äôll probably happen county Seattle located next. thing happening Oregon Love attributing causation evidence. lack degree act like exist? literally cherry picking make point.

That's great, company eating insurance premium increase probably lot valuable. Idk much increase is, time least likely save much $100.

If benefits vaccine wasnt driving factor situation, hands that'd motivation.

My guess common antivaxxers (and antimaskers) see big picture beyond themselves, they'll see ""even get vaccine, can't guarantee others will, bother"" (sounds lot like, ""if get vaccine still wear mask"" everyone did, wear anymore) one thinking means incentivize them. Unfortunately seems like getting stuck mentality (at least premiums side). ya $100 time individual based idk... mean also could setting bar ‚Äúlow‚Äù say guess what, we‚Äôre opening June 1st instead! May wishful thinking knows? It‚Äôs interesting people willing believe 5G theories time discount climate change causing migration animals contact humans spread new viruses. saying that‚Äôs definitely cause, seems lot plausible. also likely Israel less half number previous infections per capita compared US. going deaths per capita US may 3x cases per capita Israel. shame happened, going allow US greatly reduce spread lower number vaccinated individuals. curious, vaccinated?

INDIANAPOLIS ‚Äî blue card sat windshield Josh Woolvin's black Hyundai Tucson Tuesday, spot color sunshine Indianapolis Motor Speedway. signaled nurses drive-by immunization clinic Woolvin mother, Debbie Shipp, wanted Johnson &amp; Johnson's single-dose coronavirus vaccine, choice, Pfizer-BioNTech's two-shot regimen.

Both selected Johnson &amp; Johnson one-and-done convenience, preference outweighed concerns extremely rare blood clots prompted 10-day pause use vaccine.
‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather deal side effects die‚Äù covid-19, Woolvin said.

There government data yet whether health authorities‚Äô 10-day halt administration Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine soured people product, company declined discuss matter. spot checks across country, people seeking vaccines officials dispensing appear eager resume using vaccine, also easier store transport.  Vaccines stop transmission sense condoms prevent pregnancy: typically do, vast majority cases, 100% people take additional precautions based risk factors. know sometimes people get breakthrough infections even vaccination, expect least somewhat infectious. message around levels safety change people get vaccinated. fully vaccinated person Israel lot safer fully vaccinated person India. It‚Äôs 90% first doses 95% second doses, 100% healthcare workers. many us here, read silence. never saw primary care doctor turned 40. kind knew high blood pressure, I'm overweight eat well, figured big deal. turn 40, like yeah gotta go get something I'm going asshole died heart attack 45 despite marathon runner. yes least Massachusetts though enforced even though socially enforced everyone wears No, one dose definitely adequate..the protection 94-95%? that's 2 doses, people still slip cracks die. (A small number get panties bunch!) one better nothing far safe. give little bit context meant ""how impacts others"".

In Germany, constitutional freedoms two things, right act freedom without interference government, also protection others enjoy freedom.

Each every governmental action exist within fight rights interferred government, right protection government.

In case speech, common protective element human dignity, right every person treated like human able participate equal society. Speech impact drastically narrative tries deny certain groups humanity are, do. directly denies humanity group right part society whole. duty Government mitigate, see necessity free speech demands shall impact said, speech directly harming rights others, again, mainly human dignity, right others overrites freedom speech.

This constant struggle freedom protection main core German constitutional, also governmental law (basically every governmental action kind consideration constitutional). state Tennessee 34% insane bad doing. I'm old man something hip/back. I'm chiropractor later. can't wait hear virus hoax vaccine going turn everyone lizard people. fact Russia China running disinformation campaigns around vaccines tell everything need know. India‚Äôs problem don‚Äôt enough vaccines. enormous vaccine production capabilities, haven‚Äôt rolled quickly enough.

Their problem ended restrictions far early deployed enough vaccines. point vaccines barely make near term dent virus spreading faster vaccines give immunity. Facebook cause lack critical thinking US, multiple cultural factors got country (and much western world) position. Facebook seems place lack critical thinking amplified. one single German congressman killed covid protestor last 1 1/2 years?

If one been, think could call surveillance ""too little late"".

I thought idea stop kind thing *before* happens. Every country running type risk scoring system citizens. FBI it. Hell every marketing data scientist does. common method identify populations look alike behaviors. 

The part makes good thing dependent used. Utilizing behavioral actions flag someone likely radicalized domestic terrorist fine. Utilizing chinas method basically morality score utilize private day day interactions problem

Hell youre credit score uses number past inputs determine credit risk used potential creditors determine want take chance you. Also assume 100%, 70% fully vaccinated, right? Take upvote instead. Normal life coming back fast us get vaccinated wonderful.

Not much maybe scared. free country made choice. know long-term effects virus. 100% children one study markers associated blood vessel damage. epidemics pandemics people massive complications years later. idea risk children ""they probably die need go school"" ridiculous. Why? equivalent saying since condoms necessarily 100% effective entirely abstinent avoid STD's/pregnancy *dare* folks go around sex even condoms never know could still get STD pass along next partner. Clearly depraved monster care anyone else. agree notion monitoring sure Canada quietly same. (IMHO Canada intelligence works interesting ways - quiet subtle intelligence. Let US allies spotlight. pervasive quite good intelligence methods Canada International Canadians passive enough aligned government views enough works). 

Here why. ALso topic damn fascinating me. 

I know guy - real dweeb guy. actually talked 3+ years he's 'friend' social media sons played top tier sports teams together times years. 

He's dad outwardly bad. refined enough tolerable came time hang beer games night nobody wanted around he's slimy guy comes across snobby know he's everything angle son better playing time. He's helping coaches he's team gopher he's suckass. 

Yes he's 'normal enough' people friend FB we're team. since he's gotten team support staff tolerate bit want to. 

Nobody would ever hang though. would... shallow selfish guy angling non stop. 

Owns business seems successful. money. 'above middle class' lifestyle belongs private golf club. he's *dumb* - intelligent enough guy talk to. guess point went 'normal enough dweeb batshit deranged mental case 5 months. Descent madness. 

Last Spring started posting anti-lockdown stuff. raging lunatic stuff 'I'm trying run business' type news videos.  understand (but I'm lockdowns time one I'm digress...) since he's business owner livelihood threatened.  around October last year FB feed started going bit odd. talking lot US election using lot 'we' talk like group. batshit crazy time US election news (won't name him) scene politics nuts everyone talked praying get re-elected. 

Except - started need make sure world taken (them was.... anyone 'the guy). 

Then election rails fell off. starts posting videos links 'news' (which wingnuts pretending experts, experts actual wingnuts) Bill Gates committning Genocide vaccine going kill billions. 

Wierd shit he's posting like videos 'journalists' uncovering 'facts' millions children locked shipping containers sent overseas Hillary Clinton. 

In time Jan 6th posting several videos per day 'we need take america back' crap (and remember... he's born raised Canadian... nothing reall ). one quite interesting video calling military take over. 

Then bullshit ballot recounts lawsuits posted 'we win lawsuits'.  Etc etc. need new US currency need military take free elections again. 

Oh ya earth flat. 

FUnny thing 500 FB friends - nobody actually intervened even commented wierd shit. People basically watching descent madness real time social media giving shit guy. He's dweeb. 

But study situation lately he's starting likes posts - generally - white guys aged 40-60. he's turned anti-trudeau theme. 

So started reporting stories FB profile - takes click figured they'd remove maybe kick off. video forwards influence even 1 2 500 'friends' that's bad. 

But FB ignores situation he's still spewing stuff every day. 

So flat earther Q-spewing, (dork) obsessed 'take back US costs including war' antivaxxer, covid denying CANADIAN. 

And frankly guy's gone fucking nuts. care guy irrelevant I'm actually going engage guy. would like hear dinner time conversations wife seems intelligent likely follow path, teenage kids house too.

This bit mental hurdle many people. absolutely trust doctors/scientists know best them. able attach ""low"" possibility unforeseen side effects. certainly able say said side effects would less problematic getting COVID.

Some however really difficult time coming conclusions. gladly take **known** quantity COVID. chances getting COVID, potential long COVID, etc. risk far lower **unknown**.

Because Reddit feel like state I'm fully vaccinated, know good amount people simply put significant weight fear unknown. would ever live USA Germany go back to? Pretty much we‚Äôve done entire pandemic America. 1/2 population takes virus seriously half lives like it‚Äôs normal times. 

Except India heavily populated, poor, unsanitary, healthcare system bad. Recipe catastrophe. miss shows you!! want get back work worst way‚Ä¶.see soon. I‚Äôm PA honestly surprised too. seemed like phase 1A taking forever wasn‚Äôt well organized outside Philly, Pittsburgh suburbs PA counties pretty deep [primary color banned mods].

## Abstract

### Background

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged coronavirus causative agent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. COVID-19 humans characterized wide range symptoms range asymptomatic mild severe illness including death. SARS-CoV-2 highly contagious transmitted via oral‚Äìnasal route droplets aerosols, contact contaminated fomites. House flies known transmit bacterial, parasitic viral diseases humans animals mechanical vectors. Previous studies shown house flies mechanically transmit coronaviruses, turkey coronavirus; however, house fly‚Äôs role SARS-CoV-2 transmission yet explored. goal work investigate potential house flies mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2. purpose, determined whether house flies acquire SARS-CoV-2, harbor live virus mechanically transmit virus naive substrates surfaces.

### Methods

Two independent studies performed address study objectives. first study, house flies tested infectivity exposure SARS-CoV-2-spiked medium milk. second study, environmental samples tested infectivity contact SARS-CoV-2-exposed flies. studies, samples collected various time points post-exposure evaluated SARS-CoV-2-specific RT-qPCR virus isolation.

### Results

All flies exposed SARS-CoV-2-spiked media milk substrates positive viral RNA 4¬†h 24¬†h post-exposure. Infectious virus isolated flies exposed virus-spiked milk exposed virus-spiked medium. Moreover, viral RNA detected environmental samples contact SARS-CoV-2 exposed flies, although infectious virus recovered samples.

### Conclusions

Under laboratory conditions, house flies acquired harbored infectious SARS-CoV-2 24¬†h post-exposure. addition, house flies able mechanically transmit SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA surrounding environment 24¬†h post-exposure. studies warranted determine house fly transmission occurs naturally potential public health implications events.   Sure, go that, I'll go enjoy life. Yep, Portland rolled back indoor dining. Also much greater access gators, pensioners heatstroke :) Virginia‚Äôs chugging along full Broadway show like Cats Phantom, show full technical check first, rigging need checked used year, sound video would next check equipment working such. Set designers would next need go sets props make sure storage damage taken care everything clean. 

Let‚Äôs assume entire cast crew still available industry, many left. need get back speed rehearsals weeks. need restart process take longer. 

Every show goes ‚Äúpreviews‚Äù basically live rehearsals, almost ready show still tweaking things. take week..

Most industry people agree large shows need 45-60 days get speed. lot money.

Source: live events video engineer experience Broadway.  Better quarantining everyone coming India. Sure. Geordi grew different age....Surely noticed. mean thinks sooner that? poorly worded comment. [So like address claim GPs get 20 doses per week near future. local school district announced discontinuing basically COVID mitigation measures next school year (including virtual schooling). 5+ can't get vaccinated next year, know I'm going Yes, drugs good country good. Right? Logic nobody‚Äôs surprise, states higher vaccination rates mirrors blue electoral map. statement incorrect, unless suggested something mean to. suggesting sample size 41 sample, 4/41 vs 37/41, correct. sample size measured test COVID PCR tests (which fair stated article) particular potential exposure variant India. bring 'insignificance' extent, use clinical significance CI, which, case sample size inadequate, large whatsmore think using term 'signifiance' loosely rather usual way use clinical significance (often aiming p&lt;0.05) (please correct fact suggesting think clinically significant). Also, odd reason, decided bring ""wait till see size signal used Pfizer study applying emergency use"" nothing article.

Adequate sample sizes work things including desired power study, population size, variance etc. can't pluck number say ""this do, that's enough draw significant conclusion from"". really good example seen erroneous assumption hydroxychloroquine great efficacy COVID. thank CDC media think would need specific case argue details, but: correct way openly question validity lies hatred people hear see arguements it. 

That's exactly happens. Covid deniers, Reichsb√ºrger, Pegida... get demonstrations officially approved even police protection. mean intelligence service protection constitution can't eye people give lot room suspicion oppose basic democratic order country.  

A general statement regarding freedom speech: right absolute (nowhere) ends rights others begin. That's also case freedom speech. Good know. US think would take long develop system time done necessary. wanted vaccine passports time start work like October. confirm. German ex used call ""chef"" sometimes always gave tiny ego boost guess becomes obvious vaccines suck barely work all. 55% efficacy pretty much barely functioning.  Ich wollte damit meinen Unmut dar√ºber kundtun, dass eine Gruppe mit ""quer"", dem deutschen Equivalent zum englischen ""queer"", nicht f√ºr sondern gegen LGBT+ Rechte ist. Yes, also decades-long lack investment public health care. US far surpassed India's current per capita disease levels winter, able adequately care sick. new data reinfection rates people already Covid? feel like even get super high percentage vaccine uptake, virus eventually infect enough people get us herd immunity. Yeah, people die unnecessarily (their fault point), may risk new variants, far every new variant beatable current vaccines, new boosters always development. feel like worries vaccine-hesitant overblown. Get jab, get back normal, open ASAP. read German. used manage wife's Ob/Gyn practice. would phone working nights contact 20 people eligible vaccination. That's GP Thursday even though got supply Wednesday. took staff couple days line people Thursday. 

We also keep mind lot Germans turning AZ vaccine. woke 30 mins ago ( I‚Äôm LA) started getting chills exactly 4:30 am, got shot 4:25 PM. Exactly 12 hours. 

And body feels heavy kind hard explain. I‚Äôve ran 5 full marathons I‚Äôm usually good next day. one putting commission. 

**still worth though** LOL.  Yeah. high level infection, ready relatively high level vaccine escape. Easily avoidable waiting bit longer. Otherwise, risk people‚Äôs lives provide fodder anti-vaxx crowd. 

Also grounds stronger mutation overcomes vaccine. we‚Äôre trouble. 

Hoping get better data B1617/B1618 soon, it‚Äôs strange nothing detailed come yet. How, exactly, benefited test &amp; trace despite billions we've spent it? We've created supply constraints types tests... still take weeks get back routine test results. tell us anything can't already know diagnosis health professional based symptoms.

There's benefit testing healthy / asymptomatic people. CT dumping restrictions except masking May 19. ‚Äúfully reopen ‚Äú August 1st, however indoor mask mandate remains time. sure way NY going this... upvote. Fuck em! must really hate healthcare. virus much collapse healthcare system. get sick India need medical care, they're trouble. Yup, agreed! origins many things ‚Äì washing hands, showering, wearing clothes even- rooted preventing deaths/ preventing injury/ disease. It‚Äôs new, devil plain sight.

I mean, there's also evidence opposite provided. (That skipping second shot impact length pandemic skipping chance lengthening pandemic)

 read many posts know biggest fan AZ vaccine strategy UK shines quite brightly messages. fair cover topic course, what's reddit please let's try little impartial here

I've read almost every thread topic various subreddits, social media etc . Generally speaking people claiming dose 2 ""totally safe"". oft-repeated claim really elsewhere. consensus crowd. best knowledge regulatory body government official claimed either.

The oft made claim made charitable one context- incidence VITT observed connection second doses (to date) ( time writing) less common post first dose incidence- was, still *is* backed evidence. Anyone made statements lying, they're reporting reflection statistics. 

 incidence changes based vaccinating younger cohorts second doses, lagging reporting etc that's fine, guidance reflect that- what's shown yet, naturally right claim risk post second dose confirmed identical risk post first dose. 4 cases 4.4M per second dose well within background incidence notably lower equivalent post first dose development reported. incredibly frustrating many women reporting issues periods vaccines, issue hijacked antivaxxers shun people vaccinated crazy warping women said absolute falsehood one else's vaccine could interfere another person's period. preying lack knowledge vaccine works lack knowledge periods work certain groups people. also likely derail legitimate concerns women menstrual cycles.

Like british author quack archaeology theories annoys end Rogan‚Äôs viewers treat like god appearing show they‚Äôll believe whatever he‚Äôs said cause shit sounds cool you‚Äôre stoned. going right, there's legitimate excuse way verify going extreme right shit. used 100+ years history it. We've exploiting migrants years, border wall shit? know work, saw uptick tunnels fence jumping put xray roads. Gee, saw coming. top that, massive amount factories companies sides higher illegals.

Dems would rather get legalized, think doesn't? Cause unclaimed tax money goes somewhere. think goes? God damn people, sides fuck ears mind bad ever able think get ears. take time look gatherings happening March early April? Even good ol'e regular covid, would've seen great increase. We're talking millions people close quarters little PPE seen... going deep end asses People take medical advice Fauci beyond help going really want pandemic go another year, huh?   going going Hahahaha get fucked idiot. literally evidence claim. vast insecurities. Talk don‚Äôt pull quote Onion citzens. org. going Meant Wallensky: Dr. Rochelle Wallensky, CDC director.

Thanks good catch! edited. It‚Äôs ridiculous people look forward seeing relatives. didn‚Äôt get chance great grandma covid. going Oof hate bots like shit? Fuck hate country. Thats ok keep going major cause country almost willfully everything power spread virus. Indian variant high chances breaking vaccine protection 10% country vaccination-related protection AFAIK sub turned optimists; anyone expressing caution concern gets crucified, people applauded baseless claims like ‚Äúkids don‚Äôt get sick.‚Äù 

I wasn‚Äôt even eligible first dose til week ago but, according sub, everyone US vaccinated, pandemic over. Lmfao turned shit day moved TX, I've left entirely gotten back hours hours life actually read! funny people like praise Bill Burr ""nuance"" fail apply nuance real world situations. stupid rules encouraging eating drinking lol. thought choose wearing uncomfortable mask throwing back drinks event ridiculous, made throw food might need too?  Joe ‚Äújust smoke DMT problems solved‚Äù Rogan we're gonna taking boosters every 6 months ends eating week life time conversations becomes pretty salient..  Rogan thought Rousey would beat Mayweather boxing match, people start taking word gospel? study garbage. MEDIAN amount time people tracked 3.25 months.

In words, half data people 3.25 months less first infection, including little 2 weeks first positive test.

This show headline says 7 months.

If want better study, 80% protection 6 months young, healthy [It's WAY effective that. 94% reduction asymptomatic spread, 97% reduction severe importantly, ""you still wear mask getting vaccinated"" crowd causing people drag feet getting shot explains reduced weekly vaccine numbers seen across country.  tried google searching seems like stuff says 22-25 gauge. think higher number, thinner is. experience 22 gauge relatively small painless, comes luck technique size needle. would normally use huge one (18 gauge) draw medication, makes faster draw medication easier avoid air bubbles, switch smaller needle.

i give leg injections first time pain bleeding, every time i've pain, bleeding, soreness, etc. pretty bad though, motor coordination issues medical training. pharmacist whomever hopefully know make fast relatively painless, entirely painless. Well still spread vaccine what‚Äôs point spend life researching documenting thing dumb ex wife got data settlement. Managing production staff skill too. Yep. Comparing Capitol riots BLM protests saying ""Look, thing!!""

And damn well know going people want comment ""they same"" comment too. say please refresh first amendment definitions insurrection. Fuck BJP. Joe Rogan admits know shit time people still believe follow lot says. Joe pretty often big idiot though. used listen Joe get great guests good interviewer. feel like nowadays guests lot less consistent way bigger ego. used least aware shortcomings, he's lot confident dumb opinions become unbearable.  duh, don‚Äôt need Fauci tell that.

Roe Jogan ‚Äúincorrect‚Äù lot things üôÑ work healthcare virtually everyone know (work personal life) gotten shots. 2 said felt arm soreness identical twins. study actually shocks greatly. vaccine works also work wear mask What's upsetting data says breakthrough infections vaccinated persons exceedingly rare vaccinated persons spreading virus.

So saying ""vaccinated people, go back normal. masks. social distancing."" vaccines either work don't. match experience sub. buried many times mentioning it. numbers all. consistently number 1 podcast Spotify. said...I lost respect LONG ago could get vaccine Joe Rogan Fear Factor? CDC guidelines literally say eating indoors safe vaccinated. Joe said opinion: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre healthy person you‚Äôre exercising time you‚Äôre young you‚Äôre eating well, don‚Äôt think need worry [getting vaccinated].‚Äù

Stupidity title post: Joe tell young people get vaccinated.

Stupidity statement: Joe give advice. Basically, idiotically gobbled OP‚Äôs lie wholesale. would rather see capacity ramp 100% monitoring cases way know outdoors masked reduces transmission quite bit. Vaccines also driving transmission big risk would year ago.

In San Diego (Go Friars!) socially distant sections vaccinated/negative test sections higher capacity. IMO good compromise build from. can‚Äôt wait get back Petco. also bit stick? 
These yokels need sense beat them! Uh, I'm sure word remotely inaccurate, health political authorities recommending vaccine method promoting public health, people saying intention to? word ""resistant"" anything accurate description that? Data comparing Covid survivors got vaccinated Covid survivors not? watched bill Bert podcast. Fuck love bill. awesome get medical advice Joe Rogan‚Ä¶‚Ä¶maybe don‚Äôt get vaccine. Probably best save someone worth it, bloodline probably continue anyway.  definitely seems like gets angry side come stage awesome outlet loving father I‚Äôm sure is. one mentioned cancelling Spotify...  Reminds warnings touching baby animals mother reject theyll die. Probably not, keeps kids messing baby rabbits corner yard. worst talking Capitol riots. Within couple minutes ""but got guys CNN shit!"" joking laughing whole part - don‚Äôt think serious all. going months counted 5 people wearing masks entire time, people enter on, immediately take 

Maybe that's cases control long. family members risk

Great news! 3 effective vaccines available, recommend seek one Glad went. Good ya he's effective interviewer break unspoken rules interviewing? Bar must low tbh claiming well informed see difference involvements Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Egypt, Israel, Middle Eastern countries? Yes act indignant someone suggest know enough yet.  assuming thing mutate something new together 

Which unlikely. New Mexico resident, I'm happy finally see positive encouraging news goals. restrictions discouraging beforehand negative opinions state's leadership I'll give credit credit due. Get vaccinated, fellow NM residents! wasn‚Äôt saying works, I‚Äôm even suggesting herd immunity. appeal *greed*. transactional... majority state wants wallow epidemia, that‚Äôs them.

If people literally dying won‚Äôt convince somebody, nothing will. might best move push forward progress expense people cutting hands spite faces. think first domino. 

It seemed one wanted first team dipped toes potentially backfire. Reeeeeee. don‚Äôt agree somebody shouldn‚Äôt allowed speak. Based info?  Sadly, stupid people everyone‚Äôs problem.

You wear mask regardless.

Case point. yell going country 331 million people, live high density areas come contact other.


Then, tell how, scenario, people contact other. people going eat, heat/air-conditioning, water, etc...?

Are things people need survive going appear? 38 yo woman always astound shock-jock entertainer convinced people anything but. guy making fart jokes spins Nirvana Post Malone Morning Commute. INSTEAD convinced bunch wannabe intellectuals lazy acquire actual knowledge done work trust him. It‚Äôs grotesque. polite manners respect Joe Rogan fans, listeners, defenders, equivocators general categories Douche. 

Every day curse moral code prevents scamming listeners, too. claimed 50% population antibodies previous infections, natural infection high protection rate makes almost 60% protected (50% previous infection + 10% vaccine). country 60% protection Israel, almost 0 death right here. hope large gathering 50% antibody rate near truth, reasons way scarier. think funny jokes, overall sets never great. think many people said nobody gets immunity infection. I've almost daily since start pandemic, seem like something many people argued. 

Lots people argued might last long might protect everybody. J&amp;J jab costs 300% AZ one

Until July so. AZ allowed profit vaccine sales. Rogan candice Owens need go live weird little lives public eye. Take Tomi them. wish Murphy would kind metric- metric. 

I think people weren‚Äôt gonna get vaccinated might there‚Äôs kind end sight. 

As we‚Äôre ambling along whims, rhyme reason. Where‚Äôs clip? Pull shit Jamie. I'm speaking reality, CDC guidelines show. official number around 8-10% total infected COVID US, CDC estimates 25-40% total infected COVID. fact get one single cold/cough/sniffle winter reason enough remain masked public foreseeable future. remind vaccine modify human DNA, viruses actually do.  Firstly, 0 proof masks anything disappearing flu, Covid measures matter. baseless conjecture. 

You guys ones need proof. us saying flu exist year ""Twindemic!"" talk bullshit. 7 months later exact thing predicted happened (no flu) idiots try explain 'Why' based nothing.

GTFOH.


Flu masks work masks even stop Osterholm podcast around 16:40 explaining viral interference "" people try delegitimize state institutions. "" 
So basically saying government forever always 100% correct never wrong topic? Fuck bjp. Fuck Modi fuck Ajay PISHT think folks it‚Äôs balance risks. encourage folks want wait longer make difference, many families really difficult apart long particularly older family members don‚Äôt much time left. members get vaccinated vaccinated, remaining member child zero underlying conditions, total risk involved incredibly low. isn‚Äôt case story, child underlying conditions, people case described hold ill regard I've cut little opening mask straw fits through. grind food point pass straw. Restaurants little confused ask extension cord plug blender into, working okay. people make stories really... Michigan going good now. Loss taste smell widely discussed. think symptom food smelling tasting really bad has. Brazil seems trying catch USA Bump!! BTW, another big distinction German numbers countries report percentage vaccinated people includes entire population 18+. Adjusted 18+ percentage closer roughly 31.5% That's CDC guidelines show? exhausting isn‚Äôt it? get people like complain, constant pessimism face data shows acceleration supply delivery make us optimistic! Yeah I'm Denmark can't go. Expected. makes sense. Totally agree. looking like it'll way Texas least. COVID may still around, anyone wants vaccine one then, it'll end far people concerned. many people even go doctor. Well Pfizer would able file early April Moderna hit 6 month mark today. 

Pfizer expects decision H2 2021. word Moderna. dog get paid dogecoin. Fuck bjp. hate trying keep alive!!

???? go inside food already mask. also logistics issues. People travel frequently work steady hours can't guarantee they'll available second appointment. Ihave friend even know state he'll month, example. Intelligence putting unintelligent surveillance Gibraltar interesting place. people travel recommend seeing incredible monkeys rock! accurately, minimized chance getting virus.   super interesting case study policy makers nationwide. least politically, Michigan fairly representative country (voted 1.5% right nation Trump November). Thus, start see MIs vaccination rate pull ahead national average next month so, think could reasonably confident vaccination-linked restriction metrics good policy.  imagine scenario would cause form explosion. announced people BMI 30 next priority group that's week worth shots (about 2M people) speed going now, need add soon.

I really see point micromanaging age groups either. older folks wanted vaccine got get soon (100% close circle), time move make sure everyone gets fast possible. Who? deaths 3x last summer!

Got proof? Hi, remove comment can't confirm actually healthcare worker -- message modmail want verify yourself! could america , always said can't make stupidity law half people countries would locked up. got ass handed Pfizer #2 last night. Shit lit 5/12 mean pandemic over, flu current infections it'll take long time, maybe years, become prevalent again? expect see spike right back like every year.  What?

What?

Airborne means spreads tiny droplets.

You contradict sentence sentence. Yeah haven‚Äôt tested mutations mRNA ones either. Good make dieting easier think anyone plans skip second shot, makes sense make sure everyone gets first shot starting work seconds, since efficacy good 3 weeks single dose. :-( Cool story. OP said kids preexisting conditions still afraid expose them. took mean they're healthy. 

So, I'm wondering OP comfortable now, be?  Yeah, studies say pandemic. Ya know past flu studies suggested ill people could wear mask want to. studies conflict strictness new studies done pandemic. ETA full approval? think doctor said keep calm waiting next chance find someone profound field consult with. yeah, even say consult guess right. allergy antibiotic pill containing small amount penicilin trouble brearhing got swollen, even lost conciusnes woke hospital, 3 years tested positive penicilin allergy ""I'm sorry I'm donating blood today. conversation think competent hold needle.""

Then bring supervisor worker/volunteer spreading vaccine disinformation. Politicization science never ended well, historically speaking Masks work 5G. Try phone. Good question, maybe someone specialist virology explain us. 

But interpretation, flu vacine, increase higiene, masks self isolation measures create greater barrier transmissability flu virus.

I might wrong.  experience symptoms shortly arriving Hawaii, therefore likely Covid traveling. also underlying health conditions. I'm already 8 days second dose. :) Good you, wear rest life want. Never show face public again. give shit wearing one. is. Thats response one normally gives know lost. Fantastic. guys getting vaccines independent EU? thought weren‚Äôt able get assistance government leave choice, I‚Äôm Canadian  I'm talking India specifically since situation really bad generally speaking 16 months seeing boyfriend would rather get covid wait more. rate, Northeast, West Coast, states, areas herd immunity. child underlying health conditions. realize need one travel they‚Äôll get it

Travel...where? huge amount Americans travel outside US heard domestic airlines saying accept vaccinated passengers either. would highly unusual -- I'd recommend chatting doctor, might got sick something else. west

Well happens India worried. absolutely evidence variant resistant vaccines, even was, total immune escape completely unrealistic! dumbass father using ‚Äúproof‚Äù hospitals faking covid numbers ‚Äúget money.‚Äù  


According him, cases covid actually people flu, there‚Äôs huge conspiracy. doesn‚Äôt want get vaccinated, covid overblown. exactly like quitting job time. Tell whoever charge coming back, leave. wearing mask walking jogging outside deserve viciously mocked. Yeah don‚Äôt think shut more. people need keep mind there‚Äôs still risk easy responsible things like masking high risk situations get vaccinated. Thanks letting know, I've removed comment.

Bet stance comes islamic terrorists, eh? vaccine center SC issues traffic flow, called CFA manager brought staff ran smoothly SOHN Good bad, imagine. know bunch people getting married year. reminds lot year following big Supreme Court ruling years back. well flights coming India hold hope going happen. periods zero local transmission either country Crazy imagine infectious COVID compared flu. vaccines perfect. provide 90% protection infection large community spread. everyone vaccine covid cant spread community spread vanishes. actual protection situation jumps essentially 100%. many German congressmen murdered covid protestors last 1 1/2 years? Netherlands: www.coronabeeld.nl - scroll bottom government official plan supposed start group 50-60 years May starred Monday already taking bookings oldest group. 

Norway: That‚Äôs true! got worst cold ever year. Panicked first. realized cold. Strange really... nothing people wearing masks double standards really irk amuse me. 

At start saying ‚Äúthe CDC says wear masks!‚Äù saw comment NYC sub someone said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll wait numbers indicate it‚Äôs safe.‚Äù *what!?* CDC lifting outdoor mask recommendations it‚Äôs safe!

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Iv talked nurses schools winter months almost daily occurrence kid sick, parents give meds hide fever send school end nurses office around 11-12. Slow vaccine rollout. Locked hard great cause small amount cases. However, means there's virtually herd immunity. They'll likely stay isolated World longer countries else become ""plague pit"" states also cases early on. current stains contagious. surprise, wife's family still live Mexico living partying whole time. surprised contract COVID earlier. now? considered means transmission something happen? course would happen Germany. Lol. makes sense person, every person every country. second shot appointment dodger stadium yesterday. Went closed game....gee great idea, stop vaccinating people f‚Äôing baseball game. pissed off. Hey, anyone insight weird disparity vaccination rates daily new case rates?

Looking covidactnow shows California state current lowest daily new case per 100,000 people rate 4.7, 1+ vaccinated rate 47.5%.

Meanwhile New Hampshire highest 1+ vaccinated rate 59.7%, daily new cases per 100k 22.6, five times higher California's. 

Is really due weather? warm enough crowd inside anymore Northeast? warning COVID destroyed medical system India, meaning medical emergency may receive care there's nothing US Embassy happens. deniers sense believe virus real, sense restrictions gone overboard?  true, know businesses schools legally mandate vaccine ""official"" full approval status. think military even mandating full approval, unless I'm mistaken. someone respect ask take provide facts big help. Like family doctor, pastor, community group leader, sports star, etc. really important point, feel. easy lump ""No's"" giant group stubborn Q acolytes, complicated group. certainly persuadable. can't physically make enough tests every day count every death. Let alone reach every infected person. interested see plays next winter."
