Denmark lower vax percentage restrictions. EVERYBODY get pension America? I've read sort comment never really thought it.

Pensions scam. company fund manager fund manager gives executives kickbacks return high management fees. Look GM essentially got rid much pension program restructuring.  Virtually public sector workers US get pension benefits.

This everywhere, like defined benefits common countries. phased 1970s/1980s, across developed world whole.

It's like everyone Australia UK defined benefit pension, almost one does. social security benefits lower US, although fixed previous income- everyone gets level. still understand hard. Fire them!!!!!!!!!  Traditional (defined benefit) pensions rare outside public service, throughout developed world. US-specific thing. started phased everywhere 1970s 1980s. know anyone outside public service defined benefit pension.

* Defined contribution = make contributions, get invested market, get whatever ends retire. know guaranteed is, market well come great. Risk retiree.
* Defined benefit = get X defined benefit retire, whatever happens. directly connected performance invested contributions, whatever happens get X benefits retirement. Risk pension issuer.

Traditional pensions latter, people get fixed sum retirement, often based terminal earnings. uncommon today.

This massively scaled back US even government employees, still ""Basic Benefit Plan"" basic level defined benefit (lower before).

It's defined benefit pension think he's referring ""pension""- TSA government employees, get special type pension private sector employees get.

But US. vast, vast majority non-government employees developed country defined benefit pensions employer, thing more. Defined contribution norm Australia example since introduction superannuation 1983, superannuation Australia overwhelmingly defined contribution.

US Social Security (the ""state pension"" equivalent) particularly low compared developed countries. around double UK pension, also higher Australia Age pension (which one highest outside average Social Security retiree benefit recipient see monthly payment $1,657 next year versus $1,565 2021, increase $92 per month. maximum benefit worker retiring ""full retirement age"" rise $197 month $3,345 $3,148.

* 2021 = $18,780
* 2022 = $19,884

Australia Age Pension:

* A$22,575 (single) = $16,691
* A$17,017 (couple) = $12,581

UK full basic State Pension ¬£137.60 per week.

* ¬£7,155/year = $9,789

One key issue US social security though linked actual prior earnings contributions, everyone gets same, people earned contributed get more. average worker well Social Security, compared Anglophone developed countries.

On top half Americans private pension (an IRA 401(k)). similar superannuation account Australia, compulsory.

The system US certainly ideal, major problems many older people tough. case across many developed countries well; fact look situation retirees US, probably pretty well developed country standards. Bear mind well US universal healthcare over-65s (Medicare). Gotta collect vaccines like Thanos collecting infinity stones.  people entitled work want take vaccine? asking Reddit lmao. Ask doc They‚Äôre union. can‚Äôt fire them. players also contracts. anti vax one bit, that‚Äôs reality always high excess deaths.

You can't always high excess deaths definition, excess deaths calculated relative country's normal death rate thus usually (in absence external shocks COVID 2010 summer heatwave) equal zero. read school obliges so. /s Yes, anti vax this.

Ahh yes old create problem sell solution. Virtually public sector workers US get pension benefits. Many even pension plans underfunded likely collapse someday.

Private sector workers basically get pensions today general rule especially new workers (there still private workers plan decades ago still today). today sign job there‚Äôs pension benefit, I‚Äôd bet 50:1 it‚Äôs government job.

Private employees get Social Security government plan. Benefits range (I‚Äôm hazarding here) maybe $600/mo $3900/mo depending much contributed retired.

Many private sector workers also access 401k plan allows one save $19,500 per year tax deferred kinds plans $57,000 even $63,000 per year types plans depending whether engage certain Roth IRA related loopholes. funded employee contributions sometimes employer matching contributions.

These accounts personal accounts aggregated accounts: account *your account* unlike pension funds. accounts market risk, pension fund demographic risk causing problems private pensions might ultimately doom social security program too.

Ever tried taking belt shoes toddler strapped chest? takes minutes. TSA agent verbally badgering like, ‚ÄúSir! need keep moving. Hurry up!‚Äù third time shouted crouched pulling shoe paused moment looked square eyes. didn‚Äôt say word. didn‚Äôt make face gesture. deadpan stare-down lasted 4 seconds. time I‚Äôd loaded stuff onto rollers, called security team make go ‚Äúthe box.‚Äù demanded unharness son give wife‚Äîwhich made cry wail‚Äîso could get full body pat-down. swabbed hands forearms (I‚Äôm assuming GSR?) made take sort half-assed field sobriety test. walked bags made stand unpacked every single item toddler‚Äôs diaper bag. enough diapers week along toiletries. visually checked diaper associated toiletries individually left everything messy pile metal table.

‚ÄúHave safe flight.‚Äù

We get everyone dressed, pack shit back up, re-harness toddler, sprint terminal. barely made flight. one TSA agent airport staff lifted finger help couple clearly struggling travel two small kids.

I don‚Äôt hate TSA agents general. They‚Äôre job. It‚Äôs fault it‚Äôs mainly security theater. ones abuse position feed authoritarian fantasies? Fuck. Them. No. US almost everybody gets social security. pension usually something government workers get. Private sector workers get tax advantaged investment accounts fund themselves. called 401k accounts. Social security lot live unless want retire low cost country. good, fuck TSA. 

their illusion keeping us safe profiling brown people disgusting. usa could really use less TSA. course always issue companies raiding pension fund stay afloat. 

The closest probably get pension matching funds.

My employer matches contributions 401k certain percent salary.  Edit: oops read post wrong. page No. mean good 5 years online $70, $14/yr. 

I far left I'm back guns good circle, I'm everyone fighting classist bullshit classist, unnecessary grift, class oppression thing. Dolt bolt. third shot first, then?  same. I'll ride next wave till kids get vaccinated. someone that's transgender, get harassed 100% time go airport. Always questions. Always humiliation.

Correct. lot people dont know multi-million dollar pervert x-ray machines literally require someone hit manual switch toggle male female mode software shit gender neutral. result every trans person assume probably intersex people butch lesbians get absolutely fucked braindead hog machine look appearance, decide button push, inevitably flag discrepancy get pulled aside molested hogs asked series incredibly invasive questions. TSA actually lowest scum planet, feel nothing joy thought 40% losing jobs.  fair TSA security theater anyway. could lose half workforce safety would probably impacted. wish separated like that. all, dental care health care. Lucky! got claws come hands crazy healing factor. know people either see /s  people actually liked Donald Trump thought right? Technically, second official group that‚Äôs investigating origin. first didn‚Äôt go well.   Totally thinking! impression advocating social progress NBA generally taken lead North America. cannot unpoliticalize , RIGHT PURPOSELY POLITICALIZED. one change minds , death will. force tyranny, people want ways. meantime suffer, variant variant. less less vaccination work , prove right. Fuck conservative agenda. Someone whose job description literally keep people safe place high priority getting vaccinated reduce possibility infecting people. would especially true anyone working close contact hundreds strangers every day.

Someone unwilling get vaccinated probably good fit job public safety. Well that's point. Percentages gives clearer picture. base numbers use sensationalize. saying thing. choose use different representations numbers attracts buzz  Singapore barely saw Covid cases throughout pandemic little natural immunity vaccines prevent infection much hospitalization comes Delta. combined high density city-state means sharper expected rise cases.  incredibly misinformed.  possible, remember study peer reviewed. China identified reported disease first Dec 2019 Jan 2020. time, 1.3% blood donanors 9 states US SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies US notice/report disease.

 China treated origin, outright unfair, would country reports new disease.  Ohhh noooo ever without TSA molesting us stealing toothpaste? üôÑ No, half Americans access work-based retirement plan.  It‚Äôs religious thing believes world ending soon. friends moved already. ig enjoy even need replacing?

No best minds work government... Especially TSA.  half Americans even access 401K  Yep. 

We supposed save retirement. Allowed $6000 year. good job let save another $19000. Crazy good job limit much save retirement fund?

""Social Security"" example, AARP calculator estimates person born Jan. 1, 1959, averaged $50,000 annual income would get monthly benefit $1,264 file Social Security 62, $1,785 full retirement age

Yep, old homeless people. Watch Nomadland.  millionth time, understand vaccine enters cells, that's point. point is, guy confidently tells vaccine entering cells reason vaccine bad believes vaccines work way. I'm pretending super knowledgeable stuff, least best efforts admit might wrong. guy hand cares winning argument, spews stuff read somewhere people believe complete refusal back anything give confident tone. That's makes frustrating, ""give inch, they'll take mile"" situation.  Thanks layout! Good see Moderna booster produces significantly higher antibodies prior J+J Pfizer recipients. Also, need TSA. literally done nothing past 15 years stop terrorist attack. inconvenienced Americans travels. mention huge waste taxpayer dollars. So, good? Eradication possible Delta, even 95% vaxxed.



R0 Delta high (between 7-8) VS ability vaccines prevent infection (around 70% waning time).

Like every respiratory virus, lasting sterile immunity, hence realistic possibility get rid it, sadly   beat it, though dumbed explanation far more. also mentioned fact RNA, RNA viruses, alter human DNA reverse transcriptase COVID-19 shown vivo. blanket statement ""RNA change DNA"" false. say vaccines do, COVID-19 vitro. really get people acting weird, get Tetanus shots, flu shots, measles mumps rubella (well us one anyway), TB shot without questioning them, oh going leave state shot deals nastier version flu? TSA literally useless anyways That‚Äôs crazy. main reason low vaccine rate?  vaccine cause immune system attack cells mRNA ""enters cells""

This exactly vaccine works. mRNA enters human cells, produce spike protein ribosomes, get integrated cell membrane attacked immune easy, know RNA can't change DNA

RNA change DNA reverse transcriptase. fact COVID-19 shown able alter human DNA way vivo demonstrated vitro.

The fact people, including you, barely know enough make informed decisions instead cherry pick information authority figures believe already want to.

I got third dose Moderna week masking N95s since February 2020. 5% woooo Shocker ask thing got J J. course is, cited dozens grandmas published twitter whatsapp. Definitely. Fire. Them. All. can't wait go work TSA &amp; get sweet TSA money &amp; union protection &amp; retirement benefits someone get tiny shot BILLIONS already received without incident. dont know chitty church/person says church encourage vaccinations since bitter year sitting outside mass. inside still wear masks matter what. 

I want get shot last Friday took 12 yrs old second shot made get first. Retirement savings US complicated. There's basically 4 ways fund it:

 - Social security. Almost everyone works required law contribute it. do, build retirement benefit (and also disability benefit). Employers pay too. redistributional sense lower income therefore lower contributions, get bang buck.
 - Tax advantages savings accounts, like 401(k), 403(b), IRA Roth. savings investment accounts perhaps employer pay it, grows market, use retirement, paying less tax om normal earnings investments. lot control money, circumstances even withdraw early. also known defined contribution retirement plan, contributions clearly defined, payouts retirement (because depend well market withdraw money). 
 - Employer sponsored retirement plans contributions give right future pension payout. known defined benefit retirement plans, people mean say 'pension'. used common, mostly found government jobs jobs strong unions. 
 - saving money normal retirement investment account. 

When people say working TSA gives pension, mean get access defined benefit retirement plan. Specifically, defined benefit plan that's part Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS).

In jobs access social security (in fact, required take part) 401(k).  recall someone NPR earlier year talking Black Americans anti-vax, history much mistreatment medical industry, want someone straight honest issue hand. ""Place +1/+1 token 'Richard, Searcher Buttholes' every unnecessary search conducted""  time though, us outside cult, good reminder brainwashed segment country false message pushed certain interests they'd rather uproot entire fucking lives got little shot.      like treason. People basically sold everyone around virus. yup, 35%. bulgaria lower europe.

our daily infections 1.7 times higher december wave, vaccines. we're expected hit 2x. say nothing comments. data overwhelming.  Haha, going for. U know alter ur DNA? Smoking, drinking, fat. admit antivax bc pure prejudice, instead spouting random ""science"". know even try research. Nice, sure enjoy that.  know New York County Manhattan, think people generally take ‚ÄúNew York, NY‚Äù mean NY city, NY county. I've always said this. TSA 2 birds one stone solution republican president:

Came shortly dotcom bubble burst. That's fucking awful. dental pain absolutely debilitating. Imagine spending last years toothache every day. Fuck sake. lie took mRNA vaccine control magnetic materials fight dude named Professor X bunch freaky teenagers   also ask men

To protected sex third world entire organization nothing, ok. Got JJ May working Cambodia got Sinivac booster. Spain it‚Äôs pretty much well. could even better getting there. That‚Äôs terrible. Low vaccine rate?  things improve could lead regime change. mean loosing many people eventually impact economy. Good luck finding lawyer represent suing hospital administering deworming medicine Federal government one biggest employers USA? factor contractors etc. Could also fact PDX TSA agents people Portland. We're generally pretty chill here. nothing win here, lifes habits got modified patogen never supposed lose traits stay forever. keep adapting move on. Gottem virus deadly enough that. Russians

I genuinely read Boney M's voice head. think cripple US economy long run. large number people work benefits good economy. Also spending lot money educating people loosing young age good. Clickbait headline giving COVID deniers platform spout misinformation fear.

How many New Yorkers considering leaving city don‚Äôt want vaccine? don‚Äôt say. managed interview few. 

A city millions people managed find Covid deniers, imagine that. Yeah *of course* you‚Äôll find eventually. Everyone save. mean can, do, expected to, deserve live elder years abject poverty.

Also, know many people say mantra every opportunity throughout life find time comes without sufficient savings unforeseen consequences? Plenty.

Appealing people's egos great way save money employer politician. ridiculous many people fall simple emotional manipulation interest.  lot match certain %. disagree, underwear shoe bombers got foreign airport security, TSA. Time money. 

I‚Äôve regularly bypassed 2+ hour lines (FLL) arriving back US global entry. walk vast immigration room completely packed, never even stop walking except get immigration officer. 

Its foolish sit long line. Unless don‚Äôt value time all.  NFL Las Vegas Raiders still offer pension employees. Source: offered office job  Yeah guess strong local economy good transportation hub would attract folks. get would attract blue folks specifically, would call ""fox henhouse"". 

Like economic resurgence good everyone?  *Maybe* China forthcoming soon realized shut Chinese New Years travel, probably even then. massively distributed across world stopping it. Social Security actually amount Old Age Pension UK, actually. Plus elderly America get free medical care Medicare.

Both countries super great supporting elderly, far cry bizarre caricatures America commenters attempted share. say equitable conversation I‚Äôm making fun public entertainment. social security Medicare. sure I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pension though. Fun aside, wife always brings hand weights traveling workout. considered weapons, anything less fine. IMO make sense b/c seems like someone could beat someone 2lb weight easily 10lb. problem they‚Äôre stuck line lmao forget ivermectin list. saying old people pension fall back get really old, unless career included funding one?

Contrary naive comments telling you, matter linguistic confusion. Yes, elderly America get pension, called Social Security. also get free medical care MediCare program.

Social Security Old Age Pension UK amount. Sounds like good time restructure TSA  Wait 48 hours. additional information.  FDA advisory panel [meeting discuss Moderna today J&amp;J tomorrow. Ok...


Your statement though calls attempt prove negative. nonsensical... adult vaccinated luxury. 

No one took right make living. need shot.

They also fired punching passengers. protect ""right"" either. adapt lifestyle adapt meet requirements society. 

There awful lot strict true/false post. Unfortunately world works. 

We practicing ""virus security"" here, anyone familiar security knows works layers. One might expect tsa familiar concept.

Vaccines work best widely deployed, reduces transmission (still possible, reduced vaccine) turn reduce occurrence new variants.  need many people possible vaccinated reasons, currently everyone be, particular children also small percentage actual cause cause get vaccinated. Aside this, humans interest seeing neighbors get sick die. 

On death rate. First, death bad outcome covid rates symptoms patients far higher focus death rate would suggest. Long term disabilities possibility, short term effects quite common. One study among health workers found 10% symptoms impacting work quality life *8 months* later.
All aside, numbers game, getting vaccinated dangerous virus potential long term disability fear vaccine symptoms like wearing seat belt fear pinching finger clasp. 

Both ""if vaccine effective cares"" ""well many died"" crap arguments. want sick, want kids sick, want neighbors sick, want sick. 

Get shot. think nail hit stubborn. 

They‚Äôve bought propaganda refuse se anything it. admitting lied sign they‚Äôre stupid, gullible, weak minded. 

And what‚Äôs really terrible people alienating would like back, would almost immediately move long back lives. somehow they‚Äôve allowed lied people don‚Äôt care them, refuse listen folks actually love them, want help. Granted I'm pretty upbeat could energy reflected

This right here. many people take general travel frustrations TSA agents, wonder bad experience. Everyone knowns things theater, even TSA agent asking take shoes. But, agent person makes decision getting mad nothing. [Here pre-print actual writing technical scroll bottom final figure nice summary 9 combinations primary vaccine + booster. Panels B&amp;E show J&amp;J boosters three initial vaccine series.  That's I've said years - TSA lines honestly create target peak times packing tons un-screened people small space. even usually need boarding pass get line. That's I'm convinced big threat people want think. Surely terrorists every rock, someone would exploited now. Obviously people want hurt others, can't stop moving target. would hell lot effective stop drone striking civilians spend money improving quality life instead.  right work yes right opt medical services, believe anything relative society one lives in. supposedly free society, optimal people able choose work work suits lifestyle. 

It matter job is. Again, small minded.

This conversation done lol üòÖ enjoy ""eat shit"" looks get? That's reason get even though free. Yeah hassle going security year. like there's wait line. Sorry, news flash. Smoking basic human right. luxury. 

The right make living basic human right. think basic human right specific job want. mean, ignoring unbelievably illogical is, think job people human right fucking **TSA screener**. That‚Äôs rich. physically assaulted TSA agent annoyed hear tell move crowded screening line. jabbed fingers right shoulderblades. soon Trump elected, seemed emboldened miserable elements country. Terrorists tend leave trails. Cash transfers known terrorist groups evidence planning activities, example. great advice immunocompromised, elderly, high risk populations. whole ""keep calm"" propaganda needs stop since still substantial risks getting infected many vulnerable populations despite vaccination. course I'm serious. Imagine training whole life work career giving years fired give fall line. We're talking medical autonomy. ability say want drug. want contraception. want vaccine.

Forcing people take vaccines makes us different China force medical decisions people.

You're small minded think anyone dissents majority way thinking deserve basic human rights. 

Luckily IQ probably low enough never able hold dissenting opinion never position.  Might makes right!

Btw, agree you. Anti-vaxxers seem like nice bunch people, comprise 40% TSA, partially explain many people bad experience TSA. woman frustrating...

She information needs make informed, rational decision still chooses emotional reaction knows it, like says article.

Why people like this? Please delete comment. stays someone might read replies correctly state saying isn‚Äôt true become misinformed TSA agents actually caring public safety?! Next telling police refusing get vaccine! /s

Gotcha.

And they?? observations:

1. lot news reporting every issue western vaccines. ""1 person died getting vaccinated Pfizer"", ""30 emergency care astrazeneca jabs"", etc. read person dying sputnik shot. there's general government antivax propaganda, mostly trying paint countries bad light. 

2. People trust government general (yet there's still nothing happening it, hand, seems nothing done anymore - see Khabarovsk Belarus huge rallies - unfortunately ended nothing). 

3. Government implementing shitty measures early pandemic, reducing trust newer methods even further.

4. lot fakes general idiocy among population. mom keeps forwarding insane conspiracy theories via messengers, mother law, doctor, bought fake vaccine passport COVID antivax. that's educated people living Moscow. distant villages likely even worse.  cant seriously believe virus didn‚Äôt come China. thought given propaganda.

Gottem Wait trump loyalists realize rent hardly afford nice coushiney job 2x price move. official government officials state run media. endlessly attacked western vaccines.  risk incurred others remaining unvaccinated (compared vaccinated) sufficiently high, risk incurred vaccinated sufficiently low, comfortable forcing people vaccinate?

Yes.

700,000 dead virus.

\~6000 deaths happened close timing vaccination - 350,000,000+ doses administered US. mean 6000 people killed vaccine, means died shortly getting it. 95 year old gets shot, dies 2 weeks later, may may related. 6000 absolute max.  Given problem exists, necessarily foolish pay solution (as individual). I'm cheap, personally, see appeal. skip line free say prefer pat-down. hip replacements peg metal detector. Also worked prison 4 yrs getting surgeries get pat-down every shift, got routine.

Long answer, No. Several companies offer 401k, 403b, roth 401k retirement options. jobs really offer pensions US are, civil service jobs (like police, fire department, sanitation). government jobs (like TSA, CIA, NSA, FBI, US parks). private companies remaining US offer pensions. offer annuities, usually Union jobs (like Longshoremen, Electrial, Plumbers, Elevator mechanics, Iron workers).

2. unvaccinated person hospital line rejoin regular line 5 people provide new proof vaccination behalf. Converting thoughts prayers shots protection! poor can't afford catch covid. Bills.  Minocqua. Rural Wisconsin *real* trumpy SOB's everywhere look.

Medical mistakes happen. rare. happen.  


In country 340 Million people, rare events happen daily.  


This serious debacle family could tragedy them. Luckily wasn't.  


But news story. expected event. Pharmacists give incorrect medications. rare medical mistakes, common side. is, tell medical mistake occurred, want make bet mistake was. Betting ""wrong medication administered"" much likely bet ""wrong leg amputated."" guess -- happens pretty frequently too. imagine many real cases must then?? they're clearly not... Social Security popular program older Americans rely survive. It‚Äôs going anywhere. Yes current rates, run money. legislative solution eventually. probably combination pushing Full Retirement Age back year two (much like moved 65 67 past) increase Social Security tax rate. task failed successfully  dumb dumb dumb dumb dumbbbbb You‚Äôre getting Covid food.

WISH vaccine could eradicate Covid, us simply true animal reservoirs, transmissible Delta variant, transmission vaccinated people keep going, that‚Äôs even including possibilities new, resistant strains future. Measles vax perhaps bad example unusually effective produces (arguable) ‚Äòsterilizing immunity‚Äô meaning cannot transmit (the normally also unusually crazy transmissible)measles vaccinated. Covid vaccines reduce transmission, but, depending study/type, 65%. So, still easily infect sickly grandma transplant patient, even vaccinated.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah exactly person talking ass. WHAT? SELLING? There's social security 401k's, provide slew tax benefits save money. imagine getting vaccine going work freaking airport every day? sure can't. Companies need start giving bonuses us already vaccinated. 1k bonus right Christmas might get big chunk employees get vaccinated.  went airport security like 20 minutes ago. pulled backpack aside promptly ignored ~10 minutes. Eventually agent picked handed back me, search anything. IDK pulled first place gonna anything it. sucks make sure take advantage IRA.

Also, consider suggesting employer start 401k. pass costs employees doesn‚Äôt cost anything. There‚Äôs places specialize 401ks smallish companies won‚Äôt rip employees high fees/high expense ratio funds. Let know you‚Äôre interested go dig up.

Edit: oh shit rereading comment realize 401k match. Nevermind. saying everyone infected. I‚Äôm saying disease spreads quickly along social networks ‚Äîpeople know congregate other, particularly close quarters indoors. two similar groups don‚Äô‚Äô really interact other, one group may hit badly doesn‚Äô‚Äô register cases. Social networks may get infected quickly ‚Äî‚Äîn extreme case would prison population, where, US, saw entire prisons infected space week two ‚Äî register rapid drop cases everyone group could infected infected. Note also pandemic, links social groups may cut (so infections confined unlucky groups) people start isolating themselves.

Typically kind isolation phenomenon much weaker India western note, seem using official numbers, gross undercount. Quickly Googling, see article says recorded almost 2M excess deaths July 2020 March 2021. ¬´¬†¬†The number deaths 43 times higher official Covid-19 toll nine months¬†¬ª¬†¬ª That‚Äôs line overall excess deaths estimate

The article say 110% last year, 
If really whole population got exposed would talking far that. primarily meant safety net people enough otherwise, level (US$12,581/year, Australia significantly expensive US) something people aspire to.

Australia mandatory superannuation since 1983. basically like mandatory 401(k), compulsory employees, every employer must contribute 10% employees salary it. employee add top want. invested, employee gets access retirement. days ago someone said daily thread masks required ""all"" required wear masks right etc.. pointed correct states mask mandate right now, long many major cities. got downvoted. people really know many states/cities refused implement mask mandate year lol?

Last year even Texas mask mandate, year even Michigan state wide mask mandate. people states longer required wear masks bars, concerts, restaurants, theaters, entertainment venues. required huge portions unvaccinated areas like South? Yes, course. Masks also worn indoors high transmissions areas! shocked many people unaware 2020 comes restrictions, states longer any. probably whole dataset. It‚Äôs possible they‚Äôll pump supplemental figures peer review think figures already capture all. 

The Moderna higher dose. makes sound like it‚Äôs globally efficient use 30 mcg Pfizer dosing it‚Äôs really hard understand caveats (eg: maybe Pfizer lipid nanoparticles higher delivery efficiency maybe supply chain limited grams mRNA instead somewhere downstream). Sadly, yes. pandemic taught many selfish, unethical, anti-social, sociopathic, immoral, disordered, twisted humans world ‚Äî charge government, business, courts, law, position power public trust grift harm public/ workers/ consumers. 

A days ago someone different sub quoted something like this:

Oh without doubt, I'm speaking behalf truckers know hear things grapevine mandates possible go strike. often see hometown Reddit! live anymore I'm glad people like Kirk try make positive difference.  Yes please fire fucks. ven diagram cops take vaccine issues abusing authority likely pretty tight circle. FDA VRBPAC voted unanimously approve Moderna boosters, expect FDA reissue revised EUA real soon CDC act next week. meeting J&amp;J boosters, mixed boosters? It‚Äôs also neat see Moderna higher baseline levels neutralizing antibody (although may potentially confounded different time since immunization). know. Ever since switched Yorkcast feed instead Youtube feed much better. sure coincidence  Thank you!!!!!!! No, take promising everyone gets COVID gets hospitalized

But always case original COVID virus even variants. Boosters **approved** people received Moderna second shot 6 months ago in:

Individuals 65+

Individuals 18-64 years age high risk severe COVID-19

Individuals 18-64 whose frequent institutional occupational exposure SARS-CoV-2 puts high risk serious complications COVID-19 including severe COVID-19

Unanimously, 19-0. mirrors approval given Pfizer. think less current pandemic preventing next one.

Let's say happened prove came lab gain function research, would give world leaders leverage shut gain function research labs. hand, let's say happened prove came wet market, would give world leaders leverage shut wet markets.

Basically, know came from, there's lot less political power make changes might prevent future pandemics. Pulse oxymeter.

I thought said already diarrhea? think there's anything special milk, though water, electrolytes, calories. Federal rules anyway. Nothing could weaken them. hurt call nurse's line see think. really giving medical advice here. Fever possible symptom everyone one.  Good. refuse vaccine, shouldn‚Äôt working health care imho. FDA Vaccine Advisory Committee votes approve Moderna booster. Boosters approved people received Moderna second shot 6 months ago:

It‚Äôs certainly within purview take social issues see fit, let market decide lands.

I miss days could argue, ageee disagree, move w lives  Good point. passengers knew going die regardless, bets off. human facing certain death dangerous creature. OSHA submitted text rule White House Tuesday approval. Yeah, I'd wonder got eyes too. actual laws preventing kind thing. Politicians immune lawsuit due things say law making process. thanks explainer. I'm curious people believe vaccinated also leads variants. far understood it, unvaccinated people contribute creation variants higher viral replication rate. copies virus gives opportunities mutate. Vaccinated individuals create selective pressures mutate well though, mechanism variant slightly different spike protein escapes neutralizing antibodies allowed propagate. vaccinated immune response specific widespread, would lot selective pressure across nation evolve spike protein.

I'm pro-vaccination, I've wondering deal issue selective pressure (vaccinated vs non-vaccinated) actually creates dangerous variants long run. Lol  saying people died personal choice make it. reality nothing vaccine mandates. Wait week half there‚Äôs good chance moderna booster available. agree point people deserving know. And, I‚Äôm trying defend China means wonder major world power would willing admit fault something like this. Seems like something many countries would try hide costs.

Yes, many match contributions. It‚Äôs basically like described. state pension Social Security. mention states anti-vax governors using huge quantities regeneron stockpile. worry, spent another 2.94 billion buy another 1.4 million doses gone quarter year. whole point going court **hear arguments** including real expert opinion (i.e. doctors me) make legal decision. county weight evidence side backing decision, win, *different thing* saying citizens right file lawsuit.

FDA scientists Marion Gruber Philip Krause quit it, course last act rejecting boosters general population. seemed like giant ""f--- you"" Biden American public. 

You even read Krause's opinion piece Lancet detailing motivation, basically reasoning was, ""Nobody cares symptomatic Covid anymore trying stop spread disease. 2 shots good enough, 70 pretty high number, right? think: 70. That's super duper high. hey, still good protection landing hospital. third shot probably way better, umm... countries need vaccine us (and forget moment FDA mandate decide this)? way, Marion 65 we'll getting boosters, f--- rest y'all. Peace out."" (paraphrasing here)

The CDC interpreted FDA approval liberally, example get booster BMI 25, 73% US. say smoker former smoker eligible -- definition former smoker (tried party?). want it, could get either criteria. fucking wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶
And realize now, fact someone may believe this, can‚Äôt nice things. Yeah truly disjointed marvel behold. Walensky overruling turned luke cool luke warm. Probably without disruptive technology seems basis hospitalizations vs Covid. They‚Äôre approving boosters groups fully vaccinated, even still higher chance hospitalization. healthy 30 year old fully vaccinated extremely small chance needing intervention. think seem comfortable current breakthrough rate. Plank?   heh heh Also respiratory diseases Noooo means flock Florida.  glad see! may start watching support this. study:

‚Äú Less information available regarding risk myocarditis COVID-19 infection itself. data would helpful developing complete risk-benefit analysis population.‚Äù

The author study statistical modeler, scientist. I‚Äôm trying super picky there‚Äôs way verify model holds up. think military gives fuck ‚Äúchurch‚Äù says?

Hahah. thousands. ten million? also free pass harass people. They're reason absolutely hate flying. damned humiliating pulled ""the room"", searched, asked bunch pointless, invasive questions.

As someone that's transgender, get harassed 100% time go airport. Always questions. Always humiliation.

EDIT: 100% success rate finding Nintendo Switch liquid medications take. Great use money, guys! That's really burns antivaxxers. sound god damn confident spewing bullshit. Like, try check back research. try reasonable make claims. try find middle ground possible. assholes post say shit like they're god damn Nobel prize winning scientists spent lives studying particular topic. never even occurred might want know consequences they're wrong. could literally kill somebody spewing nonsense. blows mind, they've everywhere. least admit knowledge!! Argh. concerned it, get johnson &amp; johnson vaccine mRNA based Literally sounds like something last president US might say GOOD! both. Less snot less coughs equals less spread.  Sorry man. They're already patrol. Every choice someone makes impacts rest us. Myocarditis known side effect vaccine Covid, especially younger people. Speak PCP urgent care bothersome. way generous point. would people start shots tested equally ethnicities, given literally billions people around world, conclude maybe bad black people? even rationale people giving.

For example, Andrew Wiggins, NBA star: previously covid, previously allergic reactions. Actually, far reasons go, horrible. course, goes ruin ""hopefully I'm still okay 10 years"" bullshit getting shot. okay 30 minutes later? fine 10 years.

Letitia Wright, plays smartest person world Marvel: ""doesn't know what's it"". Well, ultimately us know exactly what's it, know what's miso soup ate yesterday, either.

DeAndre Hopkins: ""Freedom"". Okay, guess freedom die disease spreading matter, thanks.

Mark Robinson, North Carolina lieutenant governor: knows podiatrists getting it.

The whole historic treatment black community really nothing reasons prominent black people giving. let turnstiles hit ass way out. vaccine doesn‚Äôt stop spread. prevents dying virus. Don‚Äôt let idiots come Texas, we‚Äôre already quota. Saw ZDogg podcast mention Moderna slightly better Pfizer time doses longer. Pfizer would prob effective doses spaced more. made single worst argument someone could make case heck New York Spider-Man PS4 better real one everyone game Quarantining, staying streets.

Nothing nee information. Thank you. sounds like stopped idiot, terrorist.

Was indication going use knife anything besides cooking?  Lots elderly Russia US would think.  risk myocarditis covid far higher vaccine. something like 150 confirmed cases myocarditis following vaccine sample size 7.1 million. 

In words, get myocarditis taking shot, might well buy lottery ticket it.

Source: Fook me? fook you!  x% people vaccinated, effectively, introducing unvaccinated people number essentially higher would otherwise be.

Correct I‚Äôm wrong, say 10% people space unvaccinated, would truely significantly riskier vaccinated people?
Supposing unvaccinated accept higher risk (in places vaccine available reasonable time). global warming. Oh, please, know plenty people would get vaccinated turned lizard! Airlines stopped ton people guns boarding airplanes way TSA existed.

As far know people TSA stopped guns idiots though. think evidence single one intent use plane. Canadian here. forcing us get vaccinated allowed go bars restaurants. unaware people want vaccine cannot get yet. Ah yes, racist cocaine addict killed kid great source vaccine information. Sayonara! It‚Äôll end like five losers anyway Neither virus. (Though doubt information help alter anyone‚Äôs thinking). Thank taking time share. still reservations, makes feel lot less panicky. appreciate it. Thankfully already dr appt scheduled Friday plan bring up. Right? cant make simple, well informed scientifically backed decision else slacking? BS believe?  Yeah, put people competition sole survivor shall crowned ""Kind ignorance idiocy"". know, like squid games see people suffer, good thing book. I'm guessing white.
Vaguely middle eastern looking people used get stopped time.  Box cutters pretty crappy weapons. allowed bring sewing scissors (which usually separate effectively two small knives). also buy stuff post-security easily turned effective weapons box cutters.

Everybody different opinion. big city. vaccine never going eradicate covid though. still infects significant portion vaccinated population, animal reservoirs giant part world rural, war torn poor get vaccine.

This narrative always weird ignores reality. take opportunity abolish TSA already..??

ah well one dream latest news specifically prevention first heart attacks strokes using aspirin.

It made U.S. Preventive Services Task Force organization ***does*** recommend aspirin women high risk preeclampsia.

This guidance made 2 weeks ago:

[The USPSTF recommends use low-dose aspirin (81 mg/day) preventive medication 12 weeks gestation persons high risk That‚Äôs he‚Äôs saying. hates minorities! People Reddit lost minds think still eradicate even though respectable scientist said past year. lunacy, unfortunately lot smart people fallen trap similar Ireland. Masks never worn 12s outside anyone. Contact tracing recently stopped schools, there's positive case class, everyone else stays in. case rate twice EU average, schools. Americans obsessed reason, even though public health officials everywhere else really concerned children all. really easy safe solution issue.  reached ludicrous stage. Hospitals jammed beyond capacity, crisis standards care across state mobs protesters every time anyone tries talk mitigation strategies. areas less 30% vaccination rates, statewide 95% hospitalizations deaths recent surge unvaccinated. pretty COVID front.

It surprise one watching insanity Idaho consistently ranks among bottom education, funding test scores. Correct. Tag Bertuzzi Todd‚Äôs son. could born lived like... north part harlem definitely ""the city"" back  know, qualitative antibody quantitative antibody tests 

The one above(gives number) quantitative, need blood draw. done LabCorp/quest/other labs, probably doctor's office (they send lab), need doctors prescription mostly 

The qualitative test yes/no, give number. pharmacies it, becareful number, FDA warns interpreting number means (is 1k good enough) happens number falls time (your body also memory cells, counted tests, cells also react fight COVID infection) right. NSAIDs Ibuprofen thing. thought Tylenol ibuprofen. ya, reversal course early media reports: stay home. certainly don‚Äôt want run you. sounds like would real bummer time.  never gave implication calling antivaxxers marginalized. calling sick people marginalized. do. prevents unvaccinated accessing many activities.   got mine Saturday morning back March. Got chills aches night, spent Sunday resting/napping, basically fine Monday. them, pat everything TSA like $13/14 hour hundreds thousands scientists high level managers. It‚Äôs full spectrum.

Oh dunno. flew threw Houston week woman tried bring entire kitchen losing mind took away Costco size bottles condiments giant knives trying bring through. seemed utterly dumbfounded 12"" kitchen knife allowed. husband kept huffing, ""this ridiculous, long going take?!"" No.... wrong. born part became part ""the city"" gentrification? Welp. sucks. daily low dose aspirin regimen prevent preeclampsia (my blood pressure got kinda sorta highish end last pregnancy). like risk bleeding important childbirth anything‚Ä¶   let door hit way want learn circumvent paywall, see Or, website regularly read, think subscribing website. I'm 40s, city means friends. (They might include SI, much Brooklyn Queens Bronx certainly city.) read everyone said. provide scientific info nothing misinformed about. Good. Leave then. Live idiotic choice. Vaccine bad Eric ended getting !  Paywall   Todd Bertuzzi kid? so, maybe surprise  Millions Canadians got mix match vaccines (mostly AZ + Moderna). USA officially acknowledges effectiveness Canadians barred entering USA. It‚Äôs big issue land border opening soon.   lying... cuz say otherwise.

That young like work. insisted actors musicians follow decent humans, I‚Äôd never partake entertainment mostly garbage. Source: worked live entertainment 20 years. brain damage catching it? know, who?  hope come area. followed rules bought bottle liquor airport duty-free store, used appropriate bag label whatever, TSA still took ""too dark"" machine see through. Utter fucking bullshit. 

But hey we're ""stopping terrorism"" guess ok? Rent may going down! Buh Bye. let door hit collective asses way out. Thats weird way say ‚Äúidiots, assholes like maybe 1 guy actually can‚Äôt medical reasons something‚Äù hell drive pharmacy.

You ever seen NYC traffic? Fuggedaboutit. Speaking born Manhattanite, people city would say buroughs part city too.  updates person lives Idaho? Uh, mentality? Think it‚Äôs lot people working TSA minorities, vax-skeptical.   I‚Äôm looking forward shit show lines Thanksgiving week travel understaffed TSA. Hopefully Precheck save me. may noticed problem right can‚Äôt get able-bodied people work, shortage jobs. We‚Äôll hours long lines airport chicken pox vaccinations, kids hadn‚Äôt chicken pox yet take aspirin. could get Reye‚Äôs syndrome. Mostly old advice long children get chicken pox flu vaccinations.

Source Aspirin linked Reye's syndrome, use caution giving aspirin children teenagers fever pain. Though aspirin approved use children older age 3, children teenagers recovering chickenpox flu-like symptoms never take treatment fever pain, consider giving child infants' children's over-the-counter fever pain medications acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others) safer alternative aspirin. Talk doctor concerns. lot people country football full, clubs full, restaurants full.

Sure! lot people see probably going restaurant month instead twice month, like said, minority wants remain careful, receive judgement me

What failing understand minority. people still scaling back physical interactions would prior COVID. Don‚Äôt worry though. Every time travel magic card deck I‚Äôm pulled aside X-rays can‚Äôt pass cardboard plastic. Sure, that's used word ""disproportionate,"" word often used describing impact policies different demographic groups. many Americans dislike reading. took several years graduating college learn enjoy reading. forced read many bad books remember granular details never actually got enjoy reading anything. School even ruined good books.  Oh no! Who‚Äôs going provide false sense security travelers repeatedly failing flag dangerous items sent security test?!?/s Dumb aspirin sniffers 3..2..1..   They‚Äôre early winter wave.  Bye  We‚Äôre Tylenol household, seems important‚Ä¶ not? come NJ. surprised since one hardest hit 2020. believe something like 40k excess death increase previous years. week antivax colleague moved on. ""Take easy, know RNA can't change DNA"". he's heard super smart professor vaccine cause immune system attack cells mRNA ""enters cells"". says confidence too. younger employees nod agreement, sounds knowledgeable! ""fact-correcting"" articles way little late face determined ignorance. battle misinformation done much larger scale. beginning said NSAIDs really dangerous combined covid? hope Florida becomes strict vaccinations. need idiots die leave country mean actually per capita necessarily people, US least. win-win?   Water wet also Well well well. Time learn useless tsa past 20 years. Bigger issue TBH caused TSA creating huge soft targets immensely long queues especially high travel periods. security metal detectors security. disaster waiting happen.

Then we'll I've experienced travels sketchier parts world car going airport needs guy dog another mirror circling car looking underneath, checking trunk anything suspicious keeping clear line sight car see passengers react well. times I've happy plane left Egypt.   people function real life ..

Cool, bye Nothing surprising late me‚Ä¶ still recovering breakthrough Doesn‚Äôt matter evidence Agreed. Awe crap. Stay don‚Äôt come ruin rest country.  there's ""no liquids 3 ounces"" rule, I'm pretty sure came someone TSA watched *Die Hard Vengeance*. ""A great way get COVID get COVID.""

Nope. buying guy selling. Exactly. Oh man hope happens Los Angeles. really afford shed stupider population. honestly same, fortunately I've always ran pretty nice TSA agents. Granted I'm pretty upbeat could energy reflected. vaccine cause immune system attack cells mRNA ""enters cells""

I mean that's totally accurate. enters cells muscle endocytosis releases mRNA payload cell manufactures spike protein displayed surface cell MHC-antigen complexes. CD4+ CD8+ cells come along whole humoral immune system kicks gear ultimately infected cells get dismantled back constituent lego blocks. Stuff also gets carted lymph nodes gut processing immune system. sorta ""how immune system works 101"" big scary thing. immune system attacks cells display MHC-spike complex surface, means either recently got vaccinated infected. got pulled past weekend highly dangerous black white cookies. guess frosting technically deadly heighten chance heart disease but...  asked one question. ""Are immunocompromised?"" Answer ""yes.""  still disproportionately affects black people, seems like racism me. Also strange allowed church directly contradict Pope. much want everyone get vaccinated, mass firing people going create uptake vaccines make people even *more* resistant. anything, mandates giving anti-vaxxers attention want. wish good solution Gonti Control, Korvold Lands, Kykar spell slinging, Ezuri Elf ball, Feldon reanimator.

Now unknowingly pregnant taking medication whatever, I‚Äôd willing provide data companies experience. different situation. They‚Äôve also ignored TSA complaints since Congress critters aren‚Äôt subjected TSA screenings.

Same reason Universal Healthcare low lists. They‚Äôve already got it. usually carry little 2 3 inch pocket knives convenience. see make big deal dumb X-ray machines find tiny knife. Guess makes feel good something. miss half time. TSA doesn‚Äôt anything anyhow pay folks stay home Connecticut here, want them! Nice TSA keeping bringing holy water board 

#NO LIQUIDS BEYOND CHECKPOINT

You safe MTG cards /s legitimately worried (vaccinated) parents Idaho anything happens them. Please unvaccinated people overwhelming hospitals. And? Canada open border members Congress asked Canada it. bizarre Canadians think members congress writing letters equates pressuring Canada opening borders year later - really shows mindset Canadians think letter Congressmen controlling policies lol. mean going turn cyborg werewolf? find kind hard swallow. there's trap mechanic (if remember correctly) allows play card instantly free condition triggered. $50k/yr secure job that's indoors requires education. That's pretty solid.  Also hospitals already running pretty full. local children's hospitals basically capacity normal illness plus bad wave RSV Covid came back late August. Adult hospitals usual heart attacks cancer plus ""elective"" things pushed COVID lockdowns last year. much capacity anywhere outside major metropolitan areas - maybe bed five local hospital.  guaranteed run shoes security subjected full body scans‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThanks guys‚Äù [Awarded] Ivan D. Hoh accepts HCA. fair, it‚Äôs also awful condiment. still confused going UK. looking cases alone, worst wave UK faced, though hospitalization death rates relatively low showing effectiveness vaccines. 

But I'm confused wave UK seems stubborn. looked like done mid July, go back wave appears like bunch small hills. every country world cases subside consistently peak Delta wave, cases crash UK. 

As i've said though, high case counts leading excess deaths, still good thing. outsider, appears Covid socially UK anyway way cases trended perplexing. Climate scientists: First time? I‚Äôm okay this. New Yorkers: ""Bye!"" *She 48 hours consider impossible choice: file taxes time, pay late filing penalties*. quilt bomber? confiscated chunk cheese possibility plastic explosive. CHEESE, FFS! 40% resign would good start. last time hijacker used demon hijack plane? ‚Ä¶ see? TSA keeping safe.

^(/s) take god damn shot, difficult? precheck line closed, get little precheck IOU slip lets keep shoes go metal detector instead body scanner thing. Even got moderna first two? Also, unless I‚Äôm mistaken TSA wasn‚Äôt checking shoes shoe bomber I‚Äôm sure would caught it. Every time take shoes airport silently curse asshole. Ok bye? brittle spirit read worrying article months ago climate change training fungi able survive warmer warmer temperatures. tropical areas we're beginning see outbreaks previously rare fungal diseases. We're great treating systemic fungal infections. add animal agriculture, plus human/ animal interactions due animals fleeing urban areas habitat depletion, definitely pandemics future. Yeah, feel like immunity vaccination + infection probably better longer lasting immunity infection. realized got cabin cruise ship still pepper spray purse. flown port, Carnival security check well. Great work around.

A coworker mine went 3 TSA checkpoints 8"" hunting knife bag. found unpacking hotel mailed back house.  Honestly tsa due cut. Airplane terrorism isn‚Äôt really biggest priority rn Infections mean nothing, hospitalizations deaths. Singapore 80% vaccinated they're getting insane amount infections, that's big deal they're vaccinated rate hospitalizations manageable, quite low.   Round downy least kept Satan worshiping crap America's skies. /s Box cutters pretty crappy weapons. 

Yup, reason worked flight crews passengers told comply hijackers rather risk injury death, 9/11 hijackers wanted something like money, clemency, make statement, etc. became apparent hijackers going kill everyone plane matter what, passengers revolted Flight 93 ended field instead building. even take full day tactics become outdated.

If anyone ever tries hijack plane like again, passengers tear hijackers apart even means passengers may die, want another 9/11. TSA absolutely useless rendered obsolete first agent hired.   Question, kind facial hair have? Edh Modern. Monkey blade ftw! seven canadian teams league border crossing going big issue league basically choice get everyone vaccinated. Generally agree reason that‚Äôs experience PDX (Portland, OR). Every time pass wonder local leadership makes difference even federal agency. ""fucking stupid"" suffer consequences poor, obesity one them. fucking stupid anti vax mean get rid useless security theatre TSA? Ehhh commander playing?? Welcome Costco, love you! Wow, knew TSA agents stupid?

My last flight agent searched bag small metal objects bag. actually walked later said ""we wondering is, we've never seen before.""

It USB flash drive. Box Cutters would effective weapon anyway. People simply can't afford passive hijacker anymore, matter weapon. 

They fixed future 911s reinforcing doors cockpit new public awareness someone successfully hijacking plane scenario ends death others. One time felt way week first ever panic attack. turned felt way week continued freak thinking something wrong me. I‚Äôm saying case well, it‚Äôs something think about. Simply put, marginalized people understand science, 

wtf lol. least legitimate reason equal opportunities education something. white upper-middle class yuppies definitely excuse, still one strongest driving forces behind listen authorities

Gee wonder assure weeks grabbing hairs despair tempted call military round everybody.

WTF???  know 20 people least caught breakthrough last month. Everyone ok Oh? joke, fake, branch govt. services compliance? woulda thought. prefer look glass half full scenario, alot conservative states plethora job housing opportunities get vaccinated. study US Centers Disease Control Prevention another one Israel‚Äôs largest health providers found people who‚Äôd recovered Covid later vaccinated half risk reinfection compared unvaccinated people who‚Äôd previously Covid.

This super encouraging well.  Calm storm third wave.  Russian phrase though. Time shut fuck down. it. Fucking security theater embarrasses travel internationally. What's $179/yr? $85 5 yr period, right? That's according CC paid Global Entry yrs ago, I'm certain pricing details.  wouldn‚Äôt necessarily call ‚Äúfringe group‚Äù. Bronx let much past 50 years form protest. people aren‚Äôt ‚ÄúFringe‚Äù either. That‚Äôs bullshit term throw out.

Dukes different. Pre Check requires thorough background check, even you‚Äôre cleared still go security checkpoint. thing (at least LAX) go metal detector keep shoes on. detector goes it‚Äôs full-body you.  body choice. *shrugs* agree general point, it‚Äôs worth pointing shoe bomber underwear bomber flights Europe.  smaller stations gate ramp staff contracted, hubs mainline employees. 

My guess correct maintenance pilots. Id imagine flights attendants bc affects pay (with countries requiring full vaccination, can‚Äôt fa standby say oh go here‚Ä¶ need able go needed) true nose swab nostrils instead throat swab? can‚Äôt throat swab save life heard nostrils instead. true covid tests give school? *use* course, private jets.

They *profit* though.  Sure, vaccinated senior citizens still likely hospitalized catching case unvaccinated kid way around. Even vaccinated 30-40 something adult risk scenario. I'm noticing ringing silence possibility boosters people got Johnson Johnson shot, multiple studies shown decreased efficacy Delta variant several months. J&amp;J booster would reportedly increase efficacy moderate severe disease 72% 94%, Yale Medicine ""sciency"" enough you. Would care comment that, want smugly tell people ""trust science"" again? There's social security income based great. Company pensions basically exist days. majority pensions privatized converted 401ks IRAs. Massive government subsidies. Pension phased industries. avenues save control retirement finances, people that's way worse. Damn it! wanted human CRISPR really, especially since vaccines pipe dream back then. take long decade develop effective vaccines; ones ready go less year nothing short unexpected miracle. Yeah one confused too. Unless self-employed shitty branch work like call center pretty much everybody build pension (apparently 10% non-self-employed workers don't). Fuck work temp agency found week even I'm building pension. really rare perk US? irks vaccine mandates obvious tool demand obedience. point getting vaccine get antibodies, show danger spreading virus anyone else (or least less danger). considering that, mandate show vaccine positive Covid test 2 weeks old?

Without fail, there's always gaggle slack jawed morons can't figure procedure act like recent development. Technically could stopped covid *without* vaccines. like w/ vaccines, human nature got way. 

Vaccines, *by far* effective, one part defense, BTW. getting manufactured, many, many proven preventative measures policies individuals, businesses, governments that, tandem w/ vaccines, lessen opportunity spreading thereby opportunity devastating variants. That's though, lessen opportunity. That's insane. America feel ashamed always low test scores. never is. Community names? main reason couldn‚Äôt open Canada only, also allow Mexico ‚Ä¶ took longer. Horses get ivermectin instead. can't afford $17/yr situation need pass tsa travel anyway. might using Afghans!  Except none programs available citizen greencard holder. Fuck, love flying back home airport security actively exist harass you. (and none ""take shoes"" bullshit) staff angriest, aggressive agency government full antivaxxers? Who‚Äôd guessed. companies contribute 401k well? two streams pension UK, state pension basically enough die, private pensions, self fund also attract employer contributions. Except citizen greencard holder can't get Pre get shown exactly little US government cares you.  know play season mode nhl get like 2029-2030 season see cpu generated prospects like Jimmy Ovechkin Brad Tootoo. always thought lazy.

Alternative title ‚Äúdumb fucks consider leaving city raising average IQ‚Äù busy next week going S1 S2 subunits figuring chemical affinity binding hACE2. infectiousness Delta dies guarantee antivaxxers get covid endemic level spread eventually setting in, one going able really hide it.

This pointed often. Yes, SARS-CoV-2 endemic going continue circulating, vaccines not. Unless people able effectively isolate, going get infected point without vaccine, people bad time. 

I'm supportive mandates. People able make choices pay them. Either higher health insurances directly treatments. Sometimes even lives.  people know best much theatre politics surprised trust you? country think won‚Äôt expect vaccine move there? odds surviving fully recovering monumentally better vaccinated, though.

Monumentally. got J&amp;J I'm extremely satisfied, almost side effects. boosters, I'd inclined get J&amp;J again, want see data durability immunity J&amp;J offers compared mRNA vaccines, well difference immune response type ie parts immune systems activated.  getting immunity hard way lot likely leave crippled dead.

The stats vaccinated people dying covid small.

Over 6 billion people vaccinated earth. Give stats ones die fully vaccinated, percentage 6 billion, okay? 


Getting w/out vaxxed, well yeah, crippled dead big possibility happening already couple months ago easy get country either (Australia). plenty Astra Zeneca vaccines, health authorities discouraged use small risk complications, difficult actually get one. enough Pfizer shots, Moderna. Nothing else approved use. Since last month largely changed, people able get, least book, vaccination get Pfizer shot. Unfortunately vaccines came couple months late. two populous states Australia outbreaks Delta strain since July. we'd vaccines couple months earlier states might avoided outbreaks. state I'm still ~60% adults vaccinated, covid (yet); hopefully reach 80%+ spreads control here. JnJ seven months ago. I: 

- Wait booster guidance JnJ out
- Go Pfizer Moderna now? pope said get vaccinated. Catholic Church democracy! It‚Äôs got one guy authority make declaration said get vaccinated. Every Catholic knows this. better pocket knife. I've carried entire flatware sets edged knives dozens times.

One time flying flatware set, stopped take look ice cream scoop. took bad aside, opened it, looked scoop, put back let go. Honestly, I'm surprised low is. Australia, we've pretty slow rollout since vaccine doses. Even then, Canberra 95% first dose 12+ 69% fully vaccinated. NSW 16+, 90+% first dose 75+% fully vaccinated. seems anti-vax movement much stronger US. 30% population fringe?  I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs miserable job it‚Äôs government job. Pension, good healthcare, good benefits. stay like 5 years get free healthcare rest life. That‚Äôs lot give shot. It‚Äôll *almost* never happen. unofficial general strike + 40% losses due virus/idiots? can‚Äôt run industry without employees. Oh security theater league would expected be? mostly get 401ks now, 401k defined contribution, pension defined benefit.  say homelessness America could solved for, like, cost one week war Afghanistan. Personally think works good thing, see practice, take rosy glasses, might work well end ghettos stuff.

But that's try build cheapie accommodation poor people live inner city towers. 

But imagine had, say, 80 years advanced warning one day old people need house, old people going ""them"", going you, make nice houses nice areas drop less bombs.

Imagine that.... father law accidentally brought pocket knife security. First airport didn‚Äôt notice second did. It‚Äôs worth it‚Äôs kind gov building get quizzed for. option get free credit card perk lazy could easily take hour. vAccInE mUtAtEs InSiDe aNiMAlS??? sense hostility anger. need hug?

Seriously though, that's terrible tale. Lol people pension anymore. People working white collar jobs corporations education likely investment plan company contributes (401k/403b). People pay taxes eventually eligible social security though. also disagree. Four family members got Moderna vaccine (at different times locations different batches), four got Covid, two hospitalized one passed away. experience, people vaccinated false sense security won‚Äôt take precautions public unvaccinated people would, therefore likely get Covid. $250 woo long ago, airport employees passengers could smoke airport.

Of course Tsa around then, unfair stopped allowing that?

Of course not, harming around them, ""basic human rights"" go right trash.

Leaving aside fact disband tsa, one entitled job there. want work, option available elsewhere, 2 quick shots. tested positive 7 days first dose. I‚Äôm curious puts scale immunity. Exactly. Yet many suckers pay anyway. ""a fool money..."" TSA GS (yet, they're trying change that)

A tightly wound stack trading cards appear medium-dark orange material. shaken cards change color much. result likely flagged screening. things like peanut butter, yogurt, cheese etc almost always flagged well.

With said, TSA org useless. I‚Äôm shedding light X-ray techs treat things way do. Federal workers get pensions. done away 80s. Basic human rights?

I'm petty would make change minds anyway.   I'm little confused, see comment suggested Covid could eradicated better vaccination. I've edited original comment clarify that. 

Even Delta, knew universal human vaccination would ""eradicate"" Covid, highly zoonotic, jumps species easily. 

As far I'm concerned, European studies mink outbreak Denmark fall 2020 demonstrated Covid-19 would never eliminated cross-infects humans Mustelidae (minks/ferrets/weasels) without new mutations.

But better vaccination rates would greatly reduced human casualties since April. Good fire all. TSA disbanded anyway. Use starting point.  we'll I've experienced travels sketchier parts world car going airport needs guy dog another mirror circling car looking underneath, checking trunk anything suspicious

I‚Äôve LAX lmao

Oh wait, say sketchier parts world, never mind Finally! Confirmation (at least 40% of) TSA workers stupid always believed.  basically 7x official figures. Username check out. US pension defined- benefit (we pay $X retire, based years service salary) program employer may may offer workers. used fairly common rise defined contribution 401k (we give $x based much put account, hope grow eventually help cover costs retirement). Pensions much less common now, usually found government jobs union contracts, though even getting phased big businesses able. 

We also social security, much broader retirement program workers pay taxes earned income fund current payouts.  Read article: Although Alexandra Joshua, already fully vaccinated since last  
April, concerned themselves, worried  
Sophia, 5 Lukas, 4. Oh no‚Ä¶

But company started struggle, used funds bail out, could pay back self-loan, 2008 hit went under. manage transfer money employees invested could actually invest real 401k instead boss's side gig remember dad saying $100/month turned $5/month.

Yes COVID heavily undercounted, oddly enough places like United States FAR FAR FAR closer accurate number country like India Russia.

Of let's say 1.1 million deaths way, roughly 70-90k accounted means high end deaths united states 1 million dead due COVID 30-40% official count.

Russia 3 times undercounting admitted December, Indian 3.4 - 4.4 million die Delta wave alone due covid.

You come across overly accusing others download mortality rates CDC simple excel spreadsheet factoring numbers.

First world countries much closer numbers many people actually got covid, many people actually died. still undercounted 30-90% unless major first world country simply less tests less tracking. Vectored first dose mRNA second dose best 2-dose combination (better every study that's looked them.

A careful reading arguments think comes definition ""force"". think making one's life difficult greater public good necessarily forcing anything. may claiming state creating vaccines behalf businesses forcing them, see outside scope regulation, absolutely state's role. I'm quite clear using term force though assume.

""For one, notion antibody test sufficient demonstrate alternatively acquired immunity absurd.""

Agreed.

Further, disagree claim mRNA vaccines new deployment scale, based responses thus far, I'm assuming also aware history use humans new (\~10 years now). delivery method new I'm mistaken, point things delivered scale, exactly bad time consider vaccines demonstrated highly efficacious infectivity spread 2 months vaccination, presence antibodies rapidly diminishes.

You've also read Lancet paper. Fascinating! that's boosters recommended. Frankly, get vaccine without longitudinal study best delivery (e.g. dosage, number doses, time doses, etc.). guess Pfizer made best guess 21 days prior initial trial sort stuck that. countries sorts things they're conversation regarding vaccines, framed it, entirely accurate. Vaccines administered months ago playing seriously diminished role regards epidemiological aspect pandemic, terms protecting individual actually received vaccine worst outcomes disease.

I'd argue efficacy 3 4 week apart, 2-dose vaccine ""wanes"" closer 3 4 months (your claim 2), that's interpretation risk (expressed percentage efficacy) guess. I'm quite sure getting though. saying vaccines effective thought spread, get them? Perhaps there's way vaccination alone get thing control? know particular study contagious vaccinated individuals various stages post ""fully vaccinated"", guess high - hard say. since good data. hear single study swabbed noses find Delta variant contagious vaccinated non-vaccinated, pretty narrow look viral spread and, well, single study. think pretty safe say COVID cases come whole since introduction vaccines. Since people got vaccines Spring 2020, guess we'll see soon enough.

I think we're going agree disagree ""force"", ""new"" technology, ""efficacy"" issues. think data vaccines (in general) backs fact work, enough people get ""forcing"" going nonissue. think people's anger mandates entirely political. support mandates protection family desire return ""normalcy"" (whatever hell that's going look like). argument, agree, perhaps coherent one I've heard since mandates started. spent time overseas recently, agree one-size-fits-all solution. Antibody tests, PCR tests, vaccine certificates used conjunction one another return safer society. Yeah, qualifier. diseases never really wane, wane super quick. cells b cells wane addition antibody levels. depends several factors, evidence suggests covid antibodies wane cells b cells persist (at least long able study.) Even diseases antibodies persist long term generally decline time,, completely. Immunology kind moving target way, certainly judge effectiveness vaccine solely antibody titer.

Melatonin may beneficial adjuvant therapy patients COVID-19.

Abstract
The purpose study determine effect melatonin thrombosis, sepsis, mortality rate adult patients severe coronavirus infection (COVID-19).

Methods: single-center, prospective, randomized clinical trial conducted 1 December 2020 1 June 2021 Al-Shifaa hospital Mosul, Iraq. 158 patients severe COVID-19 included study, 82 melatonin group (who received 10 mg melatonin addition standard therapeutic care), 76 control group (given standard therapeutic care only). Patients chosen blocked randomization design. physician evaluated recorded incidence thrombosis, sepsis, mortality rate days 5, 11, 17 symptoms.

Results: intervention group consisted 82 patients, control group consisted 76 patients. comparison control group, thrombosis sepsis developed significantly less frequently (P &lt; 0.05) melatonin group second week infection, mortality significantly higher control group (P &lt; 0.05).

Conclusions: Adjuvant use Melatonin may help reduce thrombosis, sepsis, mortality COVID-19 patients.   change fact still large population morons vaccinated whi stupid enough leave mandates think New York would open welcoming fully vaxxed 42 year old Toronto. I'd happy replace stupid conspiracy nuts. New York favorite city I've visited I‚Äôm talking about. nasty giving ‚Äúlol ok‚Äù‚Äôs isn‚Äôt discussion conversation. 

I said hinted outsmarting anyone anything. I‚Äôm trying nice compassionate humans. Listening reasons things way educate move forward. 

Instead, constantly find watching people shit eachother rather educate, it‚Äôs quite disheartening real telling future hold. don‚Äôt believe snide nasty person, way here? social media brownie points? Right? 'did research' whatever lame argument people use days. would lot stuff morally opposed $16M.

Funniest shit day.  funny: upstate NY people get bent shape say ""the city"" ask like *outside* tri-state area say ""New York"", people assume mean New York City, meaning Manhattan boroughs. 

But, live boroughs think people say borough name tri-state.

But, write address NY, NY people automatically say, ""From Manhattan?""

Weird.

Which reminds me: remember uproar 646 began replacing 212 numbers. 212 like Steve Martin finding white pages. First never said vaccine end pandemic 6 months. argued shorten it, said won't. disingenuous. basic mathematical equation, reducing cases wide margin reduces spread wide margin, reducing needless hospitalizations deaths.

Second all, invoking 1 shot withheld US = 1 shot administered Africa. argument want make, cut bullshit say is. people, including Scott G, administration, etc. believe that's actually plays out. I'm going go that, read discussion linked post.

Lastly pulling lot things bunghole. know multiplier booster increases antibodies second shot. assume linear regression, shot might easily become annual longer shot. stop ""you need new booster every 6 months"" bullshit, that's antivaxx talk. one knows this. suspect could easily 3 done situation, annual shot part annual flu shot. fucking know it.

Your argument fucking dumb. give ""for now"" hope better ""later"". First nasal vaccines developed regardless. manage get shit control without them, that's fucking WIN. don't, we'll them, them. also therapeutics coming online. calling quits needless infections, needless spread, needless hospitalizations, needless deaths. reason? ""concentrate better vaccines""?

BRAH.  took 10 days, I‚Äôm finally mostly back normal! feel need tell us fully vaccinated? Cool opinion. 
Too bad rights US aren‚Äôt absolute don‚Äôt right willfully spread disease.

Google says averages around 41k. 50k+ apparently supervisor territory there. need ugh. perception J&amp;J's efficacy skewed articles portray similarities differences right. Basically reason J&amp;J appears less effective higher dosage. know, sounds counterintuitive taken consideration get 1 higher dosed jab instead 2 lower dosed ones makes sense. Basically efficacy Delta based high antibody count higher overall dosage end higher antibody count therefore effective protection. natural J&amp;J would profit booster two lower overall dosage. basically Biontech/Moderna achieve 3 jobs, J&amp;J 2. it? essentially vaccine. mRNA sequence that's transported body.

Last year yes, lower undercount since fiction obvious. example, july/aug/sep 2021 excess deaths totalled 196k, official covid toll 70k.

Wouldn't surprised they've decided let daily official figures go four figures.   whole department theater anyway. Still wonder need them. I'm high income EU country universal healthcare. mean free healthcare, means everyone assured access.

We pay drugs, people pay routine healthcare too, although caps, example maximum charged drugs per month, government covers it; there's set maximum charged per day hospital, there's also max per year, etc.

We pay dental, pay primary care, direct GP private businesses.

Lower income people pass means test get fees covered, pay fees. people pay healthcare. capped can't get like ‚Ç¨1 million bill, happen. still pay routine healthcare, unless broke, goes well pensioners well, pay too.

I think works pretty well. think works better US system. throw universal healthcare necessarily mean everything free point care, that's one model probably even common one, lot countries universal care people actually pay. assured able pay, costs constrained something affordable.

Abstract 
This paper empirically examines opening K‚Äì12 schools associated spread COVID-19 using county-level panel data United States. preliminary evidence, event-study analysis indicates cases deaths counties in-person hybrid opening relative remote opening substantially increased school opening date, especially counties without mask mandate staff. main analysis uses dynamic panel data model case death growth rates, control dynamically evolving mitigation policies, past infection levels, additive county-level state-week ‚Äúfixed‚Äù effects. analysis shows increase visits K‚Äì12 schools colleges associated subsequent increase case death growth rates. estimates indicate fully opening K‚Äì12 schools in-person learning associated 5 (SE = 2) percentage points increase growth rate cases. also find association K‚Äì12 school visits in-person school openings case growth stronger counties require staff wear masks schools. findings support policies promote masking precautionary measures schools giving vaccine priority education workers. really worry. J&amp;J +mRNA combo might best J&amp;J booster still *incredibly* effective. issues too. last private company worked fulltime becoming state employee well financially became apparent one former coworkers noticed 401K match deposited. owner matching employees contribution even depositing employees contribution! basically stealing employees. came clean financial issues caught make everybody whole put deposits along employer contribution.

The best part though, got busted let everybody go closed couple labor intensive pieces company. sending email friends letting know would okay company completely closing. owners three homes sell either four story beach house lake house, thankfully. doom scrolled covid forever. people actually still that? professions law enforcement security lowest vaccine compliance rates? Ironic? like government jobs I've worked get degree preference already system. 

So ya put years hopping ""real"" government job.  J&amp;J basically vaccine mRNA vaccines. also mRNA vaccine name. difference J&amp;J uses adenovirus vector distribute mRNA sequence Biontech/Moderna use lipid capsules. That's pretty much difference. Except course dosage 1 dosis. higher J&amp;J. That's enough get 1 jab J&amp;J. also higher dosage combined 1 jab explains people got J&amp;J profit booster others. ups antibodies higher rate compared Biontech/Moderna already higher 2 jabs administered. people would gotten 2 jabs J&amp;J see advantage booster shot. matter one. fairness, switching US, rising vaccination rates among Black Americans. 

Most Black Americans vaccine hesitant, antivaxxers. matter getting messaging communities sources trusted, like doctors, pastors, high regarded figures. And, unfortunately, many also found hard way loved ones passed away. difference is, however, also seemed spread word get vaccinated extended friends family groups. None keeping quiet keep peace crap we're seeing people got vaccinated loss.  already hire anyone get  someone Moderna teacher household, ü§ûü§û

But I'm worried. think Moderna booster data presented safety antibody levels, much direct efficacy like Israeli booster data? Pfizer booster occupational exposure actually get CDC advisory panel. CDC Director overruled.

We see... Kids flu vaccine. aren‚Äôt able vaccinated covid yet. invested poorly, always option people.

Pretty hard invest poorly unless try actively trade 401k, take risk.

S&amp;P 500 solid returner past 40+ years. We'll information day tomorrow, FDA/CDC meetings. many idiots positions power? 5-11 isn‚Äôt approved yet. 5 hasn‚Äôt even asked approval yet.

The whole purpose TSA stop bombings nothing else. 99.99% people aren‚Äôt bombing trying take plane, prevet that‚Äôs great. 

I don‚Äôt really think TSA great job, argue even worth having, least solution gets gate minutes walking times vs dealing seasonal timely rush.

they may retirement savings (IRA/401k) saved

they may pension worked job (union/city/state)

one thing note social security dried within next 30ish years. neve planned boomers booming, boomers want pay keep going. draining gen x, millenials, gen z paying benefit it. ever worked job protected union? asking, hating. Wow, imagine recommending Moderna booster J&amp;J people. 

It highest gains lowest side effects, assuming reading right. Although J&amp;J + Pfizer pretty close too. 

J&amp;J + J&amp;J seems pretty lackluster data. going go trouble booster seems better recommend one mRNA vaccines. Can't wait see whole data set. think Medicaid covers required stay alive old person US, please ask old person Medicaid. every meaningful way UK actual safety net seniors buy fuckin cat food live. doesn‚Äôt count pension doesn‚Äôt cover basic human dignity.   state pensions UK enough live off, like social security US. cases saving either pension retirement savings plan top expected government plan.

If work TSA getting paid private pension plan, like teachers get UK. replaces them? anyone get police? pull GM vs. New GM drop pensions debt old company let sink.  Thanks! looking this.  comes good govt benefits We'll soon find little 40% actually matter. Maybe without them.  Neither gov't population give \_\_\_ covid. Like 1 100 actually wear masks, fine come work cold symptoms. suppose like half country kind vacation summer, Crimea Turkey, sped virus spreading even further.

Many people claim ""I'm antivaxxer, simply decided yet"". mean, vaccines freely available everyone like 8 10 months. ignorance beyond understanding.

His smell taste went away last week 5 months initial infection. covid test negative. noticed toothpaste started tasting like rotten peanut butter went together.  

Covid weird. speak myself, important would go concerned. something wanted get of, might drop covid excuse (a little bit kidding).

Point is, nothing seems agree other. state reporting higher vax world does, world reports different US percentage main page US page (which drill down). Even state showing different number too. I've even seen different vaccination rates US different pages too. countries....

Is due population issues (when estimate taken). also location vaccine administered (not everyone got vaccine home county/state/country.

Also, there's reason personal reporter around (I saw comment). take long hit headlines get informed. enable people part stay informed. fact, I'm sure takes longer hear quickly skim headlines read couple articles themselves. educator circle awhile. gets annoying, word mouth, matter diligent are, muddies reporting, leaves citations sources, also encourages get information non-journalist sources random people online. 

Lastly, think important get weeds numbers trends affects personally. aggressive autoimmune disease mom severe cancer. helpful know many people city county getting Covid track weekly new numbers come out. someone at-risk, long vaccinated follow precautions, there's reason armchair data analyst.

Add interactions cop going level adversarial, (I.E. thing wrong, Cop must apply legal discipline wrong thing) stress parties get pretty high. Cops getting trashed day ""Karens"" even getting run-off stress reasonable person late X upset general, interaction unpleasant. re-enforces bad image civilian has, officer gets sour image protect, lead becoming bad cop.

There also bad policies departments bound follow discriminate allow discrimination run rampant. 

The problem parties (in broad terms) valid points, like every issue, complicated. easy fix, gets turbulent trying fix issues various groups allow emotional rhetoric, however earned, rule dialogue. 

My take lot reform needs doing, occur departmental level since policy seems reside. also need realize cops humans too, flaws positives come human. need see good chunk police force great people adversarial position treat kindly show great people. need drop hammer cops abusing power, need accountability every side. think body cams cops dashcams cars great way helping that.

I really understand want get it? We've already got lot vaccines body covid happened. Need vaccines attend school. Firstly, speak Muslims, that's absurd. I'm going entertain idea let's move on. Secondly, ""Arabic words"", Al Qaeda explicitly terrorist organization. one talking Muslims here, one group happens Muslim, US war recently linked famous terrorist attack modern times.

The joke people behave like Muslims, behave like terrorists.

Al Qaeda certainly exempt criticism mockery. totally bizarre thing claim. People saying white American terrorists middle eastern terrorists increase violence middle east, quite opposite. part growing sentament American domestic terrorism higher priority bombing middle east.

The whole joke hinges fact white terrorists middle eastern terrorists better other. huge stretch declare bigotted sentament.

You know bigotted sentament? idea Al Qaeda extremist groups way linked way vast majority Muslims are. say making fun Al Qaeda bigotted Muslims saying making fun KKK making fun Americans, making fun IRA making fun Irish people. No, bigotted aspect person see difference extremist group general population people share something whether national origin religion. one you.

Al Qaeda organization worth defending. one calling people Muslims, they're calling terrorists. Muslim mean one criticize you. There's lot Al Qaeda islamist beliefs.

Given unvaxxed nurses fired soon, would good eventually able increase numbers new nurses. Largely vaccine hesitancy caused fear side effects, low trust distrust authorities. Supply problem 6 months mRNA vaccines widely available throughout country. overly optimistic attitude pandemic certainly help either (our prime minister famously claimed June ""the pandemic over"" Alpha retreat, Delta beginning become dominant Romania cases lowest since beginning pandemic, statement met huge derision months later). there's pervasive mindset vaccines somehow harm good lots people refusing ""nobody guarantee long-term side effects"".

Stupidity breeds stupidity, think know that. I'd assume issues. vial contains 10-15 doses, anything different aside giving half normal dose. Unethical? Probably. honestly, it‚Äôs completely line numbers wise- means work enough overtime hit double time versus time half. either work 12 hours single shift, work many days row overtime. you‚Äôve worked 7 days row, overtime 8 hours paid double.

Now, officer, assuming they‚Äôre actually working paid hours, useful working much? sincerely doubt that. areas, 24-48hours CDC-ACIP decision.

Waning really even consideration this. think wrong decision give up.

I'm pretty sure decision, zero-covid longer possible. Right, doesn‚Äôt explain tougher Pfizer Pfizer meeting. I‚Äôm pleased result, would figured less data less compelling presentation moderna would lead tougher response committee, wasn‚Äôt much case. ""Protect Serve?

You're protected even get booster. Immunity vaccine wanes disappear. friends talk doom covid time. Told basically I‚Äôll catch next year.

Someone ""cold"" spouse's workplace. spouse one showed concern concern COVID - one even entertaining possibility; bizarre. Never mind fact everyone works (minus spouse) attended wedding one coworkers. That's good question. non-expert understanding, antibody levels likely accurate proxy protection infection spread slower B cells likely better proxy protection hospitalization death. think full answers question years decades though.

My personal theory since Delta strikes fast, pushes protection hospitalization bit onto antibodies B cells might running fast enough. would explain J&amp;J's hospitalization protection tanking (I've recently seen low 60% efficiency) protection death isn't. compassionate that's perfectly human.

The poster right though compassion exercise greater influence bringing facts. Nyc means 5 boroughs (even begrudgingly staten island).

Also jobs TSA highly sought after. people working seem careless apathetic repetitive labor hard get fired it.  questionnaire literally ""Do X disease think need one"" literally go walk get one, six months nothing stopping you.  figured since gave Moderna dose booster needed quickly others. makes sense standpoint recent data I've seen suggests Moderna still highly effective 6 months larger doses administered. someone who's Team Moderna I'm glad still going strong 6 months ready when/if boosters needed future. looking origins?

2) Shorten incubation long person contagious 30-50%, much smaller event get infected. 

Both things directly help community family less likely get sick (and need take time work), less likely infect others, less likely need hospital resources, less likely incubate transmit new variant. even close good statement. saying people get help others around them. makes zero sense.

There's kinda hidden anti-vax movement among cops getting much light despite serious complication. I'm Chicago police union president flat-out told cops defy mandate force mayor's hand suspend them.

If ever doubt loyalties get news ""facts"", dispel it. Make mistake. Many idiots present Jan 6th. Oh no, stop zero terrorists without them? probably even less 1 7l try link again? seem go anywhere. remind they're minority. Hardly anyone wears masks go walking jogging anymore.

You know many people killed commercial aviation accidents US past 10 years? 4 (3 Asiana 214, 1 Southwest 1380 anyone wondering). Meanwhile, 30,000 people die car accidents every year one thinks twice getting behind wheel.

Both parents vaccinated COVID-19 April.

All 4 family went go get flu shots together early October.

How exactly figure anti-vax?

/u/Stinkycheese8001 Survival thing vaccinated people worried about, they're also concerned long covid. got infected back January could even get vaccine, 9 months later still distorted taste/smell, brain fog, occasional shortness breath.

If Fauci would consider plan:

Start healthy + previously vaccinated people expose viral load (large enough make sure creates immune response) paired Merek‚Äôs pill (to inhibit virus‚Äôs ability replicate). Check antibodies before/after. goes well scale people.

However don‚Äôt see gaining support because:

1) country quite divided. anti vax folks use approval ignore Covid reason skip vax. 

2) much effort put getting people take Covid seriously. Telling people safe way experience Covid would break peoples brain.

I've seen estimates 7 million range, I've also seen estimates too. likely strong confidence interval many years now.

It also important remember two pandemics killed many people roughly 8 months flu _season_. COVID-19 going close 24 months.

The intensity pandemic also factor gauging severity places larger strains public health system. really is. Go 'Murica, though, act like highschool cheerleader. America trash pit  Anti-vax (and conspiracies) proxy low trust institutions - medical, gov't, corps. Makes sense Russians trust gov't, even legit trying protect them. 

Same reason many black community anti-vax - trust gov't treated poorly centuries?  want too.

That's entitlement. true all.  Well maybe limit week, usually check things couple minutes day anyways really much good. Basically I'm waiting good news come end, dont like read doom stuff thats usually whats there. peak pandemic stop reading all, maybe hour day, anxiety horrible. think even need check it, good news comes I'll see even check week minutes think mean ""JUST GIVE NEAREST TRASH CAN""  amount terrorists would apprehended 40% fired. 100%. ever spend years helping someone immigration system, see attitudes (but worse).

In addition ACA, believe exists Reagan-era law hospitals accepting Medicaid, must ER accept work stabilize everybody regardless ability pay. get rid covid collaborators muder-suiciding fellow citizens attacking hospital system.

Also understand it, employers much country fire anybody will. So, ""please provide vaccination proof"" ""Don't want provide? Well like face, fired."" There's pattern forming mandates.

1. Mandate comes out
2. people affected mandates throw tantrum.
3. Deadline approaches, stories come media vast percentages affected still unvaccinated.
4. people mandate get vaccine last minute realize Loosing Job BS microchips.
5. Deadline passes, compliance may shortages isolated incidents, part mass walkoffs anti-vaxxers keep prophesying never appear. people entitled work want take vaccine?

I mean.... government worker interact public part job required vaccinated highly contagious disease pandemic? Everyone useful already working. yeah world rteally bad right need revolution. never understood discussion boosters. regulatory agencies seem hell bent treating boosters last resort; something avoided costs.

Now point people filling spots comes curious standpoint. already low supply people applying officers recent events lack respect. Cops used respectful job that‚Äôs whole different conversation. less people looking police officers, pay used states, rules come place exposure inner workings (which always bad thing, makes uncomfortable). 

I think point people rise within fill spots 100%! happens star football player gets injured retires? Someone else steps chance become great! It‚Äôs going interesting see lower standards work less.

Someone made great point splitting work require police handle jobs think real answer. Fine tune less ‚Äúone tool jobs‚Äù land. Spent 5 hours ER waiting room last week, even really want fear COVID. Unfortunately, ended admitted night. That's pretty uncommon given many people I've seen say problem vs did. Pretty crazy actually calling check.

Depending state might able take advantage requiring ID can't look all. surrendered pay prices    things get better 

That's problem, right - things better. Easy enough settle empirically court.  STOP RESISTING! asking good faith.

OP obviously meant ""rolling back mandates prior things getting better"", happened Texas, Florida, Dakotas, etc.

Don't pedantic internet use brain.  think anyone trying **roll back** block mandates

So San brain, need mandates restrictions forever, regardless case counts?   power brewery. could help brewery somehow I'd it. still case offer keep players someone else offer Free Agency, right?

So burning bridges Nets even ends somewhere else max level contract, fewer dollars unless Nets sign trade. brought attention upset conservatives leaving fake 1 star reviews places ""political."" hypocrisy hilarious Reading would help, lol. Identifying possible sources pandemic would help us reduce chance happening future. extremely high value.

Identifying intermediate species would let us study sars-cov-2's evolution within species. Theoretical research type typically tremendous value...eventually.

Proving disproving lab-leak theory value political, course thing China concerned here. 6 months. Though doubt able schedule one yet booster dose different strength Dose 1 2.

Not need go next phases process location need get booster supply hands. wouldnt vote comment. spot on. 

But cycle break? cops crack see offenders arrest escape prosecution? cops step back let criminals kill dead? cops concede certain areas criminals protecting areas? 

No easy answers see.  Still symptoms 6 months hospitalization, headline quite misleading, would indicate unvaxed almost one fully vaccinated April. Kremlin blamed rising toll Russia‚Äôs slow vaccination campaign appealed people get shot. Take-up slow, many Russians citing distrust authorities fear new medical products.  know day CDC meeting is? Anectdotal, caught Delta (August) vaccinated (may), suffered mild (highest fever 101 day) symptoms quarantined home. wife, also vaccinated (may), stayed separate room, wore mask home left said room. 5 days symptoms gone, 10 days tested negative.

My wife get sick, never tested positive, testing every 7 days month sure.

ps- Sense smell returned, balance back too! simple rule talk vaccines. take vaccines offered approved local health authorities.

Any vaccine save proven track record fighting covid better vaccine. mean, snacking would disappear everything tasted like doggie doo.

Sure, worth it?

Good food (and drink) one life's absolute greatest pleasures. could live 90 food taste bad 75 sense taste, I'd take second option without thinking twice. No, 6 months. article.  people died vaccinated? people get vaccinated medical condition caught disease died? That's hoping would happen. Hopefully rest steps move quickly follow recommendations people start getting boosted. great news, wife (nurse) received second dose Moderna January. 
I know shown effective stopping infection altogether would huge win  &amp; Johnson asked Food Drug Administration issue emergency use authorization booster recipients vaccines, panel vote Friday company‚Äôs request. also hear initial results ongoing federal study found Johnson &amp; Johnson recipients may benefit booster Moderna‚Äôs Pfizer‚Äôs vaccine. Later Thursday, committee discuss, vote on, whether consider broader eligibility boosters Pfizer Moderna‚Äôs vaccines, allowing people younger 65 especially high risk get them. Alrighty, well I‚Äôm getting phone right away get mine scheduled.

If vaccine works way supposed lessens chance death people danger choose get vaccinated. right take risk like anybody else's right get vaccinated. endangering anyone themselves

Looks like antibody levels almost double Pfizer-Pfizer case.

My worry myocarditis extreme side effect. ever go back pre-9/11 flying? Yea....it's pretty sad people Willing get poke blocked can't make damn minds meanwhile sitting ducks hoping stay healthy said repeatedly thread, discuss J&amp;J boosters tomorrow. would NYT removing paywall covid articles Appreciate tips help! Geez, usually try guild lily autobiography, unless likes brag a, whatever is. Hey now! I'd like take opportunity state appreciation folk's cheese curds partying abilities. Top notch shit. Seems like got good folks there. Sincerely, Michigander that's visited playing road. get it. update soon hope okay. know like patients like that, bedside nurse can‚Äôt get away easily. know wouldn‚Äôt made past 2 years without nurses. new floors pre pandemic, taught lot too, looked kept heads water. Look take care yourself! often throw work much detriment mental health. Maybe Moderna much less data Pfizer referencing huge amount Israeli data. Yup. #1 cause death 2020 2021 police. Moderna‚Äôs unanimous vote Thursday, **committee member Dr. Patrick Moore said data company submitted authorization booster ‚Äúwas well explained,‚Äù adding voted yes ‚Äúgut feeling.‚Äù**  data strong, certainly going direction supportive vote,‚Äù said.

Why earth would publicly say something like that? HCA sub surprisingly therapeutic though. NYC battle hardened,

I think need quantify statement somehow. trying jerk, need evidence somehow people complain trip Queens Manhattan somehow hardy warriors seen all. Exactly. easy filler. Woo dad got moderna definitely needs booster hype suffered mild (highest fever 101 day) symptoms 

oh ps- Sense smell returned, balance back too!

oh no, view losing sense balance mild :/. headed straight dictator territory crazy laws ""I work children"" really. point starting cop makes 2-3x base pay?

Yes. Overtime basically unlimited largely unregulated.

It's clear words idea talking comes realities working law enforcement. throw bunch nonsense comparisons think reason relevant discussing realities. care kind devil's advocate comparisons arguments want try make professions. fact becoming cop INCREDIBLY easy, especially considering strength union makes nearly impossible get fired, rate pay, low educational training requirements. 

Finding new people take places incredibly difficult low bar high level financial return. Take nonsense elsewhere.  get flu shot time booster. 2 week window previous doses differentiate side effects. think advantage flu like symptoms know probably covid. Yep. live high cost living area, even base pay, starting wage akin large number careers require 4 year degree. higher many.

After OT, many make huge amount money college grads could dream of.

Now, live city that‚Äôs relatively dangerous- police rarely actually get involved. It‚Äôs relatively well known they‚Äôre useless here, even assuming ever show all, debatable, often don‚Äôt get involved. complaints bring understaffing‚Ä¶ personally, makes roll eyes, even including benefits could add two officers removing OT pay these. know it‚Äôs multifaceted issue there, it‚Äôs important bring up- yeah, police officers one highest paid public positions especially look training education needed. Social workers often face dangerous situations (and often more), many positions require even Master‚Äôs degrees, yet city end making far less, starting wage lower, generally don‚Äôt receive OT. 5000 cases week sounds bad consider USA 40M people get flu year normal conditions (no restrictions).

That equates 12% population, 770,000 cases week.

The population New Zealand 5M people 12% population 600,000 11500 per week flu. SARS2 spreads easier faster influenza.

So, puts perspective case load, assuming everyone gets mild case gets tested. First off, discussion early mid September. LOT changed since comes need boosters. number studies come showing notable drop effectivity hospitalization death 65+ population. Israeli data presented Pfizer Moderna booster meetings clear reduced efficacy. 

Second, broad approval EVERYONE receive boosters. Instead, approval specific categories based upon either reduced efficacy (65+) risk severe COVID either due comorbidities due institutional/occupational exposure. People flippant anxiety depression... amazing quickly conditions ""snap"" facing scary debilitating symptoms make wonder gonna die continue undermine quality life. many people discussions hand-wave anxiety depression long covid concerns count something.

I similar situation 2 doses Pfizer, hoping get 3rd dose Moderna.

Even forget card, able check database verify got Pfizer, thereby insist 3rd dose Pfizer ONLY?  Wisconsin here, Kirk Bangstad pretty dope. me. literally know single person age group (early 30s) younger visits actual publication‚Äôs websites...I‚Äôm tired. brain damage?  That‚Äôs primary goal.

My primary goal maximum protection contracting disease, FDA‚Äôs decision aligns desire. bravo, FDA! infection rates ‚âà10-fold lower booster versus nonbooster group (ranging 8.8-17.6 across five age groups) 4.8-11.2 fold lower secondary analysis. **Severe illness rates primary secondary analysis 18.7-fold (95% CI, 15.7-22.4) 6.5-fold (95% CI, 5.1-8.3) lower ages 60+, 22.0-fold (95% CI, 10.3-47.0) 3.2-fold (95% CI, 1.1-9.6) lower ages 40-60. ages 60+, COVID-19 associated death rates 14.7-fold (95% CI, 9.4-23.1) lower primary analysis 4.8-fold (95% CI, 2.8-8.2) lower secondary age groups**, rates confirmed infection **and severe illness substantially lower among received booster dose BNT162b2 vaccine.**

And presented FDA meeting probably silly question dosing impact quickly roll out? simple taking little less vials already have? find 4,600 guns checkpoints year, 2019's record 4,400.

How would know still suffering symptoms 6 months later?  shame J&amp;J vaccine could get seemingly forgotten two big vaccines got popular. hope gets approved J&amp;J boosters start rolling soon. Okay, guess makes slightly sense. Still concerning. effort made, starting late 90's, trick middle class thinking 401k + social security would enough people retire comfortably on. 

My FiL Nissan pension, MiL Autozone pension, mom career public education comfortable retirement measly 401k. thanks! sounds ok certainly care OP lying others, lie themselves. Yeah, ""We talk boosters focus getting first doses"". pick one other. really. realize opinion based purely anecdote, distrust unions I'm sure said get post deleted, want try I'm genuinely curious think strong economy bad.

I'm anticipating final wave hopefully things finally start settle off.   Teeth luxury bones.

Same reason vision covered Thanks letting us know. I‚Äôm probably taking mine flight holidays. K, let go cause massive lines airports across country (probably areas way others). Mandate vaccination everywhere eventually achieve equilibrium ""undecided"" eventually cave get vaccinated, continue hold stable jobs, allowed travel, become new norm. defiant remainder minority grumpy, malcontents left find odd jobs form isolated communities.

To put perspective, NYC population 8.5 million, 8000 cases / week, much higher population density, higher hospital capacity, higher testing capacity, widespread masking. Hey, guys, know, actual principle behind opposition mandate. ginning outrage, nothing else.
