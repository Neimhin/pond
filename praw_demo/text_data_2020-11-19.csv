0,2020-11-19," Inshallah  wonder president science-denier take credit this? see German PSA calling couch potatoes heroes? Except they’re finding immunity short-lived Lol nah I’m wearing mask get vaccinated don't. Virtue signalers like like pretend do. ""Of"", ""with"". That's conspiracy theory phrasing. also might mass false positives, considering high total infections getting death rate rising much much slower pace  won’t year, probably days. 655,000 cancer deaths year ~1800 deaths day. Covid already covered several individual days likely cover whole bunch days next months. going similar subreddit global warming desperately looking good news tag innovations fight informative rate transmission schools. reminiscent beginning year everyone said needed wash hands China welding citizens shut apartments Wuhan. take aerosol scientist figure COVID19 airborne. literally account whether child breakfast morning LOL please construct incomplete arguments replying posts. Except emerge Australia. came hotel quarantine, ie someone brought home overseas. leaked community quarantine worker.

So strain definitely elsewhere world. Responsible adults do. Patriots do. permanent? lot talk COVID immunity ""expiring"" 3 months, enough could contract virus second time. vaccines effect? so, would imagine everyone, regardless past contraction take vaccine.  It’s good thing used real names, know, see real fuckheads world. 
Rot hell fucking pieces shit. Thanks USA vaccine development! one would like see death greeting kiss. Especially cultures females expected it. Even really touching cheeks. interesting thing Oxford mass public may getting sooner others Healthcare workers high priority candidates already round Moderna/Pfizer. general public may get best one option widely available.  makes think, much overlap people think virus isn’t serious/hoax/etc people preparing zombie apocalypse?  according one estimate, 40% north dakota covid covid don’t know anything Munson, Duke Lifepoint owns Marquette’s hospital largest one here. wife nurse OSF Escanaba, one part group based Illinois.

From hear wife, they’re completely booked beds available Escanaba. call throughout try find beds, it’s story everywhere else here. What’s worse nurse shortage, they’re taking patients be. make even worse, administration hospital ready handle safely it’s around cluster time. really feel bad her, knows signed became nurse wants help. 

Curtis still enjoy, stay safe then! many people grocery store? upper NY pretty close unless count wearing mask normal really starting take step back. We’ll tear cell membranes... apart ICU: 15,350 (+499) - New deaths: 1,869

That roughly means 10% people ICU died yesterday, replaced larger number people.  said I’m china’s rise. It’s great pulled many people poverty. I’ve given speeches topic. What’s great throwing peaceful dissidents jail. allowing legal representation dissidents. Jail without trial. Cultural genocide Tibet Xinjiang. Putting people camps. Threatening dissidents seas. What? be? masks terribly stupid there? look seven day moving average, 1,260. Yes, US probably hit weeks, average hit 400k mark then. know [Smithfield , least, misled government much pork storage could remain open ship China. businesses beyond shady. Again, expected business depends animal human cruelty mass scale.  true, stop fear mongering expert, I've heard mink strain that's news lately cannot pass humans. think herd immunity thing. elderly man know caught second time now. First time shook relatively easy, second time kicking ass. I’m Friendsgiving friends rather family...just young people eating together. don’t really care get covid going stay away others 2 weeks. tell texter going see eyes glued phone? who? Yeah, terrible choice make 95% even mean? number even come from. Anyone source?

Ideally everyone, statistically speaking, would result randomized controlled double blinded study gave 100 people vaccine, 100 people placebo, exposed groups coronavirus. placebo control group 100% got COVID-19 test group 5% got it....

But I'm assuming case.

So 95% overstatement. wtf 95% actually mean? totally agree. I’m going get vaccine move life. virus-deniers decide do, couldn’t care less. want prolong pandemic themselves, it. That’s choice. stupid one, choice nonetheless.

I feel bad people *won’t* access stuck surrounded people refuse it. back someone pointed something thought about....

The 1918 Spanish Flu still here. We're still dealing mutations it. But...as tends happen infectious diseases time, become much less serious exposed population. Back 19th century, plain flu much serious today.

It surprise disease become endemic. also becomes much less serious.

We may annual vaccinations whatever latest mutation it. like flu/Spanish flu. He's joke. Trump 2. thats people.that tested. Probley pased 50% long agaio longer case will.get.it will.get Yeah, 7 guys entire company 4500 local employees 6000 machines. Thing is, 60% workforce onsite since March could need remotely go on-site one day week but, nope, that's culture group. working home, looked on.  don’t blame Real Upton Sinclair ‘The Jungle’ vibes remember used get downvoted saying winter would horrifying. Doooooooomer this, dooooooomer that, “its election”, “this Novemeber 4th” Don’t worry Biden takes disease disappear! Honestly west annoying, Europe boring America entitled fuck. Still, white savior rhetoric doesn’t place anywhere, shit weird. Nobody saying Chinese come west make better, crackers always think could leave west make world better olace I'll bet still look ways cross street. You’re fucking moron tested positive individuals. number inaccurate one states claiming. science seems point toward .6 death rate. said half million spring 2021 downvoted repeatedly told stupid lol. influenza death rate know there's something wrong statement, minute since learned exactly vaccines / work. cells? kind protein situation? article might useful. I'm thinking/guessing hedge mutations number participants small. study like can't considered conclusive.

When started thinking viruses sperm immediately thought Zika causes deformities. Perhaps that's worried about. Thoughts? Good. Anti-Vaxxers Plague. Literal Sense Tbf nice actually get back tiny fraction money I've giving last 15 years. retrospective study, institute Labor Economy

I see also finds infections drop immediately, know can't case due incubation period.

Hmmm, see mentions ""over next 20 also conducted lockdown.

This matter consider two regions time period, one masks without masks. also seem say happened behavioral changes take place, whatever 40-60% reduction would put lot countries well past herd immunity threshold.

The 40-60% seems growth rate infection, R_0 value. disease may R_0 different growth rate (having curve stretched time basically). think reduction growth rate would equate pushing R_0 also one lowest deaths per capita mask compliance Europe.

How relevant said before, weak studies supporting mask use, mean rush changing policies.

I think there's weak studies humanity's hand here. Masks easy cheap implement minimal downside anyway. risk advising populace follow scientific consensus result. This. Listen, severe anxiety problem. spend LOT time wringing hands dwelling what-ifs generally worrying things control over. this? I’m done. keep loved ones safe literally that’s do. spent time fretting case death wouldn’t able function. “why isn’t everyone crying killing this??” posts scratching head. panicking keep random people don’t know stupid spreading thing? panic buying TP keep hospitals overrun? learn nothing whole time?

We’ve adapted horribleness, hopefully someday soon it’s better right amount freaking change that. Nope, people upset. definitely think need give stimulus, lot people banking really shouldn’t don’t need local contract tracing force basically gave 5% positivity. Wake up. people kill millions satisfied customers every year! Many not. though. wish others would get it. 

All say is, must lot unhappy people home lives. can't stand bars out. I'm thrilled stay home myself! No, looking towards 2024 prez/VP slot needs kiss ring. live selfish society, ashamed it. We're getting approval 3 days

*3 days pass*

Oops need time

*More time*

Oops can't give date yet

...is would go bolded statement happening decades here. indirect way... (Hint: $$$) That's pretty much it. attitude pretty much ""everybody's gonna get it"", matter need true all. 

It would nice actual leadership acted right. they'd respond locking travel state, close highways border, shut train traffic necessary, say, ""Okay, well, coming lockdown control then, good luck"". 

They'd probably change tunes quick, they'd cease COVID problem. can't that, are. u sir hero. aint much rs3 need help ever lmk. world, yes? US.

But thanks. Hospitals Dakotas already transferring Montana Minnesota regularly, unfortunate surrounding states upper Midwest much better.  envy stay lockdown. Many us going sacrificial lambs economy.  Sounds awful lot like airports 9/11. gov really giving much free money... usual anyway ...why assuming trafficker Mexican?

I'm sure typical is, view ""criminal flees Mexico"" cliché fairly race-neutral. Everywhere else? looked states right now? dumb cunt going issues authorities.

I'll take harsher enforcement lockdowns letting virus spread like wildfire day.

At end day, freedoms normal life covid virtually eradicated state. That's partly thanks authorities tolerating idiocy covid deniers. hate guy people take seriously people literally fall infront them. Id say issues back Spanish Flu internet politics(more tho developed countries) simple human behavior. Since unlimited freedom states people whatever want. anything hold accountable. Sucks that's nature. bad new York did: forbid contact tracers asking large public gatherings. much enjoy watching US burn, proper healthcare, death rate general population would 0.3-1%. overcrowded hospitals, entirely reasonable think death rate would 1-2%. 

To exceed 2%, that's even possible considering younger people generally need healthcare survive, would need healthcare - none.  Inoculation involve live infectious agents. Cowpox instance inoculates smallpox risk free. certainly meets dictionary act process instance especially **:** introduction pathogen antigen living organism stimulate production antibodies 

Trust little it, opinion anyway. long term risks covid poorly known however desirable outcomes society might particular upside individual voluntary expose COVID-19. Stay safe there. I’ve watched similar bullshit “plan” government Ontario. Numbers rising fast, sure, let’s open Casinos. brands:  Omg loved book! Need re-read!  I'm likely forget reason I'm avoiding brand rather fact avoiding them. blend stupidity inhumanity required incite grown men bet lives workers factory? Nah, rate stated article **per day**.

Yesterday 16 deaths population 762,000. It’s almost point Biden would start draft instead soldiers would nurses help area. It’s unreal.  area expertise allows talk authority Fauci ready jab? spouting fear? Osrs people put cups cabinet open side guess people snort coke toilet seat. can't tell facetious since used put people trying better.

There fair trade phones available brands put emphasis fair labor however know top head.

Personally purchased broken used phone repaired it, reduce contribution unethical labor. genuinely interested trying shitty like many others, recommend looking fair trade phone companies. trying shitty hope least understand options consider going forward. I'm surprised also really sad  Today Atlantic says pandemic soon, tomorrow they’ll say pandemic gonna take hell. Fuck yo-yo clickbait bullshit really messed but... wrong. much pointless death. Everyone denies covid exists sign agreement saying since believe virus real, can't receive professional help visit hospitals. Tough shit. 55 million infections worldwide

20 reported reinfections. Pretty much everyone know Canada says take vaccine anyway.

Maybe know assholes? New Brunswick something? I'm Canadian almost everyone know counting days till get whatever vaccine approved.  Stop what? telling read article? believe second 20 Literally, entire population county 6,300 people. half square mile human. Wrap head around quit complaining county like this. Cmon. better things do. hilarious time.. ""we'll add purple, go"" hi canada poorer country Go pro? stream twitch/YouTube? thing US administer 150 million flu vaccine jabs two months. complicated sure, it’s also something world cares far about. issue isn’t going giving shots, it’s going making enough.  went for-profit healthcare provides stable income decent insurance. getting 18% from? watch doc Food Inc. won’t Tyson rest life probably won’t though.

Wait. month 

So. Categorically summer yet, Categorically 'non-obese'. 

However isolated. that, could enact border shutdowns easily airports seaports. also already strict quarantine protocols place, made easier, legislatively speaking, enforce them.

Our coastlines vastly unprotected we're geographically isolated sone huge oceans.

We share land borders countries closest neighbours; NZ Indonesia also shutdown hard. 

I originally sought discredit comment researching truth words, guess found right.

As Australian I'm proud efforts, lot going us already made efforts successful.

Thank comment changing mind guess. platinum ever give site. Thank saying this. somehow able put anger past months text. 

I lost job worked years get. Clients dwindled everything grinded halt. watched co workers, friends, get let go, saw office, full talk become quiet full empty desks. eventually time came too. move back parents back square 1. time busting ass get somewhere nothing. Why? government wanted give elderly years....

Fuck this.... Except innocent people caught crosshairs following rules best catching others aren’t taking precautions. Yeah enough people vaccinated brand-new nightclubs may may better ones before.

It's better option making elderly go extinct. Prob literally announce lockdowns? Thousands die going capacity well. Look reports El Paso. mortality rate rising. They're able give adequate care many patients may saved otherwise. Furthermore, San Antonio Houston almost capacity now. Austin already started sending staff equipment help taking flow. We're see across state. striking mean loss life. assume refusal strike also body count. Yeah call police show hour later shoot dog partner works exclusively outdoors (landscaper) zero social contact anyone since March.

I work exclusively apartment, live alone, remotely. zero social contact anyone since March.

Both us mask whenever need go somewhere time need go somewhere buy food supplies/medicine pharmacy. minimize time try go slow hours.

Some people ""doing right"".

But right, majority people fucking care less even world burns around them. corporation Probably get saliva/mucus lungs  smartphone recommend buying avoid minors exploited rare earth minerals? ever good idea? even black plague better odds 50:50 critical infrastructure stock portfolios Exactly this. two-way street. best thing I've read day. 😂

Bags TFW 🐖s exist protect capital interests. Fuck never finished book. happened next? hope masks stay western culture common cold/flu. I....don’t understand. isn’t meat. It’s made plants.  And? stay strong man I've seen lots information released states opposite. I'm going believe personal assumptions. 

Good luck med school though :) Unless government willing China /Italy /France lock happen  doctor told no.  coupon? NOCAL SOCAL two different states Damn, like Aidells. yeah, fuck them. 'Science longer suppressed' (Translation) Welcome working adult. percentage voted impeached guy. anything private gatherings likely would help slow community spread like hot spots sunset become outdoor night clubs people lined street. know 25% spread outdoor dining currently (probably cause many put tents basically indoor outside) 25% much would impact case load hopefully help hospitals 

but realistically answer national response pays people stay home. Omg thank you! I've mentioned im comments actually prediction climate change, coming increasingly apparent, never see comments this.  Scratching head little bit trying figure one amongst Australia, NZ, Taiwan would authoritarian regime. need stay home! We've got roughest 6 month ever way thought. Pandemic fatigue + winter + people thinking recipe disaster. Sadly, one listen. longer pandemic goes on, less faith humanity.  know. trying make joke original comment. vaccine comes out, I'd love first line I'll wait Spring front liners elderly get first. intelligent thing heard day. Ah yes, house broken waited 4 hours cops come refuse write police report. outside Elmhurst small hospital five blocks main road heads Elmhurst hospital. completely understand writing about. model always shit. I've said million times, original approach little plugging numbers excel hitting 'best fit'. There's dozens better ones used actual epidemiological approaches. reason model ever credibility funded big dick Bill Gates.  45 days ago, probably cruised well past 1 billion now, pushing 2b early ‘21 Literally decades propaganda designed make folks distrust public goods equate society slavery.

It's great privitization, good survival Ha, come care trying defend feelings, show miserable life capitalism. it, want hear that. Also short lived. may go weeks longer. Texas count probable cases work coed dv, sa, ht shelter. One common complaints get abuse victims police handling reports.

They show hours sometimes, result abusers becoming aggressive, fleeing. police called enough suspect fleeing fo threaten victims charges falsifying reports. tell abuse victims stay abusers. tell abuse victims fault. refuse allow abuse victims forensic exams (the collection evidence), lie victims rights. honestly show lot time. enforce protective orders. often enforce restraining orders.

The police worth calling time. Law already means little considering disproportionately applied. mean one happening right now. Yep, look big picture entire East Asia Oceania much SE Asia would kicked planet. SK ""big spike"" terms, national daily case count rose 300 first time since August, include avoid unnecessary arguments. I’m currently pre-med, say noticed opposite. lot people saying covid calling medicine want become doctors it. see government regulating whether person go grocery store based whether they've vaccinated not? really owning libs... Arent nurses always demand ? Take extended break, still nurse jobs over. Human rights mean nothing dead. Temporary forfeiture liberties greater good expected crisis. Move Cali  Thanks. think reasonable suspicions would argue points made hard evidence flaws found study method analysis model etc. strong enough refute study. anyway thanks reply. Possibly 45 making transition 45 46 much harder. Yet 45 still trying claim even know ever plans workbeith 46 transition test cross reactivity. paper arguments cross reactivity (a) picked highly specific target ELISA. There's reported cross reactivity targets used that's sufficiently convincing (b) verified antibody neutralize SARS-CoV-2. rule cross reactivity.

Bro yes 😩 muh freedums! There's way Texans canceling holiday gatherings.  that's exactly virus wants do. people least one nutritional deficiency due poor diet understanding nutrition maybe start holding people higher standard knowledge. actual f\*\*\* wrong people??!! lucky enough able buy protein direct growers. disturbing many levels. That's big ass mask ’new scientific information emerged’ 
**Translation: Trump lost. We're crawling back.** Taiwan country. Well least person duty citizen protecting community.

This study filled limitations, used final word much masks protect wearer however. benefit study 15-20%, however study carried one month, control carried out, participants tested notoriously unreliable antibody tests, least carried time transmission lowest Denmark. ... like moral police officers didn’t go school shot hated thugs protestors. It’s sometimes part job implied risk started career, unfortunately. still screwed taking precautions early, plus allowed ton tourists NZ did. many doctors, nurses, ICU beds single area, everything's capacity, death rates going spike. also bad medical conditions would rather make sure new vaccine doesnt specific side effects specific conditions. 

Whether vaccine, medicine, new games, new technology.

I hope distribution vaccine goes smoothly transition new administration goes smoothly. exactly thought well. may end major catalyst technological societal change. Lets hope This, /u/ionslyonzion.

We've bought several times local farmers. Pigs, cows, chickens. cows least better store bought meat (don't steaks cut thin them, disappointing). Pork good -- got spicy sausage better anything I've store. many pork steaks, though, cut eat often. problem chickens usually make whole chickens. like little processed that.

You need bit freezer space (like medium-size chest freezer) and/or someone share with. buy half cow, that's still *lot* meat. split half cow folks March / April we're long steaks still lots hamburger.

Point is, buy local, ethically treated, conscience rest bit lighter, meat tastes better paying less overall would meat store. Plus, people this, supports smaller farms corporate conglomerates. pretty much win around -- although meat animal admittedly still getting raw end deal. Generally, no. However, first opportunity families get together. might also first time college students home since starting school. unusual 20 people Thanksgiving; however, that's clearly safe right now. think people view testing means normal Thanksgiving, even though public health officials made clear negative result enough protect eveyone.

Also, interesting fact: day drunk driving arrests US day Thanksgiving. Funny get downvoted sharing advice Yes little salt pepper. add much savor sweet meat juices. - reason Finland Norway still mandate masks little viral spread.

That's quite meaningless excuse. Italy, Spain, Germany pretty much whole Europe mandate since March/April indoor spaces, including summer months cases basically zero. wear masks also prevention measure keep cases low.
 - Nordics taken many measures Sweden not.

Like what? measures place Finland Norway right place Sweden, bar masks public transport distancing possible? read time people saying ""I went crowded place many werent wearing masks, least was!"" Anecdotal course, seems pretty common putin anything this. really hope brings behaviour/culture shift west. behaviour I'm ill certainly never Agree deniers low prio hospital want vaccine (they won't) common good can't react properly threat happening right we're absolutely fucked climate change. hell contributing 401K point lol  know yet refused act? order get 450k February going need hit 3k day (Tuesday Friday, lower Monday weekend reporting trends holding) next couple weeks. We're 1,500 now, cases still surging lead increase hospitalizations, lead increase number deaths.

We're 3 weeks away dealing deaths related 150k cases today, currently seeing 1500 day cases identified 3 weeks ago 100k day. 

Hospitals anywhere 10 25% increase ICU usage 3 year average, 15 20% capacity left triage, field hospitals hallway medical care.

Given current surge cases, we're going around 2,200 dead day Dec 15th.

We're cruise ship hitting turbo button. mild shock  ""experts"" given cart blanche credibility anymore. People need become bit less Pollyanna bit cynical understanding conflicts interest pervert many positions institutions stupidly place blind trust in. 

If look workplace, many people know clock punchers? many act dishonestly? many lie? many unethical? Guess what? Even esteemed professions like physicians researchers filled people. Humans humans things motivate them. cross-section one profession look remarkably similar another unrelated profession. problem ""experts"" human. Humans deserve regard. must earn it. Completing university program sufficient ""earned"" anything right START earning credibility. letters name never sufficient grant trust. ""Some people taking precautions seriously, therefore I'm justified taking precautions seriously"" argument, temper tantrum. Fair enough economically, groups taking much larger hit government (whichever government) could cushioning blow deal extremely challenging circumstances, way achieve that.

That’s horrible &amp; exactly fear might happen catch it. feel like treatments working you? lot ppl seem positive results using CBD pain &amp; inflammation. 

Your thanksgiving situation tricky. I’d say bottom line it’s health &amp; health. offend better dead shoes least they’d start understand you’re going though. hope matter happens get good thnxgiving meal Ineptitude No. four experts soapboxes reading peer reviewed studies instead spouting opinion, I'd probably listen first expert. Probably fatality rate would probably pretty close % cases require hospitalization hospitals saturated people many cases die without intervention. legend Rip good book read ""Big Farms Make Big Flu: Dispatches Influenza, Agribusiness, Nature Science"" Robert G.

It details factory farming single important factor viruses species jumping species becoming pandemics. pushing industrial agriculture wilderness areas continue unearth new reservoir viruses wild animals crowded condition fact livestock raised generically similar makes factory farms flu factories too. happens health care debt equity funds. Healthcare longer motivator, profit is. Oh, since individualistic, personal-liberty-above-anything cultures selfish cancer go all-in it? focus societal liberties instead? guarantee everyone healthy life instead guaranteeing asshole right spread COVID he’s ignorant wear mask get vaccination.

If you’re healthy forced get vaccinated people whose bodies medically accept vaccinations still safe. Taiwan success block China, China alert them, provinces neighbouring countries dangers viruses enabled take actions much earlier. 16 provinces China less cases deaths Taiwan. yet, current Administration anything this.  lot restaurant supply way avoiding, damn it. Yeah I've driven thru Dodge City multiple times. smells disgusting AF  ""and rare Chiniese visitors turing Covid-19 positive""

What load bollocks. People,working industry based killing, lacking empathy. could guessed... matter time get control. 50 million cases 50 million bioreactors, exploring parallel mutation would turn virus contagious. Coronaviruses mutate slowly we're giving much time. Really laying thick 'anyone good year amidst COVID pampered/spoiled/fragile/impatient' line eh? pandemic 'excellent' 'teaches people they're pampered'? get it, highly evolved impervious ups downs radical overhaul society. I've meeting plenty people outdoors socializing - country I'm handled COVID well. there's still kinds fallout weak acknowledge rough year.

You might think people who've rough year bunch namby pambys - I'd suggest instead awkward people who've benefited massively WFH could possibly as-good-as-any year.

Stop lecturing people feel - anyone sees pandemic rosily probably extremely privileged they're able WFH, financially secure deal mental health fallout. sound incredibly smug, I'll probably still think 2 years. 1 - plain wrong. Denmark mask mandate publicly accessible indoor spaces.  


2 - reason Finland Norway still mandate masks little viral spread. btw. don’t 5x less deaths Sweden 10x less per capita.  


3 - Nordics taken many measures Sweden not. Therefore it’s meaningful claim mask policies somehow prove masks don’t work Sweden wouldn’t benefit mandating mask use. worst thing I’ve ever read. Good fucking grief referring Pfizer concluded phase 3 trial. I'm sure they'll continue follow-up participants they've met primary safety efficacy end points. They're applying FDA begin rolling now. devastating comment. understand attitude, saying it’s baseless far you’re alone. without CDC FDA, we’re nowhere this. One worst things Trump admin done undermine politicize science engineering. Cant say I’ve seen you, I’m Melb. Was/is taken pretty seriously given lock down. There’s always small cadre dick heads going way fuck things could never expect 100% compliance Remember cockroaches!! Dont allow hide . Republicans remembered, definite, Never Forget , group morons. That's funny, 2019 worst year life, thinking one bad. lost job recently starting look similar quality. Places like Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Vietnam, South Korea deaths cases broad mask usage.  
Put positive column.   
       
What negative health effects wearing mask?   
Is negative 260,000+ dead far?    
Just curious. half states preaching safety half prioritizing individual freedom something petty face mask pandemic.

There’s unity thus leader effectively lead us crisis big part lack unity disconnect leader leader. truly horrific must go great lengths prove preconceived conspiratorial ideas using scientists far actual consensus community, using extremely far-right sources basis. mention, even article cited true, gain spreading this? Governments public wants, despite irritating thorn small, vocal minority, massively favor keeping restrictions save lives prevent spread. Converting people reddit, could anywhere world, help cause.

Nonetheless, message is, act wrong, wearing mask social distancing, simple acts. pandemic, somehow comes right, say knew along. gain nothing right, consequences wrong huge. consequences seem callous illogical friends, family, even strangers, put lives danger death long term effects COVID-19.

LOL resort insults. love it. supposedly care deeply humanity saving people virus immediately start telling go fuck off. You’ll never see hypocritical is, guys aren’t worth it. nice day. 🙂 I’m page. I’m *angry*. didn’t bad!! struck article "" time, direct evidence existed regarding community spread particular virus, previous studies done clinical settings ""  

&amp;#x200B;

That patently absurd.  Clearly evidence community spread April.  Perhaps author meant say direct evidence efficacy masks reducing community spread"". either sloppy writing historical revisionism.  

And know happened respect masks. Dr Fauci admitted publicly US govenment lied faces order stop public buying available masks.  said did, early part pandemic, open conjecture, seems reasonable attribute Chinese influence. God every person affiliated certain party keeps spouting this. president almost nothing continues nothing mitigate Again, weird! almost like data changes rapidly final testing phases data actually confirmed. grand conspiracy, Jesus Christ fuckin wing nuts worst part pandemic ffs. negative air big concert amp looking HEPA filtration units like use asbestos removal? rent units, changes air every minute removes everything particulate air. math amount machines swuare footage create negative air flow building. Wouldn’t help? stop slagging countries media can’t he? mandatory part job? Thanks treating like idiot asking questions. Yeah understand normally scientists go southern hemisphere search influenza viruses get ready Northern Hemispheres winter months. impression influenza Coronavirae extremely difficult vaccinate due rate mutate seen Pharmaceutical companies done something react mutations quickly. know repercussions people take vaccine say 4 5 years time? happens desired effect work majority population becomes asymptomatic virus 99.9% chance surviving without? licking boot? disagree Newsom done good governor. saying alternative worse. Also I'm saying Covid19 hoax. Yea get first visit , shot physical Christ must old Oh no, way worse first round. Lockdowns avoidable, almost everybody complies measures. going happen anymore. People social distance enough anymore, shit going long. health guys need realize, change behaviour last months massive. Many new measures governments try use work anymore enough people dont comply.
This something finally understand. say german. Agreed, dispensing actual medical services *and* education provincial jurisdictions. Hell can't even get Alberta BC sign damn national COVID Alert app. know least Indiana, National Guard called assist Nursing Homes. typical American news. seem think countries incredibly similar identical histories. weird mindset seem have. individual withhunt needs stop. Tegnell decide Public Health Agency's recommendations distributes them. doesnt form iron grip happens, consensu within agency decides it. Yeah. Well pandemic gone long chance reinfection going go up. yeah it’s great vaccine coming, best case scenario general pop won’t get late spring early summer. Given holidays coming spike even happen it’s imperative take precautions. believe many people already proven human necessary technology create virus. Mass, “Red” metric. updated parameters much higher number equals red. Even change, city well red. 

The governor wants push reopen schools students eliminate social distancing. It’s unbelievable. saw removed ""incivility"" really curious said.  don’t think surface transmission bad previously thought... worst case scenario clean house again? cleaner house? call sub? It’s position every scientific body world taken, including cdc who. 

Can use words explain expertise subject makes believe know better scientific community? 

When read things, often wonder I’m dealing narcissist. Like, normal person doesn’t go around claiming “know” things they’re much smarter qualified scientists world. 

Like, believe yourself? Yeah, it'll also increase hospitals can't care everyone effectively they're overwhelmed. LivePD show ""LiveED"" instead. imagine HIPAA makes difficult I'm sure producers money could figure solution. unions bad. Wherever power, someone try abuse it. ISLAND 3/4 size US 1/12 population. There’s like two urban centers whole country. basically ideal conditions containing pandemic. Bo Federal aid businesses civilians so. 😔 depends live. I’m Northern NV, deniers everywhere. also live two QCumbers. doesn’t matter source cite. Unless Trump’s Twitter OAN YouTube video anonymous ‘nurse’, it’s ‘fake news’. Remember time americans saying ""we wont get involved wwii far there"". Yes. merrier. killed Hitler! What's called? I'd love try it.
I want try Amazon thing, area. Instacart. 
In area offer, personal transportation, Goodwill placement, Food Stamps SNAP. one those?
Personally can't afford visit bucher one area visit lol, like people sell fish wayyyyyy expensive. used able eat many meats got whatever sale cheapest.
I eat stuff! Like, fruits, salad leafs, spinach beets stuff. Artichokes. Whats service? :) Absolutely disgusting. I'm boycotting political reasons, trust safely handle food. clearly reason to. factories need shut down. interesting would better unified, cohesive strategy. Nobody forced get vaccines hurting around them. Hopefully confidence vaccine grow people see decline transmission rates vaccination increases. child liked metallic taste coins. Makes feel little ill thinking now.  Let's start preamble: people usually read FAQs question.  FAQs great way store canned, complete, concise answers.  frustrated people ask questions right FAQ.  Use FAQ answerer, forget anything important answer, explain something poorly. Okay, people told 2 weeks March, month, another month... see pattern here? “Just another month two” complete lie point. Even it’s true time, I’m surprised people aren’t buying it.

I’m breaking guidelines, point I’ve essentially resigned pandemic life norm foreseeable future I’m sick chasing dangling carrot. I’ll believe end sight see it. busy temper tantrum. listen. People look family think, “Uncle John won’t get sick. sweet. certainly doesn’t apply family.” uncle Tim infects whole party. He’s sweet too, even unsuspecting.

Stay home year. Zoom/FaceTime visiting. constituents country - voters - select leader.

Explain electoral college then. 

You’re disingenuous person, lol. 

It could argued average Chinese citizen way freedom stupid Americans citizen, since China one hang families little risk viral illness death, unlike US. I’m world physical medicine work mental health. Despite connotation doctors healthcare workers money it’s hard AF work schooling career. Lots doctors 400-500k school debt. Nurses less salaries nurses aren’t nearly high enough either. you’ve got CNAs don’t schooling important tasks hospital setting. Support staff like cafeteria workers janitorial workers make sure patients fed doctors get bite eat things cleaned.

The point I’m trying make vast majority healthcare providers want helpers society. Sometimes extreme martyrdom. There’s reason schooling focuses self-care healthcare providers. drive ground. I’m lucky patients lucky get sessions home safely. can’t imagine trenches right site facility. Yeah even smaller makes fragile actual cell. THATS POINT I'm thinking states restrictions (like TN FL) knocked first round. taking responsibility, Gov. Lee. People absolutely gathering, friend church events, planning big family Thanksgivings. large number people TN believe deadly virus hero president treating like flu. You. Are. Killing. Us. hopefully become WAY less popular. Wait. it’s airborne means none airborne droplets land surfaces? doesn’t make sense experience airborne substances. I’ve going assumption air dangerous breathe without mask surfaces dangerous virus would obv everything room air. Wouldn’t it? 

This government gave fuck people who’s taxes fund would nice. could use scientific advice right now. I’m coming denier otherwise asshole, apologize. It’s long 8.5 months. good news. Change flair. 

PCR tests reliable. court wrong. Agreed. ‘if masks work, spread much’ folks. ‘I know three friends it, wore masks time; therefore, conclude masks don’t work’ peeps. 

I little note phone where, early pandemic, wrote masks reduce spread. No, aren’t perfect. copy/paste local groups. positivity rate exploding. thing obvious good. Lots laugh reacts. know. cant say. 🙊🙈🙉 None current vaccine candidates use weakened virus, either use dead virus (Chinese) use spikes (most western candidates), none replicate human body, therefore none possibly infectious. feel like good thing needing prescription it’ll used symptoms avoid go possibly infect others. simply telehealth appointment, pick test drive pharmacy/delivery etc don’t worry infecting anyone else! some, may also covered insurance New drug vaccine. looking wrong source. starters, get prescription vaccine, 1st big clue....

And certifying medical device also different process, relevant think. 'not silver bullet'** 

... says, supply limited, especially first.

He's saying vaccine provide way pandemic, going ""Great, there's vaccine now, ignore it,"" still get Easter least degree restrictions place.  attitude though? Sars 2.0 people saying January. vanish like sars. Um, no.

They massively purchased purpose, always plan.

The reason encourage different vaccine makers push ahead. need orders vaccine justify work.

If vaccines effective, goal start give away extra, obvious solution.  encourage read subject find interesting. wrote may seem like garbled mess right probably is. genetics complex field everything explained could explained even upon multiple times. insistence estimation extrapolation grounds automatic dismissal study bizarre  comes extremely rare side effects, delay case appearing usually side effect way latent rather rare get case vaccinated sufficiently large number people. Faroe Islands part Denmark? /s It’s safe. severe side effects 40K+ participants. wasn’t safe, would start over, FDA (arguably strictest world) approve it. produce evidence person fact ""top pathologist""?

I assume use internet? go look check see true, assume stupid, opinion you, link 


I take opinion day considering sit trash someone experience field several years probably 0 based response. Tesla stock pretty much stimulus right now... Care place bet last? anything backs assertions? Appropriate username. Iowa!  collective ""duh"" rang many straws trying grasp one time? pay attract workers, pay deserve it. Two completely separate things.

I don’t backing fact offhand seen exemptions med students allowed practice becoming doctors. said nurses well.

A close family member retired nurse still works per diem. Doesn’t need money, likes work while. think even blind person could see that. comment amount money. want put dollars pockets, avoid Beyond Meat. Unless mind funding kind company would allow betting worker lives. Stay home avoid people then? hard. England Perhaps inevitable. Governments mandate, instead focus educating public. America media got fucking twisted contradicting left right people become defiant rules, go fucking figure  VR headset longer works lose ability save progress even use mobile games. I’m shut future. quick assume large percentage Republican voter base murder child Trump asked to. Study metrics.

To degree hospitals “prepared?” That’s open ended vague statement you’re making.

When 9/11 happened, states throughout East, Midwest, etc shut hospitals ONE INCIDENT NYC. involved roughly 10,000 people.

That’s trauma. insidious, unpredictable persistent disease. idea many nurses, RTs, aides, midlevel NPs, intensifiers, anesthesiologists, etc required run ONE wards? usually house what, 20-40 patients?

How world could system prepared hundreds thousands, possibly, infected people like this? Let tell you, aren’t enough people. don’t exist. Unless want HS college students running ventilator.... otherwise forget it.

No health system planet handle situation large portion populace gets critically ill. That’s fact (see: Italy, good system brought knees). know could done, hypothetically, hospital preparation. want hospital preparation public prevention oranges oranges. Really, it’s horseshoes thermonuclear warheads.

I’m running office, know fuck I’m talking about. funds? course not. Trump equivalent shitty employee put 2 week notice. He's going even less usual. Imagine mom one people wearing mask could've saved life. want years back? mayor limited control them, much beholden governor. mayor less direct control local school district public schools, private schools governed state standards particularly beholden municipal government  We’re already seeing here. 

“The vaccine probably doesn’t work. people given careful never encountered virus”. Theres mitigation efforts? viruses don’t fatty outer shell. However soap wash away droplets hand send sink.  Revelation. Singular. read it? NFA deal.

Thank you, that's referring suppressors. name escaped me. included SBRs, SBS select fire well. work part time Amazon warehouse they're desperate people. Every shift see available app +3$ +5$ per hour... I've picking 5 dollar shifts making 21 bucks hour  Yeah, choice (if live America) going give options internet providers? going go without internet? belief could shows ignorant world works. one realizes biggest problem America terrible health, look obese country. Going places like England eye opening bad America Respirators back stock. Mine hard bridge nose, I'm confident seal vs duckbill. would really funny Trump sudden pushed extremely draconian shutdowns right end term would tank economy Biden.

Might work stopping virus though. Say me: federal support needed.  main page click continent/region automatically filters it. fucking disaster people selfish pricks. something imposes ""freedom"" scream bloody murder people let whatever fuck want. reason able deal climate change gun violence. compounded lack educated population actually understand threat reasons need distance wear masks. know, epilepsy dealing like 20 years. sucks still good times worth living for. lot people things lot worse still find reasons happy. conditions like lou gehrig's disease find personally horrifing can't speak people. Americans likely adopt mask wearing dump knives/forks/spoons favor chop sticks. one post couple hours ago said extinct? Yikes. North Dakota far denser Australia, lmao. state city big brain Yeah. That’s gonna trick alright. too, friend.  People excited confirmed vaccine effective enough end pandemic. Distribution matter time now, rather matter possibility.

6 months ago articles telling us prepare possibility might never vaccine. ""states let pandemic ravage ravaged pandemic"" Appreciate response &lt;3 want Christmas societal responsibility Yes sometimes surgery considered ""elective"" one person another. gallbladder year emergency gallstones impacting liver putting risk pancreatis. coworker wait longer gallbladder impacting organs considered ""elective"" even thought impacting life causing miss work painful attacks. seriously clue population density means. means nothing dealing tiny number Australia. never would made caves without mythology. Jesus claim ""God"", claimed son prophet existing god people preaching to. said order convince audience live considered better life, within social cultural framework available. supposed do, appeal empirical scientific evidence?

I disagree compatibility issues certain religious practices ""modern life"", think much obvious. point every preacher grifter, every grifter preacher. willingness use whatever institution, story, resource available give oneself power others predates likely survive organized religion.

I want point concentrate narrowly religion real underlying issues play greed, contempt, malicious manipulation changing theme abusers time. privilege go college right, kick comply. See again, huge part problem. Let's hope. Take care stay safe! They're trying kill people. least one  &lt;&lt;THIS V2 I've actually done drive times! 26 hours door door. entirely possible 2 days. Idk I'd higher risk flying driving - bc would stay hotel, get gas, etc. like idea packing food unnecessarily stop.  question 'why taking stronger actions covid versus H1N1'. 

Imagine football stadium full people infected H1N1, 15 people die. Imagine football stadium full people infected covid, 1,500 people die.  

That world taking strong actions. could *potentially* drug dealers, right? Pretty sure it’s crime transport drugs across state lines.
So, according logic, outright ban applicable?  yet comment get deleted connecting politics COVID 

Wtf? see proposing system fund federal government donations only. I'd like subscribe newsletter. University (which fair, afaik probably spent COVID prevention measures, testing, etc.) still Thanksgiving break allowing people travel home ending in-person classes kicking people dorms aftereards. Now, obviously ideal still spread virus areas students return (low odds based testing numbers zero), least local community deal students returning break spread virus campus. know there's better solution this, would open hearing one could throw idea next semester even next fall semester pandemic unfortunately continues point. think lot people actually enjoy staying working home. dream come true excuse staying home time. also appears lot people found community like minded people sub freak spread misinformation lash anyone different opinions. Well you’re wrong healthcare workers deserve pay.

But would retired workers come back put health risk?

How suggest getting college students properly trained? Every day become ashamed I’m Iowan.  barely enough people even 1 urban city. get nonsense. Feeling like latter, Ohio's covid dashboard updated yesterday there's much data analysts run through. Scary stuff. wrapping corona pneumonia? They've done worse nothing. baby could kept mouth shut masks politicized. help White House somehow afraid transparently weak person ever hold public office, masks politicized. deaths increased spread due Republicans refusing wear masks hands. Breaking News Hot Press: White House clue handle global pandemic. infuriating seeing many entitled people generations acting like assholes. GF (early 20's) distancing since first orders March, little brother partying parents can't say going eat dinner parties friends. three pissing off, especially since evidence present dangers going immediately discounted ""I'm people know"" ""people wear masks *most* time,"" etc. Right, speeding illegal. time, choice speed. Cars limited seventy miles per hour. Agreed. one single confirmed case catching COVID surfaces. breathe millions millions cases, single confirmed fomite transmission confirmed.

Could possible confirmed transmission way, regardless surface not, proximity someone contaminating air anyway?

If they're afraid debunked means ruled beyond doubt.

I'll say again:
""As long CDC thinks might issue, concerned parties act though might be.""

Besides, people aware surfaces vectors illness general, they'll less likely contact illnesses. Kill off...test Lord...he loves That's basically Donald Lame Duck did.  Cult. too, aren’t delivery services similar doordash uber sense anyone sign up? I’m wondering many people even willing it, I’m sure low wages reliance tips isn’t helping. definitely going put twist ""bringing home leftovers"". NFA deal. Actually Christian churches believe Jesus completely organized religion. believed organized religion often becomes corrupted humans many “traditions” create distance humans God. Jesus called God Father create closer intimate relationship. 

A priest, Bruxy Cavey, wrote excellent book called “The end religion”. Can’t tell sarcasm obliviousness, based what’s currently going virus Europe. Sure makes sense fact matter is, rich people afford grocery delivery lot poor people can't. Plus like u/shygermany said another post, typically enough delivery slots everyone ordering delivery again, get gobbled rich.

We talk perfect solutions want need realistic solution. Tens millions work. Lots people can't afford $10/m Instacart fee yeah, alternative drug used. placebos becoming less common medical research. Alternatives used people arent treated trialing placebo. Story life! gotten natural Ventilation many buildings, ramping OA 10+ CFM depending wind conditions. real solution, required commercial buildings (just like required residential.) Open doors windows much bigger point, kind feel like cool, it. Natural Selection stunted modernity, we're past-due catch-up. people want keep ignoring science, let's let them. going shit much, you’re going sick tired shitting. y'all really calling everyone narcissist days.

I guarantee congregation luck poor people trying make better life terrible job it. 
I've around type people go churches decades - though admittedly Oklahoma. stupidly trust pastors everything else world they're raised way birth. nothing narcissism. say directly people charge get fired.

FTFY feel way half stuff posted sub absurd brick mortar store

no, retail killed collapse American middle class decline real wages. obsolete, simply luxury country becoming poor have. notice plenty retail still built booming economies east Asia Persian gulf oil profit Christmas Sales expense customer health

Again, absurd. one forcing anyone shop Macy's store. Anyone goes free will. saying states force anyone anything. Customers free chose going store risk want take. struggle say ""no shit"", working retail made numb.

At point accepted unfortunate fate. fact gotten point (or least tested positive) know matter time do.

Then hope mild case lasting side effects pick terroristic threats? mosques gone, Sikh temples... Uh last White House Coronavirus Task Force briefing four fucking months ago Yes, situation fucked-up country - risk killing family risk paying rent buying food.

Meanwhile, rich making huge gains misery many. think theory person might infectious another 10 days, infected end 10 days, take another 14 days develop symptoms. likely cannot ruled either. Right? can't person hates shopping clothes online. literally got Uber driver spent entire time telling virus fake engineered America control population kill Asian people. Keep shit closed Canada, don’t want American brand crazy running amok cities. ""When new cases appear, rapid contact tracing isolation exposed people need continue stop resurgence virus’s presence community.""

Nobody cares resurgence common cold community. vaccine would essentially turn into?

Why FUCK would agree contact traced vaccine widely available? COVID longer makes people sick, all, fuck quarantines. I'd rather slip mask I'm sick stuck home 2 weeks.

Fuck tyrannical bullshit. person hates GRE, problem :P friends bar Friday, yesterday Wednesday friend texted said received positive rapid test result. Another friend also us Friday got PCR result back today, Thursday, also positive. 


I saw friend (Sarah) Saturday evening, 24hrs bar believe virus picked up. possible could contracted virus Friday transmitted Sarah Saturday? I’m reading, people generally contagious 24hrs exposure. symptoms got test today Thursday. 


**Should Sarah concerned may contracted virus, 24hrs exposed?** close contact Sarah Saturday, headache day likely hangover. Thank reading Sounds like work giving people pretty strong incentive disclose positive result. strange thing say. They've comparing covid 1918 pandemic forever - talking fatigue second wave hit harder first....hmmmmm federal government effectively unlimited money. Perks printing currency.

There's definitely downsides pushing idea far (i.e. inflation) think we're anywhere near federal government unable pay want to. lockdown light 2.5 weeks numbers still going up. Much slower thsn arent close decreasing significantly. Schools stores still open, seems like might close too. went university 4-7 years training exams 4-7 years- saves lives (whether ensuring electricity supply continues surgery)- easily replaceable. It’s statement worth general, replaceability job. Flying risky indoors without mask.

Get Grandma legit N95's, get someone test fit even better.  practice wearing one 8 hour stretch.

Try fly airline still keeping middle seats empty Delta.  mileage may vary flew cross country choose rear plane empty. 

Make sure uses hand sanitizer try's avoid touching face. 

Wishing best family. Thank reply! Much appreciated 🤝 ones send money political action committees. That's first list. enough money that, enough house feed poor, need pay taxes.  there’s news group take seriously , it’s definitely Bloomberg 😂 sub seems pretty pro-lockdown, imagine must guys Macy’s this? I've zero issues ones I've attended. lover words, thank you.  Mission Accomplished. selling essential items? wonder work. list essential items seems broad (which probably good). 

I wonder *isn't* essential noticed huge spike drunk idiots giving shit around corner trump country. Bingo!!! hear Perdue Loeffler really cleaned stock market... Dibbs Martyr? I'm 32 can't wait rave hahaha Kids school. less 95% population wear mask, like one wears mask. yet, lockdown shall have. top, bottom. yet enough space Texas alone comfortably house everyone world... People get conservative point brainwashing effect actually believe so. It’s scary. Spent time soaking beauty nature?

I totally get that's lot people's thing, thing. hate nature. best time's I'm hotels controlled environments. love Las Vegas luxury resorts everything manmade expensive. year, fine, I'm deathly afraid things like going harder future nature thing going easier. Wait, what!? Lol people thought could actually live like long term. government much debt, afford pay Americans right now? Yep, lost generation, especially young ones. Zoom ""happy hours"" sad awkward. Plus kinda need food. Well remember, unemployment rolls. work/no govt assistance (which happening) means people cannot feed families That’s takes justify lockdowns!  Ha, that'd nice!

Change rooms area open since March. people want meet Jesus sooner others. fuck many people become experts vaccine distribution? manage vaccinate tens millions people fall winter influenca without world economy governments behind that? think lengths would go try save single person collapsed front drowning- multiply 1500-2000 people day. It’s stunningly overwhelming. one dared ask meant “a while”. 

I want estimate. Even it’s wrong. rational get estimate.

Is take get everyone vaccinated? 

Or even 95% effective vaccine distributed ... people still catch covid die. 

One agree with. cannot. people like try clothes. Call representatives man wallet/pocketbook I’ll bet. someone's job, voluntary. catholic, ask money back pope. Talk huge uptick coming Yep, going straight vertical Yes required quarantine 14 days upon entering Canada. definitely facetious statement meant taken literally. statement disappointed embarrassed US response COVID. happy pay part federal tax, but, good citizen, expect US better results experienced 2020. stuff normalizes using ""mommy juice"" solve problems kids problems begin with. kind gross culture.  Here's compromise: Seniors LTC, assisted living, nursing homes get actual essential workers, seniors living alone get after.

If Johnny comes visit Grandma SFH, that's grandma.

But health care workers first. Inpatient care first among them. concerned hospitals overloading, protecting health care workers first priority. hospital ain't worth shit 40% workers home sick. 

[Here's Colorado's plan agree would help blend deep south efficacy trials - would go long way gaining confidence public completely transparent results. ADE found? no, say so. autoimmunity tested for, results -' induced autoimmunity '- say so. vaccinated develop ADE 6 months vaccination antibodies wane (which seen coronaviruses) that's tested for, results say so. people antibodies NL63 (the human coronavirus uses ACE2 get cells) problem making antibodies vaccines? NO, say so. asymptomatic participants still shed virus despite vaccination? NO, say so. upfront results, people buy in. Even better get 'consumer reports' style independent entity verify publish report phase 3 results. Then, get huge buy sceptics. What's important due limited vaccine availabilty, get people likely die COVID - numerous reports - get first. common sense. hope money doesnt determine whether people get vulnerabilty death determining factor gets first. Relaxing measures definitely hardest part whole mess man. currently looking couple months lockdown lot parts europe hospitals filling up. 

I excited ot hear discussions relaxing measures. sometimes wonder chemicals something this, people always nuts. However, people realizing can't trust media government started believing stuff face book posts, youtube, documentaries. listen people look stuff sounds legit. think people internet go phase realizing stuff hear real destroys world view. Sounds like need article explaining Redditors don’t read articles. I'd like think essential workers - hospitals pharmacies trash collection police officers - get vaccine 1st. live Serbia situation world.
Here's sources found - Gallup International. Check last question regarding opinions ""foreign power"" causing this. 11 European countries, 7 worse score - - UK

Thanksgiving making think SciFi movie virus actually starts parasite making us bidding.  picks ones get taxed, hmm? Perhaps chemical factory also produce virus large scale spread via airplanes big city like biological weapon? might help speed spread, that's going for, right? Land free someone household received positive result today, told HR department work can’t go back 10 days received positive test, plus another 14 days quarantine top that. I’m work almost entire month quarantine. though two weeks, told stay home long now? might sound selfish, symptoms haven’t close contact person house since found might exposed (~10 days now), they’ve isolating wearing mask since knowing potential exposure, really don’t think I’m much risk. I’m honestly upset I’ll work long, I’m curious changed that’s got stuck home long now, even test negative. Initial Jobless claims dude hello !emojify Good, large amounts population can't get vaccinated early stages need preventative treatments. Probably get public while, it'd nice hear there's government funding support research behind this. Seems like government focusing heavily vaccines much preventative measures. goes ways

Lmao Canadians trying get American right now?  stop whole one planning go anyway. people listen already arnt going go anyway people over.

On serious note, ugh finally news potentially game changing vaccine. can’t screw now. might another 6-9 months realistically get vaccines out. least frontline workers need vaccines ASAP. 

The government including federal government needs learn past mistakes. 

Let’s real shutdown also bring back 600 dollar unemployment weekly boost people stay worry bills food etc. one things attempted get immunity liability senate majority. hoping one area proof vaccination absolutely mandatory.

Mostly way cruise loving, antivax parents get vaccine. Would anyone know mRNA vaccines safe people TNF inhibitors (eg biologics used treat autoimmune illnesses)? know can't take live vaccines, flu vaccine safe.

Sorry hurts feelings.


/$ I, respectfully, disagree rollout taking year. Fauci quite conservative, along, one best minds invested American vaccine venture pandemic response. course, one man, differing opinions.. believe this.

There phased, detailed distribution plan vaccines. seen plans individual unit hospital, hospital wide plans, county statewide plans. enough doses every member population receive vaccine year, enough get majority healthcare workers, first responders, emergency responders, military, national guard called covid response, alone curb spread drastically. 

It isn’t logistical nightmare portraying. Hospitals pharmacies building freezers, Pfizer vaccine shipped stored days dry ice. Vaccines given hospital employees, nursing homes, long term rehabilitation health facilities, jails, prisons. teachers, high risk public, filter following months. state alone expecting doses available anyone, widespread, March. easy feat, plans drawn opinion fantastic. would expect us. necessities one sure. Alright... I’m gonna say it:

G*d d*mn it! Yes, without science nobody would know island close order avoid new infections. Almost 7pm here. 3 hours corona comes get us! Lol wtf remember Fauci estimates conservative exactly got field month ago. working conditions gotten way stressful keep reporting in. chance get out, feel residents workers places option. would expect Germans logical this. give fuck believe, nobody. Good luck that, must either smarter scientific community simply, wrong.
I’ll remind cocky post March then. PC bunch sure know suck life banter, they? Lmao says cbn also #christiannews people Japan saying it’s cold don’t need wear masks, though. would gather front Shibuya station obnoxious loud. always smile smugly dance (literally)/shout microphones virus isn’t big deal. even bring kids/babies them.

Just look “クラスターフェス” Twitter see nonsense.

2.	⁠⁠⁠we vaccinate third population flu vaccine every year like three months urgency motive get it
3.	⁠⁠⁠we already logistics distribute easily covid test sites

OMG! going take people stop gathering big groups? important eat turkey large group?  feel like especially premature considering news around pzifer moderna, early open authorization granted end year possibility people getting spring, making easier go back Covid going away. Full stop. thank antivaxxers trump that. eventually like small outbreaks smallpox, bubonic plague similar.

Its infectious, half country deriving subsidence trumps propaganda, prepare yearly vaccination.

The sooner come realization going back ""normal"" pre-covid times accept new norm, better going mental health. vast majority people aren’t total f’ing sociopaths like people quoted article. New Zealand succeed island. succeeded partly acted much earlier others largely Kiwis extremely high trust government obeyed strict lockdown rules much greater degree US much Europe. also helped strongest value NZ culture egalitarianism. different US considers freedom individualism important thing.  

During California lockdown movement decreased 50%. March-May NZ lockdown movement 90%. 

Australia proved thing worked catch outbreak early, 700 cases day one city got back zero. succeeded sharing similar values NZ, similar trust government. going convention August requiring proof vaccination attend person. think route many tourist entertainment based businesses take 2021 *maybe* 2022 cases still wide spread.

But terms wearing masks social distancing really wait advice medical experts vaccines become widely available. Yes, news quote directly Pfizer press release going mention that. guy writes anti mask studies praises Jordan Peterson.

No thank you. Got flu? stay home. live Wyoming. Glad hear we’re headed direction! I've seen seamen saw seesaw sea want do. got PPE, testing, mask orders, lockdowns, school home, vaccine. else miss? one ever says. Everyone virtue signalling donate blood every 8 weeks suspect person responding commenting strong take ""eating asking Thanksgiving outside crazy idea eating holiday meal outside stupid insane me, would never even consider would literally, genuinely embarrassed asking family eat outside.

There plenty places US weather favorable enough eat outside, plenty occasions people gather eat outdoors, 4th July one outdoor grilling pretty common since weather favorable country.

Most Americans weather right really conducive outdoor eating, people socially distanced gathering someone's backyard viable. mention even favorable enough weather means desire host family outdoors keep everyone 6ft apart, particularly festive occasion. imagine sparkling conversation would shouting 60 feet table ask cousin things going inherent madness trying figure pass around mashed potatoes length football field back.

You could imagine though small enough extended family lives somewhere weather permits outdoor eating, could end semi-viable alternative really resist getting together want throw caution wind.

Overall point mostly valid getting bit lost passion expressed it.  That's ridiculous found reported cases deaths concentrated younger cohorts expected based observations higher-income countries.”

Sounds like could something specific India, different hygiene standards family structure many countries people talking Reddit. 

But regardless, truth governments probably going hold desperate feel choice closing schools again, forces ton people stop work. Generally I'm favour restrictions measures also think lot governments trying hold things together vaccine avoid collapse economy millions jobs disappearing forever. Thank specific. American individualism unique think considered Western. yep Victoria hard lock months result we're 20 days donuts (0 cases 0 deaths).

Lockdown works. Aka, good Republican governance...  lot conjecture anecdotal evidence.

illinois testing positive percent trending down. study biosciences. assure RNA definitely affect DNA. enter nucleus would need certain recognizable proteins attached. even got in... would sit breaks down. Live viruses use reverse transcriltase integrate rna dna, protein vaccine good. Alberta, Canada abandoned contact tracing also. can't easily tell vaccinated. document forged. easier enforce mandates numbers decrease.

Otherwise vaccinated buy fake proof. already happening fake negative covid test results. long term effects? Sadly testing cells. Antibodies last long enough, especially men. Sorry, think places good testing scheme large population centers USA, order even register cases? ahhh thats good know. wish guys testing culd ever want actually easier tell what's causing changes positive tests.

Of course infective rate useful.

If one states 15k cases day would get tested wether sick fear might it, starts going people feeling sick, gets worse everyone shows sure. Typical reddit phds saying deaths down? Wow, days 1000 cases too, population 560k. Thats nuts, knows real cases are. right know one point know look bad. Rona DeathSentence clearly sadistic narcissist would (or want this) independently know who. really wish people would understand this. I'm pretty sure said mink strain immune finger-crossed one either. hope mild version gradually becomes another common-cold type virus something. Would great mega corp got board distribution. widespread tendrils already.  Same. taught Chickasaw last year—basically outskirts Pritchard lot stigma. Never felt like going get 
shot kidnapped like mom feared 🙄 India? keep hearing India absolutely nothing. I'm confused. - USSR isn’t more! saying think lot people would willing stand line first get vaccine know means stop wearing mask start parties etc again. Hell give card show saying ""I vaccinated"" going places proof. People running get vaccine get card post social media selfie much like ""I voted"" sticker. 

But yeah wear mask parties-then way way way less inclined try get vaccine point? Nah. Masks early next year. Yep, rational folks brains capable critical thinking worried whole time. beds full, NOBODY gets help. least Japan mask wearing pretty popular living pre-2000s. Apparently 100 YESSSS GOD. Yasss lawd. Whew!! Can’t wait January-April get vaXXXine go back normal!!! sound it, guy lacks skill ""keep thoughts inside head,"" prerequisite covert operations walking hospital. Seems even visit shop without causing scene... would thought pandemic government nothing tens thousands people dying, people would like ""Hey, hell paying for? Get thing control already!"" nope, would wrong. would foolish operate assumption. Really came left field too. totally normal conversation glasses says “Oh heard something think know” throws curve. 

You almost expect online it’s kinda shocking someone drops “information” like face face can’t pretend they’re trolling, know really believe it. I'm really not. making absurd claims everyone world sick, words. So, solution accept nothing change. Unfortunate dense, put ostriches shame  think implying that. mean, ""Western"" ""Eastern"" cultures pretty arbitrary abstract terms anyway. Eastern culture imply Chinese, Korean Japanese people type culture despite different levels outbreaks? Vietnam Thailand? They've barely dent covid cases. Also, Western culture implies USA Sweden ethos, laughable. pretty useless definition, especially regard. even Ebola-like epidemics.  fact big brain government tried ban vapes banning cigarettes never fails make die inside. required though. Oh man, can’t wait see news article sub headline ”The COVID-19 pandemic officially ended.”  good boy? Yup RNA vaccines   didn’t answer me, I’d bet $50 charity choice either you’re single B WFH.

If hadn’t able see partner last 9 months I’d say there’d 75% chance dead now. 

No one this, reason risk vs reward. risk following guidelines vs following guidelines + living tent small fraction, reward able see partner feels like mini apocalypse great united states everyone seems care! I'm sure else people believe hoax. 
It's truly sad! school district started pilot program randomly test kids. started in-person school Labor Day hybrid format. looking forward data, school went virtual Monday due outbreak. Would've interesting see results. Hand God telling truth. really, really wish wasn't. Trust me. health officials credit success simply following science.



Great news. Bro you’re overcomplicating I’m saying hard you’re arguing strawmans. I’m saying people don’t eat healthy, wtf want do, change truth? Weird ass  I’m dumb ass carpenter I’ve wearing mask since March pulled kids school year. Weird uncommon common sense is. Yeah, data ready, drop everything get it. need wait next month.... US? region? That's crazy! son’s too. never wanted party year (he’s 7) got cancelled. I’m hoping 2021 year us get celebrate!! Birthplace Mardi Gras home pretty cool historic homes buildings. also Haunted bookstore downtown second this. can, wear non-vented goggles. entire time. makes much incredible. literally blows mind new specific strain virus starts infecting people scientists answer within weeks/months. Modern medicine people make engine go truly incredible. people working around clock vaccine unsung heroes deserve much credit they’ll get. Also, think vaccine fine. went trials, passed them, got approved, short term studies go on. question mark long term effects I’m sure compiled data confidently conclude it’s safe long term. Uhhgh. cares wanna locked down. can't willingly spread deadly virus. Fuck feelings. Oooh interesting, thanks!! [largest contact tracing far finds case, children particularly efficient spreading disease children. wouldn’t surprised ‘new scientific information’ CDC referring to. preventable; predictable Basically. Viruses DNA RNA (there's different types), wrapped hull proteins. DNA RNA encodes multiple functions, including hull proteins. hull proteins also things body uses recognize virus enemy.

This vaccine basically hull protein part. let cells produce harmless hull proteins, body trains recognize kill. 20 X 🍩🍩‼️ January so. still dont know 100% vaccines stop spread virus disease, plus take time distribute vaccine well.

But overall think overblown bit. Australia western country? look pretty damn east me. “Outdoor classrooms” 

This Colorado, *that* interesting... 

But see he’s best improvise accordingly. guarantee within next 100 years, Im still alive, recievee vaccination. Yup! Gotta make sure false positive! - finding downed jets looking them! don’t look downed jet - won’t find downed jet, means dont crash! figures it. sub really needs stop. XD give midwestern states time catch areas hit hard March April. endurance frankly astounding. must good heart.

I expand see going go this, many times going try. 

I applaud you! you, I'm throwing masks away soon mandates lifted. aren’t surging fast rate like week ago. 103,000 tests today 10% infectivity rate. It’s improvement lower number cases tests days week happened happen again."" -BSG Truly two words never expected sentence bonkers part current model physicians away different types insurance rolled everything Medicare rates net net would neutral positive most. old EM group fancy excel model forecasting anticipated avg collection per visit would use bidding new contacts.  bunch inputs, including ED volume, patient acuity, payor mix, etc. whole could forecast ~$145 avg collection per visit contract would profitable. One day kicks made medicare % contract forecasting 100% medicare spit estimate $147 per visit. hospitals normal payor mix forecasting $151 billing costs accounting $12 PER VISIT. bill medicare would go $3 per visit (max). would much better single payor model. course old group new profit would sucked private equity owners thats seperate (and related) problem. 

TLDR, micro macro economics healthcare fucked whole system doomed current trajectory.  Texas county? 50+ families day loved one die? Enjoy: Honestly, since new president elected I've noticed signs going major shifts policy. Tons schools closing back up, CDC reversed guidelines questionable, including one, bunch counties issued stay-at-home advisories, etc.

I think real guidance finally coming top level government, even though new guy office yet. think he's actually running things currently behind scenes current leader completely given responsibilities. check presidential schedule since election almost events he's doing. he's really met VP yes men his.

So stuff learned virus completely ignored going treated seriously like adults treat things like this.

--My tinfoil hat Already did, weee little cough one day. Yes. fucking idiot brother planned still wedding march money already paid wont refund minus whale. going lol. Yes people really attitude, go visit r/masks4all.

This study Thailand based 29 people chose wear mask time. also found chose better hygiene social distanced better. 

So think conclude forced people wear masks would reduce spread.

The one CDC references studies infections deaths falling post lockdown.

Maybe masks contributed, think could also say tested theories increased immunity change human behaviour significant death tolls.

As said, opposed wearing masks, policy hope science. Gotcha, yeah Bachelor's Math Grad. level Stats. courses, probability theory unfortunately. rule thumb taught Sample Size = 10*Number Variables, thinking probably scaled faster linear though. anything set stone anywhere? Washington guaranteed Canada is. seems bother you, I'm sure why. taxes pay it, insurance will. Unless super poor super rich, thing. Religiously

I spent 20 hours week job hunting.

Now work employer said, clearly, entire company (sans one guy maintains server room site) MUST work home least next six months, probably more.

After time, I'm never going back office. Fuck wearing tie.

Opt out. meat production horrible different degree. need become vegan reducing meat consumption never easier. Deployed 5 medical grade air purifiers plenty replacement filters. Still pretty terrified. Coming soon Lifetime Network. watched Jaws month ago thought thing Police unions certainly enemy **champ**, science. Scientific data gives consistent answer every time tested. Studies give wildly varying answers depending various population samples. take 25% people study replace different people completely change results.

I give [TL;DR also paper, Ioannidis argued large number, majority, published [medical papers contain results cannot based observable facts, empirical data, ability anyone knowledge tools replicate results consistently.

Population studies inaccurate best case scenario easy manipulate/fake worse case scenario.

Example: Danish study conservatives quoting effectiveness masks. showed masks effective preventing spread covid. However, study following flaws:

1)Participants self managed, rather researchers. "" masks, wear them. rules study. fun!""

2) Participants self tested covid mail kits. use nasal swab one test, self test nasal going lot room errors. I've nasal swab, correctly going hard many people.

3) time study daily infection rate Denmark 1: 39,000 population. equivalent city Los Angeles 100 new cases day nothing.

4)The participants didnt wear mask time. required wear certain periods. Denmark mandated masks restricted bubbles persons household factors. people caught covid wore mask could easily caught friends family even wearing mask around people.

Yet studies conclusion masks ineffective. science, nonsense. studies like this. Studies science. scientific method, cover variables, always based sample size rather entirety. depending sample pull depends results.

Using mask example...

A filtration company tested effective various materials stopping covid size particles. blew X amount particles speed materials A-M analyzed much covid particles made through.  test done controlled environment could easily replicated anyone correct tools knowledge. science.

Science peer replicated produce results. Studies contain stupid amount uncontrolled variables, assumptions, random sampling. pseudoscience often biased towards results researcher wants achieve. brazen, happened [European meatpacking plants too. Also Florida Legislature:

No need rub in. :P Even true false positives, hospitals filling up. Yup, months ago changed numbers 1)those died covid 2)those died covid. couple months later, state website would visit see numbers... exist anymore, this... 9 months Republicans still can't mandate masks. They're dangerous terrorist group world. Ybor Xmas tree crowd huge (i go, saw live news - people tightly packed balconies mask). mutual stupidity top suppose it? suppose set check points? Call national guard? realize almost police department refuse enforce mask stay home order? Many officers wear mask responding call surprise you, people like everywhere.

He got exposed people know wrong. Vaccine available Christmas there's that, least. also seen study CO2 levels associated error-rates technical tasks. suggests people alert, make fewer errors, might smarter, CO2 lower.

Makes sense. Brains function well lower level Oxygen they're used Yes, cause Trump right said ""We're rounding corner"" ""15 cases becomes 0 quick"". would say am. close family, many friends. kind loner enjoys home versus out. much prefer takeout live ND still go work even though job could done home. done West months ago. 

If vaccine safe enough 10's thousands volunteers take phase 3 trials, safe enough hospital worker exposed covid patients daily choice take one. Bader-Meinhoff anyway? swear hearing time reality people simply want work, spread COVID, boomers rushing pay bills.  Well dont think anyone getting global brands trying get authentic italian food, good tasting convenient food. I'd rather try get something store thats 5 minute walk away vs. going little italy 30-40 minutes away ordering online paying $12 pack 5 hot dogs $10 shipping.  People scrambling try get it. Honestly surprised quit Impossible meat still good 👍 seem misunderstanding lockdowns. think think want lockdowns ever. case. Lockdowns need last little bit time set factors help contain virus. contact tracing better testing.

Ok. First all. plan hard lockdown masks **when necessary**. curve flattens hospitalization reduces (which current wave older people anymore cause everyone got careless). Flatten curve reopen **safely**. 
I know got idea wanted mask forever. Nobody(except environment exposed covid long periods time) needs wear masks long periods time.

As lockdowns. Well thing it. one pub, cases contracted, indoor cafe, virus airborne long periods time, indoor venues thY increase chances contracting viral pneumonia. make sense close places time hospitalization reduces way people able taken care of.

When reopened first lockdowns, states moved fast fully reopen assuming virus gone. set contact tracing mass testing ppe. 

You need look countries actually listened science instead politicians. Japan, South Korea, germany. controlled virus. Set safety nets prevent another outbreak

Us, locked opened went back normal alot denial.

Now much cases damn near impossible control.

And want go herd immunity way, prepared 20,000,000 deaths(that number must definitely perfect). elderlyz virus sweeping going people. hospital go to. people surely enjoy dying home (some alone) people caught caring liberties care neighbors.

Just saying... Call cps parents that’s case. Covid shot determine whether live life disabled not. Imagine committing (mink) genocide erase virus strain existence.  so, i've it, likely least partial immunity? odds could get pass exposed (even body handles better time symptom-wise)? i'm concerned getting passing i'm high risk group. curious science far people could still get pass others. trend invalidated UK. island neither necessary sufficient pandemic management, dozens bordered countries Africa, Asia, even one two South America attest. gobbled 2 month real, actual lockdown get R0 1

Then closed borders Good you. Make sure getting B12 you’re going completely plant based. don’t understand. Senate cannot possibly vote anything House passes entirely busy important things like rushing confirmation Supreme Court justice grilling Zuck Facebook politically motivated (again). things really matter REAL Americans. need patriot less snowflake.

Imagine seeing headline future back March theory why? mean, lot us watched Red Asphalt driving school scare sense us we’d drive safely wear seatbelts. news stations want first one show ventilator footage prevent even Covid deaths? 
 
It money-related something. Like, advertisers won’t make much money channel shows footage every channel showing graphic footage, people go stations want stay denial, weak stomachs. Worst places spread: Bars, restaurants, gyms.

America skittles population.  can't count Wyoming... New York think you'regoing draw parallels. 

By definition... India worse? 

If want donit population, map drawn city... means lots American cities better... lots worse.


So either use population amd compare countries.  use density compare cities. Otherwise.... could say Antarctica fantastic right now. plenty conversations stuff China. 

You’re straight lying. Safety theater. Business every dumb thing think make difference customers massively discredit work government citizens made months lockdown attributing phenomenal success global scale luck. Poor form, mate. 1. study conclusive, authors wrote conclusion section.
2. protect wearer high efficacy, really looking respirators, news. It’s america europe much world fucked too. Debating conservative travel quarantine length bit like arguing whether use medium sized bandaid small sized bandaid you’re bleeding multiple shotgun wounds. Ultra conservative measures make sense local transmission already close zero need absolutely sure keep way enforce them. Shorter quarantine testing effective people likely actually follow it.

the ""idea"" u cant interchange. large cities mask mandates, definitely getting big tourist attractionon without one. Obviously don’t scientific research. get study like published needs peer-reviewed, many cases reviewers aren’t actually field research reviewed in. bogus journals, fake political journals, great journals, everything between. something published looks like journal, doesn’t mean it’s research followed scientific methodology. Often methods used bad journals sketchy they’re trying make scientific argument political points. 

This widespread problem. 

All point glaring flaw study.
The assumptions China point someone political points score result “research”. Yeah tickled bit. wondered fuss suffer economic mitigation consequences either way losing anything save older people. economic damage comes impact global economy, public gathering limits. see nations significant lockdowns. still GDP deflation similar levels ones did. economy screwed matter vaccines mitigate globally looming risks virus magically goes away. talking mandatory vaccinations. You’re pulling conversation ideal age makeup society result contraception abortion, you’ll find one little tiny thing drag somewhere completely different that. You’re waste time.

Stop anti-science. Start caring neighbors. Get vaccinated. know yet, likely going turn yearly vaccination risk people, like me. pledge drive! Please call hotline pledge life economy! Operators standing by! favorite book time. Mexican American immigrant, made realize people assholes people since forever, immigrants suffering well me.

Also, unless government enforces rules, businesses shit make things safe clean. everyone need seek validation public...... rule plague rat. People like viral infections once.

It's reality. Get it. BMI 20 really aim for, lol. Risk death mechanical ventilation half BMI 25. Gonna start fasting every day! Perpetual acknowledged 24-25 weeks pregnant coming coma, sounds like knew.  

Perpetual name.  

Perpetual. Eating meat glamorous either. full bugs death heart disease.

My body temple life, graveyard death. tagged ""good news"" ? Right large intestine. Moderna Pfizer started analysis 53 cases time reported numbers cases rose 90. imagine we’ll probably see thing happen Astrazeneca Yeah man. El Paso fucked Epidemiologically, interstate travel discouraged. Stock stay home way. True, moreso meaning elementary age younger. know tough them. Especially single parents vaccine

What exactly define that? it’s first responders getting isn’t available general public 2 months later would make disrespecting sociopaths. consider 5 rare. guess different definition word. can't entirely; also can't guarantee people got mild case coronavirus randomly drop dead 3 years either. new, know data far coronavirus deadly vaccine (which deadly all) short run, inclination would take vaccine.

Also, vaccines like tested safety many years, even specific vaccine undergone years study. likelihood safe. seems back defined ""elderly"" 60. seemed moved 65, article 70.

I guess I'm going wait general population. statement made vegans angry. Agree Yes course. BTW, trial still ongoing data going collected another 2 years. **Long lines delayed results plague coronavirus tests Thanksgiving approaches**

I see think people can't get worse... national testing strategy, contact tracing resources, aid states, reducing shutting nonessential interstate travel....they could lot weren’t actively choosing nothing. shutting another vector Seeing patients smile funny conversations made worth lol telenursing last week. I’m school pursue PT, since love orthopedic I’ll able patient interaction future  Cory Coates dumb piece shit  know publish regardless get certain number cases, publish non-ambiguous statistically significant result.

For example hovering around lower bound approval, 60% effectiveness, might wait cases ensure confidence interval straddle threshold. This. course bad. let's act like people long-term covid issues would prefer death.

Chronic pain quite common, majority people would prefer death.

-Someone chronic cluster headaches TMD Agreed, even didn’t care one lick Covid precautions there’s virtually way life same.  would make okay, crazy part. even benefit them.

Ok, save couple bucks PPE. fucked Dr nurses sick/dead, bring locums 3x normal cost.

Worth save bucks PPE? 

Even goal selfishly get much money possible, unless plan gtfo late March 2020, moronic. Perhaps would public assistance masks politicised Thank informative response. went Walmart two days ago tons people wearing masks nose completely pulled down. know anecdotal, I'm pretty sure there's tons places similar mask usage. Meanwhile TN, OPEN THINGS! telling people ignore experts helps get public side? don’t give shit ineffective cleaning Covid, forcing subways shut cleaned I’m it! figured something along lines ship big cities day one, cities immediately break medium sized cities overnight one, eight hospital/nursing home small towns around lines 8 get however many authorized for. day 3, 4 5 shoot arms. 

presumably stage picked would someone could take since city able vaccinate 100% needed course since stage 1 whatever plan. 

when gets shooting average person, would similar plan (if boss) except end line there's 3 days worth walk/drive vaccinations smaller towns plea since start virus. People plain dumb, knew already it’s visible times like these. People don’t give fuck anything themselves. NZ Australia southern hemisphere. helps. God help US winter arrives real. single negative test result means little.  good news?

And else could serve basis quarantine? Remember deaths lagging indicator high hospitalizations unfortunately follows high deaths. hit highest death count six months.. also right highest levels cases, record 185K yesterday hit 175K.. right unfortunately that’s shut downs bars schools  developed world significant chunk vaccinated wit(Assuming least 2-3vaccines approved within coming 1-2 months). India China also OK. question mark Africa. problem know that. know people irl wear mask Trump spent months refusing wear one public Sure is.......sure sure......just relax, gone now.

&amp;#x200B;

.....until suddenly shows somewhere else.

&amp;#x200B;

Give 2 months declare anything all, please. something rotten state denmark :)

but keep wearing mask, protects people around anything might have. Initial: Wuhan locked hard, one allowed leave homes except going downstairs pick grocery delivery, going grocery shopping allowed. 

After: Mass contact tracing, must scan health app code entering public space, contact suspected cases result mandatory testing isolation.

Now: Mass testing cities regular basis whenever new domestic cluster pop up, routine testing essential workers, super strict entrance quarantine, masks still mandatory places. Well joke’s them. don’t get invited family gatherings. say, I’ve Jackson Hole, I’m pretty sure liberal hotbed Wyoming standards.  Yeah classic reddit idiot comparing Stalin even though hurt nobody life.

Life full death, people dying always, serious nonserious reasons, put head sand much want cant change it... thousands people die African everyday nobody bats eye, hundreds die Europe everyone looses shit. Lethality covid even close lethality diseases people poor countries facing everyday. Yet didnt shit pants it. feel CO2 level exceeds 800 ppm. 

I also noticed that, placing glass bottle carbonated soft drink (e.g., Coca Cola) desk, almost immediately spikes CO2 level room couple hundred ppm. live Midwest USA. large public University work opened person classes without ability test symptomatic students. took month start contact tracing, students petitioned it. University test students, symptomatic not, test faculty staff. One older professor already died teaching person classes. Cause death released highly doubt covid tested. Yes, we're messing hard. Also, University gave football coach raise millions put faculty furlough make budget shortcomings. many kids football team covid appears next game cancelled. mask use reached 95%, lockdowns would needed.

Mask use pretty much universal Southern Europe Italy, Spain France par Asia. prevent second wave lockdowns matter. kind Ontario New Brunswick. Proof vaccination required attend school. policy nation wide opinion isn't. Nope. Fuck that. Signed NYC rn full-blown conspiracy nuts—whose voices course amplified social media echo chamber—insist masks inherently dangerous. reason ever problem committed (mink) genocide fur. ""deep clean"" disinfected house 1 day covid positive quarantine ended. good day need ""deep clean"" case got covid germs anything? someone dumb enough pull gun cop mask, getting shot valuable life lesson them.

Anyway “people might get violent law enforced law enforced” fallacy; might well apply logic organized crime pulling people driving drunk. runs full amok Africa, likely dead US around late winter, less noticeable there.

But perhaps really contain effectively there, public data that? curious, what’s like Dakotas? people really living life usual, maskless, literally precautions? fraction actually stay home go absolutely necessary etc?

This might sound weird someone who’s seen everyone area masks six months, restaurants super empty even open, it’s hard believe live life normally even it’s far dangerous are. amount workers masks around chins. Especially dollar general house sickening. county hit 1K cases 40K people Yes. agree. need also cover human side lockdowns well. Go nursing homes interview staff patients like live-and die lockdown.

Talk families ruined suicides, drug abuse, alcoholism, loss livelihood well. Let tell stories. I’m seeing good news Oxford Astrazena? correct assuming vaccines proven successful, faster get people vaccinated globally really stomp thing? need calm down, blow blood vessel. Never asked irritant condescend replies, kindly piss off. Thank you. gotcha...grew neighboring state family says going there.  prematurely stating non-scientific numbers like Pfizer Moderna does,

Good news hard swallow days, get it. proud amazing scientists shit instead? know. meant (second) time he'd technically correct, since *is* point partly responsible lower air travel US, reduces likelihood accident. close think agree completely. headline mentioning making mandatory, start debate person understand mandatory medical procedures controversial? 

Which people seemed react to. I'm trying point right. indeed difference betwen ""mandatory vaccination"" ""condition access things based vaccination"".

The former extremely controversial, latter not.

(The article may latter headline suggests former, know - I'm discussing literal topic ""mandatory vaccination"" - what's article) university work encouraging testing students returning home Thanksgiving. Classes go online next Wednesday. 
Students also encouraged get tested return f2f end January. 
""Encourage"" means jack shit. mandatory. ""young adults"" partying sans masks every Thursday-Saturday bars around campus. give shit! Completely disregarding cultural importance certain dates ""not rational"" naive irrational also big time cringy... wish people could see lockdowns eyes nursing home residents. 

There easy answers. need help people, big portion afraid pandemic rather believe virus doesnt exist. Common physiological state dealing dangerous diseases.  There's much room effective mRNA vaccines. 

If waiting get 100 overall cases going get slightly later 99% effective vaccine versus 95% effective one. parents offended used 'Amber Alert' system that's 'emergencies like abductions stuff'. I'm astounded father who's first responder whole life get qualifies. Hell, used tell us stories kids foolish people would ignore evacuation orders floods hurricanes is! 😞 also believe that. Trump laughed away saying vaccine doorstep. confirmed vaccine came days lost election. doctor retired whole group doctors. Happens time course know also Covid province ( Canadian hope okay post not.... Sorry). Anyway premier destroyed Health care system young get health. getting bad parts Canada, cannot even begin imagine you, neughbours souths' medical people  suffering through🥺 Thats certainly possible, probably worst case outcome. expect people get 6 months immunity, hopefully another 6 months 'mild' disease caught. shots timed fall, think work ok. experts without public’s assistance stop spread? sure that, someone biochemistry background, know viruses cellular. Ok, others die yesterday counted weeks now, evens out. Let’s go!! sucks people can’t understand yet ☹️ hope soon Yeah got told either relocate take job packed field trailers job anymore...

Nobody wears mask even attempts social distance. 3 people per office impromptu meetings 8 people every day 10' 10' office I'm in.

At least still income though. Remember people attributing reduction cases herd immunity? ""HIT actually 20-30% we're already there!""

They've gotten real quiet though. Powerful failed state energy. happening official US enemy regime media would questioning legitimacy, since west failing media treats perfunctorily, sun rising east. long enough know this. Plenty people infected first surge still issues it. It’s 8 months. I'm here, dude Yeeep. Everyone’s family special people’s families. Everyone thinks break rules it’s fine. used think roaches dumb taking poison bait back nests. mention big thing businesses doing; improving air ventilation. costs money, sanitizing states deaths accumulated many different dates bolded bottom summary. understand disappointment, Gu man, previous work invaluable, &amp; stage important drive home reality taken place forecast disease may progress fair, isn’t uniquely American problem. get info FDA EUA regulations. get from?

Not interests pharma companies, get it. possible? seven months it’s finally getting better, exercised 10 minutes today first time lol hang words, reinfected.  Trump Fembot governor says everything going great. idiots won’t hammer home use masks avoid lockdowns something don’t understand. publish results decline submit emergency use approval? learned signed trial 2/3 getting vaccine, 1/3 getting placebo. 

It could taking longer infections pop subjects vaccinated, maybe? God selfish. vaccine get us pandemic. realize millions dying, right? realize people's mental health deteriorating, right? realize economy collapsing, right? realize children regressing back diapers, right? participate solution *could* hurt *you*? Fuck you. mean ""human manipulation viruses?"" Seasonal viruses always mutated naturally part vaccines able eradicate them. SARS hearty virus outside body, easily killed even basic soap water doctor wipes everything touch Lysol wipe right touch it.

We need trust medical professionals. Every piece medical advice give us slow spread totally infallible based rock solid science isn’t debate. Even medical officials different countries disagree. Anyone disagrees medical professionals anything science-denier. mom said I'd go blind :/ Seems really skinny. 6'0 175 pretty lean. would cut 147lbs make BMI 20. done since make weight college, last 7lbs water.

Yes, need yell name Lord top lungs hour. spreader enough. Correct. Confirmed reinfections newsworthy. Yes set high bar confirmed reinfection, millions millions cases worldwide. used butcher every winter we're getting old back-breaking work now. sausage made, sage, italian, bratwurst, never tasted better. actual Italian lady making seasoning, miss Mrs M, took great pride making right (like measure anything, handful). Well, exercise important, outside gym right now. I've actually really good keeping healthy year. Sweden one worst outbreaks per capita spring, recently imposed strict guidelines, they're really applicable. Rapid tests already difficult get consistent results on. factor saliva typically way less virus, much harder target. S.Dakota lady real piece shit. really see real McDumbasses leadership positions scary see number people still believe absolute idiocrity. ""mAsKS lOcKDowNs wOooOrKK"" bruh...

No. vaccines live virus. going immune evasion effects ability destroy germinal centers like wild type virus has.  Gotta say point shouldn’t expand Covid facilities expense regular beds. regular beds ICU completely full last months. people deserve care too. It’s hard leave work see everyone eating shopping maskless think let people die save them. Gotta burn extra calories packing bar night somehow, brah. Hawaii Vermont two states dealt well throughout entire pandemic. 

Not without issues, almost every country those. source? I'm familiar diseases work/spread. historical example, Europeans came Americas spread diseases even actively infected time, like cholera, small pox, influenze, etc?  don’t know this. haven’t given evidence back claim. burden proof, me. 
It reminds Trump honestly, know idiot making worse. 

“I could release tax returns they’re audit”
“Massive voter fraud! bad country!” agree you. know masks important step still need wash hands often avoid touching face, surfaces need disinfected too. take “it’s airborne” maybe airborne provides higher viral load it’s right lungs. guess. I’m sure anyone could really know without extended clinical trials seems safer disinfect now. Mmmm. False  articulated distilled bottom line better I. exactly feel. bordering ungovernable disparate values sentiments, least kept union together thus far maintain benefits united keeping local autonomy mitigates separatist tendencies. fragile balance, good necessary one union continued aim. small world view have.

Wisconsin still packed bars stupid people drive across border go good time. happened spring mask mandates FIBS driving shop wisconsin. least natural border minnesota. great news. Sorry, cynicism got best me. hardly consider essential tough time navigating many exposures quarantine periods. None us feel like matter certainly treated such. would par course denied early access vaccine. True, mask mandates would cut down. bigger picture case count deaths go down, things going back normal time soon.

Now used living basement never seeing daylight, matter much, us lives miss normalcy going date nights significant others, drinks local watering hole. see many days let people die FDA cuts red tape approve vaccine. Sorry feels hurt.

Healthy social interaction reduces stress fact keep immune system healthy. one reasons solitary confinement one worst punishments prisoners many human rights organizations it. 

The question is, effects covid outweigh negative health effects social distancing? I'm going follow consensus advice health experts that's got many people dying, unlike depression heart disease, death immediate permanent.

Having said that, there's going immense immeasurable public health consequences social distancing last generations - mental physical health-wise. nudge many people path lifetime mental illness contributing factor autoimmune disorders diseases. 

This damned do, damned situation there's much anger, fear, violence, etc. surrounding whole episode reveals inability many us speak listen empathetically others' needs feelings find ways come understand one another. right move. I’m sure study really suggests seems. 42 infections mask group 53 non-mask group suggest benefit (26%) even it’s statistically significant. error bidirectional, meaning larger sample size it’s possible could 50% risk reduction rather 0. 

And risk reduction flawed study design self reporting. wouldn’t expect everyone mask group would wear one time 2% population sake scientific research marginal benefit expected.

Lastly don’t think we’ll ever get data would surprised it’s case masks protect wearers infected person also wearing mask. That’s case wearer would already receiving greatly reduced viral load. think enjoy photo Piggly Wiggly.

Macy’s nonessential retailers temporarily close stores spring, [sapping sales tipping several Mexico issued stay-at-home order told nonessential stores shut doors customers Nov. 30, would include Black Friday sales weekend. Supermarkets retailers get 30% revenue food sales could stay open, big-box chains like [Best Co. [BBY **0.90%** Hobby Lobby, [Dick’s Sporting Inc.

Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said interview Thursday company demonstrated could operate stores—which large accommodate social distancing—safely pandemic. company, along retail-trade groups, lobbying state local officials ensure stores remain open Covid-19 cases rise.

“We hope don’t get locked definition essential nonessential,” Mr. Gennette said.

Trade groups, including National Retail Federation Retail Leaders Association, contacting state governors educate steps members taken make stores safe, requiring customers wear masks, said spokesmen groups.

But unclear successful efforts coronavirus cases mount. governor New Mexico said ordered nonessential businesses close state set records daily new cases, Covid-19 hospitalizations deaths.

“New Mexicans must stay home stop spread prevent needless mass casualties throughout state,” said Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, Democrat. “This real. debate.”

Other essential retailers, according New Mexico order, include hardware stores, automobile bike-repair shops, laundromats dry cleaners. Supermarkets retailers stay open must limit capacity 25% occupancy 75 people close 10 p.m.

The NRF filed public-information request learn New Mexico policy makers decided businesses deem essential, according David French, group’s senior vice president government relations.

Like retailers, Macy’s limiting store capacity requiring shoppers wear masks, keeping state guidelines. installed plexiglass cash registers, signs throughout stores instruct shoppers stay 6 feet apart. beauty departments offer “no-touch” consultations. Customers must use hand sanitizer trying fine jewelry watches. handful fitting rooms open given time sanitized frequently.

Mr. Gennette said chain’s stores making gradual recovery closing temporarily pandemic’s initial surge spring. said company’s locations large cities like New York Chicago remain challenged due fewer office workers tourists.

For fall quarter, Macy’s revenue fell 23% $3.99 billion compared $5.17 billion year ago. Comparable sales—which include e-commerce sales stores open least year—fell 20% period ended Oct. 31.

#### company closing weaker stores focusing investment best locations. also cutting expenses corporate jobs. company [said would eliminate 3,900 June trimming 2,000 February.

Macy’s lost $91 million recent period, compared profit $2 million year earlier. Profit margins improved lower inventory allowed company sell items full price.

Macy’s girding holiday season unlike other. Similar retailers, company started offering Black Friday deals October, instead Thanksgiving week, Mr. Gennette said.

The people feel sorry ones cannot take vaccine.

But, saw Mayo clinic article. said we'd need 70% get herd immunity. Numbers I've seen 40% refuse take it. 60% getting vaccine, that's 10% need infected recovered. That's 33 million. We've 11 million confirmed cases. number people actually infected much higher that.

So, 60% get vaccine, hit 70% herd immunity number Mayo clinic said we'd need. Fuck Tyson much!!! Freedom speech permit yell 'fire' crowded cinema. “Herd mentality”.  brainwashed.

It’s basically protein virus.There’s nothing could give side effect. made laugh That's exactly. Well said. Nashville, TN school system followed: 

COVID protocol: 
If contact someone infected, tell school go virtual 2 weeks. students teachers quarantines. student road confirmed infected quarantine students “sat close” maybe teacher. student learns 5 days someone sick, quarantines sick, cause gradual chain reaction. It’s important note schools also still recess kids interact anyways. It’s horribly ineffective basically half show keeping schools open important children’s health. 

Pre-K 4 went back Fall Break. staff unless verified physician need stay home must school, even virtual teachers. First week test school active 300 student, dozen infections quarantines there. Plans 5th grade higher canceled next semester (Jan). 

Fast forward 1-1.5 months, infection rates high enough running staff infections/quarantines. email sent it’s almost certainty whole district goes back virtual. It’s lot fun. absolute fucking ghouls. Yeaah part Plague inc. sit back wait game win itself.  caring caring zero affect outcome - therefore **no** - don’t care. I’ll sleep blissfully tonight.  that’s case vaccine going work? quarantine forever? Well, earlier pandemic testing capacity really expanded case lot southern states. covidtracking appeared basically testing people hospitals (or least guess, new tests new positives would practically line one one). could mixture indifferent population, uninterested local government ineffective management thus get positivity rates like that. allow nurses wear n95’s change surgical mask top patients also said concerts sporting events would never come back. in-person school. purge? Project warp speed definite success!  quite people rebelling restrictions politicians always seem listen wrong crowd. Many us sucking dealing it. Whatever need survive others whining social distancing masks able go favorite bar get drunk go party whatever you. 

Its getting worse everywhere people arent listening. time start late them. leave house 3 days Biden president move appointment good. Honest question, want people do? good freaking do? 

The fact we’ve dealing almost year now, people made minds won’t already. doesn’t matter bad things get. 

Wringing hands constant fret nobody good probably wrecks mental health. 

All us point need keep close us safe, anything outside control. vaccine articles seem talk Moderna Pfizer vaccines.

Recent articles obviously focus two results they've put out. Plus, subreddit mainly focuses US least half reddit american. US get pfizer and/or moderna's vaccines get approved opposed china's russia's, obvious sub cares pfizer/moderna more. see much mention candidates

You'll look specific articles search bar sometimes good news flair. Stories sinopharm sputnik V always treated suspicion likely get many upvotes all. also found narcolepsy wasn’t actually caused vaccine, even cause individuals, number astronomically low. likely bribed officials federal emergency designation. Passes safety checks hands greased cash truth. .... exactly cigs meant do.

*Tapping head gif* Go donate blood, many places antibody screening free People plan everyone nice Vancs-giving everyone want attend gotten vaccinated properly &amp; given time take effect :) remember vaccines generally take couple weeks people make enough antibodies &amp; first vax likely approved two shots must timed 2nd dose. Politicians aren’t suited leaders desperate situations. Sweden’s failing regard similar places. It’s sad literally copied comment vaccine post earlier october 30th AP reported north dakota 200 regular beds 20 icu beds left. I’m thinking Vermont snowbirds staying home year. rates way lower Florida. usually visit friends Orlando thanksgiving Christmas. way I’m getting plane visiting Florida Vaccines widely administered. Thanksgiving, Black Friday, Christmas, New Years celebrations....add winter that. 

The virus like ball rolling hill. It’s starting pick momentum unless drastic measures put place miraculously people decide partake gathering coming holidays (unlikely) it’s going pick lot speed coming months vaccines time make impact. obviously make big difference, way USA heading there’s going lot pain happens.   Elaborate then, vaccine going stop summer. simply many people vaccinate. Even Fauci tell people blink eye back normal. people, clearly failing going die, still say fake. .. take prize 

Good lord people stupid  Okay, maybe I'm way loop, Pfizer Moderna ready millions doses today?

Sometimes actually wonder far would go noticed well. physically laborious job major airport city working outside. got furloughed April I've home since living parents. used get bad cold two three times per year since I've home sick anything all. 

So nice. Since I've stuck home allowed opportunity work physical self. trying work work losing weight. Scott Atlas tweet ignore CDC inbound 3,2,1... Let's kid ourselves, spike caused directly uncoordinated, misled, ill-followed approach mitigating controlling spread virus.

This ""pandemic fatigue"" crap another way pin mistakes people, rather leadership, utter complete lack thereof... Black friday shopping = black funeral December. People need stop insisting protestors ""stormed"" Michigan capitol. Open carry legal Michigan capitol. protestors enter building guns legally allowed carry.

Also every protest left-wing people ""clashed"" cops, dozens nothing happened. blame cops people Minneapolis decided loot Target. evidence covid-19 supported human human contraction either. tens thousands cases already left china. china waited anything time perform study virus?

It takes time study new virus. pandemic. make rational decisions based information available right now. information said virus incompatible vaccine spreading humans right Yeah, 20s I'm definitely scared .08% mortality rate age group. Thinking I'm going keep taking risk though.   feel like done month ago. Plans made. God, man. People like you. even try make arguments? 

It's let anyone whatever want cars. regulated absolute bejesus vehicular travel. We've collectively spent billions trillions improve efficiency safety, require licenses operate vehicles require licenses periodically renewed.

The CDC estimates every 1 person killed car accident, 8 people injured. CDC also estimates around 34,000 people die year car accidents. that'd 275,000 hospitalizations car accidents year.

For COVID-19, nine months seen 250,000 deaths, least 530,000 hospitalizations (with 36 states/territories reporting).

These nowhere ballpark. Get real. people really stupid? pandemic kill pneumonia- know! I'll fuck lungs even more! Yeah, think pathological short-term thinking another facet problem. Also Halloween Obviously, Reddit helping one labeling everyone path narcissist. vast majority people narcissists. narcissistic want better yourself, use religion (which many people truly believe doing). make some, better nothing Aw Damn. I'm sorry hear that!  Yea I’m pretty confident Covid going dealing lot chaos decade 
Bring 2020s So... Swedish recommendations regarding long isolate positive test? I'm saying good news, actually said start smoking, thing said smoked less likely get it? I'm sure months ago might disproved. Oh man owned magats!!!!1! live Chicago immediate family lives Nebraska. I've made decision stay city Thanksgiving go home, Christmas gonna different story. wonder things then, they'll urge us travel home well. Pretty likely, I'd guess, that's holiday people *really* wanna miss. Wow! right point they're off-putting. Well, big deal is, I’m sure every string pulled going get things moving again. Nice, that’ll make everyone stay home. Problem solved! basically nothing most, especially already living campus Republicans finally getting wanted long: bunch dead poor people. show em. /s

This fucking insane. fast first antimaskers start bullshit March ""quarantine""? 2 weeks? 2 days? seemed like immediately popped up. Labcorp changed policy get home test kits. they're prioritizing people symptoms doctor's request covid test limiting daily amount kits send keep turnarounds times quick test results. symptoms try order test early morning run daily allowance! mean actual long term evidence affects human 5, 10, 20 years that’s data simply make up

So want get 20 years worth data giving vaccine. sounds like holding closet 20 years exactly telling concoction ingredients going react body.

Research. information there. Though list ingredients upcoming vaccines, pretty much assume they'll use delivery systems vaccines use. hard find scientific, peer-reviewed, research effects vaccines, delivery systems vaccine. google, right now, Flu vaccine ingredients find plethora resources breaking every single ingredients, is, specifically gave source wether want read manipulation going right choose take Vaccine 

To put bluntly, source garbage. one mans anecdotal evidence, smudging numbers meet agenda, vaccine. 

It's also sad actually understand science works. vaccine going get released ""Hey, government! works, take it!"".

The vaccine's studies findings be, currently, independently peer-reviewed. manipulation, smudged numbers, discovered pretty fast. wait independent studies come make mind, would understand that. But, long vaccine ready, time actually yes Vaccine different Flu Vaccine multitude reasons, obvious developed deemed safe within months. 

Irrelevant. need perspective. know much fucking money thrown this? entire modern world giving blank checks companies get vaccines? one hell difference that, flu vaccine. 

The flu vaccine takes 5-6 months develop average. Now, throw blank check that. think could get done much faster limitless bodies money? 73.6 million people. second Biden votes ever received Retail workers won’t get shit probably get laid since brick mortar stores losing money.

Health care workers ones need paid most. significant financial incentive, many health care workers soon quit. Free cool aid everyone! say National guards mowed protesters big baby take pictures lmao Maybe like peeing lake? kid pool told peed it, would really enthusiastic jumping in, even end? lose housing privileges next semester.

Edit: see coronavirus troll account. Figure something productive time. Oddly enough, North Carolina relatively well compared states. They're 47.02 deaths per 100k, vs US per capita average 74.81.

Congrats 
 isolated little swiss village, rest us live real world. pretty great ! rsn: ometiklan hmu. Nobody claiming masks 100% effective. study quote certain limitations even take numbers indicating directly effectiveness masks, difference R value 0.95 (contained) 1.1 (exponential growth)

Without masks need stronger lockdown rules contain spread. much masks may debatable, mitigate spread measure impact mobility. choosing masks closed businesses travel restrictions, choice obvious. notification caused rando downvote comment almost immediately made. post little traffic, comment bit deep. 1918 pandemic, public refusing wear mask well. much political time American public refuses sacrifices personal liberty. say extreme level political divide terms believe everything political Eleventy-billionth time:

The point masks protect virus. mask *reduce* virulent particles air, *of person wearing mask*.

If wear mask, cover may asymptomatic.

Wear stupid mask. way thinking leads white supremacist ideas. white person black (or non-white) person child, child black; way blackness spreads whiteness eradicated. Thus conspiracy great replacement non-white races fuck whites existence. Even love togetherness threat ""white race.""

Remember, race real operate real. race racialized groups people. helps think race *assigned* me, humans, real thing biology culture. I'm American south, common southerners even nearby northern Americans whether southerners white, black, Hispanic, whatever. again, America many racialized groups common experiences racialization placed upon them. Even though Vietnamese immigrants Japanese immigrants came different cultures ethnicities, along racial lines US ""Asian"" perhaps ""Oriental."" use flatten people reduce appearance one slight aspect appearance.

Remember, nonsense. made up. says New York 3 day isolation testing recommendation, that’s enforced, she’s coming from. None based fact, it’s like say, she’s crossing fingers making wish. would coming us isolating air bnb coming us might push longer 7 unfortunately it’s house call :/ deadly virus care pretend exist. keep spreading creating larger, expensive, inhumane disaster recognize natural disaster take adequate precautions avoid it. Oh no.

Anyways. decider made go oh shit, awful Corona farts. Lol thanks trying (;  That's hill die on, literally. Freedom deaths? fact rushing saying safe couple months bothersome. I'm vaccines certainly first line. Exactly! SCMP reported many aspect virus back January February, actions reports coming English language media sounds reports exist. Frustrating indeed. part finds funny months ago considered Oxford vaccine best shot recent news Pfizer Moderna vaccines finding still well like 

""Oh yeah, that's also still thing it?"" Canada 2 week isolation travellers. sister know don’t?

I'm trying make comparisons - I'm looking move over.

I'm remote area nurse Australia, I'm around $116,654 (US) per annum. including benefits. 

I work week on/week twenty odd days paid vacation per year.

NGL, would work Canada though, even paid less. correct, testing negative whether infected not, five days sounds good. Mask good lessens chance infection nowhere near 100%, get tested can. China number COVID positive cases explainable contact frozen imported foods. traces found frozen foods. New Zealand. Serious question: history pandemic nobody believed became political?

Now I'm older, wiser nurse, see connection politics nursing know paying attention? Hate say may need strike demand reforms safety mandates. poor advice. Canada recommend 14 days.  shit nestle gets company million times worse Yeah isn’t vaccine kids yet. won’t herd immunity school building population building still spread it. Additionally, best best case scenarios nothing goes wrong, vaccine won’t make general adult population later spring/summer. really great job convincing Swedes right thing.

In eyes thats made approach dangerous rest Europe. governments politicians saw overwhelming PR success instinctively confused actual success. I'm curious makes curious. Yeah excess mortality like 30% higher official death count? vector movement aerosol virus particles droplets air pretty simple stuff.*  really. reports lab studies posted showing contradictionary results influence air moisture spread virus particles. comes small things, common sense trusted.

This wrote first. objection statement **simple stuff**. simple, shown contradictionary results reported summer. never claimed question whether particles actually move air. Like wrote, far travel obvious. There's single irrefutable source (edit: proves person gotten COVID fomite spread). One report China elevator button... Blumberg, MD, chief pediatric infectious diseases UC Davis Children's opinion, chance transmission inanimate surfaces small, instances infected person coughs sneezes surface, someone else touches surface soon cough sneeze (within 1-2 hours),"" Goldman wrote. Basically, would take perfect combination events Blumberg described get sick touching something contaminated studies proved virus stays alive surfaces -- catch touching surfaces. ""They prove survive surface, transmitted way,"" Blumberg I'm sure scenario trying suggest. One 9/11 day keeps sanity away workers pledge treat patients well matter what, massive strike letting thousands die would question them.

Do nurses take pledge oath? didn't.

We code conduct (in country). legally binding, consequences negligence immoral conduct. 

This different though. I'm protected union - vote industrial action, state health care provider sort shit out. humanity stage stupidity ever encounters real threat, could fought easily covid off, great scale extinction. handful critical thinkers would survive, sheep not. scary bit death toll start rise quicker hospital capacity runs out... Weak, unrelated, cliche Again, US would average get many deaths. make baseless projections like. Also potential spread sewer system apartment buildings, NYC notoriously full of. mean, indoctrinate entire country 60 years neoliberal corporatism, sole purpose empowerment wealthy minority, get. form capitalism source problems. I'm retired RN. way hell I'd go back nursing way things ran total disregard safety healthcare workers. Even could renew license, way would. It’s low population density buuut also limited gathering places tend gather one place. Like church. We’re already capping covid floors full icu. holidays haven’t even hit yet (SE PA) Lol source? 
Medical workers take pledge sort. family come getting tested quarantining before. gift keeps giving. another reason avoided this. try warn people know everything virus, ignore think mild case fine. would fine that's was. might turn simple. Honestly, relatable. Kind grandparents. friend got coronavirus wearing N95 grocery store route exposure. general public well trained PPE procedures probably rubbed eye got cross contamination removing mask got groceries individually sanitized.

You *can* really safe good procedures equipment training management support, vast majority population isn’t following hospital’s SOPs even considering people grocery store aren’t going using N95 level masks.

This tool help slow spread among *general public* notifying even people poor procedures need extra cautious potential exposure. He’s copycatting Bunker Boy.

No masks all. FLOOR Apparently Uruguay great, great see use power competence something actually helps people once. Dude go read studies. qatar ones come mind. There's reason debate this. Nah, yelling makes so. saying, rebellious nature. Turns peoples entire worldview easily manipulated tell way things young enough age. Bud suggest head r/covid19. There's plenty studies show wrong. take word it, head now. got much better accurate information plus believe mods expertise field. husband ER doctor near Tyson plant said April seeing 20-30 infected people day Tyson plant height “first wave.” 

It ridiculous $500 incentive perfect attendance pandemic. assholes! dooming us period lowered economic growth!

The Horror! Anything sluggish economic growth! UK Oxford one main vaccine. ordered 5million doses Moderna (wont get Spring) Pfizer stored low temperatures logistical nightmare. Oxford one could still approved either two. Daily. major problem retrospective studies, significant biases may affect selection controls. coming labour economics, interest people feeling safe work.

The problem diverging masks could take affect undermines whole argument change due masks. give 13% change 10 days.

The equation convert growth rate R exp(growth rate×cycle). 

R=R0(1-interventions)(1-immunity)

It relevant even check people wearing masks.

We agreed, harm wearing masks, diverge agreement people start believe answer. ICU? answer ICU defined differently Sweden. someone basically racially homgebous country, assure barrier treating poor people like shit. Unfortunately state deficit 10s billions. wish could can’t really afford much lockdown without federal help don’t think people listen anyway.

Good idea floss elevator ""I aimed public's heart... hit stomach"" - Sinclair Literally confirmed US Supreme Court.  Yes technically possible, human nature dictates different. Unfortunately, can't ask nicely people stay home months. need federal government set federally mandated lockdown create support systems like stimulus bills (not bill $1200 one time thing bs) keep us home supported. things place along closures person dining, malls, etc. could successfully mitigate worst pandemic. need push government care people. can't yelling individuals, need attack root cause problem.

People wearing masks good business! need start showing MSM hospital willing pay 3 times staff nurses monthly wage per week tells something! least Ill house debt paid end 2021 people keep stupid wearing masks. look glass half full.

P.S. healthcare system cant supply proper PPE ill walk off. contract covid unit mid june proper PPE fine minute cant supply Ill back home family riding like March June! Staff safe there.  Netherlands Live Northern Idaho, gotten Washington Southern Idaho. think even Montana. shut though? Always kind hated middle teat class bam, everyone's phone goes scares shit me. one law thing wear face side-effects.

A law exercise is, effect, criminalizing shape. intrudes actual bodily autonomy makes government responsible determining exercise intolerance, old engage enough exercise, kinds exercise count... list goes on. untenable.

Versus, again, asking wear helpful little piece fabric face public. Easy see, easy regulate, zero downsides.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* old article? Police state police state. country spent 50 years Cold War socialist country might opposite socialist: facist post for, say, don’t know, reason want, good sir, contemptuous anytime please. 

I’ve Switzerland! Beautiful scenery. Middle Europe, said, far removed real world. UK recommends 10 days well. probably countries go 10 days US UK. Unfortunately, death cure that. tough distractions around unlike person. Checking emails. Phone right there. Seeing work right front laptop. things phone  said based data ""studies"" deal studies. misleading. also clear covid deaths/total cases outcome = mortality. said along. Florida lucky enough put Remote since Covid began around March.

For reason, July, upper management got boner people returning work soon. plans Fall complete reopening. fell case numbers way high still, course, decided since fully reopen, starting July, come work least one day week entire shift.

No reason, stated goals. ""our policy remote workers must work one in-person shift week"". literally job, way remotely days, needed arbitrarily choose shift work others during.

So, go short Sunday night shift 7pm-midnight literally nobody else building even college campus Security. Impressive zone long. yesterday's Biontech vaccine results show vaccinating older people may sufficient allow hospital breath again. ""Welcome Costco, love you."" pretty disingenuous here. handful critical thinkers would survive, sheep not.

It's random. work like that. perfect example dunning-kruger effect xD think avoided hospital collapse april summer warming things up, start long winter student loan debts 

Student loan debts person incurred debt. Go less expensive school. pandemic restrictions 

The 16-30 age group question responsible restrictions age group. fact ive seen people age group large social groups without following protocols group. highest-ever recorded rates 18- 29-year-olds living parents. 

Once take personal responsibility. 20 years ago, roommates lived crappy apartments slum lords. us (with roommates) got housing outside city drove 30-60 minutes day quite bit cheaper. different driving 30 minutes 20 traffic lights 30 minutes freeway. first ""home"" outside parents $200 month single wide tin mobile home. 40 hr work week min wage job 

Local walmart pays $15 hour find apartments day long $600. thing changed young people become spoiled many young respondents said ""misguided"" people 40 often ones defying public health guidelines worsening pandemic. 

That true all. actually younger people often worse offenders. might catch older person going store without mask see groups teens/college adults hanging groups masks social distancing lot. [A recent article points towards well. Young people less likely follow social distancing older adults. 

What young people understand yet, get older trade false sense invincibility real sense mortality. Self preservation tends kick older less risks health likely take. 

The problem older people people 50 hard time grasping fake news sensationalism. life filled news presented facts could trust doctors, scientists, somewhat politicians. doctors consistent, scientists. Information facebook twitter social media. know believe. believe fits observations. see people getting sick. know anyone covid. must another fake story sensationalism whatever. careless, struggle pick real information fake never to. convince 99% people wearing masks store bought ""fake news"" virus real. 

On hand, young people grew world pick truth lies, fact check even ""reputable"" sources. know wear mask, distance, etc. care. see deal virus important life unfair everyone else's fault life screwed right can't get shit together ruining lives. hurt anyway bother. Covid old person problem, let old people deal it...Its fault anyway running world right now. 

The logic fail young people worst spreaders. mostly mild symptoms all. mild might mistake covid common cold. pick friends spread family. young, probably telling ""yeah wearing mask, yeah social distancing, hang friends person."" family believes want believe them, know true. age. fooling anyone. know. mask, friends, distancing. 

You picking virus without knowing spreading us. wonder got probably wont think child promised us wearing masking social distancing. must guy grocery store walked wearing mask. tell else could picked up? dont go anywhere. 

But know true. see, statistically speaking, picking covid non mask wearer highly unlikely.  inhale significant amount contaminated air means would basically stand let shower us covid minutes. No,it's going someone close us, someone protect from. Someone thinks invincible betray us. old man store believe covid real.  It’s actually really really hope I'm underestimating him, worry work hard he's still sulking election. cutting hair since March isolating alone apartment ... agree. frustrating. What, pissed Dictator aka Belt Road Dan's blatant abuse human rightz? Everything insulin 1000% markup. prescription medication generic least 10 years ~300 USD USA. like 30 CAD back home insurance. get it.  Brother, yes, need chat him. positive 14 days. what’s PFR? ""Nah, like covid19""

-many churches us :(  think US last November know anyone, (and thus, roommate) Japan got it. seems widespread masking led lower viral doses spread, suspected hundreds thousands reported actually contracted it, testing restricted really get accurate picture.  ""How could misinformation possibly stronger natural survival instincts?""

With decades cold war practice overriding people's natural instinct become socialist. Still shit ton uncivilised people living countries. It’s really helping situations Dont forget selfishness  mostly thinking loud/wishful thinking. get frustrated. I'm fortunate live (most) people take masks seriously. know fault actually believe current administration's lies.  Seeing we're half year this, ignorance valid excuse anymore. Europe turning around right now? Lol ""Free delivery!"" coupons kill me. Still ends 8$ tip... thanks. following science. anything regulations allow least Texas wearing basics wearing mask (but fine taking eat drink indoor spaces) people would insulted suggested truth opinion, they’re great job. exactly reading? Sadly, state currently overly saturated many people needing tests, enough test centers. earlier appointment could get next week lol.

It sound spurious, miss typed info going sleep. 

To clarify; friend ill (staple signs covid. Thought flu), hung out, roommate got ill 13 days afterwards. 

Right now, reason rather accurately say it’s covid instead cold I’ve lot experience respiratory illnesses. I’ve coughs bad RSV really bad asthma everything between. cough isn’t like one get cold flu. hurt; lot. first time actually afraid dying since RSV 20 years ago. guess body doesn’t forget fear.

The big thing made mostly certain covid; loss smell/taste. I’ve never a... lack taste. I’ve food tastes bad congestion; it’s total lack taste it’s almost surreal. 

There’s little doubt mind isn’t covid. 

I honestly lot doubt first time around wasn’t covid-19 either, apparent anti-bodies, would seem direct contact positive person time, didn’t develop bad symptoms now. Visit linked subreddit risk. may high amount misinformation.

Sure, clean things generally hygienic, much weaken immune system. one day dangerous virus returns, fact bodies t-cell response antibodies fight something similar huge problem U sound paranoid.  worked Tyson 2008-2009 assure normal behavior plant managers long time. try avoid buying Tyson products several reasons, especially time working there, guy got fired got caught dick fully processed (ready packaging) chicken...... also, amount bandaids I, personally, found line, staggering. fuck supposed stop eating fucking *meat* though? can't vegan already problems keeping weight. Plus think vegans deluded that's another topic. can't find meat ethically treated price afford. thought went away warm? Moderna essentially products straight trash could misinformation possibly stronger natural survival instincts?

That point really hit me. think people dumb dumb. Oh please time comes areas. different? Well serious comment well known joke Australia non australians. person trying lighten mood. wasnt hypocritical, joke. Australians love adding joke, especially telling tourists Drop Bears. common fodder Australian comedians too. get stressful time, thats even reason bit laugh  Get fucking people positions. much resistance fucking mask. De Jong’s virus samples sequenced Reusken’s lab, surprising outcome: sequences identical, showed much similarity RIVM virologist Harry Vennema says probably clear virus April started replicate June. “I lot stress first episode grandmother died,” De Jong says. “Maybe impact immune system.” call moving goalpost  Fuck. eat beyond meat. can't eat people cause health reasons. //sweats 
Deffff avoiding others though. least make impact all, sadly big kind redditors it. one people suit one size fits medications/vaccines. worth risk virus survivability high age group. official excess mortality stats available online Poland? usual sites (Euromomo example) seem data Poland. Eleventy really big problem expected find several tens thousands reinfections already among first million infected beginning, based current infection rates. infected covid-19 looked like vaccine trial, would compare pretty favourably vaccine candidates, far least. U.S. 60% caucasian.

I'll let rest math. Sometimes, corporate officers upper level management need actual prison time. seems one times. findings consistent previous research. Health experts long said mask provides limited protection person wearing it, **but dramatically reduce risk others wearer infected, even showing symptoms.**

Why people treat second part though meaningless? Young people continuing socialize spreading virus killing people. OP handle told cant play mario party think Biden largely late. major new initiative (such as, say, proper national contact tracing initiative) take time get ground, government isn’t exactly known agility. time initiative would ready make impact, already something much better policy side - we’ll tens millions doses highly effective vaccine flowing population, Rt cratering then. Hahahahaha, oh wow dude isn't. Man need reading topic given uncertainty, yeah, makes sense ultra careful.

but makes sense really careful that, require wear mask indoors strangers.

or, allowing visitors, large gatherings etc. Thanks condescension lad. I'm managing better most, I've plenty productive. amount positive spin going sugarcoat shower shite year. usual reddit saddo army enjoys WFH parrots 'learn skill home learn spend time yourself' overly introverted spiel change me. There's nothing 'weak' acknowledging year total 35 planet low, fact vast majority people. Thank lot :) lol think daily deaths double December 2nd. Even IHME doesn’t anywhere close that. That’s works. Computational models, especially advanced approaches cannot develop vaccine. models help us approach issue. Please read claiming quantitative advantage. well 6,000 complete study, already spreading misinformation 30 words in. Wow, young generation hating elderly. That's new one. /s They've 789 cases far. county population closer 14,000, number pulled 2010.

Just small county mean wear masks. They're 5% infected, heading 10%. think hospital capacity handle there? No, they'll get sent hospitals bigger cities, rural conservatives bailed fucking mess. article today (Nov 19th) SaraLee always seemed wholesome find she’s akin nazi. looks bad, otherwise mechanically sound game decent quests pvp know, Trump got changed moronic approach. mean, stoners tend homebodies, maybe... Yeah, fuck guy. Yeah, then, using term “hoax” disingenuous obviously pushing agenda. Air circulation. get lot recycled air indoors cycles covid around building. Everything ""fresh"" outdoors.

One best things right switch away air recycling indoors. cost prohibitive scale would need. could written exact comment. voted Ed too, love job Lina Hidalgo doing. hope see rise higher political levels. Glad someone talking sense. either, someone history adverse reactions one size fits medications/vaccinations. really trust FDA approvals Trump administration tbh. Mississippi also! 100% agree. little social distancing lot complacency. QLD one guy working 2nd shift pizza shop local transmission. QLD needs assume if. I'm glad I'm alone here. generally avoid fast food, done years. Wherever I've lived worked, people raved Chick-Fil-A. wife gave one afternoon swung drive thru see hype about. saltiest, mediocre chicken I've ever had. gone back since.  rare Chiniese visitors turing Covid-19 positive mandatory screening.

That's true. According Korean CDC, [China exported total 27 cases Korea entire pandemic](http://www.kdca.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=a20501000000&amp;bid=0015), 4312 total.

Without looking up, many covid cases deaths think China reported last month? agree. Imagine rushing put PPE gear watching someone gasping breath window. 
Also, wonder nursing schools seeing decrease applications? means charge entire floor patients doctors. That's typically responsibility doctor within hospital call. u/trampledbyacentaur, like u/trampledbybasicmaths would depend big paycheque might lead to... find something cower fear about. Don’t worry. mean data like basing 90 95 percent mask compliance personal observations estimates. Hardly scientific. Regardless activity people is, response people NEED isolate quarantine properly. I’m sorry government failing medical advice countries getting ahead isolation, quarantine massive contact tracing. Advising otherwise dangerous. Everyone know advice current American leadership working.
This also seen places as:

America: Help I’m stuck well

rest world: climb ladder

America: No, dig more!

rest world: get ladder 

America: I’m right, digging get 

Etc etc told acute post-Covid syndrome last week. got sick Covid first week March. 

That’s literally could say. It’s recognized. like CFS/ME it’s beast. 

Just lived doesn’t mean I’m living. It’s really hitting healthy time last year I’m shell used be. I’m inflammation medication... I’ve multiple rounds steroids get injections shoulder pain/swelling. topical thing inflammation/pain used 4x daily shoulders. 

....and I’m guilt tripped scared attending thanksgiving things. don’t know do. know love thanksgiving, family obviously food I’m conflicted. They’ll offended decline even wear mask show don’t understand I’m still experiencing much. Hell, wish knew. guarantee government/insurers announced (hypothetically: legally) stopped COVID claims, hospitals (at least ones taken corporate entities) would kick every single one hospital lobby shed tear. He's Texas' Bunker Boy Australia entered chat. public servants, USA conartists. ...and human beings brought back refusing vaccinate. I'm surprised I've gotten far thread without anyone mentioning anti-vaxxers real possibility large portion population simply refuse get vaccine, providing fertile ground mutations could render vaccine useless long term. wonder blood type linked long haul cases, I've seen lot people think type blood reporting issue.  It'll reduce cold flu season least. need help get. actual F wrong people..   Doctors often taken advantage administrators (and case government) know takes pick slack care patient. 

Hospital cuts staffing save money keeps number patients? Guess see patients/work longer hours salary. 

Its doctors lost control health system run business people. exploit professional ethics care patient knowing cost saving measures dumped onto doctor. chief concern spray bottles. Back housekeeping days operating rooms, spray bottles allowed due way aersolize particles. can't seem find warnings covid, seems like could issue. Yeah last bit issue. people willing anything US, also large % population ate actively opposed ANYTHING help rest us fight it. makes think even vaccine comes out, large enough percentage population refuses get also still distance wear mask.  curious...what ‘small’ number think survival rate is? Wait, Covid-20 then? new normal crew doom now? study also test efficiency masks source control, people know actual reason behind wearing mask - limit spread sick people. That's get skimming. Hope get better quickly. wrong picking choosing laws enforced?

Sort of?

That's one issues US justice system, arbitrary favor rich/powerful/buddies cops/majority group. Cops let someone hook they've got powerful friends, cops enforce something normally enforce someone they're poor, minority, immigrant, etc.

In ideal world, police discretion lets apply common sense cause people grief minor accidental things. real world, leads shit like OP article, systematic racism. hope recover soon people see post see long running virus. week quarantine way short.  Cool. call nursing home yesterday(I service type work).  Went amazed lack mask wearing/protocols everyone. know someone extremely minor case it, lost taste like hour, that's it, coming weeks started developing weird symptoms ongoing like month 2 now. thanksgiving important family holiday Christmas US, generally? best protecting stopping transmission. Keep mind lot HCW outbreaks originating break rooms one infects others everyone unmasked eat drink. reason people qualified wear elastomeric respirators allowed wear substitution COVID prevention, working conditions respiratory hazards originally trained wear first place. right, TX cases, ND cases *per capita.* TX 1,125,758 cases/29 million population = 3.88%. ND 67,236 cases/762,062 population = 8.82%.

North Dakota also recorded largest mortality rate COVID world November lose shit now?  “No cases mink variant cluster 5 detected since Sept. 15, State Serum Institute assesses variant likely become extinct,” ministry said statement.

Two weeks ago, Denmark ordered farmed mink country culled curb widespread outbreaks COVID-19 farms, situation exacerbated discovery mutated variant, authorities said showed reduced sensitivity antibodies. There’s negative effects sanitizing surfaces however concern safety practices put place seem solely focus sanitizing.
    
I don’t know live, experts like Dr Anthony Fauci continually stress wearing masks, social distancing hand washing every single time interviewed speaks public.  
 Every time. There's element truth that. measles, polio, covid, etc. test potential future implications getting health insurance, disability insurance, life insurance, etc.  time get end, increase probably stop reading 2021. is. outside risk minimal. Think like kid peeing pool. Unless within close proximity, really going get you. understanding surgical masks specifically droplet, outgoing incoming. I'd definitely want wearing one someone nicked artery surgery lol. far airborne pathogen...yeah, there's reason medical staff wearing N95s surgical masks. really. tested efficiency masks protecting wearer. test efficiency masks source control. people know masks efficient source control, personal protection measure. paper peer reviewed ""serious medical journal"" basically journal institute itself, impact factor Daily Mail's.

The claims study outrageously bold would shatter absolutely everything know virus epidemiology general. expanded matter little bit comment: better mean board members chewing data individually meet. nobody cracks page 1 Dec 8, that’s criminal. literally evidence say catch fomites. Well first misread comment. said Trump *helped* hypernormalization, cause it.

But believe past absolutely would received pressure resign parties would previously said, “We aren’t supporting past point unless resign.” political parties don’t care anymore except egregious scandals.

Actual crime doesn’t even matter anymore. Insider trading, cares? You’ll still get elected political environment hyperpartisan. I'm virologist anything, covid particles light easily aerosolized, particle, instance, waiting room chair risk becoming aerosolized breeze opening door hits it?

It also always worries often see people using spray bottles clean. Back housekeeping days operating rooms, spray bottles strictly forbidden due aerosolizing particles like c-diff.  Unfortunately not, every there's small blurb nationally someone gets one fast food sandwich  incivility ????? Canadians obsessively patriotic like Americans take much offence shitting Canada. Anyone kids knows, primary cause household infections. fact magic fairy dust data work overs could never touched. Cite? actually filipino. came 80s. filled forms school growing choose identifying asian pacific islander. came islands pacific ocean, thought supposed select that. told thats hawaiians, tongans, fijians... supposed select asian. referred asian. see types forms now, see different selection southeast asian even filipino.

Growing filling forms, always default asian. always odd spanish colonization, culturally closer spanish speaking countries like mexico, country asia. Prepare right pretty awesome. like crispy tofu. things mention probably larger effect spread recommending masks. Recommending masks exactly negative effects though, despite possibly huge impact still healthcare workers don’t believe it’s airborne?🤷🏼‍♀️ thought would 2 weeks, understand depression.

However, April able deduct would go long time, provided able read least one news-article. won’t even listen Fox News anymore. Yeah avoid big name brands smaller brands get big enough bought big name cycle outrage continues one mask Denmark, share it.   never saw Trump broad, real smile face announcing NY going get vaccine. truly ecstatic able block vaccine millions people. January 20th can't come fast enough me. affects personally. people still jobs wealth still advocating boot straps. I’m sorry friend feeling mutual cursed year planet! Beam Scottie! Over-stimulated over-protected generations. 
They cannot hack long-lasting problems, know nothing good times.

&amp;#x200B;

That simple truth this. Yeah, that's people, people making studies. 

Scientists etc. get hate making conclusion masks effective originally thought be.

This article even mentions ones made study says used push masks unnecessary. Despite this, post, ones like it, get tons hate downvoted hell.

Any reasonable human (which us are) safer learn limitations mask instead praising like ultimate corona weapon Hahaha, see that's better, like provided academic sourced made dad insist CIA propoganda. more, keep dancing realize US never point things control? blaming company cold weather? understand inadequate air filtration (which question commercial regulations was), that's still unique animal agriculture. know casting animal agriculture negative light passionate unique animal agriculture. see posting [Yakima Valley agriculture companies fined COVID-19 worker safety-related outbreaks [migrants harvesting fall [outbreaks migrants tending orchards due extreme lack foresight bunk various outbreaks [pasta nearly every type agricultural company throughout Americas. examples go see type talking that. 
 
Why that?  There’s negative effects sanitizing surfaces however concern safety practices put place seem solely focus sanitizing. 

The idea things “safe” stores sanitize surfaces employees scanned via thermometer foolish. gives ideas total safety without delivering fails evolve knowledge covid does. Exactly. This, death, worry getting it. “North Dakota highest infection rate world.“

Local governments follows central government.
The central government follows science.

All done win pandemic, one strongest virus human history. country none above, failed. Hope refuse vaccine. Gosh. local high school positive case sitting exams. students assembly hall go quarantine. Thankfully distancing student tested positive entitled views, may entirely agree (myself included), great opportunity venue express yourself. Cases Hospitalizations ICU Deaths.

When hospitalizations surging, waiting two happen. point late already. approach Australia also come levels leadership well. small business owners, teachers, Principals, Councils States - everyone developed similar procedures attacked virus together. perfect far anyone's mind think, getting really close normal (well... new normal anyway) Maybe talking mink masks? 🤷🏼‍♂️ think?

Get ready economic depression 2021 - 2030. Nightclubs adults, that's 18 over. know people ever tried going clubbing 16 almost one early teens going try it, especially school night.

We've gone almost 2 billion almost 8 billion world population since 1918, growth recent 50 years.

Seriously. always gets dicey trying slice population generations try generalize behavior sentiments diverse group people.

At risk that, observe frustration people’s adult children late 40-70, behavioral, social, economic reasons.

A lot people willing overlook attitudes beliefs elderly; (late 80s-100s) believe parents access knowledge forewarning many social problems exist today, even many cases championed early life—but failed move past policies errors generation them.

Youth eager change, many expected more—now seeing many (who expect deference respect) deceived television news Facebook conspiracies, championing causes (and attitudes) children find morally intellectually objectionable.

My partner ones wearing face masks social distancing work day in, day 8 months, RARELY saw anyone else wear face masks all.

Even school carers kids school kindy social-distancing wearing face masks!

What remote country town Qld in? freedom? think that's pretty obvious result. Nobody claims 100% effective!

The question whether benefits outweigh negative health effects.

Now quarter million Americans dead, come. pretty clear-sighted.

The conclusions I've drawn own. race get everybody infected vaccine available? Moderna vaccine requires -20C/-4F - regular household freezers capable hitting country like Germany issues. typical fridge temps, shelf life 30 days that's terrible.  


The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine requires -70C/-94F obviously much difficult standard home fridges/freezers can't hit that. still feasible Germany rich/modern/well-organized countries. Ebola vaccine tested last outbreak requirements, Ebola awful global pandemic probably helped logistical front.  


I honestly know Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine ignoring vaccines skipped Phase III trials. Thanks. mainly worry hospital overcrowding breaking bone getting care hospitals full. That’s great metaphor Yes would definition herd immunity threshold.

This study would make people safer travelling work public transport instance. 

The use synthetic control method analyze effect face masks spread 
Covid-19 Germany. identification approach exploits regional variation point 
in time face masks became compulsory. Depending region analyse, 
find face masks reduced cumulative number registered Covid-19 cases 
**2.3% 13% period 10 days became compulsory**. Assessing 
credibility various estimates, conclude face masks reduce daily growth 
rate reported infections around 40% think meant confirmed cases. Texas 1 million confirmed population 30 million. 1 30 confirmed 

The actual number probably 6 million cases it’s closer 1 5

That’s creepy 20% state exposed really aren’t. It’s feel good article. 

Additional contracted ICU space doesn’t much beds also full. believe choice token, smartphone app exact thing, QR code check-ins public location.

Obviously QR code check location known, tokens location isn’t tracked, serial numbers tokens get close to.

So get infected, token opened data used inform people quarantine. government idea places visited, long. data also automatically wiped hardware 14 days. Sometimes caring means saying No. Sometimes means time strike. healthcare industry workplace, different anywhere else, people work deserve safe environment. Full stop. worst yet come.

The global cost pandemic needs covered somehow.

We ""joy-ride"" coming 10 years, hope spark wars revolutions. What's take links, especially among risk spreaders like healthcare workers care home patients, cases deaths start go down. Even limited protection better protection though. problem studies like reinforce beliefs idiots think wearing masks absolutely fine. Driving 66 miles per hour? Betting football? sex living?

Too many armed men running around it’s 1850,s Deep South. Legalize weed gambling, turn traffic enforcement cameras computers, let’s figure many armed men really need. saying since March. probably unpopular opinion think benefit victorian keep wearing mask especially public places... Plus recent Adelaide cluster suspected come surface contact issue, airborne time. routes transmission multiple factor prevention Read whole article. obviously don’t understand yet (and calling office today btw) Greg abbot sandbags positive moves every possible turn! wheelchair bound FFS! Governor’s mansion tours CLOSED! Go candy stripe Med Center GREG! post /r/nottheonion ? one month, 1.8% people wearing masks infected, 2.1% people control group tested positive, Copenhagen University Hospital said press release.  already found Italy last September

Yeah study tracing found earliest strain US

Could link relevant phylogenetic analyses prove that? [ones point Wuhan. People area refusing get tested anyone immediate family tests positive get sent home work 2 weeks pay 

I screaming company policy encourages sick people load meds come work response “well wear masks” 

Holy fuck it’s like people common sense don’t agree all. behavioral study Canada shows quite effective. Also study admits doesn’t look effectiveness prevent transmission infected people. I'm total introvert, people extrovert looks like way living feel never understand, BUT, said,

This year awful need every dose hope, socializing not, FREEDOM. miss it. ""new normalcy"" distopic world must last indispensable time end fucking disaster.

But want freedom going outside without fear. freedom traveling anywhere. Running, going street hour, etc.

I might end room playing video games, Freedom sacred. make human life worth living.

So even feel maybe much need socializing yours, I'm eager much end distopic new normalcy reality...

PD: finally want add, extrovert people sometimes bit ""agressive"" towards people introvert. need that. Everyone think internally wants live, understand infinite posible ways living, different may never understand. accept diversity foist ""correct"" ways living others.

TL;DR: Fucking Freedom Sacred, freedom introverts extroverts everyone, can't wait dystopian ""new normalcy"" end!
(And non English native sorry bad English) makes claims much believable right..... Australia size Western Europe, USA, bigger size China, don’t need passports anything move around. 90% population mingles east coast specific high density cities. “island” nation. control international state boarders control it.

No country bothering second step, let alone bloody first one. still let people travel 50km away homes thousands died countries. stay suburbs, eastern state, VIC even going 5km 10am I've read stupidest thing read day. Thank much.  stuff like parties friends relatives. know nobody coughing, drink hug wear masks. give 'Rona.

Famous last words.  necessarily think long term results COVID specifically look back 10 years later going factor Donald Trump much. multiple system failures. Trump consistently made worst decisions list choices much better. think much control gives way much credit.

The major thing Trump discrediting major scientific organizations, medical organizations, government offices long-term implications across many disciplines general pandemic response. sowing seed serious breakdowns systems, organizations, government future another emergency arises loss trust figures loss investment groups. showing country world things, ideas, systems, people's considered trustworthy making untrustworthy unreliable future generations. coordinated response required future, making cooperation collaboration much less likely occur easily successfully. countries used extensive contact tracing and/or islands. can’t say lockdowns wasn’t. Even lockdowns help certainly wasn’t factor. positive doesnt mean intubated. Damn, song ‘Last Christmas’ George Michael take whole new meaning folks. using verb it’s happening yes read plenty times! even many revelations med used cytokine release syndrome CAR-T patients massive battle engineered blood cells cancer cells they’re targeting. role timing administration interesting variable effectiveness.  study say that. Sigh. said people wearing got less sick - little bit.

They even study masks prevent sick people infect others - whuch biggest point them. curious opinion clearly different views covid handled do. Somewhere like Korea fewer lockdowns US, yet less 10 deaths per million people, US looking 3000 deaths per million people. Mainly due mask wearing strong contact tracing. economy affected extremely little every day life virtually unaffected. expand think everything fine US measures seem working parts hte world? receive vaccine, there’s chance infections covid vaccine-provided decrease severity still able pass others vaccinated. Masking distancing still necessary mitigate risk others. Canada anti China RevelationS it’s used verb  also Canada. Stupid understand borders. Ok make legislation demanding one medical procedure, what’s next? vaccines few? everyone suddenly need Rabies Yellow fever one?

Medical decisions forced. can’t even force someone take treatment HIV, make illegal disclose spread it. can’t force someone get treatment cancer make sure ones pay alternative treatments government dime

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Eh quick search, guess done first avoid downvotes *quivers fear*, April article smoking linked less severe symptoms one June July said new research showed smoking increased risk. right disproved. Bummer. Yea, I’m watching AZ numbers climbing 7 day rolling average 2,900/day rising fast. peak hit 3,700/day. “snow birds” heading whole country hot spot trained medical reinforcements available also needed everywhere else. Ding ding! Bring dead! unreasonable expect hospitals adhere certain level service, system gets overwhelmed simply isn’t enough providers patients, forget it.

So hospitals plan scenarios? Hospitals nothing try mitigate possibility service degradation based demand?  implied knowledge heath care burden, implying numbers gave suggest fine. That’s reality works. argument numbers “suggest...”

No one expecting hospitals able handle apocalyptic-like patient load unreasonable ask 0.3% increase 9 month period can't reasonably accommodated. you, admittedly, position answer dismiss question. easily dismiss based factual evidence like say hospital workers need ""work harder"" accommodate increased demand. ridiculous responses neither progress discussion. bet gets really worked kneeling national anthem.  know, symbolic gesture. Hmm, arguing someone WHO's estimate 10% world infected probably wrong ballistic it. ""iceberg"" theory countless hidden asymptomatic infections seem fit science. Yes, I’m asking *why* still need it.

If so, clear.

“We need keep PH measures like masks distancing place estimated immunity 70% met via vaccines”.

This vague, “we can’t stop PH measures vaccine”. Ok. we? point exact metric/condition hit walk back PH measures? like something Rogan said recently (love hate him). something along lines “Remember back high school; many idiots class? Well they’re still idiots. grew up, they’re still here.” Except can't even get 95% folks agree water wet. long people allowed protest riot masses bother me.

You started saying ""hospitals known better"" asked WTFAYTA? said ""Build temporary hospitals? entire summer this. 
China built temporary 1,000 bed hospital 10 days.""

Which means nothing considering mobile hospitals finite number ventilators like creating chairs need bed increase personnel. also hospitals supposed anticipate 40% population believing COVID? passed person person can't stop people wearing masks, there's federal response, 50 states 50 different things directly contradict neighboring states, hospitals supposed anticipate this? I'm getting track

Then asked ""with funds"" double downed less rudimentary knowledge said could take overprice cost getting stitches leaving already agreed upon price hospitals insurance providers ""taking of"" anything that's cost.

Then someone responded condescendingly double downed said ""Demanding reasonable prices healthcare isn’t thick, it’s common sense."" begs question responses:

\- Blame hospitals! knew coming. There’s single person thought going away come winter. hospitals aren’t prepared that’s them.

\-Build temporary hospitals? entire summer this. 
China built temporary 1,000 bed hospital 10 days.

\-Extra staff hired anticipation increase demand?

\-Take $1,000 pay get 2 stitches put daughter’s face...and insurance. Hospitals get paid well.

\-Demanding reasonable prices healthcare isn’t thick, it’s common sense.

Where else demand reasonable prices statements?

You didn't. argued hospitals known better, built temporary, hired extra staff without considering funding would coming from, made false equivalence based paid stitches, made point demand reasonable prices. 

We page yet? we’re back depressing can’t go anywhere, drink much part quarantine eh? it’s “rounding corner getting vaccine.”

Trump 1984. sure that’s official rule, it’s enforced. 

Granted, 40s don’t know people hanging bars, people see ignoring safety precautions Christian families believe big deal. church (that decided leave) holding dinner parties, youth nights, services without masks. Parents want kids school, sports, get togethers, go eat groups, go vacation. seen one Facebook status “don’t tell visit family Thanksgiving!” Today even acquaintance say hoax media scaring us. 

So that’s staying home! stubborn af think vaccination process go smoothly projected, terms reach, thoroughness, true numbers vaccinated X period time, willingness general public receive it.

Actually agreed. think no-masks public, person work / class, etc. resume fashion remotely resembling normalcy fall 2021 

I've saying smell normal 'til summer '22, better news most. son's University sending kids home semester now, soon get negative COVID test (administered twice weekly), they'll take finals remotely homes couple weeks. there's big break February. They'll welcomed back Feb negative tests traveling two weeks quarantining campus. That's way it. abomination universities resources many tests. Disney getting crowded think mostly pent domestic demand. Can't stay home, I'm critical care nurse. unemployment me, lots exposure virus could easily controlled proper measures shown countries filled fucking morons. lol Lol yeah ""non-profit"" system worked wonderfully. 250000 new cases every day. That’s TOTAL cases countries. No, give explanation - husband (Group 1), lived Ireland March September. last week September, moved back US, moved family (brother, sister-in-law, mother, kids) (Group 2).

In March, Group 1, tested positive symptoms. Group 2 nothing, fine. 

In November, members Group 2 tested positive; mild asymptomatic only. Group 1, tested negative, medium symptoms March, causing medical care. seem really smart - especially can't understand people wanting first line vaccine hesitant.

You realize vaccine - wearing mask next 2-3 years, right?

I assume already knew since knowledgeable point mind blown. read buying 5 pound bag chicken nuggets? Geographically nonce. 

And geographically still contend major inter city travel, hence major city lock downs such, notice many countries even bothered They're going coup. Tantrum putting bit mildly.  ""So year ""FriendsGiving"" we're giving friends COVID-19!!!"" China already vaccine. They're sharing lol ask politely champ Ok. goal what.

Keep PH measures place covid-19 eliminated? 

Keep PH measures place 80% public vaccinated? 90%? 70%? 

Until deaths hospitalizations mimic average flu year? 1 10 year flu?

I guess point making is, saying “we’re going need keep PH measures *a while* isn’t plan. need targeted metrics hit. goal get point PH measures removed. important transparent targets well advance. 

In opinion, point people vaccinated walk back measures. keeping place transmission community low *might* infect someone else silly. transmission low enough hospital beds available *if* happen still catch covid *if* covid happens bad enough hospital visit needed, good enough remove PH mandates Stonks hard. bunch doodled dickbutts. date meme, annoying one first place. probably it. think mask compliance high 95% live, decent. Anecdotally probably around 90% public indoor spaces maybe 60% outdoors, know fact neighbors mixing households without masks physical distancing constantly. think lot people ""pods"" consider safe, ultimately takes one breach overcome. Yup, maybe thousands anecdotal reinfections across world. real common phenomenon. Maybe occurs smaller percentage people, know. ""super super rare"".  sight, mind, right? please stop “muh mental health” “muh freedom” “muh economy” crap? sounds condescending cringy. Like it’s silly concerned mental health. 7 day testing trends gone two three states really feel this. *know* coming fucks mental health, also *know* coming digging info beginning US outbreak kept ahead curve my/my family’s personal response. 

So...yeah. think right it’s pretty unlikely new thing would come would really good know...but also don’t want take break find that, idk, Rona reinfection turning people zombies gov hushing up. (Would call Ronies Rombies...?) mean Yeah stay quit. stopped 8 years ago. Way cheaper keep smoking haha Might make late night walks (solo mind you) tad expensive, county enforced it. Even sheriff cared enforce it, doubt officers going patrolling rural roads. Same! That's terrible wonder nursing homes getting hard again. think every person thinks everyone else that's problem since one person family. mean, look politicians preaching one thing public, another private. Every single person VIP. Exactly thinking. base buys conspiracy theories far anyone else. They’re getting hurt way sane democrat. money. Churches need weekly attendees like online game companies need players log daily. case anyone wondering reasons South Dakota mess, he’s big part it. well then, good! mind blown twice today now! Afterwards ig free ignore precautions since immune.

Please make stuff up. probably matter weeks anti-vaxxers walking around lying already gotten vaccine therefore obligated wear mask. Ok, clarify, family ever tested positive once, March? November, 3 tests negative?

Thanks reply. used people around world can’t think user country headquarters are. work hospital never got hazard pay... Oh wait get $500 bonus taxed $290. CEO said thanks efforts COVID......


We're viewed expendable someone worked epidemiology lab background machine learning, epidemiological theory needs lot work. want herd immunity, expect \~4 million US deaths due covid. Obviously, we'll never hit number vaccine, that's need without one. said Pfizer applying EUA tomorrow Interesting....... say drink wine Pet ferrets big deal creating animal reservoir passed around millions animals. Water wet  Second highest deaths today. Whoop. least we’re almost winning something? /s Lmao cause don’t work. Ones tenure fine make harder get screw Adjuncts harder. Burden proof person makes claim. surprised people would ask evidence.  also wonder many dems would said wear masks

Zero. Literally zero. Republicans ""team"". That's always win. shit. Imagine nothing expecting different results. Sadly NY distribute til testing confirmations experts. Personally want mine ASAP. That’s pretty cool idea honestly. love relatives, don’t fucking visit year. telephone shit that. Hospitals always low COVID beds, really easy add new ones. designate non-covid room covid. well sars 2, may actually able technically catch heart disease


soooooooooooo wear mask social distance trial? also live Washington became stuck Idaho night back October due blizzard. town 800 people effective 0% citizens wearing masks. also means following health guidelines like getting together friends family etc wear mask home? not?

I personally don't, see purpose wear one house. anyplace United States get approved vaccine right now? much cost insurance?

(non-health care worker)

&amp;#x200B;

if not: roll-out look like, i'm mobile intent getting vaccine asap, improve chances getting one quickly? surges big small number people complying. Sorry seemed like calling that. meant one. totally agree you. I’d never forgive gave someone. Sounds like need Han Solo Kessel Run shit. Anything less 12 parsecs COVID VACCINE, coaxium short, going get real ripe. mean, maybe driver inject get boost final push. Watch many tentacled anti-vax crowd, maybe jettison spare tire watch follow road. 

In seriousness though, great news. also love Star Wars.  ""Right jail!"" ""Nowcasting"" terrible word. Looks like one CFA’s suppliers. also supply McDonalds and, per clip, Popeyes. Good you! Take care taken care many others. Lol may well southern thing. Idk part south live culture misogynistic could see men thinking ok say there. I’m pretty happy person general too. least rarely angry. I’ve men women say me, although I’ve ever women already friends dating say it. gets annoying, especially friends known awhile it. 

Like no, nothing wrong. face I’ve made concentrating entire time you’ve known me. “Then sound upset?” won’t stfu let finish reading! Even parents it, must look pissed I’m concentrating guess. No. level would consider concerning? I'm hanging on. I'm actually getting second wind, staying home even more. slowly increasing social bubble among extended family. wait. friend running testing site Fargo— days 75% tests administered come back positive. It’s mind boggling. police sheriffs departments refusing enforce new mask mandate FrEeDuMb! True, could virtual audience instead prevent spread virus. idea mean that, think drug companies exposed bribe,lie, cover deceive bridge sell you. look Wikipedia page pfizer quick example.

I utterly aghast lack caution displayed sub. drug company makes extraordinary claim published *anything* hear applause, cheers, shouting cautious voices.

Utter recipe disaster. Sounds right Tyson. chicken tastes disgusting treat workers worse dogs. honestly think people would wear masks homes? Why? took decades.

We’ll get won’t take long past, won’t magically gone February !Remindme 1 month never threat really care, you?   /s pandemic like slow-moving train, we're stalled railroad tracks. Sadly they're also lot tired daily grind caring covid patients. Many people receive optimal care. sure...after ignoring intelligence reports virus far back late november last year, anything restricted flights end january. repeatedly lied us severity virus, telling us handful cases, numbers already declining, would gone april, ""didn't want alarm us"". funny thing...he worried alarming us make-believe brown-skinned invasion southern border midterms. hawked unproven cure skin game, suggested injecting disinfectant introducing (cancer-causing) uv light inside body, waited late july finally endorse mask use. despite this, still never required mask use superspreader rallies. then, finally, 9 months worst pandemic 100 years, inquires late august fast-tracking vaccines. saint. no, sorry, magically away red tape make happen. urged fda fast-track it, basically means less safety testing order rush market. drawback getting see long-term effects test subjects, we'll get discover hard way. lucky us.  mRNA “vaccine” studied developed 10 years. It’s blueprint body build defense virus. years ago. future medicine likely cure cancer.  already know. Goddamn frustrating.  governor got ending needing hospitalized....can imagine treatment would get healthcare workers? let die, course, definitely going get great bedside manners. Average I’ve heard us symptoms develop 3-5 days, 14 day range considered safe Biden probably something smart pandemic. He's ignorant. Lol sometimes entire subreddit wants negative Nancy comes kinds news. Singapore

""The eight comprise four Singapore citizens, two permanent residents two long-term pass holders.

The travellers arrived Singapore South Korea Thailand Nov 5 Nov 12, the Immigration Checkpoints Authority (ICA) Singapore Police Force (SPF) said Thursday (Nov 19)."" Kudos Texas leadership Yeah, still quarantining time. test done 6 days mostly worthless. Honestly, I'd skeptical using partial quarantine test system flight. Going two airports plane, sure super crowded time year, lot potential exposure family jobs. Thus, I'd lot less confident negative test result even waited week. We're super lucky reasonably safe jobs enough time way are, I'm still little nervous may article helped guide thinking it. we're supposed trust drug company now? Nearly every zombie movie starts way. miracle drug assured safe. ever people? favor stay inside next 50 years dont meet hits hard. 2020 fucking years. makes bad/good turned 21 2020.~~ Thank god &amp; family safe. transmission happens behind close doors people homes public. make look like wearing reality absolutely like get store. read submitted paperwork review board met discuss Dec 8. slow play this? important things going next three weeks? make look like he’s trying...

I love this! Preferably something almost completely ineffective, while, time, something point say something. free 1 oz. bottles hand sanitizer mailed Texans? can’t wait fuck say “my body, choice!” Govern stay governing. good experiences, life wrong anyway. Nothing stopping great outdoors Hypocrisy undermines message causes reflexive counter-reaction. better silent obvious hypocrite. Worse, like ""rules thee, me"" situation. Finally, masks social distancing next year, hopefully. sanitizing stuff though. Statistics=/=how human biology works. know people like snarky reddit, jesus dude lol. day. **WHO says 10% global population may infected Jail time!!!! needs PSA's. I've seen few, pack emotional punch, graphic enough. need show everything. mean, people wear masks go Giant food stores, yes, wear masks job. Plus, need wear mask home. wear mask inside home. Whenever leave public bathroom always use paper towels (if available) dispenser grab door handle tossing it. Good know. figured better safe sorry that’s 250k AmErICaNs R DeD! Mr BiDeN SaVe Us ScArY ViRuS PLleeassseee realize Cuomo that's holding vaccines wants independent testing first people. cant stand current president issue NY vaccines Cuomo thing. confirm. ever was. Happened lot election example. Republicans thinking Latinos loved Cubans voted favorably. already next stupid problem. ""The vaccine changes yer DNAAAAAA!!!!!"". don’t think many bed. good topping well that. People dying home parking lot, number hospitalized plateau point Realistically one recommend people stay farther apart. would work people stay 30 feet apart tried talk, shop walk sidewalk. picked number better nothing. it. people west absurdly selfish self centered. whole idea something protect others utterly foreign. can't cancel holiday Michael They've given legal indemnity.

I’d give wholesome award smile gave wasteful enough waste money glorified emoji That's true U.S. general.

The official counts confirmed cases. We've known since beginning number actual cases much larger number confirmed cases. problem people. isn’t politicians businesses. people, nothing stop mass gatherings society. People decided live risk COVID-19.  Except million die fight rate long term effects/symptoms anything like recent estimates, we’re going lot people living consequences COVID long time... one rich people ultra rich fat butt thinking potato chips. Yeah they've never number one anything. go ND. live? part country, take pictures, 99% people wear masks! must region thing then!! welding people homes Wuhan forced abortions decades, think coerce people getting vaccines. help live state abott acting like joke Disney top employer Florida. bribe anyone. know who's real boss ain't DeSantis. Less 1 person per county? That's low? I'm extroverted hate Zoom Pandemics last forever peeps. 

(Cries HIV/AIDS) won’t either come cold I’ll wear one. America worships money. Lives unimportant. pandemic shown light reality US rest world. Half one percent population North Dakota number US service member fatalities entire occupation Iraq. Three quarters one percent percent US population died ***anything*** 2019. 2% death rate freely transmitting virus would make COVID responsible 2/3's deaths 2021. state Lege can't deal it...

neither feds, least Biden takes office...

so would turn -- county municipal?

or everybody shrug say ""it's God's hands now"" ? Thanksgiving Christmas New Year’s offer spikes Im already planning going Black Market fake vaccination documentation. Thanks though. Yeah truck drivers stuff register allowed free movement. You’re making like it’s hard track things it’s not. 

I mean assumptions arguments it’s hard... it’s hard don’t properly put money it. Covid knocked really tall buildings, though. first thought was, “I can’t wait go bar play games eat friends again.”

Maybe movies 90s everyone’s packed together like sardines restaurants together good time won’t seem foreign again.

I think I’ll still level fear getting sick time this, can’t wait feel joy radiating people around - strangers friends alike - again. never realized much took granted even told to. client, reddit fun, name green next it. I'm sure looks like new UI update website.   300,000 reading scared bit too.

What scared you? percent consider abnormal? Wearing mask? basic futile guidelines aren’t scientifically proven still inconvenient? Like wearing mask skating rink, gym, mall, hotel, movie theater, nightclub, bar, indoor dining, close contact people multitude different households. seriously struggling trying deal people. Since deem right, trying inform people creates drama try deem controlling know narcissist. arent supporters. Thats hardest part Can't wait 🤞 everyone think international travel little bit back normal? 

My plan take money travel world, obviously want it’s safe, I’m 100% willing get vaccine order so. Top story Newsoms dinner party. sorta covid related. went go work last week (oil field) I’m Texas. nobody masked state I've always felt something Christianity thanks pandemic I've finally figured is. Christianity incredibly selfish religion, extention lot (but course) Christians incredibly selfish people. honest can't even blame them. raised whole life thinking one God loves, earth everything created YOU, wrong every sin ever commit already forgiven, well makes sense think they're ones matter. got COVID honestly clue got it. Passed onto wife likely son. go office spread out. stay home outside going store get food. think everywhere point sucks. Hell yeah. I’d like think money spent buying “the best little whorehouse Texas” went cure! right give never work doctors take responsibility bodies. sensationalist best ignorant worst. 

Health always one meal away, make decision stop spreading fatalism. also Listen, passed tax cuts rich kept stock prices high. What, want actually help stop pandemic? Sit outside ER door watch ambulances. I'm sure would get idea Let translate that: we're fucked unless make immediate drastic changes. NFL still full swing. probably months distribute yeah concern overall overblown sub. closed borders vaccine important :/ Dafauq smoking? want some! know they'll receive best health care thus risk multiple lower common dude. No. fact actually rather hard get RNA stuff directly multiple cells, even lab conditions. Decoding manufacturing mRNA likely easy part development. odd percent hospital answered no.

WHY President. president failed country. Trump made decision federal government going get involved. Yea, also think would also get way better care land hospital, VIP treatment ( Trump, Cristi), probably going debt hospital visit. many days ago election? nation packed brim idiots got elected. high bar. One ranting fought WW2 fight socialism got MD Trump University  vaccine done good distributed get vaccine-why hearing people say would still need social distance wear mask? point vaccine still things? Damn figure this? I've never heard before. interesting indeed!

Also side point, anyone know “S” oddly replaced different letter, looks like “f” without horizontal dash? literature article painfully obvious. Bro % global population knows that? Lol cardiologists already know world sick. became popular Asia around early 2000's SARS also originated China. widespread panic Asian countries one really gave shit New Zealand (i know countries). Everyone saw asian thing wear surgical masks Covid19, million times worse SARS worldwide, naturally masks became thing everywhere. “Comply total lockdown recovery rate 99.9%” well it? know places trouble keeping demand testing, running early on.  point many states hard tell rise slowing, reached testing capacity. 2050

Asia: meh changed behaviour little, almost nobody died economy recovered fast

Western countries: apocalypse!!! slander propaganda. You’re ideology cannot hold water resort personal racist attacks Yup 100% nuts reached critical mass yet. Give time. Sounds right. don’t know we’ll ever get point herd immunity. Half US going refuse take it. German soldiers indeed paid Germany. German soldiers keeping Moscow away - good ol' US A. 35,000 US troops German bases, overwhelming air naval superiority provide, nuclear power provide. Yes, wanting put millions work take away cheap easy source food people crisis hilarious. Hey, careful phrase sub comment gets boot. 

No matter true is.  doesn’t end medically summer, end socially. people know giving they’ll go back normal regardless availability vaccine. turned emergency alerts phone New Mexico... Yeah, lack standardized testing collection little mind boggling. work lab processing tests receive tests state don’t know states Texas don’t smaller counties. Njjk Married 3 kids thanks. 
I’m crying china’s rise. It’s china’s oppression dissenting voices. Engaging cultural genocide cases states seen massive surging appear dropped back.

nationally still trending up, maybe slowing accelerating.  body cells recycle proteins, take parts display surface sort ID card called MHC. Immune cells dock onto protein parts, basically recognizing foreign protein known one. dock onto something unknown, targeted immune response activated.
The immune system know proteins came from, knows belong. scary stupid people  difference national government sees problem solved, rather marketing challenge surmount ridiculous. Stop eating meat exercise eat whole foods. data awaits you. chance heart disease becomes nearly impossible. 

Google friend. Stop spreading outright lies I've decided use South Dakota ""Waffle House Index"" COVID. day put state mask mandate place day know we've lost completely. don’t know Africa, Rwanda maintained low numbers testing. everything right. locked early (before US travel bans). 

They implement testing contact tracing contacted every person quarantine. 

They social distance wear masks. installed temporary hand washing stations people always nearby. 

It probably also helps clean already. 

I’ve really impressed managed. North Carolina. can’t help feel like every living American going end it. doesn’t change fact I’m everything mitigate it, wearing mask staying home much possible. Still, resigned fact seems inevitable. realize restrictions referencing post July would like temperature checks retirement homes, right? I’m anti vaxxer means find utterly astounding &amp; mindblowing top comments favor vaccine, either heavy censorship going people research. sure Vaccine safe long term, argue one hand extra money efforts gone compared others fair play, cannot manipulate time. mean actual long term evidence affects human 5, 10, 20 years that’s data simply make up, hence others vaccine trials monitored years expedited. Also trials carried efficacy studies, measuring actual effectiveness people need wake realize this.

This profit controlling population, don’t believe look Dr Mike Yeadon's work UK government particular manipulated figures fit narrative. Im going start believing elaborate theories like microchipping headed Bill Gates etc , man Vice President Chief Scientific Officer A&amp;R Research Unit Pfizer &amp; important insights add.

Personally way see it, refuse Vaccine lose travel, work, leisure &amp; living rights essentially forcing people corner. Stick arm means don’t say warn deception hits fan. scary time living im talking virus. Duh fucking shit thought policy senior homes accept *if ability care COVID cases*. fair, they’re probably saying “The whole bloody countryside trying kill us. cunt Corona gonna wait” I'm fine Debbie Downer keeps people declaring victory letting loose. ain't over. may due corona? lot empowered conspiracy theorists US, confused notion ""free speech"" lets constantly air conspiracies media minimal pushback. Good getting checked out. let DVT go long wound pulmonary embolism. Stay safe! American people bad federal government, even govt try instate nationwide lockdown people would went along it. american ppl ignorant af, value “personal freedom” lives safety ppl. Ppl can’t even bothered wear fucking mask Instead adult got dolt. Finally, good fucking news \*CRIES US\* International borders currently open. wanted go Europe could really wanted to. Temporary measures save untold lives. 

If think thats authoritarian, youre selfish. 1 billion get vaxed others get 'the real thing' Last time checked Bundeswehr 100% funded German „Steuerzahler“!

By way right know Europe thinking developing „European-Defense-Force“/cooperating European level. NATO fact US-centric like said don’t like more! make ,but make company. Hell, liability ,not asset Illinois actually better last days. 15,000 cases recently less 10,000, bad sounds , good news someone helm incapable managing crisis. nearly anyone else president, US would much better shape. think they've succeeded wanted cull Welp think 400k estimate New Years may back cards.

The IMHE model always lowballed things crazy amount. We're even seeing deaths associated spike near 200k.

I believe probably break 200k positives / day USA Friday / Sat. Anyone know likelihood efficacy exaggerated trial manipulated fashion? Drug companies exactly know honesty. I'd like think anything shady vaccine important find wondering. Yep, unless prolong it, wouldl make things worse even companies business already bankrupt reality affected. 

I know lot people think work way, can't keep zombie companies alive forever cost future generations, make sense. Pfizer, Keeping alive keep up! Absolute shame. expect better Newsom. Better behavior first place, better apology breaks rules. end, it’s you. say though, nobody wants get sick pay price treatments/long term effects whatnot. going safer route never wrong. Also, feel like young people concern catching covid entirely themselves, risk put people around them. Lancaster bad (: york pa (: look number deaths US, 250k that's 10% deaths expected every person US caught it. one would expect 10% population far. Pump Dump stock scheme. conned! blind incapable reading graph? lot people secretly love status quo. work remotely shut-in lifestyles considered normal. Ending pandemic means they'd leave house interact people large social circle.  Weird, family Lancaster reports extremely poor mask compliance. many months ago got soyabella soymilk maker I’ve making soymilk. need one ingredient make tofu. one got came tofu mold.

I don’t go grocery shopping often used it’s easier soybeans &amp; make milk myself.

The issue end lot Okara / soymilk pulp leftover haven’t found recipe loved using yet. seen silly pandemic over. punishment eat food.   US currently #11 among major countries deaths/capita: Horrible leaders Belgium too, huh? isn’t one. That’s joke.  It’s mostly poor working class people small town farming communities. Clots bears  Exactly, warmer days started last week, there's little developments since then. lockdown clearly driving force less cases, 'spring' bullshit. Well, fuck... y'all Yeah, I'm looking looking raw positive test count. I'm going think infection rate actually falling see daily positives positive test rate falling together. problem analogy people Titanic could nothing stop ship sinking. slow spread virus, people tired, stressed, badly need source hope. That’s goal feel good articles, keep people motivated fall trap thinking everyone going get virus bother trying stop it. deaths south korea 2002 dude. 4 countries, 2 authoritarian regimes one small island. Bravo Guess who’ll taking credit that. time won’t technically wrong. type talk signals complete societal breakdown far away.

People right angry, thinking goes anger decides bad things get. ideas coming angry people days ages, show extreme anger hate demands peoples heads, good. Asking real questions. Well, this, plus smaller carry lower viral load. hand, totally unhygienic. Regardless, transmission going 0. That... might bad idea too, since body chance develop immune response common diseases, eventually risk coming horrible flu decade. P l c l comment going get flagged, truth. 

Because r g h - w n g ideology compatible response that's needed combat pandemic. entire worldview predicated limited g v e r n e n t, worldview drilled much become fixed idea. next pandemic see response, something people need understand real big scary virus comes. kind high mortality rate, children children's children mercy people acted like them, day comes, dealing virus survivor rate 99%. They'll dealing something far worse. 

But part trips call p r s. p r someone willing defend land, question. c u n r needs can't even something simple like wear mask. Maybe victims camouflage uniforms they'd respond differently. 

There lot layers this, course. One economics. Again, r g h - w n g ideology backfiring. normal circumstances, nothing challenges it, well, time like this, shows weak position face something calls n n l action. Yeah, average survival rate may 99% memaw’s less 50%. limited availability... ""Jim Jones"" state mind think notable thing ever come North Dakota. Unfortunately rate beds, healthcare workers, resources needed can’t accelerate fast like that. heard one Biden’s new coronavirus advisory members days ago CNBC say case fatality rate 2-3%, idea infection fatality rate is. It’s annoying 99.8% 99.9% survival thrown around fact literally idea don’t know every infection, able take account different extenuating factors modulate number. It’s probably fair say survival rate children, neglects address long term effects everyone isn’t child. 99.8/9% literally survival rate flu, fuck don’t quarter million Americans die 9 months flu every year! It’s rewording original “it’s flu” talking point even deniers realize absurd say outright point. Australia, know single person who's - 0.02% people state tested positive it. locked properly early on, we're mostly back normal except travel restrictions.
 
In March fully expecting we'd get matter quickly seriously. actually seems possible vaccine could roll us exposed.  Yeah, democracy right make get piece plastic I'm allowed operate 2 ton hunk metal! like could kill someone. Herd immunity then. SAD. course he'd say that. He's another corrupt individual within politics anyone thinks he's interested American people lying themselves. Thanks reply. one? last step release public/production? Newsom needs step up. restrictions incredibly soft date. Emulate Oregon start locking things stop pussyfooting around. Leper messiah Absolute unit. thought SF tried pass mask mandate earlier year sued something? Masks factor equation -- partial measure largely used half ass manner anyways, really even much equation.

Right biggest driver cold weather dry airmasses. dual effect sending people indoors transmission effective making respiratory tract easier infect.

Within 2 incubation periods first cold front, ~10 days, 7 day moving average new infections nearly doubled.

Resumption in-person classes, phased across many districts.. knock-on effect people returning work.. also large factor. get paid this? so, disclose much? H1B visa, foreign workers must present site, otherwise DHS says well remote, remote India sounds shocking america huge white population estimated 20% non white population. love god hope inbred morons don’t breed. Good job almost killing grandparents! So, crisis, he's going take stand? He's pretty much worthless. love response cares? CDC lost credibility months ago Hah, jokes you, radiologist charge entire damn Coronavirus response US! difference exactly? hell open all? highly variable. CDC tested bunch brands got something like 70% 97% filtration. also seal well due fold flat design ear loops instead head straps.

That said, much better cloth mask, particularly get seal properly.  still nurse, would taken sabbatical long now. I'm wondering makes Australia's premiers different there. North Dakota Canadian province New Brunswick interesting comparison. Almost identical population although ND twice land mass NB.
 

North Dakota.  

Pop 761,724.   
Total Cases 67230.  
Active Cases 9987.    
Deaths 785.   


New Brunswick

Pop 772,094.   
Total Cases 388.  
Active Cases 40.     
Deaths 6.

New Brunswick done two things differently know. closed border essential traffic ( share border canada's worst hit province Quebec) majority wear masks public I'm still cleaning everything comes home. Viruses (and bacteria) including Corona virus live surfaces days we're trying get sick anything right get something needs hospital treatment, want anyone family go may take get treated anyway they're capacity. wiping things bad idea. large swath people gotten Covid careful following rules...they honestly know got it. get significant virus population, surface transfer becomes possible.  also get bacterial infections lot...so wiping stuff cleaner helps too.

I think wiping stuff bad idea all...and frankly, since particular virus novel...the messaging coming CDC organizations has, times, inconsistent watered due politics. opinion, better safe sorry. Especially since there's 6 months get start distributing vaccine general public. Also... contrary saying, Pfizer part operation Warped Speed. publicly funded effort. I’m sure would way beholden government vis vis distribution. thing work home ~8 months.

Oh man I've years. sure thats from.

TX 29MM citizens 1.1MM cases. (3.7%)

ND 760k citizens 67k cases.(8.8%)

ND worst per capita, TX median US. Oh got there.. clever one. similar situation. Yes, gone long time, hide another 6 months rather lose loved one.

Happy holidays, best wishes, stay safe. Check covidactnow.org

Unfortunately cloth masks everyone wearing really adequate. reduce risk some, enough make safe go grocery store. think metaphor illustrate covid deaths. think passenger planes crashed US year. tho? course typical mindless drone society like would say something like that. going back school Fall dumb.

Local schools constantly switching home hybrid full school.



Kids symptoms may Covid-19, go get tested quarrantine. Teachers symptoms, get tested quarrantine. Family members symptoms, better get tested quarrantine also.


Too many students teachers symptoms, put class hybrid. Woops, better whole school go home school weeks.


Now middle high schools hybrid mode next weeks. serious doubts go back full time week half Thanksgiving, two weeks going winter break.



But guess that's ""Normal"" people, parents change schedule every week must easy them. I'm sure companies work love it.


But least kids ""Normal"" year left behind.

/$  live Nashville hear screaming party buses blasting party like rock star 4 nights week doubting vaccines ability future strains. Note vaccines developed according current existing new strains occured start development see folks already claim works current strains likely work near future strains. Please spread unnecesary concerns vaccines dont need here. comment, yet is. mostly played 2004-2008. days. ive suspected theater cleaning awhile.

The extra cleaning necessarily bad thing. It’s doesn’t help Coronavirus. noticed folks anti mask truthers *really* cleaning surfaces thinking spreads.

I suspect way trying rectify wearing mask actually concerned virus. said, yet meet folks scrubbing things wearing masks. I’m sure exist haven’t met them. Bro ain’t posting truth, you’re full shit. Get yourself.  liberal snowflake governors Yeah lol, I've watching finger pointing closely. read latest news, say coronavirus make sperm less efficient ? Well yes, solved. It’s can’t explain it. patients socializing much many public social interactions can’t help track disease narrower vector origin. failing experts population bouncing around instead isolating. Haha, oh poor thing. life feels like? Nope. I’m fucking sick sacrificial lamb. eternal sacrifice keep society running?  aren’t even getting hazard pay healthcare. Try living real world we’re fucking dying dude.  Jesus Christ. think factor, make important one. also think mistake lump 'the West' one category. England, much common Europe, also marked differences attitude would lead suggest we're European history culture; we're simply geographically close Europe. point hundred years relative peace prosperity, I've read Hong Kong Asian Flu years, based purely anecdotal hand downs people like Mother, one batted eye-lid carried normal giving much thought all.

When think gone badly wrong country, think fractious country always case. Politicians can't work together even situation serious this, large minority care anyone else, people always looking apportion blame (some unreasonable defies belief), culture sections society sneering one another: working class sneering everyone else, middle class on, result one willing work together.

The necessarily apply 'the West' whole.

And yet, many generous people country. People raise £30m NHS charities within days, people generously giving food banks point food banks much stuff can't give away, millions people volunteering provide comfort food delivery services people alone can't get food on.

It's easy find contributing factors as: inability see danger, planning, poor execution scientists' guidance government people; easy nail underpins that. say, listen radio shows phone ins people walks life, comes mind fractious country looking apportion blame, even reveling chaos, rather work together find solutions. appreciate time took explain this. Thank you. Really? Amazing, like free vasectomy! Remember woman almost lost gubernatorial election democrat one conservative states country.

She 11,000 votes, 3 point margin. predecessor 4 years earlier 125,000 votes, 45 point margin. maybe tie back complete return schools without much regards safety. People wanted get back normal it’s biting Dakotas ass hard maybe old people don’t give shit would rather see family instead? everyday dice roll live die tend prioritize. Washington St here. qualify? I'll meet border! Australians STILL social distance. I've never seen 9 months.

I say we're well... I'd say we're incredibly LUCKY fared badly countries. That's nurses give notice strike - hospital stop admits, transfer patients, get scabs. might well.

Pretty much everyone know Canada says take vaccine anyway. 

What perfect storm absolutely ignorant uneducated fucks.

I'm embarrassed morons know tell so. Honestly, would fully support did. 

We collectively deserve every single piece consequences would entail. parent kid knows go school bring home every communicable disease exists classroom. New parents routinely get sick first kid starts going school.

Deep down, nobody believed nonsense kids unable get sick. 

What believed send kids school. reasons could anything needing childcare, wanting socialized, simply wanting house. 

Sometimes politics rocket science. one times. Trump wants else approval. Tell people want hear, you’ll usually get it. Trump doesn’t care people disagree him. actively stirs people disagree him. relies people disagree him. can’t stand someone gets way getting approval craves. moment happens, they’re there. profit healthcare looks like. products produced exploited slave labor. really time us start making different choices get products, stop utilizing convenience. people like this. system changed. don’t know purifiers small enough filters capture viruses, though seen really cool UV light purifiers would destroy hanging air (obviously use people nearby :D) Must nice live civilized country. Thank you!!! don’t everything power manipulate masses living like nothing wrong. Spent 5 million COVID money tourism ads, praised Sturgis, brought Trump fireworks 4th July absolute worst encouraging complete return school without guidance true safety. Schools differently spike last 45 days directly tied back opinion. super Meth’d Osrs people hold pencil whole fist.  'experts' also can't explain unexplained infections. huge numbers people say 'I know got it'. new normal line pushed reason goes beyond usual media hype. Google UN Agenda 2030. Oh no. could prevented this. tragedy. happened nicer people. made deals buy doses per capita nation, according researchers Duke Global Health Innovation Center North Carolina.

That's read. 

Or, fact, word ""extra"" headline really enough get what's going on. Yeahh, depends sensitivity timing test. Texan here. absolutely jealous. outrageous people mad cannot spit faces. could announce end billable charting, like bus drivers stopping fair collection strike actions.

Hospital groups would lean fast hard local authorities crack down.

I think full proper strike might get today afterwards organizers would lose licenses maybe even get criminal charges.  [Studies found wealthy people genuinely see superior [you're wrong decades. also take lot knowledge either. Maybe, people. Producing vaccine takes time, vaccination takes time, need two shots. 100% effective. large percentage want vaccinated. 

Realistically, may start noticeable effect next summer hopefully we'll able get closer normal next fall. still, flu season bad years come. even vaccinated people get sick, need keep protecting disease-spreaders (also known anti vaxxers). 

Not even talking mutations, get depressed. Sun, shit still 93 million miles away. remember scientists thought eventually SARS-COV2 become seasonal cold/flu like infection reason bad everyone prior experience beginning new cold coronavirus people consistently boycott. Hopefully awareness number keep growing. A-tishoo! A-tishoo! fall down. Yeah, like 7 days Christmas it’s new year shit talker respect 😂.past incidents sense murders black brothers sisters media hidding u don’t remember them?. random guy can’t trust bullshit talk either!! workers like police

Per capita poor way tracking countries deal pandemics, ignores population density. Italy 200 people per square km. United States 34. dealing pandemic spreads human contact, expect denser populations worse. Instead numbers pretty much same. Agreed - suffering around. Gen X worried Boomer parents (and husband!), plus teen would conceivably go college two years. parents retirement money last? husband keep getting check? end one house? 

I see people ages assholes right too. young people old people. Many friends Gen X bracket living like issue. 

I truly sorry suffering hope continue stick around. Come TN I’ll give mom hug. ANYONE say life back pre-COVID normalcy. people SPREADING disease.

COVID nature. can’t argue it. Pointing people shitheads get exactly nothing. fact people fucking makes things dangerous. 

Stay. Fucking. Home. Reddit hive mind depraved lacks meaningful moral compass. consumed selfishness makes miserable people. I’m well aware it’s politicians responsible citizens safety ensuring public health officials minimum level competency. Clearly Tegnell tragedy fully Government’s head. Yeah big one job Lol, downvote me, take snarky-ass attitude ""we're listening"", say *feel* I'm full shit.

Here's good one: poorly-adjusted shitheads act irrationally they're sitting end VPN. Ignorance lack personal accountability US caused this. sources place January could see bad China- like videos Reddit showing lockdowns- people jumping windows, dropping street- Doctors scientist YT catching wind, briefings- even though call time- anyone knows pandemic guidelines knew was. need someone tell cobra bite know play one- guess do.

Alright?! let intelligent informed provide opinion without getting feelings hurt.That's problem everyone read headline virologist- yet need politician tell 2nd largest economy world shutdown common flu/cold wonder see that, though.

Preliminary review done, DSMB government created board, nature biased  outside peer reviews gotten study data confirm findings sure people's reluctance vaccine information moderns interim, final long term review. Gamblers like crackheads. Oh stop it. know mom made recovery. obviously horrified anyone would say miracle mother died yet recovered. Unless absolutely recovered, would farthest thing miracle - thankfully did.  Doesn’t also mean long term safety/risk complications vaccine unknown well? know people get mad even asked many think thoughts allowed had, genuinely concerned everything related new. Also, already antibodies, would still need vaccine? Watch Vermont - huge spike people searching fir covid testing today. 

MA, NH big spikes last days. Sadly, 2-3 weeks waves begin northeast :( don’t need inexact experiment. Experts stated evidence formite transmission occurred Covid probably deeper knowledge matter releasing statements public. confidence level likely pretty high say so. Politicians aren’t deciding approach, epidemiologists are. 

Why don’t arrive conclusions epidemiologists interesting question, probably answered current climate discussion. (Especially us average joes.) It’s not. Cleaning supplies detergents, acids, alkaline things, friction kills viruses/bacteria, simply get surface. people talk “superbugs,” referencing antibiotic resistance. Surface cleaning use antibiotics found medicines. stick get results? realistically it'll arrive spring. even fucking hit winter yet. Seems like logical move considering SB County leads CA per capita cases moment. “When I’m top won’t want workers unionize either!!” X “Fuck wearing seatbelt driving drunk god wants happen it’ll happen” Like wtf people mindless drones autopilot ?

Rural Ohio here, many months cities get wait time? gots muh freedumbs $2000 fine wearing mask? Genuinely curious. Calgary, it’s $50 fine highly, highly doubt single fine handed [The droplets go air matter Sure randomized controlled data like Denmark study, pretty clear demonstration masks really stopping particles, reducing bit. masks get dirty (i.e. frequent re-use people doing) effect pretty much negligible. virus persisting air surfaces problem, soon take mask home, touch nose mouth virus hands going way in. Many scientists agree simply washing hands frequently effective wearing masks much less intrusive. 

What would propose: focus protection vulnerable populations vaccine. focus much keeping numbers down, focus preventing could potentially die virus contracting it. Isolate old immunocompromised working population much possible. Support financially supplemental income, make sure delivery services know serving someone high risk take extra steps minimize contact sterilize parcels. Everyone low risk- back normal. Completely. low risk population contracted virus got herd immunity would minimal deaths even need vaccine lockdowns masks stop virus dead tracks. erectile dysfunction? 38% aren’t taking seriously??

It’s airborne virus. mask doesn’t prevent transmission. everyone wearing masks studies show helps. still silver bullet. People say involved crisis actors.

You can’t reason someone far thinks it’s hoax. force comply via mandates, lockdowns, etc. Nothing bad news anymore.

Any suggestions deal people believe this?? said masks may help, changed mind. said aren’t known cases asymptomatic C19 infections, backtracked that. they’re backtracking too. really feel they’re politically motivated. vaccines remain largely skeptical one.

But Atlantic asshats clickbait ""you get COVID, matter time ultimately"" articles circulating early April, I've made point never click shit.

What's gist article? Thanks!   source that? one Missouri named Bob Parson. forgot Korea, less deaths North Dakota. Except people like Scott Gotleib Keep pushing also.  Well, reason. Fragile ecosystem we've spent huge sums trying reverse/live past damage, cane toad rabbit lesson learnt well.

Keeping infectious deadly disease kind extension that. Particularly past concern SARS. non-boomer WWII generation, 90s literally fought, worked, sacrificed, survived world today? 

Do people older relatives care love? 

Even then, entitlement article astounding. saw study weeks ago showing high number people recovered started show signs depression mental illness. doesn’t seem crazy since know many people don’t recover taste smell months seems neurological component it. I’m scared may pop long term developmental impacts kids infected, even bounce back quickly Well closing businesses means people lose jobs businesses close down. Cancelling holiday doesn’t mean shit Yeah they’re blaming everything COVID  test = cases Deniers forgo medical treatment imo. Save ones safe

But full access vaccine change mind tease data? give us know. Anti union training part onboarding major discount home goods chain store opening. Eye opening. That’s freedom speech even means..... me. Facts facts. Welcome internet. think bad here, check Facebook sometime. means vaccines? Thank answering. last comment makes sense. allowing contraception abortion bad society? It’s better society allow couples planned children instead unplanned children. Earlier year reports hospitals filling NY.. jackass went random local hospital burbs posted See... nobody here. Hospital fine. hoax. listen news confirms already held beliefs.


If someone wants make money, YouTube news spinoff pandering far right talking points would take off! ya wanna sell soul whatever IMO “worst” advice pandemic early on, admittedly didn’t know certain Covid airborne, experts stressed hand hygiene. Hand hygiene important, hand sanitizer world isn’t going much you’re poorly circulated airspace infected person airborne pandemic. vaccine trials happen US Brazil. Regardless developers come countries. order test efficacy need certain infection level. Japan, Korea China would work. good ole US plenty infection potential. enough people boycott matter. sell efforts short.

I drive currently. boycotting gas purchases, lot companies also products boycott. matter. Thank part :) Excellent point. Wow. Crucify jerks. times clinically appropriate do...... bet person quoted says they're ""peace, love, unity"" also lol. Ridiculous. There's immoral illogical thought process behind ugly thoughts. Many people do. question balancing desires. might super fun bet lives sick workers too, us interested finding out. No, means one student charge medical treatment every single patient specific floor. good experience treat one patient much less entire floor patients. might well let ppl commit crimes they're going something stupid. Tarrant Co spike cases? Tracers say lot Cowboys home game. anyone feel like whole thing may result fewer people going nursing? always seemed (I grew city got one rolling it) many people grew went school became nurses basically always hiring decent pay etc.

But looking career choice I’m sure nursing would make cut seeing this.

Abuse sides, protection work, patients sometimes believing diagnosis, people perpetuating break burn March barely end sight.

No thanks. don’t know. hope ten years lot retired many new ones. species great adapting, terrible analyzing impact multiple variables once. Collectively, go common denominator, also typically path least resistance. 

We already know clean surfaces. already know wash hands. already know distance nouns dislike. commonplace daily lives accepted worldwide decades. However, easy steps enough, humans become discouraged give up. “I already x, y, z...but didn’t work. want what?!”

Do know wear mask? Sure — yet ingrained culture Western Civilization.

Wear mask, people. good. Fair enough binary thinking issue. People care preventable deaths feom virus humans farmed minks vectors. means contain behavior.

Dying coronavirus struggling breath painful, difficult death. It’s avoidable.

Then, course, complete lack concern health care workers. countries also recommend physical distancing hand washing. guess failure also proven measures work? fairly easy understand many parameters decide goes.  


Typical ask Norway Finland “right now” Sweden doesn’t. wrote. I‘ll answer anyway: Right FI adequate testing capacity, means right FI much better contact tracing. Right FI ask close contacts \*without\* symptoms isolate get tested. 

At time reaping benefits light early lockdown spring meant significantly less spread society entered autumn, compared Sweden. Wormsblink mentioned, tokens, location tracked. GPS function. data stored token (no centralised storage) 25 days. potential case, data automatically deleted one accessing think issue would get patient already good shape arrive sign waver filmed treatment end. 

Maybe people get presign document way ever even get covid, like organ donors? saddest part it’s sickening ""being charge"". phrase means manager think thats stated. mean staff floor would students? *primarily* spread air still transmitted touching surfaces touching mouth eyes. still sanitizing left fight every little bit helps. sound like fun person around.  Well. I’ve lost 20lbs highest Covid weight still 45lbs completely obese categories. risk dying weight despite 30 years old terrifying. know every pound lost helps reduce risk it’s enough end day? 

I wanted lose weight anyways good motivation. I’m thankful I’m 2017 300lbs. I’m low 200s now. listen podcasts shopping?? indoors especially there’s inadequate airflow lead majority infection, even wearing mask. infected person wearing non-sealed mask going slowly emit airborne particles sides mask. room someone infected, unless wearing sealed N95, enough airborne particles going eventually creep openings mask. common sense, activities like indoor dining cannot happen. It’s anything activity prolonged periods time indoors happen. TX least 6K excess deaths earlier year. tagged pneumonia deaths. I’m surprised moderators allowed political post. “They knew signed for”
“They take uniform time” workplace already requires us get yearly flu vaccine, ABSOLUTELY make us get COVID vaccine available. grandmom lives 6 hours brother, cousins, &amp; families uses keep touch necessarily. lot farmers hurt small shutdown do. Regardless plant running full grown pigs leave farm new ones cont in. point giving away hogs. killing save throwing dumpsters. easy choice. stated is. make false assumptions assign me. made getting med school easier well residency. pandemic shown ill equipped understaffed many hospitals US Also even bother trying explain ""excess death"" people. Last saw we're pushing 335k dead. 335k survival rate 167.5mil infections, aka half country. understand anyone pleased infection rate 8% goal 5. Plus think difficult distance elementary/middle school students.
Vaccine practically around corner. goal infect everyone distribution? people self-centered clueless douche. free will, high demand workers low supply workers. Plus Facebook, Fox News Trump lying faces non-stop. don't, also use definition monopoly 1800's first year economic classes lmao Everyone association instantly use discredit individual reason, post invalid. supportive argument Watson, fact. Name someone instantly find way discredit using logic. saying....  Rather means coat wide array surfaces lingers spreads. Infection chance lower, impossible. 

Airborne mean anti-gravity. micro droplets still fall down. Wow, that's crazy. Never heard it, experienced myself. again, buy sandwiches. It’s crazy cases sky rocketed since early October. It’s going long winter Sometimes wonder bang pots pans drown pleas voices rather cheer us on. God could come tell stop worshipping would continue whole thing them, ""bigger picture"" god himself. individual liberty. I’m proposing what’s best community. 100 people die 1 person liberty decide whether want vaccination not?

You don’t appear know words mean, considering think “democracy” means “where rights can’t taken away”. democratically elect people time stripped away right privacy, right bear arms, etc.

You might want educate terms throw around blindly. Yeah fall get car accident. careful time.  global emergency costing many trillions dollars, may well little bit extra work case. Masks social distancing full proof, add bunch mitigation together best work with... mostly lot people listen personally responsible.

It's hard force everyone wear masks socially distance. hard clean surfaces put plexiglass shields use forehead scanner. 

A lot stores cleaning begin temperature scans reliable work sometimes.

Whoever taught accomplishing things life NOTHING, planted seed stupid brain train think like ASAP!

Of course adding multiple small risk mitigation together global disaster immediate end sight right way handle things. things decrease chance spread percent vs 50% reason them.

Plus people plenty extra time low demand(unless healthcare course), something extra time. paying workers run store lower usual demand, may well cleaning trying mitigate spread within limited role. 

When go store see employees trying, even efforts flawed, know people actually care limiting spread vs putting masks show. 


When first outbreaks happened masks store limit rules places like Walmart employees jobs like normal wiping hands faces... like normal. wearing masks cleaning everything KEEPING SAFE too.

Perhaps consider employees might want spare time keep safe essential workers customers would find sense comfort employees going beyond.

Technically really even clean store? still sell good it. Lots stores operate good cleaning clean bathrooms... go store nice clean clean bathrooms like WOW.. much nicer. Maybe pay go place instead!

You wrong efforts add reduces risk wrong think employees customer gaining comfort actions bad thing. good business customers. store hand cleaner wearing masks cleaning more, made, one way other, take virus seriously. BEHAVIOR spreads people customers. people take seriously, people take seriously leading example putting effort even science still decided smart move.

**You kind sound like people told us wear masks scientifically good enough filter virus particles. turned bullshit! Every little bit helps! game probability, adjust odds better chance winning.** 

It's better around people, that's practical small part population. China shows lock way contain virus, infact shows mass testing, robust contact tracing also way contained virus like Hainan Xinjiang. lock routine way control virus last resort virus uncontrolled enough test kits. also idea dealing time

On hand, Taiwan lock needed. never large outbreak local transmitted case unknown source. job easier need control border. suddenly several thousand cases pop let say Kaohsiung, sources cases untraceable lock warranted. enough resources Chinese style mass testing also viable.

China never dogmatic, cling inflexible ideology comes containing virus. Like Deng Xiao Ping said: ""Black cats white cats, long catch mice"". still cling freedom human rights lock needed cause harm good. Whats point freedom human rights dead. Fuck lying greaseball! He’s like rest rich, “do say, do”. Dego scum They’re letting anyone die, facility act together.  nightclub scene telenovela (soap opera) TV last night - felt bit giddy seeing non-social-distancing... Nah, I'm good. Pft. gods will, except brushing teeth, taking medicine, advil, wearing cast break bone, chosing eat morning, whether christianity survives. minds would blown God really said religion die off.  say year good, anyone?

Nowhere.

Everyone shit time, people harder time taking sour pill months others.

People experienced kind trouble hardship life apparently suited get it, people never felt real hunger parents someone else fixing problems life now.

Suck like rest us find positivity create can't. eventually end, everything ending, always.

That saying. heart skipped beat read title ""end covid sight"" lmao No? mean wear public. Obviously don’t home. I’ve (WAY many times now) HVAC guys roofing guy house even they’re house wear mask. Apparently virus magical mutation makes weak people wear masks, unlike every respiratory virus ever. 

Is possible magical mutation one find also makes impossible spread fomite transfer? I'm disputing - evidence support something different. 

I made mention morons know.

Which turns speak everyone. believe 945 foreginers entire continent America tested positive Korea throughout pandemic accurate representation what's going US Brazil. 

Chinese along Korean China still tested positive September showing symptoms.

Overall public covid data publishing sad joke Poland, main channel government shares covid updates Twitter (seriously), complete public database info curated 19-year old hobbyist, data dashboards graphs comes Poland, government seems incapable (or unwilling to) creating dashboard database own.  one wants give Australia credit response reason. would one people thinking pessimistic way happen. Guess thought people would take somewhat serious now. rate prediction may true atleast close half million Embarrassment? social distance ? And? hospitals problem treating staff right. doormat isn’t good look. opinions like exactly I'm going say actually wearing mask often outside winter, regardless im sick not.

I've actually really liked one taking walk dont get runny nose outside. fairly warm one on.

I'm saying unfortunately CDC guidance falling deaf ears 90% American population going see grim(mer) winter it. feel okay seeing family (one person), like said I've tested self-isolated 14 days, holiday also sympathize always easy situation everyone. think people making concessions like driving, quarantining before, etc. 100% foolproof, respect effort conscious. heard Dr. Fauci NPR Tuesday saying we’re. So. Close. beating thing. 60 million doses vaccine likely distributed health care workers high risk people *next month* hundreds millions spring. 

It’s Marshmallow Test grown-ups. I'm pretty sure god worship really devil disguise. tricked them. dinner table risky you’re close prolonged amount time. 6 feet away windy day would fine. True, considered that. Still though, promising start happening much sooner expected to. tried, conservative group sued giving counties authority issue mask mandates. think he’s much chicken. always humors misinformed conspiratorial minded individuals get implausible ""truth"" twitter, youtube etc. try claim everybody else sheep lol. response made public health agencies responded crisis, and--at least country--there never call social distancing, public mask wearing, shutdowns.

So understand think every public health agency around world launching alarm virus launch alarm H1N1? Perhaps COVID19 hell lot dangerous? Take $1,000 pay get 2 stitches put daughter’s face

The scariest part entire thread knowledge someone thick reproduced. lmao hardcore redditors People city literally posting memes FUK U GOVERNMINT AH WUT AH WAWNT daily updates COVID cases city government puts out. Meanwhile, city county virtually zero mask mandates, I’ve seen social distancing actually enforced, caseload skyrocketing. Shocking, know. Pfizer jabbed kids pretty recently. like say logic used any.

You selfish. You’re raging system isn’t working actively flouting rules. millions like are.

I’m sad America. Yeah, scary much cases going amount people still refuse simple things like wear mask keep physical distance. Hello; know people holding outdoor hangouts (and warm enough right now). latest science holding without masks on? people pod - I'm little concerned attending. However, go restaurants (outdoors) gone doctors (indoors+masked). risky outdoors unmasked dinner table people know well? That’s still almost 10% Canadians. enough herd immunity, assuming go vulnerable/front-line populations, lot significantly reduce mortality/hospital strains would assume blame Trump, alone give us this. Please include federal government, state government, local governments. every state deserves amount blame criminal passing buck. lot system's issues exposed heard word one addressing problems. Covid eventually dealt one way another. much focusing issues exposed demanding lawmakers fix shit get removed put people place will.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit - replaced were. football important health I'll take ""No Shit"" 500, Alex original ""rules"" dealing virus re-examined superseded general use, they're still practiced businesses hoping avoid liability people getting sick. 

The safest thing businesses keep official advice says, new advice guidelines government work moment.

At point know Coronavirus airborne certain cases, 6 feet distance means less outdoors indoors ventilation use.  know many cases asymptomatic, temperature screening partially accurate.  

The known completely ""safe"" thing point stay home healthy people family. come contact share air anyone infected, very, high probability staying healthy.

But stores can't that, level ""want"" need stay open (like supply chains food/medicine, etc). best moment, try ventilate, clean, get everyone wear masks.

FYI, cleaning surfaces worthless even Coronavirus live long infect people way.  Someone getting COVID along flu even bad cold time could real trouble, cleaning surfaces prevents viruses bacteria spreading diseases.   guy’s public health measure make sure everyone takes Moderna vaccine! Pretty sure Vaccine gonna forever. It’s like Flu shot Chicken pox shot. get it, can’t get infected create. Accelerate evolution of. Speed gain function. RIP. State still refuses take steps forward enforce set rules Zoom call: ""You know do, treat like children tell right thing. Then, don't, tell we're disappointed them!"" Yes, already know this. response response guy  WRONG PEOPLE WHO's Europe region definition includes 53 countries: included countries: Hans Kluge said Thursday 53 countries make WHO’s European region recorded 15.7m Covid-19 cases – including 4m month alone – nearly 355,000 deaths.""

This way reporting data bit sensationalist mind, since region match geographical definition Europe normally draw Eastern border Ural mountains.  meh, post true know it, men buy fur coats much. demand fur predominantly driven women consumers. Someone asked happened now.

This part survive vaccines arrive.

Don't give up. We're almost there. end sight. Stay safe everyone. made recommendation month ago expect restrictions work? Restrictions prolonging inevitable. order restrictions make sense would proven potential thwart covid entirely. case, virus assumingly simply spread rampant whenever restrictions lifted. begs question: simply lock indefinitely? know thwarting covid entirely happen, even vaccine. 

Listen, I'm frustrated apologise come rude, genuine question seem really good answer. think logic follow such: Lockdowns restrictions, even best form, incapable getting rid covid regardless long they're place. Therefore, decide say fuck return sense normalcy. 8 months gone by, that's enough prove restrictions futile, whole ""oh they'd work people like part"" founded absolutely zero evidence frankly care anyway. Yes, would gladly put risk getting sick meant could life back. Yes, that's selfish. No, care. 'this temporary'. mentioned keep closing opening till late spring... hidden intent. sure viewed imposters, ya know? That's kinda nice though, really glad hear that. sucks hard two countries enable easy migration can't begin imagine got downvoted stating salient facts, upvote. Kenneth Copeland would say, ""idc do, better give tithes. Tell friend tithe too."" assertion first positions wrong know it.

The claim masks useful. telling people hoard medical masks. Plenty STEMs antiscience agendas. Like current coronavirus task force advisor. messed up. government doesn’t subsidize businesses forces shut thus ensuring go business. least countries get 75%-ish previous YTD sales. 

Get act together Congress!! Considering vaccine almost certainly go at-risk groups elderly (after front line workers), almost immediately cuts death hospitalization rate virus, locked begin with. no, many people ""too excited"". What’s aggravating recently go New England people seem taken seriously, everyone wearing masks everywhere went, government handling pandemic aggressively since February. pleased see things almost “normal” there. 

Then come back Midwestern shitshow legislature fighting governor’s mask mandate people don’t give damn. NY single digit deaths couple thousand hospitals since July...anyone paying attention see that. No, they'd rather risk deaths they're convinced danger minimal. facing certain death they're gambling faulty odds.  wild maybe, mink farms countries. might bring back virus minks would died vain. Don’t mean irresponsible get it. grandfather old wants see grandkids. He’s fine death long time. brother refused chemo recurrence spent time friends family knowing would die. 

Point older people think differently younger people. lot older people would rather die seeing family one last time dying alone quarantine. Sucks think way. remember also pfizer moderna two dose vaccines. really enough 2 million 1 million people respectively that's order quantity feds keeping. still help lot healthcare workers LTC residents. lol Leadership failed us. ""Was wrong? done that? tell ya, gotta plead ignorance one, anyone told sort thing frowned upon, know..."" Spoiler: It’ll option A. ^^ this

basically, worth limit contacts others minimum till April/May... even vaccines going significantly impact spread time. Proving reinfection difficult, get that. can't say reinfections common based difficulty demonstrate.

And never talking protective immunity, talk capacity body remember previous infections fight them.

I get say losing CD8 cells (honestly, look well), reason authors seem give importance fact do. Maybe right, maybe are.

About immune response SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 agree, cross immunity 2 proven, think immune response similar live world believe causality. Feels shitty staying hotel spent honeymoon in, I’ve cancelled vacations, including returning Hawaii year! ""Also bring money"" Mine ""duh"", idea. I’d say it’s late stage capitalism playing out. You’re telling utterly gleeful mass death allowing get bigger pay check. It’s shocking you’re nurse sound sociopathic enough CEO. hear Tyson foods really rewards excited profit mass death, might wanna consider career change. mean could making lot pandemic!

If Fed hadn’t lied constantly 8 months telling everyone flu &amp; saying would go away, positioned mask wearing liberal agenda idiots made hill willing die paid literally everyone stay home month wouldn’t mess. 

But sure, it’s Darwin playing even doesn’t matter careful individual. mean you’re high risk it’s lock away, like millions mouth breathers actively trying kill rest us spreading plague. 

My husband locked apt since March assholes. immunocompromised suppose ok - cause know put shut sacrificial lambs capitalism!

My husband damn lucky still job able work home nothing refuse accept job puts risk know gets die. America love fake paper don’t care many lives lost. always dollar lives people like happy benefiting. It’s disturbingly gross. First symptom coronavirus desire travel socialize. Yesss track Careful exercising post COVID. Pretty sure articles talking damage COVID heart lead heart attacks, months later strained. No. You’re genuinely wrong. Dangerously wrong.

People aren’t going forget. going end months hopefully. us though. 2020 taught many people around globe survival threatened around us need better protect future. Yes outlier. way knowing you’re careful millions others reckless ignorant right now.

People dying. health care workers obviously early receivers. next ones line ones potential superspreaders. that, they'll go people 65 first, even though people tend cul-de-sacs spread. It’s even funny anymore wasn’t, less 20/100 people eligible vote (and federal elections time either mind you) democracy, people voted napoleon NK that’s sufficient criteria people, dying hospitals covid, still insisting hoax. Big true Already seeing posts FaceBook can't let government control holiday! wont told many people host, stop living fear! America butt fuck real Counterpoint: Dr. Scott Atlas says everything going perfectly. Humans social animals. Many people like told do. also thought people would come together fight common enemy, way wrong.  We're social animals. Solitary confinement drives people insane. feel like Tim Walz one governors Midwest trying protect citizens Bring body bags technically incorrect Pfizer Moderna yet published, roughly 0% chance results announced going publish -- would really dumb lie NEJM Lancet paper soon they'll submitting data FDA (which look kindly upon lying efficacy).

It's perfectly reasonable happy news happy Pfizer Moderna think they're lying teeth absolutely benefit immense downside. ""Just give guys, hopeless, let happen..."" 

Doesn't sound like side honestly. enclosed public place people could visit time Wisconsin.... just.. time. smell mouth too. weird Yeah neither practice independent still need report doctor. NPs trying lobby that, ridiculous patients deserve treated doctor case severe enough. Protests. Dodgers/Lakers celebrations. Biden support marches. Trump marches. Holidays. COVID fatigue. Work places demanding return office. General stupidity. least small part, figuring much attribute event long while.

Edit: forgot certain schools open.  I'm done wasting time fool like you. fun getting intubated! see how. people always higher risk illness usually kind dumbasses. likely they're huddling sharing moment well lighter. makes case different true reinfection—although Vennema says perhaps considered similar, cases immune system failed mount protective response. idea getting downvoted.

This true  Curbside pick tyranny. die. develop long term disabilities. kill someone else give long term disabilities.
 
Plus, I've got say, must pretty sad life can't find way live fulfilling life this. Pick new hobby. Teach skill. Learn something. rush ""get life back now"" vapid understand could've enjoyable life entire time. pandemic ends at-risk people healthcare workers vaccinated, USA expects 100 million people vaccinated end March, numbers definitely line us back normal then.  Oklahoma steps ring... pretty much study advocated mask studies masks use, saying studies inconclusive.

??? literally discussed another study advocated mask use earlier. said studies inconclusive, referring surgery mask use (evidenced wrote quote think masks stop viral spread surgery, think going much worn people know wear them, wash use proper hygiene.

This context open wound. saying significant effect? study Covid specifically airborne diseases bias comes nowhere.

I biased favor scientific consensus. repeating many times now, please explain yours.  Um... Canadá deals place 414M doses 7 different suppliers right now. 2 vaccines proven effective, 76M doses order. 7 they’re supplied prove effective, they’ll end enough doses vaccinate whole population 5x over. Yeah bro, actually got Covid started outbreak killed 3000 people.. oh wait, haven’t. tons people haven’t either safely responsibly see people. 

Just gonna burst bubble here, I’m say going blow mind there’s way you’ll think I’m telling truth get ready crazy shit.

Me family regularly seeing friends throughout nearly whole pandemic... ONE GOTTEN COVID!!!!! 

When set weird standards it’s going grind fully people like experiencing contribute people writing pandemic “no big deal”

They’ll see hysterical, fear-mongering, know-it-all, maniac going cause care pandemic even less good? want truthful OP endgame getting next month, think, companies going sit ass 3 months? No, it’s going constant rollout.

Plus aren’t even two vaccines. account ramp production.  job people act like bullshit I'm overreacting. can't get anyone respect social distancing guidelines I'm always seeing lips. People wondering I'm angry depressed really fucking set off. Bad enough actively trying get killed. comment mental state seems. mom alone high risk. help anything can't sure I'm clean. Shell definitely die catches it. I'm one killed her, able live myself. guess happy. hate job everyone it. Trump said would go away like miracle! /s also context way Boomer's used trying make insult, think anyone age grp really likes called connotations used said. likely Maybe? Right seems like location / airline specific also depend vaccine progression. also important remember rapid tests 100% accurate. generally, yes, think increased testing key helping society reopen. North South Dakota really suck Thank god

 stop farming animals weird ways ffs White supremacists, definitely r/sadcringe data inaccurately reporting? Dozens Florida hospitals ran ICU beds government even enough money pay americans?  powerless, sorry. say Trumpists. Even lost loved one , eat ""no one done Americans have"" crock shit. Done? even close. Starting get regular people sure, done time next year. I'm doctor, could've told that. “I’m living” would’ve sufficed car accidents contagious? christmas?? damn went first place last place Cool, yeah, ended quarantine 9th really recent damn huge people aren't(or even want ""new normal"" long term rreplacement know got from). Given vaccines practically going ready soon. bunker little bit more. Welp, looks like comments hidden. letter criticizing meta-analysis mask usage influenza

That pretty much study advocated mask use.

There studies masks use, saying studies inconclusive.

Yes think masks stop viral spread surgery, think going much worn people know wear them, wash use proper hygiene.

Your bias comes nowhere. money, people show up, money collect passing plate That’s based reality. Getting together Thanksgiving bit like driving drunk. everyone going end tragedy, that’s safe do; got lucky. know person replied also working? lot students also jobs.

Also, fair, jobs set hours. know also jobs take work home, full-time jobs 40 hours week. I'm graduate student course work alone probably takes least 40 hours per week. 10 hours meetings per week plus research. could really used break semester. Nights weekends count breaks constantly working them. 

Don't get wrong, I'm complaining make adjustments life keep everyone safe. everything fully online, could much-needed fall break.  Would fall Takings Clause (because Intellectual Property) require government pay market value? remember gop Teabagging. advice regulations going work. reason thought leaders topic keep saying even vaccinations masks distancing need stick around while. Literally zero forethought beyond profit.

This Corporate America nutshell. provides evidence need nationalize healthcare system. people done giving shit. Ugh. [Have nice brand new information! going home, part messages like one linked post. go home, I'd drive, stay family three weeks, like rest family, never leave house except go runs, drive back.

Instead, spend next weeks live. go stores regularly, buy food necessities. go gym long open, go bars outdoor seating.

The reality me, around family help mentally restricting parts life. since going home, find ways cope. really clear traveling really beneficial long run. hawaii seeing rise definitely lowest quarantine. thing lot people coming state supposed quarantining 14 days surprised actually get citation now. (state didnt anything quarantine breakers long time) seems lot people coming absolutely idea 14 day quarantine pre flight covid test. Screw em. means get mine faster. ironic Trump complained ""pantry"" empty came in, bet he'll one full trash bag full pantry items way WH. 

""im one re-stocked shelves, basically stuff anyway"" Covid19 climate change easy mode we’re coming D-rank. See talking about. done late April. start path done April. come May 1, like 300M people US suddenly immunized. think God meant was...... DETROIT – Kelly Stafford, wife Detroit Lions QB Matthew Stafford, called Michigan “dictatorship” social media rant state’s new COVID-19 “I’m living dictatorship call Michigan,” Kelly Stafford said Instagram story. “I understand there’s pandemic, understand it’s scary. I’m scared too. risk, leave house there’s vaccine. shutting small businesses -- things people worked life -- shutting answer, make it.” thinks 0.6% using multiple studies thing hate people saying “the goalposts constantly moved” that’s justification continue whatever fuck want. doesn’t take genius ignore whatever bullshit US govt spouting instead follow successful countries (masks, contact tracing, quarantine, social distancing) confidently say likely never ever happen. 

We built entire civilization around packed top other. That’s pack mentality even wanted take humans, would take thousands years evolve out. 

We like around other; fact need it. second can, people packed together 2021 probably ever.  yet, I'm one reported! LOL! moment raw data people families stories would life live. Likelihood dying means nothing dead. literally said April ya goon  gonna huge surge thanksgiving :(, set US badly Christmas. Stfu noob social distancing reinfection forever /s charge fees accept food stamps / EBT cards hard low income folks. Tried find store relative another state find closest one free pickup &amp; would accept ebt 1 hour away. far someone multiple health issues create extreme fatigue. Luckily adult child shopped her, unfortunately adult child risk factors too. glad state finally put mask mandate!!!!!!! read article wedding happened bunch people got sick died... people died even wedding. Fkin horrible. state going fully locked down? Deaths 85% though -- Trump says people don’t take threat virus personally seriously poor perception risk worried rushed vaccine. know Europe, certainly nothing tiny, lunatic fringe Germany believes nonsense.  care arm put vaccine tbh. Could leg care Good luck that. know certain it’s WRONG imply validity situation based number “seems” large small based large small.

I also admit knowing breaking point metrics (your word) suggest number COVID patients utilizing hospitals low given period time elapsed overall population served hospitals. 
Your premise generic, best. faced actual numbers, digress. invalidate point. unreasonable expect hospitals adhere *some* level standards service. Yeah, faux pas us actually it. Restaurants half capacity less interaction crowds people wouldn’t think  Haha!
I remember smug aussies saying free covid days ago.

Enjoy repeated lockdowns forever ever. sound like really bad person lol daily 200k cases, good luck. no, many people ""too excited"".

People acting like done, spring. be. mass vaccinations going take close year. excited long road things return normal, expect get vaccine. fully expect mask up, social distance certain things next fall. nothing back said. That’s good know. feel like I'm person super embarrassed this. Sucks man. Murdering death cult. like masks winter. awesome harry potter masks keep face warm. 

But dislike summer. Omg, THANK YOU. feel like there's hardly talk ""safer COVID."" Instead ""abstain"" ""screw COVID, hoax."" culturally (mostly) ethnically. fucked. Hunker winter can. That's they’re homeless job won’t pay right? starving don’t savings? get stabilized thrown streets? That’s works countries right? like waiting easily containable fire house reaches second floor. back normal mean think covid quite bit. never used think twice going grocery store etc. put lot thought everything do, skip lot trips. Last time emergency text went out, mom's hair stylist clients cancelled HEB ran toilet paper again. So, see care different communities impacted differently pandemic, I’m bigot.

Cool. great night. year redditors gotten relish heroes civilization degenerate lifestyle already does, avoiding life never first place. coronavirus stops get self righteous hero nothing lose bashing people livelihoods scared future. Pfizer distributer doesnt make ""Pfizer vaccine"" though. buy gucci shirt amazon doesnt make amazon shirt, even though amazon one selling me. Biontech developed it, called ""Biontech vaccine"". 100 individuals take vaccine, Moderna Pfizer’s versions protect 95 them. issue is: 1) Supply chain; 2) Educating recipients immune 28 days vaccination.

This take time, doubt. say end beginning simply incorrect. people believe real not. lump us category fascist redhats. Asia norm. People usually wear masks sick prevent spreading others. always wondered never caught western countries. I’m sure percentage would natural deaths absent COVID-19 significant majority died 80 . 

Tragic nation 330 million people elderly dying might normally happen unfortunate side effect new disease.

Such life . Right? That's really usual exactly like live (involved informed government, mask social distancing mandates, free testing &lt; 3% falling positive rate). Meh grandma forever, karma temporary -80C freezers uncommon. Moderna alone going able produce enough vaccine everyone. It’s perfectly normal, probably better, changed stance though. Back January February people here, including myself, thought masks useless could actually infect easily. it’s completely shifted, even though still stuck ways. post removed because:

Is way get exposed somehow ? sure study concluded masks reduce spread?

This study found masks significant benefit wearer.

I went explain much evidence masks reduce spread studies.

I fine continue wearing masks appropriate settings, got stop attitude everyone wore mask Covid19 would disappear. got emergency alert Alaska last week.

Just kidding. employees remain understaffed. room consumers! Moneymoneymoney read Pfizer press release. 50 million 2020 explicitly. 1.3 billion 2021 get cases like 50 per day (across city) contact tracers could work effectively. also immediate drive testing (no wait) results 12-24 hours.

Where's deaths peeps at? don’t care color bigot, statement stands. they?

Why would happen? 

I think irrationality worried. Assuming likely scenario comes true vaccine widely distributed time next year back normal. Hell, compared post-Thanksgiving/Christmas, getting started. almost definitely break 2k tonight based areas reported finished reporting yet Wow really good news.  response comments perfectly explains Covid19 gotten bad US. showing 205 deaths now. well 13,331 new cases today, 2nd highest record (highest 13,368 July 15th).

Also, 10% daily cases deaths lately coming El Paso alone, despite area 3-4% Texas’ population. I’m tired, already. We're passing 2,000 today. live Michigan. Last week announced longer going call people may exposed due many positive cases. hospitals completely filled, decision makers completely frozen don’t know do. 

Good luck, everyone. know, important is, think message gone *emergency* text alert system. slippery slope sending texts various number things want citizens hear . . . people stop reading texts think something emergency - bam! dead injured people could've saved they'd gotten warning impending safety concern. 

Covid-19, important issue, meet true definition ""emergency"", since ongoing health issue forms communication getting important updates public. Save emergency communications actual emergencies. OK. Hang onto worry like. keep mind numbers December. nearly double number vaccinated January, still February. 

Some, like yourself, continue wallow fear, bathe imagined threats, people moving back normal lives understanding risks 2020 rearview mirror. I've trying much patience possible people interact with. know everyone mega stressed, including myself. figure best way help people extra nice right now. administration roll over, perhaps concise follow science.. right thing.

I hopefully incoming leadership allow CDC lead, forced anything. need science, politics, must let experts guide us. best brightest -- let's let lead us. We'd better place get-go! oh wow real thing would cool, made vaccine able transmit contact like virus 

Herd immunity real looks like COVID tbh. spouse looked way reddish undertones skin glassy eyes onset illness Oh Christ, know mean best intentions,

Man map kinda sucks. Unless really know exact location place looking basically impossible find location markers are. see lot people approached yelled non-mask wearers tiktoks such. needs stop. Stores need put security outside, maskless people told cannot enter. 

Each us needs enforce 6 foot boundary let maskless people outside yell us close get near us - time walk away, drive away, sanitize, safe. dealing much higher viral loads need shorten exposure. remember reading funeral homes NYC overwhelmed. Also, crematories going overdrive Wuhan.

Do news parts world? personal freedom ended 8 months ago then, right? people told wear masks, stay clean, shit like that? refused. Still cried bars said right American. 

Now vaccine may available, going start mandating entire country get injected else? people 8 months ago told shut mask up? went hard planning now, May Still Business. ""all nothing"" attitude then? Shit, country can't get people put piece cloth face. Good luck trying punish get shot.  telling someone upset smile really rude though Oh dang.

Yes, figure based facts data, guesses population sampling. arent polling people election. make number anything want population sample. make 0.00000000001% 3.45% hard data says is. 

Sure people covid never tested, cant prove many people it. know many undetected cases had. could 10% cases undetected 90% cases undetected. know many cases resulted death many cases longer active. 

So accurate answer could go 3.45% covid cases tested positive resulted death. Everything else is.just.a.guess. free.. least subsidized encourage people test. That's optimistic look things they've done 10 recent tests, positive tests percent 30%. Gonna love class action lawsuit government. Tax payers going wind footing bill people’s healthcare later road.

Nothing like playing chicken people's lives.  Lockdowns would work affect economy would bills rent hold help citizens money countries done. first locked U.S. rent kept going remember getting calla bill collectors thinking.. Seriously? middle pandemic still calling asking money lmao Yeah, heard places even follow arrows roads driving. crazy shit man. Gonna agree you, here. Yeah, headline/article pretty misleading. Anyway, deaths ND actually trending down. second time I've seen book mentioned two separate posts opened back back within 15 seconds European countries closed borders least months. Canada island closed borders. illegal immigrants bringing virus in. vast majority new cases imported legal visitors flying countries. Vietnam island closed borders kept virus out. 

Countries made decision open borders back economic reasons. Keeping NZ border closed devastating economic decision huge parts NZ. I'm teacher school losing 20% teachers next week, laid international students (most NZ public schools fund partly international student fees). Universities worse, Auckland Uni laying 300 staff. 

I'm glad kept borders closed, decision taken lightly. US though agree could never worked. borders issue, simply people would never obeyed govt ordered lockdown severe NZ Australia's. Well come on, mass produce thing get rolling! ass. knew would happen. Everybody knew virus would spread schools. admit happened much slowly I’d anticipated. Jesus christ, Damn near entire frozen section! generation, see average lifespan jump mask-wearers getting sick less often throughout lives, would awesome. spending 22 years getting cold 3-4 times year (even pneumonia once), 2020 first year I'm lucky say I've never gotten ill once.  get sandwich bread Costco.... I'll find new bread boys' french toast.  weird reading Australia. Since pandemic turned patriot. blame reaction slightest, think would much lucky live do. Someone’s enjoying lost election :)  pretty much guarantee India high rate... 3.5% correct based actual data. take number covid deaths divide number cases closed( outcome). clue two getting info, either read correctly misinformation. Figuring mortality pretty simple business. 

If trying figure unreported cases based sampling population antibodies nonsense, accurate bad political poll. science, bunch guesses. Science based facts repeatable observations surveys population samples. I'll admit, first broke February/march, would stick hands 12.5% solution bleach, highest concentrate available, clean hnads. good sociaty social security mechanism's takes burden individuals economical ethical problems. instance Nordic countries paid sick leaves included ones annual leave. Thus times global health crisis affect locally sociaties around world, sociaties resilient safer health pandemic health crisis, social economical problem too. Even better safe sociaties lesser social security mechanisms. Ohhh didn’t actually pay ~$25, that’s without ins. Sounds right. couple constraints AB cocktail (like regeneron one trump had) prevent used widely. 

1) it’s expensive (like $1million/dose expensive)
2) seems effective catch early enough. late doesn’t help

Most people don’t million bucks spend. time get hospital it’s way past effective time. get hospital early, still breathe walk overwhelmed send home anyway. problem avoid gross products/brands  🤢 38% living normal lives, makes think normal life isn’t coming back? Younger people US starting see exactly fucked are. someone explain possible? 1 6 mostly careless? really want understand. Kids class literally yell others faces day space apart eat lunch spray toys end day. K. Sure. There’s 6 day lockdown many Australian cities. Watch Loney Island ""throw ground."" That's type people interviewed this. Bless you, sweet summer child Anyone ever school deal small humans - endless messes, human petri dishes, social animals going follow distancing rules even common sense, mention parents KNOWINGLY send sick children school, sometimes doped fever reducer, obvious in-school assembly highly contagious new disease NEVER going work.

False negatives relatively high, doubt coughing would impact nasal sensitivity.  ...and that's they're **trying** look. time eyes glued phone lap. difficult prove.

Never heard phrase American exceptionalism pandemic.Seems strange call exceptional , it’s sort word applies freely given several others healthcare failing. Apparently healthcare important enough. Apparently past, current &amp; future lives important enough state. Honestly never enjoyed spending time family much. pandemic positive regard least. working home pretty nice. ohio lol saw YouTube clip Joe Rogan today guest talking this. idea could vaccinated something like it’s effective still potentially spread it. vaccines case?   hospitals LA county near overwhelmed. get exponential growth that, point it’s fear mongering. double whammy Christmas New Years, winter going real shit show. think many see writing wall, seem want anything it. region’s schools still session that’s 7-8% positive rate, Thanksgiving next week. Everyone walking around like everything fine. premature wisely proactive? Many PR reasons. Come election, opponent point everything could save many life's possible ordering stay home. Sure really believe help, not. mind said chocolate milk. sure love chocolate milk!!! someone wants speak manager tell “ guys still masking social distancing? vaccine coming January”.

for entire ordeal people fighting mask still looking reasons to, seriously? North Dakota going ""youth movement"". realize Trump scientist. Seriously though. people support Presidents? I'm talking sides here.. put much faith pathetic. healthcare worker Dakotas, strike point? job pick pieces state. Geez. Thats lot boycotting do! mom got covid im scared her. double mastectomy hysterectomy. also history breast cancer issues. 40 i'm fearful wont make it. dad also got sick. siblings tested negative im wondering siblings avoid getting sick. staying rooms work? get covid air vents? Yeah, ingested Lysol bleach. North USA, we're going you. That's there's much resentment. Turn corona others consumption. mean, probably true lot people wouldn’t dismissive poor people. Inflation pretty simple concept. Watch movie takes place past there’s good chance you’ll notice characters say things like “I paid $2,000 car!” That’s learned inflation kid Yea said 4.7 million. Texas 20 million. 

Just like covid, didn’t happen doesn’t mean it’s happening. inner voice Danny DeVito. happens elevator I'm reading phone, library hunting book, supermarket reading ingredients soup etc etc. Men stop stare instruct smile. NEVER happens I'm husband father. I'm alone especially vulnerable, like elevator stairwell library aisle.

Per article applaud decision move online fall winter, keeping schools closed spring might bit premature. Waiting spring break reassess situation might better. Honestly full confidence happening masks would become common post covid since many people actively wear becomes used it. that's one many problems people country. support presidents faith them. I've never supported president long I've alive. They're snakes, people look presidents whatever reason, they're lost. one word holy shit Top execs charged price fixing plant managers taking bets human resources? awful company culture. Plus ton deaths Feb/ March covid filed heart attack pneumonia flu like illness early stages one tests. Lots deaths added total estimates done (based comparison normal death totals things prior years). Eventually Force kick I'll able get car swamp. Honestly, point, schedule strike Dakotas. healthcare system completely saturated asshat sheriffs saying enforce masks. want everyone die bad, healthcare workers save all. They're making bed lie it. Lol... what... one person said that. people willing happy so. make senior citizens everyday America, reckons state take hit cause another 2 million newly minted snow birds next year. someone know, likely either reduces immune response causes increased chance failure. Probably countries too. seem individual nature country serving us well this. Countries view things communal mindset much concerned actions might harm around them. talk people person, either mask without one

that's secret  need take break Twitter bring back real world never thought states would get infected. Yeah, Kylie Jenner’s kid given test admittedly cute video think western countries particular Spanish flu largely hidden due propaganda ww1 many government officials trying hide fact look weak. She’s bad math. wants re-elected representing constituents, apparently want die covid pretending it’s actually lung cancer.

That’s stupid state is. I’m sure well aware mask mandate would save lives. problem South Dakota population doesn’t care saving lives. MAKE LITERALLY THOUSANDS DOLLARS PER YEAR GOD HATE PEOPLE  Anybody ever seen “I legend”?
Or one paranoid this? 5 years? vaccine make get tumors? Cancer? Lumps? thanks  Ah.. uneducated generation. wonder work out. 

You read stats many kids even online school.... hope makes difference hugs too! Going back normal lol, virus doesn’t care someone’s idea normal. People still going hospital, still dieing, world get normal doesn’t stop rolling much nurses get paid Canada? condolences. sounds hard. went indoor gym. It’s airborne virus.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* know Canada election.. get vaccine, would test positive covid antibodies? Exactly! I'm even opposed stuff. legit it.

It's like putting show.... who...? Lots anti-vaxxers comments people able quarantine two weeks...nor rely relatives...especially kids...to same. Also, testing always available areas want one...in areas, can't get tests unless symptomatic test shortages.  that's assuming time tests results back time...because areas, tests taking 10 days....and two negative tests weeks apart guarantee ill. depending travel methodology...going crowded airports, getting planes, stopping roadside rest stops pretty much negate quarantining someone did...or tests took.

So telling people skip turkey single year save relatives lives, unless extreme circumstance, EXACTLY right thing actually. 

Because people making decisions ignore risks, Christmas, whole lot unnecessary bodies piling up. something live regards family. virtual holiday very, very, small sacrifice keep safe. here. purchasing people buying whatever find. current disinfectant “tuburculocidal.” It’s meant use hospitals, indicated bottle, it’s tiny manufacturer. label looks like done MS Paint blurred.

Is Oxford far along testing, fewer volunteers test on? Additionally, dietary supplements (like Vitamin B12) regulated FDA way food drugs are. Vitamin B12 Vitamin B12 it? guarantee FDA regulate balanced diet require supplements. much winning. South Dakota compares real time: NZ OZ great. I'm trying take that. 

But, Canada slow come around... they, like every non island nation (that can't keep people out, politically physically) crashing ... currently.

Be careful thinking somehow uts populations fault. 

This disease wildfire even vaccine. .. over. That’s really terrible, sad Alright.

Prove it. Bish. could even government intervention needed contain COVID absence lockdowns, that's Republican solution. listened him.

Instead denier country seems focus clean hands/surfaces.

Totally crazy.  government interfering free market communism understand saying TV-2 print article click-baity title masks work. read article though clear study refered proved masks protect others, wearing mask still protect around you.

When first read article sure anti-maskers gonna throw around, every danish media since criticized original article made clear wear mask help. hand, many people caught early likely re-exposed. Healthcare workers etc. overrepresented first wave even though careful then. They're still overrepresented now.

Also opposite true. know people fear virus precisely they've already it. * latest poll could find 2018, said 9% country anti-vaccine. That's bad, bad presenting as.

* amount people willing take vaccine going 50% October 58% week ago.

* Moncef Slaoui, head Operation Warp Speed, says vaccine free. Human nature, particularly comes people leaning towards right wing beliefs  think vast majority people chronic medical conditions praying death. would think opposite. already you’re much less likely get again. criticize Canada reddit.

The accurate data held within hospitals test centers often independent data collectors ulterior motive reliable collecting presenting data. Agreed. really shows little know origins circulating mutating least since early 2019 still found source. really know. missing 30 years data could circulating mutating humans 30 years recently mutated become deadly.

Yet we’ve never apart tell mother died yesterday stare them. others noted, UK island sense Japan is, one worst countries Earth right now. Japan one best records planet. Management mean perfection, harmful useless conflate two.

It's islands; policy. want range land locked countries low rates, take tour Africa, unless going try disqualify results due poverty, many do. perfection. Japan would lose additional 88,000 people poorly United states. They're great job. 


If spent time learning countries less time making excuses success, we'd much better spot. goes far pandemic. Legitimate question see asked. It’s discussed ton point trials vaccines, it’s said crazy side effects would seen now

Seriously, quit, ""good people' OK care, put dangerous situation knowing 1) much do, 2) end? sort independent research group, state serum institute CDC one signed try convince people pandemic real third wave.

No one signed told use bandana PPE intubations.

No one signed 80 hour weeks criminally inadequate staffing ratios.

No one signed endless onslaught sick people refuse take precautions health.

People quit jobs far less.

No doctor nurse take care you. 

Here’s something might able grasp, emergencies pandemic, nurse going rush hospital room give CPR dons full PPE, means things get really bad really quick there’s limited nursing staff limited PPE.

We protect doctors nurses, don’t many them, take long time make. actually one world's leading experts concept gaslighting, lately becoming less sure myself, less sure one world's middle-tier experts subject, almost like impostor. assume people caught coronavirus became careful recover, thus skewing numbers. Even immunity wanes completely month, see tens thousands reinfections. Fauci says done April - July latest. Lol... that's funny.  vote time last time. 

That take fact opponents almost crazy is.

Its Italian study somehow able twist shape express concern China?

Granted, study perfect, take lot one study figure thing originated, gonna dispute every study fit agenda, point?  stupid people crying “we wont covid restrictions” still understand way go back normal mass vaccination Long COVID difficult diagnose disease. strongly people like ME/CFS, psychosomatic element patient senses.

This going problematic, foresee people even years vaccinated saying still long COVID even without anything physically wrong them.

I every sympathy, making judgments. Long COVID complex condition. Fuzzy facial images. Sheriffs option, police not. thing, legally speaking.  Sheriffs tend much wider latitude police.  Sorry, misread comment Keep 100% American mindset Europe.  I'm emailing Sysco USFoods rep today notify boycott Tyson products, ask pass message higher-ups. encourage every Chef/KM/Owner same. Pork chicken cheap. Buy local, menu price, tell guests source locally. quality higher, people happy lose buck support local farmers. Tyson's first hate filled incident.

Alas, reason might think aging population bad economic system preference (capitalism) relies unlimited growth. pathetically enough, don’t even realize it’s benefit ultra-rich even yourself.

Anyway, don’t feel like chasing place shift goalposts. Later. death rate fraction countries. well even perfectly. ability recognize success without conflating perfection key. Sheriffs typically employees state, answerable electorate county. state superior. Lol I'm Healthcare try Really great article, thanks posting. 

This makes wonder: Right now, COVID-19 genome around 96 per cent compatible coronaviruses known animal hosts. that's close enough. equates around 30 years missing ""The key thing fill gap,"" says Holmes. ""Thirty-or-so years missing 'stuff'."" That’s excellent idea. possible China, country largest human population, almost 400 active cases covid virus? relapses, reinfections. article even provides evidence relapse.

We're still gathering evidence. expect mask cure too? Interesting, who’s “we?” 100%. I’ve Central lot recently (I live around Tsuen Wan work higher NT) wow, week didn’t realise warped — it’s two years since spent majority time it’s weird seeing NT experience. 

That said matter part HK I’m still feel safer UK back May. Certainly panicking getting bus... damned do, damned situation True. really can't get much worse far cases though think hospitalizations keep increasing yet. 

I keep imagining older grandparents nobody seen since since last Christmas Thanksgiving they're going see again. They've lock year pressure see loved ones, they'll go visit. Obvious issues study serious risk individuals (overweight smokers) study identified COVID asymptotic. whomever paid report seemed forgotten tidbit Covid. 
It’s common issue forged documents. paper needs independent verification. They’re going find similar blood samples elsewhere test, samples could contaminated Covid RNA. 

China anything prove Covid outbreak didn’t occur China. look they’ve done trade relationship Australia following Australia’s suggestion international investigation Covid outbreak occurred. 

The political climate result Covid breakout event changed nature tone Communications coming China concerning. responsibility = everyone else it! ~ Murica Ignore hive mind here. It’s absolutely infuriating. read to. money quote

 ""It could take years possible might never find it,"" lmao  local leaders sadly get either. wanted general strike earlier year. one chance get something done amidst chaos get 51% effectiveness probably going wait cases make sure real seeing effectiveness. going difficult get read prevelant virus areas (outside hospitalizations ICU admissions) testing capacity reached many areas. Cases level percent positive naturally increase. tough one. one people said ""why would tell us wear masks real reason needed save masks medical personnel?"" we're ten months ordeal America, China full year in... I'm sure specific, added clause mask messaging would made ton difference. We're point [governors refusing mask (Nebraska) issuing say [""I want (Iowa),[""you believe work (North Dakota), [having sheriffs refuse (Florida) Hell, we've [mayor say mandate masks unless Holy Spirit told (Tennessee).

&amp;#x200B;

So yeah, I'm sure American CDC said March April: ""we want general public panic buy masks we're facing severe shortage right need preserve available masks healthcare personnel frontline workers"", would've gotten much mask compliance. certainly think that's Major Misstep collective pandemic response here. think North South Dakota hit testing limits vs actually growth curve plateau. could worth adding 19 deaths reported today distributed 10 different dates past 3 weeks: I'll wait Spring front liners elderly get first.

wont really choice, definitely waiting lol Maybe Sturgis gasoline fire middle field full tinder? put people stressful situations, give immoral orders people command, they're either going quit start justifying they're greater good. start justifying it, morality crumbles every new step. beds taken covid pt there's usually two room normal pt, likely put pt room themself covid. effectively reduces capacity unit half.

Now imagine heart attack pt pulmonary embolism acute health need bed needed taken billy joe thought covid democratic hoax masks pussies. chances good outcomes compared covid gonna decrease dramatically. 

It's covid pt gonna suffer here. 

Hopefully frequent flyer weekly doses vitamin Dilaudid turkey Sammies take break get space Small nit. 1,923 people die yesterday. died past weeks reported yesterday. Ohio 7 day rolling averages one week apart? mean look many Americans get MLMs Christ’s sake. Faith bad reasoning skills lead lot folks astray. What's worse still believe there's pandemic conspiracy political gains. Yep, started emailing. give shit exactly want. goes sides aisle. Get bill passed.   tell people they're making stuff up, irritant.

The agricultural meat industry implicitly tied coronavirus. industrialised China, mean lack ethics towards animals didnt come bite us back. office thing May. We’ve shut almost month since positive tests office. actually work home policy company office ignores for... reasons. ok consumers really get choice meds. can't *shop around* prescription I'm basically mercy whatever pharmacy I'm using. Marking Hand Sanitizer though pandemic also bad viewed scummy opportunistic. Tons people problem something overpriced always overpriced. 

Insulin great example. *always been* overpriced means many diabetic either know care hand sanitizer going thing everyone see. Neither ok get things like instant check Amazon cause buy something overpriced screwing you. 38% Redditors. Lol. life, besides worrying family, basically changed. go work, go home, play video games wife, chill cats. give fuck believe, nobody. That's near impossible. adverse complications happen third week injection. “Europe epicentre pandemic, together United States. light end tunnel six tough months,” Kluge told news conference, speaking Copenhagen.

“Lockdowns avoidable, stand position lockdowns last resort measure. Mask use means panacea, needs done combination measures. However, mask use reached 95%, lockdowns would needed.”

Lockdowns lifted safely gradually, added, warning negative impact ‘easing quickly’. cleaners run stuff called vital oxide, use everywhere sprayers.

I pray agent orange 10 years. guys need understand people using convincing words like unlikely, simply means arent sure cant tell that.

How possible know contagious virus 4 months since pandemic started wuhan. agree americans europeans probably know much way donoesnt know it.

If conspiracy theory influenced chinese government possible downplayed importance mask china stock continue ramp production.

Local governments tried downplaying importance mask could reserve front liners supplies depleted chinese nationals living around world sending back family friends january til march.

Same telling people food supplies stable, avoid panic buying. people realize kept calling wolf, people stopped believing them, even started telling truths. Yes. love studies control group. rise depression mental illness infected? guess, given Pandemic, same. fact, might depressed infected deal stuff prevent COVID even though , thus, preventative steps make life worse provide real benefit. Yup Canada here, crazy old parents can’t wait get Florida year... care live Canada. fully supportive everybody trashing country. way pandemic.

A way crippled economy.

A way depression epidemic social distancing caused.

A way lockdowns reverted children teens back diapers.

A way illness killing millions people.

But y' know, continue demonizing scientists legally allowed lie finding vaccine. practice really stop, especially states willful ignorance strategy. 

""We accept rules made outside state. We're independent free here!""

""Oh wait, fucked up, everyone else sacrifice save us.""

Fuck off, Dakotas. chose know-knothingism, get bailed consequences. Placebo effect. 

Certain people corporate offices undoubtly know can't scrub safety. However, they're banking ignorance general population. March every heard ""IT LIVES 24 HOURS SURFACES"" heard nothing else. know this. call senators every single damn day say need help aid. Well that's good point considered. 

I thinking ""38% assholes!"", might like 33% assholes 5% recluses.  idea. People seem surprised effective mRNA vaccines though. point talking making Manditory enter certain public spaces. talking knocking people's door forcibly injecting Yep. know someone super vigilant social distancing mask wearing going fly see family holidays always do. Hypocrisy big problem pandemic. give dollar value experience, covid test work (unpaid) week waited results. lost around $900 wages owe $200 covid test hospital (after insurance lol). told, right thing getting tested, lost $1100 personally.

This untenable majority America, even wanted adhere safety precautions. bought state fair corn dogs :( seeing read either post understand, obviously no. know mean. someone live visit result death uneeded elongation pandemic. 

Again, justify want, trash. IDGAF shitty opinions virus' side. There’s reason different races ethnic groups different behaviors customs (obviously) ethnic racial group different health concerns
What works White America work Hispanic Chinese America makes sense Yeeep. Snowbirds flocking down. fun that. We’ve already there. I'm not. Get facts FDA bias-media. 

The FDA cut corners approve something fully reviewed/vetted phase 3 trial lasts 2 years monitoring. Read process. Dr. Fauci doctors tried tell public year, despite political nature used, FDA/CDC/NIH saying, count vaccine well 2021 even 2022--a vaccine save us pandemic quoted saying media/press. sample 300-500 patients representation ideal society (which phase 3 trial consisting 5000-10000 patients). 300-500 patients usually picked good health.

SOURCE: order issue EUA (Emergency Use Authorization) Investigational New Drug (IND), FDA requires sponsor submission minimum: local government-level authorization granted FDA EUA given place sponsor review medical criteria warranting need emergency use.  simpler terms, doctors prescribe vaccine approved EUA special conditions identified need emergency save person's life health. OR, even broader terms, get vaccine unless ICU. means able go Walgreens Walmart get COVID vaccine FDA fully approved drug longer  kind point study. Reality is, majority always wear masks correctly. point study mask wearing works real life scenarios, usage perfect. pump, bro.

They’re violating state Covid capacity requirements plants offices, since beginning. slapped wrist minuscule fine handling Covid, absolutely meaningless nothing. It’s terrible industry can’t wait it. Guess official going next chopping block? Sad! That’s weird. It’s upside me. Thank god. I’ve sweating last 2 months People die nurses strike. There's got better way. know plenty people aren’t antimaskers per day ditch way easier should. think they’re good job, partly they’re sanitizing washing normal either bad recruiting luck, vaccine could less effective...in case they'll need people get Covid highly effective RNA vaccines 90%) needed to.

That seems unlikely. got 200 infections, 100 control group 100 vaccine group, would take longer (and probably less time) 200 control 100 vaccine.

They may different thresholds and/or different compositions group members (i.e., would severe cases easily detectable cohort older people regularly exposed group younger people highly compliant regulations able work home), and/or subjects may countries lower prevalence trials. would like know too?
Mina said waiting FDA approval remember correctly holdup due FDA worried able track data (which probably reason newly approved one requires prescription ) also worried people testing positive quarantining themselves..which also happens anyway PCR test. 

The cheap instant saliva test could really game changer hope approve soon. 

This one requires $50 machine costs $5 test. vegetarian years /r/vegancirclejerk turned vegan day hehe

Edit: Don’t look you’ll become vegan assuming everyone died icu “I’m going job, make completely impossible.” ...

Do really think continue living like 5 years? really think continue fucking economy, mental health, children's development, millions COVID-19 victims 5 years? delaying it, going approval process.

OR, even broader terms, get vaccine unless ICU. means able go Walgreens Walmart get COVID vaccine FDA fully approved drug longer know. Back spring, people agreed eventually 60-70% Americans eventually getting infected COVID-19 (much like infected colds.) issue time mortality rate alleged 2-3%. know false even 1%. would looking 3.3 Americans. problem dying relative old - average age death 82 something like people applying mortality rate across entire population saying worse flu. Well, get techinical flu bad old people much COVID numbers based demographics starting come higher comparable flu.

But, know essentially age 65 (including co-morbidities) mortality rate .02-.05% give take. 65, mortality rate mix depending co-morbidities (and here's shock old people tend co-morbidities) age. older higher rate. think 80 mortality rate 5%. Sounds awful realize comparable flu 80s. One reasons widespread vaccinations nursing homes fall.

As exposure. website fairly liberal model HIT shows immunity rates per state. Texas 26% HI rate. far estimate. That's I'm hanging ""NO BREATHING"" sign shop. Came say nobody uses epidural syringes give vaccines. way, hopeful effective vaccine soon. healthcare workers begging help painful watch. entirely relevant comparing life Mozambique life USA. Americans quick conclude countries worse USA, equally critical country.

Look sarcasm “like Mozambique soooooo much better USA”. sarcasm poster thinks notion ridiculous.

That sense American Exceptionalism America drowning pandemic. entirely relevant. Hospital pharmacist here. know guys put BS deal daily. shitty patients (sometimes literally 😅) overbearing management nurse seems like sucks ass.

Where think go next?

Quick edit: always telenurse jobs think about. Phone calls boring hell lot safer. small group socially distances outside eat food brought trash? Dang, sorry hear that. 15 days dry ice shipping box 5 days regular freezer. 

It's concern may hiccups beginning figure out. black plague plague. overly dramatic Source? havent seen anything support genuinely curious hear something first time start hearing everywhere shortly after? look back, really crazy think prepared country handle pandemic. I'm talking leadership either, I'm talking everybody including citizens. think back past pandemics like swine flu stuff realize incredibly lucky extremely contagious like one thing probably would happened. really ticking timebomb. Meanwhile countries face viruses like time knew exactly citizens seem mostly board used it. actually really sad think deadly disease bring us closer together, actually opposite everything got politicized. hope next time happens (and will) Americans much mentally prepared do. Like I'm honestly shocked looking back used flu season. would seriously get sick show work anyways go store mask anything flu kills ton people every year. Yes, agree, adorable safe time! 100% this. ""No COVID treatment available. asked left alone handle own."" completely ignorant topic posting nonsense kill people. Worked Kroger. insist, trained say no, insist take it. Honestly pay usually bit minimum wage worked tipping mandatory person bringing groceries got well taken care worked. 

Generally insist twice, feel bad actually pretty easy part job pack things away. RemindMe! 3 weeks Hello fellow Gritty. Stay safe there, it’s get _ugly_. news; we’ve known start, don’t need leaked bs headline tell us we’ve living dying much expected 
With aid sight president probably deal civil unrest increase crime. Plus many people leave labor market together hot spots regional, allowing resources shifted. map.

Yep, politicians seem wait ICUs overflowing freezer trucks filling proper thing. do, even say wouldn‘t, there‘s literally option left prevent people dying streets. It’s like summer again, except it’s going WAY worse Wow, fucking shit! I'm shocked! curious, physical screening get administered shot one day?

Welp, found one video specific brand showing good quality. However, I'm sure methods. Anyone idea Dongguan Youzheng face mask co? Oxford's vaccine undergoing phase 3 trials UK Brazil, right?  Population fatality rate. Unfortunately, area, specifically reopening bars, gyms, clubs, beaches restaurants, holiday seasons summer (memorial day, fourth july, labor day), acting incredulous people came flooding spike virus afterward. Nope, standard ""I'm bored, let's generate content"" evil ripped straight Eve Online.  obvious solution? god. Imagine fucking consequences. people dying less trust health care system. Yeah that’d really help. sub ridiculous. Luckily health care workers immature kids, know better something directly indirectly harmful. murder already happening government officials nothing.

Doctors nurses strike.

They've done already planned across globe.
In UK, order be:

-people care homes people work them
-medics, nurses, doctors, etc
-the immunocompromised everyone 80+
-Everyone 75+
-65+
-60+
-etc

But thats governments claim, pans change remember, thousands millions Americans losing homes soon Mitch McConnell wanted protect people law suits.  let's say white cop shoots black guy refused wear mask pulled gun it. well think going play media? People rioted past months cops shot known felons firing time.   response got effectively doubling down, you’re correct. No, water vapor makes aerosol evaporates eventually. particle can't become aerosolized without presence water vapor. think liquid spray bottle landing top surface virus enough create aerosol nothing. Think difference Windex bottle Febreeze 

Also take account physics surface tension, way beyond knowledge good discussion r/covid19 it. gathered, aerosols double-edged swords; travel further, that's lightweight compared droplet, smaller, delicate, carry fewer virus particles, leading lower viral load someone gets infected. would closing gas stations help? think average time transaction gas station? 3 minutes? essential workers drive work?

And mandate deal parties, literally bans social gatherings people different households establishes fines rule breakers. brain wash us nursing school think profession noble worth sacrificing safety for. sick. prepare us advocate ourselves, patients. Mysoginistic roots female dominated profession. You’re still baselessly concluding surface transmission “rare” Dallas probably next. county judge pressing issue rightfully Also keep mind antibody tests well PCR useless counting total infections, within 3 months start disappear. fine hospital diagnosis show trend, valueless counting many people Covid. Technically, that's Wal-Mart's problem first. Then, can't take care it, need call local police. allow it, Keith Ellison need sue Wal-Mart abiding governor's orders. sued businesses already that.

Consider ideas like asking RN's stay contact local press giving frequent interviews. Take pictures (without violating HIPAA) 'leak' press. Maybe ask local volunteers help move deceased morgues, help digging graves. let deceased die vain. Tyson Foods, reminding company mission statements core value statements absolutely useless.

""Who are:

• strive company diverse people working together produce food.

• strive honorable people.

• strive faith-friendly company."" one saying you. Read headline read said. Morons. Tell 250,000 dead country 

Oh wait can’t they’re dead. people like Cool knowing people pay billions subsidies to, barely pay taxes, betting many us get sick/die making rich. Cool society. Nothing wrong here. irony calling someone idiot sentence “didn’t hurt nobody life” thick. 

Also, compared attitude toward human life Stalin’s, body count. Stalin share view value human lives. That’s simple. ashamed.

From able discern rest incoherent rambling, gather you’re person spends lot time “African.”  do, assure people Africa do, fact, bat eye fellow human beings die. fail to, Stalin did, that’s you. them. burglary.

Home invasion.

There’s fucking difference. know...I feel like excusing kind thinking/behavior many people cognitive deficits bit stretch. seems literally can't understand virus transmits, probably can't understand enough life general allowed handle affairs. obviously people fine. 

I think psychological flaws intellectual ones. one area, I'm pretty sure quite restricted. (certainly state...)

Again, quite local. one neighbors works charity matches SNAP benefits fresh foods. charity. ""Double food bucks"" name program. may similar program state/area.

Good luck! :) better manufacturing facilities cranking many possible starting yesterday. Doesn’t mean vaccine useless? doesn’t sound true considering majority Americans don’t go gym guess, mean history Thalidomide, whereas america didnt approve wanted testing. curiosity, question? Completely deadly. rural Ohio, I’m still seeing lot people say it’s worse flu 99.97% survival rate. would say least 1/3 thinks acting like it’s cold. infected worker restaurant. say anywhere surface transmission? know you’re joking case somebody sees really concerned gym closing I’ve found good substitute fitness bags fill sand home pull bar. Let’s also push narrative good person.

It wasn’t robbery. home invasion.

Where got 6 fucking months.

Let’s pretend 6 months “fair” punishment home invasion.

The irony is, doesn’t get released actually gets time DESERVED child never born abused. symptoms? think I’m finally mostly recovered. Sense smell took forever return. Chest tightness same.

The brain fog hasn’t entirely lifted. It’s seven months. beyond shocked Pikachu. would thought It’s BAU here. Bars packed shoulder shoulder weekends masks sight, there’s chin diapers galore places masks required, contact tracing absolutely abysmal. It’s mess here. high infection rates absolutely indicative laissez-faire attitude absolutely everyone has. I’ll admit, I’m highly liberal absolutely believe COVID needs controlled lack “taking seriously” rub cases catch myself. still feels like we’re middle pandemic - sometimes - even news agencies got bored COVID news started focusing things. It’s mess here. No. US never quarantined travelers 2 weeks supervised housing. lockdown NYC worked hard months, low transmission rates 1%. started increasing past weeks. trump photo, itd unlikely. Christmas going DISGUSTING. Tourists going give damn. used (silently) chuckle people would wear mask city Chinatown area. realize idiot along smart ones looking rest us. Shame laughing them.

You'll never catch mocking anybody wears mask long live ever again. Even go somewhere I'm sick plan wearing one. I'll making sure future children feel stigma masks either. Many fellow Americans naïve selfish stupid. really shame people still ignore facts president like Donald Trump belittles pandemic expect. likely early vaccine candidates tested antibodies vaccinated order maximize number people unable contract strain virus? think likely they'll say ""ok, we're vaccinating healthcare workers, moving next group"" speed rollout vaccine? Bring neighbor like... I’m worried they’ll never take plexiglass down. Makes sad.  meant say “A new president emerged“ Let’s bet money much jail time get Well voted Biden Trump like 69% 28% teton county. doesn’t matter wear anyway! Articles statements like causing confusion making people feel it’s necessary! shut nation this? must missed that.

Please show Trump ordered national shutdown. Please show governors 50 states ordered states shutdown time. That's ""ordered"" mandatory, voluntary, suggested, ""ordered"" force law. long voluntary, many it. Meaning shutdown.

The polio response local shutdowns ordered. like did. done calculations.


Covid-19 spread respiratory droplets.


Blocking respiratory droplets masks slows spread infection.


Avoiding people may exhaling covid slows spread infection.



Snowflakes feelings matter. Interesting. Thanks sharing!

edit: modular...that cool. cool. supports right repair movement see. Excuse me! Golfing something. look see much plateauing cases might flattening due testing Except point history abuses ""temporary"" powers never temporary. Pollyanna, literally overly trusting, prepared face cold hard truth humans way seek power one another. government 1800 US vastly different today due continued usurpation power. one event line many such. History. Learn it. TN here, angry feel like crazies (including “highly qualified” governor) trapping people right thing using critical thinking. would love could leave home without feeling like I’m entering COVID forest fire alas leaders cowards. Totally spitballing here, think that, Covid deniers, accepting Covid reality actually competes *another* survival instinct, instinct perform accordance social group’s norms. 

Acknowledging reality Covid means rejecting acceptance, support, protection social group, decided unit believe Covid fake. 

So, they’re deathbeds told they’re dying something they’ve made social pact deny, creates problem. 

This armchair psychoanalysis anyway. countries willing distribute dangerous ineffective medicine population. things America. try positive, like anything MUH FREEEDDOOOMMSSS

Right ! confused assume much one short comment. taking quick look comment history made sense — it’s you’re bit arsehole. Sorry that, must annoying live life you. rural OK, first surge. really hit corners like Tulsa OKC. came 9 months later expected hitting hard Trump supporting idiots actually shocked people know dying. Yet STILL go casino, bf required work there's literally nothing else, guests wear masks (and don't, 'not real' )and old chick walks says ""Well, got tested today, friend died it, believe that? cough got tested we'll see"" ONE SAY ANYTHING HER, stand pray bring home.  
There's test kits left, rural counties access kits since august unless they're ill going doctor also believe big deal hell not. like damn twilight zone reality taken back seat. even hear cough zoom, I'm outta there. Who's going first get see turn Captain America? make good points. sure mask one though. I’ve seen many reports those. Lol literally good response ? blows mind could sacrifice infinitesimal amount freedom TEMPORARILY curb virus literally return normal 

Good luck mental gymnastics bro *Pikachu shocked* Yes proposed months back. get vaccination certificate. Without cant utilize public transport public facilities. also get charged extra medical fees get virus, also pay insurance premiums. Private business also right deny service. anyone know would take two weeks? review 24/7 job now?  functioning government? fantasy speak of? Yeah...and determines crime? State. authority lies. States States. understand that? Civics class? authority lies States. I'm willing abandon system emergency. flaws one, must best deal WITHIN system. called conspiracy theorists... UV light also helps break protective casing viral RNA, helps ""kill"" it. process varies depending UV ray strength, location, latitude, etc, ""kill"" virus little 7-20 minutes. 

So plus extra ventilation outdoors makes outdoor spread far less likely. impossible tell oversensitive beginning end infection. true someone late illness, still ""weakly"" tests positiv PCR ist probably infectious anymore. someone early stages might also barely test positive infectious day two later. I'm actually curious branches military this. automatically disqualify certain types duty service together?

Will regular job market screen potentially discriminate you? long term effects may able diagnosed. locked South Australia 17 cases. understand things clean surfaces use alcohol wipes doorknobs handles. also wear mask Yea sounds right. yesterday, friends showed increasingly bad numbers said “I don’t want another lock down.” Well, 1. last time could stand home kids 2. took caution now, could eliminate huge shutdown. stop gathering inside groups wear masks. Ma’am! yea overzealous bots got me. another comment said I’ve said antimaskers public removed fãkė news. You’re welcome. hope gets better. Yes. I’ve several therapists psychiatrists it. rare neurological condition came come virus, kind fucked I’m scared getting sick. I’m way better OCD used be, pandemic kind brought steps backwards. think lack understanding jow herd immunity works. everyone risk get vaccine. Furthermore, everyone gets vaccine vaccine ne effective. need many people possible receive vaccine help can't work for.

You're advocating increased harm Covid-19 spiteful. goes effective lockdown. Governors cannot control right back 5 month. Except hope vaccine. Military... Nurses... Doctors.... like every job. good comes bad. 

People become angry... stupid... arrogant, virus, they'vebeen way. 

If prepared deal shifty people (that shitty centuries) pick career deal them.

The nice people still nice.... ? Outing burden medical personal make decision ridiculous. 
 
Ok sure! I’ll let patients die today save lives road unreasonable decision ask medical personnel make (also illegal immoral) think they’re reporting triggers immune response older people. It’s really big deal since vulnerable. along cruelty animals insane amount pollution Tyson reason everyone boycotting awful company.

Mixed people told considered black treated long time. leads strict whiteness non-strict blackness shared experience history evolved along lines. one cares 30% black 100% black, still gonna sit back bus. Congress doesn’t pass kind economic backstop support unemployed small businesses close permanently lockdown? I’m glad he’s destroying livelihoods Florida. 

Reminder. Unemployment running out. eviction moratorium running out. Restaurants (the economic lifeblood Florida economy) survive another lockdown. Luckily eat outside Florida.

Sorry.


Yes, US saying healthcare workers *first*. rest first responders, front line workers, think. concurrently ""vulnerable"" elderly - move 60 65. heard 70 article. Businesses complain louder, particularly absence coherent Federal plan fund winter.

Sends message, least. Probably better post kind comment first place, rather accidentally people interpret attitude ""don't care, yummy!"". obviously aware, vegan despise industrial meat production. Yeah, shook. Solway displaying zero chill here. You’re problem. Edit: can't believe make edit but... /s

It's 2020. internet full people actually belief, trolls, bots. Science? Statistics?  don’t see upside photo. blind? champ, arguing tard doesnt realize figures/studies help us visualize ANYTHING


but that, way try comprehend us. 


your math checks out, see well outcomes line bit


dont argue stupid, comes studies like these, almost always half assed, futile, gotta something funding right!  Please love God let work. wanna able celebrate birthday spring able high school experience. lazy ass journalism. already written million times! 

“Mixing households &lt;fill blank poses substantial risks.”

Just change words, hit SUBMIT you’re done! Ooh, even better! /s semi-final round Corona Wars, Minnesota shuts bars, restaurants, gyms. NYC closes...schools.

Advantage: Minnesota. Ugh, you’re right. It’s like Qult going away trump office. I’m sure it’s part 4d chess expose secret satanists. They're awful. forced day work spend family. ethical consumption capitalism :)  holiday season also worrying. State local officials attribute part current spike “Halloween hangover,” resulting parties gatherings people attended end October. Public health experts state officials say things may worsen flurry travel expected next six weeks, including college students returning New York places higher infection rates. Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo predicted “tremendous spike Thanksgiving.” anti-vaccine anti-misinformation task force? 

This task force desperately needs grammarian it! stage, point mandate, anyway? People know masks work already continue use them. People ""against masks"" (*jesus fucking christ, America*) wear properly purpose. state soft mandate, *can* get fined, people area anti mask purposely wear nose like kind protest.  mean difference making vaccine mandatory vs. making requirement activity could least theory avoided, might sound like small distinction big difference. 

I think completely OK mandate vaccination school, travel whatever (to point almost person would choose take choice merely theoretical). 

And also think, time, would totally wrong make mandatory. makes massive difference, line government cross, one injecting people things will. also infected 5G surprised store brand also Tyson product. like Walmart runs meat processing plant. Fuck; speaks nuts situation elsewhere, simply care much Florida insane.

Kinda like house fire hear crazy uncle breaking stuff shed.

You're distantly aware ultimately lot concerned damned house. way make sense markets necessarily rational short term. They’re unpredictable nature else bozo Reddit could get feeling go make millions.

Clearly markets going face pandemic massive economic damage. aren’t. may while. knows. could see bear market midst economic boom. stock market isn’t economy, period. sense reading much short term due irrational nature. I'm praising him. He's awful. think quicker vaccine cost lives good way go. I'm simply stating tripped able call vaccine effective quickly due mismanagement situation. soft-core anti-vaxxers

wtf even means, opposition anti-vaxxers really turning irrational scientism. desirable open discussion necessity different vaccines, possible short long-term health risks pharmaceutical industry. eating exploiting animals cause outbreaks, heart disease, stroke? New York shutting schools, keeping businesses open? Despite fact schools less vector spreading covid? 

I guess says lot American priorities. Indoor dining bars need shut down. Especially holiday travel. doubt people going bars in-town guests spreading virus place. 

I truly feel sorry restaurant owners workers area society tolerate strangers congregating maskless hours end talk loudly? They'll getting vaccinated time next week Well, shut indoor dining, bars, gyms instead schools...they could probably avoid longer, altogether. know bastards paid either. they're getting ppl killed. /s? Oh absolutely, everyone equally bad it. excess deaths 4 times official death toll really bad, basically Ecuador level, rest EU 1.1 - 1.5 general people consider summer conditions winter conditions subjective too. Brisbane relatively large cluster late winter, London relatively low case numbers late summer. first glance might seem confirm season theory realise August averages cities couple degrees different. study say anything masks source control. efficiency masks source control shown number studies. purely studies masks protections measure wearer. I'm looking forward putting r/confidentlyincorrect 3 weeks generally eat grass-fed red meat, mainly free-range chicken wild-caught fish. toxic crap feed farmed animals alone keeps away, let alone quality life animals horrendous. Living pacific northwest I've seen lot amazing farms let animals roam. Large farms. research brand that's usually selling meat local grocery store see operate. Sadly body hates one too. Usually stick chicken/turkey veg beans, brussels, broccoli (and others). Link? Best boycott meat general. Going vegetarian boycotting factory farm system easier way avoid Tyson products. last name Uke I'm assuming West African. Elaborate first and/or middle names common region, like former Nigerian President Goodluck Johnathan. would never imagined that'd strong enough person hold onto false beliefs even death bed thing deny. 

I guess serious thing. I've seen multiple articles people struggling near final breath, using breath claim [archive link anyone trouble accessing article US people pulled guns knifes even physically assaulted retail workers asking wear masks. People literally murdered it. Unless want police officers stationed every single retail store cops enforce mandate really great option. non-masker going show eventually every store. also going see situations police officers end shooting someone refuses wear mask. That's going happen. people going pull gun retail worker this, they'll try police officer well. pull gun police officer, they're going shoot you. Nope. Australia bigger size China? sure that?

Even pack entire population 26 million single city, population density many cities India, China, Korea Japan. mention Australia near level international travel comparing US, western Europe China. geography Australia's side battling pandemic. Resource.. capital invest, resources use. imagine uproar tried US phase 3 since like August. taking long publish? Powerful accurate analogy. Highly unlikely hear anything better today. indoor dining bars still thing right? Makes literally zero scientific sense. Maskless people talking loudly confirmed space strangers relatively close obvious source spread. anti-maskers spreading us wearing protecting assholes can't protect ourselves. extrapolation based know spread. Think weddings we're hearing half people attend become infected. takes one infected person room, breathing virus spores air, contaminate air whole room less hour.   guess I'm going wait general population.

I assume 60s critical health issues.

If so, ahead whippersnappers 50s, behind ancient 70 80+ year olds countries. 

Some countries also focus exposure due jobs (e.g., transport retail workers) rather vulnerable. shutting now. universities going prevent students leaving? French Revolution, American War Independance, bombing Nagasaki Hiroshima... assert violence never answer naive. means first line offense, powers country shown invested human life, individual agency stewarding planet us. 

Know history, nations high weath inequality, indifferent political class isolated plight normal people head towards collapse. conditions conspire leave peasants sense ""what got lose? taking everything else us."" 

The GOP digging heels progressive policies, like Green New Deal, meaningful legislation start address climate change leave younger generations political ability prioritize security entire planet. Mitch McConnel died old age fisheries collapse (not shocking food supply, crippling livelyhoods process). young people today, children right facing sustained environmental crisis threaten existance, people capable making difference actively working opposite direction.  Back around April similar take it, i.e. culture simply experienced situation.

Since then, however, danger unmistakable people simply bothered. Also, large numbers people here, majority, care followed scientists' guidelines. So, two points alone would argue saying. Thanksgiving Christmas really seems like power combo.

They’re *the* two family gathering events year, family gathers basically impossible stop via government intervention. they’re month apart, meaning take couple weeks see results thanksgiving (plus lag time deaths/hospitalizations) even less time react. Plus plans already made people follow inertia.

There’s basically zero chance don’t see large thanksgiving spike huge recent surge been, followed insane spike Christmas.

It’s going take lockdowns recover that. doubt.  Agree - I'm sure it, close alternatives, soon extremely affordable free grant. 

 
Ultimately good news. Even takes weeks/month clear. Wow one wonky “I hate Trump, &lt;Trump supporting posts. It’s bizarre see it... wonder you’re actually bot person actually typed hit post. It’s totally absurd.

Trump discouraged mask use throughout pandemic. disastrous publicly wearing supporting mask use, could untold influence culty followers. Study study shown universal mask compliance reduce community spread 70% more.

Trump made jokes pandemic publicly recommending people inject bleach try clean lungs UV light.

He hired Scott Atlas Coronavirus Task Force, spew nonstop propaganda covid restrictions.

He publicly urged states covid restrictions “rise up” liberate.

Even outside rhetoric policy decisions devastating. Trump states left bidding critical ppe. direct orders, party blocked much needed stimulus bill, time 12MM Americans lose unemployment.

Many public health officials made crystal clear pandemic could brought control proper leadership helm. Yes side would listened science could concerts stadiums right hadn’t won.

And everyone knows that’s hugely LOST landslide. honest, relapse would worrying reinfection would imply could hide immune system cause longer term effects like TB, syphilis, HIV, chicken pox etc.

Whereas reinfection could mean slightly different version virus body takes slightly time get rid of. little awkward. Ohmigosh ! I'm first year pre-med student, although I've always wanted doctor since kid , feel like whole pandemic made even determined become one. article says testing 90% efficient last week, yesterday updated 95% hour hour definitely two weeks. two days Moderna reported 94% efficient. 

They're competing supply much respective vaccine possible They're going throw highest number possible gain trust. outrageous think two competing pharmaceutical companies going make money. Thank you! 4 times, 14-16k excess vs bit 3k reported covid deaths time period. undercount might bit lower assume significant lag death reporting, like Spain Sweden, would still massive.  personal income tax Florida. dependent companies making money paying state taxes, specifically tourist industry. People slowly stop won’t common within decade ridiculous comment. Getting coronavirus mean deserve die. wrong you? Almost one sub-Saharan Africa 40, due extreme population growth last decades.
HIV also prevalent, know makes difference hyper-inflammatory response. college 18yo attends - testing going home testing returning. I'd really prefer stay home spring semester resumes, class meets person. 

Her older sister goes college testing everyone (students, profs, staff) twice week. told students stay put Thanksgiving, travel. sternly worded letter sent last week reminding (and parents, sent us, too) Thankgiving travel part deal person classes. Red Giving... Thanks want stock market panic, like get freakin’ act together!? public messaging horrible. Sure, lockdown avoidable given number factors.

But communities absolutely need lockdowns point, comment used oppose fully.

A months ago said asymptomatic transmission - meant hard evidence yet. 

Stop tossing soundbites muddle message. technically true nuanced construct make good public policy!! Even 0.001% chance wearing mask provides wearer protection, it’s still worth it. It’s criminal. Pretty much, moved money bonds case goes bad return might well nothing point. depressing. lot people forced position keeping water home means things perpetuate spread sucks. Stay safe! 1-2/10 people don’t wear masks respect social distancing.... current numbers make sense  Thanks lot answer! also wondering, time ago doctors suggested could become endemic like flu. good reports lately regarding hypothesis?
And congrats maintaining sub!! Wisconsin, “HAVE COURTS OVERTURN EVERY SINGLE ONE GOVERNOR’S MITIGATION EFFORTS!!” might situations, general. 

Imagine near fan. Everyone's contaminated air flowing though space way room. creating churn air large rooms achieve negative pressure sufficient flow help, 6 feet far enough space anymore breath flying 20 feet short order, everything louder there's huuuuge fan.

Negative pressure also means sucking potentially contaminated air door, room, make unit exhausting. get air changes exchange turbulent air, rental unit shoved window, engineered solution. works asbestos people inside protected PPE (sometimes gown, always mask), fan meant prevent asbestos drifting elsewhere building contaminating environment, protect workers.

Building-level HVAC room air changes hour, MERV13+ filters getting hard find, people upgrading better filtration changing often. good filtering, engineered balanced give diffuse air space. adjusted systems air changes per hour, even though less energy-efficient.

They help, they're fix, especially air people exchanged whichever filter they're close close air intake. Yeah one nurse one day. think would worth it. Here's neighbor, name Rona. Enjoy! fire say otherwise! Imagine social credit gets deducted everytime didnt wear mask outside home, sneeze public, forgot wash hands using bathrooms. would fully comply too. electoral strategy. Oh, sucks. cases rising go indoors least people take seriously, someone unmasked downright rarity. People get fatigued everywhere least feels like members community taking seriously.

Stay safe! Yes, meat protein bio available depending individual’s intestinal efficacy absorption (medications, disease, poor gut health, etc) also people struggle convert beta carotene vitamin A, that’s causes real crash folks quit vegan. ok vegan diets awhile, crash, omnivores millennia. need meat every day, no. generally don’t thrive without it. It’s like feeding pets wrong nutrition, catches eventually. Basic biology. &amp; that’s found affair. I'm vegetarian never even entertained thought, listening someone claim vegetarian eat 2 entire cows year fucking hilarious. really expect onboard you, points extremely well articulated clearly correct saying. 

Moral story; union largely independent states governed independently possible avoid tyranny massive power heavily centralized ceded all-powerful, authoritarian Fed. free live whatever state choose. choose live states majority people consistently vote best interests (it irrelevant own, right.) issues really matter pinch. Real estate may cheaper may entice particular job market natural beauty... decision based principles... choose greed ignorance stuck living choice push comes shove. pushing shoving starts majority morons decided surround turn suicidal/homicidal maniacs. 

They call “democracy”... also call “the tyranny majority”... imperative understand must accept latter risk maintain former.  I'm happy hear people educating viruses. Working manufacturer disinfectants, reality day talking COVID-19. confusing though people explaining difference N list kill claims are. Canada went say, ""AFTER people vaccinated, course. maybe year"". No. 

Vaccines stronger longer-lasting immunity infection. Plus, people get booster shots. lifelong ""free"" healthcare

I'm extremely pessimistic virus, believe people like users subreddits normalized draconian lockdowns ""ordinary measure"" combat infectious diseased. Worst pandemic since 1918, fear next time see something like Swine Flu, gonna ""lock there's vaccine"" nonsense. experts Europe want wait bit longer get accurate data

To clear, threshold submission already set/met Pfizer, nobody waiting ""get accurate data"".

They study blind study results show effects vaccine versus placebo. could wait longer ""get data"" efficacy, really need - results far overwhelming (almost one got vaccine got COVID after, many got placebo did) near impossible chalk random chance.

If talking safety - well, people getting vaccine 6 months. someone going develop serious condition result vaccine, probably would happened. possible (though very, unlikely) vaccine could cause weird cancer 30 years, that's case, know 30 years. could wait see conditions manifest 6-12 months vaccine administered, odds probably even less likely 30 year cancer risk.

The delay point validating data getting data. data submitted is. study over. regulatory authorities need review make sure Pfizer wrong/lying, they're delaying collect data. one source, there's more:

SACRAMENTO — California lawmakers flew conference Maui amid pandemic broke silence controversy Wednesday, defending trip calling safe despite officials home state advising people travel current surge COVID-19 cases.
The travel least ten state lawmakers drawn sharp criticism back California, observers say sends wrong message legislators leave state gather resort COVID-19 cases surging, leading tougher restrictions movement average residents.

The annual conference hosted San Diego-based Independent Voter Project also blasted watchdog groups corporate labor interests lobby Legislature pick many lawmakers’ tabs chance schmooze public eye.

“In normal times abuse office oil, utility big companies lobby Capitol paying Hawaiian getaway replete golf, hula show mai tais,” said Jamie Court, president group Consumer Watchdog. “In COVID times, abomination legislators would break quarantine play sun four-star resort.”

Statewide, COVID-19 cases first week November jumped 51%, eclipsing previous record increase 39% last week spring, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday.

About 20 legislators California, Washington Texas among attending conference Fairmont Kea Lani Hotel Wailea, rooms start $500 per night.

The four-day event kicked Monday, three days Newsom urged Californians travel state quarantine so.

Dan Howle, president Independent Voter Project, said 75 participants conference show proof negative COVID-19 test attend.

The state Department Public health guidelines note anyone arriving California states quarantine 14 days.

Howle said Wednesday lawmakers “are committed honoring 14 days” quarantine upon return conference ends Thursday unless take COVID test get back California results negative. However, state’s out-of-state travel quarantine guidelines make exception received negative test result.

“We recommending waiting three days taking test,” Howle added.

The annual conference generated controversy 18 years many legislators much travel expenses covered host — $3,500 last year — receives money special interests lobbying Capitol.

Howle declined disclose year’s corporate sponsors.

In past years, contributors conference costs included cigarette maker Altria, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, California Beer Beverage Distributors, Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers Assn., Chevron state prison guards union.

While many lawmakers travel expenses paid host, Assemblyman Frank Bigelow (R-O’Neals) said paying way thinks trip worthwhile conference includes discussion safely reopen California’s economy amid COVID-19 pandemic.

“The blanket response Covid-19 work small businesses, schools, working families rural California,” Bigelow said statement released office. “I paying here, following strictest Covid-19 safety protocols, tested negative Covid-19 prior arrival.”

Bigelow said plans quarantine returns California.

The Independent Voter Project declined identify legislators attending annual event, acknowledged participation others stayed mum.

Those attending include Republican Assembly members Heath Flora Ripon Jordan Cunningham Paso Robles, Republican Sen. Andreas Borgeas Modesto, Democratic Sen. Bill Dodd Napa, Democratic Assembly members Blanca Rubio Baldwin Park, Jose Medina Riverside Wendy Carrillo Los Angeles, well Chad Mayes Rancho Mirage, reelection month unaffiliated political party.

Mayes declined comment.

Cunningham confirmed Wednesday conference family, saying safe environment.

“This event promotes intelligent public policy state,” Cunningham said statement. “We paid family’s tickets COVID tests personal money — state funds used.”

Flora, Assembly minority floor leader, said statement Newsom’s decision week go back restricting businesses public gatherings surge COVID-19 cases makes conference timely.

“Participants discussing safely re-open larger sectors economy discussion suddenly became urgent Newsom’s announcement Monday,” Flora said. “Simply shutting 95% state might’ve made sense back April May, understand much then. We’re way past blanket solutions.”

Court, head Consumer Watchdog, persuaded legislators’ statements.

“You discussion opening safely Zoom don’t care golf, beach [cocktails],” Court said. “This always world-class junket. year it’s also lethal one shows disrespect quarantine hunkering right thing.” Apple/Google contact tracing system built current iPhone system. user needs enable contact tracing.

How system contact tracing protecting privacy explained Really going heard immunity church, they? Yet expect people go work nothing changed? realize type message sends tell citizens go work yet want restrict personal family time? wipe frozen stuff. Exactly. Like, self isolated 10-14 days hand tested negative? Yeah you’re probably okay go spend thanksgiving one household, depending get there. 

But going one 4-5-6 households? That’s fucking stupid matter what. Ankle bracelet. spend 15+ minutes restaurant done voided coverage. Opt discount style. still pick food etc etc dine stuff like that. realize EVERYONE bad time pandemic, college students, yeah? Exactly.

More likely hire expensive consultation firm, understand happened.
Lol I’m sorry, that’s terrible. Wishing speedy recovery good! Omg. fucking true link literally saying end second early third quarter next year could approaching ""by degree"" normalcy. saying normal. things said hold true. 
This sub full morons. cares opinion. Person One: “Finally, they’re page.”

Person Two: “Dude, they’re even library...” Lol sound lame shit dude, go walk something please stop. devolved slapfight. anyone actively going dates? see lot people are, thought getting covid potentially shitty hinge date makes rethink lol plenty time lockdown.

Sound harsh? Good luck life hits then. Nevada governor told us shape close stuff 2 weeks. two weeks Tuesday people packing bars know they're getting closed soon. know COVID bad? state requires neither seat belts motorcycle helmets requires wear mask.  certain children positive? I’m sure it’s likely wife were, sometimes kids aren’t tested.. would unfortunate child somehow evaded it, exposed another person. probably pretty unlikely scenario, reason could think keep distance. can't like Hinduism Bhuddism going temple/shrine involve sitting room priest preaches you, rather read texts hear stories interpret yourself. think churches 100% made control people, respecting Christ It’s even much “fuck it” “everyone himself.” I’ve come realization past week it’s time focus protecting people important assess risks based goal. greater good whatever window since apparently one else cares anymore. fucking breakthrough America mean, agree you, it’s simple everyone. 

You wife access outdoors. us hand, like me, car, live middle downtown area, studio apartment, moved new city right happened. know nobody, zero face face interaction anyone people delivering groceries Uber eats eight months. 

Again, right call stay home? people situations, yes. However, easy make be? Fuck no, dismissive attitude takes responsibility fucking stupid make people already mentally fucked jaded.  That's rough. best minimize exposure. international travellers, would full elimination. think manage risk present really well. whole country wastewater testing keeping info up. haven’t seen anything annoying part literally news vaccine available soon. know end pandemic atleast near. one thanksgiving sacrifice that's still much. bet see people acting shocked family members become infected covid predicted grew rural America. already knew it’s really reinforced time. Compassion weakness many places, never meet people openly different know POC person they’re often ignorant brainwashed white privilege.  😂😂😂😂 agree. Either put foot whole continue this. life death. nurses dying many die negligence committed healthcare system. wouldn’t ask someone I’m unwilling unwilling die hospital administrators. It’s last communal space left. Time book delivery slot. Even finally get virus control economic destruction occurred take decade recover. Minimum! Oooof covid freaking leave.  demonstrably false good question. people dying April March didn’t know save lives. death rate lower , real infection rate spring? I'm trying get reflect upon yours, since seem enjoy acting like moral high ground. idea. everyone I've heard talk released virus inject people vaccine track everyone. look countries Chinese tourism tends countries celebrated COVID response. possible they've lot exposure (less deadly similar) coronaviruses maybe fulfillment warehouses. Brick mortar gone forever. “South Dakota, suffering particularly badly, remains without even mask mandate, regarding wearing facial coverings public. governor, Kristi Noem, rising star Trumpist right.

“The facts simple: mask mandates, harsh lockdowns, massive testing contact tracing haven’t worked – United States abroad,” spokeswoman Noem, Maggie Seidel, claimed AP week.”


Ahem...Australia...New Zealand....Taiwan.... 🙄 can’t care people’s welfare care own.

Damn. Powerful statement there. forget that. true. soyolent greed  ""Let's run country like business."" like service receive refund right?

These ""run country like business"" idiots absolutely understanding democracy capitalism.

If ran US government like business free market could pay taxes ANOTHER, parallel, US government that's executing better one fails.

Otherwise free market dynamics.

On TOP Trump failure literally everything he's done.

I see, abstract, President business experience *successful* might actually good POTUS one that's failure!

Yeah three months hard quarantine opened bubble partner’s household helped good bit. Going I’ve said, you’re right, let feel knowing you’re wrong?

That makes someone feel bad diminishes prefer feel bad [acting like asshole] feel nothing all

Because hope you’re capable regretting poor decision. I’m trying diminish worth, trying get reflect upon actions.

Um, don’t shirts, please won’t count vodka bottles recycling bin. need advertise it? small, wealthy, relatively well educated country like Sweden

I guess seen Switzerland's numbers. think official ICU beds already full. flex employee-- shifts voluntary extra time (VET). know applies full time people people simply can't comply like March relief bill passed. doubt ton idiots though.

My worry poorer countries can’t get one really needed things like started rampant outbreaks. completely isolated something that's necessary severe outbreaks, times, people need information order make sound decisions long-term periods. Uh churches do? That’s church led Bruxy. Church education interpretation rest community outreach. 

Every church different. mega churches states dripping sin. Jesus would approve. tell never read article lol. would prefer feel bad 

Interesting, comment asked someone else felt comment expressed desire others feel bad. Maybe that's something reflect on.  US dumbest motherfuckers world. Straight up. would imagine would , like others said , would like Tuskegee experiments didint Yep. Luckily, husband lost job right school started, charge virtual schooling first grader. Meanwhile $2400 month getting us by. absolutely say common confirmed numbers are. 

Of course missing cases, can't really say ""much common"". Even proven reinfections 10 times 20 times higher, would still rare. short timespan months pandemic, sure vast majority people fully immune reinfection catching first would imply reinfection... 

About study cellular immunity, right, would imply reinfection. meant kind reinfection pontenital severe first one. think important point view severity pandemic knowing cases body builds kind defense long lasting prevents second infection equal worse 1º one. case, call ""immunity"", probably correct scientific term it.

If get covid experience severe symptoms like pneumonia 1 2 weeks, 1 year later catch T-cells experience light headache one day, would say degree paper peer reviewed yet. Wait I'm sure see changes. 

Well that's probably wisest thing do. read think point although people seem lose cellular immunity months, majority rate decline cells slow, predicting may last That's immune system works. 

Well, expert :D. think thousands become millions Americans let in? hear talk viral load lot affects sick get. scientific papers proving hypothesis, covid-19 virus? Social distancing work place thing. job puts little effort in. masks completely business usual. know that's universally true, true shitty companies.

For example Amazon notoriously long term focused. They've spent almost 20 years plowing back almost every dollar profits back business grow long term, vs posting higher profits short term boost University Alabama going entirely online tomorrow. plan place since august predicting rough thanksgiving/holiday season hospital packed covid patients, especially ICU. general census way get ICU beds covid patients die.

Went local Dunkin' drive-thru none wearing masks. said ""no masks?"" confusion lady manning window said ""nope!""

Who bitch at?

I already told corporate form letter response encouraging. *raises hand* Gotta wonder they’d even dating app didn’t want actually date year net benefit society amazon keeps running right far outweighs virus transmission takes place FC's. else people going get stuff need quickly without going crowded mall/big box retailer/etc? joke. remember seeing medical invoice someone insurance popped hospital get CV test leave, billed $4000. sitting room Australia overwhelming sadness happening USA. work hospital haven’t positive Covid test since may, even testing 300 people day slightest runny noses wearing full PPE check even smallest child sore throat- it’s exhausting.

I taking break go camping hiking 5 days friends- zero Covid fears. One state Oz small 21 person outbreak WHOLE STATE going 6 days full lockdown- dog walking, jogging- 1 trip shops day 1 person only.

I cannot simply imagine healthcare workers living through. must hell earth terrifying. Almost 2000 deaths yesterday way up- think stops would pull save drowning man woman- imagine 2000 drowning front eyes every day.

And read absolute insanity failed dictator refusing leave office greatest democracy planet ever known, supported half population- actually brings tears eyes. must stop GOP.

I realise politicians job simply re-elected- know this, allow re-elected good jobs, (R) next name don’t give duck anyone truly insane.

Keelah sa’lai America. may totally wrong someone knows better correct please.

I believe sedation mostly used keep people comfortable ventilator. That’s article talks would play need sedation afterwards. Presumably pushed hard playing hours like this.

Violins string instruments make weepy usually.. something sounds create wow video tears. Lool Americans end listening this. 150k cases day alot people still give shit explains fundamental resistance necessary work manage pandemic every wealthy country planet yet done work. Oh yea going war torn country stoning place entire tv series dedicated mocking politicians religion slightly better /s  matter do, would expect tax revenue fall coming years. People made less part. corporations, many loss. 

I honestly don’t disagree comment it’s gonna make it. I'm sure trying antagonizing towards statement since I'd usually among SJW crowd. However, agree you. Gathering groups pandemic generally dumb idea. Masks help. going potential spreader events better. Unfortunately, gyms area nothing like that. Stay safe One potential reason would increased mental health worrying risk factors found minimal non-existent. saying literally every single person voted Trump pro-opening America straight wrong comment. Common sense would told get stitched urgent care couple hundred bucks....two stitches medical emergency. course got removed us amazed would honest that. Lifting weights burns minor amount weight compared cardio. decent amount walking day burn calories walking lifting. know sounds wild it’s true. Muscle burns calories, lifting builds muscle, lifting lead body burning calories act lifting minuscule comes calories burned. Every president Since Clinton. 
 
Then Bush put us extreme debt, Obama pull us worst recession seeing right now. 
 
If dont think pattern must Republican. close friend mine works Vermont field directly involved beginning. amazing witness success collaborative efforts multiple programs state-wide made achievement possible. “Think stupid average person is, realize half stupider that.”

Rich White Women downtrodden society, dontcha know?   Staffords likely money invested local small businesses. I’m going see study report don’t believe /s I’m calling putting another person down. same, I’d want someone call it.

IMO “putting person down” would calling asshole, idiot, etc., purposefully trying make feel bad another way. may asshole (and may not!) that’s determination make - think you’ve acted like one making comment, doesn’t automatically make one either. I’ve made feel bad I’ve said sincerely apologize it, goal, also don’t take back, think it’s important call something think harm good. feel bad it’s likely agree modicum self-reflection, maybe even empathy person you’ve berated. sense, would prefer feel bad feel nothing all, least might think harder making comments future. needs stand since cant follow damn rules. Kansas ... we’re currently testing 43.8% positive (4th worst, better 58% earlier week). also suck tests, currently 9th worst 2.1 per 1,000 people - but, hey also improvement 1.6 per 1,000 last week.

Furthermore - I’m teacher. currently 13 weeks face-to-face schooling - 21 us classroom day windows don’t open - least wear masks - you’re damned straight noses. I’ve literally incorporate proper mask wearing classroom management system.

But it’s fine. Everything’s fine. fire rages around Awesome, that’s kind hoping plan trip!! disagree statement. main components see ""the Eastern"" way big NZ Australia, widespread mask use digital surveillance/monitoring. 

Border controls/quarantine used NZ 1918. Fun fact 1918 flu entered New Zealand boat carrying Prime Minister ordered ignore 2 week quarantine. 

Contact tracing traditionally attributed Englishman John Snow identification cholera infected well. wonder reason Manitoba bad Canada related bordering North Dakota. Like maybe ""essential"" workers bringing in. Good point. one 200 people know dead this. Thanks!!  TX 20k dead, CA likely hit next 2 weeks FL shortly after. Yes would agree would risky rushed vaccine, minimal risk throughout vast vast majority populace another opportunity freedom grab return ""security"". patriot act comes mind. 

I would completely agreeing think there's huge political aspect hidden behind veneer safety, that's even mentioning pockets lined links big pharma. Guess missed memo long-term side effects. 

It must terrible scared denial are. like Noem he’s planning run president 2024 going position “we beat COVID without lockdowns” Sturgis huge factor everything that's studied, also people take seriously IMO. May, ND's first peak, active cases barely 600. Cases deaths exponentially growing fall people still act like summer. long ironic road bunch criminals!  Psychomath.  Maybe half state actually positive lmao  Many us Americans trying best. few, course, still. sure, probably.  conservative really really scared tracked government important secret nobody cares would discovered FBI  going gets tough...fuck it. I’m out. Yet another hypocritical liberal buffoon. Never part trial like that, go get test see antibodies? 

Like CVS even one home ones? wait 6 months find out. ok. America, middle class worth lot less used be.


OMG \s I'm going Colombia 3 weeks January. Like President, said fuck it! right move him. take risks order survive times. fear widespread see virus dangerous proclaim be. deaths, yes. $10,000 one significant digit need overthought. 10 years life lost per death (some study concluded this, could still somewhat questionable), $1.28M per death according dialysis standard, ~0.7% IFR. Hospitalization costs probably higher. course know longer-term costs.

Both deaths hospitalization costs would exponentially distributed age, tiny portion society paying whole burden. absolutely correct think every infection incredibly costly us. bad virus evolves changes fast immunity may get work month 2

That match facts I'm aware moment. point being, live hundred happy years die comfortably sleep regarded heart failure? CDC makes guidelines state laws NJ school district came plan (most hybrid learning plans). daughter teacher far school done pretty well, many infections. However lot schools seeing uptick now, we’ll probably back all-virtual holidays Worldometers 1956 deaths 🇺🇸 wearing masks basic hygiene protocol, yeah rednecks dumb that. except school shooting whatever, still bad event, still politicians trying restrict guns even gang small shootings, even though get guns illegally, gun politics really dumb, almost worse US. Totally, feel same. bet extroverted people probably enjoy actively want zoom despise zoom keep shit away 10 foot long pole. Wish California dilemma. Soon enough, hopefully... Cases lower point last week. Everything else disaster. get it, what's point? going take data different site put theirs? men represent population despite percentage population women? Accepting screwed apologizing start, ""woops"" accidentally happened situation. knew better anyway; like planning rendezvous cheat wife. by, ""it happened"".

Makes appreciate example Fauci sets even more.

 New Zealand health minister F'ed violated protocol, apologized *resigned* . Eastern cultures need authoritarianism work. 

Japan constitutionally cannot enforce lockdown I'd rather live Japan America right now. Fake source? That’s new one, supposed also cover ears :) friend doctor confirmed they’ll vaccines stock shelves hospital three weeks. (U.S. Indiana) Honestly certain level community spread, we're wasting time. people can't tell store party contracted there's real need contact trace: assume everybody potentially proceed there. anyone traced back data see much spread Dakota's related Sturgis motorcycle rally? based maps I've seen Reddit sure seems like single even triggered lot trouble there.

 Idiots. I've people reach personally let know (have work person, fan) they've come contact someone need cancel appointment anyone contact tracing (zero) last 5 months. mobile app NDDOH uses well, requires people download it, can't even get people wear mask... nightclubs stay open! one enough vaccine doses yet vaccinate willing, let alone unwilling. now, mandatory vaccination proposals virtue-signalling.

And possibly harmful. People forming opinions new vaccines, opinions improved threats. sufficiently large committed minority ends opposing vaccines, mandatory vaccination impossible enact democracy. even know Tesla turned profit. 

What makes think? Also, making minoscule profit 3 times losing shitload previous 50 quarters... equivalent almost half North Dakota dead gone. Many could've avoided. could've held til vaccine admit came way faster thought would, they'd still alive. Glad hear didn’t hit guys badly. Let us know get — curious even milder. correct. think actually ignorant sinners.

Their stupid actions could kill people, saddle others long term health issues bills, make pariahs everyone else.

I hope best little town. New Zealand health minister F'ed violated protocol, appologized *resigned* . want see, read it. travelling nurse described grim El Paso. hard read naive think would much better Canada, Europe, UK, different administration. (Canada) places right heels, shutting face sky rocketing cases. Despite less drama vitriolic partisanship, essentially acted way. say half-assery, comparison places handled things correctly.

EDIT: said, points definitely deducted taking longer places reverse idiotic initial advice mask wearing. Canada shift course mid summer. love too. Glad voted him. read study measles outbreaks Netherlands. study explained country struggles rural segment population style bit like Amish US, biblically devout separatist. pressed, Dutch ""Bible Belt"" start forgo vaccinations certain tipping point, (under 93% think was) percentage vaccinated falls point, measles case introduced, find foothold grow exponentially unprotected population. percentage, measles might spread people peter 0 eventually. 

Anyway... I'm sure people minds discussing roll vaccine whether required. may worth requiring urban areas allowing rather ""closed communities"" like make decision whether put elderly risk. 50% positives means arent testing nearly enough. Sure absolute number tests high, positive tests like 5-10% like everywhere else. Sweet. ill wait 10 million people get it, wait 6 months, get myself. know, somebody’s got look ol yahwell. motherfuckers sure ain’t. gotta take selfie inside bank face mask wearing black clothing. 

Then I'll take mask off. :) Long Covid surprise CFS/ME community all. Hopefully means funding go research post-viral conditions, CFS/ME sufferers believed. I'm minnesota. new friend wants hang Saturday really want go anywhere. Shits bad worth it. parents wisconsin know bad move go home holidays. Oh well. Gonna shitty winter misread initial question ""2510 years"" thought ""Woah mate let's get ahead here"" bad math

People don’t understand large reason typical vaccines take long trials usually vaccinating something isn’t common. takes long time get enough infections controller group determine efficacy safety things like ADE. pandemic isn’t problem.

I mean makes sense within first days necessarily enough viral material replicated yet present place swab. mixing idea false positive accuracy actual PCR tests.

Hope works better washing machine, pressure washer cordless drill next leak water wet, heard first folks. Water wet. mom nurse even gettnig hazard pay Go back Facebook grandma saying (or quoting), 183 ICU patients ventilators total Covid-19 ICU patients? rather ICU, need ventilator.

I'm confused this, 183 ICU patients ventilators, high compared 21 patients ventilators Danish ICU (the 21 patients equivalent 38 Sweden). Yea point trolley problem track loop makes sure train hits everyone. guess openings good ventilation design.  Might specific strain spike mutation surprised was.

I've mentioned think would next impossible verify strain went extinct get carried outside quarantine zone.

Not mention mink farms everywhere could mutate again.

The risk high. either exterminate minks farms work developing vaccine specifically them.

The people infected minks similar animals infected greater chance mutations occur.

As others pointed out, covid's long asymptomatic period, much pressure mutate something less deadly. could become infectious, deadly, asymptomatic period could become longer thus spreading people.

The options endless good. People say I'm doomer virus keeps surprising us people taking right precautions enough leaders. baffles fail see staying home nothing struggle.

1st. Pfizer vaccine available 2021. company completed vaccine rollouts billions end 2021. least four. 

2. You’re implying every single citizen every single country need vaccine effectively end pandemic that’s true. Nobody expecting 90% effective vaccine, nonetheless SEVERAL. Significantly less people need take herd immunity starts kick in. WATER WET Officially going cross 2000 today.

Unfortunately funds leave. nuke orbit please. people think they’re immune catching (for good reason)

Can confirm. Caught 3 weeks ago, 2 bad days, 2 mediocre days, 2 ""just 100%"" days returned gym. **EDIT: spent 2 weeks ""fully recovered"" state self-quarantined lol, re-read saw taken returning gym almost immediately... waited 2wks**

Pre-COVID wore mask entire time gym, mentality ""if catch here, least smaller viral load full-on mouth-breathing."" ended catching COVID girlfriend who, although wore mask often, take virus seriously around many family members also take virus seriously.

Now, fully recovered, wear mask gym all. Already caught it, recovered, pick gym it'll keep body active antibodies way look it. ""NO RELIEF BILL YOU! EXECUTIVE ORDERS UNDERMINE FEDERALISM!""

If sense honour, he'd apologise me. probably probably won't. Hahaha, poor thing. even support win democratic primary : ) :) like keep seeing cause lose rest life. Pretty damn hard avoid trials already done already. We've known vaccine safe months, decided waiting determine effectiveness worth thousands deaths waiting period figured out. started deploying soon knew safe, worked figure whether effective already population protecting them. also ones spreading ones likely believe thing get vaccine anyways. Bring neighbor heaven handrails Carlsbad Caverns literally save life spots. Glad alrwady saw talk job have, handrail cleaner cave! minnesota schools (as far i'm aware) actually closed, also believe school districts got decide whether closed not. younger brother thing goes school sundays tuesdays only, private school guess whatever? fact, virus mutations cases make virus contagious much less severe. That's reason virus epidemics end fading away.

This virus mutates slowly auto-correction mechanism, making things good us vaccine-wise bad sense severity infection get down. $1200 bro, grateful! Thank internet stranger. Today first day since first COVID patient came home work cried. realise many countries restricting private gatherings travel months, right?

I live UK. I'm currently allowed indoors private residence anyone apart housemate partner, I'm able support bubble lives alone. Previous particular lockdown, we've rules ""no six people allowed mix indoors private residence"".

Our four constituent countries (England, Scotland, Wales Northern Ireland) bit like states, travel bans various times since start pandemic.

For instance, Welsh residents currently allowed travel England unless essential purposes, work. Scotland said non-essential travel Scotland rest UK. England, supposed leave house moment unless permitted reason, let alone travel anywhere non-essential reasons. believe social safety net, another round PPP order coupled help rent. believe “philanthropy save us all,” donate local small biz. believe “I’m risk-taking entrepreneur, deserve reward,” also get spoils let close down. Maybe GOP letting favorite local businesses die? minds moral approach. lol medical condition requires month trips medical office, started getting cold forehead temperature screenings reading like 95 degrees, write shuffle in. Pointless theater. church held concert week lots unmasked people attending. pastor defending it: faster. No. true, except dumb-shits think fact vaccine coming means longer wear masks social distance (if ever did). real thing. People already think vaccine news means back normal end December (if today). Depends objectives, vaccinate vulnerable, deaths plummet quickly, even doesn’t severely impact infection rate.

Having said that, mechanism uses vaccine effectively probably beyond anyone sub, whatever method choose likely research months DON’T CARE PEOPLE*!&lt; That’s filed too.  quick list get first follows: healthcare workers, school age children, risk people, essential workers, everyone else.

i'm sure everyone list mine. company follow business practices? think one thing simply stake another actively control decisionmaking. Technically virus don’t generate spread spores, molds fungi do. suspect you’re using “spores” analogy here, felt need point mycology geek. already knew that. scientists wanted know first part. going work them? Serious question.  weird super trump friends posting covid response proposed Biden socialism lead communism dictatorships born.

Meanwhile I'm like ""Alex, I'll take Fascist Tropes $1000""

 ""These groups historically used dictators scapegoats consolidate power dismantle democracies"" 

""What Communists Non Christian Abrahamic Religions?""

But can't really argue much point pastor one helped explain manipulated. pastor mega church. Arguing manipulate people believing bullshit like arguing Steven hawking physics. hospital trying cover poor PPE situation. Health care workers threatened losing job speak press talk social media poor working conditions since beginning pandemic. don’t see things would different regard now. Omg old people going die virus causes mild symptoms majority infected. shutdown society ruin everyone’s lives indefinitely wish didn’t eat meat, do. least advocate small family farms humane farming practices. wonder changes nurse doctor. imagine places insufficient PPE, younger help much keep getting exposed virus. exposure viral load would really high. Definitely feel bad that. care enough buy best masks given amount work doing. Good riddance.   fully expect leave White House day he's required continuing loudly proclaim ""BY LOT!"", really would like see dragged armed police charged trespassing. guess would similar eating rats opossum Unless relates cruel things like locking kids cages, preventing border crossings treating people unequally. full steam ahead Five Iron Frenzy sang 


""Perfection never requirement
although might say desired it""


There magic fix anything steps take mitigate death suffering pandemic. One requiring law wish participate society person wear mask allowed participate. shirt, shoes, mask, service. parents comfortable risk willing isolate trip, go enjoy Christmas family. Shit. looks 1 death every 17 seconds far scarier 4k deaths per day, although essentially data. Perspective all. agree you. overall point vegan diet takes much higher level knowledge nutrition (to well) diet includes meat proteins. completely agree SAD poor needs improved. keep mud farm belong. come contact anyone. easy solution Pfizer boss's prediction ""if would able vaccinate populations, think able go back"" normal life, urged patience caution.

""Until time reach herd immunity, people need careful. need follow instructions health authorities - wear masks respect social distancing,"" said.

With person requiring two doses vaccine effective, company's estimate 1.3bn doses end 2021 would cover around 9% world's population. So, would consider sharing production rival companies?

""Oh yes, bound infrastructure,"" Mr Bourla said.

""It challenging transfer manufacturing GSK Sanofi. easy. explore possible avenue. need involve manufacturing networks corporations."" I’m referring private prisons, although much part it. use prisoners across nation slaves make products (like nearly paint CA) private corporations provide public private services (like wilderness firefighters) auspices 13th amendment specifically permits this. Slavery much legal still country always been... whitewashed behind barbed-wire fences guard towers far removed places put badges slave hunters. Unfortunately, calculating who's going spread would administrative nightmare, point probably effective.

This method ensures stand lose get protected first. Healthcare workers first line society relying much right now. so? like Netherlands place reservation 90 minutes maximum 30 people time 1.5 meter distancing advice wear facemasks walk around gym. remove facemask stationary equipment using. according health advisors almost effect infections. 

Besides that, gym also helps people get better mental health, stereotypical steroid gymbro. also helps immune system since probably know sun shining much Netherlands exercising outside almost option due weather dark 5:45 pm.  Fuck. 

A) COULD, and
B) wouldn’t made damn bit difference US can’t close borders states 300+ million circulating land mass 25% bigger Aus 12 times population.

I swear, valid arguments oft-repeated like butterflies fluttering far head. don’t even fucking notice, much less comprehend.

Edit: I’m even responding shit added comment later. decided spend thousands sub par education pandemic country college scam. Boo hoo. One reasons many universities, tuition primary source revenue. can't speak institutions, school work, administration afraid without in-person classes, student population come back. Without students accompanying revenue stream, university would cease function. Ok. done fur now? Let's evolve one. Getting really close veganism fuckers... Good point think discussed something consider. Build temporary hospitals? entire summer this. 
China built temporary 1,000 bed hospital 10 days. Yeah idk meant critical thinkers. People prepared willing make hard decisions survive *more likely* survive, guarantee. Sometimes life screws deal best can. 21 days seems excessive point time. vaccine taken loads people, needs properly fairly reviewed. isn’t simple answer problem. Response pandemic needed multi-pronged well coordinated clear guidance experts leaders. trump administration wasn’t task actually seemed make things worse nothing.

""Un-American"" people consider colonists early war contain spread Boston area: Person allowed go Fresh-water pond fishing occasion may danger introducing small pox army,” wrote Washington July 4, 1775, second official day general. 

This simply ""people shall wear mask"", potentially ordering citizens away food water source. see article, recall smallpox colonies way leper colonies elsewhere. Hahaha stuff like doors well...but many people started this? main part door safer part?

That said, invest door opener keychains family I. retractable part touches door gets concealed touch stuff. also rubber tip end awesome self-check machines elevators, etc. Imagine shut happened... economy would recovery, heading depression. I’m March mind live. mean that, borders finally open tourists vaccinated tourists &amp; expats flock business returns back normal. borders strictly closed since March there’s strict state quarantine returning nationals. It’s... thing isn’t it? finally seeing people thought strong moral duty principles suddenly become relativists blink eye.

Hint hint: it’s labeled free market, tell what’s free market controlled half dozen corporations, I’d happy take downvote. 

Oh wait, you’ve got jack fucking shit. Same! work grocery store haven’t cold year though this, amazingly. Usually get one every 3 months. can’t even remember last time blowed nose. Ironic I’ve never felt healthier now. I’ll wearing mask whenever feel ill sick thing one stop so. can't believe Cuomo said turkey Thanksgiving. feel like people going keep low-key fact 40% traveling Thanksgiving still alarming Maybe disproportionate, per demographics, numbers dakotas guarantee majority deaths white people. think loves working class white people something? control group? feel like maybe control group 90% fatigued way normal life now. bad virus?

Taking average total deaths year US dating back 2014, average increase **1.94%** year. highest increase 3.21% 2014-2015, lowest 0.92% 2017-2018.

From 2019 2020, adding estimated end year total covid deaths 295,000 (a conservative estimate). seen **12.2%** increase deaths US. 

**12.2%**....That number far big ignore.

All information extrapolated via statistics available CDC website.  Take yes easy say there's testing

You dispel looking positivity rate. cases going testing more, positivity rate would going number tests goes up, least staying put. Currently US positivity rate increasing rapidly despite testing. Nice, I’m ND; woman got body slammed convenience store telling someone wear mask yesterday. I’ve germophobia since kid. didn’t get duck like lot kids. However...people thought nuts clean lol Idk kids elementary school sent 3 “a person covid” letters past 24 hours (we Ocean County). think schools go virtual next week :/ Nah, that's region is. lowly populated northern states majority people value freedom choices anything else, that's they're largely republican. necessarily hate everything democrats want, like government forcing things necessarily care upon them. completely different type lifestyle anyone large metro areas understand. unfortunate situation, that's majority people region live lives. know send child school wearing mask. Regardless children do. know power keep child getting sick getting sick putting mask training touch face hands. Pfizer &amp; Biontech german made vaccine, no? Biontech made it, Pfizer distribute it. Ok? Basic math? Lol Hoping Covid far away rear view mirror 2024 politics. fuck wrong people? I'm wits end heartless human beings be. required forfeit yearly earnings charity families dead. least everyone North Dakota pre existing conditions alcoholic smokers I'm germaphobe, born pandemic. boyfriend cold, would wrap face scarf protect myself. Stuff like that. sick tried stay home always thought maybe wear mask, want people look weird, would run direction someone wearing mask! think hope lot people continue mask wearing sick themselves. course, people anti-maskers never pandemic, hope moving forward masks generally accepted least people considerate wear one cold flu even, less people get sick. 

&amp;#x200B;

Even I'm sick, see wearing mask grocery store least cold/flu seasons whatever worth. Saying end sight like saying see moon.

We still least year uncertainty ahead us. mean, kind of.

Democracy refers leadership, privilege. electorate decides leads, leader decides permissable according doctrine. doctrine, (like constitution, determines right not).

Even government precedent requiring vaccination. Particularly utilizing funded services, like schools. wow. avoid tyson... wouldn’t even say HALF. He’s barely getting 10%. Surprised didn’t say ‘thoughts prayers’ walk off. Kristi Noem South Dakota's governor, decision allow Sturgis SD State Fair certainly contributed ND's current state. that’s mod... said misinformation lie death rate hovers around 0.6 death rate (just saying bc 3.5 would apocalyptic) idea talking about. Imagine FoxNews except FoxNews newspapers well. literally worst country world per-capita climate change response renewable energy sources available us. That's murdoch. He's cancer. everyone ever wished sign people showing trustworthy see plain day lack mask faces.

If can't trust people take basic precaution people's long term health lives line, trust anything important normal circumstances? Herd mentality*  Exactly. able skip holiday gatherings year, together next year getting us through. would interested well knowing. FYI, I'd probably rank shots equal response, different. like president puerto rico  well first foremost glorify effect vaccine's yet. Still need take necessary precaution months come vaccine out. eyes really get me. mean romantic way. Pro Life Kristi Noem reserved special place Hell. never understood people dumbfounded felt wash hands come back public place.

I asthma years ago trained touch face hands I'm wash hands first thing got home.

Have say cut number colds caught. Though learned hard way reuse tissue. Instead use squares toilet paper small enough use toss. I’m actually quite surprised impressed hasn’t happened already. Hypocritical 250,000 people US died illness 907 Australia worthy capital punishment. much control, rampant protesting? I'm basically saying level anti-lockdown sentiment small almost media fucking whatsoever.

But hey, keep thinking Murdoch puppet master controlling Australian life. Something like that. lots community workers food shopping distribution. order online essentials next day pick designated location area. face face communication, risk. mom nurse SD sound super great. ""We 26 ICU beds, 6 rooms double, 16 beds turned ICU beds, working another 8 beds ICU beds."" Fortunately mom gets it, dad, much. mom sad understanding I'm coming home thanksgiving. dad thinks I'm asshole mom. Maybe wore mask I'd least contemplate it. Nestle half everything. retrospective study, institute Labor Economy.

It also finds infections drop immediately, know can't case due incubation period.

This also conducted lockdown.

A 40-60% reduction would put lot countries well past herd immunity threshold.

Germany also one lowest deaths per capita mask compliance Europe.

As said before, weak studies supporting mask use, mean rush changing policies.  mean supposed do? buying toilet paper soup drive number down? one freaking literally won’t change damn thing. Free market capitalism opposite monopoly. think point summed as: variolation vaccination, intentional infection.

We could intentional infection COVID reduce IFR also; would even make tons sense society could trust leadership other. chosen nobody would call vaccination. that’s much better care May. Fortunately healthcare workers learned lot virus treat it. Go science! actually really symptomatic actual schizophrenia, Trumpism general. Like, literal definition matches perfectly, family also dealt decades schizophrenic aunt. google - long-term mental disorder type involving breakdown relation thought, emotion, behavior, leading faulty perception, inappropriate actions feelings, withdrawal reality personal relationships fantasy delusion, sense mental fragmentation. ""Your house fire, situation critical. house ... already burned down, situation over."" people work Pfizer ditch diggers. work HR too?  This. exactly thought. Leaders state federal level monsters. Making masks political ensuring thousands die ""flu"" call it.

I pray karma real people spewing BS...it comes back around anyway possible. get sit back make money people die trying push propaganda low IQ individuals.

I hope get what's coming whatever form end world quarter million Americans. another quarter million.  hope becomes part norm especially winter months Someone needs psa commercial. family jovially celebrating Thanksgiving dinners invisible reapers standing behind many people dinner, followed Christmas funerals. emphasis contrast joy sadness. might lot turkeys unfortunately. study flawed Every state one dose shipped PO Box approval, way could “technically” true. mean, would think reason one follow it? according possible get virus frozen food.

WHO simply said there's evidence such. Yeah, this. touching surfaces isn’t primary mode infection, great. question is, get touching surfaces. articles, answer still yes. 

It’s risk management. live area done good job controlling Covid, less concerned surfaces. live US, treat every surface like it’s infected. KIDSDONT GET COVID. kid SCHOOL. VIRTUAL. Jesus kids gonna grow soo dumb. That's IHME, guys infamous predicting, April, US max 60k dead August, 2 weeks hit 60k death, April. yeah usually takes YEARS vaccine especially magnitude go testings alllll trials needed green lights hit nation wide use...and done 8 months.... 8 months... know squat tho wonder there's certain amount data collected due rapid pace development.. make completely immune ooor God bid covid still next yr would another vaccination needed like flue vaccination every yr... know things like covid self God bid go completely away comes back every yr like flu... would whole set questions could asked company saying hey guys got got pfizer... Well well well life really toss tricky ones huh... Phew decisions decisions.. 😬 mean, already pretty desolate start with... That's literally illegal entire point union. Americans talk guns never tell trolling serious. Coronavirus definitely spread surfaces airborne droplets small enough float around. go library study always carry around disinfectant wipes wipe table put stuff (while obviously keeping mask times except drink coffee water). Better safe sorry. America broken proof. Canada much better. silent nuke leaves zero geological footprint. 5 stages vaccine distribution puts 45% US last line. I'd surprised get vaccination summer. die? 500 cases vs 100k+ cases? That’s fuc🆖 ugly man. insist denying science? Texas got dead bodies refer trucks... replay seen before. lost faith humanity sloppy disgusting mess. People can’t bothered right, well ain’t Christian sloppy pig cleanliness next godliness. ain’t heard? brothers keeper ! providers locums prn nurses won’t coming around anymore hard hit areas. Got tighten folks. w soldiers. realized life could possibly worth 40 cents.

You're lucky worth +$0.40. us seen liabilities (negative value). Good luck that... Yeah never clear whether transmission weren’t traced didn’t occur tracing sucked.

You always read stuff like “there confirmed cases someone contracted COVID eating fast food”. would even confirm that? apply statement anyone: Germany might done lot wrong things WW2, eventually right thing lost We've known months point.

It's amazing knowledge trickles gets tossed around ""new"" people heard before. Interesting. Blowing nose could presumably aerosolize amount virus could inhaled two minutes later well, especially since elevator mostly confined space. Here's idea - Bodycam livestreams.  literally insane. believe thst main reason peaks epidemic health system capacity test deaths, specially die hospital. would interesting also check data territorialy see correlation availability medical infrastructure, maybe opposite, high population density. alternatively know airborne hang air confined airspace longer 2 minutes. lax CDC recommendations led America worst case levels planet. sister selfish potentially exposing people “loves” fast painful lonely death Chinese people say they're governed.

And Americans got pick Trump Biden year. feel people China. oppressive, vicious state West would well cut ties with.

*Looks US military bases around world, looks US's interference foreign governments, looks list wars*

The world could less USA thanks. leaders confident governing abilities, they'd nothing fear election.

If people confident leader, need system allows regime change every 4 years. Fuck supposed remember these? Studies suggest viral load adults children. Hmm... develop purifiers UV lighting inside... Anywhere wedding golf course, probably People influenced material conditions. laws made enforced, information exposed to, communication strategies take ideology/subculture/psychology account, incentives disincentives, on.

If change environment, change behaviors. IIRC whole book intended stoke support better working conditions, instead created demand better food regulation. Yes, difficult ship elsewhere. Ah, see post, thanks link. I’ll delete duplicate. CDC recommendations lead America worst record planet virus. Please use places handle things guide Yes. refugee thing frustrates bit clear many countries resources help much people currently want borrow phone take video? dunno, democratic feudalism? miss nerd conventions

I miss afraid going bar

I miss concerts festivals study flawed design. wore masks never dined alone likely wear masks home. places high mask compliance like Hong Kong, dining venues major source outbreak (before stricter measures put in) addition homes.

Also study dispute wearing masks protect others infected infected wearer. Part reason need take word 'citizen' back. low wage immaigrant worker everything right, including paying taxes taking care one ugliest parts society citizen, none us considered one either. antiquated arbitrary language BS helps divide dehumanize. Well really mandatory it?

Then pretty much vaccines get ""mandatory"", least i'm from. Cause get always certain things can't do.  Whatever, keep trying score points. validating critisism. care more.

Much cheaper Pfizer Moderna ones, plus think manufactured larger scale  done? I'm ideas. Canadian expat living abroad.

The country live currently make mandatory vaccine available population here.

I trust science happily take it.

Canada make mandatory course, that's whole box worms force people.  laughably naive mah human rightz Now, sign sickness, people take seriously ensure work spread it. 

Some managers treat negatively. sick leaves get higher chance fired/replaced. I've got one close never closed. Wtf?  even try provide cogent counter argument. Would tacky wear argyle socks argyle mask?  ND, number 1 honey, canola covid done? Better nothing...

Like bag sand.  Dakota’s never locked begin Good luck conniving people cancel holiday plans, hyped vaccine stories pushed every media channel

I mean, can't differentiate vaccines treatments, people read fine print vaccines actually *widely* available, people still think virus hoax, whole year pent demand, yeah nobody's gonna cancel anything. virus hurts business people believe exists bad

The problem large portion country refuses believe virus exists ""it's flu"", even hospital gasping air. 

Businesses getting hurt bit less expected lot restaurants area seem decent number people dining in.

They'll also still burden hospital system, decreasing quality care us find non-covid causes.

Also, try better show empathy towards people even they're stupid. makes sense. Without masks growth could 10x large example. presence growth environment mean masks effect, masks enough stop virus without measures. lol nobody made decision yet   That’s exactly point.

Meanwhile murica.. really hope over-zealous sanitising everything stops done. There's nothing wrong clean hygienic course, case diminishing returns comes sanitisation; certain point cleaning actually making anything safer.

In fact argued we're making everything worse, over-reliance dangerous chemicals keep everything sterile. increased use chemicals means increased demand, means increased production pollution comes it, make surfaces tiny bit cleaner actually safer would bit soapy water like used use. test positive? think quite dystopian tbh.

I'm kinda agreeance here. I've nursing 25 years, love - risk life, health loved ones, job.

No shit, I'd find something else do.

Long gone days nursing considered ""a calling"". days job young women. got married child, career over. lucky, managed catch young, single doctor, become wife mother.

In day, nurses hand-maidens medical fraternity (the patriarchy). shit job, one came degree esteem.

Historically, paid housed studied become nurse. Now, study university graduate substantial debt recover.

Again, totally correct point. Nurses choices:

* want particpate termination pregnancy, work abortion clinic. 
* want work paedophiles murderers, work forensic psychiatry.

Because blaming, suing fining funeral home director much easier blaming government. 
   cared science uneducated it. accurately determine death rate diseases least i'd say 100th percent. Covid, flu, etc. guess work enough experience covid get semi accurate estimate. 

Math hard. Covid deaths/closed cases = mortality rate. 10 yr old level math. need MS doctorate 5th grade math. 
Did mention keep quoting WHO, 
1) studies( likely even peer review them) 
2) Said multiple times estimate? meteorologist estimates 30% chance rain tomorrow. studies use type ""science"" meteorologist uses, guess based data covering variables. 

The parading studies around facts. You, however, . Yeah, that's kinda I'm saying, though wants use guideline (which forgot include):

I’m 27, 23, got abnormal herpes infection. HSV-1 cold sores before, somehow sex got genital HSV-1. That’s unusual part, it’s went body. infection bad, lacked actual sores, doctor didn’t even think herpes first two weeks sick. One worst infections life. fact, even now, I’m getting outbreaks, don’t start getting sores, even premonitions, get really sick (though that’s waned years, usual).

The problem is, data showing covid deteriorating blood brain barrier. Herpes actually travel brain infect (it infects nerve cells all). It’s normally kept due BBB, severe initial infections cause neurological infections near end life, due prevalence deterioration BBB.

Listen, I’m fine brain herpes I’m 90, data BBB true, could happen much sooner. It’s become less issue if, when.

I get it. It’s stressful, especially you’re young like me. see many people trying go back normal life, I’ve judged don’t want big crowds. also feel like I’m fighting world life.

I’m sorry you’re going this. I’m hoping it’ll get better soon. then, stay safe No, strange I've different peaceful assemblies left wing causes years met violence kettling cops weapons anything objectionable. 

And strange see people gather semi automatic weapons storm statehouses right wing causes cops thing it. Either enforce everyone not. frustrating see seen right peacefully assemble tarnished, others. Let’s go far there. Completely understandable. collection plates ain't gonna fill themselves, all.  RemindMe! 2 months ""USA deaths February"" mean bust bubble, gym rat 3+ years COVID came around. Given current circumstances (which I'm sure aware of), important right now. hope understand, Mr. Schwarzenegger Charlie Choo Choo ^(think distribution plan uk care homes staff first followed front line workers.) original Constitution, proposed 1787 Philadelphia ratified states, contained individual rights guarantees, framers primarily focused establishing machinery effective federal government.

The main argument I'm hearing shutdowns businesses (bars, restaurants, ect..) choice open aid. personally agree argument, know bars restaurants open incompatible interests public health right now. chemical company claimed needed continue polluting environment order stay open/profitable let that, feel businesses claiming now: stay open (and provide safe harbor people want belly bar 4 hours football game) business ruined. Emotionally totally understand, objectively bars restaurants safe. Ideally business owners probably importantly workers receive aid shutdown, need shut down. said number total ICU beds respirator country

Yes, course ICU beds access ventilators, least normal conditions. agree ICU beds ventilators, patients occupying beds actually using ventilators.

But confusing indeed. Besides Denmark, know normal report detailed use ventilators ICU. Death ☠️ Cult know, right? Ding ding ding! Yup! Murders working that’s we’re good at. encouraging every young people know watch W5 program hopefully convince must respect social distancing mask wearing. Oh, look wants sympathy now. Maybe *look another job*? Maybe stop tone policing actually address argument.

Also, r/COVID19_support. people hurting saying ""what hell ain't takin rushed vaccine kidding me?"" mean president? Yeah fuck right off. grandma, live four hours away wasn’t directly charge coordinating care. mom sister, take appropriate precautions, ones taking care since COVID got state back March. don’t know uncle picked weeks ago, I’ve no-contact years he’s racist piece shit. far I’m aware first time picked up. wasn’t call though. 

I’m already torn losing woman god damn national treasure, say last goodbyes via text message hospital staff read her, getting see buried reasons I’ve already stated. feel obligated try make feel worse it? curious thinks that, mean science dude, estimates use.  People families feed options :( Number 2 100% money. City council voted mandate “people good job wearing masks need to.” Complete bullshit. Yeah, wow, really climbed since looked last Friday. Good lord. Personal accountability still thing. 

In summer COVID ""surging"" Florida, think old people eager go bars visit grandkids? Fuck lol.

But holidays around corner, old people isolating summer say ""fuck it"" visit family. longer protected elderly population.

Would rather nothing writers danish constitution consider would exact scenario? Wait.. talking Europe US? much easier immigrating America compared countries. Instead apologizing eating friends family birthday party violation restrictions, Newsom apologize restrictions themselves, immediately lift them.

Well took hard left turn end. worth, California took longer start seeing surge states seeing, suddenly ending restrictions start new surge govenor ate expensive dinner suffer nothing bad press incredibly asinine. Yea fair, also he's politician money, matter time slipped got caught. incredibly immature throw caution wind excuse ""well got it."" news, water wet. Susan already bought enough turkey, yams, green beans, potatoes, pumpkin pie ingredients 20 people morning. changing course now! part reason compliance dropping. stupid messaging like this. boy got tweet    Listen, get saying, bullshit it’s “on par flu” young people. friends it, 20’s, definitely say it’s worse flu. long-term damage looks far worse flu. also never heard “long flu.”

The reason I’m harping is, yes, elderly risk, know intent was, know many 20 something’s, conservative all, given up, them, “it won’t worse flu.” want with, know fully going risky situations intent catching it, kind hoping do. So, even though you’re trying state relative risk groups, urge refrain using, “[similar to] flu,” much possible. Definitely report Facebook page misinformation Anyone else really get sick year non covid illness? Last time got cold Disney late December, early January ironically probably one worst cold ever got would like putting bullet proof vest shot. attended birthday party organized anywhere essential places, people live with? danger her; good talked through, wear protection, seems like acceptable risk (make sure ventilation; linger)  haven’t either like aspect can’t wait done. I’m grocery worker work 8 hour shifts hate damn sensation restriction hope don’t keep making essential workers wear make yuppie people feel safer COVID (obviously love right safety despite discomfort). swear nose drips non stop wear mask. like wine 0.65 9/11 units death Yeah dark winter things get better vaccine general population, however, likely know time able get it. front line healthcare workers getting first, it’s likely large number exposed virus asymptomatic, mild symptoms, bad symptoms still get vaccine anyways. won’t totally dark time vaccine available general population. 

And it’s like companies developing vaccines don’t already know concerns.  ""Party law order"" Sounds scientific. Probably reason don’t see footage African kids. pictures horrors war. suitable broadcast. Ah ok. Yes feelings mixed 416/905s.. mean pick New Brunswick either weird I've met handful people NB without exception every one immense asshole. don’t, know vaccine works likely widely distributing March. likely air elevator? Good. Make proof immune/vaccinated requirement public event like concerts, expos watching movie least 5 ys see anti vaxxer loons go extinct rather quickly.  Noem claimed South Dakota's mortality rate course pandemic remains national average ""far states like New York."" However, New York Times reports state's death rate increased nearly 50 percent last two weeks, bringing total death toll 674 Wednesday.

Both true. Noem talking Total Deaths Per Capita, 2.5x less NY. NYT talking death rate increasing 50% past 2 weeks.

**Total Deaths Per 1M**
  
  #1. 1889 NJ
  #2. 1753 NY
  #8. 1030 ND
  #16. 762 SD
  course, relevant stat current Deaths per capita, ND SD #1 2. flatten curve, soon exceed NY total deaths per capita.

**Current Deaths Per 100K (7 day daily avg)**

  #1. 1.9 ND
  #2. 1.7 SD
   It’s that. It’s anti-science culture, conspiracy theories, denial. tons accounts nurses US patients refusing believe Covid-19, deny exists, moments sedated intubation. people decide don’t want go anymore

The interesting part whole generation totally skip clubbing experience. People going night clubs kids 16 20 yes adult night club, people 30 going casually year (and spending money). question whole generation skipping clubbing phase impact next generation. Would kids 14-15 start clubbing end next year interested older brother went. loved Ed Emmett, thought great job, republican voted for. also love Lina Hidalgo. great job, enormous opposition. one brave woman! Jim, take New Years Stanley. Still long road ahead, least light end tunnel. I'm really keen see published data vaccine phase III studies learn details really see mean practical use; long term studies long protection vaccine last. Still, I'm optimistic big step forward, data always convinces lot news press releases. CDC altered response covid based political pressure cowards abdicated responsibility science, wellbeing, american people wish worst life. Looks like always Economic warfare. lockdown rules seem wiping middle class. Tyson prototypical horrible company. recently left job supervisor different Iowa meat processing packaging plant Tyson handled crisis ridiculous put meat plants iowa area risk due overlapping work forces. able take simple measures infection rate third county located in. Meanwhile infection rates approaching 50% Iowa, state take pandemic seriously, touching 2%. Absolutely appalling failure prevent outbreak terrible response shut got bad. Many workers come Tyson due bad work there, would say company worked treated employees poorly large part comparison much worse Tyson. like science-denying antimasker. Saying ""bullshit"" make studies less true. completely delusional think black white study 100% validate agenda fake news. allowed acknowledge studies still think schools closed. Incorrect, 3.5% assumes nothing. empirical data, all. X/Y = Z. assumptions, numbers pulled thin air, guessing , population sampling, silly studies half dozen variables, researcher bias....just statistic math formula. Covid deaths divided total closed cases = mortality rate. 

Sure probably lot cases go undetected, many would guess dont guess science masquerade facts. definitely say tested positive covid ~96.5% chance survival. Actually, something like ~83% covid deaths people age 65. age 65, probably 99.5% chance survival. fact small amount reinfections relative tens millions confirmed infections worldwide. Science f*****g sick Canada closed borders yet flights still coming every day. get land border crossings US heavy restriction, many Canadians flout rules don’t trust government. So, overall, less imported cases, community cases sky-rocketing across country.  Lmao keep licking boot, excusing inept leaders. order people follow rules, need people made rules first place follow them

I'm baffled understand Yeah ended rasing prices called shortage. look actual numbers made Mutch normally would plus extra 20% witch sold China. Yeah take COVID seriously hearing older relatives (who barely relationship with) take seriously created intense hatred within me. I’m lonely depressed suicidal almost nothing good left feel. world government US seems fucked up, lot boomers contributed to. can’t take anymore honestly. grocery carts probably fecal matter, bacteria, basically whatever think it. covid thing. last chapter kind awkward attempt convince reader embrace socialism. I'm socialist myself, dont think kind proselytizing helps spread message. People generally dont like preached to. number three far. it’s flu season right may increase. understand Trump’s rhetoric poor, portion deaths really attribute that? France, England, et al. leaders said right things (by large), they’re still incurring deaths per capita TODAY. following European countries reported deaths per capita w/I last 24 hours compared US: UK, France, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czech Republic, Romania, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, host smaller Balkan/Eastern ones. seem like Europe turned corner? don’t think so. r/latestagecapitalism Cowards?

Wow.

No hospitals crushed, patients die due staffing ratios PPE getting hard get again.

Wear mask demand change. I'm skeptical use terms like ""passes safety checks"". thought human testing usually suppose year. saying work dangerous, better cautious.

That said, think priority vaccine 100% go medical staff first general population. One, worked ass past months. Two, complication vaccine, already hospital. It'll stop governor contracts corona.

Nuff' said. Newfies know make sacrifices common good. used hard times. zombie virus that's why. everyone character 40 minute zombie show 90 minute movie maybe might even think real! Besides shows movies always show survivors villains. disease rarely gets attention. reality similar. still trying figure answer myself... family still getting together thanksgiving including great grandparents (who actually great great grandparents!!!). giant family gathering. told expect come. know someone got dad sick asymptomatic dad ended dying. can’t live something like conscious. 

I feel like, 9ish months since started, point anyone still hellbent denying basic math swayed. Maybe end unintentionally killing family member something equally horrible. that’s really sad. 

Enjoy embrace beautiful country friend! longer live consider finding way kiwi lol. probably number greater 20, study looking Qatar, found 0.01% chance infection. something average person worry about. trolling? referring rate infection, number cases state. Comparing number cases TX population 29M number cases ND population 762K meaningless. look number cases per capita. ND 185 cases per 100K people. TX 32 cases per 100K people. aren’t. Washington locked back via planned news conference Sunday. Public health populated counties encouraging limited gatherings last month ... didn’t open much Texas didn’t also announce we’re going lockdown (Texas Florida). show healthy lack ""management material"" lol. mean compliment. massive assumption think people western countries perceive asian countries 'dirty'. Anecdotally, everyone know referred asian countries past - implication sanitary culture. makes sense. Especially since given world everyone watching see happens. people like food values. prescedent set America - police right inject ketamine feel threatened. government hold put chemicals body.
I’m vaccines tend agree voluntary. Let anti-vaxxers create generation new lepers - it’s right.  Back Pre Covid ... .... 11 million cases America. 
11milion 
11milion 
HTF think you’re post covid. horrible Tldr: Canadian government secured enough vaccine doses vaccinate every Canadian multiple times over. happens multiple vaccines approved may give extras countries trouble securing doses. According CTV news, 78% Canadians say they'll get vaccine. actual fuck?  *legislate* literally means ""[to propose think showing symptoms earlier good news. Less asymptomatic transmission. literally said dereliction duty already good.

And turns out, u/latusthegoat pointed out, already good. fact, buying need (just like US EU UK), actively hurts countries.

So what's problem now? Third highest deaths per 100k so, freaking world. North Dakota number 1.

For additional context, current deaths per 100k (as opposed total deaths per 100k). According NY Times, 7-day Daily Average Deaths per 100k:

1.9 Slovenia
1.9 N. Dakota
1.7 Bosnia Herzegovina
1.7 S. administrator last job, holding weekly meetings washing hands. rationing N95's (one per nurse, indefinitely) . Solidarity teachers, didn’t go school become martyrs either. going lie
I terrified elevators. many times air get cycled per hour. filters
 
Sure one person time per regulation
Did person 10 minutes ago keep mask breathe coughing fit...? know say this. assessment aside compliance citizenry differing collectivism societies (some society likely listen experts others), several Western European societies United States look Chinese experts (including Hong Kong Taiwan).

I say much United States - experts there, even took seriously, hampered positively harmful administration. three examples repeat often Sweden, Netherland, Australia. know escapades Anders Tegnell Sweden, whose infamous herd immunity policy result unnecessary deaths. Lesser known early denials Netherland CDC Australian CDC, back March, virus spread asymptomatically. Despite Chinese Hong Kong report around late January / early February virus spread asymptomatically, countries' CDC denied reports, claiming evidence observe case. retract statements couple weeks after. aware recently late September, Netherland's head CDC, Jaap van Dissel, still doubted efficacy masks control pandemic. Madness!

Now, I'm expert course. follow what's going China (from Reddit!). Chinese government perfect. many faults problems. However, going early problems local government Wuhan trying hide what's going on, observe Chinese government did. Maybe part Western attitude towards China thought China overreacting, even ridiculously thought Chinese genes different genes would safe virus? illusion, simply thought, Chinese government, presume competent technocrats, took drastic measures first locking city eight million, province 58 million people, effectively half country 1.4 billion people, \*know\* something virus compelled took seriously.

Of course immediate neighbors took seriously too. Vietnam managed virus going war. South Korea used technology track infections aggressively. Taiwan outright blocks everything China. Mask wearing became universal Hong Kong Japan. Meanwhile, around time, Italy still went soccer match. 

So that's I've wondering really. governments thinking saw China locked hard? worry? scoff overreaction? simply distrust report coming China? feel powerless warn citizenry, fearing non compliance labeled Cassandras? hands locked virtue society governing? Don’t. shake head walk away. use arguing, *know* someone works hospital. Don’t waste breath. day able schedule appointment getting vaccine, also I'm going get kid vaccinated well. put bullshit body good proven scientific backed vaccine honestly bad opinion. 

Also unfortunately right, conversation co-worker actually pretty smart said common flu dangerous blown proportion person said proud trump done well. smile nod agree avoid stupid argument he's right I'm right. Well, run-away train picking speed entire train consists dumpsters fire. actually happening lot days. Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc. They're starting regulate everyone says allow deem ok say. really right believe social media platforms need looked closely. Many act law regulated much do, share, data collect. He's way ahead you. Already 2018.  Wtf even mean  Nurses told work circumstances increase risk patients. see wanting better care patients getting higher ratios nurses client, cynical, assume want lawsuit busy see happening patient hall. I'm relieved I've never customer. nurse doctor walks job blame them. hospital needs back scenarios. "" Im going read wrote want proven wrong."" 

I literally explained studies scientific inaccurate often biased towards results researchers want( PSSTTT: studies researchers get funding grant money.) link bunch nonsense WHO. 

She literally says multiple times ESTIMATE ESTIMATE ESTIMATE scientific data. Estimate = best guess. 

What said general opinion( even read would know not?) Also opinions mean shit. misinformation happens peoples opinions taken facts. 

And fact actually listen woman says, says ""estimate"" multiple times talking 0.6%. interpretation said incorrect, another common way misinformation spread. stating something fact stated estimate/educated guess FACT. ""Boko Haram"" literally means ""books forbidden"". 

Once one anti-knowledge crusade, atrocities follow quite naturally. According to? He's catering people whining losing businesses livelihoods due lockdowns. Selfish people want go work instead staying home. Wear mask, bigots. We’ve adapted horribleness, hopefully someday soon it’s better right amount freaking change that.


That's kind point many y'all missed something. I'm saying freak clear TP. None helped before, would now? I'm talking numbness resignation seem feeling nation right now.


It's like.. let's freak light representatives' phonelines, inboxes, etc ask they're doing.. response shameful IMO. Still is. I'm trying part individually there's much individuals do, know? that's rub.


I know. guess thought better country? feels like try control severe anxiety, wear damn mask, keep distance. We're own. Sucks said, point. hope anxiety bad lately.  mouth nose indecencies I’m that. seems fair me. No, get breathing in, touching surfaces touching eyes/nose/mouth. one needed study figure even people can't recognize sarcasm unless spell them. second wave increase crest it? beleive so. think fascinated about, lost opportunities ""butterfly effect"" things, imagine many people would met love lives travel, get job, worked home didnt go coffee shop frequent enough start talking person hitting off.

With said, contrast past pandemics wars, generally lose much. people 100 years ago deal 4 years world war additional 3 4 years spanish flu consecutively, damaging  Korean study 200 possible reinfections found active virus participants. studies saying, science pointing another direction. 

I really get many people insist COVID non existing immunity. Lmao imagine linking QnA fact sheet website ran institution patronized Murdochs. Degenerate state  simp strong ones. Yeah. Let’s miserable forever forever! won’t shed tear sub gets accidentally deleted. Gotta shore force field lack empathy among many what's getting me. hard bear knowing many fellow citizens can't even bother wear mask get aggressive called out. Wtf. Thank sharing! Knowing I'm alone experience really helps. may survive thing?! Whoever come contact free chose wish about. Simple that. like it? Stay home. get soap box demand government hold gun people make comply vision. rollout take months, possible distinguish vaccinated unvaccinated people (and many anti-vaxxers qualms lying it). combination vaccine rollout, masks, make community transmission disappear much, much quicker.  Luckily, carbon atmosphere ever recent history! 2020 win! Dude, you’d depth bathtub. I’m actual public health expert degrees. 

The reality Trump delayed closing travel China let 40,000 people exceptions. person claiming Democrats fought Trump himself; Biden tacitly endorsed restrictions said problematic block based citizenship based actual travel. (Chinese people flying US England blocked restriction Malaysians could fly directly Wuhan US wanted) person fell fake news you. It’s November, never updated fake talking points months?

Trump absolutely fought mask orders, watched White House press conference myself. 

The PPE shortage since February. It’s cool took notice March like rest public public health healthcare communities monitoring situation way earlier. Trump making harder March April too. 

The number Covid cases skyrocketing schools nationwide, Georgia close schools New York re-closing again. 

No, you’re projecting claim it’s political rhetoric. Trump always wanted *appearance* vaccine actual vaccine, pretended multiple times there’s already cure (there isn’t) vaccine would October. potential pick FDA head wanted eliminate phase 3 trials would okay ineffective vaccines released. There’s pattern Trump.

How miss last 11 months? listen Fox News filtering? American says keep shut get covid shots. think fair. people going large gatherings Thanksgiving matter what. least way, they'll mostly stuck home afterwards, infecting other. sad thing state city could this. health insurance companies? getting wrecked hospitalization? help build simple reporting system. know universities basically trying end academic term, least allow students return Thanksgiving. Personally, kind think universities encouraging students either wait travel travel isn’t demand. understand universities don’t want students traveling Thanksgiving coming back, it’s also probably great Force students everyone travel point. preacher TV told to. I’m sorry. I’m glad got hell hole. Current job treats like threat tries best. mom currently I’m work 12 days pay. MO...perpetual state Misery ...have lost weight...? think reason lost Georgia told people vote absentee. 20k people voted primary didn’t show election FUD spreading.  rational want wuhan style lockdown, lockdown totally useless might well bots trolls thread astonishing. could go paid year lmao barely get anything is. hospital corrupt comes. Thanks sentiment though really greatly appreciated say please without asshole composure sure ill link doesn’t. I’m considered risk, healthcare worker, I’m stupid either. I’m 50 plans suffer shit. millions like me. Nice try marketing think “over”, can’t bullshit another marketer. can’t fix stupid plenty there. Yup, someone know posted today fb. “It’s media scaring us.” Yes, first time confirmed, using tests even exist December.

Anti-body tests show people early doctor couple times Mycoplasma Pneumonia. There’s lot respiratory diseases aren’t COVID.

Yep, one matched COVID line.   shit? White House sucks everything do. news? Quite likely.

A big part reason respiratory viruses usually common winter weather affects behaviour rather affects actual virus itself. Colds flu spread large extent everyone indoors, crowded together poorly ventilated spaces.

It makes sense different climate, people likely behave like summer (because ""too hot"" bigger problem ""too cold""), get transmission summer rather winter. estimate late april normal, sub estimate march-june usually, d00mer estimate 2022, fauci 100% normal end 2021 getting slowly normal time passes

he means need mask distance months distribute vaccine, makes sense Show studies. Apparently viruses care curfew times, lockdowns, many people packed place, masks lines map citizens vote.


Someone tell gnome South Dacovid. information overload. lack education already bad. add constant barrage social media fed people addicted consume mentally able process propaganda lies facts. gym opened back weeks ago i’m stepping foot COVID stuff think simple. naysayer, two vaccines reported efficacy nothing short miracle - testament human motivation, tenacity, ingenuity, hands down. think vaccination process go smoothly projected, terms reach, thoroughness, true numbers vaccinated X period time, willingness general public receive it. 

I think no-masks public, person work / class, etc. resume fashion remotely resembling normalcy fall 2021, we'll likely 3rd 4th wave light vaccine due non-compliance, etc. people infect. I’m one them. covid defender score, mine would high. example, left house past 37 days. Traveling turkey day christmas option entire family avoiding covid. facetime. prefer anyway. Holidays brutal. Hasn’t suffered enough!? Total dickhead. course needs reason send bad message. Immunity proven timeline. Doesn’t make safe acceptable. saturated ability test more, probably course it’s not, it’s worth it. Doesn’t matter. goal isn’t eradicate virus. vaccine decreases deaths, hospitalizations, cases (not eliminate like flu vaccine doesn’t stop thousands flu deaths every year), that’s good enough.  leader country wouldnt let Americans right now. Especially value Democracy. Fascism Authoritarianism spreads like cancer. See response moron. Maybe Fauci spend 30 minutes listening Rush right leaning talk radio commentators. point movie, start realize Soylent Green people. humid there? might explain why. said “was stunned fact certain areas country, even though devastation outbreak clear, people still saying it’s fake difficult thing get over. people still insist something that’s staring right face real.”

I know exactly feel, Tony 😔 really wish would stop equating outdoor activities spread though indoor activities. think key problem people meeting indoor settings order avoid causing problems judged folks. That, course people simply can’t bothered either way. also think causing real confusion sense hopelessness lot people, especially folks top don’t necessarily know going on.

Personally, think we’re taking much abstinence approach don’t think working. disagree course things would best folks could follow idealized guidelines, going get work point. such, even it’s would like ideally, need find better strategies avoid riskiest behaviors allow manner psychological relief.

The way think like diet. Maybe folks it’s possible cut absolutely everything that’s bad one go. people, take approach, you’re going fail hard point. Instead, need talk ways adapt gradually change things instead trying go everything once.

So would proposed in? Well, starters, emphasize difference things indoors versus outdoors. allow things outdoors remain open people place go something (and yes personally think includes outdoor sections amusement parks). Especially comes meeting folks, encourage visit outdoors masks daytime. Perhaps going walk something similar. Obviously mass gatherings happen Dodgers Lakers Biden victory necessarily ideal, sufficient distance masks, really shouldn’t much concern people spending multiple hours indoors people household. Wow I’m almost certain happened things well, think certainly things like Halloween parties personal gatherings also huge contributing factors much difficult track down.

Remind people transportation big factor. car safe invite strangers it, make actually quite easy Get sick. such, especially avoid traveling people household, must, ensure ventilating car frequently, even it’s cold. Personally, whenever get car now, start driving, leave windows open bit allow air circulate, even though it’s me. folks, sure wearing mask situation. It’s easy lower guard somewhere like car.

And meet indoors, carefully four minimum amount time required. course slightly better masks available now, certainly better cloth ones many us wearing around, must meet, definitely make sure high-quality mask, maybe even consider doubling up. Depending situation, goggles may also sensible well.

Anyway, I’m sure going take kindly particular message, think need recognize approach we’ve taken failed failed hard. It’s don’t wish people would follow rules, it’s simply don’t think trying convince folks point going get us anywhere. Instead, need refocus efforts making sure reduce risk much possible folks understand risks are. also think, certainly context California, means rethinking current tier system think included lot things sensible, like indoor dining. Especially given relatively OK weather, certainly south, exactly strong argument opinion keep restaurants open indoor dining, something know lead infections ever since start pandemic. Creativity responsibility needed here, need better strategies try make abstinence work. I’m saying answers here, think need come alternative strategies try out. Can’t bars indoor dining without masks Spain? Good joke. Bush 9/11 major specifically ? curious This. Also, one see muscles casket.  Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I'm sorry it, too. keep telling April we'll probably control, least enough population vaccinated sorta get back normal.

Keep fighting. Three easy understand reasons masks reduce transmission SARS-CoV-2.

1 - Put mask try blow candle. notice almost impossible. breath plume significantly reduced density velocity. Meaning can't reach people around nearly easy nearly dense.

2 - Wear mask minutes take notice inside mask moisture. Much respiratory droplets aerosols carry tons tiny virus contained instead spewed environment others inhale land public surfaces others might touch. 

3 - Masks cut viral load twice. 50% escapes mask, I'm also wearing mask 50% gets cut half 25% enters mask. 75% reduction amount virus gave me. That's HUGE!!! may even get infected. immune response much less deal with. difference symptoms, sniffles dying. Mission Accomplished! I’m Florida lol... shouldn’t come surprise God won’t bring end times fast enough ourselves.
Plague first use delayed gratification example personal perspective, rather societal perspective. could move much quickly took seriously short duration.
 
Referring everyone sociopaths bit strong, frankly I'm pretty worn hate mail flooding inbox covid deniers. honestly, really qualify sociopathy take actions benefit one's self endanger society whole. 
 
I'm sorry interpret stance virtue signaling - personally think that's dog whistle phrase recently created shame people right thing. appreciate civil discussion though, people disagree acting like children throwing tantrum nap time.
 
I know state-by-state situation, nine months really long forecast getting vaccinated point. Colorado governor thinks enough doses everyone available early April. Relief really around corner.
 
I hope plan stay safe works loved ones. personally live guilt responsible death parents. lot hopefully happy years left life, weight something like would haunt end days. free chose going store risk want take.

Are free choose going store risk they're willing take everyone *they* come contact well? Ditto. drinking LOT sober October. Started 1st week November - hungover twice one week. stopped again. isn’t worth alcohol creep you. Easy develop dependency don’t notice try stop. I’m glad hear you’ve stopped. first read argument back May.

At point killed sufficient numbers people will, eventually, indeed correct. South Dakota - doctor, based decision wear mask view he's developed immunity information, science, truth, advice growing evidence immune least seven months perhaps years come, similar chicken pox, measles, etc.,"" wrote, without specifying sources current science far less clear Krabbenhoft immune seven months, much less years. South Dakota alone, health department officials announced late last month investigating 28 possible cases COVID-19 reinfection, people previously tested positive least 90 days health officials said they're still waiting large-scale studies know long COVID-19 survivor retains antibodies point they're immune reinfection

... Lol ikr? Like, last I'd even heard cases leading keeping way. *Shruggs* Since entire comment threat nothing article, suggests one five infected people experience symptoms, transmit virus significantly fewer people someone symptoms.  lower risk transmission asymptomatic people, might still present significant public-health risk likely community isolated home  people symptomatic, concentrating identifying probably eliminate transmission events.  studies showed without symptoms similar initial viral loads — number viral particles present blood — compared people symptoms. asymptomatic people seem clear virus faster infectious shorter period.  immune systems asymptomatic individuals might able neutralize virus rapidly \[b\]ut doesn’t mean people stronger durable immune response  evidence people severe COVID-19 substantial long-lasting neutralizing antibody response possible work home. small area clear bedroom sufficient. Thank you! Well, technically right, nothing and/or purposefully spreading lies inadequate efforts. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  doesn’t surprise me. wondering counties close. poetic justice. pandemic created two opposing pseudoscience groups. ""anti maskers,""and cloth ""masks alone stop pandemic"" group. killed lot people dangerous misinformation spread, neither group ever take responsibility admit right. pandemic ends at-risk people healthcare workers vaccinated, USA expects 100 million people vaccinated end March, numbers definitely line us back normal then. Kristy Noem? Sounds right alley lol. So, many first doses vaccine going troops provide national security? Politicians get first Soldiers? Like raain, wedding day. Martyrs told hazard pay, raises year, company going stop contributing retirement.

If believe COVID exist claims bad flu, fuck you. guess people already COVID declared ""pandemic""? this. it’s even interim analysis data anymore - hit final Phase 3 trial endpoint latest data. gonna announce vaccine stuff fauci make seem like always cared cross training mass? nurses sent home work units don’t deal Covid? Iowa Dakotas 7 day trends flat trending first time two months. Thursday's numbers already three. Thats swedish approach, delusion peopme grown dont need masks all. death rate 5 times rate neighboring countries. mask mandates month, too.

fun fact: name Lena Unicorn, awesome that? No. Im responding you. seems representative texas residents even representative judges.

But clearly going anywhere going address making argument assigning me, quoted called out. reason us continue. Omg She’s liar tho lmao

Pain, swelling, redness shot given
Mild fever
Chills

Headache
Muscle joint aches

Serious side effects vaccines extremely rare. example, 1 million doses vaccine given, 1 2 people may severe allergic reaction.
So means like 100 people get fucked Wtf talking china US started testing day back March, testing multiple vaccines results. basic facts need us vaccines Well want give COVID people risk selfish douche bag, yes there's reason get delighted SA Health acted quickly stamp virus give us back fabulous South Australian lifestyle. Courage truth health officials wonderful. hope respect act accordingly. Yeah, I'm sure comparing gun laws gun deaths Australia America winning strategy you... thanks explaining! vaguely knew deactivated version thing vaccinating against, know viruses cells... which, unfortunately, lot average American understands It’s century pandemic. brainer skip holiday gatherings. fuck wrong people. Negligent stupidity needs shamed. horrible part obvious China’s response dealing with. government didn’t even admit airborne last month so. strict ive seen, indoor dining schools gyms bars ect. Good! need catch every case comes back communities deadliest train wreck could find Queen Sea 1700 deaths. Today 2000 Americans died COVID19.  it’s airborne, people passing apartment hallways street... technology require low temps  Literally people need wear Fkin mask!!! Use elbow push door (won't work pull door tho) elbow unlikely touch face might sometime unconsciously touch face hand. China even need vaccinations dude many cases  weeks months till happens  Could elaborate everyone danger leery of, call, ""good news""?
Also ""good news"" youre referring back people thought kids immune? still clue long immunization lasts though, correct? Probably medical privacy laws.

Generally reporters aren’t allowed hospital rooms.   Yeah, know. dumb right basically worst covid ever everywhere. think rushed clue careless selfish. vaccine went trial stages vaccines, pandemic even easier collect data. reason came early boosted production, basically produced vaccine testing it, scientific development itself. vaccine, approved market, safe vaccine took 20 years produce. Learn english wtf think mis read comment. Maybe don’t live area don’t know what’s going on. borders

Prepare V2, u/Solo_Wing__Pixy I'd like help that's cool. Never moderated either, long help lighten load I'll best.

Haven't really purpose since pandemic started, maybe need.  always thought silly saw people parts world wearing masks understand. think even common see people wearing masks therefore maybe less stigma feeling well wear mask help protect us all. Maybe get defense production act moving? feel like responding someone else. Again: said Harris County representative state.  words, second half dichotomy OP suggests. decided argue half instead first half (or could mentioned decrease car accidents one example) since figured everyone else would talk already. Awww fake news crew dying. would thought. think are, least officially, backing away claim since genomic sequence

Time tell ""DeSantis assures Floridians give shit live die"" I’ve heard many women say guys say man I’ll never understand it. kind jackass says someone working laptop? It’s bizarre me. Maybe I’m averse saying I’m often told look upset I’m reading something it’s annoying af. need mask? PM address. Yeah, execute mental gymnastics see fake news reported deaths order explain weren’t wrong. 🤦‍♀️ Dayum doom redditors shambles LOL will! rapid closure borders, along (still mostly) robust universal health care system, relative geographical isolation definitely helped, bonuses going us.  
But US may many bigger cities Australia, Australia whole urbanised nation USA 


If taken actions lockdowns (and listened murdoch media conspiracy nuts) we'd bad shape many countries regardless advantages Journalists rebranded ""Angels"" ""God's Messengers""? stopped using door dash reason. charge $1-$2 per item addition fucking fees Dude would trump know vaccine coming days election? Trump literally paid people produce election failed. 

And going fake ass vaccine lmao more-so blame Mr. Peachy. cant stop watching we're helpless passengers stuck inside Totally different, knows father came from. lot black people america could guess anscestors came from. feel like black people purely american this. family origins history start here. sucks got people like president telling black people go back came mother Ireland. Black people, far anyone trace back ancestors, came here. city Sioux Falls SD pass mask mandate yesterday. 2nd largest Rapid City votes later week.... thing worse covid cowboys year doubt pandemic last long socially. Spring 2021 things fully normal. goal zero covid cases, sterilizing vaccines come later society wait that. Reminds SD nurse went news week talking keeps patients die insisting hoax. :( hope family okay. Ha thought saw thread. ever rural Dakota's looks like this: 

So COVID, went local bar 50% town was, masks social distancing reduced capacity. people went home families saw 50% town. 

Everybody town potentially infected. Contact tracing done.  Yeah, neoliberalism work, Biden right time, right? Go look damn mirror while. strict lockdowns  know fix problem. 6-12 years catch up. underperforming now, students schools underperform classroom too. districts providing high quality distance Ed, piss-poor. in-person schools plagued violence, decaying facilities, gross inequality next town over. “at-standard” student one state may equivalent student one year higher lower another state. 

There uniformity.

Some students won’t achieve even 2 additional years K-12 education college-ready 9th grade. graduates functionally illiterate. 

Students standard 1st 2nd grade equal higher peers within academic years.

It isn’t worth risk potential long term harm (which nobody able predict certainty) risk death student, family members, teacher. Good, opens door distrcits pressure fence close ""in accordance new findings federal health agencies"". Shut shit down. family rural North Dakota sick Covid right (9 people). One uncles symptoms: coughing, fever, loss smell taste. insisting can’t covid, covid “is hoax”. money hits hard. 2020 fucking years. makes bad/good turned 21 2020. Thank god &amp; family safe. sick.

Worse every way yet everyone tries immigrate America almost one China. People aren’t dumb think best, hilarious hope someday bore grandchildren stories birthday Last Pandemic Glad voted him, vote again. He’s putting people first, even people short-sighted see that. makes sick see uneducated people call ‘Adolf Andy’. Wrong many levels. Bingo, society nutshell big discrepancy?

Because people work weekends. Yup. People think I'm insane, convinced actual infection count, including asymptomatic cases even infected party know about, _at least_ much (4x) number detected cases -- perhaps even 8x detected case count.

This mainly based fact cases mild, cases originate major outbreak zones -- major outbreak zones, getting tested prohibitive based testing availability long result latency times. means people get tested _quite_ sick, turn means recover making testing site, since cases healthy individuals self-resolve without requiring (or benefiting from) medical attention.

Furthermore, many avoid testing simply hope recover due ramifications testing positive, perceived actual. Loss pay even job, inability see loved ones, social ramifications, enforced quarantine, etc.. Logical not, real many people.  apparently 95% effective vaccine batshit insane first generation sort thing pandemic response experts wet dreams 

You reach herd immunity quickly kind effectiveness Death rate less 1%, fuck even talking dude, literally 10 second google search 38% say otherwise problem comment said numbers didn’t go protests. There’s good reason protestors likely wear masks attending Trump rally. thought protests necessary worth breaking quarantine over, pretty horrified amount people streets celebrating Trump loss. hypocritical unnecessary. think protests were. Sorry jumping throat.  covid. dad tested negative 2x. tested high levels covid antibodies. Test 100% mean 95% effective? remaining 5% mean? Like work 5% population? kill 95% virus last 5% rendered useless? Denial state supreme desperation. David Perdue Georgia senator even blatant it. win get 50% vote (49.8) still shot January staying in. Montana reported positivity rate yesterday 90.6%. may run hospital/morgue space pretty soon to. sucks. Yeah, got away without wearing coat summer winter put one on. masks distancing. they’ve pillaged country decades comfortably retired left us crumbs that. take seriously people literally fall infront them.

Priorities.  Theres really nothing wrong wrong football games themselves. Fans allowed games different story. People need escape giving people normalcy sunday critical. yeah. Fans crazy. Haha could say replying person article ;) Lmao yeah herd immunity going work says side okay hundreds thousands deaths.

Herd immunity DUMBEST solution.

Why use SCIENCE combat this?
 
Ironic dumb fucks calling people ""sheep"" wearing masks wanting vaccinations ones sayinghherd immunity work.

Did work 250k Americans?

Did herd immunity stop spread?

What bonus herd immunity? help economy. money spend caring sick would herd immunity play. downright irresponsible, tbh LAZY

You dumb fucks wanting herd immunity actually LAZY make changes life. LAZY give fuck July, probably still fairly accurate. poor likely uneducated don’t understand inflation. time travellers tried subtly warn us! Yes im still quite shocked! long wear mask work protect virus well wash hands distance yourself. Also daycares schools. one three kids sick since pandemic started. think coincidence, daycares schools obviously cleaned properly pandemic started, sick least, monthly thing. It’s like watching train crash slow motion, able switch tracks, headed straight disaster &amp; there’s nothing it.  reason we’ve working offices last decades


No good reason simple observation would say 50% individuals businesses completely ignore mask distancing requirements. Seems common Yes try keep up. attended high school Flint, MI. metal detectors thing do. 

I grew single parent household, divorce finalized 4 years ago, sole custody. I'm recovering drug addict former sex worker. 

We live rurally now, often utilize library wifi (available even closed) village 700. Churches (of two) also leave Wifi full time. Even relatively strong Wifi, often crashes pressure 6 full time virtual students. (All different curriculums). left ex husband molesting daughter, abusing kids survived food banks year. 

Our district figured out. hard. tried keeping kids single room rotated teachers. middle school procedure. middle school currently closed person education...85% staff contracted COVID less 2 weeks. Kids ate rooms stayed cohort groups hybrid rotating days...still close due COVID. inconsistency makes situations even dangerous. end sight nothing motivating everyone know take safety measures strictly. burnout feeling ending, there's hope. Nobody wants get covid potential long term illness end sight.  think doomer mindset super unhealthy counter-productive time, believing pandemic soon hasty, naive belief. I'm virologist, doctor someone qualified predict anything correctly. We've seeing news vaccines since pandemic started. nothing respect love scientific community around globe working ass find end pandemic.

I believe ""Hope best, plan worst"". think people hopes expecting end come soon find disappointed, anxious uncertain. us want shit end. want go bar, want go travel meet people, want go someone's wedding can't.

I mentally prepared virus around till 2023 truly effective vaccines come around virus naturally fades away like pandemics past. disappointed goes beyond 2023, least that. 

Hope strong thing hold to, rely alone. Prepare worst possible scenarios. 72 deaths reported November 11th alone. unusually high day, think accurate say deaths very, low. Snakes snails puppy dogs' tails. population temporarily surging going make supplies even harder get. even primarily air, end somewhere, end face such, still good idea clean. Stop testing! COVID-20 wants know location live at....? like said, see 99% people wearing masks. maybe 1 2 people store wear them, usually oxygen wear shield coverings. gives solace, sometimes look another way. feel much relief hurricane end amid it. hurricane much shorter time left virus. 

And number lives lost COVID-19 coming months expect weatherman forecasting 100 consecutive hurricanes. get looks N95 surgical too, guess I'm also looking horror others masks hanging face putting least amount time possible. one unlucky work for.

for refrence says 95% effective

the survial rate covid roughly 98-99% 250,000 dead america

5% lot Neither. Get bidet sort abuse emergency text alert system turn mine phones. wild idea, sure!  Oh please god true

Please

Please mean positivity rate go up? Interesting. spoke nurse manager school health services Pinellas single case schools traced back school spread. positive cases traced back community spread. Sheriff part elected. Plus calls defund police, agency right mind want become mask police? need small portion population follow guidelines things get hand. US wish small portion.

Same thing religion industry. need small portion behave bad cause problems lot people. 

We also need stop acting surprised people following health guidelines. shocked see people eating things told bad them? Shocked amount smokers? Shocked amount people get STD's following health guidelines? chances infecting someone crossing paths outdoors 2 seconds non existent. Osrs life pissed to. im literally thing dad africa mom white american. everyone thinks im black, except african americans whole culture african culture too. Eventually shut it, become numb doesn’t affect you. Ever hospital doctor’s office called ambulance gotten someone didn’t seem like cared wondered even field? Well, probably care started, something (or hundred somethings) pushed past point empathy attachment people. I’d like introduce company called Moderna. Reddit hate U.S. almost satirical times. Yes. It’s extremely common. don’t want hassle getting kicked stopped going main places, many neighbors people. don’t associate anymore, offered make masks first started screamed me. didn’t take kindly it. many think. first. God, can't wait get vaccine hug shit parents think quasi normal starts April, start going back 2019 levels late spring early summer 2021. what's insane kristi noem claimed smithfield sioux falls reopen ""national security"" ""critical infrastructure"" Maybe, first world countries take months years Thanks great explanation, well-written. 

I like think vaccines like though they're cartoony intel white blood cells identifying enemy combatant. 

""Listen men, briefing: enemy looks like this. Kill him. questions?"" 

But said better. insane amount sharks die save 7.8 billion  I've worked Shipt get little extra side. great money means least take seriously, 'personal shopper' app people I've run into. Hand sanitizer, trying keep away people, always wearing mask, u-scan 1-2 less people involved touching things, etc. absolutely recommend isolating groceries week they're perishable, wash perishable things thoroughly.

There's much do, we're getting paid much all, definitely expect diligent try be. I've already caught COVID, I'm paranoid want catch spread do.  Probably Tulsa correct? probably travel, meant excuse fact ahojld wear masks. rather get covid get injected vaccine  This. Florida doesn’t really income tax. Instead, higher sales taxes, meaning residents *and tourists* need spend money state get revenue. Shutting literally would cripple economy differently since entire revenue based tourism. Sorry. hard days. Yes me, me, me. Welcome 21 century. really think church small rural American town Calvinist? Really?  Tons people work sick. large portion people don’t sick leave benefits. may walk past someone leave. It’s recommended wait immediate household members remove mask must missed, full r/collapse rejects? subreddit? notice many posters inclination almost wanting things go bad (reinfection, minks, etc) Yes, discount EU's investments also. note NIH funding basic research huge portion academically possible.  Surface transmission pretty rare, surface transmission day ago would seem extremely rare. media getting head bud..  Didnt ration care Italy flooded cases? think remember hospital staff talking many people died unnecessarily, staff couldnt keep up.

Poor healthcare staff, horrible situation around Ah yes got mine generation. serious side effects vaccines actually effective money pushing drug something it’s Indeed. least region hardly see people without them. get it, one would've made vaccine otherwise. incentive safe possible avoid lawsuits time usually good way keep shoddy medication getting rushed public

There still incentives sell safe vaccine (ie, wanting gigantic PR disaster) direct monetary one. Fuck it. mistake make - coming general conclusions isolated anecdotes - typical folks understand statistics. nice day. don’t think people time, wouldn’t wear mask you’re sick?  constituents company - main shareholders - select CEO.

The constituents country - voters - select leader.

The Chinese people say they're governed. leaders confident governing abilities, they'd nothing fear election.

I feel people China. oppressive, vicious state West would well cut ties with. also American. used to, much genetic makeup infested population it’s Me. Looking fellow human ancient art. Don’t fooled though, second people like shits creek immediately start pointing fingers whose fault is. blame? sue? Rights!

But fuck everyone else rights. Fuck everyone oh compromise betterment society. state(PA) ap one wants use it! Also constituents would vote implemented stay home order.

Abbot needs impose restrictions though, least enough make look like he’s trying something without completely ruining economy. Nope, COVID back January anyone knew WTF think it’s good idea brown fire houses this?

Aww, want matter fight meaningful fight lecture others shit make up. life sad. Man, sake hope get vaccine causes turn zombie consume brains. least you’d some. Vaccine almost ready

*Cries third world country* None address broken homes. sounds like didn’t live one don’t foster one. care kids seem educated enough know own. isn’t comments directed at. 

Teachers give awards? Many kids rural America don’t even internet sister hell time home school 4 kids, different ages, zoom schedules calls. It’s near impossible teach 4 kids 4 curriculums. 

I get top stuff. Outside bubble it’s peachy. 70 million people voted trump. Schools urban America metal detectors. There’s huge drug problem across country. 50% child abusers family members. Home isn’t always safe kids little zoom check in, that’s even possible places, won’t change that. 

Your journaling zoom conferences norm. I’m saying wrong (I’m happy you’re great), I’m saying you’re seeing whole picture - that’s point. People don’t worry food insecurity, parents hit family touches seem think everything great inside walls every house. Kids need school imo needs safe way that. Even it’s keeping kids single classroom rotating teachers. Even that’s staggering days half school time. Bringing lunch kids rooms, etc. I’m sure varies state, theoretically strike could cause lose medical licenses. part, laws (probably actually laws like state guidelines, policies, et cetera) written favor patients. sounds great theory, side coin rules written screw healthcare workers cause signed this. Even worse becoming martyrs treated evil liars endure hostile yelling try best save someone dying disease don’t believe exists magic picture box home told so. know sarcastic, makes mad know scientist totally could reverse engineered virus make less lethal, put zero energy money towards can't make money that. vascular disease breaks blood vessels creates micro clotting throughout body...technically correct. would rather roll dice find LEVEL DAMAGE virus leaves behind. People ignore stay home order like first one. Plus Thanksgiving next week, people getting together friends family matter government says good thing barely allow people games. Everything I've seen like 20 something max. vaccines coming pretty soon one another success rate. Seems sus. People understand. look reddit majority people government mandates/enforcement, seems fine. look Twitter/Facebook there's huge pushback, along false information. completely insane many selfish entitled people are. country went stupid hole long ago I'm afraid we're coming back, get suffer nation stupidity. mean like get flu vaccine every year problems? new/reworked vaccine every year. works. Mine’s 96% effective that’s cool guess People like reason climate change thing. Isolated, rare cases. trend, far current data indicates. making typical mistake folks understand statistics. dont think getting it. Someone know personally gotten covid, twice. gained immunity first infection wouldnt happen. 

Winning lottery=/=how human biology works tuesday...yesterday worst day since around may 6th. Microchip? OOOOKlahoma, Covid's sweeping plains... Hope, guess. I'm sure sick thanked would much prefer rest us get shit together, thanks crazy hard work. made realize understand per capita means

edit: (nvm saw ""per million"" got it) intend drive people away religion? drive people away religion. mean like two opposing pseudoscience groups, ""flat-earthers"" ""sphere-earthers""? earth fact ellipsoid, two groups equal misinformation? ‘Just ignore votes don’t lose!’

/s stunned. year proves stupid many people are. Mine moves remote T-day. that’s something. Gotta spread gospel... Thank this. would precautionary measures would taking sure. 

The numbers area scary everywhere. I'm frustrated know do. certainly exists many countries, many others permeate levels government addition population? excellent news. Next step getting vaccine starts tomorrow 50% population average intelligence... 170 million bright people... much surprise tens millions easily convinced “hoax” trusted source information telling so? Damn. figured missed nothing! bout gov give us fuckin tests then?! Ah, another day Coronaville 🙃 crazy much US- particularly people act like they're ready war moment- admitted defeat jump completely surrendered it. reeks cowardice can't even see it. sorry loss ❤️ someone advise?

My roommate school teacher NY private school. plans close. immunocompromised work home. wear masks indoors maintain 6 feet apart. wants either a) move potentially infect b) schedule time us day kitchen living room ourselves. room closest bathroom/kitchen mine living room.

Would love brutal honesty cold winter months. Says person soapbox really typically America propaganda level drama 😂😂😂

Do dramaticals thread care explain support none sense? found vaccine US?!

There’s paywall article, unfortunately. say fuck em Drive school, kids exposed covid home bus. school pretty proactive including shutting back 100% remote learning starts get hand. noticed constant travel colds kids, including myself. think masks also likely reduce incidence common flu. likely stick pandemic protocols even pandemic passes. Yup, grew it. umm. experience. negative though say. horrible, glaring issues it. Sadly, comforting people believe evil cabal running world realize universe random chaos nobody control anything. Agree. get go, ""mask type x% effective. Type B y% effective"". UK banned one. state submitted plan reading fed going dish proportional population, i'm 100% sure since read bit ago. 

i think first rounds much organized since going nursing homes (headed cvs walgreens kind places) first rounds going front line workers (surely employers handle shooting up) opa killed jesus day Abbott still refuses nothing it. reference, covid reported today. sic. exactly left comment Hell yeah!

Here’s hoping true. It’s nice know light end tunnel getting brighter day. got two degrees, one full time student working part time, one part time student working full time. bought house moved last semester grad school, terrible idea. varies people free time undergrad even working/interning. felt like insanely busy college looking back like 21-25 afterwards much compared recent years, even kid. You’re credible blow fatal disease you’re least affected. fine, stop spreading lies fear. info weeks date I'm sure still 100% accurate anymore, proportionally speaking, US right track deaths Covid Spanish Flu, point pandemics. Oh yea. That. put required vaccines? like mcdouble? comment make sense me. I'm speaking situation US. We've never complete lockdown. national stay home slow spread period plagued noncompliance jump ranging people businesses flouting rules, law enforcement refusing enforce, armed protests reopen. People driving hospitals shout healthcare workers, there's anything less helpful can't think it.

&amp;#x200B;

On basic, superficial level, abstinence sex education work **because** noncompliance. Theoretically **all** people could abstain sex, would unwanted pregnancies/STD transmissions. ultimately many people want sex, large fraction even want children, abstinence wrong approach problem unwanted pregnancies/STDs.

&amp;#x200B;

Even case preventing Covid-19 spread, alternatives draconian, total shutdown. Following analogy lockdowns abstinence only, let's say masks akin condoms/dental dams, physical distancing/minimal mixing households practicing safe sex general (only go without protection monogamous relationship similar mask use home members household), large enough percentage population refusing comply, capable exposing others will, expect communicable disease *not* spread? asking USA, political pressure enormous cases start dropping, especially deaths start dropping. simply go zero cases.

I think elderly folks covered, we'll full go. say allocating them. guess they're getting orders essentially next-day, it'll initially states institutions order them. wonder National Guard could help? Put parking lot somewhere. I'll drive get shot, even random guy little training give injection.  Omg. Thank much! people get vaccinated, businesses start requiring proof Vaccination, definitely help influence people get vaccine. CDC useless whole thing. reputation toilet now. “Immunity” doesn’t necessarily mean can’t catch virus (that would “sterilizing immunity”). article read yesterday likely memory cells, typically able keep getting infected entirely. Pence say, ""The risk average American remains low.""? remember April June large percentage people thought never going get one going pandemic years rough time didnt know going Anyone else unable access this? think took down. gonna work restaurants bars still open dinning in. Thank situation like too. Lots cases early on, drop cases month, basically explosion cases starting Halloween. can't wait snatch cheap real estate Good luck every time go gas station like 1 5 customers actually mask wearing correctly. Provided enough population vaccinated. lot that... Washington state alone, there's 120 suspected reinfections 

And better tell authors data wrong data show full immunity majority people. Especially comes IgA mucosal antibody neutralizes antibodies upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 sets shop. 

Not really sgnificant *The percentage subjects seropositive SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies (titer ≥ 20) 6 8 months PSO 90% (36/40). Notably, even low levels circulating neutralizing antibody titers (≥ 1:20) associated substantial degree protection COVID-19 non-human primate* cases confirmed reinfection clinical outcomes shown severe less severe. 

Really? think rate decline slow. 

Probably specific cells, *Spike-specific memory B cells abundant 6 months 1 month. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ cells CD8+ cells declined half-life 3-5 months*  decay circulating SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ cell consistent reported another acute virus.* 

In summary, think SARS-CoV-2 antibodies fade quiclky study shows, reinfections much common proven, long-term immunity unlikely.

 think may wrong something really consistent seing reality studies immunity. truly apocalyptic scenario old people continously admited hospitals can't build immunity? businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I think personal stance ""no lockdowns/no masks/covid real"". fact girlfriend doctor, hear horror stories first hand I'm sure do. deny covid serious, deny needs contained, think people open scrutinizing current restrictions pushing ways optimize - instance, would 0.5% uptick covid deaths acceptable price pay 30% decrease lockdown-related suicides depression? That's arbitrary course example. think emphasis find way implement restrictions allow people leeway terms assessing risk end day.

Just kidding, use word time. It’s good conveying it’s intended to! Let's honest higher honor fired man? bring best !

It's personal responsibility snowflakes insisted knew better doctors scientists several months.


Some Trump's advisors essentially threatened people like Dr Faucci putting head pike, told people ""rise up"" governor's wanting control Covid-19.

TBH don’t need armed men enforcing mask mandates need armed men enforcing traffic laws, domestic disputes, gambling violations, marijuana usage.

Thankfully job security empty warehouse overnight shift avoid people work. plan phase 3 reopening (we currently phase 2). start everybody Bluetooth contact tracing token undisclosed number days zero cases.

Coronavirus airborne inside incredibly hardy agent remains viable even hours either floating around air **laying around** surfaces.

Once surface easily picked hands then, mouths.

That's physics it.

Then history.

Handwashing absolute best simple measure done infection control. beginning infection control. Without handwashing, usefulness masks reduced. 

Surface disinfection secondary. Disinfecting surfaces high human traffic zones must done frequently effective. Disinfecting products shelf bringing home?

I can't imagine straight months let alone weeks! 
All people following doctors politicians going health experts frustrating. 

People putting much stress medical professionals. feel sorry them. Human human production capacities planned seem larger upcoming months, important, least India Europe.

Unfortunately, delay production US political theatre, vaccines can't stored long. months, time calculate death toll delay, write nice emails US attorneys press. assume nothing. know they’re different. I’d say everyone price tag. It’s hypothetical really don’t think Disney uses bribery. They’d rather try find legal loopholes, it’s cheaper. They’d prefer spend money. Look paused cancelled Florida projects right now. Epcot torn half improvements got cancelled. positive thing Lancet article imo fact side effects seemed less older age group. still concerns side effects we're use vaccine broader scale, emergency use vaccine promising. Use vaccine soon possible high risk groups, use next generation vaccine fewer side effects achieve herd immunity. I'm sure medical workers make choice like potentially innocent person dying next room Multiple fact. heart attack, cancer,

But that's people die. There's single cause death called ""old age."" deaths something specific, whether organ failure, heart attack, on. terms comparing risks, make sense it’s dangerous share room someone infected. Good idea though extra careful though surfaces airborne-ness haha Pfizer openly admitted claims received operation warp speed assistance false. really think guaranteed 1.95 billion dollar sale logistical distribution support accounts nothing?  Recent cancer roughly double someone's mortality risk, mom 40 baseline risk 0.1%, doubling 0.2% scary might imagine, look research data. 

Air vents disperse enough virus make anyone sick, people make sick room. See notice people rooms get sick.

Best luck! Thank Numberplay Wizard. hospital Covid ICU observation unit less serious cases can't go home various reasons. They're talking turning one larger med/surg units obs Covid.

Family time added bonus.
I know people make argument insurance pays it. point here. government planning removing restrictions soon? know 50% office capacity masks mandatory everywhere (even outside). New Zealand removed vast majority restrictions weeks 0 new cases. Ah shit, goes SaraLee puddings. could say many life saving medicines unfortunately. See job job cause covid fuck around see sara lee. must get rid toxic community makes us feel like control environment safe. clue emotional need doesn’t translate mask wearing, people silly. Active virus identified frozen food package  healthy adult underlying conditions, last priority getting vaccinated. figure time get enough evidence prove whether completely safe Also Canadian, also everyone know fine it, excited fact. question this. say 95% effective people ""got covid"", 95% placebo group.

But know sure got covid didn't?

What people got covid vaccine group asymptomatic? would anyone know got it? people vaccine group symptoms either could get test got false negative result (which could 30%)??

Could mean efficacy could fact significantly lower 95%? Well. 3 go heard immunity kicks in. Another 60k deaths along that. aware, reference heads spikes said someone part site, said radio show recently. 

Like said, recently hear people calling death others based different justifications. usually something related extremists within religions, gone mainstream.

Violence never answer, might sound good, end solves nothing.

And yes, refusing help people need life saving help another form murder. someone says want work medical field that's them. say I'm care giver batch people help believe.... leads issues.

Good God. Reddit isn’t “American” website. Technically website “American” anyone world internet access see it. Exactly. watched 9/11 TV saw people jumping windows later building coming down. 

Corona deaths happening ICUs, full dramatic display. Its' several degrees removed average person. 

It's one thing see someone die, another thing hear 2nd hand. 

IMHO, that's reason people taking seriously - unless person his/her loved one gets it, far removed personal experience. Nothing wrong them, fixed deadline everybody caculate numbers certain day, deviation, official sources.

What worries high positivity rate, hinting less testing. Thank you, people start get vaccinated, I'm going follow various types vaccinations. okay now, super cautious. friend cautious asthma tested positive yesterday. makes feel even precautions still get it. looking forward hopefully coordinated response Fed soon help us all.

Yes, understand protecting patient's privacy important. we're pandemic that's killed quarter million lives. pictures overcrowded ICUs morgue trucks could saved thousands. serves us well normal times failing us crisis.

Instead allowed publish photos patients. tough spot in. call instead wish happy Thanksgiving Oh intention enforcing anything. essentially useless lifted first stay home orders. India course overtaking United States ... Late October happened ... can’t beat stupid Goodness results quick fantastic. live mind asking? think would. wear masks? get called help elderly, immunocompromised, pre existing conditions. mask. got called help us, luckily we're young healthy. got test whim? symptoms. could given 3 people ""bubble"". One sister serious lung condition. one young kids pre-existing condition know about?

How ok?

Edit add know people going get it. we've worked hard (including ""bubble"") stay safe, that's get it... seems important help keep things getting worse. come contact many people, think they'd wear masks. always go back remote learning cases showing school. nothing proposition, maybe states is. VT testing teachers month though twice month stuff kicks middle high back remote. agree though almost every person contact school. could easily spread school.  think person might little off. wouldn’t waste time arguing him. I'm probably one religious people workouts. Id play safe though lay week maybe two. Drink lots fluids, eat really good, take vitamins. covid numbers indication I'd say accurate. afraid whole thing conspiracy refuse consider vaccine. I've found good question ask see person wants information vaccine development process. basically every man, woman, child invalid themselves? Federalism, definition, shared power national state governments. Blaming federal government is, best, incomplete answer. I'm one sane states comes people actually understanding covid still mess. Indoor dining infection control, people constantly trying open schools, politically protected groups ignoring restrictions. problem people, government much drug, patient. would rules violation.

rule 2: edited titles
Titles must edited source. submissions must submitted original title submitted article applicable. article uses caps title, changed title case. Editorialization via title editing kind likely removed.

This helps ensure article's content represented accurately. 5 year old write this? Maybe you’re really quarantining that’s cool. I’m curious many people you’re talking every single one staying home two weeks? Every person works remotely never goes store? Get bigger masks. sell sizes now. Yup. full hours restored week ago. whole department (in 200 bed suburban hospital) reduced hours since March. wonderful see we'll probably soon go back 20% pay cuts time dealing multiple Covid positive patients per shift. I'm big fan less pay risk. 5^5 stop fucking posting articles pay read? man. Effective vaccines definitely panacea infectious diseases.

Polio, smallpox, measles, mumps, rubella, rabies, tetanus, hepatitis B, pertussis, diphtheria least don’t anything. “I’m vote counter, race got close gave up!” Redditors would rather complain act holier-than-though it.

That's utterly criminal. abdicate thrown. Can’t sign waiver take want? easy mode vaccine rollout well underway time cold weather returns. now, 1908 - May 12 1917 - next highest

Crazy stuff, Gone hovering around 1200, 1400 last week boom almost 2k  Eta vaccine publicly available? hope it'll great since that's vaccine country getting could discuss beer. much due testing though?

Good reminder going somewhere like grocery store, need real mask seals face filtration rating, like N95, KN95, P100. widely available again. Also make sure read package directions perform pressure check.

Bottom line is, 1/100 people contagious, someone grocery store it, droplets hang air hours. 38% US gonna get hit walkers winter important information. changes nothing. Agreed! know they've waiting make changes vote count certifications background. I've never sad ashamed country watching politicization virus response. came together 9/11, lot people come together (boomers/greatest) came together get friggin moon! screw bad? pretty much know answer still recurring thought. 

Sorry, I'm bit depressive side. 2 (more) totally avoidable Covid-19 deaths ""my world"" today watch people news article comments victim blame one pre-existing conditions, questioned ""with"" Covid19 ""of"" Covid19 died horrible death alone hospital tube throat. Lol bein cheeky Seriously stupid. even put pants on? stock market higher. Go figure. Zoom stupid Well impact, negative one though. would easier get 0 winter time.

Edit clear: agree weather helped us Victorians Given specific concern, think I'd probably make call.

You *might* want digging (maybe along folks similar conditions, know any) actual FDA filings vaccines published. would surprised intentionally included groups various COVID risk factors trial.

But either way, get it. Best luck you, hope friend weather this. :) work remotely can’t bring people died today back though.  annoying honestly point fear dangerous I'm thinking Willy Wonka saying ""please, help, alert, save us"" right never see men saw? Cancel culture hand *Florida entered chat* LA County even reported yet. We'll hit 2k today. check Jordan, managed trace fuck covid 5-6 months strict lockdown ( allowed leave home 77 days ). opened borders one border person went inside without getting checked, cases started raise tens people hundreds registering thousands per day around hundreds deaths. Really sad. Neither company yet submitted approval request. Pfizer eligible week, 60 day requirement.

A lot saying phase 3 trials well ""prescription"" authorization FDA also super inaccurate. really suggest go read process. 220. Congrats think fact people willing comply without storming state capitols long guns trying kidnap politicians suggests it’s *as* bad US.

That said, don’t pay enough attention Australia (and wouldn’t make broad generalizations begin with), maybe y’all maliciously psychotic are.

^Tell ^me ^you ^are ^so ^I ^can ^feel ^better.  Dude go see fucks sake. going regret choice. would hesitant? Worse case scenario you’re exactly unsafe would without taking vaccine numbers last 7 days putting that...


...you're disingenuous participant wants cherry pick stats **global** yearly fatality count completely unrelated disease kills handful individuals United States time period? Oh yeah buddy, reading loud clear. Try 2.5 billion losses disney parks... One mourn interact you. lucky, end killing someone care about. I'm going make pessimistic guess really fucking care all.

Thank part contributing better good humanity. 

I'm Toronto, Ontario Canada. city around 3 million around 300-400 cases day province 14.5 million currently averaging around 1400 cases per day. fair amount people wear masks either. recently, someone city found hosting 100 person gathering storage locker places. everyone really bashing Americans, important realize people make US look bad everywhere. 

They recently modelling found could experiencing 6500 new cases day Ontario December action taken now. Friday, new restrictions announced know fact Ontario entering another lockdown. premier (Canadian version Governor) addressing people every day putting health experts forefront pandemic make decisions. Regional health directors ability place restrictions cities/regions needed. Thank God politicians believe science. 

Sending hugs way, Canadian &lt;3 OUCH missread thought cases today... least make think "" point this? politicians scared be?"" much general hypocrisy one perfect truly dangerous deadly activities dont think governor would risking life. care would I? went outside good reason, would gotten ticket? He's fucking shit cunt is. body doesn’t know it’s actually threat, immune reactions, eg. fever kill invader Lol true Agree. Stupidity/Intelligence reserved certain race. culture respect though. like anything else life, respect earned. think it’s helpful know effective vaccine is. 95% great percentage; would personally feel safer going stores 95% effective vaccination. Yes anti vaxxers make herd immunity harder point idgaf them. want ventilator that’s them. planned Disney cruise set sail first week March. got back 4 days without internet covid reality. left, barely mentioned. week returned, office closed. returned. was... bit surreal. brag others many naked faces saw store.

Fck human rights yeah ? issue hypocrisy undercuts argument *some* number people stop following rules sense spite fairness something.

In reality course, two wrongs don’t make right, shouldn’t act less safe leaders do. Instead, punish politically transgressions.

But leaders aware don’t act responsible manner covid, may well end blood hands it. that, leaders actively spread guise election campaigning. democide. Effectiveness also function time. sick since thing started! dont ever want stop wearing mask! Legit. work grocery store usually I'm sick 6 times year!! love mask!!   Well appreciate effort. Washington State said goodbye Dad yesterday porch went get heart transplant.

Pfizer plans produce many doses entire year 2021. April sounds honestly good true. think I’ve subconsciously thinking there’s never going end, least end sounds amazing. like guy spare time inclination wander hospital investigate COVID real. 

He sort bring good point, although probably intentionally. think would really help people news stories actual footage people suffering COVID wards hospitals. know exploitative, numbers occasional testimonials nothing compared seeing someone barely able speak cling life. don’t want believe truth. manufacturing, distribution etc. gets first? Blah blah blah. join ship downvotes. going while. Okay take please give Well, that's disappointing nothing done. Without serious reduction spread virus likelihood half million dead reached grows higher higher. since seem want follow effective means minimizing transmission, available outcome becomes darker darker. Calling people, let alone human beings stretch. Boko Haram terrorist group invades populated areas massacres people, yeah great comparison, totally insane anything. There’s always way could get it. exposed cells produce necessary antigens, much like first stage viral infection works antibodies it. important distinction make actually altering DNA, not, sounds way scarier. 1:83, 1:1000. started mask back March people looked like weirdo, I’d prefer err side caution. Even so. chances people's good effective flu vaccine. 99% people get flu vaccine need it. actually catch flu what, they'll get it. here. unnecessary vaccine 95% people (I'm really liberally giving generous 5% either remaining 5% die become severely unwell - unlikely high). 

I, like others, take chances. mandatory restrict anybody's freedoms, way flu vaccine doesn't. I’ve lived there, Red Scare stuff doesn’t actually scare me. 

You could easily talking US here, lol. even already worst since may 13th, 10 worst since may 6th. Honestly good, need help resources elsewhere, job impossible number cases FUCKING MANY cases jobs impossible. work hospital?  “New scientific evidence emerged” - Yeah, actually already knew it. people didn’t want to. Man, humans bad judging risk. photo article features young woman concerned enough virus wears mask outside... texting head down, walks front bus.  Excuse *you*! *not* going Walmart shopping scooter breathing *carbon dioxide!* *dare* you. dare you.  use herd immunity solve brain cancer too! North Korea enough liquid international currency spare buying vaccines everyone I'm sure infrastructure expertise produce 25 million doses country even stole designs/were given designs China. support journalists pop $10 year cheap fuck. Yep. dad asked plant manager factory nobody told wear masks (this facility literally thousands people on-site average workday, shut week March), said *official word* management need wear masks ""excellent ventilation system.""

So folks believe literal consensus among doctors, scientists public health officials masks good idea wear indoors, they'll take dubious remark non-expert ventilation systems face value. FML. It’s aggravating sure typical politician behavior, *but* heartbeat I’d still take occasionally hypocritical governor actually tries control COVID one doesn’t even give shit saving lives. People say things like telling living EXTREMELY privileged bubble absolutely zero perspective “third world country” means. Amazon let happen 1st place. think comes distrust science government. many people US seem think conspiracies reason live high life someone used live Wyoming, let assure everyone lives (at least everyone met) hardcore Die hard Republican loyalist. Anything Republican party tells absolute truth, truth delivered mouth divinely gifted inspired chosen one God Almighty Republican Jesus Christ himself. 

If Trump says coronavirus fake Republican party backs Trump Wyoming residents think coronavirus fake. Period. course they're going take precautions protect themselves.

This meant attack anyone political party, statement fact someone lived long time. lord, 2 things deadlier COVID?

We need definitely address issued even greater determination.

Think lives lost. It’s great people adopted masks sick. child viral induced asthma catching simple cold give asthma attack pneumonia, really blows. always hated sending school winter months kids literally dripping boogers over. wouldn’t, family. Hehe, exact realisation recently. Weird arbitrary word ban. Freedumb.. That's why. Lawsuit? motherfucking prosecuted Yep. feel bad immunosuppressed, truly get vaccinated. spread virus lower even 1/4 population gets vaccinated, coupled whoever recovered Covid. could see least 40, 50% immunity country year. people choose get vaccinated youtube video said that, well, probably going get covid point next years. Oh well. really problem. huge issue country downright scary.

86% American cops voted Trump election.

We seeing police departments sheriffs departments even deep blue places like California saying enforce health orders.

What blatantly right wing police departments seem choosing laws enforce based politics. point lot older people high risk taking precautions seriously trying stay harm's way. sacrifice protect village idiots?

The thing continuing take precautions also helps protect healthcare workers, teachers, workers might older jobs put risk. Lmao they’re going start calling global warming lockdowns don’t care wrong thing intentionally hurting others? 

Weird flex, ok. “We’re even best Dakota!” *bookmarked* almost downvoted anger, fault right :-/ know people bitching schools closing kids super spreaders people understanding school districts can't handle cases now. Teachers staff short supply cases go means quartine simply manpower. feel iffy applying data US denmark 60,000 cumulative cases hit 12,000,000. 

They avaraging 1,000 cases per day rn, 165,000

I believe study conducted environment covid spread far wide results would come different. 

And masks apply common sense really

If sneeze without mask, droplet goes air, covid19 waits someone walk through. sneeze mask, droplet stays you. everyone wesars masks. less viral load released person it. person walks droplets arez receive little viral load. 
Even receive viral load, they're symptoms dieseas far lighter without mask 

And plan, nothing let hospitals run doctors choose lives dies vaccine makes everyone, projected time line well 2021 Minus last chapter *so far* Don’t forget Black Friday entire holiday season smashed together. It’s probably lot that. lot more. FYI, super-far-back-feels-like-it’s-hitting-your-brain swab isn’t necessary anymore. place went, widespread drive testing Phoenix, listed clearly website early pandemic deemed necessary sure getting good sample longer needed swab much lower nose. got done twice, swirl 10seconds side-not bottom nostril barely that. Mostly uncomfortable socially somebody swirling something nose lol.  also said cheek swab effective unless specially request nose-I assume help protect them, nose ask pull mask nose keep mouth covered beds chicagoland business usual. ideas coming angry people days ages, show extreme anger hate demands peoples heads, good.

I agree extreme anger hate bad, ""demands peoples heads"" kind accountability us demanding, loudly forcefully necessary. 

Why mayor, governor, senator, etc., remain office screwing response covid? recalling politicians pressuring resign, instead mumbling voting next election. 

So good thing demand accountability elected leaders. us this. I've literally seen 3 brands life. Huh? NM first like 4-5 months ago, sent two last month so. Statewide.  August. I'd expected go.  


Love username former Lancastrian living KC. ! ready stir shit election time . She’s got blood hands . anything you’re worried people won’t agree mask mandate cause want get re-elected leadership . Do- nothing leadership isn’t leadership. It’s costing lives think that’s comes too. It’s public health that’s part job. It’s question freedom anymore . freedoms , injure endanger someone else endanger someone else’s health wear mask. It’s iron lung . saw thing people dumping ice heads ALS 2014 won’t wear mask 2020. hold door , neighboorly things won’t wear mask protect neighbors germs. Blows mind. None frontrunners need that: need convince immune system mount response we're hijacking parts natural viral production chain. Damn...I ain’t heard Piggly Wiggly since 1994 Georgia. Piss lol wish well. Many people believe hoax. don’t think cure that. long go bars eat six times week would I? *laughs Iowa* happens many doctors nurses get 😢 bad. Viral videos make look awful views. think it’s natural xenophobia authoritarian tendencies. Look food import dog quarantine rules. offense, meant piss take truth early August COVID-19 appears take longer spread low population density areas. would happen weeks places like NYC happen months sparsely populated regions. I’m leaving profession almost 12 years, fought decision scary experience March day finally made decision administrator said “why buying N95’s?! They’re 40 cents KN95’s even way expensive, maybe surgicals bit.” Thats realized life could possibly worth 40 cents. cried every day that, bought supplies eventually took home job right became hybrid facility, think residents end day think time... hard would need let people die. mom worked surgery years. always saw humanity people told imagines everyone loved one strives give care would want family. love people like can't let die (especially kids). someone died, always affected her. think lot people health care like that. Yup, one Right, study based theoretical numbers. 

Lets see reality - country basically large scale test population, testing 3,6 million citizens (out 5,5 million) Slovakia. results found 1,06% infected - 38 000 people, asymptomatic. shows numbers infected likely nowhere near 17% level claimed study. 

We basically need get comfortable idea, even include asymptomatic carriers, get much higher number getting currently. Definitely 10-15x higher number. care much. Now, I've turned fucking Adrian Monk. Every time walk sink, HOUSE, wash hands. Fucking hell. /rantover push make bigger parties, larger crowds... Coz freedom! hospitals workers tell fucktards go home enjoy freedom instead wasting time risk lives save them. bad imagine vaccines start take effect. Half buildings district remote December due latest many outbreaks...since kids went back **full time, 5 days week** August. 

The options full remote full class, kid home. school shut *least* due COVID. absolutely infuriating. highest death rate saw early pandemic what, ~2,500/day?

We're close now. pathetic. North Dacrona? 🤷‍♂️ like prime ribeye medium-rare. Thanks. wherever be. It’s tough days. Stay well. Pfizer CEO sold stock announcement. smell rat. pump dump scheme. Uke’s worried husband, Matthew, prayers answered 16 days later came coma began road recovery, told Metro.

The Birmingham City Hospital doctor since reunited babies, husband, two children – Nnamdi Ronald, 12, Chisimdi Claire, 11.

“Coming home real healing point me,” said. “The family together, we’re very, happy.” Even trials, people vaccinated got sick. Pfizer even severe case vaccine arm. Ironically, recent vaccine news going mean big trouble hospitals nationwide next several months. LOL. It’s bad North Dakota. rapid saliva tests people like Michael Mina talking months months now?

Is FDA listening experts?

Those kinds instant-result covid tests could bought bulk dollars each. want use 99.997% rate? used one A) redditors fall to, B) within median average age American population. 

And yeah that’s argument hospital capacity. honestly bought idea March/April. cry wolf many times. paraphrase r/covid19 commenter, much shock value social capital public government public health official. burnt last 8 months. It’s running empty. Conditions aren’t bad 2018 articles. blinded data facts spring. look past, resolute beliefs. 1918 pandemic, 2009 H1N1 2018 flu season reinforced beliefs, tampered them. 

Most healthcare workers know(I used attend college lot nursing students) busy putting MLM stuff FB feed posting random stuff friends weddings. also happen live one worst states US. None them, mean zero putting depressing public pleas mask whatever feed. realize it’s anecdotal it’s got. 

Besides, crossroads far caring. care millions people service travel industries work, go homeless, depressed state? I’ll honest “what healthcare immune compromised people” carries much weight entire industry falling apart. willing fall sword spring good country. I’m willing fall sword Increasingly smaller smaller group people US, definitely months end. shit Yes, mental health worse across board domestic violence incidents rise. (Source work Crisis Line). Official data/research studies lag collecting data getting research takes time. 

But can't assume lock happen. People would still strain pandemic emotionally economically. Plenty people would remain escalating domestic violence situations pandemic makes leaving risky. Easing lock protocols would trading small gains one issue bigger losses somewhere else since lot people would get sick. fair though...their complaints without merit. However, spreading covid way handle grievances prior generation. would thought ""Freedom!"" would downfall? timeline normal late april, schools already taking finals Last heard, Aussie wasn’t flash states SA government support citizens lockdown? accepted SA perceived possible US???? IHME model trash af handpicked/sharpied 🥭. shit predicting 60k dead summer, it’s basically lower bound. We’re going 400k feb life ruin case skin getting upset daily paper tape, look barrier film--it's made several companies, like alcohol wipe liquid creates barrier skin adhesive, helps prevent skin unhappiness helping tape stick better. Great stuff delicate skin around wounds, figure it'd work well way too! Immunosuppressed people also tend shed virus longer periods time.  They're dumbasses, holding wedding size GOING wedding size. That's viruses work. color code hosts. Yeah Trump responsible worldwide pandemic, France fault. /s Fingers crossed LAPD murder black man. comply red light understand one would able drive everyone ignored it. somehow wearing mask different. Literally every law ever written takes away liberty live freely Constitution United States.

That's whole point laws. guy applied one jobs world whose purpose take away people's freedoms he's bitching it?

America gets scarier every day. who’s fault ppl betting shit? Lol people got really bad side affects. Others pain numbness nausea vomiting. last 1 day others lasted longer week. also red give brain damage peoples brain process development e.g children. Kinda scary tho. review order attached, clearly states, 

""Nothing Order precludes evictions based tenant, lessee, resident: (1) Engaging criminal activity premises; (2) threatening health safety residents;  (3) damaging posing immediate significant risk damage property; (4) violating applicable building code, health ordinance, similar regulation relating health safety; (5) violating contractual obligation, timely payment rent similar housing-related payment (including non-payment late payment fees, penalties, interest).""

In words, order CDC prohibits eviction non-payment rent eviction without cause. two cases handling involve criminal activity threats health safety residents. such, nothing order precludes evictions pursuing. Nevertheless, SF Sheriff refuses levy. backfire free kill others? Got it. turns I'm ""right""

Narrator: ""He wasn't."" lmao. like tagged good news worked meat processing plant assembly line summer. different company took good care employees lot’s covid safety. still dangerous though, guy lost arm machine another guy broke leg. Also worked like 16hrs day. worked 25hrs straight. economy, train wreck too, rich guys tour workplace. accurate, less viral shedding sure respiratory volume assume people continue downvote science like. Oh sure think it’s hoot. I’m glad don’t mindset although I’d probably surprised many people think way. tip plastic bag trunk weigh something come outside Evidence even without symptoms showing, virus leaving scarring damage kidneys, lungs organs. 

I fear 10-20 years line see rise people organ failures diseases traced back covid infection. 


As age polish starts wear various body parts, stuff starts happen. leak would way knowing 

/s Publishing study journal methodological flaw. making outlandish claims would absolutely rewrite everything know virus (and way fight it) wanna publish Lancet, third-rate paywalled local ""journal"". Narcolepsy? Wtf dude? It’s fucking vaccine cartoon witch potion. Certain masks, sure. crap cloth ones people have? would never walk place cloth mask reasonably sure someone infected. real number way higher that. really atleast widely available. Sure may get approved there's going limited supply reserved healthcare workers vulnerable first. mention 2 doses per person distributing vaccine take while. We're looking months alot people really able get vaccine like around mid 2021. yes vaccine way things wont change day 1  though. plenty options choose from, conveinemt accessible, people use them. free use stores online aspect certainly search engines. mistake conveinence accessibility monopoly. So...it's dangerous, masks work, social distancing work either. he's saying?

He also say makes hurt. wear case? opinion topic fomite transmission, post lie. 

Cuomo talking people isolating people went out. 

He clarified multiple times sub purposely misconstrued ran it. You’ve literally taken propaganda spreading yourself. Smallpox back. getting confused measles. I've seen obvious high risk antimaskers buying lottery tickets crazy me. Ive gas stations town go safest one. lot places workers dont wear masks. get gas week. still see stuff. Hurray? 78% say take it. It’s pretty now. staring worst winter century overwhelmed hospitals cratering economy. It’s inevitable. I’ve heard Amazon used verb recently, disconcerting.  focus societal liberties instead?

Like forcing people inject something will? Um what? one forced take vaccinations Canada.  place moderated like north korea. [federal executive apply? biology said sounds like indeed something serious study included. think virologists would follow paper probably would hear soon. Reddit hivemind believes magic masks save us latest scourge. Mask mandates force western Europe results much US. rather step back reevaluate whether actually work, tendency blame one guy saw Walmart nose sticking three weeks ago latest surge. point religious level devotion. Woven textiles around tens thousands years upper respiratory viruses around since first human born. yet April year conclude fabrics stop viruses? Yes, people believe that. is. anyone ever take IHMEs numbers seriously though?

IHME also one point said 30,000 deaths coronavirus august USA back March 500 dying every day.

IHMEs data useless, inaccurate, numbers every single one predictions way off.  People silly ^This true. 
I see personally lot friends. know covid19 real, take precautions, perspective feels like lost cause. 
They assume they're safe go bar because, well old jimmy eats restaurant thinks covid19 hoax probably already exposed them. Yes. That's run successful growing business. don’t even understand English retarded bot. Exxon gas station since Valdez, BP since Deepwater Horizon. know essentially impact actual companies hurts independent franchisees, going fly company flags (or Confederate Nazi flag matter) I'm taking business elsewhere.

Boycotting massive conglomerates something else, though. everywhere make everything. gets posted one seems care Covid US long deemed pandemic. December 2019 know many others well. probably haven’t worked hospital yet, still plenty time change minds ever loving fuck would vengeful deny someone changes mind vaccine? Every person getting vaccine protect also everyone already vaccinated. denying vaccine would endanger vulnerable members society endangering sticking basic hygene rules.... Thats definitely fair. expect much stricter lock stuff take place next week. 

Could definitely wrong would tell mind-changing stories could. Unfortunately, families talking tell story due embarrassment. Plus, grieving. hope answer US. normally acceptable uptake vaccine use without resorting mandatory vaccination. 95% efficacy, actually need everyone get shot Herd immunity. true. Especially, Korea allows Chinese could prove tested negative China visit Korea mandatory screening required display symptoms. 

Not mention persons visit Korea China Chinese nationals. 

For instance, September 5 persons China tested positive 3 Chinese 2 Korea. [http://www.newdaily.co.kr/site/data/html/2020/09/08/2020090800191.html](http://www.newdaily.co.kr/site/data/html/2020/09/08/2020090800191.html)

Given China reports handful cases, clear China lying number, also testing also flawed. Sad say, it’s time get nursing find another way make living. Hospitals keep every nurse dead. million people. MILLION people! cases SKYROCKETING. 

The vaccine news great won’t cure this. 

People dumb. national productivity going taking MAJOR hit majority cases “I’m young it’s fine get it” demographic. Another leak side American ship slowly sinks. Bodycams nurses? Hey now, New Brunswickers anti vaccine crazies lol. wouldn’t quick take fact. local government Victoria said same
Thing nurses despite lack generally wide spread prevalence virus community.

For reference, 15% (3000) cases belong health aged care workers yet total cases state 1 300 population, mean statistically we’d expressed 10 HCW’s pick community. That's thing well. sure testing contact tracing. really incredible Tokyo huge outbreak yet. That's testament wide mask usage healthier community wrong belief widespread Sweden. 

Off course responsible government could done much beginning. finally latest restrictions. Restrictions Tegnell says based advice - listen 2 minutes interview: article also confirms current events documents number examples unrelated corona proving swedish government often follow advice authorities experts: reasonable human (which us are)

I think issue... kind ignoring fact people Hong Kong elsewhere comply restrictions. could implement restrictions US today gigantic part country comply making useless. negligible compared consequences measures taken combat virus. Soooo... one full face snorkling masks visor removed? thank you. coworker 15 people thanksgiving. said it’s immediate family (they al live separately) it’s okay. really 'Exclusive'. knew ordered way many doses Trudeau already commited giving away extras. scrub surfaces there's way scrub air. germs surfaces spread diseases types, including Flu Covid? 

Covid spread via airborne particulate. also spread think direct contact, direct contact often produces lower rate infection talk airborne more. Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas New Years, one right other... one super spreader event other.

The US properly thoroughly fuuuuuuucked. forgot add ""woefully"" title. would surprised
I’ve seeing Quebec Ontario license plates Florida recently people still fly countries Mathematicians, Please. May make ecuation containing variables, please?. Overpopulation, global resources, extreme global warming, advanced robotics (workers needed per activity) determine acceptable level global ""stress""?. Now, put numbers equalized sistem reduce damage. Could fit coronavirus numbers?. Thanks couple weeks, right Thanksgiving see even bigger surge cases, fact people gonna stop Thanksgiving routine cause expert recommended so. surprised lots health care staffs calls quit local health care infrastructure collapse. 3% fatality rate isn’t necessarily low. Also, look statistics thousands people 15-35 died Covid. Yes, chances smaller still taken lives healthy people 20s. Truth is, Covid truly seem affect everyone differently even you’re rockstar gym young still kill you. It’s worth taking risk almost 300,000 people unnecessarily died. F.

And even close F. Like ""how get less 50% true false?"" F. Bullshit. sue China then? also taking reservations December funerals? typically case be. Eh. Honestly...I insanely busy college. Far adult full-time job. work, internships, classes, extra curricular activities, 12-14 hour days ordinary. grad student, semester full course-load, assistantship, two internships...while planning wedding. (10/10, recommend.)

Responsibilities make break adult, I'll grant that. college friends joke seriously took everything. But, also agree aspects post-college life free. Right now, way time available adult. Now, going change we're expecting. Sometimes don’t even know piss people reddit, happens. get wanting talk people, seems like... torturing yourself? potentially get know someone like knowing intention meet person another year ever. I’ve never really used dating apps knows. talked months months. actually implemented ? cares, anybody bit brain cross Swiss-cheese like border. agree entirely. hand, better idea getting pieces shit behave? hospitals could list denialist choose turn away easily. Someone math week ago made r/all. numbers single county though, entire state. LMAO can't postpone Black Friday can't postpone New Year's Eve. Hoping see serious push back thats case mean anti mask people Thank you.

I'm immunologist, protocol flying pandemic is: DON'T. appreciate editing add cutter incident. Good luck. believe would worse case scenario point, many health experts believe typical person wants vaccinated able get vaccinated around LA county alone 5000 cases today. mean could , don’t think saline causes muscle pain tenderness injection site well 2 days ""scientific community"" specific group virus downplayers monopolized sub use science excuse promote bais. plenty scientists agree perspective. Without Don, comedic value. remember used ""99% vs. 1%"" stuff, thinking answer everything common people rise throw elite something. depressing wake-up call lot ""regular people"" bad. Reducing new daily cases single digits. think biggest problem internet echo-chamber nature it. everyone interact believes you, genuinely aghast could people agree. Plus, echo-chambers radicalize everyone wants make ""exciting"", upvoted post. /r/confidentlyincorrect know downvoted. Guess reddit dating expert**™** crowd. 

I mean I've got two theories- 1. polite way effectively saying (no one's going wait year know it, can't remember name person hooked year ago I'm going remember fucker talked two hours bumble), 2. person bored enjoys courting process, without necessarily wanting date. Extroverts get live best run world normal time. suck year two. Can't concentrate hobby alone time need run mouth constantly receive feedback every five minutes taste judge with? That's personal problem, like social anxiety suffer work every day fault own, put food table. know join group chat kind time like run mouth 24 hours straight wanted? *revelation. There’s 1 downvoted...it means:

""May God protect everyone virus arrival vaccine"" You’re absolutely right. one seems focusing bringing constant flow fresh air rooms.

Every store restaurant doors open fans running continuously well people entertain indoors. People going gather Thanksgiving like gathered Easter, even though actual lockdown there. addresses problem instead pretending Thanksgiving cancelable event.  one goal post another TRYING POST REMOVAL

This knew real national emergency would happen started developing central States. LA officials must really stupid can’t even come reasons listed. It’s almost like pandemic response designed upper income, college educated knowledge workers savings investments; experts designed plan appears work people like fails higher needs fewer assets. Maybe least natural selection get rid religious nuts Canada even contribute anything significant vaccine research? right approach, like hard-line draw drugs US vs Portugal approach ""we know happens, here's make less bad""

Just ventilation 2 open windows would probably cut transition disease significant amount. LA County reporting 5,000 new cases today far. Shattering previous records. Asian countries handling better non-Asian countries, though. Remember “pro-life” crowd. “Temporarily” reasonable said 2 weeks flatten curve 10 months later end sight. “asking adjust” reasonable asked us wear mask, obliterate small business owners, ruin education, cause suicides/domestic violence skyrocket. Among family friends across several states here’s goes down: 

They wear masks go stores. 

They wear masks go outdoor things okay according state officials. 

They wear masks work. 

They socially distance strangers part. 

And go parties homes masks cuz it’s coworkers, right? go book club someone’s house. Play &amp; someone’s house. Bible studies someone’s house. Start workout groups friends meet other’s houses. Turn home haunted house Halloween year invite neighborhood. Celebrate Diwali...at home 50 people crammed in. won’t say invited wedding. 

And that’s covid spreads, people host things home one wears masks events. Finland like six months ago use airport. Finnish dogs got posted like 500 times. kinda joke care care themselves? let reap sow Dude fucking serious lying that's said 100% admitted 60 fucking minutes national television watch god dam interview self. words mouth yes lied masks effective begging pandemic save front line workers holy shit deaf words interview broadcast across globe fucking dense.  parking lot?   Check IQ air filters, pretty sweet come different styles purposes. 5 would cost 5 grand though. 🤑 Dude actually pretty good - like switching earlier time suggestions. even clear - started feel sick Wednesday, November 4th, started feel better yesterday, November 18th. 

I test last month job, negative test October 7th, 10th October 16th, ensure clear international flight. :) You’re applying logic argument devoid logic. honest don’t think anything says strange. end take time vaccinate people. think May-June everything open vaccine out, follow ""it's hoax"" routine, decline get vaccinated really hurting themselves. That's really best case scenario. Darwin awards around. Yes, know probably horrible care them...but year this, caring care exhausted.  proven reinfections 10 times 20 times higher, would still rare.

A lot that... Washington state alone, there's 120 suspected reinfections.  short timespan months pandemic, sure vast majority people fully immune reinfection catching first time.

Then better tell authors data wrong data show full immunity majority people. Especially comes IgA mucosal antibody neutralizes antibodies upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 sets shop. meant kind reinfection pontenital severe first one. 

More cases confirmed reinfection clinical outcomes shown severe less severe. get covid experience severe symptoms like pneumonia 1 2 weeks, 1 year later catch T-cells experience light headache one day, would say degree immunity.

​If relying cells COVID-19, going disappointed. Again, CD8 cells dropped 5 months 36% individuals. trajectory downward vast majority people cells. read think point although people seem lose cellular immunity months, majority rate decline cells slow, predicting may last years.

The rate decline slow. Look paired samples Figures 3c 3e CD8 cells. That's rapid fall off, especially spike protein. makes sense use Figure 3b 3d calculate decline contextualized individual rates decline rapid. removed thinking part brain,.... news water continues wet. one made realization early pandemic good you.

but say, I'm really sure long hold out. I've trapped home 7 months, job duties exploding company really trying hurl selves cliff good reason, kids need attention reasonably give working, end day sit kind numb. contact tracing gonna help right now? gonna lie, would absolutely watch it. Canada lot ice. think sub Realists. virus raging metros Macy big retailers operate, measures exist prevent hospitals turning away patients, lockdowns last resort. Extreme circumstances require extreme measures.

At point trying flatten curve bring case rates down. We're sprint prevent total collapse regional health systems. couple weeks, non-covid patients triaged emergency room door. ER director feel like make full recovery they're going try hard need bed someone younger &amp; healthier pull through. we're facing next month. ""It is."" -Orangeman I’m pretty sure yeah might little setback year two GDP wise whatever lots people seem think really think needs extensive trials release. Long term effects need studied pump vaccine en masse. Who? Basically good ventilation co2 less 500 ppm, bad ventilation 1000 ppm. air lingers long enough build co2 building aerosols too.  It’s funny Newsom risks getting Covid dining indoors rich buddies prohibits average citizen deciding risks want take. deal people exercise basic cautions (face masks, sanitation, avoiding large groups, etc.).

At point, probably close entire country month get things control (United States). trouble is, people still need pay bills buy food. forcing people stay home full month going anything bankrupt hundred million Americans. Without comprehensive plan place protect people financially, forced stay home orders closures businesses unlikely solve problem. 

I'm sure well Canada front. keeping that. efficient.

Maybe policy leave dead rotting pile somewhere. least people take seriously. would cruel deceased loved ones, least might prevent hundred thousand people dying **on top 150k people probably die latest outbreak**. ones officials say ignored enforced. midst pandemic.

On hand, I'd guess many deaths occur outside ICU (for example, nursing homes). Shawn Hannity? Keep expectations low. Regardless full support everyone wears mask countrymen's lives depended it. History treat people accordingly. genuinely heroic. People think power giant conglomerates, really vote wallet. Might true, might not. idea; says shit. independent review boards. FDA review it. Canada EU review it. Multiple vaccines showing similar efficacy. evidence suggesting ever came light would torpedo drug company.

Short answer: way exaggerated, time needle going arm. Explain instead childish insults  usually right thing stop trying. capitalists  literally part problem.

WHO’s Global Fund provided $50 million COVID-19 Response Mechanism help countries begin purchasing tests. Africa Centres Disease Control Prevention Unitaid, nongovernmental organization, began rollout tests 20 African countries October 2020. Foundation Innovative New Diagnostics supporting research determine best practices using tests low- middle-income countries.

“High-quality rapid tests show us virus hiding, key quickly tracing isolating contacts breaking chains transmission,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, PhD, MSc, said statement. “The tests critical tool governments look reopen economies ultimately save lives livelihoods.”

i want get virus either, please act like death sentence. need leaked report report really know this. Uh, gotta ask... bag used for? Unless register every 5-8ft within hurricane force air extraction air exchange, nothing right work. 
By gravity alone, respiratory droplets drop floor.  
Current technology right make droplets hang air often not. So, mechanical air circulation worse air circulation. 
Typical installs registers close diffusers spread droplets even further.  
While one pushing droplets upwards making aerosolized, pushing new clean air. However, air extracted less circulating aerosolized droplets even further.  


How solve this? 
Humidify air + Registers floor diffusers ceiling gravity helping you. Filtered air pushing down, thus making droplets aerosolized droplets heavier weight capture air floor registers. Humidity air make aerosolized droplets catch humid air push even more. gravity's help, even need high airflow exchange machines. 


But no, expensive, according them. So, right they're increasing CFM airflow. do? Making aerosolized droplets infected individuals hang air travel further. we've gotten better treating covid since March/April lowers death rate     lockdowns temporary fix close sent out.

The alternative locking masks social distancing eating outside ordering takeout working home self-quarantining contact tracing rapid testing. People want wear masks end locking down. hard figure out. 

But thing is, know full shit. ""parties street"" happened exactly 1 day, two weeks ago. Yes, they're likely increased spread. What's point? Get new fucking talking point try keep up, unless want lock election day parties.

Get people wear masks. mean saying. Personal freedom comes personal responsibility.  Except ignoring rules put place Adelaide. reasons leave home currently except go shopping. one person per household per day. drug companies study ? Az?

Nobody staying home without stimulus checks job security. selfish own, staying inside hard enforce, especially essential jobs. 

Our politicians literally holding lives hostage make money suffering. time treat level dignity show us. It’s Marshmallow Test grown-ups. opinions equally valid. No. opinion stupid based fact.

Fact: 250,000 dead Americans.

Fact: Masks &amp; distance reduce spread.

Fact: Fact based consistent messaging reduces spread misinformation. 750 bucks? Sorry loss New York opens won’t covid Yeah lost 30-50k dollars tuition get back. Also good luck getting another college that.

The college deny responsibility.  I've unemployed live alone. leave house like week go shopping. anything everyone else store risk them. vulnerable people staying home exposed. Lol move along dude, obviously talking ass. called biontech ""true inventor"" said ""Pfizer could never make vaccine"" ""they're providing funding,"" clearly knowledge industry. 

""Developing vaccine"" incredibly easy, that's mRNA vaccines Moderna Pfizer first vaccines approved. know took Moderna less 2 weeks ""develop it."" add unique genetic sequence spike protein vaccine technology they're licensing Penn. FYI make look dumber, genetic sequence also found academics, Biontech. Agreed. Trump sore loser helping transition, Biden going behind gets sworn in. effort make party look bad. wouldn’t care much wasn’t pandemic. point, results key. Also, think many forgotten tax break expires increase. basically loan. Obviously get first, lost second half. That’s terrible idea. Yes know. Plus would also ones say don’t need vaccine. shutdown Texas. Nope can’t strict quarantine rules like Australia makes big difference Would somewhat comforting framed one death every area 2500 square kilometres? understand people. folks basically acting like nothing different, insane

And people KNOW different forge ahead anyways, maybe hygiene theater make feel better it


It's day. Thanksgiving favorite holiday. fuck's sake, throw towel year's holidays make sure Grandma Aunt Phylis actually alive next year's gathering Yes, understand agree, however, counterintuitively getting Covid people rampantly spreading it. need control spread control deaths. know vaccines start vunerable first, however, need realistic accept rate infection drop quickly.

I know we're vaccinated we'll giant Thanksgiving dinner family - *no matter day month is* - we'll want celebrate surviving. Premature celebration long history working out. said avoided able responsible mitigation.  said last resort. 

And remember said that, Covid skeptic friends said “See thinks lockdowns don’t work”  

No saying need see nuclear option. Yep partner got rapid test negative morning doctor got non-rapid test take night positive 🤷🏻‍♀️  met CEO? thankful mother retired nursing hospital August. extremely high risk hospital keeping staff separated (would employees Covid floor one day floors next), also would test quarantine asymptomatic employees prolonged exposure confirmed cases without protection.  work covid tester alma mater, we're testing students leave. 
We also random testing program every day 1,500 students would algorithmically selected tested. far we've seen super minor breaks, halloween ~35 infections course two weeks, one two students gotten live campus. 

The university's goal send everyone home negative test, remain untill spring semester starts back up. institutions see little risk.

I mean, Denny's figured out-- one would ever go restaurant ""old people discount"". think change American behavior, good luck going happen December we’ll seeing complaints online like “my wife sick, Uncle Joey, Aunt Janie, Uncle Roy, Aunt Kathleen, Grandma, Great Aunt Martha kids sick hospital says don’t room treat us! WTF?!” followed blame-dodging saying hospitals prepared better taking personal responsibility. Ok keep wrong.

But don’t complain people sick new restrictions. bet they’re getting tired winning. ::pikachu face:: problem fixes itself. potential vaccines help reduce negate serious/all complications COVID19 anywhere 90-95% around corner think do? Throw mega-party sure bring neighbor. America. sigh...are 70 yo sickly shit? Wouldn’t much useful could compare common places visited negative test?

Come on, isn’t rocket science. think Italy weeks ahead wave, certainly demographics play part. Italy's population skews older US. maskers treated traitors spies. Bunch malingering turds trying free ride others work keep posting across several posts everything pointless, makes feel like want us fail trying normalize following rules give stop trying fight virus.

We're giving we're going keep trying, hopeless. That’s arrogant thing seen long time. easily dismissed shockingly numerous examples contrary pandemic alone. 

I wary STEM majors, particularly display arrogance, experience over-represented vile extremist forces ever displeasure encountering. NY’s cases death happened right start pandemic didn’t know much virus including spreads treat it. locked implemented masks social distancing, cases went way NY actually lowest case counts country. 

Other states cases surging right now, like South Dakota, literally months advance notice implement safety measures prevent spread not. again, information clearly evident anyone isn’t intentionally trying make excuses Donald Trump’s horrible lack leadership. Please stop listening whatever BS news sources listening to. People dying. dates timelines keep getting pushed closer closer. I’m pretty optimistic. people think Canadians like Americans pretty point 
Some may actually think Canada part USA lol
But side note nobody views Canadians foreigners weird happens let Jared Ivanka play government. Yay!!  Right sure feels like we're Westeros Bolton rule. soon genuinely appreciate willingness work trying times. encourage everyone, possible, leave kids home. time family shopping trips. I've lost count many posts I've remove today. Stop spreading misinformation sub. know right loss mitigation standpoint, sucks many idoitc pieces shit can't band together prevent loss happening first place. continue climbing every week hospital capacity reached. Long reached, however, hit wall testing capacity.

At point accurate measure viral spread death totals, they're lagging indicator weeks. can’t blame people wanting end pandemic.  I'm still expecting FDA take beat (I think like week) re-check everything looks good. yes, point FDA much aware data concerns already aired companies, already addressed actively finishing responses now. source this? got Pfizer trial vaccine would great know got placebo vaccine. Nah, think will. *I'm photo like it* back now? Shhh, making much sense! /s Thanks! I'm going buy one.Too bad stock while. feel you. 


It hard culture, that's conditioned think either-or, there's objective reality ascertain contrasting things equally. pandemic really exacerbated problem. large number people even understand concept objectivity anymore. miss going movies :( local theater closed almost year really hope make it. love mindset much. actually helping look forward it. thank wise words Home prices gotten insane even low cost areas. I’m Kansas City mo housing market crazy. actually process building new home legit couldn’t find home already built. put offers 9 homes got outbid everytime since sell current home people cash offers lived apartment didn’t buy sell. Also current home bought 160k back 2011 putting market next week 270k. realtor expects us sell week less 300k huge housing shortage(our home nothing special either it’s good school district 23 years old needs work). Also new home 440k(we put offer already frame august)they selling house 3 lots size yard 500k material prices gone much(mostly wood)! It’s crazy I’ve never seen anything like it. Agree disagree. Yep I've thinking same. undermine excellent response countries Asia fact single country Asia major outbreak (to knowledge) hard believe without factors involved. That’s almost 5th population...by January?!

I’m trying get carried away amazing news surely? States never imposed strict restrictions don’t listen data doctors. Doubt they’ll start real mandatory restrictions now. ""People *so* COVID"", ""This-or-that politician following restrictions"", ""we're *protest* COVID"", ""it's overblown"", etc.

Honestly, shame bullshit protection respiratory viruses. We'd 100% covered. want take risks health whatever potentially gave others. cool. Interesting. idea slow? Agreed. also helps overpopulation issue deer. Best luck there, safe! one person say similarities outside language

... Sorry yes, speculating reinfection accounted for. could point article provides evidence this, would science. could course right, articles virus seem point opposite direction (this one included).

And example Korean analysis tested virus replication, different strains (I'll try find it). find trace active virus.

Interesting article shared there, read end sure. talks seasonal coronaviruses, know example immunity SARS long lasting. So, SARS-2? articles seem point 2° direction. I’m okay masks stuff places around nation world went locked down, yet didn’t work. shouldn’t time try something different?

We explosion cases start term numbers quite low. wise pirate said, “They’re like guidelines actual ~~rules~~ commandments.”  That’s don’t know you’re talking about.

One day hopefully loved ones still living, hope people openly PROUDLY acted foolishly recklessly wearing masks throughout pandemic realize never view again. hope shamed rest lives. 

No, couldn’t saved everyone EVERYONE America wore masks followed guidelines huge percentage died COVID-19 would still alive today cannot forgive fucking pieces trash know refuse something small covering face combat this. No, it’s normal everywhere. isn’t southern thing It’s both. Hear, hear! even live South Dakota feel way. want punch face every time see it. Get profit, let pesky thing like human rights get way. They're human capital capitalism, baby! Better shut 6 days stop spread let fester 3 weeks partial lockdown eventually kill economy hundreds people goes control months.

Victoria always 2 weeks behind dealing spread, SA want repeat mistakes. Thank you. Signed, New Yorker. People comment voice, that's life. Can't censor everything.

I totally agree [Famous Dolly movie, young one. Jesus countrymen embarassing Hang fucks Someone tell ""heard immunity,"" please. Currently, North Dakota rate 18.2 COVID deaths per million people. 

No. 18.2 deaths per million people **per week**. oath harm. mean sign oath sacrifice life. least understand. 2019 far best year life far 2020 constant unending blur lockdown depression loneliness. definitely way better lot people man, cant help thinking entire year life gonna go drain almost completely wasted. know means. You’re playing dumb purpose. I've gathered, Noem sincerely believes bullshit saying. posted self-congratulatory article weeks ago, claiming hands-off approach best. Yes, acted early wisely. actually great job.

However, islands allowed forcibly detain people quarantine sustainable. (You need both)

Australia refuge island prison years...

America get away that. even close. It’s still stage thing. think people stage 3 4, know show long that’ll get vaccine virus? Sure, fairy tales like.  made housemates watch Trump got power... Yup jump woodchipper. lot less painful. Abbotts wife hispanic 😂 I’ve fortunate live three different health care systems. India - totally free market, Japan - nationalized single payer, US - bastardized system insurance equated heath care. 

All three issues gaps. also benefits. pretend healthcare simple issue wrong. could agree “grass greener” statement more. effective policy contention this, find somewhat dubious society peak pandemic would continue normally either via government regulation self regulation stay away sick Trouble is, lockdown control borders. point locking people come go country moment open again. 38%?  stat post Thanksgiving going even worse. understand question. teach mask really affect hearing. think rely reading lips realize. Also, mask muffle saying. really visit someone, yes  I'll speak someone get vaccinated right away, even though vaccinations. 

I history blood clots/DVT. Covid, probably heard, causes plenty blood clotting issues ton folks. put blood thinners hospital. see solid research particular covid vaccine done people prior history blood clotting, feel comfortable getting it. I'm getting one million person live nightmare again....or die pulmonary embolism. I'm equally scared get covid, kill permanently disable due blood clotting. feel like good route point time. 

Same friend diabetes. supposed do? planning research folks high risk categories? understand many vaccines developed actually put small amount coronavirus you, still worry body impact certain groups. 

Very curious hear anyone medical/viral research background ""high risk"" Covid-19 groups. Maybe ignorant mechanics vaccines, tentatively okay hang back watch vaccinations play out. USSR isn’t around anymore otherwise everybody suitable task!

The fixation US broken - took leadership lot topics kind new European doctrine increase European leadership independence us. Unless different strains exist becomes like flu..

- fellow essential worker Yeah knew anything Australia (fucking amazing place aside) wouldn’t said silly, sweeping statement like “the western countries learned good parts eastern culture”. Wth even mean?  don’t think saying would really reassure people specifically concerned first mRNA based vaccine. vaccine makes cells produce viral spike would legitimate concern regarding possibility triggering autoimmune disorders, [letter BMJ Dismissing concerns claiming prior vaccines safe doesn’t really address all.

Honestly lot due messaging rapidly we’re getting vaccines market. doesn’t matter. It’s inevitably decisively ending Variolation vaccination, intentional infection. 

RIP smallpox. shouldn’t protect right promote stupid shit. Doesn’t matter one bit state government federal government calling test results. It’ll cluster responses either way. Americans trust whatsoever disclosing private information. Anyone thought otherwise fantasy world Part full medical record full medical record... unionize strike. country literally views fuel burned stay warm. bring thing that’s ruining them. can't wait see partying streets around world day pandemic officially declared ended citizen Florida teacher here, say absolutely many others want Try resting. worked hard multiple days row right recovering basic cold felt like shit, Maybe take gentle walk. case, would Disney announced shut back March New York State did? yes, they’re related. NYS first 10% close non essential business Disney them. 

If bribing politicians, would Disneyland California remain closed? think that’s excellent proof aren’t giving governors money, otherwise would allowed reopen June. kids asymptomatic they're less likely spread virus symptomatic people. (Please note saying spread it, spread less.) 

But also, governments kind tough spot here. schools close lot parents can't work kids take care of. work home parents, productivity suffer kids around. Even Canada schools open due thing. province spread coming schools, coming households private gatherings. looks like today's death toll either surpass 2,000 close it. Saskatchewan gotten point longer even notifying public exposure. cannot trace 1000 roughly 2000 active cases. government - cozied separatists raged endlessly Federal government - begging federal liberals help contract tracing 

Good luck North Dakota, looks like 3-4 weeks behind you...  vaccinations up-to-date, I've flu shot 2 different pneumonia vaccinations (as I've pneumonia previously) I'd rather wait see general population reacts vaccine. problem though, since included among groups initially getting it. (Health care workers elderly underlying conditions since I'm Canada).

Will continue take precautions social distancing, around small group friends, mask wearing avoiding going among public? bet! all, there's still going lots could infectious. Yes, I'm cautiously optimistic hopeful it'll take long time truly say things back normal. from? Dang wanted pick imodium pepto guy wants spew bullshit, sounds ignorant customer service probably isnt him. complained. That’s true, they’re also helping spread virus vaccinating Almost like can't treat immediate family ~~people useful them~~ friends like subhumans without consequence, don't. remember first month, people saying stuff like ""more people died car accidents covid! going outlaw cars?""

Like. . . month death's exponential. . . guys dumb?
 assure people learned nothing. Whaa ? trained medical science professionals make decisions ? Hehe Feels like alternate ending Game Thrones. Everyone dies whitewalkers leaders busy playing politics. guess summer 2021. Giving another summer season would devastating travel industry. wouldn’t surprised proof vaccination required international travel, though. Lots countries already require proof vaccination yellow fever, example. many deaths reported Monday logged Tuesday. That’s need remember. ones look data. tons challenges people wanting take first place. There’s behind scenes give credit for

I’m glad they’re meeting early December cause thought would way longer   Haha, know meant well... little early celebrate though. reasonable accounts we're less halfway affair, that's vaccines badass seem be, rolled efficiently. Things looking up, doubt, we're still darkest, thickest part woods. Sorry, excess deaths factor covid deaths. I’m going poster meant that, current rate logged deaths, hit 400k Jan 1st. simply isn’t happening.  Let’s social distance forever! Here's one example: Hmmmm. I’m hearing this... DeSantis principle: fuck data - we're even going tell data “following federal guidelines” thought reddit hated big pharma Except study done place people wear masks. believe study said around 5% people wore masks. 80% people wore masks, level adherence among participants would likely much higher. 1,898 deaths far. Easily deaths day since May. Looks like may well cracking 2000 next days. sub-national level, North Dakota already tracing nothing hotel quarantine

I think so. virus spread via thoughts. must problems tracing people (e.g. hotel workers) interacting arrivals. next mildly deadly flu strain emerges go bullshit again. 

I'm 100% convinced next time there's swine flu-like epidemic lockdowns. Cool, maybe put pressure senators fucking something stimulus bill.  8 months since US hit 100 deaths

we've 200k deaths within last 6 months going work? know enough process kinda like saying Taylor swift deserve credit success whoever record label deserves it? densely populated, closer NYC.

I’m south Jersey shit never really started heating couple weeks ago. Unbelievable Masks primarily reducing spread others infected individual, lowers R0 value societal scale. 

But referencing study whether individuals masks catch COVID ""settings mask use uncommon"". victoria mask use was/is 99%, stated reason wear mask all. reason spread period catching diagnosed.

This situation analysed real data places closed vs places seem show regional level, masks effect. that's talking here.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's paper models article read understand evidence something actually discuss pretty lame. I’m white....

I understand POC impacted differently pandemic. also see incredible arrogance lack understanding among many white people. Well correct reason many people choose to. misunderstand, valid reason, people really dumb Ty motleyfool, fantastic return. Cute think rest world problem here. I'm probably never flying without one again. used always get sick flights. still travel often work gotten sick since pandemic started, thankfully. I'm sure mindful sanitation helped. I'll keep mine. big stupid idiot, Reddit. That’s illegal opinion. America = Bad. Since want daughter feel normal possible, I'm making everything us 3. gonna much work. hey, leftovers weeks. fuck know? know that, anyone fucking dangerous act like especially global pandemic, holy fuck yo.

First hoax, anti maskers, everything fine, everything going back ""normal,"" whatever fuck means. Sounds like privileged shit.

Every step new delusion made manifest. live right deal problems right instead acting like future brings, fucking idiots  type wear masks rights get vaccine risks besides, everyone else point. need clear: moderna pfizer recently submitted request emergency authorization use fda. vaccine booster won’t available fda approves, won’t happen they’ve vetted patients 2 months vaccine given 300-500 people approve safety measures. that, fda allow releasing vaccines prescription use phase 3 trial complete it’s 2 years safety/health concerns 5,000 ideal patients. Remember 300-500 phase 2 trial patients cherry picked accurate representation general public. risk involved vaccine makers yet discover there’s long term, health complications/concerns. are, fda won’t release general public.

The government moves slow too, emergency use request/green light fda allow prescription use case case basis we’ve told vaccines go healthcare professionals.

Timeline: April 2021 first batch green lighted fda healthcare prof. general public may get see vaccine Fall 2021 won’t widely available vaccinate end 2022 earliest.

Sorry measures put place ensure full safety get fda blessing. cannot depend vaccine save us virus/pandemic I've always thought CDC kind ""forced"" give recommendation information mental health, kids need regular meals, abuse home, structured learning false all. administration pressured CDC enough evidence push back say anything different. timing pressure put guidance best could. made guidelines vague places, made guidelines strict others. 

I think republish similar, people prioritize getting schools open, realistic guidance less theater, information ""when"" open schools. Like community positivity rates X firm numbers would say rates X, sure schools Y. least guess+hope. sure study concluded masks reduce spread? objective really concern issue (whether mask mandates reduce Covid assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside home reduces wearers' risk SARS-CoV-2 infection setting masks uncommon among recommended public health measures. 38% answer question wanted talk ""rigged election."" boyfriend anniversary zoom wasn’t depressing anticipated! Yea. proof paradigm racism wrong. One race clearly better another.

But cultures clearly better others. rational follow science keep pandemic control. Others believe internet memes think virus dying hoax. Let’s pretend divergent cultures equals. you’ll knowingly allowing infectious disease damage thousands people’s organs kill them? Glad hear that. real story mitigation efforts, although haphazard inconsistent greatly reduced could been...here across world. Rupert Murdoch controls media Australia. ain't good parts. ""natural causes"" get filed heart disease? subreddit loves rant rave long-term effects 100% convinced side effects fastest-developed vaccine history planet. Right? Wtf wrong people? don’t ask Ebola petting zoo problem developing vaccine, logistics around getting enough doses manufactured, shipped stored properly, administered billions humans need it. 

Those things take time happen. guarantee people need top list get it, even though they're ones dying first. lower death toll? Man can't even argue stupidity   many died? Oh right. None. might dumb question comparing two groups placebo receive actual vaccine, saw different numbers people got sick different groups, guarantee behavior two groups comparable? is, one group decided stay home time group happen consist people got vaccine whereas people placebo group went various places take precautions. control kinds behavioral differences groups? guy literally compared vape fucking virus thought good idea. problem people complaining ""all old people outside taking seriously"" probably old people take seriously, see much because, know, stay home much possible. He’s regular pied piper. Incompetence, corruption stupidity.

The usual.  Yes. wondered loud towards wife heard it. Got typical shoulder shrug reasonable answer question.  Bullshit. You’re peddling crap Trump’s garbage cdc. [the It’s old term. Earlier frequently used foreign diplomats describing American foreign policy. Yes think terrible, result elderly people contracting virus. think matter governor does, case number going keep increasing either herd immunity vaccine. solution is: hard lockdown masks forever. Neither supported empirical scientific evidence- neither shown evidence efficacy country. states good case trajectories right Hawaii (which island) Georgia (which one first states reopen initial panic). 

Maybe like wearing mask day. people don't. case, certainly like government telling need wear one threat fine arrest. done masks beginning numbers would low point would sense normalacy

There absolutely evidence back statement up. acted early decisively, maybe there's chance could gotten control... doubt it. thing contagious. Maybe CDC fucked PCR tests. Maybe successfully contact traced first cases care homes. Maybe shut borders immediately. Maybe Maybe Maybe. mattered. America worldwide transit hub- would made way community spread sooner later. way stop point would intrusive surveillance impeccable contact tracing would hampered distrust government privacy laws. might delayed widespread infection by... months maybe. 

The problem is- made choice liberty security long time ago. opinion doubled choice instead trying go China route lockdowns entire country set herd immunity strategy.

This happens cancer cells ""bad cells"" maybe happen too, could turn form autoimmune disease? 

But know many cells involved producing spike protein either? Perhaps perfectly fine cells get killed off?

Brazil situation COVID denier charge. really leaves India everyone expected cases surge due poverty crowding.  looks like Mexico also catching could argue similar issues India.  

Bottom line US well comparing countries greater lead time ones substandard response faulty logic best. looking countries like NZ, Aus even Canada better leadership demonstrated. also places like Vietnam Korea high population density mask use compliance social distancing also significantly lower cases. thing achools really well pandemic.

I'm exactly sure annoying, every person I've talked said disliked it. Maybe jealous superior concentration vibe.

The good news high efficacy means need large compliance getting vaccine order reach herd immunity. one points confused most. reddit love independent.co.uk much? Ahhhh gotcha, thank clarifying makes much sense Good news - house fire fire engine way. Although might take hours get here. Meanwhile continue sit couch watching TV smoke eating popcorn. Ok whatever care give shot already papa wants go see live music know quite Americans traveling world right now. may need quarantine take Covid test. 95% success rate doesn’t mean 5% chance dying. can’t compare two percentages... took two bio stats courses (I PhD probability theory, theoretical mathematical stats courses), remember little came sampling. terms vaccines, 95% efficacy close excellent. Flu shots’ efficacy anywhere 10 90%, depending year strain. Yeah could done show people used it, also know 30 years lot fast tech advancing still 30 years, even halfway triple digits, yes, different think it'll different people keep information physically anymore still reasons even put 0s 1s, all, could already everything digitally tradition's sake, everything always pros cons.

I really need stop always writing long, I'm bad concise. BTW cutting bunch started early February, housemate said, ""The world never going again; going 2-5 years we're thing,"" think right.

The vaccines definite plus good news, be-all end-all solutions, either. also need change social behaviors.

We're learning downside almost 8 billion humans living towns cities. either adapt new conditions die. safe assumption anywhere that's already got one freezers get vaccine needs rural areas freezers get moderna one? like ignored lock downs focused masks authoritarian policies.

Masks one thing economy ruining lock downs painful point people saying authoritarian. I'll see /r/tinder? Zero percent chance Disney doesn’t heavily bribe every florida politician Covid killed Americans year than:

\+Diabetes

\+Influenza

\+Suicides

\+Car Accidents

\+Murders

If history justice it, Donald Trump's entire legacy. Pretend covid killed everyone, noone die anything next year. give now. Short winter lot people bad math parrot “but exponential growth!” championed defiance shutdown orders, think got lot money raised gofundme. 

Which goes show even major cities, there’s still lot red. hear trying touch part door handle least amount people likely touched. years, especially leaving toilets pub example. amount people poor hand hygiene shocking. really read article. gave simply keep workload. 1.5% state currently actively positive Covid. soon life back normal COVID test centres closed? hope works hits ground running. goes well least evidence humanities capability push though succeed work TOGETHER. Best case problems vaccine period. Worse case problems benefits large percentage people and/or vaccine protect long enough. 

At least drop guard run around causing larger problem. gamers say hype it! Also kills fat. Lot North Dakota. know kids get it. easy take grandma diabetic, overweight, dude? No. 

But there’s much school debate reddit glosses over. 

1) parents work home. kid go school crippling income that’s household set (school timed work.)

2) households food secure. large percentage children get nutrition school food. 

3) households physically safe. Whether it’s newly depressed parent, violent parent, abusive step parent, creepy uncle... whatever... school safer place many kids. 

4) households support child need real education. Let’s face it... there’s lots dumb parents trying (or trying to) teach kids. 

5) Social problems. Kids inherently social creatures. Keeping isolated year formative years big damage. 

6) Online predators. kids online, less parental security, time predators access without school distraction. 

This exhaustive list it’s enough reasons get rational person thinking. Maybe unfettered capitalism virus along daily graph show number deaths reported day, number deaths occurred day. Ughhh makes virus tricky governor wants get 70% state vaccinated 6 months, apparently! We’ll see! I, one, going stay positive. Stay safe!  Americans like ""why yes let people die keeps team looking good"" prediction well. Two weeks today probably 2k 7 day moving average. Jesus. still get two senators. whole village sick Ug smashed rock soon Ug sneezed? impression primary advantage mRNA rapid development time. see - legit. 1870 now. also put moving average deaths around May 21st today. Never good see us comparing spring metrics again. anything close education, managed wife's Ob/Gyn office retired.

On good day, nothing vaccine jabs, probably could handled 100 people, wife got certification administering jab.

My guess Germany could administer 100k jabs per day. That's 1 million per week country 83 million people. Realistically, we're looking two years hard work get Germany vaccinated, even get supply, individuals willing vaccinated.

By way, 83 million people live country half size Texas. Like Trump said! Nice! Right..... guess you’re seeing everyone constant risk heart disease? AZ/Oxford, probably next week two, J J probably closer end year. really matter planning, need reach certain number infections data assessed. respect that, don’t get trying imitate meat Hopefully. Shut every hospital country via striking see forces governments hand. I’d worry collapsing country see isn’t much country collapse. Great news. Merry Christmas everyone! Good job. fuzzy accounting seems like bad way make decisions practical scale. population scale large america dumb stuff make decisions lot gets lost abstractions like putting dollar value life. GDP bad target, need something else Trump said NY get any. Fuck family guess... There's like 50.... lol...i read 5 last week. that's certainly said.  Slow turnaround, lack compliance, rampant spread, population wearing masks/living life normal makes almost impossible. Sounds like testing facilities staffed traitors. (Overenthusiastic republicans) Check reply learn basic math. US would need AVERAGE 2,000 deaths hit that. Ah, man culture. guess going gets tough, America gives now. Population density even close America. dozens huge cities metroplexes people going back forth sometimes several times day. island middle ocean. video game Australia would one best places pick.

A Asian's countries impressive Australia absolutely excuse trouble have. Depends state I’d imagine whatever tier essential workers in. Check health department’s website see vaccination plan up! :) coworker today brought quote said saw shirt. Something 2020 worst year 2021 saying “hold beer”.

I responded case going find tallest bridge could find jump. People laughed assumed joking. dead serious. shit stop.

Play without fans? ""I say Easter!"" number matter covid infects everyone kills bad heart.

It like saying lots people die old age covid kills every one 70 old people years. like Australia New Zealand Western countries learned good parts Eastern culture.  Vaccine free US Yeah quite. Yes big pharma sucks donkeyballs, yes punished.

The little sellers bought shop shop shop, making impossible people get sanitizer. got marked insanely lot banned selling various platforms causing products sit garages shit.

Don’t make little guys lemonade stand sellers, scum. quarantine 7 days wfh jobs? taking week work Thanksgiving? thinking something similar Christmas.  symptoms significantly milder

isn't good thing? gives immunity strains let spread allowing win work ass self replicating vaccine time.  cost? Someone handle much death dying. Trump principle don’t remember that. links? Fuckin’ finally! Unfortunately, she’s facing backlash since first day office. good ole boys club used run Harris County can’t handle fact young Hispanic woman, Dems, charge county. Personally think she’s done great job pissed Abbott constantly getting way. guys idea people would go normal lives would happen get infected. results good model risk reduction general population. challenge trial I've heard people deliberately infected small trial UK determine minimum viral dose PCR testing known INCREDIBLY flawed results easily misconstrued Hard anything legislature support governor courts overturn executive orders. What's crazy people Asian countries learned wear masks public decade ago. humans crowded cities towns, type infectious illness result. 

We accept new normal, like wash bodies, wear deodorant brush teeth. Basic personal hygiene. said thing outbreak southwestern Sydney (Crossroads cluster), quietly stopped saying it, seems normal strain.

 possible normal distribution includes short incubation periods, ""super-spreading"" events number cases high, shorts ones seem common.

Also, obviously, short incubation cases show first. Severely doubtful take considering vast majority adults country putting heart risk diet choices thinks might immune hasn’t gotten yet. no, reading....even post vaccination....see follow this. OP suggests 1/3 seniors vaccinated plus 5 million health care workers, leaves 30 million seniors 280 million others restrictions released get sick within period months yeah morgues overflow.

if 100% seniors vaccinated, leaves 280 million non seniors combined death rate roughly .01% would 28,000 deaths top whatever residual deaths currently hospitals plus whatever normal death rate....yeah morgues could overflow people get sick quickly. oh wait, forgot 5% vaccine work would 1,500,000 death rate 5 10% according CDC planning scenario (which caps age 70 even though notes 80 death rate higher)

regardless two words comment, cases still practical way determine open close area, new conversion factor needed since top end age bracket immune. comes Santa rates low, know seem get often people couple end dying. young couple earlier week. multiple people family. absolutely irrelevant, unless want start stupid country vs. country war. change fact really find ""model"" least look NZ Taiwan. Okay, man wrong, see every damn day

People noses hanging masks, people taking masks soon round store corner.

It's become joke, meanwhile people actually dying.

On behalf rest world..... We. Don't. Care.

Just wear mask ya dick. 1864 far. It’ll likely 1900 end day. Right where's button trades years sweet sweet dough Yep, every rich kids daddies mommies get shot 24 hours. Vegans vegetarians didn’t stop eating meat lack enjoyment it.. it’s factory farming practices among reasons live NY daughter high risk exposure. tested negative 2x county health department contacted day exposure via phone call question contacts sent follow text every single day 14 days asking presented symptoms. 14th day even sent text stating quarantine over. thorough contact tracing follow ups done here. 

Crazy state choose give shit not. Nope. know yet. Really? read German news article, assumed talking Germany. really need start blaming China; make go away. Guess 250k people don’t matter, since people still trying “gotcha, flu!” debates NINE MONTHS worst pandemic we’ve seen 100 years.  SARS-CoV-2 25 times deadly H1N1 strain 2009. 

We disallow cars 40k people die year car accidents. wearers regard invincible stand close abandoning social distancing result pick virus.

That sounds like user error. It’s still expensive US unless you’re middle nowhere. Introduce neighbors God! Sooner rather later! Aside deserted skyscrapers haunting urban downtown landscapes like ghosts... car relatively good shape? takes 3-4 days drive coast coast goal. could buy enough food water leave entering unknown buildings. planned right alot lower risk infection. maybe long drive idk. US still likely better place they're astronomically higher wages likely better social programs. running office?

So lack public prevention means hospitals prepared?

Is fucking premise!? heard news government already 40M doses warehoused, waiting official approval. Thanks, friend. cooked since began ever before... lol new administration let current administration hook. like Obama Bush. Fuck all. think case priorities. restaurants obsessively cleaning door knobs businesses disinfecting stationery making people feel safer not. might make people think mitigates risk breathing shared air, focusing on. Europe fuckfest. Try looking african union successful covid strategies (note north african nations shitty)  many rest world believe China’s fight virus dominated high-tech surveillance, within country think so.

This important part article part people education China banging heads trying get months now. Almost everything China biggest impact compatible free society. never involved technology sophisticated telephone converted gymnasium, required mass, concerted, dedicated work. 

It's incredible much West willing sacrifice lives CCP. Spanish here. think eventually implement fines. Previously, softer measures restrictions revoked courts. two thirds fines lockout cancelled. case, may dissuasory effect. like April/May/June would say get ready good fucking summer.

Edit: also depends u mean normal. you’re looking concert? Probably fall(ish) you’re excited party? Probably like July. need know religion see bad side dangerous blindly faith lead dark road. pastors preach ridiculous shit reason people believe them. tried watch one TV damn worse watch Trump rally, lies everywhere I'm afraid multi-week lag cases-to-death ratio, actually going 5,000 deaths per day range Christmas, USA. numbers looking way. type video that's popular Korea vloggers stream eating talking community.

There's subset involves eating *ridiculously large* amounts food, that's typically western take it. I’m sick people wearing masks public on.

Asian countries forever. democracy dies:( meant globally. They’re gonna turn healthcare workers zombies first 

Yaaaaaaay overblown, opinion. truth is, managers don’t make much money, either, work survive much everyone else. Plus, basically everyone working factory tiny death risk due age group.

Tell haven’t hypothetical talks many people would get infected circle? pandemic sucks, harm trying cope little dark humor?

We can’t get offended literally everything. tough times. Show empathy literally harmless joke (assuming didn’t anything actively “win” bet). Glad could help. practice wear mask I'm public spaces, get back hotel room, car, house keep wearing mask chance wash hands use sanitizer. way respiratory protection mask keeps touching much face hands clean. number people refuse participate event end dead people attend.

Agreed, different. still crazy - Thanksgiving worth getting sick possibly dying for. Da fuq?

PPE, equipment, ventilators, none issue. Actual experienced providers severe shortage issue.

So great, supplies bodies manage it. That’s issue. takes years train people stuff. doesn’t take many stupid people get sick overwhelm staff that’s available. over-abundance stupid going around.

Absolutely aging populations west show. close contacts player tested positive. get covid test urgent care recently.  people covid tests. sat waiting room hours. signed pen, wrote number went truck. test. really want something wrong exposed covid too. Thanksgiving approaches, conservatives United States boasting online mass gatherings plan hold defiance social distancing measures. strange civil disobedience, even country’s coronavirus cases deaths soar, become bizarre mark status them, plan public events likely led people’s deaths. denial facts science extends deathbed, South Dakota nurse Jodi Doering told CNN: “People still looking something else, want magic answer, don’t want believe COVID real. … last dying words are, ‘This can’t happening. It’s real.’”

The outright denialists crudest representative idea dominated American (and degree, European) responses since start pandemic: can’t really happening. second wave pandemic crashes down, U.S. government essentially surrendered: Republican Party adamantly anti-lockdown, country’s coronavirus task force advised crank president saw TV. Usually, kind denial reality associated authoritarian states leaders don’t need answer anyone. American denialism hasn’t driven dictatorship control media—although Donald Trump Fox News played critical part worsening things. Instead, primary driver behind America’s current predicament fundamental distrust government itself—and deep conviction disaster something happens people.

The playbook control coronavirus is, countries across Asia-Pacific shown, simple—and painful. begins sharp lockdowns, pioneered China’s near-total closure country 76 days also carried skillfully New Zealand, Taiwan, Vietnam, elsewhere. countries virus hasn’t taken strong foothold, Japan Australia, enforced social distancing, rather full lockdown, work. lockdown, economic support flow government frozen private sector, whether wage subsidies, direct payments, or, China, targeted business aid combined restrictions layoffs.

The United States never really lockdown. Even stay-at-home orders issued 43 states March April came nowhere close level lockdown imposed countries—not least lack real penalties violating rules. rare success, though, combination direct payments unemployment insurance kept U.S. economy afloat.

But it’s necessary follow-up stages United States truly failed.

It’s lack centralized test-and-trace program, necessity spotting stamping future possible outbreaks. Key among centralized mandatory system quarantine isolation, patients exposed them. step crushed spread virus China helped contain elsewhere. countries taking virus seriously, Taiwan, Australia, Israel, entering abroad means two weeks monitored observance hotel; United States, simply waltz say intend quarantine, checks balances.

New York City offers quarantine facilities coronavirus sufferers hotel rooms—on purely volunteer basis. Centralized isolation nowhere seen, instead Centers Disease Control Prevention issues suggestions confining infected single room—an impossibility many multigeneration households small city apartments. Internal travel rules flimsy; take Washington, D.C., relatively successful coronavirus control. attempt impose rules prevent reinfection visitors features enforcement myriad bizarre loopholes: you’re visiting less 24 hours, instance, that’s fine. Perhaps virus likes take good look around first infects people. every stage, loopholes dominate, belief somehow virus cheated toll: We’ll keep restaurants open 10 p.m. later! We’ll ban gatherings 15 people! Arbitrary lines adjusted avoid necessary realities.

At heart systemic flaws lie two fatal American convictions: government can’t help, disasters things happen people. first idea embedded deep American life becomes self-sustaining. Government departments underfunded, often deliberately, everyday experience Americans government services becomes bureaucratic, oppressive, unpleasant. Meanwhile, parts U.S. governance frequently enforced hit vulnerable—such brutal policing. crumbling infrastructure tax system carceral state target poor, Americans ample reason trust government job.

But another factor contributing national denialism may sheer prosperity safety modern American life. Americans simply used idea what’s happening news might change daily life. countries political natural disaster radically altered life within living memory, China Vietnam, people psychologically prepared impact coronavirus—for idea today’s headlines might mean life different tomorrow.

But United States, news rarely kind immediate impact. Mostly it’s something happening people, far away. Even events hit relatively close home, don’t matter. Puerto Rico—a U.S. territory—was devastated Hurricane Maria 2017, American public barely noticed. It’s response liberal press early months pandemic try turn coronavirus another participant culture war; real danger, papers earnestly proclaimed, virus racism. Even mass death came United States, impact brutally disproportionate. first, outbreaks small localized, like among Orthodox Jews New York, then, virus spread, first wave hit Black Americans three times harder others.

To sure, United States natural disasters. regular exceptions limited regionally specific: floods New Orleans, tornados Midwest. They’re also much visible pandemic; nobody disagree existence hurricane. Throw difficulty accepting invisible foe paranoid history American conspiratorialism, end nation dotted denialists. denied high school party Thanksgiving get-together become defined tens millions Americans act government oppression, necessary sacrifice. (In contrast, Chinese sacrificed single-most important family event year, Spring Festival, entirely.)

This inevitable, entirely unique. Australia New Zealand proverbially lucky countries, long histories prosperity. proximity Asia, experience SARS, strong notions communal support meant response fast effective. Europe lacks degree American mistrust government, seven decades postwar complacency made coronavirus response dangerously late drained sustain measures winter.

But America’s current path locked in, since Republican Party committed wholeheartedly sustaining bad ideas caused disaster begin with. Even incoming administration Joe Biden find effectively hamstrung action, literally unable take lifesaving measures—from true lockdown economic support—that country desperately needs. American exceptionalism finally caught United States. needed good laugh end day. No, mRNA.

This best covid vaccine news we've gotten far. bad drowned coorporate bullshit companies. What’s worse COVID-19 “deniers” people aren’t denial pandemic denial actions. Case point: Democrat, white, affluent in-laws conservative North Carolina. 

They constantly state “we” need take virus seriously, it’s sad “people” acting. contracted virus fully believe it. father-in-law lost job secretly went back work teaching tennis country club believe got virus. felt sick tried visit relative hospital, went shopping day tested positive buy new cell phone, testing positive didn’t understand quarantine/isolation necessity even though shared CDC information. father-in-law even hospitalized brief time. went got tested yesterday tested negative (thank goodness) first thing go shopping back work. excited “immune” pandemic it’s “relief” them. 

The denial doesn’t scare me. cognitive dissonance exceptionalism scare me. people money, education, affluent. act, others? I’m  Screenshot make jokes. think need read again, [improve understanding COVID pandemic serious health matter. take seriously. I'll wear mask wherever there's air conditioning. OKay Xi room foggers...

This fogger moment 😔 contact tracing Chicagoland checking here. beds, fact plenty capacity. looks leaders need want see dead bodies streets take actions. Recently cleaning companies using disinfection fog clean air settles surfaces clean too.

Source: family member opened new fogging cleaning business. Also, separately, office building used work uses every time employee office tests positive. yes, something happens sometimes

but still far denying covid workers still working? JFC, American workers fucking *kowtowed* point even walk strike employer puts health lives danger, makes jokes bets it? don’t know permitted comment test came back positive. Tuesday, headaches, fever, bone pain shivering. Got tested next day although symptoms went away still really sore throat. else expect?  mNRA vs DNA (Russian vaccine?). Pro's Con's. Thanks. state? We’re talking pandemic response, dumbass exposure time UV light, air passes purifier duct, usually insufficient much good.  Air passes air-purifiers speeds many feet-per-second (in US) meters-per-second (everywhere else). fraction second exposure UV, much.  

The HEPA filter traps aerosols contain virus. virus particles remain trapped, even water evaporates. contradictory messaging? particular, say April wear masks? time, severe shortage personal protective equipment; evidently feared ordinary people would rush buy masks, denying medical personnel. According one report, officials also concerned widespread masking would lead false sense security, leading people ignore safety measures, handwashing simply said this, would lot less confusion. apparently another problem. time, direct evidence existed regarding community spread particular virus, previous studies done clinical settings. put way: “There currently evidence wearing mask (whether medical types) healthy persons wider community setting, including universal community masking, prevent infection respiratory viruses, including common pattern science: conflating absence evidence evidence absence. arises scientific norm assuming default hypothesis effect placing burden proof asserting affirmative claim. Usually makes sense: want overturn established science basis assertion speculation. public health safety stake, standard becomes priggish. evidence something may help—and unlikely harm—there little excuse recommending it. mechanistic reason think might help, lack clinical trials barrier acting mechanistic knowledge. One epidemiologist offered common sense: “Randomized trials support big effect face masks, mechanistic plausibility face masks work.... consider nearly areas science, evidence imperfect incomplete, excuse act know. Yes, still. avoid crowds wear mask everywhere property. Taking longer could also mean vaccine effective since infections vaccinated group, take longer reach total number infections control group. plague

Don't dramatic. plague two orders magnitude dangerous covid19. really sick since February, teacher I'm used sick least every month two. nice. Yeah people would actually believe they're aliens... outer space.

I feel ya 🤣 still better many states US. hope country able get control back. live Canada US! lot people paint Japan perfect society, point every society pressing issues. lung heart condition weak immune system. im taking risks. I'd rather wait till know really proven help horrible harmful side effects. Yes, forget add human manipulation viruses , exist 100 years ago, likely stupid human action added suffering today. lol think bigger companies like Tyson bad, smaller packers even worse often not. (This way minimize much despise companies like Tyson profit people approach). agree. thia position. reality is, forced position government choices. Hold representatives accountable. Private business, government won’t to. 

Employers say proof vaccine can’t work here, airlines could say thing. 

Public health trumps most, all, thankfully things. 

I arguing anyone first new vaccine, get offered family want return working. want return living.

Vaccines work, science, actual science backs up. anti vaccine movement started lie disproven founder lie yet damage done. start seeing deaths 10 days ago numbers crossed 100k/day, world hurt. Deaths 3-4 weeks positive test (varies based quickly results come back, it’s faster April summer peak). 
 
With mind, first week December going terrible continue get worse rest December, time Thanksgiving death surge kick in. Thanksgiving deaths started yet There’s many great options now! I’ve veg 10 years, working going full vegan find cheese hard give reason (despite going veg completely cold turkey). keep working it, fact transitioning awesome! carnivore boyfriend actually started liking veggie stuff better real meat That's actually great idea. I'm sure people would actually listen knew one save little constitutional tantrum experimental point view see valuable different states handle virus completely differently.

Personally also see disadvantages (very the) measures outweigh benefits.

I see problematic force populations indirectly directly take vaccine brand new technology type (mRNA) &amp; developed tested warp speed.

However nothing flu tetanus whatever vaccines since around long, seem work etc etc - still, forcing types things gets sensors dingling video actually reduction droplet spread wearing mask. masks 100% effective containing droplets, clearly reduce amount droplets. person replied already said, reducing viral masks get dirty (i.e. frequent re-use people doing) effect pretty much negligible.

Not sure mean this. Yes, people cleaning masks sanitary reasons, someone wearing dirty mask still going reduced droplet spread compared someone without mask. virus persisting air surfaces problem, soon take mask home, touch nose mouth virus hands going way in. 

When get home, first thing wash hands, take Many scientists agree simply washing hands frequently effective wearing masks much less intrusive.

Going need source this. both, washing hands frequently wearing masks public.


I'm arguing whether forced wear masks restrictions mandated, say wearing masks help reduce spread virus wrong. It’s hoot. Give skim know people crazy about- better yet find quotes. Heh guys use UV light ""clean"" like here?

Mainly ER dont know mentioned race really set construct merely something used lump together group people share similar set genetics. Take instance asian. expanded upon caucasian eurasian. Caucasian implies origination area Caucus mountains, like Azerbejian area. Eurasian like tibetan. Even indians ""technically"" asian, whole genetics similar asians say Ango saxons, middle eastern africans (even though may quite dark-features exist due race ethnicity, arise due climate location. people Fiji look african genetics completely asian ancestry).

a long time ago planes stuff, certain areas isolated therefore find large spans country people have, well, looked culturally (more less) long, long time.

Take Japan. Japan mountain terrain. example ethnicity reflecting culture genetics. genetic range japanese, koreans mainland chinese quite similar (compared ranges possible ""races), mountain island differentiates culturally. 

the opposite case would ethnicity reflecting genetics culture. approach taken west, culture less often same. ""western culture"" may. 

Africa niche case considered bottlenecked genetic flow due sahara way continent. africans (sub saharan) taken strong, characteristic features even among various tribes. Somalians Ghanians may hair skin, genetic differences blonde hair blue eyed person african. Thats right.

here america ethnicity race. hispanics hispanics latinos latinos even though cultures vary so, much native mexicans (azetcs) one side literal germans lived argentina generation two. african american african american even though one person another may ethnic origins 1000 miles apart continent.

thats mess here, one strict identity thats try pull ""always americans together"" shtick. countries like japan, natives less dont consider nationality part actions dont to. 

take example. born puerto rico, name hispanic. parents african european. genetic range stretched senegal western africa north east north iran northern italy respectively.

as saying japanese chinese ethnically culturally different guess depends want use. Culturally vastly different. mysticisim eastern styles religion may look glance not. Genetically? definitely mainland asian ""race"" (so southeast asian mongolian etc) started less eastern china (the human race started africa, pretty widely accepted. got mongolia southwest asia got mainland china eastward korea japan etc...and look quite different now, obviously)

overall, point western view ethnicity takes account almost strictly look like culture number reasons eastern view opposite general shouldnt buying CFA shit either youre attempting remotely moral, despite supplier. government finally wakes approves cruel unusual punishments select cases? Since May actually.  Also... Y'all southern hemisphere going summer now. got better US summer, little easier meet outdoors humans absolutely trash God like US toddler can't parented properly without tantrumming mainly thought US providing much anything (foodstamps, guess?) people can't work, they'd wind homeless, also much resources spent them. gigantic suffering million people, think it'd impact economy/the household much. Yup, social workers, too. place pandemic turnover high. expect vaccine less effective mRNA one? part Tom's son drowns yard? side effect vaccine. agree fear, think make fun something real side effect certain vaccines. someone SoDacovid, agree sentiment. SOMETHING needs done people realize serious is. wish answers. not.  yes - paid participants $125 per visit $5 per week answer survey. far I've gone 3 times. first visit like 4 hours long (interview nurse, paperwork, doctor examination, covid nasal test, blood draw, shot 1). 2nd visit 3 weeks later 3 hours (doctor examination, covid nasal test, blood draw, 2nd shot). 3rd visit 2 weeks fast - maybe hour. (Blood draw, doctor visit). next appointment March now. Found hermit lol study issue, sure. truth it, taking higher risks wear masks might opposite effects catch covid go home spreading family. Yup, definitely organisational challenge. high-risk healthcare workers going close suitable facilities, part, relatively mobile. might ultimate answer every problem definitely good enough get ball rolling.  I’ve least every person know ask I’m wearing mask, it’s made it’ll go away. it’s serious. experience 250,000 people dead it’s complete failure government levels. thing causes action resistant politicians collapse hospitals. it’s way late control community spread without harsh measures. hard articulate without coming calloused indifferent, that's intent. However, minority South Dakota, they're minority. That's democratic style governance works majority's prevails. Obviously, checks try prevent tyranny majority...and yes, majority indeed tyrannical. comes issues handling emergencies, goes double edged sword, also really be. majority community dictate respond various threats, even goes interests minority. like part order feel system valid. Everything tradeoff. feel people.

I'm actually r State myself, although adamant taking seriously, defer majority. readily criticize measures (or lack thereof) try get people take seriously. can. I'm also committed idea decentralization local government. Even though shortfall instance, want give opportunity concentration power centralized bureaucracy. Think back &lt;famous 2001 act one many examples emergencies used grant powers DC never relinquish. big deal Covid now, can't lose sight big picture country would look like afterward long term. uncomfortable balancing act...and yes, satisfying fears primal desires. still view necessary hold line certain important principles, matter much short term pain may experience.

And good logistics travel point. point States free without interference DC times emergency this. I'll leave smarter people work details needed. doubt mind systemic nature oppression Appalacia. evil ""systemic"" systemic racism. agree complete atrocities failings, exploitation entire government, country, history, etc.. perhaps surfing two different wave-lengths. application original article posted thread, absolutely stand quote. idea saying 'fuck you' entire generation at-risk people playing right back system hatred oppression, much responding bad situation worst way possible. story history constant flip-flop one group people hating oppressing another. seriously ok idea saying, ""let's collectively lump old people together make ok hate them""? ok fostering hatered? apply history Appalachia, etc, etc, etc., learn oppressing different segment people answer? 

If used quote without sourcing it, would able see application? Soon americans celebrate thanksgiving, month later christmas. think tose mass spreading events chinese new year was. (with respect chinese know much better, see large group still wanting celebrate traditions). live area lot people downplaying denying Covid. local group FB recently post “let’s honest, hundreds cases town.” people started admitting knew times moderately severe, didn’t want get tested treated like pariah others town. Based recorded numbers people admitting it, I’d say 20% town it. Approximately 60% town downplays it. look science behind vaccine, simply crazy think imagine could drop dead result vaccine; it’s essentially infecting inactive version COVID. 

The approach used past vaccines, flu vaccine. you’re okay getting flu vaccine, fine this. It’s injecting cyanide. vaccine particular extremely well understood. stores insist scrubbing surfaces every customer.... Like, ""please let stand breathing employee's covid smog perform theatrics"" BREAKING NEWS: Duh. Walmart biggest consumer customer far include Sams Yeah? Going pay people stay home then? No? sit down. Context important here. Shame even attempting understand. inviting family thanksgiving trash. I'm problem? Fine, call problem, i'm contributing pandemic. 

Your last statement laughable. Look history 30 seconds. humans trash, idea talking about. 

And ya haven't. becasue everyone idiot mean need too. Oh well, get you, maybe kill someone close you. mainly world leaders. wait people trial get Covid. 

They either bad recruiting luck, vaccine could less effective...in case they'll need people get Covid highly effective RNA vaccines 90%) needed to. You’re missing details. 

We president delayed closing borders, pushed unproven treatments. let’s go list. Trump said much PPE, untrue, actually stole give states wanted win like Florida leaving NY dry. accused NY nurses doctors selling PPE asking more. said don’t need ventilators said that’s states, causing bidding war states raising prices. said slow testing reiterated wasn’t joking. fought mask orders encouraged supporters wear them. fought lockdowns tweeted protest “liberate” state tried temporary ones. tried force schools stay open withholding funding claiming kids safe not. vaccine, threatened put vaccines early properly tested would approve vaccine ineffective could claim win. also promised would come Election Day still don’t one. said enraged moderna Pfizer announced preliminary results accused delaying announcement embarrass him. 

Every step way Trump obstructed actual attempts fight virus. Yes others. know PR piece aggregation different stories around world? Frankly company money put skin game? agree it’s bad optics inappropriate though - look happened PR perspective. context really temps though. peoples behaviour. 

If local population feel though cold, they'll stay indoors, increasing transmission possibility. grew Brisbane, 20C would feel cold remember wanting outside wind.  Well Russia hard time too... Uruguay part Latin American culture neither Western Eastern Friendly life death office pool, come on, let'em play ref! think US going divide elderly long term care higher priority elderly general risk communal living much higher. Health care workers first though needs here. Ironic ""facts feelings"" crowd whine this. Look much energy putting answering question. much energy investing arguing this. wasting mine time. 

Sorry taking time keep responding to, comparing blatant racism questioning large pharmaceutical company collects analyzes data. That's pretty extreme.

Oh, look. Something said agreed extreme, gloss make seem like acknowledge this. show great person going racism question. depends. young child asked question know better parents fed information truth. yes, could innocent question. would racism filled question. still question. Also probaby good sign child asking question spouting fact. would also REALLY good time engage child teach racism. would two options, 1 shit child yell racist. 2 engage teach racism. 

Yes, literal child. grown ass jackass Reddit. know this, know this. bringing see difference two? agree second one could interpreted statement tried. 

Of course there's difference. One loud proud statement. One comes conclusion based reasoning think look technical term describe this. trying see anything could described question statement though. Like ""leading question"" could considered statement. apply. thing could apply would rhetorical question. question statement. needs obvious answer. ""Is pope context person said can't rhetorical question first question. actually asking people would counted not. Breaking another  ""Does x,y,z apply? can't rhetorical question answer closest find defend argument this. goes statement difference question case argue intended rhetorical queston (which isn't) accurately stated statement instead question. again, that's stretch.

Well, warping point small, narrow box fit want to. consider types hide behind questions *a form of* also see OP edited post knew came across way said did.

Keep tooting ""look reasonable am"" horn though, bro. absolutely good there.  Every American get “lifelong free healthcare”. ""*if*"" insert shocked Pikachu face here. Fuck fur farms. Fuck fur.  not? Everyone else literally dying get vaccine. saying cut corners, it’s pretty cynical say that. precautions take rational response situation. responded saying want think rude first though ""Overzealous bot"" trolls usually come back try state want rude.

Please correct I'm wrong this!  It’s impossible point. live NV, I’m north. Many don’t believe Covid *at all*.

(Can even eat mink?) think you’re okay, pal. Don’t think it. 'the world' rolling 6 month immunity randomly scattered across population, R value would like never approach 1.0 (probably even close it), it'll never major threat again. proof that? people choose wear masks socially distance...then what?

This like putting ancillary strategies place help someone lose weight continue eat poorly exercise. people don’t want hard work amount governing help that.  governments lied mask knowing truth, dont blame priority ensure frontliners adequate protection cant replaced essential. blame would governments stocking enough ppe case pandemic.

As who, real reason give certain countries time stock up, unforgivable. /r/gatekeeping They're asking people wear masks hug other, ffs HEYO!

But one immensely dangerous idiot - criminally so, ask me. He's got incredibly large tribune speak medical position country. 70% Bulgarians believe bullshit says. already people dying steps front hospitals. fucking disaster. solutions this, really want get big book interviews nurses people go door door giving like goddamn bible something. 


I know can't go door door obvious, god damn whole thing lack empathy understanding know fix it. “new normal” crew cancerous. legitimately enjoy living like feel like good people staying home playing video games day long. air freshener sprays? wish states would this.

I onsite week audit, I've hearing people talk getting together family holidays trips rest year. still planning social events ""it's holiday tradition. to!"" 

Meanwhile wife everything set remote holiday meals family, events zoom calls.

I like look issue interests neutral perspective, standpoint trying understand first principles possible. things (almost everything) know enough opinion one way other.

This specific case large company treating staff appallingly sounds terrible negative opinion (which fits things I've heard company/industry anecdotally). new evidence comes along show I'm wrong assumptions, I'll happily change opinion. try make opinions part personality, way problem change mind.

That’s definitely true what’s alternative? it’s counter item; people still going inside pick right? exact thought popped head read article title. grounds? start production months ago? People say wear masks don’t tell take talk wear nose it’s made thin ass material rubbed eyes touched face sanitizing hands leaving grocery store. test positive say wore mask! Idiocracy Movie 2020 man director largest children's infectious diseases hospital country since beginning pandemic parroting every anti-masker, pandemic-denying meme myth think media give soap box.

So far least two dozen teachers school staff passed away virus country less 7 million population.  Beyond healthcare workers, wish way A/B test results. Would better vaccinate lower symptom people 20s fueling spread? Would greater impact economy also stop virus faster? think tasty 🤔 think ""leaked document"" revealing anything new. source this? asking really want true! Another idiot add scrap heap history. fully understand urge. check post history, FULLY favor strong measures combat serious issue. I'm willing erode separations place. think important. Yes, would help immediately, sets bad precedent makes likely permanent violated future. think things uphold, regardless cost.

But I'm saying people damned. want States take strong measures. want *States* taking measures. can't bring go beyond view humanity history have. me, see obvious trap, can't support us walking it, even best intentions. 

I rail officials ""experts"" helped make bigger disaster been. advocate handling seriously. places cannot go give support to. agree disagree. feel strongly. lament are. Ohio 7,000-8,000 past several days, numbers partly released yesterday 6,000 “thousands more” waiting certified.

Characterizing good bad wrong. says *insufficiently reliable*. Assume everyone positive proven otherwise, repeatedly. PCR decent test, corner conditions may yield opposite result. Always question results. Exactly! think ridiculously lucky life every single day. day brings back worst memories, want watch cartoons peace feel obligation choke turkey mashed potatoes big group. (that's joke) state US actually handled situation relatively well (went lockdown early on, put heavy restrictions place, etc)? I’m foreigner, idea Hang there, friend. I’m willing bet summer look lot normal, year bad memory.  Let’s get pizza parties “heroes work here” signs back out! seems strange though think may COVID positive, need go pharmacy pick test. seems would make sense could order online easily someone pick one store. disagree, mostly takes time see effects anything, data points yet. Acutely, vaccine seems fine, personal anecdotal experience, sick two days recovered third. one, truly one, knows mRNA gene therapy adverse effect five ten years, one knows AZD1222's effect future SARS infections years line.

I indeed front line healthcare worker transitioned lab. study taking part recruited ""high risk exposure"" individuals test interactions. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article think 50% 70% bar low, Biden president publically say ""wear mask"" he'll done more.

Humans pretty good making hell-on-earth. hope get worst hells. nurse mean deserve die either.

People acting like assholes taking precautions. Nurses suffer potentially die people's bad decisions workplaces give proper equipment staffing. sign martyrs. 

I blame single one quits would support striking en masse get proper equipment government enacts strong lockdowns slow spread.  store inside Bellatrix Lestrange as....? 
You can’t make interstate travel illegal. can’t restrict private gatherings. can’t force people wear masks outside public settings. 1 shot 3 weeks later get 2nd booster shot.  Ha....got ‘eeeem! Oh wow. absolutely could spent helping citizens get this. :( B-b-but lockdowns work! Yes, get lower dose good way train body. Enough dose body's immune system reacts defeats possibly without feeling symptoms.

That's ideal way getting ""sick.""

And quite common. Studies colds flus show happens regularly. Nah, it'll take less three additional days. need special kind braindead hit gym middle pandemic like one. muscles wait downvoted cried downvotes One many examples.

Poor minks ^^^^sadnoises   pretty awesome kids Make something illegal enforce behavior change. 100%, enough save countless lives. see another spike mid December another mid January I'm sure.  incorrectly attribute actions Trump. Conspiracy theorist always exist. Tell people died otherwise would lived vaccine came sooner. also u.s. nutritional guidelines ...because listen want ""FREE""...

Even though US best getting virus @ 11.5M, rest world (as whole) better sucking life 45M, gg world...

Are “progressive”? BIO-CIDE?  totally makes sense shake hand briefly go wash fine.
But stay room person hour+ whatever yeah way dangerous. Can’t wash you’re breathing in! I'll bet managers think real good christians.  Good news vaccine makers. lock customers cannot mix different vaccines else sever side effects.

#Sinopharm4life 😁😁😁 Unless provide evidence, stating unsupported claim, truth.

So please former people assess whether it’s latter exactly what’s happening TN. governor won’t issue anything masks even specified early churches protected county mask mandate (far little late hospital basically capacity already) specifically states mask mandate churches protected governor’s orders thus don’t wear masks inside follow kind social distancing rules, etc.. put individual churches decide imagine well that’s gone.. 

And first question got asked mandate made “what legal repercussions” like basically going people still refuse wear masks businesses won’t require them? answer nothing. I’ve noticed absolutely difference mandate vs after. aunt works Walmart 10 employees caught virus within past 10 days someone’s husband dying COVID. can’t afford take 2 weeks she’s convinced she’ll probably die gets it. She’s two time cancer survivor unfortunately still smokes. cries everyday work praying doesn’t catch it. Walmart refuses contact anyone close store down. Zero leverage.

There’s massive unemployment terribly hard skill set learn. misinterpreted wording local university switched completely online classes Thanksgiving students aren’t going home whole winter break. continue say going home Thanksgiving, returning big football game campus apartments, returning back home Christmas. surfaces harm.  may give someone emotional comfort, job.

It gives people emotional comfort simultaneously reinforcing false idea cleaning surfaces keeps us safe COVID, making reliant sanitation theater keep anxiety check. That's good thing. Different people recovered virus different number antibodies, vaccine, get sufficient dose. (nevermind scandal every years German governmental institutions record people race way...). 
But question also discrepancies seen caused race socioeconomic factors nothing skincolor (of course conditions likely people certain heritage like sickle cell disease, I'm sure linked influence Covid) I'm assuming another stream phrase, similar poggers? Social workers saints. Inject veins someone tell believe Covid know anyone died. 

Okay. know, case... Mormon church actually acting pretty responsibly early pandemic, cancelling in-person services awhile. 

Helps rely church services collect tithes. Surface transmission thought major contributing factor spread. But, clean house good! That's bit shift tone there, first said: ""a extra months waiting wont make big difference"", strawman guy pointed implied ""small difference"" 100's thousands people dying, saying: ""oh saying ignore experts??"" 


Yea experts get ears, yes also, would ""make big difference"". “I’ll play 18 holes sulk election tweeting bullshit accusations voter fraud proof. Maybe that’ll help.” 10,000 deaths per day covid-19. extra months waiting would indeed make big difference. I'll show hazmat suit takeout box. Maybe giving example calculation done results obvious ignored anyway?

Lock vs staying open actually difficult nuanced calculation. real costs associated lockdown costs hard measure hard compare (like measure 1000 extra nursing home deaths vs million extra unemployed type moral questions). people won’t listen utterly simple calculation masks essential, people won’t listen reason comes lockdowns severe 1st 2ns infection? symptoms could mild trigger enough antibodies. Yeah lived Spain I'd move different country Send don’t remove small hands supporter comments worthless bot See: People think wearing face shield alone going prevent something aerosolized. know someone still working remote full time, husband tried caring son often could focus work even get overtime pay week gave cut hours take pay cut. surprised news all..... No. *shock intensifying*
 /s yet received anything.

So getting anything lied you.

Everyone quit yesterday. requires prescription doctor...

It takes us 45 minutes get appointment kid’s Pediatrician. bring good points! ""If two sets result SQL query, would combine them?"" too. 

One last things lockdown go concert sister. miss live music. :( street festivals. 3 small studio space two smaller ones. Significantly effective wiping things. Airborne virus eventually land surfaces. People cough sneeze hand cover virus hand contaminates whatever touch like escalator handles, lift buttons etc, whoever touches hands contaminated may contaminate masks touched rib eyes.

So disinfection helps. Especially end day hvacs turned dust/virus particles starts landing surfaces. manufacturing. fact two doses. going 2021 marathon. sprint. Wouldn’t great news?! Best believe Yes, think right. COVID recovered thankfully. I'm hard time finding information someone recovered still spread it? Like reinfected, virus make potential vector? actively infected virus order spread anti-bodies system still make others around prone catching me? I'm still taking precautions I'm curious concerned/worried people like spreading others. Literally 90% sub criticizing Trump shutting whole nation. Even argue nationwide lockdown, arguing bad faith still think entire country lock down. 

At peak lockdowns, every state except South Dakota closed bars restaurants, every state except Montana Wyoming closed schools. words, 99.2% country's population lockdown included school bar closures. 

If include shelter place orders, South Dakota, North Dakota, Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, Wyoming make cut. Meaning 96.6% country lockdown include school closures, restaurant closures, shelter place order. think fine round say entire country locked down. trump talking shit masks ? Admitting playing ? election indicator lot sway moron followers ate shit up

Forcing threatening schools stay open ? Allowing cruise ships go back ?

Policy good ass Society mostly back good degree/semblance pre-pandemic normal life Autumn 2021, best case scenario. Water wet week total tests performed unique individuals 254295 reported positive cases 32705

So 32,705 positive tests Week 46 (November 9 November 15) total numbers reported dates get 31,344.

I assume 1,361 positive tests reported new cases people tested positive previous weeks retested.  could order Amazon Prime, ask friend grab one you, etc. Personally, think symptomatic people still get tests supervised medical professional tests used try catch asymptomatic presymptomatic cases workplace, schools, etc. that's 4.8 million people it. 

Texas 20k deaths currently 

.00416% deathrate amongst general populace. going say. Tuberculocidal disinfectants actually pretty great. I'm big fan Optim TB 33. healthcare worker, want first. let everyone else guinea pigs see (if any) long term side effects end being. would say nestle third worls countrys water supplies worse populations tens thousands people, probably millions total, also bad. make observation, made baseless accusation. clear obvious difference. edge lord hot take. read article:


Chief investigator Oxford vaccine team, Professor Andrew Pollard, said news encouraging, ""we're rush.""

He insisted Oxford AstraZeneca ""not competition developers - we're trying make sure high quality data… ready, that's we'll provide interim results.""

In words, making sure works. 1 month period researchers used minimum waiting time started counting cases. 1 week booster shot. someone infected then, would unclear vaccine work simply enough time yet.

But immune response builds gradually, people already pretty good response week first shot. Still, people reckless received vaccine expect. need 'leaked' reports figure one out. rather waste bunch time? I’m you. mind boggling people behaving here. things away home now, planning stay home December.   can. think worth amount effort carrying around gopro around 12 hours. 
 

You remember, nurses save lives. spend partial time readjust camera film, small minutes seconds determine whether patient lives dies bit issue it. think would really difficult find cases contact transmission. Like contact tracers unable find it, therefore case studies it. also took months figured airborne transmission possible. reason found cases larger droplet contact possibility.

Now trying find cases airborne transmission large droplets possible contact is, hard find. know one case lady it, used elevator someone later used elevator got virus. still 100% clear air could contaminated picked virus elevator buttons.  See mean?

It's possible low risk might still represent small still significant portion transmission.

And really want significant evidence possible contact. I'm really fucking tired washing groceries. Everything ruined imagine strike would vain high unemployment among population, people ready step day's notice. Trump little nothing 2 vaccines.    Think closed us massive decline cases. Probably 2022. federal government got states everything requested. usual Trump Admin communication sucked policy good. media course can't tell style substance.  ""flattened curve"" basically ideal conditions natural selection, yes. masks come in. Science learned truth: progresses one funeral time 

or [Max Planck beneficiants status quo want protect status quo. surprising obvious, people seem really avoid reality times.

Extend dictators rich people, many willingly peacefully give away power wealth, death old age latest? Even know especially affluent looking various ways extend life, willing let go. lmao that's funny. reminds Clifton Long Island. square (like super bowl square) number shootings would happen Labor Day.  live inTexas son high risk. also obvious look numbers state extremely late report new numbers. mask mandate leave house. million people infected Texas alone. like Jim Jones event sharing turkey covid instead poisoned kool-aid.  death, everyone spread massive hiccups delays first ... everyone relax nobody get overly excited give time .

It one biggest logistical operations history issues PPE, toilet paper , ramen noodles . headlines start popping delays fuck ups everyone breathe Exactly! correct, I’m assuming don’t touch everything immediately put fingers mouth. would suggest cleaning phone every day, general measure unrelated covid. real leverage millions work willing take jobs.  Please abuse Automod. Thank you. saw yesterday Vandy 6 beds remaining covid unit. mess. absolutely is. absolute loyalty corporations serves would admirable disgusting. kentuckian, man done absolutely nothing state. Nothing. Nada. care less state. He's ability stay position little risk. Ruling Washington Kentucky. Making millions stringing along coal miners making jobs dangerous lining pockets pockets mines.

Kentuckians party voters pay enough attention Mitchs history. Damn, might well go vegetarian, then. Anti-maskers necessarily vaccine. definitely want get vaccine they're source transmission. Isn’t best thing do? Without federal aid, shutting businesses make spread worse people starve death thus hit streets. 

There two choices Ohio. shut businesses remove ability millions take care not. 

I’m sure there’s single issue shutting would better option. increase spread. increase crime. increase poverty. increase death. 

So, wouldn’t mean legislature choosing correct option here? Nothing new? official position government, germany, February wear mask to.protect others. stat e mask protect yourself. Ffp2 ffp3 masknoffer protection.

The US lagging behind again? why? probably best prepared nation world still fucked up. feel really sorry lost loved ones. suspect. CDC number excess deaths 300k month ago, compared 216k attributed Yeah I'm shit longer tho news, water wet floor made floor. Absolutely horrible people must pay price sins otherwise nothing them. Can’t spend dead either. Love people downvoting, even though proof posted it. Thank you! got sent emergency room unfortunately. i'm hoping get treatment needs. Goal get zero US, literally impossible

If 99.9% cases come via breathing, 0.1% comes via surfaces think average person do? wear mask kiddo you’re crazy, brah. Say me: multiple 2 trillion dollar stimulus bills eventually come back bite you. completely agree people need see like ICU COVID patients lying deathbed Healthcare workers scrambling around risking lives.

But footage, feel like majority audience people already self aware serious COVID is. People spreading virus staying home wearing masks probably fazed videos. Probably say fake news corruption liberals

Call pessimist. year completely lost faith American system. produce videos this. Show like hospitals. people stop. Many Americans lack critical thinking. really shows handling this. honestly think need impose martial law President non-existent. 19 million animals going killed anyway skin? Yeah, we... noticed. secret. I’m sorry aunt. think major problem/reason Americans detached numbers. keep hearing 100k new cases 1k+ deaths day news delivered like they’re stats hundreds thousands lives families horribly affected. 

People dying alone we’re seeing that. It’s like hiding soldier’s caskets they’re brought home. sight, mind. Alright then. sure everyone write names down. time comes hospitalizations, know prioritize. husband’s NFL salary alone could prop 100’s small businesses. fellow Michigander, it’s time trade family another team maybe “more red team colors”. Last checked Lions BLUE. Shocking look mean exist. job provide you, see definitely exists change stance policymakers scientists ""masks work"" beginning ""masks work.""

And many studies reducing droplets definitely rigorous. Even link admit that.

Oh cool. sign saying it’s take? take experience? without jobs money buy anything enforcing 6ft distance TSA, exactly recommend plan - quick sanitizing properly. Face shields also help remove lower mask 30s confirm identify. every non-island nation crashing. Vietnam, Thailand Cambodia non-island nations totally prevented outbreaks kept borders closed. 

Canada's mistake culture, seems clear real differences Australia NZ acted later epidemic locking never pursued full elimination strategy. countries chose mitigation instead, initially pandemic plans called for, made big mistake. failure require new arrivals go managed quarantine guaranteed Canada faces ongoing local transmission thus eventual second wave. hospital RN treats Covid+ patients, appreciate supportive sub healthcare workers. Thank Welcome club. less friends, it’s best. study look this. reason it’s mentioned heavy drinking among men increased 7%, whereas heavy drinking among women increased 41%.

Yes things improve. crowded stadiums full capacity bars, masks, etc... that's end next summer stuff. believe whatever want idea things normal 5 months wrong.  good 2 week pause everyone gathering holiday? 

Grow spine rather wait thousands transmissions

Give tiny amount credit SOMETHING far little far late possibility unless underlying health condition (this include obesity, many people don’t always think about) young people okay. saying that, long term affects aren’t completely known regardless fatality rate it’s still worth keeping whatever precautions can.  Wenodis Exactly, one saves lives, nothing. Middle America sucks hard school moved fall quarter two weeks end quarter Wednesday. even think school isn’t handling well, way got part right Testing reliability issue newer rapid test coming rapid-PCR CUE funded Federal govt coming. 

Vaccine readily available world-wide may want take it. Testing might alternative option then. 

Do think Biden's administration push airport testing? can’t care people’s welfare care own. disregard health loved ones obvious. pass innocent people foregone conclusion. least self-selecting. country, collective, better folks possible.

Someone said major inaccuracy “the Walking Dead” 50% people didn’t run toward dead. longer waste breath people. point is, even without shutdowns economy fucked people thrift spending, wether want risk getting infected, saving money case lose jobs. hardcore, ""covid hoaxers."" really still there. Keeping economy open cost lives, saved economy. Sir, sure that?? Anytime someone mentions Canada good place first thing said “WELL NATIVES, NEW ZEALAND BETTER”.

People can’t understand every country flaws virus yes, probably right billions. 'natural' R0 thing (in absence public health measures like masks, lockdowns etc.) seems around 3.

To control virus long term, number needs reduced less 1 (i.e. average, infected person passes less 1 person, total number infected become lower lower time).

If vaccine 100% effective (it's not), means need vaccinate least 2/3rds population. 90% effective vaccine (more realistic), need vaccinate 2/3 / 0.9 = \~74% population.

So rough guide aiming get least three quarters people vaccinated. like 5.5 billion people worldwide. Even would even better though would reduce numbers infected much quickly, since dealing exponents here. Facing increasing criticism, California legislators defend Hawaii trip COVID-19 surge
By Patrick McGreevyStaff Writer 
Nov. 18, 20204:01 PM
California lawmakers flew conference Maui amid pandemic broke silence controversy Wednesday, defending trip calling safe despite officials home state advising people travel current surge COVID-19 cases.

The travel least ten state lawmakers drawn sharp criticism back California, observers say sends wrong message legislators leave state gather resort COVID-19 cases surging, leading tougher restrictions movement average residents.

The annual conference hosted San Diego-based Independent Voter Project also blasted watchdog groups corporate labor interests lobby Legislature pick many lawmakers’ tabs chance schmooze public eye.

“In normal times abuse office oil, utility big companies lobby Capitol paying Hawaiian getaway replete golf, hula show mai tais,” said Jamie Court, president group Consumer Watchdog. “In COVID times, abomination legislators would break quarantine play sun four-star resort.”

Statewide, COVID-19 cases first week November jumped 51%, eclipsing previous record increase 39% last week spring, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday.

About 20 legislators California, Washington Texas among attending conference Fairmont Kea Lani Hotel Wailea, rooms start $500 per night.

The four-day event kicked Monday, three days Newsom urged Californians travel state quarantine so.

Dan Howle, president Independent Voter Project, said 75 participants conference show proof negative COVID-19 test attend.

The state Department Public health guidelines note anyone arriving California states quarantine 14 days.

Howle said Wednesday lawmakers “are committed honoring 14 days” quarantine upon return conference ends Thursday unless take COVID test get back California results negative. However, state’s out-of-state travel quarantine guidelines make exception received negative test result.

“We recommending waiting three days taking test,” Howle added.

The annual conference generated controversy 18 years many legislators much travel expenses covered host — $3,500 last year — receives money special interests lobbying Capitol.

Howle declined disclose year’s corporate sponsors.

In past years, contributors conference costs included cigarette maker Altria, Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, California Beer Beverage Distributors, Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers Assn., Chevron state prison guards union.

While many lawmakers travel expenses paid host, Assemblyman Frank Bigelow (R-O’Neals) said paying way thinks trip worthwhile conference includes discussion safely reopen California’s economy amid COVID-19 pandemic.

“The blanket response Covid-19 work small businesses, schools, working families rural California,” Bigelow said statement released office. “I paying here, following strictest Covid-19 safety protocols, tested negative Covid-19 prior arrival.”

Bigelow said plans quarantine returns California.

The Independent Voter Project declined identify legislators attending annual event, acknowledged participation others stayed mum.

Those attending include Republican Assembly members Heath Flora Ripon Jordan Cunningham Paso Robles, Republican Sen. Andreas Borgeas Modesto, Democratic Sen. Bill Dodd Napa, Democratic Assembly members Blanca Rubio Baldwin Park, Jose Medina Riverside Wendy Carrillo Los Angeles, well Chad Mayes Rancho Mirage, reelection month unaffiliated political party.

Mayes declined comment.

Cunningham confirmed Wednesday conference family, saying safe environment.

“This event promotes intelligent public policy state,” Cunningham said statement. “We paid family’s tickets COVID tests personal money — state funds used.”

Flora, Assembly minority floor leader, said statement Newsom’s decision week go back restricting businesses public gatherings surge COVID-19 cases makes conference timely.

“Participants discussing safely re-open larger sectors economy discussion suddenly became urgent Newsom’s announcement Monday,” Flora said. “Simply shutting 95% state might’ve made sense back April May, understand much then. We’re way past blanket solutions.”

Court, head Consumer Watchdog, persuaded legislators’ statements.

“You discussion opening safely Zoom don’t care golf, beach [cocktails],” Court said. “This always world-class junket. year it’s also lethal one shows disrespect quarantine hunkering right thing.” Broke hand 4 weeks ago. Ended ER X-ray. packed coughing old people triaged handled way prevent spread.

Not really big mystery. Death issue here. Source peer reviewed study strong.  Untapped market. see there. it’s biggest sales months year. won’t shut anything get holiday money. every bloody thread since March. ""protocol"" flying get airplane even go near airport.  that, medical cartel would lose leverage! delivered food make extra money summer.

Who dining in? Elderly boomers assets.

Who delivering to? Apartments 20-30 somethings.  Well, people wearing 3-4 ply masks cloth masks liner, protection. personally, going anywhere people since last March. Honestly, miss eating all...we've saved ton money. we're lucky gym house pretty comfortable stay home. area, there's almost nothing can't get delivered. imperfect foods, misfit market, whole foods, curbside pickup, amazon, etc. needed leave house. That's obviously case everyone people brave going out. holidays though avoidable families unless special conditions visit relatives.  honestly, missing one holiday season really big deal keep loved ones safe. know pepole going they're going though...so Christmas mess result. Look Dakotas flying chart near end Love daddy experts reactions, none papers pass peer one study, generalizing? also published June, hardly new anymore novel ones Coronavirus shown trash.

Source please Here’s german source, relevant me. remember least one big german news program drawing similar timeline. merkel even said it: masks distancing remain established herd immunity according calculations take UK expert story? interested that, means whole world chance turn around much sooner thought. need apply miracles equally all. One hundred die then. get selfish piece shit? Yet still beds whoever needed certainly see. kinda wish yourname Sherlock. pointing title could misleading uninformed Jesus. work grocery store ended hero pay, pay quarantine, notify people someone tested positive encourage high risk employees take leave absence get unemployment. Super neat poor going poorly social distanced work november 25 ok everyone poor asshole goes social distanced thanksgiving he's piece shit, meanwhile rich virtuous staying home collecting dividend checks. real neat things work like that! guess poor schmucks going accept question home. open windows twice day 30 minutes, would help? response seems imply might actually hurt things, thought getting fresh air house, even heat bill goes up, would beneficial. incorrect? Let's overwhelm hospitals shutdown normal healthcare masses, kill couple hundred thousand people, cost nation trillions extra still broken economy ...so save small business rely public gatherings pandemic vs passing relief legislation.

Who's me! community spread high? Okay, least COVID terms they're specific people I'm talking about... focusing ""national"" group could include voters. yeah, really thing. respect vast experience, I'm curious would say now, 3.5 months later, two vaccines pushing 90% effectiveness. actually think you’re troll paid actor lol Michael murphy wrote 'wildfire' summer 1975 calling government support small business. scientific evidence widespread mask wearing slows spread coronavirus benefits economy, mid-November, 14 states statewide mask mandates place.

I'm librarian. people day. Close contact. Touching people's keycards, books, etc. We've open since May. 


And based viewed treated betters (our users), fully expect end line vaccine. Essential, expendable. Lord said:""Infect Thy neighbor!"". plenty conspiracy theorist susceptible people throughout world.

Don’t kid yourself. study talking can't even classified scientific paper even submitted peer review.

All ones Coronavirus shown trash.

Influenza closest half decent studies.

Read experts reactions, none papers pass peer brings us back started, tried masks help end. Son, country live in? that's huge depending factor. ""If risk, leave house there’s vaccine""

Ah yes, everyone trophy-wife super-rich guy afford stop working. guess eff old people don‘t want completely socially isolated.  Actually, Fall/Winter peak supposed right around inauguration. post-Christmas/New Year's surge far worse Thanksgiving. hope police raids place shut down. absolutely deplorable. I. Would hope hasn’t approved. doubt vaccines distributed approval. Traffic lights don’t cut accidents? certainly impinge freedom cruise intersection, surely provide benefit. Fauci, gives conservative estimates give drawn timeline, thinks find state normal spring. also said April.

We literally expert say UK (I'm US, applicable still) back normal spring. Except TEA severely curtailed school closings (schools shut week time) Abbott Paxton overruling attempts local shutdown curfew orders. it’s pretty much limited right mask mandates (infrequently enforced) asking nicely people please stay home. AFAIK distribution managed companies, depending region.

Anyway, US signed 100 million doses, EU 200 million (+100 million option). Note dual dose vaccine, orders cover half number people. “large chunk” actually good 50 million Americans.

By end 2020, produced 50 million doses, half going US. means beginning 2021, US might able vaccinate 12.5 million people, another 37.5 million later order.

The number doses expect produced end 2021 1.3 billion. Divide two again, you’ll see small number compared world population. It’s barely enough cover Europe US.   Haha...I thinking thing. trump burn house exits beyond me. 

Oops...spoke soon, apparently. gym safer extra air room abovehead ridiculous. I've athlete almost entire life gym rat throughout college... gym almost decade still peak shape, many ways better shape lifting.

Oh wait, planned best extract living costs kids instead making sane science based policy, gonna push blame everyone else run bank. keep resting, covid known severe ups downs. Hopefully beat quickly, don’t take chances. Congrats you’ve built .0000001% needed hospital. Mind you’re using spent money already agreed upon price hospital insurance company. Welcome plan won’t work.  Hey I’m crying people chose interact increasing risk. 
Seems like easy fix know think HEPA filters casual use... extremely common bought basically retailer like Costco, Amazon, target, etc. 3 home one office work. I'm news, water wet. Seems like are...  Let guess official Whitehouse response label fake news Democrats imply anything lesser ran n95 let’s honest, mask N95 really protecting virus.

The problem stance/statement creates two expectations:

* expectation cloth coverings primarily intended protect wearer.

And that, false.

Saying ""your mask protect you,"" requires response ""my mask protection."" 

* downplaying layered protection.

Despite first point, protection factor multi-layer mask may actually like single percentage (or less) risk reduction, many areas everything counts. Face shields accepted beneficial, though seen extreme. Face shield plus mask best average person reasonably do. virtue approved amendment, amendments part constitution. lower taxes please resort gambling?

It's one reasons important distance people even appear fine. also hard control spread. amazing people willing take Pfizer drugs change balance chemicals brain, suddenly don’t trust injection basically weakened version virus.

Technically vaccine weakened version virus - simply part virus' genetic material. works way - body recognizes virus develops countermeasures it.

The point still stands though. process new, seem like something that's particularly risky. body picks viruses genetic material time. local news station/health department tells go get it.

Questioning things make denier. hope Europe wait long It’s definitely cleaning theater. don’t think there’s harm it, don’t think it’s big impact. 20 second hand washing. harm, don’t think it’s helping ton. 

It’s shown studies finite transmission isn’t major threat virus. thought was, people anchored idea, mask best weapon currently it. obsessive hand surface washing, simple mask. They're going keep climbing counties like mine keep shit [like Halloween parties. Veterans day parade. little hospital already sending people Nashville this. schools closed rest week (I doubt they'll open back tbh) numbers going roof. that's going stop Thanksgiving, Christmas parade Christmas stuff that's going start taking place Thanksgiving. someone regularly gets tested, RX version would great 

Imagine virtual teledoc appointment right away, able pickup test within hour 

Right bottlenecks current testing flows lot places (scheduling, etc) —and many places take week longer get test. provides alternative use resources would hurt hospitals. wouldn’t surprised public events surrounding Christmas New Years Eve banned.  Canadian parliament openly stated plans financial reset quarantine camps COVID... cool that?  Act Treason Yeah that's fair enough, wanted point there's rife undercounting everywhere world. 

I think know true death toll COVID19 years future, calculated many people refuse believe it. number slips hotel quarantine (and border controls), new protocol going test workers weekly.

Most Aussies stunned wasn’t already happening.

The experts saying logic weekly testing would mean someone symptoms would wait next scheduled test day rather seeking test straight away.

But since spread cleaner 2 security guards (and none noticeable symptoms, didn’t get test), they’ve changed minds need regular testing asymptomatic workers.

My personal suspicion got bit mentally stuck happened back March asymptomatic spread considered rare, Australia managed control first wave symptomatic testing.  didn’t think needed mandatory asymptomatic testing, hadn’t problem ... now. People US capitalism preached since birth. tied patriotism democracy like inseparable. It’s tenants preached like gospel questioning unamerican. Meanwhile top corporate pile everything avoid capitalism every turn. competition shows either buy out, best crush advantages, use bought paid Congressmen legislate competition away. suckle government teat subsidies compete contracts things go south first line Washington hat hands demanding public money cover mismanagement.

Meanwhile rank file idiot still buys idea laissez-faire capitalism good thing works well. Time time see outcome unregulated big business act like problem much regulation inherent flaw system requires fix.  Idk law yes, absolutely vaccinated work hospital clinic. General question, call nonsensical find interesting.

Is amount people deny covid really significant/high? experience people deny covid really really rare.

However, amount people ""downplay covid"" rather significant. (EDIT: honest: one them, since february stance matter fortified, AMA) 

How experience? ""science"" think support. impacted SD, great. fact they're flooding state patients government refused anything about, taxes subsidizing failings. state hospitals full we're explosion, residents going suffer.

How fair right?  Remember Dow went speculating oil years. Oil proved actually short supply all. DECADES speculation oil driving Dow down, nothing.

Now real emergency somehow become magically immune speculation... what's that? 

Had markets speculated COVID instead it, governments would reacted much aggressively. preserving market speculating likely outcomes markets supposed guaranteed poor reaction government public. 

Investors used COVID way shuffle money around drive bailout based economy speculate properly damage would do. feel like I'm pretty alone worrying long term health effects. (less alone sub still) ""Before allowing"". prisoners? LOL. fuck outa communist shit. That’s great, specialized refrigeration needs.... 😒👎🏼 sad mental capacity see similarities. Besides ended arbitrarily defined personal liberties feel justified violating reason. China whole definition what's reasonable greater good. Even someone blinded see that. obviously universal truth regard telling even bother try defend definition.

Also please stop invoking science like form deity even likely seems like you.  Talking giving shit, going government shutdown December, affect things like testing? Vaccine distribution? Freedom kill neighbors! Call old fashioned think kids right grow private environment life broadcasted world. work private school. ask supervisor work home one day grandmother uncle immune compromised. wait meeting they're today. 

my depression getting worse. didn’t need White House memo tell that. ALDI vaguely disguised interview question every position. get COVID till know 100% safe. lab rat nature.

Does *really* sound like better strategy? mean useless


seeing things going one single confirmed case catching COVID surfaces. breathe in.

Out millions millions cases, single confirmed fomite transmission confirmed.

Of course nobody claim impossible, they've caught giving bunk advice (masks help) want caught giving bunk advice again, claim there's non-zero chance reality there's zero proof possible.

As mentioned elsewhere, thing proven virus live 1+ hour different surfaces, literally thing studies definitively proven. No, want get anyone sick. say differently? think? country fucked. many ignorant people. aware that, ""being less reliable"" one thing, ""literally even trying"" another level, IMHO. Virologists screaming void fall/winter surge awhile. confirm, worked ALDI chicken came Tyson boxes. Go tesla go! away moon! ;) free market free, clubs reopen new ones open demand.

Prediction: demand OP states pre-med, supposition likely correct. bunch people deciding declare pre-med months pandemic means nothing. Many drop point “calling” translate grades, reality, etc. wonder mass infections living condos though. Going elevator make infected someone coughed right got airborne major transmission route. type swab test everyone influenza present symptoms October April. comfortable, refusing cause uncomfortable unimaginable me. takes like 2 seconds. feel like touching back eye, I'm gonna get Tamiflu guaranteed 5 days work, plus fever subside, I'm in. get probably 2 4 flu tests year (and get flu almost yearly). Kind nervous test positive civid 14 day hospital quarantine here, pets dietary restrictions worry about. (Flu quarantine mandatory, home) I'm one people lives paycheck-to-paycheck completely understand. surprised. best defense virus still simply anyone suspected contact positive case strictly quarantine 2 weeks ( 3 , absolutely safe ). Either develop symptoms needs looked really get tested. don’t you’re probably infectious even asymptotic case. need take chill pill Thank modding us. share ""hey that's political"". know diffivlculty there's auto mod filtering rubbish there. Good job. hope over. Thank again! Yet mask enforcement stores. Animal Farm right? Definitely surprising me. worked Tyson processing plant. plant Center, TX disgusting. employee parking littered empty alcohol bottles used condoms. large portion America works paycheck-to-paycheck. may option. Adelaide (location current cluster) ~2000km(1250miles) Brisbane (location sporting event). ticketing company traced Adelaide purchased tickets barred 5 people already Brisbane attending. Vietnam Thailand? islands managed Covid-19 situation well. 

&amp;#x200B;

UK example island messed badly response. Oh hey, turns already avoiding them. Problem typically confirm reinfection unless sequence virus times could still detecting old virus. arent enough. Failure really utilize ability sequence virus one many failures contact tracing. Hopefull, change.  Hum, (the current administration) trying fight all?? Look, sound political it’s really not. can’t stand Trump I’m quite glad lost election. HATE assumption fault left charge would 20% less is...bullshit. 

First, guys vastly overestimate much control govt population (and population’s ability make bad choices.)

Second, never forget Trump treated left something prudent RIGHT MOVE...

Trump banned air travel (except returning US citizens) China early pandemic. one times felt much smarter status quo. Possibly dumb luck whatever. right move. 

Nancy Pelosi started literally wondering around Chinatown SF looking Chinese people hug camera show woke was. called Trump racist xenophobe simply banning air travel main hotspot. 

That whole thing ridiculous. 

Trump handled HORRIBLY. But, ok convinced left would’ve saved day either. Exactly. 3rd frequent cause death contagious cold virus. That’s pretty scary taken seriously. don’t think need lock you’re house common sense measures like wearing mask large gatherings without masks help. point said there’s need curfew since there’s reason people leave house, is.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* amazing 2D cartoonish villains actually exist real life. yes tbh testing reactions Nice inversion, never seen body magic picture box tell worry.. thought read trial people vaccinated 2:1 ratio. i.e. 2 vaccinations 1 placebo.

Maybe, slowing rate symptomatic infections? don’t get vaccinated get sick, banning public places helping anyone vaccinated Shocked pikachu. Yes are, we're like 1/3 America's deaths adjust population. good Taiwan South Korea way better US Europe. don’t want information State system, tell provider mark “non-consent.” stop State information now, personal data deleted five years declared disaster ends.

 trust state keep information protected. reduce number people getting vaccine. people already said want ImmTrac2 also used help providers State track vaccines, adults need opt in.

 statement seems opposite article said. ""You tried best failed miserably. lesson is: 'never try'.""

- Homer Simpson. non-priority group(NOT old, front-line worker, immunocompromised) likely eligible vaccine another six months least.

I'd surprised many priority group get Christmas. disclosing real numbers Underrated comment right here. point would virus start spreading slowly many already infected? asymptomatic people still susceptible? immune? European countries form money bail system far extreme circumstances. 
I sorry lack education. Translation: ""We going mismanage purchases way much, keeping doses hands people going turn around give to. Say thank now, done anything all."" Yes balancing desires key healthy lifestyle. Speaking which, betting workers getting COVID much tipping scales extremely unhealthy lifestyle.  Everyone school administrative staff know pushing around atlantic article children spread virus, even NIH funded group called pushing propaganda school districts across country. peer reviewed, small study school districts little community spread. 

&amp;#x200B;

There countless new studies show children fact key spread, closing schools opinion would lessen degree seperation among communities slow coronavirus spread considerably. essence corporate culture. Good, have. returning flu would go visit family assuming feel good enough get there? Wisconsin that's pretty small group. anecdotal, even heard anyone seen family year. Unless people long term care.

I think type person isolated elderly relatives year, you, likely continue holidays.  opposed fashion fur? miss time don’t believe specialist going find another one. say thing know it’s true. 

The US (world?) weaponized every doesn’t fit personal agendas fake outcome. need go back trusting people’s degrees life experience fake. fear kids future right now. feel idea you’re saying, percent South Dakotans don’t heads asses want able safely go store, nurses hospital workers deserve better safer working conditions they’re forced nonsense? would prohibiting entrance across state lines look like you? Stopping every person highway make prove they’re allowed travel? would this? local cops? Don’t know would end? found [seven pay every single employee employer don’t become homeless. like gives break protestors social justice protests, virus monster understands people allowed things. Wife works airport least seatac,,, one cares. Busy usual. remind thing would pay watch doubt indoor dining closing right move throw people street zero help?

2021 going year giant corporations. Small business take years recover this. Person calls people stupid arrogant arrogantly posting something stupid, appreciating irony. people already posted better explanation correct answer. think? Thanks! point ridiculous far heinous people like murderers rapists still receive treatment. 

That guy Donald trump lives head rent free don’t he. 

We could ridiculous statements too. People car accidents shouldn’t receive medical attention. reckless driving could’ve killed EMT elderly person. know drive non essential things. selfish. stay home avoid car deaths. Fuckin selfish drivers roads. 

Fuckin joke. May suggest yellow star instead brand “ enemies state”

Next you’ll advocating camps too. Use “ quarantine macht frei” gates know there's even level bring back March level ""give fuck,"" especially since vaccine news coming out. Even gets worse, people wholeheartedly comply like March know whether Ebola, flu, 2 months, 2 years. country given called misinformation. fuck eco-fascist right. going Wikipedia page, deceivingly written. Googled it, found numerous articles topic. Thanks correcting mistake! college student, think ever go back ""normal"" know absolutely nasty school must get sick often. Florida curfew midnight least, major clubs closed MONEY, ever forget that! actually bars open texas sit table..you can't walk around mingle..is like TN? Governors cannot control right back 5 month. 

In 5 months April tens millions people vaccinated one 2 vaccines 90%+ effective. miracle. better hurry get infected first. Can’t vaccinate dead. That's nice, basic bimbo.

In news... Nobody cares. lol friends work USA ignored visit. don’t visit family anything. make sure holiday shopping open capitalist market can’t possibly get sick going mingling unsafe retail sector. Im oklahoma, way shape form ignore science thinking make believe deity protect me. Im ashamed state. It’s hard say. supported fuller lockdown initially mask mandate. Locking FULLY month might prevented say entire year. 

I think rubber-banding yes yes damage. first person 8 years understand user name without explain it. Thank you, doctor! Although deaths we're getting 2-3 weeks ago look cases we're back since deaths current cases know weeks. worldometers 7 day moving average 80k-100k 2/3 weeks ago. We're probably getting close 300k cases seem abit high 2/3 weeks ago.  youre good know Worked pretty well germany. Yeeeeeaaaaaah hehe  Yeah, I'm skipping Thanksgiving Christmas. I'm least quarantining 14 days driving dad's day. probably too, bet girlfriend doesn't. super-risky, though. dark winter ahead indeed, we'll build back better. That's agenda '21.

'21's gonna lit. don’t even work double blind would better must unmasked (to eat), could several small tables. One household per table, mask you’re eating. 90% hobbies impossible due Covid! Real double edged sword here. bright side, hospitals full, people can't hospitalized! hope mink strain extinct. need pay specie extermination. (That can't keep people out, politically physically)

I'm trying hint towards nations talking about.  However; sub bans work describes it.

Western countries cannot do. western countries can't even get away Australia does. Putting asylum speakers island prison life...

They tried get rid leader here.... making wait weeks....lol Yeah breathe deep free covid air there! I’m still working bar tonight! weathers nice I’m sure we’ll busy outside. I’ll try ignore 1 15 Chicagoans currently covid 😷 take kindly 'round here... Rules thee, me. Hypocritical asses. automatically contrarian? chance inform someone they’re incorrect why, instead berate them? likelihood didn’t know wrong, wouldn’t said much. Can’t feelings something you’re aware it.

Edit: I’m gonna keep going. exactly kind response fuels anti-science denialist folks’ feelings. It’s wonder many people disregard facts facts used gut punch instead common aspiration. Fucking hell.  solution protesters treated unfairly, solution protesters treated fairly. agree majority protests went years ones nothing happened. frustrating several completely peaceful cops showed cops began instigating violence sides. Obviously get fast first sign violence, pretty rare. sure data using. hasn’t bad initial surge look last couple weeks another surge.

Personally, started going gym I’m like one wearing mask, drive college bars lines door, stores crowded, ect; 

I’d like think second surge temporary lucked lax restrictions it’s ticking time bomb really, close 8k cases today? Yeah it’s already going less. Saying food, kids, health, safety

just seems preachy. say “our” confuse outcome strategy. consider large portion population comes looking active medical care - especially **~0.2%** population hospitalized facing hospitalization *in last week alone.* 

There 924,000 hospital beds US (or, 0.3% population). vast majority beds designed use normal pre-COVID day. Stick right buttox  Thats amazing true. I'll look into. I'd love start smoking again. Fucking depressed anyway usually routine come home work, make/eat dinner wife, go gym hobbies house, come home, watch TV read bed go sleep.

Now everything ""work home eat"" leaves massive hole fill. drinks much tempting then, especially get depressed easily indoors whole day. yes, let's congregate &amp; spread. sit back, take pause, watch shit hit fan. happy holidays! Anti-maskers directly affect health Medical personnel. Medical staff dying like flies many Americans can't bothered care health fellow citizens.

Anti-maskers think wearing mask public practicing Social Distancing way much ask them.
They think onerous, invasive, ""restricts freedom.""

But get COVID-19, difficulty breathing rushed Emergency Room, *THEY SICK HIGHLY CONTAGIOUS VIRUS DIRECTLY THREATENING LIVES EVERYONE WORKING HOSPITAL.*

I suggest Anti-Maskers COVID-19 Deniers get special ""Donald Trump Liberty"" stamp ID says voluntarily exercising personal freedom choosing wear mask comply social distancing. Since virus ""Hoax"" intubated ER would infringe upon personal Freedom, turned away hospital. 

They go home, they'll perfectly Free suffer consequences selfishness idiocy. Let endanger family.

At least killing doctors nurses EMTs.  really wasting vaccine state run Governor DeathSentence, who's population clearly give fuck medical workers? point, I'm done Florida, I'm pro-climate change. Shocking! Well shocking. is!!! Right time! men...

It’s post study women. Well, shaming certainly doesn’t make folks reading change ways. understand frustration, truly won’t change others, divide make conceal behavior. vape weed instead. Figure healthier drinking, let's honest, I'm gonna one other. Sad news = people want watch it, people watch = less profits. ones asking widely known strategy anyways ones globetrotting spreading everyone else.

The problem they're spreading low-risk people. problem they're spreading at-risk populations, like 65 years old. attack problem head-on protect directly, rather trying round-about way protecting them? probably expected people follow rules. Good. entire fucking government needs adopt mask mandate. baked catastrophe horrifying you, look climate change that’s already baked worldwide man 1 week future sure dark times ahead, goddamn

Yep. kicker kick ass vaccines pipeline, apparently way effective ever dreamed of. People gyms almost always ≥6ft apart lifting. Also, masks required. got dual citizenship, allowed cross back forth?? Mass hysteria misinformation fueling backlash. Come on, athletes get close fans. zero it. Reddit bad makes wonder many people fake posters trying cause panic fighting. exact thing happened son. soar throat Friday. Saturday watched football UFC 6 hours basement, pretty much ventilation. Sunday lost taste smell got tested came back positive.

None four people, two us sitting couple feet away, got infected. guess shedding virus yet. That's better whoever (Governor Newsom?) suggesting lower mask take bite raise immediately. This. stopped listening politics, get news scientists now. county judge Lina Hidalgo mayor Sylvester Turner fighting like hell help us. It’s Governor Abbott refusing shut state again. thankfully see people wear masks social distance places around here. It’s going awful month. seeing current spike 2 weeks Halloween. thanksgiving give us?  Explain recall correctly, decreases compliance public health mandates time one factors implicated high transmission death rates Imperial college projections spring. ^(No shit) phase 3, good phase 2 results came today. It’s weird many people telling others don’t need mental health. “You don’t need gym brooo go fucking forest hang branches warrior pose you’ll better shape anyone lifts you’ll never another mental health issue related working ever again” go give money businesses. Yes tested. found proximity someone tested positive tested whole family, children too. excellent news story Vermont used targeted approach contain virus. example, homeless found unable isolate likely get infected. government rented hotel rooms homeless. Also, person tests positive, given $1000 worry lost income staying home work. Also food distributed test positive need leave home buy food.

Too often states failed people tested positive told stay home given resources help isolate, thus they'd fail comply efforts prevent virus spreading. Unless california lawmaker need travel Hawaii ""talk reopen state"" almost certainly worse Bring neighbor, build grave  right, small task. also task we've successfully every day many decades now. Yea, surge unprecedented, existing capability nothing sneeze at, they've pre-planning trial-running now. Okies weird... *Shrug* change? thought said heat effect (other people flocking indoors use AC spreader box) site predictable Yeah lmao work coffee shop we’re understaffed hardly time clean anything. mandated COVID measures hardly ever followed. get busier every day. Trying decide unemployed risking exposure dangerous point. Leaning towards unemployment. Got twenty grand month pay people, that’s icu travelers command.... Right I'm hoping enough people sick already travel host, help us cut total number gatherings some. Kinky. make super political every president increased size deficit. honestly believe party would less deficit point, think you’re ignoring facts. eighty year old father asked people gotten stupider last years, one ""all new music bad"" things experience get old. thought quite seriously it, and... Yes. Yes have. originally thought stupidity louder easier find, I'm reconsidering that. Ahhh ....as Jesus said infect thy neighbor. They’re outlier situations media sure shit going cover. /r/woosh imagine Fauci smacking food ranting week. She’s wife Matthew Stafford, Lions qb. ain’t eating take out, she’s eating caviar lobster shit. virtue signaling opposite direction. among hospitalized patients.

1 every 3 people someone working hospital might seen, interacted with, provided care to, died. brutal heartbreaking. keep remembering [Helen Ooyang's covid can't believe we're asking healthcare workers country go again, many months later. inexcusable really. Probably Nunavut Manitoba currently higher per capita 7 day averages provinces. excess mortality numbers cooked too? *NYC entered chat* Says person doesn’t work health care yet feels free lecture others it. Covid! hear this? Kelly Stafford living. There’s harm employees forced useless cleaning. Cleaners generally pretty harsh tendency absolutely destroy people’s skin forced use day - it’s happened lot friends retail jobs. Really? Republicans shown money debt dont matter. I'm saying we're near it'll weeks certainly then. next thanksgiving atleast things alot better pfizer vaccine looking file approval soon moderna vaccine came promising results earlier week. obviously there's still alot challenges ahead limited supply initially getting everyone vaccinated etc. light end tunnel *Bring daughter slaughter* first choice slogan. Um, sedated ventilator? know one sub extroverted understand people absolutely need interact people. Imagine making introvert live house party year. would absolutely unbearable them. That's like extroverts. live area high mask usage cases still going  projections optimistic. states COVID spreading fastest ones whose pollical leaning states less stop spread. Nice see hard work FL getting rewarded. first ones getting this! seem like mature, fully functioning, well adjusted adult. going gym ever since gyms opened back up..it really helps mentally..and everyone wears masks gym wipes every use hoping right.

I skeptical we'd even get vaccine. I've updated expectations lol Top Darwin awards leaderboard. I've screaming whole time. People cushy fucking jobs WFH bewildered many can't social distance, business suing stay open. Meanwhile they'll qualms Uber Eats driver getting ramen delivery. Completely touch working class. mUh eConomY situation. believe one difficulties confirming Fomite transmission.

The way could confirm number people exactly 0 outside contact anyone caught Covid. someone catches Covid, far explainable caught grocery shopping, kid school, coworkers, stuff bought. would suggest US presented professionally world stage people would vaccinated quickly.  Next title: Zombie Apocalypse Starts Florida. laugh I'll cry... Also, Ontario, leader doofus.

See also: Alberta Masks better lockdowns distancing. 

Rather making 6 rules enforcing none them... awake one... force people follow it. 

Even conservative Supreme Court said masks debate. Shocking. much experts get paid again? “Leaked whit house report” 
So conspiracy awesome. Except it’s pro Covid people believe it. Christ 😂 BLM protests also akin drunk driving? government (CDC) continually publishing recommendations based latest science, ignoring them. least early summer stating surfaces aren’t primary vector transmission, continuing recommend hand washing. read science it, tl;dr viral material viable infect someone needs stay moist enough come contact mucus membrane. would careful rub eyes public, door handles tables etc really people getting sick. Ooooh really thanksgiving like it’s 1621. op. feel like reading anything im saying. want successfully keep population home need get soap box reddit write legislators DC want shut down. need raise awareness towards goal. Yelling OP individual nothing societal problem individual problem. always interesting me. sheer incompetence high level management (some appointed shareholders) allowed repeatedly ruin companies. insane. They’re drinking’ COVAID.  Lemmings heading cliff grabbing anyone else take them. NM here. Super tight lockdowns time, schools full virtual, article showing super big case rise. last 2-3 days, we've gone nutso charts.

So, conclusion they're drawing feels...premature. $$$ important lives. really puts context bad situation ND SD. It’s easy see overall numbers low. percent population, blowing everyone else away. Travel nurses easily get $5,000+ per week 48 hours moment. contracts well north that. fiancee found one 60 hours $8,000 per week. one wears masks gym, still even though I’ve it. It’s absurd. complaining able breathe running, lifting, ect; fine mask on. hoping right. need vaccine bad. remember isn’t likely option vaccine next months. Moderna also probably approved coming weeks others looking promising Oxford J&amp;J. vaccine coming out, would agree would slow process. hope companies vaccines, faster get everybody. Man sorry loss sounds like amazing woman. Unfortunately still alot people still taking damn pandemic seriously spokesperson Pfizer said vaccine candidate receives emergency use authorization, “we believe would ethical responsibility inform study participants availability Emergency Authorized Vaccine eligibility requirements vaccine.”

The New York-based pharmaceutical company would ***propose allow anyone received placebo ongoing late-stage clinical trial cross vaccine arm study.*** change would subject input FDA regulatory authorities.  ThanksGiving Allowed. Silence. Discipline.Remorse. Welcome Great Reset. old passive-aggressive vague response. Always good solid debate! know I!? Suicides way up.

Financial pressure factor. 323 sailors ship per wiki offered far, aside trying put down? didn’t read current panicked. looked back like “oh... yeah know” think simple reason governments provinces know soon go lockdown they'll lockdown April. trying delay long possible avoid lockdown fatigue maintain effectiveness.

I agree think thats reason. add list everything else see. Uhh... pretty easy lock Nunavut Manitoba.

Nunavut total 38k people. Manitoba 1.3 million. entire population Manitoba fit large town Ontario. population 75% one city.

Also, Ontario, leader doofus. going according plan then... /s still wipe food delivery put food home food storage containers. rest, unpack immediately wearing mask (so accidentally touch nose) wash hands well. I've noticed neighbors stopped leaving nonperishables three days well. Yes bring neighbor, people dying get in. American businesses don’t think long term anymore. It’s short term thinking, period. stockholders want stock prices go every quarter.  honest, even everyone vaccinated everyone gonna come new excuse everyone go outside. Cause everyone secretly loves living like this. may spreading uncontrolled unchecked state, states restrictions lax nonexistent residence said states travel states restrictions turn spread Covid there, without states closing borders, see way stop virus spreading states actually trying control I've read death rate lowered 30%. quick math...

150,000*.7 = 105,000 cases spring based information alone. factors involved though. really yet April death levels yet based moving average, time we're also seeing deaths yet 150k cases per day. Insert whiny child “NO!” Consisting 4 syllables here. 

—America Home made masks work... ""work"" mean prevent COVID-19. 

BUT .... intended that. slow transmission potentially aid getting lower viral load get infected.

Just vaccine necessarily prevent getting COVID-19.  may make infection less serious... lower mortality. 

Reddit full golden dagger people. Playing many video games. real world work way.

They work.... say, better them, without them. data suggest then? Like worse immunities majority people immune long time? mean people public/customer/user facing jobs considered essential? could see lot people deal end users considered essential. Well...that person included self characterization, logic it’s really ironic, it’s beating dead horse.

If don’t anything offer make comment put someone objectively harm good. Thanks that. Fucking Tom Brady gets everything. live tell you’re wrong. I’d say 70/30 mask wearing. Majority businesses require mask. Good job making shit up. agency’s first news briefing months

lol... guess they've occupied waffling online bother actually briefing public?  really. public health person knows people get fatigued time. It’s data scientists don’t. couple neighbors invite, muhahaha. need ridiculous level experience make predictions comes vaccines impact public health measures line, even immunologist epidemiologists got lot wrong comes already. Canada infected populist? Ignore. Aslong wearing mask trying avoid close people fine. would put going store essential thing Governor, ""personal responsibility"" working plan?  Ha! Let sub tell still near end pandemic. Everything feels pointless right now. Yeah took time actually read (I mean mostly conclusions such) studies actual medical journals, pretty character since I’m usually article skimmer, mostly seemed suggest 99% people antibodies lasting minimum 9 months. reputable one could find New England Journal Medicine. want say studied people Iceland? replying ""proud"" ""boy"".  LOL

""boy"" operative word. Yup got negative result last night! Quarantined test, skipped stores seeing people, obviously waiting results. Driving car, myself, see one family member whose self-isolated 2+ weeks. know everyone circumstances ability so, feel pretty confident I'm bringing coronavirus home that's good lol Differences exposure ambient temperatures sunlight. Cold dark conserves particle. Hot bright destroys it. mean Disneyland know what's worse working amazon?? income. take consideration lot things, education level, salary, family, habits, expected lifespan, etc. family member passed early came I'm kinda familiar process. might different per state, know. study shit show

Its better mask studies. observational.

If want argue shit shows disgraces science, well argue there. thats also admitting basing policy garbage studies. know it’s owned Bezos right?  going herd immunity ""strategy"" natural infection. least observe virus behaves wild mitigation, albeit sparsely populated place. shorter incubation period would actually make pandemic much *easier* control. part SARS-1 much easier control...that, &amp; fact fever suppressed SARS-1 victims. hope time tell Eh, lump Christianity together. anything, fact lasted 2000 years shows peaceful, hateful religions last long.

Sects branch other, short term hateful sects, long run peaceful variants always win out. mom's church shut back March, remained shut entire time. there's vaccine life transitions new normal, they'll congregation back, idiots refused shut people much longer. true, isn’t it? many dead ethnically Indian? everything right. Used sanitizer, cleaned surfaces, stayed 6 feet away.”

These probably exact methods employed people planning large Thanksgiving gathering, ""but we'll take precautions!"" say straight face ""If anything hide, let police violate 4th amendment"" seeing worst worst patients dying, go home end night drive bars drive restaurants they're packed full people wearing masks,"" said Michelle Cavanaugh, nurse Nebraska Medicine Medical Center Omaha. ""I wish could get people see COVID eyes."" reasons there’s increase. Schools opened back up. work high school burbs Chicago 50 cases went remote. still making staff come work. Schools open plus covid fatigue causing it. Also liberal friends still hanging friends shit people point fingers responsibly blame everyone  earth could anyone think hoax?!?! post going age like fine milk big public policy implications. 

If people Denmark get covid rate without mask order, would argue strict mask mandates. reminds LV nurse bet patient would die covid positive person still contagious 14 days initial symptoms still persistent cough?

My teacher 2 weeks covid positive. came back still coughing like mad woman. Hmm, don’t say. I’ll morning . guess many apocalyptic zombie movies TV shows based America.
You guys perfect set successful pandemic.
It's heartbreaking.  Yup! know viral load matters people like bank tellers cashiers risk given constant exposure. would prevent getting spreading it. Catholic schools Staten Island went full remote last week. hate say it, living South Dakota I'm really surprised. governor really done much all. leaving personal responsibility. worked well us far. really surprise Okay really seem listed filter no-no word using uncensored trips bot delete comment abuse without fail 

I reposted offending comments censored nothing else changed peep Auto Mod exactly reason almost one year pandemic proper longitudinal studies Covid after-effects. fund studies sweep rug pay healthcare/unemployment costs.  That’s next level math there. Fuck didn’t think I’ll go ice skating build wreath. can’t imagine fun filled holiday time! get in, would say full actors. cultures clearly better others. rational follow science keep pandemic control. Others believe internet memes think virus dying hoax.

Some cultures understand times need pull together one, greater good. cultures shackled kind dumb religion ""freedom"", point cooperation becomes impossible selfishness (*) rules day. That's difference matters.

---

(*) - BTW, ""freedom"" code ruthless, blind, self-destructive selfishness, case that's obvious already. shit needs go trash heap history. Politicians gonna fundraise politician dinners. 

Is smart? No.

Does make wonder there's kind conspiracy *actually* virus deadly telling us opposite nefarious purposes behaving way know something virus?

Also STOP COUNT!! hope get vaccine hospital workers Christmas it’s going get rough. never considered curbside pickup pre-Covid. always done shopping, wasn’t bad enough seriously consider alternatives. Exactly would be? Possibly summer 2021. Although would worried state world then. lot poverty? violence countries/areas safe? (Places like NYC seeing lot crime this). It'll things go back normal real. 

But still, live life take chances. careful there.   keep trying change subject fact moron suffers delusion yelling people online changes virus.

The virus care think think. sense, I'm virus' side. Yes, known biontech developed vaccine Pfizer producing it. Still every american source mentions Pfizer. tacit non-voters okay either way. apathy also bad.. post removed cannot verify reliable source.

DNA copied mRNA. mRNA read Ribosomes produce proteins. mRNA broken recycled.

If directly add new mRNA like vaccine does, cell produce protein bit mRNA breaks down. Since DNA altered anyway, cell unchanged afterwards.

Cancer autoimmune disease would require DNA changes. Texas pulled exactly shit. Thank work. ridiculously shortsighted Abbott! think it’s better bodies piling one work them?

You know, never occurred might temp/traveling embalmers times like these? I’m glad states sensible temp licenses. need protect vulnerable. /r/rimjob_steve Canada problem right wing libertarianism socially liberal individualism amongst far many members population. We're realistically little better USA regard.

Obviously we're going screwed USA is, saw 1100 deaths past 3 weeks. Prior that, essentially took months go 9k 10k deaths.

We 50k active cases right now. weeks ago 10k active cases. ""Trump Tits"" midwestern GOP governors need stand trial Hauge right along President.  Wow, TIL. Thanks! happens someone misses 21 day deadline getting second dose? know believe last time checked weren’t supposed hasten “call”. need cops busting parties handing tickets, can't even get law enforcement comply much less people. People selfish every man bimself liberal order, wouldn’t call white male landholders voting democracy hold vaccine closet two decades reason.

Vaccines made new magical space ingredients. made known entities, usually surprise side effects apparent specific ingredients. Barring immediate immune response effects, Vaccines exactly unknown science.

Are worried effects flu vaccine 20 years now? Why, part think cause effects? ingredients? look every single thing goes them.

If specific worry, would ask list ingredients. Wait vaccine, get list ingredients, see every single one pretty much non-event worry. different flu vaccine. Get ready everyone, zombie apocalypse gonna start fine give individual leeway, long society whole still act concert needed. happens Australia, obviously. could happen America religion ""freedom"", also obviously. process vaccine living memory developed fast?  Wow think failing realise much data go several trials involving 40000 people each. 

Like going take thease company's word going recheck all. 

A lot line fuck approve ineffective unsafe vaccine. public's trust gone point. 

Some things take time. Considering tools like getting vaccines approved less year miracle. mean, way corporations always stand benefit economic recessions. got bailed '08 they're getting bailed small businesses disappearing alarming rates. might lose money short term obviously matters seeing they're trying reopen ASAP, logic really hold up. logic works people. It’s actually say pass budget.

They refuse take action it’s politically risky so.

Government supposed big things, like taking trends scientific knowledge crafting plan balances life economy.

Instead nothing.

Can’t wait sell vacation rentals free FL forever.  Oh lawd Entire world Covid shit right now. Finland daily cases spring still much less Europe World still restrictions, lockdowns face masks. stay home sick, asians go work matter what. Yeah, outlook grim. Emergency Medicine gone past point return terms corporate Medicine Pfizer scummy company comitted crimes humanity. Everybody refuse take vaccine. Companies like stop getting much money. stay late feel like enough control life eat bats yet? help may early though. need cell test point. You’re really looking situation deaths at-risk people drop return normalcy rather every single person vaccine Hey guess what, spreading bs like gets people believe rolls downhill 7 billion people. Even 0.2% spread values done incredible damage. 

So, mad, here's do. Stop fatalistic, stop spreading false facts take care dumbass. go house Thanksgiving give great big group hug. someone used live Wyoming, let assure everyone lives (at least everyone met) hardcore Die hard Republican loyalist.

His name Dad I'm freaked fuck right now. 

He'll probably survive. Although he's 70, he's robust skinny. wife? Mother law? aunt who's also 70? 

Not much. 

Fuck. republican controlled government Florida and/or Republican controlled federal government.

...and Disney practically owns runs county/city Disneyland in.

Considering Trump lost presidency failed response COVID, someone really could argue Trump presidency GOP got together make COVID. Johns Hopkins reporting 1707 deaths US today. number still rising day due increasing daily cases past 2 weeks. easily hit 2000 day number new cases holds steady 150,000. Thanksgiving next week, going cause serious uptick new cases. Hospitals buckling pressure death rates rise inability treat everyone properly.

The IHME model says 1214 deaths today. seriously estimating things.  Yes fully realize study wearer, isn’t biggest point. also first RCS seen mask use general public Covid. quite interesting is. certainly isn’t reason wearing mask. think assuming making sort anti-mask point study. not. However, find interesting. 

That first link put cover mask mandates effect spread general public. shows reduce spread two percent. one percent estimate 1 percent. Ordered mine well. get five at-home tests per family case anyone else interested It’s abnormal

It abnormal vaccine, that's doctor's offices UK need order new refrigerated storage current fridges (used store vaccines) work. moderna one kept standard fridge vaccine appears easier store remains stable minus 20C six months kept standard fridge vaccine needs ultra-cold storage around minus 75C, kept fridge five days. hope you’re right ... wedding scheduled June 2021 rescheduled. I’m scared something happen loved ones then! nahhh news states closing lunch due already tests. That's works democracies. can't take rights people. CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Ohio’s daily coronavirus data report still delayed, “many thousands reports” still pending confirmation epidemiologists local health department officials, Ohio Department Health spokeswoman wrote email.

“As right now, 6,385 positive cases,” email reads. “Local health department officials work together verify pending reports. unprecedented case volume, combined unexpected system errors today, reduced staffing already over-burdened local health departments due illness, including COVID-19, led delay today.” I’m danger. Except Sweden world Covid shit right now. Downvoted idiocy. friend's wife tested positive isolated kids, separately housed time. Doctor said get kids tested basically regardless. Nah, promised would never come back actually. hoping keeps promise! Third highest deaths per 100k so, freaking world. North Dakota number 1. saw tweet, think, nurse said even though ppl dying say hoax! mean respirator still Hoax? go hospital take someones bed believe real &amp; probably reckless wearing mask. Surprise surprise. Spot on. That’s biggest fear Probably miniscule cost compared toll Covid-19 taking economy Yeah, like police officers come contact high risk groups people daily basis anything. /s mortality rate goes way beds hospitals sick people. data there. What's worry about? That’s trying say. Deficiencies typically due ignorance developed world. speaking inherent nutritiousness particular diet rather baseline dietary knowledge abysmal many populations. nutritional deficiencies I’m talking least US typically product following standard American diet, lacking certain nutrient elements, misinformed approach nutrition works. going vegan vegetarian also result nutrient deficiencies, developing better knowledge awareness nutrition often part lifestyle change. argument nutrition education needs improved overall. sentiment vegetarians/vegans malnourished malnourished omnivores factually incorrect something perhaps indirectly buying you’re saying causing deficiencies get even worse.

Government announcements:

**THANKSGIVING GATHERINGS BAD, FAMILY BAD**

**BLACK FRIDAY SALES IN-PERSON LEGAL &amp; GOOD. GET &amp; CONSUME &amp; DIE NEED TAX $$$** non-clinical Mayo employee, thought I'd share observations: 

* Mayo require patients, staff, visitors wear face masks.
* HOWEVER, Cafeteria break-room spread 100% possibility. sometimes heat lunch certain break-room...There's group maintenance workers absolutely follow guidelines, sit table hour without masks on, even they've finished eating. told compliance office done anything, so... 

* Another thing Rochester we're weird mix ""urban"" rural. decent number people work Mayo educated follow guidelines, wear masks, etc., LOT stereotypically rural, far-right, covid-denying folks outlying communities. come town, shop stores, eat restaurants, etc. noted employees I've dealing with, good number also work Mayo (god knows how). 
* Mayo employee, I'm frustrated this. constantly remind employees work area wear mask, many researchers medical-staff. know better. We've put dozen sign reminding them. still don't. 
* said, think Mayo's leadership trying best keep everything falling apart. 60,000+ employees. Top leadership put plans place good. Unfortunately, lower leadership employees following like should. lucky supervisors/direct leadership take seriously trying keep people masked. WH admin responded ""lol right?"" known virus since January done literally nothing I’m mobile, can’t find right now, read something day saying first dose actually provide significant benefit. 

I’m excited start seeing increase cases start flatten trend downward. customary regular circumstances, would need get pretty higher approval mftr facility start ""at risk"" work orders.

I suspect high confidence vaccines would 50%+ effective, earlier trials, went ahead it, believing risk producing enough doses outweighed risk effective thought. argued jackoff yesterday said shopping wasn’t safe using delivery curbside, get sick shopping it’s fault you’re moron. Like, homie, think groceries get door hell, store general? people really blind privileged are. sponsored Raising Canes?? we’ve rounded corner this....too bad failed mention corner left hand turn takes us next level hell Right, there’s still many think washing hands going stop getting spreading *airborne* virus. Even end ""soon"" (depending define ""soon""), time table better world living before, people know would last 3 weeks, 3 months, 3 years.

Being able idea wonders mental health people struggling way right now. retail capacity everywhere, doubt see surge hiring. don’t think anyone actually does; rather, universities wanted ensure could charge full tuition costs. Lots schools started person transitioned remote learning deadline refunds passed. It’s money, people expendable.

Besides, dead person can’t ask refund, family can’t sue surely signed waiver accepting risks... availability rooms? Think hospitals freeways, peoples cars covid rush hour. planning going help excess people “road” language written HHS CDC strong armed publishing Oh really dont say Contract tracing pretty much useless point game. Dr. Osterholm said weeks ago, going test way stage pandemic, least states. thing absence coherent federal response distance wear masks wait vaccine. fact selfish cunt- demanding others things imposing want onto them. free society. freedom stay home safe, go take risk. behavior effect except choose leave house chose go restaurant. social distancing masks mind you, I’m also businesses customers deciding factor that’s implemented. Breaking News!

The Entire World says, ""No Shit, Sherlock!"" big deal all. nothing like drama queens described  busy inadequate maybe it’s realization people really used easy consumers. faced community problem, people ignore it, continue engage behavior that’s risky making making pandemic worse.

I’ve seen people constantly post friend get togethers parties like thing, nothings going on. That’s pretty weak willed ignorant IMO. 

We’re negatively affected way. It’s annoying seeing people constantly giving shit. democracynow.org may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* fears misplaced. vaccine I’m aware severe long term effects made last decades swine flu vaccine caused narcolepsy people. European version association, American one fine, people got already genetically predisposed narcolepsy.

And 1300 people 30 million got it. .004% people received vaccine.

Dr Fauci explicitly said compromising safety. Oxford vaccine lead researcher’s three adult children took part trial. vaccines tested safety. Lol downvotes kind comments make laugh. ""DONT TELL CAN'T PESIMISTIC!!"" changed ""Friends Giving COVID."" Yikes! mean exactly slobbering personal belongings sick either. got sick, power went couple days hotel, 90% better time left said hotel (being careful disinfecting, hand washing, etc) came home. idk need disinfect EVERY SINGLE DVD EVERY SINGLE BOOK EVERY SINGLE THINGS SHELF even touch actually sick. got big stuff I'm scared order enjoy literally anything room, needs disinfected regardless actually touching/using running fever, aching, etc. 

All uncertainty trying disinfect every last thing given room monumental task idk im agonizing nothing. want cautious never let happen again.....but willingness mind numbing labor limits...thats LOT dvds art books lemme tell ya Kill thy neighbor. Vacate buildings pump em full ozone 24 hrs. Let staff back get negative covid results. 3-4 day shut almost completely sanitized. 

There. Problem solved.  Bars, restaurants gyms open NYC?! bring “neighbor” Don? J. Thump? wants stop McDonalds way please don’t take personally. It’s leak, trickle. broken long. reason review safety checks belt seats airbags I'm smart. I've around long enough see shit develop healthy sense skepticism motives inevitable actions humans. road hell absolutely made exactly say is. That's wives' tale.  like doomer mindset either whole reason pandemic repeatedly spiraled control Western Hemisphere people keep downplaying disease listen warnings guidelines. still worry months would best covid spreading like wildfire. may add rant, hate seem understand everyone can't hide homes even wanted to. talk people ate goes gym sit order UberEats, Instacart, shit Amazon poors come bring them. 

They think lockdown... ain't it. class divide becoming even ocean. privileged get stay home working class expose every day. know family extremely careful throughout pandemic. youngest daughter caught virus school. mom got it. Guess what? grandmother vent it’s looking good. Every governor needs this. misinformation. 

Both China &amp; New Zealand multiple documented cases transmission via surfaces. countries gone 0 cases infected surface transmission. Shaped like gun? I'll trade Universal healthcare elimination tax stamp requirement, application process waiting period suppressors. back normal March? Trump certainly hits quite marks Anti-Christ supposed fulfill. prominent members Church conglomerate enabled outright endorsed many modern times. right. That's good point. Ugh sucks. admit, I'm rapidly approaching ""fuck it"" mode too. Sure, we're waiting 3 years deploy vaccine. released there's really reason keep control group.  absolutely agree people change get new evidence. assertion first positions wrong know it. already knew masks useful, rest world already said plenty infections asymptotic, children carriers common freakin since go based flu. CDC waiting confirm things evidence, worst disease center world.

Edit: sorry, got triggered them, you. Underrated comment. Look, banged pots pans called heroes like... half week back March. even put billboards hours cut. want? THAT's Canada overbought vaccines. adding bought 2x 3x amount citizens country. tip iceberg.

Everytime report positive cases area gets bombarded ""Stop testing!"" ""Its control!"" ""The death rate 1%, stop living fear!"" know bathrooms work cleanest I've ever seen absolute joy. may single best unintended circumstance entire debacle. can't now, need shit fall apart blame next admin. lives literally pawns game. join COVIDgiving get together super spread event. ""immunity last 3 months"" ""this much worse spanish flu""?

I wonder would next apocalyptic ""fact"" things (finally!) start look better. use steel company want one that's nearby reasonable prices US Steel. 60% market share totally cool still. 8% clusters analyzed study came gyms. Far “the biggest spreader” Oklahoma, OK. Reddit people attack like moderators nothing. place. I'm going see family next Thursday; outdoors, 6-10 feet away, masks on. going eat together, going exchange homemade food we'll eat separately, sort like distanced pot luck. 

You safely see friends family. indoors immediate family live with. 

So many people stuck black white thinking ""either 30 people indoors huge meal lock basement see one ever."" get together outside masks keep reasonable distance yourself. country huge- many places gather outdoors. Even biggest cities giant parks. could US possibly “quarantined travelers 2 weeks supervised housing?” mean travelers country, travelers states, travelers cities? 300+ million residents, would work? mean, you’re basically proving point geographic isolation manageable population. 

Which state lowest case rate US? Oh yeah one that’s damn ISLAND. Coincidence according some, suppose. Fucking hell dumb argument, I’m really trying asshole think I’m done.  Actively subverting plans plan. dead minks? states relatively small isolated Jesus! Rapture can't come soon enough. many people excited right now. good news vaccine, vaccine rolled year. manufacturing distribution going easy fast. doubt average joe even get inline get vaccine mid summer  However, people spreading ones get vaccinated first. seniors immune compromised isolating home. It’s better control spread vaccinating ones social isolating. Probably written much, think guy read past 1st grade level Latent Covid worse reinfection. latter least controlled booster vaccines.

I continually amazed blasé people catching rona. don’t die ruin life. People likened long-COVID ME/CFS.

Over last two decades I've learned sufferers ME/CFS struggled proving diagnoses. I've also learned many experienced GPs always agree patient's self diagnosis.

I'm judging here, based heard read popular press. beginning pandemic, draft memo leaked US military going recruit anyone past COVID-19 diagnosis. second memo later reduced anyone hospitalized COVID-19. That's pretty significant since US military already struggles meet recruiting goals. woke coma, baby bump gone. describes thinking lost them. think children coma bit surprise, especially early. 24-25 weeks. Yeah, totally understand you’re saying. I’m introvert doesn’t mean enjoy hermit. miss seeing people. mean policy stealing PPE states, left governors like MD's Hogan assign State Police armed escorts shipments, hide deliveries?

Or policy Jared Kusner trying order supplies buddies online using personal email accounts?

Or policy playing ""backup"", needed super bowl level QB manage states needed, states waste resources themselves?

Keep living fantasy world. money-hungry institutions? know, based profit. Thanks answering question, makes sense! Trumpskin sheeple Damn. smart fucker. 

Word. We'll get tomorrow, next seven days well enough average it. [How Bernie still \*Muscles usually Displacement ventilation solution (though fails heating mode) True, lot time effort im scared got wasted lol imagine numbers would counted comorbidity way America did....it would probably double. State public health departments plans rollout, least state does. Healthcare workers first, old/first responders. friend public health department, said expecting enough health care workers Feb/March  hard see Murdoch press factor

It hard see. Murdoch controls 90% press, one five commercial TV stations, cable news.

I live here. saw press state premier. murdoch fkn cancer. know guard needs come eventually right? Also news flash, sub flooded people saying using masks they’re sick, cautious spreading sickness future, etc.

We two vaccines ton pipeline, healthcare professionals learning treat you’re US come January dedicated coronavirus task force isn’t play theatrics

This 100% going come end. response please one? Enjoy it. It’s full racist Fckrs like 
The Chinese opportunity leave leaving That’s exactly I’m at. I’m Canada it’s crazy point, 2000 dollar fine (CAD lol like 6 bucks American) wearing mask- people still wearing fucking mask! really hope it’s almost scraps faith humanity thoroughly trampled pandemic election. wild think used see folks masks think: there's something wrong 

Yes, complete 180 that.

Though prefer reusable mask approach Asia's use disposable masks. would never stay mask wearer reusable cloth masks. agree, that's still lowering bar, it? Ideally, leaders pull nonsense would lose jobs. Tough spot USA east coast well. think pretty much rest country not. Chickens lay, paper doesn't. It’d nice people could follow advisory Crazy times. Govt telling us can’t homes   IM We're sure lifelong complications 9 months?

We almost data long-term side effects disease, we're spending nothing find out. truly horrifying, least 2 weeks increases baked due fact cases still rising almost certainly much longer unless somehow number daily cases starts dropping within next week. like April lots areas able send healthcare resources staff worst affected places, either - *everywhere* badly hit right there's nowhere draw aid worst places. living hell say want continue?? course not.

Im saying people overly confident. Many people seem like let guard i.e. wear masks start gatherings “because there’s vaccine coming soon!” apart Kristi Noem's plan run president People saying March... seems like lot work avoid amounts minor inconvenience. joking, right? got love risk. 

So far, starting, 1 1000 residents State North Dakota dead courtesy flu. story today WAPO tracers ND quit trying chase links. say many.  1 1000 dead means 30 1000 experience post flu. what's termed long haulers. Normally, would medical treatment them. Now, demands newly infected, let's say 1/2 own. So, let's click half newly soon dead. 

The question ramp enjoyment life, intermingling. want get want. collection plate live near Box Hill Melbourne large asian population. masks February. understand point want make. 5-10% IFR variolation lower rate would occurred uncontrolled epidemic. best tool disposal.  take. Something seriously wrong. Either covid caused damage 70% young patients, something else environment did.

Thank sharing. Preach! even need look stats o*bviously* first two leading causes flu, flu. /s said Harris County representative state. I'm sure point. explaining neither racist sexist nowhere Texas likes elect people white men? right. us staying locked much else do. shit show. Eh, like 20-30% Democrats concentrated mostly Cheyenne. decent art scene city size.  looking infection stats Texas county, several western texas saw around 100 cases per 1000 residents. Like holy fuck Yea, part problem feels like there's accountability USA anymore. Newsom merely apologized, keep job. there's others even apologize (they never do), dig heels question reality itself

Heck, Kelly Loeffler insider trading pandemic news, still got good shot re-elected US Senate. Talk non-existent consequences God works mysterious ways. sometimes, whatever reason, decides kill you.  Bring zombies ! short: aussies common sense. Hopefully it'll mandatory choice based. want go work, school, kindergarten? - Mandatory vaccination. Yeah, fuck cancer. It’s getting bad CDC going list number people haven’t COVID-19 instead number does. seems though exposed coming weeks. breaks heart resident doctors forced front lines ended dying. can't quit get license. I'm talking specialties far removed type work like pathology, psychiatry, dermatology, etc end thrown covid floor critic care. This. 1000% times this.

Those videos Northern Italy spring moved people. number gets called, time go Home.

But fools sure enough rush ER difficulty breathing. think time go Home then. beg lives. r/collapse knock knock knock, it’s consequences capitalist monopoly  Flatten curve, vertically.  gotta hang little longer real, whenever form good news, person comments like, “uM ACTUALLY” ""Especially virus 99.8 percent survival rate."" 

Oh look misinformation. guess also checked CDC planning scenario decided projections used real figures. 

Virus 3.45% mortality rate US slightly worse 3.33% mortality globally. ignoring long term side effects popping up. Thongs pears. Paywall Soon “Raise hand DON’T Covid.”

Later comes Plague Inc notification “There healthy people left world” virus dumps DNA points becoming deadlier. Ok bye sub interesting time capsule! worry, one going force wear little mask pandemic well truly over. Many people choose though. think problem word ""just."" bullshit. population density cities high fuck 90% population lives 5-10% land. Island, fair (though US two land borders, exactly Germany France situation) I'm gonna pedantic, summer another week half regardless went worst outbreaks lockdowns middle winter. toxic fkwit encouraging everyone stupidly expose us deadly virus consequences. knew?  Man wish still worked Reg Affairs Pfizer, wanna read full studies feel joy. No? would call then? School youth sports big lying tracers MA. Got skating rinks shut next year it. today 7-day moving average daily deaths 1,265, FWIW. 

But rate wouldn’t surprised start averaging 2,000 daily deaths couple weeks Jan 1st though :( hospitals overrun, 1-2% die. reason cfr low places kept standard care learned lot treat severe cases. None matters don’t bed staff. living hell say want continue?? course not.

Im saying people overly confident. Many people seem like let guard i.e. wear masks start gatherings “because there’s vaccine coming soon!” Exactly. making money every single one bodies. bet made killing (sorry). I'm sure could've rented refrigerated trucks semi trailers I'm locked store deniers thoughtless nose-exposers hour recirculating air?

Shipt (via Meijer) drops porch, let air minute, bring groceries straight ol' covie corral days. (Wash cold things get). Next thing know, CDC telling us thing exponential growth! /s Hypocrisy exclusive particular political group. Whoa idea! Moving goalposts again. like lazy holocaust. virus trump's fault incompetent response easily doubled death toll. People downvoting consider Thalidomide created 1952 put market less five years banned 1961. Less decade creation. 

The long term effects drug vaccine known least 5 - 10 years introduction populace. sure associate like-minded individuals next several weeks risk infection sort logic compassion. 

You definitely want stay away hospitals clinics especially; they're absolute hives advocacy public health right now. manager's manager basically said ""If stay home, ask questions."" That's great stay safe, we're team 15 company nearly 400. rest someone bypassing company policy even though every single employee could work home forced risk themselves. brain ground gear Ebola extremely contagious, kills hosts fast enough it’s hard spread . 

Obviously COVID far bigger problem Ebola .

But I’ve trying explain , it’s end world . Q2 2021 mean hate guns, acceptable celebrated hobby. Nah, worldometers topped 1956.

My friend guessing we'd top 2000 tonight, texted let know nah, [we're need hold people like accountable deaths damage economy wreaked. Melbourne 5m people. 1% always going crazy hate whatever gov says, leaving 99% soon they're told. That's 50,000 people.

It's hard see Murdoch press factor drove general lunacy large groups people.  Fuck Greg abbot really want continue forever huh? What’s wrong people like you? Watch many fictional movies/anime? time abandon contact tracing use funding allocated resources treat patients, protect people. Stop voting republicans office  Completely true. Australia asians arrive gold rush 1800's part culture ever since. see I've hit salt vein today I'm happy keep mining it.

It's much honest work home obviously. Michigan's ICU beds 81% occupied. know long expect last, expect last two weeks nothing done. 

The issue person gets sick today ends ICU ends two weeks today. people going ICU today got sick two weeks ago.

My point can't wait ICU beds 100% occupied, take action earlier. oof Saw Metro '03. Killer show. 
Here's study century's end, emissions continue current pace, humans warmed ocean 20 percent much extinction event, researchers say. 2300, figure could high 50 ""The ultimate, driving change led mass extinction driving change humans today, injecting greenhouse gases atmosphere,"" said Justin Penn, UW doctoral student oceanography study's lead author.

If drinkable water becomes scarce, war inevitable. Many hardest hit countries nukes, think country full dead people walking rational resort nukes desperate bit naive.

IMHO hope cut emissions build megastructure space shields us sun cold years rebuild ice age cool down. 

The sooner engineer big solutions like this, less need control emissions, ten years act we've gone past point return.

Essentially need terraform planet make habitat future generations. asking go gym? exercise home?  Major outbreak across US states, major cities starting lower side exponential curve. US vital major cities react fast could seeing feared back March soon -a major shutdown public health system. Europe's partial lockdowns working, take notes. town (Grand Forks, ND), come contact 25 people day, 100% chance exposed. yeah, pretending everybody good bet.   

# Well? We're Waiting 2 percentage increase NY start shut well, schools shutting NYC tomorrow isn’t sarcastic “western” countries mean predominantly white countries? i’m USA consider us western bc western hemisphere Australia isn’t. “western” another term developed country? make $1 invalidate claims. That's trouble making bold absolute claims - trivially proven wrong.

But means, short sell Tesla. it. Symptom - disease  Piss poor leadership provincial government. ego Manitobans. 

Doesnt implement ""restrictions"" late. Doesnt enforce them. Blames Manitobans Covid. like 1% incompetence province exhibiting given week. point obviously people fear .

Ebola 50% mortality rate 

COVID 19 0.6- 1.0 mortality rate .

You see difference right ? Ohio released partial numbers today system bit meltdown. sure death hospitalization counts final, “several thousand” additional cases still verified added final count. football games US? case know this, strongly hinted book men issue producing offspring, women. well past mask mandate anything Florida politicized I'm sure DeSantis wants re-elected. supporters *would not* happy one may even fo less mandated enforced.

He can't close businesses money UI decimatestax dollars coming in. income tax Florida.

Their *needs needs needs* another, better planned, stimulus states shutdown without excessive suffering. I’ve parts Kentucky absolutely like third world countries. There’s way places would followed cared federal guidance turn federal welfare money  easily makes think dystopia, know? Pining everything wrong Trump weirdest cope there. Things fine Pretty Accurate Actually, people call “millennials”. ok, current president reality TV host tag line “you’re fired” political experience well Yeah think island MAY something it

But think Australia New Zealand would successful large border somewhere like say, US, go ahead keep deluding Dfw within like three weeks el paso, Abbott keep letting people die get Trump votes 2022. happens now? mean, federal gov gonna anything. State governments really control. 


...So really going wait 60 days Biden takes over....or emergency session house Representatives impeach trump pence failing provide adequate federal leadership? Fuck sounds like decent option, might contact representatives. POS mother? She’s old AF, overweight, Vit-D deficient - reported prerequisites death COVID. state in? Zombie republican denialists, yes  Well he's got point though. appreciable portion society wants believe likes made virus lot worse US. Also way humans live right increases likeliness pandemic. I'd say give try. judge it, without tried it. Megaforce Power Rangers say: ""Rangers together! Never surrender!"" GON ALTA YA DNA MAKE YA MOAR LIIBBBRRRRUUULLLL know UK French nukes, too, right? Also Cold War past us. Russians onto conquering, well long former USSR territory, mostly rely spreading disinformation here. like USA. Unfortunately that’s herd immunity works thing.

People capable getting twice. Could surge US cause collapse health system worried back March? least local level worst case scenario, seems like US could several Bergamos time, believe model uses data site tracks confirmed cases testing estimate true number new infections current cases.

So, rehosting data computing ""nowcast"" based it.

However, longer forecast like site used temporarily frozen. There's twist.

""I want"" mentality taken genuinely insane levels. large population ultra conservative “anti maskers” hear. family there, went thinking joke “oh crap” fast. Lol moron Oh, think liver ever getting back pre-covid normalcy. know they're doing. need stop it. many people already wear them. Stop contradicting CDC. reason they're fucking saying saying way going hope controlling virus everyone wears masks follows safe guidelines. Telling selfish fucks wearing mask anything personally makes think point wearing give 2 shits anyone this. evidenced fact still refuse wear mask even proven helps contain virus sick keeps others getting sick. fucking studies goddamn pandemic control least say instead perpetuating mentality seems becoming prevalent; ""since nothing help point wearing it."" Stop giving dumbass, selfish people reasons Dumbass selfish people. around 1200-1500 people dying daily America shit idiots keep pretending like big deal. ""Well big deal me. got 3 days."" Well that's nice, Ashlee
Asshole. 60% local nursing home population died though. That's someone's fucking family. yours, though, big deal. Right? I'm sick bullshit. literally jeering authoritarian government. Wow. Wowww.

Houston's population density 3,842 per square mile. NYC's 28,211. That's...huge. That’s people who’ve tested good thing put /s idiots cheer not.   shit come with. Yeah guy clearly hasn’t central California, gets red parts. They’re every bit redneck would see Tennessee. CDC:

I'm happy take tomorrow FWIW fair degree trust cost/benefit risk ration etc makes decision obvious. actually tried participate Moderna trial summer get picked, please misunderstand position.

But fairness know many intelligent, educated people reticent take likely candidates MRNA vax technology less tried/tested vaccine makers face little liability. IOW largely new tech came market record time there's already rich people stand make tremendous money without great risk legal consequence cause harm. 

So think stuff like ""people anti-science"" conspiracy theories fear unknown pretty anemic social explainers here. Or, minimum, fail capture full picture range reasons skepticism is, end, friend. Agree!  Indoctrination. Good see take joke ) Somewhat reminiscent Jonestown. Apparently i’m killer now? Lmaoo make good points, sides wear masks.

Let go visit nearby hospitals overwhelmed Covid patients.

See healthcare workers putting 12-24 hour shifts nearly every day pity you. Lol  OP challenging everyone race first one say that. pulling numbers thin air yet people upvote you. get ""more 80%"" attendees getting infected 4 hours household secondary attack rate (so, people live together full-time) &lt;20% according multiple studies? Phew, glad Pfizer almost save us ourselves.. brag silver Reddit lol. offensive enough mod remove comment. Pretty much this. People done worrying virus LA, many even confirmed positive (speaking observed behavior acquaintances).

It going get really bad people start give fuck again. normal 5 months now, death rate low took care worst risked people. possible everyone, there's still essential work happening requires travel. people US talking Christmas July. idea. could see it’s like Christmas summer like Australia. People thinking they're smarter world's best epidemiologists reason thing bad. They're going come tell they're Fascist.  They're going Fascist things. read today... horrific! understanding need special permission test certain groups like teens, younger kids, people health issues &amp; elderly. remember reading one phase 3 vaccines asking permission expand trial include teens &amp; elderly, can't rememb one. Good hear, I'm envious I've back England shit. Wish back home. right, sure, prefer kill frail people can't defend themselves.

In country get manslaughter that. Nah I’m finna bust nut instead sad true. Germany people really counted national corona app. 70 % think said polls use it. app 22 million downloads months release. app almost useless piece software. thats download possible outside tracking app. Still people dont even care download it. seems actually understand timeline. many people going disappointed basic predicament March starting truly dig way out.  blame them? wouldn’t ask someone unwilling. Shit wild ride.  Especially know end near news vaccine available soon. Honestly one thanksgiving people need sacrifice seems that's still much want encourage (with good reason), need mandate refunds travel plans. know airlines going voluntarily refund people's tickets bought early thinking would now. know. see literally day everyday.

I'm librarian. two options, curbside come inside. Coming inside almost exclusively domain elderly patrons, many proceed complain rant us bad service hate making appointments time limited. fucking exhausting ridiculous.  Facepalm. example. Fine. holidays year resume regular schedule next year. virtual Thanksgiving.

The stupid messaging nonsense coming ""ima want, rona gonna rona do"" crowd.   good. find someone life pester wearing mask fervor use troll lockdowns internet True. Sometimes decides kidnap brown children lock cages. Republicans love it.  That's good noticed cut back beforehand got hand. mean.. someone brings home going share it. yeah windows open day (not 20-30 minutes) might reduce risk bit. say anywhere cretins, say vast majority people Germany dont believe nonsense, response OPs comments ""Europe"". There's difference. This. I’d give gold and/or trophies wasn’t one working poor struggling hard enough eat day, making things SUPER luxury. hard seek objective truth when, due respect, basing decisions people. know what's there. know could happen. know happen lower guard.

Weird. postulate term 'dead-adjacent'  Nah we’re white healthy we’ll fine :) appreciate concern though  See, God commanded ""thou shalt covet thy neighbor's wife,"" know Tammy lives next door us would smoking hot!

/s point lost comment... imagine many said exact thing head reading headline. saying sometimes even high risk might bit reckless. ""Willingness""

If work, get paid, Simple 

Not everyone cushy 6 figure office job seamlessly transfered working home. NH also one effective tomorrow else ! education funded US taxpayers thank much. Deaths issue. Ofcourse deaths tragic really important issue making sure hospitals get overwhelmed covid. Hospitalisations already time high covid even though deaths still lower spring. Nut fully lockdown areas affected? groceries go get coffee somewhere anything i'm drinking still wipe lid to-go cup drinking it

might anything got used spring, takes like 5 seconds, probably helps prevent GI bugs anyway next week add Thanksgiving gathering list contributed spread people want perpetual doom mode reason Idaho chance. sounds lot like Idaho. 

“We’re going back stage rebound plan” loosely translates to—keep everything February. ""The first shipments expected arrive mid-December, followed another January, newspaper said. vaccines stored they’re approved use."" Never mind facts. **believe**! /s risk reward?
The risk getting sick; Sick enough hospitalized months die.

The reward around people eating.

The risk might never see many peoole died.

The reward seeing survivors next Thanksgiving. Fuck off. killing people stupid mother fucker There’s several articles search mean administration didn’t touch pandemic preparedness plan found stockpiles N95 masks moldy? Nah, respitory diseases like 80%+ via air, norovirus etc transmits surfaces.

And surface transmission mostly limited toddlers kids anyways. legally allowed that. absolutely clue talking about.  Lol make tik tok dances Yeah people acting like it’s next thing figure gonna get approval. 

They’ve known restraints working 9 months. Slow motion train wreck way stop it. folks convinced world-view correct stupidity supported many Republicans office. convinced facts. Sounds like tyranny /s We're sick covid can't report much covid have. do.. won’t able figure connect audio snowbird relatives left early Florida didn’t want locked anymore. I’m seeing viewpoint obviously:) That's bullshit justification. Ask keep eyes open drive even wear seatbelt. fatalistic bluster used lazy afraid change justify following routine. is, million huge personal donation. also probably 0.1 % cost vaccine development. old people dead? Add TN that. dumb shit Governor (an HVAC Company CEO ABSOLUTELY political experience before) leaves ‘personal responsibility’ Tennesseans instead manning making actual decision doesn’t involve making Bible official state book. Gotta make base, who’s also suffering worst pandemic, happy. Accepting screwed apologizing start, ""woops"" accidentally happened situation. knew better anyway; like planning rendezvous cheat wife. by, ""it happened"".

Makes appreciate example Fauci sets even more.  let in, next they're going turning ventilators pulling tubes test whether staged not. Yeah, that’s probably bad idea. Washington, live. 

Not trying dick, bad situation around. work retail I've shopping, running errands, going thrifting completely normal mask live high density area social distancing stores problem. day walked around downtown. 

Try again, edgelord  remember thst kids. Kids going rather something fun alternative. school dont. home play fortnite instead parents live rural North Dakota. Three weeks ago dad drove elderly neighbor hospital. 45 minutes away, masks, two sitting next car. older gentleman course tests positive. 

I spend week telling get tested. finally call county health department look testing, they're told specifically test worry quarantining unless develope symptoms they've getting many false positives. 

Luckily, somehow, neither parents developed symptoms. though they're even incredulous worry anything develope symptoms. Occasionally hear people make claim shut-down quarantine related COVID-19 affecting mental health negatively. claim suicides, domestic violence, etc cause pain death would caused opening letting virus run rampant. credible studies analyses examining claims?   Actually, they're testing lot. They're testing almost state.

The problem let virus get bad, really matter much test anymore — tests coming anywhere 25 50% positive (as say) per day. shitbag really bad here.

Congrats little one! donate blood specific blood banks test antibodies free! PLUS, you’ve saved multiple lives donation! Win win *Give wealthy, rich*

The virus care think think. sense, I'm virus' side. Exactly like that, know????

There's actually restaurant, Dick's Last Resort, ""bad service"" gimmick youd absolutely hear phrases like wait staff. funny read bad reviews people go place knowing gimmick, still get offended. agree vaccines way go, solution, they're part solution. good people stop getting understand work. Elderly key word. good ol USA we’re willing sacrifice expired goods keep economy going. Literally every state asking question. Unless Congress gets shit together fast lockdowns aren’t coming anytime soon reminds line old classic Hellraiser. 

“I don’t believe hell!” 

“But hell believes you.” hate people like understanding weather timelines contribute us well like cheated.

Cases started going WINTER lockdown mask wearing. easier control ""in peak summer"" FUCKING WINTER absolute dumbass. 

And even spring started, 10C, rainy windy. warm week ago. didn’t. 

I’m graduate school atmospheric science certainly made decision based education quality. read information previously enjoyed reminder history myself, thank getting look something up. nice distraction doomscrolling. Texan, I’ve always loathed Gov Abbott, mishandling pandemic taken loathing new heights Probably exclusively absoulety major help Idk conspiracy it’s owned Bezos Covid likely remain issue less-developed countries while. job. free U.S though International travel, think, back precovid normal late 2021 2022. think succeed vaccinating world return normal international travel, probably take better part next year achieve that. 

I don’t think strictly restricted 2021 - maybe gradual loosening precautionary guidelines, world’s population vaccinated.   K-12 operates criteria.. announced closing sections private public starting Monday. 

Daycares different since umbrella OCFS... follow guidelines. essentially babysitting program aren’t consider education based. 

All people moving city suburbs causing housing prices skyrocket.. lot school districts actually waitlists since aren’t really private schools East (plus pay taxes schools) told people back March rural America fucked got hit this. lack caution infrastructure develops due urban density. mean ""no three households"" pretty worthless bar first place. dined California pandemic seen things going on; Three sided walled structures apparently count ""outdoors"", large gatherings multiple households, masks tables eating.

Did violate spirit covid prevention he's preaching? Absolutely, criticism deserved. indulging secretive illegal gathering government forbidding general public partaking themselves? way, shit interpreted ""in compliance"" months now, gone eat seen table two that's clearly 3 households, like waiters going start checking addresses IDs.  skipping one, mean one Thanksgiving. People need reality check.  Oh right. left wing conspiracy. terrible source information.

no link

no specific information.

and lazy give shit part misinformation problem. We'd fraud locked people homes arrested people public gatherings. virus escaped china always going run course. places hope isolated island nations. Finally, good ducking news I'd interested following lasting implications Covid-19 studies become peer-reviewed impact world. exponential November space x-values 10 days.  Interesting say this, Toronto’s hotspots aren’t downtown area all. They’re North Etobicoke (Rexdale) eastern Scarborough (Scarborough Village). 

A place like Kensington Market, liberal place Toronto, 72 cases per 100K. Rexdale 525 per 100K, Scarborough Village 741 per 100K, Maple Leaf (north west) takes cake 1088 per 100K.

Some liberal west end neighbourhoods mentioned? Palmerston-Little Italy (22 per 100K), Annex (56 per 100K), Trinity-Bellwood’s (36 per 100K). Greenwood-Coxwell 139 cases per 100K. say live Upper Beaches neighbourhoods haven’t issues? Taylor-Massy area 293 per 100K, Birchcliffe-Cliffside 256 per 100K.

Don’t judge something without facts.

(All per capita rates confirmed cases last 21 days) it.

I care.

I New Orleans century. “Life battle royale” know, maybe it’s better way. ImIf sharing house partner makes bad person hope fucking Christ god (or whoever) comes
Down puts ass hospital vent slowly drown liquified lung. Australia's ""white""-ness overstated imo. politicians predominantly white, almost quarter urban Australians Asians. demographic huge influence Australian economy international relations. easy American redditors tell Australia ditch Asia join ""western"" world, that's population wants. resign.  Talk cheap. Apologies mean nothing politicians.  rich anyway.  Maybe could donate salary charity helping homeless small businesses.  already know safe. Phase II trials check safety. healthy adults allowed make informed decision whether take vaccine.

Apparently enough emergency take away constitional rights assembly (which agree with) enough emergency government let people decide bodies. absurd. They're killing people overly cautious. Well conclude costs almost nothing it’s potentially helpful. Upside huge, downside zero r/titlegore idk felt fitting 2020 **Yee Haw**, better strap in; going wild ride. Yo guy tracking Google search trends. said texas pop need car either, yet still see people driving alone wearing mask. Never mind, checked stats Indian/Bangladeshi migrant workers Singapore died heart attacks Covid infections lah. Statistics don’t lie. Unless abortion. right LIVE.

The hypocrisy astounding scientific evidence Biden vote, Trump lost, cdc underlings ignore director lame duck too. We'd average 3k day happen. We'll probably hit 400k, new year's. What's nl? Charge nurse/shift manager here. gave notifying nurses got exposed. It’s impossible. would patients floor week test prior placing rehabilitation clinics surgeries would show positive. It’s gotten bad nurses WANT COVID patients least KNOW patient take proper precautions November.

It's reported since January virus spread people asymptomatic. Since there's way knowing people infected they're public, masks needed everyone.  Ad Arizona list. Plus children must go school. shut man? I’m still wondering even human contact tracers countries using mobile apps :| vaguely recall, hold this, something Executive Order preventing local officials trying local lockdowns. time research tonight, maybe someone else dig around it. Elderly healthcare workers. rename Sturgis Surges huge super spreader idiot biker chud rally mAh fReEdoM ~99.6% survivability SARS-1 known spread way crowded HK apartment buildings (through plumbing, like suggested) knew customers would okay it/would help connect them. 

""What's motherfuckers, place fucking order right fucking now"" Florida lock worse summer, see would now. recall correctly, opened Disney World peak back July. Good times one CDC references studies infections deaths falling post lockdown.

Have read studies linked? one Germany CDC believe reduction growth rates infections 40% 60% best 
estimate effects face masks. convincing argument stresses Jena introduced face masks region so. announced face masks first region Germany post-treatment period public health measures introduced eased. Hence, provides clear-cut experiment effects. Second, stated above, Jena fairly representative region Germany terms Covid-19 cases. Third, smaller effects observed multiple treatment analysis may also result fact −by time regions followed example Jena− behavioral adjustments 
in Germany’s population also taken place. Wearing face masks gradually became 
common people started adopt usage even yet 
required.We also stress 40 60% might still lower bound...

This seems comparing similar regions time period, difference masking. see handwave away with, ""oh lockdown."" honestly seems like unnecessary stretch claim masks work (with regards reducing community transmission) quite bit evidence least suggest help. 

It's like historically minority people claim earth flat, seems really like stretch look sky see moon sun round. Like, could flat, scientific evidence seem support probably round. Let scientists continue testing go scientific consensus entertaining healthy doubt. mukbang

u canadians always one americans.  federal government failed

All failures Americans attribute ""federal government"" actually failures culture dumb, self-destructive selfishness (a.k.a. ""freedom"") prevalent country. Common Sense 101. never evidence kids spread disease, wishful thinking morons decided use justification downplaying threat. Enjoyable some. Beats eating alone depressed isolated. mention dipshits like Charlie Kirk telling cult followers ""The Left"" hates Thanksgiving families, patriotic thing celebrate Thanksgiving like normal. may fall short. much change, since post. Feel like know governors' names now.  Guido low watt user. over, never want hear words New Normal, droplets, mask up, social distancing ever again. probably ton add too. look frito lay big guys sometime. really like 5 companies comes food me.

Because said write constitution.

The constitution gives broad authority congress president regulate things. work local dollar tree 'hazard pay' went 2 dollars extra hour start, 1 scrapped completely october bought tesla stock 3 years ago btc amount, would make tesla despite btc quadrupling value time. shows crazy gain is. OMG know that. seriously gets awful. January can't come fast enough. flu normally R0 1.3-1.5 zero societal intervention flu season. restrictions place highly likely able propagate like normally would. Yet still better usa, billion people. Give break... lol people think everything cringy. helps physical, mental side. actual scientific article published NIH (instead Huffpost journalist opinion piece) arguing exactly saying : Animal proteins higher quality (more digestible bioavailable) plant proteins: case, no. Unfortunately. Luckily they've committing crimes since elected. new DOJ get them, NY State will. think bats tasty too.


And goes chance going China anytime soon. Hi Winnie. use anecdotal evidence proof overblown. Right? I've seen enough horror movies know ""it's likely dead"" means ""it's alive vengeance."" Absolutely. nobody say friends wore time. follow friends everywhere ensure proper mask usage? Haha. TX here, crippled boy governor came yesterday said outright he's closing anything anymore. cases small region ""defeating"" virus, temporarily avoiding it. Defeating would mean curing vaccine. Except blocked getting ppe held federal stockpiles. Except commended police seizing masks given protests. Except tried discredit CDC made go back recommendations multiple times. Narrator: didn’t. Yet evidence Trump administration's mishandling pandemic **criminal**. track 300,000 deaths year's end. yet Trump even go briefings anymore. 

He go prison alone. Good. already feel like vaccine slowed bureaucracy science point. depends live people vote area. direct correlation type media consumed believed, unfortunately breaks pretty seamlessly location. take month vaccine take effect

It take month vaccine take proven **full** effect. possible fact likely vaccine already (partially mostly) effective within time frame.

But right; effectively communicated people vaccination grant immediate immunity wait little stop social distancing. see complete win. Aldi ever caught wind somebody tried UNION DB, I'm sure they'd drop tables involved. Username checks out. *Floridian:* “first time, huh?” That’s ridiculous I’m sorry deal that, hope found way better environment Totally agree. risk. wife healthcare field got (early April). friend also front line got back hospital it. risk much higher everyone else. need keep healthy. They'll probably handing forms ""legacy gifts"". May offer counter argument?
In right precautions done. class go taped squares promoting distance, allowed cross others limit class size. instructor goes gets weights everyone.
We wear mask whole time now, shipping door open.
It done fitness routine helps physical, metabolic state mental health.
I know you’re alluding it’s blanket statement. it!!  Relevant username* saw too. Can't recall where. Channel 5 maybe? IIRC St Thomas Midtown West 12, Metro General 7 HCA comment. theory really around complexity cost solve issues. 

Basically, spread surfaces pretty easy show people much ""We're wiping door handles every 30 minutes! deep clean every weekend!"" sorts shit nothing, also cost lot.

Compare airborn. we're talking buying extra cases lysol wipes paying cleaning staff little extra, we're talking potentially expensive time consuming retrofitting HVAC systems. would improving air exchange rate, working filtering sterilizing air, sorts shit certainly cheap easy. 

So, basically every office building store said ""fuck it, let's surface cleaning thing"".  lol, oh rly? didn't. Blame people taking precautions, Walz who's trying fight 50% Minnesota 8 months now.  What’s opinion preprint? parents work plant, let tell you: tyson doesnt give fuck workers. see money. prey poor working class america complicit deaths. april, would overhear parents talk latest coworker either die get sick. grew desensitized time. 

the cases worst waterloo theyve ever been, still work 6 days week subpar pay. awful. means lot honestly thank good luck recovery!! Yeah.. quarantine effectively either end trip? know great. I'm sad. appreciate response though  fear too. funny corporations change messaging lot people would oligarchical tendencies country, instead come celebrate them. yeah, private prison systems create perverse incentives present justice/penal system.  answer take steps effective countries taken. takes working different leaders 50 states. takes task force. previous ""task force"" refused this. mean answer. is. Biden working towards goal. Trump easy blame numerous harms. MRNA vaccine efficacy insanely high vaccine. 95% ridiculous, like FDA would accepted vaccine 50-60% efficacy. dry ice thermal packs job. poorer countries already access stuff kept cold environments. I'm really sure trying argue. me.

I write constitution.

You actually seem like want argue. dont really time it. nice day. Get rid MCAT, fully pay family MD med school loans, fund double amount residency positions country got fighting chance meeting needs next 30 years. really quite good long... give read. people Reddit don’t go gym don’t understand crucial peoples mental health. lot people assume it’s jacked gym bros trying ripped possible, isn’t case. everyone vote, democracy. Sure, closer oligarchy, not. fact democracy gave space numerous changes we've able (often violently) extract representatives.

Could representative? Yup. Could representative now? Yup. mean weren't, currently democracy. fragile strong democracy certainly discussion. still democracy. history electing democratic governors though, Bevin third since WW2 believe seeing ICUs full COVID-19 patients,"" letter said. ""Our hospitals filling brim, virus continuing spread unchecked communities, meaning worst shoot past capacity care patients. need field hospitals, children's hospitals need take adult patients, ability care patients routine emergencies trauma patients, heart attacks, strokes greatly providers become overwhelmed burn out, many already. see COVID-19 take lives many Arkansans, directly indirectly."" Yeah, that's somewhat true. change anything terms everyone wearing them?  like koolaid cult, killing people much slower...this end well. Around Christmas we'll probably see news headline number people dying traced event.... also point: Essential workers like grocery store workers didn’t go art school study philosophy martyrs. Yeah know nurse talks big game taking seriously. fine visiting family indoors wear mask tells everyone take masks ""us."" second third weeks December going among bleak entire story pandemic. already unfathomable developed nation poorly combat virus, yet guys getting started. one magic bullet stop this.

Masks help, social distancing helps, advice ignored closing things becomes necessary.


People pointing months. Amen. aren’t brain dead, nothing wrong doing. anything virus show us need personally responsible health. Bring neighbor, hate most. Treat neighbor want treated, guess? might feel ""safe-ish"" go see anyone flu across country airplane cases time high, stay home. heard bus drivers Japan strike refusing collect fares? still ran busses bus companies collect revenue. Maybe solution like people still get treatment healthcare workers get heard. Tesla hit bit target $500, sold bit cut Margin reduce risk. COVID spread done private settings people don’t wear masks. Thank comment everything do. No, instead spend thanksgiving alone, stuck shitty dorm rooms eating crappy campus food, allowed use college resources payed full price for. fucking disgusting. Boycott company. Let's honest here. never protected served lol silent hill cult level shit Yes comforting knowing end sight. close (less year!!) vaccine. already excited holidays next year. implication someone White House cares whether people live die. Doesnt matter dont seem give shit Yay capitalism /s one things ridiculous must true. Correct I'm wrong, believe Danish government stated cull illegal end concluding it. .... don’t want people enter country one worst COVID responses planet earth .... color shocked. in:

Sources close story identified source leak ""anyone working set eyes"" from... anywhere: “No shit.” That's 5,082 deaths per day. went worldometers site added deaths yesterday European countries came 4,000. 

Are counting Russia, turkey, Ukraine, Belarus? I'm trying get political stuff, I'm trying understand consider Europe. Shutting retail right going Christmas season would catastrophic corporate. time COVID rampant getting worse less. can't replace workers day. takes months months hire train whole workforce scratch. pull corporate folks working couches field deal would make break will. want catch COVID, care do. Lol ridiculous, imagine someone starting conversation ""we're listening"" continue cooperative constructive discussion? He'll benefit 2 vaccines. I'm saying anything bad him, solution sort way wether anything not.  I'm 416! yeah, everyone know getting vaccine soon can. must weird social circle. give using violence threats endanger American lives? Thank you.

We gonna get dudes dudettes, together. Let’s keep spirits high even though it’s tough fuck. Boris Johnson got tested, although already caught months ago? Maybe someone bad condition corona made worse, cause death corona, corona. Anyway, MoMo data also official data, nobody hiding info case.  Trump simply helped hypernormalization open corruption hypocrisy.

Politicians know don’t need resign anymore — certainly clear everything Trump done. People vote team matter what.  Yes, already exists. Got link door puller? retractable part seems nice otherwise got another think sanitize. ones I've seen would make pocket become covid pit. can't even mad this, can't see ""It's big ol club, ain't it"", that's you. knew shit going on.

Viral density surfaces is, obviously, big thing. No, trials placebo controlled blind. total number infections placebo vaccine group hits certain thresholds independent safety data monitoring board reviews unblinded data. case 170 infection, 162 found placebo group 8 vaccine group. Thus extremely confident vaccine prevented symptomatic infection. check EPA registration number list N.  mean American politicians never held accountable hypocrisy, corruption, crimes. absolutely right.

The corruption hypocrisy become transparent/accepted; least used hide it. fired dereliction duty done move on. can’t uphold laws regulations don’t deserve job. winner takes Brave.. he's afraid fired? Lol Yeah. chlorinating lettuce. Cowboys! Hong Kong lot scrubbing surfaces measures like travel restrictions, strict quarantine, mandatory masking, safe distancing, limiting group size 4 sit-in dining 2 bars.

I live Hong Kong. rules really implemented. Many people wearing masks, many quarantine loopholes, lots restaurants bars completely ignoring law.

HOWEVER important point even half ass things able keep virus control (as case Hong Kong). countries cases going wild unbelievably fucking up. Bergamo, others already mentioned, seems El Paso situation now. bet cities situation soon enough. That's s*cialists want America 

/S NY area here. Yes, showing refrigerator trucks parked outside NY hospitals news every night. ran room morgues. also that. need rethink strategy.

San Bernardino City (USD) highly economically disadvantaged large number multi-generation homes—which consequence putting high risk people alongside kids, also providing adult supervision day even parents work. also issue lot undocumented people within homes. 

Last heard state trying authorize Medi-Cal (state low income insurance) undocumented persons, state coffers lacking federal Medicaid reimbursements, always issue potential exclusion fear seeking social services.

Best case, don’t think vaccine distribution anywhere near adequately diffused though community spring. Spring term would start mid-March. Many (if all) school facilities crowded state standards, even COVID.

Personally, think forces teachers admin use resources come quality plans adequate distance ed; lot districts wasted summer punted though Fall planning Winter return (which isn’t safe isn’t likely happen given numbers county). 

Coming two sets plans one foot door creates lot uncertainty lot second guessing lot false hope made next term—it makes clear done well plan B fall back on.

It done well—and hope help encourage quality development, stop-gap approach faculty parents. saw sort articles describing life migrant orchard workers. Ah yes, they'll totally able that! like online classes exist anything feel like there’s weird obsession maximizing personal liberties. someone able reject vaccinations put peoples lives risk?

We value someone’s choice receive vaccination many lives might end infection. seems backwards me. handful repeat quarantine breakers. Glad it, countries sent people jail, actually got lightly.  Battle fatigue. wonder people selfish ignorant wearing masks. helpful article. Thank you! that’s I’ll decorate name dart gun. know think actually funny empowered bondsmen, basically bounty hunters, able catch vaccinate people refuse mandatory vaccination. disinfectant might actually still work SARS CoV 2 though Buy locally. ...it's pretty nice feeling around town, gotta say! 
Hard decisions+big sacrifice+vast majority confirming = virus gone. relevant quite time. Great book would 2 months vaccine going back normal. want give penny them, also avoid Beyond Meat. portion company. trial test role masks source control SARS-CoV-2 infection

Source control important measure.
Your ideas like blowing nuclear reactors telling people ""Lol get cancer"".  think nuance.

I think fine visit two 20-something year old brothers wives kids risk miniscule.

But makes sense skip elderly parents / grandparents / etc.

I think one problems virus government medical community trying make everything black white - like there's difference fit 15 year old obese 80 year old. that's simply true. risk profiles different. man use bottom left... get door handle space Since people putting effort cleaning surfaces wearing masks properly, limiting number places go, reducing physical close contact social interactions etc

Cleaning surfaces gives false sense security making stuff think peak two three weeks? Winter indoor activity beginning. Thanksgiving week, Christmas month New Years Eve. states worst situations don’t appear changing course. Everywhere else feel like anyone would care already cares, don’t see overall calculus changing. 

I hope cases peak soon, don’t lot optimism left. sounds bleak.

So get abuse wearing mask, potentially prevents others infection?

But people likely happy walk around AR15 round neck ""to protect people"" hahahahahah.

Proof really... gun thing visual macho points.. wearing mask makes feel demasculinized. According late George Carlin, healthy generation ""Was tempered raw sh\*t"" Lol They've got 5% stake Beyond Meat. Indeed. BoJo really shy retiring. -70 C

I'm sure Trucker Joe going keep vaccine -70 C way across America. It’s literally real power unfortunately. Maybe get enough plaintiffs media attention around lawsuit least get settlement you’ve directly harmed them. Otherwise seems like government especially justice system pretty much protect them, us. dont saaaaaay confirm. Europe like Trump. God i’d sign quick. governor give shit. Luckily I'm able stay family acting like hermits shit over. go town see mask pathetic. Honestly whole administration one shit admins US ever Cash rules everything around come shock anybody. young people debate locking dying. debate locking going bankrupt. guess literally want come Jesus. point far right become death cult fixated rushing towards afterlife. American Roulette. way win get assraped health insurance, never need hospitalization Oh sure. Honestly, raised devout Christian, pastors various churches eventually turned away religion made question all. many check boxes personality disorders lol.  can't wait karaoke again!  Building immunity low-vulnerability population without spreading old people would require isolating old people. think police would willing enforce ban visiting grandparents? people would open that? People would complaining much restrictions. ferrets? noticed petland example still ferrets customers handle. 25% people live wear masks. concern? in, Trumps handling COVID-19 virus sub par. criminal trials trump administration functionaries, eventually mob head himself, riveting television UK, schools shown far biggest transmission vector, bigger hospitality gyms combined. Yes considering thats increase compared normal year, numbers start virus exponential growth. announcing interim results, PR competition first make press release. live alone work remotely. see going gym bad case albeit fully expect closed next week NYC. thinking Florida. honestly, there's many choose from. Yes remember people. Covid shown us places world practice culture decency, realism civic-mindedness. Rural America one places. modern take, Fast Food Nation Eric Schlosser. goes detail meat factories too. end exactly think will. I've seen essential workers mentioned. know 70% Indians live rural areas.... may even know covid likely can’t spread it. Someone weird shit yesterday trying tell can’t relax bit could spread even though it, took everything take seriously  100% meant insult. show respect man stands shakes hand. hospitals want covid patients. Risk infecting medical staff aside, reality covid patients often poorly insured insured all, ignorant, stupid, good following orders. increase everyone's risk pay bills. people buy insurance they're sick right now, likely declare bankruptcy pay hospitals bills. assuming trials variables constant. Moderna pfizer trials USA, cases never slowed down, Oxford one mainly based UK, Brazil, infections died little middle. specifically, ""not rush"" put announcement interim results.

It's like lounging around watching tv afternoon, hitting pub 5pm.  I’m subject covid vaccine study. There’s currently plan us get vaccine study done 2 years. won’t stop us dropping out/exit get commercially available vaccine, encouraging us either.  Yep, watch NFL games talk needing repeat test five days positive results practicality. Judging number retail workers I've seen wear masks noses pull unless customer right front (as that's time breathe virus particles stay airborne prolonged periods)...plenty care. added “Sherlock” end!  stops what? havent heard say anything worth butthurt sub long time now. admit pretty ridiculous completely proportion point. What’s latest upset about?  even authors' data shows optimistic. 

You seem agree authors conclussions data, think clearly state think *These data suggest cell memory might reach stable plateau, slower decay phase, later first 6 months post-infection.* 

This means author saying immunity +6 months likely. contradicting optimistic conclussions authors (totaly fine me), rather point view, much common people know. hard confirm there's way confirm homologous reinfection.

Sorry seems like speculation me. understand reinfections course accounted (for example mild infections require hospitalization). serious reinfections (that require hospitalization) much harder miss. 1 case death reinfection worldwide, safely assume another ones show doctors scientists would interested investigating those. example remember case doctor Barcelona supposedly catched twice second one required ICU, remember confirmed reinfection not.

As posted another comment, hospital wife (internal medicine doctor) works, seen one case reinfection far (mild case times). works one one biggest hospitals Madrid (hot spot cases). course anecdotical think reliable ""I know friend twice"".

And point PCRs. PCRs done outside sterile place (lab hospitals) easily contaminated show false positives.

And learnt positive PCR one negative mean reinfection (again, korean report good one cant find right now).

Of course reinfections possible, said large heterogeneity immune response. mean reinfections common.

Finaly topic number reinfection. healthy person really reinfected perpetually worse severity, little time infections (months) without body building kind protection constantly losing it? I'm expert read seems unlikely, described (serious) viral infections. like Sunday liquor store runs Wisconsin back day news, sky blue. charts hospitalizations. We're starting make first two waves look like appetizers. People like me, wears mask every time leave house, limited activities point going work, coming home, occasionally going grocery store food, fucked nation. went gym 2 months state sitting 1% positivity rate. 

Interesting analysis. Thanks input. vaccine less effective, trial completed early. Vaccines trials unblinded certain amount cases happen (vaccine + placebo arm combined), 100% effective vaccine take twice long compared 0% effective vaccine, keeping things constant “If try leave we’re gonna kick out!” doesn’t make sense. They’re still gone! fact u say anything positive outside thread u get downvoted stupid (especially coming think I’m one positive people here)

Literally said seems lungs long haulers begin repair woke downvotes Yeah vaccinate country 100% like 3x surplus needs go somewhere. It'll start April. way since forever still one ONE SINGLE winter get passed. think would make people calm hunker knowing end sight. nah. happen. Hospitals still full records broken daily. Actually, thanksgiving good celebrated extended family.  relevant he's crippled? know mean come way, comes insult - unfortunate many better things could insulting on, like intelligence decision making skills person sister - always extremely careful covid - tested + 3.5 weeks ago still grinding along barely staying hospital symptoms new symptoms popping day... 

This angers me. Truly idiotic. Absolutely brainwashed idiots running attending gathering. mere fact thanksgiving meal idea f'g maddening me. fact sick people bring system therefore issues society - truly care would enjoy watching morons suffer. said loud, clicked find it, top comment. Wonderful. at? always remember large groups people tend extremely stupid selfish unless otherwise proven be. Go things assuming worst prefer pleasantly surprised dont disappoint you.

Or maybe Im cynical days. Or, makes world look like we're inundated ninjas, frankly awesome. Reinfection recurrence real, tune 17%. We're long haul this, denial it, Statistical analyses performed clinical, laboratory, radiologic image, medical treatment, clinical course admission/quarantine/readmission data, recurrence predictive algorithm developed. 16.7% recovered patients PCR positive recurring one three times, despite strict quarantine. Younger patients mild pulmonary respiratory syndrome higher risk PCR positivity recurrence. surprised garbage Carolina's best better shit  fully agree this. me, would choose wedding closest 30 friends family done it. 

You see, live (Malaysia), custom hold extremely lavish grand weddings, invite relatives country abroad wedding, even met life meet festive season. weddings usually served expensive stuff (as per chinese wedding customs ""wedding food""), price night like easily amount 6 digits currency. assuming RM100,000 , thats around USD25,000 wedding night dinner. 

Basically due customs parents family dictate must, mentioned find ridiculously unnecessary, weddings people show sake bar closest family members friends, leave dessert even served, ""obligation"" attend completed. 

To me, use 25 grand I'd much prefer hold small wedding island resort fly closest friends family instead. 

Congratulations wedding too! Many happy days ahead! horrified Christian. cannot explain current madness.

It seen completely selfish dishonorable. 

I apologize embarrassing relatives like playing Plague Inc. millions NPCs send ally requests Cleaning chemicals dangerous body, especially environment suddenly over-inundated them. healthy environment.

But also, zealous cleaning regimes institutional business level give impression safety making actual difference safety. Time money spent cleaning programs can/should instead go purchasing PPE effective important measures. U.S. president routinely spread misinformation pandemic now
 Due position power literally millions people believed misinformation. people coming milder temperatures warmer climates can’t take weather 
I family UK Canada family Canada wants come US sick tired cold despite telling Canada better. 
Your also using metrics people immigrate looking countries better move come like make move let’s honest America isn’t best anything it’s better countries planet plus top metrics comparing smaller countries Country continental country population 330 million 
Some places America par Europe others gutter notice immigrants usually go places highly developed ( won’t find immigrant communities West Virginia) 
Another salary cost actually better depending profession. Maybe police countries, U.S.

First, fuck police they’re worst offenders here. state wide mandate everyone must wear mask anywhere outside personal homes, exceptions. I’ve never seen cop mask. It’s infuriating, ones enforcing it, person they’re talking choice let maskless, probably contagion-infested, rat get personal space. fuck them. they’re going try protect other’s health, dead last get vaccine deal like did.

Secondly, police don’t risk lives protect us, risk lives “protect” us (in America). Let die, gives fuck anymore people. 

Less republican voters 2024 big plus Corona! take offense this! make effort inadequate. mean, blatantly, sociopathically sadistic, I'd tempted answer somebody like taking mask coughing right face. people stupid. Yeah... this. pay $750 year president? used ""Good News"" territory? like 90% brah, one area worn mask since July live one visited county country everyone completely fine. Nothing shut tourists still come without masks spend money talk rest country pretty much prison. live, fucking silly. Close family member it. please, tell real world works. mess PPE tests US back March. gonna long winter. put past administration seize tons vaccine use friends. essentially thing vaccine, needs continually re-sprayed. possibly really easy one implement since require trained medic inject. Sounds like great intermediate step people get vaccine. That's said it. said number total ICU beds respirator country, went list many occupied many occupied COVID-19 patients. sure COVID-19 patients beds actually respirator, beds respirator? know confusing, still trying find information. 

And yes, Denmark much smaller spread, much smaller hospitalization much smaller amount ICU patients currently. Earlier September actually Sweden per capita wave since subsided swedish one rose up. must make sacrifices art get lol

But seriously position USA $3000 mean much majority people. nooo let’s give money like 10 people let rest us starve Lucky, can’t even get idiots keep masks office. R95 masks though, otherwise wouldn’t coming in. several cases hush hush... don’t understand people. Collectivized identity grievance preyed upon people looking make buck? context data:

* NC recently changed hospitalizations. ""The [new calls facilities report COVID-19-related hospitalizations entire length patient’s stay. Previously, federal agency required reporting patients time isolation precautions — period time usually reached maximum 21 days. "" last week, hospitalizations creeping much lower rate headline seems imply (100 new hospitalizations week, much slower rate case increase).
* HOWEVER, case numbers last week rising increasing rate (today 4000 cases reported first time, 2800 week ago) higher rate I've seen NC pandemic... percent positive approaching 10%. week two we'll see headline again, underlying reality much harsher hospitalizations begin catch rising cases. studies showing lungs literally repair damage... Well point current situation going get bad issue forced. 

Doctors nurses already burning out, retiring early, dropping dead pandemic. State governments resisted masks, social distancing, basic preventive measures already seeing bodies pile ICU's hit capacity.

And eventually public going realize politicians actively blocking Covid relief name ""rugged individualism"". Professionally responsibility healthcare provider take every reasonable measure help protect patients, includes getting vaccine. Personally well aware risks associated vaccine judged less real complications showing covid patients startling frequency. Also people let go good paying jobs, order make ends meet took lower paying jobs places hiring (like Amazon). people's income slashed yet counted unemployed also since technically job. 7-day average daily deaths US passed 1220, increasing issue demand ignored Lol getting silly barely get people wear masks. you? someone wants clean, let them. article directly refutes state broke fuck. Probably .. ur thinking key employee policy.. usually requires lvl employment factory meat processor .. ie company loss cost associated vested interest employee.. saying I’m approve plants operate, saying don’t confuse key employee life insurance they’re .. they're hypocrites make wrong.  anyone know US icu capacity? Well guess heard completely made up? Pfizer's vaccine rapidly developed due synthesized via opioid substrate order pass blood-brain barrier. Evil geniuses true. not, maybe. 11.6% figure spanning screenings September 2019 March 2020, entirely pre-pandemic. seems actually suggest 4 900 cases early October. zero. grandpa already got recovered. He’s 80 fuck btw. That's fair deal though otherwise billions people vaccinated, potential frivolous lawsuits massive. What, opposed giving information corporations? Funny thing. Heart attacks, strokes, coronavirus caused thing. people reddit never left homes pandemic. ah ah ah, customer always right./s That's attitude seem least.  I'm sure could respond texts, would say ""If y'all ain't paying rent, y'all can't tell cancel Thanksgiving Christmas parties."" call ""surplus"" ""toll"". way people react things phrasing. Americans genocided entire people enslaved another. Talk throwing stones glass houses. 

If knew much pretend know China wouldn’t lying Tibet particular. 

Modern day America worse practically every way. reddit hermits. Yeah, vote Dems like Cuomo instead send parents grandparents slaughter nursing homes. African-American, sure, experience much common descendants enslaved west African people US. governor said everything ok. Genshin impacts character pull rate 0.6% hit 3 4 times.... say 5%?  experimental vaccines Pfizer Moderna, technically called BNT162b2 mRNA-1273 respectively, created synthetically using messenger Ribonucleic acid (or mRNA). RNA DNA (Deoxyribonucleic) nucleic acids carry genetic instructions creating life. Bidens America  could've predicted this? Certainly, somebody job that. Arrested, nah. Kicked establishment, yes 11.6% figure spanning screenings September 2019 March 2020. 4 900 cases early October. different saying 11.6% people already infected September 2019  regards saying 'the pit', please remember El Paso reached point doctors extreme premium, reached point triage decide basically going get treatment not. Patients poor outlook sent die chance infect doctors nurses. They've reached point enough doctors anymore, anyone gets sick completely screwed. 

If things turn around what's going happen going start putting medical students charge floors (which really fucking bad idea; happened Spanish Flu). Minus last chapter- Yes. mistake. people want die bad? make lot sense, people smoke cigarettes knowing kills It’s speech point.

""iT's rEaL fReE It’s inciting panic.

[Oh toxic fkwit encouraging everyone stupidly expose us deadly virus consequences. knew? downvotes? simply true. vaccine gives body ability create antibodies covid. takes 4 weeks two shots get immunity. point people hospital already antibodies cases following pneumonia killing them. Giving people vaccine pointless gets. cure... danger nothing OP said could life death issue, maybe treat such. misleading enough critics episode 3 believe grievous took last working escape pod...but truth escape pod barely functioning, propulsion provided coughs. Part problem medical science basically carried forward bunch wrong assumptions aerosols/droplets. traditional cutoff set 5um, anything bigger considered droplet. Droplets also considered medical community fall ground quickly, 6 feet distance constitutes protection. 

The problem reality, 5um ""droplets"" remain suspended air several hours. 6 feet distance adequate protection, droplet needs like 250um, droplets much smaller 250um carry infectious dose covid. Wtf talking video anyone see number worldwide cases surged past 14,550

Fuck me, daily increase 14,550 cases globally would *amazing* now, let alone total cases. far we've come.  country needs purge. cost?  Jesus kinda matters. Sure, pandemic end, since, well, everything comes end, even time. come end kids lifetimes? well said. 
i know lot time, argue people online - lot less convincing person, rather randoms might come across thread otherwise swayed first person comments, without alternative opinion weigh it. Exactly! Well, they’ll outraged “it could never happen them.” went remote spring, teaching remotely sucks - get - stress anxiety hard - especially I’m apparently black sheep staff insofar precautions proper mask wearing times. scream STAY PERSON .... subs ... classroom teachers start “fall” (as test positive), done far person goes.  came schools it, parents send papers beforehand. It’s going come end. it’s still ways out. That’s think he’s saying. fucking stupid be? normal slaughter house managers brain capacity 12 year old, Tyson special?  want people do?

Take thanksgiving century pandemic. Thanks. KN95's ready scarier places. grocery shop actually bad (yet). Probably dangerous things done since March 2 haircuts, getting temporary crown, permanent one. It’s alarming people don’t recognise this.

It’s always someone higher ups fault willing put mask on, wash hands social distance. 

The end pandemic everyone’s hands equally individualism idiocy seems bubbled top many countries, all, certainly far many. 

It’s even worse us brain think others suddenly realise share world people seem (depressingly) rather pervasive originally seemed pre covid. Fuck North Dakotan skeptics. shits getting real. ""the rest us *selfishly go life"" 

FTFY think vaccine given children right away. also immuno compromised people can't get vaccine (either safe enough immune system actually respond). need keep mind part 30% contribute herd immunity.

Also, may one 5% unlucky people respond vaccine. think economic issues people facing gonna magically end vaccine? Small business 95% country one years number new small business starts lower amount went broke. vaccine gonna make everyone economy go well know better. That’s works. It’s cure. problem asking, ordering. mask public? Arrested. Refrigerated trucks mass graves comes next. guy stereotypical rich white male inconsiderate douchebag californian claims shit never does, proud governor represents state accurately feel lucky Australian right Yes that? working laptop coffeehouse (before times) guy tell , ""hey smile"". Yes often grin continuously working excel, dare forget viewing pleasure “Tired bone” sounds weird. Mate, live Sydney.... strain virus hit Australia rest Asia 10 times less contagious one hit Europe America. 

Odd many forget key aspect virus.  agree 100%. live NJ, caught Covid couple weeks ago. contacted text message department health county everyday asking getting better getting new symptoms. would say getting worse, would text saying doctor would call, one ever called. told stay apartment 14 days. 

Thankfully recovered. Still headaches occasionally, never went lungs. terrified though. worst part uncle passed away covid 2 days diagnosed. treat breathing stopped heart started failing. missed funeral. 

 one helping me, main physician vacation, doctors kept telling nothing point hospitalized. ridiculous. needed federal response. needed tax dollars fucking mean something. government spends money blowing random people middle east fucking bailouts farming companies instead ANYTHING keep us dying. I'm one better responding states still garbage care. can’t imagine evil. good N95, I've fan KF94, especially outdoor use quick trips indoors. feel bad people, Idiocracy. easier fool someone convince fooled. NOPE! North Dakota hits 70% threshold, they're good go. believe natural reproduction rate Covid 3. That's nothing all. theory vaccine 66% percent effective everybody takes get reproduction rate 1. Anything 66% effectiveness takes 1, good. 

Like said though biggest issue *some* areas people refusing take it. Can't vaccinate stupid. everybody vaccinated still important wear masks while. word won? distributed

That’s thing takes long time people saying mask distancing needed reaches certain point. Yeah think it’s good they’re moving hard fast. We’ve learnt Melbourne case things quickly go 700 cases daily takes 100 days get back zero. sheer fact 4000 people isolation indication fast get hand course vaccines change everything, big BUT: Imagine western society big part vulnerable beeing vaccinated. economy force politics lift restrictions, people want go back normal large majority still unvaccinated (due availability) people get infected alot young people die get severe covid last wave. happy vaccines careful celebrate thing really over. downvote /Remindme 5 months Thank tip! I’ll surely buy use it. Glasses definitely struggle. students completely given wearing theirs, others developed ways work - it’s daily, foggy struggle! I'm germophobe. 

When common cold turn asthmatic bronchitis three months recover...taking precautions phobia. rational response. dunno. say ""a bit much"" say ""when last time someone shot school Aus?"" Holy fuck. Perspective. summer, glad less common people get twice herd immunity would still easily happen. Wonder vaccine help people got virus long lasting effects it? got July still feel right day. lockdown ensure contact tracers job well state I'm from, half population ontario, currently around 7-10k cases day, anything good 😂 I'm really sure governors trying prove hardball stances, reality sets doctor's decide come work refusal anything gonna make look pretty foolish. Fauci said ""as soon April"". mean even expects April, *earliest*. 

We also know long effective broadly protects people. Earlier reports antibodies stay around months. slightly evolved stain Europe. fact many antivaxxers, confidence reach herd immunity anytime soon.

Yes, I'd love society back normal April. I'd rather prepared hunker another year, get pleasantly surprised, wait impatiently April, wait longer. I'm kind person takes comfort someone telling ""we're almost there, 5 miss minutes"". College education =/= morals   ka-ching..... insulting? don’t get looking forward crab people Annnnnnnd half America think it’s kiddie blood refuse take it. didn’t vaccine know truly extent it. It’s always money I'm sure amount education prevent brainwashing morals corruptible--a big part brainwashing uses peoples' desire moral them. Brainwashing work anyone, designed exploit pretty universal aspects human psychology. People brainwashed idea they're manipulated.

Maybe detailed course techniques brainwashing watch sources trying could help prevent it, even everyone great education they're young they'd probably forget eventually still vulnerable getting brainwashed later life. New Mexico too. Couple hours ago. ever not?

Denial ain't river Africa.  new normal now. Flu season virus season. Don’t also supply Chick Fil A? New Mexico sent emergency alert well. around 100 cases day end summer started skyrocket. gone 1000 cases day 2000 today close 3000- week. Since trust companies goal dollars? time political field fueled same? 

Everyday it’s new post next vaccine better next.... like car sales men.

Trump said vaccine would time election. is... would know this? would know trials would successful then? It’s money driven... Yea that’s flu vaccine. talking serious side effects. "" one employee vomited production line, managers reportedly allowed man continue working return work next day.""

That straight nasty.  smell hospitals winter someone cannot imagine must like dealing reddit offer, thank you. Going #1. know holidays important people, genuinely can't wrap head around thought important can't skip year zoom call. said half million spring 2021 downvoted repeatedly told stupid lol.

102 days spring. order prediction true America needs average 2389 deaths per day going forward. RemindMe! 1 March 2021 fucking hate abbott know won’t long term negative health effects show line?

Is something specific kind vaccine kind rules out?

I know sort thing happened women giving birth children birth defects, there’s always ad tv suing company negative effects medicine road.

Anybody want put mind ease? “It covid something else”  joined gym near house went tonight. Maybe 9 people one wearing mask. They'll put go store they're closer together breathing place want to? Idiotic \*1990, 1999, 2002.

5. Engagement, engagement, engagement. Group projects via Zoom. Teachers still give awards safely, distance. Energetic, caring teachers ability reach pre-recorded lesson hug good real thing. 
6. Closed emails stringent security provided district devices. Closed platforms, comprehensive classes parents/guardians locking monitoring home internet usage.  


Modern problems require modern solutions. Yah guy 100% idea talking about. Definetly work abuse victims, would know ""calling 911"" always solution. Especially mental abuse.

The police evidence, leave, ya real hot water. amount people keep blaming mother absolutely astounding. Thank trying convince him, think lost cause. vaccine likely room temp refrigerated diluent mixed, raise temp bit. vaccine stored -70 degrees assume feel uncomfortable getting Zostavax vaccine stored around 0 degrees. -70, probably around 36 degrees. yeah pleasant beats getting covid. like WO II, jews wear star chest Big 20 million vaccine doses would stop something like 75% deaths. ignore COVID catch asap! cool place. actually post accounting time day looking something different I’ve always thought got causality wrong. Kids families parents told truth kept promises waited extra marshmallow. Kids families parents lied didn’t keep promises ate marshmallow right away. didn’t well later life. would’ve thought. Worse, he’s willfully endangering people took oath protect. Could still nocebo effect though. Unlikely since antibodies now, still technically possible. Interesting, thanks! annoying af it? I'm sure look great reading! Contemplative! Studious! Engaged! 

 gotten lot too. I'm pretty happy person, usually said I'm something requires concentration, interestingly, woman ever said me. I'm south, idk something it. Like appear pleasant times anything else? knows kinda ridiculous spent seven seasons building White Walkers powerful villains killed minutes. mortality rate come little bit since beginning; need account accurate estimation. don’t. know people want money cure. think it. one needs much cooler temperature shorter storage time.  Blessed news One take half ass shower pinch! God treats every person equal, people equal others.  Woah, didnt know ballpark Aidells. Damn, thought avoiding Tyson years. Bingo bongo. It’s interesting exclusively post r/Coronavirus avid Covid denier. need new hobby, one really depressing. real Loving always waiting everyone else get first mean applications! Texas every non-super-rich state can't afford lockdown without federal support. Blaming governors (even ones care health constituents) misguided. Makes argument appointing Sheriffs electing them. Get office dereliction duty. refusing order superior. measures save untold lives. 

And cause unestimated problems, economic, deaths, suicides, mental illness, supply chain, jobs, small businesses getting eaten big ones risk global contagion, political unrest. 

All things consequences deaths remain flat. 

Did know global starvation due economic reasons doubled globally year? That's 10-15M people dead hunger 2020 versus 2019. 

Do 10-15M people globally matter 250K US? 

Food inflation real right now. 

Imagine make $1.50/day spend 80% income price good goes 30-40%. Then, country begins export food earns much higher prices west cost food goes more. think thats authoritarian, youre selfish.

Go ahead look definition authoritarian me. What’s even strange trump called months ago? Said vaccine would ready election? would know would turn accurate?  midst delirium near death I've theorized tongue honest two occasions intoxication(love counts)and death. point I'd assume body brain running reserves+necessities analogy booting Windows safe mode. think incident maybe happening right?

I'vs heard virus behaves providing euorphric feeling human host sudden death days later. I'm split theory administration therapeutics cause truly coronvirus behaves?..

Your 1st link lead 2nd.  hope seeing come alter lives wakes people climate change. could direct impact lives economy covid has, people’s reaction still “naaaah...” What?  COVID forever changed people retail used treat sickness. work retailer managers associates used come sick colds flus Superman grind simply could afford miss work. Now, sign sickness, people take seriously ensure work spread it. never anal disinfecting equipment use work. I've since start pandemic recently required so. remember used make fun mom wore mask sick even allergies. mom enjoyed last laugh indeed saw everyone using them.

I count blessings sure. March, COVID symptoms work took equation. body aches, 100 degree fever, INSANE fatigue, lost taste smell 5 days. Then, mom dad got sick...my son never got sick. I'm sure COVID, time April rolled around, better. Oooof course do. cost?

It cheap, significantly cheaper done nothing let spread (I strong bias glad healthcare staff getting burnt and/or PTSD).

It turns virus spreading uncontrolled population good thing, can't really get back 'normal' remove equation. Err.. wut? Chiming someone severe adverse reaction flu vaccine. Btw, anti-vaxxer, think twice given history. since diagnosed several autoimmune diseases. keep reading trials excluded people prior adverse reactions vaccines well autoimmune disorders. also see things stating covid vaccines safe ""healthy"" people. 

So think real concern anybody autoimmune disorders. mean, hard trust science body always respond normal expected way. flu vaccine reaction almost like autonomic storm nervous system went overdrive. Terrifying stuff. 

Vaccines wonderful, safely take them. seen method safer usual vaccine creation methods, least autoimmune conditions. anyone input that, happy listen. yeah, know, deaths constipation that. I’ve left house mandatory stuff, work part-time job. would appreciate called douche I’m curious.

So get vaccine, cannot get transmit virus?

Ah selfish arrogance Americans. Pandemic raging looking yourself. us favor catch thing, don’t go bothering doctors nurses, keep freedom ride ego sunset.

The original concept key employees, clearly practice exclusively restricted them. bad vaccines require special refrigeration can't sit shelves hospital. 0/10 trolling, nice try many people killed last mass shooter US? 20? study estimates 1/6 it, 1/6 infected it. seems consistent [0.1% 0.7% IFR, we've seen throughout US kept nursing homes.

Is level actual N95? I'd love buy better mask beyond cloth ones noticed KN95 times always looked sort flimsy. May specific brand though. still go office twice week. company keeps giving us line ""HR watching numbers."" (Like people HR scientists something. funny thing know HR team pretty well. They're seeing numbers terrified too.) thing that's keeping even slightly sane stash KN95's. top one surgical mask wear face shield top that. coworkers think I'm nuts really care.

Meanwhile countries squandered summer bad position winter. we're likely run testing materials sometime near future, least based articles appeared recently. couldn’t agree started something anything.

Uncomfortable skin. Vaccines don’t work like this. Also think psychology would backfire. think best normalize behavior getting vaccinated done last 50 years. (With exception shit heads want politicize public health issues) “We got ball game” average states 12% I'm 8%. According Same

The minute we're low enough transmission mask mandates pulled stores stop advising masks I'm tossing mine drawer hoping never take unless use dust filter filthy job 1- cases proven,

Because rare person encounter one strain Covid. Even common almost one gets test sequenced. extreme artificial limiter. 
Prediction people looking people multiple infections one test showing clear mean time. Want bet find? Lol need lesson things work. Worst probably April see someone falling video. That's it.

But know people suddenly go wandering around business attire dropping dead. 0.19 % New Jersey's population *has already died* COVID. 99.8% infection survival rate bullshit estimate. attitude pretty much ""everybody's gonna get it"", matter need true all.

Almost everyone need get - whereas ""it"" means immunity. there's two ways achieve that, hard way (virus), easy way (vaccine). ""freedom"" nutjobs apparently chose hard would nice actual leadership acted right.

Exactly. Thanks! grandchildren gonna read history books 6/100 equal 12% Yes. [Here’s one example week. Cherokees showing beat shit:

That makes sense, safer then. Get new hobby, misinformation encouragement disregard guidelines dangerous. you’re going dick ignore rules, whatever. stop posting it. You’re vile twisted selfish prick, Reddit doesn’t need know that. It’s easy claim 95% effective virus doesn’t show symptoms 95% people catch it. really hope noone infected if, hope learn something. know people test last resort swab. included.  vaccine? News thats like 4.8 million people? Roughly like 40% american cases? they’re dead, they’ll longer highest infection rate world. Problem solved. know anecdotal know least 10 people gotten zero lasting symptoms. seems odd rite wonders law order sell people anymore. That's elections go percentages probability symptoms occur 1 14 days. data show probability contracting COVID symptoms higher day 2-4 say day 10-14?

Especially since doses available. now, mandatory Covid vaccination proposals boost antivax sentiment without actually vaccinating anyone. majority people are! That's great thing, enough wear masks.. Y’all dour mofos Thats it. epidemic narcisistic behavior top covid pandemic. Take upper left arm going public places, use N95, KN95 KF94 mask. Probably others? genuinely curious. live Massachusetts aside security theater, we've done nothing stop spread actually pretty effective first shut down.

We liberal state too. Doctors nurses lot areas US sooooo close done walking away hospitals en masse. terrifying, nobody gives shit.

Polio lot less deadly Covid-19 lot harder catch primarily transmitted feces. 

Yet I've never heard anyone describe US reaction polio overreaction. Herd immunity ain't gonna work virus that's confirmed infected - killed, patients already caught beat virus You’re wrong that. People definitely freaking out. TP supplies already sold bigger cities. Store shelves looking bare like March. he's trolling always Doors Stone. sad!!! I’m Michigan never even started school back up!

Either way he’s unfit hold office. They're usually kind attenuated virus (which much, much smaller cell) occasionally inactivated single-celled organisms like mycobacteria, that's big get iirc. never something big enough comprised *contain* cells.

And case, none Covid vaccine candidates cellular. They're proteins, inactivated virus, (in Pfizer/Biontech's case), new kind encapsulated nucleic acid.

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing necessarily dumb non-biologist wonder that. *confidently declare* something wrong another story. American road design incredibly hostile non-drivers almost always prioritizes speed safety. answer would solve Covid road fatalities.

The disease called COVID-19 require infection SARS-COV-2 virus saddens senior medical student wrote otherwise.


A person considered disease even two 16 (that number bounced since April) symptoms. 

No, I’m wrong. Go read websites World Health Org, US CDC, government health orgs.

There 21MM residents Florida. 0.2% 42k deaths. Florida 17k deaths now. appears governor OK letting another 25K die next months.  mean respect opinion. snob mask always slips. Always.

Bro aint taking shit till 2024 happens elect introverts study’s findings “should used conclude recommendation everyone wear masks community would effective reducing SARS-CoV-2 infections, trial test role masks source control SARS-CoV-2 infection,” authors wrote.

Per Reuters seems nice but... major vaccine candidates require cold-chain infrastructure lot poorer countries have? 1.34 million world wide.

If read one name per second everyone died COVID would take 15.5 days, non-stop, read every name. Still, better safe sorry. Cuomo said end first phase lot people reported sick despite claiming never go homes. Sure, likely overstating isolation also posibility got stuff they've ordered. Why? US probably first vaccine distribution body, choice far I'm concerned. seems like that's fair. could say thing country world. Newsflash antivaxxers everywhere including Canada lol post reeks xenophobia “ nation’s response epidemic depends health care equipment personnel; response also reflects nation’s core values. epidemic many individuals may asked endure personal inconvenience make sacrifices protect health others. situation exemplified quarantine, many possibly exposed currently asymptomatic individuals separated rest society kept work, social activities, family contacts. SARS epidemic 2003, jurisdictions affected Canada, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam. Hundreds thousands people quarantined, people overwhelmingly supported effort complied. example, Toronto, 30 000 people placed quarantine 10 days, 27 people required court orders

The nations affected SARS known communitarian values social solidarity. contrast, United States known rugged individualism, willingness invoke legal rights, belief health care matter personal responsibility. Thus, fair ask whether Americans would willing enter quarantine voluntarily, especially when, case Ebola, quarantine would last 21 days. Already, first people placed quarantine Ebola, highly publicized instances noncompliance.”

Written brother believes every single person gets covid, even extremely mild case, going life long permanent damage. Sure thing 🙄 Since work around members public (relatively) low risk means I'm probably closer back line? That's true, really nothing 2020 good. relatively speaking covid-19 situation think good news Nope still number billions  made chortle 🤭 Fine.

No, pointing difference country's run pandemic virus totally give time finish second helping potatoes. Everyone knows diseases transmit eating. food blocks virus particles.  shit lol.

Oh protected served alright. public they're supposed to. sorted years come, opinion may significant genetic factors serious disease is.

I also think geographic factors matter. possible historic exposure certain types illnesses southeast Asia provided better immune resistance covid 19.  course vaccine novel virus something provide alternative testing.  alternative using masks sake spreading virus keep mouth shut stay home. people Florida right go outside get infected moron wearing mask fucking pandemic. That's why.

Because people understand science issue suggest stop fucking thing.

I'm tired 'the solution can't worse cure' bullshit. Tax rich. Pay keep business' families afloat. Figure out.

We pay taxes live society. want wear mask stay fuck inside property get anyone sick.

Is fair waitress serve people refuse wear masks? work boss care socially distance yourself?

Then what, get fired? lose benefits. That's cruel unfair.

I can't come explanation based direct gender bias. Goes without saying hospitals obviously prioritize saving men women.

But feeling people think COVID overblown politics, evidently million US, gonna waiting line get jabbed. incredibly put touch what's going on. could wrong understanding this:

given virus requires infected host come contact vulnerable host order spread continue survive, enough hosts either die recover become immune, enough chances remaining vulnerable population come contact remaining carriers virus dies dissapears.

so basically requires three assumptions I'd say..

(1) host recovers, permanently immune immune long enough matter. ( vaccines help individual become immune without infected first.) so, also assuming virus mutate time soon immunity lost time soon.

(2) infected host dies longer contagious.

(3) virus cannot exist viable state long outside host.

given assumptions, eventually reach state virus can't find hosts replicate dies off. That's think 'herd immunity' is.

To put worst case terms, everyone else dies, carriers left transmit survivors. 
heh, really think mean enough people get infected recover longer carriers then, again, remaining vulnerable population able come contact anyone infect them. Definitely important. fight global warming day tiddy bar night! I've similar thoughts, Nightmare fuel either way?!  messed up, Thanksgiving days away...  Love name.

As early September 2019, VEA named primary suspect associated new respiratory syndrome. privately commissioned laboratories FDA’s forensic laboratory identified VEA variety THC vape juices legitimate illicit sources.19 20 However, analysed samples selected using convenience sampling, even without link patients. Convenience sampling renders results vulnerable selection bias increasing likelihood chance findings.

In one retrospective observational study,21 CDC assessed temporal spatial concurrence VEA EVALI Minnesota. analysed certain samples confiscated police another batch linked patients EVALI, CDC concluded VEA strongly associated outbreak, VEA present vaping pods prior 2019 symptoms EVALI reported prior present outbreak. Nevertheless, association (however strong) necessarily equals causation due unobserved confounders. case, those: selection bias due convenience sampling (only vape pods linked patients, others seized law enforcement) numerous unaccounted factors: samples confiscated 2018, record potential ill health effects associated use, data regarding either storage conditions police evidence lockers and/or stability VEA open illicit vape/pods, on. Selection bias unaccounted confounders render results vulnerable type 1 error (false positive). report also questionable external validity: confiscated illicit samples Minnesota (where medical cannabis legal, recreational use illegal) may necessarily inferential whole USA.

Three CDC reports confirmed presence VEA vape pods linked patients EVALI (843 samples linked 1090 patients,3 677 samples linked 95 patients22 545 samples 70 patients,23 respectively). However, data regarding VEA content incompletely reported (no sample means, SD/IQRs CIs published) rendering results/conclusions unreliable.

In case series 51 patients EVALI24 undergoing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), 48 BAL fluids (94%) tested positive VEA. potential role VEA EVALI presumed based fact VEA detected BAL fluid comparator group. However, methodological errors study. First, comparison based false equivalency: control samples obtained 1–3 years earlier healthy individuals Ohio, vaped nicotine-only fluids (VEA exposure unlikely). Furthermore, data VEA stability/detectability biological samples lengthy storage time. Second, BAL performed discretion attending clinicians various time points course EVALI without reference/stratification medical medication history rendering results vulnerable selection bias. Third, VEA BAL fluids reported qualitative fashion (positive level detection negative under); however, without median toxicological dose median lethal exposure time, inferential value intra-alveolar VEA yet determined. Finally, analysis performed isotope dilution mass spectrometry gas chromatography, however reference internal standards used. Without appropriate internal standards, VEA might mistaken endogenous alveolar vitamin E (VE) due possible redox interconversion isomers.25 important lipoid component surfactant. previous prospective intensive care unit (ICU)-based clinical study reported elevated levels BAL samples patients acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and/or acute lung injury (ALI) compared healthy controls.26 Similar findings reported comparing consecutive BAL samples ventilated patients ARDS: worsening clinical symptoms associated increasing intra-alveolar levels.27 papers concluded elevated alveolar levels might seen part body’s defence mechanism ARDS.

The list priority toxicants set CDC without explaining rationale. presumed aetiological role VEA surprising numerous reasons. Prior EVALI, reports VEA toxicity (or biologically active derivatives like VE). 57 years career food cosmetic industry, VEA considered safe additive multitude products little adverse event reports context either respiratory conditions constitutional/gastroenterological symptoms. VEA converted biological active hydrolysis various human tissues, conversion accelerated oily vehicles like vegetable oil. oral/transdermal bioavailability VEA 1: 1.36–2.28 best knowledge, intrapulmonary bioavailability studied. However, numerous animal human studies investigating various isomers different respiratory inflammatory conditions administered either via oral/parenteral route direct intrapulmonary fashion (nebulised/earosoled). significant benefit demonstrated, importantly harm either.29” guys realize everyone's applying emergency use right? mean Pfizer also applying [emergency vaccines take multiple years develop reason, vaccine see within month going miss certain demographic (children, pregnant) qualify emergency use.

Given arrogance allows stupid, deserve going happen them. I'm fully aware regulatory process is.

In case quite literally insane. willing kill quarter million million people honor bureaucratic process? vaccine kills fewer people virus going to, released. Without bureaucratic gatekeeping strokes ego government overlords.

I get sense emphasizing long-term nature availability vaccine counter idea take precautions vaccine going save us all.

The place I've heard idea Reddit. course letting guard engaging risky activities vaccine actually delivered illogical.  It’s deter people going store crowded spaces.

You still purchase online / pick-up / call-in non-essentials. count Nobel prize worthy, creating functional vaccine virus within year emergence, entirely new approach vaccines (mRNA), potentially provide platform dozens vaccines come.

Getting vaccine within next 6-9 months logistical achievement par second world war. Perfectly explained. Exhale entire time inhale mask back on. tested negative November - took first test 1 day symptoms started, 4 days symptoms 1 week symptoms. tested positive March, 1 test, 3 days symptoms started. like people speed drive intoxicated less likely car accidents harm others!

Sadly people need constantly reminded that, yes water wet, dropped things fall down, basics reality. 


Some still choose publicly reject personal political reasons detriment everyone around them. actually quite wrong. going easy, indeed fast. We'll seeing 50 Million Americans getting jab monthly February. need 150-170 Million stop thing dead tracks. “These findings simply document epidemic China detected time,” Giovanni Apolone, scientific director National Cancer Institute (INT) co-author study, told news conference Milan.

The study also sparked doubts among Western scientists called tests.

Much scepticism focused so-called specificity antibody tests, that, perfect, might reveal presence antibodies diseases.

Emanuele Montomoli, co-author study professor preventive medicine University Siena, defended accuracy research, saying tests identified antibodies targeting part spike protein called receptor binding domain (RBD), specific new coronavirus.

“Subsequently serum samples also tested four different types coronavirus circulating time Europe USA cross reactions,” scientist told news conference.

Some scientists also questioned could high percentage samples COVID-19 antibodies virus detected 2.5% Italian population National Institute Statistics (Istat) last spring.

Another author study said two sets data comparable.

“Our study suggest 11% Italians COVID antibodies September-October,” said Gabriella Sozzi, Director Genomics Cancer INT.

“These 959 healthy volunteers, heavy smokers ex-smokers 55 65 years old, mostly males, representative sample Italians,” added. I've got n95 respirator HD. Looks like SOMEBODY CALL 911! Now...apply climate change realize pandemic preview towards heading global society.  Hey, man campaign lose. even worse staffing issues. 

In Northeast hospitals lose average $70,000 COVID patient treat ones insurance someone without insurance hundreds thousands dollars. box procedure masks used cost hospital $10 per box around $60. Pretty much PPE prices shot 500% 1000% supply reorders used turn around one week 1,2,3 months. 

Many hospitals close declare bankruptcy. occurring part country relatively wealthy access state funding. can't imagine bad going hospitals Trumpland Darwinian approach medical care local state government thinks pandemic 'fake news'. Fauci going speak task force briefing. That's surprising voted Biden. Sorry shatter righteous worldview. Exactly. I've learned lower expectations, lot..... much less disappointing. Ok I'm kind confused maybe read right. test negative 3 times? tested positive March whole family, tested positive whole family November? I'm confused testing negative part doctor told antibodies.  clarify? shocked disappointed can't pull map US (or countries) see heatmap plot trend data every water treatment facility country.

Or places like Vegas collecting reporting data every casino building

These tests would seem far reliable (and leading) indicator viral spread testing/case metrics aggregated reported various Covid visualization portals. Restrictions work? Gee whiz, would known??

Actually Austin housing shortage well. Part issue tearing homes building apartments. I’ve lived Texas whole life idea I’ll able afford home one day. Considering Vaccines effective could ever hoped, think silver bullet, sure vaccine like 60% effective, probably wont end pandemic, vaccine 95% efficacy rate, 94% efficacy rate people definitely defeat pandemic. r/angryupvote Well one politicians recently said lightest lockdown europe. kinda problem, mean staying around 18,500 cases daily (on 7 day average) since while. nice stopped exponentiell grow , still get numbers down.

Bill Melinda Gates foundation vaccinating people order kill them. know... leaving die diseases.... would less effective? wonder short-term jobs could arranged large numbers people things needed (or least useful). Something least give work weeks, especially require highly specialized skills need much training.

Example: tree planting (in southern states spring comes). Unfortunately guess would need lead-up time get enough saplings grown proper public land staked it.

Or hiring people city, highway, forest, beach cleanup? public housing school repairs upgrades, even simpler things like painting landscaping? clearing underbrush reduce fuel available future forest fires? Things like that.

Seems like could potentially lots things long government wants pay it. Plus society could get little bit back return. agree short-term lockdown. year long lockdown fast approaching something advocate for. lockdowns affected personally mind asking?

Ah...no. ever second coming, Jesus could go devout part US Bible Belt preach *exactly* preached 2000-ish years ago, would set upon guns pitchforks so-called Christians. There’s another correlation there; southern states imposed new restrictions yet (Fl, Al, Ga example), relatively lower rates cases still fairly warm, “windows open” weather. People actually spending time outside July cases skyrocketed. We’re likely still eating outside restaurants; and, one data point, think common now, stopped dad’s house yesterday, windows doors open spent time outside talking. states, restrictive restrictive, taken new cases weather got cold. hope too, let's save lives!! people learn pain Jesus Christ. 
The audacity. --I'm familiar outside world--
I'm pretty sure given wrote.

I well aware difference ""many"" ""most"" used appropriately context point. Though questionable do.

But, basic information you. Many less half. means half. So, posting awesome facts, proved point. Thanks. Small bright spot places real restrictions support without it. Sending health care workers, taking hospital patients, etc. Sadly there's lot slack system. Actually really compared developed countries... Like even cities seriously dirtiest places I've ever visited... 

And yes, article right here. cases ""confirmed"" sequenced sequences sufficiently different infections. Feel that. dad passed away last year. going drive go see mom I'm Hotspot still working good idea.. Shit stress city! Keep head up!  still bit disconnect science here, idea spread largely airborne first glance, appears incompatible idea loose mask prevent spread. pretty natural assumption make virus would spread surfaces then. 
 
In reality probably going learn virus dangerous inhaled deeply respiratory tract, baffle created even loose masks create enough turbulence mitigate this. would also explain surface transmission seems rare - can't really inhale something stuck hand. 
 
I still think keeping surfaces clean generally good idea, though spread via droplets, also probably spread via dust. good way convince low-risk people get vaccine putin anything this. Screams insecurity One day don’t think would want rednecks lol 
Even though secluded Waiting vaccine might viable solution US, however, due logistics EU. highly doubt significant number vaccinated EU summer. rapture happening fast enough them!  playing months none died. know type puts words mouths try make points probably every day nobody said get it. could people infected told contact tracers supermarket instead really were..... 100% let shame right thing. would talk calmly matter factly possible. want listen that's them. control behavior. nearing big breakthrough flip situation head. Hang there. He’s active Covid denier almost exclusively posts r/Coronavirus 
Another sad pathetic snowflake. Agreed! It’s written super clearly read though preparations start even doses received. would least hope that’s case given countries start vaccinating year’s end! Even dying deathbeds idiot deplorables denying there's pandemic. surrealistic. I'm sorry go that! think us following recommendations along growing weary either never follow decided they're ""over it"" bother anymore. matter giving up. see people proud following recommendations, time, gets really frustrating. father law; Trump supporting anti-masker, COMPLETELY downplayed severity virus mind, may come virus. thinks fever lost sense taste.

What try get quarantine keep us safe, house prevent us getting based possible pre-exposure? think mental health valid reason open bubble little get social interaction, excuse going bars indoor dining. Feast Time Plague That’s good :(. Someone know Arkansas told schools open since many kids live rural areas without good Internet service. wonder true reasoning it’s excuse. Awww someone back make rebel comments deny Covid. delete gets called shit. You’re pathetic, get new hobby loser. not. supposed get funding this? Without federal aid hands tied large extent, mention try independently federal government would actively work them, seen states. Maybe read first post subthread. re-infections. Thus, amazed blase people this. said, people get cars everyday.  rural red hats tried impeach Dem governor last time imposed restrictions. strange country law enforcement selectively choose laws enforce get fired and/or sued it. Give time, there's still 7 days til US Thanksgiving. agree. sadly pay long run, hospitals system lives lost :( Big family gatherings extensive travel surely wait. cannot believe someone told older parents 70 people house watch football cook dinner. 0 reason kind insanity imo. suppression strategies Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, S, Korea, China fit ""restrictions work"" logic? anything, think success stories show restrictions must strong swift.

Even outside countries, slowing infections (prolonging unavoidable, state) worthwhile simply know treatments, vaccines, risk factors etc. time progresses. Even can't eliminate now, slowing infection improve outcomes get infected future. I'd rather get COVID March 2020. I'd rather get COVID March 2021 now.  Super majority infections south africa. Good job african union far superior continental response european union yep. appeal thing obviously driving - selfish nature. I'm sorry loss. Ah maybe true then. quote ""before get point distribution"" thought meant needed pause getting distributing it. see way well, occur simultaneously. 

Either way everything quoted article that's important! agree it’s extremely complex, hopefully correct authorities it. think important groups healthcare workers, need sick, followed elderly, ones mostly likely die thing. 

After gets complicated, prioritize next group essential healthcare workers, likely die elderly. Would wrong triage older obese people? obese 50 year old probably greater risk healthy 60 year old. 

There’s lot questions here, hopefully someone smarter myself. I'm freaking out. I'm angry. go way. works billionaires. Could week, enormous pressure. thing say data dump made come conclusion quickly easily. Like there’s short report, long report, data. read short long report one day. Yeah go data it’ll take forever FDA depending industry right thing.  Well can’t denied entry. Nothing dual citizens. That’s road wanna go :) saw delightful thread r/conservative last week proudly disputing following idea. good luck, Americans!

Edit: also suggestions here. We’re dilemma, still sure yet, would drive fly. talk like acceptable hundreds thousands die unnecessarily. Leaked? actual new surprise anybody?? Yeah, states currently no-win scenario, whereas federal government could easily help change that. thing states massively damaging side effects mandate masks otherwise implement less effective steps like curfews.

I can’t believe reporters, journalists don’t ask simple follow question. 

“Sir, mean get threshold vaccinated? think wear masks distance forever?”

Sometimes wonder governments ever think making decision New York deaths despite harsher lockdowns lower population. really effective dude ""doing research"" Iowa chance? Sounds like Reynolds rhetoric ""do right thing"", pretty surreal... 


Edit: saw state below, used live Utah definitely understand Yep thats nurse practitioners PAs continue grow dominate primary care. Theyre perfectly good primary care basic patient management. cheaper. Good, let’s put population higher risk factor right line fire. 👍 can’t believe fucking stupid US is. many going die MANY PEOPLE going gyms wearing masks distancing. I’ll never understand people cavalier. neo_whoa.gif I'm SAHM, husband remarks couple times month job stressful overwhelming (lead high school social studies teacher) handle do. tough job, never clock out!

They could avoided, fuckton less people would infected. 

You really want misunderstand that, you? least care people die lol. Trump dgaf. 4 million Pfizer also 2 million Moderna's no?

Considering Canada's population ~6 million 65+, hopefully least able protect vulnerable. Yeke. get breeding pairs elsewhere? False. Read again. Makes sense. guys watch Trump show? seriously believes power positive thinking. says go away, 100% thinks go away.

The guy total loon. Haha tempt me. Oh, surprise here. Let guess, Donald Trump also lone warrior fighting ""global elites"". What's new better yet, HELP? Haha locals think Canadians? I've always wondered surprised pikachu face never happen USA.  Finally. Hope Illinois same. Where’s Trump? Hi there, may benefit talking others r/Covid19positive may similar experience. I'd also suggest getting second opinion another doctor. shit sherlock 251,923 dead USA need national strategy. can't let poor decisions Oklahoma affect us around country. Anyone want explain Florida, lying? dense? locked down, cases started going down, got cases low enough level reduced load sustainable, places opened quickly. largely didn’t impose mask restrictions social distancing properly cases went back up. 

Florida 17,000 deaths 52,000 hospitalizations itself. It’s cases climbing rapidly right now. head sand doesn’t mean it’s happening. word ever. I’ll believe happens. I’m ready though. comment pretty interesting: example horseshoe theory, actually good point. Coworkers kid otw home many kids test results came back. people bus tested positive. sent home bunch covid positive kids mixed ones negative week Thanksgiving. like intentional. feel really bad coworker probably late 60s husband already heart problems ""We're nothing still working!"" That's vaccine studies blind... Lol. Sounds like yet another right wing conspiracy theory. related news Pope reported Catholic. Dude there’s much Canadians one point much Canadian license plates Florida license plate road lots home builders Canada capitalizing Florida 
Another hot spot told Canadians lot go western states fair, see Germany too. People don‘t follow recommendations act pissed behavior leads serious restrictions becoming necessary. making points, fool. repeating whatever picked safe space anti-lockdown subreddits people go totally miss point living society.

Cars made much, much safer originally, people comfortable getting using cars. We're currently one dangerous places we've ever ever regard COVID-19 infections. two totally different things.

You making genius points people understand something. dumb.

Edit: dumb, willfully ignorant, both. Florida heading peak season Americans accepted anywhere else world.  think one insulted saying I'm ""full shit"". Maybe bad English let express well phrase quote. trying say was:

I, unlike you, take account scientific publications, one think valid. really know insult.

By way, article 2007 mine 2016. obvious authors thought maybe time immunity could last 3-4 years. article shared proves immune cell response (in case) 12 years.
Extrapolating, safely assume articles published 2030 SARS-2 long lasting immunity much accurate ones published now, right?

If take papers conclusions literally, please let know article facts seems invalid you.

And please also let know ""scientific"" haven't. Could pay national debt taxing. Could seize bank accounts property churches show terrorist threat safety security USA  pull church pews build sleeping quarters homeless. Yorba Linda, Vatican city churches power square mile, would fix instantly homeless population issue. mean, look World Economic Forum listen Trudeau's speech last week. right plain sight (though recently deleted video world like 2030...which fucking terrifying...saying authoritarian communistic things like ""you'll nothing happy"").

Or keep sticking fingers ears remain happy sheep never talk unrealistic horror movies are. people act dumb end dead. Turns we’re country full people walking basement killer loose. That’s enough go back normal since likely means death rate minuscule Man many governors US ""De"" surname forfeit access ICU get sick. medical staff risk lives folks deliberately creating harm? cancelling theory don’t understand. rage see Gavin Newsom abiding guidelines go “sEe?!?? hE’S i?!??”.

So yeah. honestly believe anything negative church always will. lungs tip top, ask liver. believe study done relation mask wearing states numbers dropping. herd. live one populated areas North Carolina. 
We really strong mask compliance, etc. 

Although things seem slipping. Ladies gentlemen. got ‘em means author saying immunity +6 months likely. contradicting optimistic conclussions authors (totaly fine me), rather point view, that.

Their data show that. I've pointed decline cells seen data. seems like speculation me.

That's speculation. That's science. Homologous reinfection reinfection strain. cases counting reinfection sequence first second strain different (i.e. heterologous reinfection). often seen got original Wuhan strain early reinfected D614G strain. strains different enough confirm reinfection. However, even people strains minor mutations first second test, still call reinfections even though data suggests are. serious reinfections (that require hospitalization) much harder miss. 1 case death reinfection worldwide, safely assume another ones show doctors scientists would interested investigating those. 

We could missing thousands reinfections ultimately result deaths. mild first symptoms get tested got symptomatic disease. posted another comment, hospital wife (internal medicine doctor) works, seen one case reinfection far (mild case times).

Again, reinfection hard confirm. That's science it. confirmed sequencing. point PCRs. PCRs done outside sterile place (lab hospitals) easily contaminated show false positives.

PCR used confirm reinfection. was, we'd see hundreds thousands reinfections. Qatar study showed around 12% reinfection go PCR alone. Again, reinfection confirmed sequencing virus samples. people stored first sample (as often discarded) determine sequences different. topic number reinfection. healthy person really reinfected perpetually worse severity, little time infections (months) without body building kind protection constantly losing it? 

It happen coronaviruses. know people would think one different.  take back.. he'd tell everyone else inside move he'd handle things, go outside tell everyone fire, send fire department home lock door burning people started coming out. corpses start showing TV he'd claim media bias, declare anyone else would killed 10 times many people go back claiming fire building can't burn.   Zoomers going fine, especially track get college degree. fact think pandemic force many lower-income underprivileged rethink post-hs career plans. booming pre-covid economy many tempted skip getting 4yr degree pursue trades careers shipping/distribution, they're realizing white-collar knowledge jobs allow flexibility work home, even lockdown. sense many GenZ's going much career-oriented going forward, realizing need maximize investment college. Sounds good dude! Gonna mask head back work. Best luck you. 90% reddit example, countries statistics gender ICU, Norway seems 25.54% women ICU, death rate almost 50/50.

Of 30,768 cases reported Norway, 46.5% women. 201,055 cases reported Sweden, 53.8% women.

Of 305 deaths reported Norway, 47.5% women. 6340 deaths reported Sweden 45.4% women.

You shown lack gender bias Sweden, shown gender bias may exist Norway well... That's although nominal values higher, I'm least cautiously optimistic managing treatment better saving early on. goes far exceed hospital capacity large margin. matter. still bad whole anyway numbers big. missing making friends shit smh Thanks Gov. Lee president worships, still know people saying fake virus making effort careful. Cool, get line. tested negative?! MATTER!!!! still allowed mingle family friends. good little sheep keep locked inside ~~cell~~ house, that's told do!!! could fund certain billionaire's tax fraud shortfall. Cut out. That’s helping compliance. Doom gloom doesn’t work. surprising expect see change interventions within 5 days

5 days mask enforcement 11 days masking campaign study. go read comments time PCR test could increase 7-10, whole argument bogus

See literally told would liked masks work, evidence stacked them. 

""I would like earth round, EvIdEnCe StAcKeD ThEm."" Please cite sources, least talking proper interventions like isolating distancing.

If people cannot even wear masks, would ""proper interventions"" even implemented? people cannot even recycle, would reduce consumption pressure politicians make reasonable policies? like people stop talking interventions talking definition gave you.

Then, per ""your definition"" masks pushing population herd immunity virus control (immunity achieved) already, since percentage reduction would change sign value. definition contradicts claims. called ""efasting"" &amp; good conavirus news. Haha yeah bet. family owned condo PCB understand. love Florida lol I've sick 3 times since March ""Pastor"" French/Latin word ""shepherd"", metaphor pretty baked theology. Almost like religion desert nomads pretty heavily localized sheep-oriented subsistence lifestyle.... legal liability. catching COVID traced back recklessness, subject criminal and/or civil penalties, right? Yes, larger part men probably serious case virus. governor won’t issue mask mandate might lead vaccine mandate.

Edit: state also received 15 million pandemic assistance cares act governor spent nice chunk boosting tourism. population control supposed go Hawaii vacation start pandemic (didn't course) paid attention see strict quarantine regs incoming traveller regs I've seen.

They opened tourism recently believe bad luck, I'm reading avrious articles. Dengue COVID, makes sense compare two. 

PCR tests pick leftover viral RNA *months* infection. Testing positive PCR equate actual infection. Again, disinformation thread pretty frustrating. Yeah, fuck you, CDC. get decide whether choose travel see family. Evidently believe inadequate synonymous nonexistent.

People read poison think enlightened. Education failed US. Walmart doesn’t give shit employees. consolidated entry level management positions bumped pay slightly. accepting pay increase longer qualify bonus program. Everyone else gets paid absolute garbage. 

They haven’t even instituted $15 wage pandemic. give Bonus quarter equals $0.65 hour extra. employees making $12.50/hr.

Not mention fact walmart recording record profits lining pockets. It’s pathetic. Nice real. zero shame. evil. word thought could used grievously. Canada could also -only- received 4 million doses January April. Although better nothing, expect see changes restrictions doses available. And, yet, people get cars every day think twice it. Hence point.  Well either get winter cull ages hospital admins going get dragged homes. Either way, America become must watch television. think you’re misunderstanding me. taking nothing approach, I’m saying personal experience lot people solely focusing cleaning surfaces taking proper precautions. 

I literally employee described literally feel safer sanitizing work area transaction, time feelings diminish store isn’t things focusing proper air ventilation filtration. Management takes assumption sanitizing, employees fevers, etc creates extremely safe environment nothing else really needs change. It’s bare minimum approach. It’s store many places applying mindset “managing” covid. assume also drive cars. Also wear helmets everywhere go. Also cautious every flu season we've had. mean scared covid 19 might well scared every potential risk jn life. 

Most friends covid 19 couple coughs got better.  Uhhh remainder life? Okayyyyyyy infrastructure distrubution limited cold chain requirements. likely used extensively healthcare workers as, example, hospitals certain size likely correlated great degree known US Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS/PPS) hospitals necessary freezers infrastructures support it. beyond much difficult distribute freezers short ""out freezer"" time frames use limit extensive distribution within population would guess, particularly another effective vaccine much less stringent cold chain requirements. safety measures generally cut accidents cut impact car accident. said, car accidents ruin people's lives everyday too. highest infected regions USA proportion infected (current historic) still around 1/6. 

Theres awful lot potential hosts spread yet. People outside summer seems slow compared winter. Combine vaccines becoming available quantity warmer weather slowing virus think decent shot seeing significant decline summer 2021 possibly point actual leadership federal government get control. yet, paper right abstract ""Thus, SARS patients might susceptible reinfection years initial course unlike consider too.



Dude, interest non scientific insults pettiness. Stop projecting good day. know there’s different flu vaccine every year, correct? Amazing expect decades long term affect research one vaccine, problem taking one little trial testing.

Also, keep downvoting bud, hope makes feel truly better. feel sorry health care workers world. Quit, let die. deserve make money elsewhere. Lol what? That’s keep lungs safely jar. Everyone knows covid can’t get jars! media won’t tell ya that, ohh no. Agreed. Low census places.  MF’s talk much care wellbeing. Assholes governor requiring masks now, expect Dakota grab crown next week. governor exceptionally stupid. commonly, last words intubation (followed eventually death) “Because don’t want get sick. cold. want germs?” interesting normally perceived ""dirty Asian countries"" west lot better western response.
In particular USA perceived unsanitary some. I’m going speculate it’s around 250,000. Supposedly average occupancy hospitals United States typically falls 75% range. sake easy math. Let’s round million beds. 700-750k people hospitals non covid related ailments guess 200,000 (ish) covid hospitalizations would cause health system incredibly strained United Stares. Hospitalizations seem increasing 3-4,000 per day. current trend continues guess 30-40 days 200,000 covid hospitalizations, guesses lol Waiting months year seems selfish considering daily death toll. 

Yes, agree. going keep wearing mask social distance can, definitely care providing immediate family general public. Even theres .00001 chance could cause something, going wait feel safe. many posts / comments blaming Trump coronavirus, one comment criticizing Nancy Antoinette got removed almost immediately. Similarly, criticizing sub's lord savior, Dr. ~~Mengele~~ Fauci get removed  evidence infection passed formite contact spread 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

New York City (NYC) early epicenter COVID-19 pandemic United States.

**What added report?**

Approximately 203,000 cases laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported NYC first 3 months pandemic. crude fatality rate among confirmed cases 9.2% overall 32.1% among hospitalized patients. Incidence, hospitalization rates, mortality highest among Black/African American Hispanic/Latino persons, well living neighborhoods high poverty, aged ≥75 years, underlying medical conditions.

**What implications public health practice?**

Mitigating COVID-19 transmission among vulnerable groups high risk hospitalization death urgent priority. I’m Buffalo. considered New England. go orange tomorrow- nonessential businesses, schools indoor dining done. red. Either way, it’s right move 100% genocide. lmfao i'm ohio mayor said ""okay guys pretty please leave house unless want absolutely consequences do"" It’s going pretty shortage mobile morgues. many bodies going pile hospitals many people going stuck dead bodies homes.  Benefits long gone anyone summer, mention extra 600 ran july anyone still benefits getting 250-400 week states. *Insert, ""Nicolas Cage, Say"" meme.* meme, merely infosheet.  Check author brilliant job summarizing detailing data sources studies. specific one details Oxford vaccine. exciting AZ Oxford vaccine produces robust cell response. know, part immune system brings forth long term immunity? exciting 

Also, Derrick links studies articles. someone Says ‘there’s vaccine data’, show this. Cause wrong 

### Summary

**What already known topic?**

Although spread SARS-CoV-2 nursing homes well documented, relatively little reported COVID-19 among residents staff members U.S. assisted living facilities (ALFs).

**What added report?**

By October 15, 2020, 39 states available data, 22% ALFs reported one cases COVID-19 among residents staff members. Among ALF residents COVID-19, 21% died, compared 3% died among general population COVID-19.

**What implications public health practice?**

With ongoing community transmission, ALFs take actions prevent spread SARS-CoV-2 facilities, including rapid identification response residents staff members suspected confirmed COVID-19. Home Depot cut their's, lieu pay raise that's actually less money. Here'sto making smaller paycheck case rate skyrockets. vaccine. always refresh mine even took new ones traveling abroad. encourage people get vaccines. understand set restrictions like traveling plane countries ever - vaccinated. 

 
Masks actually make big difference already, think mandatory everybody.

But highly dislike people forced get vaccine specific matter cause literally data whatsoever vaccines created. way soon. Ohio least loose mask mandate, mostly started enforced big stores. hey, least something compared nothing, guess. Though many people happily ignore repercussions. still long time, hardest part going people get vaccinations, pulling trigger relaxing regulations recommendations. Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* simply analogy help people understand context numbers. 

H1N1: 60.8 Million infected, 12k dead
Covid: 11.5M infected, 250k dead (so far) 
Average stadium size: 70k 

It looks like Op's question removed said less ""why taking stronger actions covid versus H1N1""... understand difference 12k dead 250k dead thought analogy would helpful.  I've already got coworkers citing info evidence Biden horrible ruin economy. nothing like heatwaves 2018, much hotter longer. Talked parents comment turns respect decision think mandate dumb. bad, then! wish could say wife's family. . .

And agree, close! Vaccine can't come soon enough. number stock market scam websites advertised youtube one point infuriating. people made millions giving people investing advice likely lost people millions collectively ruined lives.

I suspect even ever jailed slap wrist. real issue need start punishing grifters severely guy baggie drugs addicted needs help. travel often.

Tell neighboring state live that’s far superior. not? That's happens car accidents. Firstly; coronaviruses mutate quickly Covid mutated significant way year. Secondly, immunity Covid seems last long time, immunity SARS lasted decade. Finally, either first two points false vaccine wouldn’t useful. So, lucky you’re misinformed. tiresome must live functional set cognitive skills.

Yep, state starting become ravaged, two closest hospitals icu beds available, coworkers pretending like nothing going on/aren't socially distancing/aren't wearing masks, workplace fucking Thanksgiving party scheduled next week I've got FB friends nurses nursing homes posting memes railing lockdowns saying live fear/should see families holidays.  Fml, literally feel like I'm Twilight Zone. It’s stupid question studied men, even mentions article. It’s short article looking specific population (which case women)  reacting coping spiking alcohol usage. never seen article looked specific age, gender, race, geographical region explore specificity? nothing wrong lol. saw article exploring middle-aged Americans coping virus, wow age represented article 😡 saw another talking men’s mental health pandemic, wow must care women. dare article exploring men’s mental health talk women. must mean never bothered look women all. Yeah IM asking REAL questions here🙄. See stupid sounds? people downvoting statement dumb normal person could use common sense answer OPs question sometimes articles look specific demographics doesn’t automatically mean demographic hasn’t studied it’s attack demographic lol.  concluding paragraph:

 Early pandemic, mid-March mid-May, COVID-19 incidence highest among residents large central large fringe metropolitan areas. Beginning mid-April, incidence large metropolitan (central fringe) areas declined increased similarly among urban-rural areas. September 2020, COVID-19 incidence sharply increased, remains highest among residents medium/small metropolitan areas micropolitan/noncore areas, indicating increased spread rural communities. October, weekly incidence increasing steadily among urban-rural areas. Viruses coated protein based capsid. Bacteria layer peptidoglycan lipid bilayer outside.

Soap kill microbes. think does, anti-microbial soap exist? anti-microbial soap added antibiotics. Evangelical Christianity, religion hate, racism, homophobia, stupidity disrespect Jesus Spread word, cough thy neighbor! Probably jobs Amazon fucking suck people quit 2 weeks, get fired meeting absurd rate. hospitals get overwhelmed start turning away patients.   

Every person requires hospitalization denied admittance, **WILL DIE**.  

Hospitalization rates 20% infected patients.   Since people get hospital care 20% die.  

However since flu circulating, getting one means Immune system compromised, you’ll probably get both.  Getting even hospital care almost sure death sentence.  actually could see death rates exceed 18%. 

BTW, Homeland Security defense department plan uncontrolled pandemics.

Government funded studies finally got people understand smoking kills. listened Phillip Morris..well damn,you'd man's man 100. 

The government figured huge hole Ozone layer causing it. made people stop using chemicals. result? Well, certainly saved us Skin cancer...and death. 

Why possible give government right amount power save lives pandemic? Covid Killed 75% people contracted it. Would reasonable citizens turn power exists FORCE others take seriously? difference make percentage much lower? still preventable deaths albeit fewer them. number hit? really believe even covid like Stephen Kings 'The Stand' 99% population died government supposed stand go ""Nope, y'all whatever feel like"" 

If ""The Stand"" flu broke South Dakota alone. Would governments bordering states right blockade shit S. Dakota let anyone out? so, they'd CRIMINALLY negligent protecting citizens sworn protect. 

Lastly. get it. must hate shit liberals. there's lot liberals conservatives taking seriously. wearing masks social distancing. ever considered hospitals society would like WEREN""T this? we'd million dead millions dying soon. 0.25% 340 million like 6 million people. reason even discussion people responsible. behaving like people defending things would much worse. actually don’t think sounds far off. We’re hovering around 160-180k cases per day, that’s mainly people symptoms/known exposure getting tested. ~20% people asymptomatic people mild symptoms don’t bother get tested think it’s allergies regular cold (or they’re denial COVID general), could put us pretty close 300k+.

How feel knowing comment wrong? required quarentine? Yes. 

Did actually it? No. 

They BBQ extended family day arrived back went church weekend. dont care. says shit like ""Our president trump see right Democrats covid hoax."" canadian, live canada, prime minister. like blind leading blind im from. still win ENATE god knows reason. done people? 

What farce  know disingenuous, actually curious done done:

- Mask mandate public places

- Public testing facilities

- Lockdown / stay-at-home orders April

- School closings

- Large events limited and/or banned

- Local restrictions curfews needed (eg, Houston El Paso)

More *always* done, look rationally, would likely extended lockdowns. That's it. Texas everything else. would take one jobs twenty years younger. sucks ""older worker"" getting laid off. Age thing bunch candidates. Sigh. ubderstood looking mid 2021? mean get they’re closing gyms going gym burns soooooo much calories anything could similar amount time home. way make progress either bulking cutting drop intake 20%. Imagine football stadium full people infected H1N1, 15 people die. Imagine football stadium full people infected covid, 1,500 people die.

Depends highly attending demographic.Maybe fill stadium 60+ old people get numbers.   Don’t know? nurses easily making 100k year working extortive industry U.S. absolute bare minimum time creating toxic work environment obviously know better everyone else. didn’t 4 years schooling told differently. hazard pay? work Bestbuy ended hazard pay months ago. raised pay, hired 100 people. cut everyone’s hours 1 2 days week. enough hours one get unemployment. work skeleton crews every department. People still come masks remove inside. employees taking cluster chat. wanna stay home it’s safe get live. asked would liked actually do, answered. Another nice thing would dismantle pandemic response team formed previous administrations thrown pandemic response playbook. 

Instead he's actively working discredit scientists instill distrust experts. yeah, I'm laying blame feet. Hah I'm sorry loss. sounds like amazing woman! rest us didn’t already know that.  dishonesty runs strong one. Yes. also notice started increasing ICU beds - Tuesday total capacity 585 beds, today 610 beds. guess increasing maintain 20% capacity, see next week.  true. Another thing add that's required herd immunity masks, packed bars stadiums, etc. keep masks social distancing around, Rt cut basically half. Even getting third America vaccinated would almost eliminate virus couple months current precautions. Protecting elderly makes alot sense. 
Unfortunately federal response / mandate early phases that. 
By time grandmother passed covid, 50% residents assisted living facility contracted virus. fucking say?😑 Like Chris Pratt Justin Bieber. really simple either direction. many complex factors play immunology. 

It may individual differences like genes, overall health, even circumstances individual's immune system state time exposure. 

Viruses also mechanisms evade immune system, factors fall virus' favor could still cause infection.

Shorter answer know, almost certainly 100% individuals 95% immunity 5% individuals 0% immunity.  covid. Millennials linger cutoff kids school going COVID, turning new phase someone pointed “Zoomers ”

Edit bullshit autocorrect Examples criminally negligent crimes **criminally negligent homicide** **negligent endangerment child**.

If quacks like duck, looks like duck, flies like duck. Odds Trump get off. Good, starting work. Hospital capacity already maxed areas. bed count, also doctors nurses. Nah, femme-coded labor looks like. We're expendable exploitable. thinking flying Thailand. know make 25 hours wearing mask eating. Sounds terrible. 14 days quarantine. figure? joy making fun struggle Swedish people strong you. makes feel better, give shit ANYONE dying now. Equal opportunity death! Definite genuine decline trust institutions, peddled truly: Donald (it is) Trump. season giving.  That. Already. Happened. You. Idiot.  Republicans believe virus serious hoax. Democrats believe Trump administration might involved sketchy product.( involved trials) Neither true. NPs practice independently states states need overseen doctor may need enter practice one available.. PAs always need underneath doctor.

But generally agree. think ultimate situation happen primary clinics like 2 doctors complicated patients 10 NP/PAs general management chronic diseases. confusing antibody testing antigen testing Somehow Mike Tyson King popped head see. Millions doctors around world see deadliest pandemic Century, go crazy eyebrowed, mad scientist looking guy. We're likely 80,000 people hospital covid-19. There's 950,000 bed US. We're creeping 10% beds used covid patients. right, April. old house built air handler. actually sort PITA time like $300/yr worth MERV-13 filters UV bulbs. always meant temporary fix. think *anyone* wanted lock country rest time? fucking serious? lmao Yoooo, went Garden City smelled bad. Nasty stuff. still eat meat though sad eat nearly much used to.  After? Yes, quite lot. It’s significant it’s happening young otherwise fit people covid, often mild cases. doctors nurses died, decided y'all stupid risk lives save -- ones left absolutely precious.  Treat respect. quite. past, construction projects abandoned farms went untended due outbreaks. Viruses decided battles war.

There may craters, there’s always going something missing. Heroes add list expedited vaccine process approval driven Trump's political plants..? really mystery here?  Summit News far-right conspiracy website. majority clearly much anything avoid groundbreaking! I'll tell mother law passed last week 22 others know hospital right drowning beds. 
This study now.

This letter earlier studies showing masks benefit even That's need quit posts. Nobody listening cries.

So nobody refused heed warnings get sick. Exactly! news? Dumb dumber Shitty way categorize someone working making living, first all. second all, high risk (like household is) infinitely grateful shop us we're unable make sure relay generous tip. deep. probably combination cooking books (though hard deaths) humidity/heat. know virus spreads less easily humid hot conditions. Florida winter though dry ne fall like temps Florida outbreak might delayed. test seems bit biased conducted restaurants/pubs/clubs/cinemas etc closed. need give celebrities early followers want take it. I'm saying celebrities first line. thing would good point celebrities saying guy gal months ago great. 

Considering various celebrities high risk see get sake. Yet people say celebrity. Lol Canada still allows flights US? Lol wtf point closing border then. Talk half assed. really helpful, thank you. Leave. That’s happening Geez...ya think? Tyson notorious handling animals long time too. surprising all. mentality completely ignores different people different coping mechanisms. despise yoga love gym, working lifting weights gets destressed anyone judge liking yoga. coming dude stays fit surfing, trekking, biking, outside activities I'm usually alone. That’s done really well! Thanks that! texas deaths lagged month lately number doubt go are, area entry room set aside pantry items need right away let sit like you. box, like cereal, i'll take bag toss box. wipe things well put ""quarantine shelf"" fridge safe (that's OCD talking tbh) Tbh staying home would alternative, since merely breathing infected enough spread Covid. Tbf, many 80s Scotland.... already have. honestly good point. worked guy said restrictions tyrannical since virus even killing 50% people infects. literally words stupidity. People politicizing pandemic. creating huge amount disinformation around vaccines. Anti-vaxxers also employing normal misinformation tactics online, too, adding noise. Honestly, shit needed called social media years ago.  he's strong Ts nABs, might quite safe. much help reduce cases flatten curve, yes. stay locked down, cases continue go down. open up, cases rise. goal lockdown prevent hospitals overwhelmed point deaths go people can’t receive adequate care. I’m sure point is. makes worse. Anti-vaxxers general probably unlikely support vaccine already established reasons. Others support rushed nature uncertainty effectiveness potential side effects. people may fall certain side political spectrum may oppose spite side, figurehead choose politicize vaccine bad thing. post fly safely. know reddit works, crossposted profile save you. economic inequality run rampant, unchecked. get worse gets better, housing crisis Los Angeles clear example it. Americans left behind still managing swim shutting things like NIMBYism. discipline could predicted this, maybe using statistical models evidence healthcare community. run high end liquor store - wages haven’t increased - we’ve open ready sell people bc “essential” - deal fucktards telling us don’t wear mask. 

I can’t wait get fuck outta shit. death rate likely lowered since April, cases certainly WAY reported April. * Operation Warp Speed tested thoroughly

* Actually never mind within hours emergency order!

Pick one. I'm willing get *has* thoroughly tested first thousand sacrifice lives science. definitely see words headstone. people dying today people tested positive 2-4 weeks ago, we’ll continue see uptick deaths research exponential growth free time. Even poorest countries basic infrastructure main cities (or city case small nations). extreme examples, would available capital, would still possible advantageous use even logistically challenging vaccines. Moderna one they're saying good fridge temperature (2-8 degrees) month, would certainly make possible roll even small cities poorest nations Earth. temperature, could even use thick polystyrene (styrofoam) container ice packs transported jeep running shitty roads 2-3 days mountainous areas get remote zones. probably necessary later vaccines okay ambient temperatures. mean what's gain freaking this. Yes, ugly situation, part stunting least slowing spread, control anyone else's actions. point. people way smarter field agree masks aren’t necessary. mean places comparing? There’s pretty significant difference Manhattan Mobile. 

Most ‘nice’ cities Europe pretty trashy areas get outside tourist centers, barring maybe netherlands guess. 

Also, fair way dead people normally used to. burn corpses everything shiny new again. say 😂😂😂😂😂😂 helps put extra pressure regulatory agencies approve it, there's that. Saying ""We already millions doses ready, FDA let us save lives"" would really bad PR. person appointed coordinate distributing vaccine four-star former commanding general US Army Materiel Command, left working 39 sounds like person knows logistics bit. They've planning months. Pfizer says they're shipping coolers dry ice hospitals pharmacies via FedEx Good god, realize trump supports like outside US. bad enough dealing people he's actually ""leader"", can't imagine cult member another country. Tell Modern Day Presidential activities Trump's administration. Oh well, think I'll go get Tom Hanks spit face now, that's I'M going do.....


#SARCASM people fatigue changed opinions? course, shitty masks increase risk transmission. probably meant risk relative actual mask. Great! I’ll let friends lost parents family members covid know! easy Pfizer decided rather needlessly share revenue, right... good one ;) “Heey guuuuuys” obvious. Hard measure country tested lot cases. MA: Numbers spiking? Let's absolutely nothing it! Cleaning surfaces certainly prevents dust accumulating, potentially kicked air marinading virus. think current climate political noise science created distrust vaccine. take Fauci says safe. They'll worse nothing, they'll keep pushing big deal embolden morons continue defy safety measures. Aw optimistic view future that’s refreshing! Sorry yes, speculating reinfection accounted for. could point article provides evidence this, would science. pointed article, proving reinfection challenging. journals want see two full virus sequences, first second illnesses, sufficiently different, says Paul Moss, hematologist University Birmingham. “The bar high,” Moss says. “In many cases, genetic material isn’t is, many labs don’t time money clinch case. result, number genetically proven reinfections orders magnitude lower suspected reinfections. Netherlands alone 50 cases, Brazil 95, Sweden 150, Mexico 285, Qatar least know example immunity SARS long lasting.

For cell immunity... cell immunity protective immunity. cells active, person (re)infected! cells work cells infected! neutralize virus outside cells. again, article demonstrates cell immunity SARS-CoV-2 detectable 18% patients 5 months. 36% detectable CD8 memory cells (these ones actually kill infected cells) 5 months. SARS-CoV SARS-CoV-2 virus. immune response different immune response much similar seasonal coronavirus SARS-CoV. IFR alone tell that. understand basic arithmetic. masks * distancing = winning. 

Two negatives always equal positive. Cleveland Clinic enough justification self-righteous ass? plan already motion “anecdotal warriors” force telling us isn’t possible.

Yes, retirees, safe home, going back help others; totally ridiculous assertion. go away. Tbh know mink fur even thing, last mink fur coat saw 1980's movie. forgot /s unfortunately, people actually mindset due lack education. worth considering first people infected given wave also likely spread virus; factors make someone vulnerable infection (lifestyle, behaviour, housing, job) factors allow someone spread more.

The virus might infect small number infected hosts, could also infected ""best"" hosts (from virus' point view)

That's say European lockdowns working. worth thinking whether virus-spreading simple people assume is. might spread rapidly sections population can't socially distance (or choose to) naturally slow kinds hosts run out. Even issue mandate, people won’t follow won’t enforced. support group thread us covid vaccine clinical trials? suspect people frequent bars inclined take vaccine

What..?

Why would someone frequent bars inclined take vaccine? like pint time time anti science. government failed, outside work, leisure time spent gathering people engaging risky behavior fucking up.

I’ve lucky enough keep working. workplace, idiots don’t wear masks correctly, all, 8 months this. think people dumb weak. can’t wear mask nose see people 80s it? 

So everyone criticizing others working home. recognize federal government’s failure personal failure public. thing said Amazon Apple stock growth periods. That's gathered. feels akin ""Republican senator admits Biden election"". Welcome America  Thanks! Although, live Idaho really issues deer overpopulation states have. Plus side, elk elk delicious. Scottish friend mine told cows Scotland people knowingly, willingly get car, plane, speedboat, motorbike. don’t get choice getting infected. freaking mean we're seeing happening US. So, I’m curious “doing much” consisted last 10 months? agree principle want another event magnitude, tbf think it'd possible mRNA vaccine go way Cutter did. problem Cutter live virus somehow present dangerous amounts, think mRNA risk problem. No, didn’t. 

Reading comprehension key here. 

Reread again. self-hating American, rabid American hater elsewhere?  Trump stop people voting stop people getting Covid.  Story checks out. astounding. lot people would rather multiple, long, ludicrously expensive economically destructive lock downs wear face mask go outside. words describe level stupid, immature, reckless, pointless insanity. Lol. Michigan went remote classes, decided _raise_ tuition. AKA embrace Zoom suck feast! I'd surprised people even want get vaccines tbh applicable workers trying make ends meet. everyone opinion make opinions valid.

You’re wrong. People sick pandemic going lash people STILL stupid prolonging pain. Stop wrong people nice. idea. want fuck out. care containing spread virus. stupid sure, also recieving quality care would non starter Hospitals stop accepting patients state people refuse wear mask stay home. Maybe easier scale manufacturing, get eggs definitely easier transport distribute. Things consider 1.4 billions vaccinate. I'm familiar outside world, cupcake. seem understand difference words ""many"" ""most,"" maybe get Reddit take look dictionary?

Yes, ""many"" people disobey rules road, drink drive, insurance, etc. that's far cry ""most.""

Over 200,000,000 vehicles road US insured. around 275,000,000 vehicles road US, total, that's vehicles road insured (and good number uninsured vehicles likely antiques, require insurance).

In 2014 approximately 111,000,000 vehicle trips driver much drink, per CDC. seems like lot, per Bureau Transportation Statistics 411,000,000,000 vehicle trips taken per year. around 0.25% trips drunk drivers. That's...far ""most.""

Around 90% people wear seatbelts, per National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Finally, hard find good information re: drivers following rules road, study Colorado University researcher Wesley Marshall found around 9% drivers commit moving infractions.

So: full it. can't defend statements keep throwing general assertions wall, despite claims utter bullshit, they're sticking. Go back safe space lockdown skeptics whatever enjoy mutually reinforcing ignorance. That's catchphrase - meaning either Covid beginning world destroyed (if tinfoil hatter), Covid great time increase activism issue [X] already activist issue [X] pandemic. catchphrase already used recent financial crises, etc. always keep peanut oil frying, olive oil fresh food dressing hot food (it lower smoke point), avocado oven light stir frys (highest smoke point). Flavor wise worth assortment! church basically lets buy way sin. racket got going on. Currently battling you. Unfortunately make without getting Covid. almost did. vaccine India betting since it'll produced country. can't buy pfizer vaccine due lack cold chain infrastructure mostly we're poor country vaccinate 1 billion people probably need cheapest one market words, there’s guarantee immunity defend virus. Even one feels confident Lord protect answered him, ""It also written: 'Do put Lord God test.'""  4:7

It's basic knowledge personal responsibility still duty. Everyone dog heard homily devout Christian died flood declining help. Glad found something better fitting needs! Patient care money. Money follows good medicine ethics before.  lmao love triggered commenting posts. Newsflash, harassment, attempted otherwise. wanted harass you, would lot worse. overwhelming majority information covid hasn’t peer reviewed. opposed shared info don’t like? 

Yes, I'm misinformation spread pandemic. Thanks asking. opinion “west” east influential preventing spread virus?

lmao numbers enough you, huh? Okay, let's look China early on: written Beijing municipal government offered practical tips protect oneself coronavirus. eight days since city Wuhan gone full lockdown seven since Beijing cities across China declared public health emergency. flyers advised government websites social media accounts latest, authoritative information take basic precautions (wear face mask, stay home possible), listed one hundred hospitals greater Beijing designated handle fevers. case anything unclear, authorities set new hotline information eight foreign languages. Unlike Wuhan, Beijing wasn’t locked down, making sure everyone well manager diligent. checked neighbors, confirming information left town Chinese New Year holiday, asked mask. minutes cheerfully left carry thought effort went flyer especially impressive hindsight: organizing hospitals hotline, quick consensus measures like face masks many countries, United States, grudgingly adopted much later. dipshit like Trump making virus political issue actually cared stopping it. really hard understand see want convince people virus contagious way take blame away man simp for. pray orange dumpy lord savior send us paper towels combat hoax 🙏🍊 Bingo. Cases went like clockwork around 2 weeks implementing restrictions, matter many total cases country begin phase current outbreak in. It‘s obviously effect restrictions, working late recommendation lol think Americans proven happening US soil. Skype Given I've hearing peoples' plans next week, good idea get requests early. think offer realistic advice insist dining together.

Try find largest airy space possible 

Try fans blow air room

Try switch earlier meal open windows house let fresh air in

Try part gathering outside set heaters outside people gather possible 

Open windows air space Run hepa air filters hosting event. 

Move room different rooms possible moving dining room living room family room dessert allow saturation levels room lower 

Seat people far apart possible 

Isn’t much ... improvements severity numbers still meaningful - 

if level infection folks get even bit less better anyway. rent small rv!  Either one really drawn tantrum CDC's latest recommendation, American people finally got heads asses collectively stemmed growing tide COVID. disease disappeared almost overnight, Christmastime filled joyful reunions, many people seen closest friends family better part year. January 1, 2021, ushered new era prosperity, word ""coronavirus"" disappeared, like melting snow spring. ferrets fair, way article written confusing. instance, quote: 
“Asked spread might happened, Vasan said given human mink F-variants samples collected Denmark June, might “movement people, animals goods could spread F-variant countries”.”

What true variant Denmark concerned lessening antibody efficacy “extict” according them. article seems suggest mink-strains transmitted elsewhere. Right? Holy reactionary, Batman. could get thing person already opposed to.

Happy introduced though. long come church drop donation check. Religion biggest ponzi scheme history world. produced Belgium too.  haven’t seen [cases state partisanship fast forward October realize fast scale increasing. mean, seen president? news, water wet Horror documentaries like Friday 13th are. Absolutely. close relatives minks use research sars influenza since respiratory systems similar humans. Yup. thing Georgia. know people boycotting mall Santas year require face masks Santa wears shield. It’s “magical”, say.  move closer Americans would without major news sources sharing misinformation suggesting snort bleach efforts? Deep breaths, pray away y'all Daughtery family awful people. mean tried cover rape minor several years ago, reporting police parents victim “in house investigation”.

They also held concert couple nights ago, masks, social distancing. tbf pandemic without people like mentality thanks can’t grasp people don’t believe real virus. breaks brain. Organized religion goddamn pox humanity  super happy heard Biden creating covid task force realized low bar set, getting medical professionals together discuss things enough get excited. day one shit are. problem come back it’s “oh shit covid 5x bad last checked.”

This hard year efasting. zero social interaction all. Turns I’ll take arguments insults anger fear (nothing all). say, broken. year broken me. That’s Spain doesn’t near type different mixtures population Latin America 

And Spain diet Latin America 

Spain also near violent Latin America 

If I’m mistaken Latin America conservative religious Spain they'll sending tens millions doses most. head Operation Warp Speed projects we'll enough doses everyone US June 2021 (if vaccines follow Pfizer Moderna passing Phase 3 trials).

We underfunded vaccine manufacturing reward. ""normal"" price $20/dose never going cover costs all-out production advance positive Phase 3 result. I'm 100% convinced subset Boomers spent long trying convince they're getting old genuinely understand they, fact, are. NFL style testing isn’t available non employees nfl I'm glad know covid 19 nothing flu young healthy people. /s used friends example, widely known covid 19 barely affects young healthy people. It’s true lol. go reason wear mask! problem “not living fear” population won’t give shit normalization sicknesses probably still spread. I.E. don’t know much difference it’ll make long run.  I’ve really pondered much worse places. stupid masks etc bad. Public transportation explanation think of. Ffs. lower death toll UK, Belgium, Spain, Italy. wrong acknowledge COVID proliferating nearly every developed country? like 9 months. also runoff become elected official right now... Let highly infectious, deadly, virus run loose simply symptoms *seem* milder? Yeah, go visit Uncle Gary infected. gives shit one working lung left, least symptoms milder fucking croaks it.  literally plot entire South Park season... That's guess. Lol  could theoretically live time share Arizona... world come screaming back life? god delusional lol USA break 2k deaths/day today.


Pretty shitty knowing we've before, everyone numb seems. Nobody freaking out. Nobody rushing get stuff. Leadership MIA. feels weird. going feel weird reach unimaginable levels upcoming holidays, we're already point. 😔 don’t understand well, barely mentioned article read. described problem people carry infectious. don’t think so?

Maybe long term damage same? Maybe death rate same? Maybe symptoms seem milder start milder progress strains?

Regardless id rather eliminate it... Contact tracing nothing hotel quarantine, finding 17 cases day reported case indicate well. people still talking Covid? Driving grocery store dangerous. Nope.

This estimation many infected *right now*. possible 30 million affected entire course pandemic. CEO sold 60% stock....alrighty then😳 people didn’t want believe it. many families, can’t send kids school, can’t go work. work, money=all sorts problems Good riddance. unfortunately fear massive campaign eradicate COVID even enough people vaccinated turn hospitalizations deaths background noise. Mandatory vaccinations dystopian shit around corner. Can’t wait infographs vaccine comparisons, pros cons etc.

On another take, I’m kinda afraid ask one vaccines applied intravenously what, mean delivery method! You’re right! misread. would assume death distributions normal, spikes would probably caused reporting data like commenter said, actually real time death. None. I'm expecting normalcy then, that's way early. NJ shutdown non-essential things? getting REALLY bad here. real time data words GOV. Murphy help. Maybe something right thanksgiving? hate tell you, long way off. want get per capita title, going work lot harder! Probably we're still mid covid raining.

I'm warning rain get wet.

You're blaming rain.

Not exactly act genius part.  

That might make feel better second, actually going good. Yelling help you. Wise up.

There couples families end infecting other. die. That's reality. Getting upset change that. eating part, skype Christmas like 2 hours last year. bad. week later discord new years. Talk doctor stuff. None us want responsible killing told exercise sick. Ha thank you. youtube/Instagram people make little sense me. long term goal transition lab bench business focused role biotech. Turns companies really interested scientists roles, I'm trying leverage MBA evidence would good fit this.  wish Ascertainment Bias options 5/10.  think missing many cases days (pending state) Breaking news: politician hypocrite.  mean winter. Even Fox news reporting much Fauci set disappointment.  Got trouble work cause called many times work. genuinely sick, pneumonia, returned boss told write said people come work they’re sick same. Fucking love corporate America study masks effectively protecting wearers (common knowledge) virus spread though.

Here's research assess whether recommending surgical mask use outside home reduces wearers' risk SARS-CoV-2 infection setting masks uncommon among recommended public health measures. Darkest hour dawn. heart news. Well depressing   US quarter million deaths.'

The number probably double.

Totally hilarious, know.  get any. Half Europe boat.

Even Americans think country crap American exceptionalists.  Yep, using vacation time. scenario actually Christmas, Thanksgiving- we're anything in-person next week. us taking separate camping trips stay isolated pass time. know why? worried all. said something possible fact was. Wyoming Sounds like partially lost sense taste smell, known symptom. think lost completely. hope get worse. Great don’t care politics, oppression minorities , freedom speech etc. Cool. I'll Thanksgiving family set-up backyard, weather permitting. Enjoy Zoomgiving everyone. Right, makes sense live NJ

Now believe virus there, believe many people died it, personally know single person even gotten virus. everyone else chill, i'm definitely freaking :/  flu.

Got it. guess voted . article says Wyoming averaged positivity rate 70% past seven days. hell? Hey guys! idea. Maybe stay home tonight?

And go door tomorrow? Maybe wear mask? Jim Jones - “drink Kool Aid”

South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem - “Don’t wear mask” Sine Wave... Florida 20th cases per million.  14th deaths per million. 25th tests per million. indicates there's lot cases tested state. 

And Florida surging.  can’t beat it, join it. Tiddy bars still open Texas. Havent gone one obvious reasons dont know looks like exactly lol first school shooting, significantly restricted guns. still pro gun culture, done specific ways. 

They deify founders like do, trying appeal ancient authority agreed anything democracy liberal order better authoritarianism. eligible tested positive SARS-CoV-2 random polymerase chain reaction swab (n=62), positive antibody test (n=63), typical symptoms determined covid-19 two independent clinicians (n=73).

So 1/3 study didnt DEFINITIVE positive test.

Also take fact, let’s see peer reviews.

Just like blame middle Eastern culture radicalization small sect followers. Per 100,000 - Belgium: 1,278 deaths, Spain - 899, UK - 783, Italy - 781, USA - 772.

United States hasn’t handled COVID well, let’s pretend response uniquely bad. yeah frustrating Random Controlled Trial either. one group getting treatment one getting placebo. comparison two types behaviors. 

I'm saying worthwhile information, say much know, infected, masks provide little protection, infected, wearing mask reduce ability infect others. 

And since know infected isn't, best guidance give EVERYONE wear masks one part multi-layered public health mitigation strategy, along social distancing avoiding gatherings. 

Protecting public health protecting individual health. infection rate reduced 50% effective mitigation, public health win, even though people still getting infected, loss individuals. one invited dear friends funeral Covidl, say invitation bestowed special honor. counting “white” counties? No. implying ""how handle pandemic make pragmatic decisions wuss"".

As extreme individualism, Western nations nowhere near bad America. Australia is. know things look awful please make drastic decisions April. think world going look like different optimistic place end April would real shame see it.

Although I've never pandemic I've wars recessions drastic upheavals. imagine end Covid going bit like end iron curtain, suddenly world seemed packed opportunities optimism. please, stick around see yourself.  There's understanding race runs surface lot white people. helpful understand race far important US everywhere else, ethnicity usual classifier elsewhere. break down: thing race *racialized* groups people. Lots white Americans super proud interested specific ethnic origin, eg Irish Italian, think every Spanish-speaking person Hispanic Latino rather Argentinian, Mestizo, Cuban, etc. lot even realize this, blind spot.

The way race gets used advance white hegemony is...gross. ever noticed: child one white parent one black parent *can* call straight black without pushback cannot call straight white without pushback?

I swear, like night day depending HEB shop restaurant get take from. Worldometers showing 1,956 US deaths today. That's number seen since early May.

Looks like death wave catching case wave. that's case, moving average within week. see paywall  Nah, ridiculous. 700,000,000 infections? Well guess owned us libs always wear mask whenever go out, forgot bring one, turn around back home get mask on, also voluntarily joined vaccine trial program fortunately there’s one bio pharmacy city make vaccine covidisiac joining china, france, germany. got paid around $200 every time call voluntarily vaccine testing. shot 3 times, far good, side effect particular, sadly one friend got covid joining vaccine program. Vaccine cure ICU magically (it's even approved begin with). Even assume everyone get vaccinated 24 hours (somehow), would still see people die US COVID related issues. Let's see much 24 hours make difference. cleared FDA scheduled released Inauguration..it's evil pition kill you.
If released day Inauguration, Biden breaks Obama's record shortest time POTUS gets Nobel Peace Prize. Exactly right! People accepting things days. go flow government media tells to. course won’t; control hold individual student against. Nobody certain “ideal” one student would hit certain benchmark either, especially young age data points.

Many catch up. equally well. not. never would have. 

I’m suggesting sample mean by-and-large recover, effect stronger factors quality distance ed, parental support, supplemental activities, things.

Some students failing distance model lack personal effort, lack support parents, parents see meaningless (on top dangerous attitudes COVID), teachers see stop-gap busywork, technical factors could mitigated districts embraced distance Ed instead pinning hope (dangerous) reopenings half-assing distance—or trying ineffectually reproduce normal day digitally, rather leverage benefits mode. sites set ridiculously low academically inadequate goals distance plan.

In general many students whose performance target lower grades whose performance higher grades targets. development, personal goals, parental intervention, extraordinary effort motivated talented instructors, etc. all, unless repairman come reason. Never family dog. It’s even negativity, it’s fucking realism.

Turns sometimes reality *is* negative, “just flu” pussies can’t handle that. reason western culture (that island).

Per capita lots European countries worse. 

Italy France equipment 170k new cases almost 3k deaths. far worse us. What, believe people got COVID month first detected US?  yet still flu vaccine 15 years. Thanksgiving going fuck entire state. us family part state, especially college kids. Mixing DFW Houston families Austin El Paso families close quarters couple days sending everyone back parts came gonna huge shitshow. Probably people can't afford lower seats upper seats hidden enormous jumbotron. would guess.  That’s called stupidity. Apolitically speaking, ever cannot refute deny facts masses dying around us. Everyone knows someone someone social circles affected. It’s everywhere. stupid shall deny what’s front them. sad..

*checks*

Lol, Italian criticising Australia’s covid response.  might spreading covid two weeks show symptoms. might get symptoms still spreading it. Mental health important covid health. Maybe isn’t apparent sub coronavirus it’s true. one tells parents can’t see other. one. value vague “community” flesh blood? It’s unnatural impose that. mom friend Austin; entire family visiting thanksgiving it’s also 90th birthday. Six sons, wives, grandkids. Good luck, guess. It’s bit foolish say cases started come 2nd coldest month hard hard lockdown...weather definitely played role ignore deliberately disingenuous.

I may start taking advantage years senior shopping thing morning. least I'll know store potentially hundreds infected people breathing hours hours walk in. think bit speed.

Asymptomatic spread enough vaccinate couple hospitals full staff though, right? biggest fear hospitals crashing everyone sick work. Thanks! Would cool regular wrong thread. point seasonality still helps making growth less explosive. similar outbreak Melbourne summer would probably contained much easily. Yes!

You haven’t shared bed table partner since started? song Obviously didn’t read article Never going back normal? Mandatory vaccine? Neither reality least US Apologies, intent. think med alert bracelets good thing. I'm also fan commemorating surviving hardship ""ink"". State Michigan also...  Montanoming

Wyomontana clarification!

Happy oblige, glad could clarify understanding.

I also shared another link goes *far* in-depth ""the common cold"" could regurgitate memory/knowledge. Hopefully helps, well.

As ""simple"" humans, tend label things ""generically"" things complex understand without more-specifoc ""advanced"" knowledge. That's **common** cold, virus... even crazier things, like cancer (which seems bazillion types sub-types), even everyday objects, large generic extent (eg. Phones tablets become ""accepted generics"").

Apologies, certain word etymologies also find fascinating ... like brand names (eg. Aspirin, Tylenol, Motrin, Coke, etc) have, time, evolved common use words. brand owner, that's blessing curse, lose brand recognition gaining overall acceptance ... often at-odds one another. interesting language evolves...

Anyway... iz full time short term job thinking... Okay cool happened happened while. lockdown relief counterproductive. Irony lost ain't it? way . Hopefully everyone get access vaccine time 1% first. Exactly, lockdown, season. Well I've always followed guidelines voted Biden. think would get bad people saying. Fucking Dan Patrick. scourge state decades now. would ever use vaccine needs stored crazy low temps, Moderna's vaccine effective rate stored existing freezers. ""World class contact tracing"" failed properly quarantine international arrivals TWICE? baffles Australia still touted model. Yes, also aware spreading regular cold/flu get future since covid costing chance reelection

Sadly, already people side aisle calling General Assembly impeach reconvene January. saying, I'd pretty pissed developed narcolepsy something pressured society.  may well right, lies continue propagate repetition, truth. say keep repeating truth eventually effective. It’s mutually exclusive. I’m stating unnecessary increase due big gatherings like protests/rallies vs didn’t happen maybe lower pitchforks. downvotes suggest otherwise, unfortunately else? China? USSR? Burkina Faso? 

The US best partner EU find. literally 100% positive rate would still 10,000 cases tested 10,000 people would say ""that's cute"" ignorant are. one calling facts scary lmao


It's easy minimize dehumanize deaths relative; guess 9/11 big deal ""small"" death toll right? /s

Yeah, I'm excited. must fun parties It’s different everyone. completely symptom free, others mild cold like symptoms, people cough others not. Yes, could one symptom covid positive. makes sense, sorta similar Terry Pratchett's boots analogy. poor money plan long term time. constant scramble short-term survival expense long-term rewards.

Let's focus developed world first haha, sort places running water air travel Yeah, obama always half white african me. everyone, including black people called black. like guys mom white, partially raised indonesia white grand parents raised him. guess fuck disabled severely mentally ill know poll determines many Americans think COVID fake, extrapolate data polls. Take ABCNews/Ipsos poll saying 81% concerned someone knew would contract COVID. leaves maximum 19% people believe real, significant portion people likely think real, perceive significant risk. charts reported deaths date death. somebody died October 1st death reported October 12th, graph show October 12th date.

You need look graph date death. example Arizona date death instead reported Firstly stereotype, sorry tired ongoing joke. would hypocritical? passed safety checks. Ford Pinto..lol Fantasist works fantasy world. Story 11. calling other. understand Maybe rich use good grammar? tiff workplace 1st hint potential mandatory vaccination came pipeline. least, one supervisors pointed mandatory medical stipulations requirements potential vaccine would fall line them. man unironically said ""my body, choice"". Privately people pointed choice may need work elsewhere.

It's anecdote, theory private sector drive vaccinations. think bosses subtly tried ease us idea happens. Hi. think alot countries States come rapid testing pre-departure avoid quarantine future traveling? Yes, it’s embarrassing living mouth breather. Usher..... yeah man. back club, bodies rocking side side I’m legitimately curious open state doesn’t hospitals overwhelmed that’s goal us AstraZeneca one ,phase 3 using .9 percent saline placebo .. that’s made think got vaccine instead saline . paper said tired headaches two common side effects 24 hours injection headache slept day

In phase 1 2 UK used similar vaccine side effects similar. ""Voters"" people. guys people charge. Trump servant. point democracy. fear America forgetting moment.

You give half money every week return expect roads work, schools military defend you, dont like job fire ass.

Whoever leaked report like job middle manager doing, escalated big boss - guys. Lol tissue scars first never heal Atlantic (probably one pessimistic sources whole time) saying it, know happening. every hospital system well equipped Florida’s. Regardless state 17,000 people dead Covid. sound like success you? 

You’re intentionally obtuse see point arguing you’re convinced right despite fact nothing said makes sense whatsoever. Maybe going gathering thoughts prayers know, must ""protected"". Last time used words political discussion Germany 1938, yet, still many want again, thinly veiled behind masks caring elderly. Absolutely. I've people tell survival fittest right masks optional. That's America know. thought better that. parents got covid church past week gave grandpa. one rural church wore masks social distanced half congregation covid Easy say hindsight though it. reason covid19 ravaging world enough people enough first known about. Don’t think need leaked documents understand currant containment plan ain’t working hell. living hell wait see available area. might wait bit see least side effects (body aches etc) choice. idea need remove mask tsa. Glad applicable since I'm flying over, otherwise travel like John Madden That's tough one me. kind sounds like getting first celebrities, saying justification. President first instead? important job, widely known, etc. Accessibility care. Distance nearest hospital. belive plays large role mortality. AstraZeneca going ? I’m trial I’m pretty sure got vaccine though , curious get placebo want real one I’m much ethical I’m in-house longer litigating. 

That’s good point. I’m afraid someone slip guidelines superspreader take entire nursing home. Na, would probably say summer 2021, point vaccine widely available. Saying Thanksgiving February Christmas March stupid messaging. Read article. Share article people.

I imagine people read headlines (without reading articles) question they'd get vaccine nothing change...  Yup. I’m ER top list  awhile ago quite rural. police ever came. Fool once, fool twice, fool thrice donald, you??? sincerely wish you. Maybe, maybe not. evidence sort suggest hand mouth/nose/eyes may produce lower probability infection severe infection inhalation.

I’ve quarantining already since mid-March preventative reasons family can’t afford risk catching it. probably leaked. Someone government wants put pressure someone else something Nah...just repeat:

""I inherited mess.""

This time true though. them? I'll take vaccine loved ones will. want risk themselves, that's them. Vaccine going safe, effective evidence points vaccine promoted immunity stronger last long time.

Fuck them, I'm going entertain gloom doom scenarios millisecond people extend me. It’s crazy cost whole collusion drs drug companies, insurance red tape bullshit . Thanks check goodex.com spread word I've nurse little 4 years disagree ""we martyrs"" statement. many nurses embrace martyr syndrome brag it. ""I taken lunch break months!"" ""I even get chance pee today"" CONSTANT phrases thrown around nurses. fucking love acting like responsibility sacrifice patients. plenty us put health first, countless nurses love feel like they're special amazing take time pee shift.

I've noticed slight shift mentality year, though. slightly greater emphasis self care nurses given everything that's happening us. I'm really hoping pandemic ends martyr syndrome within nursing culture. Babies? Fundamentalists?  Christmas July sounds good long wait. depends study.

If drug shown highly effective, medical ethics suggests drug offered got placebo. Exactly, I'm sure rolled sooner. started schools, meat packing plants, etc. pharmacies now. lot people care virus, still plenty people care, taking calculated risks, would take OTC test taking said risks could easily get one cheap. assumption focus things accomplish things. 

They can’t modify hvac add ventilation beyond without massive costs. can’t enforce masks workers get shot (in US least). clean. It’s do.

Curbside pickup delivery way go imo. probably take little longer fully distribute stop new cases, things gradually start go back normal vaccine rolled out. light end tunnel. 60.8 million cases H1N1 affected USA April 12, 2009, April 10, 2010. national death toll reached 12,469.

We 11.5M confirmed Covid cases 250,000 deaths even year since first US case. Okay, going find them? Every health care facility near hiring. aren’t people correct schooling degrees hire. can’t get blood stone. Shocking. ever would've fucking guessed. Wyoming Alaska (populationwise) worse. people reinfected careless think they’re immune? don’t blame much, still seems ignorant since would seem reasonable presume even you’re immune still ability transmit virus others. 

At time it’s widespread there’s much do. yet catch it, employer Philadelphia seems think non-essential job essential enough keep leave house every day despite ban indoor gatherings size shutdown non-essential jobs, unless changes soon it’s matter time. Using loophole written restrictions mention office workers must work home unless unable instead saying unless essential like said press briefing announcing restrictions sure shows capitalism trump human life every time, note place work handle shutting month financially... KF94s way going start wearing. I'm also going start way less subtle distancing. care back whole office space. Well shit Sherlock



And goverment: “Bright” ideas professors? vaccine going everywhere wait mean production time retail companies within terms unionizing means losing job. vaccines. truck ready save lives starting soon FDA approves them. thing don’t know point long FDA take could theoretically EAU vaccines administered within 7 days. Yes. sounds like great idea area testing backlogged hard get people symptoms students want travel clogging system. Thousands students getting tested pretty much time... Well huge majority people reasonable, generally see reasonable people get downvoted oblivion, like sub Useless unless states follow course. Ireland (apart strict travel restrictions) still ended back lockdown countries also understand significance COVID's R0 dispersion requires backward contact tracing identify cluster first, standard forward contact tracing prevent member cluster starting cluster.  western world completely ignoring this. Completely. US, Europe elsewhere too.

COVID's transmission patterns substantially different flu, due R0 dispersion, use standard flu forward contact tracing procedures. yet many countries still this. So, purposefully trying kill many people now? Possibly way usher ""apocalypse"" ""prove"" people end here? Fucking ridiculous! Mitch McConnell obstructing economic relief? Better send back Senate 6 years! deserve get they’ve plays positioned best can. point panic reaction might actually benefits! true, irrelevant.

A simple mask much protect wearer. help decrease viral load, prevent catching entirely.

However, works well decreasing spread droplets. That’s true reason behind them.

So anyone complaining shouldn’t wear mask others clearly ignorant matter.

WEAR MASK! Regardless works great not. mitigation better none. Absolutes don’t exist life, politics.   recently discovered I'm scared large crowds now. went public place while, anxiety roof moment arrived moment left. that's fun. following leader straight cliff

And heads rest us. Compared wouldn’t take much processing power labeled genius really matter point there’s millions dual citizens sides border thousands cross day USA- land reports come telling everyone what's wrong, nobody anything They've working spreading stopping Tell families 300,000 dead troglodyte.  There’s “efforts?” Lol. win, genius. legally-enforced core value publicly traded companies make much money shareholders possible. take action may reduce value shareholders' stakes, CEO fired. publicly-traded company anything else. That's good point!  like anything else, unions become bloated corrupt. unions deserve opposed. happens strawmans become prevalent. Yep. closed christmas day. Half customers 'outraged' open Thanksgiving see customers shopping anyways

We considered essential cause accept ebt low income families rely p much everything carry Source leak reportedly common sense. It’s illegal outright ban interstate travel USA. It’s called ‘Freedom movement United States’ law. UK rules overrides US law?

It doesn’t matter countries do. laws can’t simply suspended halted pandemic. That’s pretty much USA territory UK. annoying part dodge grenades get thrown wherever go She’s locked - similar POTUS. time brains right thing. Here’s hoping. you’re dumb liberal? want say? Lol you’re jerking democracy people literally carted away auxiliary overflow morgues. Come back reality fool

MUH RIGHTS WAAAHHHH really. makes sense would reduced flu season since people wearing masks, washing hands often, keeping distant. seniors ones dying though. Vaccinating healthcare workers means stay healthy still go work overflowing hospitals. 

(In US) Giving vaccine first 85+ age group (total 13 doses needed assuming take it) covers 2% population 31% deaths far. Pfizer/Moderna say available US market would get group vaccinated end 2020 (assuming either vaccine approved use). yet safety measures car manufacturers must follow. Also, deliberately social distancing, many would go government say ""yes, I've flouting rules, give vaccine"". I'm sure corporate overlords happily cede reasonable demand diminsh power, remove illusion choice thrive on. Simple fix, stop reports. Problem solved. 🙄 simply think pay taxes, citizen deserve rights. Welp. It’s safe say see see quite clearly able articulate well. Let’s hope means something. sailing fine vessel... foul sea. NYC already lawsuits gyms bars backing Federal level needed ""You must  Drinking Gravy-Aid [Meanwhile, NYT reporting immunity may last years... it?

I like Sarah Lee bread, side effect pandemic learning make sourdough bread (like everyone else) stopped buying ago. Might need find local butcher meat guess, probably better anyways. started deploying soon knew safe

Who determined safe? Maybe I'm loop, seen agencies approve review data.

We want another Cutter incident reduce trust vaccines, lead even deaths became vegetarian pretty recently offended comment. something constructive end day, suggest absolutely constructive. Tax motherf***ers  don’t doubt virus spreads easily confined area airborne. don’t doubt airborne transmission risky touching surfaces. problem aren’t enough establish touching surfaces “safe”. 

For example, jumping airplane without parachute probably orders magnitude likely kill base jumping. make base jumping safe? Shouldn’t also avoid base jumping wanted avoid death falling? too. plans travel see family friends holidays. Canceled those. seen best friends high school college 2 3 years, typically see least year. holiday season sucks. read article I'm sure mentioned extended UI runs December people laid April March able find job fully own.  stopped placebo group Europe testing PREP(HIV prevention drug) actual drug effective, stuff like happen. It’s moral issue think   Imagine coronavirus deadlier. Imagine find cure (like many viral diseases). Given country responded COVID, actually far worse case scenario. I’m feeling hopeful vaccine study results. possible two three months (the ones cared social restrictions) meet family friends again? surprise_Pikachuface.jpg Frankly, Putin shown much greater leadership care pandemic Trump. Car accidents ruin life stop getting cars. didn't, least country. country actually always get money patients families, else provide tje service properly. see anyone treating badly, bit way around.

So say: give need most, worst cases, healthcare workers. rational this. problem Canadian snowbirds (snowbirds visitors entire winter versus tourists come week) since there's national health plan Canada, required purchase travel health insurance. insurance specifically cover covid. 

The border closed Canadians they're free go. health insurance issue reason majority Canadian snowbirds coming. course there's always people DGAF, whole Canadians much conscientious. Also report, water still wet. 👨‍🚀 🔫👨‍🚀 *Always been* proof would accept. chicken pox infant. back days chicken pox parties thing. One kid neighborhood gets it, party everyone gets it, forgets it.

I got chicken pox party since I've getting doubles every vaccination comes out. Despite that, still antibodies Hep-B. 

Don't get started Dengue Fever. I've serotype twice. first time get think going die. second time get it? want die. People won’t see way. know little training have, tough there, many people want job, much want insurance.

Not even doctors getting pay bumps.

Best band together get spread control. doesn’t matter young par flu. Vaccinating really risk right move. people mild cases first time, many harmful symptoms second time. enough data yet truly know risk.

But importantly catch still spread others. actions still greatly harm others ans approach reinfection affects scientific. clear mistaken illusion ""america good"" desperately trying spin facts way back hypothesis. Sad. thanks input ""Cake Death?"" infections low, would effective method (basically preventing wave starting), rates we're currently seeing Europe US much. said loud scrolled saw   “Even basic ones” really effective wearer, spending lots time indoors groups others, everyone also wearing decent mask (not gaiter bandana example) need full 12 hours  ""It might last meal ever eat."" Bruh same. could buy house finally. possibilities!!   grandfathers sailed across oceans stormed beaches raked machine gun fire can't handle going bars gyms. Pathetic. pandemic, pandemic pandemic huge problems wealth income inequality class divide getting worse United States. problems need addressed. 

But imagine, society, genuinely trying reduce case count number deaths. make sense less people venturing stores more? example, one person contactlessly dropping 30 pizzas 30 homes less risk 30 people walking pizza shop? extend thought shopping- less virus spread less total people going shops. united? Masks mandatory regardless vaccination status Wisconsin here. Things could better.. optimistic.  yet, much shit. know? New Years party okay vaccine 2021. common scientific knowledge virus waste time infecting someone get vaccine summer. waste virus's resources! Oh yeah, agree totally.

My country, Denmark, make erm ethincity statistics, race statistics. count say adopted black child 100% Dane.

The ethis statistics help though. big outbreak Somali communty Aarhus, Somalis great credit actually managed stop - organizations started door door stuff inform them. (Many much pay attention official information.)

It helped lot could see stats outbreak there. hotel quarantine Auckland, lives parents, sister dog named Benny. miss hugs “squishing five people bench dinner,” said.

Also: Auckland.

This ""new normal"" bullshit, no? Obviously it'll completely different experience participants. still remember one early (because people saying impact younger people) outside friend two? couple gym friends careful day day life, meet park exercise. helpful many ways. depends state. second lockdown already announced Oregon. giving fuck soon. Covid spreading like wild fire America ignorant uneducated people like you. neighbor? neighbor?!?!! Well, rest fucking world is. I'm saying is, shareholder hospital would furious plan. bad business medium long term. County unsure covid spread surging last weeks behavior changed significantly. Could something simple weather? Could covid spread efficiently colder weather? Plus fact immune systems strong winter months? speculation must reason significant surge. Said seventy years ago someone zero training education economics. know think would weight. said USSR still around people thought could work, failed miserably US capitalist countries Europe grew wealth prospered. go 3 confirmed reinfections. actually taking steps covid-19 cases able determine reinfections. bar high problem uncommon take steps meet bar. 100% effective 95% effective, plus everyone healthy enough immune system receive vaccine is. illegal, still made legal. That’s Xanax less right - many schools closed, states gave guidelines let schools decide to. Unfortunately plenty schools virologists doctors staff, instead bunch rural conservatives making call. districts open be. Children taught germophobic pandemic over, exposure colds microbes strengthens immune system prevents autoimmune diseases. here: necessary clean surfaces - touch face washing hands. mostly caught inhaling it, elevator riskier touching buttons. Putin Trump administration? Substantial number? Compared total number cases reported call Substantial. surely lots non-reported reinfections, surely lot non-reported first infections.

 SARS immunity lasts long know, 17 years (currently number SARS happened 17 years ago).Where get data?

And speculation, decucting author's opinion probable outcome evidence have. That's science works way. Speculation would saying ""hey, SARS-1 faded away, virus going same"".

Having degree means nothing, want contradict paper saying, publish study evidence deductions.

I really get hate comments studies prove ""optimistic"" things. even republican okay lol, act like side empathy give shits effects lockdown country extend indefinitely. *coughs Dakotas* hit ocean 5 days week, go fucking gym pandemic suffer way pigs go facilities That's bit shortsighted think? Closing restaurants/bar right move, help financially meantime.

You know, like every western country doing? That's truth much sure. push orders without end, make Biden even larger pile crap sort out. schedule F order installed still place? fire cdc, fda, hhs ect. people (career employees) dec 31. I’ve going gym every day since June literally one wears mask 50+ people given time. one gives fuck it’s glorious put catastrophic pinch, going do? Fire everyone? leverage there. Yes, experience too
But nobody relly denies covid I’m sure read comment. advocate wearing mask, fact everyone wore mask, actual real mask, gaiter, we’d fairly safe. However you’re indoors people wearing masks right, wearing bad ones, taking wearing all, good N95 needed protect you. responding someone wondering someone who’s diligent wearing masks might get sick anyway, wonder got sick, we’ll that’s how. Yup, fine reasoning there. Glass vials, caps, clean rooms, boxes, labels, shipping containers, etc pose challenge vaccine itself. “he’s best can”

🙄 multiple? Except literally give family, loved ones coworkers. come say “if you’re scared stay home”. know want to

What tough guy Texan here. proud job he's doing, probably elevate standards. Worst part it? Texas huge rainy day fund, almost $10 billion, he's sitting on. He's damn murderer Finally good news industry.  confirm. Minneapolis schools remote learning start school year schools Hybrid moving full remote end month.  ""Criminally"" preference. friends exercise outdoors? small gym parks. bring equipment running. may ending soon though cause temperatures, helpful year. Absolutely not. wear mask take appropriate actions. January 20th cease COVID eradicated since politicians much influence power. there'll plenty cash wall street kind. Remember landlord creates homeless kids soon. Fancy talk human rights freedom rich kick underdog would great reinfection rare, might be. right now, order something classified reinfection, person would needed tested twice, get accurate positive twice, samples sequenced, infection verified different enough genome sequence, definitively state reinfection resurgence. top many individuals asymptomatic first time, excluded studies.

So multiple problems preventing us knowing true rate reinfection.

1) lack testing initially

2) lack testing asymptomatic people

3) failure maintain sample records

4) lack genome sequencing

5) reinfection similar viruses

6) lack time. Right parameters we're seeing reinfections people initial test shortages (that went summer), got sick after. people gotten sick twice July now.

We also thought kids spread virus effectively lacked data. also thought asymptomatic spread concern lacked data. New evidence changed assertions. Yup. South Africa well believe. Although sure Phase they’re in. That's true all. must get news fox soon ex president It’s binary thing, reinfection problem approximately 10% people according big NYT write-up. Early days though still learning......There absolutes disagree. Go bars beaches vaccinate everyone there. ones globetrotting spreading everyone else. don’t think know enough virus answer questions. Recently, trial participants AMA addressed somewhat similar questions. observed 2 years determine long antibodies last vaccination schedule look like. Yep, there's good reason church calls flocks shears regularly. feel like I'm walking tightrope avoid covid. work school diligent mask wearing. Read article healthy 18 year old.kid, 19 year old girl 28 year old doctor died disease. seems though usually young people die possibility It’s illegal outright ban interstate travel USA

as usual, disinformation spread uninformed wingnuts easily disproven within law long recognized state faced real danger contagious disease restrict rights: state ""may exclude limits … persons afflicted contagious infectious diseases,"" Railroad Co. v. Husen (1877), extends quarantines aim people might infected (or might get infected), exclusion people actually infected, see, e.g., Compagnie Francaise v. La. State Bd. Health (1902). cases reflect longstanding American practice, remain good law today. Oof, yeah would it. Thanks detailed breakdown. Still surprised high numbers are, seems like lot underlying factors sort made almost tailor-made COVID spread. Yeah stopped following corona news ever since Victoria massive spike. watch Ashley Bloomfield whenever he’s daily covid update. Rona news outside NZ basically irelevent &amp; depressing point LOVE idea!!!!?? Agreed, government stay it.

That said, think who's vaccinated public information (sort like voting records), private businesses allowed exclude patrons based vaccination status. Sad true! Yeah like you. biggest idiot, it’s like healthy taking care one’s immune system best going forward. hiding rooms, waiting vaccine save lives. Fucking pathetic gonna lie reading quickly read veins penis. thought hell not, works i'm game. I'll allow it. I'm going use rant one own

It's sub, everywhere online. I'm high risk get blasted say mentally tough seeing people. *""You Zoom. good enough? me. want kill friends? Would rather dead? No? shut up""* like believe capable right thing complaint whatsoever it. But, say miss socializing tell want kill people

God forbid react strongly them. People call sociopath tell I'm ignoring reality I'm distraught deaths are. Obviously, deaths awful! can't let dwell it, though, I'll absolutely miserable. mean I'm unaware bad things care. Constantly thinking terrible change anything, would it? 

And ever suggest level house ok. today, said small group outside plenty distance ok. called trash ""on virus's side"" ""think [I'm] special [I] think deaths causes."" I'm even it! I'm repeating doctors said. like never go far enough people would like saying global warming/climate change exist one cooler average year.

sound exactly like Gov. offices said current spike, Monday \~4500 cases compared Sunday's \~10k cases, everything fine.

I wish company would go back WFH, least stagger shifts... many people think everything fine, way many making plans travel holidays. No. take precautions like drinking driving, rules regulations, wearing seat belts, insurance, inspecting cars, speed limits, more. Apologize exactly? Toughen up. anything, I’ve insulted commenter Vice versa 

And suppose hours trenches Reddit comment sections led base case assumption I’ll trolled people consider radically impractical. appears I, now, become troll. 

You’re absolutely right, literally thought morning people treat political parties like football teams seems damaging serves allow population easily manipulated. I’d absolutely love hear candid closed door discussion among elite politicians bet they’re actually concerned far different talking points feed us. 

You’re also correct bar holding opinion changing opinion based evidence. I’d write longer response time go back slave job Lots countries struggling yes, dont deny that. I'm still belief US longer bastion opportunity idyllic life try peddle. Despite countries also struggling, base level is, opinion, backed scientific rankings various topics, far current US. 

I'm trying understand someone would.move US say Europe Canada Australia even Japan. I'm looking learn expand understanding human nature. 

Weather reason move something considered India Here’s hot take. you’re risk don’t live anyone is, access vehicle don’t deal public transport, save fucking delivery slots people need them. It’s tiring watching rich people aren’t even immunocompromised take slots they’re lazy shop own. It’s easy grocery shop safely, it’s safety theater refuse even go shops. Sigh. sick this. Let people sad. amount zoom bullshit good books replace entire year cancelled opportunities fear virus. could tell one meaningful thing March essentially now. It’s healthy okay admit things suck. Stop it. that‘s problem, that‘s due process Fomites transmit virus. insisting cleaning surfaces responsible. literally putting unnecessary risk. ""Oh goodness! Please take authoritarian power need! save now!"" Came here, say that. watch out, sustainable. sheeple!  

~ Deniers flocking churches shepherd calls.  Problem FDA VRBPAC(2 independent reviewers) take review it, meet discuss approved, looking meeting two groups ending December 10th, means probably accept either December 10th december 11th, dont see waiting weekend would end December 14th.


So like 21 days approved US. Right smart money filing EUA tomorrow, FDA reviewing two weeks meeting decision December 4 maybe week after. Hey, congratulations. That’s major victory. make significant difference, I’m talking Covid here. You’ve reduced risk numerous health problems you’ve already done. Keep going. obviously it, you’ve already shown. saving people's lives = oppression Well yes first tests 36-40 rounds replication, we're 42-45 rounds now. That's say today's tests way sensitive, detecting even non functional viral snippets Sars-cov-2, whereas first wave 10x less tests, tests done mainly symptomatic patients, indicative viral loads become symptomatic.

 


So say true seeing surge infections indicative pandemic spread, can't compare today's infections March cases, compare hospitalizations deaths objective measurements, going rate first wave even though infections are. Bring neighbor dollars 💵 It’s hopeless. know contain - basically contact tracing people stayed home.

/$ lol. People dying chemical exposure early pandemic. Stop cleaning. Full stop. Can't believe people still think fomites transmit virus simply told beginning yet fully believe masks told time wear make things worse. idiotic mentality reason 250,000 dead virus Even Jesus can't fix stupid. said isn't?

Many buildings likely mask rules though, apartment building. People really good it, almost never see someone moving common areas without mask. Coordinate response states. Share detailed hospitalization data di leaders date critical information local areas. Become best single source accurate case/hospitalization/death data. Provide masks every American. Encourage mask usage, social distancing, indoor ventilation exchanges air outside. Help states put teeth mandates.

Oh, STOP coming personal business bankruptcies giving people money stay home becomes necessary. many states open be. reminder.

Y’all let child murderer walk free.

Good job California. Glad getting priorities straight. It’s blocked paywall. currently since pandemic started? population density impact lockdowns 2 week quarantines? doesn’t. Aaaa-booshee! Yep, ones say ""but wore masks still outbreak"" don‘t understand masks preventing infections there, great especially helpful close Rt = 1, slightly dampen spread people behave like plague rats. Masks part prevention package, includes social distancing, etc ... Plus, masks need worn properly consequently work lots people haven‘t done that. FDA please take time approval, rush :) Lmao pretend bleeding heart “progressives” crack Gyms restaurants biggest spreaders virus. Every study shown this. Yes parties bad I'm guessing minny rule gatherings well Yeah, called [attenuated uses weakened strain original virus. Polio several variants, one attenuated vaccine. 

There [pros approach. OCD rescue, lol.  400k deaths December include excess deaths pneumonia. 366,793 covid, pneumonia influenza deaths according CDC's website (with influenza accounting like 7k those).


Making matters worse:
""It important note take several weeks death records submitted National Center Health Statistics (NCHS), processed, coded, tabulated. Therefore, data shown page may incomplete, likely include deaths occurred given time period, especially recent time periods.""



Source: doesn’t explain won’t allow mask mandates. Mask mandates would actually make easier keep economy open! something far evil work makes mad many governors asleep wheel this. governor Feds gone dead like this, bet I’d taking control, getting advisors, making executive decisions masks, inexpensive rapid testing all, etc...

We blame DJT first months, almost year obvious failure, starts “on us”. shortsighted mentality ends oppression. That’s works. rules identifying reinfections extremely strict, means miss lot them. goal reinfection testing determine whether happens, tell us common is.

Yeah read thread unofficial list. shit We've working home months now, two people team young kids 5 live girlfriend, one single father.

Our boss getting productivity, split time helping school. still expects work everyone else.

I never thought stay home parents's usually working full time remote job.

It hard work chaotic environment used able focus work without distractions.

I know gf bugs time wants get watch clip distract always home day. want discuss safety possible dangers vaccine is
/r/COVID19_vaccines/ Wisconsin reach around 75% one point? Let's give healthcare workers essential workers first. called heroes clapped hands, everything make jobs lives difficult.

If ask deserve vaccine first, one year paid holiday lifelong free healthcare. supply demand. people free time hand looking new ways generate money, entering stock markets. follow trend, people buying sticks, value gain. Real economy state doesnt always reflect share values. long people still chips invest.  FYI Waffle House anti-lockdown still serving food reals. I’m new nurse. wasn’t supposed way. worked butts years, unable complete clinicals practicum. got Covid still student. little PPE. class getting infected one one working. It’s mandatory work Covid unless one doc’s note citing severe symptoms. safety sucks. There’s nowhere put people anymore. 

The weirdest part everyone talks low. don’t text it. requires actual phone call discuss fear many breaks infection control. It’s sorta like supposed wanna go heroic whatever, we’re also scared families we’d like infect. patient load insane. want hours you. Etc. 

Then there’s anger many Americans entirely irresponsible, result. I’m pretty angry. probably line around block people can't wait vaccinated. First line like doctors nurses health workers, like police, teachers, grocery store workers, many others risking lives food, kids, health, safety. Plus general public want live restrictions live nagging fear/concern.

My kids' dinner conversation around vaccine first line! much kids miss friends, even said healthcare people first round, there's enough everyone right away. took saliva test think messed :(

It said cough 3-5 times test best quality forgot that.

However, coughing waiting line.

Did mess test ? honestly idea point is.

My point masks still best option protecting people cannot social distance stay home. need worn everyone, protect wearer source control, original intend mask mandate, citizens protect eachother themselves. study purely studies efficiency masks protecting wearer, never intention mask mandate. original intention always source control, crucial part controlling transmission virus often carried asymptomatics.

This people wear masks. Thinking study proves lower benefit wearing mask simply false conclusion study testing benefit masks source control (again original intended use masks) also top extremely lacking first place.

This understand points are. Europe like 6 countries hispanic?

I mean, like think Spain using medicine north european people forget count Hispanics, like uhm, well Spanish :)

Hey now. completely useless. spend $5 million covid relief funds \*checks notes\* uh, tourism ads get people travel \*double checks notes\* South fucking Dakota...  country living like virus doesn’t exist. They’ve looked evidence decided they’re fine getting infected. 

There’s nothing this. They’ve already read evidence come conclusions. Nothing new virus found next months change decision.

 hospital knew exactly trying pull, bad acts smacked hard leave mark prevent future BS.

I hope union leaders listening podcasts organized labor tactics right now, bc need Yeah thought that, nobody giant pharmaceutical company Pfizer even considered minute. No, know vaccine even effective always chance vaccine could malfunction make people *more* vulnerable disease. There's reason trials take long. Roughly speaking, risk dying single Covid infection roughly risk dying within year. 

That rises massively get older particularly past 60. think much risk 70-year-old vs. 60 year-old causes, double that, see much stratification based age (at least 85 so).  Hahaha only. think constituency confused base. base gets elected, constituency gets ballot  are. Korean tests flawed. Many places shown false positive tests upon arrival later shown incorrect. Many Taiwan spring mind. hurt things. Personally would leave alone. There's reason go next crew fine day later. That’s absurdly broad. socialized anyone entire year? families 3 choose dinner together morally repugnant? 4, 5? What’s number qualify “trash?” Im high risk take shit seriously, people like part fucking problem. 

No human trash, ways gather small numbers safely. Enjoy bunker though Every economy based that. Lol  Gave vote. People really can't stand hearing truth. half us dumbasses don’t give shit anyone themselves? grandma hit ""live free"" shit Im like free what? mortal coil?

Man, gonna unemployed pandemic lol. dont get people downvoting you. Ironically 4chan showing china full lockdown crematoriums built 24/7 mid december... everyone calling conspiracy theory. irony Giving shot sick like boarding windows storm blew in. It’s pointless reduce symptoms. OK buddy everyone capable basic math ""Buy rumor, sell News"" like say investor world. Even new stay home order, people stay home. Good thing 95% effective since 45% people going take it. POS governor still wont consider lock downs actively blocked El Paso so. problem sending morgue trucks, though. Im disgusted you’re vaccinated matter others Fair point. Regulatory Capture real thing currently. Hopefully turned around bit soon. Man serious af right now. There’s literally shitload cases you’re still celebrating like it’s nothing everyone thinks liberty backwards. Countries walk straight lines, either. know. people expect from, others don't. everyone see city wearing mask yet numbers still climbing. Something change percentage people wearing masks.  mean actual live tracker shows TX highest count ND. Anyhow lose shit, whats mortality rate severity infections ND ? Imagine fast Midwest would shut Covid killing cows. know prevents asymptomatic infections that's thing vaccine preventing infections. clinical trials used symptomatic infections confirmed testing primary metric. continuously test participants. Federation American Scientists uncovered grim stunning statistic Wednesday: North Dakota highest COVID-19 mortality rate state country; highest COVID mortality rate world. 
     North Dakota rate 18.2 COVID deaths per million people. South Dakota, rate 17.4 deaths per million, third highest world. states lowest facemask rates state country. Experts said mortality rates akin country throes war United States. 
     Deaths Per Day October 23, 2020

Civil War 514 
WWII 297 
AIDS 43 
Vietnam War 9 
Iraq War 2 young unlikely die prevent giving someone susceptible, possibly friends family members. It’s frustrating scary simple civic duty deemed sign oppression large part population US. 

It’s even weirder get weird looks back-handed comments wearing mask. idiots think I’m trying protect rather them. think “trusting lord rather mask” protect “if murder someone don’t wear mask, it.”

Meanwhile town 2500 road access, half assed medical center large elderly population. Half state’s ICU beds full contact tracing also become impossible well. 

So fucking sad frustrated right now. Oh nope sorry misread. bad. Looking graphs worldometer florida seems 1 week surge U.S. whole does. I'm sure artificat people taking weekends takes week catch up. Apparently KY believes electing decent democrats elect vile people nationally making things up? absolutely works. people *want* return normal life included figures? people actually enjoy want remain working home forever. know I'm one them. commute expenses later wake-up time great. Indiana says hello. Mild restrictions best here. Nothing make difference  Might help leader would accept loss allow transfer new administration, nope, golfing bunker nothing, second worst thing complete scorched earth leaving Ironically least norm foodservice nursing. yet see mummies contract covid. Coincidence? think not. deleted everyone except closest friends, local businesses, neighborhood association. neighborhood association that's getting annoying. avenue communication use. governor. live? Falsehood temp checks bullshit surveys.  slacking getting flu shot.

Made appointment Monday, masked went walgreens (seemed like least populated option avoiding doctor settings possible).

Past years, get amped ""fuck anti vaxxers"" getting appointment rolling get vaccine.

Then, I'm line sitting wave panic hits ""dear fucking christ, I'm terrified shots""

This year I've trying lose covid pounds working (full body). sore less 24 hours vs days past years. Definitely motivation continue working prepared covid vaccines. least Newsom 53 years old, Pelosi (80) going indoor hair salon Feinstein (87) going around without mask, really start think conspiracy thing: Florida nice weather time year mostly. People spending time outside. Transmission lot difficult unconfined space. least shut flights going state, seal borders. Contain horrors stupidity. Gotcha. airplane probably horrendously unsafe, unless directly front kf, behind, next infected person. issue mostly lies inside airport, walking plane aisles, using bathroom, getting airport, etc. Obviously 14-day quarantine ideal, even quarantining 10 11 days makes somewhat less likely she'll still infectious got something trip. doubt would trialed mink strain specifically. Pfizer/BioNTech put manuscript back July showing antibodies generated similar performance vitro number common Cluster-5 variant minks detected humans since September.  shoutings, bangings table, sharp suspicious glances, furious denials. source trouble appeared Napoleon Mr. Pilkington played ace spades simultaneously. Twelve voices shouting anger, alike. question, now, happened faces pigs. creatures outside looked pig man, man pig, pig man again; already impossible say which. It’s true. Millions Chinese trying leave. even supplied source. many others. 
I never said America isn’t wrong. fact opposite. condemn it. 
If China wouldn’t even able discussion. That’s dumb argument is. 
In America free disagree gov want. Free speak against. Free part chose 
It’s always funny argue people taking advantage rights would lose actually China. silly Cleaning surfaces harm.  may give someone emotional comfort, job.

But also clean air.  Air purifiers (basically, good filter fan blower) literally clean air. sure small units transmission vector See 10 years Weird got downvoted. bots tonight? Damn really tired morning lol. Still, throw Wyoming 8% senate 1% population seems like bad system. That's horrible hear. would taken seriously get go prioritized lives ""freedom"" infuriating predicament. around decades. covid-19 vaccines around 3+ months. plenty good reasons onsite work. miracle! twins get rare pleasure growing without mother! YAAAAY! really exercising hard masks could limit ability get sufficient oxygen support high intensity dangerous come worldometer already 256,000 deaths? Given lack testing less developed countries, 20x detected worldwide seems reasonable. would rather dont run risk catching testing place. Ooohhh nnnooooo. 44th education, always voting Republican....nnnoooooooo make take decades consequences manifest increased medical cost higher morbidity. study hospitalized patients. people experience hospitalized? Hi. live Iowa Governor intent killing us. gives press conferences scolds us “doing right thing,” burdening healthcare systems; however never actually anything. We’ve never mask mandates, positivity rates always highest country. 
It’s horrifying, embarrassing global scale, disappointing, we’re still worst part.  put pants one hoof time like everybody else. 😀 Right, pandemics people stop babies, stop accidents illnesses medical problems. answer can’t hiding help comes. I’m sorry went much, went similar. wouldn’t wish went kids. open doors windows safe? even spray isopropyl alcohol? would feel really terrible brought home next crew get it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* accountability US lifetime. like, possibility develop weird cancer right? Like, won’t commercials 20 years saying “if loved one received COVID-19 vaccine 2021, please call number entitled compensation” etc impossible. scientists know h2h transmission, must spread far wide community. Otherwise enough evidence prove it. 

Consider fact Wuhan transportation hub, lots people travel abroad every day. Also think characteristics COVID-19. Suppressing transmission requires tracking quarantining everyone flights Wuhan, well close contacts, contacts close contacts.  give award, will.

All crazy people hell bent going out. People afraid die surely fucking care become unwitting murderers, either. Im pretty good vegetarian twice year special occasion I'll go buy nice ethically raised grass fed cow, got deep freeze garage. figure better eating chickens, could eat hundreds fuckers year course there’s purpose. Masks work specific scenarios public arenas. 
Outside plenty distance? need mask. Spending hours someone indoors home? Cotton reusable masks aren’t going sufficiently effective even matter.
Over 15 min hour indoors someone office similar? Masks work. sounds like people may concerned might actually upset something 😄 infrastructure

Yeah, government prioritized production meat (a product necessary survival, plant protein exists), production PPE healthcare workers. History going judge complicit kindly. Piss vinegar come that's reassurance. get stuffed gator Christmas. MADE DEAD BABIES MICROCHIPS! Yep. one father raised looks really good year. Optimal situation: People taking precautions take much greater precautions aren't, ever, matter what. Colorado - covid 'Dial' uses certain metrics determine restrictions are, 'Red' lock down. However... numbers grown high enough put us 'Red', guess governor did? added PURPLE lockdown color! Ummm add new color change numbers. Ça devrait être au Québec I’ve wondering &amp; mindset. Thanks asking. You’re dumb. understand, vaccines reduces chances sick dying actually getting it. stuck Covid long time guess, atleast lives saved. think it, lot governors Midwest states strike sort balance. strict lockdown, constituents vote out. hand nothing, lot people die constituents vote out.

Several governors states already issued mask orders probably issue shelter place order. going enforced? Maybe municipal law enforcement agencies doubt serious punishment occur.

That way hell breaks loose governors say, “Too many citizens didn’t follow orders!” Even governors like Gavin Newsom don’t even follow rules. Texas, took words right mouth. There’s end sight right us part staying home, others don’t care real leadership making right thing. It’s infuriating. exact numbers terms risk. CDC says food: 

[""The risk getting sick COVID-19 eating handling food \(including frozen food produce\) food packages considered think clear seeing people, safer masks without masks (eating). 

So perfectly risk free think good amount vigilance Well, like here, maybe go Iran Saudi Arabia. ""I care house fire! I'm going let government say can't go sleep home!"" Please, let's remember plenty stupid COVID behavior every generation stop bashing young old. I'm sure us cite personal examples lots news stories paint generation poor light. 

If telling us middle-aged younger people area large models responsible COVID behavior, absolutely notify media people get good press deserve things sacrificing slow spread, perhaps inspiring others follow example. live Cali already it, didn’t even keep kids home school. It’s 99% survival rate lmaooo 

It selfish ignorant attitude that's problem. mortality rate increase age co-mobility. 

You care anyone except family. care kids might infect kids, parents, grandparents people community risk. 

Just quick profile history search selfish racist thought. ""As former sheriff Florida"" said prouder boy story 

"" **Florida deputy fatally shooting Black teens moving car""** guess could count lucky wife brother taking seriously too. see lot people don’t family side. Good luck stay safe. mean, yeah, fair analogy drunk even getting here?

If family acting pretty fucking safely even taking extra precautious week leading dinner, you’re way less likely get disease opposed lunatic family doesn’t take precautions ever.  FYI, received vaccine yet Didn’t intend back-handed insult. Sorry. Given guy reddit, prove Dr fauci lied, recommendations harmed American people, compared trump's lied covid-19 would suddenly disappear, like miracle. 

Trump lies killed 100,000 American, Dr fauci much. like pint time time anti science.

Correct. way much black-and-white thinking terms like anti-science, anti-vax, anti-mask, etc. reality people take vaccines kinds reasons, like thinking really need it, like told do, much hassle set appointments go medical facility twice, liking doctors, etc. disagree concerns, science asking risk life. Science already told social distancing masks fine job keeping safe vaccine fully tested.

Its economy, least using economy excuse, want rush take vaccine malls restaurants open back faster. They're ones pushing emergency authorization. Well hope right, one single reputable source believes back normal March.  Yep. would think pandemic obesity huge risk factor would obvious opportunity attempt address apparently not. Take $1,000 pay get 2 stitches put daughter’s face...and insurance. Hospitals get paid well. Yeah, live Knox county work grocery store. see 5 9 customers day wear masks. sad. Tennessee's infections also much going up. We're 8th state infections. winter fun. Weird. Who'd've thunk ignoring science would lead things scientists said would happen ignore science? Funny 40 years I'd endure unending political rate ""evil greedy drug companies"" I've heard disparaging word 9 months. Reminds Kawati's removed Iraqi army country, shit 80's, nation ""No ugly american!"" shouted streets. Peru Ecuador come mind, especially added couple thousand ""suspected"" covid deaths totals. yeah, significantly poorer Poland, also expected motherland. *""Bring neighbours infect path jeebus quicker!""* tested positive antibodies May gettin mild case COVID. Tested positive July August recently tested negative twice antibodies beginning November.... 

Not excited.  in........trump orange grass green feel us disabled people one first ones get vaccine also. desperate go back routines stuff especially autism stuff. many us health conditions increase risk getting sick Covid.  keep telling peeps stop fucking going store eating listen-fuck give covid die dont give shit. Im done chaos shit. control dealing freedom loving people country need make lot money pay taxes anymore. Meanwhile I’m still relatively young don’t risk anything don’t want long hauler 40 years. grasping straws. drug dealing crime. restrict travel based potential criminal activity. investigate prosecute evidence. pandemic everyone affected area potential carrier, crime, subjects restrictions travel quarantines ""outright"" bans. mean, best got... thing would work point hard lockdown 6 weeks actual consequences leaving house, otherwise vaccine won’t really matter point us dead infected Spring. news: Thing warned would happen, happened.  IL terrible outbreak strict restrictions get-go they're back quite strict again. Whereas woman know FL says 100% normal pretty much whatever want they're recording less cases us double population. literally get it! I'm saying open let fly whatever, saying can't comprehend it. African union effective coherent covid plan. Highest infections south africa followed Tunisia Kenya. Continent whole well due sound policy sub seem realize governments world distribute billions vaccines year routinely.

This one poses unique challenges, kind unprecedented logistical task. pizza delivery, existence may quite pampered imagining. course, nobody knows long vaccine protection actually last Randy Marsh  I'm social person many conventions events made friends events able see since 2019 literally got called selfish douche hardcore new normal people I'm like okay think we're going lockdowns, social distancing, nothing next couple years I'm sorry mistaken.

In next couple months, I'm probably going back job planning go back conventions go able see friends scientists right we're probably going go back normal end year beginning 2022 Agree 100%. get better 2021 slowly surely! privilege shows post lack reading comprehension astonishing. even encourage people spread more, actually learned understand people saying instead putting words mouth would realize OP saying save slots high risk people aren’t high risk go store allow high risk people use delivery services. get antidepressant effects exercising well bodyweight training, need gym. muscle growth diminished, need weights. Hell even running hour likely sufficient. agree sucks I'm pissed Federal government shit amount support provided. would love see expansion SNAP carveouts specifically delivery food services. would good job creation would delivery shopping work aviable, two one benefit. 

Even past pandemic would solve issues related 'food deserts' help elderly disabled already struggle shopping. is, smoking gun promoting saving delivery spots at-risk population bad thing? nice, imagine always lose lose situation? 

Either mutation infectious, case would never spread, measures pointless. seems case. 

If mutation highly infectious, measures would worked. seems reality. constantly referred ""flock""

Confirmation either Sheep Chickens grandma actively wanting die nearly 10 years breast cancer last 5. People keep projecting live others get old might longer see way.  Everyone doesn’t know supposed do. need clear information make decisions messages place starting top president. 

He couldn’t even decide real problem, said would go away, skeptical masks, touted unproven cures, questioned expert advice (Fauci) etc. 
He absolutely least partly responsible ineffective response. Given Good God, number people I've heard 70-something say ""such-and-such's 23 year old got fine, overblown"" completely ridiculous.

Nine months ago honestly would told probably pessimistic people. wrong. iPad contracted covid Funny one side ultimate cause yet side can’t anything fix it. Seems almost completely, subjective. Hey COVID spiking wanna say fuck faces but, might need lockdown again...sigh tested positive monday. crazy high fever sunday night/monday morning/noon symptoms vanished besides sore throat. body fight really fast?


I feel completely fine me, flu sucked 10× more. got 4 years ago felt sick week(i couldnt get bed) i'm saying covid flu experienced it. they've around long enough know life world like They're willingly misled. Constitution Federalist papers easily found complete. Free apps, free PDFs, easily find copy bookstore. They're lazy read. I'd rather Alex Jones tell says screaming. Hell, bought one bc used give fuck government till Donald Trump broke it, IDEA constitution actually says.  really easy get us? I've heard reports taking yeeeeears get even accepted all, yet also reports ppl getting illegally skirt law entire life. 

I dont deny countries stricter laws. Countries also streams refugees whos lives risk. 

I position want move, thankfully mental exercise trying understand others coming from. dont deny anyone decision desires. Simply trying understand decision would ever make. would take several countries, even longer wait times strict requirements moving US. biggest concern Healthcare lack social safety nets worker protection laws. said, coming war torn country significant (years) difference US say European country decision would harder US may contention.  Everybody knows that... I’ve never Oklahoma it’s still least favorite state. call preachers shepherds also. pastors call congregation, flock. Yes, beautiful new world higher education service (HEaaS). money, students learning purely coincidental. honest, professors.  Almost 2000 per day? horrible. Yep totally agree misfortune crossing paths danger

Which pandemic taught associate without firm grip reality re: Covid even they're wearing mask time Inventing imaginary scenarios like called ""clutching straws"". isnt quality information, mods....Why isnt entire conversation stricken like goddam comment 401k? Covid Commander No. January, sub (well, mother sub, r/china_flu migrated here) passing around fake posts created 4chan crows flying sky dead streets Wuhan estimates 10 million already dead! Goddamn expected infra-structurally /economically developed nation like Poland. scarcely think country earth disparity excess deaths confirmed deaths Another example Europe's failed leadership mean, normal conditions probably wouldn’t know mRNA would adverse effects 5-10 years now. Afaik trials like generally operate vaccine already distributed years. Plus, case, one worries they’d best getting AZ vaccine. ""Feckless bungling"" implies he's least sort trying. ""It is. 🤷‍♀️"" That's great point! BTW, I've acute pancreatitis secondary hypertriglyceridemia. 10 days hospital, bad time. I'm glad able gallbladder removed avoid experience. like flock geese. Shit everything overly aggressive it. public already tired restrictions listening, restrictions help?  still tell them, could asymptomatic carrier covid would still antibodies, vaccine recipient.  so.. tell them.

&amp;#x200B;

this way, ***WILL UNABLE TO*** contact tell something's wrong jab got.... totally useless.. worse.. toxic.

&amp;#x200B;

good idea. think opposite. get disappointment can't live without hope.  don’t care people delivery exposing bring groceries you’re encouraging people use delivery services increase exposure delivery workers. 

Gotcha. You’re encouraging spread COVID-19.

(See ridiculous sound making stuff fit narrative? That’s look).   token people able drive drunk want. keep road yourself! EZ PZ gotta stop coming here. Every day it’s back forth “we almost there, stay strong bit longer” “the world know forever. Get used die mad it”

I’m tired stomach put blender daily Yeah like “what mitigation efforts?”

Current mitigation efforts saying/tweeting ""we rounded curve!"" multiple times week. So, everyone tired lockdowns... solutions is??? LOCKDOWNS. Sorry didn’t see comment edited mine. Wtf? aren’t shortages. weird rationale divorced reality. It’s saving spot anyone, it’s voluntarily exposing others. $$$. Mega preachers massive fixed costs. deficit. solve deficit need influx new members tax forever...to fund private jets mansions. Hard enough get us agree treatment plans. Even harder get everyone board. Plus income well. 0 help unemployment huge gamble part. wish could agree strike even health care providers still 10 people Thanksgiving besides immediate family. Xmas zoom ICU. US (federal government) specifically chosen ""leave states"" far implementing social distancing / masks. thanksgiving parties private homes, I'm aware state enforcable laws fines this, may guidelines recommendations, though. I’m J&amp;J vaccine trial. said vaccine approved use end study, take regardless I’m placebo treatment group. Data data, whether treatment placebo, still able use info analyses immune response vaccine v approved one, placebo would add data approved vaccine works test etc. amount reasoning would change mind I'll say this: absolute donut Yes! People's hesitancy shop store due safety concerns hesitancy allow come unsure safe making hard pay bills. mention employees also varying levels precautions. cannot stop employee eating going bar, supposed put schedule risk family's health stay open even make enough money pay them. lockdown would welcome point view store owner. Government support lockdown would spectacular, especially since paying taxes whole life. am, limping along towards bankruptcy USA decided pretend nothing happening think businesses make money open regardless world around them. Thank selfless attitude! Taking kind leadership would nice start. Acknowledge severity virus instead trying downplay it. Encourage mask wearing social distancing instead trying discredit scientists. Hell, even Trump attend task force meetings while. 

Instead, sit back nothing tell everyone big deal, medical infectious disease experts actually know they're talking about. Yes sir shows stupid arrogant always get people Jeopardy one. indication numbers grouped together. I'm sorry @ open black friday. I'm upset government announcements ""stay home thanksgiving, thanksgiving bad"" fail shun black friday 100s strangers press together indoors spread COVID. probably already know answer, would appreciate advice. 

My grandma's sister going die soon (not covid related). lucky make Thanksgiving. grandma seen covid, wants see passes. However would involve flying, completely across country. 

Is safe way this? think grandma would heartbroken never got see sister again, may regret going. obviously extremely risky considering current circumstances. Also grandma lives current hotspot (but tested negative) sister lives somewhere hit hard. 70+. .. something new Trump go rampage about.

Will sack try someone lined rose garden pad shot marine guards? They’ll never that. requirements even low tier med schools insane takes years prep qualified apply. I’m surprised ones freaking 1,900 deaths legit. well, guess we’re lol SARS-CoV-2 tests generally authorized tell virus present determining quantity virus present,” said Dr. Alex Greninger, assistant professor assistant director UW Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratory. “Our findings suggest tests measuring amount virus – viral load – help doctors identify admitted hospital highest risk serious disease need special attention.”

How determining level virus patients?

Edit- never mind article explains it.

Very important know. think telling people go shop instead getting delivery aren’t actual supply shortages vulnerable people? know plenty people lasting symptoms covid  think telling people go shop instead getting delivery aren’t actual supply shortages vulnerable people? IDK San Antonio doing, heard nothing Houston hospitals almost capacity. checked one dashboards used look daily July things got bad 3x many patients right now. Thanks prolonging everyone, asshole.  Meh, different wholesome Cool thing love forget history. I'm pessimist.... I'll believe see it. Everything clusterfuck far, expect same. hitting 2K Thanksgiving? Yes, 5 tested aftering showing symptoms 16 Aug 7 Sep even though supposedly already tested negative China. 

I mean odds especially people country 1.39 billion reports 10\~20-ish new cases daily?

It ie either China falsely reported new cases test flawed. Pick poison. True Detective Season 3 right! Dunning-Kruger equals Fox News? university work predicted would problem set semester schedule in-person classes ended Thanksgiving. anti-misinformation, case anyone else confused grammar. explosions mostly north. skip warning go directly ""Steps done mitigate pandemic impact"". Erm, England island. island Great Britain made England, Scotland Wales, devolved governments dealing pandemic different ways, differing levels success. example, England currently national lockdown place whereas Scotland tier system counties nearly operating normal others full lockdown. don’t agree all. people think they’re immune catching (for good reason), realize virus dangerous specifically, thus going much less cautious yet gotten it.

I haven’t gotten CoVid yet, say sure get get won’t wearing mask social distancing crap anymore. would Horus do??  lot possible explanations. positive PCR meen body type viral infection. fact, PCRs done outside sterile places like labs hospitals easely contamintate give false positiver results.

My wife doctor (an internal medicine doctor, sees lot COVID) Madrid, hospital seen 1 case reinfection far. That's reason sound strange someone says knows 1 person got reinfected (not case get point). work rehab hospital given point multiple covid patients. I'm therapy tech job going everyone's room multiple times day normal mask on. 

I depression anxiety is, I've going whole time. finally starting get I've taken days leave early depression gotten bad seeing patients deteriorate covid, anxiety high patients around normal mask come back positive covid.

We started fiscal year August, I've left early 5 times since. get leave early/ call 3 times whole year, I've gone beyond 3 months.  2 written warnings call leave early one time I'm fired. 

I'm trying look new job, one hiring, day anxiety gets worse worry get sick bring home family. already preexisting health conditions would make covid worse me.

So wake up, cry bit come work cry more, hoping get covid. dont even get hazard pay. thinking maybe *do* think end times want around it. die avoid rapture hell earth. Omg can't 100% everything prefer global crisis vaccine WAY

no must prefer times never bad time would sad Maybe Trump wasn’t making job difficult possible would make sense. blame clear. probably head back echo chamber conservatives say things like 994% survival rate !!! Yes everything said  separating Covid economy. 70 million trumpies don’t seem get.  “I gots muh freedumbs” crowd tanking economy. lol efforts? Yup. friend legit PTSD c-section. pretty process, sure, women typically awake it. refuses children result. think would loved coma, tbh.

That said, super high risk, great mother children came ok. It’s double blinded people got placebos even know got placebo people act dumb thanksgiving, christmas slaughter like second comming black death. Calling mask wearers ""Politically Correct"". Basically politicizing masks Virus runs rampant. saved everyone seriously, mask/social distancing encouragement could saved 10k? 50k?, 100K lives? History going look kindly Trump. one's saying ignore experts. lost everyone said weeks months make much difference lives horrible COVID took comfort new reality many people miserable always been.  looks like there's hope horizon, get nervous. *Surprised pikachu face* Christianese, Christian, whatever close enough. lifestyle brand. Megachurches attract certian sort prosperity gospel narcissist.  Jesus would chased every last one fuckers temple. could fly, Uber quarantine location, true 14 day quarantine never interact people leave place you’re in, parent come pick up. would pretty difficult figure logistics would quite substantially reduce risk transmitting them. exhausting tryin maintain troll account? though, random person internet who's offered proof kind? trick's crater blame Biden it. No. different. Also, REALLY expensive develop vaccine. It’s expensive manufacture it. they’ve already dumped shit ton resources it, pre producing approval pennies bucket.  cannot tell y'all funny users yell bot. cartoon level evil.  voted this. SEVENTY MILLION people wanted things keep going like this. Oh, see, you’re showing true colors. 

This supposed reasoned debate failing address opponent’s well made points counterpoints negate usurp them. Instead, simply shouting point again. 

Sadly, arguing lives opponent arguing preserving inspired democracy exist modern times... possibly ever. America spent taken millions lives pursuit principles... now, face death, want us turn cowards give principles illusion safety protection delivered all-powerful state. 

Know history. Study political science. Don’t fool democracy thing remain... fool... oppressors. worst thing workers ones pay price Tyson sales go bad publicity. understand, placed NFL covid list mean positive result, rather potentially exposed near someone it. I've noticed players pop onto list days back series negative tests. 

Of course, given Raiders, fun assume naughty. Shocked pikachu face Ah yes, tasty coins. remember that. question everybody wants answer is: second one going less severe time not?” says Derek Cummings, studies infectious disease dynamics University Florida.

This exactly looking sub, there's still answer. least saves trouble asking. germaphobe introvert, admit adapted current way life quickly some. However, people know virus (quite fucked one case) + family friend died it, REALLY miss either. think well, even bar high reinfections classified seems like we’ve many cases notice least large enough percentage reinfections get us worried. read three confirmed cases reinfections couple iffy. seems like statistical anomaly rather proof reinfections widely possible. Sounds good me. :) Fuck it.. Let society crumble. don’t think so? someone goes church every week studies Bible daily, would argue anything wake call believers nonbelievers. Bible say people would humble pray, would rescue them? Instead, church America become arm political party rather Body Christ. American church chosen king rule us, like Old Testament. suffering it. Ha, remember Bernie lost again? must hard you, believing something much seeing fail over, like you. scandal every years German governmental institutions record people race way...)

There 44 countries Europe. 1 lol.

I'm criticizing article talking Europe - 44 countries like 700 million people, knowing going places.

To identify something problem Europe, need least show problem thing like 25 countries.

You'd also show even relevant. article blaming countries black people make statistics lol. stupid. hope cash within seconds arrival Go people. Go it.

At point simply don’t care anymore. Go get covid infect neighbors. cares anymore. You’ll another statistic point anyways, nameless shadow long forgotten years pass.

Go enjoy turkey prayers. police? nah give pigs last That’s crazy people granted access coronavirus vaccine first remains unclear determined CDC

This article basically says nothing Nebraska here. Ready put leave absence work month dumb coworkers big Thanksgiving celebrations I've clinging stimulus check... conspiracy gotcha, think funny people refuse acknowledge usa response outright terrible. constantly exposed germs bacteria help strengthen immune systems.  Time mass produce start building production facilities world :D  Put fence around whole state. Good chance way statistics work study significantly expanded could settle somewhere 90% 95%. work lab evvvvverything C except dumbass desiccant pouches get. Says recharge 245F forget everytime put 245C. melts really fast haha hear rocks rattling around otherwise empty skull. fuck going it? retarded? There’s 7 billion people damn moron, I’m one man hell Texas County??  principle sounds good abstract, certainly looks bad applied particulars. 

The reality police employees owe duties employer. American dream always myth.  mentioned elsewhere, revealed one reason Trump admin nothing thought would stick big cities thus wreck lives mostly democrats. realize cities used dealing crazy shit would get plan action place without fed support prolonged pandemic would eventually reach every rural area America quickly spread due messaging. rural areas used dealing huge problems like often near medical support going need. virus causes hyper inflammation reaction 20% people medical support 10% less people die. unclear many die can't get adequate medical support unable get medical support all. Chances may never know true number deaths due covid, people watching death rate differentials ball park. creating shit rolls downhill effect. governor contemplating leaving decision making towns mayor. Lol Walz mess around. revise things cool down. FYI newbies , mask cover nose *crickets* 83% upvoted?

Because people interpret 'good news' article nothing more. people may interpret one 'goal post' moves.

Also, reddit many inward, borderline sociopathic 'introverts' want lockdown go forever claim degenerate lives kind value. send shitload nurses icu doctors French Laundry dime while. can’t believe thing consumed entire year lives. many chances experiences lost. New Years Day actually hopeful next decade technological societal progress would bring. Instead got this. hear dude. here. Let's hope summer! cannot thank mods enough this. source truth, comfort, companionship lot us one else face darkness with. Again, I'm weatherman telling weather.

You're trying turn blame game me.

I telling facts virus.  things true virus, whether refer them.

You listen not, stop asshole. Wrong place kinda humor, man. believe small government dislike centralizing power. exceptions made coordination needed. There's better example need contain virus.

The opposers restrictions, general, probably oppose principle. oppose party says they're opposing whatever Democrats saying. joke.

Either way, think they'd wrong oppose restrictions principle since like opposing law punching people face, law prevents harming people. people saying ""but rights!"" oppose law meant prevent harm people they're consistent. don't, they? say punch face even though stopping takes away ""right"" it. double standards around. Asia norm

America Asia.

Europe Asia.

Africa Asia

Just something 'normal' Asia, mean adopted areas.

It 'normal' India, example, stay parents home get married. 26 year old living parent America, people would call him/her loser. also sparsely populated islands currently summer. lucky enough don’t go outside course. I’m also referring things like cold. [Those free people insurance requirements paying test, also require doctor's order. GP seeing patients ""Covid-like symptoms"", get order. option go ER get order, would cost lot $119. want venue instead people stands filled dogs. mortality burden per infection

is taking deaths account? Like one person's life worth $10m there's 0.1% fatality rate per infection, average infection takes $10k value? wonder estimates years life lost people ""recovered."" Plus everybody died 8 years left them, account years individually might change things. sure that's cause net increase decrease though. vaccine time. vaccines light end tunnel. hilarious :) love it. Go on, what's else? household get tested remain separated him. Since you’re probably considered close contact, think guys quarantining well 14 days - local health department covid hotline good source info. That's important question, really one sterilizing immunity. 

There [huge recent SARS-CoV-2 immunity. includes tentative analysis take achieve sterilizing reasonable interpretations made. Antibodies component immune memory provide truly sterilizing immunity. Immunization studies non-human primates indicated circulating neutralization titers \~200 may provide sterilizing immunity relatively high dose URT challenge (62), neutralizing titers \~3,400 may provide sterilizing immunity high dose URT challenge (63),

(63) links preclinical Moderna vaccine. 100μg dose, patients neutralizing antibody titers 231.8 day 57, compared 109.2 patients recovered Covid-19. 

So know sure, seems possible sterilizing immunity present, least normal viral doses everyday life. J&amp;J within week lot people believe world 6,000 years old, even think 2,000 1972 sounds pretty ancient live studio twenty floors major downtown area. easy. find way get nature I'm freak continue responsible thing. I'm dismissive - know everyone's situation different. I'm providing example done.
 
During WWII, people London spent months hiding indoors German planes bombing city daily. even turn lights night fear targeted. able that, sit asses stream Netflix play CoD whatever strikes fancy.
 
We're going mentally fucked this. great grandparents used freak fuck one us got flu kids they'd lived Spanish Flu. *will* scar generation. that's excuse shitty, irresponsible behavior. Exactly Hawaii, they're middle pacific, control entry. Thanksgiving 20+ people, multiple old folks. Everyone fine :) African data massive problem. studies bigger cities look like less infections one would assume (small houses, crowded streets big families that). main problem course remote village one tested. 
That said, Africa seems unusually low mortality, maybe mostly older people die (the median age death covid 80, that's good te decades older life expectancy Africa) also proposed might related differences immune system caused parasites (tape worm apparently common adults one). Whatever cause seems Africa get death rates US has. Yet keep blaming Trump! continue avoid acknowledging point!

There millions Trump voters also wear masks. know noticed he's actually power yet.  I'd rather reviewed first going  I've told 'X' result death virus. I've also worked everyday pandemic close proximity public coming hospital. words, telling I'm going die get near people also expectation keep working seeing patients. 

Let guess, either work home, spouses someone works home, financially protected student? ""no rain drop thinks responsible flood""

You're right - person wants justify special contributing mass death going around us. People give holidays person one year. technology spend time physically present. They're selfish pricks. personal dooming? It’s truth. think like crap? 

I think listened podcast said. Yes, article he/she posted essentially said “well, get complete protein plants, except B12.” Ok, well that’s complete nutritional balance need supplement since body cannot make B12 naturally.

I actually think optimal diet mostly plants high quality animal proteins (salmon, high quality beef, chicken, elk deer hunt, etc.).  Bats wuhan still chillin. *Big beans* things reinforce beliefs helpful Destroying lives point people go commit mass shootings kill better people dying anyway? lose/lose situation bud  think two things mutually exclusive.

I think governments approve vaccine, set distribution, reviewing data. asynchronously time comes give shots, ready waiting inoculation centres. Look I'm cool calling 40+ million conspiracy theorists, change fact they're refusing wear masks cult leader told whatever insane contrarian reason. thing, know Republicans give shit. mean anybody eyes see this.

However excuse peoples behaviour.

If Trump / Governor told murder child would you?

Of course would ridiculous. behaviour Government Government Officials absolve person personal responsibility.

Far many people absolving personal responsibility comes pandemic.

Yes Government response utterly pathetic stop person best maintain social distancing wearing mask possible.

Things anywhere near bad US people actually took responsibility actions. Yeah, weird prevention measures prevent stuff used survivors mating selection. dead. I’ve tested many times point doesn’t even bother anymore co-workers sure shit don't. people wonder want go grid ditch society... know. noticed many people seem understand meaning days. 

In reality takes 14 days 90% deaths registered. 

It’s difficult discuss situation constructive way aware this. sort proved point though. people least one nutritional deficiency eating meat, deficiencies bound get worse eat plants. Interest rates low really isn’t anywhere profitable put money stocks. lot long term holdings moment prior COVID. 

Not expert that’s take it. tried one last week failed. stripped punishment passed week. ""mandate"" absolutely enforcement requirement follow it. enough mayor pat back. heh yeah widely advertised. People would 100% start taking seriously knew caused ED. though flu?😁 live like fucking 2022 would rather drop dead right second No. Nothing pandemic customary, though- lot activities driven anticipated high demand. assuming body stores amino acids available pull. understand don’t need every amino acid every meal, need eventually vegans run issues without good amount dietary knowledge. People welcome eat however see fit, huff post isn’t going exactly convince veganism optimal diet health standpoint, might moral one.

I don’t even like factory farming. making effort hunt fish meat coming year. trials tested kids? assumption kids super spreaders impacted much adults. therefore kids catch us old heads get vaccinated virus nowhere else go?

as parent two younger kids winter brutal..no indoor play dates gonna suck life us. state university system (New York) testing every student go home thanksgiving. finals virtual holiday. return til February. No, need everybody permanent immunity control pandemic. need enough people long enough immunity. far vaccine results studies common reinfection (it definitely happens, seem super common) indicate that's probably achievable. want speak CEO plague rats, megachurch place wanna go shaming people congregating groups part problem? Getting defensive problem honest. Maybe large family, know. hard eat different times different rooms. ""Enjoy bunker"" asshole thing say. trying shame someone socially distancing pandemic? Please get life bud. hope okay, ""just getting bunker"" gets family members killed, well frankly damn fault. Dont think theres farmed mink alive right now. culled attempt exterminate virus. Never time like retail workers much leverage. could shut everything get whatever want. squandered. Organize, unionize, get fair share. Stop waiting corporate throw bone. never going happen. I'm Sioux Falls area assure almost one taking seriously. mention fact get bunch Minnesotans Iowans flocking go eat whatever fuck else want rules here. makes Kristi happy tax revenues stay high, care covid guess. Agreed, hydroychloroquin bleach excepted. becoming clear one winner vaccine race. multiple actually provide enough world. long work? 2 minuets? new nasal spray addiction way Yea I'm sure endless drama social media news influence anything, cancer. personally taken care couple patients caught twice. caught April/May, October words: No, gut feeling.  Everybody hard time it, states seem actively cheering virus on. Become ninja

win/win live county seat 30,000 people I'm perfectly happy here.

Shockingly every region outside New York LA looks like Dodge City circa 1890. systems go 100K hospitalized turkey day saving ultimate Thursday record breaker. disaster long ago.

Now turned train wreck can't stop watching. Facts facts. dead body sight, Worst apocalypse ever! give crap .4% fellow Americans, cool! Vic health also weeks late action, (SA) jumped right month long lockdown think true hopefully delay better treatments available; safety measures worth around whatever measure control mean stay home. curious saw NBA games virtual audience, wondering NFL would same. truly sad. Especially people medical field trying get everyone listen. Stay home, wear good mask, wash hands....

It's immensely frustrating. bless lucky stars live here. 4 short years every flaw American system character amplified laid see. biggie...  mean, big shift think Sweden's early approach? Lena Einhorn: — compare neighbors really good handle this, mean, Nordic countries, course, step forward. But, know, schools open. **We face mask recommendations society all.** People still gather en masse malls. They're advised — prohibition restricted public gatherings. that's ... mean, restaurants still open. looked really good middle September, weeks school started. knew herd immunity, still sort dragging feet. now, last weeks, we've dramatic, steep rise cases. **We steeper rise United States right now.** 

Those two parts bold shocking. still recommend masks? small, wealthy, relatively well educated country like Sweden manage outdo US terms rise cases? shocking thing see. don’t want work want free money gov. looked up. He's 89. Maybe we'll get lucky final rest? Peaceful though Welp, seems know talking about. Looking forward seeing info released publicly months see increase effectiveness occurred.  0.1% Anyone know available kids much lag time behind first rollouts? Bear mind projection 7 day average. still would equate wearing seat belt. 

You try time wearing one day going crash.  Instead, play safe assuming could crash time, making best efforts avoid wreck.

That said, think odds exposure quite high. Biontech developed pfizer manufacture scale Except they're tracked time nameless companies cell phone data freely available real time traffic data. That's true. I'm gonna keep wearing mask washing hands that's control really. Fingers crossed !!! No, they’re asking Futbol games...  part another ""IQ test"" proctored psychiatrist training needed experience administering reinforced opinion they're mostly pseudoscience. Way many uncontrolled variables draw meaningful conclusion tests. BTW one took like 8 hours something involved sorts tests. support statement. shows judges disproportionately male compared state population. 

That mean woman, one criterion mentioned, makes less representative state. fact source she'd representative source puts men half population.

Also source she'd better representative nonwhite since lists white less 50% population.  March called company covid hotline report COVID attending mandatory business trip across country. told go work next day ask manager do. 

Shortly after, HR department called me. said got report come work. needed talk supervisor come work. 

My supervisor okay’d working home. told rest team work home. 

HR called 20 minutes later. said shouldn’t spread rumors tell anyone COVID. told supervisor wasn’t allowed work home. said that’s fine I’ll wait two weeks. said no, need take covid test can’t EVER come back. 

They didn’t allow take covid tests March told phone hours. told mom me. mom freaked phone hours. 

After three days called doctor asked lie say didn’t covid. could work home self quarantine. What?  Mid 2021 good chance. Summer northern hemisphere likely pretty good. guess mentioned traffickers head Mexico somehow misread mostly come Mexico. Honestly made mistake misread that's part would need apologise. Yeah wife quit already. funny thing job already done telemedicine covid. basically takes consults multiple hospital emergency rooms. want continue coming office hospital. Why? bill insurance facility charge. Fuck that. 

(Also everyone worked home 6 weeks height 1st wave everything ran fine.) Yeah grew fringe Christian cult I’m fan organized religion days. I’m okay less intense groups. Like live near Hindu temple they’re much less organized? come by, pray/leave offering, that’s it. attempts convert anything. chill. wait January 20, 2021 drastic changes. now, own. 11,000 eh? get n dirty Chicago seems. masks, people wizzing streets get train, touching handlebars whatnot. bet cleaning crew calling ""sick"" work, lazy. saw bit April July, link? wedding postponed June kind big difference 😭  I'm talking violations emergency health laws refusal respect authority basis valuing individual freedom communitarianism collective benefit community.

Clubland entertainment district speak themselves. point glaring public violations emergency health laws restrictions gatherings socially liberal, ultra individualistic west end.

Enclaves like little italy little portugal exception rule comes dominant cultural ethos west end course. Absolutely yes. Especially considering winter warm untill point roads bad midwest. Could imagine pileup highway? Part problem teachers union. wouldn’t come back unless deal made 3% positivity. mean tell don’t think it’s really enforced all. Similar ‘fines’ wear mask public. wrong? Seems government either lacks ability spine actually enforce policy COVID. trying dick either. controlled way people make out, we'd US style politicisation compliance.

BS. climate-change denialists whipped frenzy murdoch hate rags. targeted Victorian premier charge pandemic response reporters ground trying drum anti-lockdown panic bunch fkwits protesting masks past six months.

murdoch hate-media cancer. Hey, that's yours, Alberta too! wait hear water cells!  Ebola contagious.

COVID-19 much greater problem. suppose preferred cable ""news"" hosts selling BS. taught new thing today. suppose even antibody-levels get low, infection detected, body produce particular antibody response, huh? fuck supposed mean? Ask 2021... Hopefully.  hope too. mean that. Nebraska reported yet either.  Yep. gave texas back july. tested Thalidomide 20,000 people. How'd work everyone? don’t blame kids slightest. I’m actually trying learn something forced remote training it’s almost impossible me. can’t learn way. So, stupid evil? would dumb rocks believe reality situation. understand serious surge is, purposely playing dumb, pure evil. sleep night. It’s willfully taking action, knowing this, people die. crime humanity.  'normal' India, example, stay parents home get married. 26 year old living parent America, people would call him/her loser.

In America, whole bunch 30 year olds moved back parents pandemic.  He's guy decides close beach Jaws shows up. Please Floridians, vote douche out! Holy shit. utter lunacy. would say Scotland, ""you're good cunt then"".

;) NPR pointed types jobs El Paso “essential” citizens going often increase risk exposure spread. Shoes, bruh.  plans gets vaccinated first first come first serve? IMO - weird anti-vaxx stance - would sensible ensure vulnerable key workers vaccinated top priority, start trickle oldest youngest demographics. know virus affect anyone, think healthy young people allowed sign certain percent vulnerable people vaccinated area.

The reason say/ask otherwise I'm imagining insanely high demand long waiting lists/lines get vaccinated, limiting get done initially seems like good idea ensure people need actually get it.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* rest canada bad heard? what's *special* manitoba? imagine, properly coordinated motivated, could lot more.

Reasoning:  


Obviously, vaccine requiring ultra low temps special handing would present special problems. poor people draconian measures. /s  *Covid-21 entered chat* Current head CDC Robert Redfield appointed 2018. fun facts: 1980s Redfield worked closely W. Shepherd Smith, Jr. Christian organization, Americans Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, ASAP. group maintained AIDS ""God's judgment"" homosexuals, spread America weakened single-parent households loss family values.  \- ICU: 15,350 

That's just....crazy, even country big U.S. Everything seen regarding Corobaviruses mention slow mutation due “checker” virus’ replication phase prevents mutation irregularities. feel like we're getting pretty close point everybody know somebody that's died covid. Pfizer vaccine going available Covax? difference. Without Covax poor countries left dry. plan continuing wear masks, dine out, attend events, etc. issue that. since March.  Montana...only teachers healthcare workers contacted. ....and?  think fools raise cattle. cattle worth dollars, would impose quarantines businessmen make sure new animals infect older cattle, one herd infect other.

Probably use vetirinary medicine science track herds keep infection heck well.


Sadly citizens South Dacovid dont dollar value governor.  Nextdoor, someone constantly goes ""don't scared 99% survival rate"" understand can't get knee replacement surgery. 

I've grown exhausted trying explain they're connected. Tax churches. Crazy thing smallpox inoculations 1% death rate. Still better 30% death rate came smallpox   not. tests per day average number people tested one third total tests.

It’s joke. goal keep testing 10x higher true infection rate ND never tried reach people realize also doctor patient confidentiality. get tons video footage patients ventilators ICU beds even general care beds... get videos things south America handful countries medical ethics modern countries, take shit seriously here, can't go hospital film people dying even blur faces identifying information, straight illegal.

I friend text yesterday saying sorry hang hospital. information her. time tried call back phone off. Another friend worried asked could call find hospital OK. Nope, unless immediate family, can't prove family even tell patient dead OK even hospital, medical privacy one things take extremely serious hospitals... \*Aerosols hang air hours. need cough sneeze create aerosols! tbf, also said data Ohio incomplete, yea, disaster  30000 higher last Wednesday. fact big brain government tried ban vapes banning cigarettes never fails make die inside.

I would imagine would easy would do. I'm guessing time far fewer vapers smoker, plus public backlash smoking ban would much larger. Tasmania almost banned people born 2000 smoking happen :( False 

Last week 144,801 least clarity? real, though, sometimes chronically wife well. 

What said rings true. Federal Government would prefered went way USA. nothing background majority state governments made hard decisions close shop. incompetence manitoba much America, typical Texas judge today typical Texan. non-Hispanic white male mid-to-late fifties. appellate judges judges courts general jurisdiction well many judges courts limited jurisdiction must compete partisan elections. recent years state's judiciary become diverse was, group judges remain unrepresentative state's population. 83 percent judges surveyed non-Hispanic whites who, 2000, made 52 percent Texans. 72 percent male, though less 50 percent Texans male. 13 percent judges Latino less 2 percent African American though groups constitute 32 percent almost 12 percent population mean that’s typical narrative countries rely patriotism keep people line. lot countries rely that, stability maintained keeping people seeing misery right front them. nice quick shot “America fuck yeah” ease pain. Lets let it. Imagine future delete Facebook right second. rest life worsened, improved?

I conducted experiment Spring need tell answer. Genuinely wondering, “at risk”, reason get this? vote South Dakota holding biker rally? get little live reporting television. hear numbers stuff, videos really going on.
Show world population non-believers fucked situation really is. Maybe works wake call.
Otherwise reporting feels like number reports African kids dying hunger. People can't relate that. Remember months ago everyone thought IHMEs forecast 400-450k deaths February way pessimistic? thought “it’s way overestimating winter seasonal surge”.

Well looks like it’ll spot-on :( larger caliber guns mentioned even gun chambered .22 long rifle. bit much think guess. Ohio report system glitch, overload cases, public health staff contracted virus.

Ohio reported 6,845 cases now, BNO site include them.  give sort perspective figure means, spent eight hours day counting amount people killed virus date America, would take roughly eight days sixteen hours finish. Let sink in, especially think pandemic “no big deal.” far I'm aware, COVID-19 relatively slow-evolving virus. However, seems antibodies make start falling around 6 months. Funny, read voice. wearing masks effective protect others infected wearer.

The studies *that* much weaker one. can't complain study bad, argue based far worse data. Fuck yeah did! Calling hoax way worse nothing. Republicans can’t even agree wear masks legislating...FTFY want lead way out? Maybe kids first? parents? mean .. that’s right thing do? I'm still confused think mix word ventilators. ventilator invasive noninvasive. beginning used mostly invasive ones. use lot noninvasive. regions like Stockholm even using noninvasive ones invasive. I'm sure done ICU though. logistic thing something. also explains patients staying shorter time ICU compared spring. So....after Thanksgiving restaurants close?

I smell deal business community this. KN95s good N95s they're real, people sell fake ones overseas designation meaningless US know get dragged People's Court it. Yeah, people *still* getting it, seems... hope get shut policy change masks work masks work.

The policy change masks work, harm. Rapists murderers get healthcare. point makes sense We're you, sociopath. Apparently give shit Lions fans may POC elderly. pre-existing condition. almost die disease? returns, maybe Drs. Nurses RTs refuse treat seems concern medical professionals. Delayed closing borders? alone shows way depth trying describe actually happened? talked ad naseum still posting fake news. Everyone slightly follows news, whether left right, knows democrats fought travel bans border closings month.

He ""fight"" mask orders. something national level. follow individual state covid updates, many governors like ""no thank you, national rules wanted, we're thing,"" includes state NY.

The ""didn't help NY get PPE ventillators"" thing maybe March 25th 30th, first weeks this. watched every update NY since live here.

Schools, positivity general hitting 3% schools 0.19%, sure getting ""schools safe"" from.

The part vaccine political rhetoric. know vaccines testing. politician would want come office, far unique worth mentioning.... Amazon 64% year.
People can, spending money. Waves hello end another road NT. feels here. surprised many healthcare workers care anymore. Covid fatigue real. I'm EMT nobody wear masks unless covid positive call. details update Twitter relaunching completely new model put together past day estimates true infections US 50 project, nowcasting (what happened) rather forecasting (what thing tried standardize calculation positivity rate example, many cites test positivity South Dakota, model estimates true positivity rate closer read model uses confirmed cases testing data @COVID19Tracking
. death brand new project, still kinks/bugs, please patient. I'm also working put together write-up always appreciated.  think important acknowledge whole new class vaccine (mRNA) also developed, tested, used first time here. They're completely different past vaccines. least Moderna, transparent publications peer-review technology. 

There absolutely could long-term side effects especially adenovirus based vaccines. healthcare professional researcher, absolutely taking vaccine available, recognize risks real many colleagues similar concerns. Yeah living takeaway right? keeps popping recently, #3 quite time now? single virus also taking forms cancer heart disease right? broke one type each, wonder C19 would be? Also, 10% daily cases deaths lately coming El Paso alone, despite area 3-4% Texas’ population.

Any idea wtf that? El Paso primarily older skewing demographic, something else behind it? keep seeing really high numbers never really suggestion whats causing them. See also americas current socioeconomic crisis Thank pep talk!! Livin' Libertarrrrrrian Parrrradice Reminds hyper inflation:

When poor, know inflation eating salary, purchases, savings. That's can't help spend quickly

When rich, investments ETFs real estate rises inflation Ever Quebec though? happen US Europe (Or Americas). mask associated negative memory Covid. think people would rather forget. would like PTSD people. Everybody know cannot wait wear masks anymore. Every government organization politically influenced, especially director politically appointed. CDC traditionally science-driven apolitical relative pretty much govt organization. It'll nice back that. Sounds like belongs hospital, different ward.. would agree, would also argue study better research masks, almost entirely based observational data.

So really, can't conclude much subject.  right there. seems like getting worse everywhere now. worst rates awhile. exactly sure stand now.  Yuppers, every person sure. Make sure include malicious people like staying home responsible big guy  guy’s unemployment run shortly due Covid...and Republican belief plug ears won’t hear country collapsing.  disaster one state doesn’t stay location.

Please. Next you’ll telling us we’re American states, united. socialist trash. 

/s (Just case)  idiot.


Too dumb listen science doctors.

And yes places seeing increases.


South Dakota 1,006 new cases.

With population 884,659 that's equivalent U.S. 371,851 new cases.

Not 160,000 had. exactly irrelevant, since talking lack RCT mask use general public Covid, happened across first RCT done mask use general public, gotta say peak relevance. hope response [Cherokee Nation] demonstrates tribe means,” Pivec told reporters. “It’s collectively caring one another.” Powerful words. right disgusting. prime minister went Donald trump school pandemic control. would fucked too.

French laundry me, thee

All jokes aside, anyone surprised? Rich gonna rich. time Cyberpunk 2077's release whole country hard time. Even liberal states. think point stands somewhere COVID widely distributed probably preferable get spike protein spike protein + rest Labeling people soft core anti vaxxers legitimate scientific concerns isn’t really helpful, addressing concerns help way more.

Sure. I'm trying shut questions down. course risks introducing anything causes immune response body. However think fair think vaccine risks running worse risks run actual infection - also includes spike protein, viral payload. 

In US least, starting look like gonna end spike protein system within next year matter - might well form vaccine.

That goes vaccines - diseases we've vaccinated suppressed successfully point percentage people luxury choosing rely low disease levels + suppressed transmission rather taking risk.

That said agree history immune issues pays careful here.  Ignore harder! whatever want bodies He's talking summer wants put scientists charge, pay people stay home, get beast control.

It’ll make interesting Christmas. So, matches headline exactly.
Got Oh, also [some stuff long door handles would safe (Covid really transmit surfaces)😂 understand pain, sucky situation. I'm conversation family now. said way think is, want spend next 20 Christmases parents want children know grand parents. Even risk relatively low take precautions, think worth waiting another months. Preach!! don’t fucking say. know either first ones. one, second one mild found incidentally swabbed prior emergent surgery. second sick oxygen. suggestions, relate. It’s hard. I’m hoping huge get together next year make missing one. Hold up. know maybe meat necessary survival (although really claiming higher cost high quality plant protein ramped instantly? Americans totally happy spend year surviving whey protein?), work closely people making PPE, mandatory covid restrictions besides essentially unlimited spending building barriers enable working together closely manufacturing lines (where absolutely necessary) minimal covid exposure risk.

There's multiple teams engineers idling, light design administrative work next production lines they're ready immediately address breakdowns.

They're also finishing building new lines, based long term federal contracts signed half year ago.

The federal government way slow response, things could better, meat processing plants building PPE infrastructure. That's aside intentionally dysfunctional federal supply chain management.

But total bullshit pretend meat processing plants prioritized PPE production. That's remotely accurate. see federal funding 10x expansion meat production, example. Pretty typical Oklahoma. travel often. mask sight. Worthless state. know used quotes appointments, old folks need see doctor pretty regularly. Ideally people feel sick getting tested regularly

Indoor dining? Visited friend? Went dentist?  Flying soon? — Get tested

To point ..... Yeah OTC obviously next step. Imagine supply chain hell pharmacies started carrying home tests now. needs ramp period punish people breaking law make law, like cover genitalia cloth public go jail. Hey. golden calf doesn’t pay itself. Understandable! I’m cautious wearing mask all. I’d definitely take extra care position! lot right going on, hope win. 

On another note: 19,500 hogs day??? idea scale operations. Username checks out. No, don’t. that’s headed towards Soviet Russia-style authoritarian oligarchy (without benefit “communism” least provide UBI massive percentage population unable earn living conditions. America seems forgotten must least feed house slaves wish exploit successfully. must also convinced slaves... nice job, 13th amendment! slaves US 1860... call “prisoners” shifted places house methods use capture them.) Title sounds like questioning action. install uvc system hvac like airplanes icu wards. coronavirus. every cold is. infectious recovered cold flu, we?

If everyone already infected always going infectious, majority us would already this. 

The CDC recently stated even need negative test longer end quarantine certain amount time since onset symptoms. done still going contagious.  You’re wrong dumb people going be, that’s sure punish ungrateful peasants loss faith election. exploited lowest common demoninator. multicultural country volatile fault lines pertaining race racism.

I don’t know country unite black men shot cold blood state agents, community subsequently gaslighted far right. Like gaslighted poor parents lost kids sandy hook elementary. House prices go waaaay Midwest. Problem colleges breaks semester this, college went late august 5 days week classes, 0 days off, thing happen spring semester, even since dont even spring break. Are- trying kill people??? could pay get plane right now. bunch strangers pressurized cabin breathing air hours? Might well go around licking door handles. People dying today probably diagnosed 1-2 weeks ago, number cases higher course masks works, especially situations social distansing impossible, like example om bus work duing rush hour. 

However, know people using masks perfectly. also take eating, drinking, talking friends, coworkers etc. allowing large public gatherings, sporting events, letting bars cafés open full capacity etc going problematic. 

This study suggests even wear mask perfectly, mask dosen't protect getting covid later spreading family. 

So masks work, mask wearing limitations human behaviour. Masks excuse social distansing. Idiot cop dumbass gaiter photo, lol. death cult. Flip predatory justice system back sue every one anti vaxxers, hoax believers reality denialists enter hospital COVID. Show freedom serving documents hospital bill. see dead people... well, thank you! Ok thanks!!! pre-print yesterday shows 7% people low immunity virus 5 months. Also shows decline overall immunity female population examined memory cell types. Yeah get another job. lot places struggling hiring still see hiring signs there! Oh wait they're big corporate stores like wal mart employee probably going facing issues. Congrats recovery! you’re isolation infectious. However, recommended follow precautions length immunity unknown, isn’t clear recovered person could contract virus unknowingly spread without becoming sick themselves. Lol yeah!

The doctors post suck make without adequate safety equipment. 

If states want stay open issue mask mandates, that's personal choice! Yes true citizens this. think important leaders (like president) encourage words lead example. know superficial words effect. help booster morale encourage. that's least doing. leave extreme example. always wonder, instead bickering suing spending lots time social media (this lots people parties) would happen elected officials used resources problem solve. levels government access experts, funding, legislation, think tanks, media do, maybe could get creative. would say want fix followers Satan. 2 months get it-I longer wearing mask public. would need anymore Italy. There, said it. Well I'm trying take every precaution ahead holidays. We've always small family everyone waited later life children (so extended family dead). Dad works 80s, mother immunocompromised. live alone, work office alone I've little contact anyone since July.

I would go big gathering family social events though. risk great. close 46 gets sworn Simple solutions. Task forces inspect businesses, firm guidelines, actual fines breaking them. problem journalists rarely know translate study article, people know understand science speak gets quoted. 
The absolutely sure publish kind guidance takes studies, lot specific ones (no one study virus spread community back Wuhan, problems studies west really possible till march/April; nevermind tests die mean study stuff needs written takes time, bulk Asian studies published may, finally time). said ""we can't sure yet"" used scientific language that, politicians intentionally misunderstood. WHOs faulty used language decades times worked perfectly fine... 

What exactly mean panick buying? Food supply stable know never real shortages due pandemic (which say never empty shelf refilled quickly alternatives available; eg yes canned soup still buy fresh ingredients need soup).

Man, that's good point. agree here. ability stay home/work home stay safe/keep kids safe way. people outside heavy lifting here. Let vaccine first. Yeah, exactly worked butcher's assistant got eye industry. lot big grocery chains moved away onsite butchers, instead factories full ""meat-cutters"", basically assembly line butchers trained cuts. call ""meat-cutters"" instead butchers exploit loophole butchers still strong union.

Those factories mostly immigrants ex-convicts.

Like, wouldn’t suffer consequences alone. Anyone misfortune crossing paths danger mRNA...very...very new science. right mRNA gene therapy ""vaccines"" (I think time mRNA drift called vaccine called gene therapy), comparisons, AZD1222 comparable older trials. mRNA's full effects probably stay unknown long time, stuck appropriate answer ""I know, lot possibilities"". think happy ending...you paying attention  mean, possible, daily new cases basically flat since November 6. Stopping exponential growth first step that's done. situation still bad can't think region anywhere (regardless policy policy inaction) that's sharp increase simply stayed there. There'll decline like everywhere else. Deaths continue rise 2-3 weeks past case peak decline well. YES, telling people months. person touches nose lot want protect fomites WASH HANDS frequently wipe every single surface!

This spreads people! Sure, also spreading virus. course less testing = less case therefore one even reporting = cases! Hooray! want refund federal taxes past 4 years. jokers qualified run country. oh no!


anyway get you’re saying, believe do. It’s joke think government overreach isn’t coming ANYWAY technology that’s already spying NOW. right minute need encroachment protect us MUH RIGHT people clearly don’t give fuck continue propagate thing experts Europe want wait bit longer get accurate data it. extra weeks/months waiting make big difference, especially means learn vaccines.   see. suppose article would attribute part ""not bothering"" cognitive dissonance 😄 Iirc flu shot takes around 2 weeks start working. good kids trains immune system.

The goal January year finish losing weight husband try conceive year. stress eating March - May pushed progress back we’re working making reality future. meantime health goal. I’m way sedentary work home mix shoot 16 hours fast anything great. eat way fresh produce too. Broccoli, Brussel sprouts, various salad greens.  Smart leadership.

Who gets said vaccine approved, priority go people long-term care homes, hospitals group settings — similar flu vaccine. Literally news article. peer reviewed sources claims?

Anything outside noise cannot substantiated one way other.  likely won't. long term immunity study suggests 93% detectable antibodies natural infection, prevelance memory B cells cells even more. likelihood, chances reinfection low. enough people got vaccinated, covid would turn endemic. likely. ""unique patients"" unique within week's testing populace, people tested positive re-tested one two weeks later would positive unique tests, added confirmed cases again. would like start?

- Reduce lockdown fatigue

- Build immunity among low-vulnerability population

And got accused wanting people die. 

We US, result people burned lockdowns there's effectively zero immunity America aside east coast. get double whammy lockdowns less effective people vulnerable. standpoint water, certainly. 🙄 one ""healthy"" adult could potentially infect dozens high risk individuals. Bonus points asymptomatic mildly symptomatic infected period. also worried, since requires two doses 28 days. I’m worried people gonna get first shot, go wild and/or forget second dose, basically we’ll huge boom. Fucking trump screwed us, lives many people Yes, can't build concern whole many individualistic self-concerns. Trump building said burn, he'd die fire rather walk door admit wrong. coming post damn thing. nothing considered mitigation now? bad Trump think many people's beliefs would changed someone else charge. amount people I've heard say Bill Gates started Corona micro chip everyone insane. lot people believe Bill Gates using 5g putting cities. One day week small rural county highest infection rate state. amount begging health department wear masks moved pastors members mask up. poor behavior lead outbreak county's largest nursing home prison. virus become Science vs God. say, God's people get sick die. take God coming heaven putting mask face, would agree God's wear mask. lot preaching science people staying church. believe God created everything man created science.

Obesity increases risk, Americans obese. going include high risk ask get first? Young people lowest risk, makes sense last. hand, they’ve also main vectors, inoculating early might actual “herd immunity” like benefits buy time get vaccines high risk people.

So, don’t envy statisticians figuring out. That's matter political will. could enforce it. Well full shit, immunity lasting long 3 years rare immunity lasting 4 months occur. 

So ""hate comments stories prove optimistic things"" actually called facts. Strangely voted March saying 225,000 dead november vaccine commonly available early 2021 best taken fact too. 

Here. Read claims. Maybe eating two full plates cranberries stuffing cures covid - know try!  many people world small idea like us germophobes. That’s wanted acknowledge joke since people pay far know $3k would actually go long way right now. joke made sad type out. Everything broken. Emergency vaccine market different others, companies need incentives inactivated virus vaccine -- old school stuff. unlikely result serious adverse effects.

Shit sandwich! Trump vaccine. Need worry real winner.  1:29:58 - States request - min 1k people Pfizer vaccine, 100 Moderna. Basically anywhere? need NPD mitigation efforts bar demagogues public office. Cases Ukraine surging rapidly well.  mean, crisis pay areas pay helps. hospital offering $105/hr ICU nurses $90/hr ER $70/hr med/surg nurses. Normal pay $30-40/hr range full-time nurses here.

Not diminish amazing people coming help is. people make career getting rich chasing opportunities. makes easier think way vaccine comes huge part vaccinating public protect vulnerable like people undergoing cancer treatment newborn babies cannot immunized. People opt 'human rights' whatever bullshit spout failing duty protect vulnerable could kill someone. get furious people get flu vaccine every year. 

Hopefully governments private businesses step up.

Okay, say so. /s Yeah user threads named says they're immunity specialist consistently claims reinfection going norm. I'm sure person knows they're talking about, hope long lasting.   


What think ? good links post cheer First off, takes time get REinfected... So, there's first mistake. can't base math today's numbers... knew already.

Second, many millions cases virus sequenced? Or, many millions case could possibly sequence virus today wanted to?

Your bad faith argument silly pointless. feeling okay? Thank kind stranger silver! lol Pence Redfield **really** pushing ""schools safe kids can't spread virus"" myth Again, misinderstand.

You idea lengths steps hospitals gone order prepare different scenarios. 4 levels preparedness plans, months preparation.

During first lockdown, zero elective cases. Everyone home. weren’t. educating ourselves, reading, developing protocols, getting innovative had, got ready.

That said, surges still tax system, provider numbers drop, nothing stop decline care provided. That’s fact well documented.

That said, whatever admitted irrelevant. prepared, governments, federal local done next nothing. people grossly negligent, end day makes situation worse us.

Just wear mask. right. dumb dumbs can't patient. lockdown 2 weeks! see well abstinence sex education works can't shut fuck stay fuck home??? fact people get tested positive STILL claim fake probably baffles most. seriously doubt making family visits Thanksgiving self-quarantining afterward.

Masks vaccine greatly help slow spread, wished society states welcome former, makes worried society deal latter. anti-maskers anti-vaxxers also help keep spread going, vaccine balance everything start seeing reports getting sick admitted hospital history masks thinking fake?

I’m sure school work probably mandates like schools past required get flu shots, everything else, wonder plan be. Keep wearing masks stores even you’re vaccinated? Hope best, especially it’s confirmed vaccine town/county? Treat life like way back February main vaccine everyone took flu vaccine?

What interesting next couple months we’re for... Yeah know end. long, cold, dark winter looks whole lot easier vaccine end it. also assume vaccine 90% effective vaccine manufacturers accurate say make 50 million end year billion end next year, we'll double since currently two vaccine candidates good we'll 100 million end year roughly 200 million month next year. 

that would cover every senior citizen world point i'd imagine would done masks distancing.

if US gets vaccines rest world (which theoretically many prepaid) would relax earlier. i'd say 100 million arms full vaccine would time remove masks since would encompass every senior every front line worker, soon would preexisting conditions pretty soon general public task force supposed something group people lecturing us?

Thing don’t stay inside 24/7 even guidelines place... free leave house, increase size personal bubble, plan outdoor activities, wear mask. Totally understand. hope vaccines horizon end actually sight. That's hilarious hand, could reverse this, like imagine massive airplane disaster year happen barely anyone traveled.

Or, since virus keeps inside, likely caused people get online dating find way, found virus thing. Interesting.

Our instincts care survival species, individual. *barely

Ironically, I’ve done lot barley year form Scotch. It’s new obsession me. Love stuff Right keep mind natural infection also account 10-20% immunity time vaccine becomes widely available 2021. even half worlds population taken vaccine winter, that’s hitting herd immunity. 

Secondly, official numbers plummet dramatically. worst outcomes come vulnerable populations. don’t need worry hospitalizations, official case counts significantly drop off. Keep mind possibly half infections experience symptoms. 

My expectations managed. Lol. kind testing kept white house safe right? Dumbasses thinking testing perfect hilarious me. infected test positive 4 days, tests help little. going happen. Many police departments across county specifically said face cover police enforce health orders Sherlock. many people starting run since many still March since they've job. course they're counted unemployed now.  bet depends who's office. one side trying help, trying pass laws can't sue employer unsafe work conditions. Weather actually big one 
A months ago asked question Indians America Canada brought weather one 
For many coming developing countries I’ve heard racism actually worse Europe USA 
And people outside first world believe it’s actually easier start business like it’s encouraged answers I’ve heard think well aware suggesting US kind vassal state UK. Perhaps like engage *actually* said?

Otherwise, there's really good Radiotopia podcast Constitutional Law US called ""What Trump Teach Us Con Law"", hosted constitutional law professor.

There's couple episodes called ""Quarantine Powers"" ""Jacobson COVID"", like look better understand powers government suspend certain civil liberties pandemic. people did! fully attended rugby games New Zealand right rates nonexistent. People understand, rather argue stuff suck wear mask religiously six weeks beat thing down! no, apparently mask mark sheep people defiantly alpha they'd rather demonstrate mah freedums keep us soup.

Sorry, frustration always ready boil topic rn. outed entire conservative party everyone trying come US programmer? 
I'm speaking generalities US terrible minimum wage employee protection laws. Worse many countries. 

Sure easy get money training logic, money training, other, empirically better countries also accept you. know point hand smarty pants high school kids, would nice short project  DM estate sales. contractors coming construct small unit property company said workers tested positive COVID. Obviously, ones tested positive going working, workers may contact (not sure whole workers assigned per project).

I’m pretty sure it’s way simpler that. I’d say it’s “masks annoying, virus can’t kill me, don’t care people die” narrative. governor following people want order stay favor constituents. might way get boomers relinquish control country.

I'd ok alternative. hour ago, Facebook acquaintance posted media hoax. recommendation areas delivery slots available. everyone country. god monks gotten covid 

Damn. think anyone would able socially distance avoid virus, would! Totally agree. see friends family continually increasing recklessness understand to. Getting sick now, states huge surges, put incredibly long lines get Covid tested, maxed hospitals already rationing care. Two weeks worse (look graph, plot lines 2 weeks now). People increasing cautiousness. Ay KarmaPharmacy, upvote prescription bout filled! Maybe could get wigs look like swap places, want fuck shithole. wait? Send distribution centers around country park outside hospitals receive shipment asap worked isn’t coronavirus done then?

Most likely, ex-wife might one ;)   work. talking about? Cases dropped significantly places locked down. opened early without proper additional precautions many places cases went back up. Countries like Australia New Zealand locked down, contract traced enforced masks basically eliminated virus point. I’m sure you’re getting info. speak area. speak mine. saying areas available slots this. arguing much? aunt died Covid today. careful. grocery store months (she used delivery service, brought things her). Nowhere without mask. everything right. 

My aunt wonderful lady. ran animal shelter county many years. Rescued &amp; rehabilitated countless dogs. person genuinely made world better place. 75 years left yet. died alone hospital bed, gasping air, scared confused.

I wish people would stop think they're killing refusing listen science, limit exposure, wear mask. official position government, germany, February wear mask to.protect others. 

And Germany great job combating covid? Ha. 

Telling people masks protect people dumb strategy. message beginning masks protect yourself. make people willing wear one. misinformation thread galling. Testing PCR positive multiple times equitable reinfection. best could find. that's 'gotcha.' bad mask *increase* risk susceptibility. Rather, failed protect 'better' good one.

Penny saved = penny earned. penny spent ≠ penny *stolen*. Shit, Sherlock... 🕵🏻‍♂️ Lol definition gave you.

It surprising expect see change interventions within 5 days, time PCR test could increase 7-10, whole argument bogus. 

I think agenda, literally told would liked masks work, evidence stacked them. 

Masks become pandemic recycling climate change, easy, help whole heap.

Start talking proper interventions like isolating distancing. Dude, heck kinda bug crawled butt?

Most people do, fact, follow rules road, wear seatbelts, car insurance, **do drink drive**.

What kind people associate think things commonplace? wrong people? efforts?

I never seen administration try hard spread damn thing. would think COVID-19 votes Republican, way morons cheer on. So, tested positive March Ireland, November US, everyone house tested positive, exact medium symptoms first round, tested negative 3 times. According doctor, quite possible test looking new antibodies already it, may trigger.

So, medical perspectives, we’ve twice, concerned future false negative may give me, potentially, members household false sense confidence.  Canada deals place buy least 20 million doses two companies.

So we've ordered least 40 million doses. Spreadin disease- authentic Thanksgiving ever! can't come explanation based direct gender bias.

A man 3 times likely receive intensive care, 1.4 times likely die. Covid mind, weather is? headed for, then? tornado zone, earthquake zone, hurricane zone? Leaked panel final fight, think it’s funny see someone try hard get people read stupid

What’s stupid opposed information reviewed article

But overwhelming majority information covid hasn’t peer reviewed. opposed shared info don’t like? 

Do understand peer reviews justify narrative west didn’t fail response covid.

What opinion “west” east influential preventing spread virus? Guys behalf Amarillo apologize weak leader going gym regularly 3+ years prior pandemic, course u/PassionVoid knows better Remember video gym goers protesting closing working outside gym. still think video backwards was. Literally proving workout without gym. Minnesota metric schools follow. Went rush hour day soon. country might need truck drivers sure shit dont want us. dont think ill ever go back madness little late that. Anyone planning traveling Thanksgiving already booked flights made plans families aren’t going cancel CDC says so. theory people get sick develop immunity unfounded? mother law also nurse breathing issues. think gets either. far problems though works Hershey seen many cases think. room someone tested positive though minutes. think mask faceshield thing, least that's back May. believe all-powerful god called upon, wishing betterment instead worldas whole, least someone else, selfish least borderline narcissism. Especially ""betterment"" financial. health anxiety statements don’t apply mine. statements US law. doesn’t matter UK can’t replicated US. That’s problem, instead going like New Zealand beating Covid restrictions international travel we’ve patchwork half measures meant we’ve mostly successful flattening curve don’t overwhelm hospitals can’t lighten either without causing huge surge. People getting tired half measures don’t want comply try strengthen all.   Says man go gym regardless pandemic.  possible reduced sensitivity test. nurse give instructions? sounds like give good instructions. test negative, yet still feel sick getting better, maybe contact doctor advice. Saturday &amp; Sunday count days off? Europe *could* even faster, considering rolling review approval going weeks already.  figure potential long term effects covid worse potential long term effects vaccine. I'm vulnerable population technically rich essential workers, available I'm going jump right Thats infuriating! I'm extremely skeptical that. I've read couple small studies showing people damage mild illness. official stance still people 100% recover. symptoms lung scarring sounds pretty ridiculous. pretty severe pneumonia every virus existence get permanent damage lungs. way example, distance runner, could covid pneumonia still run marathon they're asymptomatic. I've brought people like ""well able without realizing Something wrong""... that's asymptomatic. People sub confusing hell. think need get reddit actually talk people:
- people follow rules road
- many wear seatbelts,
- many car insurance
- and, sadly surprising number people drink drive.

It called reality. That's whole rub situation. People want yell state's rights, states choose nothing stomping rights states subsidize them.

Fucking smoothbrains. say.jpeg fair, want move US none reasons. like there.

I'm Canada, I'm well enjoy it. like US (aesthetics) more.

COVID, politics, etc. non issues me. idk normally would agree FDA conservative it’s FDA approved it’s likely safe, think they’re getting pressured approve something higher ups? government work like that? presidency don’t know president goons capable doing. clear beginning seasonal virus come back fall. think that's bad, try imagine many meteors hit Earth given time. 94% planet water, extremely unlikely we'd even notice impact. one day, big enough meteor hit populated area we'll totally unprepared. look moon's craters. That's sign immaturity. One thing note, last two waves regional outbreaks greater NYC area March-May, South Southwest summer.

The current wave ramping literally every region nation. can't send supplies, equipment, manpower around particularly hard hit areas like since everywhere either getting hit get hit hard. show sources regarding cdc claiming lockdown kill millions? First I've heard that. agree lockdowns extended periods time cons regarding mental health also child development. Also curious background issue, seem speak fairly knowledgeable standpoint. world white collar workers, know two people went back - demanded it. Everyone else know works big banks, law firms, etc still remote. 

My point still stands. MLB players greater exposure March/April nature job me. I’m saying prioritize people necessarily, can’t consider fact entertainment important, wealth held them. Wealth also shouldn’t favor them. White House Chief Staff: ""We going control virus""

The Atlantic Magazine crew: ""We control virus""

Meanwhile numbers skyrocket daily.

I think analogy fits. 

If want hope.... hope end un lifeboat. ;-). 

I prefer realistic fairy tale bubbly hope spin. ten commandments basically morphed '10 sorta suggestions.' type thinking saying ""The house fire, maybe install smoke alarms."" people getting COVID-19 twice, suggesting immunity wanes quickly  some**

It's perfectly possible majority people protection years minority months. anecdotally, ppl socializing way more. see outdoor eateries, parties 6, 8, 10+ ppl celebrating bdays, anniversaries, engagements, whatever. There's way mixing households compared 2 months ago. I've declined half dozen invitations small backyard celebrations past month. think ppl got lulled complacency LA County Health announced huge surge Labor Day. Lakers Dodgers championship runs added gasoline fire.  fucking thundercunt. Thousands better 10s thousands. crossing (like truckers) spend limited time people canada. tourists visit many places interacting lot people issue. exactly border remain closed. They're Death Cult, think us seen various stories week deniers getting sick still denying nope Every single person know, matter diligent COVID, traveling. know crazy people traveling destination wedding Thanksgiving, people flying Midwest big family gatherings, know one person's older family members hosting 75+ people Thanksgiving tailgate. idiots aside, even COVID-safe friends traveling way see family partner's family. lucky live close home still got tested self-isolating anyway case. hate say, family far away, would still probably go something can't fully judge. 9 months this, many people seen family whole time exhausting no-win. think compromises, like going car seeing family member closer getting tested etc. Realistically, one going wearing mask inside eating/drinking/gathering. strong believer masks anyone else, I'm realistic. That's called recurrence, accounts symptoms patient well second time around worse.

My two rounds Dengue certainly were. I'm probably still immune Dengue I've told get unusual social reason happen know lot doctors (my wife one, dance tango), none know history clue suggest getting possible COVID vaccine. Probably not, one demanded neverending restrictions social distancing remainder life back then. California, northeast, Florida

No, fuck off. someone severe body issues due bullying throughout youth, I've using weights form therapy years. gym closed earlier summer, mind went incredibly dark place watched every thing worked disappear eyes. wear mask, wipe equipment using it, go alone keep distance others.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* ridiculous. 'Personal responsibility'? can't trust people make right decisions, need state government impose lockdown implement restrictions ASAP. works China. Stepped originally Abbott acting mildly sensibly (foolishly) assumed rest party would politicize pandemic.

And saw pops people like Luther got far right wet pants thought primary challenge someone whose entire campaign would ""Abbott made businesses close lost job"". feel way. care wants get doesn't, you, force inject something body. Ah.. even less educated generation.  think possible. 

I remember stats... something like 30% work... pretty bad anyway. link? *”When open public door I'll use bottom left hand door hoop figuring none one touches push door open I'll reach ...”*

Shit... too. really hope isn’t people train thought. Could end using part door getting contact. sounds reasonably safe. hear family getting together, mind goes like 15+ I’m like way everyone quarantining. would join gym right now?

It safe, especially people aren’t wearing masks. Seems premature extend till june 2021 though know next months bring Trump's greatest crime might actually making people believe politicians opposed somehow good upstanding people ..... politicians. Sure Sturgis bad going pretend probably 500,000 residents refusing wear masks almost year main source issue? I've dived profiles large portion seem dummy accounts spamming comment sections. Go Trump twitter comments see cruder version practice. Yup. Fomite transmission simply [not reasonable transmission mechanism real surface cleaning show, designed comfort people.

As respiratory virus, protection starts good respirator. train wreck long ago.

Now it’s turned category 5 hurricane end sight. tests also assume conditions absolutely trustworthy subject accept that. Who's say wait hour say ""actually decided give anything all""? said things assume way much way subject going think. May ask, ever taken flu shot life? vaccine safer antipsychotic drugs? Less safe? point, that's true everybody set feelings it, whether right wrong. beginning, plenty people claimed (and continue to) either real big deal. I'm staying apolitical that's point subreddit, stories news everyday folks dying think fake personally know many people who's families thought going disappear election since ""made up/exaggerated help election"". started people telling nothing got ingrained heads now. listed possible side effects yet? They're COVID deaths DAY flu deaths entirety last year. yep, keep it.

those slowly, one one, see results wearing masks.

just like seatbelts.

you get everyone, get 20% 40% won't. Hmm seems like show acreen. flu shot 15 years rarely get sick. comes Peter Townsend, Roger Daltry band? whew, worried elected officials. 20% growth ~25% growth last week. storm calm Good idea, rest US won’t get covid. True, Trump still 63 days feckless bungling left. Since police get decide fucking laws enforce not? total bullshit. Sheriff needs removed office. Idk would make something like know anyone easily lookup last Wednesday's number was.  \*second highest **world** Nah that’s crazy great look Pandemic past event.  say someone life antisocial would rather home ignorant. everyone wants live lifestyle you. votes comment go show ignorance others well believe same. Despite 3rd populous state, 8th densely populated state, 2nd traveled state, 5th oldest state median age, state 2nd highest percentage people 65, state 2nd highest total number people 65, even top 10 states Covid deaths per capita. that, despite fact Florida budget shortfall result Covid (as I'm sure states have), DeSantis found way fully fund teachers public education. even put projects initiatives chopping block budget cuts. 

I know goes reddit progressive hivemind, even early lockdowns U.S. Europe hold up. see they'd hold time around wave many times larger. Vaccine needed fix this, attempting lock population. People really interested abiding anyway, politicians sides included. lost minds. It’s ironic say “trust science wear mask” ignoring science. Everyone masking locality numbers still sky rocketing, forgot bigger picture. Count lucky 2 years undulating waves infection. lol. “Neoliberalism” 

Marx 75.0

Clever sounding 1848. 

Still useless 1848. one knows roll out. Get one quickly frontline medical personnel old.  correct.  clinical trials. long it’s choice it’s imposed ok Called it.

The ""re-open fucking *everything*"" push ploy make appear normal possible election Coronavirus number-one issue every voter's mind. “Piece cake” - America well would lockdown started anyway Seems unlikely. job wasting much lysol wipes right now. One hope! post removed because:

So. ...what waiting for? know on. usually don’t get sick (I get cold twice year, maybe stomach bug I’m unlucky) on, whenever I’m sick, I’ll wearing mask. Like really use find weird, feels like it’ll common sense out. Virus version Unus Annus. Less year hopefully end subreddit “delete” Oregon one lowest rates country (albeit going rapidly, like everywhere) 80% cases tracked “unknown”. even you’re trying trace it, gets widespread it’s everywhere. think coronavirus already infected politicians like ""pod people"" virus control brains. virus needs spread survive, commands human political hosts downplay pandemic encourage people wear masks, hold large weddings, basically act reckless possible. Thus ensuring spread survival. would make good movie! Haha too, adding doom message. Noem living March thru September phase much okay overall impact. number massaging absolute bullshit. We’ve 400 deaths last month half last weekend experienced 76 reported deaths. would equal 30k deaths weekend rate multiplied across US. fully aware failures point. Truly breaks heart. Stay safe friend see studies surgical masks medical settings. You’d wonder doctor surgeon would ever bother wearing hospitals spend money buying them. 

It’s literally throwing money away. Whatever, ain’t shit least February Maybe majority cases surging regions tend lean right? like said, everywhere go, majority people wear masks. yet see mass gatherings non-masked people stores. least 18 states I've work. tend impartial mexican black point view 

Or maybe partial Mexican black point view. thin line. Heartbreaking. That’s opinion too. People could wear masks wanted along social distancing gathering despite governmental order. stay-at-home order live, people didn’t stay home, people still gathered partied. Hell, people “lockdown parties”. honestly believe people gathered around didn’t anything else everything closed. r/thathappened assuming politicians states identical ethics. look DeSantis versus Newsom. Maybe nice folks south. Washington pretty competent people running show statewide level. I’m big city guy myself. Even COVID still enjoy good drive slightly emptier streets Toronto. can’t get car it’s nice place 78,242 beds according (removing neonatal, paediatric, burn ward beds) said economic issues go away? still happy bc need beat virus repair economy Still waiting independent peer review study data. information far (and sure legal marketing departments).  Jesus forking Christ bunny costume dressed Satan. THIRD CV TEST MONTH?!? work bunch inbred (probably red) antimaskers? I’m sorry you’re going this. It’s awful. 

My aunt likes argue “antimaskers aren’t Republicans. It’s democrats” every. Single. Solitairy Democrat know wears mask religiously. Religiously. don’t ever see Dems centers libs screaming “MY RIGHTS!” hate make political, is. Pennywise made way. It’s disgusting. Florida voted Trump, means approve things handled. Enjoy Floridians! Hell yes. wear mask...and invite bunch friends dinner, birthday parties, etc. least DeSantis upfront he’s careless asshole. 

Unlike Newsome pretends care really whatever fuck wants.

Same goes Lori Lightfoot Chicago. Correct. dont see need fans. Personally could empty stands like many teams doesnt affect enjoyment 95% reduction risk contracting virus. 95% infections placebo population trial. Right, forget week two. know i'm happy either, all, extremely dramatic insisting airplanes safe 7 days fine. I'll read article seems i'm fucked :/ live Texas received said text message yet.

I remember months election times receiving text messages governor Greg Abbott certain times telling us avoid going house another text separate occasion imploring wear masks public.   Yeah, nfl testing every employee daily restricting access, mandating mask wearing times except games field (eve practice). Announcers talk time necessary. Everybody forgot concussions ;) Plus improved... Look individual countries, timing restrictions, cases started going (or least growth stopped). Compare total cases pandemic. Restrictions much plausible explanation. don’t viruses usually mutate less deadly though, even reye Why... why. understand viewpoint family Thanksgiving. agree least get it. like... top. get it. know Reddit meaning you’re likely socialist believes you’re somehow superior successful people, everyone get vaccine. No, people die valuable skills do. Meanwhile South Dakota, PERSONAL FREEDOMS!
Also, biggest city state passed mask mandate. punishment following it? $0. police enforce it?! No.

Check 2 weeks see swamped hospitals doing! virtue signaling showing. Mass immunization people getting it. That's fair accurate view type people go Thoss churches. think religion hoax much next guy anyone favors misrepresenting them. 

I deny many behaviors may seem selfish certain extent narcissistic, absolutely mean people narcissistic selfish people all. dudes peddle tap water miracle life giving salvation? Sure slap label em. people go see agents God, want god work them, believe (and taught) faith rewarded. way narcissistic. I'm almost thinking switching doctors, office elevator access stairs typically open public (there's swipe card entry staff fire door alarm sound try use it). Everyone knew would case, even biggest lockdown enthusiasts going sit home forever  THIS.  former Arkansan, lack education...About 90% college educated people state agriculture spoon fed cush jobs daddy's friends, leave state go places like Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta, etc... get real jobs. Therefore, majority folks stay behind state generally low-eduated, non-STEM folks broad understanding science public health. 


And, yes. Schools still open, (fictitiously) churchgoers believe place worship anti-viral properties, state lax restrictions year long. one enforce it, nothing paper 1869 deaths US today Covid. terrorists would take 19 domestic planes day, 9/11 attack every day, show higher death count. Talk misplaced priorities TSA! doh... stock market acted positively Trump losing. market likes stability. I’m Seattle, mask wearing already still lockdown again, else want? get tested. way know sure.

Edit: sureish Completely, 100% agree. can't pull rug like this. 95% effective vaccine silver bullet enforce it? nothing joke Eating bat loser. Agree criticism, say “why must everyone else sacrifice,” kind minimizes risk involved, right? don’t see measures aimed restricting freedom legitimately aimed improving public health outcomes. Personally, sacrifice make don’t want die feel responsible people family get sick. I’d ignoring without consequence. There’s real enforcement level. saying people go jail kids taken away homeless? instead blaming administration. Probably one Trump stood front White House said going wear mask. Oh honey ""Scorched Earth, population"" RIP Macy stores depends black friday-cyber monday brick mortar sales grandma one pays church afford. family run church well (started dad passed oldest brother, one him). Honestly eyes makes worse. refuses lessen tithe can't even afford basic needs ""god punish her"". can't.

I'm glad congregation much help people worship safely. grandparents go church Savanna, Oklahoma grandpa isolating deer woods (yeah...) woman mask talking close covid.  Sure ya Found foreigner...get rational/decent logic outta here.../s  started quit way harder quit 2nd time goalposts constantly moved”

lol *fluid* situation. worst part refusal comply large part making things severe thus take longer/more severe response recover Imagine letting hundreds thousand americans die thinking **"" like ?""** worries! try nudge quit laughs hard coughs terrible smokers weeze like 20 seconds straight I'm awkwardly disturbed terrible sounded. looks goes, ""yeah know, know..."" love guys Let propose hypothetical let's say Fauci scientists right go enough vaccine roll April general public start receive long think need masks social distancing? feel you. think EVERYbody maintain distance widespread vaccine? Cause getting day approved. say downvoted? Gonna honest here. yet enough data topic come conclusion.

Therefore, play safe. Fuck. Wendy's? seriously tired goalpost running now. still one ten chance contracting COVID, use motivation continue mask herd immunity established case numbers crashing down.

It might take countries get vaccine right away countries morons refuse vaccinated. trying 

to spread virus Ehhh really bad awhile now. People take precaution thier see someone know get really sick die even government nothing. Data looks like leveling states. Losers create feedback cycle Leave internet? Lol.  someone explain curfews supposed mitigate covid? Serious question coworkers can't understand applied 24 hours day. everyone wearing N95 better

and would've too, used ""stay home slow spread"" back March April replenish emergency stockpile/increase production capabilities, instead, leadership spent whole time complaining restrictions, flouting rules, urging reopening. are. want 95% people right thing wear mask social distance, wouldn’t need lockdowns, MaH LiBURteEs understanding saw treatments listed Ventilator Treatment Invasive/Noninvasive SIR I'm sure media always uses definition. they? curious Lock district. got foozball play. playoff season, baby!!!! Civil liberties don’t include tours private homes. mean government. tell people Thanksgiving, really think that's actually going stop anyone? I'd fully willing happy wear one rollout happening generally available definitely longer wear one protect anti-vaxxers believe hoax. Totally agree this. People willing spend hours cold tailgate sporting events. Thanksgiving? loser can't sue winner even little bit. trying stay miserable forever. trying navigate dying time something stupid. common refrain amongst 45+ peer group presently “You don’t want like last guy shot end war, cease fire already occurred. stay guard end (personal vaccination).” Unfortunately economy, demographic lot disposable income. starting business today, would solve notion (some kind 2021 distance maintaining business). Fair enough disagree order, virus contagious hours. relief congress small businesses, wear masks keep open. insurance, duh. Lol Build barricade around building let out. Dude you’ve done insult guy instead actually saying anything constructive might change mind. don’t anything actually worthwhile say don’t bother commenting. think US least, shouldn’t spent last 40 years voting away social safety nets, wage increases, universal coverage. kind shit sure lookin good right now. talking ones make excuses wearing one mean mask alone outside. hanging definitely kicker there. Meanwhile Premier Alberta going private scotch wine tasting fundraiser luxury car dealership gets 2nd(!) period self isolation. people Canada too. America monopoly stupid point crippled isn’t makes bad. It’s irrelevant.  Fucking Christians. get wrong, behaviour caused atheist, yeah agree. extreme psychos far gone. “Christians” sure cast stones No, that's works, fewer hospitals changes would lead full, even few, hospitals.

See, need stop admitting many sick people. number hospitals, keep less full. gave link. google give similar numbers. don’t even like guy, dinner like 12 people. Criticizing it, justifiably, doesn’t mean safely start large gatherings again, lot criticism seems intended push narrative. I'm sure nobody think way around this. Good need sniffing people ignoring "" recommendations"" CDC, needs made mandatory jail time. Maybe give people dont wanna listen, incentive wear effin mask. much must suck uneducated rube. doubt anyone ever push back. Go vegan, it’s easier think. Yeah possible. Please inform friends contacts since Friday likely Covid, find testing site, self isolate get result.  Yes quarantining took test today. 


It 24hrs since exposed coronavirus saw Sarah, I’ve reading really contagious first day exposure. symptoms (a little diarrhea today nothing crazy). 


I’m concerned Sarah, feel like unlikely would contagious 24hrs exposed. Man would suck buy fearmongering much State obvious Don’t worry Macy’s, Amazon fill we’re locked down. Let's see peer reviewed studies back claim, I've sure never heard scientists.  Step 1 contract tracing success - don’t 150000 cases day. It’s also true practice abstinence HIV teen pregnancy. thought learned lesson public health policy based things that, technically iron clad solution health problem, won’t followed. makes things worse. They're docked Hawaii. holidays. I'm speaking silent minority cousin bangers. think idea eliminate people would entering store non-essential item. 

Or another scenario would someone knows need essential nonessential items would order online get both, turn eliminates going store. 

I thought seemed silly first think end goal people ordering online pick that’s best way eliminate contact people. Christian myself, seen type disturbing behavior different churches (you usually spot they'll ""noun"" church, dropping denomination name.) behavior invoke worship fellowship, rather set position blindly follow pastor sink money them. I've seen decent people get wrapped feel like they're forced continue they've got much ""invested"" church. know family puts money afford donate, gets water electric turned time time save. tell must feed feed others, falls loose ears.

My church never online worship Covid-19, we've moved online still set continue helping community outreach poor college students needy area. may fall deaf ears, implore congregations move back online too. God defender yes, Bible, Israel safe set watchmen. light end tunnel; we've got hold little longer.

They've state's restrictive guidelines since start. whatever government targeted well enough. ...idk much joking absolutely paying much taxes. Honestly that’s feels like. Granted paid I’m out, haven’t found much yet, seems unnecessarily long, especially get negative test back days. Based I’ve seen, description horribly apt. yeah thats id want see well can’t expect logic stupid. Making useless vaccinating people propaganda exists Canada, get fox news cable. straight nasty right, mention potentially law!

Ye like need told you’ve alive haven’t died yet, clearly shouldn’t get either! 

Your logic doesn’t resemble earth logic. could organize nationwide general strike. think you’re probably right. It’s hard imagine someone working full time job also deciding go way “investigate” legitimacy something like covid.   Lost generation one half year? Little dramatic. study itself, discusses many studies looked that. 

TL;DR: yes willn’t. understand point article wonder possible point get anyone change behavior. seems people deeply entrenched beliefs, attitudes compliance mask/social distance rules, good bad. Sounds like need pull bootstraps go medical field you’re triggered paid well, snowflake. guessed diapers like driving, whenever stop driver car next may make drink bottle grain whiskey. windows door locked might harder get make drink bottle, given enough time exposed drivers generally find way in. They're also going supply booze hand drivers come across future stops. mean? swab problem? would think wouldnt southern ontario. Well, killing hosts sort form control. places even adopt little stuff like wearing mask trying social distance, hard sympathy anyone healthcare workers. BS.

Willful ignorance dangerous fate virus mainly hurts people bad health, sacrifice physical mental health? can’t lock people year scared. everything within reason limit spread? Sure. comes point enough enough don’t live fear. Life inherently dangerous, everyone needs personally responsible health. know whether received vaccine placebo. wouldn’t blind study case. Retired healthcare workers? College kids close graduation? Import outside pay attract workers? Yes no. suspect person making decision even one profiting it; they're job minimize expenses care consequences. They're probably worried they'll lose job they're incredibly petty, that's hired do. real monster whoever set system gave bean-counters narrow mandate incentive discretion consider bigger picture. Someone higher food chain probably shareholder looking maximize value shares, can't bothered little details like spending little extra PPE keep medical staff getting sick. They're talking mortality rate, proportion deaths compared number infections. [very bad could mean number infections growing much faster.           
              
BTW, article written 2020-10-28. daily death rate going [since last 3 weeks, Sweden reported 439 new deaths, Finland Norway reported *in total* beginning pandemic now. science? Nothing. think funny see someone try hard get people read stupid non-peer reviewed article justify narrative west fail response covid. Using numbers, **recommended** wearing mask 3000, (I know said nothing, recommended wearing mask) 3000 others. Despite looseness connection probability actually wearing mask not, reduction rate.

Now would good counter study! One group told mask wearing allowed. control told hand washing allowed. Measure compliance, measure infection. /s can't rent retrofit buildings ductwork, diffusers, returns ceiling :(

We almost put one building years ago got value engineered :( Drama queen Actually it’s less common still viable form transmission. Ridiculous would fine harm themselves, want - also endanger others. Physical exercise help mentally. regular gym goers substitutes home going gym. However, helps, still get pump get heart rate up. somebody can't manage without going actual physical location gym temporarily probably overly reliant place source happiness. Mild personal sacrifice greater rewards future society. Lol least he's honest position. ""Who cares old people"" trying gut till friggin vaccine even take account literally zero slots delivery curbside even wanted to, always possible.

But guess I'm massive piece shit going store need food. US. landlord appreciated $1200. think magic bullet measures employ, far lax compared West. contact tracing case load extremely light. case load light, every case afford trigger massive response. One person tested positive, everybody whole floor work place requires immediate testing send home. Ten people got infected, government quarantine facilities. really - Florida outlier given data - clear chart. would like saying global warming/climate change exist one cooler average year. 

Plus, Florida's numbers starting spike. interested see chart weeks. Yeah golfing done!  lack federal aid (and lot instance federal government literally stealing supplies) makes near impossible state perfect. state could everything right neighbor state nothing people eventually spread state lines. 

Individual state responses can’t effective without coordination. hit 14 days? Fuck yeah post fight porn !

3700 comment karma ! Damn hard believe many people agree troll

Oh big bad troll telling people they’re morons prolonging virus!!! Basically same, something like 175k yesterday. either there’s stupidly high plateau testing hit ceiling. let go, *they payed fines!*

Oh, arrested opening salon. arrested violating *court order* close defied lockdown order. Abbot tried frame trigger happy judge crushing small business, Judge Jenkins went way give opportunities get trouble. idk tell  students refuse tested? happens? North Dakota here. SAY? friend spewing covid hoax medical professionals paid promote it. like ""Bro, I'm medical professional. fucking wish fake someone putting money pockets lie.""

He bring around anymore. Trump still denial lost election; he's busy sore loser give damn.

Capitalism (America) - appreciate hard work. Heh, that's county. Girlfriend's kid got sent home possible contact. Waiting test results worried minds. think lot don’t really option to. lot countries (I’m thinking southeast asia, western europe, new zealand, etc...) havé good part economy population completely reliant upon tourism. think it’ll get point vaccine &amp; cases down, open tourists. that’s speculation though. part agrees you, tf knows countries feel comfy letting people Hmm, one.. backpack kind dude. heh. Thanks buddy, hope burn too. Perfectly awful. Lansing native. Currently metro Detroit brief stint Mt Pleasant. We're hunkering staying TF home. Thankful jobs planning nice Thanksgiving 2. Curtis summer hope! well, stranger. Zen gardening pad Thai. Thanks Trump guess? Stop pretending Europe fatigued well . mean, that’s pretty much already US too. Death rates lag behind case rates, especially since treatment advanced. come. hospitals ND full. deaths coming.  Agree this. Good post! honestly think one day they'll find genetic difference capitalism humanitarianism 

Because possess single cell body think like much enjoy watching US burn

People actually dying dick. need fight global warming   Yet drop titty cock sun beach bam fine cover indecencies... different? 

Sheriff Matthew Johansen said, “We feel (enforce mandates) takes away liberty live freely Constitution United States.” Totally think it’ll still make difference long run even group isn’t it, large amount start adopting practices realize global warming going make matters worse... don’t happy yet, still got another war currently rely chunk people getting influenza vaccine every year, carries 60 percent success rate.

I think you’ll see getting vaccinated becomes regular, cyclical thing going forward.

Just saying means people assume one-time, definitive solution this. We’ll throw three-part punch 1. Extensive repeated vaccinations 2. Continued mask wearing isolation/ distancing 3. AGGRESSIVE contact tracing testing.

Looking like honestly 2-3 year process, *starting* vaccination scales enough widespread distribution. would give gold could afford Simple. people placebo group became infected. numbers infected small enough even 1 2 make difference percent two. It’s going fluctuate bit people trial become infected. vaccinated group; hopefully placebo group. Everything creepy weird ya'll. 1500 tests per day like nothing, lol ever back, wonder? There’s deep mistrust right now. Countries world closed borders restricted travel. lift covid?"
