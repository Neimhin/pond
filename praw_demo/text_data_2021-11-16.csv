Self care you, you, you! say _most_ things right early 2020. unlike Taiwan/China/HK/Japan/Korea we're actually mask-culture nation, obviously people would complain everybody forced wear one. government telling people first wear one unless sick supply issues.

Our supreme leader Hong Kong told us wear since trying push anti-mask law too. one GAF rush masks.

We know politicians lie, trusting without input then.   true. Children 1 higher risk. issue ""skipping line"" even technically eligible, coming nobody cares eligible.

This seems unreasonable. hospitals fine still using NPIs?  Michigan health officiala reconciling time high hospitalizations landmark 70% jabbed?

Because ""70% jabbed"" figure bullshit.   54% Michigan's population fully vaccinated moment: ""70"" figure comes weirdly skewed ""eligible, also age 16 - least partially vaccinated"" statistic clearly manufactured make look like idiots there.  Michigan well US average vaccination rates. They're really hard winter sound things. seems super random sick second dose Moderna felt almost normal booster. sore arm brief bout chills otherwise issues.  deer COVID now, unless vaccinate deer, it‚Äôs never going away. Interesting point view....

So reports people mild symptoms vaccinated hold weight you? Yes! It‚Äôs wonderful. great preventing infection, especially 3-4 months. 

But, worry. still offers fantastic protection severe illness! we‚Äôre looking infections less 10,000 per day (1/10th average daily flu infections 2018), think that‚Äôs pipe dream even vaccines. late June, US [7-day average bit 11k daily Delta wave hit. Oh no!‚Ä¶Anyway.. Lmao. Moderna booster fine, Moderna second kicked ass. new normal need government paid sick leave. Can‚Äôt afford miss 4 days work every year. Well‚Ä¶that‚Äôs disheartening.    vaccine effective flu vaccine. Yes, perhaps megaphone sound louder are. disgusted seeing protest common sense health measures worked decades.  Yep, definitely screwed us many levels. Like said knew virus bad said cause panic... 

Trumps administration problem poorly pandemic handled. I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs long time feel like crap.

Please help friends avoid misery encouraging get vaccinated (am sure are). You‚Äôre wise covid master now, might listen you.

Here‚Äôs hoping feel better tomorrow. No, I‚Äôm talking opinions Infectious Disease doctors studied infectious diseases entire lives here‚Äôs survey 100 experts thoughts this, February, *before* seeing waning immunity infection Rogan dig though! Although, I‚Äôve seen one little much here. Might time original material. absolutely use them. studies say uses claim. Giving mosquitos dewormer killing virus carry half time, isn‚Äôt use it. confirm. HEPA filters P100 cartridges respirators functionally meet standards filtration (capturing 99.97% particles 0.3 microns size).

Particles larger smaller actually easier filter. 0.3 microns know penetrating size.

It‚Äôs N95s kind default PPE kinds high-risk environments, they‚Äôre guaranteed catch 95% hardest catch particles, even easier ones. pretty impressive overall.

The real difference start talking HEPA vs MERV rating percentage particles caught varying size categories, flow rate, pressure drop, experience. typically mid-to-high range MERV filter decent job catching larger respiratory droplets viruses generally need travel within survive.  You‚Äôre vaccinated individual though protected infection. Illness disease isn‚Äôt new concept. People always working others means people always exposed illnesses work. Going grocery store puts risk one problem going there. 

Masks work can‚Äôt unvaccinated wear masks? we‚Äôre concerned spread aren‚Äôt vaccinated unvaccinated individuals tested weekly work place prevent spread since able spread? 

So propose parties work government interfering forcing companies force vaccine employers? Well, lot people dying infectious disease 2 years ago. one yet peer reviewed retrospective study 1200 women happened record menstrual cycles getting vaccinated sufficient disprove link.  would benefit information? Would advised delay booster antibody levels high? read guidance like that. could antibody levels anything I'm getting ass kicked fever? Thanks. Im definitely surprised - recall last month ""boosters necessarily needed healthy adults"" rhetoric going around CDC/news. cool, thanks probably make better life choices, oh well. hope didn‚Äôt spread anyone. Already done üòé Thank asking came answer  reason, never it. I‚Äôve never flu vaccine life either. don‚Äôt mind hybrid done right. WFH become lonely personally. Emphasis personally. way tell Health officials saying since vaccines rolled it‚Äôs likely need boosters 6-8 months out, new. We‚Äôre also constantly evolving situation, expecting things stay consistent going happen; example, vaccine much effective Delta became dominant strain. still highly effective, Delta variant blunts efficacy somewhat vaccine designed effective original strain. 

So yes, people 6 months last shot recommended get boosted light this. vaccine still important provides support, unless measuring person‚Äôs antibody levels, don‚Äôt know much protection waned. May well get booster safe side. Facebook say thought cured illnesses, used word. also resort anger name calling moment someone disagrees you, similar child, I'm sure sort discussion would go anyway.  found today Labcorp, even without order primary care physician.   Yeah, do. read hypercoagulation. Yikes! imagine good could done tax revenue!!! Well, answer - depends. two modes cooling plane (really three, whether plane using APU turbine, work via compressed air going air cycle pack)

1) gate auxiliary power unit engine - air provided external air conditioning unit sitting apron (aka tarmac). air typically drawn outside, conditioned pack, brought plane via big yellow tube see lying ground. 
2) gate APU engines - air cooled plane typically primarily recirc external air. 

The time air fresh outside air going recirc brief period time disconnecting external air starting APU and/or engines. typically couple minutes most. 

I note external air conditioning unit used, air recycle rate typically much lower air. lower pressure system. religion 'I know are, I'. Yeah Republican Facebook memes claiming cures dengue false. Go read book fucking moron. Singaporean. 85% total population, almost month now. 94% eligible. Trumpafarianism Stuck mask purgatory Portland. think we'll masking spring. Three vaccine doses later, I'm it. Makes sense!! places checking age, could maybe try? close 18! dumb excuse.

It's dumb people.

FTFY I'd say _most_ things right early 2020. unlike Taiwan/China/HK/Japan/Korea we're actually mask-culture nation, obviously people would complain everybody forced wear one. government telling people first wear one unless sick supply issues. wearing masks certain workplaces require it‚Ä¶what exactly normal point?! Depending gives shot. literally show CVS paystubs proving I'm healthcare worker get mine got booster soon could people appear entrenched. I‚Äôm worried rest semi-defeated diseases like measles going make big comeback, since expect anti-vaxx thing thing going keep metastasizing. got Moderna booster Sunday tonight first night nausea incessant sweating bay. IDK WTF happened sicker booster Covid month ago lol (thanks vaccines)  religion 'rules apply me'. Ppppfffffbbbbb.... glad I'm getting booster tomorrow. idea would that. Utah here. masks. vaccine requirements. restrictions kind. 
Lotta Covid cases though thought *general consensus* covid ‚Äúwaves‚Äù never going away

That's tv entertainer Joe Rogan YouTube comments seem telling us sure. guys done research! check antibodies first see still high?  87k cases per day trending upwards. expect booster kids, assume? Agreed. want 17yo able get booster, new case reported school multiple times per week. crazy teachers automatically qualified get booster high risk environment, students somehow aren't. didn‚Äôt get vaccinated?  Ivermectin antiviral applications.  Google read studies. People also know, get vaccine use horse paste lol. Dengue, yellow fever Zika them. Yes, commonly known parasitic uses, however calling simply ""dewormer"" meant smear drug. think cures Covid, I'm also scientist get sick people parroting hear media say. think would faired better vaccinated? thought general consensus covid ‚Äúwaves‚Äù never going away, lots covid ‚Äúcases‚Äù every year, forever? 

I guess you‚Äôre still waiting Anthony Fauci tell go back normal, he‚Äôs telling opinion right - he‚Äôs telling never, condition never going met.

Unless, maybe it‚Äôs time change define ‚Äúcovid case‚Äù. Maybe find way differentiate ‚Äúcovid infection‚Äù *case* covid illness. 

The CDC estimated 41 million *cases* symptomatic illness influenza 2018, 100,000 per day. Fauci wants 10% this, infectious COVID-19? Come on. Bad. big question.

No one long term data. We‚Äôre making best decisions we‚Äôve sold true today whatever think might happen future. scary. You‚Äôre alone this, you‚Äôre definitely alone suspicions it.

I wish could say something comforting, truth there‚Äôs long term data. convinced long term effects devastating others obviously convinced long term effects good. don‚Äôt think anyone prove it. think go things like character track record promoting option, see understand true elsewhere. 

Bless you, friend. May Lord comfort give peace. can‚Äôt offer data, here, offer comfort. may ‚Äúpopular‚Äù ‚Äúcool‚Äù believe real.

Remember Harry Potter? Help always given Hogwarts ask it. There‚Äôs reason rings true: 

In lifetime, Jesus always give help ask it. Ask comfort peace protection. I‚Äôll pray now.

It may turn much differently think. saw coming! knows future yet store. may yet turn around strange way none us see now. Hard say. Antibodies fade, that‚Äôs immune system works cellular immunity last long time. found survivors original SARS still cellular immunity 17 years later.  widen gap tho man. HATE Dentist lol. wear good mask. stores [Walmart] breeding ground Covid, favorite haunt unvaxxed.

Seems like statement wrong somehow. can‚Äôt figure why.    Idk driving office log onto Teams call supposed make innovative.

Boomer mindset. Check blood pressure *right away*. authorization code needed. signed booster CVS days ago. asked dates previous covid vaccinations. Try again. every 6 months oh man well least health worker philippines started booster States already ‚Äúoverruling‚Äù FDA. ""lied"" Walgreens like 2 weeks ago. Although technically I'm overweight guess outright lie. Japan proving advanced nation yet again! think that's pretty safe bet. mean got booster shot, assume vaccine card shows got booster well. 

I wouldn‚Äôt really concerned this. booster give protection, regardless records not. Thin, cotton, loosely-fitting masks proven prevent spread disease? Bullshit, check studies again. 95% people wearing masks wearing medical masks area. It‚Äôs theater. man money vaccine companies making must roof. Let‚Äôs make real change. Make big pharmaceutical companies liable positive RT-PCR tests could high Ct count effectively false positives.

young people particularly kids expected strong innane response infections may respond innately form humoral response therefore seroconvert.

a low infectious dose virus may also produce high enough viral loads initially humoral immune system may able prevent progression infection remains asymtomatic humoral response infection never stimulated.

vaccination stimulate innate response allows humoral memory response form antibodies created, consistent. there's nothing particularly unusual people exposed virus enough positive rtPCR would form antibodies expected. likely people *cannot* form humoral response natural infection -- send COVID ward without PPE they'd get naturally infected, possibly quite severely, humoral response form antibodies -- safer get vaccinated.

i know comment i'm responding though seems like picked word wrote decided go tangent. nothing comment i'm responding anything central point trying make. Right? It‚Äôs hard. CDC clearly signaling want booster go get one. Seems almost like they‚Äôre creating ambiguity strategy‚Ä¶for something. Control influx patients? what? Supply issues? 

Whatever case - door‚Äôs open, folks. it. did. words, resident highest level exposure experienced severe infection.

Predictable. Awful heartbreaking, 100% predictable. piece shit.

Hope mom minimally affected. Jesus save. actually bad money. He's also interested paying property tax churches.  shot history.

Our pharmacy checked. shots need 16(?) days out, qualify booster.

And Pennsylvania Pharmacy busy schedule customers every 10 minutes. 

Had zero side effects first second CV vaccine, Moderna. But, booster shot: freezing 8 hours, mild fever 4, pretty much ok. Exact Moderna. Felt super hungover day 2 first dose. far numbers agree you. we'll see. get back subject, 'detox vax' baths working out? amount (0.2 doses per population) likely small hit hurdle.  Excellent point. know going happen but....

Eventually Texas going collapse weight stupidity. NSAIDS associated greater covid complications. wouldn‚Äôt take them. now. never getting better right now. I‚Äôm honestly excited yellow fever part. people can‚Äôt take current yellow fever vaccine therefore able travel areas yellow fever vaccine required. Maybe option people. high entire fucking point saying pick. both.

What seem get I'm talking risk contracting covid I'm also talking spreading it. cannot tell someone covid far comfortable room wearing mask.

Show source says vaccinated better preventing spread masked. something conflates riskier behavior unvaccinated individuals masked. room someone contracted covid contagious better vaccinated masked? entire point advocating still wearing masks vaccinated people start engaging risky behaviors unvaccinated going start see massive surge cases (in many places already have). They‚Äôre basically making available everyone. seems like they‚Äôre quietly - probably keep inflow control. 

But anyway - took guidance mean I‚Äôm eligible got mine week half ago. Wife high-risk job anxiety catching Covid so‚Ä¶  poster confusing idea may mucosal immunity upper respiratory tract SARS-CoV-2 all

Confusing *with what*? Also, could use better punctuation capitalisation. Ehhhh reactions less pleasant. said keep hospital I've got issue going often needed. many boosters going receive realize doesn‚Äôt work?  know either. guess stated issue cut dry. Plus start talking dishonorably discharging entire states worth Guardsmen realize big Army going media shitstorm hands, like idea all. - like, going bother trying find many killed/damaged this? responsible. Thank goodness don‚Äôt feel terrible! Means vaccine worked! Asking important questions add everyone else. US offering 6 months. Israel offering 5 months people Pfizer vaccine. So, definitely due. (Edited include Pfizer)  They're thinking, religious. Yes, there's good reasons hopeful six month booster last years. knowing yet, bad math! Ain't something!? Quarantine strict. many ""important people"" given passes skip it.

Mass testing true really hated cube open office. felt like worst worlds. Heh....I'm saying cannabis cure but...it certainly lot benefits! coordinate meeting Australia, Europe US. gave Australians bad time lot less them. like 11PM time. feel sorry support staff India, work US hours basically night shift there. And‚Ä¶ still open tourism world. Lol. Cmon japan. Let‚Äôs get going MD dropped state emergency gave powers enact mask mandates months ago, there's really legal authority anymore.

Local counties issue mandates, legally probably hold teeth. People mask anyway, continued mandate went away. people state take seriously, except apparently Garrett county. nobody really lives anyway.  Another word Germany Schwurbler . true.

That money goes DoD State OK guard training duty  constitution allows it. room full ping pong tables never saw used. I‚Äôm work, I‚Äôm working don‚Äôt want waste precious free time playing ping pong. Oh please no.  Nevada still ""exiting"" Delta wave. stories FDA going approve Pfizer boosters adults. saying worth it? mean, I'd damn. Ouch. Let‚Äôs LA next please. We‚Äôve 4 weeks without mask mandate since beginning. likely multi-month interval lead much, much longer protection, like childhood vaccines. minimum interval Hepatitis B **four months**. JnJ found doubling antibody production increasing interval booster two months six months. Seattle, San Francisco, Vancouver. require proof vaccination masks. It‚Äôs getting way much.

It‚Äôs time mask mandates end. There's strong reason believe booster much longer lasting effect. durable vaccines minimum intervals measured months years. Pfizer studied 3 weeks wanted approval soon possible, emergency. even realize qualifications. scheduled one CVS website, walked in, got it. Merck's pill molnupiravir quite remdesivir. nucleoside analogs remdesivir works polymerase inhibitor slow replication. Molnupiravir codes multiple different bases introduces nonfunctioning mutations replicated RNA.  even due covid, mental health issue qualifies said CEO working home.

The head department announced would returning office. asked moved texas ride pandemic. said no, going continue working home. tried say would time catch podcasts commute. People started fuming quickly ended meeting saying he‚Äôd take everyone‚Äôs comments consideration (he didn‚Äôt, we‚Äôre still going back in). vaccinated booster yet still pretty good chance actually contracting Covid 4+ months since fully vaccinated. 

The vaccines effectiveness keep getting covid keep severe covid hospitalized get different numbers months. 

Johnson &amp; Johnson small fraction efficacy even Pfizer Moderna vaccines efficacy 6 months far contracting covid goes. need like actual cop this. Enforcing law retail workers public transport workers job. antivaxers probably claim it'll give yellow fever... doomed  witness rights. references claim? America bad Yeah. Awful timing. got Moderna three times rough. one claiming masks don‚Äôt work

Your comment reads like did. would prefer ""have booster"" question ""have flossing twice daily"" day week üòÇ Yea, means testing boosters disastrous mistake. Terrible planning communication. We'll see gets approved Merck's pill UK authorized adults. loophole imagine orders. second *are* orders though they'd required.  maybe would possible researchers combine covid booster vaccine usual flu vaccine single one too.

they're moving direction people want sure. would take pill gives COVID???? here, though little severe. took sick day. frustrating excluded community AGREE community. Thank kind words. vaccine lower efficacy well virus eradicated new virus surface causing mass panic, rinse repeat body absolutely produces circulating neutralizing antibodies blood response natural infection vaccination

[actually possible people re: natural serosurveys identified antibodies nearly 100% persons RT-PCR‚Äìconfirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (5). However, recent studies shown seroconversion rates surprisingly variable (6‚Äì10). example, multicenter study Israel reported 5% participants remained seronegative despite positive test result nasal swab specimen (6). contrast, seroprevalence study New York found 20% persons positive RT-PCR test result seroconvert (8). Another study Germany reported 85% confirmed infected COVID-19 contacts failed develop antibodies"" reason graduate Cal got drafted first round. lack degree nothing intellect.

He go Butte JC poor grades either - seeking D1 scholarship.

That's college pro sport pipeline works elite athletes.  Holy hell I‚Äôm immunocompromised, told them, gave booster dose moderna. didn‚Äôt even know could ask full dose.  go get another booster? It‚Äôs month. Completely fine. drugs stay body long time, like coke pepsi; they're days teach body covid looks like. like switching coaches maybe. Nah, fine. might gotten brief fever next day. Felt little crummy 3 4 hours only. Yup, voluntary mask wearing thing anywhere people want wear masks faeries I've met does. unbelievable... get slate vaccinations part guard? school board meetings Like, ever. You‚Äôre quality zero kidding That's going happen anytime soon. People refusing flu shots greater numbers ever before.   Can't adults already get boosters Canada?   need both, data clearly show covids r number drops 1 fully vaxxed populations

We though never be. plenty people already proven would literally rather die get vaccinated. US currently 60% vaccinated shortage vaccine available. Lots anti-vaxxers already caught trying fake vaccination status. federal database connected easy use app website verify vaccination status. Many places supposed check either glance card even bother check. Enforcement reliable.

Then immune compromised vaccination little. also children young vaccinated, whose parents let cloth masking estimated efficacy around 10% vaccinated Pfizer showed 20% decrease covid transmission infection..

Cloth masks kind masks N95 KN95 masks readily available long time substantially better preventing spread infection. everyone wore KN95 better mask correctly would far better vaccination.

Vaccination protection also wanes significantly, thus need boosters. article linked even explicitly states saw significant rise transmission time. people ""vaccinated"" almost year point I'm sure decrease covid transimission longer 20%.

Point being, clear cut vaccines prevent spread better worse masks. example picked worst quality masks compared vaccine efficacy starts wane, great comparison. nowhere near level vaccination case numbers need masks anymore. Yes almost exclusively due anti-vaxxers, unfortunately seem like changing time soon. brings important reason keep mask mandates; even places ""required check vaccination status"" still can't confident actually enforced, see someone wearing mask not.  Well, US could stand take lessons selfish culture sure. think went overboard selfishness, pandemic really shed light that.  unfortunate know exactly look patterns folks ignore it.

I'm also sorry loss may well - I'm saying won't. assuming will, know every decreasing trend line turned around *some point*, baseless. Drawing conclusions case rate expect even sillier. husband ran marathon mask Midwest humidity. Sorry you‚Äôre weak.    Let‚Äôs say someone took Moderna vaccine. take Pfizer booster, fine?? live Missouri June pure Delta. kept screaming people kept saying hospitalizations. went asked deaths. hit finally seeing case counts go up. late thousands upon thousands died. can‚Äôt wait till deaths rise start mitigation. last time felt hopeful right finally got vaccinated emergency surgery felt safe that. 6 weeks safety one weeks spent hospitalized gallbladder. I‚Äôve lost family thought joke they‚Äôre dead can‚Äôt come back that.  deadly flu much flu season tax medical system compared COVID? 1. Yes

2. mRNA better another J&amp;J dose. Talking doctor always good. Hospitals definitely fine.  Cool fuck everyone parents grandparents risk? adult enough try protect people fucking loser figure already did:

Look household transmission studies. likely people test positive know exposed COVID long periods.

We absolutely know vaccination reduces risk contracting COVID even high risk situations (like sleeping bed someone COVID) people keep spreading unabated. could easily get 10,000, rate need idiots die it.  someone upvote use subjunctive, upvote ""innumeracy"". seen number memes simply pointing Pfizer made billion dollars vaccine. wanted point sold billion doses. sell billion anything, profits going look huge, think product budgeted less $1 profit pop? understand pfizer vaccine costs government $NZ18 dose, even Pfizer say ""we'll sell cost"" make huge difference. ""constrained"", meant antivaxxers limiting factor rich countries, vaccines widely available promoted countries months. Poorer countries antivaxxers too, also lots people want shot can't get it.  Australia went hard heavy lockdowns recently masks. popular stopped widespread carnage. conservatives banging drums saying need look US guide open up. Given picture painted, wonder planet living on. Stay safe there. Lots places showing something like that.

Among things, COVID precautions greatly lowered lot risks, like way risk life driving work every single day. People die cars often one cares anymore. Given it‚Äôs 3 week old, likely 50cm height, 10-15cm length. Well, say anything yet, though.

You first need case outside classroom. spread, effective.

But good wearing masks filter - school doesn't. several positive cases classroom already. always glad 5pm received letter saying 'there exposure kid's classroom'.  47. That‚Äôs old family member was. pre-existing condition hubris, like yours. he‚Äôs dead.  NY's population strict vaccine mandate restaurants shopping. EG: vax card, eating restaurant 8 million NYC residents.  community spread level significantly lower majority America it. 

While I'd love position, think risks rest country somewhat different given pronounced lack vaccine mandate. ""who going pay that""? Cases increasing places mask mandates high vaccination rates vaccine passport system. See: Europe. 

Virus gonna virus. Well, side obviously right. guess depends pick sides.  wrong. seem hell bent hard way. understand correctly, Biden much favor boosters early on. mean following CDC guidance would exactly call backtracking. 70% number based on? mean... good you? Screw everyone *has* lost people, guy a-okay! I‚Äôm sorry sounds likely infected. takes (days) infection tests detect virus. 5-7 days exposure recommended wait time tests.

That said, probably won‚Äôt feel bad. immune defenses previous infection help. overall numbers weighed ""common clay New West"" living rural areas. everywhere, yeah, know, least things better cities. mind blowing. I'm California inside store without mask since April 2020. county said expect mask mandate least January 2022 Cult Ignorance think it‚Äôs going happen eventually one way another

All bleeding stops, eventually. Colorado fucked turism skiing feared headed tracing data New York State suggests rate COVID-19 exposure low - one percent retail shopping, travel going restaurants. extremely high household social gatherings 74 percent  ever tried run 10k mask on? feel like waterboarded sweat.

Bummer. Never seeing friends faces public big deal me.

Where isn‚Äôt possible? it‚Äôs possible world. become endemic then.   still get dirty looks wearing mask sometimes, year half. kids mention one nation pledge, dont think live country. Sorry got downvoted - don‚Äôt think people realized saying *are* immunocompromised.   Moderna demonstrated longer lasting protection think that's immunocompromised.  Hard say seem report here, statistically speaking probably low. again, tough know without numbers. Here's useful data Wisconsin:  doubt people let be. People social. won‚Äôt fly much longer.  There‚Äôs bad weather, bad equipment. Layers work magic! least stop plowing roads well, that‚Äôs need cross country skis.   Local minimum? Humans disgusting. animals  Same! Ended 10 times longer thought possible. I‚Äôm sorry. side you‚Äôre wiser now. irrational relatives probably going irrational covid. know audience. Tay! way things many years. I‚Äôm LA County. two glorious weeks didnt wear masks Delta hit. March 16th personal 2 year mark. million years never would believed gone told going happen March 16th, 2020. housemate tested positive flu yesterday. Kicked butt 5 days so. It‚Äôs definitely already.  dad get tetanus shot days ago, asked pharmacist whether get booster, I‚Äôve pushing do. wasn‚Äôt conversation, apparently pharmacist said wasn‚Äôt eligible (he‚Äôs 60 definitely bmi qualify, plus mild heart issues). Yeah. 

I got booster weeks ago, parents genuinely surprised eligible, assumed weren‚Äôt. messaging really isn‚Äôt clear people, unfortunately. could better. weary though, city hospitals may fine, cities may high hospitalization rate get filled, they're going fill city hospitals next.

That's issue California. metro cities fine, rural hospitals getting packed. Like, interpreted ‚Äúonly CDC, FDA‚Äù Oh yeah could see intended! U.S. COVID cases need fall 10,000 day

*Hey Google, many COVID cases reported America yesterday?*

""According yesterday U.S.A. recorded 87,133 cases COVID.""

:-/ dick convince anyone merits argument. Nope. get back 10k cases day, what? restrictions used get 10k lifted there‚Äôs enough immunity starts spreading again. 

Life get back ‚Äònormal‚Äô, health experts call it, enough population immunity. happen vaccination and/or natural infection. Probably combo lot people given know protection wanes groups.

It‚Äôs insane still push notion mask social distance way pandemic. measures temporarily reduce spread, made sense vaccine. basically everyone access vaccine. fuck waiting for? God magically make Covid less infectious? totally opposite experience visiting San Diego. 

I‚Äôd say maybe 10% people saw wore masks around point felt weird wearing mine stores. didn‚Äôt seem totally irresponsible considering CA vaccination rates high seriously weird coming LA/Ventura masks still mandatory everywhere. 

In Ventura mandatory 8 weeks passed children‚Äôs vaccine authorization, also seems reasonable.   work? stance masks changed?

Or getting feelings out? wild. stop store seems 90% masks. Stop different location store 20 minutes away. place seemingly never heard COVID.

Go early morning? masks.

Stop afternoon work? masks.     think 70% also previous variants.

Sadly, delta, figure reach ""herd immunity"" around 90%. (Population immunity vs. disease R0)  realize Covid slightly deadly flu population right? exception elderly similarly compromised.

Can enter places normal stuff mask go maskless must present ID vax record. hope god ends population. Seriously. Fuck this. one reasons still deep mess Yeah unless lunatics go vaccinate absolutely necessary.

We know respiratory viruses lasting sterile immunity them.
So getting boosters reduce transmission protect lunatics clog hospital's necessity point.


It's kind unjust. Protection death still high, even 6 months 2 doses I'm visibly part major risk groups

You look like high blood pressure, cystic fibrosis work public medicine? That's said. Stop putting words mouth. July bunch people know fully vaccinated caught Delta got pretty sick started wearing mine indoors again. wear one walking outdoors unless near people yeah tons people wearing nose Oakland. sure First Friday sketchy! worked October one stage area packed barely mask. yes definitely get booster - got JnJ April well got booster October (Moderna).

Check information mix matching buddy:  Obesity contagious. kill two weeks. done them?

I‚Äôve worn mask social distanced‚Äîeasy free life-saving measures protected thousands people deadly breath. done? That‚Äôs easy say you‚Äôre going it. Health experts say wear mask close every business- covid go away! Roughly double month ago.

It's yet another repost commentary single, unreviewed preprint, never made status, claimed natural immunity superior, massive body evidence contradicts single outlier.

Yes, you, them, antivaxxers promoting myth. better. confers protection, everyone, better durable vaccines. Reddit isn‚Äôt limited US residents... far I'm aware, Pfizer released data 3 days 5 days, careful extrapolating far, given decrease efficacy 3 days 5 days 89% 81%, seems reasonable assume there's still pretty good usefulness even 5 days.

However, point, there's obviously going diminishing return damage already done. Surely Simon Thorley co crossed line - bad science, malicious misinformation - Auckland University needs sack save credibility left. Normalcy: hey! give us little bit, coronavirus literally solved sensible business life restrictions. Doctors! people die everyday obese.

Meanwhile town, 60 miles south Seattle, indoor masking around 50%. holding anyone accountable clearly worked well Bay agree worn mask store except warily July 2021 fully vaccinated requirement lifted. Lots people still thinking time (before Delta) Fauci said vaccinated need indoors anymore. Ever since full mask indoors, even gym (which really place find annoying). admittedly still understand many people 1. Wear mask walking outdoors much 6 feet *anyone*, 2. Wear mask inside nose, renders useless. antivaxx energy. Moderna JJ got go ahead boosters weeks ago, mixing matching. Anxiety counts too. mental health issue whatsoever counts. Thats consistently normal thing last 2 years see you. Don‚Äôt let downvotes deter you. group insisted everyone stay home protected tell stay home they‚Äôre vaccinated. Human selfishness I‚Äôd like work get back normal. Wearing mask 16+ hours day sucks ass. politics make rules, scientists. yes, Corona virus definitely political thing. Lol, okay buddy. I'm California got mine. seven months since #2 thought would wise time Thanksgiving Christmas. There's many reasons want avoid mild moderate covid. data risk considering exclusively hospitalizations death. scientific debate needed mild moderate infections.

They also approved 90% population arbitrary difference excluded.

Ignorance like messaging dumbed much first place. Obama balls pandemic definitely direct cause inflation. leading cause shipping backed world wide created massive shortages. stop wearing masks, think pandemic inflation go away? Also, think economy collapsing would better temporary inflation we're currently seeing?

We're hoping one gets sick again. We're hoping get well 9/11 every week disease pretty preventable. COVID become 3rd leading cause death US less 2 years. think wearing mask normal, 750,000 deaths fine? Numbers drop one week saying ""get back normal."" That's everyone back June, we're double deaths again. People saying exactly saying since April last year. want go away? Wear mask, get everyone know get vaccinated wear mask 2 fucking weeks. flu vaccine really wrecked nothing covid vaccine, nice  Well actually Japan masks mandated, people wear them. state business normal (as long don‚Äôt need go hospital spike) since April 2020. saying it‚Äôs right wrong, been.

They seemed much concerned sticking Biden Fauci announcing wanted boosters everyone evidence piling months action FDA.

If equity would immediately turned around approved 90% population meeting? Husband son get boosters Thurs. got mine 3 weeks ago. Pretty much every one family booster already. 

We flu shots beginning November. 
Still wearing masks. Hopefully keep house. right CDC says no. Here's Everyone still considered fully vaccinated two weeks second dose 2-shot series, Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines, two weeks single-dose vaccine, J&amp;J/Janssen Please talk professional (PsyD). help gets worse untangle. area? pretty heavily vaccinated area hospitals still ‚Äúfine‚Äù. Well see sounds like there's way increasing hospital capacity nigh-on impossible every stage get nurses selected trained, either that's really case, something gone seriously wrong US health system. Merck first, though.  10,000 reported yesterday MN alone. Gah. live California well haven‚Äôt seen mask awhile except sports arenas Yeah remember going home Depot without mask like walking intol store nude

Then got used it.

Then say naw jk, put face cup back on. lot long illness viral origins, including cancers. reading article sounds like nothing vaccines - fired refused return office ended work-from-home. claiming vaccine related ??? know Gross Profit Pfizer 89%?!  Makes sense wear masks grocery stores gyms restaurants.  got Moderna booster week ago. smaller dose first two. 

Immunocompromised people get third dose (booster =/=). Maybe Pfizer 3 dose approved vaccine? republicans working directly efforts stop even slow virus.  *Cries Central PA* mask vaccine situation BAD schools give a.f. either anti maskers anti vaxxers school boards, superintendents, etc.

I mask everywhere barely go anywhere. Thanks! I‚Äôm glad studying instead saying booster good enough. hope continue work Delta-specific vaccine future variants closer Delta 2019/2020 variants.  wish vaccine could cure whatever makes people fucking dumb. Nope UK 3 month gap first second vaccinations experienced big decline vaccine efficacy 5-6 months. live highly vaccinated state, friends one fully vaxxed, already boosters nurses.

So far total TEN tested positive covid last two weeks. Two ten boosters. Id put mask back you, im I'll put mask back instead waiting covid test results come back ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

This far many people let guard guard all. understand narrative. 

What life back normal? things closed? fundamentally alter lives? Besides mask mandates *some* localities, things back normal majority western world. 

Honestly believe we've hit floor. People continue get sick, less people die thanks vaccines. society collectively decided social stability important driving cases costs. It‚Äôs built culture. struggled accepting first foundational American life. don‚Äôt agree that‚Äôs reality.  thought well start controlling feeling confident pre-March 2020. I‚Äôve always thought equivalent Tamiflu flu Covid would essentially would cover bases. People unvaccinated would able take ASAP hopefully feel better people vaccinated breakthrough cases take feel better. Hospitalizations would decrease, less conspiracy horse pills would used, confidence would hopefully rise again, etc.

I pretty much took break sub news Covid general it‚Äôs felt like current method vaccines going smooth far. We‚Äôre way deep vaccines even boosters taken pretty much anyone now. Mask usage seems so-so unless actually required certain places. pill probably vanish entirely. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll see articles dash hope progress we‚Äôve made vaccines, overall feels like things getting better making possible pill cherry top.  know places there. last two months besides Pennsylvania I‚Äôve spent time New Hampshire, Vermont, Denver, CO. NH strictest mask rules still able participate activities wanted to. wish anything one country thing instead 5O states things differently. Thanks this. wary reductive interpretations data complicated, poorly understood processes. wanted know well-understood thing heard sounds like no. friend covid ICU nurse (yes superhero, stepped early on)(she also made bank puts unreal) said body job, mounting strong immune response vaccine, drink lots fluids worry it. :) Yeah, eyeglass store yesterday everyone (employees) half-ass wearing masks. Noses everywhere. Even one doctors came talk receptionists lowered mask talk. bit annoyed.

Even wife scenarios made decisions made year ago. rare, make mistake, even gets exhausted this. Me? don't. I'm ESRD, can't afford lax - even location rates quite low.

I get exhaustion though, we're working nearly two years now, simple vaccination anywhere near permanent. kidney problems, I'd probably willing eat public indoors. There's vaccine mandates that.  stick outdoor dining - even winter.   Or...this floor endemic, already functionally terms societally altering. People get sick, less people die hospitalized due vaccines. move forward. time even got close summer. still get 10k cases day 7 day average. around 85% 50 older. let's say problem old unvaccinated people. Let's make vaccinations mandatory people older 50? get antivirals early 2022 it'll fine. ammount Bezos equivalent finding quarter couch.  Womp√ó1000000000 don‚Äôt think people ready drastically change culture disease relatively low fatality rate especially vaccines available. best moments entire life live music, sporting events traveling. think big disconnect younger people people older, families aren‚Äôt interested big events anymore state went normal two weeks closed down, proceeded hold world record per capita cases week straight original, delta variant. thing wasn‚Äôt normal Jackson, Memphis, Nashville kept mask mandates bit, governor trying force schools abandon masks. Leaving besides completely irrelevant comparison even true make point really mean anything all, kind source making up? find numbers specific drug, [average Pfizer R&amp;D spending per drug almost 8 billion [their entire marketing budget, mind many drugs pill, likely somewhere 2 3 billion Right? absolute disconnect reality CDC ridiculous. Florida makes tenth every day lmao old they, 5? Shit, state 7000/day. long way 10k nationally.  vast majority people dying voluntarily. 1/100 best case scenario population 3000 students. (insert number here) students dead completely acceptable you? Sounds like something Monster would say. patients also becoming harder deal with. unvaccinated, while¬†[some didn‚Äôt choice often belligerent vocal. Even they‚Äôre hospitalized, resist basic medical procedures like proning oxygenation, thinking fighters, become delirious, anxious, impulsive lungs struggle oxygen.¬†[Others assaulted thrown trash around rooms, yelled really wish people believed conspiracies hospitals would simply stay away rather making lives staff dangerous difficult. PCR test? work, person behind tested positive home test.

I nominated close contact person opposite was. person speak person (who tested positive) multiple times day. 

I spoke 30 seconds face going face yesterday.

I taken home tests 3 times. think safe go without test think PCR test?

I think lack transparency confused do.

This person sat 2-3 metres behind day. Would able transmit me? ""I'm personally sick moment deem pandemic over"" - idiots Naw. obvious result political decision assign value safe booster's ability reduce disease, long COVID, community spread, etc. pandemic. course would incredible pushback really bad call.

The idea ""dangerous"" healthiest 11% allowed less healthy 89% joke.

Most time regulatory agencies great job, perfect. sounds like FDA going fix bad call Friday, I'll first praise again. ‚ÄúI know adulting brand new you‚Äù 

What terrible thing say someone. it‚Äôs Covid, it‚Äôll falling high horse in. 

Disgusting actually deleted irrelevant another paragraph subject asymptomatic infection. 

I also forgot exactly sterilising immunity posted would right saying post correct referring non-sterilising immunity. ie. ultimately develop Memory B Cell response 50 'Cold' causing viruses 10 years without single symptomatic respiratory infection indication crossed 50+ threshold?

&amp;#x200B;

WRT repeated Asymptomatic SarsCov2 infection deleted paragraph about. certainly stopped worrying much Summer 2020 read experts theories kids invariably asymptomatic. theory exposed many pathogens school environment much recently adults perhaps level cross immunity SarsCov2 due kids recent exposure one Cold causing Coronoviruses. Studies last year shown rather cross immunity actual virus spike protein likely cross immunity due Memory B cell response certain protein expression surface infected cells common Cold causing corona viruses SarsCov2. recent thread actually Gen 2.0 Covid vaccines also targeting expressed proteins surface infected cells. 

Anyway, reasoned despite adult, job likely meant repeated exposure much recently Cold causing Corona viruses nevermind Rino Adeno's. Hence immune system ready fight SarsCov2 infected became symptomatic. Add likely repeated infection original, Alpha Delta variant topping B/T Antibody response, vaccines soon booster, likelihood blood thick antibodies. LOL

I succeed calming nerves family back Summer 2020 except mother lives us said confirmed studies mentioned news, mother relaxed...and said, ""OMG, thats saying back Summer 2020!!"". Tried explain back scientists might 95% sure validity theories make definitive public statements study results (and course right like that), refused believe indeed make statements publicly chill like rest us year ago. (By chill out, mean ignored masking social distancing rules partied every night act like normal, simply mean chilled doom gloom anxiety) Mostly unvaccinated tho. 

That's them. ""Can"" different recommended, though. understanding specifically Pfizer problems feels like normalcy we‚Äôve gotten used it. Thanks giving fuel anti-vaxxer idiots there. 

You bet ass, despite retraction it, reposted retold next millennia circles. would done people got vaccinated protected kids school. people don‚Äôt get vaccinated, won‚Äôt done 2022.

That‚Äôs happens people vector won‚Äôt act prevent limit transmission. like last year, county dropping mask mandates , successful, right holidays‚Ä¶.. Damn. definitely want yearly thing Kelly Ann Conway televised saying facts ‚Äúalternative facts‚Äù buffoon actually won, knew big trouble. It‚Äôs *alternative facts* ever since. Uhh‚Ä¶ mean dude, know other, like, cities stuff right? That, know, experience isn‚Äôt universal‚Ä¶? I‚Äôm sure know that, isn‚Äôt normal? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ city, masks mandated everywhere, it‚Äôs ‚Äúcertain workplaces,‚Äù it‚Äôs government mandate. Doesn‚Äôt feel normal me, you?  received second shot last march, get booster tonight Science supports antectdote! takes care pandemic yes, world changed now. need 'bad' change taken place unlikely things return normal before. lasted months sure, we're twenty months way thinking world fundamentally shifted. bit like 9/11, major paradigm shift. plan too. also need tetanus/whooping cough one. Hoping get three. *SpongeBob steroids meme* I‚Äôm sorry young people like who‚Äôs school experiences ruined. It‚Äôs unfair. hope things get better soon. That's going happen. Singapore 94% eligible population vaccinated, mask mandates (enforced!) indoors outdoors, dining activities groups 2 etc, we've 2000-4000 cases per day population 5+ million. 

Vaccine breakthrough cases ridiculously common. vaccine barely slows transmission months since second jab. 40% vaccine effectiveness vs Delta infection statistic September. gotten bit better everyone get booster 6 months second jab.

10,000 cases day US happen mild cases encouraged get PCR testing, denied PCR testing. everyone catches it. someone who's struggled digging deep find compassion within themselves, post speaks me. try better person find core empathy everyone, *literally* spitting faces fellow man pure spite/ignorance drain me. Look, know ‚Äúadulting‚Äù hard, isn‚Äôt simple wearing mask grocery store. mandates real effects outside that. city, know many employers, mine included, explicitly tied back office removal mask mandate. We‚Äôre even *allowed* office open it, won‚Äôt open mandate gone. 

This killing downtown. means businesses close. means people lose job. means income them, back figuring eat, pay rent, etc. Meanwhile, us lucky enough able work home home paying higher taxes support lost revenue downtown used bring in, meaning we‚Äôre spending less things, leading economic trouble outside downtown. 

Do see spirals? There‚Äôs point diminishing returns mandates, would say hit loooong time ago. We‚Äôre point personal responsibility COVID: you‚Äôre afraid it, onus needs protect yourself. can‚Äôt continue harm many people economically name stopping ‚Äúcases,‚Äù don‚Äôt mean anywhere near used mean year ago. It‚Äôs time end shit let us get back normal. Kids start getting shots Pfizer data. Kids start getting shots approval happens. saying approval timeline first half next year 2-4 second half next year 6 months 2 years. also decent vaccination rate. 77% (don‚Äôt think numbers cover kids/teens) us least one dose, 62% us 2 doses. We‚Äôve also 400-500 new cases county (each time publish numbers).

North county coastal SD, I‚Äôd say see 70% people wearing masks indoors still. Escondido, less 50%. think area/town makes difference too. Everything every god every religion ever said vaccines summed up: get rid way means doesn‚Äôt come back second restrictions lifted?

A big part accepting ""living COVID"" mean going back 2019. means masks public places, least parts year, really needs around long term. means rethinking large group gatherings. means putting improved ventilation schools work places. on. learn live COVID mean forever lockdowns. mean actually adapting reality instead ignoring assuming one unlucky people ends vent. insurance cover non vaxers? wonder much cost? Source reformulating Morderna?

Both Pfizer Moderna partial doses.

There people qualify full 3rd dose, generally immune compromised. mix booster (smaller dose) 3rd dose (third shot full dose). Mom made fabric masks slot nose. put scrap solid core wire (romex house wiring). wonders fogging. copper wire forms better steel tabs disposable masks. Thx coming ted talk.   It‚Äôs almost one would start thinking antivax stuff artificially boosted foreign hostiles looking destroy West. Oklahoma decided acting like 100% normal. Also AG literally suing catholic hospital allowing religious exemption vaccine. Fucking insane south. Yeah, Europe new wave ‚Äî past guide US next. expect US wave similar last year‚Äôs absolute holiday slaughter. course uneven vaccination rates hardly uniform, nowhere near 85%. so, lucky outlier. n=1 science, society, works. I'm similar situation - fully vaxed boosted live liberal area one highest vaccination rates state/country. Except we're still mask mandate. I'm used wearing mask work store apartment building feels wrong go girlfriend lives see anyone wearing masks. stop think ""would wear mask to?"" answer is, situations wouldn't. certainly stopped spring cases dropped.

At point, want get back pandemic unvaccinated. people decide whether want risk safe they're hurt decisions No, claim ""my religious beliefs vaccinations"". religious beliefs required line particular denomination religion. Yes. Moderna recipients also get booster. choose stick Moderna booster 50mcg, half dose shots (100mcg) initial series. also choose mix match. Pfizer J&amp;J boosters given original dosage strength. please stop fixating case counts. important rate hospitalizations deaths matter. Particularly vaccinated. vaccinations 5+ new treatment options becoming widely available month two need treat like endemic. vaxxed point (your choice respect that) own. can‚Äôt live upside society majority tasked looking minority.    alternative possibly debilitated months, years, even rest life, that's Man up.

So read literally said ""still way way better getting COVID"" got booster despite anticipating this? Seems like need vaccine anger issues, lol. precedent pretty strong, case state vaccine mandates, federal. State federal governments different powers comes health safety, federal powers much limited. 

Seems pretty likely (maybe ~80% chance IMO?) federal mandate struck down. precedent OSHA emergency temporary standards particular definitely side striking - 6 OSHA ETSs challenged court, one ever upheld. Tbh sister looking vaccination record day SIX doses whooping cough vaccine. SIX. maybe one take like that. I'm okay vs getting covid bad! labor market football league.

5-11% efficacy good comes tool aimed slowing spread contagious respiratory disease. 5-11% efficacy acceptable vaccine medicine covid, yet people act like masks making meaningful impact spread we've seeing. data says otherwise.  ‚ÄúWHAT‚ÄôS THAT? CAN‚ÄôT HEAR WORKPLACE DEVELOPED TINNITUS!!!‚Äù 

Surely would similar issues working home too, right? 
And you‚Äôd miss collaboration able office? That's somewhere around 2-3 dead teachers though. also said use masks pivital time 147k daily average. 7d rolling used smooth bumps/troughs reporting Idk man... idiots innocent children. expend every possible effort protect position protect themselves. not. known coronaviruses (except Sars cov 2) next mutation activity (unlike flu). Still vaccines vet medicine (human would possible never considered big issue) offer lasting sterile immunity.

You probably get infected quite often asymptomatic. I‚Äôd agree except I‚Äôm college professor small children cannot yet vaccinated I‚Äôm choosing remain mostly online (I one in-person class instead normal three) reduce risk bringing something home them. It‚Äôs definitely overkill people you‚Äôre thinking directly campus, conversations colleagues know we‚Äôre often thinking people campuses.

Oh also it‚Äôs hell teaching in-person need plan go online short notice students missing twice normal rate means much extra work us‚Ä¶ means many us want online avoid too.

You can‚Äôt anything kids vaccinated one thing latter concerns go class regularly professors deem worth stay person. mean quit paying attention CDC said don‚Äôt need boosters take mask, so. link Mayo Clinic saying said: whether I‚Äôm harming five month old, keeping daycare vaccinated nanny grandmothers? clearly children greatly overestimate abilities needs. actually plenty research suggests keeping children daycare 1 benefits them. need socialization. Right now? one one attention huge benefit him. local pharmacy walk hours wanted call ask Yup. made much money COVID die sniffles. Gimme every vaccine got I‚Äôm masked area weirded it. area highly vaccinated, hospitals nowhere near full, absolutely reason mask fear point, it‚Äôs killing downtown continue mandate (my, many friend‚Äôs, company explicitly tied return office removal mask mandate. workers get back downtown, cities continue deteriorate. We‚Äôre truly point measures harming people they‚Äôre helping) words ‚Äúnormality‚Äù never back. don‚Äôt ever see us really going 40-50k cases day. Agreed US reach anytime soon. Otoh, UAE supposedly 98% vaccinated 30% booster reporting 2k cases per day scales US population. idea daily testing rates positivity percentages vary three countries? like 60%.

Source: Whoops? zero impact overall point. Given normalcy normality synonyms, already ‚Äúa degree‚Äù both. Yeah. metric ridiculous unrealistic.  way ending Delta hit. know anti vaxxers.  data dispute üòÇ

""Prevention infection therefore community spread basis authorization"" falsifiable statement, though definitely political one. Everyone agrees boosters prevent infections.   Sure, truly unfortunate. 
That say 'all people' vast majority. 

Hospitalizations nationwide consistently 90% unvaxxed.  Although expect change winter vaccine immunities wane healthier people.

Chicago we‚Äôve essentially 100% masking almost entire pandemic. combine differences south Florida major Midwestern city it‚Äôs seems little weird lump us together stats. We‚Äôve rough spot FL better vice versa. üòÅüòÅExactly thinking of!   Im admittedly biased I'm hardcore vegan. ive wondering whether meat supply vector covid. know pigs pretty susceptible covid, although causes different symptoms them. think real danger virus mutating dangerous scary ways result spreading animal populations. already know without shadow doubt factory farming perfect petri dish enviormeny mutating novel dangerous strains flu. Covid far less mutogenic thats still real concern. speculation part course love see real research this.  found appointment Chicago weekend truckloads appointments next Tuesday. 2 week wait seem realistic all.

I'm state authorized boosters everyone recently trouble getting booster shortly that. (And live city)

Don't think there's really much issue finding booster appointments. briefly close July 2021 (11,433 rolling average July 22) Delta started raging around US. Now, noted others, solidly no. Spoken like someone works home wears mask hours week.  It‚Äôs works   need rapid testing available country ASAP. way pandemic. People test know results 15 minutes. community‚Äôs get hit (hospitals overrun) increase daily testing. hell hasn‚Äôt country implemented rapid testing?! It‚Äôs way people make best decision go party/event/flight, etc. described blows *my* mind. Complete overkill. school mask mandate ends January latest. courts may end earlier. really never understood big deal masks. one plan wearing every winter season public transportation foreseeable future. prevent much COVID. know actual vaccine costs think AstraZeneca might 1/10 cost Pfizer Moderna. efficacy quite good, meets original goals. choose spend X billion dollars vaccinate world, trade-off favor vaccinating 10X people?

Giving away 10 Chevrolets instead one Rolls Royce good masses needing basic transportation. agree aggressive needs masked periods high community spread.  city requires masks gyms, people really good it.  Beats locking again. Well, vaccinations obviously help lot crazy high numbers hospitals still overloaded. sure result deaths soon, also non-civid patients need urgent help cannot get any. Fauci's entire problem throughout time limelight here. elementary rhetoric, understand audience order message stick, he's never able that, best he's completely touch, worst he's outright disdainful people he's supposed addressing. recent statement former latter, still example incompetence position. manage get booster jab end. went one places jabbed before, town live in, appointments drop-ins, despite NHS web site making mention it. Considering efficient first jab arrangements were, poor.

The guy guiding people separate queues casually mention people made appointments decided comment - fault.

The actual jab process took less 2 minutes - queuing took 45.  NHL game week shut downs started rolling out.  like mask wearing. Cuts colds flu. mention smelling peoples bad breath. things inconsistent about?  Selfishness ignorance. hit nail head. like every 6 months efficacy rates decline fast.  Covid-19 seasonal thing like flu started spreading temperatures got colder Colorado people started hanging indoors.

The initial uptick seen numbers states cases went summer people go school work another uptick cases temperature went October. 

If follows trend 2020 Colorado peak mid late November start coming down. Interesting cases plateau winter reaches spike comes back down. supreme Court could theoretically use interstate commerce clause justify it, think there's 100% chance gets struck down.

But that's unlikely happen, conservative supreme Court majority, regulation created OSHA, Congress - real standard court compare Constitution, rather narrowly defined powers given OSHA via Occupational Safety Health Act related legislation.

I also disagree pandemic could've ended year sooner. Plenty countries vaccinations restrictions US still dealing surges restrictions.  Boca hahaha  emotional IQ 5, age around 40. Lol. mask mandate 170 people ones wear supervisors maybe 10 floor. 

Management scared try enforce it.  Thank you! I‚Äôd sign annual booster combined Covid, Flu, RSV. 7 day rolling average seven times higher daily average. sum seven previous days divided 7, average seven days. Tide goes in, tide goes out. would kick-ass! release approval, going huge rush people get shots.

I doubt it. people pretty aware boosters effectively available everyone rushing get them.  appears failed educating public enough understand public policy adjust, change, adapt along science, decisions adapt time people systems know topic science produces information topic via established methods peer reviewed, reproducible scientific progress. aside cause bothers me, Pfizer vax full FDA approved, yet we‚Äôre moving boosters Moderna J&amp;J. realize full approval matter time, still irks me. get Moderna shot without full. it‚Äôs applied august- what‚Äôs hold up? Really done deal since data EUA first place. Ok rant over.

Disclaimer: humble opinion quotes articles back up. 

BLA Moderna J&amp;J got put back burner prioritize boosters 5-11 EUA winter. everything put back burner prioritize 2 (Merck Pfizer) oral anti-viral drugs, may also need urgently get winter surge. words ""a degree normality"" Moderna working single annual shot COVID, flu, &amp; RSV. I‚Äôm south Florida also, place mask required around doctor‚Äôs office. OB still won‚Äôt allow anyone office except patient, vaxxed not, FaceTime ultrasounds theme year. 

And yeah, even store employees wear masks. always wear mask outside house unless I‚Äôm totally alone immediate family also feel like weird one. I‚Äôm getting mine today, high five! happens immunity booster wains? it‚Äôs formula. keep getting boosters?

No one knows Christ sake. want damn fortune teller? guy living alternate reality? went music festival 100k people attendance every day. still people listening guy staying houses? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. Everyone know gotten vaccines living life like it‚Äôs pre Covid exception wearing masks required. Agreed   Isn‚Äôt certain % cases false positives? ever actually dip beneath 10k per day population 332million?  don‚Äôt need wait.  think irrational want bare minimum stop people dying. 

Most epidemiologists experts pretty clear isn't, fact, over, think hysteria trust experts.

That said, I'm fully boostered I'm starting entertain idea going public events masked since I've pretty much throughout pandemic work. saw video young lady big problem sense taste smell recovering Covid-19. reminded co-worker similar less severe version problem said heard fluticasone nasal spray helping restore regular taste smell. gave shot worked them. also didn‚Äôt recall seeing anything Reddit referring thought I‚Äôd look post found help may suffering way. Hopefully helps folks out. never flu shot. Never flu whatever. got booster figured hell im already going feel like shit tomorrow. thing is, see us ever reaching number. unobtainable. flu higher right - kills fewer people per year. morph endemic thing. Constantly? Fully vaccinated used mean two shots, booster. That‚Äôs one change. new vaccine, new virus. I‚Äôve changed iPhone many times since then. several articles happens immunizations wain. drive Sars-Cov-2 extinction, happening soon, boosters, like flu shots, speculated become annual events. got flu vaccine 11 days ago appt Covid booster tomorrow. get need wait full 2 weeks? mean can‚Äôt come say certain point we‚Äôll done people won‚Äôt themselves, we‚Äôre almost there. vax available ages pill approved, think we‚Äôre done masks. Vaccine requirements/passports continue sure.  sure downvoted, sure stressful many people.

I suppose lucky family absolutely doubt everyone stands. 

I also lucky girlfriend I‚Äîboth boosted‚Äîare extremely low risk. someone lying, wouldn‚Äôt affect directly (in sense would impact whether attended not). Obviously would *livid* happened got someone sick, though.

Finally, careful say none us indoor dining. *do* work exposure. work closely students lab 60+ hours/week, girlfriend works public library, brother-in-law teacher school none students mask, etc. aren‚Äôt totally isolated‚Äîhence rapid tests. cutting low hanging fruit minimize risk much possible without making big sacrifices. I'd like see combined flu shot. Make one done year. Man, teacher, strongly disagree statement. Things education insane year.  Except us places use reason keep masks x percentage boosted.

I got booster, becoming absurd.  Oh man, love hearing what's possible people completely divided politicized science. least gives hope humanity.    I‚Äôm fully vaccinated + booster. area live high vaccination low case numbers. find rarely wearing mask anymore. ‚Äúneeded‚Äù. careful wearing mask times.

I‚Äôm afraid needles, still got vaxxed would def prefer pills patches  knows infectious diseases almost anyone Earth? Texas dumb. complain rules. Lol Wait, applies Moderna well? People want get around find way, anything improves ease access administration ultimately plus society. looked data three doses? takes immunity 94% whatever, like original vaccine course used OG strain. comes antivaxxed try make decision bad everyone.   lot new data come indicating three doses provides much protection two. likely really least three dose vaccine I'm surprised there's restriction. Australia open anyone six months second shot (and got mine five months doctor care) highly recommended people going primary care appointment least year hell lot health insurance mandates least gives heavy incentives anyway. Getting pfizer booster doctor's office, already information inputted adds like two whole minutes appointment, get flu shot exact time well schedule appointment fall. sacrifice like half hour time Spring get booster, likely dozens opportunities regular many grocery stores.  got Pfizer booster also felt quite fatigued almost exactly day half. get original doses, Astrazeneca  point I'm right now, I'm seriously considering dropping school I'm go something else. love I'm done years, I'm good subjects put half mental effort get better grades.

It's pretty I'm worried parents think I've tried failed much past year can't keep I'm doing. Definition insanity all. wouldn‚Äôt accurate though. Look Mississippi , vaxxed deaths recently unvaxxed. vax improves chances okay it‚Äôs gonna make 100% immune.  I'm one people Already happened CA NY. Weeeeeeee  can't speak much disillusionment technically supposed know stuff. Simply know hospital's administration mismanaged LOT stuff past months left doctors pick pieces up. hate say think whole ordeal stress placed taken years life.

Dental health critically important overall health, probably moreso anyone realizes. 5, right? unless start including variant specific covid vax Given we've let COVID develop world's half-assed approach, COVID probably ""over"" lifetimes.

Booster shots, like annual flu shot, probably become norm longer-lasting vaccinations exist. vaccinate kids five, parents always need concerned children getting COVID (and navigating care children, missing work providing care required). think happen, lead safe take masks?

Masking commonplace cold/flu season many parts world become commonplace U.S., too. hugely beneficial health economy. 2020 first year entire life get cold flu attribute masking. getting sick means missing work (or working sick infecting people).  Fingers crossed plays out. population obviously better coverage time, many people stay healthier, mitigation become much easier, etc. vaccine stays 3 dose vaccine. Really much better situation.

But personal level, still get people upset this. data eventually uncovers fact need frequent COVID booster... perhaps combo annual flu shots I've already getting decades? part bother all... 360 degrees circle.

""a degree normality"" normality stretch.

10,000 day 3.65 million cases year. problem messaging. I‚Äôm hearing lot experts saying really 3 dose vaccine. problem aren‚Äôt leaving open door could more.

Prepare highly possible increase cases. family vaccinated could get booster shot it. also getting tested visit safe thanksgiving aunts place usually 30 guests tend 50. fully vaccinated getting tested. want normal thanksgiving dinner worries someone catching covid. trying spread anti vaccine bs?

The people seem talk vaccines 100% effective tend anti vaccine idiots year hopefully less severe since many people vaccinated may otherwise gotten critically ill. 

I'm starting become resigned thought covid present least next several years forever. 

It's starting become appropriate time take stock we're willing every day rest lives can't sustainably forever. really want get every 6 months forever

Why?

I don‚Äôt think state even offers anymore.   want one sure got J&amp;J. smallest amount protection. recommend booster 2 months J&amp;J.

Get mRNA booster lockdowns thing right? Events 2G+ masks compulsory cancelled. 2G+ vaccinated recovered allowed eveyone must test. Open air 2G events cancelled. Please tell restrictions. makes sense review data thoroughly detailed discussions make sure safe effective. make sense rush roll way could damage already fragile trust.

Being fully vaccinated already provides tremendous protection without booster. That's option months now. People fucking ignorant af. Hear Fauci... profession hyper risk-averse. stating opinion is, based science, *save lives* public health official that's job... dude can't go like ""O.K. obviously socially over, pass beer let's party!"" even that's case job overly cautious take whatever actions keep many people alive can... currently still ~1k people day dying least Covid.

It‚Äôs understandable we‚Äôre high priority vaccines moment, active COVID cases country, people content wait make appointment get one become available. are, case back April. many shots arms possible goal. like we've learned past two years, things change fast approach covid.

What would considered best practice booster, terms long wait, vaccine currently considered best someone who's 2xAZ?

(Male, caucasian, 61, matters) I'll throw another one: transportation. Wearing mask 10-hour international flight fucking sucks. Daily good know. 7 months since got vaccine. got Johnson &amp; Johnson shot. pandemic *is* control vaccinated individuals, represent large majority population.

It's becoming increasingly absurd require NPIs them.   Same, I'd like lose working days possible. flu shots COVID shots affect lot. also drive two hours 102 fever second COVID shot. misery around. I'd still take protection viruses, hopefully they'll find way minimize effects.

What would authorization code Moderna Pfizer vaccine be? 

P.S. skip question, curious would ask question. insight helpful. Thanks. Can't say, Fauci determining likely even advising it. Okay, good know. ask college sign ups today want get tomorrow. I'm trying decide deadline. irony I'm sure anti-vaxxers *jump* treatment offered.

No one ever able prove last side effect vaccine, ever. They're designed get in, deliver ""instructions"" making anti-bodies, quickly get flushed system. Vaccines stick around body long enough cause long-term health complications.

*Treatments* another story, however. They're designed build certain level body, stay duration treatment, get flushed according whatever half-life is. thing half-lives though never really get zero. *Some* always stay behind, perhaps levels low current detection methods measure, they'll - possible long term exposure, exposure low levels, *could* cause problems.

Vaccines small amounts, designed quickly flush body - issues never arisen approved vaccine. treatments issues time (relative vaccines).

Most people left permanently semi-permanently probably limited financial means. Yes, well-off people relocated permanently places, small minority many kept apartments. supposed exodus Florida turned occasional drip torrent. masking culture better Europe.   someone fully vaccinated firmly believe that‚Äôs government doesn‚Äôt right force take vaccine.

Do suggest January said ‚Äòeveryone get mask‚Äô knowing:

Meanwhile works italy automated systems.
Obviously lot needs based trust, work. Proper, undivided political message lead widely accepted mask mandates here. Yeah ton people hoarding anything point assumed said wear masks hospitals enough. mean masks work, that's people heard never dropped it. spiteful one explanation pattern though. Another explanation people believe officials keep lying them. worried masks would scarce also sure mode transmission. clear aerosol masks became sure thing, worry people buying n95s like toilet paper. Additionally masks weren‚Äôt supposed 100 percent preventive, way knock strength spread.

Anecdotally, reached side shit. positive test, found study, since easy access high quality CBD (in CO) took ~2g CBD tincture form also used CBD inhaler, symptoms, especially fatigue sinus pressure, diminished significantly 24 hours following.

However, that's 100% anecdotal mean anything, could absolutely placebo effect since took reading study.  perhaps says something efficacy mandates. necessarily say much scientific masks themselves.  Considering huge proportion worlds population still access first dose yet, bit big deal. whole world going need regular boosters needs concerted effort massively increase production capacity globally Hopefully congress, want MTG get rack fines Getting mine tonight California already allowed it. excited happy think end pandemic, convenient walking distance house  Agreed So‚Ä¶ 6 months third, right? we‚Äôre going with? question person answering explanation hits nail head. 

Couple months ago getting pissed making ""delta"" vaccine given much sucks someone explained ""variation"" enough necessitate making whole new vaccine, need keep antibody levels basically wait there's new variant nucleotide etc sufficiently different evade vaccine (hopefully never happens).

but things stand, virus evading vaccine, producing larger load overwhelming immunity get vaccine ""defense"" lasts shorter amount time sadly. nothing else maybe encourage states expand eligibility. woow, room entire God bus Except everyone eligible. 2nd 3rd doses (got booster weekend) kicked butt stuck bed two days each. feel helluva lot better parents Thanksgiving dinner. 

If new normal every 6 months protect loved ones it. wondered masks effective crowded public transport people squeezed together

Trains may crowded, there's sufficient ventilation nobody really talks bad manners general even Covid. Add mask usage, sufficient shielding infections certain degree public transports.

In fact I'd wager advertised heavily Govt really helped regard. big factor establishments reacted complied. Covid seasonal respiratory virus largely spreads people close quarters indoors. means Southern (hotter) states tend see upticks summer Northern (colder) states tend see upticks winter. saw pattern 2020. Shit. That's afraid of. Guess call CVS tomorrow sort somehow. way look it, twice frequency usual flu vaccine. might earnestly next 3-5 years (I'm guessing).

I know medically possible, maybe would possible researchers combine covid booster vaccine usual flu vaccine single one too. Yup. Checked account too. dice either. Shit. I'd argue vaccines effective spread stopping masks. There's horrible attitude country vaccines work stop spread. need stop narrative agree certain point, concern pandemic still control much covid circulating. Even vaccinated getting exposed often getting infected needlessly. protected short term death hospitalization mean guaranteed walk park get it. Yeah. Shortly got shot. subject line ""For Records"". says also sign care.cvs.com view it. interesting. Seems like a, what, 90% reduction?  

Really like see peer reviewed study. Would mean get Pfizer Moderna boosters? thought Pfizer got go-ahead boosters. get email. happen already CVS account? too. see mine app.  I‚Äôve watching since‚Ä¶ forever.

Realistically, could walk CVS right get one. qualifications broad, it‚Äôs likely anyone fall least one them. mention, pharmacies don‚Äôt ask anyway.

Anyone got list countries allowed make generic version? roughly same. went work next day. super fun, doable. halway second day felt fine again. got Covid booster (pfizer) Sunday I've bed 100 degree fever since Monday morning. bonkers. zero reaction initial shots. mean, I'll continue get vaccine man oh man sucks.  believe it. sure country in, nurses income doesn‚Äôt really align careers listed there. yeah that‚Äôs one offers money blood, it‚Äôs higher chance getting blood that‚Äôs infected. least ~10 months far seen. wait boosters fade. come school districts? r/prematurecelebration ....cue cries persecution.... definitely feels like sense complacency setting since numbers pretty low long.

I‚Äôll taking trip NYC next week. I‚Äôd like get booster shot beforehand, don‚Äôt want miserable whole trip. Although research study still awaiting peer review, findings quite interesting. key findings stood me:


- Cannabidiol (CBD) potent inhibitor SARS-CoV-2 infection vitro.

- Results showed limited inhibition SARS-CoV-2 infection Cannabinoids **other CBD.**

- Analysis 93,000 patients tested SARS-CoV-2 University Chicago Medical Center showed 10.0% tested positive overall, 5.7% ~400 cannabinoid medical record tested positive.

- Patients taking CBD versus cannabinoids even lower rate testing positive (1.2% 85 CBD patients versus 7.1% 113 patients taking cannabinoids, p=0.08).

The interesting finding matched patients sample account variance:

- Since multiple potential confounding factors could explain findings, including age, race, clinical morbidities, sex, matched 82 patients prescribed oral, FDA-approved CBD (Epidiolex¬Æ) COVID-19 testing patients indication taking cannabinoids comparable characteristics including similar demographic characteristics, clinical comorbidities, records medications two years COVID-19 testing. 

- patients prescribed oral CBD COVID-19 test, common morbidity categories hypertension conditions immunosuppression. Strikingly, **only 1.2% patients prescribed CBD contracted SARS-CoV-2 whereas 12.2% matched, non-cannabinoid patients tested positive** (p=0.009), suggesting potential reduction SARS-CoV-2 infection risk approximately order magnitude.

Hope y'all find interesting. 

As I've understood preliminary study, results suggest high doses CBD significantly correlated reduction COVID-19 positivity may block infection early stages. However, inability source high-quality CBD products due lack regulatory oversight makes hard recommend taking bunch CBD reduce one's chance contracting virus.

Azithromycin over-the-counter anywhere I'm aware pill, order effective, must taken within 2-3 days

The past two years shown that. That‚Äôs reco is.  people forced work may get families quite sick keep food table families? Businesses forced employ people cost big bucks get sick could prevented $30 vaccine shots? Suggesting wearing masks public sick avoid spreading people (when may...die) basic courtesy gets down-voted, amazing. here. I'd much rather feel like crap couple days vs couple weeks even months! can't imagine getting covid without vaccine feeling sick long. Reddit's voting system popularity contest. People downvote like hear, regardless objectivity. Ok covid symptoms 6th October tested positive PCR 7th. really quite sick week followed. 

I went travelling last week took PCR flying negative. took another PCR test return back home negative. abroad took first vaccine last day there. got back country Thursday took PCR Saturday came back negative. took another PCR today (Tuesday) came back Positive despite gone anywhere Saturday Sunday, Monday today (Tuesday) live alone. makes sense.

Seriously, percentage unvaccinated people think voluntarily wear masks based CDC recommendation? 70% based would cut spread disease. CDC say lift mandates. CDC guidance vaccinated people safe wearing masks. made pronouncement context gave excuse unvaccinated people would never wear mask without forced say ""science"" side.   need show proof booster considered fully vaccinated? mask mandates. happens Vegas always stay there.

In current season that‚Äôs Midwest east coast. Travel, required get vaccinated, universities, ugly ass plastic barricades everywhere, massive inflation, propaganda posters ""covid measures"" everywhere, customer service gone complete udder shit. March 12 Ohio shit got real. thought would July...2020. here's thing, cases plummet even vaccinate 100% population... Portugal cases rising president said reintroduce obligatory masks outdoors. many experts shut need stop rise cases, despite little mortality 86% total population vaccined. unless people stop looking cases, going NPI's veeeeery long time. felt like shit 2 days yeah eventually nice know extra shot likely going help.  first day company allowed us back office, still optional now, big boss calls us all-day in-person meeting. yesterday. really state state, like county county.  They‚Äôre referring 1.2% patients prescribed CBD contracted SARS-CoV-2 whereas 12.2% matched, non-cannabinoid patients tested positive (p=0.009), suggesting potential reduction SARS-CoV-2 infection risk approximately order magnitude.  Hesitancy problem people also lot likely peer pressured something everyone else lot likely follow government instructions. critical mass people vaccinated that's norm, people bite bullet go along even personal concerns.  Ah. Finally reveals true intentions thoughts. clear start still. Onya, mate. Yeah point lot people listen Everything news says Welcome Rockville went fine must close regulate wet markets human nature unique time. College interrupted lot Covid pandemic. plague pretty common reason universities temporarily shut going back 13th Century.

The rest world done particularly better 50 separate U.S. states, either, although think tried harder political unity pursue things. Still, look rich Western countries like Austria today. lower percentage vaccinated vaccine- resistant U.S. state. work state government social worker, got info handed recently. 40,000 employees back office, 100%, beginning January.

It's morbidly fascinating watch real time. Seeing people 20+ year careers, chose work fixed schedule (and required overtime) allowed care ill immunocompromised family member; required expose community large, return family member.... 'find another job' feels callous, tbh. disagree completely, simple. go cough friends, cough friends, cough  really. friends got vaccinated completely moved on. That‚Äôs almost everyone know real life treated (and know maybe 2 antivaxxers) can't hold average people standard right there......  Let's add exaggerations here. 99.4% people age 65 got least one vaccine. That's hugely politicized age group. 18.4% adults gotten shots, know many antivax vs really remotely located. want trying tell us do

I'm telling anything. leading public health experts US are. 

Don't listen - I'm guy internet. Listen leading epidemiologists US continued state ""emergency"" absolutely ruining country inflation, government overreach, companies taking advantage situation. trash around.

Wishing pandemic away working. actually going need take steps make happen get solid recovery underway.  wish anti-vaxers anti-maskers would stop dragging out, guys seem determined make last long possible. Surely understand 65+ vast majority Covid deaths, still 170,000 people 40-64 bracket died it. also still disproportionately afflicting poorer people younger age brackets.  Cloth masks kind masks N95 KN95 masks readily available long time substantially better preventing spread infection. everyone wore KN95 better mask correctly would far better vaccination.

They're also horribly uncomfortable never get anyone wear them. correctly fitting n95 mask face shield would extremely Yes almost exclusively due anti-vaxxers, unfortunately seem like changing time soon. brings important reason keep mask mandates

Nope, actually I'm kinda favour dropping restrictions encouraging antivaxxers gather large groups (we start organizing indoor conferences terrible ventilation). vulnerable shelter weeks maybe we'll done. Seems worked Florida...

I'm also months total covid fatigue scare longer wish take active precautions, pretty soon care anyone else dies, already care die would actually rather past 2 years. flu younger too. fun. I've never advised get flu jab.  whole lot kids need parents now.....it's really sad. feel different Great Recession combined double-whammy flu year, honest. masks mask controversies new, lot else serious lockdown six months past. know poor homeless people die COVID?

Just say capacity empathy move on. Yep, look nyc. Got slammed good vax rate things fine even tho people back living going bars maskless 6 monthsb  live nyc live normally crowd packed bars every week mask. We‚Äôre good vaccine rate. Masks aren‚Äôt coming back unless shit absolutely hits fan. logic youre seeing ass backwards country huge NE nothing South‚Äôs covid situation like Midwest doesn‚Äôt West. Country big, culturally different many different clients logic work. Hell, state makes covid rules, too. think we've reached sort equilibrium people observing mask policy others aren't. apartment building plenty signs everywhere, half building staff residents wear masks all. unfortunately, think people care given trying get everyone follow it. *Around* LA, San Diego Palm Desert, really feels mostly terms response. Palm Springs strict, large elderly population lot immunocompromised people (HIV survivors, especially retired gay population). lot SoCal, recent travels outside LA feels post-pandemic, whatever weird phase we're now. want wear mask forever it. 

The rest us want trying tell us do. I'm vaccinated. vaccinated. We're making sick. 

Masks look stupid, hurt communication, added chore measurable benefit. Even worse continued state ""emergency"" absolutely ruining country inflation, government overreach, companies taking advantage situation. trash around. started late compared lot countries. government requires local trials approving vaccines slowed rollout several months, followed limited rollout medical staff first month so, starting over-65s late April-early May. around July vaccinations opened age groups, got mine earliest anyone know 65 I'm government employee got use metropolitan government vax center second shot August.

Once everything finally started running smoothly shocked quickly things turned around, goal one million shots day considered overly ambitious announced hitting double that. I'm looking decent paper give good evidence for, given person fully vaccinated, infected COVID delta variant, age dependent probability severe consequences. Ie. hospitalization, disability and/or death. stop following rules? Idk certainly feel bad especially still making online classes‚Ä¶but aren‚Äôt partying hanging like normal wrong school know‚Ä¶ could stop testing. tests = cases. Can‚Äôt explain  Ah case I'm honestly sure then. show ID original vaccination, I'm sure they've changed since Feb person you‚Äôre responding missing. It‚Äôs deadly disease flu, don‚Äôt accept around forever. That‚Äôll kill lot people. Sorry blind concept Coronavirus pandemic vaccinated. bit weird. suspect public gatherings started ""With covid"" stance government. Apparently critical breakthrough cases elderly, maybe mix dropping antibodies increased gathering? can't help wonder many clusters church related. Good. Covid leading cause death people aged 35 54 September. ask I'm canadian, US months. booster rollout may slower would like, I'd like try get one I'm there. mind paying, I'm trying freeload, want one sooner rather later.

That long way saying cdc card, could probably tell first jab, no?  mental health taking big hit, get boosted move on? Stop caring live normal. Better losing sanity. Maybe emergence new contagious strain vaccine resistant.

Otherwise, dealing larger larger percentage population degree coronavirus resistance - whether acquired infection inoculation. 

People going keep passing around, among unvaccinated unlucky breakthrough/reinfection cases, tune million day US.  honestly think PGA going risk player getting Covid her? infected player got really ill PGA would sued millions letting unvaccinated people in.   ‚ÄúI think Coloradans sick tired wearing masks protect people don‚Äôt seem want protect themselves,‚Äù said earlier month.

And yet... fun say ""fuck em!  I'll nothing!""

Well, know COVID fetuses.    I'd note upward trend tends areas masking, too. Basically delta already got everyone South. idea weird many people care masks (in directions). Like something pretty minor effect. Given ordinary, healthy 60+ people fully vaccinated August, see many breakthroughs age group certainly seems suggest 6 months long. said, 70-80 age group vaccinated first, people nursing homes getting shots around April, might closer 5-6 months. group also given Astrazenica vaccine, seen anything 4-6 month drop effectiveness. Tbh, that's longer clear. Delta, breakthrough cases longer extremely rare, quite opposite. Even places extremely high vaccination rates record outbreaks. want exact explanation *that* number need ask epidemiologist. 

But consistent number based size/population/spread/etc whole needs seen.  What's people wanting everyone jail? I'm okay people vaccinated long okay living restricted area antivaxxers. hospitals treat sick cremate dead. rest us deal them.  I'm LA exactly one week wear mask grocery store. still people wearing them, including cashiers. use masked cashier half reason wear one them. exposed hundreds people day. least people wear mask. People (and are) taking seriously mask mandates. Coupled vaccination mandates, we'd much better shape everyone wearing mask March continued told everything fine. can't make long-term plans short-term crisis ended, crisis gotten worse last 5 months. Wearing mask inside public, even vaccinated, incredibly benign.  would line evidence.

Flu looking bad year well, virtually non-existent last year.* Given even ""normal"" times bad flu season push hospitals breaking point, things look good.

Glad I've gotten booster flu shot.

*My county already logged flu cases last winter! People normal things risk getting COVID. That's real problem people high risk categories. get rid way means doesn‚Äôt come back second restrictions lifted?

Bear mind get compliance restrictions propose there‚Äôs point good January cost bad March, etc.

By means, looking treatment extra doses, severity disease doesn‚Äôt mean wish existence. People accept deadly diseases millennia. Probably, sad say increasing element Canadian society gone crazy town government conspiracies, largely western phenomenon.  Honestly covid last year mild vaccines much worse. shorter lived. Covid left stuffy headaches 5 days (and smell month). 2nd shot booster spiked fever 105, unpleasant. need kill dogs various strains different degrees deadliness. kills something like 20k 50k people year US. strains affect mostly young old sick like Spanish Flu WWI kill healthy adults ages.  

A bad flu season taxes medical system usually localized nearly bad COVID been. 

People think COVID like flu ignorant reality.   know Supreme Court stacked. actually follow precedents, unless precedent flawed rarely case, would uphold Jacobson v Massachusetts 1905 ruled individual liberty absolute subject police power state. 

However, sad say possible overturn precedent. they?

You look much lower level protection between, booster. boosters going given, approach might better.

But 2 short term booster probably overall better. never. got it. cuz forever. worry many people put hospital first. insults get point across personally like you. wrong situation. people taking advantage covid get prolong via militant forever maskers like you. 

We could come terms fact covid going anywhere effective vaccines. Yep, different somehow. could've.

I'm legitimately worried future. vaccine mandates almost assuredly going stacked supreme court. rule unconstitutional, Earth going vaccine insanity keeps growing legitimate population-ender hits? trust people would *eventually* come around bodies piling street, point it'd probably far late.

We didn't, though. pretty decent percentage people refused wear masks, mandates enforced basically anywhere. second half year much higher infection death numbers spring early summer people getting vaccinated still required wear masks. noticed that, right? Well else supposed prove people Biden boss them? 

Surely expect teach lesson saying evidence supported month dragging feet.  Afford steak.  preferred price drops, new course going cheap yet think wearing masks causing inflation? There's long-standing divide among experts whether people allowed take boosters mild moderate infections. CDC can't exceed FDA authorized, control definition high risk.

Good luck! Even Delta, 3dose series quite effective symptomatic infection. reduces rate severe disease another order magnitude risk. enough people got boosters, disease burden would low enough ignore even cases. cases would also way happened.   like paragraph in. Many people date vaccines (by policy afaik - Portugal letting elderly people get vaccines date) course cases going rise. Cases still lot lower US case far less important reduced rate hospitalization. Still, death rate going lag behind cases death rate something ignore. scale covid death rate US, covid would 4th deadly thing (after cancer, heart disease, maybe accidents).

So would assess personal situation: immuno compromised person household need additional protection bringing infection home? high-risk child still fully vaccinated perhaps still young enough ineligible vaccination? touch confusing moment, vast majority U.S. already eligible booster based conditions besides age alone? still think makes sense simpler clarity matter. wear mask inside buildings (grocery store, restaurants, oil change, everything, unless actively eatting) work, everyone vaccinated, don‚Äôt to, anyone outside work comes in, everyone to.

Just heart disease alone could say ""a 9/11 deaths every 2 days"" though.

I'm saying pandemic issue say like ""a 9/11 every X days"" little disingenuous country 330 million people. Even then, it‚Äôs question things.

What practical impact changes? Better ventilation seen good thing, effect small it‚Äôs worth drastically reprioritizing health, education, housing/facilities budgets.

Big events never mortal sin. COVID plague punish sociability. Endemic COVID require changes choices, must smart ones simply different everything COVID somehow wrong. can't make point without insulting probably good.

I guess various Doctors teach prestigious medical universities saying exact thing bad anti-vaxxers too.

If FDA quickly reverses without substantive change data bad anti-vaxxers? else told feel necessary say ""leave alone""? definitely good riddance. People touch reality.

Something ain‚Äôt adding up. 

That said, don‚Äôt see issue you‚Äôre year. Long flu üëÄ stupidity. malice. (Upvoted subjunctive.) Actually read again, said ‚Äú*only* CDC recommends fourth dose immunocompromised people‚Äù ‚Äúthe cdc recommends‚Äù - could bad syntax, way it‚Äôs currently written actually implies IC. that, agree you. us. think Canada awesome, even pandemic. :) folks great job.  Yeah. Luckily live major city imo reasonable. Requires schools, hospitals, transit, etc. never ever, ever getting back normal..... frequently transmitted, greater likelihood new variant new strain. Also, long covid going huge burden. work university here's see:

* Masks indoors
* Staggered work schedules (and hybrid WFH) make offices less crowded
* Restrictions size types events held (e.g. events cannot held involve eating indoors)
* Regular testing symptom screening requirements (I show proof completing symptom screening survey every time enter office building)
* Vaccination requirements mean showing proof vaccination regularly (and, side, lot time spent verifying proof vaccination). E.g. show proof time go restaurant.

Masks big deal, symptom screening questions seem pointless, vaccination requirements pain there's standardized way proving vaccination status (most people store something phone, means phone dies can't go bunch places). all, though, feels like 90% back normal. think you‚Äôre close needing booster. Yeah, sucked though. think it‚Äôs going happen eventually one way another, via vax causes soo much less suffering. crossing fingers pull together. FYI don‚Äôt actually ask Yeah way person phrased made seem like immunocompromised though wanted fourth. blind vaccine mixing matching unsolicited extra doses quite concerning me. Go experts saying do. Sad say least, don‚Äôt follow news life normal. Get vaccinated / boostered, everything could 2019 without restrictions point. shall never wear mask get vaccine. Lmao deal it. love making people work around vented ones? know, ones don‚Äôt actually work viral barrier? Immune compromised people receive additional dose designated differently booster. go sign vaccine, options first dose, second dose, additional dose booster. I‚Äôm Canada, leaving huge pain uncertainty annoyance pcr testing enter. used escape cold yearly around February couple weeks can‚Äôt risk one us stuck extra two weeks work making month off. Plus son quarantine 10 days would miss school well

I‚Äôm tired masking everywhere showing proof vaccine dine go movies also. 

Oh son school three years one normal year field trips, Christmas concerts sitting class without mask Minnesota, that‚Äôs basically happened too. Gov Walz originally said mask mandate would lifted hit 70% vaccinated (back expected hit end June). CDC lifted guidance immediately backtracked dropped mandate day. voted still support him, think probably biggest mistake since taking office. depends *so* much live. Seattle area indoor masking basically 100%. Immune compromised people receive additional dose designated differently booster. go sign vaccine, options first dose, second dose, additional dose booster.     moon! double vax + antibody treatment + *just had* booster, I'd say they'll pretty good shape, things considered. mean yeah, it‚Äôs rocket science. fucking sucks It‚Äôs coming‚Ä¶

Colorado‚Äôs highly vaccinated we‚Äôve reamed latest wave (That *may* peaked last week, time tell).

Changing 3 shot series seems needed stop transmission chains. obnoxiously high blood pressure cause pounding headaches stop. also kill you. easy.   flu 4 times time mid 20s, remember every time detail absolutely shite felt lol. Awful stuff. two questions.

I took Johnson Johnson Vaccine April 2021. planning getting booster shot. get booster shot now?

Does matter take different vaccine booster speak doctor situation?

Thank you. whole ordeal ruined college experience altered thought I'd life.

At point willfully unvaccinated rot. I've lost close two years life point. mental bottomed point I'm surprised hospitalized myself. I'm tired watching fucking parent coming home disillusioned what's going hospital work at, hate knowing toll stress taken them. I'm tired. compassion left antivaxxers. 

The world beautiful place believe humanity whole worth saving. would endanger others willful ignorance? I'll shed tears pass. wish death upon them. catch COVID, done choices made. tears left that.   never getting Covid control though... things definitely 'better' vaccine, half country still refuses take 'leaders' continue politicize it, mutate again, winters always lethal flu season. Normal? No. 'degree' normalcy? Well what's next incremental step absolute total shit show? That's us now.

When former leaders said would go away, knew would become common common cold. false hope bs Fauc others continue push rubs wrong way. issue covid spreading mostly private homes

[citation needed] Fauci says lot things I'm completely fine getting annual flu shots.

Why different? admire too! don‚Äôt know would call conformity, rather emphasis better group/others opposed better me. USA individualistic societies much selfish comparison. What, think young people can't get flu? I've flu twice late teens. SUCKED. Probably sickest miserable I've ever been. Now, get flu shot every year. wish everywhere. generous. People care anymore disturbing me. continue wear mask partner higher risk, lots family too. one seems get that. Yes delta made cases go  feel you, I'm graduating next month. Covid took last 3 semesters :( point Vax lessen probability death get covid. Says right CDC website. 

So, come please. Unreplicated unreviewed = BS. admire culture. Normally find conformity stifling, need quietly pull together, like way handle that. Well next month Im going convention that, despite requiring proof vaccination everyone going, still requires mask theres that. I‚Äôm highly vaccinated northeast. college‚Äôs restrictions incredibly top considering hospitals fine. Depending live, hospitals fine. midwest Rocky Mountain states getting bad uptick cases putting strain hospitals. though... people false hope sort denial, things definitely 'better' vaccine, half country still refuses take it, mutate again, winters always lethal flu season. Normal? No. 'degree' normalcy? Well what's next step total shit show? That's us now. same. seriously think large group people take they'll believe give HIV. large group people get science social media shit posting Russia. friends number years whenever anyone tells everything happens reason punch face. *watch 800,000 people die year half

Why can‚Äôt go back normal?? Great job, Japan!  true. Look CDC guidelines hospitalization/death age. 

You're likely damage child unless he/she cancer transplant survivor. guess things mostly back normal everywhere except college campuses. classes still half online despite school 92% vaccination rate. Seems little overkill point tbh :/ Time find new job lets wfh thinking won‚Äôt continue following trend line much poorer speculation‚Ä¶

The booster gave 3x antibodies initial series did, Israel‚Äôs following initial group 10 months don‚Äôt see waning signal yet, giving credence significantly longer lasting protection changing 2 dose series 3 dose series. Major religious texts completely ignore vaccination books predate idea hundreds years. guess would prescription. takes long time medicines tested safe enough OTC. could also see ‚Äúemergency case‚Äù kind thing goes straight OTC. honestly realize still limited. thought supposed get booster 6-8 months whatever. Shows know. signed last week, I'm getting booster tomorrow (second shot early April). I'm Texas, walgreens like 30 appointments per day available, problem. say like everyone playing ball know never going get enough people agree get vaccinated.     allow dog run loose cat outside here; many coyotes. concerned safe dog walk her. Feral cats deer come right you, there's area grass been. Pretty strict compared developed countries. Fully vaxxed people could get 21 days quarantine. Whereas say Canada, backed person need quarantine anymore. 

But yeah important wealthy people get pass like countries. Hell yeah brother!  Got moderna today, initially got j&amp;j issue covid spreading mostly private homes bar-type places masks worn regardless (e.g. concert halls). vast majority people catching covid grocery store. 

A mask mandate shit outside school Americans tired masking unless forced to. Sometimes feel like I'm weird one still wearing mask. I'm south FL incredibly rare see anyone one employees stores. weird. got mine local grocery store one asked eligible, even sign form online. peaked 150k summer shouldve lowest. course winter going shit show.  got moderns booster 10 days ago Texas. even let choose one wanted. 7 day rolling average called it. second worst peak last summer, wouldnt winter worst surge yet? Wouldnt surprised 1 mill+ case days January. Nice. already got booster I'm fat, good available everyone soon. lot anti-vaxxers latched ""finding"" months ago

And they'll ""find"" coming months completely ignoring retraction. best answer! pandemic traumatic fuck many, many people. social life basically non-existent anymore, want chance catching virus. go hardly anywhere. mental health extremely poor right (grieving pandemic incredibly hard).

How people realize isolating normal is!!  Everyone life vaccinated interesting way look it. sure everyone come contact with? doubt it.

In countries, normal wear mask cold flu season. keeps people dying. small inconvenience. wonder feel wiping ass, washing hands so. inconvenient?  Dealing fools spouting TV internet :(  says lot people say things like ""who living exactly like pre-2020?""

The families 750k dead one. living hole life.

The people long term permanently disabled family members. definitely living different life. 

The people lost job change lives around it. living different life.

It's weird, there's subset people LARPing last 2 years Tbh social distance local deer Title seems sensationalized. Yes, effectiveness seems wane time. say ""don't last"". study discuss care about: chance death. discuss hospitalisations, compare unvaccinated. 

So yeah, effectiveness wanes, fully vaccinated, going protected hospitalization death equivalent unvaccinated person.  Seattle masks required indoors. Also vaccines required many businesses. I‚Äôm sure someone respond good things annoying. But, definitely normal pre-covid occurrences, I‚Äôm saying. Wait till u get shingles vaccine!  united states average population density around 94 per Sq mile Israel's 1036 per Sq mile. 

You said 7 day average COVID cases analogous around 15000 cases per day US currently around 70,000 new cases per day..

Not sure argument here. Even say average population density 10x lower matter still 4x many new daily cases population adjusted Israel. Seems like US still pretty shit. president idiot spreads anti-vax propaganda, citizens Brazil listen all, may even despise him, accepting vaccine. expect country ends vaccination rates similar Spain Portugal month. wildlife thing worry. Deer place right now. US case reporting frustratingly inconsistent. States report every day, days way cases others. ever smoked before? BMI 25? history mood disorder substance abuse? one true qualify due ""underlying medical condition"". ""Online classes viable option traditional college experience. best way access courses personal laptop. rendered useless, without batteries. one you.""  evidence antivaxxers exclusively problem ‚Äúrich countries‚Äù? feel like that‚Äôs speculative tell CDC make masks mandated everyone...oh vaccine we're it. Vax rates Germany low? eastern Europe understand complete lack trust govt think Germans like that. Pfizer booster third shot original Pfizer vaccine formulated differently like Moderna‚Äôs is? flu anywhere near deadly Covid, though, demand case numbers closer 10k/d vaccinations would there, unreasonable. many people bother getting flu vaccine year, nevermind can't various reasons crackpots. flu vaccines politicized weaponized, numbers unvaccinated would way higher too. fair comparison all.

I mean, literally know many times I've flu (between affordability issues vaccine time shit immune system, plus virtually risk killing another/countless people passing along) go doctor, let alone times go doctor part even tested it. lot. Wildly different situation, vastly different stakes. Generally ""end goal"" tends anything would prevent hospitals risk overrun. understand frustrating criteria set target depends bunch different factors. entire point taking mitigation measures.

In United States, I'm guessing we're 6 months away caring much whether vaccinated people get COVID anymore. children vaccinated there's emergency authorization pills treat COVID longer significant risk mortality anyone taken even basic steps protect (getting vaccinated and/or going doctor get sick). Nah I‚Äôm tired gaslit forever maskers like thinking masks normal big deal. suck always meant temporary.  buzzkill hear. really want get booster I‚Äôm engaging much higher risk activities pretty regularly now. I‚Äôm almost 7 months 2nd dose. I‚Äôm midst 1L law school hell really can‚Äôt afford commission 3-4 days right now. Booster going need wait reading week earliest. Good move. anecdotal, really think mine kept well bad outbreak work. hope everyone get one. Nope surely didn't. vaccine card, offered front sure they'd asked otherwise go different drug store someone worse doesn‚Äôt mean people going debt education can‚Äôt heartbroken it‚Äôs subpar. Yup, exactly.

Although Covid cases.  can't give cure deadly virus bc deadly virus?? said? wonder nonsense clicked said loud. continue punished

Being responsible grownup ""punished.""  know adulting brand new you, come on.... wearing mask grocery store unbearable burden. still go class, football games, restaurants vacations gyms parties even movies. 

Very little asked - fine. 2nd Moderna shot knocked couple days. booster gave sore arm. dose smaller much longer doses immune system response quite strong. people waited long time first second doses need booster. long people us wait get 2nd shot? There‚Äôs little risk company 2nd Moderna shot kicked ass too. got booster 10 months later experienced sore arm. felt great next day. Moderna's booster half regular dose, I'm sure immune system much less antibodies 6+ months later one month later. Vaccines much effective much higher uptake. drug profilaxis soon, also better vaccines. Plus permanent changes happen, decrease spread (more testing, care staying home sick, attention PPE hospitals, attention ventilation...).  Asserting doable think *will* get entirely speculation. Well. terminology bit off. pandemic over, new endemic disease. point stops pandemic becomes another disease.

However would generally better come us less kids around, global population lowers early modern levels humanity whole lot less problems future. again, damage already done.

There lot anti-vaxxers latched ""finding"" months ago, care whole ""the way pregnancy study complete stage within study period miscarriage"". mention bulk cases happen within 4-5 months year daily case rate flu season probably like 15x anti vaxxer fired, anti vaxxer? telling golfweek, trys tug heart strings first word headline Pretty excited data Pfizer's new antiviral pill. could game changer could reduce risk death hospitalization additional 90%. higher major cities US. NYC *alone* higher population Israel, even average density lower, we've got plenty population lives high higher density places. Canada way children cannot get vaccinated yet. Vaxxed eligible population probably high higher like 147,000 yesterday. looking good. experts I've read listened said: strongest immunity individual vaccine + infection. (watch Week Virology, haven't)

On population level, whether 60% pop vaccinated 40% getting covid enough debatable. 

Not area, really know! relate this. adhd home puts everything want work right arms reach. lot easier focus office without distractions Yeah, probably happen *very* long time. second dose ordered come quickly, then? Japan lower amount people cannot vaccinated countries. virus deadly flu virus.  Search 'mother gives birth dies covid', amazed many stories come up. concerning health system 19 cases, nearly household contacts. Boosters could help that. Israel seeing good results them. lot peoples' protection likely waning some, third shot. Given went 100 years since previous serious pandemic, think we'd extraordinarily unlucky another Covid-19 1918 Flu style pandemic within lifetimes.

At least think hope, right?  FINALLY concrete numbers regarding normalcy. We've literally asking since lock downs first started.

Too bad completely unreasonable number. Average flu cases normal year average tens thousands cases per day. normalcy number something like 50,000, 10,000. Yeah, that‚Äôs ok. They‚Äôll figure sooner later.

I also don‚Äôt think waning immunity *against infection* really bad thing. We‚Äôre seeing places got smacked waves 1 *n* lower case counts. know it‚Äôs taboo bring ‚Ä¶ Sweden seems OK spot right (it sacrifice much get there). Maybe good ‚Ä¶. ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù lack better term, sort *combined immunity* - protection vaccine + protection getting infected virus. dad kind allergy reaction flu shots. mom thinks egg, Covid vaccines. used get work.

So good reason still separate flu vaccine. 100% expected. Winters always like moving forward. Israel's average population density also likely much higher United States though.. Sure, that's around 6% 2 months ago, they're still quickly declining Ive never gotten flu vaccine either. run advertising campaigns 60s country never recommend. would get was. think younger people get flu vaccine? I've covid vaccine soon available. Im Canada got third dose week half ago, made feel good safer Never said that. said there‚Äôs way tell. see [75.08% fully vaccinated might mean Japan barely passed Canada yesterday.  even better stay fuck home got cold flu, use Instacart. 

However I'm weird, love getting flu, get sleep days, get cozy blankets, watch TV generally enjoy lump without guilt. basically enforced self care. Day 16 since tested positive covid. question is. anyone abdominal pain real bad covid? sides feel like someone wrapped tight rubber band around me. Burning sensation, general pain.

Sad truth supply chain issues aren‚Äôt going away anytime soon. really done time Thanksgiving Cloth masks catch droplets little. Since people going around refusing cover cough sneeze, find preferable people wearing nothing. I'm working, customers cough right face. added face shield, sometimes splatters walk away.  lol youre getting downvoted people dont want ""neggy vibes"" college experience? scam lol  Sure pregnant women back states getting booster? vaccinated spring, came back Japan I'm 16 weeks pregnant. Booster rollouts coming winter doctor told recommend currently.  Delta variants outpacing it. possible Delta last major change see COVID. Beyond there's guarantee mutation leads strain resistant vaccine. Israel 7 day average 431 cases - that's equivalent 15,000 population size US. whats npi  Good won‚Äôt write much personal medical situation here, complicated medical history, see physician treats lot patients fall category. uncommon medical reasons people would want delay another shot see level benefit deriving shots. heard today regardless cases keeping going they‚Äôll still mandate return office place beginning next year. excuse we‚Äôre going live accept new normal. Despite requiring vaccine smh. stupidity country. No, he‚Äôs calling eradication. he‚Äôs calling scenario going difficult achieve, especially waning immunity **against infection (but severe disease!)**

The *only* way get infections 10,000 per day continue distancing, masking, etc etc well future. can‚Äôt see way *without* masks/distancing stay 1/8th infection rate average flu year (see link) *more* infectious virus. you?  10,000 day? seven total Tokyo yesterday. still need mask time, sanitize still get temperature taken many establishments here. going back normal especially US; land free. It‚Äôs ‚Äúmoving goalposts‚Äù. It‚Äôs better understanding need use vaccines maximum benefit. 

When vaccines approved EUA needed vaccines urgently order save lives. didn‚Äôt luxury study different doses, different dosing intervals, different number doses series; takes years. safe worked short-term, great, get arms save lives, that‚Äôs did. Now, we‚Äôre learning more, time passed, they‚Äôre still incredibly safe, we‚Äôre determining need improve long-term efficacy.   OP comment, Palm Beach county would agree. time worn mask seen anyone else mask PBI sometimes Uber. Uber/Lyft people tell free take mask soon get car. go Publix, I‚Äôd say maybe 5-10% shoppers masked, rest not. Please point say illegal? simply said there's precedence figured court.

And continually insist idea I'm talking yet offer zero behind comments. 

I know I. Eh, still people vaccinated, immunocompromised poor health. Sure, statistically, people dying COVID - number people vaccinated dying small. still many people.

I already know two vaccinated people died COVID since Delta hit - quite old good health.

One good friend's dad fighting cancer. course vaccinated, due chemotherapy extremely immunocompromised. Luckily, avoided COVID thus far - catches it, that's probably him. We're talking public policy, science. Constantly changing public policy undermines public's trust policy.  Yeah, went concert like March 9 last year. Imagine shock less week later, world went lockdown. know people saying knew would get bad, guarantee basically one thinking would like this. I'm Broward (Coconut Creek) would say - lab setting, endgame could determined years years data, perfectly identifying 1 10 year risk covid, able really good understanding seasonality covid long immunity wanes, recurrence intervals new variants, etc etc. perfect lab setting, could *really good* understanding virus behaves population.

We aren‚Äôt lab setting. We‚Äôre people see stages lives slip away people want treat real life like lab study, *just wait see ____ might look like*. can‚Äôt that. 

I saw one comment poor college student begging normal school year, redditors bashing them. broke heart. 

The endgame get back normal. kids deserve option normal college experiences. deserve option normal young adulthood. Grandparents deserve option retire normally - travel, see grandkids - accept risk comes along that. need accelerate endgame, move towards society *semblance* normal. vaccines, therapeutics.

Maybe confused already. I‚Äôm Canada, doctors TV calling restrictions. isn‚Äôt normal, need move towards that. happens immunity booster wains? it‚Äôs formula. 
Do keep getting boosters? 
I dont know take faucci says anymore seriousness. 

Meanwhile seems though most? US pretty back somewhat normal. 
Some places show vax card it‚Äôs good, others don‚Äôt ask you‚Äôre good. 
NYC thanksgiving parade NYE Times Square. DC dropping indoor mask mandates. Int‚Äôl flights resumed without booster mandate. 

And aside cause bothers me,
Pfizer vax full FDA approved, yet we‚Äôre moving boosters Moderna J&amp;J. 
Now realize full approval matter time, still irks me. get Moderna shot without full. it‚Äôs applied august- what‚Äôs hold up? 
Really done deal since data EUA first place. 
Ok rant over. Yes there's chance infected. long ago it? may early enough test positive infected. taking PCR costs time feel free whenever. Abstract 
Background: Respiratory protective equipment recommended UK healthcare workers (HCWs) caring patients COVID-19 comprises fluid resistant surgical mask (FRSM), except context aerosol generating procedures (AGPs). previously demonstrated frequent pauci- asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection HCWs first wave COVID-19 pandemic UK, using comprehensive PCR-based HCW screening programme (Rivett et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2020). 
 
Methods: Here, use observational data mathematical modelling analyse infection rates amongst HCWs working 'red' (COVID-19) 'green' (non-COVID-19) wards second wave pandemic, substitution filtering face piece 3 (FFP3) respirators FRSMs. 
 
Results: Whilst using FRSMs, HCWs working red wards faced approximately 31-fold (and least 5-fold) increased risk direct, ward-based infection. Conversely, changing FFP3 respirators, risk significantly reduced (52-100% protection). 
 
Conclusions: FFP3 respirators may therefore provide effective protection FRSMs healthcare workers caring patients COVID-19, whether AGPs undertaken. Russian numbers unreliable downplay cases deaths. example 13th Nov official data daily deaths 1.241, daily new cases 39.256, total deaths 254.000 Rosstat says 462.000 deaths April 2020 September 2021. Experts think actual numbers New York Times reported total far higher official COVID-19 death count 642, newspaper said indication significant underreporting However, figures overall death rate Moscow April suggest excess mortality three times official Covid-19 death figure, calculated average rate past five years. ‚ÄòYou Can‚Äôt Trust Anyone‚Äô: Russia‚Äôs Hidden Covid Toll Open Secret

I recommend look excess death statistics Post data: long post

EDIT: also like Effects covid-19 pandemic life expectancy premature mortality 2020: time series analysis 37 highest reduction life expectancy observed Russia (men: ‚àí2.33, 95% confidence interval ‚àí2.50 ‚àí2.17; women: ‚àí2.14, ‚àí2.25 ‚àí2.03), United States (men: ‚àí2.27, ‚àí2.39 ‚àí2.15; women: ‚àí1.61, ‚àí1.70 ‚àí1.51)  personally dealt 8 close contacts work getting covid. Seven back work, one spent time hospital home oxygen. felt normal.  Maybe hysteria people, sure. something bears discussion lots us emotionally connected human lives we're discussing emotions tricky things. heart wants say 0 deaths, 0 long haul covid, teachers live, family members home live--but hearts like deal reality. That's mind. 

How emotional aspect living pandemic affected response? suspect studied extensively future.  headline misleading given happened yet anywhere. mean, masks distancing easiest least harming restrictions greatest return investment. combine masks vaccination really winning formula finally beat pandemic.

Unfortunately many adult children impatient ""get back normal"" they'd rather make situation worse much longer. Keep moving em. vaccine never going away like flu viruses colds. Strains mutations continue develop goal reduce spread (as be) making mandatory young people absolutely makes sense. probably die mean right spread others (and thus contribute killing people). Get vaccinated stay home! read Pfizer 6 month follow study. inability vaccine prevent overall death shocking me. waited see longer term data convinced all. Sad. Would great get decent vaccine. Well, things ""back normal"" everyone treating like over, long thing, unmask celebrate next spike infections deaths, certainly normal me.  world USA. still need parts Europe.  still blowsy mind normal Americans acting right now.

In Ontario, almost everything open nearly full capacity, still wearing masks vaccine passports.

I talk American colleagues, ditched masks back face face meetings almost every day. thousand times yes. Anything get damn masks. Nobody fake victimhood fake persecution complex better dominant religion+race+gender land. see ever becomes troublesome common cold still potential kill people fully vaccinated. Colds normally kill people even health issues. Colds permanently mess young person's health forever either. never going level cold. 

Two close friends mine, young, healthy fully vaccinated still dealing symptoms month later. One cough go away doctors saying may never go away. I'm triple vaccinated know matter time get hope leave long covid.  would mean willfully unvaccinated getting vaccinated.

Those people real problem. Usually, Tuesdays recap counts cases weekend. don‚Äôt now. Yes, know, includes health care providers, especially. expression feelings serious proposal. 

People tuberculosis refuse take meds even supervision known find confined duration treatment. legal public health measure. Requiring vaccinations school employment, etc. legal, too. makes sense intuitively. well-off people could afford flee vacation homes could pay long-term rental somewhere warm secluded so; NYC disaster zone anymore, they've since come back. feel like people live New York choice really like lifestyle, makes sense came back. FYI, babies get vaccines first year there‚Äôs shots every months. It‚Äôs pretty normal vaccines take multiple injections, it‚Äôs something people know happens they‚Äôre young remember. federal powers much limited.

Maybe time change slightly.

If health safety issue something affects country whole, rather certain individual states, feds power it.

This pandemic could probably licked year sooner feds power nationwide contact tracing, eventually vaccine mandate federally managed verifiable proof vaccination.

There's reason individual states deal something affects country whole. Think military; imagine state armed forces protect country external threats? It'd mess. I‚Äôve seen mask service signs Arizona, Nevada, southern cali, Utah far state certain mandates others don‚Äôt Also US big (relative parts world) *country size* outbreaks.

If look heat maps disease centers time becomes really clear. feels like point evaluating regions US instead entire landmass would better actionable data.

Not many actions even taken anymore. ""What God need ~~a starship~~ money?"" Three shots needs followed real exit criteria.I dont want masked isolating friends family forever. heart disease alone could say ""a 9/11 deaths every 2 days"" though.

Right. whole new thing that's killing many people one largest causes death.

I cannot fathom realize BAD is. bad.

And contagious! Never going happen unvaccinated. anytime soon people understood science, wouldn‚Äôt now.   Considering states it‚Äôs illegal track illegal mandate masks/vaccines/anything slow spread COVID, hitting 10k day nationwide hopeless country. We‚Äôll never get virus run everyone. Apparently it‚Äôs not. think known endgame right viruses mutate. Hopefully end like flu strains super-deadly managed unusually highly effective safe vaccines developed quickly. course, happen people get vaccinated.

It interesting see happens winter. COVID-19 (yes going fourth calendar year six weeks) seems upswing colder states people spending time indoors. FWIW, outside urban enclaves, Houston experience like rest American cities--probably middle ground acknowledging COVID trying get back normalcy. probably tell rural areas whole level. That's fucked. see cases occur within older people. vaccinate young people impact rather minimal. vaccinate older people (and bosst them) impact fatal cases quite high. sure: Everything helps, mandatory vaccination young people big ""less freedom"" relatively little impact hospitals. I'm saying we'll dealing surges full hospitals certain locations forever. We're never getting point society covid threat. always going problem us.

Also got news definitely guaranteed mild infection vaccinated. I'm triple vaccinated well. Almost everyone know fully vaccinated. I've known several people gotten Covid fully vaccinated exactly mild. Two close friends mine, young, healthy fully vaccinated, still symptoms months later. wouldn‚Äôt want listen grifter like Fauci either. fact even vaccines, masking testing disgusting. Someone cancel woman immediately.  Gobble grifter fauci knob. Really? went CVS Monday even ask ID.  checked box approved booster online walked got it. he's expert infectious respiratory disease government official?

Don't scapegoat Fauci like Fox Trump did. Nobody likes bad news. He's messenger. get shoot messenger hire someone tells want hear difficult situation considering novel virus people making easier understand virus let alone contain make sure mutate leaving Public Health best adapt situation. Fauci biggest Grifter health.  mall Wyoming yesterday see single mask mine. ""flying cargo planes full rubber dog shit Hong Kong?"" üòÜ  way religion works practice pick parts religion wish believe throw away parts 

Giving rise term ""Cafeteria Christians"", though course many followers religions guilty. literally 90% doctors agree with. hospitalizations death levels maintained? Well, really feel way actually proposing actually that. time, anyway.   Daily??? Cubes depressing imo, woo get stare bleak grey wall day. Let‚Äôs it. booster every year sure beats mask wearing.  aren‚Äôt moving goal posts. They‚Äôre changing based evidence. 

The mask mandates jazz metrics change remove restrictions goalpost moving happening. can't literally force people get vaccinated. That's rage antivaxers hilarious. Nobody going door door needling people Facebook would think differently. odd since told people get vaxxed booed him. Exactly. I'm fed up. supposed do, wore mask go out, stayed home point half feral, canceled vacations, etc. I'm supposed feel sorry people ignored reason shit still going on? 

Nope. Scientists worry means people:

That cannot eat deer meat? got flu booster time. Next day out. Fever, chills, aches. Next, next morning 100% normal except sore arm. know booster flu shot...  OP making presumption knowledge vacuum.  politicization half country refuses take it

The vaccination reluctance/refusal definitely Republican phenomenon, half Republicans indeed vaccinated. Planet needs breather humans. Yes sad. also gotta happen point  Well let's hope antivax movement accepts antivirals. don't, see next waves He's sides every single issue explanation whatsoever he's constantly changing mind. know shit, wants stay papers Probably variety factors, notable Brazil entering summer whereas USA entering winter. joke god sends drowning men boat, helicopter men rejects die. Maybe someone tell pastor.  Winter coming.

You thank antivaxers  nobody say.
 
I got headache day after.  sure shot coincedence,  either way bad.
 

I second shot.  3rd bit better. suspect however ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù individuals still able spread infection. shot advertised making symptoms less severe individual received shot. 

These ‚Äúvax baths‚Äù desperate attempt people forced something don‚Äôt agree continue earning money basic life activities. let‚Äôs take step further. Let‚Äôs say normally made 50k year figured something wrong illegal you‚Äôd make extra 37% year (18k) made 68k fine 10 cents instead 6.5 cents.

Edit: according google Amazon year year revenue 2019-2020 approximately 37%.  Got booster last week. side effects booster seems diminished compared second shot. muscle ache fatigue second shot. Booster slightly sore arm. Wife pretty sore arm symptoms booster too. Obviously everyone different trend I've seen booster symptoms bad number 2 (assuming COVID infection prior).  Apparently anxiety depression already qualify. Seeing last two years gone, basically everyone qualifies. problem getting every six months forever. Never want March 2020 happen again. taxpayers Texas approve frivolous expenditure dollars?

*I bot, action performed automatically.

No, politicians telling people lie get boosters. That's dangerous stupid game play.  Yes, absolute piece shit made blood boil point glad couldn‚Äôt get hands them. 

My mother fine, thankfully one ones got infected. dare FDA consider 'data' 'risk'. I'm follow science I'm get 5th booster shot! Please confuse HIV AIDS. language increase stigmatization people living HIV. 5-11% drop risk material improvement.

From article:

""Styczynski colleagues began developing strategy promote mask wearing, measures reminders health workers public places. ultimately tripled mask usage, 13% control villages 42% villages encouraged. researchers compared numbers COVID-19 cases control villages treatment communities.

The team found number symptomatic cases lower treatment villages control villages. decrease modest 9%, researchers suggest true risk reduction probably much greater, part SARS-CoV-2 testing people without symptoms whose symptoms meet World Health Organization‚Äôs definition disease.""

&amp;#x200B;

Mask usage increased 13% 42%. understanding correctly? Ahhh thank Thank you, appreciate it!  Purely anecdotal teach first grade. 27 unvaccinated (up past week) students room 7 hours without window opens. kids wearing masks. Giant crazy loud HEPA filter going constantly middle classroom. Decent amount cases community. one case class far year. respect, agree stated opinions. Sometimes wish could become sort batman like masked vigilante sneaks around vaccinating unvaccinated idiots. Sneaking around giving shots disappearing darkness. state records check? Mass, 2 weeks ago 52% cases breakthrough (4600) week it‚Äôs 49% (5300). Saying it‚Äôs hitting unvaccinated incorrect. likely hitting unvaxxed anyone got shot 6+ months ago. Include reporting vaxxed stop walking around like they‚Äôre invincible. need booster shots everyone. N95s available since April 2020 various stores including Home Depot. course would. Gotta make things actively worse middle crisis!   Dude N95s available year now. personally least 10-15 closet rn yet used.

Also, mask mandate useless. people actually following mandate? enforced? 

I mean come literally airborne disease. someone say ‚Äúlockdowns don‚Äôt work‚Äù definition disease cannot spread easily everyone isolated/masked up? Like goverment country? Bruh people Asia universally mask winter like armchair anthropologists seem implying.

People habit wearing masks they‚Äôre sick that‚Äôs really given. lot people never traveled East Asia really trying pretend know they‚Äôre talking about. think pretty reasonable start requiring ignorant people get vaccinated, vaccinate kids eligible, administer boosters, etc...

Places actually followed enforced precautions we'll done pretty well proportion well supposed reduce eliminate spread COVID-19. Okay. do. Thank you.  Narrator Voice: fact, \_were\_ dumb....   never read anything like that.  read vaccination rates stay low likely scenerio.

Unvaccinated people scape goat. surprising, ppl relate vaccine immunity. problem is, vax doesn‚Äôt that, aspect isn‚Äôt communicated properly. vax‚Äôd still catch spread covid. much longer, get month two more.  impression coronaviruses mutated less often ye olde rhinovirus RNA correction?    statistics reflected large pockets unvaccinated, people traveling (whether different states different neighborhoods). takes 1 unvaccinated person potentially kill, like breakthrough covid pretty big thing. I'm trying call anything, making point assumptions, particularly groups people tend closely aligned like many wedding guests are, dangerous make. Also, good vaccination rates - good. awesome, be, still pretty dangerous. That's all. mutates way, way less. Without actually knowing guy, sounds lot like 'reopening anxiety'. 

Because situation going long, we've gotten used COVID measures 'the new normal' rowing back causes many anxiety. much people actively *wanting* permanent shutdown classic 'fear change' fresh coat paint.

To give benefit doubt, he's possibly thinking something like 'if keep wearing masks planes minimises risk another pandemic sweeping across international borders future'. would naive assessment closest think 'logical' one context. Cdc bungled pandemic. Blood test place them. protein best BAU/ml units (say want test pevels vaccination).  monkey üêí wants $500,000? like 50 million endangering people's lives!!!

Anecdotal brother took two doses hepatitis B vaccine kid, took three. two decades we've done test roughly time - almost zero antibodies (and given booster shot), plenty (I think result 3 something like brother, 400, sure units).

The study tracked women vaccinated early pregnancy pregnancies ended within 3 months. analyzed ratio (birth vs miscarriage).

Not surprisingly, results overwhelmingly miscarriage. human gestation period 9 months, real reasons pregnancies end within 3 months vaccination miscarriage (presumably due non-vaccine reasons), abortion premature birth.

**That far understood it. may wrong.** knew happening back Jan 2020. March 16 scared life  virus decides significantly mutate common coronaviruses eastern Europe understand complete lack trust govt think Germans like that.

A big part current Germany ""eastern Europe"" 45 years.

After reunion, people east moved rest Germany.

Some states east Germany lost 25% poplulation within years reunion.  I'm Netherlands tell things over. us you. removed pretty much every restriction including masks September, cases around 2k per day country. Today's number 20,000 positive tests. one day. 85% eligible population vaccinated. Hospitals bursting seams many restrictions reimplimented. disheartening.   felt bit crazy hours went bed woke fine next morning. first second doses much worse.

Point is, everyone different commission 3-4 days much minority reaction. fuck point. control factors, including psychosomatic factors (hence studies needing double blind). isolate effect side effect every shot. (Lots things affect menstrual cycles, including non-medical stuff like stress exercise.)   want prove case, feel free set studies (but learn first).

No way double-blind study would actually allowed ethics commision.

You would give vaccine control group worldwide pandemioc going on... Wow. 500k. Amazon. able recover? know employees health care got sick won't. Thank God California. Ironically flights one 'COVID safe' enclosed spaces air continuously recycled. roommate genuinely believes logic really applied anything that's indoors. Good luck that, U.K. roughly 90% 12s vaxxed we‚Äôre still seeing 30-40k cases per day 5x less people.

Granted health system isn‚Äôt bursting seams thanks high vax rate Fauci dreaming thinks US get 10k cases per day, possibly ever. pretty much reaction flu shot Moderna booster. (I spaced 10 days apart worried double side effects.) Definitely blessed speed research developing treatment options. least 70% total state 1 shot. 60%+ both. u include adults vast majority people both. 

Only rural counties places like Huntington Beach would bet even comes close 50%.

Not saying it‚Äôs perfect it‚Äôs pretty damn good tbh. earnestly go day LA county probably never encounter unvaccinated person.   know someone working KUL initially told yes indeed quite excited yellow fever part. idea would vaccine could really help places like Africa etc solving covid primarily yellow fever MN, summer average 2 deaths week. Yesterday, 51 people died Covid. Delta hitting outstate unvaccinated people. sad preventable right now. FREE vaccine available. Oh, well. Nevermind, answer that. truly want hear literally anything else you. Cooool #1 know nothing day day life exist world, #2 say risk killing someone, based variables I'm aware plus statistics research basically zero risk, #3 gtfo either calling hysterical, kinda, well, hysterical, calling covid response hysterical, kinda, well, grossly inaccurate, ignorant, dangerous, foolish, etc. etc. etc.

The fuck even goal here? actually trying convince stranger internet I've killed people via flu? so, possible end?? Food poisoning kills 3,000 people US every year - definitely small. Knowing this, cooking others, would refuse serve anything medium?

In similar vein, car crashes kill around 100 people day. always obey speed limit? ever drive tired one drink? Thats good point far Brazil goes. like dumb people cared day one. problem much worse Pfizer vaccine first given EUA FDA/CDC literally everyone age 16+, Moderna 18+, etc.

In fact, explicitly factor FDA/CDC's decision. responsibility prioritizing distribution jointly falls Feds States, every State handled initial vaccine distribution rules slightly differently.  That‚Äôs masks N95 nothing. maskless work 5 months zero Covid cases, cal too. Fauci 80 years old. think lot times talks he's talking general population, 80-year-olds (who probably much normalcy). say, problem. I'm watching see Israeli experts say whether fourth eventually needed. seem top this, seem report promptly without dancing around. There's lot things criticize Fauci for, honestly think know what's going ground? too.  kids first dose yesterday. back complete normal 5 weeks regardless case count. Good! wanna country? would fight war too. feel anymore.

 Earlier felt really bad people losing jobs since I've seen give shit everyone else vaccinated fact detest us getting it. said, fuck em all, deserve comes futures. Idiots. job basically said ‚ÄúYeah fuck immunocompromised vulnerable workers, don‚Äôt care die‚Äù  probably confusing pediatric dosage booster dosage.

Pfizer's first two adult doses 30mcg, booster also 30mcg

Moderna's first two 100mcg, booster 50mcg

Pfizer's pediatric two doses 10mcg

Moderna's pediatric two doses 50mcg So, assume live disagree based local data? everyone jump immediately idea annual vaccine? people aware Covid, flu, nothing else?

Most vaccines require series boosters grant long-term immunity. Maybe Covid require annual booster, wouldn‚Äôt bet given current info.

Here link typical booster schedule US recommended CDC interested compare non-flu vaccines: courts shit track record determining ""compelling interest"" state, ever compelling interest, vaccines pandemic one them. Nothing certain death taxes. We'll find soon enough. I‚Äôm glad live country that‚Äôs 848 COVID deaths total, instead one that‚Äôs nearly 800,000. own, suppose. Even vaccinated getting exposed often getting infected needlessly. 

Delta means everyone get exposed, eventually worst part breakthrough infection *fear*. logically knew odds favor. reading posts HCA sub there's thought back mind gonna die vent.

Just take seriously, obviously. lot unvaxxed people crowding ICU right stuck beliefs big deal thought could tough somehow. get sent hospital long monoclonal antibodies could done good point they're serious trouble. kind breathing complication scary! Lots time spent watching O2 stats. feel lucky I've never asthma anything (my wife surprise well controlled now). Ahhh that‚Äôs madness. Canada around 1900 cases Nov 16. borders opening, afraid number increasing. Worried family Windsor. harm keeping status quo certain holiday surge?

What reason so, considering stats around DC? Empty hospitals, low positivity rate, extensive testing, highly vaccinated. 

Do live here? need wait. Many people getting flu vaccine covid booster time. Go vegetarian! heard complaint number times. extent agree, changed messaging lie. White lies OK. rest changes evolving situation unavoidable. need educate people science something static, really best guess given incomplete information. I‚Äôm really tired hand wringing changing messaging. situation changed. Consistent messaging lies.  We'll end experts eventually near bickering whether we'll need annual biannual shot, think admirable goal get near 70%+ uptake biannual shot think needs realism that's going official ""bar"" success going lot stragglers reaching that.

I also carry risk spreading whatever got cooked steak people choose partake. I'm scared covid personally, take simple steps mitigate risk spreading someone else, I'm going it.

Anyway, CDC approves steaks cooked medium, steak fully cooked, even guidelines. Ok seriously though, seems like everyone got dog pandemic monster hands! sure it‚Äôs lack socialization/having people over, they‚Äôre mostly first time dog owners it‚Äôs INTENSE. 5 month old child, unless medically fragile, statistically pretty safe COVID. Safer flu auto accidents. would case 70 year old grandmother cousin diabetes, children much better shape That's relief hear. work kids even though know protected +mask always wonder get mild... new antivirals may prevent that. Also eventually everyone boosted immunity combined natural greatly reduce yearly waves. mRNA vaccines get updated reflect Delta sequence (not sure that's already case though). kids vaccinated.  agree done convenience absence risk. However, weren‚Äôt wrong scientifically fact small (less 10% vaccinated) population given approval seen concerning level waning immunity. makes sense- gave dose every adult sizable hit young, healthy people. surprised initially wasn‚Äôt larger dose elderly like flu, think also name convenience. agree creating distinctions excessively complicated communication blunders mess didn‚Äôt ignore science.  would find loose dangling mask tickly uncomfortable. get either. idea gaps.

Cases matter get enough people vaccinated. certain point, want get vaccinated. work go school Well that‚Äôs Fauci‚Äôs opinion make things better, guess we‚Äôre gonna make worse spite.

Adding ‚Äò/s‚Äô you‚Äôll know that‚Äôs real opinion, holy crap: comments here‚Ä¶ coworker would say working really touchy program have. looked weird database would corrupt whole department would 8+ hours. thinking last night idea ‚Äúsafe‚Äù number cases per day would be, came number 5,000. would mean approx 70,000 active cases given time. Maybe get number booster recommended individuals at-risk I‚Äôm little old club scene, believe it‚Äôs temperature check proof vaccination. bars restaurants, contact tracing masks unless unless you‚Äôre table. places limited seating while, that‚Äôs eased.

I can‚Äôt think anything that‚Äôs still closed offhand, biggest inconvenience really strict limitations enter country right now. There‚Äôs international tourism speak currently, they‚Äôre still working borders open. breakthrough infection kinda confirms vaccine wears six moth period . OK. exactly long COVID? criteria? haven‚Äôt seen definitive answer yet. think project Colorado onto DC. low positivity rate, high vaccination rate, empty hospitals, deaths. Failure mask stage pandemic leads bad place. 
We far vaccinated not. fact 90% effective everywhere. Anyone thought would impenetrable, sterilizing immunity little understanding world. never allowed release it. one shot makes freak‚Äôn confusing comes boosters. think meant poor people. People like say follow science. do, goalposts expected change time. isn‚Äôt game. vaccines require multiple doses others don‚Äôt. annual flu vaccine flu variants change yearly vaccine well. far booster efficiency wanes time. 

Seems unlikely 3 doses vaccine standard long run. 

My guess 8-12 month boosters life manufactures adjust vaccine concoction match newer variants. 

I would also love science break increase speed vaccines approved also upping safety. March 14th birthday went friends. next day we‚Äôre locked inside panicking.. surprised 4th shot specific Delta varient. scenario see us needing boosters frequently zoonotic spillback event (from deer, likely) get another mutation scale delta, we'll wait see happens situation.

I would expect virus-resistant mutation take place humans, animals. find zoonotic spillback event dangerous?   not. Anyone thought little understanding world. kills grandmas.  exactly. can't really stop spread. fully vaccinated ride out.  Covid leads lot asymptomatic spreaders. Everybody needs wear mask pandemic lot people idea they're sick testing much. say get used masks. They're healthy. do, people shunned due news blood clots. I'm not. I'm willing pop inside briefly pickup though. Outdoor dining fine too. lot people misgivings that. hope feel better soon. Welp everyone folks die guess get closer immune compromised vaccination little.

Also disinformation. vast majority immunocomprimised antibody response mRNA booster. cases, takes second booster. Thee SEVERELY immunocomprimised people less effectiveness. small Point being, clear cut vaccines prevent spread better worse masks. 

NO. misinformation. Incredible people real vermin. Actually putting frighteners pregnant women sick gets . height length same? kids vaccinated want unvaccinated adult spreader infecting them. also want hospitals overcrowded operations habe delayed. hard understand get it, that's simply want listen. Go get vaccinated, protect others. agree, really sucks people college. I'm sorry missing much. please let change set do! Things suck still stay focused goal. two things true time. 20 years going blip life want take long term view major decisions Yet trying use platform push nonsense conspiracy theories claim victimhood. platform taken her.  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really fair blanket statement 350 million people least half taking covid precautions seriously stop. Please use button. don‚Äôt, news article specific weekend calculations. Overall there‚Äôs certainly unvaccinated deaths, comment unintentionally misleading. 1985, world thought could catch HIV sitting toilet seat shaking hands. Then, smart people LEARNED true. However, dinosaurs still think old info true. goal post moved, people stubborn, narrow minded morons. That's good timing since natural immunity RSV fucked we're stsrting worried toddler. antivaxer parents hiring lawyer writing ‚Äúthesis‚Äù religion dad‚Äôs work requiring vaccinated January. mom got mad sympathetic slightest. Anyway, I‚Äôm staying alone holidays again. cannot tell someone covid far comfortable room wearing mask.

No, would comfortable, masks simply effective would room. safe COVID someone wearing mask. Show source says vaccinated better preventing spread masked.

FFS, full COVID disinfo. Reported. better vaccinated. Wait minute, according CDC, flu season October May, average. 242 days. Flu infected estimated 21 million people 2019-20. That's 86k cases day. We're supposed get point basically eradicate virus order return normal? Sometimes Fauci says shit makes absolutely zero sense

I'm using flu example. COVID deadly flu, spreads similarly likely somewhat seasonal, like flu, decent comparison case.   I've big advocate Taiwan handled pandemic, how's nightlife socialization working there? activities restricted, any? Aside masks contact tracing, people able socialize somewhat normally? Shot AZ pulling weight 3.5k per day. Shot AZ pulling weight 3.5k per day. Nursing care here, same. get flu shot protect clients anyway hope combine it. would think so. seems, pandemic least, move like (as grandma would say) molasses January.  We‚Äôve seen past year pandemic almost solely unvaccinated. *especially* booster shots.

There very, little logical reason vaccinated forced wear masks. Adults us Europe lot world able get vaccinated months months now, it‚Äôs longer responsibility protect won‚Äôt protect themselves. 

Little kids getting vaccinated. Ok, that‚Äôs one thing. adult spaces like bars gyms done away mask requirements months ago.  good old ""healthy people need see doctor"" section bible. Quoted lot people opposed variolation suggested Cotton Mather shortly died smallpox. What‚Äôs wrong Pfizer? referring training physicians. familiar nursing school constraints, given number nursing schools, probably much less stringent. still issue early career nursing burnout fact takes ~5 years train ICU nurse. Another way nursing care stretched increasing patient nurse ratios crisis situation, puts increased strain individual nurses. BIG BUCKS WHAMMIES BIG BUCKS WHAMMIES  non-medical advice USA another place supply shortages, yes, get booster. FDA probably going approve 18 plus tomorrow anyway, looking like 3 dose regimen going best way maximize protection now. everyone takes birth control. it‚Äôs added risk‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre replacing birth control. 

When limited, sure, people shouldn‚Äôt shunned J&amp;J. others available, take it?  vaccinated? Boosted? so, worry. would at-home tests every couple days extra safety, chances small. I‚Äôm sure totally wrong, there‚Äôs less technical skills comparison accounting, nursing, engineering, etc. gotta find balance. can't expect everybody follow hard line. RSV corona. 13yo's first play. wanted him. Wearing mask sitting next people auditorium great solution mitigate risk. sick covid, yeah, would skip it. No, apparently unvaccinated - anti-vaxxers - moving goal posts. homework! yet. shots make feel pretty awful couple days I'm trying schedule time downtime. find way, we‚Äôve faced worse history. vaccines stopping vast majority serious illness deaths huge positive, regular boosters next 10+ years won‚Äôt major burden lives never said don't. 

What saying giving Normal false sense security calling normal.

You best prove idiots Facebook right. ask seriousness - think take get ""over?"" vaccines didn't/won't get us there, look forward to, think happen, lead safe take masks? Thanks sharing that. 

I edited tweet explain believe opinion, merely first place saw news. Everything proposed far end mask wearing wasn't. there's enough go around, though. Otherwise leave older sicker people first. 8 vax one, deal.  +++. They‚Äôre experts reason. Maybe vaccines ideal, cannot afford falling sick. believe reading something reddit/Google experts. authority. Getting booster tomorrow/Friday.  Stay well friend. done booster ?  That's... that's really low. Much lower US.  wish could get vaccinated parents let me, people bring articles like vaxteen thing know works...

It's fair, happening me... too, huh? Man, glad boring old politicians back.   Explain however youlike , tell east, health minister day one. looked other. followed rules. one best performances continent Nova Scotia.

Sure, population dense. here, saw behaved. You‚Äôre ingesting Lysol right. Agreed system works company‚Äôs right mandate want. also think you‚Äôre right saying ‚Äúif don‚Äôt want protect that‚Äôs you‚Äù. Everyone choice put body, I‚Äôm getting vaccinated Monday that‚Äôs choice. think it‚Äôs interesting think types things society mandate merits mandate? vaccine fully effective mixed signals public health officials long term effectiveness (can‚Äôt get covid vaccinated, need achieve herd immunity, need 2 vaccines, etc.) merit full compliance society? People want answers that‚Äôs CDC makes decisions sometimes without knowing happen long term. Sometimes decisions held however they‚Äôre cemented reality public taken bad faith path it‚Äôs absolute best final way think happened far many times. Bunch us work got Moderna happened roll way. One person got Pfizer rubbed faces doctor told best one. Lots eye rolling ensued. person's real quiet vaccines last month so, ha ha... matter? They're hurting anyone. Maybe good reason, like they're minutes away next destination, want bother taking mask putting back again. also submit information insurance company register. Could insurance come back say lied, try charge fraud? Asking, someone anxious get booster, worried insurance company (not technically high risk myself, living immediate family are) What‚Äôs serious illness / hospitalisation / deaths like? Assume much better previously despite ongoing case numbers? Oops, corrected, fault. inhaler ""spacer"" - spray inhaler spacer like holding chamber takes 6 breaths it. idea nebulizer quicker (and requires hold still breaths). He's flovent Albuterol another steroid starts problems sick since got those. know hospital 3 trips tried Albuterol respond it, sometimes younger kids don't. we're kinda waiting see happens next time gets sick! last seen that's said guess delta came along  Yep friend tested positive yesterday really sick. 2 Moderna less 5 months ago.

I get pushback. really can't get mind space would want breathing random people's unfiltered breath. risk it? Sure people know survived covid, without lifelong health problems disability. 2 died.

Put n95 on, done deal stop spread, reduce chances mutations save lives. like people would prefer pretend covid longer issue actually anything stop spread. 

Big winter surge coming everyone putting faith solely vaccines precautions. Vaccines supposed fallback final layer defense. Cases mean nothing, death count going true tell we're woods. Genuine question may answered already curious. 


I recovered Covid 3 weeks ago. Seems unnecessary get booster least couple months. leave me? Keelhauling?  2 mRNA + full dose? Moderna half dose booster count? CBT  Yeah, except SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus, doesn‚Äôt mutate anywhere near fast influenza. 

I get people comparing boosters COVID flu shots it‚Äôs really apples oranges. missed point. even go play ran kids knew sick? I'm fine idea wearing mask necessary, really necessary wear one everytime leave house? Even I'm triple vaccinated? long? seems like end this.  look angle I'm looking actual effects behavior. want know someone's motivation behavior is, look results behavior. 

Many people ""disregard authority/aversion told do"" worship Jesus Trump anything religious political leaders tell do, I'm buying it. need pessimist. fact virus go away. become endemic virus least, behaves similar flu.

Experts assume Corona become virus mostly spread among children (and therefore dramatic, since children likely recover it), since older folk protected. experts say take years even decades.

I mean yeah, steps correct, rapid spread must prevented, matter ultimate goal is. also important stay real here, live whole life virus. affect us much point, there. Speculation. Many vaccines require 3/4 course shots. T/B cell response key thing. Furthermore, nasal vaccines tested may increase immunity upper airway (mucosa) would lessen replication advantage Delta vs strains. even talking about. 

Things aren‚Äôt ‚Äú100% normal time.‚Äù 

They 100% normal sometimes.

And bear resemblance old normal others.

This isn‚Äôt false sense security. rapid tests vaccinations (incl. boosters), risk truly low. interventions absolutely help‚Äîit‚Äôs insane argue don‚Äôt. Fauci say wants, we're tired it. People going giving fuck ever. effective Covid treatment put pandemic behind us. he? thought herd immunity always came much higher percentage. expecting since Covid first hit. virus mutates, similar colds flus. vaccine colds, flu shots every year. Therefore likely expect regular Covid shots. Hopefully continue evolve shots effective variants, absolutely none news immunity waning boosters needed surprise. It‚Äôs grocery store unless guess everyone privileged are. I‚Äôm 100% vaccinated work space wearing masks 40 hours week governor says indefinitely. 

People aren‚Äôt going take forever we‚Äôll get far right nutjobs public office promise let us get back normal. It‚Äôs happening one way another. least safely still power to. 

Fauci probably safe 2024 he‚Äôll retirement age unless enjoys spotlight much. possible. forever masker public health officials fired new Republicans heartbeat. 

This shit get President Desantis. You‚Äôre delusional think America normalize permanent restrictions. want add. vaccine immune system functioning exactly supposed to.

Permanent immunity infection never feature vaccine. get shot, memory cells encounter new (weakened version of) virus, figure right antibodies make, fight virus.

Antibodies eventually die-off, memory cells store information remake next curious, think it‚Äôs lousy major? remember, Fauci nature position absolutely reason call 100% lockdown moment someone sneezes somewhere. balance economy public health, consider reelection chances, maximize health. metric success surplus deaths, that's it.

For context, US has, right now, per capita COVID rate less half live, even bothered lockdowns, measures, nothing. Masks public transport, that's it. Now, I'm saying reasonable, treat 10000 infections day population 350+ million *baseline* normalcy is, simply put, ridiculous. Americans self-centered combat global pandemic. Oppressive? point loved ones die. Everyone potential carrier deadly virus. can't lax it. Hopefully it'll sweetie form then.

Or better yet, active ingredient tonic water. assertion ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt even provide immunity delta variant‚Äù true, wouldn‚Äôt make sense.

But assertion true. Boosters increase efficacy symptomatic infection back 90-95%, even delta. Pfizer‚Äôs trial good results FDA told stop trial submit data. bet gets approved later next month. current vaccines provide full immunity anyways, waning immunity. moreso protect hospitalization severe cases anything else. guess critical part here, going forward, hospital overload deaths. hospitals fucked now? far that? (to point early days covid). big worry me. also many deaths happening compared bad previously - could reach heights somehow despite we‚Äôre vaccinations explain making sacrifices = 100% normal time. 

Jesus, like people called PATRIOT act security theater, lining tickets exact theater.

That false sense security must feel real good huh? Yup, say was. too. half country still refuses take it

Over 70% adults fully vaccinated 80% one dose.  According DW fairly easily you‚Äôre vaccinated. Considering aren‚Äôt lockdowns. got breakthrough infection almost exactly six months later day. extreme fatigue I'm thankful severe symptoms. Yeah real possibility instead. never got tested that. spent 2 weeks home mostly better. still took months regain part strength. lost 20 lbs sick lost another 100lbs following months. 

Sometimes get flu shot didn‚Äôt 2019 I‚Äôve never sick destroyed before. getting older though. Even almost 2 years later still health issues getting sick 2020. Sucks.

*edit* whatever got boss mild cold. coworkers symptoms 5 people got crazy sick took months get back normal too.  really overreaction IMO.

I don‚Äôt agree guidance issued say result ‚Äúheads rolling‚Äù really bit much.   shit wear one home, want leave house, put one on.  it‚Äôs obligatory.  infecting killing people. change things understanding them. It‚Äôs evidence incompetence.

There.

Stop pedantic. can't decide get booster? greater risk? 20f good health underlying conditions. do? wanted type 2000. Thanks Netherlands small lockdown planned.

Actually, healthcare workers infected SARS detectable antibodies least 12 years afterwards: Clu. far understand it, mRNA vaccines production complicated expensive *originally* set up, running scaled much easily vector-based vaccines several processes (incl. quality control) time-consuming (and try produce).

Which means that, despite higher cost, mRNA useful producing billions doses goal.

Or, analogy: choice might either buy 10 Rolls Royce give away 10 people drive, buy 6 Chevrolets give away, 6 people drive. course 10 Rolls Royce far expensive, decide money urgent problem goal provide much people car possible, Rolls Royce way go.

Positivity 20% high.

Hospital ICUs full. Vienna state BEST per capita Austria right now, factor 2 compared average 3 compared Salzburg Upper Austria. mind boggling letting situation go without action.  amount shots matter.

The time since last shot matters, supposedly. really upset PA isn‚Äôt allowing people booster point. Really lagging  Explain think limiting transmission end pandemic sooner? know mantra past 2 years, think people need understand literally need allow transmission happen, UK doing. Otherwise we're never leaving masks behind. We'd likely, scenario, reach equilibrium people - old, sick, immunocompromised - getting yearly covid booster, infection would still dangerous them. half population got flu shots season prior covid's arrival, I'd imagine sort people get yearly boosters large overlap people getting yearly flu shots. large portion risk, whose employment dictates it. like talking brick wall. common ground. Maybe eating deer meat previously infected gives antibodies protection Covid? impossible people selfish  Keep mind booster restore immunity, hospital protection stays 90% even 6 months Pfizer signs waning  know people upvoting this, ridiculous comment. go know. thought two shots would enough, clearly, not. we're changing. crystal ball see works brand new virus brand new vaccine vs doesn't.

We luxury multiple studies different times doses wait year two determine long lasts.

So stopping means booster thus change messaging. hard understand?

The shot makes 99% people bit tired next day, completely free. something gripe about.

Not mention, boosters common every single vaccine. every year, like flu. every 5 years. every 10 years. Hell, anthrax vaccine military takes FIVE not-very-pleasant doses get full protection boosters every year. new stuff.

With 3rd enough last long while? know. CRYSTAL BALL. fault public policy medical science works. we're learning virus

As learn physics, way build structures change. learn anatomy, way treat human body change. say thing covid feel like necessarily outcome boosters understood necessary.

If get tetanus shot 20 years, fully vaccinated tetanus. Thank linking video something already know. vaccinated sacrificing lives due terrorists refuse vaccinated.

So, think ok.

People need live lives. idiotic restrictions need end. people realizing geriatric Fauci dumber box J&amp;J covid vaccines. German STIKO recommends 6 months basic immunisation regardless vaccine, except J&amp;J (4 weeks there). sounds way expensive shot....  depends treatments work. seen information binding site Pfizer's protease inhibitor (ritonavir), possible find good protease inhibitors bind sites virus like SARS-CoV-2 extremely unlikely mutate, i.e. protein sites across coronaviruses changed millions years. need molecule binds it, efficient permit low enough dosage, tolerated well humans, ideally shelf-stable pill form.

A similar tactic may eventually lead us universal coronavirus vaccine. bit complicated, though, since need find sites make (or bodies make) protein immune systems respond, resulting antibodies bind correct site viral surface. spike protein easiest/already known candidate. Check Portugal's case trajectory past week so, continue next couple weeks. following rest Europe case trend. Vaccines apparently little effect transmission, least societal level. small disease burden though, that's great. However prevent several experts call extraordinary measures limit transmission. that's problem, we're going concentrate case level, pandemic measures literally never end. Got booster last month... keep forgetting mask work meetings etc. used super guard sort thing just... dunno. kind want wear one set good example, I'm tired haha. I'm just... tired. really. CDC defense project FDA regulatory body. Neither entities recommend dosage time tables medical procedure including vaccines. literally job. manufacturer conducts trail proves product supposed better placebo. FDA reviews verifies findings votes approve it. That's it. People damn minds thinking FDA CDC actually ones decide comes vaccines. respect, FDA basically says, ""yup, trails appear valid"" CDC says, ""We seeing lower infection rates people this, please this."" That's it.  long til 4 shots standard? CMV: be. Flovid sounds cooler. think likely, sure thing. Lots vaccines 3 dose regimen, also possible COVID could effective 2 dose regimen, 6 month gap important (3 weeks incredibly short dose spacing). sad? baby home that‚Äôs months old. I‚Äôm concerned respiratory illnesses considering Flu RSV especially serious babies. site linked e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Planes, buses, trains, hospitals, doctors. Maybe add pharmacies list safe keeping. wearing mask walk seat 90% trip restaurant/bar bullshit gotta go LA, show proof vax stay masked. Yeah countries beat Covid early less worries talks booster shots

If people complied protocols allowed vaccinated early can, would come point we're gonna need booster shots yearly shots, like countries FWIW side effects Pfizer #2 12 hours severe. know others got Moderna booster week sore arm headache. We're different, impossible predict. I'll definitely go back Pfizer need round 4. Masks social distancing may force places, like live around Seattle. recently went rural parts Washington mask-wearing dropped noticeably since last year. imagine people many parts country going go nuts holidays year make last year.     suggestion still 6 months booster getting like month 5 alright? got AZ end July meant traveling weeks won‚Äôt 6 month time. wondering get away getting booster 5 months.  I'll take mask wearing shots day  Uhhhh, death isn‚Äôt thing fear novel virus. Children 80+ years life ahead, long term sequelae COVID infection won‚Äôt known decade more.

That fear? That‚Äôs called good fucking parent.  late, bozo One thing add perspective - kind thing happened repeatedly human history. true say probably turning point - major pandemics usually are, also last forever. 

There time cholera seemed like major thing would always dealing with, country afford sewage water treatment, virtually eliminated. 

COVID research end vaccines developed. People still working better treatments effective vaccines. people still researching virus works. may take us time, done working problem yet.   Yes. signed endless shots make something better. Cheers happy holidays. tested positive RSV NYE concert run Madison Square Garden January 2020, really threw ass. went back work two weeks pneumonia heavy fevers, although doctor said longer contagious, remember feeling guilty coughing.

I wore mask, got many bizarre looks coworkers- Covid people's radars time. ended Covid month later, December 2020, pneumonia three times calendar year.

I used work pediatrics never got RSV despite many kids coming it- adult, super easy get, do, rough. remember bunch friends also got swore Covid, RSV sweeping area pretty intensely time.

I got full dose Pfizer third shot weeks ago I'm immune compromised medications take lungs Covid damaged. important people realize damage Covid randomly inflict otherwise younger healthy person. Sure it‚Äôs good idea theory, one going here. think talking virus Yeah Moderna start first two, got Pfizer booster. Personally like ""one shot, traditional vaccine?

But outdoor masking really depends are. Richmond, yeah, still masking outside likely due higher Asian pop school kids. Marina? one's masking outdoors. Cool, tell state‚Äôs governor allow under-65s pre-existing conditions get booster. think that's true. pay really close attention, release goal anymore. Finland communicable disease act provides mandatory 47 Communicable Diseases Act allows imposition vaccination situation infectious disease threatens functioning society,"" would turn pass responsibility vaccinated individual state. used run process base 90‚Äôs. Realistically, Honorable Discharges. mentioned below, Dishonorable Bad Conduct Discharges require court martial. 

Administrative Discharges (of would be) give member ability request Administrative Discharge Board (think mini court martial), would still bit PITA would bog base legal departments months. Legal offices go Honorable path avoid this. type thing went Don‚Äôt Ask. Don‚Äôt Tell. Well, coronavirus existed nature long Covid-19 pandemic started, could say doesnt really end unless evolution gets rid virus live one vaxxed places country boosters available adults weeks. got mine weeks ago. incredibly low transmission rates. 

We're still strict mask mandates. there's sign changing time soon. 

I suspect mask mandates disappear pro covid precautions crowd stops complying. soon.    doesn‚Äôt make feel better someone worse doesn‚Äôt mean people can‚Äôt heartbroken personal struggles. 

I mean really, dare concerned covid America Russia much worse? Think Russians!/s Yea, work indoors outdoors. Maybe super special anti-fog talent, idk. fogging I‚Äôve ever glasses temperature differential without masks least approve needle-less version? Cause battle getting first two..  Yeah going ask. health reasons couldn‚Äôt get first set shots July‚Ä¶ getting booster wait January? really considered vaccinated even though still good first two shots? Good news Colorado guess aren‚Äôt worst.  think big difference people yearly flu shot made variant changes, vaccine wears needs refill basically Pretty sure I'm add another number. step dad positive im displaying symptoms. got vaxxed April wear mask.  Slow in, what, two weeks?,

Ctfd. Vaccines protect initial infection, totally prevent it. Despite headlines, CDC still says breakthrough infections rare. rare case breakthrough infection, vaccine diminishes chances spreading others. totally eliminate it. 

But importantly, exception ill elderly among us, chances becoming hospitalized dying covid statistically pretty close zero vaxxed. 

Point even free right now, hospitals even close capacity saw first two waves. sure though would. Covid big part lives going forward. someone J&amp;J got got covid months ago. really reason get shots anytime soon? feel like get antibodies checked first.  gave two separate cards, one shot, pre-stickered every morning handed out. everywhere go show proof keep explaining two cards one line filled. CS actually. Going virtual classes pain luckily professors lenient.

I started seriously applying jobs April graduation got rejection rejection. embarrassing living home plan future summer long. eventually got great offer job I‚Äôm August 2020.

I remember told one rejections another applicant years experience tech stack got job (even though team loved me). think lot people got laid initial outbreak taking job could get (including entry-level).

It sucked made through. Remember told us need masks save Healthcare workers, forced us wear 2 weeks later? act amazed people blindly believe follow next instructions. Yup, understand many people boosters (take look downvote got reason). Getting two boosters year half hour commitment, that's basically nothing. It‚Äôs less problem messaging fragmentation authority. We‚Äôre deliberately set run state governments. federal government course lot power, particularly locations owned agencies business them. 

Additionally there‚Äôs various health agencies state level, federal level, international level, well discipline specific health groups.

All means there‚Äôs going dozens different messages group independent stuff subjective. mask mandate positivity rate 1% 5% 10%? lot depends subjective measures. way get great messaging would forbid anyone (eg) CDC communicating guidance, that‚Äôd run hard via 1st amendment. That's nice read conversation, never said Probably change ur flair Good. need lot healthcare reform globally. Access affordable healthcare basic human right. Open source vaccines medicines would go long way towards helping make reality well setting maximum allowable rates medical procedures, drugs, etc.   Please vaccinate fellow humans. surviving pandemic one way another. Anyone waiting Novavax approved US use booster?  graph display properly page also bottom page displays properly  Ohhhh makes sense. Sorry misunderstanding!  Wow, downvoted potential HCA winners. Epic! Precisely. now.  That‚Äôs really interesting. so? Fuck feelings. Except we‚Äôre *not* going stop wearing masks, I‚Äôve gone public places require wear mask *and* fully vaccinated. It‚Äôs going end.  got third Pfizer shot literally nothing. later got flu shot worse (just arm soreness). Michigan pretty average vaccination%, Oakland county high vaccination rate another upward spike. Additionally 20 30% hospitalizations deaths ""fully vaccinated"" well. think simple ""people following rules""  Anybody test positive 14 days post booster? fair? friend got kiddos. She‚Äôs fully vaxed, booster still really miserable. got Covid couple months ago would still need get booster?  mean far less likelihood serious fatal illness yet USA countries (like Austria) starting require it. would guess countries requiring checking booster shots sometime next year.  would posit already *is* endemic, we‚Äôre honest ourselves.   deer likely?    Oh yeah man, really good. got incredibly lucky timing wise. take 9+ months find job CS degree though wasn‚Äôt lucky lol got booster last weekend. first one barely felt. even got seasonal flu shot day. Got bit headache one point next day that's it. like first two shots (Pfizer) definitely hit lot harder point felt like flu symptoms couple days.

It‚Äôs bizarre. notice grocery store well. normally shop it‚Äôs almost masks went hour two later couple weeks ago half best. times middle work day.   anti-vaxxers would probably hire sailor discharged refusing vaccine.  also strong reaction second dose put booster several weeks want go again. finally got booster, side effects all. Hoping :) graduated May 2020 well. actually spring break everything shutdown (my friends got news classes would virtual beach).

I never commencement. friends school never got say bye to. came back campus sometime summer move stuff that.

I thought got worst (especially applying jobs summer complete hell), think classes coming us claim that. came freshman pandemic environment, idk ever would made friends. Idk could gotten internships did. definitely would able study abroad like freshman year. Wtf 2 degrees. shit then, Angela?

We're treating Anti-Vaxxers respectable humans contrast give shit pandemic well being

That's get  Followed rules first two, said HIV third gave bad time. life death, time arbitrary rules guidelines age, etc.

Also, threw dose expiring got there. shame guilt end. new information changes guidance though?

I'm sure messaging problem, people think different message = previous message lie. got moderna boost 9 months JJ. thing felt sore shoulder. got flu shot time. good hood  feel like always wind late game. would liked seen much earlier, aggressive push get everyone board. Time change flair none, one, two, three, four? gave fianc√©e booster flu time, see be. simply needed take blank space and/or allow someone screw entry re-do another line. give much credit. guess means eligible fully vaxxed booster approved case.     point, that‚Äôs probably best hope for. New vaccinations basically stalled. get shit done hope COVID doesn‚Äôt evolves something worse time. showed max vax center told appt one two dose vaccines said it‚Äôs JJ. reluctantly Got anyway got moderna booster little bit ago much **NOT** aim this.

But fail effort achieve herd immunity yearly shots necessary. This. also immigrant communities cohesive support other, least information. immigrant groups part constant information where/how get vaccines.  That's false equivalence that's blanket boosters approved. goal herd immunity need virus spread, need force everyone get vaccinated. There's chance we'll force enough people around world get vaccinated, way left herd immunity people catch virus. 

You can't say want herd immunity want stop spread. contradictory.    Let unvaccinated be, they've made choice. Stop ruining entire life stupid asses. 

Start kicking unvaccinated street crowd hospitals. I'm done shit walk-ins people opinion reduce barriers getting people vaccinated. current pharmacy register online answer series questions order schedule vaccine go get vaccinated literally answer exact questions paper get vaccinated. One fully republican legislature allow covid protections, republican controlled upper house allow covid protections.  blood clot risk minuscule it‚Äôs less common drugs Zero key broken.  relates Northern Ireland. 

In Ireland Covid passports north, nothing required move place whole island one vis-a-vis requirement covid cert going out. deaf people reading lips.

Not everyone dislikes masks irredeemable abomination. Anecdotal, relative that's top college teaching ""communications"" - would think might idea communicate family members, they're shitty assholes practice complete opposite communication. I've honestly never met anyone inept human relations communications. incidental exposure **in** vaccinated individuals

Vaccinated people exposed covid, meant need get booster now? Except vaccinated people still forced wear masks, that's ending Oh man, youve seen lot doubt. Heard good number nurses quit changed careers due treated/paid. think? 

As med student myself, wish strength resilience keep making positive difference world. Nurses make happen crazy hospital atmosphere never get enough credit. Also, username checks  No, unsophisticated selfish!   9 week old home RSV cases flaring entire family gotten - including baby. lab tested, pediatrician pretty sure it‚Äôs RSV fortunately he‚Äôs well inhaler saline solution far.

At least get big sister vaccinated COVID soon that‚Äôs one less thing worry Winter.  Wait finds wearing seatbelt doesn‚Äôt prevent getting accident maybe even dying.

If something isn‚Äôt 100% effective it‚Äôs worth /s say ""up-to-date vaccinations"" like used rather ""fully vaccinated"" ? Oh yeah totally agree. 

I guess I‚Äôm little exhausted cause like others saying, huge portions country done trying, kind negates efforts. 

Just feels like working ass trying bail sinking boat Dixie cup. Initial pair vaccines wiped right out. Chills, headache, fever, nausea. I'd rather COVID! I'll getting booster soon I'm eligible. Surgeon General United States America announced public statement wearing masks INCREASED risk COVID-19 transmission knew deep shit. impossible path unless entire world went lockdown month March 2020 one left homes reason. can't control airborne virus spread easily covid. Also even eliminated covid completely n US meaningless spreading around world. Except many conditions react badly vaccines minimized bare necessity. highly recommend Moderna booster

6-month protection original Moderna shots significantly higher Pfizer's; assuming that's true booster well (since booster simply half-dose original) Again, data disagrees doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs bad faith misinformation. seem taking personally might wrong one.   Wife got hour ago. Big line-up Solano Cty fairgrounds CA. Ah sorry meant groups know everyone vaccinated like possibly work school. graph shows infection, hospitalization. SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cells live bone marrow protect latter ramping antibody protection as-needed basis. main benefit boosters right raise short-term levels circulating antibodies. Moderna 2nd shot kicked ass. hope it'll booster... brother. Co-flu shot. Damn, I‚Äôm sorry. hope feeling OK someone checking you. course anything would potentially approved would USP grade. Yes, specifically addressing body‚Äôs immune response. problem *auto-immune‚Äù conditions.

The MS society recommending get vaccine relapse. supposed limiting eligible boosters?? Freakin ridiculous. Oh hope never sick life 2nd pfizer. contained anything else like flu shot sweet holy jesus recall anyone saying vaccine gave life long immunity. Exactly. need lot bloodless revolutions friends left NYC theater jobs shut down. eager return, old jobs back yet. Yes, check prior vaccination - assuming gave name/date birth received first shot(s). providers aren‚Äôt supposed require ID, many ask anyway. suppose could say ‚Äúsorry, don‚Äôt ID‚Äù. 

My experience said: signed online, indicated eligible, walked questions asked ‚Äúdo allergies know about‚Äù. Insurance also required, since I‚Äôm pharmacy (chemist, apotheke) database anyway, bill insurance. problems.  country in? sounds miserable.  Actually no! fever chills like first shot (JJ). sore arm times like someone punch real hard days.  difference people get fired jobs behind tetanus shots. true. trying find reason antivaxxers way are, elevate implying something justifiable anti-social behavior. 

We may also try understand mass murderer become mass murderer academic reasons, change fact society needs confine criminals prevent harming society.

The pandemic likely kill 20 millions cause long-term health effects 100 millions addition causing greatest economic crisis modern times. 

The pandemic deniers, anti-mask anti-lockdown crowd antivaxxers make impossible society deal pandemic. Society tolerate handful antisocial lunatics; however, contagious virus like that, need vaccine-induced immunity 90% population. Without that, pandemic go new variants appearing time. different exactly?  governor sign emergency legislature ban OSHA's vaccine &amp; testing mandates, somehow create regulatory body replace OSHA entirely state level. (And yet, guarantee Republicans absolutely screaming amount startup funds, amount we'll lose federal funding...they prison system 15 years ago &amp; still bitching funding it, passing federal funding keeping minimum time served @ 85%, instead feds 65%) deal actual data nobody willing fund compiling anecdotes data 

\*points head meme\* I've fully vaccinated since 5 months. ...you'd rather die get shot every six months every year (much like flu)? know are, live Tennessee basically back business usual want be. ""this"" ""live like this"" referring to? There's way keep moving goal posts vaccinated means time enforcing mandates meeting shifting standards. sorry $0.02  Good luck that! many places world (not US) get third dose fit one select groups quickly releasing groups. Probably every 6 months.  Lol dramatic much. mean communication skills within industry require excellent writer, public speaker, ability relay messages internally externally, also highly intuitive order craft message right way. You‚Äôre either really good things you‚Äôre not, difficult teach skills. bi-annual shortly after... protection wanes significantly 6 months  Whilst good vulnerable protection illness clear getting vaccinated going stop virus.  ? Natural immunity pretty much always better vaccine immunity. 

You exposed entire virus. Remember told us need masks save Healthcare workers

I remember that, directive time CDC masks work.

It weeks later changed stance ""everyone needs wear mask now; said work needed save healthcare workers""   I'm J&amp;J vaccine recipient, believe choice booster want. I'm obviously going choose Pfizer Moderna - evidence choose one other, consensus truly matter? rougher recovery period pfizer?  know risks vaccinations, right? Especially populations.  

It possible getting results need. know vaccine something friend visiting town stayed home 5 days tested positive Covid, husband tested negative several times several days after. Moderna job! Getting booster next week. worse making up... Fauci caught least two lies trying influence behavior, thought truth result wanted got double Pfizer 7 months ago moderns option booster? like moderns booster lower dose rough reactions shots. Though idk much Pfizer booster also lower dose 2nd shot.   Terrible take lol isn‚Äôt surprising. antivaxxers successfully given virus ample time mutate become stronger. stupidity. refusing vaccine wearing masks. 

We‚Äôve known months now. dont consider mean covid vaccines ‚Äúexperimental‚Äù doubt theres objective definition term either way  Yeah, Biden buckled would absolutely crucified he‚Äôd gone wishes FDA/CDC. would put Dr. Fauci witness protection program. mean people cray-zee. wish he‚Äôd done anyway - winning one. US, people work government got rejected every private company

so worst performers trying job noone else wants can't get fired

it's wonder everything government touches (in US, least) complete fuck   learned people either knack communicating don‚Äôt

I idea talking about. still much case, something want either risk, lose profit on. Re-infection getting covid, either vaccinated not, essentially non-existent even get one, chance get ICU 0.X% even 80+ years old generation.  see article 3 shots kids 12-18 also adults? come back 2 days later req. 6 mos passed. guess ""reds"" want shop. Thanks informative answer. certainly, yearly shot flu get people bent shape. still seems wonderful vaccine fear uncertainty it, entirely sure would.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* It‚Äôs reducing transmission somewhat. Less time spent there, less transmission. It‚Äôs perfect isn‚Äôt going solve everything, really bad position try much possible. Deer already kill humans animal North America. makes think they're purpose. fuck ""experts"" listening to? expectation always we'd need boosters. That's four rows vaccine card (in US anyway).

How worse annual flu shot?  I'm definitely still going wear winter though. Shit surprisingly effective keeping face freezing off. bad me. still worth taking since one day misery though. miss wolf hunts restarting lower 48? 200 wolves killed Wisconsin past year. undid lot restoration wolf population environmental protections revoked government 2019. wolves returning Minnesota, Missouri, even Maine.

There's also small wolf population Carolinas- red wolf. US wolves realize.

And see Indiana chunks Illinois land largely preferred environment anyway. feel pain, truly (and dance too, dunno bc studios &amp; ballrooms closed). extreme pain process causes inflammation nerves, Bad neuropathy words (this also running water helped, cold intensified it). Something unfortunately deal everyday, instantly familiar me, definitely fun. intense, unyielding....

I'm honestly thinking/hoping third round bad, we've already exposed enough trigger. I've seen parents get boosters, seems support theory (mom reactions, dad got normal respiratory infection symptoms &amp; triggered second shot, like &amp; mother) ICU admissions, 52% anti-vaxxers, 4% partially vaccinated, 44% fully vaccinated practically comorbidities. 93% adults fully vaccinated, increased among age groups certainly tonnes breakthrough infections happening.

Boosters rolled 50s, panacea. It‚Äôll depend data pandemic progresses.  highly doubt combine two vaccines, probably choose get time not. Kinda like give toddlers multiple shots one visit. no, every drug phase 4 trials comes market. contents many vaccines come market aren‚Äôt changing recommended timeline dosing might. many countries ran ‚Äúexperiments‚Äù initial roll-out; canada, isreal, us many others varying gaps first second doses, may impacted efficacy longevity protection. im sure scientists busy analyzing relationship SARS FAR deadlier SARS-CoV2. What? SARS CFR well 10%. 

Like‚Ä¶ half said untrue. SARS didn‚Äôt disappear herd immunity. SARS contained efforts many countries globally gigantic lucky break wasn‚Äôt spread readily asymptomatic. Well I'm upset now, insulted me. I'm gonna go cry cough baby. wish they'd ""approve"" boosters everyone, like know they're talking right now. Loads people gotten lying. got one employer's offering everyone, questions asked. Meanwhile, people like, ""durr, let everyone get one what?"" People want badly enough already getting them.

So going ""well, OK, guess want get one without good medical cause, that'd OK..."" like ""you one can't fly"" months later.  sound right. US increasing deaths too. USA like hold beer lol.    taking anywhere 10 minutes couple hours (depending travel mostly) every 6 months big strain life?

Planning get third one anyway (relatively) little whining but...yeah, really is. Moderna side effects made sick, like, SICK sick. thought first shot bad mostly 48 hours. second one dragged 4+ days worst part plus couple days felt right again. 

Anecdotally looks like third shot could go either way, love idea take week unpaid vacation violently ill every half year. But, know, I'll to.   lol, bro ask doctor consult CDC reddit. disinformation issues. Nope. anti vaxxer now? believe Fauci actually said reason wear mask, similar same.

At time apparent prevalent non-symptomatic carriers were. changed stance pretty quickly became know.

So far find (I could wrong), public messaging always masks prevent wearer catching corona-virus (or much anything else), reduce chances someone infected transmit someone else. Honestly, way think effectively prove results home test would take video collection, processing, results, kind calendar/clock neutral website showing background. would easy lie taking test/your results, take test incorrectly invalid results, etc.

I feel like must‚Äôve caught rock hard place regarding home tests- say aren‚Äôt accepted, call question validity therefore value tests, increases burden testing sites. Hopefully reusable personal testing devices become mainstream soon (or everyone gets vaccinated), since least provide digital record test results. believe so, yes. I'm happy happening. CDC recommends everyone J&amp;J **2** months ago get booster. I‚Äôd go mRNA. Inconveniences? mean rare side effects including, limited to: Bell‚Äôs palsy, enlarged heart, blood clots, stroke, death?

The vaccines don‚Äôt keep getting it, spreading it, going hospital, dying virus (though greatly reduces chance hospitalization). too, better alternative.    Constant = one appointment/pharmacy visit every 6 months Fucking DEER carriers now. Covid stilling around forever, like flu    Imagine caught spiteful ham handed attempt protect front line workers say fuck health despite fact allegedly pissed government endangered health said ham handed attempt.

I get mad initial mesaging, human psychology completely manipulated self destructive cycle sad. Look, I'm sorry felt like taunting you, that's point.

But seriously fundamental misunderstandings Japan. 

Firstly: SARS never hit Japan. entirely spared SARS 2003. know, living time. SARS. cause think policy stuff through, Japan never got hit SARS like HK Singapore Taiwan. Zero cases. 

Secondly: Japanese blind rule followers. fact even LDP (and various ministries there) entirely sure Japan largely spared. actual health officials. Arguing inherent cultural trait misses LOT, anyone who's lived knows, always super pro-elder, either. Lots old people Japan die alone lonely. 

Finally: I'm stressing know. that's okay. instance tell lockdowns. masking per se. know. know testing Japan much lower per capita countries, Japan largely forbidden travel without quarantines. masks elder respect? Super doubtful know things work there. 

If want get huffy go neener neener feel free. swear I'm earnest here.    asking consider us J&amp;J receivers human lifeforms. Interesting logic. getting shot every 6-12 months makes fear levels go tiny price pay peace mind. found people south asian ancestry 4 times likely genetic trait makes people vulnerable never fully vaccinated since get annual shot lol  Sigh‚Ä¶ keep proving ‚Äòconspiracy theorists‚Äô right? Fingers crossed That‚Äôs interesting. saying got covid got vaccinated afterwards breakthrough case two doses? curious wonder already immune cells fight mRNA spike proteins synthesized vaccine immune system went crazy vaccine, almost like cytokine storm scenario?   yea next thing annual shot, i‚Äôve enough lmao don‚Äôt need many shots getting little stupid lol

and downvote type person jump bridge friend told told LMAO Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccines used US. (Making assumption you‚Äôre US) THATS WROTE INITIALLY.

Don‚Äôt freak didn‚Äôt read properly data landing 3 5yo?  shocked Pfizer beat states following Commander Chief keeping guard deployment ready. Happily vaxxed aggressively unmasked. going inconvenience protect people refuse get jabbed. That's risk they've voluntarily assumed. work place people, qualify. you/did smoke? bit chubby? Asthma? mental health issues, past present? Work public-facing job? one + six months since dose two you‚Äôre good go.  RELAPSE.
That mean ""at all"". fact, recommend boosters, also suggest extra doses. dishonorable discharges. general discharge.  absolutely hate CVS person, wrote 3rd shot info back card, ""return 2nd dose on"" reminder meant go. Yes, working. Give time, cases go again. happened Florida Texas happen Michigan well.  Blame refuse vaccinate absolutely reason ""muh rights."" say smoke eligible. ‚Äúeligibility‚Äù thing theater anyway.   can't get now? Moderna booster available already. live California, boosters available adult post 6 months last dose per Governor last week.. states easy saying condition qualifies, pretty much anyone would based criteria. YUP. They‚Äôre blind leading blind. honestly don‚Äôt trust anything say anymore That‚Äôs mighty fine intentional misreading. 

Care show article says people getting J&amp;J never need receive future boosters take actions fight pandemic? 

The J&amp;J initial dose ‚Äúone-and-done‚Äù read context two prior vaccines two-shot regimens order see good immune response. Nothing says anything would happen 6 months 12 months later.

You sound like kind person goes ‚Äúone stop shop‚Äù demands speak manager either don‚Äôt everything you‚Äôre looking need go back next year.   Use lol. lied medical professionals better access. claiming life 100% normal

You multiple times. 6 vaccinated staff got Covid one guy hospital since last Thursday. vaccinated FIL caught spent 2 weeks hospital august I‚Äôm currently masters public health üòÇ case study. reenact come response Sorry parents afraid vaccine despite fact probably demographic needs it. mean alone holidays...? worried making sick vice versa?  some. proved point simply argumentative attempting taunt me. 

Point proven, taunt failed, leave alone.   Three Covid doses 56 year old definitely outside 6 months (or 2 received J&amp;J). ones, US, myriad reasons could eligible get booster (Work public? Overweight? depressed? Smoked? Around vulnerable people? Around lot people?). Also you‚Äôre California (and maybe NY CO?) everyone eligible (after 2 6 months).   Hindsight great thing. would precise messaging masks back February 2020? got third dose Moderna Sunday gave level miserable side effects second dose. whole day bed aching body, low grade fever, complete exhaustion. worth though. FDA CDC two months ago said sure need this, maybe high risk, going ""Oh no, everyone get boosters!"" Again, they're step behind. allow people get boosters every 6 months. want debate early spring. Nah, they‚Äôre full blown narc wanting understand helping fellow neighbor.

nO OnE NEEdS BoOsTER. Brilliant argument keep getting boosters?

We get yearly flu vaccine. yearly COVID vaccine non-issue. big hesitation fact vaccine shot RUINED 1.5 days. Fever, shivering chills felt like shit causing miss 1.5 days work. Flu shot never adverse side effects. 

If simple getting jab returning normal life, sure problem. I'm going feel like shit entire weekend miss work consistently ""fully vaccinated"".

Also covid March 2020, confirmed testing positive antibodies. honestly say reaction covid significantly mild reaction vaccine. individual perspective I'd rather covid another shot, makes tricky risk getting transferring high risk individual unintentionally. 

That said, I'm scheduled booster shot Saturday last vaccine dose March 2021. react way booster last shot, sorry I'm signing again. 5. COVID-19 vaccine I'm MS relapse take medical advisers recommend vaccination   Apparently none coworkers eligible even though got second doses back May. Well, bless them.
They'll get buyer's remorse soon hero agree something alternatives terribly appealing.

I guess bucolic towns nice isolated, NYC among sensible places comes vaccination hygiene. Hi guys, 66% vaccinated. public school average still passing.   Yea one year.  agree 100. second go there, claim Bill Rights....really sucks right now. conspiracy nuts right? Shit‚Ä¶. hate that. Lying masks terrible start US pandemic response. course someone China didn‚Äôt lie wet markets wouldn‚Äôt happened.  know reason, racist redditors would triggered utter Fair enough. üéÉ It‚Äôs actually significantly better person, least local stores. ended go last online order weren‚Äôt enough items available order get week. went inside mindset picking edible-in-desperation items. 17 items marked stock, 2 (or similar substitutions) shelves store. 

For previous 2 months, pickup orders averaging consistently 50-60% items marked stock. I‚Äôve back going store almost month now, get around 90% items go store. suspect stores limit amount inventory pulled online orders (i.e. inventory certain threshold ordering system flags stock order goes through) effort shelves even sparse are. could they‚Äôre pulling online orders days advance missing restock happens pickup. 

I‚Äôm certainly *thrilled* going inside, don‚Äôt options either significantly over-order items don‚Äôt even really want get enough usable groceries cook with.  Complacency entitlement.

In part world, long time since epidemic ravaged country, people forgotten illnesses deadly, even can't see community. well long, hold onto outrageous believes without consequences (just look ""I gluten allergy"" people!)...and let be. think healthy. someone else's problem. build decision solely stuff read.. matter source is.

There also notion people overestimating education. good education here. Better parts world. people forget 99% learned school ignore rest. wonder can't handle statistics. evaluate medical issues. ever learned that, long forgotten. Dunning-Kruger hits. 1) read data sent. Police power verbiage used court systems comes federal states constitutional rights. Seriously good read. 

2) federal mandate legal. completely false. blocked courts find legal. momentous case something brand new. ""Hunny, grab nickels cup holder pass please""

\-Jeff Bezos  Michigan health officiala reconciling time high hospitalizations landmark 70% jabbed? AZ overall case fatality rate still 10.47% 65+ demographic (it close 13% time last year). 55-64'ers 2.46% today. 3-year-old triplets. turned 2 years old right pandemic hit USA. going nearly half lives. anti-vax nut jobs turn another conspiracy? safe get booster shot vaccines like Moderna? first two doses Pfizer. know. 6k+ now... Lol know went back read right. says outbreak began end September, would cancelled Nov 2 date. Boosters also approved end September, really may late them. sad days away clear again. ADULTS!!!

Per article:

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Food Drug Administration aiming authorize booster doses Pfizer-BioNTech‚Äôs coronavirus vaccine adults early Thursday, move would expand number Americans eligible additional shots tens millions, according people familiar agency‚Äôs plans. 
 
The Centers Disease Control Prevention‚Äôs independent committee vaccine experts scheduled meeting Friday discuss data booster dose‚Äôs efficacy safety. F.D.A. C.D.C. sign week, acted strikingly quickly ‚Äî little week Pfizer asked authorization boosters everyone 18 older.  That‚Äôs said ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù. course theoretically could vaccinate last 30%, many really get without forced shots? long take? yes supply problem UK Get shot official. release approval, going huge rush people get shots. There's issue ""skipping line"" even technically eligible, coming nobody cares eligible.  Pfizer one works different way MERCK one. 'supress' replication (AFAK). may also result: Pfizer Merck may combined.  Anyone eligible second dose six months ago, apparently earlier got mine GP five months friend health conditions GP. 30s hard rate 0.3%, america 5% comparison anyone seen data using J&amp;J booster 2x mRNA vaccine? ended doing. I've seen information getting mRNA J&amp;J, way around. Wondering they're finding terms boost protection. participated antibody study University Texas pretty low prior booster. skip day third dose due fatigue, next day still feeling off. first Pfizer, first two AZ Apparently understand works. They've gone far, least wait till kids chance full vaccination. im happy help (: guess (as article mention) J&amp;J shot, far know, Iran thats western made Iran approved vaccine. Really insightful, thx sharing. third dose third day, work day yesterday due fatigue. Clearly experiences vary totally keen every six months always seems like ‚Äò3 steps forward - 2 steps back‚Äô corporations. that‚Äôs good day. larger question that's really important whether pill, finally approved daily use (not emergency use) maybe six months now, available public over-the-counter therapeutic ZPac require prescription? 

This pill, order effective, must taken within 2-3 days knowing COVID recognizing onset. would require recognize symptoms, get tested within 48 hours testing, able get pill system immediately. 

If wait week, late. prescription required, pill certainly reach need on-time. doctors write prescriptions immediately upon request even diagnosis, even could days getting prescription actually get medicine local pharmacy, shortages aside. unless pill going over-the-counter, doubt noticeable impact emotional encouragement means improved therapeutic there, wide use yet. 

I'm guessing another several months approved wide-use, another months it'll available prescription, another months it'll available over-the-counter. Hope I'm wrong.

As we've seen, CDC FDA garble messaging take months reach decisions, I'm cautiously optimistic this. looking least three dose vaccine. mean perpetual. Pertussis four doses initially. collaborate teams (or during) pandemic I'm sure think change eventually go back.

They don't, simple. great excuse force people back office. call collaboration today, pandemic chit chatting something reprimanded. It‚Äôs rushed. People opportunity get vaccinated months. they‚Äôre getting they‚Äôll never get it.

We need starting moving country means bodies anti-vaxxers start piling I‚Äôm OKAY sacrifice. Less idiocracy gene pool. France 74.8% right behind.

Also, Japan older population, better eligible / total pop ratio, helps pump numbers. congrats course reaching number!  Also man helped lot  Weird flex  I‚Äôm multi-micronaire! Yeah actually stop go back old medication settle me, awful. Hope wife better now. Sorry you, grown adult, feel need insult college student who‚Äôs struggling loneliness caused pandemic, said didn‚Äôt like wearing masks. feels like seeing edge protection initial dose(s) 1st q year. semi scary possibly got 1/2 recommended dosage Sorry, making Pok√©mon joke   tell me, objectively ""anti-maskers"" prolong pandemic?

By spreading COVID, keeping infection rates high, keeping virus circulating mutating. 

How think increase spread virus, pandemic end sooner? 

No. Immunity wanes 10-18 months typically. Repeat infection absolutely thing COVID. ""natural"" immunity vastly less consistent robust vaccinated immunity. 

Plus get lot people seriously ill killed way.  country 86% total population vaccinated 

Mazel tov! I'll bet half deaths / capita US.  Congratulations government focused saving lives.  I've lost friends family COVID I'd give anything back - ask small wearing mask while... gods would something. envy good fortune. Yeah, feels like Indiana well. got booster still mask I'm gonna indoors around bunch people know, I'd say less 1/4th people, including employees, still wearing masks.

It's easy thing understand people it. sympathy work day long already vaccinated fully, damn, hard slap one quick jaunt hardware store whatever.    worse august now. 4th shots immunocompromised authorized August now. However 6 months 3rd, booster dose Moderna recipients. Same. went wedding Long Beach weekend. Masks came evening went on, reception mostly outside, alcohol flowed. time, realized proof this, believe people vaccinated least - promise they‚Äôd risk newlyweds family, based community‚Äôs state‚Äôs numbers alone. That's year's salary maybe 3 software engineers.    Idk parents make get not. Considering high school punishes us absent, can't afford risk getting one 2+ days like 2nd shot. still mask mandate atleast theres that. Finally!! approve 12 too!  Moderna booster wrecked unlike first two doses. like flu 3 days. I'm saying I'd rather covid really situation clear schedule days. involved process vaccine booster I've ever had. want long time.   anything weird comment chain taught language use speaking often inadequate conveying nuances situation.

For example people lost shit saying vaccines prevent spread covid. However, would feel comfortable people told getting vaccine prevent spreading covid?

Even said ""stop spread"", that's really correct. average slow spread. every instance stop covid spreading one person another, breakthrough cases thing people breakthrough cases fact contagious.

The argument making also super over-simplified. background infection rate population makes huge difference effective vaccinated versus wearing mask is.

The point saying vaccines ""stop spread"" narrative, factually true statement, saying ""stop spread"" overstatement. Overstatements dangerous cause us become ill-informed well giving anti-vaxxers ammo; ""If stops spread high case rates highly vaccinated areas?"" dumb shit.

IMO stupid argument having. places US, world whole, well enough considering pushing mask vaccines. Still places getting rid mask mandates ""easing"" actively experiencing surges (New York). Definitely valid worry. mine county clinic state data there, correct. even Bangladesh study posted shows pretty small reduction symptomatic infection, cloth masks nothing

That's study article concluded. idea pushing anti-mask narrative hard, bad faith. Must masked business lot work requires vaccinations dec well. 

Most people wear one outside well. unless I'm really alone outside. making profit

They're probably considering part advertisement budget, still huge positive. doesn‚Äôt matter text specifically mentions; major religions official dogma regarding vaccines. Judaism, example, human body considered gift god, getting vaccinated taking care gods gift snd mitzvah holy act.  live. mask mandate rolled back almost 2 weeks ago still seen bare face.  spending time telling think know. thing stating vaccine mandate unprecedented comes law. fact debatable. provided information backing point. 

All try see federal government done before. another write reason I'm condescending nothing telling I'm wrong reason. like young kid keep saying wrong wrong reason. 

You're literally playing game ""I know I"" 

So want condescending suggest conversation like adult.  heard pfizer's side effect less severe Moderna, first 2 shots moderna, get pfizer booster, also bad side effects? anyone else done shots like me? thanks high be. Whenever get new shipments, they‚Äôre getting arms fast can. Think we‚Äôre almost 80% eligible one dose, around 40% eligible fully vaccinated.

Just checked, it‚Äôs 85%/50.8% eligible. parts Austria vaccine politicized - exactly parts hammered virus days. many Eastern Europeans Austria trust government. sad. 14,000 new cases today, hospitals becoming overwhelmed. think 'Rural Folk' world over. quote Blazing got remember simple farmers. people land. common clay new West. know‚Ä¶ morons.

Most Rural USA habitable climatically lot them, whereas 'Great White North' rural folk much smaller voting block outvoted 90% Canadian population live cities along US/Canadian border.

In words, Canadian Rural folk conservative, stubborn religious Southern brethren, theres lot less terms overall population, nevermind relatively compared urban folk. sound goal posts moving again.  Use bandaid hold mask nose bridge prevent glasses fogging up!  Vaccination rates high there? higher vaccination rates, vaccines available 6 years old, it‚Äôs impossible reach numbers.

A better metric would burden hospital deaths lethality lowers better vaccination rates 20 30k. 

It reachable. countries much lower rates USA right google hard times imagine, 


easy, vaccine stop spread, theres numerous data look basically proves this.  seen timeline it. Source?   Hospitals rural NY aren‚Äôt great either‚Ä¶ idk believe hospitals fine, would surprised operating full capacity, business normal, situation still dire  You‚Äôre bot gonna able mandate way 100% worlwide vaccine uptake. Covid stay people learning live countries Europe 4 months Pfizer. stopped masking required see point anymore. Fauci says Covid endemic. everyone get it, unless vaccinated. every adult wants vaccine gotten it.

So I'm even protecting anti-vaxxers, many actions meaningless.

 see logic point, beyond people clinging false hope 80 million anti-vaxers change heart. Gotta agree... We're going need jabs+masks yet. got back Portugal. Mask compliance fucking amazing there. Everyone wearing mask stores, public transit, etc. Went OUTDOOR flea market absolutely everyone masked.  Correlation != causation.

Gilbraltar publishes vaccination status infected. past days (or weeks), 50% infections among unvaccinated residents, usually kids eligible receive vaccine: seen news Christmas celebrations. far understand official celebrations organized government. strong recommendation private celebrations far understand. ""wrecked day"" lol. alternative possibly debilitated months, years, even rest life, that's laughable. delight day-long mini-flu-s get flu shots gives tiny taste I'm avoiding. Man up. thought much lack sterile immunity respiratory viruses fact Flu mutates vaccine escaping variant every year simply many Cold causing Rino, Adeno, Corona Viruses etc mild disease bother creating vaccine them, keep catching different types every year end natural sterilising immunity eventually.

This case think. I've worked behind register serving hundreds people day every day 30 years. used catch 2-3 'Colds' year time. running joke family love Christmas dinner going unlucky SOB SOB's able taste lovely Xmas dinner year least one us invariably came dose right around Christmas day.

Anyway, single respiratory infection since 2012. one blocked runny nose, one headache, one sore throat. Nothing! Nada!  90% vaccinated early Dec. ones aren‚Äôt process firing.

Are referring entire country Federal employees? I'm immature self-centred.

I part - got vaxxed also wearing masks diligently.

Your comment wear masks indefinitely... answer hell no.

Move on. I'm also curious many would end long COVID and/or perminant damage lungs, blood vessels cardiovascular related body parts. paper isn‚Äôt studying immunity. AFAIK previous studies immunity infection vs immunity vaccines found immunity infection always ‚Äúbetter‚Äù. varies lot person person, depends severe case was. people develop broader immunity less targeted, others targeted. body generate plenty different kinds antibodies don‚Äôt neutralize virus, example. vaccines however, produce much consistent targeted immune response critical part virus. Antibodies vaccine neutralize virus (as prevents virus entering cells replicate). We‚Äôve gone new president, clue Fauci shouldn‚Äôt resign fired. needs seen order happen? Return back normalcy 10K, assumption certain % hospitalized assume. health care systems would overwhelmed. Bay Area restrictions like (or rather hermit)? I‚Äôm DC area wouldn‚Äôt know pandemic minor Covid rules sit outside doctors office call shit like that. Sorry, find one either. Ha, worried 2 cases blowing Australia. 3000 children infected Covid, many would expected die, statistically? herd immunity delta variant.

Portugal 89% population vaccinated shots still seeing surge cases. anywhere near bad US's, still. r/iamverybadass    help, blip compared Delta coming force.  one said ""universally"" mask. us commenting lived there.  Exactly, numbers contextualize current hospitalisations lot better quotas hospitals (e.g. 80% unvaccinated 20% vaccinated), latter heavy selection bias mentioning majority vaccinated falling ill. kids get fully vaccinated (2 3 years old), I'm partying like 1999. care more. Give booster move on!  important understand, pandemic hurts economy, lockdown measures reduce spread, according economic research institutes. shown time time According economic research institute Ifo, increasing number corona infections jeopardizing economic recovery Germany. ""The spread infections ensures economic activity sectors social consumption - gastronomy, travel, culture events - declines people avoid risk infection,"" said Ifo boss Clemens Fuest ""Passauer Neue Presse"". already fragile recovery Fuest said large extent lockdown measures caused economic costs, pandemic itself. [...] ""forcing"" ""adapt"" all. commenting immature self-centred people like are. isn‚Äôt spreading. ""slightly"" riiiiiiight usual, notable hospitalizations around 6:1 unvaccinated vaccinated patients despite vaccinated people outnumbering unvaccinated least 2:1. Cool hey we're getting ""under control"" Next year, get paid stay home to...I dunno, help prevent curve whatever fuck y'all going call it?  
Cause working shit going fucking exhausting frankly. Especially glasses. ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  oh comes control. lot people die yeah there's control. There's R cost, Pfizermectin fucking blows truth obvious say plainly start. Oh good retracted. harm foul guess. That's nobody believes retracted discredited claim MMR linked autism anymore thoroughly debunked. /s

The damage already done. even live *reality.* 

I'm political discourse disagreements. Different interpretations, different opinions, different approaches solving problems, yes, fine, great, bring it, let's argue out, that's Democracy about.

But large segment population even believe *facts* anymore? simply accept sort proof anything want believe in? hospital, dying COVID, last breath still insist hoax?

You never mourn bruh, others, care.....

Until affects directly zero empathy right? That's called narcissism it? go get Moderna? Okay thank much. would prefer yearly 6 months. Preferably combo flu/covid vaccine.   That's really awesome proud state. think right, going continue problem people actually they're supposed punished point. Unfortunately ICUs full everywhere live, that's going start impacting vaccinated people too. sensible thing think stage send outside field hospitals treated, expense everyone else. choice resources go think there's justifiable reason heart patient late 60s ever triaged favor willfully unvaccinated patient 30s 40s. 

I think sort visibility change minds too. Harder look away from. Uh state went full normal second fucking cdc said vaccinated didn‚Äôt mask.

We 50% best vaccinated.

They absolutely fucked bad. me, I'm really curious too. Happy early birthday. think really interesting said deleted reply. Bye! always like moving forward.

No won't. Literally health experts saying all. 

The hardest part pandemic finding pervasive innumeracy is, bad people understanding difference risk levels of, say, 10,000 cases day 100,000 cases day. Headache usually dehydration symptom. think really interesting need mask keep everyone safe, we're also supposed love it, never speak negatively it. no, real. despise masking, eagerly await day we're allowed stop wearing public. Everyone life max vaccinated. We're good. Yeah, prices many countries far beyond ""profitable"" though, think would sensible government ordering drugs bearing brunt price. way government would able negotiate pricing etc pharmaceutical companies would get guaranteed, potentially lower profit. pretty normal, especially vaccines remains seen occur particular drug. Person refusing vaccine facing consequences news. Begone, lady. hope baby don‚Äôt die COVID, apparently care do. Yeah, that's number.  June felt hopeful me.

Not Delta wave hit lot people still acted like *it didn't*. 

That really help extreme lol blame them? Malaysian food? Great read. Sad times. wish way shut down.  Getting mine Saturday. Im getting scared winter look like. think fine limited statute rule.   seriously, journalists covering covid? ever since start, overwhelming majority articles leave critical piece information put stuff context. people deep research forget that? literally every single article like fails mention vaccinated people ones filling ers? Even thread, people seem assume breakthrough cases causing spike. wtf?  Totally agree you! Idk people strongly natural selection‚Ä¶ point I‚Äôm totally fine letting nature it‚Äôs thing, survival fittest  Currently sitting daily 87k weekly moving average.  FYI dad ‚Äî 2 egg free flu vaccine options available year: Flucelvax Quadrivalent (cell-based) Flublok Quadrivalent (recombinant). Flublok preservative free well, Flucelvax pre-filled syringes (Flucelvax vaccines administered via multi-dose vials contain thimerosal). wish kinds fucking articles would mention unvaxxed people filling hospitals. headlines border reckless fearmongering mask usage low. Life seems normal outside news. started like 4 months later rest world government demanding pointless local trials refusing approve vaccines quickly, government finally got shit together shot fast. We're like 80% first dose, 75% doses, even include kids cause approved yet. restrictions anymore lowest daily cases 2021 yesterday Tokyo, 7 people 14 million. many hospitalized fully vaccinated half dose much time doses fairly unlikely get reaction second dose. Imagine thinking walking running exercise comparable all. 

If you‚Äôre fine unmasking public friends insistent dying hill? get kick bullying struggling college students? 

What sad, sad life must live find funny. depressing think craving social scenarios ‚Äúnarcissism.‚Äù us normal human beings. Social creatures. 

Step high horse gain empathy.  Nice sore arm? modern people half dose? Acting like jackass winning nobody side buddy. seeing friends faces public big deal me.

So Drama! crazy made baloney, oh drama fun.

You literally go visit friends time like. 

 one telling that. 

 one locked room. 

 could go bar right wanted to.  

You take breakfast tomorrow literally watch chew food mouth open that's really into.  

You go take walk get exercise "" feel like waterboarded sweat.""

To narcissist, guess ask regulation all, matter small, must feel like torture. sad. Me, neither. 

This worst two years life. includes entire year high school expunged transcript depression trauma response. Holy hell horrid, position relative privilege. 

Never. Again. get boosters every six months I'll set alarm make regular date doctor. excuse every situation - ‚Äògod works mysterious ways‚Äô, ‚Äòall part Plan‚Äô, ‚Äòit‚Äôs gods will‚Äô‚Äô. believers ready accept excuses‚Ä¶ Live without shit ton trauma  saying mask keep social distancing? doctors TV? know anywhere that's that. Maybe LA. Midwest see tons people everywhere. stores, restaurants. Sometimes see people wearing masks. time don't. really think lot people listen Fauci epidemiologist noise. I'm saying wrong, Im saying think people paying much attention used to. vaccines treatments becoming readily available Pfizer pill. Maybe need boosters every 6 months year. government paying it, fine. point, choose move forward. I've taken precaution. I've vaccinated boostered. wear mask go store..I'm part. 

Will long-term? know. know lockdown see much problem. kind normalized myself, guess. biggest problem amount death still. wish happening. people maybe need get vaccinated, guess. give people tools protect it, keeps spreading. control you. Try feel better, protect family live. Speaking anecdotally‚Ä¶ February 2020 got insanely sick. Sicker ever been‚Ä¶ ever. GF minor cold really bad. convinced gonna die. testing available even thought Covid area. spent past weeks following case info coming China job. 

I spent days sitting big chair watching zombie movies dry vaping CBD flower basically delirious. way found could breathe stay somewhat alert. 

I‚Äôll never know really Covid looking back things probably gone hospital convinced sitting CBD helped me‚Ä¶ knows. Anecdotal probably partially head. don‚Äôt want think much worse could been. Lolllll tiny talking here? need rude. 

Sorry can‚Äôt understand expecting lower transmission normal flu season ‚Äúdegree‚Äù normalcy absurd goal promotes hopelessness. 

Public health really needs take human psychology seriously start setting realistic goals.   goal always getting covid control: r0&lt;1 didn‚Äôt even want wear mask.. lawsuit go nowhere meaningless. Words meaning, tried change mean. I'm day three booster shot. achy first day bit feverish. Better second day headache persisted day (also eyes felt puffy, actual eyes themselves, around them). day three headache still persists, also eye puffy feeling still. I'm also feeling super lethargic. got wrecked second dose better day two. Almost feel like might actually Covid.  Oof, would love hear reasoning behind one, I've already met quota bullshit day. Best luck, kid. jump back fort see ow go away. Funny thought yard right next woods pace could feel completely relaxed last year, year I'm aware critters constantly visit it. full return majority week still office. 22 months seeing work listen feedback positives. I‚Äôm wary giving personal info highly vaccinated northeastern state. could shove field hospitals. would really nice too. I‚Äôm runner. Unfortunately it‚Äôs hitting time northeast running outside dangerous. Thus, move indoors treadmill. ever tried run 10k mask on? feel like waterboarded sweat. 

You‚Äôre one insisting they‚Äôre big deal. Never seeing friends faces public big deal me. College extremely isolating covid measures. Cases mostly unvaccinated 18s older people vaccinated long time ago. also little natural immunity, guess. 

Bit frustrating we've never really many restrictions life continues normal - masks contact tracing. Ugh I'm sorry, that's awful. Shame them, everyone else to. ‚ÄòMinor‚Äô fees. Also anyone can't afford (financially, health-wise, living elderly/young/immuno-compromised people, etc) get breakthrough case concerned passing virus even contract symptomatic case still limiting contact activities. LOT people stuck working home, horrible situation lot reasons. Childcare, schooling, finances, travel, public transit, parties, bars, restaurants, small businesses, mean... literally know anyone living life like February 2020. Granted I'm friends conspiracy nutjobs, yeah, everyone know taking seriously therefore even loosening restrictions lives bit, far fuckin cry back still. Cool. classes this. Absolutely, totally understand. I'm teacher, recent grad. get it. 

Just let make apathetic plight vulnerable frustrated. Hoping that's case mom. really sick second shot, ironically one family really worried getting vaccinated first place. uncomfy. make gym hell.

Drama major take it?  go walk run bike ride - mask required.  Problem solved - welcome.

Your whinging posts ""never seeing friends faces again"" ""sitting alone room."" one telling things.

It's dramatic, it! state though? Many southern states peaked late summer / early fall waves couple months ago, catastrophic hospitals. I‚Äôm talking mobile morgues nearly every county Kentucky. state 50% vaccination adults, much concentrated larger metro areas. counties hovering around 30%. Seeing hospital overflow continues problem places across globe holdouts, even places significantly higher rates that, don‚Äôt understand won‚Äôt back point come spring unless big changes. We're still fully masked Seattle well realize last holdouts. went Denver last weekend wearing mask everywhere. saw sign said masks required unvaccinated realized people probably thought unvaccinated wearing one. Wow $500,000? much profit make forcing people work? would dare say far that. new level stupid. antivaxxers reanalyzed study handpicking data women vaccinated within first 20 weeks pregnancy pregnancies end within following 12 weeks. Except human pregnancies last average 36 weeks. analysis compared women study miscarriages (which happen naturally) small group women premature births, concluded vaccine causes miscarriages. analysis include vast majority women, either gave birth study ended study normal 9 month gestation period. save lives. compromise get vaccines approved people's arms faster. get booster 6 months 2nd shot. mad people agencies. unvaccinated dragging us backwards agencies setting unrealistic expectations make things feel hopeless contradict human psychology. Gotta catch ‚Äòem all? Admitting masks suck doesn‚Äôt make someone ‚Äúspoiled child.‚Äù don‚Äôt grin shout praise mighty mask good human. 

It‚Äôs normal want masks go away. impede communication. They‚Äôre uncomfy. make gym hell. I've got two grandchildren saying thing. feel bad young people want get lives back track. know soon happen, will. thing really different people wear masks aware giving space one another can. Yep pet dogs cats getting means wolves, foxes, coyotes feral dogs cats getting too. It‚Äôs never going away. It‚Äôs impossible go away. know know college-age? called self-preservation individual species ""punishment"".

Trust me, know SUCKS, already horrendous situation pandemic hit wheels fully fallen life every way since, including losing loved ones virus. get it.

But we're way punished, we're asked responsible protecting everyone else. frustration directed everyone making take far longer needs to, various agencies trying keep us safe. Maybe anger used encourage people circles communities etc get damn vaccine already, follow common sense (mandates not, people wearing masks limiting contact &amp; activity), supporting activism efforts, etc. Maybe already whatever reason can't, able, would great.

Congrats able attend college; privilege lot us anymore even outside pandemic, obviously made much difficult most. hope get one piece, great life. dangerous unacceptable. know say farce, real religion loony ones given much rights - actually think deserve more. Like 70-80k day going also heading winter holidays. certainly increase holiday travel etc. forsee things going well Winter I'm saying average density tell much story vast swaths US empty ton cities much higher population density Israel.

I'm saying US much higher right now. We're talking feasibility getting 10k (and remaining there), post responded indicated reasonable expect get Israel low. pointed out, Israel still higher goal 10k per day adjusted population. Canada right spacing 2nd dose.  ‚Äú ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want sit back 70,000 85,000 new infections day say, ‚ÄòOh, well, can‚Äôt better that.

Only question efficacy wears longer wait take em. people show symptoms days already make less useful situations? I‚Äôm tired gaslit forever maskers like

Yeah...  

Strong spoiled child vibe.

It sound like really whole college thing. Maybe grow point. Good luck! I'll definitely wait review replication one. CBD tends Ivermectin left, touted cure-all everything despite never really holds study. well everyone quit masking vaccines rolled out.

Hey, Illinois (Chicago-ish) Midwest everyone masked everywhere still!   counter county thinks CDC gospel. definition substantial transmission completely touch reality ground consideration case rates, factoring vax rates.

In county 10 % adults vaxed account 50% cases. literally 10x infection rate. Yet county still thinks March 2020. originally got Johnson &amp; Johnson want know it‚Äôs safe get Pfizer booster. articles say it‚Äôs safe don‚Äôt ‚Äúknow enough yet‚Äù scares me. really wish went Pfizer Moderna start.  state's vaccination rate 75%, even close to. dumbass friends actually get vaccinated (most are, couple fucking stupid). go outside socialize handful vaccinated people, that's it. agree never fully going away. People right thing get vaccinated. know won't, are. Yes, actually care cases, care health care impacts.  don‚Äôt understand encouraging someone live flexible balanced life callous, ok. Well, there's certainly precedent Job. guess? I'd also consider criminal consequences. damage done, genie bottle. can't un-yell ""fire"" crowded theater. Anyone feel Public Health Official statements, like Fauci's ""Degree Normality"" statement seem hopelessly touch really hurts credibility. US seems completely back normal, except areas masks areas masks all. I'm Texas, people mask, people don't, nobody really cares either way.

I really sure Fauci talking to, about, concerns public health officials really idea going ground.  got dirty looks grocery week Trump gave news national emergency March 2020. week later, dirty looks shifted without masks gloves (we went ham first days) barely shifted back. believe people cough without mask possibly get dirtiest looks, especially without mask. It‚Äôs usually point reality sinks people physically avoid person aisle aisle entirely.

I feel mask usage common sense places like grocery store stay awhile places it‚Äôs gamble. listened panel lol. major discussion ethical concerns whether using booster shots countries didn‚Äôt even first shot, optics that. safety vaccine booster relatively accepted given, hence decision give risk populations. specifically cited compromise since weren‚Äôt using doses could used struggling countries.

Tell read reports didn‚Äôt listen vote without telling me? *never* stopped normalcy, though. human history, thousands died--many unnecessarily--every day.

People stop living normally affects them. Given existence highly effective vaccines--they still 95% effective preventing infection get booster--people reduce individual chance death small level.

It unexpected people regain ""semblance normalcy.""

Last year, family celebrated holidays Zoom. year, we're back person, maskless, indoors. 100% normal holiday? Everyone eligible vaccinated, none us indoor dining 2 weeks before, taking rapid antigen tests before. risk negligibly higher year. Weird. CVS went to, signed online &amp; asked checked name. didn‚Äôt even verify identity.   ""those people""? I'm saying:

Get vaccine survive

Avoid vaccine that's Seems like back normal America. Everything staying open, mandates, yet people still getting sick fuck even vaccine. know pandemic right?! governing bodies bunch wack ass people. Paid politicians don‚Äôt thing common human. Ignorance means following CDC/FDA guidance? I've disagreed CDC multiple occasions I've always followed resulting policies. work 100% vaccinated office 100% masking policy CDC. think silly follow anyway fear retribution higher. trust process decision makers even first place. didn‚Äôt say kids would getting shots December, data. data 5-11 came 9/20 Approval came 11/3. get data 2-4 year olds 12/20, following timeline you‚Äôd looking shots arms 2/4, first half next year, exactly said (Jan/Feb) say acceptable, said 0 deaths statistically expected outcome regardless interventions. Therefore can't claim specifically masking context saved student lives. Nothing more, nothing less.  feel like statements like really hurting Fauci's credibility. public health official aware status country, country seems basically back normal. profess PHO know going ground?  Well, grandstanding sure waste valuable time. may wrong think OP saying would ""one one-hundreth one student"", one every hundred students (based total number people age group USA died Covid). UK kid playground, infecting everyone else laugh them. votes booster initially based science

Tell watch read reports without telling didn't. soon masks decrease nothing feel we‚Äôll close old life, agree we‚Äôll never false sense security even we‚Äôll great tool fight Covid pill truly works most. kind always wondered China could always seen mask nearly decade possibly get sense why.

We‚Äôre deep wouldn‚Äôt surprised can‚Äôt shake masks. Perhaps it‚Äôs case witnessed shook core careless masks early on. Certain industries adjusting, too, like movies. studios probably still want people get box office, wouldn‚Äôt surprised prefer streaming new releases now. TV shows already seemed thriving streaming Covid perhaps movie studios trying match depending physical box office sales long. True, experience sucks least won‚Äôt get sick. wish hadn‚Äôt read idea ""dangerous"" healthiest 11% allowed less healthy 89% joke.

That's literally partially works. risk complications due covid vs risk complications due vaccine. delta's spread, instance, male 5-11 year old's approved risk myocarditis would outweigh risks complications catching covid.

Dismissing CDC/FDA suits demanding people listen suits exactly anti-vaxxers makes better.  K fuck Bro, Hungary passed 10000 new cases daily. 10 million people living here. know government did? Jackshit. wait completely escalate 20.000 infections day, like government Netherlands? Cost aside, see reactive treatment preferred preventative treatment healthcare providers, ultimately decide insurance willing cover guess. know dogma pope pretty vocal support vaccinations well. Trumponian Religion true. know gotten like...6-9 anthrax boosters....

I got Janssen, I'll probably go get booster anyhow It‚Äôs ok going treatments plus kids vaccinated. zero key broken? north jersey whole foods people masked, block starbucks people wait drinks mask

&amp;#x200B;

i found kids' schools kids take masks half hour time might be. Many childhood vaccines require 3 4 doses fully effective Eg pertussis religion talking? heard pope Francis fully supports vaccination went far calling getting vaccine ‚Äúan act love‚Äù. completely normal beagle safe understand infectious virus spreads people behave? Unvaccinated people reason here.

What‚Äôs going happen get kids vaccinated - happening now- unvaccinated become even bigger pariahs going let get sick possibly die. 

We going anti/virals monoclonal antibodies. death count hospitalization count decrease fast. 

It‚Äôs going much longer. months. This. able breathe sign relief June. immediate family fully vaxxed then. mid-July noticed cases rising. Late summer hard. barbarian typically class high health uses large weapons defeat foes. 6 months Moderna Pfizer. 2 months J&amp;J. Agree previous comment. get booster appointment kept going pharmacy counters ask accepted walk-ins.

Costco Target accepted walk-ins near me. warned would longer wait without preregistering kill plenty time shopping.    Seriously, gut reaction ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make much money five minutes? good fine like do?‚Äù Good  way look it, twice frequency usual flu vaccine.

More twice side effects, sadly. never reaction flu shots besides mild arm soreness, second COVID shot basically wrecked day. (Got #3 today seeming like it'll similar.)

I'd *do* necessary - still way way better getting COVID. (Or worse, spreading more-vulnerable loved one.) time flu would convenient, inconvenience going getting shot far least favorite part this. I'll sure tell virus tired it. I'm sure matter. many times goalposts moved ? listened panel debating it, almost none reasons votes booster initially based science. political/geopolitical/supply chain concerns. look way: Vaccines-fewer infections less serious. Vaccines plus masks-even better. Vaccines plus masks plus boosters-better still. cloth masking estimated efficacy around 10% vaccinated Pfizer showed 20% decrease covid transmission infection..

However main effect contagious people spreading disease fact vaccinated significantly reduces risk becoming contagious first place. room hundred people I'd rather room 100 vaccinated people 100 masked people unknown status.

Also need both, data clearly show covids r number drops 1 fully vaxxed populations   sound lot alike cases going S. Korea? vaccination rate, seems like lull cases like Japan.  u think contracts last? average faculty 55 know data even double vaccine protection people 50 still dying covid-19 Even use median year - 30,000,000 symptomatic flu infections estimate , that‚Äôs still 8x daily infections Fauci wants see seeing *degree* normality. take away anyone's right choose.

In spirit transparency, I'd interesting consider patients allowed know vaccination status attending physician. I'd physician is.  Bingo What's super fun work people think need shout heard microphone. day someone meeting room fucking loud almost went close door, saw *already fucking closed.* would want fourth already? Follow guidance. guy you‚Äôre responding never said people shouldn‚Äôt wear masks, say didn‚Äôt help flus colds. I‚Äôm sure read got from. 

He said, reasonably, masks mandated prevent cold flu. practiced LOT worn KF 94s day work long time. uncomfortable, think get pretty good fit. depends important person work guess. really scared bringing something home family, even tiny amount protection enough motivate me. terrified. Fellow vegan here, agree too. üíö Frankly that‚Äôs going happen US. vaccinated shouldn‚Äôt continue punished restricted year unvaccinated drag us down. work without fear laid (again) supply chain disruptions caused covid. 

Or taking general precautions catch I'm asthmatic. Ah gotcha. would nice they'd bother actually research shit claim fact. agree going happen US, I'd like point Israel Japan seem able achieve even this. want normalcy, enough people need vaccinated enough need masks. achieve that, cases would plummet... Sub10k daily cases would side effect. encourage anyone who's vaccinated wear those. They're uncomfortable.

Especially boosted there's need.  Coming back said ""People still hospitalized they‚Äôre ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù.

We argue cows come home. think mandating vaccines acceptable - not. Seems like picked normal year flu. Bad flu years like already stress hospital system definitely consider normal. Chicago. :( change? 

Delta may somewhat deadly, also boosters, needed want get sub 10k/daily cases, reduce death hospitalization. 10k/daily cases would means ignore covid. really like ideas wish done that, PSAs mask hygiene fit made frequent. training workplaces schools. Shout parents kids who'd hide doctor's desk avoid getting shot, like used do.

I get shots, hiding required!  Hooray! start prepping 4th shot FDA corrupt let us take Covaxin! Really? Walgreens asked nothing, sign form saying eligible show ID? Faeries worship Trump? First - baseline. covid long hauler survivor group people COVID two shots antibodies 6 months others lot.  seems vaccines work differently people.  Also, articles I‚Äôve read say people antibodies either shots previous infections react shots. Maybe previous vax shots worked well body reaction bit overload‚Ä¶. read happening long hauler site, longest read less week even strong reactions it. one state. Hospitals area fine. 

I‚Äôm also speaking future general. 10,000 unrealistic. would mean masks distancing many years. northern southern California... hospitals fine ...

They're not.  Like really really not.  think lot companies held properly responsible putting profits worker safety.  makes lot sense. Thanks that. Trending again? thought numbers going Delta gone states?

And remember last year India first reported 75k daily cases Sept 2020. Every one ""holy fuck"". US India reached like close 300k+ per day records. 87k seems low. south Florida? I'm Miami people still pretty consistent mask inside. rare see someone without mask inside here.  situation reading lot it. Seems like luck draw side effects either shot. long ago 2 shots were, immune system, etc seem play part individual experiences arent going help much. moderna dose 50% regular difference probably zero whereas modernas slightly worse shots also provided protection seeing real world studies.

Having said that, 2 doses moderna, getting pfizer. Mixing appears good. Pfizer seems slightly better young males due heart issue. gotten pfizer, would 100% seeking moderna now. understanding criteria one's personal religious beliefs. necessarily line teachings particular religion denomination. Feel like need right left hooks jabs point.   make decisions think best us. got J&amp;J March Moderna booster last week believe reduce chance serious illness death. Others think vaccine risky COVID trust pharma companies. Guess what? I'm sympathetic towards pharmas either got vaccine anyway. made choice others make theirs. get virus walking around totally oblivious fact symptoms, belief around unvaccinated higher risk. decision. think massive lockdowns unvaccinated like seeing Europe answer.

Concerts, sports, gatherings, bars, restaurants, full capacity. idea normality essentially vast majorities country feels disingenuous.

I suppose caveats probably 50% people around still wearing masks grocery stores, etc, I‚Äôm sure schools operating outside normality (with mask mandates, testing contact tracing). Perhaps finally drop stuff spring, don‚Äôt think caveats back fauci‚Äôs point well really.  You‚Äôre playing semantics game here. Vaccines prevent infected, prevent spreading it. lessens viral load get Covid makes infecting others less likely. know, mitigating. course breakthrough infections happen; happens every virus. 

Wearing masks forever isn‚Äôt realistic.

For adult doses:

Moderna full dose 100 
micrograms

Moderna booster 50 micrograms think really depends you‚Äôre you‚Äôre going. I‚Äôve read something like 89% previously vaccinated Americans already eligible. booster pretty no-nonsense. felt like fight get first two shots despite considerable risk factors. Well nee strains emerge vaccine rate low india stepped vaccination. new variation found france traced back africa way prevent rise new strains help poor countries vaccine rates taking drugs deworming thinking effective

[If Pfizer pill effective, ivermectin reason  fired getting vaccinated, fired refusing get tested wear mask. think kind case. We'll get there. Need get flu shot apparently need good number days last vaccine booster, ill check get booster friday long till get flu vaccine mean‚Ä¶ next year six weeks away. 

Austria Europe.

So, come please. Friday parents week brother doctor already got his. Earlier today, roommate telling masking needs required flights forever. 

I taken aback, mentioned end point, even thought joking, dead serious.

I seriously question people thinking. bit scary. Making *forever* policy changes sounds completely draconian. Colorado I-25 corridor, masking still pretty big things mostly normal since 70% vaccinated county  true ""virtually risk killing"" someone passing flu along. one ever thought flu frankly hysterical terms.

Still, tens thousands people died every year. caught someone. Quite possibly you.   point, antivaxxers dying preventable deaths nature's way healing itself.   Going MN Thanksgiving main reason got booster. US touched 10k day summer look things now.. agree completely. think engineer would able well live life right already.  warned people wanted stop spread early on. mammals susceptible coronaviruses. early response pandemic made unavoidable.

No use worrying now. Practice common sense chill around wild animals. can't cull deer without severe consequences ecosystems already can't manage populations that's unrealistic anyway. Maybe stop killing freaking wolves get natural population control back areas country least reduce density. Part reason deer population control killed apex predators off, hello, consequences actions, nice see again. Makes sense! Never really thought teachers perspective perspective keeping others safe. see annoying, hoping future people sick would wear ever go run errands, get groceries, etc‚Ä¶ point view understand annoying completely agree you. Thanks insight random bouts sneeze constantly several days stop. impervious allergy pills, I've found put mask on, drastically cuts amount sneezing. randomly wearing mask even completely alone.  Yeah, time passes, know. 100% impossible speculate. way know something lasts years wait... years.

We boosters sorts vaccines flu shot already annual thing far lower death rate far lower complication rate. people get flu shots, suddenly big deal covid? read somewhere, pandemic people start ignoring CDC again. obeying CDC, also limit two drinks day (or one female)? also eat steak well-done? Mask wearing sick common sense. Mask wearing general, highly vaccinated environments, makes much less sense.

At point, highly vaccinated areas, considering COVID spreads, wearing mask way controlling anxiety anything else. got shingles booster shot 5 days ago. best idea I'm good now. 

She warned arm sore, booster gave symptoms like 2nd vaccine lasted 24 hours. Night sweats stopped.

I'm happy grateful protected Covid. Next, flu pneumonia vaccine. Never people never utilize full toolkit keep virus circulating wildly throughout population. rather breed new variants get shot wear mask. It‚Äôs maddening. Pfizer also sold cost developing world. Don‚Äôt know exact cost, it‚Äôs fraction US Europe paid per dose. Wellz Winter approaching makes sense could happen.   field mice, cats, dogs ferrets?
And answer eat either, consider catching disease cannabalism. Delta highly infectious. Everyone exposed. Everyone get it, either asymptomatically mildly symptomatic, vaccinated. 

Masks slow transmission, Delta, going stop it. Zero COVID scenario. 2 days boost I‚Äôd call ‚Äúshadow flu‚Äù symptoms show barely surface‚Äînot enough stop normal everyday stuff, enough remind feels like really seriously ill. made think ‚Äúman, want full blown version.‚Äù guys careabout Astroworld more. 52-100% seems bit wide range. Michigan alone week 7000/day. virus isn‚Äôt still killing significant number people \*are \* vaccinated.

This medical disinformation mean air continuously filtered? would think, given COVID spreads air, ideally want maximize amount fresh air coming *minimize* cabin air recycled.  necessarily. vast majority moderately immunocompromised people protected boosting. confirmed antibody titter. may correct severely immunocompromised. bit late avoid ""off-label"", Canada already mixed matched like trying set new fashion trends, played around interval too. Luckily seem cause major issues. I'd gladly take cargo flight regular commercial flight desire avoid COVID (either exposing others exposed).

Headline makes sound like strapped pallet something. I've jumpseated many times cargo flights (former cargo pilot). row two standard passenger seats cockpit, long haulers full galley hot meals crew. Yeah totally get know many friends way that's optional Who's gonna tell him? mean, given choice trusting experts trusting general social public, think I'm comfortable following experts. 

Well, clarify, like make decisions. 

Not like public really wisest decision maker, though, considering terrorist attack killed thousand people decades ago changed fabric country day, virus still killing 1000 day seemingly rising ""over"".

That said, get saying. know I'm phenomenally low risk youngish, boostered guy, understand point people risk risk volition, still feel hugely comfortable fact people unwilling simplest things protect around them, like wear masks indoors possible get damn shot.

To fair, I'm worried next big virus COVID, right now, considering general response COVID. God couldn‚Äôt imagine brain dead trump loyalists. India using ivermectin cure covid stopped transmission? don‚Äôt see fucking stupid sounds? Transmission happening know even covid.

P.S. India trialed stopped using months ago didnt work.  CDC never said masks work. said ""wear one sick around someone who's sick."" learned asymptomatic transmission, updated everyone wear mask safe.

Nobody ever said vaccines make 100 percent immune forever. That's ridiculous. possible know protection levels would change time, given vaccine developed year.

And virus mutated 8x contagious vaccine released.  already alive buddy. always gonna pretty. Adapt needed. 2021 holiday season leggo. 

i thought 2020 holiday bad. Thank much sharing knowledge! say, sounds like personal air vent running pointed face reasonable precaution virus exposure, given *most* time air either taken outside aircraft, HEPA filtered. live couple minutes recirculated air happens immunity booster ~~wains~~ wanes?

Pasting comment another thread, I'm lazy paraphrase:  


Efficacy likely declined ""fast"" two (hopefully) one-time factors: big change viral fitness (delta) \*and\* sub-optimal initial vaccine interval. looking like 3/4 weeks enough time doses get optimal long-term immunity. We'll obviously wait see things pan out, getting 3rd dose 6 months fundamentally different getting second dose weeks initial one. Plenty vaccines multiple doses spread year two, set life. mention, incidental exposure vaccinated individuals likely act sort 'natural' booster. scenario see us needing boosters frequently zoonotic spillback event (from deer, likely) get another mutation scale delta, we'll wait see happens situation. alternative scenario SARS-CoV-2 go away anymore (which likely scenario), people repeatedly get boost immune system, initially mostly vaccines, also exposure virus. repeated exposure keeps waning immunity high enough level turn infection nothing cold (or even completely asymptomatic infection) SARS-CoV-2 joins ranks 4 endemic coronaviruses, cause colds every then. point need keep rolling booster shots, unlike flu, there's 1 strain SARS-CoV-2 mutates slowly influenzaviruses do. 40% Covid deaths vaccinated

Cite? find source public health data backs up. Every data source indicates 6x 11x increased risk death unvaccinated  meaning negative test results longer accepted valid certificate people visiting pubs, bars, restaurants mass events

As done whole Europe moment vaccines widely avaialable. BTW, last time high last thursday. see bigger number tomorrow. I'm gonna need source one, 40%! whole new thing that's killing many people one largest causes death.

Because take vaccine. people 9/11 part murders. vast majority dying could choose to. dont Yes, upwards again. PR rising Chicago again. million reasons masks big deal. make communication harder, especially traveling speaking foreign languages accents, destroy people‚Äôs skin, uncomfortable, makes hard recognize people, everyone knows working mask absolute worst, extremely limiting, reality use really security theater one wears correctly takes lowers constantly. Traveling long-haul constantly required masks miserable. Requiring masks extremely limits events experiences industries. It‚Äôs death thousand cuts. 

People choose wear want, requiring time needs end. vaccinated fine. uniquely American phenomenon all.  time doses 6 months initial studies, vaccine approvals would 5 months later least.

With Delta variant lucky choose shorter period study. Considering stressed resources vaccine picture want imagine would done without vaccine.  gives idea you‚Äôll able go maskless keep getting boosters? na√Øve you? 2 days probably.

If think data changed substantially bridge Brooklyn sell you. Deer become reservoir Covid, jumps back humans run risk another mutation‚Ä¶ almost like covid endemic we'll never 10,000. Seriously though, need move life. Yes people dying this, people die alot things. Life risk/reward IMO reward far outweighs risk. Millions people die obesity year, 100,000+ per year die lung cancer, 600,000+ heart attacks. People treating Covid like death sentence reality ~98% survival rate. High risk individuals (obese/immunocompromised/elderly) remain vigilant, however rest us move life.  That's VAST majority people dying unvaccinated. dying voluntarily. Bay Area. Indoor outdoor. Actually, many people. give anecdotes understand personal feelings. terms risk population level, vaccinated individuals, risk death serious COVID simply low major concern. 

Folks immunocomprimised vulnerable many diseases. say someone loved one situation Little snarky no?

that‚Äôs point - one knows. 
So maybe become next talking point.

It‚Äôs legitimate concern going forward isn‚Äôt it? asked. 
The point peoples patience wear thin that‚Äôs way going forward. 
Sure ppl get first booster, probably one every couple months. choose wear one, requiring everyone, everyday needs end. Ya, meant like unlikely see 20k anytime soon. Nah deer live places far humans another vector disease It‚Äôs best think Americans collective entity. majority Americans taken virus seriously took strict precautions slow spread virus. look regions, US Northeast Northwest managed COVID similarly EU maintain high vaccination rates whereas US South much Midwest use guise ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù let people whatever hell want either disbelief virus thinking it‚Äôll magically go away one day. Moreover distrust government far right ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù fanaticism led least educated risk lives hilariously awful misinformation goes unpoliced social media. It‚Äôs sad, it‚Äôs politicized, it‚Äôs embarrassing, cost far many lives.

I‚Äôm teacher wears one every day. Talking day sucks, especially either constantly repeat ask kids repeat themselves.

I‚Äôve asked before, - understanding masks work also mean LIKE wearing them? wanna wear every winter, go ahead. doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt able look forward wear mine.   Michigan we‚Äôre close hitting 10K/day mark. Stay Tuned makes curious... wonder he's tweeted lately. [Let's  Yeah, join military never anyone tell do. Sure./s data dispute FDA/CDCs*data based decision* stands. Spoiler: really anything unfortunately want know I'll able live life Thanks! think case counts really best tracking data point. think Fauci little behind here. highly vaccinated area, case counts meaningful 


So long thinking prevalent, allow unvaccinated hold vaccinated majority hostage. understand physician, Fauci may see unreasonable, objectively, is. Yes forced cover face, temp taken, tracked everywhere go *is* oppressive. It‚Äôs also insane vaccinated people. risk vaccinated people getting it, spreading it, getting seriously ill warrant response. doesn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm glad live US, really am. Social distancing gets push back constantly beginning. Look reactions taking Thanksgiving precautions. Disclosure: got booster soon could.

I'm generally favor boosters. However, family directly exposed COVID multiple times ""fully vaccinated"" Delta wave swept area. one point, said getting Delta top fully vaccinated (or vice versa) provided really strong immune boost. (Don't intentionally case bad breakthrough case). assume longer case?

Also, autoimmune disorder. flares vaccines. little concerned inflammation multiple vaccines. Even though risk analysis virus riskier vaccine, point start longer case? Again, I'm fully boostered up, questions. No, think best case would everyone exposed virus form another, virus vaccines, coupled virus continuing evolve illness causes becoming milder average- course possibility severe strains popping while, necessitating yearly vaccinations much like already flu.

I hope mask wearing, especially someone sick anything needs contact others, becomes commonplace since help reduce covid respiratory infections vulnerable populations.   Efficacy *likely* declined ""fast"" two (hopefully) one-time factors: big change viral fitness (delta) \*and\* sub-optimal initial vaccine interval. looking like 3/4 weeks enough time doses get optimal long-term immunity. We'll obviously wait see things pan out, getting 3rd dose 6 months fundamentally different getting second dose weeks initial one. Plenty vaccines multiple doses spread year two, set life. mention, incidental exposure vaccinated individuals likely act sort 'natural' booster. scenario see us needing boosters frequently zoonotic spillback event (from deer, likely) get another mutation scale delta, we'll wait see happens situation. Covid. that‚Äôs word haven‚Äôt heard years. went BevMo recently near me. live Inland Empire. sign said, ""Vaccine = Mask, Vaccine = Mask"". Many small business around still require people wear masks want service. rarely business went least half staff customers wearing masks*.

In rich area Claremont, city LA county IE, went salon. masks, majority white women stylists white women clients lol. brown girl stylist came realized black stylist POC among staff. wore mask either. one building wearing one. always thought communications PR lousy major coronavirus. joke messaging masks vaccines been. Every pandemic social end long scientific/epidemiological end. places US already there. waiting public health experts tell everything go back normal, going waiting many years, experts much lower risk tolerance public. distance changed. Look school policy.  seriously suggesting masks "" proven prevent spread disease"" - help, suggesting masks effective vaccines, vaccinated saves lives, prevent spread

prevent, no. far effective cloth masks slowing add enough unvaccinated still risk overflowing ICU capacity big surge.

I live DC area. simply case never been, even worst surges. reality prevent means stop entirely.

You claiming masks stop spread entirely? true

Your post contains significant COVID disinformation. WHAMMY!   alternative? Precognition?  topic touchy issue some. 

Ward 8? Czech Republic 300x smaller population 22k new cases, lmao.  Plus warm nice winter Excellent ventilation actually considerable effective. bars nightclubs open? so, sounds like paradise me. Oh never Brush teeth  I'm currently Pfizer's RSV vaccine trial! think I'm placebo... Easiest 300 bucks I've ever made  I‚Äôm keeping mask flu season going brutal. got organization-wide town hall talking return office. They're giving us 2 days week home starting January. People asked they're prepared loss staff. said, ""Well, people free want"". Great philosophy labor shortage.  Although worth pointing masks least effective element triangle ventilation probably effective.    misinformation. They're repeating nonsense tweet Marjorie Greene. Enough said. They're banned. Almost exactly 2 days booster me.

The night booster get great sleep nothing really write home about. aches. Woke still achy head ache tender lymph nodes arm.

Today pretty much lymph nodes.

Definitely side effects, definitely debilitating me. I've never law school could definitely handle study load undergrad accounting degree this. best couple days, think I'd unable work.

And considering without booster still chance catching COVID could result even worse effects, I'd recommend getting booster sooner rather later. Really. 19 COVID-19 stands 2019‚Ä¶it‚Äôs almost 2022! I‚Äôm getting sick this. experience perfectly describes mine.  fourth? üôÇ new normal personally. Like yeah still want normal meaning needing socially distance wear mask, need learn improve this. example, work. Prior covid, companies extremely reluctant allow working home covid forcing hand shown works, works better office environment. don‚Äôt J J England? people haven‚Äôt heard RSV kills lot babies. Keeping babies away extended family prevent RSV likely also bunch negative impacts hard quantify. without instituting vaccine required protocol.

Almost every major employee either Federal, Fed contractor (covered executive order), otherwise required vaccinated. 

I would prefer 100% mandate, bad saying. dont agree mask wearing general always makes less sense, even highly vaccinated environments. Covid disease catch many effective vaccines them. cause mild nuisance illnesses most, thats still potential people spread others who'll harder time dealing them...


Thats say wear mask anywhere time, obviously thats absurd. im take subway thousands strangers pass every single hour, I'll consider wearing mask like getting kind sick can't afford miss work kind sick either. Hospitals bursting seams

People seem realize that, fewer restrictions place, higher vaccination rates need be.  RSV wore mask finally see 13yo's school play (really want miss it). I'm definitely wearing masks going forward. Sucks Americans get bent out-of-shape masks act like they're worst thing ever. People need chill. good way think it, haha. Lots people stable schedules regularly work 6-7 days week. becomes huge hassle them, especially add childcare things. I'm fortunate enough set schedule, plenty friends regularly pulling 60+ hrs work week kids home.

Then forbid reaction like partner vomits 3-5 days every shot. Pregnant women much greater risk severe COVID complications. looked spreadsheet vaccination rates Orange County zip code, Huntington Beach 65 87% eligible population fully vaccinated zip codes. best numbers county, they're worst either.    blanket boosters quantity available. amount data increased considerably, domestically trials booster program internationally places like Israel.  Solidarity, parent 4 year old gets severe croup gets upper respiratory infection. He's ER 3 times last two years airway restriction. vaccine age group can't approved soon enough. dishonorable discharge ? real knowledge military discipline.  Half barely speak English. I'm fine working non-native speakers, baseline English ability. might cheaper cost us long run due constant communication breakdowns. ignore disease quarantine. Torah specifically addresses quarantine disease. big stretch make cover vaccines. Many religions require specific rules specific holy book actionable. We're heading colder weather northern hemisphere expecting *record travel* Thanksgiving, let alone Christmas.

We COVID scare recently, met unmasked parents told us next day dinner partners days prior tested positive. I'm hoping get sick, course us extension... assholes tested positive vaxxed could possibly be, rest us are.

Anyway, convinced us, we're going anywhere either holiday year. Fuck it. worth it. many idiots drunk kool-aid far road stupidity, admit wrong would mean dismantling whole world view. can't imagine who's *still* fan Trump willing that. uk's [ surveillance include data age group tables 2-4. use 2-3 month gap doses though; know shorter gap worse get third dose later. Well then, I'm going apply tax exempt status.  man acts arbitrarily RSV vaccine would awesome. breakthrough covid case late Sept (J&amp;J vax back March) pretty mild thanks vax. I'm done RSV sucks! Might area. I‚Äôm SFL well it‚Äôs weird mix masked unmasked depending go. Employees masked time.  wear kn95 mask clean hands public. opinion Social distancing restriction go away isn‚Äôt really practical doesn‚Äôt really much people moving around space, that‚Äôs opinion.  also summer Brazil winter US. bulk US got vaccinated earlier there's waning immunity potentially too. surprised numbers much worse Brazil 6 months now.  He'll regret loses GI Bill Yes. 12 week gap initially reduced 8. Currently 40,000 cases day. office since today must wear masks, meetings via WebEx... office.

The CEO absolute idiot. data time better, least six months Christian Science religion vaccination general, members free get vaccinated matter personal conscience required law:  Especially combine vaccines together - one shot flu COVID Using cases seems like odd metric. Surely better metric many serious/ICU cases caused, deaths. assuming rates hospitalization/death remain around same, use number new cases shorthand metric? tracking unvaccinated people, sounds like kind Gestapo another form. already working combo flu/covid vaccine. would yearly booster dose - different already flu vaccine currently. thing stop delta even evolutionarily well adapted variant coming along out-compete Delta much like delta original variants disease. Whats likely going see variants delta variant start popping since already accounts 60-90% new Covid infections. 

Like said, agree Zero Covid scenario virus already virulent infectious is. going eventually treated like influenza, yearly vaccines always risk severe strains/variants average popping while.

 biggest risk factor see many different animals contract spread covid due virus using ACE-2 receptor gain entry cells. Even miracle, get zero virtually zero human cases covid, find way back circulation due able many animal hosts around world. 

Another big threat threat hybridization. hundreds known animal coronaviruses, many isolated/discovered last 20 years thanks enhanced interest research due 2003 SARS-1 outbreak. likely thousands animal coronaviruses bats, birds, deer, rodents, etc remain unknown. SARS CoV-2 able infect large amount species, there's chance infect animal simultaneously infected known unknown animal borne coronavirus similar enough covid two viral strains replicating cells swap genes antigenic shift comes new Coronavirus traits animal strain really harm mouse, bat, pig, deer usually infects, causes severe illnesses humans less immunity towards it.

This already happens influenza rather often. recently 2009 H1N1 pandemic.  get flu shot every year I'm somehow able live life really interesting believe lost large part sense smell used fluticasone allergies summer 2019. used good sense smell, it‚Äôs cooked. Now, hardly smell anything cooking off. Moderna gonna kick ass far certain. Speculation certainly one way put it. scientific consensus.  agency $50b budget could things. maybe could de-prioritized Alzheimer drugs work.   biggie, dont worry (: happens immunity booster wains? it‚Äôs formula. keep getting boosters?

Most vaccines require multiple doses. error assume acts linearly. six month interval means likely we'll get lasting immunity.

Think every vaccine gotten intervals - MMR, DTAP, etc

The lack full approval really FDA incompetence inflexibility face pandemic. vouch this. Streets crowded. seem come back brought new untrained dogs them. Holy shit. So, really 1 every 200 U.S. citizens got tested positive yesterday??? FDA CDC's absolute lack responsibility properly authorizing booster shot result heads rolling agencies.   China afford it. Boosters may become biennial events every five years like tetanus Stop! remember talked TWiV, find 8 week intervals significantly better, probably still ideal. complex though, immunity actually evolves time well, antibodies decline, immune response 'matures'. fascinating subject, people tend oversimplify gloss details, there's lot nuance ""booster every 6 months"" probably logical.  hate term ""cancel"" regard. fired abiding workplace safety protocols. cancelled wearing improper costume 15 years ago anything.  Wow, really garbage comment got upvoted bunch.  There‚Äôs scientific reporting r/Covid-19. They‚Äôve picked variants samples taken believe New York sewage test presume rats. Let see find it

Yeah is:

‚ÄúMany mutations found expand tropism SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviruses allowing infection cells expressing human, mouse, rat ACE2 receptor. addition, pseudoviruses containing Spike amino acid sequence lineages found resistant many different classes receptor binding domain (RBD) binding neutralizing monoclonal antibodies. offer several hypotheses anomalous presence mutations, including possibility non-human animal reservoir. Although wastewater sampling cannot provide direct inference SARS-CoV-2 clinical sequences, research revealed several lineages could relevant public health would discovered wastewater annual events, it. we're accepting fate ease damn restrictions like masks stuff. Here's thing need realize, rules set boomers, going prioritize able get shit everybody else. got take matters life, want booster shot, get fucking booster shot. Take shit, yours! would great hospitals were, fact, fine. Every thing they've done past come back haunt them.

Somebody refusing vaccine probably record failure comply disrespect seniors It'll remembered. 

Any sea lawyers need remember tearing counseling sheet gets routed without signature, noted ""servicemember declined sign"" Fellow teacher, agree 100%. also led behavior issues among high school kids. people understood science, would understand public policy changes, mean rescind trust it. People leave forget. makes feel despair inevitable decline US. We've trajectory, think COVID ultimate blow. Getting worse, wonder winter going blood bath, since people letting guard down. never end, it...  Rough hear. Ontario Canada 14M...not different Netherlands 17M. 300 500 cases day. Still fair amount restrictions masks inside capacities normal levels. Like 2 months pandemic, people stopped wearing masks, stopped caring 6 feet away. There's fucking hope left antivaxers.  myocardial inflammation. extremely rare even happens usually mild goes away. happening shots slightly less pfizer likely due dosage. moderna booster much closer pfizer shot rather 3x dosage. believe issue due testosterone thats one theory‚Ä¶Covid also causing issue younger males. agree. way back spring 2020 messaging ""don't wear masks"", even back understood limited supply, people really needed doctors, masks work (why would doctors need work?).

So think people complaining messaging bright. else they'll cling reasoning, however shoddy, bolster whatever *want* believe. patently disingenuous, honestly know people sleep night. Except they're probably bright enough realize dumb are.

Yes, agree messaging frustrating follow, there's much control situation really know we're dealing with, learning go. Everybody focuses word ""coronavirus"" scariest part beginning word ""novel"". fear unkown.   trust people would eventually come around bodies piling street

They been, nothing matters folks someone explain booster becoming mandatory doesn‚Äôt even provide immunity delta variant, prominent variant US? missing something here?   mean now? go work, go stores, go bars, hang family friends. get 3 shots course 8 months, wear mask sometimes. Considering CDC recommending booster shot EVERYBODY 2 months taking J J, shit ghetto. Ok saying nonsense now. good one known yet.   would love see Americans embracing wearing masks cold public. nice thing would be.

But course, certain portion population think see ...  heart issue?

I Pfizer sought Moderna booster scheduled Friday, I‚Äôm reconsidering that. noticed too. Usually, Tuesdays recap counts cases weekend. makes sense, hope too, get flu shot annual work students combining two, turns annual booster would make sense. thing like never reaction flu shot reaction (minor) Covid shot.   tax dollars paying it. really end. Still mostly home ordering groceries‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve vaccinated friends there, 3 once, also cheated slightly pre-vaccination, 3 4 times year.  We'll mRNA combined flu/COVID vaccines next year (hopefully) much better people egg allergies (or vegans) Absolutely. complete detachment terms risk tolerance destroying credibility.   one contagious deadlier, know quite yet? current flu vaccines made eggs. making mRNA flu vaccines much much faster may eliminate guessing. save LOT lives much wishful thinking. People felt like deserved worry anymore, started acting like that. studies I've seen treated one symptoms country recognizes part COVID 60 days last time patient tested positive.

All stuff, even COVID itself, new formally accepted diagnostic criteria yet need read details paper read see they're defining stuff. Genuinely curious, would different before? dishonorable discharge would require court martial (a trial). would guess individuals might receive general discharge may honorable discharge. might earnestly next 3-5 years (I'm guessing).

Honestly, unlikely. almost certain need 6 month boosters 5 years. combination yearly COVID/Flu vaccine VASTLY likely. 

Don't assume anything needing one booster  Believing anything happened yet silly. make predictions, prepare ourselves, always understanding know, things could go differently expect.  Sure, 5th time get infected COVID boosted, never even notice it. happens Malaria, too. Eventually get enough even realize. Repeated asymptomatic infections. Truly first world problem piece cloth something get upset about. Though job dusty I'm used wearing N95 year past decade. sure I'm right person judge. That's failure education system get people learn science trial error, understanding changes acquire new knowledge, mean understanding given point based information time, opposed people randomly making shit go along (I swear, knew engineering major college believed that).

Also, people need understand public policy sometimes reflects logistical political realities always line science. policy changes necessarily mean justifications legitimate.  long booster take go effect? coming. far likely 6 month boosters terms efficacy. would love combo. I'm hoping see next year's flu shots!  There's simple model assumes correlation vaccination infection, three options ""ascertainment bias"" (ratio actual infections known infections).  attempt factor waning immunity. be? Last year flu virtually nonexistent. masks social distancing still generally force would imagine flu season also mild. Dishonorable hopefully. truly leaves mark ones pemanent record. Honestly I'll stop caring antivaxxers get safe antivirals carry wherever go. risk would basically go zero, long they're filling hospitals brim anymore (we're almost there), I'll life happily try ignore stupidity. kill themselves, care. People done part much bigger way getting vaccinated! I‚Äôve 3 shots, I‚Äôm beyond done. 

How requiring masks walk hotels restaurants bars event spaces airplanes, countless people space lobby bars tables eating drinking anything security theater? 

Require vaccines let‚Äôs move fuck on.  Fuckin magnets. Tide goes in, tide goes out. likely need something ""forever"". Look pattern DTAP MMR. highly possible need another booster, do, one.  Responsibility (or ""shame"" called it) devil! must resist.  stupidity - *willful* stupidity. *Angry, aggressively-ignorant, mean-spirited, self-defeating* willful stupidity. blood clot risk far less birth control, hundreds millions taken, I'm sure people would worry it, frankly. 

I love MRNA anti vaxxer going it, toss in, refusing take J&amp;J shot? lol  Yes! Worst case, help you. Best case radically improved protection. problem approach, encourages people stop testing ...  Maybe market equine antivirals appeal right gate. No, case. Moderna slightly less problem 4 vs 3 week interval. Longer better. still, 4-8 months ideal.      worth pointing Pfizer's original booster doses 30mcg, even half strength Moderna larger. Impact similar It‚Äôs security theater people won‚Äôt part wear properly. even type straight face? people done part whole time, including covering nose, wouldn‚Äôt theater may past this. Wish hopeful you. see staying bad forever see ever getting level really think much. least long time. JNJ - please get mRNA booster! Six months may optimal. We'll know year two  neighboring jurisdiction, turns back Saturday   10 percent less near GA/SC line Good deal. booster would give even better. I've read since dove 'details' covid akin cold flu terms mutating best solution might annual vaccine, except cold vacine. maybe wrong 'set' something like chicken pox measles one vaccine cures it.
 
At time saw theories bodies could develop memory cells protect us 'any' form covid 18months longer initial infection. dug see data supporting/investigating done recently (September August would 18 months initial infection people getting march later september/october start study.
 
I think lends credibility annual covid vaccine helped mutate unwilling get vaccinated. know recent history people opting vaccines brought back measles, mumps, tb that's another factor thinking without investigation (and may wrong read vs current) covid going need yearly booster/shot etc.
  Meanwhile 4k cases day county 2 million.   Moderna booster. sick 60+ hours. keep anything strong aches pulsing bones. Truly get bed. I'll keep we've got think people realize sick getting side effects. Arm hurt 3.

First shot felt mildly gross day so.

Second shot high fever felt exhausted day half.

Third shot mildly tired day nothing else.

All Moderna. Get masks nosepiece. wear glasses work 8-hour shifts mask fog. possible. meant say SJW, poor dude forgot 2016 anymore said another thread got replies, maybe someone discuss here.. 

i wonder history current 3+ series vaccines (mmr, etc) first came out, likely perfect regimen wasnt ironed first year distribution. fun ones ‚Äúfuck around find out‚Äù re: long well current vaccines last still hope stability long term - studies may show much longer interval first doses optimal, thats given children going forward, etc. hopefully mutations tamp entire world significantly coverage (rn 50% entire world 1 dose, obviously lopsided af bad less year out). hopefully it‚Äôll stabilize something like current vaccines, many boosters 10 years 2 3 part series, sooner titers indicate needed. didn‚Äôt vaccine flu back then. NYC thanksgiving parade NYE Times Square.

Transmission outdoors seem significant problem.

Lots vaccines require boosters. instance, tetanus every ten years. Flu every year, part mutates different strains predominate different times. 

We almost certainly looking needing annual boosters type coronavirus indefinitely probably even twice-yearly foreseeable future. course, future mutations may change better worse.

There doubt viruses future require vaccine development administration. example, ebola deadly burns consuming fuel, could mutate less deadly spread easily vaccines universally needed it, too. someone explain covid vaccine makes feel terrible? I'd imagine rather hard organism makes feel like shit couple days. Hell, know people felt bad weeks got shot. know want take these, highly doubt end third dose. doubt it. need high acceptance both. There‚Äôs higher chance response combination shot either individually. people avoid one response lowers vaccinations one. people avoid combo shot lowers vaccinations both. so? Zoonotic spillback likely deer-adapted strain optimized humans. would look like Wu1 Delta, might achieve immune escape antibodies strain. unlikely spillback would virulent highly human-adapted variant like Delta. wained little faster moderna also got J&amp;J + 2 Pfizer, last Pfizer dose April, got Moderna booster weeks ago. Valid concern. son NICU 7wks period two weeks RSV. Full recovery, almost 16 now, residual respiratory artifacts. Also knocked wife asses 3 weeks.

So many parents kids &lt; 5 disproportional fear COVID effects. risk profile children &lt; 5 astronomically low [1,804 hospitalizations [210 deaths also statistically far less likely involved spread, by-and-large yet school.

Imma considerate on.     figured that's us got last spring. absolutely idea vaccine getting arrived health department eligibility group came up. clinically ""mild"" usually means treatable home.

My coworkers solid job, whole, dear God, field needs help. it‚Äôs right vaccinated. don‚Äôt really see anyone masking outside anymore though. they‚Äôre walking buildings maybe, otherwise majority don‚Äôt masks on.

But yeah, it‚Äôs masks indoors except two three weeks mandate dropped. even then, 90% people masked indoors.

You really don‚Äôt see much masking activities anymore either though. almost never see people masked getting gas. they‚Äôre car assume they‚Äôre driving someone/picking moving car quickly there‚Äôs reason remove it. I‚Äôve done before.

While 2 doses effective 6 months preventing transmission symptoms, still provide benefit reducing severity hospitalization.

Majority hospitalized still unvaccinated.

Studies shown current vaccines boosted 3rd shot provide large number neutralizing antibodies effective stopping Delta. Sure, flu shot mandatory everyday living. 

I'm pro vax come. I've already booster totally rule getting fourth I'm convinced necessary advisable. often get flu shot, sometimes don't. Usually get I'm planning travel around babies/ old folks. works me. 

I've lucked far covid shot side effects. I've two Pfizer one Moderna felt totally fine. I'm likely willing risk getting taken day days semi annual covid shots indefinitely. I've covid I'm triple vaxxed. show LOT well researched data convince need more. Yeah, amount hate he's gotten despite, imo, amazing job pandemic depressing. fact vote close... even depressing. thankfully re-elected, think state would become Chris Christie style disaster otherwise. translate risk vaccinated adults? Breakthrough cases still seem low vaccine efficacy still seems strong even sans booster.  dose Pfizer‚Äôs contains 30 micrograms vaccine. Moderna went much larger dose vaccine, 100 micrograms.

A half dose Moderna vaccine would still single dose Pfizer vaccine. masking rules etc aren‚Äôt going vaccinating rapid testing would.

No vaccinated going prevent spreading covid contract it. piece still needed. States already seeing surges ICUs filling up, yet states decided lift ease masking requirements.

I'm suggesting endless masking, yet removing restrictions right holiday season going cause surge worse. 

Also I'm playing semantics, that's word prevent means. Would okay telling people vaccinated prevent spreading covid? Wer wait see healing period small. Either way testing system limits wet can't fully trust numbers anymore except hospitals. Triage started people hitting icus unvaccinated big majority. work outside winter? wear mask constantly live NYC need soon leave house.

It‚Äôs ok admit fog wear glasses time, it‚Äôs ok admit they‚Äôre always fun. someone HATES shots, I‚Äôm this. got 3rd Covid dose today flu shot, would‚Äôve greatly appreciated getting stuck once!!!  republicans worried filling hospitals, increase death. hospital COVID flu folks needing ventilators issue. lot older folks hospitalizations due flu. 

Fun fact, flu less contagious certain strains gone due social distancing mask wearing. Seems like un-mandated social distancing recommendations mask wearing flu season great idea going forward. can't get rid flu strains way, due ""wells"" animal populations, wearing mask grocery store flu season big deal many folks. 

Just food thought. true. Denmark also significant reopening summer, announced restrictions would lifted September, barely left. exactly someone vaccinated got booster week ago anti-vaxxer? makes sense whatsoever whatever.   Got pfzier booster Saturday. 

Seemed like 3rd shot gave least amount side affects.

First shot gave really bad headache.

Second shot gave really bad body aches.

Third shot gave slightly sorer normal arm little body aches hours advil knocked next day. 

Really glad got booster prior holidays! post appears vaccines. encourage read helpful resources COVID-19 vaccines:

Especially you‚Äôre connecting another long flight spending 24 hours transit. Airport plane plane airport plane, masks nonstop. You‚Äôre already exhausted uncomfortable rarely get break. think it‚Äôs probably combination. Everytime i‚Äôm somewhere two dogs, there‚Äôs aggression. Yeah like tested positive discernable symptoms fine.

When people say ""I got COVID 2 times vaccine dosage schedule"" specify personal symptoms comes alarmist really is.

You catch flu even flu vaccine. catch anything vaccination, depends sick get.

Like reason many people getting covid due large numbers unvaccinated transmission vectors floating around. got Covid booster flu shot time. Two injections took like what, 10 seconds longer? Effectively ‚Äúone‚Äù me. wtf lol correct realized thanks anyway! interesting considering government threw hands declared ""one shot good enough count"" like six months ago... Got booster last Thursday. Woke feeling super crappy half night fine Friday morning piece mind felt great.    South Florida? I‚Äôm Aventura majority people masked Costco, grocery stores, Target. exception around mall though - get dirty looks people wearing mask too-young-to-be-vaccinated kids masks mall. here. bought concert tickets venue changed policy fully vaxxed only. concerts exactly 28 days 18th birthday original plan get shots 14th day second shot would concert, they're requiring booster well timeline work. either gave convince parents let get sell tickets Trademarks practically useless unless use take measures protect others using it. lol Kn0w mE!!!!!!! daughter (10 months) got RSV daycare early October. sick 2 weeks, really bad. Almost take ER dehydration refused drink normal bottles (only drinking half) sippy. got laid two weeks, still dealing left-over sinus issues.

She got better (but lingering cough/runny nose) eventually got better too, jeez, really bad.

RSV vaccine would fantastic. Many thanks links. Can't say fully understand them, mRNA would seem way go. (The default probably sinovac.) 


Is recommendation long wait 2nd AZ getting booster? definition ‚Äúfully immunized‚Äù? Asking friend live city requires them.

And travel every airport plane requires them.

If would, could. circumstances response Reddit extrapolated twice annually, given time frame boosters 6 months initial vaccination. vaccine 2009 H1N1 pandemic, lockdowns anything like that. spillback humans looks like. H1N1 mutated pigs 50 years spilling back humans T-cells H1 envelope protein protected people born 1957 (when H1N1 displaced H2N2 humans). 50 years mutating variants probably billions pigs recombination bird N1 gene cross reactive T-cells still recognized N1 protein well enough take edge entirely pandemic. waiting January get PTO days back. can't afford work 45 hours, spend weekend knocked out, work another 45 hour week. need time placate parents keep house livable.   nope Username checks out.

Someone's grumpy goose. need adjust booster dose got booster shit put ass. got Saturday every day getting better first day felt good enough exercise. still sensitive lymph nodes side. 3x Moderna FWIW.

If added flu shot may pushing week. Yeah. sides rare, like 5 percent people get moderna shot them. Even though less efficacious, think partner going try boost Pfizer since joint pain common pain caused lot nausea. still issues Pfizer, maybe J&amp;J abstaining there's 4th shot. I'll keep getting mine long need to, sort get hesitancy case.   could memorize sequence Covid spread. Huge outbreak Ann arbor H3N2 flu.

Though strain covered vaccine, 500+ got mostly unvaccinated flu. Your‚Äôs better. There‚Äôs link! It‚Äôs immune system busy working causes side effects. Makes realize much feeling terrible sick actually signs immune system fighting infection.  issue astrazenneca blood clots? J&amp;J right?    happen many people die preventing covid ability spread. there's far many dumb asses world allow pandemic end. can't even get half population wear fucking mask. would explain they're dead-set fairy tale COVID genetically engineered virus escaped lab.

i.e. Since evolution never actually happens, ""must be"" intelligently designed. would love quad valent shot VOC it. Alpha. Beta. Gamma. Delta/Delta+. US STEM part pandemic response really well. Even response got Trumped clear going fail liberal arts part exam.  3 shot standard, huh? J&amp;J plus moderna got already behind again? üòÜ  **AGAIN: THEATER WORKS!**

In addition, ‚Äúkeep spouting that.‚Äù I‚Äôve pretty explicit normal, also ‚Äúsemblance of‚Äù normal.

You choosing listen.

And again, choosing gather quite literally bearing whatsoever.  Yep, exactly. Wait figure people get different flu shot every year. adds ... 50? 70?  every right thrilled it. Again, wasn‚Äôt arguing should/shouldn‚Äôt implemented. pushing back notion aren‚Äôt negatives wearing them. I‚Äôm fully mask compliant hate wearing it. There‚Äôs nothing wrong feeling way, there‚Äôs annoying push masks required, also enjoy wearing them. There's always hope affect like every time. talking basically everyone know who's 2-3 Covid shots, seems level side effects vary quite bit shots, including side effects all. So, good luck next time :)  really. Boosters needed plenty diseases throughout history. grew developed country, chances received whole host vaccines, including boosters cases, young order protect community. mention yearly flu vaccine - probably direction we're heading covid vaccines too. 3-shot recommendation single handedly created millions new anti-vaxxers

No.  Nobody reasonably believes that.   Practically speaking, believe vaccine mandates masking continue yo-yo hospital ICUs stop maxed out. 

The summer telling. Governments flirted lifting masking norms allowing people people choose vaccine adventure hospitals started filling delta. beds become scarce, COVID-19 stops unvaccinated problem becomes society's problem, mask pressure dum dums get shots.  What? 

It‚Äôs longer risk, longer worry 

That‚Äôs mean 

The Bubonic plague still infects couple thousand year it‚Äôs still ‚Äúgone‚Äù real purposes talking about? highest vaxxed countries world cases skyrocketing. Singapore Israel Scotland don‚Äôt think politics, IIRC Biden wanted roll booster campaign months ago FDA/CDC said hold on, let‚Äôs recommend high risk people.

Even recently last month arguing it, supposedly scientific feel like fundamental problem everyone looking gold standard research studies instead using common sense evaluate risk vs reward.  _think_ bible says blood transfusion sin. bible, course, says thing. Covid still exists places. serious health concern mean gone.  obviously know nothing.  certain point people refuse care humans around requirement doubt things change adapt, also truths come necessarily factored in. instance, studys England showing vaxinated people shedding viral load much vaxxinated people. (Either amount, confidence getting socialzing etc). Also who've gotten covid, seem better immunity vaccine. people hesitant, addressing concerns compound problem. point, fearful reproductions getting virus, get vaccinated. That's anymore since clearly endemic. Live let live missed window lockdown efficiently early Feb/march 2020. that's water bridge. know sure we'll need yearly boosters forever.

It might take boosters us maintain long term durable immunity. wait til assholes storm CDC, cuz ignorance valid science. true! Comm major got tons shit it, key realizing work largely done outside classroom. need degree open doors ultimately networking, loads interning watching public market route success.  Sounds quite feasible me. mind asking, one friend get vaccinated? I‚Äôm arguing whether mask mandates not. I‚Äôm arguing logic shouldn‚Äôt care wear enjoy it. can‚Äôt wait get point don‚Äôt to, someone wants continue power them. certain point choice, requirement. Overcook fish? Also jail. well according Ivermectin another package. Hearing mouth even flabbergasting. 
‚ÄúVaccine protocols masking testing.‚Äù 
That sentence doesn‚Äôt even make sense. found odd media general hasn‚Äôt really paid much attention outbreaks mid-west faced pandemic. lot focus goes winter waves NE West, summer waves south. Yet, Midwest region worst wave cases per capita entire country November last year.  Yeah didn‚Äôt fever either. I‚Äôm getting echo done heart today rule issues chest hasn‚Äôt really recovered. GP thinks it‚Äôs costochondritis. *messyging*  What? make go back? sort expect that, actually. disease going away. messaging part still confusing tbh. Right check eligibility, says ‚Äúmay get booster want it‚Äù. original 2 dose, messaging along lines ‚Äúwere going fucking fire bar society dont get it, go get it‚Äù. Maybe booster suggestion doesnt need quite atrongly worded, replacing ‚Äúmay‚Äù ‚Äúshould‚Äù would go long way  began US 15 cases course 3 weeks. Okay, thank letting know. hard finding information easily overwhelming. know you‚Äôre locked then.   go, watch this!     why. see personal responsibility. high effective vaccines widely available free significant percent community became vaccinated, duty attempt protect people around ended shifted individual's responsibility vaccinated wanted protection.

I stand original statement. one wearing masks. needed day care. fact, believe harmful environment. Children's hospitals sick immunocompromised people perhaps exception. means already feared. COVID-19 already enduring reservoir intentional unable unvaccinated humans, COVID-19 another species reservoir probably others well. ""Herd immunity"" eradication probably never table virus got Wuhan. adapt live COVID-19 like adapt live diseases. 

That sucks, end world. Influenza coronaviruses plenty interspecies opportunities mutate. Remember Bird flu? Swine flu? Yeah, also got 14000 cases yesterday. population 9M... Same, main side effect Pfizer vaccines flare-up three times. fever though, flare-up lasted couple days. Nope. I‚Äôm fully vaxxed still required state local mandate mask every public space. Making people believe life could return normal vaxxed pulling rug one many goalpost moving tactics encouraged lack trust governing bodies  Front page news, page 11 retraction. sure internet works, page 32 google search results?  varies. NYC varies starkly neighborhood. lot inertia seems come mass transit, since need mask ride. said I've noticed bus drivers way less inclined start fight past drivers refuse people boarding. really blame since seems like ""anti-mask"" ""willing spit threaten driver"" pretty round venn diagram. I'm sure there's plenty incidents.  Maybe antivirals keep long covid. Also plenty vaccinated folks spreading done pandemic deluded brains. Or, know, situation changes adapt again. Also, incredibly short sighted think worst get. actually fortunate covid worse disease. still found plenty joy life throughout pandemic many others. stay miserable adapt. Speaking someone remember school pre post columbine, US pre post 911, going go back prepandemic many people irreversible changes irreplaceable things lost. Trying force people back detrimental them, able make forget past 2 years so. Adaptation answer. permanent negative, however. Yeah, guess meant point go lives there‚Äôs risk infection.

A degree normalcy definitely wrong phrasing. Oklahoma here, hold beer, there's anything we've proven, know really mess things late game already sketchy. got booster. side effects second dose. lucky enough mostly mild symptoms. look forward future potential doses, that's what's necessary it. I'm happy enough well protected next 6 months, least.  See, kind small sacrifices mind making good sense normalcy. Yes true mean least long time see covid major part lives. GOOD  understand effective. article 12 months ago? state one, along ability scan check verification, businesses weren‚Äôt provided tools scan it. done federal level begin with. you‚Äôre careful. kind people graduate job direction, skills matter.

Which booster get?
Any COVID-19 vaccines authorized United States‚Äù ""AM STILL CREATE PERFECT   even let take pictures use that. anyone works pharmacy access lol know people fake vaccination certificates needed work. I‚Äôm AZ currently ‚Äúenjoying‚Äù security verified digital proof vaccination via SMART; state works myirmobile.com‚Äôs system, recognized valid (despite system requiring verification vaccination data state) SMART. least they‚Äôre checking QR codes &amp; certification sources, guess.

Anyway, new digital records much harder counterfeit paper ones, that‚Äôs nice. botched things badly Trump admin. Biden resign July 4th mission accomplished stunt. make online database Agree entirety.

My concern fact Fauci covered regularly, given massive platform every media outlet covers every word says like he‚Äôs President. 

I fear many people hang every comment, people loud enough force business public spaces cater low risk tolerances fear. 

We live. Ontario, ~ 500 cases per day province 14M (funny enough, still low enough per capita normal Fauci‚Äôs criteria‚Ä¶). Doctors TV telling everyone panic, telling government re-impose capacity limits. something like 90% eligible population vaccinated least one dose. do? Well, causes 10% population extremely risk averse start writing government officials *begging* restrictions. *already* universal mask mandates. happens? government listens pauses re-opening, bet reimpose capacity restrictions Christmas. 

TLDR: unfortunately Public Health officials (who naturally lower risk tolerance average person) get public eye, they‚Äôll causing risk tolerant X% scream ‚Äúdo something‚Äù normal life never resume.  masters health communication-- really interested public health math &amp; science background successful big programs. 

The pandemic made every penny spent degree worth finally made people realize important communication relates public health. 

Fun fact: CDC entire team health communication specialists apparently absolutely nothing.   public health experts talking about?

Immunocompromised people first gen pop.   keeping unvaccinated people out? Sounds nice.

Getting shot takes effort also free. excuse anyone get third dose next year.  Common cold variable mutates, variable bunch different viruses lumped together they're dangerous.

The flu viruses actually unique reason changing much &amp;mdash; segmented genome shuffled, someone gets two infections once, two viruses able sexually reproduce. Trillions times.  another shot add schedule, really. Like yearly flu shot. really think branded COVID SARS-2 - think things may different. ""The cold"" vaccine caused shit load things get grouped together ""common cold"" last roughly amount time side effects body. still really really high levels testing like before? 

Curious many would even detected US hypothetical 100% vaccinated/no deaths month scenario (granted, population town)... point can't imagine many people outside hospitalized would even getting tested, count towards case numbers.  Fluco! ‚ÄúIncidental exposure vaccinated individuals‚Äù boost immune system unvaccinated? misunderstanding? True, now. big issue immune compromised suffer antivaxxer dont follow local health ordinance/ pro covid law makers.

Yes, does. perfectly possible get vaccinated without health insurance, without anmeldung, even without ID. information widely circulated within immigrant communities, least mine. sure. even ounce critical thinking goes long way one.

You millions examples peers, individual level hard notice mass scale obvious! Bruh 20k days already Netherlands. Long ways go till normality lol. Fuck shit. two headline. Good 10,000 day?

COVID really good job showing easily manipulated people easily goosestep tune Pfizer (a company pay largest fines human history lies deceit). People complaining side effects, take Pfizer? AZ much me. first dose gave chills tiredness day that's stay home, ok too? :) Sounds ok me.

Anyway. draw line? desease ok spread not? why? basic rule for: ""Now can't walk around desease.""? get it. Delta R 7 Vaccination gets R (estimated 50 70% lesser spread vaccination) 2,1-3,5, ok spread Virus 2 3 people 7?

What rule behind idea? just: ""I want everyone vaccinated without line want pass.""? need messaging drop masks third dose.

Though course places currently surging (not many), people stop masking everyone will. people getting third dose that's them. fuck live? Lmao opposite Dr. Anthony Fauci Schmuck new illness, society hit hard right built immunity. people getting vaccinated and/or catching Covid effects weaken time. CFR 90% lower individual age brackets unvaccinated CFR. grandparents got ass kicked first two Pfizer doses felt great booster! hope booster might bad see many places. dead equal full recovery/no long-term consequences.

I'M PART! Booster felt like nothing me. 2nd dose sleeping day though. got booster day 5k thought might messed up, felt fine. Isn‚Äôt flu annual one it‚Äôs different year? Unless COVID heavily mutates need yearly boosters? Lol, ok fucking disaster. starters, CDC beyond political influence appearance political influence. could get hack director gives politicians answers want rather telling science says... gives loons ammunition. Lying Jesus also undercuts authority. We're told need masks PPE short find lying preserve supplies medical professionals. Loons accept nuance. 

There also major effort crack news orgs deliberately spreading bullshit profit. Fox demands people get vaxxed promotes antivax nonsense. need put disclaimer bottom screen show vax status every host. people decide think. 

As is, there's much disinformation that's stretching pandemic longer longer.  Pretty much assumed 2023 2024 would norm. would rolled whatever version flu shot develop year.   Thats good know. seen study Medcram mixing yielded higher antibody count, weird think mixing vaccines reason.   rates 90% when? 

Now, shaming someone ‚Äúliving normally‚Äù (in present). 90% vax rate among ""almost"" every zip code Manhattan, 1 place, wealthy based idea wealth translate covid transmissions area previously cases? 

Notice ‚ÄúFor instance‚Äù, indicating referring example. common vernacular, wealth NY closely associated Manhattan, making great example opinion. one confusingly introduced ‚Äúwealthy‚Äù conversation. 

No one said anything ‚Äúno covid transmissions‚Äù. insane bogie hit, current public health strategy western world. especially true world multiple widely available vaccines significantly reduces chances serious illness death, lessor extent, reduces chance developing symptomatic illness spreading repeating facts happened. 

No not. detached reality. difficult see closing midnight help us stop spread Ireland tbh. We've using vaccine/recovery certs order enter hospitality establishments since July something like 90% 12s vaccinated. still spreading. :( wish could claim same. friends seem ones interested boosters available. parents in-laws especially scoffing additional shot recommendations. point don‚Äôt energy anymore try convince care.

Edited add: they‚Äôre ‚Äúupset‚Äù they‚Äôre convinced they‚Äôll need boosters. They‚Äôre double vaxxed got early. Seems way us go work grocery store. 

A friend mine works ICU. Things definitely normal there. They're still crowded, still lose almost every patient gets intubated. still bad. helpful information, thanks clarifying. impression spike protein delta different original virus, antibodies recognizing therefore stopping infection. must misunderstood.  I'm eager see data breakthroughs vs boosted population initial 6 mos. thereafter. I'll happy get booster 2x/year need (my current plan) longer interval fosters true long-lasting immunity, much better. Plus vaccine around almost year showing horrible side effects like anti-vaxxers predicted.  Never miscommunication.  I‚Äôm sure CDC/FDA dragging feet this. goal everyone eligible booster get inevitable Thanksgiving/Christmas/NE waves (considering people got vaxxed May time immunity beginning wane across country).

I know I‚Äôm guy Reddit doesn‚Äôt know anything, don‚Äôt get messaging boosters non-existent right now.  could easily get 10,000

This virus *is brand new*. Frankly, god damn miracle multitude effective, working vaccines quickly. hit fifty years ago would taken years years (and perhaps decade) develop vaccine.

And \*never\* said vaccine would make ""immune"". start standard virus protection severe symptoms, hospitalization death. Period. even *test* whether would prevent infections initially tests take longer. since discovered vaccines reduce transmission infection 8X+ versus someone non vaccinated, relatively new information.

It took *time* figure main way(s) virus spread. touch? via air? Via aerosoled virus droplets? narrowed mostly spread droplets public situations, masks became important tool.  learned infected people spreading virus even symptoms, need wearing even felt fine added.

I'm you. Why, yes, missing something here. ""when doesn‚Äôt even provide immunity delta variant"" completely wrong. one's fighting religious exemptions anymore. write thesis, say sincerely held belief. believe.  remember excited fully vaxxed April. Vaccination rates rising, could see return normal.

Oh naive 7 month ago me. incorrect. 147k one day's report. 7 day average around 85k. you‚Äôre saying deserve felony refusing vaccine? know what? citizens fucked up. citizens fault US many people avoiding vaccine. obsession conspiracy theories ""mah freedoms"" problem.

Other countries everyone mostly vaccinated cases keep dropping.  childhood severe asthma survivor (mostly allergy induced), doctors able send home nebulizar prevent er trips severe attacks. something child?

I‚Äôm sure differences offer treatment thirties now, know made life easier parents able treat home like emergency room. 

I get better got older though use inhaler times year!  Anyone else get different booster versus got originally?  getting flu shot (wasn't eligible booster then, I've gotten since) elderly lady front both, flu one arm covid booster other. really wanted tell kicked ass thought might weird, lol  I‚Äôm sorry hear brother law, must traumatic. Hopefully booster help feel least comfortable enough function journeys grief. would accept included small subtext. fully vaccinated taken vaccines offered age group. 

Because going base restrictions vaccination status also need account fact younger people get vaccines months elderly (which ok) could affect young people treated. 


In Belgium get date need show free walk in.  maybe end uni 2025ish????

no promises :-/  sorry, squire got J&amp;J 8 months ago now, looking get booster mRNA double jab either Pfizer/Moderna?

My wife‚Äôs college teaches vaccine event staff spouses/partners eligible dependents, I‚Äôm trying figure get. Yeah, seems like particularly bad year. Viruses jumping chance people letting guards masking much. Hmmm dont believe im sure see face basically breathing smelling breath too! much sucked breakthrough case still better would without vaccine know sure.  Got 3rd shot way, 3rd dose Pfizer + yearly flu shot. one shot, 2 shots, time. 


I fully except become yearly routine I'm fine it. Grief process takes time  Nah. Policies change science gives information. RSV got finished kicking ass. Shit ain't joke. Glad they're making vaccine. 

Is worse year something? lot people getting symptoms describe ""mild"" (unless ""mild"" means non life threatening).  pretty simple. six months, antibodies probably dropped quite lot highest level (after first two doses). booster multiplies antibodies 10x more.

There evidence higher antibodies helps reduce odds infected Delta variant, antibodies serve first line defense, without them, body might overwhelmed sheer viral load associated Delta T-cells, etc., chance fight back. evidence this, look Moderna vs. Pfizer. Moderna recipients generally higher levels antibodies fewer breakthrough cases. Agreed. Like, reading comment thread suggests two doses may soon longer considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù yet I‚Äôm even formally eligible third shot. It‚Äôs mess communication. still bit surplus, enough give boosters entire eligible population. also varies province province. Ontario, 70+, immunocompromised, healthcare workers get booster. assuming may purchases new year. Yea tetanus shot knock park Actually, yes, situations masks somewhat annoying. would like see ""soft mandates"" peak flu covid season, people asked wear masks grocery stores, transit, etc. (which wider variety people mixing) office, school, gym. definitely giant case study anyone going public health. messy messaging.     reason keep mask mandates, even unpopular.  still looks good need acknowledge hospitalization death waning well.

The protection infection certainly wanes, people become sick. protection severe illness requiring hospitalization possibly leading death still remains steady 6 month (time frame data currently keep moving goal posts. badly misreading comment. Come people, let's shoot 5 years true. I‚Äôve 2 Pfizer booster Moderna one. never offered J &amp; J anyway, I‚Äôm aware anyone know offered given one. Surprisingly, article ah, is. Title horribly written.. really hope wasn‚Äôt supposed getting doses COVID. /s

Also, I‚Äôm even second dose want third? Jesus‚Ä¶ Pray tell one live one's life fully current German restrictions us live countries cultural leisure activities heavily restricted, yet eligible booster?   Same. plan keeping mine public moving forward.  big reason want combine flu shot covid boosters. tend bad reaction Flu shot due auto-immune condition.   take quantitiative Abs test? so, would mind sharing one? Sweet I‚Äôm fully vaccinated. 1 Feb year, another April waited chemist, offered booster. done too. Lmao congested Virginia involves people driving shoulder running red lights general fuckery Good hear good choice, JJ Moderna/Pfizer yielding best antibody count moment I've read.  lol yeah, older parents reactions siblings look like omg you‚Äôre lucky 

Yeah end it‚Äôs small price pay getting decreasing chance serious illness passing others  provide correct information. I'm open accepting new information, yet single person disagreed able provide source.

I tell undisputed though, level vaccination medical community identified needed end pandemic. Mask mandates lock downs proven work mitigating surges. Many places experiencing surges advocating lifting mask mandates areas areas might vulnerable surges needed vaccination threshold. fuck controversial?

edited twice grammar argument masks useful average person white lie? people buy doctors needed them? 2 months go get second dose, j&amp;j providing little protection point. think get mrna dose, check cdc guidance details  That's difference immunity sterilizing immunity. clear sterilizing immunity. 


But, even get still measure immunity avoiding worse outcomes. Nj, congested know stay lane commuting   virus endemic wildlife, yup. Even achieve 100% vaccination among humans there's way get animals. really doesn‚Äôt though. Measles doesn‚Äôt exist vaccinated populations. mumps, rubella, smallpox, polio. good first try it‚Äôs good enough long term. Novavax. Promising results far iirc  Yeah able vaccinate everyone 6 months fine. problem see takes 8 months something like that. 

I vaccinated early July 6 months would mean end year me. Belgium government reach sure. 

So happens me? considered unvaccinated give 2 months freedom young? Thanks reply, agree comes immune response. find fascinating folks 3 shots without side effects, rest us go day two misery! end though worth it. agree completely. I'm biologist, colleagues department study viruses say essentially thing. Right now, think expect boosters work better initial dose, time tell case not.  Actually, no. significant portion public willing continue work make ""over"".

Fauci restated *today* exact number stated 20 months ago beginning pandemic many times between. US needs get less 10,000 new cases daily. almost got July 2021, Delta ripped US.

The messaging changed, apparently tolerance listening it. state allows 65  think phrase means lying good reason, like harmless lie Protein subunit vaccines make best boosters. Though novavax ever bringing single vaccine market sure good basket store eggs. started covering CCP, lying mask effectiveness, pretending preposterous could come lab leak, maybe less people would skeptical.

But are. become political. mRNA vaccine technology versatile robust vaccine delivery system created. 

And super strain new pandemic mRNA technology theoretically functioning vaccine within day. Clinical trials may take 6months still mRNA tech extremely fast adapt.

We investing future.   Yeah skip protection winter safe effective options...?   clearly vaccines work. counterexample vaccine still allows infection spread disease, like almost vaccines existence. Yes! use wear glasses fairly often give eyes break contacts. month two masks completely stopped wearing glasses. shunned consumers, rolled UK.

We millions doses ordered, regulator approved it, millions doses arrived passed straight COVAX rather distribute vaccination centres.

The blood clots definitely factor that, doses arrived we'd already vaccinated (willing) 40s. 40 cut-off age AstraZeneca vaccine, J&amp;J used 40s given similar blood clot risk.  Michigan complete shitshow right now. covid cases country. get time another vaccine? two people know affected two days booster got something else simultaneously (one got flu shot one got whopping cough one) said ""that's vaccines work"" clearly vaccines work. specific illness vaccines kind work like shit think way fatalist them. need re-engineered boosters covey better protection last longer. public cannot expected get boosters 6 month cycle. lying Jesus

I'm sure we're talking about. thought talking Fauci.   Lol China rebuttal come on, destabilized global supply chain forcing population mandatory lockdown. also [is creating long lasting social economic US constitutionally unable I‚Äôm glad can‚Äôt. would create even worse economic problems already facing.

The population density fact actually substantiated several research papers relationship covid population density, here‚Äôs NIH you. yes ‚Äúemotional‚Äù reply academic one. ‚Äúwell NS good boys didn‚Äôt problems like you!‚Äù Exactly. many problems making happen future. got 2nd Moderna shot late April. feel like get booster third shot whatever soon even know works. think I'm eligible Moderna boosters yet idk safe go get another vaccine like that. advice?  immigrant, family members unique barriers getting vaccinated summer, although relatively well educated, speak German, informed point watching lot live RKI press conferences Phoenix. assure super easy me, imagine someone fence getting vaccinated really motivated might given it. many people think personal experiences representative majority. comment automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Always back talk, excuse can't (won't) part  Agreed. I'd say endemic past months. That's nonexpert opinion though. Measles different virus effective vaccine. fully vaccinated people catch spread measles.  understand covid mutate, vaccine fact wear time, many studies reporting CDC themselves, even Pfizer CEO admits it. understand say why. That's point. lying Jesus. That's different giving best advice time science evolving. That's completely fair. pretty clear countries like UK (now) Israel (before boosters) vaccines provide nothing like level protection months.

A huge study 800,000 US veterans showed much lower reason think trends graph continue time goes on. proven counties vaccinated early.

Symptoms began 12 hours shot. Chills, fever next 8 hours (so whole night lol) went away pretty intense headache 36 hours shot. Arm soreness went away 48 hours shot it. 

Pretty comparable Pfizer dose 2 reaction little intense though symptoms lasted less time me.

My gf hand got Pfizer 3 doses 3rd dose official never felt thing arm soreness also depends person person expect year two it‚Äôll become part flu shot. normal flu shot already 4 vaccines combined together, there‚Äôs inherit problems making 5. herpes Also masks sold virtually everywhere said excuse preserve stock bullshit. hoping virus would blow want people panicking dumb ass thinking got people killed.  COVID zero correct path, required universal cooperation. Countries like US made serious effort.   Usually phrase ""making go along"" used pejoratively, pandemic true much literally made went along.

So many things public health canon March 2020 ""well obviously done ____ sooner!"" May 2020.

But case vaccines, phrase ""fully vaccinated"" never got ground. knew trials rolled immunity offered full sterilising immunity. word ""fully"" avoided due risk confusion we've seeing lately, foresight obvious hindsight obvious.

There's probably good psychological/sociological explanation many things pandemic, playing percentages, ended presented all-or-nothing things. leads arguments rather enlightenment. Yeah started JJ Pfizer ^_^ I'll never wear mask again.  likely going stay us covid medicine Merck Pfizer reduces hospitalization deaths 50% 80% respectively game changer. would like/hope vaccine actual medicine keep risks minimum.

Asymptomatic measles spreading population.     Probably recent covid vaccine (there needs delta variant update) 6 months last booster.

We also need stop accepting recovery covid antibody response non-uniform people recovered covid.  I've got raging clu I'm sure messaging problem,

Yes is. common theme saying ""there proof that..."" followed ""so dont recommend it"" 

""there proof masks effective, dont that""  
""there proof vaccinated people spread dont worry""  
""there proof boosters needed""  

While true truth, always absence data. making recommendations study wont done another 2-3 months HORRIBLE way message public want COVID all

Sorry, that's vaccines work. Fewer anyone lives there. California's population 22 smallest states combined.   think you‚Äôre lockdown. Could be. Additionally, Health Comm team likely advising say... Dr. Walensky... cannot say. find many communication issues we've seen course pandemic relate back people power (the ""experts"") speaking emotionally, speaking cuff, frankly, speaking ass. 

Unfortunately, campaigns Health Communication team likely working grab much attention Director CDC shouting impending doom making [huge claims without supporting data. 

So, guess re-state first comment: CDC entire team health communication specialists **probably lot overshadowed hubris experts bureaucratic BS.**   prediction: prediction wrong one event results months long hyper media focus sense urgency come back normal?

Was hyper politicized? People yes, government bathroom watching forcing to? No. want clean hands, wash yours.  effects pfizer booster second dose. One day completely knocked achy, everything fine following day. Exactly. agree more! idea long lasting additional protection boosters be. quite possible rate decay much slower booster dose primary course. I‚Äôm sure Reddit would correct I‚Äôm wrong, sure read vaccine flu covid already development. think Pfizer one 3rd shot rolled it.  media pays less attention Midwest live vacation here. That's pretty much it, extends topics, COVID. outbreak NYC obviously issue, outbreak Florida might disrupt vacation plans.  Booster programme already action. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs goalpost moving. beginning said ‚Äúwe think goalposts might here, visibility, can‚Äôt say sure‚Äù. we‚Äôre closer, they‚Äôre saying ‚Äúwe‚Äôll, know goalposts include booster probably don‚Äôt know that, there‚Äôs visibility can‚Äôt say sure. 

People confuse best estimate expectations guarantee people never more. still new disease, don‚Äôt know long protections last. Even now. Seems politics money anything point.
Got first 2 shots problem, never got covid. know anyone covid.
But time goes seems money politics anything. 

I agree though seems like idea they're annoying. seem confused.    problem isnt supply, distribution. Canada keeps sending vaccines nations getting thrown out. morally reprehensible care best utilization resources prioritize citizens nations. proportions people using vaccines given countries, would good argument. isnt. Lots countries wasting vaccines, vaccines could save lives, morally reprehensible. good way become Batman villain, though. also questions recently breakthrough infection. Mine four months ago, means I'm probably okay get booster, booster even anything? doubt immunity begun wane span time. Seems like waste booster, shots completely harmless, I'd taking risk benefit, even minuscule risk is. long wait?

My mom went Hawaii last month. also breakthrough infection time us (same household, pretty unavoidable). antibody test decide whether get booster flying out, thing turned positive person administering even chance set down, apparently really unusual. decided wait booster.

These guidelines seem based strictly risk factors blind variables. Wasn‚Äôt Sweden one lax countries anti vaxxers toss around proof herd immunity works?  Unfortunately boosters still approved live, stuck 2 now. Oh yeah 495, awful get third? offered it. I'm 19 PNW US.    s/annual/bi-annual/g.

Next shot's going March-ish next year, probably whatever they're going call Thanksgiving's variant. Calling now. Vaxx, mask, ventilate.  Antibody levels drop time, meaning protection infection drops time. Efficacy measured severe disease, hospitalization, death, holds strong Pfizer moderna 6 months (and don‚Äôt know longer yet). easy! High incidence community spread + masks indoors = stay home frequent outdoor events. could story US, nope. I‚Äôm hard hearing. I‚Äôve verge breaking many times. never take anyone else, I‚Äôm hell.

The press doesn‚Äôt seem interested talking issue, either. feel unseen. Flovid pill take cramps every month, thought. Tbf institutions West Africa vestigial structures colonialism government usually pocket business interests abroad. populations little reason trust governments, let alone ""developed"" nations given history exploitation We're saving whatever new strain comes Florida JJ March Moderna weeks ago. Zero side effects (except sore arm 24 hours).  flu vaccine wear really quickly.  good, typed comment kinda fast probably verbose. Plus, mean antivax crowd rambling people 'shedding spike proteins' etc., definitely careful wording there. crappy immune reaction flu covid vaccines. Covid vaccine much worse, still, flu vaccine gives mild fever days. honestly ever want get shots time.  think one biggest problems people's reasoning days, especially conservatives, experience, soon find fact agrees them, decide they're done. goal find fact, find right facts. major recurring theme outspoken conservatives they'll declare since using facts back feelings, anybody disagrees must using facts all. However usually case conservative clinging misleading fact, brazenly ignoring plethora data disagrees overall point.   Wear mask correctly. Get vaccinated. die. That's know certain. Lol indeed. argument one towards beginning this, who'd obviously feeding misinformation. even realize vaccine developed using standard flu shot tech... say this, frustrating, got look info J&amp;J, say outright, could still see paradigm shift (and even consideration, imo) exchanges afterwards. well shit. getting booster tomorrow. I'm fine guess.  semiannual, since looking like 6 months may time booster. [Original Antigenic thing people raised questions covid, 1) seem issue current vaccines; anything, would less prone than, say, virus since getting antibodies spike whole virus, less risk 'imprinting' defunct antibodies, 2) suggested there's ways around problem arise.  


There's myocarditis risk pretty small, possibly mitigated something simple aspirating needle injecting. Ideally want longer lasting immunity rather repeated vaccination, need booster every year definitely end world (I really see happening 6 month basis lot different reasons). collect data shows waning protection 3 shots, way 2 shots? way they've making decisions whole time?  Fwiw, there's thing ""fully vaccinated"" unless everyone gets time. Otherwise end millions variants, thus leaving even percentage chance (and growing) variant infect got booster 30 mins ago :) took courses Masters Public Health degree really teach shit courses causing problems. fucking disaster far uncharted territory.  true extends way beyond Covid vaccine information.    people get sick even they‚Äôre unvaccinated? Manage summer restaurant south balls walls busy, 2 hours waits every night, masks average like foot people

Only 2/40 staff members caught year.

We see people country.

On hand, killing 50 year old people my
Hometown, yet 92 year old great aunt recovered fine.

It doesn‚Äôt seem serious, I‚Äôm left leaning, vaccinations (excluding Covid) I‚Äôm definitely antivax. 

What I‚Äôm getting it‚Äôs crazy see people online foaming mouth third shot people everyday life past year half haven‚Äôt even taken smallest steps prevent we‚Äôve normal. talking close proximity people fucked beautiful country Woahfully underpaid, I'm respiratory therapist...I never thought I'd see day I'd make almost much np/pa. That's different argument physically isolated vaccinated easily; instead issues getting vaccinated much tied willingness.    works, cause keep calling antivaxxers... 

#\#clueless.  fine decided get shitfaced evening. One beer made feel like dying. Won‚Äôt definition keep changing efficacy wains time? need boosters every 6 months. many stories I've heard, getting vaccine piss easy US? could walk apothecary, tell white lie 2nd shot, get it? article ago stating millions Americans gotten boosters like without ""permission"".

Do actually check background database see shots before? people wash hands poop, also individual choice publicly discussed mandated situation?  wtf almost unbelievable bad messaging been. like they're even trying much time.  Murica!  remember first white house press conference CDC recommended masks. Immediately Donald Trump got done reading 'cdc recommends everyone wear mask' next words said ""so recommendation. it."" nearly meltdown like bro, things never ever million years needed say, tippy top list. Immediately knew going happen, happen. Immediately press conference, pro-Trump Republicans suddenly became anti-mask overnight. one stupid ad-lib likely perpetuated pandemic.  have? Absolutely. Unfortunately, federal level abject denial virus &amp; full dangers, way last January. now, would nearly impossible create one way data gathered &amp; stored.  Yeah mean available would likely different answer, see benefit waiting it, especially given may never even come.      Can‚Äôt tell you‚Äôre dumb blind I‚Äôm 20 years old, stick two?  ""less honorable"" mean dishonorable, one's getting refusing vaccine.

If 'less honorable' mean general discharge one cares. mean other-than-honorable discharge, one outside federal government cares. also unlikely discharges OTH.

The article says general honorable. one care.  wonder 4 year old could go get shot pharmacy (e.g. Walgreens) parents say 5? I'm honestly curious this, FDA/CDC recommendation basically let kids go catch covid absurd.  


Also love require people want vaccines get them, block people want getting them. thing foolish booster decisions seem walking back. got booster yesterday pharmacist asked ""are qualified?"" help laugh stupid way ensure qualified? barely know criteria is.  IFR SARS-CoV2 far lower. universe SARS-CoV2 IFR higher SARS. None. SARS FAR deadlier. even debate. consensus: ‚ÄúCFR estimate approximately 15%‚Äù. Even assuming lower 7% that‚Äôs SEVERALFOLD higher SARS-CoV2 IFR estimates. 

You‚Äôre making shit support narrative here. could case? It‚Äôs endemic mutate like flu. Messaging bad, people need take responsibility part too. can‚Äôt expect constant truth mutating situation. nice.   Got mine yesterday CVS state still doesn‚Äôt allow everyone 18+ get vaccinated. didn‚Äôt even lie pharmacist. wanted see vaccine card make sure last dose least 6 months ago. want get booster somehow decide question say work *insert grocery store close you*. They‚Äôre going call store ask works there. Except they‚Äôre unvaxxed. data clearly shows vaccine companies milking government. real world data showing return higher level antibodies also significant improvement infections even hospitalization death. Unfortunately early say whether need yearly boosters 3 doses might last 2, 3, 5 even 10 years.   Oh, like flu shot?

HOW MANY CHIPS SORO'S NEED PUT ARM DAMMIT!!!! /s another question. eligible booster shot? 

Are 18-24 year olds allowed get booster shots? 

If someone 55 years old, get booster shot completely healthy? 

If someone 56 diabetes, get booster shot? 

Thanks information. appreciate it.   Yup especially virus good, Canada already seeing record inflation saw something record obesity UK kids today  LOL.

It‚Äôs pretty well-known folks Japan happily ignoring lots guidelines. Bars ‚Äúsecretly‚Äù opening imposed shutdown ‚Äúfriends family,‚Äù said: ‚Äúif get two doses mRNA vaccine one dose J&amp;J, never ever get vaccines Covid go away forever‚Äù, said ‚Äúyou need vaccines‚Äù later, would agree. 

What really happened evidence ‚Äútwo doses mRNA vaccines one dose J&amp;J provides strong protection virus‚Äù, six - twelve months said ‚Äúnow data, looks like protection infection declining, considering whether boosters make sense allow (the answer yes) considering whether boosters required considered fully immunized.‚Äù

There way predict Covid do, long protection vaccines last. could next six months protection severe disease death still high need boosters. could Covid evolve be. Ore dangerous evade vaccine induced immunity need variant-specific boosters. 

The point know data for. don‚Äôt know happen future. Right now, cases high heading winter, great. fear cases skyrocket, prudent thing get boosters, significantly improve protection infection also increase protection severe disease death. Pretty hard get Spain/Portugal level. First doses stagnated 74%. First said stop accepting recovery Covid general, said based mild cases. 

We accept natural immunity part populations vaccine high risk event option minimizing direct exposure. fullstop? don‚Äôt see, example, benefit people Asian countries wear masks colder months they‚Äôre sick go public? sounds like common courtesy me, opposed usual American approach coming work you‚Äôre deathly ill capitalism coughing brains colleagues.    good. hope enforced.  got second Pfizer dose 7 months ago got Moderna booster two weeks ago. totally mix match. could guessed?    I‚Äôm tired him. Always bullshit disaster looming around corner. Im sure fifth dose booster still stuck 2020. Please provide link article name   Immunity based active antibody levels, it‚Äôs based memory B cell activity/longevity. Ie, bodies ability rapidly produce antibodies exposed pathogen, preventing symptomatic reaction. 

Depending structure B-Cells response antigen, viruses rate mutation, efficacy change Again, don‚Äôt think restrictions sustainable way living. People eventually get tired. Context matters.

Some contexts 100% normal.

Others not.

This difficult concept. eyes take Dailys, shit gets expensive.    I‚Äôm sure get easier get older! struggle I‚Äôm happy healthy active struggled years.  specifying ‚Äúmild‚Äù however.

This issue languages subtle. I'm scientist move goal post. That's logical fallacy intellectually think many people missing people need balance risk factors.

I follow point trying make here.  Instead, told two vaccines fine

We literally never told this.

What hear tentative reports immunity original version(s) virus remained certain level X weeks. That's it. information would come time, people *constantly* going possibility variant arising would throw wrench everything.

Two doses enough fight disease last spring. true. Kind crazy, elegible population already vaxxed. third dose missing still. Maybe let burn sustainable way living one arms legs missing face? cyborg enemies?

You walk tell white lie work high risk setting without elaborating setting get 3rd shot. Many even ask, they'll assume signed 3rd shot eligible. Thanks. try admit mistakes. really think whole world would better people feel admissions fault somehow bad. also think learn mistakes admitting first.  expert someone peripheral experience people type research.... answer almost definitely complicated think. working though.  USA babyyyyyyyyyyy.     ‚ÄúFlorida shot‚Äù sounds like something getting whole time. absolutely have. Look Japan's response &amp; relatively null mortality rate, even congested areas like Tokyo.

All they've ""been there, done that"" SARS, bc consider akin national &amp; community duty dishonorable follow guidelines protect families. There's lot secondary sources even subversion weed too. think scientific field going communication problems moment study hands journalists...and downhill reaches grandma chain. illustration sums perfectly me: aren‚Äôt moving goal posts. They‚Äôre changing based evidence.

I'm seeing phrase ""moving goal posts"" many places conclude making rounds anti-vax conspiracy community right now. understand they're objectives expectations campaign anymore. mask got vaccinated like endemic + forever goals? vent get understand they're expecting state authority make determination. Every state 'allowing' boosters winking nudging people lie get booster. specifying ‚Äúmild‚Äù however.

I think many people missing people need balance risk factors. thing situation constantly evolving problem people ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù changed suit evolving situation. figure solve problem?  realize comment thread literally article changing definition ‚Äúfully vaccinated,‚Äù right? unequivocally objectively change goalposts.  blame politicians biased ""news"" personalities.

Pretty hard get facts people get information source, third party agenda Punishing health agencies making data based decision last thing we'd ever want do.  mean 'temporary solution'? great solution, may enough (especially people refuse get vaccinated). 

 
Like things, need 'all above' solution :). world changed. need vaccines, treatments, masks, better ventilation, working home, outside activities, building hospital capacity (including nurses doctors). appreciate actually amended views.  many people either like: oh well! bad them!  don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs thing, *sorts controversial*  complicated that.

If strong reaction delta variant absolutely correct.

You provide strong antibody response variant vaccine yet.

However, see non-linear response antibody creation mild covid cases number interesting papers published here. 

You google find them. 

Basically, mild case covid, going mild antibody response. We're still sure happening I'm fascinated subject proven main reason covid problem.

The strongest antibody response (but bit dangerous) would get vaccinated covid, get strong delta response.

Dangerous though advise :) get another copy place received vaccine. mine stuck fridge one super strong rare earth magnets lose easily.  Man, excited 8 year old would considered fully vaccinated weeks subject quarantine requirements school. went concert March 5th. last one COVID. Never expected get bad so, I'm going start applying NIH grant research crystal ball technology.  Based video seems like flu died due Covid precautions, made comment above. seems like, least short term, flu big problem past, flu shot might needed year. Based video sent also seems like scientists less able predict vaccine needed year, makes think getting flu vaccine might needed year. depends live. Mask use extremely high indoors California. I've got booster scheduled Friday! 6 months able schedule anyway. Even though officially given ok everyone get, ask proof high risk.   Yes, normal kid six colds per winter country. basically same.  CDC website says mixing vaccines fine COVID-19 Booster may choose COVID-19 vaccine receive booster shot. people may preference vaccine type originally received, others may prefer get different booster. CDC‚Äôs recommendations allow type mix match dosing booster shots.

Also second Moderna knocked ass night apparently others work got it, got Pfizer one react bad us. try - flu vaccine, I've missed few. coronavirus apparently miss one can't work (or least country moving direction)... also constant threat dying great suffering physical health result within feet another human strain virus may may recent vaccine for.

Fuck it. Living constant state fear? That's way live.  almost science hard. Speaking boomer say everyone get booster asap States It‚Äôs almost communications designed midst unprecedented, fast-moving situation *very* limited data everyone trying devise best plans could fly.   many habitual troublemakers? literally meant Donald Trump pope lol Catholics crazy infighting mess though.  recommend mrna boosters, pfizer/biontech moderna, long answer: Moderna might bit better personally wouldnt care Thanks that. get religion thing US, unaware rural Canada catching up. Sask. originally remember religious people radicalized point dying beliefs. ‚ÄúGetting flu vaccine once/year like doing‚Äù. Nobody says that. don‚Äôt, tens millions don‚Äôt, nobody shames it. false equivalencies know it.  Go away, seriously. arguing argue.  That's CDC advising still far know. Last article saw 10 minutes ago googled said total 6 cases blood clots 10 million+ doses administered, isn‚Äôt statistically significant. Outside college setting, get Walgreens CVS, etc. even need insurance. data show J&amp;J followed Pfizer Moderna booster much better antibody generation 2nd dose J&amp;J. (It's proven could due body developing immune response J&amp;J adenovirus vector delivers DNA instruction, second time around immune response muted. mRNA vaccines work differently.) sadly hardly anybody cares anymore still wear mask everywhere go it‚Äôs like aren‚Äôt even living pandemic anymore. agree SARS-CoV2 killed people. That's stupid obvious.

But SARS deadlier terms CFR. virulent.

You're understanding point: CFR SARS FAR higher. lucked containment early on, SARS would disaster world even worse SARS-CoV2 given much higher mortality. Morbidity less understood, also probably worse SARS-CoV2.

Do underplay SARS-CoV1. stroke luck got contained.

(FYI attacked body similarly SARS-CoV2. know they're epithelial viruses, right?) Ew.  reminds study prove parachutes don‚Äôt reduce probability injury death: also selective parameters altitude velocity.

Also, think human pregnancies usually last approximately 40 weeks last period birth. Lmao ship sailed people failed mask distance beginning.  blame people thinking that? corruption. Backdoor deals. rarely gets punished common occurrence politicians lie bed corporations.

It's government's failure (at least U.S.) sowed seeds mistrust want us trust pushing mandates vaccination requirements. Wonder people divide got 2 doses refuse get 3rd üòπ

There‚Äôs term yet!    Why? got booster Sunday. Went in, got shot, 15 minutes, go. even sore arm next day.  Yeah idea downvoted. country recommendation get booster shot six months regardless type vaccine wears time.  got email mrna flu shot trial. surprised two together next year. Flovid sounds like pill enlarged prostate.  Judging dog shit sidewalk people refuse pick up, yea... safely say NYC back baby!  Yeah story here. Gf got pretty serious medical complications second Pfizer shot. She‚Äôs got hopes set Novavax.    Last two shots got Friday I‚Äôm weekend. Learned lesson now, get Monday afternoon. Take Tuesday Wednesday.  Weird, since quick search showed multiple valid resources stating vaccination highly recommended MS, since Covid could devastating MS patient. One study Italy showed small percentage possible issues, correlation/causation determined.  tried sign booster Walgreens said ineligible don‚Äôt fall CDC guidelines. forwarded CDC site I‚Äôm ineligible I‚Äôm 65+, don‚Äôt live LTC, underlying conditions, don‚Äôt live/work high risk setting. Thanks CDC.    getting flu vaccine once/year like doing? taking anywhere 10 minutes couple hours (depending travel mostly) every 6 months big strain life? Outside pandemic, ever gone movies? That's 2 hours exchange enjoyment, less time cases exchange keep living. I'm okay this. failed (as species) get enough people vaccinated eradicate natural result. Presumably we'll wind getting vaccinated every X months (where X may even 12 like flu shot).  problem actually science illiterate public watching science happen real time.  Quick shoutout conservatives reason can‚Äôt society anymore. bruh unvaccinated scum/s You‚Äôve said yourself‚Äîpeople familiar flu. early experts say could annual booster like flu that‚Äôs probably also people default assumption.  I'm yet, unfortunately. gonna low, Saxony, federal state highest infection numbers holiday today, probably submitted data.   first one almost exactly like ""normal symptoms"" supposed be. Minus think latex allergy. second one hell almost 2 1/2 days. First 12 ""normal"" muscle aches. 36 hours massive cramps,, massive nausea, fever high 101, vomiting relief 20min hot shower. last 12 ""normal symptoms"" 

I'd still call much better catching CoVid, even scary 36 hours. booster open like 2-3 months (schooling issues delayed 1st) I'm going get That's weird, national data shows arround 73% (or 74% even report FioCruz (Brazil biggest scientifc institute, one make AstraZeneca vaccines here) saying first dose stagnated guess NY Times Oxford maybe using 2010 population census data, instead 2020 2021 population estimate.    times change. high school smart kids got bullied. Glad see knowledge power took hold, even twisted form.

This anti bullying campaign pretty interesting though. Curious see plays out. Incompetent false hope bs. thing 'fully vaccinated' - can't fully vaccinate flu, coronavirus different. recent vaccine don't.

You full partial *dosage vaccine* full partially vaccinated, technically.   really sound like would myocarditis, talk doctor. Sounds like something else unrelated.  Guess need get promoted job modern corporate world. Communications. mid range employees mostly 50% tech 50% people skills. higher people skills need.  eligible booster now, go get one. Vaccine shopping never solution. getting ridiculous lies beginning seems like keep going.

Don‚Äôt get wrong, vaccine best option fighting pandemic government media really shit job. thank god things back normal state tbh. username something something Look profile. Dude's troll. Dude, literally linked study BMC WHO. Show study SARS shows CFR/IFR lower SARS-CoV2. can't. consensus around 10-15% study. 

A NUMBER IFR studies SARS-CoV2 1% less: seriously arguing gotten sense IFR disease yet? Come on. pretty consistent since start pandemic last year. 

I'm twisting data. understand CFR IFR are, right? Tell words numerators denominators ratios.  different everyone. people get strong immune response flu shots too. people get strong response COVID shot maybe day two. arm sore times, 2nd dose felt sleepy entire day too. Kinda nice honestly.  many flu variations body seen many covid variations body seen? 

Its immune system's reaction. people bad reactions others don't. reason people get sick monthly people go years without getting sick. We're different   said: ‚Äúif get two doses mRNA vaccine one dose J&amp;J, never ever get vaccines

You mean like literally called J&amp;J ‚Äú[one tough time there, aren‚Äôtcha? Yeah agreed. required I‚Äôll it, gonna volunteer. Nah, it‚Äôs bad. First, there‚Äôs good chance third shot gives significantly longer-lasting protection, like Hepatitis B vaccine. Second, lot people ICU dying (unless already 80+ yo). vaccination, Covid big deal. protection infection wanes quickly, protection severe disease pretty stable.

This going turn particularly troublesome common cold, one every kid ‚Äúshould‚Äù get vaccinated against. want meet God bad. say let them. No, many legitimate doctors saying thing, FDA going reverse itself.

Ireland‚Äôs bars nightclubs required close midnight starting Friday part measures government imposing curb spread coronavirus surge cases left hospitals overwhelmed officials scrambling solutions.

The measures, country‚Äôs leader, Micheal Martin, announced Tuesday night, also include request people work home possible requirement show vaccine pass entering theaters.

‚ÄúThe surge experiencing dramatic reminder virus threat continues represent,‚Äù Mr. Martin said. ‚ÄúWe need act deal surge.‚Äù

In last week, Ireland experienced second highest rate hospital admissions a2021, Mr. Martin said, situation putting hospitals nationwide significant pressure.

But even measures announced, Mr. Martin acknowledged ‚Äúcontinued progress journey normal conditions inevitable.‚Äù

He said could rule measures curb spread virus, country‚Äôs successful vaccination program meant large-scale lockdown could avoided least now.

Stephen Donnelly, health minister, said ‚Äústark new modeling‚Äù number predicted cases behind rationale new measures.

Speaking RTE Radio, public broadcaster, said Tuesday models showed without mitigation measures, Ireland‚Äôs intensive care units would see influx 200 450 patients Christmas. country 300 permanent intensive-care beds.

‚ÄúThat would something avoid, making changes,‚Äù Mr. Donnelly said.

‚Äî Megan Specia also 25% testing, can't really compare daily cases without looking much test... significant number positive cases US asymptomatic cases caught tests required travel event. anything like second dose Moderna, virtually impossible work day after, means least two days without full income lot people. Plus laying bed chills headache exactly pleasant. Still pleasant getting covid, though.

Hopefully side effects bad get fourth, fifth etc. shot. one viewpoint, personally I'm waiting severely asthmatic two year old able vaccinated. He's ER ICU three times 24 months, common cold (the third time bipap mask nearly needed breathing tube). Albuterol effective younger children. he's bit older he'll lot resilient larger airways easily develop bronchiolitis basically we're cautious winter. viral-triggered asthma course can't always keep catching respiratory viruses sure would nice drastically reduce risk catching least one highly contagious circulating virus first. 

I understand people bend backwards account expect bare minimum effort people. masks definitely minimum effort. Monday reporting always includes weekend numbers. entire pandemic revealed binary/black&amp;white lot people think. completely stop something, ""worthless"". guess got car accident still injured, would say seatbelt airbags ""didn't work"". problem learning go virus changes people won‚Äôt take basic measures. would addressed March 2020 January 2021? 

Alpha Delta theoretical possibilities then.  nuts think mask gather indefinitely. vaccinated normal health risk, statistically, getting serious illness covid (hospitalization death) 10x lower risk serious flu illness (hospitalization death) 2018-2019 flu season. Look CDCs numbers breakthrough covid infections flu hospitalizations deaths 2018-2019 flu season. risk low enough really don‚Äôt take extra steps protect yourself. People gone insane covid media over-blowing risk vaccinated people big cause it. vaccines reduce risk level 10x accepted *every year* flu. widely available. Co-author, grabs something parks head, retracts it? quaint. 1989 CDC updated MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine schedule include second dose. vaccine previously single dose. 

Did undermine confidence MMR vaccine? people stop trusting FDA/CDC? people stop trusting pediatrician? 

Or people take kids get shots doctors recommended even notice? work hospital everyone's theory since vaccines began rolling January. annual flu+covid shot. Believing won‚Äôt 4th seems pretty silly point too.   correct population well -- US ""only"" 5.5x bad (254/M rising) compared Brazil (46/M falling).

That's obviously still awful, slightly less bad. noted thread, Netherlands currently 921/M soaring -- higher vaccination rate keeping deaths (Per residents: US = 3.5; Netherlands = 1.45; Brazil = 1.15). Deaths trailing statistic, we'll see lower value holds - stay US values. That's total population, including young get jabbed, 5-12 year olds approved less week ago.     20k point Delta. think closer 15k, jumping closer 200k/day, little 100k/day now.

I've checking worldometer every morning year now.  actually can. We‚Äôve done before. risk never over. Cases never zero. surprised see another decent wave Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year. I'm hoping enough people caught + vaccinated see downward trend. What? local news reporting -100 cases per week county. already back normal would report corporate. CVS give shit here.  suspect like lot vaccines series 3-4 year childhood regular boosters likely series beginning followed boosters. 

We don‚Äôt know, though, wouldn‚Äôt sure either way. Immunity waning could lots things including timing shot 2. I‚Äôm pessimist much think correct don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll take proper steps avoid outcome. doesn‚Äôt mean shouldn‚Äôt try.

Texas reporting in‚Ä¶ haven‚Äôt worn mask forever think idea vaccine outreach poor rural area, one-and-done shot far easier.

People problems getting transportation, cannot afford take work, etc. easily served single shot.

I think single shot developed poor people, certainly works well situation. going middle country heading mountains vaccinate people remote villages -- easier one-and done? course. Six months optimal.

I assume since Pfizer fully approved, there's less need expedite Moderna, going process normal speeds. (Possibly waiting line behind FDA work unrelated Covid?) UK Canada go much longer (than 3/4 weeks) doses? things looking them?  got booster week. Idk I‚Äôm reactive others likely yearly thing Im literally losing one week every year life stuck bed pain. Smh people worn masks absolute beginning Yep, similar story here. son 4 now, two ended staying hospital oxygen twice regular respiratory viruses (once bronchiolitis, one doctors guessed mild pneumonia something). We've tried careful pandemic know much would struggle covid. Hoping approval five asap, also counting days turns five least!    place. Yesterday saw reporter team testing restaurants bars policy towards bad tests vaccination cards. tests months old showed someone elses vaccination proof still accepted. places straight dont care, similar mask use.
In terms performance nothing beats PCR tests. antigen quick tests shorter time generally less reliable. Usually perform well sick people height virus load. depends well test yourself, professional testing sites may filter positive people. review tested many antigen tests sorted good work: Comparative sensitivity evaluation 122 CE-marked rapid diagnostic tests SARS-CoV-2 antigen, Germany, September 2020 April 2021 Delta change things, contagious.  welcome.
I'm sorry hear brings anxiety. can't say understand well differing outlook. 
 
I also ""breakthrough infection"". call infection. Happened 5 months 2nd Pfizer dose. Funnily thought get tested close contact, turned contact's test negative. coincidentally got infected somewhere else around time.
If betting man bets would gym. 
I knew gym high risk location pre-vaccine I'd stayed then. got vaccinated decided return IMO benefit outweighed risk. Covid permanent viewed infection inevitable. 
My policy ""exercise best medicine"". Generally supported physicians too.
I course still exercised home pre-vaccine get level intensity wanted. 

Risk evaluation something everyone differently. may view risk evaluation crazy, view still going gym dense public places pre-vaccine crazy.
I hope figure works feel better. Yes. Denmark.  extendo nozzle? Wasn‚Äôt suppository Irish people need understand haven‚Äôt introduced widespread antigen testing. reduces capacity PCR system substandard result Moderna approved booster. It‚Äôs half dose booster.

There million reasons masks big deal. make communication harder, especially traveling speaking foreign languages accents, destroy people‚Äôs skin, uncomfortable, makes hard recognize people, everyone knows working mask absolute worst, extremely limiting, reality use really security theater one wears correctly takes lowers constantly.

Traveling long-haul constantly required masks miserable. Requiring masks extremely limits events experiences industries. It‚Äôs death thousand cuts.

I‚Äôve never flu shot life doubled Flu shot booster COVID.  prefer cube open office. least visual privacy. discouraged sitting breakthrough case. guess lied said underlying condition hindsight. Instead, staying home patiently waiting turn think mean infinite doses ;) Wouldn‚Äôt treatments also possibly temporary solution though? religions encourage vaccination. 
this woman idiot danger ppl around her. Flu yearly shot different virus every year  problem religious exemptions, insist notarised letter particular sky daddy approving decision confirming member good standing fully compliant. People need lives back fully.

How would mask requirements limited subset public spaces prevent people living requiring annually absolutely wrong way go.

Why? we've never done before?

The world changing time much bigger ways this. flu always kill people should. know masks work everyone used them, absolutely discussing mask policy going forward. justification ruling kind mandate. Lots things possible. Early data Israel extremely positive boosters, though.

Another possibility would booster early fall cover holidays winter, let ride summer cases low anyway great glasses fog up. Exactly. People expecting 100% certainty absolutes something ever changing. But....the numbers make US look really bad continue testing!! It'll keep showing big numbers!!

There's going constant shifting goalposts ""fully vaccinated"" there's chance everyone ""fully vaccinated"" time long enough end. decision makers decided get covid possibly distribute vaccines Africa, that‚Äôs decision you‚Äôd listen to? They‚Äôre strictly looking health point. Maybe make vaccine better neutralization. previous vaccine wild-type we're several iterations removed it. mean? What‚Äôs scoop that? One friends didn‚Äôt meet current booster criteria looked like Pfizer applying universal boosters. probably way. There's reason almost never hear flu shot called ""vaccine"". Go Walgreens, CVS, etc signs say ""flu shot"". Right wrong, people see ""vaccine"" assume long term protection, lifetime protection. yeah i‚Äôm chicago aside wearing mask class, public transit shops, walking table restaurant, life 100% normal. go shopping, go eat, see friends, go class. hear say ‚Äúdegree normality‚Äù borderline bizarre‚Äî life 90% normal, masks 10% pandemic time left. ‚ÄúPeople‚Äù ‚Äúupset‚Äù they‚Äôre trying push anti-vax messaging.

No one know real world unhappy getting booster. It‚Äôs opposite. Everyone like ‚Äúhow soon get it?‚Äù  everyone vaccinated

This big ""if"".

We decent vaccination rate province, big chunk USA pretty mediocre numbers.

We know breakthrough cases, primarily driven unvaccinated. 

Getting kids vaccinated help lot, areas might stuck course, it‚Äôs entire booster dose Heads Pfizer booster full dose Moderna booster half dose makes difference you.

You confirm pharmacist.   really understand think idea/hope immune system completed process six month longer gap complete two week gap. Thus third shot longer interval could mean immune system gotten final kick needs remember kill Covid much longer time period. 

And think known sure that's case scientist think possible. someone else mentioned above, vaccines get redone every year many require doses really done. fingers crossed! yes. situation NL right (and germany, austria, region) reality stay. highly vaccinated population still massive case waves. think NL 85% adults vaccinated. means vaccine going stop coronavirus. vaccine holdouts going much get all. dont think lockdowns announced NL going much either, cases always going peak point (they arent quite yet).

i think adjust prediction fauci accept normal means continuous coronavirus. think many years another stronger vaccine Delta going on... there's really reason standard recommendation fall.

We're gold fish, remember time year going multiply virus. Moderna already [publicly working 

(sorry, already noted /u/TDaltonC) Yep. second dose Pfizer 12 hours worst muscle pain I've ever life. Excruciating, whole body, point sleep; could lay everything hurt. relief hot shower pain immediately started soon left water, except worse cold.
To give context (I'm exaggerating)- pain threshold high enough walking on- even dancing with- torn tendon two months using broken wrist (for writing, school, etc) three weeks; would kept doing, except asked mom help brush hair thought weird (so sent Dr x-rays).

Will get booster absolutely to? Yes, probably (after talking doctor). thrilled it? No. Nice, country 3-4k cases day. bad theres 2 million us. 10-4 thanks! Florida last year telling us 4x annual pneumonia deaths 2 month span COVID...  know, could free year old data vaccine effectiveness VOCs, let hospital systems implode. hospital's revolving red alert due full ICUs COVID desirable thing society/Hard S. Maybe don‚Äôt smelly breath People really think science, especially regards novel virus, supposed static never change. I'm sick idiots.   may ask, what's field? I've altered deal. Pray alter further. totally agree. It‚Äôs fair. It‚Äôs body. spillback event going deer-adapted, human-adapted.

It look like Wu1 Delta.

It may achieve partial immune escape cause infections currently circulating human variants/strains, unlikely virulent escape T-cell memory.

There's precedent influenza 2009 pandemic human circulating H1N1 seasonal influenza 1918-1957 displaced disappeared humans. mutated pigs 50 years human-derived H1 gene recombined bird-derived N1 gene produce 2009 H1N1 pandemic. pandemic fizzled people born 1957 cross reactive T-cells H1 protein, even mutation recombination.

Spillback deer kind rewinding clock 2019 (or worse) very, unlikely something like sci-fi. is, however, virus certainly becomes endemic we'll never get rid it, eradication completely table. virus going human race permanently, everyone going catch it. Get vaccination shots, form T-cells advance. J&amp;J? initial course J&amp;J, worried Moderna booster reports read saying side effects laid days. turned side effects really bad me. arm hurt, mild aches, mild fatigue, really bad all. friend experienced thing initial course Moderna.

It's good idea line day two off, case need it, certain need it. seems people mild side effects less likely talk significant ones. saw sort thing initial course, turned 1 4 whole-body side-effects (at least vaccines general).  ""Sailors don‚Äôt comply separated refusing vaccine could receive low general discharge honorable conditions, Navy Times reported. "" Since world shut manner past 2 years, everyone wearing masks indoors (where live least) would need flu shot? Meanwhile seems though most? US pretty back somewhat normal.

People may behaving things ""normal"", mean are. We're still losing [over 1,100 Americans COVID [running 100% Expected since February 2020 (110% October).

There reasons public health experts still working pandemic. bad many Americans willing join them.  College student cries piece cloth uncomfy hundreds thousands people die saddled lifelong health conditions. it‚Äôs ***inconvenient*** you, isn‚Äôt it? :) women hormonal acne concentrated chin jawline. Masks universally make much worse.

I'll give point, add hormonal acne list cons phenomenal covid vaccine. People refusing take responsible now.

It remains seen perfectly protect people future covid waves, well get work immunocompromised. there's still flu.

I still think limitations masks balanced limited type mandate, think rule mandates see subsequent years go. Agree disagree, guess. Seat belts first introduced cars around 1950. lap belts though. 5 years later 3-point seat belt patented.

We're learning virus human beings societies react. Adjusting protocols increase safety nothing new part learning experience. Thank I‚Äôm south FL went grocery store yesterday - would say roughly 75% customers saw wearing masks. Good, waning immunity makes sense. Yeah vaccine brought numbers way genuinely seemed like things getting better made it. delta hit‚Ä¶ god rough seeing India news. killer headaches shots weeks. person never gets them, holy shit. life awful months. I'm legit dreading getting booster point. know COVID worse fuck man. Portland checking reason might annual natural immunity coronaviruses known last couple years, guess follows vaccine immunity isn‚Äôt longer lasting. It‚Äôs also possible need updated annually like flu vaccine.  Vax rates 90% when? 90% vax rate among ""almost"" every zip code Manhattan, 1 place, wealthy based idea wealth translate covid transmissions area previously cases? I'm repeating facts happened. try twist whatever hell trying here, change happened. Given understanding words ""cohort"" ""scapegoat"" though, I'm surprised.    This. I‚Äôd also like see normalization staying home you‚Äôre unwell (like happened early pandemic). 

Encouraging people cover faces they‚Äôve got cold/stay home they‚Äôre sick would probably decrease number flu cases hey‚Ä¶

And would probably increase productivity wouldn‚Äôt fuckton people calling sick Bob dragged ass work flu spread office.   public funding (like NIH NSF), one could make research misconduct claim get OIG investigate.

If found committed research misconduct, get barred grant applications quite reputation wrecked. bother get two shots think mixing matching pfizer/moderna/J&amp;J whatever flu shot complicates supply chain issue making administering vaccines. one issues covid vaccine vials opened/mixed etc administration think three different schedules temperatures/batches/shelf life etc open.
 
It certainly help anti-vaxxers get covid vaccine tie flu shots covid vaccines might get flu shot even would anymore knows. Seriously. Look stuff post Facebook. hate everyone isn‚Äôt cult. Yeah don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs at, literally person masked day tire shop Montana. peaked massive delta wave last month 100 cases/day. Things weren‚Äôt much better grocery store weekend.

The restrictions restrictions placed, thanks jackasses state government. It‚Äôs free since spring, even basically masking. Capacity limits never really enforced. pandemic unless get sick here. Ya NPI ask everyone they‚Äôve flu like symptoms recently letting near kids followed explanation RSV.  unlikely spillback would virulent highly human-adapted variant like Delta.

In scenario, think it'd likely we'd updated vaccine, let thing? Would absolutely wild mutated strain Covid deer ends thing ends pandemic. obviously long necessary, think people would clearly prefer future vaccines could improve durability least move annual shots most. see would controversial goal science medicine provide eventually.    Based comment, seems condescension might thing understand. tetanus

After initial series, tetanus boosters required every ten years, least US. makes sound like it‚Äôs official CDC announcement, random countries shifted definitions slightly.  Lol Reddit reply ever. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve presented evidence explain something doesn‚Äôt agree point view choose ignore repeat completely subjective stance took earlier‚Äù what, see stop sign think, ""Right, stop mean again? Oh yeah, means slow bit"" roll past expecting ticket? actually know word stop means reason choosing ignore meaning context spreading virus.

I'm guessing thing true word prevent well.

If keep promoting untruthful things, like idea vaccinated prevent spreading covid, people stupid enough believe actually can't spread vaccinated. 

What level reduction transmission think warrants word stop prevent level transmission reduction think vaccinated offers? thank clarification :) Def question doctor, generally they're people wait 2-3 months infection booster (not first second doses). That's hard fast rule, though. probably depend risk factors. Fully fully vaccinated?  home also mask mandate area. Fortunately, place Florida stay much can. go home, simply comply mask mandate. Flying different, fly commercial, get food drink continue eat/drink flight. way wear mask getting plane exiting. I've taken 4 hour flights without wearing mask.

To answer question, ends people stop complying. long people go along nonsense continue. everyone vaccinated, see much risk going maskless. almost 2 years since Covid hit, vaccines widely available (at least US) think makes sense start returning normal. thought facts care feelings?  One interesting things vaccine misinformation try make look authoritative misrepresenting data. 

While googling around information, found [this crappy breakthrough infections. 

In it, author Sept. 6 Oct. 3, 70 percent Covid-positive deaths occurred among fully vaccinated persons, according UKHSA data, 2,281 deaths among ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù 611 among unvaccinated within 28 days positive test. Partially vaccinated individuals accounted 98 deaths among ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù Britons increased dramatically since August, Expose noted. Last month, Public Health England reported 600 coronavirus deaths unvaccinated population Aug. 9 Sept. 5 1,659 dually vaccinated population.

Seems scary, right? even [link must true. Right? Right?!

Wrong. 

They correct raw hospitalization death numbers‚Äîbut large portion population vaccinated. look hospitalization death function 100k vaccinated unvaccinated population, vaccines prove highly effective. look per 100k numbers pages 14-16, graphs pages 17 &amp; 18 prove that.

It depressing people actively attempting mislead public. article found clearly attempts scare people away vaccine make think isn‚Äôt effective raw data shows is.

Look countries filled republicans

If everyone got vaccine could‚Äôve would‚Äôve gone athlete major uni Guess Michigan sucks then... Lol We've bad waves compared rest country.

Wonder people stupid? detectable antibodies necessarily mean enough illness Progressive Insurance gonna words. USA we‚Äôve struggled get even 70% vaccinated vaccine passports, door door campaigns, pop vaccination centers everywhere. Anecdotally know several people got two shots interest getting booster. Unless big carrots sticks, going do? Regular every-10-years normal schedule, addendum give additional booster case dirty serious wounds 5 years since last booster. Feel Capacity high certain areas high concentrations unvaxxed. Nationwide, occupancy *way way* immediate risk filling even close saw Alpha Delta waves. Calling ""fully vaccinated"" seems like misnomer now. pretty clear going ""are vaccines date"" situation rest lives, like annual flu shot. think vaccines contain tracking microchips, vaccines change DNA, make sterile, vaccine recipients going drop dead 2 years. 

How rational human understand that? point animal population. Even everyone behaved doubt would go away.  Guilt-tripping people, great argument. work anymore, know? Vaccines exist.   Thanks update. what's ""dee""? FYI human body capable fighting something like 58,000 viral attacks time. symptoms feel vaccines body's autoimmune response; result infection (the vaccines infect you; they're inert break days even body nothing). feel different things vaccine get. body respond way responds.   article:

There literally covid restrictions country. care doing?  Why? literally easiest thing world counterfeit. Anyone thinks they're restaurant concert everyone vaccinated vax cards checked sorely mistaken. formulate flu vaccine match strains circulating year. also true flu vaccine efficacy fades matter months even strain changed, antibody levels fall (similarly covid vaccine). I've known time prior covid's arrival getting flu shot early leave unprotected flu season ends, I've targeted mid October yearly flu shot.  serious question LMAO Antibodies proteins. get broken base amino acids digestion. exception babies absorb antibodies mothers breast milk. male models?

That's great case rate low *now*, deaths per capita tragic. rocketed something like 27th 8th short months, vaccines monoclonal antibodies widely available. Low case rates Pyrrhic victory. Even vaccinated, virus live back throat something like 5 days. Wear mask, especially around lot people extended period time. Oh yeah, west coast NE littered republican governors. Biden following science though side Fauci per Politico article said everyone get booster?

Yet Biden sided Fauci instead scientists looked US data coming Israel makes zero sense. Sure argue hindsight I‚Äôm infectious disease expert yet many others general public looking Biden saying ‚ÄúWTF thinking?‚Äù way back August September. taking step taken two months earlier even though pretty obvious back then, seems common theme throughout whole pandemic (and many areas policy making).

Four months later (in July) suffered bout severe abdominal issues, shortness breath palpitations. doctor saw thought might sudden onset IBS. slowly climbing hole, wondering really mild case myocardisis. could sudden stress anxiety, know.

So predicament, want take booster, really scared happened, even though likely unrelated vaccine. Irrational, know.  Covid yet continues overwhelm hospital system.   10k cases there's less 200 cases ""per state"" (though that's necessarily true know states less population metro area explain numbers)

The chances coming contact wild someone Covid point randomly due ""community spread"" lot lower there's 100k cases. Oh good! remember years ago Ebola ravaging Africa would hear stories locals attacking health workers people refusing adhere restrictions family members would catch virus. originally attributed behavior fact happening 3rd world understand modern medicine. half right. Okay -- agree spread virus bad, right? spreads, likely becomes sooner later we'll another new variant --- variant *may* one current vaccines work against.  much concern.

And also know vaccinated likely symptoms get infected. such, could feel dandy spreading virus people over-- thus causing infections. Similar kids rarely get symptoms huge carriers. 

Ergo -- get herd immunity, smart wear masks crowded public areas. Yes absolutely!! know plenty STEM people absolutely terrified networking/reaching people. Luckily don‚Äôt necessarily things alongside making good grades. can‚Äôt tell many STEM friends come help interviewing networking aren‚Äôt gifted skills. would sure fucked sat back comms classes expect things unfold me, really went pitched networked like crazy! think old school comms still people think think PR/comms today, reality, I‚Äôve pursued several technical certificates outside class simply new employers looking comms person able everything sun, since landscape changing sooooo much . hopefully stigma goes away soon!  doesn‚Äôt matter people. know guy grinded ass director position gave sextupled evangelical crazy. Welp, attrition helps remain! That‚Äôs happening tomorrow. may know, protection infinite. people unvaccinated chance getting infected higher chance infect others also higher, also somebody vaccinated.

I safe vaccinated, obtain higher resistance. RSV generally real threat toddlers get initially infected. immunity lasts bit year. common refresh immunity lot flu season (and barely notice). Normally, toddlers get passive immunity mothers... 
But due - appropriate important - social distancing mask regulations, skipped entire season. (Well Germany did, anyway). according Amboss (German medical publication), pediatric emergencies already overwhelming hospitals weeks due RSV, way ahead season. Never gets old. Never. aren‚Äôt. of‚Äù normal

Pick one  Rhetoric hell skill master.  helpful information. aware current vaccines protected Delta. impression spike protein delta different original virus, antibodies recognizing therefore stopping infection.

That's kind annual flu shot works.  mostly get cocktail baseline strains plus targetted new strains.  Honestly, I'd surprised COVID boosters incorporated regular flu shot next winter.  isn‚Äôt true find Israel 64% fully vaccinated that‚Äôs enough

That sounds great

And it‚Äôs already trending  country people struggling get 2nd dose. Many thanks.    fucking morally reprehensible vaccine hoarding first world keeps moving goal posts constitutes fully vaccinated. 

Most world able get FIRST shot. allow mutations disease suffering emerge prioritize GLOBAL vaccination coverage. Yes know, makes two doses, Johnson people therefore fully vaccinated even booster got booster flu shot Friday. Easy peasy lemon vaccinated literally thing flu every year, what‚Äôs difference?  That‚Äôs exactly said. done clarity convenience, especially Biden said would boosters all. wish aggressive 65+ booster push beforehand they‚Äôre far risk. push virus back eventually enough medical development. However we've made process slower woefully unprepared stupid pandemic.   county 55 active current cases, trending down, mostly things feel normal here. can't presume vaccine safe, can't presume unsafe.

Yes might die that‚Äôs inevitable even everybody vaccinated. 
I totally pro vaccines finally want booster. make yearly shot many years seems like cool idea. New record 1247 new daily deaths. Government number. agree I‚Äôve three jabs. 

From start, messaging clear cases hit x threshold (or whatever criteria scientists wanted use) would mean annual shot extra booster. Instead, told two vaccines fine messaging cdc boosters weren‚Äôt needed, hence list requirements get one. even people subreddit asking okay get third shot cdc still saying no. 

It clear, consistent message beginning. mean, given two things kill less tenth number people dying pandemic ""over"", they're quite heavily regulated, I'm sure exactly trying argue.

If serve steak friend wanted rare, they're face face making decision themselves, get sick die, ability pass another person. can't get consent every person come contact public, somehow manage infect someone, there's guarantee pass someone else.

Car crashes contagious, yes, rarely go five ten speed limit given road, safe so. Again, using combination expert opinion judgment. drink, that's issue, I'm never position drive tired.

Statistics aside, sometimes wear mask specifically potential comfort rightfully anxious ongoing pandemic - currently, people children young vaccinated. would get shot every damn month means don‚Äôt die horrible Covid death get long Covid. It‚Äôs big deal.  shall -- pandemic control.

Which happen people get vaccinated wear masks ... we're screwed. make tiny sacrifices normal day

Again, pick one. less-than-honorable discharge follows man rest life. employers ask past military service, hire someone less-than-honorable discharge.

In reality, E2 middle Indian Ocean gets order, follows it. order report sick bay get shot, does. amazing something straightforward beyond comprehension many. perfect example real world health safety consequences subpar education system country. understanding still provide enough protection Delta booster original vaccine sufficient. Waning immunity time bigger problem right virus's new mutations. Ankylosing Spondylitis flared big time month second Pfizer dose. Two boosters year would rough mentally. Went breakfast weekend waitres wet coughing sniffling mask snuck without ordering. 

Definitely part certain population.   tell me, objectively ""anti-maskers"" prolong pandemic?

facepalm.jpg Wisconsin Minnesota same. people get checkout, there's 0 people wearing masks. One day recently almost everyone wearing masks, next day almost one. thought new mandate wear masks everyone. nope.

And scar! Good hear! symptoms like earlier poster night sweats temperature increases? gonna reflect change vaccination % charts? Cause number keeps going despite people's waning efficiency feeling they're gonna keep counting 3rd shots shots get 70% despite us never actually getting 70% us protected. Exactly, government typically slow adapt. third shot appears wane, reason forth shot would anything beneficial sixth month so?  wear mask want others want? option mitigate risk substantially everyone there.  Yeah, definitely entirely due bad messaging nothing targeted misinformation campaigns made sure say ""symptomatic"" ""severe"" infection shift policy came objections universal boosters US. want COVID all, think keeping hospital enough long term health impacts common.

If willing data point, good you.   Personally, I'm really difficult time Dr. Fauci. troubling want faith public health officials. desire cooperative part national community, much want like him, opinion messaging wildly incompatible seen competent trustworthy. Terrible, terrible messaging.  Kentucky, mass vaccination site that's probably why. Still mask culture PNW. What's point. getting booster fuck that. Yup. Thanksgiving problem. see US hitting 150k early December it. Pfizer dose 1 2 back April, Moderna dose 1 unofficial booster back September work constant cases need protect / family Dad Covid 2 doses vaccine. doesn‚Äôt think needs Booster. data share sway him?

I‚Äôve gotten flu shot every year since remember. problem getting two-for-one year.    ton endemic viruses too, though‚Äîhepatitis, HIV, pertussis, chicken pox.

I get people personal familiarity cold/flu viruses, disease circulates population several years considered ""endemic.""

From CDC: ""Endemic refers constant presence and/or usual prevalence disease infectious agent population within geographic  got 2 shots spring booster recently. think covid much think measles, polio, mumps, etc. suppose possible I'll get covid point life, given effective vaccine, top worries leave house. let crazy drivers traffic main worry regarding mortality.  noticed thing vaccine doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúwear need refill‚Äù though. Coronavirus mutate. It‚Äôs fast influenza virus lacks ability recombine, it‚Äôs still quick enough likely require annual vaccines. probably become every 2-3 years slower rate mutation though. flu vaccine lot guess work coronavirus vaccine well due exceptionally high rate mutation   means ""yearly booster"" problem! Sorry getting downvoted, interpreted question legit answered such. People click-happy around here. I'd say due testing criteria. SK, still follow contact tracing method, means anyone contact confirmed case ""has to"" take test whether asymptomatic not. Vaccine helps lot fatality hospitalization rate, much transmission rate compare former. Mandating vaccine drastically wanes efficiency 6 months completely pointless boosters mandated well. formulated alpha variant

Nitpick: formulated wild-type COVID-19, predated Alpha variant several months.  Expecting clear, consistent messaging Day 1 new health crisis unrealistic expectation though. scientific method allow that, like - all. me, sense I've gotten - aside Trump's effect communication - there's strong lean toward talking people. Everyone knows condescension obsfucation they're target. Couple large population distrust government, proof correct. 

False messaging (masks useless vs masks save lives) wrecking ball public confidence. Excuses like ""we trying make sure medical workers PPE"" admission lie. fucking say fucking mean, want public faith statements! 

Because messaging assuredly factual, even highly educated left fend far identifying implementing reliable measures health.

And public told lie lie, leave much room complain millions people get vaccinated trust say. It‚Äôs likely vaccines weren‚Äôt able tested longevity desperate need get vaccines work.     takes 4, takes one every six months, I'm in. drama it. global pandemic.        Fan room counseling? 

(Eye-roll)

Most allegedly missed fan room counseling would've gotten head handed them. Seriously get every booster fully vaccinated. correct way handle it. Make booster two dose within last year sufficient. get things degrade forcing massive lump people could protect get booster really necessary way. slowly looking like companies milking government. disagree saying endemic disease going around months dealing supply chain breakdown, exhausted populace, winter along winter holidays, climate change worsening everything along line.  
You seem giving hope adjusting reality. Endemic.  you‚Äôre crying doesn‚Äôt make sense disagree. Boosters increase antibodies 10x much 40x. rate decay fairly modest (remains seen), may need another booster while. least, silly assume we'll need another one 6 months.  get Moderna? curious also knocked ass day I‚Äôm putting third one bit Remember finding already plan distribute, masks even purchased send Americans, killed Trump silenced existence said program? Probably fewer audience lives there......   told need masks PPE short

We told good evidence people needed wearing masks time masks short supply healthcare workers. healthcare workers - people actually exposed virus - needed masks people might exposed virus. present evidence presented fact proceeded make whatever want.

Demonstrating connection called argument, realize enamoured theory, especially since achieves true ""most reddit thing ever""‚Äîsome butthurt American defensively explaining everyone wrong they're definitely perfect‚Äîyour account dunker think is. Let's compare China's COVID progress function population density compare America, immediate rebuttal.

88+% double dose everyone 18 year Belgium. 
The Flemmish region 92% people 12 year old. 


With Rt 1,1 see decline least 3 weeks unless took measures. 


We still assume almost kids get corona measures kids younger 10 years. moment, cdc‚Äôs website literally says fully vaccinated receiving two shots still considered ‚Äúfully vaccinated‚Äù don‚Äôt get booster Everyone still considered fully vaccinated two weeks second dose 2-shot series, Pfizer-BioNTech Moderna vaccines, two weeks single-dose vaccine, J&amp;J/Janssen vaccine.    submission automatically removed linked source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* GF got two Pfizer doses got wasted time. mild case Covid though, symtoms get better one cares Thanks.  Well Pope's words divine; God's messenger earth, chosen God 'devout catholics' trying undermine authority go him. Dogma Convenience.  Yes, would worry physically plane. say spread can't occur plane, places trip (the taxi, check-in line, security line, gate area, jetbridge, ...), airplane probably probably best air overall. Yeah I'm waiting til get one rather Pfizer. Depends vaccine, think J&amp;J found even shorter period, could mistaken. Yeah. I‚Äôm 15 got pfizered June. can‚Äôt get booster yet, really don‚Äôt want affecting I‚Äôm allowed do. 

Post vaccine exposed delta 5 times work avoided it. job, least me.  multitask worry *both*.  got 77%? shows think general tide sort changing there. Back high school didn‚Äôt say wanted engineer scientist ‚Äúsmart‚Äù kids acted like loser despite fact could barely write 5 paragraphs crumbled speaking front audience. Thank going detail making much easier understand previously read. looks like possible extremely good news, Delta, possible variants. remaining wish see world vaccinated, also third shot appropriate time. special kind stupid pay ‚Ç¨400 fake vaccine passport could gotten actual vaccine free vaccine passport ‚Ç¨2. Brazil 77% population least one dose, 74%. Spain 81% far off. makes sense balance concerns enough data opportunity cost inaction.

That's did.... short: nobody knows. may even replicable may nothing culture there. actually, conditions react even worse Covid, anyone conditions masked staying home.  concern lowest dose, Pfizer (all) 30ug. Moderna 100ug 50ug booster.

Both mRNA vaccines appear excellent boosters. big deal one choose. Bye, enjoy lack critical thinking skills I've heard 90% people 18 currently qualify booster shot, long 6 months past 2nd shot. want booster shot, likely already qualify easily get one, places check make sure 6 months since previous dose. Seriously NEVER gonna get COVID pandemic. can't even get 70% vaccinated, need people get even shots? 

&amp;#x200B;

Like ffs... Yikes. need many federal overhauls. Somethings gotta give  true. people hierarchy priorities consideration previous one met. Fight flight strong emotional needs logic reason. think I'm gonna kill you, worry bit sad. sad care logic behind situation till sadness addressed least sufficiently acknowledged. Humans (too?) complicated   Everyone choice

No.

If personal health, it'd bit different, want play game civilization, part keep harming people choices.

To get benefits living civilization, follow rules place protect *everyone*. want to? Go live wilderness somewhere stop spreading germs civilized people.   mean, call conspiracy want, study study shown waning immunity heavily reduced antibody levels around 6-month mark. Pushing boosters absolutely right judgment call alternative deadly prolonged Delta-fueled outbreak throughout holidays.

The good news need boosters 6 months may byproduct initial 3/4-week gap first two doses short. may find third dose lasts much longer, due given much longer time first two.   reason given, inferred live ""deprived areas""? fair statement? final ""most reddit move ever""‚Äîchange topic. Bye. used same. learned lesson I'm process obtaining liberal arts degree. graph reinforces discussing someone today. Right need boosters every three four months instead every six months.  makes think haven‚Äôt transparent?    nothing political comment. yet, somehow enough made difference, mattered (timeline critical masking) keep mortality rates far lower than...the US Canada, UK EU instance...the whole world really.

Maybe little respect others there, especially elders greatest risk.   Omg want award?  CEO says effectiveness drops 84% 6 months] Because, like person replied to, many people America disregard liberal arts bullshit unworthy talked conversation almighty STEM disciplines.  Close 9 billion dose administered.
Not single fucking zombie. Well it‚Äôs going change yearly eventually like flu shot Without huge subset population sudden change heart, couldn‚Äôt possibly approach 10k spring. difficult concept

Like concept 100% can't seem grasp?"
