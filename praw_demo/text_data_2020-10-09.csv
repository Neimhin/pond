0,2020-10-09," dementors? longest lockdown planet. months ago people lauding Argentina's response sub WTF Trump White House doing? hot zone virus still won’t wear masks. They’ll never learn fuck sakes! fear we’ll never get might wait least ten years new album point.

edit: Sorry. I'm bit drunk feeling clever, realized every comment making joke. curious New Zealand approached virus googled around

* [This article mentions two salient points: 1) set robust system managed isolation quarantine facilities hotels around island 2) implemented aggressive contact tracing program
* Here's [fun NYT Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, facing re-election, called country’s reopening validation “go hard, go early” response.
* Coincidentally, ""go hard, go early"" high school nickname


Pretty wild simple (not denigrate amount hard work NZ folks put this) approach was, fucked  are, unfortunately.. keep employees safe. get it.. sucks, get it.

These companies allow employees confront shoplifters really, liability.

Reading irate people get told wear mask, dont blame companies softly enforcing it.. want dead employee masks want lawsuit. Seriously, I'm dying get back office WFH next summer... 1-2 days/week WFH nice full time sucks Watching helmless bikers US makes think obvious guys socialized healthcare. can't legal society chip pay smash pavement without helmet. dumbass told people masks effective? right time overcharge shocks people like ones say “oh it’s taking shoes off, it’s greater good.” 

Once power place, it’s hard roll back. fact federal, state governments power pick choose stays closed open terrifying yet asking more.  problem too. easy jump 9PM kids go bed answer emails whatever. get 6AM read reports eat breakfast, like I'm reading morning news something. 

I definitely take lots random breaks, though. Like picking kids school, mowing lawn, grocery shopping day.

My working hours definitely blurry days. thought article bullshit. Also Johnson Johnson vaccine require deep freeze. go problematic one? able access presidential medical treatment own. Sorry foreigner asking true...interesting headlines keep comparing 7+ months covid impacts ~12 weeks flu season. covid season end? What’s Barrington Declaration? read sub haven’t heard it. people say USA bad Rona lmao  joined sub worldwide number confirmed cases less 200k... generally fan laws need legal wall prohibits political input public health matters. cannot ever happen again. Biden progressive enough /s  half month, maybe 3.5 weeks. November-January respiratory illness season.

Get control yourself. Probably first couple months. March/April, things going back normal. vaccine without one. Christ, wonder Pence tell pests Obama scared eat poison, happily eat poison. obviously greenscreen. Wrong. need shutdown people foolish...during pandemic. ""muh freedoms"" all. I'll one that! always everything dies period! can't said, there's enough data. think Covid going kill whole species? think truth probably gave number them, they're careless multiple people contributing spreading it. Apparently ""science know"" - although one theory relates proven mechanism binding protein viruses actually changes response temperature. throat cools little breathing cool air, virus infects much aggressively.

It's one theory.

There clearly seasonal affect many viruses. Nice. 

I’d like think it’s little “light end of...” metaphor. 47% exactly 470% effective 0%. anti-mask crowd think fine. actually:

Cheeses chew 
Duck - gristle 
Some tea pour 
and pass scone. US really saved huge farm areas separating densely populated cities, particularly East West. small European countries luxary.

Building construction also different. Lots Europe among places fairly old buildings poor ventilation need sealed winter stay warm. Kellyann Conway daughter, Claudia. Yeah, believe [Claudia] put TikTok saying tested positive world highest positive rate Argentina, around 70%. test 20-10 thousand people, 4 october tested 9 thousand. Right?! another one Saturday, like wtf?? vitamin C content apple *way less* orange bandannas don’t work now, couldn’t worked back then, yet still fine. virus isn’t bad say. isn’t hard. Maybe want ill. Weird thought, it? Wow, imagine wanting catch novel virus that's well understood completely possible avoid happening. White house turns domestic terrorist organization really quick. Sauce? thing Trump testing negative. Certainly sounds like need protect elderly more...I’m sure everyone els staying home go Kroger’s best approach sarcastic.

Oh? fucking dick. 100k people dead let's get TV make jokes it.

Sorry. directed person pretending like run country. children don’t get super sick virus don’t appear super spreaders according studies done within last six months, would smart vaccinate people around (adults) since high risk worse outcomes. great country. Hugely wrecked years.

RIP hermanos. happen, doctor told ""allergic sinusitis"" allergies express way similar cold. came realize since neverending cold March - April matter medicine took nothing helped 2 weeks then. took something allergies third day fine . (Sorry name sound right, English first language I'm literal translation) far, odds re-infection 

You zero basis say this. enough evidence. simply know possible, firstly, given coronaviruses immunology one, we'd almost expect it. Thanks :thumbsup: .03....bone chilling odds plenty threads France rising numbers. people seem ignore them. Agreed. would really complete ensemble. year two ago would hard believe people would refuse get tested. Now, people huge amounts power influence openly refuse get tested, people like certain senator South Carolina. Even president clear stance testing. case, believable people across country would follow lead, predictable. antiscience fanatics getting people killed. reason. general....I'm guessing around time next year

What basing on? crazy many people coming woodwork COVIDlike symptoms testing. Like [Lindsey Graham bowing wonder we'll see coming news next weeks, either via positive tests worst possible conclusion since seem want hiding test results wonder Argentina's deaths per capita skyrocketed. may actually pass Brazil metric weeks. exactly would 90% normal entail? realize Europe country right? nation politics regulations enforced. put way makes sound Europe like US, run single government, FYI isn’t truth. show 'em who's really charge. smoker idiot seatbelt needs medical care cancer/COPD insurance death benefits, everyone else subsidize care risks easily reducible. Hey pal, want say I'm American see you. Im sorry governments suck much, nice connect real people. 

Stay safe. Cases death skyrocketing US south summer probably military member. WH get block important directions like this???? Yes, trump wasn’t willing virtual debate, instead going rally . 
Incredible Lmao 60% positivity rate?!?!?

And thought Mexico's testing joke. wait countries correlate vaccine effectiveness. China known sell lousy PPE testing kits, hope low they'd better vaccine. probably a) figure private he's private citizen 2) want end Herman Cain situation ""everything fine"" announce passed away. reading second debate cancelled. least sense prevails outside White House. mind that, actually. helps prevent future pandemics, not? Didn’t Putin claim cure already? even gave kids... Wonder they’re doing. Fauci ain't guy encouraged people take cruises April, encouraged people hook-up height epidemic? Oh, os back Mar Lago? diphsit chief un white house one little pleasure outings? Oh look, new kind arms race Exactly. cases reinfections. virus combination election violence, yea I’m going least two months worth supplies thought *was* France surrender joke. guess he/she means lockdowns going reach herd immunity. also, pay price that... Two top stage three vaccine candidates allegedly seen good immune response older adults (I believe 65+ age group). 

So statement, “The vulnerable also least likely actually make decent immune response vaccine.” likely true least two top candidates. Also, we’ve never vaccine virus speak can’t like it’s factual? Plenty go around!  India 73k today.... agree, trump Better 1% like month ago. 1% one person, me. first coronavirus test made available, extremely faulty blocked CDC US?

It's impossible prove. People can't say definitively January way guy can't say nobody COVID October '19. America state in. everyone thinks like you, oh risky, multiply 300 million Definitely wait week. Typhoid Donny isn’t done yet. totally. I've slowly summer. evidence herd immunity anywhere moment agree masks utilitarian fact people comprising East Asian states (as international actors) recognized benefits mask-wearing ahead global peers. However, hope feel I'm speaking respectfully suggest norms universal; may true billion people observe norm *X* (e.g. circumcision), though would discount groups follow opposing norm *!X / Y*, groups said concept yet reach critical mass public opinion.

That said, I'm sure identify particular state(s)  significant resistance wearing. simply sharing, green trashbin-dwelling eccentric, identified out-of-left-field benefits masks finally normalized Wastelands formerly known United States America. least agree Trump well unfit lead talking about? get virus people social distanced like get virus. people wore bandanas exposed store clerks, many get it. 

Not people get it. people die. making starting point. Covid war. Wars chain command lone wolf antics. time silly free, time work survival. latter. China created virus destroy rest worlds economy knowing would able control spread nazi like country *""At point, Richter said, limited eye problems seen COVID-19: small number patients develop conjunctivitis (""pink eye"")""* false equivalency? It’s little precautionary piece fabric face. It’s far trivial others. Well, CDC tried right thing, blocked WH That’s point, though. There’s thing normal, boring president. misconception politics boring kind ignore right guy office exactly got sorry state first place. Yes, they're STD capital Florida least. Offset lost productivity Trigun cosplay? Haha sorry guys, realanceps thinks nonsense, we’re done for. Vaccine canceled live like forever Hahaha.

Its over?

New cases reported daily superspreader event.

Even Chris Christie still hospital elaborate that? civilization chose taking care people profiteering upper one percent. Thats Contagion came 2011 Bad faith argument predicated false equivalency.

If want stretch relevant examples also talk TSA inconveniencing everybody, abusing many, saving zero lives. talk Border Patrol detaining citizens 100 miles away border. talk Patriot Act NSA phone/email records. 

If family high-risk group, wear N95. Stop falling back fear grant government power know goddamn well abuse rest life. Heavens, no. modern way life? could happen. China also welded asshats inside. Damn, assume something lie doesn’t go way thinking? wish I’d known sooner...I would many reddit arguments family member die time, funeral home director said deaths higher since October, knew something happening. misremembered ""financial"", state support via ventilators boy, son ste haze, gone Holy fuck that's exactly  Democrats promoted masks science. yahoo.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* early spread NY/NJ happened late February early March legit winter (same temperature Wuhan January) course happened places COMPLETELY unprepared masks, restrictions, social distancing. don’t think it’s fair comparison.  whom?  I'd prefer people stay home they're sick wear mask tbh. get sometimes they'd rather go gym must work can't afford take days off, guess ok wear mask.  went NZ coronavirus NZ didn’t it.. NZ problem that. talks responsibility. would likely able vaccinate every willing person mid-spring

nonsense Sad Western cultures prioritize money lives. They'd rather throw grandmas bus wallets tad fatter.  Idk we’ve kinda decided already requardless think it’s thought going impact large democratic leaning cities? Yo call Canada like that, think he's decline =_= old enough die passing breeze. Getting COVID mortality living random year mid-50s, ramps quickly there.  NZ urban US. population 86% urban Auckland, largest city 1/3 population densely populated US city. WHY?! guy record threatening second pandemic live tv ""people listen to""? record stance depopulate world? run Coronavirus simulation event mere 2 months spread happened real deal...? anyone answer questions - genuine. Welcome pre-flu season y'all! ""How would Biden handle virus differently?""

This shit right here, something I'd surprised hear do. Better treatment exists now, death rates lower. 

However 

That go far hospitals reach full capacity again. whole point locking prevent overwhelming hospitals, death rate climbs hospital resources spread thin. 

Locking obviously practical stage, consider scaling back capacity reimplementing social distancing / masks. situation getting worse country, well rest planet, pretending irresponsible wrong. ~~most~~ right people

FTFY. base wants ""stupid, liberal, big-city"" people suffer, that's axis stupid. Hello stranger. happily mail bag delicious ketchup chips would like! politics pool corruption &amp; good people drawn terrible work. came NZ coronavirus NZ didn’t it. he’s talking responsibility? Richard Branson? Whats prize spotting you? DM I'll send address. Spanish, mean Kansas flu? can't go school. can't see friends. can't go exercise according pre-pandemic regimen. can't travel easily visit others flight and/or immigration restrictions. can't go favourite restaurants stores (because closed). see continuing indefinitely constantly get conflicting information, along many others given up. words “fuck poor let rich function” us fortunate enough option WFH, news important!

We know influential companies are, you’d like believe others copy approach give employees option.

This would amazing could finally take advantage living smaller town city/town UK, pay less travel fees save bunch money!!!! I’m happy hear news :) People eat animals protein. population density rises, people become less choosy eat sorts animals critters.

This challenge countries like US (or Argentina!) never deal with. Seriously...STILL? Could new strain spreads faster, read U.S. strain virulent. Big yikes Grain salt.... 

A local doctor Georgia mentioned something interesting recently. summer, people milder climates tend stay outside more. IE, South. tend stay indoors AC blasting whenever can. fact along weak lockdowns people giving crap led high Covid cases. 

Come fall winter, many us South like go outside without immediately melting puddle sweat. doesn’t get cold (at least long periods) can’t go enjoy outdoors, would think leads less spread Covid. 

States gets really cold snowy, people tend stay indoors more. doctor predicting states haven’t seen major spikes like South may experience fall winter, South may actually trend down. 

Something consider. Deaths pneumonia testing. discount scientific studies go currently believe? realize science single narrative right? fact, whole point scientific method opposite doing. duty live life fullest can. Frankly, care you; heck, even care peers acquaintances.

Wear mask, stay six feet away live lives according beliefs. I'm completely fine that. Cheers. see much traffic road day vulnerable boomers. idiots going. Get groceries every 2 weeks. going saying control market conditions supposed ground outbreak controlled much scientifically possible? 

You correct, impossible predict even guarantee pandemic occurring, one totally preventable. conditions fostered it’s initial spread totally preventable. 

That irony pulled title... ‘after fact’ success. want people die think people take public transportation poor. talking one wealthiest countries world, yet still needs capitalize pandemic expense (in words, life) lower middle class citizens.... freedom, guess?

Unfortunately, US (many) price controls place, pharmaceutical companies charge much get away here. sell identical drugs countries fractions price, people okay ... hell knows why? medical system broken EVERYONE agrees that, problem one agrees fix it. 

Democrats want make European expand access everyone regardless ability pay, Republicans want remove regulations make ""free market"". two major parties basically split country evenly two result enough power either side actually fix anything, constant power struggle back forth little important issues actually addressed. US well truly broken. I’m fascinated see members US political parties 180s views virus if/when new President takes office. comment proof brainwashed psychologically tortured. It’s already decade?! Oh man. Software dev large project that's long term. Felt like team sort frozen several months. Hard gain personally observing others, friendships grow. Getting two new people next week, think they'll ever fit what's otherwhys great team.

Short term remote great, long term interesting see happens. Holy fuck played like 8 years now. lost game. Think dude treated Anita Hill like trash let Repulicans push around throughout hands. 

He also creeps little girls CAMERA. 

I still want win, heartbroken candidate...even worse announced VP, still better 4 years. That's bad things are, I'm voting 2 people truly dislike &amp; would never considered except they're sane choice. Whoever gave, allowed orders needs put tried imprisoned murdering Americans.  Richard 70 years old. lucky many guests island acting warning beacons.

I picture rigging everyone sensors like Aliens, monitor vitals. ""Vince Vaughn Winslet's vitals spiking, fire coming south end island! Evac north helipad!"" Wow boom yet another acount 1 year like rest spreading b.s. that’s 1/2%. rate US 2%. bad relative places. rest year gonna shit whether like not. Either Trump wins go rabbit hole, Biden wins three months Trump destroys country leave. I’m really looking forward three months. I’m waiting coronavirus zero Center Disease Contracting

Also, OVAL Office

One Violent Assole Lying place highest STD rates country? Nov 3rd talking fact US data currently reporting approx 220k deaths 250k yet... might it. slow burn virus. Sometimes feels like may literally never end. might reading headlines even 3-4 years “place records infections last four months” whatever. Eventually try different things. Maybe 2 years enough enough big lockdown real lockdown like Wuhan style military vehicles patrolling streets national guard enforcing curfew metros. like year 4 4 actually endorse herd immunity strategy, everyone take masks pretend there’s virus. hospitalizations spike fast hard six figure death rate 1-2 months period. realize life now: live social distancing masks rest life. Eventually kids get older, it’s life they’ve ever known. us lived life “before covid” memories. Sometimes I’m afraid could actually happen. We’re two bad headlines away happening. “Coronavirus vaccines prove ineffective,” “human immunity lasts 6 months.” Why? Seriously, WTF. Why? may unconstitutional mandate think public service public place Every virus outbreak begins someone ignoring scientist. great read! Thanks sharing!  important meaningless life cant right North east second? state DOES?! Man, wish state something like that. One questions year's ballot took complete surprise, worded useless way give almost relevant information proposition would actually DO.

Thank fuck able look stuff online, geez, many people going blindly vote it... We're 24th deaths per capita. worst nothing proud either. white house causing forcing spread covid. course masks worn public transport. Face shields well Oh darn horrible thing happen upstanding nation. fix anything. Soviet Russia, virus counts you. asked go travel LA Orlando work end month. Worth risk???? Here's question think people addressing:

_Why would put effort this?_ 

Let's say Trump Administration want run around spin whatever Trump says true, _exactly_ would conflict with? 

Let's say, also, want people believe Coronavirus big deal. already Fox blaring day _and_ supporters believe anyway.

So pay attention minutiae? block specific little precautions? almost like there's concerted effort Яepublicans _kill_ many Americans can. _preventing precautions anyone_ want rally around hard? one's claiming fix everything. problem check. normalize politics. start talking stuff.

Schools need properly funded let religion dictate proper learn. Proper sex ed, open civil discussion ideas, importance scientific method.

I'm fine disagreement, fact quite enjoy it, royal cunt. ask Chinese people making assumptions. approve government grateful precautionary measures. Unlike western countries let people die preserve illusion ""democracy"". 

And stop comparing north Korea China. dishonest shows stupid are. everyone.

Mr. Bolsonaro wants word. Incorrect.

First, selective pressure virus become milder, not. asymptomatic presymptomatic spread rather prolonged incubation period illness, hard see selective pressure case COVID. note asymptomatic presymptomatic spread necessarily general feature coronaviruses, SARS-1 like all. 

Second, generally lasting immunity CCCs, reinfection norm milder previous infections. 

If OC43 caused 1890 event, purely speculative moment, became milder, would mutations virus, build herd immunity. New improved.

The ONE thing DeSantis got right locking nursing homes. I've saying since March FL end worst death toll country. Partly leadership, partly percentage population nursing homes.

THAT wave happened yet, coming. Good! *The **idiots** always exist , shirk health safety guidelines.* 

^But feel didnt choose risk themselves, collateral damage. us : cognitive dissonance alive ( long) oooohhh....murica Poor people, minorities, liberals large cities ride public transportation. 

Deliberate attack whitehouse. 
I hope succumbs virus. dumb - like parsing damage fire, damaged firemen putting fire. fire damage. 

When cancer patients die, try analyze many deaths loneliness depression cancer may caused. 2020’s wild ride! Maybe poor/developing nations like Peru Chile. highly doubt first-world country going hit herd immunity vaccine arrives. Population density ingress controls. countries islands easier test/quarantine everyone coming in.

I thought Aus implemented masks Sydney/Melbourne public transport seems really need it. Probably France. Good I'm bus expect utter chaos. people respectful orderly officially lost America know trump wanted liberate Minnesota Michigan? It’s almost like CDC Director health experts weren’t bluffing talked terrified going Fall season proper steps weren’t taken seriously. people take serious there? French president Macron up. focuses Middle East Africa turkey run away mess home

This pandemic needs leader keep fighting daily, coward spending crazy amounts fitting new office palace denying French people resources presidency instead going Lebanon meet unknown singer house give medal

He’s acting like dictator like president

This guy needs replaced destroys France  look numbers Villages. least 700 infected populated, old community right now.  I'm actually surprised taken long. Florida living la vida corona months now. Well Spain stromgest lockdown europe, dropped daily cases 200-300 (7 days average) summer and, several 0 death days, also 10-20 dropped time time.

Average 7 days deaths around 2-4 would expected 200-300 cases 7 days average. Momo shows anything strange days.

Sounds fine. believe summer data wrong.

Actually mentioned Spain first country reporting increase cases (early july) deaths (early augost). government faking would extended it. 5.56mm, size ammo m4/m16 Trump cult think wearing mask political statement. they've always anti-science gang. You’re totally right, people probably don’t even know bodies. definitely would know better say feel fine must head. live third-world country dictatorship definitely bad comes pandemic. Penalize Titans. ‘Those rookie numbers’ -Trump  It’s gonna Black Christmas family tragedies struggles following Thanksgiving year. White House needs go virtual too.. wins blame on? Wish lived Canada love people claim others best interests heart actively push away incivility. 

Really winning hearts minds battle here, chief. federal government enforce mask mandates? think use military this? ""quite few"" reinfections. There's like single-digit count confirmed reinfections across entire planet. like 35 million people die. That's quite few. shoulda waited months he'd getting paid live I’m surprised. see this, bigots constantly bashing China Reddit? fault. give ""We oppose government, people"" nonsense. China's government people China decide, bored racists Reddit. Leave nations alone mind business. Wow that’s actually kinda crazy. intentionally obnoxious, wasn’t aware actual flu numbers. Idaho? never vaccine? What’s five five six...?
Some term douche nuggets use ? Trump administration utterly useless preventing spread covid, states step it. competent administration (not Trump cronies), states enforce safety precautions. Even federal states Canada Germany, provincial state governments need act functional national governments. It’s already Villages. May God mercy souls. need spare mercy whatever qualifies “soul” DeathSantis. goes career. WHy? Literally why? Again! lasting immunity CCCs

Coronaviruses indeed flu could probably fudge numbers make anything rest world dispute research. data that? missed seeing anything regarding immunity think weather people parties, right? least agree it’s blend many factors, two significant contributors, yeah?

To point, really wonder much quarantine fatigue, ignorance, politically motivated rebellion. Quarantine fatigue definitely plausible explanation current spike we’re seeing US.  conservatives screaming Walz terrible job. Holy shit Murica. could’ve help rest world beat C19 using brain choosing less shittier leadership. [is] pretty well guaranteed catch 4 seasonal coronaviruses point life good immune response catch older.

I wonder someone catch seasonal coronavirus younger would much dangerous caught later on? We're getting wild ride January. matter wins election rest year going fucking depressing Americans. Trump ain't yet. it’s article journalist who’s speculating? Oh look, State every State surrounding State made list. country know would tweeting it. love mean indian style cow urine, think. one thing pisses much Republicans GOP. amount hypocrisy. total trampling good faith. ever trust conservative leadership, would whole new party. matter think leftist all. Nothing says leftist me, would call radically leftist. boogeyman shit conservative spaces cry about, like actual communist. Neither leftist bone bodies me. look headline.  ever left alone.

I think fine. think might necessary. one people attitude of, ""politics, leave alone, I'll leave alone"". minority though, I've watching increasing concern direction country taking, policies, well President's statements, made realize sooner later, stuff affect me. 

You know, sometime months ago, maybe late last year maybe last summer even, started say phrase, ""and vote like life depends it. does."" felt comfortable speaking politics with. bit stunned start hearing random places. think heard Jon Oliver say that, Michelle Obama definitely says twice. 

I think leave politicians alone, ever. Even they're people, watching closely neutral eyes. anything, last four years total destruction good faith social contract me. people, politicians, put position power authority. ever cease part us, people, people need work removing them. No, think ever leave alone again. History shown us happens. Older people japan wear masks pretty regularly.

Older Americans could start.

&amp;#x200B;

Haha, kidding?! think confidence beats coronavirus. dimwits, nationally. Indoor gatherings cause, there's really doubt that. think temperature driving people inside. think people parties, going restaurants, bars, indoor leagues, etc. Stuff happens year round matter weather. He’s always signing something meeting leader”. 

lol, really. hell watching comes news? Even FOX News showing moron signing meeting anyone lately. Nice ngl use Covid-69 disease name Plague Inc. days... always Moscow St Petersburg people money travel. However, comparable city would look something like NYC.

The border China closed early big cities thought Alps early year concentrations Ischgl St Anton. Public transport big city problem spreading. One thing LA going poor public transport. big cities Soviet Union got metro system disadvantage times.

The thing know someone recovered Tomsk long way Moscow/St Petersburg. lower rates outside European part Russia due lower population density fewer people travelling. Unfortunately, now. ""Not wearing"" ""not wearing""? failed lawsuits Australia constitutional infringment demonstrated. People making claim make so. people wealthy enough homes fire suppression systems.

Either Richard Branson fire suppressant system island 2011, effective. main house totaled.. Florida opened restaurants bars 100% capacity two weeks ago really noticeable increase cases everyone expecting. imply forcing restaurants bars close negligible effects mitigating spread?  Poland also going road. logic / states impose mask mandates shut businesses down? PC Problem is, controls could made preventable learned least 2003. controls put place time, didn’t remain place.

To say taking reactive approach compared proactive approach sure way keep world safe, would perception right?

Preventive measures going noticeable doesn’t happen, knows preventive measures work? happen, it’s easy put weight reactive measures.

Had lessons learned changes made 2003, likely others, would still argue wouldn’t mess... I've heard people say kids get fatigued They’ll paradise probably decades. next disaster form rising sea levels gonna submerge small islands Please keep mind right due covid, social lives taken hit. 

But imagine, getting commute hours back spend however want .

I went full remote 2 years ago much happier life. 45-60 minute commute morning night. 

Now get sleep morning, evenings, use extra time go gym, due covid closed right unfortunately. 

I’ve started cook meals home, saving money process, less money spent gas wear tear car, hundreds benefits. 

My requirements future job full time remote. don’t ever want waste almost 2 hours day sitting traffic. Looks like y’all lucky, data fact transparent. also haven’t even gone whole year virus, I’m sure, Texas, I’m like 99% one flocking indoors SC March thing took off. 

Either way, I’m buzzed/tired look data rn, were:

Early spikes north east cold. (NY,NJ,Connecticut)

Summer spikes Florida/cali/Arizona/Texas hot.

And now, honestly, don’t really explanation current spike except maybe cold weather midwest/saturation virus population.


Like said above, know you’re troll I’ve seen months. think you’re willfully ignorant trends talking thread. disagree indoor gatherings cause outbreaks, maybe SC elsewhere, explanations might look towards explain trends we’ve seen point pandemic? I’m actually curious/willing consider another point view since none us experienced bullshit before. bet people feeling little silly saying “Americans idiots, Europe got control” eh? Exactly. Everything political. 

Laws/Politicians difference living dying. 

It's simple that. Containment. F0 positive. F1 contact F0. F2 contact F1. F3 F2. F4 contact F3. F1-F4 quarantined home facility. Also household memers F1-F4. Quarantined people provisioned supervised military. F1-F4 found area locked military. Also closed school opened masks distancing.

They didnt fuck around saved economy trying curb virus response save economy. ""The Oct. 4 report Idaho appears first time task force explicitly recommended closing schools: “Recommend change online K-12 classes counties metro areas elevated test positivity incidence among schoolage children increasing hospital utilization,” White House advised, noting outbreaks 10 Idaho counties may related school openings. ""

Anyone know Idaho would singled school reopenings people actually praising China, even year ago everyone saw fucked were. good. fairly easy... 

It makes sense - quote 

It make sense extremely stupid : quote (that might recorded yet, quote) Jesus, even old Jersey, 42 cases, masks mandatory buses. Yeah know intention, meant impression worked way said, know actually possible tell accusing anything, I'm situation, might unfortunately adverse effects kids though. Toddlers need exposed level germs/dirt/bacteria immune systems learn fight against. need catch TB, influenza, mumps etc. need exposed everyday bacteria especially kids. forget guys, US. prizes guessing going access 1 million doses. exactly. weeks lag. small increase? 4700? That's heavy standards. WHY? get anything anymore... UK controls border, NI Ireland border matter (since would barely anyone cases crossing that)? can't done? idea. Trump praise started cue leave. It’s also pointless. Madrid’s infections went everyone came back holiday brought virus them. Tourists still come Madrid leave. want really needs done. Close bars restaurants make ppl work home again. hell wrong USA? 

Seriously, amendment gives right gun. something allowing militias take back country potential dictatorships. 

So already. watched right start pandemic wife... pissed (She didnt know "" Contagion"" means since non native speakers... told afterwards would watched did) Yes ccp must. It’s opposite progressives stand for. China ccp same. recall reading article early people debating effectiveness masks eye dr saying thought require goggles faceshields masks alone enough. around month ago Fauci days later Birx suggested people wear gog-les faceshield well mask one. Buckle y'all, ride stop end station Hell Europe currently better us... What's new? time 2nd wave done maybe achieved closer herd immunity requirement like 50%? Testing first time around wouldn’t enough make conclusions size waves Honestly Chinese hate concerning American progressive, we're seeing play Asian-American communities. No. 100 years violent ethnic tensions resolved peace process + unguardable border makes impossible. displaying complete ignorance Troubles resulting peace process alright decided let school start normally reopen businesses around time. aggressive, Doug Ford get away strict lockdowns he's Conservative. Liberal would resistance struggle it, Conservative people listen. Liebe Grüße aus Jena germany still small increase people go vacation countries around us affected hard question time goes up.

Also lot people can't even bothered wear mask distance unless forced to. Welp chance have. shitty boss accepted inconveniently 2nd day. It’s hard :( So, brexit makes impossible ireland control border, basically? right leave home right spread disease you, yeah, absolutely consider law forbids leaving home certain times fascist. AFAIK illegal sex AIDS spreading, everyone nowadays would say deserve locked IV drugs might give Hepatitis C. textbook fascism. said province Canada.

Having said Canadian approach seems fully line White House's position job federal government impose mandate rather lower levels government. looking at? Could COVID-19 trigger autoimmune disease like SLE? Really bugs it’s MacBook Pro windows Lock shit - Sincerely, Melbourne

For complaints numbers lie. Put body enough stress think get number random persistent side effects. Even common flu trigger chronic fatigue syndrome. Also take look persistent side effects many medications cause minority healthy individuals: finnasteride, ssris, isotretinoin, aromatase-inhibitors, benzos, etc.. Medical knowledge come far enough understand treat things. Unless contract, sure. normal workplace people forget it. task force official said decision require masks left states localities. administration requires task force sign coronavirus-related approach task force taken mask mandate is, response New York City different Montana, Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said official asked identified permission discuss matter. “Local state authorities need determine best approach responsive effort depending coronavirus impacting area.” related sub? He's definitely past, he's try out-hawk Trump, concerning me. Honestly, they're really two sides coin comes foreign policy.   honestly absurd. host border related issues (ethnic, legal, logistical, etc) repeatedly raised throughout Brexit process quite clearly display danger impossibility attempting shut Ireland - NI border .

Attempting cause serious damage peace process within NI without actually restricting movement great degree cause flares violence. plan, happened, republicans idiots took Anti-masker rhetoric, democrats, enough thought try protect deadly pandemic.

(Possibly also due republicans position anti protection measures, democrats almost entirely favour less people dying) job gave us extra $2.00/hr month half maybe two months. Arguably, needed then. worked home 13 years. needed change jobs 2019 companies seemed hating WFH go office. COVID I've back home. I've seen all, let share thoughts.

It basically comes four things.

First distractions. 

For part, ignore avoid distractions home. Tell friends family bother you, shut pets home office, sit focus work. can't control distractions office. I've always got people coming want help work take away work. I've got people coming want talk. can't go pee grab cup coffee 1 minute, end conversations people waste even time. etc etc. 

Second happiness.

Happy employees focused work harder. Working home makes many employees happier lots different reasons.  some, commute. wake early put work clothes. ability go outside work patio nice days, cigar desk work. Whatever reason, many employees happier working home.

Third better collaboration options. 

Being new guy company, I'm trying learn whole lot stuff whole lot people. kinda harder office reasons. tools like teams, zoom, webex, etc etc see others doing, guide processes, etc etc. person, typically ends couple guys crowded around PC one guy all. Combine less distractions (more guys equals people trying distract them) better.

Fourth, better/more comfortable equipment.

At home private office. private office window open get fresh air nice days. control lights temperature liking. I've got coffee machine exact coffee like. I've got mini fridge filled soda like. I've got water cooler spring water (which tastes thousand times better filtered water). 

I've also got amazing Lazy-Boy computer chair. huge oversized L shaped desk. I've got computer i9 processor, 64GB RAM super fast NVME hard drives. I've got 6 32 inch monitors hooked PC. I've got amazing mechanical keyboard wonderful track ball. desk also adjusts sitting standing want stretch legs. 

At work, sit cheap office chair cramped cubical using 2 20 inch monitors cheapo keyboard mouse. office lights hella bright (I'm one complains it) building always either hot cold. laptop give work low end core i5 8gm ram cheapest slowest ssd planet. 

I'm less comfortable office, I'm using worse equipment. example, something compile home machine 1-2 minutes might take 10-15 work issues computer. Germany much better. Risk social, individual risks precautions negligible impact social risks precautions (the sum individual actions) measurable.


One person wearing mask change personal risk profile significantly. However, everyone wearing mask risk profile markedly different. ??? Pile crackhead shit progressive functional current government not? I'm really embarrassed reading story. feel like broken record every time whenever Trump administration messing us like this.

 well trajectory 10 million infected cases dead Americans. deaths preventable people would cooperate follow safety precautions. want bear witness people close suffering even dying COVID-19. I'm frustrated hear stories kids family members died alone, left alone, and/or suffered alone pandemic. Trump administration needs stop putting people despair like this.  goes far beyond tech, *corporate jobs 👎 Junk study seen before. stated comments

* Dosage given late game
* high dose. 3x higher normal
* ZINC?! Again?

The ingredients almost always get left studies shown effective countries are:

* Time - Given early soon suspect positive Covid patient. symptoms even.
* ZINC - vital role play aids hydroxycloroquine cells

""Evidence clear: shitty study gives shitty results!"" knew?! place Trump golf cart parades old white men chanting “White Power”. Thoughts prayers. exactly reason WH task force stopped CDC issuing mask requirement public transport. Nearly everything covid US political know politics avoided per rule sub. Already got kicked sub 'politics'. Spain mask mandate moment leave house. worst country EU infections. help also ban activities worn. Like indoor eating restaurants weddings. pernicious Nabarro's misleading claims notion open economy benefit poor.

The poor dying. yeah, totally benefit reopen everything

And yet many poor indeed believe that...

I built rage inside refuses subside months now, due successfully spun ""Those detached reality public health experts want take away job mild flu nothingburger. Blame them"". many ordinary people fully bought message. 

When reality exactly opposite -- corporate oligarchy refuses done eliminate virus means making unacceptable even temporary basis concessions:

1. need lockdown hard.

2. means profits cease while, importantly, means need give people helicopter money starve

3. importantly, need cancel debts, can't pay without job

4. also need place corporations direct governmental control productive capacity directed towards dealing crisis rather extorting everyone susceptible extortion maximum profits

5. need free testing, healthcare paid sick leave infected sick people walking going work, spreading virus around them

None way accetable even temporary basis -- directly threatens foundations neoliberal order last 40+ years. 

The death millions price perfectly willing pay. poor people old people dying. old people dying benefit -- reduces expenses pensions healthcare, means money available funnel pockets rich. 

And crystal clear everyone eyes see

Yet average person somehow got tricked thinking solving health crisis interest... totally legit list medishional practishonas scienticians.

*signed* *Dominic Cummings, Durham Univercity* Ref:

Extrafollicular B cell responses correlate neutralizing antibodies morbidity complacency free healthcare, I'm guessing here. talking point shifted ""but look low death rate!"" what, ask? forefront medical expertise 1. downplay sickness, 2. yet unclear long term issues? wear masks follow protocols. keeps testing every weeks keep us check behalf us. would shame family. There's nothing cute innocent spreaders. thats wrong dont wanna right. Verbally violent, then.

I missed opportunity Virulent BIG

CHICKEN

DINNER Humans stupid. understand every single disaster movie million times better. really act self interest. Vote fucks out!!! Winter coming makes covid much harder control. actually panned end? impression (not US) happened, guess nobody directly tracking voting intentions everyone who's died combo.

Wear mask. Maintain distance. spend tons time indoors.

You basically indoor space that's crowded. Even mask. Even six feet away other. That's awhile. 

Cloth masks great quick endeavors public spaces. Grocery store trips.

It blows mind people fundamentally understand this. LOL

China done far better job isolating people containing virus US done. 

That bottom line, Trump screwed up.

Plus, US population seems generally like following rules thinks always ulterior motive / conspiracy theory involved.

Remember, think average dumb redneck know 50% dumber average. need commute work anymore move larger property costs different area. It’s happening now. friend works scientific adviser UK gov told never going back office. Moving north England now. salary 1/2 cost living. Plus commutes. Interested see accuracy is. Anything 80% pretty much useless imo probably lead infections, less. thing everyone worried Biden soft China. tell worry actually bit worried myself. would depend regard want compare them? terms shutting borders probably give shit poor people die. Well, hopefully make first step November. Biden will, change everything, certainly better job. measure mandatory far, citizens stop following them. Also risk individual, saying individual risk makes sound dystopian. December 31, 2020. Millions watching TV, waiting ball drop. count final minute date changes January 1, 2021. Everyone cheers, hoping next 365 days going better.


It's February 15, 2021. Cases COVID-19 still high, new virus spreading last weeks. longer incubation period COVID-19. one knows sure, little data have, seems significantly higher death rate COVID-19. People still consider hoax, ignoring every guideline set COVID-19, anything precautions recommended new virus. hope people new year better diminished, replaced feeling emptiness.


You get dressed, put mask eye protection, head work, giving wave elderly neighbor pass house. gonna long decade. thought remembered dire predictions Florida months ago, possibly Disney opening back up. dozens ways encourage mandate use masks kinds situations. article one specific example - feds certainly mandate masks airports airplanes banned smoking, weapons, liquids, electronics takeoff.

PPP loans grants could required conditions loan forgiveness.

OSHA could put workplace safety standards tomorrow.

Stimulus checks people could replaced monthly payments using contact tracing apps.

The government could require masks part federal contracts places federal employment.

The government could sent masks every household planned months ago.

The government could tie state aid adoption enforcement.

The government could put consistent public service announcements lead example.

So yeah feds can’t mandate people wear masks homes walking street, dozens things do. remember going office collect plants told us could work home, everyone officially sent home, something like second weekend March. wearing jeans t-shirt.

The last several winters NYC barely seen snow. Yes. Poorest richest time. It’s sad. I’ve lived America soon. really right track. Hopefully get back guess is: professional toured 25 years.. likely done countless shows 100% healthy well. likely pushed got shows done Check Egypt study well (Zagazig Univ) even compelling since directly addresses home transmission (7.4pct family members got covid19-like symptoms vs 58pct non-intervention follows steps earlier studies Bangladesh Peru.

And earliest study sparked - Univ Monash, Australia study - vitro study.

In addition molecular docking studies short-listed ivermectin candidate dual use drug (ie already approved another condition benefit new disease).  due lack testing.

Some Estimations said 100k per day peak. Alex get's reposted times year reason either us know him, original another repost. told understand keep flailing around lost. Animals may words comprehend every animal communicates ways. one track mind took insult personally needed white knight animals since life deserves zero respect. Soon goalposts shifted 2030 mark words Reckless endangerment? Please elaborate. I'm gonna say fake, must fake, quite tinge insanity it. difficult sane people imitate insanity. Like, obviously insane statement, give special ??? feeling Really sounds like wizard oz compare Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, South Korea Ireland? COVID fatigue reflects voluntary self protection measures.


All need mandatory measures. pandemic, thing individual risk. Risk social collective. - especially knowing people community especially defiant kind precautions...  rule thumb modern nation states would categorize strengths decreasing order as: 

\+ cultural

\+ economic

Military force projects fast long distances. Economic force projects slower, shorter distances, requires longer period produce effects. Political between.

This polities classified. leave Madrid city fly Germany nothing stop me. It’s crazy. credible statistical evidence, backed scientists reliable journal, please shut fuck up. Yes  🎵 ""Imagine the... *cough*... PEOPLE!"" 🎵 sky blue aside time wasn't.... kind shit happens government doesn’t ‘believe’ science.  Slovakia too, jumped 880 cases 1887 per day 4 days. refusal, lack resources. co-workers friend paid $1,250 get tested, may get tested second time road. much ""old normal Christmas"", guess. distancing, masks, blah blah blah.

See? supposed listen *scientists*, *politicians*! politicians *never* know much pandemic virus scientists do. 

And make *really* unrealistic chimerical promises keep morale compliance public high, ""15 days stop spread"", ""next year better"", ""we return normal (whatever date)"" (in case, Christmas). scientists long agreed upon accepted *fact* no, *will* take much longer two weeks; yes, things *will* still end getting cancelled 2021 well (Coachella, BlizzCon, Broadway, name it); *no*, *not* returning ""old normal"".

OCS put best, emphasizing even vaccine *seems* over, *not* ""going back brunch"" pretending COVID-19 eradicated. be. Russia saw highest single-day spike yesterday, even *with* vaccine EUA.

If politicians primary source COVID-19 information, *seriously* recommend find *more qualified* experts listen to. *almost definitely* going shift goalposts. course will; they're *politicians*! Yes, might seem like scientists also that, least *they* forgiven, they're dealing constantly evolving novel disease pandemic situation. message might always pleasant (which partly responsible many common folk ignoring them), say tends objective, consistent, reliable, less partisan biased, politicians say. 

And so, listen *science*, *politics*. greatly ashamed self tell *the members Coronavirus sub*, people. Public humilliation! need buff more. Sweden might used tool right agree. thats Swedens fault. Thats whoever spreads misinformations fault.

Sweden one left wing (in terms distribution wealth) countries world. also perhaps left response pandemic. Yet ignored left right media. ""sweden didnt lock people go full police state citizens look everyone/nobody died"" depending narrative trying push. ***""Seriously!? 2020!?"" &lt;laugh Since Danish indeed follow Danish news Danish. follow fairly closely too. 

Could possibly dig quote two “plenty officials”? recall saying press conferences anywhere else past months. Source? understand think they're actively trying kill us? regards society economy surviving 3 years: necessity. Society economy defaults. happen. Sometimes crash still happen. 3 years tgere would still economic activity. *insane* — i’m glad mentioned it, i’ve felt kinda buts thinking one else caught too? USA, Brazil, Russia, India...



FTFY Unless walking 5 foot sidewalk someone approaches opposite direction. Yes. Less suplexing leather clad beefcakes, crying shower haul away tv. Biden supports ""peaceful fiery protests"" spread virus anything else. opinion idk understand core want say ergo idk lf comment even relevant (Sorry english skills, try improve it) Estimates pandemic ""novel corona virus"" said lucky shitshow like atm goes 3years, looks like getting faster still sure. would society Economy survive 3years? flexible often fast developing counter measures, reflecting actual situation informations have. Yes sometimes would better communicate honest like: ""we know shit idea coming atm stay 2weeks home see comes next, maybe less restrictions maybe more. really idea fly sight idea going"" would cost lot trust could lead harmfull behaviour less acceptance. Like cooking frog. Put warm water heat vs trying put boiling water. Idk lf even make sense typed...

Nvm stay safe. Yeah, knew truth they'd quick abandon ""let's like Sweden"" narrative, say truly feel ""let's let virus spread unchecked"". El Pais (English) twitter account: restrictions applied state alarm municipalities Alcobendas, Alcorcón, Fuenlabrada, Getafe, Leganés, Madrid, Móstoles, Parla Torrejón de Ardoz. Alcalá de Henares list thanks improved data"" DoDo's ? smoked pork, forget smoked pork... probably there's like two people whole train days many people money lost means can't eat, I've told infringe upon life expectancy somewhat. admission guilt. pay fines even though rounding error day's profits, would lose PR/stock/repeat citations. spending thousands team lawyers appeal cheaper. Hopefully vaccine cause gotta make sure enough potatoes cellar enough slivovitz demijohns Denmark small bump positive cases late July, stabilized went late August. bump height half-the spring cases, went go early June numbers, stayed still elevated. new increase since start September considerably larger one - reaching twice spring numbers end September. since gone down, still spring numbers. 

(I use spring numbers comparison, got note numbers countries dependent limited testing capacity, might infected tested) 

Sweden similarly Denmark small uptick August, followed drop September increasing. still passed number cases spring (when testing limited severe cases health care staff) higher peak June (when testing opened everyone even mild symptoms). 

In sense countries saw small bumps similar time decrease increase again. Difference Denmark increase much significant accompanied increase hospitalizations deaths too. Saying Sweden month two behind make sense - especially since significant increase Denmark started start September, Sweden maybe two weeks that. Denmark saw increase hospitalizations arising around 10th September maybe hit plateau last days. Deaths definitely increased since mid-September too. Sweden deaths ICU admissions low levels - ICU admissions low level since July, deaths low level since end August (they higher before). nations lockdown hard

Not sufficiently. 

A proper lock harsh prolonged necessary get cases zero.

Only China, Vietnam, NZ Australia seem get it. 

In West everyone reopened still hundreds cases, case US, tens thousands rise many nations supposed do? Keep locked crippling economy, jobs, businesses, peoples education etc hundred cases day?

They supposed eliminate virus. 

Of course, always step back things got control -- never allowed get control first place. done. Why? stopping international travel would ""hurt economy"". Well, stopping achieve exactly?

Which illustrates broader point -- combination contagiousness morbidity (and add lack lasting immunity, people still stubbornly refuse accept real possibility even though evidence right faces) cannot ""economy"". 

But let's look even broadly. Whose ""economy"" talking about? one last 50 years spent taking poor giving rich, accelerating path towards neofeudalism? benefit preserving system average say death millions price ""they"" willing pay, ""they""? Every government world basically?

There actual ""governments"" world. battle state capitalist oligarchy world long decisively latter. big reason West completely incapacitated face serious crisis -- need functioning government deal crisis, functioning government means center power competing oligarchical economic interests. latter millennia worked undermine central authority. neoliberalism struck gold -- adopted practice, also provided ideological justification resulting arrangement likes since Middle Ages (and even king supposedly nobility). always issue balancing deaths covid/ knock negative affects lockdown i.e job losses, business shutting down, increased state reliance, less cancer screening, kids going school etc. act like evil rich people trying make money kill poor people novice way look it.

How many times explained balance had?

You choice virus healthy economy choice letting virus run rampant population killing economy process. 

The reason rich blame decided interest use crisis grab control even larger share economy even shrinks, try eliminate virus, would opposite -- cede control society. really think world leaders sitting around thinking ""great, 50,000 pensions might die, wonder balancing books"", really think 10s thousands pensioners would make much difference governments books?

They thinking ""great, 50,000 pensions might die"", thinking ""Great, several million die overall life expectancy reduced 10 years"". funnel money?

By tax cuts paid slashing entitlement programs. Anyway, neighbor claims got tested Sunday &amp; got day results. Turns place got tested open M-F, hanging KNOWING pending test result neglected tell 

I feel like illegal way. Like sleeping someone without telling AIDS. Seems related poked people hypocrisy. Probably need wait awhile assess countries success level (or lack of) standard going % recovered. quick look data various countries makes clear countries widely varying standards determining recovered. example, France currrent recovery rate roughly 15%. suspect means 10s thousands cases 5-6 months ago still ""active"". Probably Fall next year Yeah weird right wing people US likes sweden once. Sweden highest taxes world choose expensive way fighting virus. Esentially paying people stay home instead much cheaper locking people using police.

Right wing people U.S thinks sweden nothing. Sweden opposite, party loudly complaining using force/police/military/punishment far right (semi-fashist) party.  Yeah well lockdown basically assured. remember stories grandpa told life times tricks used evade government reach. October best Andy People, many most, chasing self esteem succumb easily peer pressure. one group 10 wearing mask, feel like odd one. needs change top down. administration arrested tried 200,000+ counts manslaughter January? Please? Title bit misleading, article says wear mask outdoors can't physically distance.

 fairly easy physically distance outside. read fail wave like that's really clever problem it’d longer that, given possible transmission chains within large families live together. many jobs really essential. Supply chain utility disruptions really kill people. # /s ""if come together"" bloody likely! [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Clearly setup Democrats. would attribute Trump right beginning video, highly suspicious. machine keeps pumping propaganda. Honestly, someone still support governement? Everyone reddit people calling americans retarded one vaccine pneumonia, several, people certain age, sometimes recommended get 2.

Wow, what’s Maine awesome? lot responsible types live populated compared states?  long starving get virus job EU done. It’s almost like want everyone get sick. legitimately support level incompetence? ""in sick patients""

Which makes study pointless.

Doctors country stated many times, yes, saw results mild cases using HCQ. Nah, saw chance insider trade ran it. That's article talking about. watched games, see coaches pull mask right get refs face discuss call, defeats purpose wearing mask recent surge cases.

NZ PM knows thing two that. communist insurgent, wearing mask everywhere extremely convenient. appear ignorant.

NZ beaten international arrival infection via lockdown, Victoria currently locked attempt defeat infection also born international arrivals, involved curfew 5km home limit non-essential travel.

In north UK announce closing pubs restaurants, coupled 'household mixing' overnight stays away home.

These lockdown exist idiots trying open without first eradicating disease implementing working isolation arrivals backward regions. locked thing actually works - wishful thinking, lies stupidity shown failures. 

Now, clue admit ignorant reality apologise. I'm guessing ignorant reality want ideological bias truth. i'm fuck wear mask wear correctly 🖕🏻 know things US, I'm central Europe, consider quite religious know many people like that. some, though, pisses end. could quote least four different books Bible saying God gave us *reason* among everything else wearing masks seems basic thing aligning Christian morality - wear it, protect others; don't, endanger them. selfishness one thing Christians supposed be. There's difference betwenn faith God's protection general foolishness, we've given brains reason. No, programmed take advantage group individual see opportunity. large part group, people time, give slight advantage freeride time. circumstances used good thing people diversely react threat opportunity. fine, need fix system way hurt ones trying take advantage, instead elderly less equipped fight thing. suggested everywhere? I’m second lockdown Melbourne must wear masks whenever leave house regardless around. probably doesn’t make sense could shut every country 14 days. 

If come together, get fact it’s humane keep people locked inside homes stay inside 14 days. Everyone. Supply people food packages last 14 days. Ok won’t get steak pasta porridge imperishables.

Have countries army police it. terrible person is. Fuck Trump fuck vote him. point assume they're playing game Pandemic. Allowing maskless public transport exactly virus wants. wonder trump like sexually attracted covid wants impress it. Poland we're back wearing masks outdoors. take below.

It's much easier police people wearing masks outdoors make people put mask entering closed spaces. hope enforcing masks outdoors going increase indoor mask compliance. simply forgetting mask valid excuse entering buildings public transport, required wear mask soon leave home. Something's data. problem powderpuff democrats everything stop Trump. hope safe place election night plenty tissues dry eyes true city/state, NYC choosing proactively close things, limit gatherings, lockdown areas places like mine (top 10% lists) even leaving open schools massive outbreaks. Wow, awesome. I’ve sent pretty much everyone know. Thank following silly comment guide. gives hope case worst happens Nov. I'm sure protests also caused cases. BLM ones white supremecist ones taking capitals.

But, comparable rallies really.

With BLM protests Im sure ones referencing mostly masks, pass free masks lot protests (when masks confiscated police), participants average take daily precautions like wearing masks day day tasks work. well quarantining limiting activities. put chalk barriers around individuals immunocompromised wish so. 

They safer coming protests people actively call virus hoax. family member fly home North Carolina Beijing early January. sick, coughed weeks said couldn’t breathe. wonder anyone caught her. guess we’ll never know. US classified news. thought European politicians followed science suppressed virus!

There way out, either eliminate virus shut border keep spreading. like username. wanted say. need weird al life. fun discovery experience ahead you! Puscifer great! said that? said job market strong Utah cited 10k pay difference evidence. Cases rising area, compliance (as far subjective observation) upwards ~95%. go whole weeks without seeing non-masked Offff course does. don’t know relates masculinity not, think lot people resistant mask wearing don’t believe mask ordinance ever reversed. addition, don’t believe COVID worrisome enough population well thought wearing one pointless aren’t sick. Really depends location. live, north east part France, people tha owns restaurants, campings stuff best year 2020. made money 8 month whole year. Really depends live doubtful assertion. Sure lag, even march april, case estimated around 100k, around 500 death day maximum. 

And doubt support unemployed better since lots people US still begging stimulus check. 
In France, unemployed people due coronavirus still touching 80% salary. ( loosing job ). 

Concerning Mask, president worst example listening scientific evidence already wearing mask, again. lot governors anti mask antiscience. Maybe box quick tests held privately nobody shitty staff rat out. understand choice. trump needs hit homerun next 24 days win, can't hit homerun step plate. everyone hits homeruns everytime course, many opportunities bat possible political goal right now. 

from public health standpoint though, i'm glad cancelled hope keeps hermetically sealed rooms tests positive twice perhaps even three times couple days apart....but doubt he'll taking time that. really. Trump politicized it. American attitudes viruses vs terrorism. Ok ill get computer science skeptic. Also didn’t address concerns neither risk analysis fact didn’t even read study linked That’s surge limited areas defined neighborhoods city. trying contain spread neighborhoods. Schools closed there, gatherings limited, lockdown place. let’s fret rest lives.  can't cite single study demonstrating causal link mask use transmission reduction one. -“ need trace people hotspots!!! It’s safety even build special places quarantine!!” 
-	So Trump knew infected didn’t wear mask. 
-	That’s works, WeAr mAsK KaReN!! source anxiety one neat little catalog 😌 Parts NYC back lockdown. new color code system place.

There doubt cases surging areas. else expect cause widespread panic? make sure record quarantine get lifted local authority :) Thanks. Due safety concerns around coronavirus pandemic, 30 visitors allowed per hour exhibition. exhibition also sanitized every hour. Attendees required wear face coverings times stem transmission COVID-19 virus. He's probably confused terms means social democracy. usage. Masks part overall system. Even 100% mask usage, everybody crowding indoor stadium concert masks would absolutely useless. like seat belts cars. safety feature one component system safety measures reduce vehicle fatalities.

I'd also curious see mask usage versus case severity I've seeing analysis pointing masks helping reduce infection load exposed end less severe case overall. Wait, mandatory? US 200k deaths **this** mandatory??  Guys wear masks sexier ones without. contact tracing area. kind info could collected process time sort, could patterns always return cart. also wear mask protect people indoors crowded areas.

 risk people's lives every time get behind wheel could theoretically suffer heart attack epileptic seizure crash car someone. still get behind wheel odds low happening. 

I cancelled family Thanksgiving want put parents risk. call selfish using common sense. lot Sounds like expect another confusing shitshow rollout. something like COVID August 2019 took months recover fatigue. COVID. There's viruses really bad people. correct one, two? Ah yes, surprised white supremecy hand well. divides US 306 units calculates current covid growth growth rate one. first map shows cases per capita last two weeks second map thing growth.

it takes lot scrolling find new york city real self-own even arrived yet. China launches effective vaccine, Western media go nuts talking ""dangers rushed vaccines"". Western populace turn anti-vax ever leading many unnecessary deaths. thought anti-maskers problematic, wait till witness anti-vaxxers. course variance don’t expect much different going forward: global warming changing climates fast actually feel happening Well, suppose realized like COVID popped town nothing. around weeks. Apology accepted. Pretty sure hoards international travelers wading jungle get Vietnam though.. 

In Europe borders invisible, millions people live one country work even shopping another. remotely comparable island states authoritarian states strict border infrastructure.

The US royally fucked up, arguments there. I'm making point globally things always simple putting place basic protections places like New Zealand First people say things like zero understanding cost benefit analysis. There’s reason thinkers outside medicine understand complexity risk(see Nicolas Taleb) first recommend mask usage medical establishment got board. reason being: work, they’re extremely low cost solution slowing spread virus compared lockdowns, quarantine exponential spread. We’ve plenty correlative evidence East Asian countries wearing masks immediately least try out. 

Second: literate? reason can’t find casual link limitations study, literally found causal link. You’re spreading literal fake news it’s fucking dangerous.


I link plenty studies I’m mobile it’s pretty easy find look google scholar. One comparison mask usage flights spread virus requiring Yeah, would easier take seriously. Especially lived time anyone understood happening, must terrifying That's probably like say Asians States smarter people european nations, gets like votes anything else. Darwinism. would argue NE general bit more... conscious what’s going general. Many people live take Republican leader’s word gospel. vaccine going NOTHING. 
Still you’ll read articles referring “hot spot zones” “we need trace people” security ""dumpster fire"" love playing arguing randoms. internet about! still urban75.net software upgrades 
Pretty much everywhere around seems back normal. Packed restaurants. College kids partying. 

Cases aren’t increasing much New York anywhere else country  Would useful see mask compliance. area mandated, usage low, enforcement nonexistent, cases increasing.
Mandates useless followed enforced. Therefore think actual mask usage must also considered. lag rise cases rise deaths. couple weeks, death per capita France exceed US since currently getting cases US. Also, places US also require masks entering financial support unemployed better France due CARES Act. Ugh, yeah imagine. 

Sorry go that, see disgrace trial after. need 6ix9ine one Word Dunno, sounds better striving racist country world.   Sorry think talking border lockdown thats mean. 

We complete restriction everyday movement lockdown. easing months curfew 8pm 5am. allowed leave house 1hr day exercise. 1 person house go grocery store, 1 time day. Masks mandatory time home- indoors outdoors. allowed within 5km household. job possible WFH must WFH. warehouse/industrial jobs reduce capacity ensure social distancing. restricted number industries deemed essential request permits travel outside 5km. WFH essential go temp welfare program called jobkeeper. Fines breaking rules like $5000. things worked. didn't. It’s much different already lol don’t sit listen news day you’ll panic like this. way described two aunts must either Lisa Bart Simpson. sounds like Georgia (USA) am. many people fight masks distancing, mostly citing Trump medical expert. 🙄 short lockdown many loopholes, first places reopened nail hair salons, bowling alleys, massage tattoo shops. insane. social media full people restaurants, bars, people’s homes, since June/July. Neighboring counties schools open normal mask requirements students back early August. kids schools opening full time next week, masks required. Mine aren’t going yet. 
And numbers definitely skewed. Obama's term made opinions conservative politicians shaky. Trump's given deep prejudice conservative politicians conservatives. ton work immediately distrust someone based political leanings. hate it. Florida? weirdo spot beach/club goers? Yes is. 
Players already tested negative circus? Holy shit again..this drug never touted drug help covid it. works preventing getting 1st place . one would look countries generic drug sold counter malaria may notice cases covid countries. 
1st told us dispensed half billion times label bad us..now testing treats covid positive patients . bad drug already gone completely generic, every person west countries would it. better point mention would obviously work Trump. progressed hospitalization, oxygen steroids. 

That means early immune response treatment work. Steroids immunosuppressive, nothing fight virus. Right next article ""2020: want live planet anymore."" Actually, lot people low socioeconomic class would too. City making good money. I’ve seen many people get fined day MTA fares came back, police wait right outside bus people walk come get rest. old lady’s young man couple got fined.  still know statistically, French dumber:  r/usernamechecksout Europe mostly way south... Germany, praised numbers, weeks ago 1.5k new cases, 2k, 2.5k, day yesterday 4k, yesterday 4.5k, today 4.7k... Winter/fall coming people let guard down. result. beginning coming. us cost lot effort, lives, money restrictions get maybe till january/february kind control. next weeks/months one point show uncontrolled spread losses like new York bergamo. Wish us luck may god gracious us. looks like type doesn’t want swab nose still gets lollipop checkups doctor every year course would work....even 3 weeks getting EVERY single person able feasible. many exceptions, homeless, essential workers &amp; mean corner deli ""sell food"". Would ideal perfect world... COVID cases surging clusters NYC, NY NJ get paid post. Plenty French people blaming compatriots they're stupider 'Mericans. Also, always staple reddit acknowledge asians america smarter people western nations  love people like go fear mongering people get hit harder virus millions people.

Outliers exist every illness. “A mask face? Next you’ll force wear mask dick!” /s read situation - imposed hard lockdown eradicated virus. 

The CCP jittery cautious - thought COVID still general population way would ever let people fraternise China way they're right now. 

Density fucking irrelevant virus gone. Thanks link, opened like twenty pop ads window. Florida isn’t 5 times better. It’s twice good like said. it’s economy still Intact. trying prove showing me? Even Democratic areas 30-40% Republican. Republican areas roughly Democratic. effected areas people live, typically places get Democratic densely populated is. government takes responsibility, pharma. think disproportionate way effects old people problematic public sentiment.

 current estimated hospitalisation rate confirmed COVID-19 cases date Australia remains 13%. packed bars restaurants going stay open measures stop spread. Parts St. Louis worse Somalia  See, thing is, can't decide someone else feels way something. true motive is. like can't DECIDE you. That's thoughts work. inability think people different viewpoints might, possibly, acting good faith says think saying anyone else here. Dude. 6 frontline workers recovered 'weeks' ago. reinfection, reactivation, something talked virus. 

Regardless, hospital roommate works like 20% entire workforce get covid april. people continued working covid patients face face... cases reinfection. did, would big deal. saying definitive proof, anecdote, reinfection happening likely way happens viruses: rare isolated cases, applicable large majority people. 

Do know SARS-like virus reinfection occurred? just... common cold viruses, virus effectively similar to. Common cold viruses almost always low immunity, mean entire *family* viruses belong shares immunity characteristics. 

I saying 100% wrong. evidence short term immunity, whereas quite bit precedent longer term immunity SARS MERS long term cellular immunity, low amount reinfection cases. coin doesn’t always two sides. virtually negative consequences wearing masks plenty positives. really recommend mask use quickly infections rise much. live next one largest hospitals Beijing.

If infectious diseases concealed, easily test hospitals overcrowded people? Even colleagues neighbors relieved traveling country, children returned kindergarten school.

You can't hide infectious disease hospitals would overrun, right? Worth noting peak April Ireland “level 5” lockdown (the server version) weeks. Ireland entered “level 3” days age, cases likely continue clime foreseeable future live next one largest hospitals Beijing.

You can't hide infectious disease hospitals would overrun, right? agree u South want us there

.....but dont think really accurate I'm saying I'm thankful research article. crazy still debated I'm saying. know sub getting trolled hard. obesity among U.S. adults hit all-time high projected get higher higher. survived, doubt helped enormously early hospitalization best care money buy.

How well recovers remains seen. It’s almost like extensive health organization actual epidemiologists ground opposed website counts things. kid epilepsy. hospital less 24 hours darn good insurance. walked owing nearly 5,000 pocket. friend even death rate low, greater chance costing thousands dollars long term health issues. kidding. water wet. know. know.   like essential worker me.

Young people socially isolated months virus .02% chance killing them, expect? Yawn  mainly latter group dominate conversation. easy see why. Many restaurants entertainment venues can't stay open &amp; operate black 50% capacity, supporters know this. That's want full re-opening businesses resuming without restrictions. Either. Side. Will. Do. Anything. To. Win.


Stop letting system fool thinking classic two sides coin. Oh go science again. would someone bother listen science instead listen fantasy? US 7 day average bottomed 35k September 12th, back 48k. creeping now. US never dropped low Europe, whole Europe right per capita level US (some countries already worse course).

So hard say. trajectories different expect mirror closely - far. Even locking down, Europe showing willingness aggressive measures, maybe Europe go high, dive low again, US keeps steady high increase cases? Yeah, reservations accommodations Parents probably also unwell psychologically, negligent. Calling something disagree ""agenda"" attempt dismiss viewpoint less ""real"" actually make saying appealing slightest. One could call stance ""agenda"" easily, would meaningless. Also, basically repeated exact point like four times. equate actually points. UK 16000 day local lockdown noone know rules Why?!?!? Article said went high school reservation, probably Native American/ Mestizo descent. Rates obesity extremely high among people live reservations. reason people refuse wear masks.  [this 1,769 ZIP codes state, Cuomo said 10 **are averaging infection rate 15 percent compared overall statewide infection rate 1.5 percent Monday**. **Those 10 ZIP codes account 25 percent state's new daily cases despite representing 2.9 percent state's population. ""**

Due population density places like Brooklyn Queens, effects well beyond community. one thing, people communities commute Manhattan. example, diamond district.

Also, [this published 2 days ago:

""The city’s seven-day positivity rate average ranged 1.56 1.75 percent week, low 0.9 percent Sept. 4, according city data. concerned officials rising cases Brooklyn Queens. **Areas Borough Park Brooklyn, example, consistently daily positivity rates exceeding 8 percent.** Gravesend Brooklyn, rate climbed past 7 percent"" Ya based experience isn’t nearly indicative entire communities. I’ve seen orthodox people wearing masks I’ve also seen wearing masks. point can’t generalize entire community based actions few. went get Covid test last week everyone else orthodox/Hasidic Jew wearing masks. explain fact wanted get tested wore masks there? say 100% orthodox people wear masks?

Obviously not. Don’t generalize entire groups people bc seems like that’s case. would never generalize entire groups people based race, ok based religion?

Another experience had: 3 orthodox Jewish boys sitting together outside 2 separate guys came yell “their communities”. kids wearing masks distanced everyone else. type lazy generalization leads hatred entire communities like this, I’m sure helped contribute increase antisemitic hate crimes. state current country lunatic president, please think generalizing entire subsets people lead negative outcomes overall careful situations. Censorship answer. immunity would likely short term

This exactly scary. viruses herd immunity for. Vaccinate enough people enough people endure it, pretty much control. coronaviruses however get that... that's even taking account amount hosts risks mutation. symptoms? Narrator: ""It didn't. fact, quite opposite."" Freddy Scion? That's weird. Thought Coronavirus affected biological organisms  people gone months without wearing one “ZoMg GeT MaSk RoNa1111111111” government, People’s natural thought process well wasn’t wearing one 5 months ago now?

I walked Tesco day many staff/customers wasn’t wearing masks don’t see point now. January 20, academician Zhong Nanshan, head National Health Commission's high-level expert group, said interview CCTV news, ""It useful wear mask prevent new coronavirus.""

&amp;#x200B;

At 2:00 a.m. January 23, Wuhan's new coronavirus epidemic prevention control headquarters reported announced wearing masks public places canceling social gatherings.

&amp;#x200B;

The U.S. CDC even done January 23 Wuhan measures confused mean. found B cell immunity SARS 12 years infected.

Show anything shows matters. I'd love see evidence long term coronavirus immunity. Got full text? Reinfection scary sounds. Let put way, happen, mean relevant 99% people. 

We idea reinfection rate is, hit year since people's last infections impossible say. know reinfection among front line workers hugely uncommon, documented often worse infections. often healthy individuals, lot viruses 

Do know single coronavirus long term immunity? I'd love citation. 

 One study found reinfection happening everybody 4 months rate normal infections, would 150k reinfections USA right now. Instead have... 2 confirmed cases reinfection worldwide.

2 cases reinfection? India front line workers alone 6 confirmed reinfections last checked.  also never said 4 months time line immunity wear off, although somewhat consistent coronaviruses. also seems like would inferring people got sick would stop measures prevent getting sick again, something actually seen. 

Let's see people 6 months caught march many covid again. nowhere math assumes it, say find religious denial even possibility mass reinfections quite curious. also disturbing. 

One ponder long hard exactly people committed particular position way good news??? survey minority suffer seriously enough hospitalized used generalization whole virus. That's fear mongering now.

They Republican governors state house control. three gone Republican presidential candidate every time last twenty years. 

One six Senators Democrat, guess, look pretty solid red here. I've flu before. felt like something completely different.. Wait, Amish outbreak IN? 15% cases found tests?

I mean surprising, outside *close* together I'm denying anything. BLM protesters saw wearing masks wearing faces mouths. Orthodox people saw celebrating Sukkot park week? I'd say half wearing masks wearing chins. Even crowded park pathways say excuse several times get through. you... even read the.... sources all? read article that's five year total. also says currently 12 million child marriages year.

The extra 500k sucks, talking four percent increase. people care child marriage before, change that. 4% tipping point systemic change child marriage would great though. post removed because:

finally, Iranian govt happy Western media's action hehe Yes, read Pakistani news India. 732Mn half Indians. see half shitting outside. Use brain quote unreliable news. trust Doctor Pepper Good question, include it, that's real bad part. We're nearly 10%. See clic ""carte des indicateurs"", scroll ""Taux de positivité des tests RT-PCR"". We're nation wide 127 incidence rate = new cases per 100,000 inhabitants per week. supposed worry lot crossing 5% positivity rate, 10 / 100,00 weekly incidence…

But parts country way worst. Paris city 15% positivity rate, 336 incidence rate.

What's holding thing still young people infected. 20-29 years old infected, followed 30-39 years old. Well wasn’t genomes traced know wasn’t November..smh mean... answer makes pretty obvious didn’t know difference. safe proper public health safeguards place

eg, masks distancing.

**The spread infection gaining new momentum Sweden, healthcare increase number patients treated covid-19.           
""The situation very, serious"", says Karin Tegmark Wisell Swedish Public Health Agency.**
              
              
During Thursday's press conference, Swedish Public Health Agency reported deaths among people confirmed covid-19 Sweden. spread infection gaining momentum. present, proportion positive tests among tested 2.9 per cent - proportion increased steadily recent weeks.       
              
 *""Last week 2.4 percent week 1.6 percent""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.        
              
In Uppsala , example, signs extra sharp increase.           
              
 *""We also see signs possible slowdown see Skåne Stockholm""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.          
              
When comes number people receiving hospital care covid-19, far matter comparatively low numbers, according National Board Health Welfare's compilation. present, 25 people cared covid-19 intensive care, 152 infected people cared wards. trend increasing well.                 
                
 *""We see slight increase people cared covid-19 healthcare""*, says Mattias Fredricson, unit manager National Board Health Welfare.       
                 
On Thursday , message came restrictions number people may gather public gatherings eased, something Karin Tegmark Wisell justifies increased spread infection.        
*""Now see situation very, serious regions increasing spread infection also hear National Board Health Welfare slight increase burden healthcare""*, says.      
 *""Then time lighten way.""*
                   
**Does mean instead see stricter measures throughout country?**
              
 *""It important really think whole thing go new recommendations, becomes appropriate. mission look public health whole, see consequences extremely negative. coin always two sides""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.            
              
She mentions restraining order nursing homes example restrictions negative consequences ways.         
                 
**It soon autumn break people planning trips. relevant reintroduce travel restrictions country?**           
                
 *""We may forced go back situations before. try back much, possible reconsider decisions reliefs made"", says Tegmark Wisell.                   
Earlier day, Swedish Public Health Agency presented possibility introducing different types local measures different parts country.                   
 *""The legislation different, national. However, general guidelines sent consultation, purpose clarify see tools suitable use situation""*, says Tegmark Wisell.            

**Can region introduce binding rules locally, recommendations?**       
            
 *""A general advice linked legislation, case Infection Control Act. compliance poor, move higher scale terms introducing clearer restrictions""*, says Tegmark Wisell.                  
She emphasizes Swedish strategy based understanding situation individual seen responsible person, continues.        
        
 *""The first step staircase go way""*, says Karin Tegmark Wisell.
              
**Facts: Number dead infected**       
A total 97,532 people confirmed infected covid-19 Sweden.            
To date, 5,892 infected died.             
25 people receive intensive care covid-19 another 152 people cared hospital wards.           

-------------------          
Note, I'll add two informations.       

- numbers October 8 slightly different: 5912 deceased (+1 1 day), 23 ICU 168 hospitalizations.

- Despite higher positive rate (4x 30 days), numbers new tests decreased last 3 weeks. 142673 tests week 37 127844 week 40 Here's quote Fauci. familiar term ""high-risk"" I’m 79 years old. getting plane. flights I’ve seated near people sneezing coughing, three days later, I’ve got it. So, chance. Metro, public transportation. I’m high risk group, don’t want play around.

Meanwhile, Trump wear mask, attends rallies, everything Fauci says ensure gets infected, severe case. 

Here ""expert-recommended article"" explains Trump feeling well right I'm hoping get travel bubble organised soon countries virus control. Threads like make easy identify sociopaths Reddit. Construction workers (with masks social distancing) adding rooms provide space 14 additional beds Sanford Medical Center Fargo Like Muj, guy’s ass Honestly needed seperate comment. sound like Marie Antoinette: bread can't eat cake? pull head ass mean, wouldn’t dead right didn’t COVID... I’m high risk parents I’m staying put house. family actually taking way risks I’m comfortable it. I’ve solo holidays though due work treat holidays like NBD. Wear damn mask! reduces transmission virus. need lockdowns major cities EU counting people TESTED POSITIVE flu. counting put death certificate. 

Those two things different. Can’t say sarcasm..... wasn’t still made quarantine 14 days. 

But original comment point hypocrisy government claims shut borders protect citizens, leaving 100000 stuck abroad vulnerable virus yet panders rich movie star? guess sensitive dog whistles statistics classes mandatory worldwide Honestly wear masks even flu season reduces spread flu virus thus saving lives I’m actually pretty sure herd immunity crowd eugenicists disguise. millions deaths you’re talking aren’t hurdle hope human race get past - it’s point. Huh. historical truth side effect WWII? 

Not everything WWII. Might predate like lots blondes Norway Sweden due Vikings evidence clear.

Hydroxychoroquine without zinc administered hospitalized patients wildly inappropriate dosages without co-administered antibitoics help Covid-19 patients. God: Alright I’ve run ideas I’ll tweak script March reuse October. See section 2, figure 1. describe detail give links data. short looks like looking deaths specifically caused flu/pneumonia/covid. I.e. underlying cause death. Wait op sarcasm. Trump saying(and doing) america months now. Muh freedoms!!!! even understand extremely MILDY INCONVIENCED wearing piece cloth face 5 minutes walking store?!?!! Hidden antisemitism?

I've read comments thread actual article. anything, see awkward defending Jews accusing others antisemitic pointing Orthodox/ultra-Orthodox problematic (which have). Maybe missed particularly egregious comment, think would called ""hidden. ""

As actual article, speaks facts. synagogues pointed specifically limiting religious gatherings? NY massive ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, communities flouting distancing mask-wearing. damn rabbi positive, goodness sake. 

And say Jew myself. I'm failing see ""hidden"" antisemitism. Honestly that’s fair enough. think you’re getting downvoted saying seems like anti-mask stance surface it’s logic you’re actually going after. 

The data prove masks work. White House event example wearing masks result massive, potentially avoidable/reducible transmission. entirely applicable: close borders, lock cases go zero.

That's problem. problem SUSTAINING zero.

Pretty much every European country simply cannot afford keep borders closed long-term. unthinkable highly impractical - cross-border communications exchanges way intense. countries like Netherlands Germany, keeping borders closed prolonged periods time would pretty much destroy economy. exaggeration, keeping borders open EU nowadays absolutely vital economy actually function. That's case New Zealand - even land borders.

With mind, bring cases zero, unless neighbours also zero cases bringing ANYONE third countries covid cases, soon re-open borders...the virus gonna back vengeance. gonna worse, longer able enforce hard lockdown like first time (because economically socially sustainable) still eradicated virus. Basically suffered negative consequences lockdown without gaining shit.

Eradication works afford effectively cut rest world quarantine everyone entering indefinitely. Plus, bar Wuhan-style lockdown, extremely hard (read: nearly impossible) actually reach zero cases virus longer confined isolated outbreaks. NZ, Taiwan, China South Korea option. Europe not. COULD if

a. EVERY european country locked time virus circulation still low (as in, later mid-February)

and

b. closed external EU borders indefinitely.

They didn't, couldn't. NZ's approach meaningless them. It’s complicated that; Europe can’t completely shut internal borders long term like says largely closed. Wealthy people access different visas ability invest raise money. Look up. go many countries instant willing ro invest lots money communities.

Gabe newell, billionaire owner valve got stuck NZ famous race car driver started. Shortly announcing things like festival racing event, likely order get longer visas. strain healthcare system people (avoidable) flu would catastrophic. resources could used covid elective treatments would used something could prevented. I’m sorry household isn’t taking quarantine spread seriously, people behaving way worst big part vulnerable end getting hurt. Try stay safe best least part furthering spread, unlike roommates. Okay trigger bot. fun get mental health help. literally can't know long-term effects started infecting lot people 8 months ago.

From long-term COVID-19 effects still still unknown COVID-19 affect people time. However, researchers recommend doctors closely monitor people COVID-19 see organs functioning important remember people COVID-19 recover quickly. potentially long-lasting problems COVID-19 make even important reduce spread disease following precautions wearing masks, avoiding crowds keeping hands clean. world knows moron. right here. Holy shit. understand logic, really delusional. explains lot American. may surprise, vote SOMEONE still retarded. Lots people vote SOMEONE (a) want avoid vaccination, (b) think universal healthcare farce (c), want common core, (d) put stock form afterlife rather focusing all, US, anywhere ever seen, people understand income disparity. make $375,000 year, 98th percentile income wise (per household). closer, dollar dollar, 10th percentile income wise Ask someone street makes $375000 tell close 1% want taxed friend, someone smart enough know better vote SOMEONE mean retarded. meant compared obviously already thinking. okay, find reason argue, ig? Idk everything fight. Sorry I'm relieved doctors forced misdiagnose people. figured that'd good thing relieved about. keep mind don’t see. Like people go eat, people still throwing parties, people hanging outside/eachothers houses mask, college students, etc... live bars, arcades, Halloween activities, movies theaters etc open ppl aren’t social distancing whole time &amp; aren’t wearing masks either events Yeah. like people cancer remission high blood pressure that's controlled medication dying comorbidities get COVID. Even though would've lived years COVID. people want admit COVID lethal. sure downvoted stating facts. getting confused droplet transmission think, different airborne. Airborne means linger air hours. Droplets tend sink ground, large enough filtered simple bandana. true airborne. mask anything short n95, anything help. kill someone driving charged manslaughter. Maybe covid spreaders.

The biggest problem seat belt analogy seat belt protects driver society. like stop signs, street lights, car inspections, speed limits, laws driving impaired. restrictions liberty designed protect primary right life. Wearing masks following cdc guidelines protecting everyone reducing risk much possible. Tom’s likely still immune.  Swedes spreading state propaganda. long though. Autumn winter summer holidays kids done cases go roof, hospital staff worn out, Swedish dream blissful herd immunity dies spreaders state propaganda go hiding. Huh. historical truth side effect WWII? 

I would guess, literally zero data whatsoever, men selected soldiers would generally taller put non-combat roles. ratio counts impact abject poverty means calculations made different.

You live country grocery shelves still stocked people baking sour dough bread lockdown much surplus food obesity become real health issue. People recieved generous social assistance lockdown. Even could afford miss meal two. 

India relatively recently couldnt feed itself. Large chunk population could barely feed even good times. Hunger kills like covid. 

You're dead either scenario, question kills hunger disease. cases former. going flu mentioned death ceritificates. require positive flu test. 

I think likely wrong. Tom hanks allowed return Queensland nearly 100000 Australians stuck abroad unable return due cap incoming flights. virus serious say is, they’d dead 🙄 Actual Testing numbers India great combining RT PCR tests Antigen tests . Count RT PCR tests India's Captial new delhi comprise 20% 1.e. 12K 60K daily tests. information given CM delhi.  
Link interview - 
(Language - Hindi + English) ...are trolling? You’re basically bragging EVERY high risk activity right forum pandemic🤦🏼‍♀️ feel sorry honestly real can’t see bigger picture society honestly safety. young way lesser chances complications, still immune. personally former coworker 20s, health conditions, pass virus. Yep, young people sacrificing best years (and important years terms personal development) vires extremely low chance killing them. sub doesnt appreciate hearing false. made using embryonic stem cells Getting first place might whacked, might - depends said child died. Using vaccine even remote participation death said child. Turns out, adult stem cells show promise donor dead. real sad thing personally sitting alone world people agree singled delusional psychopathic behavior. one cares conspiratorial thoughts delusions one likes approves endangering people harming others behavior. need help finding mental health support, point right direction. need it. posts facts don’t fit call political troll account. realize propaganda works, right? work everyone? No. work enough people significant issue? Clearly. Given fauci believes propaganda one biggest issues dealing covid belief said it, I'm inclined believe propaganda works allowed. someone illness (like virus covid), creates breeding ground bacterial infections. That's people get sinus infections experiencing cold. Thanks advice predictions u/cool-- omniscient. I'll share everyone coming dinner party tonight we're properly informed. “Regardless diet” true. burn one hour hundred calories. calories still higher calories out, won’t lose weight. It’s basic math. course exercise important lot reasons, quantity (and lesser extent, quality) food matters most. also 8 fucking vaccines phase 3 trial currently. It’s unbelievable people can’t live without parties things, literally one least necessary activities think Okay, since understand probability, link Fauci said Trump and/or Christi die catch COVID? Seems pretty risky country high population density. Even obese old death rate still small. Stop overdramatizing things. Lots countries ran sweeper flights return citizens countries. Fellow RT here, keep em breathing sister! People accepting illogical conclusions align attitudes, made Trump first place. hope proud tradition. I'm sorry one ""leader"" ""policies"" hip pocket orders based misinformation stemming arrogance delusions grandeur. day 1, listened ""policies"" come Fauci, WHO, CDC reputable sources drowned. no, policies ended part issue. 7% hospitalization rate. 15%, still way high. Yes. Sorry say trying say right. None us Covid thank goodness. CDC isnt universal truth. Japanese say, good method way present information. State fund TV documentaries people actually see 1.5m sufficient this?

Do goddamn research delve repeating one party states. like said before, Netherlands Dutch CDC (RIVM) states masks barely effective. another country states does. see works?

Or one Bauhaus Weimar bought doctors scientists time figure treatments, reduced death rate, importantly, lasting health damage. totally overwhelmed, data collected studies continue improve treatments.

We Europe use months lockdowns bought learn countries control epidemic, regarding proper TTI, importantly, public messaging. example, Germany, enough TTI workers right now, numbers bit summer.
Germany kept around R=1 whole summer almost zero restrictions. impossibility stop it.
In Asia, clear governments R&lt;1 cheapest option available.

Cheap fast antigen tests months away first world. tested reliable enough epidemic control workplaces, care homes schools, large gatherings tight-knit communities, make difference transmission rates. true. Even enough money lots, adequate support system, it’s easier. Thank Sherlock Nooo none us got Covid. stating based article even take precautions flu.  Ah yes, floor made floor company requiring WFH, IMO even offering WFH, providing employees least necessary electronics internet. always find fascinating. Ok thanks clarification. TIL doctors hate black people....... Sheesh. 

I'll exit conversation back reality. hope great day. Stay safe.  history asthma. obesity nothing it. Nice LAT.

Did CC get regeneron drug too? really, Trump win popular vote. Sorry Italy. serve warning West, won't... There’s difference monoclonal antibody meant bind proteins produced body monoclonal antibody neutralizes virus.

Adalimumab (Humira) infliximab (Ramicade) bind TNF, Tocilizumab (Actemra) binds IL-6. Bevacizumab (Avastin) bind VEGF. Classic mab treatment mechanisms involve binding proteins continuously created body therefore require continued treatment.

This different monoclonal (technically polyclonal case REGN-Cov-2) meant bind receptor binding domain SARS-Cov-2 spike protein neutralize virus prior cellular entry. virus left neutralize, need administer additional antibody treatment. antibody also relatively long half-life provide protection reinfection least months. Somebody week unironically said think Trump might tamper genocide black Latino people. good logic either. hope still manage graduate. ""if wear mask, supporting president"" political? No. need happen. all.

Do act inevitable. *That choice.* makes think that? Makes much sense everything else I'm Reform Jew myself, 100% agree you. couple commenters trying make seem like religion attacked crazy. 

Any religion (or belief, matter) causes issues choose extreme version belief into, scientific evidence presented. unfortunately, certain people get swept belief, keeps happening time time virus. Areas manage calm down, generally belief-based event kicked many outbreaks made things worse. 

I can't speak others, things like especially irk me. important act branch Judaism save/preserve life. seeing ultra-Orthodox groups mess things North America Isreal maddening disheartening. 

The sad thing ultra-Orthodox groups would argue I'm real Jew seem actually give damn protecting around me, don't. there's vaccine things normal, please go Berlin ask people street question. Film post online me. dont want like china Fauci said could enough doses Americans April  Yet another third party lab data dump. Sure lot throughout south last several months IFR definitely significantly higher thEn. even 2%, 50k ~daily infections.

EDIT: autocomplete... totally get people getting mad losing jobs, close business, problems paying rent, otherwise lives turned upside down. things worth angy scared about.

But think say epidemic serious, kind makes worse. Instead acknowleding lost job there's real emergency, saying lost job real reason all. That's devaluing sacrifice -- everybody else's.

(But also people getting epic anger masks, seems way disproportionate inconvenience using them.) Ah make sense! already aware bc news (and honestly don’t keep much) assumed common place knowledge. way read assumed knew ended getting Covid anyways. Thanks insight old retired people. I’m sure median applicable know concentrations elderly people.

Interesting Florida 5th highest median age 41.8 Except administration wishing death.. they're actively working make reality.. keep ""praying"" though. live era concept ""boredom"" practically exist. media world pockets. 

But avoiding large gathering still soOoOoOo hard...

Go hang best friend need spend time people. Fuck parties right now. COVID drastically higher rate hospitalization flu, floods healthcare networks causes deaths disease, conditions may underserved due drain resources. [The flu puts 1.6% patients hospital, compared 20% Combine hospital duration easily go [twice long even bigger drain resources. scroll first link, see state state mortality breakdown, obvious tristate area, faced huge early surge, suffered this, mortality around 7% vs U.s. average 2.8%. Well that’s better original assumption. Masks required + alcohol still concern rick around people. sure lot third party lab data dumps throughout south last several months US still laughing stock world... collection academics striking lack citation data sources.

So becomes opinion piece 

(we think opposed conclude) good news him.. republicans infected last week survive, pushes false agenda virus hoax bad.. months ago, 0 people this. still need mitigate spread. approved sufficient supply, begin making herd immune. lol yeah let pay house food with....nothing ? Sorry brain isn’t complex enough calculate effects economy actually quote single source saying universal mask usage population saves thousand lives compared counterfactual situation mask usage situations people keep distance ban large scale events? Shutting places seems defining factor here. know, left crystal ball pants. I'm wrong person ask better alternatives, tell awful. Truth told “embryonic stem cell” thing kind dumb criticism. lot research uses cell lines (which embryonic stem cells) derived single fetus 50+ years ago. Forgoing modern medicine isn’t going bring fetus back. guys funny. cases go it’s masks social distancing work. go it’s one wearing masks social distancing. Everyone wants one simple explanation this. allowed create rules allowed criticise rules unclear, unreasonable unproductive given importance subject-matter hand. 

Incidentally, followed COVID-19 Reddit since early days, recall flip /r/China_Flu /r/Coronavirus much recall Reddit prompting users join /r/Coronavirus front page. words, talking random subreddit created me, petty rules, banter. special (official even) subreddit special topic standard care higher. None answers accurate. true answer roughly, sure 

Here's best resource I've found Expendable Generation apparently since best way get tested sick enough need medical attention chance spread it, everybody truly win here. Pass os disgrace federal government commission single format database reporting standards begining whole debacle could avoided.

We insane tech companies world ever seen, failing cannot handle backs CS student projects fuck's sake. probably loophole, done several times.  What’s amount spread would comfortable order “take risks”? Germany increase testing, did, number infected people rise number severe cases stayed same.

After testing increased anymore, numbers stayed recent weeks, infections rise also number deaths rise, too. 1% chance dying low risk issue. 

Lots people don’t even know heart lung issues aren’t severe enough noticed normal basis, deadly comes covid. There’s also chance they’ll permanent damage least long term negative issues.

Most us also care friends family getting sick potentially dying, we’re selfish assholes like you.  Betting spike disinformation spreaders linked shutdown T_D Fascists charge Executive Senate, that’s why. ""Not problem, is"" would Greitens better scenario? Jesus Christ dude. genuinely understand masks never meant confer full immunity, guessing? demographic likely go one holding back progress towards better world, sometimes look long term next quarter.  Nowhere even remotely close peak, increase happening fairly gradually compared meteoric rise June. trouble is, likely leaders take advantage responding early, means increase still pretty bad news going get worse. fair, exact anti mask sentiment existed spanish flu. internet every idiot gets voice

Source: Nice cherrypicking. Meanwhile Spain highest case counts extremely high mask usage masks cases Sweden. never masks, limiting contact moments.  400,000! FUCK So, what's timeline? 3.5 weeks deaths start spiking? 
JUST time election.  Mixed emotions. Kinda like sub cherry picking information generalizing entire country 1.4B people. serious sarcastic? Given 75% adults worldwide plan get vaccinated immunity rate 95% needed eradicate disease eradication absolutely happen anytime soon definitely end 2021.

It take *years* vaccinate everyone willing get it. current goal vaccinate 20% world population end 2021 20% specific group people - health care workers vulnerable Anyone thinks things back normal end 2021 very, wrong. real pandemic response place next round, airports closed roads city closed. Cargo airplanes spread virussus. People virus factories. don’t care, lives don’t matter. 

It’s like awareness campaign problem 25% homeless people women, need end women’s homelessness. Guess 75% homeless aren’t worth helping they’re privileged...

Sucks shared humanity gets lost megaphone ideologies explicit implicit biological supremacism. 

We’re similar not; would progress get back idea equality focus people specific problems specific demographics. Don’t pay people social security they’re dead. 175k people (deaths 65) * 40k benefits year average $7 billion year savings.

They need people dead Fauci talking timetable emergency use authorization essential workers vulnerable. I'm loving freedom here. realize covid patients often feel better week progressing?

And also fact White House literally fully functioning hospital it. doesn’t help Christie obviously, Trump could absolutely poor health wouldn’t know it. well stated. Thank you. detract statement one million dead? think everyone trying hold kind hope, think kind stuff destory it.

I'll honest think world might with. Fucking science denier. Wait...you can't live life! Al-Gore Clinton reality America Democracy, climate change pandemic would properly managed. U.S. whole lot bigger spread places.

That could mean lulled false sense security different cities regions move along curves different rates instead u uniformly like many smaller compactly population countries. love God, Europe lockdown now, given record number daily new cases! get stupidly defensive resort meaninglessness retorts like ""How old you?"". Europeans continue reject reality, may beginning end. North Carolina resident here. Mid-December 2019 got rather ill. Super lethargic, congested, difficulty breather, per se—but definitely lot chest gurgling/congestion breathing. Lingered week so. wife also got ill around time, much milder persistent. mother lives us (early 70s; CHF &amp; COPD patient, lifelong smoker) long illness hospitalized several days bilateral bronchial-pneumonia, finally released Christmas Day.

I really don’t know COVID-19 actually spreading NC point. might wishful thinking part (assuming may resistant reinfection possess antibodies). could passed nasty cold flu around other. Uhh congrats prepping guess... called surgical mask reason. Surgeons extremely complicated tasks (e.g. cut human brains) hours them. yet scrolling phone bus mask unbearably hard people seems. I've heard antibodies go away time true immunity comes cells. testing antibodies easier less expensive. antibodies last long (I believe China found antibodies going away 8-9 weeks), true immunity detectable antibody test comes T-cells. read? first post, said cite study observational study. observational studies sufficient proving efficacy. 220,000 now. important continue attribute new deaths Dr. Fauci Federal Employee year award. Trump jealous.   TTI would ineffective many regions large spread large part country. TTI used lesser hit regions throughout though.

It timely upgrade. idea better world doesn’t include crossing fingers two million people dying, fuck wrong you? Especially get hit flu hit last season. saw healthy people. cannot imagine would people also infected covid. Well also country want wear masks. sad people care care hurt people. Americans scared wearing masks... Wow... 400,000? awards??? Sounds accurate. guess people wanna play wait see game now. Much like global warming. Gotta make wifefolk, get murderin' wee ones. mental gymnastics must justify many people getting infected dying must qualify olympics. Policy: course principle action adopted proposed government, party, business, individual.


They’re exactly enacting pro mask policies. seem doubt principle masks. So.....

Would less offended called “non pro-mask policy?” quite quarantined went outside took 2 tests 2 different locations, you? worked home basically. one day, calm down. using logical fallacy appealing emotions. 

What we're talking %. 

If 7% ""way high"", 20%? 25? 40%? 70%?

Percentage-wise, 7% hospitalization (which 7 100 people, 1 7 people let logic get way strawman argument) ""way high"".

If number 1 way high let ask something: next 10 years, 2 people die due extreme poverty caused lockdowns every 1 person dies COVID...would agree lockdowns excessive created harm good?

After all, 1 already way high no? doesn’t matter. I’ve still got idiots running around town maskless claiming don’t work. 

“There’s PROOF!” shove proof throats. lengthy land borders. 

None intense economically relevant exchanges random internal EU border. Import-export flows France Germany large Vietnam's total GDP.

It would comparable if, say, South Korea China Japan shared land border billions euros exports day two thousands people commuting (not mention tourism). don't.

Btw, never mentioned population density. think that's huge factor, least way people usually understand recreational activity allowed Level 4, walking around block.

That allowed Italy. got banned huge campaign runners (to point became meme). know people dare walk around block 2 scared police fines. restrictions listed applied well. 

I think Spain around level, IIRC June people could leave homes specific times day depending age.

Don't get wrong, I'm downplaying severity NZ's lockdown, especially considering relatively low infection rate time. I'm saying likely toughest developed geographically isolated, that's irrelevant international air travel.

International air travel check quarantine every single person coming - many EU countries also check people flying in. entirely different story tens thousands people coming every day train car foot - people vital companies keep running. yeah, extremely keep borders closed long-term painful decision European country would faced.

Not really. many European cities, example, closing borders literally means factories cannot produce cannot receive components supply quickly need, mention much expensive whole process would get. would wreak havoc entire continental industry. uncommon European regions intense exchanges regions neighbouring countries regions country. ever wondered Switzerland, EU member, still allows free travel neighbours?

Again, get wrong, admire NZ's response. excellent. model pretty much works NZ handful countries, sadly. justice severity problem. wanted strive things okay. aim better okay? say right based voting dude. 

Just people disagree stupid. Ik leerde vandaag robbed place virus could potentially wipe 200 million people worldwide. stupidest hill die on. easy wear mask benefit all. Yes, since June. That's point. debate required get tested

you're correct -- rules set forth debate required pre-event testing. get tested pre-debate. irony one Karen's floor, completely switched gears. see's effects, family taking seriously. potentially spreading unknown amount people, putting hospital staff danger. right 90% time. 10%? irrelevant. states RUN CDC order read reports put out. tolerating discomfort something consistently downplays calls hoax... Definitely not. Interesting. Last tweet 23 hours ago? stopped getting steroids couple days ago, he? Maybe he's feeling well. curiosity, country “locked down” age group? *Herpes simplex virus jealous.* again, back January local news full ""Boy, flu really pretty bad year!"". first ""official"" case January 20. know, back think screen asymptomatic people flying China, person question death's door officially diagnosed. I’m talking *bare minimum* wearing mask going events, bars, partying. worried guy. fan politically seems less insane others Trump’s orbit Google literally right there. Right there. Facts appreciate much. far good :)

Becoming active busy helped. Actually getting things done around house. Cooking more. Life getting good again!

Edited. Forgot word lol Yes. 5k couch earlier year. Regretting 20lbs later.  political leaders suggest basic precautions appear unmanly, men less likely follow health safety advice, experts say. Can’t believe u guys still believe event 201 scam. u eyes? u stayed platos cave long u can’t believe what’s outside? Turn tv come join us, waters fine. come within inch face sometimes, want hug me, want kiss me,

ridiculous. imagine human wanting kiss heap dried rat vomit  need banned. dutch pm also mentioned early on, actually. masculine let others around get hurt, suffer die, masculine protect others around you, need wear mask.

Real men protect others around them, real men wear mask. cowards afraid takes protect others around them.

NY TIMES worthless trash see people gym wearing masks: ""well guess I'll see work soon""
They know muscles make less likely get Covid see. haha hA ha prevent second wave, Sweden putting new measures mix. recently resumed contact-tracing quarantining, backed expanded testing capacity. Europe, strict 14-day quarantines slapped contacts infected people anyone travels parts Europe. Sweden’s quarantine, however, seven days live infected person. test day five negative, quarantine end then. Children symptoms exempt quarantine. contacts simply alerted may infected. urged work home week, get tested even slightest symptoms next 14 days, extra careful seeing elderly relatives World Health Organisation bristles quarantines shorter 14 days. Swedish approach measures people live least year, says Dr Carlson, vaccine yet. goal stop much transmission possible without unduly disrupting people’s lives, especially ways harm mental physical (not mention economic) health. Transmission happens easily within households, people contagious first week infected. Sweden’s quarantine policy could stop bulk covid’s spread—as long people probably will. cash payment available quarantined people cannot work home, taxi drivers. government pays antibody tests anyone wants one. positive antibody test exempts quarantine hassle getting tested covid cold flu-like sniffle. measures look lot laxer systems across Europe. whether less Sweden ends achieving become clear next months. 

This Swedish way. Recommend effective balanced measures rather excessive draconian measures, educate population give economic support affected (paid sick leave three weeks without doctors note) people best follow them, voluntarily. Let’s hope work again. Netherlands well, president even called ''intelligent'' lockdown California website props includes questionnaire helps decide short videos explain more. obviously whole prop. really helpful. It’s anti-semitism point. complaints following basic rules lodged every religion, every time reported. religion gets special pass blatantly ignore rules.

Where people defending Christians who’ve ignored rules? anyone else.

I understand response claiming it’s anti-Semitism, every religion criticized. american politic crazy Whenever go walk rural subdivision, people about, usually surprised least someone suddenly appearing front coming behind suddenly. Joggers bicyclists worst, none ever wearing masks. decided always mask avoid unexpected. Yeah mean gonna die anyways, maybe little quicker Also add update, understanding orders magnitude flawed, understood double actually 10x larger. disease 1 order magnitude worse flu, needs IFR 1% 2 orders magnitude worse needs IFR 10% worst COVID might 1 order magnitude worse highly unlikely. Classic example person understanding scientific terms. Actually I'm Germany. trip. Totally expecting Dutch people, probably know western countrys good. must admit Germans seem resposible nationality. MANY TIMES TEACH JEW LESSON OLD MAN?! Whenever see someone wearing mask street, get nervous they’re going go nuts attack me. That’s aggressive shit gotten envy you. We're suburb Vancouver WA can't take 10 minute walk without running dozen people more. :( USA states lower population faring far worse. OMG picture. He's wearing little paper mask man parts. that's rationale wearing masks works: 

if low risk person, get infected remain unaware it, completely symptom free, deciding wear mask effect others higher risk group. Directly indirectly, passing others til reaches vulnerable person. 

I'm reasonable good health I've wearing mask outdoors since March. 

First, huge percentage asymptomatic cases around, need act preemptively we're infected. is, want bring rise cases point.

Second, basic good manners. helps elderly ill feel safer outside, societal benefit orders magnitude bigger personal short lived inconvenience wearing it. That’s point. point is, general mortality higher winter. People’s immune system generally worse mental state. Winter historically season death, lesser extent still is. think comes fear. Stupidity lead lack self-awareness fear make people think solely especially crisis situations. course dealing administration gets removed median, mean. Im personally big fan Dr Doc Doctorson, Chiropractor PHD Art History. Also Germany. Haven‘t NL myself, friend mine went recently shocked bad mask compliance NL is. doesn’t. know study regarding 10 cases Feb, right? Positive messaging hasn’t worked, negative messaging ineffective

The traditional response situation shunning. Thanks beating correcting font above. paranoid least. stating happened, yet nursing homes exposed like everything else was. believe it’s actually spelled stupidity first time hearing true. crowded street, would wear mask outdoors keep everyone lives big city. even big city, day time would affect many people would around you. meant license, bad Lock EVERYONE down. That's flu vaccine does! Reduces risk flu 60/40% 60 percent coverage, 40 percent chance flu.
But reduces severity long lasts. Already 1M+ human deaths caused Coronavirus...sorry sharks, beef bats us It’s likely virus utilizes mechanism parasites infect cells. that’s I’d assume. worried several years ago, got virus gave brain fog symptoms linked covid. degrees really pulled? mean, understand licenses practice such. wouldn’t expected degrees though.   really depends. outside walking, wear mask. running biking, don’t, actively unpleasant. (And don’t say it: well aware safe, etc.). top that, masks kept dry running 10+ miles, mask would soaked anyways. Yup. come back dead. crazy.. Yes, really ""lazy selfish"" people driving super-spreader events like one white house really way characterize it. makes sense OP angry see awful people around him, like see it. seeing neighbors absolute worst, disheartening selfish lazy are. liberal lives one stricter states amazing summer. Plenty outdoor activities festivals, brew tours, porch parties, biking, hiking, door movies, porch parties small street concerts.


It’s almost like self imposed lock head want play victim. wear damn mask live life normal. Stop acting like spoiled child. world changing either adapt get left behind. movies portrait America unrealistic. realistic thing would main zombie country Im fucking tired this. Say want comment, trump deserves among 200,000+ died. actions risk countless lives everyday deserves whatever virus him. surprised. digging cardiac inflammation, pneumonia etc pretty common post influenza complications. tend blind eye get life.

We also seem lose kids flu Covid, least UK stats. Yeah. Lets trust latimes since never misreporting vested interests. couple months later come back round two like north east right now. Whether that's caused changed towards colder weather, children going back school little bit - knows. CT gyms indoor dining open summer saw uptick, fall starting number going northeast states got hit hard back april things fell almost nothing summer. fucking owl?  truth that. BC closed clubs, banquet halls liquor service night 6 weeks ago became clear that's virus spreading. We've seen curve bend back doubt it. struggle real. burn leading quitting, leading terrible staffing ratios, overwhelming remain. poor wife strong this, I'm proud her. According Fauci sometime back July explained every vaccine trial currently mass produced time EARLIEST would ready despite waiting end trial Spring 2021.

And that's one vaccines actually work! He's typically awake 11:00 comparison come from? could remember it? Everyone watched past 7 months. religious organizations trying genocide ? Well yes it’s partially true look way. extremists want general lock barring consequences. rich/have rich parent’s/are life accomplished set COVID/don’t worries responsibilities life mean others. friends already taken large financial hit first lockdown. can’t imagine would happen second lockdown would announced feeling milions people worry. can’t force people stop going work continue education think shutting everything best option. way think it’s tragic fucking dumb way fight virus said earlier serious negative financial, mental many consequences. sum think Anti-COVID stay-at-home-for-life groups detached reality may indirectly destroy family different ways. Nevermind figured out. guess 6 weeks funding. say Wisconsin unemployment site directly article fema lost wage assistance program Remember shortage hand sanitizers beginning January? would say good news someone recovered COVID. What's wrong you? possible do, way unhealthy, strenuous exercise like running mask extremely unpleasant.

Running outdoors maskless absolutely big risk, even lapses maintaining 6+ feet distance. interactions extremely short outdoors.

Moreover, masks required even runners outdoors, fewer people would run absolutely know would deliterious health effects. So, look samples thousand people fairly thoroughly tested, mortality looks like ranges 0.4% (Diamond Princess) 0.3% (Ishgl) even lower 0.16% East Asian locales Iceland.

In Ischgl diamond princess case, 80% asymptomatic.

The IFR sensitive thoroughness testing accuracy recording COD. probably there's much variation.

There's major issue sensitivity antibody tests, blood tests miss way people mucosa tests pick up, lot IFR looking blood tests results.

But looking Africa, fur reason seems shrugging (very young population, non urban, high UV, etc). lot number infected sick might Africa.

There's also fact numbers coming China deaths unreliable, places like NK.

Mortality areas like UK Sweden seems inflated fact really mild influenza season last year, would left tens thousands elderly people us first nasty respiratory virus hit them.

My advice look places this, die (herd immunity time being).

Ischgl outbreak Feb March, combined antibody tests put number positive 42%. feeling touch higher tests missed few, kind moot next point.

Out 1.7k two deaths (before understood steroids positioning). That's community mortality 1/850, depths winter vitamin lowest, idea treat it.

My feeling looking community mortality around 1/1000, maybe touch less, whole year, IFR probably landing around 0.25% total.

TLDR:

The basically mercy crappy data collection. Look smaller complete samples. yet they're finding virus, likely seems actually case. he's referring message. \*it\* also spreading covid BS. 

for references personally, prefer ""they"" ""he""? Yea Eric needs go church Sara needs hair done live German side border confirm. went shopping Vaals last week couple things shops there, can't get here.

You could tell Germans were. ones wearing masks. Absolutely, it‘s great feeling confidence clear goals again. around boost. I‘d probably deep hole weren‘t that.  small, white city. dark headed half Biden rally side town. Distancing wearing masks. 

They remember one Trump's first moves approve pipeline bulldozed archeological sites project fraudulent paperwork begin with. administration actively making things worse.

People underestimating much better America could Biden administration. Came comment! Maybe folks paranoid are? Locking nursing homes right move DeSantisto focus on, helped obviously. need lock entire state. see virus is. scary vulnerable less scary healthy young people like myself. stayed home 2 months learned virus less made sense. live life now, precautions, I'm well past hunkering phase. Florida's economy fine. 1000 people day moving here. Wait, Macron taking seriously *still* they've many cases? pro-business reason this? I'm trying least put logic it, even twisted. scary, even heard russia internet cut separate totally plausible given data people could already sick January around world (before year, China heck lot international tourists around globe already). 

Still waiting sources claiming negative lol. lol.

you wish Yes positivity rate 50%. really tested number cases would much higher. Terrible, terrible thing say. Everyone know Netherlands takes vitamin supplement, everyday. first thing doctor's appointment asked taken VD supplement. really serious it. really say 14 days without local transmission. Community transmission defined transmission cannot determine source infection. NZ community transmission 60 days. single incident community transmission 11 August prior 102 days since last case community transmission. checked lately myself, time I've looked past, France well behind US testing. think they've improved lately though. dont care...i going delete something accurate. feel americans, who's going pay debt. small business forced shut down. sad. states responsible. Canadians soft like Charmine. Anything goes ""Canada best country everrrrrr"" downvote. Canadians titty babies. Inoculated; Bless immunity. went 2 hours rush Limbaugh today cut off. rally take place Monday, even requires drugs less 90 days. (beginning of) end almost here, already.  Where's Putin vaccine? Yeah, girl! can. Yeah, would exactly effect two years lock down. Thats impossible. that’s true, considering Russia 2/5ths population US, Russia worse then.

Per capita looking bud. Lol 80 new cases per 100k people wide brimmed hat. freak people much It’ll cancelled. 2nd week symptom reprieve steroid high going wear off. could tell interview Hannity. 

It’s probably 50/50 chance Trump go back Walter Reed next week Please cite statistic. think make sense you. good ole ‘MERICA. would limit amount tests drop numbers instead increasing availability. need faith...

Prayers thoughts.

/s Donald would happy spread lies virus last winter. followers would point lack hospitalizations excess deaths proof virus big deal. country's leadership can't prevent COVID-19 tiny offices, White House (54,900 sqare feet), faith prevent contain COVID-19 America (3,800,000 square ***miles***)?

You can't.

We need change leadership. us hate Trump, us don't. boil pure facts, politics aside, clear need change leadership America.

So read article then? reading comprehension think article literally people like you. fact going head, devastatingly hilarious.

This projection. Chère France,

Ça va aller, là-bas???

Amicalement,

Une cousine américaine work want keep hospitals actually functioning, yeah complete fucking psychopath wants wave goodbye everyone requiring cancer care/COVID care/pretty much every single ER care hospital yeah really work killing enough people reach ""herd immunity"". call show state nothin. Also, ceramic floor tile? Could lowering strength 5g towers? /S It’s *that* bad, bother

Thank mate vulnerable also least likely actually make decent immune response vaccine. Protecting much still relies herd immunity mass vaccination.

Plus, hell lot people “at risk” people like think. high blood pressure, obesity diabetes, half US adults “at risk”. Maybe took survey apply didn’t ask much symptoms don’t think understand concept exponential growth community spread.

It’s also hard compare democratic countries authoritarian country. Cool story live Vietnam, believe Vietnam’s number, case study prevent pandemic. speaks nothing “it’s widespread, do?” asking prove negative. burden show anecdotes ""I sick January"" people actually COVID flu. California’s OSHA division fined Amazon $1,780 failing provide adequate coronavirus health safety training two facilities, one Eastvale another Hawthorne.

That's INSANELY LOW. Like. that, like 3 Amazon workers' day told CNBC plans appeal citations.

WHY? bet lawyers bill worth Cal/OSHA issued $1,870

Oh, best written article: says 1780 Key Points 1870 body article. Somewhere along way somebody missed typo No, Trump administration didn’t think worth preparing for. Obama left preparations place Trump admin destroyed. happened vaccine? 🤷 economic crisis.. tests imported huge devaluation argentine pesos recently, added huge economic crisis longest lockdown world Repost yet airplanes airports became crowded again. reasons? embarrassing.........these fools.........as idea coronavirus exists............is really bad dream?..........have died sent bizarre version hell? Broadband internet essential working remote choices boonies limited. lockdown get numbers 0. That's utterly ridiculous stupid. country that.

The countries done right done exactly this, worked. valid plan there.

Only stupid realise .... look. Mafia always fucks Italy way. know 
but went wrong Italy w/ covid Mafia  
unpreparedness (and still are).  
we get rid virus buy vacation property. nothing one suspect Covid. long stay away people, benefit testing. Tip one domino over, tip another... Gulf Mexico? hear weather really nice right now. say laters already lol dude accounts keep trying claim simply regurgitating words experts like Fauci anyone functioning google machine find experts actually saying prove wrong. log find something else do. Flu season Aus pretty much non-event thanks lockdowns precautions, there’s hope guys north saw coming. Even then, five foundational values proposed underlie public education, idea shared ""spaceship earth,"" custodians planet's ecological future, first one. value has, seems, gotten system. others--not much.

He says many things shake left right. There's putting Neil Postman box. see predicts happen dominance tech social media. easy read, short, quite stimulating. hope enjoy it. virus find denial holding now. Smaller country means possibility even flow new cases health care system actually one best.

But 8600 day - better say 80 per 100k - much. health system hold long. health system robust enough. exactly cocky complacent mean? Ireland cautiously opened summer save hospitality tourism industries total collapse, would lead pretty much every bar, restaurant tourism business permanently closing. 

Mask compliance close 100% shops, public transport etc people practice social distancing public, main issues household household spread bars &amp; restaurants (which briefly opened closed again). 

The simple reality thing near impossible control without everyone living miserable robotic drones. vast majority people best Yeah doesn’t make sense. like July. know people like that. understand think entire world playing along sake US politics.  neither, another accessory.


I think people insecure perception fear. though people masks fear something. 

There's also notion placing mask face making political statement. interpret refusing mask equal opposite political statement. 

It's tool get us B. different scarves gloves.  Agree. mean Idk enough say asshole like vision company all. says article itll free... Oof... Breathing problems joke hope well possibly circumstances. circumstances require go public (I've social-distancing like Bin Laden), I've definitely run challenge trying hydrate wearing mask. Based that, scarcely imagine effort pain involved unable get enough air. That's purse know you! You’re kidding right utterly impossible. UK isn't, unless know something don't? cabinet restore basic functions back government, pay much income taxes garbage continue. surround competent people, bunch people contributed inauguration fund. No. won’t vaccinations, it’ll case numbers. “average joe” doesnt even really display dramatic symptoms. almost half people asymptotic, expect restrictions end around summer likely. Yeah disease covids meager IFR destroy mankind sure. Bullshit. Probably safer cruise ship 70% infected another one strategy's prevent 2.2 million deaths. seems lot countries break biggest one-day increase cases deaths. Pretty much failed contain virus, herd immunity starts kick in. rally planned Monday . achieved full idiocracy Donald you? ? I’m sure that’s related said. It’s cheap way cheaper Disney. Enforcing ppe sake public safety restricting anyone's rights freedom people use argument finding excuses want want. opinion different asked wear shirt shoes enter establishment. pretty rough illness December, somewhat convinced may covid.  

Some friends traveled country November thanksgiving.  also got sick around two weeks later early December.   Lasted close month finally it. I've saying since May. 

Remember people saying ""This year's flu seems especially virulent year""? probably due people infected both, course know look Coronavirus. Yea Trump’s boss know people doing? Jeez admin Vile. Reckless endangerment entire country punishable. Yesir. Yeah outfit awesome wish figure could wear let's use justification thing somehow convincing moral high ground! know old famous hero motto ""let's sink level!"" Yeah that's cute think guys passed first wave. Oh right, excuse wrong reply, you. shopping ? restaurants ?

haha Oh yeah true.. forget rural areas don’t anything take granted big city. Yeah, better nothing everyone dies. submission removed because

That. Another politically motivated stick spokes trying save lives White House 

[NPR's interview BARDA whistleblower Rick illuminating White House's handling covid response interference government agencies public health politicized.  Regardless feelings Biden.....this shit normal. end well. Villages population 128,000+ retirees. 50% population 65 years older.  wow. thought stupid article, yeah... pretty reasonable really.  Way poorer countries testing lot us, buy it.

Also, announced early months pandemic ""Neo Kit"" fast cheap tests available back May. Well, never heared again... Amazing set candidates?? lame fuck 2016 election hence Dickhead Don. mean test negative maybe things without fear you’ll kill someone, like go grocery shopping ever else essential. backtested stored samples found anything prior January. people died influenza/pneumonia symptoms December dying influenza/pneumonia. See bad faith looks like. You’re taking man well known life long problem stuttering, always struggle words times trying convince people he’s senile. 

How keep shit Canada.   user exist Ah yes, remember us said mocked thoroughly ""delusional.""

Anyways, said time thing say now. think tens thousands people traveling Wuhan every day virus spreading rapidly, we're kidding ourselves. There's ton talk college students spreading now, obviously lots Chinese students US went home Christmas too. 

My mom classic COVID symptoms early February, June figured could gotten it. I'm teacher, one students see often daughter college professor... teaches bunch students Wuhan traveled back holidays. whole family sick January, two weeks later mom gets sick. We'll never know truth, pretty darn plausible. Everyone suddenly got medical degree...

Lemme Google studies..

Thanks, rando guy thread zero medical knowledge! know what's going happen kids got covid 40 years now? know lifetime effects single year? That's impressive/s  he’s going God he’s going take everything him. He’s declaring citizens country longer allowed call home. Funny absolutely everyone pegged, still think pulling deception. almost zero examples transmission airplanes. assume air flow driven, think terminals much bigger risk. Urban people. You’re likely find higher proportion people use public transportation cities rural areas, people cities likely registered Democrat herd mentality, dear POSTUS called it.   Biden recruited bunch ex bush people also wants Bloomy charge world bank

We screwed ive literally fighting suicidal urges Oh, good. Things starting get boring all. completely utterly fucking can’t talking CDC, every fucking country took advice fuck ton better us, it’s CDC! 24 yesterday. don’t *quite* people per county, pretty sparsely populated compared places like Florida, though 2/3 residents live three 53 counties. governor taken reporting, similar White House done, manipulating make look favorable—and *still* bad. general numbers trending upwards. western half state hit super hard one taking seriously. hope finally puts rest baseless claim 20% infected enough herd immunity. wish true, clearly not. Ever single person responsible charged deaths every American died virus. tbh gotten anything... read even comes? 400 pages 😄. need pictures videos breaking down. netflix special would great! 

Until something like happens gonna stay dumb. Trust! Reading 400 page manual %10000 percent reason send like people like me, majority read it. U feel me? exciting!! commiserate that. can’t understand makes sense heads, oh god frustrating. yes. months no. psychotic...November 3rd can't come soon enough, ***have*** remove cancer white house! trying friendly people gone schooling know read papers since getting doubts commonly acknowledged things.

So here's one prevalence clotting autopsies patients another talking covid patients experience higher risk factors related pulmonary embolism caused clotting review study clotting disorder appearing yeah man, go off. know anyone caught H1N1 know 3 people died Covid-19. Public transports crowded (if even available) dense cities. areas already solid blue. Deep red regions tend rural. Agree, see mixed schedules becoming commonplace. one enjoyed lot.

I don’t see companies sticking 100% remote...but know? Lancet corrupt China-worshipping WHO! /s truly absurd government actively working public’s interest health. get away this? many people realize don’t give fuck us? wonder they’ll start wearing masks now? Americans convert everything US equivalent stfu change? Healthiest guy world gets covid? easiest fucking thing world. requires almost zero sacrifice would almost certainly save lives. chimp 2 brain cells could see it’s good idea, guess that’s much intelligence ask right now. don’t want family look like white house title. world wouldn’t situation successful control. vaccine takes year ready? there’s plan still control lol believe this. friends talking bad got hit flu early 2020 general feel like higher average number people calling work sick (and I'm pretty young work demographic). Since symptoms similar cold flu, definitely believe cases innocently, incorrectly, misdiagnosed since really know COVID time. Makes wonder ever may asymptomatically (or maybe lucky hell) constantly traveling/flying work October 2019-mid-March 2020, airports huge conference hotels boyfriend back forth Asia work well. guess innocence bliss back (except could've better prepared). many people thread talk Europe like country. I’m surprised trump doesn’t burst flames prayer ...are honestly going tell one friends invited island **wait pandemic** go?

I'd concerned medical emergency enjoy staying long. shorter visit would fine. think argument person replying centers around true, provably not. cdc authority begin with? honest question. impression lot policies implemented states themselves. Turns unrealistic part movie president conspiracy theorist different characters. 777 new cases today, previous record 681 new cases July Idaho’s top five case totals occurred past four days**: 670 Tuesday, 666 Wednesday, 667 Thursday 777 Friday must died alcohol poisoning typing zombie. sociopaths, whole lot 'em... particularly smart ones. Oh hate one Wuhan batman inject little bit bleach get back work. small isolated island nation, pandemic easy mode New Zealand. Even then, island nation suffered least two major outbreaks, spaced many months apart. 

That's good track record, bode well future outbreaks, especially if/when international travel resumes. 

Same every country, unless governed totalitarian dictatorship react outbreaks literally shutting country involuntarily locking people homes inside quarantine camps (like China Vietnam), countries need approach thing much proactively. example, need distribute Vitamin residents free-of-charge, provide face masks, demand mandatory testing every international traveler centralized 21-day quarantine, etc. far, many countries implemented measures, inevitably ease them, ensure second, third, nth wave infection. 

To least, seems like wasted effort. either strictly enforce preventative measures end pandemic, accept fact inevitably encounter wave wave infection given whatever insufficient controls country implemented, any. realize hospitals Ontario operate like 100 percent capacity times right Spencer’s Cox ashamed show face public. person asking Utah trust governor performance leadership crisis despicable. 

A half man. shadow. pinnacle Utah Milquetoast. Defund police.... require force everyone wear masks, too! Imagine dumb need order cdc tell need wear mask. Imagine dumb pandemic, don’t automatically wear mask. would *exactly* time start revolution overthrow particular version government, unified population. 

A significant percentage population supports fucking madness. Gleefully, militantly so. malicious incompetence

Perfectly put easy control pandemy big population since chinese people 2 options: obey disappear. 

/boooooooo 6 months away final worst offense 2020 continues inexorably 2021. people working together close proximity many times likely infection window USA, Brazil, Russia...hmmm, wonder common. Wahhh cant popcorn wahhh lifes hardd Came comment fashion. Dope hell Yeah, think countries scan phone come in. proves app, proves safe, gives better ways contact trace. 

The failure country united fighting this, literally carrying solution around hands day, disappointing beyond words past officially sci-fi novel, yet feel cooler lmao allow one party amend constitution without least partial support party, going bad time. happens, next fascist movement America successful backed law shortly after. 9/10 buzzwords, congrats find hilarious practically guarantee real idea talking about. 'insane conspiracy theories' government listening phones reading email?  Dumb ignorant fucks, everywhere. Real life dystopia never cool video game dystopia :( Sorry hear that. idea might got it? got attended rose garden ceremony never anywhere else exposed people? two states....I’m afraid you’re gonna come say exactly mean. Trump needs tried murder. Agreed, wouldn’t say moving goal posts. isn’t football game set rules. don’t get decide normal returns. People dont anything important anyway boo hoo cant go eat boston pizza boo hoo pandemic fatigue. go hike fat fucks ongoing experiment productivity remote workforce began six months ago. Companies data always needed convince remote workers productive. strongly believe claim permanence sincere. Maybe watch movie. idea got CDC would come take charge quickly everyone listened advice.

I don’t know think CDC good guys anymore. incompetent ineffectual infection first arrived creating faulty tests insisting tests go them. messed testing patient quarantined rescue China well quarantine management.

Add completely missed infections coming Europe issue hit NYC.

They incompetent spokespeople early on.

Honestly, think mean well doubt competence even without interference. think begun strong competent might popular support political interference.

They aren’t great heroic doctors. specialized bureaucrats. Speaking impression overall agency- I’m sure CDC, like WHO, excellent career level workers, aren’t shown.  Hope death race remains low. They’ll regret discarding masks hit winter..  Wait that! nothing? mean countless lives saved one nations lowest cases per capita deaths per capita. Oh mean airliners stopping flights China, days later Trump issuing travel ban allows Americans virus hotzone come home screening? flu also deadly failed shoe bomber. Based logic always require masks public transport, pandemic no. gives shit international travel want pay attention, want bombarded stupidest goddamn fuck headed shit every goddamn waking hour, presidency reality tv keep fucking ratings up. said? hell happened here? Sure, numbers go way down, doubt they’ll keep pushing masks. reality is, even vaccines, numbers may still high. Wearing masks simple thing reduce numbers deaths. “cons” mentioned pretty far fetched. seen single child harmed wear masks. I’m around ton time. could care less respect ton. Every 10 days throughout thing good rule thumb too. Community testing free however 4-6 days think follow example you’re setting think so. Honestly don’t know virus works spreads . knowing Trump yelling talking he’s definitely passing people spreads air. Remember Herman Cain said “fine” passed away Covid? Curious know what’s gonna happen Trump. sore throat lose voice cough it’s hard fuck talk trying cough. way Trumps rally gonna go well . studies showing people got covid sat 3 rows ahead someone virus even everyone, including infected, wore n95s. gonna really try tell super safe? 

No sealed box multiple strangers safe right now, that's fact. safer long bus ride something? Sure, I'll give due air systems, sure hell getting plane going speak positively idea loved ones talk either. safe sit close people, even infections *can* happen away they're less likely. Let's forget even though CDC took back, fact covid spread small particles readily go 6 feet indoors. 

Being commercial airline passenger unnecessarily dangerous right now, sorry. needs change? fucking IQs. There. Answered.  have. Man need literally stop eating every damn animal.

I find treatment killing every damn animal disgusting. think VP debate proved Kamala ""democrat aggression mode""

I really wish fought attacked Pence. understand want evoke ""angry black woman"" stereotypes. misogynists attacked anyways facial reactions Pence, might well attacked real. Yeah, look mask mandates China! Oh wait... Yeah... never fucking steak? 26 years voting, mostly shit. problem that, unfortunately, likely new norm many ways unlikely change 2020 gone. That's article actually Johnson said. saw headline went wtf... use local transmission / locally acquired, anything CT.

The ABC Australia done yesterday too, ""28 days community transmission QLD"". 51 days since last locally acquired case unknown source month since last local transmission quarantine. 

Sad rookie mistakes 1 year pandemic! Here's problem. people advocating reopening U.S. **have plans fund put stuff place national scale**. things need place anything else happens end delayed spread vulnerable anyway. national home delivery program available seniors 1/3 Americans carry high risk conditions? national senior hours mandates? National N95 supply vulnerable? National temporary housing plan multigenerational households? anything, exposes advocating reopening absence measures cruel and/or measures protect vulnerable central aim public health responses COVID-19. way example, nursing homes use staff acquired immunity perform frequent PCR testing staff visitors. Staff rotation minimized. Retired people living home groceries essentials delivered home. possible, meet family members outside rather inside. comprehensive detailed list measures, including approaches multi-generational households, implemented, well within scope capability public health professionals. Fall wave here. anyone read article? China used drones equipped loudspeakers tell people wear masks public. happen US, would shot drones down. people go one allow UNLIMITED SPREAD. Congrats! handmaids tale? Made propoganda probably  read parts relevant you. cannot informed electorate without providing information people.

This Oregon's:

http://oregonvotes.gov/voters-guide/english/votersguide.html D'oh! getting number? You’re way Found Ted Cruz's... Wait thought said lizard. Never mind. keeping track predictions experts. cases Florida show spike next 3-4 weeks, know experts exaggerating matters. need get Presidential bus pass. heck tanked SUV thingees. Let take risks everyone else must. Secret Service protecting guy intentionally endangers himself, Secret Service citizens. AFAIK, Donald granted license infect, despite perverse joy seems take new super-power: ""COVID-Man"".  spanish said dont see true end pandemic 2 years Fauci quietly moving goalposts 2022 without alarming Americans im going get downvoted hell saying 2021 aint year return normal This. Maybe herd immunity term looking for. Maybe universal infection, total contagion, widely endemic. say because, comment says, ""herd immunity"" may exist. may false hope; comfortable fiction. say, ""many immune"" mean, ""everyone gotten sick."" Oh, like even emotional capacity deal American numbers. 200k died like 10 months. can’t comprehend average 800 deaths day. That’s basically beaten genocides, much bloodier wars Americans ever experienced. 1) published stats test developed, far specific used elsewhere
2) controlling gets test sending tests minimal risk populations (WFH, transit, seeing friends). odd. Trump Rona still goes rallies without care world. Maybe Pence dying doesn’t want people know We're Bush cabinet members investments scanner technology companies. security measures always theatre-for-profit. bad Trump officials investments mask companies...we might action did. fucking masks? WHY?! want people die? really get play here. I'm seriously wondering something trying kill old people pay social security. Home office deduction applies current tax code business owner. Employees eligible. vaccine. started mass vaccinate population? Nope let rules fit need. South Dakota number cases adjusted population New York has. would rule works New York need applied South Dakota worked well. /s first memory Biden Anita Hill hearings, like way dealt obvious sexism treated Anita Hill without respect. done anything change mind desires equality, one foremost requirements decent candidate.

Additionally, would preferred let Tara Reade say, quashed media. find personally kind creepy, seems still stuck 1990s comes sexist behavior.

I agree Yang's assessment Trump symptom disease country, think Biden work mitigate that. fear end Trump 2.0, someone even worse 2024. 

Biden work maintain status quo, appreciate return normalcy, feel much lacking country support equality. dire need social evolution, make steps direction, fear destabilize nation. need leaders whose eyes looking future, past.

Please note, I'm interested arguing politics. trying convince anyone, answering question.  Public transport really exist poor rural areas Times bleak - hope hero kept world entertained many years, many come 

stay safe **Florida man** dunno. Reagan pretty good kind thing. remember hearing study done Boston’s homeless population found positive 37% sars-cov-2 antibodies. 

Here: You’d surprised. see statistics. lived Utah life. Well neither mormons represent you, problem maligning them. Yet somehow nothing say egregious breaks masks/social distancing. must hurt way? would work transportation crosses states? Like plane California take mask off? fly Texas masks again? fuck get hazard pay?

All got couple shitty lawn signs saying thank Isn’t Pence scheduled visit today too? might positive Rose Garden event? context, alarmist BS? Seems like intentionally dramatic claim. 

If need help, please get some. Sure! phone interview listen closely hear trump clearing throat lot trying hide coughing. definitely Rona Hey, Babiš long Trump. says eats lunch laptop, go outside breaks (lives first floor apartment) many less coffee breaks compared office. hope takes breaks least, got wife kid. argument everyone (including boss) knows nothing else covid. guess lot people might stuck similar situations unhealthy work schedules home days. grazie favourite pub play tabletop games, actually exists. lock us go business, late. spend whole weekend working home office wake home jailed, probably.

EDIT: Yeah care, nothing collapse enjoy life still allowed to. Ill punished home jail commiting crime, late freaking February one job understood why. Even March still ignorant, despite us interacting public.

I even told wear mask gloves tried. got laid off, joke. Right. overall days down. cases high article suggests, backlog processed. got swine flu getting flu shot (since H1N1 novel) never skip flu shot flu prevent, want to. fever 101 since child never want fever 104 again. feel like body breaking.

I think people forget awful things feel takes weeks recover. here. immediately mask get tested especially since live family Damn that's 10 times peak declared cases. fair caught 10% cases peak. got 234 deaths Sep Oct.
4,994 deaths all.
Something ain't right spreadsheet however - everyone else reports lot 234 deaths! proof job market stronger. thT extra 10k taxed much heavily California subject higher COL. Vlad saying too? blame karen problem false hope makes people careless, end may result deaths. truth always better option. Sorry, need look Vietnam handle virus, take someone lives here. one outbreak Da Nang hospital deaths occurred 2,500 foreigners city tested - zero positives. let’s assume one local case Vietnam, since bars, clubs, sporting events literally EVERYTHING open, wouldn’t see community spread now? Use brain moment this. Lol tech, work big red phone/hbb company UK within call center, still working home, review date april, yet we've started employing people strictly working home, I've phones month helping train new people up, home working going new normality, tbh, enjoy now, miss social aspect thanks apps like Teams &amp; skype, still speak peers daily Bob, Tim lives Africa job dollar day, fired. fucking pub?! mad? understand close colapse care beer?

This issue.... 800 per Mio 1.1 Mio infections India 515 daily India 13000 daily This. need remember: THINGS BETTER.

But vote. working whole time checking computer / email? takes breaks day family, gym, etc time range doesn’t seem bad since work day precovid least much commute time. welcome wish mom best! Capitalists care revenue costs, quality irrelevant. Oh definitely will. We’ll blow past days. 23000 total, 515 today Found Tool fan Yeah 8600 30% suprising even me. Fuck, whole weekend work guess israel style lockdown. even manage go pub still open :( 8600 apparently. Absolute disaster. It’s taboo though

That exactly point. Social change come barrel law. comes actual slow, steady, continous change social mores norms.  Nope, you’re one. I’m nervous get again, whenever get random sore throat get tested. think consensus there's like ten times actual cases confirmed. 

No, isn’t consensus, please provide sources.

You’re looking review literature finds 10 fold undercount. exactly happened Wisconsin, exactly getting ready happen Michigan.

Ugh. first place made masks mandatory country. Every company people working home realize jobs thought done person outsourced another country. Hooray capitalism! Vietnam done tests per confirmed case country, total number cases stand 1,100 last checked. score doesn’t matter all. important number percentage positive tests. 31.4%!!

If 1 mio tests number 5k.. different story 17K 5k positive ;) Thanks help. Prego Party like 1918! No, federal government busy blocking state expanding testing happened. career? 

If minority getting promoted anyway, advance career going jump next level skillset time current company. I've company years I'm fairly high right beneath C level, bunch crossover knowledge great relationships already built, STILL feel like career basically hold whole year this.

You sound like one people sweating middle managers desperately trying justify salary WFH flattened hierarchies physically. guy spreads propaganda place. Never creditable source. exactly, since would want make sure everyone vaccinated lifting restrictions much. still spread, problem vaccine 100% effective, especially first try. even healthcare workers vulnerable people vaccinated, everyone else still needs protect ones vaccinated still risk. anyone looking lose weight, checkout helpful community r/loseit. Dude, want make argument look actual test used. able find false positive negative rates, speculating proves nothing all. really try beat USA everything. Given said data Australia's winter much help thought would pretty obvious talking data elsewhere southern hemisphere. Yes, national shutdown necessary shutting state level stupid. lock one state like peeing section pool next step would send email university

you should, eventually, soon possible. 
it's slow ;) got kidding “wearing masks closer normalcy” 😂 life [The major genetic risk factor severe COVID-19 inherited Microsoft janitors, electricians

Not going needed physical offices close no??? Trust hahah called crazy person office emailing HR VP needed set remote working ASAP wearing mask back late February keep philippines that. hear they've riddled corona. Also: cracked 40 deaths yesterday, country size US would translate 1200 deaths. deaths infections 2-4 weeks ago, current spike take 2-4 weeks hit death statistics. bad news. boring repetitive work think RPA going take place outsourcing. teach robot easy work keep people local complex tasks add job duty review / confirm results robots. happy know Biden moderate Republican voting red either way. Trump claimed taking hydrochloroquine preventatively months ago. Maynard trust. Czechia, Netherlands, Belgium, France UK actually going lock not? trajectory new cases totally shocking. Europe 110,000 new cases today 1,000 deaths. looking like March/April unless authorities act quickly. bizarre, republican men could sport hidden hitler mustaches they’d get board mask wearing. many cases per million? need compute India units. US. Please brick seriously can't remember wasn't, surely can't get hospitals packing covid patients I'm seeing Walmart grocery stores ""require"" masks. don't. They're supposed fight it. 

But again, say, live rural area never great, dropped lot.

Also, find anything weird, system use advisory map designed never let county go purple, also week cases rising throughout state, counties dropping red status.

I believe Allen County week well.. almost trends going up, met criteria go red.. literally trending up.

Not catastrophic anything, still kind worrying. said taking it. almost definitely lying doesn’t admit lying.He’ll probably lie lying. Good luck Germany. fear long winter.  Seattle Flu project found flu earlier, Republicans shut down.

And come on, planes arriving Wuhan January. Wuhan quarantined January 23rd, knew made North America. Lol Google pseudoscience. Claiming science settled clearly demonstrates idiots clueless falsification (The basis modern science). ones destroyed reputation science. Argentina many days 400+ deaths. 515 deaths day new high, hardly surprising given numbers been. population Argentina around 45 million, slightly Spain. Wow!

I went outdoor social distanced event month ago. realize much tolerance built socializing prior pandemic, 6 months that, tolerance gone stand around bunch people. Yeah everyone obeying mask distance rules, socialize left drained almost immediately. Florida basically laying part timers. nothing California. problem hotels closed reduced hours. still paying furloughed full timers medical insurance. jobs. union basically give shit part timers offered sacrificial lambs. damn shame pay much dues full timers. 

They calling back full timers shuffling around. high enough seniority keep roll. re-cast. 

We got word loosing half kitchen staff. people location since opened. problem others higher seniority. people probably end going attractions get others place.

Every single attractions CMs (both pt ft) called back within first month. Hell right bus drivers working rides. fully expect lay pt attraction hosts start shoving random CMs there.  :/

I can't tell talking game current political climate.   NYC blue city ground zero.

It's step, first step. think made can't seem find Ireland can't theres way control flow individuals entering country ensure quarantine government run facilities. complete false equivalency comparing NZ / Aus Ireland regard people always say would impossible America population, opinion easy sit ass couch couple weeks regardless many people country. Yup! coupled new data robust immune responses even asymptomatic cases suggests could heading pretty strong showing vaccines comes preventing clinical COVID-19, even don’t prevent infection. Pretty exciting news. think Trump already afflicted b4 caught Covid-19.

So much worse. 

Just ask Nancy. Brit London, masks public transport compulsory (by law believe) months. first people reacted like necessary slight inconvenience...now it’s accepted it’s part travel 2020 you’re happy wearing one find alternative modes transport. also need wear masks shops, restaurants, bars etc law. It’s mind boggling administration STILL enforcing compulsory mask wearing known virus-spreading settings. understand world decided collective amnesia CT scans. switch RT-PCR CT scans positive confirmation Feb 12th major step China curbing epidemic. CT scans decidedly less accurate RT-PCR advantage never overwhelm testing capacity using existing CT infrastructure.

The recent discussion able find [this article Stat April nothing. Like, there's articles like, ""Here's we've learnt since April proves CT scans used"", dropped map discussion.

Now, even retrospective analyses China's success, we've forgotten used CT scans adjunct ensure never faced overwhelming test capacity key part response.

Again, probably countries use CT scans possible, must part China's response. China's response consisted entirely welding people drones loudspeakers vague allusions confucianism. that’s thing. Trump may voted one “guy” really elected whole administration party, blue red. Trump narcissist really contempt everyone except demands groveling serve survive. Really seeing evisceration Republican Party governing entity, way Gingrich, Norquist ultimately division tea party. got nuthin left they’re aging out. Look prospects millennials, gen z whatever comes next. Think they’re gonna choose bullshit “compassionate” conservatism protect wealth old old fashioned. Hah! ""Ooh, that's good idea...""

 -2020, definitely true Ireland could close borders Irish British citizens. neither NZ Australia. Citizens residents still enter country, 2 weeks quarantine govt run facilities. UK Ireland already require 2 week quarantines citizens returning hot-spots. error letting people quarantine honour system basically, making blanket policy arrivals. party system. decent sirloin table people tossed way people know difference fascism socialism let alone democratic socialism, but, authoritarianism totalitarianism perfectly fine them. China North Korea claim 0 cases viable kind criminal charges? literally made virus spread kill people this.

They basically said ""hey virus spreads closed space, wear masks closed space!"" logical route virus go, too. 

When novel, pretty deadly. everyone exposed, future exposure either results disease relatively minor symptoms (a cold). New generations exposed they're little (and result nearly asymptomatic/have mild symptoms). get older, retain fully sterilizing immunity, enough minor symptoms they're reexposed every years. fucking fuck???? Insterestingly, ""public private temporary gathering"", guess includes bars restaurants, 4th place 10%.

It ain't happening, good luck bro. virus defeated point

How defeated happening right now? someone sure Covid earlier date, stop saying ""I probably"" get antibody tests done. Stop taking guesswork helps investigation kind thing immensely.  
  
The flu last season absolutely incredible. rarely get sick, worst I've life; gave wife, extremely sick. bad coughs weeks afterward, even hurt breathe while. antibody tests done, came back negative; starting 2nd week January (I even know exactly contracted from, unfortunately). always Covid, nobody assume without tests confirm it.  
  
It's also people get flu shot year (please, it). Imagine getting flu like last year, getting covid top it. Sounds like Butte county. people wealthy enough homes fire suppression systems. I'd happy people wore face masks cold Wow, even 1918 flu pandemic, masks required public transportation. like he's trying lose election. bother control cross-over event never gonna pandemic-proof? strong pandemic response fact turn tide infection sure way keep world safe. That's blame placed motivation keeping world safe. still are. Nearly 200,000 ""pneumonia"" deaths year. Last 5 years? 50,000 per year. Oh, did. replace ""hispanics"" ""liberals"" exact plan. one sick care think ""human psychology"" respect controlling shit virus. ""Human psychology"" needs changed, controlled.  too. shit. every job done remotely. people don’t want vaccine work. love shit. Double-check 0s! 3000 people died 9/11, 214,000 died far covid.

It's already close 1000 times deadlier. know mean! Italy Spring horrific even though I’m Greece you’d think didn’t happen.
Good God people went Italy awful Spain too. 
I really hope it’s wrong way get follow scientific advice rational ones us know  look Argentina even works Yeah likely order magnitude really Yes, ""This fine..."" territory. Remember commercial property tax receipts plummet along gov't services. Oh dear, please, ladies first. literally ""behind closed doors"" republican response would kill liberals. Sweden lead leftwing government.

The goal approach taken Sweden save economy, put restrictions could held long term. eh Ducey fan general live took seriously absolutely necessary May whenever hospital capacity like 93% full. get attention form likes, upvotes, retweets; economy vain. major economy land borders thousands miles long.

Vietnam says hi also warmest winter seen years. snow storms deal (iirc least none Covid) mild temperatures. Well, America standards. 👏👏👏 uncommon, people love like something going louder feeling depressed.

I I'm back office 3 days week. I'm one office either. GP said heard lot people say too. That’s true. need police reform. know won’t come republican bootlickers that’s Biden shot now. 
\- endanger lives people lock up. 
\- break law lock I’ve message friend city she’s late 50s husband lupus meeting friends bar tonight.

I’ve given replied nice time type behaviour that’s driving forward.
She’s lovely person hope stays healthy take precautions think outside saves them. like people Rose Garden did. think really important biden one term willingly step down.


What describe normally cycle, 8 years. Maybe 4 memories still fresher people still politically involved keep blue wave going.

If Dems grab 2 consecutive terms that, would give 12 years fix gerrymandering, disenfranchisement, major voting issues. wE'vE dOnE eVeRyThInG cOuLd Public transport minivan South Africa - far common method public transport - required windows open least 5cm. 

In addition wearing masks, course. Lol that's fucking hilarious sounds great. certain extent, definitely leave shit online available I'm actually working, I'm definitely working 40 hour weeks right now. No. people super spreaders, not.

My friend got corona contaminate baby husband North Korea ban talking covid. Trouble still learn even get it, another similar virus comes along line would still same. live Greece numbers low compared rest Europe. hot humid, summer climate people go out.

In fact Greeks whole taking precautions they’re forced law too. regular marches people crowding bars etc can’t explain countries around us experiencing thousands day infection not. daily numbers given true? 

I wouldn’t rely vitamin D.

I know get us winter social distance, wear mask, hand hygiene eat healthily possible, exercise even it’s walking, importantly ventilate home naturally much possible. Even winter especially become sick. elected Mick Cornett. Oklahoma wanted true Trump Republican, got one. build roads drive on? Lots comments seem Americans though... Ok, sounds good 2 spaced pneumonia ?  happy medium somewhere, I’m sure. He's one. school administrator said quote went bit viral, something along lines ""If overreact may never even know, enough painfully obvious."" Anyone superspreader, given right time place. Badly, hit 5.8k per day, still days see restrictions working. new restrictions probably Tuesday. 
Some normal hospital operations already getting canceled bad first wave now. Uh, that... *likely 12+ months unless know something things getting way better real soon Covid spread easily. people infect everyone, others infect one. u r worried 

Step 1 Guy 1 super spreader

Step 2 Husband 1 asymptomatic spreader contaminated wife

 Step 3 Wife coworker asymptomatic spreader

Meh. low probabilities events Hopefully job close country cabin dream, otherwise I’m cool. supposed surprised Godless savages? that’s correct. Closing pubs qualify lockdown. None places lockdown. one knows smoking nicotine, effect real statistical glitch. havent checked new studies while, search nicotine /r/covid19 see older studies. Never used dip myself, guess quite similar snus. well killed old people first time around lower world! We're lower world! Unacceptable! Yikes. Govt plain killing Muricans. Parts Spain, England, France Scotland.... think Italy well guess issue consider workplace somewhere 'spend time around people care about' suggest another comment. However us give rats ass coworkers perfectly content save commute time work home.

Commuting hour day sounds like hell me. talk coworkers actually like slack. Sounds like extrovert crave emotional support. pandemic created heaven us introverts hand Yes death rates lowering ... 62 per day vs 71 week ago. need panicking. 

France reconsider investing healthcare . icu population ratio super low. 16 beds per 100k vs 25 USA even 34 Germany. France subpar Husband sounds like moron. wonder y’all hitting numbers team. 1week home, 1 week office. Loving it.

Next job, I'll make sure there's solid ""work home"" policy place. figure origin virus WHO? give Nobel prize. Screwed lol. come future? No, needed done get coronavirus spread down. described things done Swede, follow authorities's recommendations. done conserted effort together slow spread flatten curve hospital beds enough lower positivity rate down. 6-8 months road enjoyed positivity rate less 1% 1-1.5% different areas quite time. 

There slight uptick spread confirmed cases right now, i.e. small pockets outbreaks. Idk latest figure think Swedish figures right far European countries, significant outbreaks. That’s narrow view. Many small business gone under. provide families? We’ve lost business city we’re open 45-50 years know kids personally covid, they've missed school since March around here. “Soviet nation” lol Tends happen things struck lightning. Everywhere. Strange enough, lightning seems destroy lot things large land masses. Seems care nothing fire departments, fire suppression system, near far neighbors are, rural urban. Strange indeed. No, won’t White House baddies? I’m trying find video saw back, armed anti lockdown protesters lady trying get names won’t tell asks Facebook live chat figures calls Rodney isn’t amused. 

Can anyone find link? Google fu failed one. 😢  called regulations. Deplorable conditions open air “wet markets” increased risk happen believed happened. trying make argument countries virus similar conditions, makes sense. know november 3rd, asking TIME.

At time nov 3rd? got clapping UK. last week paid shopping bill big ol' round applause. largest ER RI completely full COVID patients tonight. administration gone (if -I believe come November) needs brought tribunal crime humanity mass murders. “Passengers required snog other” Sounds like blimd man would say. I've know multiple people aggressive somewhat antibiotic resistant pneumonia November/December 2019. struck peculiar required multiple hospital visits. options referring to? Basically NZ everyone sit/work home duration first lockdown. Simple. Also effective. NZ border open NZ citizens permanent residents; 50,000 (out total 1 million living overseas) returned date. NZ also open foreigners qualify various exemptions. That’s Texas model lately. Lines wrapped around block get places Hold accountable? There's total lack accountability system. Trump shows, office, four years whatever like become nominee party more. president almost omnipotent virtually impossible remove president office. systemic failure worrying about. hears immunity start showing effects around 1 % death, right? Trump finally something right Much like millennium bug. Nothing happened shit load work went fixing issues beforehand.

Can imagine people militant 'I'm updating BIOS Dell Optiplex'... Would weird... It’s unfortunate ass tart found way military, statement seems really harsh unfair majority servicemen women. It’s “military types” act like this, it’s racist, domestic terrorists. Please don’t conflate two. Mate realize fire suppression systems usually installed everywhere? private island mean hut living. alright? problem private island rich. throw away get new one. Follow. The. Money. realize makes mandatory public transport system US. That's crazy always thought colds continously. Went got allergy panel done.

I'm allergic dust. Fucking. Dust.

Once got air purifier house took allergy meds cold went away. Thanks mate! too, know absolutely crazy time right now. Hang there, 2020 almost over! Biden going put competent adults charge making decisions. top 5 democratic candidates holy shit difference be. refuse believe it. evidence ""science"" speak of? knew would fall back that, bots predictable. USA FUCKED right now....... get idea? stating facts licking ""Chinese boots"" it, better living denial touch reality. feds wont demand mask dont localities demand one. live. Must public transit including uber/Lyft. Y'all forget things states. backbone Republican agenda, states rights govern themselves. Also think cdc rule even president extreme circumstances. came Katrina said president didnt enough turns CDC whatever necessary save american lives sound crippled. takes time adapt around physical change. 60k cases again. disaster been. news

Mostly created Western mass-media. They'll buckle pressure go under.

You can't compete competitors slashing one largest expenses.  Suggestion:

Why take picture super spreaders know submit AI recognition software.

Maybe super spreaders physical feature common, AI could learn recognize them.

Then run AI software facebook list potential super spreaders world. 

Then isolate super spreaders weeks. voila! Without super spreaders, corona would disappear, like sars it.

World: ""Thank u gebrayel1985 solving corona problem!""

Gebrayel1985: ""oh that's pleasure! ;) easy anyway"" definition ""continent"" varies. talking landmasses there's separate Europe Asia, there's Eurasia.

If talking ""parts world"" Europe-Asia border goes along Ural mountains, Caspian sea, Caucasus mountains, Black sea, Bosphorus Dardanelles straits. case Russia Europe Asia and, said, majority population lives European part. Racists logic they'll cling onto anything might justify racism. covid-contact apps used US? heard anything it. 

I think like 10 states agreed use Apple app kind wasted opportunity since vast majority states using free travel states. would think would create false sense security too, phone showing warnings, reality almost nobody around use using app.

Apps like never accepted US privacy tracking concerns. country live in! Idk, living corrupt fake communist country sounds pretty bad guess know masks removed time, including boarding, right? saying be, just... be. saying people dying ""covid fatigue?"" That's behavioral affect thought. 7 day average deaths pretty stable since September 18th. surge. also things... 🍄 normal people outside china, CCP = people china. so, wait decades people rise throw CCP out? Money lost earned back life lost permanent... get this, possible get matter do. cold. There's getting rid colds. Why????? reports say fur coats get cheap (seriously, thousands mink die still harvest pelts) Guess like Croatia better then. county 200k population 17 new cases. county (Primorsko-Goranska županija) Istria dealt Covid-19 well, considering tourist presence. Yet schools going back person companies forcing employees back offices working home fine months already. going get worse. Good, sooner get herd immunity sooner nonsense stop. article contribute inaccurate testing kits. Holy shit. First time heard sub. jumped straight commented several threads. Let’s see long ban me. places easy find past numbers new cases... Oh yeah, right wing people America always say ""well Swedes wear masks"", Swedes this, that, conveniently ignore key differences Sweden United States. Mainly we're probably far away unhealthiest country first world, far away poorest first world country, multigenerational households far common can't think decent response cause gonna get banned I'll say thanks guess... (Banned cause would mention harm others.) covid giving us heartworms? hope gets better soon one family 1%...? Say Trump, certainly do, one saving grace decidedly* violent*. personally total coward, thankfully seems coward even commanding military. thinking get worse... RI much worse neighbors? guessing here... Chinese eat red swamp crayfish. Totally. feel bad Swedes two reasons. One Tegnell arrogant imbecile really messed health many. Two really take criticism health authorities strategy personally. They’ve drunk much koolaid can’t see used tool right. That's Umbrella corp wants think chinese found Wuhan doctor talked patient 15mins could catch covid19.

An obvious extension rule spend hour bar 6-feet someone covid-19. nearly certain catch it. April common estimate things considered. Worst case scenario late next year think we're forgetting something here... social distancing, maybe? think people would agree social distancing harder, fatigue-causing. Trial Ivermectin Plus Doxycycline Treatment Confirmed Covid-19 Infection

Dr. Reaz Mahmud, Dhaka Medical College


Summary:

- 183 patients ivermectin+doxycycline (plus standard care) arm - Ivermectin 6mg x 2 tablets = 12mg (given i.e. total 12mg dose) - Doxycycline 100mg x 2 tablets/day (given 5 days i.e. total 1000mg dose)

- 180 patients placebo arm (standard care)

----

Ivermectin+Doxycycline arm had:

- older demographic (usually worse)

- males (usually worse)

----

Mortality:

- 0 deaths ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 3 deaths placebo arm

- (i.e. placebo worse)

----

Number Patients Early Clinical Improvement (at 7 days):

- 60.7% patients ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 44.4% patients placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.03

- (i.e. placebo worse)

----

Number Participants Late Clinical Recovery (requiring 14 days recover):

- 23% patients ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 37.2% patients placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.004

- (i.e. placebo worse)

----

Number Patients Clinical Deterioration (1 month):

- 8.7% patients ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 17.8% patients placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.013

- (i.e. placebo worse)

----

Number Patients Remain Persistently Positive RT-PCR Covid-19 (at day 14):

- 7.7% patients ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 20.0% patients placebo arm

- p value &lt; 0.001

- (i.e. placebo worse)

----

Adverse Events:

- 2 patients gastrointestinal issues (Erosive esophagitis) ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 0 patients placebo arm


Minor adverse events:

- 7 patients gastrointestinal issues (Non ulcer Dyspepsia) ivermectin+doxycycline arm

- 0 patients placebo arm

----


Takeaways:

- Ivermectin + Doxycycline better outcomes

- Ivermectin dose 6mg x 2 tablets = 12mg (given once) - lower end dosage covid-19 (although typical de-worming). studies typically used 2x 3x dosage higher. Also clear Ivermectin taken fatty meal (which ivermectin spec sheet gives 2.5x bioavailability taken fatty meal).

- Results better seen Remdesivir etc. - yet getting scant attention (also lower interest clinical trials pharma since generic drugs little financial incentive). work Ivermectin thus coming outside U.S./Europe (Bangladesh, Peru, Egypt). many active cases UK have? Can’t seem find data anywhere. Tbh might truth behind this. covid nobody household including grandparents got sick. Idk though Fuck made laugh said months ago, said georgia months ago, etc. means literally nothing Earth business, come back 2 months. Thank you. would around 2-3 times more, around 0.2%. Statistical fluke. Yeah, totally take seriously first. former chief epidemiologist literally ""just flu, bro"" bandwagon beginning. pale man Pan's labrynth. greedy feeding poor well. No. fault CCP. fault local government officials allowing exotic animal trade continue wet markets despite decade warnings potential pandemics. fault local authorities keeping quiet beginning. fault CCP government owned companies quietly buy transport PPE around world reporting virus WHO. fault CCP allowing companies within country manufacture ship faulty PPE medical supplies around world leading infected health care workers people walking around infecting others faulty test negative.

It nothing race people, actions leaders. Fuck yourself, dipshit. :( disagree said, complaining racial bigotry paragraph said ""don't like Chinese culture"", lol? know, country 50 ethnic groups completely different cultures? Yeah quick check see individual pharmaceuticals even half way process. ways vaccine ready year. immunity still remembered immune response lesson impact virus. body can't stop getting reinfected CCC short time remember fight it. question is: viruses well another ""special trait"" like attacking CD4+ T-cells? Couch forgetting hospitals urgent care centers.  whole ""China changing test criteria cover numbers!"" meme.

Never mind using ""clinically diagnosed"" actually increased number cases daily, that's easily covered doublespeak. would say would impossible thing America, population.

Not *size* population, rather kinds people make up. Specifically 42% look someone says Coronovirus real, disappear miraculously, big deal, one gets it, *catches coronavirus*, says likes people afraid it... decide want charge country. Trump's logic Spanish flu, Kansas flu, likely case. doubt he'd okay that.  Possibly. would keep bars shut restaurant service fairly limited wouldn’t to. That’s really key imo. Plus masks course. Agreed, prepare get downvoted others.

Yeah, nonsensical excuse. US land air borders closed non-US residents since start outbreak. Schrödinger's virus. ""not bad"" worth shooting people over. 60% positivity rate, that's insane! religion source ignorance. rural places weird people weird US also closed land borders visa office, entering US non-resident virtually impossible. idea people keep using excuse. lack co-ordinated plan federal level US failing contain outbreak. *US ""politics""* **Criminals** china indebted world let loose. think states United States forced fall winter, national lockdown. *US ""politics""* **Criminals** Thanks. photo seen place lot socializing going among retired people pre covid.

Guess read article see mentions many tested.
Thanks again! GOP'S plan kill many Americans possible, thin herd type deal? Trump casually fuelling racism calling covid 19 “Chinese virus”. fascist authoritarian better.Got it. shit gave double pink eye don’t think ever pink eye life must mild did. eyes still bloodshot. March 20th tickle throat Thursday began walk Lord Savior Jesus Christ. tell internet friends death bed it’s got broke ways never thought possible yo. 33 last November November look like I’m turning 43 joke us don’t think ever 100% pre covid 60% positiv ratio tested persons. somewhere else statement 20% population virus? Infection control 101: Populations higher risk areas must prevented travelling areas lower risk.


That EU open internal borders truly marvel modern transnationality. epidemic, borders slam shut.


Australia one nation, yet internally movement steeply restricted prevent areas high risk infecting areas low risk. entirely sensible mandatory quarantine put place area diverse Europe. gotta pump numbers up, rookie numbers, Britons seen much higher comes point ""politics"" more. I'm exactly sure point is, *well* point we're now, certain members current party power USA committing capital crimes, members *other* main party haven't. specific party's willful actions inactions cause citizens die, that's politics; murder. actually like third-rate TV show.The first man found body identified murderer stupid police. 

 used think writers stupid, people proving even dumber writers. 

 live city 400 kilometers away Wuhan, 1,000 cases whole province.I understand virus could jump us go 10,000 kilometers United States. time Europe 10,000 kilometers away. 

 two possibilities. One someone deliberately spreading virus around world time.One Europe America ignored long enough ,just think flu. 

 Wow, know one believe . I’ll give last response.

Projection? Believe want. brutally honest swear sure it. wouldn’t ever say unless rude, beginning assumed didn’t wear masks. 

I admit reading said telling I’m giving excuse. owning exactly happen. However note beginning assume/excuse/insult me. yes didn’t accuse thing (not wearing masks vs anti masker) congrats? You’re perception “arguments” super negative aggressive place.

Now please tell it’s saving lives taken stance rude asshole. Nobody allowed burn down, loot rob businesses threaten communities issue something.

However, right everyone called except banner BLM, point. President Donald Trump touting new silver bullet COVID-19: monoclonal antibodies. “They call therapeutic, wasn’t therapeutic,” [said video tweeted five days receiving experimental treatment biotech company Regeneron. claimed felt better immediately. “I call cure,” said. “It’s cure,” said again, defying whoever might told *please* say “therapeutic” instead. 50% people elderly.

Also, know 700 positive, know 700 symptomatic 12000 symptoms. literally can't prove know many tests completed think another lesson USA considers best advanced country world. proving day day stupid one. dominant nation becomes unrelevant may actually associated stress, Covid. forget stuff time, ever since grew up. lol ‘unprepared’ poor choice word Honestly idea. didn’t press issue it’s favorite topic discuss them. close. Everything WFH ""with manager approval"", really way always been. Plus lots people good WFH situation prefer go back office. might make steak [Retail be? 700 cases divided 128000 population .0054. Companies save realize could hire bangladesh. don’t think sweden really goal beginning. didn’t take seriously. are. part. F White House trump. America. sh*t. hole. still cross state borders, quarantine 14 days cross government run facility fined fail quarantine. know mean nearly replied differently feel what’s point they’ve access information me.
I also know take piss following rules.

This joke husband watch zombie films laugh it’s always preppers survive help ones that’s didn’t listen 😂😂to make end film. federal constitutional right travel interstate. 

What part constitution that? Funny right gets mad federal government doesn’t go cities protests stop assembling. 

But say it’s breach federal power require face masks public transportation worst pandemic 100 years?? grateful Australia likely single winter vaccine likely available vulnerable (though there'll almost certainly second southern winter vaccine widespread). call BS. probably know couple people, maybe heard family member friend friend claimed passed COVID-19, fact reality likely co-morbidity person advanced age already risk. 


In words, probably heard someone passed away ""natural causes"" may may involved regular flu bug (of Covid-19 nothing than). CDC still pass anyway like FDA(or agency) vaccine approval? recall said georgia sometime back zombies movies people make super studios mistakes, grounded reality, hot damn 1/2% 50% crap coming from? choice simple. Decent human not. anyone say great though Give rest. He's million times better now. guyss longer reproachable Holocaust something? endangering public health. Jail them. looks like main character, we’re NPCs ways, Covid might God’s way possibly killing low-information rural voters anointed modern generation global fascist strongmen.

Like righteous plants ... M. Night Shyamalan movie... justice ... invasive. OMG Hitler ordering edicts allowed to. OMG GUYS! Like guy knew tried living remote mtn cabin thing getting drunk noon couple weeks. realized working then. Even worse. guy suicidal.  I'd honestly love know hell else could done get it. What's really interesting 7 day trend search phrase cough, looking states near top search volume. places reports indicated poorly, places try pretend like problem. There's quite few. First Minnesota would epicenter. Yes Gwyneth Paltrow terrible health much. 

2. government arresting conspiracy theorist. 

3. Americans listening authority figures medicine experts. think it’s possible testing availability higher now, catching cases fatality rate. I'd bored skull week Grab stuff left behind!   decide animal eaten?

Everyone eat deemed acceptable cultural everything else disgusting? lmaooooooooo im cackling lol go dangerous neighborhood state come conclusion? Might want take look Wisconsin. actually making expectations look like wishful thinking bad. keep track excess deaths. Peru actually much worse 87k deaths. like 0.26% ""White House Blocked C.D.C. From""

Is sentence exist. fucker even failed germophobic. There's already enough coverage ""fake news"" think us quickly adjust back normal. It’s nature social. 

Now, may never drive interstate again. recently first time awhile fun time. Seemed like hardly anyone around paying attention speeding way normal. said mainly annoy everyone else think that’s bullshit Wisconsin here, no, none. *insane* jump past week so. Like 20 cases day, 700, one county. I'm even exaggerating joking. parts state beds field hospital thing. 

And yet, republicans calling recall governor mask mandate, state representatives fuck quash it. 

Hell, look many Washington DC high levels gotten it, still denial. honestly think deep belief nothing can't accept wrong. feeling even Trump died, they'd say covid. “This report adds growing body evidence mass transit safe proper public health safeguards place,"" much nice positive fly US 6 months continue college remotely. Could cheaper Canada depending state. Try seeing cops, mask on, mandatory mask wearing premises getting pissed saying wear masks. world infected virus successfully controlled? Hey man, want say completely agree *like * take shit *they're good people. Keep fighting good fight. There's never american movie CIA bad guys.

I think half dozen films top head CIA bad guys. *Syriana, Good Shepherd, Bourne movies*. yes Political war, actual war. absolutely room compromise modern American politics. GOP realized 80s, confirmed 90s, benefiting since. Hopefully DNC point well. change subject mark snarky comments that...but right----we saying would cause explosion cases not. Ok include aborted fetus cells. hate become talking point left ""gotcha"" directly harms public image science.

The drugs tested cell lines derived fetal tissue decades ago. cells used scientists world honestly they've probably mutated much culture they're barely human cells anymore. Fuck, I've used cells various purposes lab. cells physically drugs. None pulling heartstrings hypothetical aborted baby back 70s. Smart. That’ll show em. people stupid looks like hacky writing. capitalists care profit now? gone *next* Easter....? ""Because fuck you, that's why! lol"" - Dumbasses WH, probably guaranteed symptom also this. Yep. That's meant well thats proven dumb move. despise Joe Biden. didn’t hesitate vote mail ballot. Canada increasingly authoritarian every year.

If look European diaspora numbers comparable. 

Different demographic's cultures effect rates transmission. January - expect restaurant closures, stay home orders gathering restrictions July 2021? There’s gradual return knew life pre-2020. It’s switch light..... ok many, particularly young people quicker return normal 75 year old diabetes. dumb theory everyday theory seems wild: Since lot fogging around masks risk spread, virus even serious fact CDC's warnings facts would blocked White House? like saying Polio bad people recovered. Nevermind percentage permanently crippled stuck iron lung rest lives. Morning imbeciles WH days. Yeah they’re experiencing second wave... point remains much better US Brazil metrics. 1/3 cases per capita, 1/5 deaths per capita. Maybe one they’re really old unhealthy That’s convinced early March false negative Covid made decide stay home completely 3 weeks case. Atypical pneumonia, fevers, etc...but woke one day everything tasted like nothing lasted 2 weeks. asking every medical professional knew symptom 3 days later, headline CNN. threatened send police stop federal funding. wish app could filter news Trump.  Companies start using bargaining tool lure good candidates away competitors. IMF, World Bank regional investment banks made billions loans available many countries help fund coronavirus response. Argentina treated differently maybe due government's fiscal issues? Man, I'd hope not. Poor article, even worse title.

Where details differentiated lockdowns / isolation implemented provinces, cities districts China, based known numbers community spread different points time? 

Where details contact tracing done?

Lmfao. state western media, even ""respected"" journal, wonder even non-dumb minority people west fall back tired tropes memes, wonder people getting infected dying droves west. white town country safe say 75% Trump voters Yet, we'd still people complaining ""muH FrEedummz"" 

America, Fuck yea! Amirite? 🙄 Trump lose potus election big GOP support Trump...Senators Congressman must prosecuted failing protect citizens scourge. ""vaccine""? least got grifting part right. Negative, meat popsicle. Bernard get much done opinion. policies fly Congress tbh. Outside age, don’t know people mean. think lot people talking bad options haven’t researched Biden’s career nearly enough. They’re following crowd, living echo chamber. one face earth perfect record precisely everyone wants, hits plenty bullet points history working well others sorely needed. 

Now it’s age couldn’t agree more. excited put 78 year old office. blow CDC reason? hit escape button show. This. Masks protect people indefinitely. help. eventually touch face. touch something it. Population density concentration people high rise buildings can't mitigated. Right? needs talked more! hate fucking shit administration. know joking, since lot comments serious replies, US can't deduct home office expenses employee can't deduct home office expenses local governments didn’t mandate it, federal Dexamethasone, steroid heavy-duty steroid. first couple days often makes feel invincible, comedown make lethargic, moody, irritable, etc. Typical dose 10 days. know probably tongue-in-cheek comment, state (Colorado) put priority order vaccine, essential lower wage workers pretty high priority. plan indication states handle priority order, you’ll likely get wish. link useful supposedly pro life regime deliberately kill American people cities. wouldn’t piss people fire. Fuck death. Trump Jim-Jonesing determined take many people leaves Oval Office...one way another. Here's fucking question. 

#WHY? Mega corporations run everything get cool cybernetics.  uniquely COVID tho. Paywall.

Can someone give word word Fauci actually says article? see media publishing headlines like time - it’s clear want us think it’s masks stay-at-home orders 2025. Yo wtf frustrating, that’s literally got covid March. Think sums feelings decently well. 

Though, first exposure auto-tune news episode..So, mildly different. really chaps ass places ""requiring"" masks single fucking thing enforce it. Literally every business sign saying require masks without doubt telling narcissist put fucking mask middle Walmart Target gas station convenience store.

When county put mask mandate sheriff literally came publicly said would enforce it.... fuck wrong world. matter time someone takes swing store I'm fed shit store worry about.  Social distancing? chance. People wearing masks they’re sick? There’ll probably increase. there’s absolutely way healthy people going start wearing masks flu season. Besides, there’s flu vaccine, isn’t like covid defense. Thank too! Hang FUCK FUCK FUCK CMONNNNN PEOPLE HELL WRONG YOUUUU. Wear fucking mask n GODDAMN PLAUGE RAT HANDS FUCKS SAKE Trump makes president Garrison look better better. H1n1 infected 68 million Americans.......... 1/5th.........

I know anyone that's covid personally. Anecdotes useless. MAGAts, Constitutional amendment protects right infect others? wealth power ensures safe effects blocks many consequences life people face life. 

Great wealth political power ensures **access** best healthcare, **effectiveness.**

mean sensible rich trying bolt holes:

**The Island Brokers Overwhelmed: wealthy want escape pandemic private, isolated jet disaster bunkers amid wealthy tap personal ventilators, on-demand doctors fight disgusting, helps covid took medicine away people diseases **does** help:

**Doctors Hoarding Unproven Coronavirus Medicine Writing Prescriptions Families**
Pharmacists told ProPublica seeing unusual fraudulent prescribing activity doctors stockpile unproven coronavirus ""A strange game. winning move play."" Everyone understood what's stake first wave told. look facebook feed MAJORITY people deny even real least claim baselessly tests faked force lockdown. Thinking i'm gonna call sick work weather storm home weeks. entire Central Europe seems serious trouble.  BYEDON 2020 White House needs held accountable crimes. boggles mind evil done 4 short years. ride stops emergencies. Crying emergency. 'Herd Mentality' - Jesus, even get right. Finland. think hospital admissions give true picture infection intubated people. 2-3 weeks ago 500 according media.
I’m implying Greece hiding anything I’m saying don’t understand city numbers low often 20 day majority taking precautions 
Yes shops wear masks people crowding bars socialising inside protection. could go take photos videos prove I’m saying.
So makes sense honestly never asked take part testing program like others countries know anyone either.
Apparently city monitor sewage?.
But last couple weeks Universities returned let’s see happens? 
But going behaviour everyone around what’s happening neighboring countries figures make sense. 
So maybe phenomenon? 
Because know British people came holiday went back infected covid week numbers counted infection rate took tests landing U.K.
That 22 people personally know infected here. know fact numbers correct. bet Trump voted Biden. Hey, White House. get it. totally suck. Biden 2020. Nobody knows really. went 500 8600in month. mandatory facemasks.. sub 100% needs shut down. report entire subreddit? Nobody knows really. went 500 8600in month. mandatory facemasks.. gracious, sir, Eternal Glory forever province cultured man, would rude steal greatly deserve. Unfortunately, taught address President, VP, congressmen/women, secretary state, etc.... ""The Honorable Mr/Mrs/Miss so-and-so"". Marines we're forced honor office regardless idiot might occupy it.

Republicans America represent dwindling voter base yet hold vastly outsized power due antique system government. formed divide rural urban nearly now.

By 2040 things continue 70 100 senate seats controlled 30% US population. power rural vote 18 million democrats voted senate races Republicans yet INCREASED majority body democracy that's minority rule gives rural voters power. they've shown they're far aligned fascist government urban counterparts. show time time again.

Why would Republican politicians EVER concede participate process would reduce power?

They never will, ever. KNOW rely voter suppression, gerrymandering power rural votes Senate maintain power. They're craven unscrupulous stupid. benefit participate amending constitution make system government representative overall population?

It done spite NEVER concede participate broadening voting rights.

We're going another Reconstruction era going pretty. 

There's reason Montana Dakotas much power NY California.

It's becoming untenable people starting realise that. 

And say ""the house represents democracy Senate republic""

Well century.  already fascist majority power, written law already matter. don’t guns Exactly. T-cells remember fight infection long antibodies gone. soon virus detected, antibodies antibodies supposed reappear, think. see people wearing masks around chin. see people wearing masks nose, chin nose. Dunkin Donuts day. Zero staff wearing masks correctly. walked away. ""proof"" science. evidence. fact know ""proves"" clueless issue. 

Mask mandates zero noticeable effect US, Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium etc etc look daily infected case rates mask mandates (even 2 weeks delay). look comparable areas (i.e. natural experiments), masks seem effect. example Orleans Jefferson New 

As distancing, seem ignorant issue well. Probability viral transmission depends viral load. Viral load depends viral shedding rate, distance duration. Unless standing front someone 10-20 mins straight, probability asymptomatic transmission 3 feet low. 

You need ""educate yourself"" liberals say, stop spewing nonsense. classic fash logic. Full contradictions, shouted full-throated staring eyes see blink.

Also, Yes, get numbers 723 15-5 months, amount false hope, stress waiting every day numbers, idiot beach determining fate 5 million people horrible things mental health, economy fucked well. targets really near impossible time frame needed contact tracing team makes us look like third world country. 

Melbourne succeed getting numbers down, deep nearly us terrible mental health scarring, Please don’t use us example, do, prepare hear two weeks every two weeks. blamed things fate?

Run rabbit run flu.  Twice much say? noob try 5 times-India  impossible.

If Coronavirus U.S. October, pandemic would started months earlier, since without social distancing numbers go exponentially.  northern Illinois test results 4 7 days old. mean numbers nearly week old?   Every country ""beats citizens head propaganda"".

Your current view China Chinese people result country's propaganda.

Look, even news media selling us sub-headline. ""China's protests rarely political...""

Umm, protests kind political. 

As understand it, Chinese people elect leaders. simple terms, elect local politicians elect prepresentatives elect President. choose top official.

In America, simple terms, elect local rep join party, party decides elected President. choose set officials preseleted us.

In UK, elect local official joins party, party decides becomes top official, Prime Minister. British prople choose top official.

The real difference relationship officials people.

Incidentally, Singapore democratic country. based British system citizens vote local officials form party party forms government elect Prime Minister. 

The relationship government people similar China's relationship people electing local officials, trust government perform take care national interests.

In West, relationship people government adversarial, meaning neither trusts other. political involvement citizens due distrust misalignment career politicians want people want. low trust governments, political.

China many Asian countries high trust hovernment, reduces necessity political activism.

The political systems different. Cannibalism never right choice. Dishonorable discharge. I'm Marine disrespect unit, uniform USMC stands for.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* think that, know brain fog is. specific symptom like feeling tired distracted sleepy.  learn ectopic attracters change closed systems (chaos theory) then, apply ""studies"".

also, specific antibody, titer, control, etc? No, hope people outside Asia might start wearing masks protect sick buildings might also use convection ventilation (warm air rises ducts) extractor fans installed. still national policy this? arguing even longer did? like really educated either, trying blame everything fate. one country lockdown currently... USA clearly evolving backwards  measures need enforced. Netherlands government 'strongly advices' population stuff like wear mask shops, go quarantaine contact infected person, far know break quarantaine get away unpunished. we're shit job moment, people afraid consequences comply COVID measures. Germany they're pretty much us, except enforce everything high fines, case number per capita 5-7 times lower Absolutely! 250 daily cases whole Germany summer, around 490 new cases day Berlin alone. N u realize countries Europe local government regulations too. problem, won't. get best possible care, unlike commoners  💜 Seems pretty spot based what’s article tbh. translation? Considering huge market around data people voluntary gives private enterprises free, wonder adamancy protect personal data outside concerned minorities.

Like happening rights, people remember now. may look excuse avoid personal inconveniences community oriented attitudes rather actual rights. Hold Corona noticed Denmark’s case numbers rising since early July? 

Hospitalizations didn’t increase significantly early September. Dk stabilized number per capita Sweden. 

In context don’t see current development worrisome Denmark Sweden - Sweden seeing steady increases Denmark seem stabilized now. 

Denmark’s number tests also tripled since July, never noticed Danish authorities media using explain rise new cases. 

My biggest worry right Sweden point Denmark month two ago. significantly higher level already less control since Sweden test significantly fewer per capita don’t test asymptomatic contacts don’t trace isolate contacts nearly degree. Exactly! live Netherlands booming case numbers great example locked hard 3 months cases stubbornly stayed around 5-20 range weeks eventually decided made sense open up. 

And luxury following NZ, Taiwan etc open land border UK, quarantine would waste time near impossible close border UK fucked implement similar system. 

We're also forecast deep 0.4% year far better Europe Native Americans commit mass shooting European Caucasiod community atrocity did. report, published online reporter Liz Whyte Center Public Integrity, says increasing case counts among 12- 17-year-olds 10 Idaho counties “suggests outbreaks counties may related school openings.” also says test positivity rate high among 18- 24-year-olds Latah, Madison, Ada Bannock counties, house Idaho spokeswoman Gov. Brad Little confirmed Thursday received report shared state’s regional health districts. health minister said country hopes start mass vaccinations October, Sputnik V vaccine already registered another due registered later month. speed Russia’s vaccine rollout elicited concern scientists safety efficacy.

The high numbers could well reason rushed vaccine. 


The economist lists excess deaths 6 times reported Covid-19 deaths. 22454 deaths could 929 deaths per million still increasing.  say nations need ""lockdown hard"" beat virus, nations lockdown hard. Aside USA western nations managed get cases massively, % peak (knowing missing huge amounts cases back march/april). Yeah, even ask it, plebs. Go back work. Sorry sarcastic phenomenon.
Sadly yes I’m sure it’s going increase time majority wake it’s going late ivermectin, doxy combo made durka...

they've working ivermectin now, im actually surprised done it. ""Human psychology"" needs changed, controlled.

Holy fucking shit big yikes .... literally worth cost even BLACK DEATH 2.0 let alone disease bad is. [George Carlin: Religion  left right wing Governments done poorly, look Brazil, Spain, Sweden examples right wing governments who've done bad right wing governments. 

You say Corona causing economic pain rather lockdowns simply true. People told work, businesses forced shut lockdown measures. soon lockdowns implemented western nations saw literally 15-20% drop economic output immediately. Haha pm chat me, let's make future better lol Well, obviously, suits people others. 

For me, hate stuck four walls bedroom day every day. Also hate lack social contact, I've totally lost touch everyone immediate team members even barely chat anymore, drab meetings everyone says need back sitting silence. Productivity also dropped across team we've lost creative spark really get bouncing ideas other. 

I can't imagine must like grads either, they'll miss loads professional development wants spend 20's cooped childhood bedroom?  can't read Italian I'm much help finding easy way smart responsible easy. issue making people hopeless actually makes follow likely yes. PM sais ""we want lockdown possibility"" language means ""we going lockdown"" Especially considering opthalmologist raised alarm new virus patients eye issues. Yeah we've discussed zero understanding barriers Deplorable Sweden didnt refuse lockdown save economy. Swedish Public Health agency responsible economy, dont care economy. however responsible public health broad sense, focus coronavirus. example reason didnt shut schools lack education serious consequences long run society individual children. Increasing inequalities, child abuse, asocial behavior, decreased mental health, increased wealth gap etc.


Sweden left, thats tax highest world there. "" 2019, highest income earners Sweden pay whopping 57.19 percent, anywhere else world. significantly OECD average 41.65 percent."" testing? Seems like real number infected might much worse. numbers Czech Republic multiple times higher, hospitalizations +600 compared Hungary. 1100 hospitalizations one week ago, already +4000 cases daily. Unless Hungary hospitalizing people need it, real numbers cases much worse let on. International Space Station. 

Soon ISS filled Billionaires escaping earth pandemic morphs zombie virus. feel health safety less valuable own. whole sub lighting assuming would lead unstoppable clusters far nothing sort happened. 

I even one people admit subreddit wrong. hard that? sore throat unlike anything I've ever experienced. One second, throat feels fine. Next second, red hot razors lava pouring throat. Came fast, painful thing ever.

Gargling high proof whiskey knock back though. die WH, whats problem. dumb? hopefully people even smarter wear mask even required Orange one😆 Jigsaw I’m tapping out! let know rude previous poster. rude Independent. Apparently commentary little too... robust. I’m guessing you’re right. Pick animal Chinese don’t eat... I’ll wait. get it. don’t know “guarantee” means. Receptors yes chemical though. I've seen reports patients serotonin syndrome could explain long haul condition patients posting. I've also seen evidence SSRIs could help prevent worsening patients admitted. hi i’m melbourne, australia right today’s cases 14 everyone depressed still can’t go outside 5km houses outside 2 hours day see friends family happen live 5km away. 

14 cases. 14 cases today bad news. we’re looking longer lockdown bad 14 cases is.



how rest world open getting 1000’s cases we’re still lockdown, public mental health declining rapidly businesses barely keeping afloat racking hundreds thousands worth debt JFK Oliver Stone. . assisted assassination. 5-6 years, everyone caught it. suppose people going jump windows now?  Wait. USA masks arent mandatory public transportation? not, nearly respiratory virus cause smell taste loss. Ah see point. amount still don’t know virus troubling indeed. Student parties caused quite huge spike least one cities.

It pretty clear cases grow, nice summer. literally guaranteed point, go ahead. used live developed country. hell no, they’ve fucked decades... disagreement there. I'm simply eyeballing potential correlation longer expected antibody presence believe reinfection. .. Medic McMedicface, MD? Trouble UK, big companies like British Gas Barclays going giving customers terrible service, still hiding behind Covid.

Customers still charged full pre covid fees ever evidence idea humans evolved propensity logical reasoning mere byproduct traits meant social coercion/cohesion, would right  He's still young. brain fully formed. Much like commander chief. funny headline mention white house also said cities works best them. no, say ""fuck you"", said ""no, leave cities decide works best them"". Color shocked, another article give facts. Wanted one doctor live resident six months, would suit someone likes sea fishing scuba diving, private chalet sea view, access first class kitchen pantry, Internet, library access etc included. Pay quart mill.

You'd find someone. It’s also possible people get second time got different strain it. feed constantly anti china propaganda blame everything chinese. wonder people start hate target asians. 

Worked nazis blame jews. Closing borders locally couple weeks might help slow spread virus, argue method enforced pandemic unrealistic selfish. might resources able hibernate-out pandemic, so, trading false sense control putting millions people living margin risk. 

Closure borders less spending humanitarian aid, due lockdowns, threatening push millions starvation 7,000,000 people died starvation year! Starvation one many humanitarian disaster wake lockdown, usual poorer nations get bad deal.

The notion lockdown save many lives *world* possible, false panacea. selfish short-sighted strategy benefit few. fact antibodies remain long, combined people sometimes getting second time, makes wonder virus still present never truly fought off. Yeah you’re following. I’m saying there’s guarantee. “Super promising” isn’t objective measure even were, thing guarantee. Yes, that's something take unto account half-assed measures justified ""protect economy"". least case directly know, living communuty Madrid, seems stubbornes keep bars open causing dusruptions business otherwise could work relative normality. resort hard lockdown again, going suffer like hispotality sector.

But well, tourism sector powerful lobby always thrived expense local's quality life rights, surprise. president Madrid expent quarantine luxury hotel free. Free her, since regional government signed fishy contracts owner... ever find them, simply give went hell One hope. Imagine country leader led us beginning? Someone gave daily briefings inspired us right thing. let us know right, wrong, would times admit don’t know yet they’re working answer. God, difference would made country. 
Trump opportunity go history man led nation worse catastrophic event recent times, yet blew it. blew every count. 

PLEASE VOTE Bible Belt it’s like 10%... really disappointing talking about? beginning?

It’s true authorities media cerafull say compare numbers numbers march/April. 

But never noticed anyone trying explain away current rise increased testing. 

Could give example claim? Keep speaking truth!!! Lol good luck, never get charged. used think American lives hard limit 9/11. shit show, know lives citizenship really matter anymore. picked 50 litre back soil yesterday whilst wearing mask. Carrying back car first time I've felt would easier without mask. struggled things fucking infuriated me, short term bullshit. 2 weeks every 2 weeks. 1 month already 1 month. cowardice leaders part. UK, advise vulnerable groups isolate June, rest us 6 weeks. Well, obviously transparent crap. But, still annoying. fucking say 3 months, 4 months, stop pussyfooting around it. Pretty much everywhere getting 2nd wave. Even Sweden career? 

maybe -while we're it- could also could move system people get promoted actual skills much friends manager liked boss, along removing ""we're big family here"" lie often forces fake friendly social reality competition harder ever.


All matter good professional job. happen get along coworker fine become friends fine, certainly wish work would turn back actually is: job pay bills.

The whole ""social"" aspect work even helping anyone, people get promoted friends manager benefit anyone, even company, might talent somewhere company would fitting promotion, maybe less social less liked.

I mean manager position need certain skills deal people lead team, whole ""we're friends family"" imho problem todays work environments. functioning federal government.

No matter get office next year, many, many years that. point would say could decades. deal passed election, little hope it'll passed election theame duck session Trump loses.

Trump republicans likely try burn house handing democrats, dust ""fiscal conservative"" hats. Same. definitely due upgrade don’t funds yet. Can’t wait use new machine instead laptop Cuba, Vietnam, USSR US meddle. mean reality, Socialist states fail US backed coups soooooo brightest people I've ever met, served with. We're portrayed movies media. us simply wanted patriotic, leave home asap, get college money, follow family members footsteps. us actually thrive hate. Even fewer crave war violence. 

That number zero though, dumbasses see posting things like this, getting kind trouble makes news, simply claim love combat ""poster children"" many people served ever see. Even though small fraction us, dumbest people I've ever met guys served with. happens.

He'll soon legalities taken care of, guaranteed. far Finland avoided surge Covid. second wave hit Finland. get group interest self-interest. although we're great identifying selfish self-interest actions, we're terrible identifying actions benefit via benefitting group: look escalators without queue systems set up. maybe phenomenon?

Yeah right...
Have heard infected without symptoms ? vast majority new infected show symptoms virus spreading silently mostly amongst younger people. give couple weeks proper testing picture might slightly different. US still way higher put numbers perspective population density: NL 422 p. km2 US 34 p. km2. densely populated areas = people close together = infections.

But let's make race, almost every country fucking badly. see together looked past days. Yeah... wonder. Like said people see already stop anything social distancing especially older folks.

100% going explode next week evidence this? effected areas still democratic. able get new computer long overdue for.  actually benn confirmed times now. possible reinfected.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Right, see live fairytale land. point trying convince brain dead idiot. Ahh, Kansas - home great city Kansas... City. everyone lives big cities tons people. wear seat belt car high probability meeting another car road even rural area. common sense needs applied here. could walk several Km meeting another person. 

And record, wear mask indoors crowded areas (I usually avoid much possible actually). Staying away large crowds keep safer constantly wearing mask. realizing employees now, help zoom, two places once. Many corporate layoffs coming companies realized don’t need large teams people anymore. Yet protests effect spread virus. Like one taking crazy pills something really data? outside seemingly percentage wears masks. 30 kids? play stupid.

There well quarter million kids going school Idaho.  Wear. A. Mask.  wondered image story. Thank you. objectively pro-coronavirus. definitive knowledge long person would keep antibodies first place? also thing pretty constant: Underestimating virus. voices overestimated it. underestimate day 2021 2022.

I remember first interesting thing gave problematic things get: banks Italy started completely freeze mortgage repayment. greedy merciless people planet decide give pause, know serious, know one step away total collapse. top analysts get necessary information. 
We STILL early stages.  article could read would explain you. FUCKING CALL COPS SITUATION THERE. Germany, people sometimes use masks shopping public transport.

Sometimes? No, allowed grocery store without one. there’s lesson really got hammered home year was-

 “they gotta see believe it” 
2020 administration let single opportunity slip exact wrong thing now, ? There’s actually UCLA research paper suggesting brain fog likely symptom PTSD rather direct link covid. 

They saw SARS epidemic. they? States regularly disregard immigration laws. title mistranslated. One member comedic duo, whose group name ""Red Swamp Crayfish"" (アメリカザリガニ), got infected. Yeah, same. media went ""bad enough take precautions end world"" message instead might greater success making people care. That’s still bad isn’t it. Especially poorer people world. 

I would thought NHS studies countries (With socialised healthcare) cheaper drugs actually good thing wouldn’t trying peddle expensive drugs.  bff told public transit home town requiring masks passengers since march. least cities US taking seriously. sad see others aren't. wonder US laughingstock 

of world. remember July? remember happened DeSantis spent entire Spring boasting Coronavirus spared Florida? look happened summer ... you... didnt read comment properly. People essentially indoor space someone live wear mask. possible due nature activities stopped.

And say small business owner relied ppl taking masks inside. days feels like movie fiction less disease functioning government. points:

Business reaps rewards things go well (more staff, generally) - bear risk things going badly - that's deal. Furthermore, business viable Covid, likely viable Covid. may viable Covid. owned restaurant I'd takeouts possible, otherwise mothball/close Covid - half empty restaurants lose money.

Government support, furlough, eviction protection, UBI etc ameliorate effects job losses - food rotting fields, housing destroyed, sure we'll miserable, reason outside government incompetence us destitute. 

Online schooling difficult yes, especially socialisation important development. However one year manageable, ready deal fallout - investment teachers schools reopen. current HCoV status herd immunity. Mild reinfections URT produce light transient, any, symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 seems take route. forget add TN's Bill lee. He's Terrible job, Removed Restictions weeks ago us. make light serious condition, obligatory: '[Brain Done. bad feeling this. Stay safe bro Actually, dozens people known eat multiple times typical illness. fair think political. think mainly financial. think two things proven worth trying reduce chances severe covid hydroxychloroquine vitamin D. laughed at. vitamin becoming little popular lot people still laugh like talking essential oils. common thing cheap produce therefore sell. readily available nearly countries. really, one would making much money either. However Remdesivir drugs potentially bring billions dollars companies. world run money that's is. Also messaged mods sticky post one reading study refers February 10 cases... last year Went pick carry restaurant packed people wearing masks. Article ain't lying I'm northern US. good portion people wont wear masks. Lots ""you can't live fear"" people. Lots people say numbers fake. Makes sense. wonder care cleaning staff receive? There’s Dutch study released showed decline mortality 50% drop hospitalized patients needing ICU care. 

Source: know study February? lol still ~~low~~ risk. 

It completely unnecessary risk.

Fixed you. date last negative COVID-19 test.

Honest question: lie it? Never said per day. Yes, referring per day thought cause confusion. Sorry that. lack nationally co-ordinated plan working out? Says everyone ever ends next people without mask outside.

Just wear damn mask crying loud. wear seat belt cars around going fast enough die, right?  literally said unique comment lol case while. Also Spain’s counting dog shit. Look 7 day average. It’s decreasing. Ouf, wearing mask time sucks. even mandatory mask rule inside stores yesterday.

We fairly normal summer COVID cases. tend forget every one situation. Yes, consider 12% global population lives there. Meaning 78% people really experiencing covid outbreak summer months. dont really know effect winter going have. helps, evidence suggest people long incubation periods milder course disease therefore less infectious (infectiousness directly linked symptoms severity, even pre-symptomatic infections) I'm mobile link right suggests last 5% big deal normal people 5-6 day incubation. bro quit spamming Center Disease Confusion I'm saying wrong, I've reading Florida exploding two weeks^(tm) since March. good news. Successful models reopening studied emulated. Thanks! Yes that’s one.

Why this? 

The hear things contradict Trump, think it’s purpose. also saying won’t resume Oxford trial, vaccines won’t available election.

I dislike Trump, people shouldn’t suffer punish lies. can’t believe doctors scientists would involved something nefarious - it’s something expect Trump. sorry that. 
but 2 week, recovery, ventilator. 
sorry maybe shall prepare.... solution social security payments. Spain basically everyone wearing mask everywhere (except morons wear nose). We're worst situation Europe, Madrid already cut rest country.

Turns masks enough restaurants bars open (obviously masks can't worn there) contact tracing exist.

We extended lockdown weeks aggressively traced contacts that. However fucked cause 15% GDP tourism government huge pressure reopen soon. Also regions want spend money hiring contact tracers. Call want, bud.  I’m saying based similarities covid 19 timing it, makes wonder covid 19.   idea actually not.  

I gotta go work, I’m done convo now. 20 year olds get complacency 40, is.

There still vigilant stayed liberal, act like first woke 20 year olds.

Every generation people sides change time. Think boomers now, hippy freedom youth back 70s. really, Belgium (and Netherlands) big cities interconnected small cities towns connected suburbs. result Belgian population 98% urban. WH definitely wants many people possible get people die Anecdotal study people area - people still saying is. wish joking. I'm american, 2020 total sucker here, too. government dealt pretty good first wave, now, pretty much flailing-arms-response. could easy: wear mask stay home, necessary leave it. Sure, fucking sucks. going suck much longer, accept it. belongs behind bars. know him, certainly signed Dr Kalle Anka Ankeborg, Sweden. everyone start tasting things they’re sick lol Nah, I'll extend privilege using J card one. Ok... so... **BAD SPECULATION** don’t believe lockdowns either. Closing pubs isn’t lockdown. middle road Belgian study proved effective normal doses. greatly reduced chances ending hospital. study knew exactly doing. know people dumb actually read studies, let alone go details dosages. set study fail. imagine doctor deciding "" I'm going poison sick people order make biased point"". crime. knew full well dosage wrong dangerous. Vietnam strict military checkpoints border crossings already easy close flick switch. Europe internal US borders luxury much better would US ad whole 50 largely independent states EU-like arrangement president ceremonial chairperson elected House? one knows answer reinfectivity even length time antibodies last. already takes 2 shots vaccine.

I don’t think worry getting back line. distribution going mess. One theory I've read assumed he'd asymptomatic thought could get away disclosing it. beat question. never said anything study. Never said Swedish people’s fault I? It’s absolutely fault tengell co. would exception. aren’t private transportations? Something take account really disperse population. I’m sure helped lot. bleeding victims disease, historical pandemics leave infected rotting away inside bloody mess. become potus even europeans right saying people nations stupid, good reason Anti body tests short window, outside chances detection nearly zero. confusing PCR/rapid test. Even best circumstances, antibody testing basically fake bill insurance companies. see 1000 deaths per day may change tunes. Hoping doesn’t happen. Id like wrong. Broken men destroying country decades. get this. see person blatantly proud anti masker, it’s idiots go parties, restaurants, multiple stores. them, system could handle rise cases, many following basic rules (combined zero enforcement laws) healthcare system can’t handle massive amount cases. it’s triage. Yeah that‘s true gotta admit really best stat put lol. density population play factor spreading virus though. i‘m referring overall density china (because obviously bigass stretches land almost inhabited), rather density big cities. also saying Asians America smarter europeans better job avoiding virus. general sense, smarter europeans well: saying europe even dumber black people america due current shitshow daily cases european nations lol Good. turn know someone works VA. Staff attends meetings small rooms (unmasked) 10 plus people attendance 3 wear masks.
Over past several weeks covid hit infected several staff patients, facility.
People selfish stupid. First video remember watching bulldozing highways wuhan. Everyone shock 500 confirmed cases could speculate bad symptoms must take kind measures city big cases consequences? suppose it’s need develop strong immune system. charts look like roller coasters well, except maybe steep drops. sorry following you. lot people hospitals. don’t think economic play they’re not. Dr Spaceman list? Unless also rock. can't believe took virus companies realize people work effectively home days. need bosses watch us work capable without next us.  Mad Max?

Because Mad Max 2 shows post-apocolyptic world similar ways Road. Low effort dude.  Politicians need get traced can’t spread virus since politicians lot contact people. Probably best viewed browser strong ad blocker. Better yet go source articles. right point can‘t believe China local transmissions. never said can’t believe they‘re better America though lol it‘s obvious America one worst reactions pandemic whole world. didn‘t fully catch meant last sentence tho (my bad, i‘m hungover af). Masculinity would adapt, better odds survival, people. Even means perceived silly.


Toxic masculinity valuing outward perceptions survival people. assume would documentation - sample logs, computer file creation dates, etc. easily faked. Germany police state? Apparently method strict enforcement works much better regarding COVID looking infection numbers. can't expect anti-mask nutheads conspiracy crazies comply corona measures even believe corona exists. risk 1000 euro fine, group people less inclined ignore corona rules really matter singling certain race, definition makes racist. Change word white black see sounds. “Cominic Dummings” fact one fake names found. Spanish flu experienced exact thing. Numbers down, people got lax, got real bad second wave. 

With level stupidity, wouldn’t surprised see 3rd wave Masked Japan 3 times flu related deaths per 100k USA 2018. Well yeah base real Americans Russian bots Traitors. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article That's brutal. seeing mom 7 months much imho.

I also caught whopping cough kid really sick weeks parents couldn’t remember they’d even vaccinated me.
I’m starting wonder trying get rid 😂 go 3 mile walk suburban neighborhood usually encounter people like 2x. pull mask pass back after. unreasonable walk alone outside unmasked. tried times seem fun randoms white make wtf can’t talk people?

By stalling go straight lockdown plus hospitalisation march/april. keep hearing rural area don’t take seriously either. Hooooooowwwwww many times I’ve heard “Oh, 1 case covid here” ugh, makes want scream! seem feel safe.

Have learned anything? Spanish flu spare rural communities? Black Death spare rural farmhouses? “The current case count includes everyone linked outbreak including household members close contacts employee.” Sounds like roller coaster  live Super rural part PA, go outside, walk miles come close contact one. Sure understand big cities cant socially distance like NYC. wat I'm gonna wearing mask isnt someone anywhere near me. 'Antibodies cure COVID' - MSN  may long term downsides like loss friendship employees. work efficient spent time helping stuff like office. also felt like contractor employee makes easier switch companies.

I think best fit 2 days office anf 3 days home. Remember people tried argue schools weren’t going lead increase cases?

What people think changed globally last month?

Hmmmm Europe thinking .clearly lesson learned lock everyone houses 30 days 0 possible way out..30 days later starvation deaths would stop covid right tracks !! Elitists elite. Quite fucking opposite fact. think issue doubt don’t ❤️ Quit escalating “but what” crap. 

Trump simply could started “wear mask” instead turning political right/left thing. 

He couldn’t even that. doesn’t. question hot topic... people keep going big groups, don´t wear masks. Nobody cares, especially younger people. anything whether it’s cure not? always end game. normalizes outsources job remotely. Sure, Microsoft big deal - going happen everywhere. jobs coming back, people begging fearful hearts lose American jobs.

I'm work home, surprised lazy unqualified entitled self loses job permanently too. virus biggest power grab century. They're reshaping mind. Three years ago, imagine outrage title. People would furious terrified, economic reasons, they'd rightfully point entire business model become Chinese operated. precedence use national guard / federal police squads Cities aren’t following Admin’s wishes. would different? me. Sorry! supposed police this? sounds like you’re advocating police state. really want? do, won’t stop COVID goes away. Again, you’re REALLY underestimating difference continent middle ocean, country surrounded countries every side. Even shut borders down, people need cross essential work, dual citizens, etc. 

It may look simple it’s simple country, majority world, it’s really easy. next impossible slow down, people use public transportation unmasked masks nose. takes one match start forest fire.

However, reason think next summer it’ll ok, thanks vaccine. vaccine don’t want Trump rush. said talking it...neighborhoods NYC, countries currently setting records conversations soon.

We'll see weeks extent conversation turns direction many us caught flat footed last time. Nursing shitty job, even best times. Nurses normally (unfairly) expected take many patients safe normal times due deliberate understaffing maximize profits corporate hospitals. flooded patients, tripling workload expected work patients deadly disease cure, without proper personal protective gear, told suck anyway question this. left nursing years ago *no way hell* would ever go back.

Edit: instead downvoting please tell wrong. 1 every 1539 Americans died covid according CDC need use data tell people stupid. Without data, notion. Nah dude, act high mighty, everybody arguing everything since start pandemic. dude many months ago like NO. SCIENCE. like you, telling masks ineffective. Technically correct according science, virus smaller .03 microns. nuance argument.

 retarded, point I'm sick people like holier thou. know. know. Nobody knows sure. evidence theories. facts. fucking shit.

In news, fire burn Covid spreads sustained interaction, merely passing someone outdoors one second. Especially Republicans. sad, sounds like really nice young lady. 

Not vulgar hope isn’t line, obesity terrible thing taking many young people Covid. become clear COVID deadly. killed like what...3x people flu year? even made year since COVID hit U.S. Interestingly, normal times conservationists talk important help animals avoid extinction, one arguments I've heard may find species could provide cure human disease, we'd never know species went extinct. 

so... thanks conservationalists! That's things like cancer. this, actual use going minimal. France's average daily new cases past week 15,626 cases peak 20,339. Adjusting US population, average 79,323 daily new cases, peak **103,242 daily new cases**.

Face it, France experiencing larger wave country yet see. almost certain wont see blasted front page ""failures French government"" ""Macron killed thousands""

But see. could wrong. right severity wave experiencing Almost 10,000 covid deaths day. Jesus Christ. eliminate risk even further.

There's certain point risk incredibly small care pulverize even further. ""It's little difficult know, admit,"" says.

What hero. /s          
It's time admits it, given ""predictions"" wrong since beginning pandemic. heck 2020 France, England, Netherlands, Germany, US back 60K daily cases. We’re losing total control like spring. idea people praise Sweden reasonable measures countries similar (or even less) restrictions post-lockdown called draconian.

Those people find lockdowns kind draconian also tend think Sweden restrictions truth, also true people want argue Swedish policies. camps ignore restrictive non-lockdown places like South Korea Taiwan entirely.  since already commented first one, need too. 

The second looks 3 months, talking about, expectation people lose immunity 12 months, 3. 

Florian Krammer's thread saw two weeks ago. address issue reinfection all, really say anything new general, idea linking This. 

Covid infected 7.5 million killed 212,000 US far.

The worst flu recent history (2017-2018) infected 49 million killed 79,000.

COVID already killed 4 times many people infecting 15% many US (so far), makes 26 times fatal worst flu people know like compare to.

This doesn’t even bring fact tons people survive COVID end lifelong lung, heart, organ damage. That’s actually part scares worst, especially either kids gets it. 

Source: CDC Nah wasnt, never tested flu life honestly, doctor tell flu send meds, tell take something counter.

Calmalyn savior it, codeine suppress cough, counter write name get bottle, vitamin c usual go to's I'm sick lol. 

Contact c feel getting sick usually goes away gets bad. never wear mask outside. grandma scared stay inside. correct see here. 

On March 11 Spotify told staff work home. Tegnell questioned could idea Swedes answered unequal could work Whose locking again? Outside UK (if couldn’t even call lockdown) Israel, im unaware second widespread lockdown talks majority states/ countries. large Chinese study showed people serious disease still antibodies 6.5 months later. Two studies reported people mild diseases would antibodies decline 3 months, people still adaptive immunity - i.e. body quickly make antibodies demand, unlikely re-infected, commercial labs may able pick resting antibody levels. getting cut sharp piece metal office, getting infected cut right seatbelt rubbed drive, would never gone.

Record highs hit absolutely everywhere. France, England, Netherlands, US back 60K cases day first time 2 months. dreaded fall wave definitely arriving. absolutely agree. people buying fearporn need understand science better. thing proof science - got it. fall edge Earth, please. quote one telling people creationism Darwin's work really theory?

Countless, peer reviewed studies generated showing immediate return declines positivity severity (since decreased viral load tended yield less severe reactions).

And yes, distancing nuanced - one posted keep 1m distance sort goal. Sure, momentary contact someone infected get sick. there's good science behind distancing mandates, reason suggest 6 ft. based 'liberals' comment, I'm guessing really care science, unless there's plenty Jesus dinosaurs. Here's plague God sent buddy, might well hole wait locusts! provide source talking about? Basically hate seat belt laws. Bad example. Protects yourself. 99.95% survival rate wear mask protect .05%, it’s simple. need change lifestyles protect risk population. Bikers wearing helmets masks Humans kill 100,000,000 sharks year (seriously, google it). half mil really isn’t anything worry Let's honest, good news us someone asthma level obesity recovered.

Holy shit! Still, half million top pretty big increase. hell CDC think are, bunch medical experts?  Pneumonia lump beginning. early symptom.

""White lung"" means lungs infected inflammation, means symptoms quite severe.

When small shadows lungs, almost certain patient mildly ill needs isolated

These lessons learned frontline Chinese doctors nurses cost human life.

""It miss 80% positive values!""

ridiculous

 That’s pretty bad given CIR (cardiac infection rate) 78%. can't say happen sure often difficult tell people contract it. Youre right physics make unlikely would get transmitted extremely brief outdoor encounter, think evidence exists conclusively state could NEVER happen. also evidence either way state precise odds dying car crash versus outdoor-transmitted COVID.

Do wear mask go deserted local park walk sparsely-populated sidewalk? No. Would were, say, standing outside crowd waiting ling line? Absolutely. think fair point factors like crowd density wind speed could affect outdoor transmission rates. think paranoia want protect others virus potentially serious consequences taking slight inconvenience wearing mask extra two minutes day. Real number surveillance problems lying also least twice that. also hear death nothing like napping. overall positivity rate NY still 1%. large issue deserved type response, positivity rate low? We’re singling ridiculously small subset people whose actions don’t even impact overall state positivity rate (clearly) sample sizes show increased positivity rate 100s. Small sample size, negligible increase overall, yet still lot blame hatred towards Jewish community? anger Cuomo sent 4500 people die nursing homes?
NY highest number deaths state covid. Sorry don’t trust continue mishandling situation.  anyone ever spent week hospital know never ever wanna spend
The night . Can’t imagine much worse would visitors allowed .

Netherlands population 18 million also significantly wealthier country better general sanitation. comparable. Come now. real travel restrictions. schools non-essential businesses closed. Houses worship limit percentage attendance. Restaurants go back outdoor dining/pick up/take (indoor dining 25% recently introduced). detail foun implying drug harm?

Yes, wrong, worried agenda FORCED others actually care people. care agenda, people.

Less damage lock downs caused, so, yes, reason would better lock downs. care agenda, people 


I care people, agendas, that's I'm lock downs, precautions like voluntary usage masks distancing. official sources still quote high value. Even though overly high, worse use unvetted information sources. 

As aside, real time numbers seems hovering around 5% , normalised demographics population way. Maybe cases young way less likely need care way, least 4 countries areas overrun hospital systems. maths, easy see how

US 29.4 ICU beds per 100,000

If 2% get infected 2% hospitalisation rate, would maxed system start deciding dies lives, likely got ventilator first everyone else left fend own. basic studies say 11,000 sharks killed *per hour*, many speculate actual figure probably closer 25k per hour. unfortunate killed specifically reason, drop bucket. Exactly! RIP thank you!(forgot name) confused mean. found B cell immunity SARS [12 years 

Reinfection scary sounds. Let put way, *can* happen, mean relevant 99% people. lot viruses provide long term immunity, isolated cases immune response wacky reinfection occurs. One study found reinfection happening everybody 4 months rate normal infections, would 150k reinfections USA right now. Instead have... 2 confirmed cases reinfection worldwide. Yep. Instagram train wreck. Go check CP24 interview “owns” reporter...... referring countries expect people self quarantine symptoms could covid-19. 

And referring countries unlike Sweden realise people live house confirmed covid-cases pose high risk acting symptomatic spreaders. 

At least Sweden’s neighbouring countries measures place including sick pay. reason find quite weird Sweden suddenly celebrated less others later others. remember reading too. makes sense. 3 points entry face virus, doesnt matter virus. Eyes, nose, mouth. 

I feel like scientists stuck stupid reason pushing beginning every single thing politicized. share energy BLM communities protesting coronavirus?

I’m glad now. that’s mean. guys moving winning strategy now. it’s means ‘Swedish strategy’. Back exponential. Lithuania peak 1000 active cases went full lockdown. Got better opened back. 3000 active cases. Still wide open. Yes, it’s also true 78% patients, including asymptomatics cardiac issues. Can't second wave never closed first wave..taps head american Avoid politics. Here’s meat. Bit redundant/agendapost article. already know Per Johns Hopkins Medicine, similarities coronavirus common flu. diseases caused viruses cause fever, body aches, cough result pneumonia. spread similar ways, mostly respiratory However, according report, novel coronavirus far dangerous deadlier flu. cause serious, long-term damage lungs, brain, kidneys vital organs.

This true. Tuberculosis deadly infectious disease though. Although waters muddied many people die HIV infected TB. TB-HIV co-infection makes 15-20x likely develop active TB infection 3x likely progress HIV AIDS and/or die TB.

Do happen links backing up? Germany able apply South Korean strategy Europe, everybody else struggled get testing speed. wasn’t Swedish problem.

Regular infected people become sick first, get tested wait days results meanwhile presence covid continues multiply body. told stay home 2 weeks critical condition finally sent hospital. Trump sent hospital immediately results.  future employers look people received “zoom education”? reason lot people don’t take online schools like University Phoenix seriously.

Yea different. whole world pandemic even highly accredited renowned institutions forced go online - think safe say employers future realize good extent. virus continues onward, higher institutions might even change educational model long-term adapt school-from-home (I think within 10 years so, VR AR technology might even allow 'virtual classrooms' accessed us home, example). due unprecedented nature virus, almost graduating classes future good amount time studying home employers almost surely knock it. However, true lot practical skills need experienced In-person, especially higher education like lab work scientists/doctors, etc. interesting see goes.

What transparently fake bravado prove? 

Does want everyone get sick too?

How benefit America trump brand?

Reeks outside influence dismantling nation within. think easily eroded within quickly. lot students likely spend least 1 year studying online, too. Putting life hold virus dangerous flu, yet see people subreddit media like VICE general never address these, pretending it’s non-issue actually advocating schools shutdown online learning, like fuck? Like 200,000 families then. Username checks uit understand now. Please discard agressive tone previous message. fetus it! March, people saw happening Italy, New York France rallied together. nothing happened people got false sense security, like countries handled well. thought happen whatever reason (remember crazy talks tuberculosis vaccination somehow prevented COVID eastern bloc countries fared much better western europe US?)

So whatever action governement took last week people like ""It's necessary! destroying economy! oppressing people!"" must admit far well...

Only people see cases, hospitalizations ICU occupancy rising exponentially taking seriously again. still, public opinion lockdown divided.

edit: read anything lockdown english outlets wan't announced yet. politicians keep talking possibility PM came said: ""I let epidemiologists decide."" definitelly happening. comment response comparing wearing mask one around wearing seatbelt cars around. CFR depends number test countries doing. go 0% (no testing!) 100% (testing dead!). [This people pre-existing conditions make susceptible? np  literature read comparing COVID-19 b cell responses 4 common cold coronaviruses? 

thanks advance! Good thing restrictions like every country. registered deaths people tested. 

Most countries count deaths hospitals retirement homes. would show people going tested sick. 

A lot people don’t get tested anything they’re sick, treat home best unless serious complications come up. That's throw fire, took gloves dropped truth bomb  adopted Indian son, Deep Schitt. hate articles like state things never get back normal again. People never give lose hope return normalcy. It’s direct slap face working hard create safe vaccines eventually stop pandemic. Everyone get flu shots, would terrible flu covid time Mon dieu! Tout est perdu! It’s amazing need someone tell this. 

I wouldn’t go mask either, like, fuck wrong you. Exactly! I’m southern part state it’s really picking steam here. Looks like school districts reopened in-person classrooms laying groundwork defend lawsuits. sued endangering teachers, students communities. Germany, people; still much virus control work reopen schools. IFR around .5-1 percent assumed while. I'm betting treatments death rate actually quite bit lower states.

Not, giving around 0.2% IFR estimate 750 millions infected. article bit messy chronologically. clear whether masks closure pubs, leisure facilities prevention large gatherings effect. think derive title article. 

Of course, I'm confident masks essential, please journalists write coherent article. but...the herd.  /s echochamber phrases sub officially become exhausting. basically stop thinking bad life happier. Yeah sure lots money that's easy  Belgian here, 3k+ cases average even think latest recorded day 5k, getting numbers 4 days ago.

To top off, flu season coming common cold rising make chaotic. people can't take half arsed rules bad communication serious anymore. think Indians higher immunity virus “ poor living conditions “ , younger population, government media tried educate building immunity home remedies early on, guess western countries didn’t . Even DrFauci said Tumeric doesn’t work , proven work virus, people focused building immunity whole goal post analogy dumb. Fall wave here. point expect get away hitting people mask noses right said nose self-defense? blood clot nose job, all. weekend boot. Get fuckin ready. Fall wave going brutal. still allowed drive? Cars kill death bad. Lockdowns work spring. would work now. 6 frontline workers recovered 'weeks' ago. reinfection, reactivation, something talked virus.

That's correct. proved reinfection genetically sequencing showing different strain second time. literally CAN'T jsut reactivation. TBF protestors wore face masks outside Seriously? haven’t seen news English this.
Also, it’s ridiculous difference March/April Czechia. Exactly like seatbelt comparison. obviously absurd, make point obvious.

I making joke point, make point point kinda joke. forgot ""Mostly peaceful"" well, bruh. LOL 🤭

The virus give damn fake victim hood BLM racist cause businesses burnt looted themselves. 

Please next time dont half ass CNN zombie mob narrative. 
Or else.... affects young too. makes think friends %. took weeks train dogs free. 10 000 maybe america😁 Lockdown delays problem. tried lockdowns spring failed. lives still everything open. big cities lot cases, nightclubs bars closed That’s science works. Victoria (Australia) worst outbreak far, peaked 770 cases per day. hard comprehend 60,000. Sure is. 200,000+ dead country alone isn’t fucking real enough them! malevolent administration blame, certainly help overseas. according doctors, next step masks outdoors.

Going refuse buy agree? article Dutch, study links Enlgish: Kind like seatbelt comparison? 🙄 99350000 die Due decades systemic sexism, women tend make less money men. schools closed day cares closed plenty families make choice one parent quit job take child care. rational decision lesser earning parent, usually mother. all, live close Amsterdam. Remove enough nuance draw absurd conclusion want. Better making jokes points. Sorry hear it. Take comfort knowing doctors nurses gotten much, much better treating Covid early on. hospital safest place could be, really, would say less scary closely monitored. best wishes full recovery 🍀🙏🍀 even read title posting here?

The relevance self evident. That’s sequenced virus variants no, none present November. stupid, non scientific thinking pushed wannabe doctors (aka Facebook mommies) True. greatest irony pandemic Europe countries Greece, famous disobeying laws, best this. Dad you? Instead have... 2 confirmed cases reinfection worldwide.

No, counts cases person genetically sequenced twice, different strains prove first infection lingering. see yet control people around you.

Do wear seat belt plan crashing put see another car?

Probably would pretty dumb. guess closer correct one - defining 'force' broadly were, considering various forms pressuring, financial etc, ""forcing"". view, think federal government power compel states comply many instances really want to, technically correct states follow mandates. Yep, disagree you. making point using median mean really change anything narrative, likely journalist who's clueless statistics experts small town Kansas free call CDC advice. Back original premise scientists working federal government places far away small town Kansas set policy small town. care shopping cart theory. care effective evidence-based solutions result long-term public buy in. ain't it. people close related Belgians perhaps, summed way life perfectly haha.

I've always seen dutch people outspoken types, always seem clear want US least, half leadership still taking seriously. agree, best decision making maintain credibility declaration. Sadley probably ignored letting crazies haha. Lockdown worst outcome typically spend 3 4 evenings dinner go ballot, answer easy ones basic research reading obscure controversial measures. takes time! Cannot imagine walking voting booth. someone gets sick Sweden, face crippling debt bankruptcy? wondering ""we here!"" folks States. Herman Caine died risk group. Trump said it’s flu big deal. Trump explaining do.


See works. Also replace Caine “over 210k Americans”. Yeah, thing even something low sounding 0.65% stands kill heck lot everyone immunologically naive it. We're used losing 0.65% population flu, simply happen. Hey Chris Don--what Crede? nights weekends thing that's probably bad RU-EN translation: ""regional"" = moscow/saint-petersburg, so, remote areas Lock home shut up. feels like so. That's fair. LEAST half country retarded. wearing mask means living, must difficult time you. entirely applicable: close borders, lock cases go zero. really simple. Unfortunately, requires clarity thought resolve purpose, sorely lacking politicians wider society. *That* bit trouble with. Dang burds exactly, one big differenc western countries. enforcing rules quarantines think too, day passes we're closer ending nightmare! Yeah, cannot join lynch mob, next best thing. Well saying comparison situation march situation now. Numbers don''t mean much.
In area got record numbers today buy 11000 swabs. used 400/500 initial phase lockdown. Ok bro. Good luck next trump rally mask. support ridiculous ideas asked explain them. joker trolling thinking he's star trek character describing life logic missing largest logical issue. 

Logic: 
-if wrong mask, people get hurt. 
-If people wrong mask, one extra gets hurt mild inconvenience small economic cost. Gonna get downvoted asking. Tom hanks allowed Queensland then?  lot titles shorten things explained detail body -- actually. ^And ^sometimes ^they're ^even ^a ^little ^hyperbolic. apparently meant title Fauci event adds data favor idea masks social distancing mitigate spread. IOW, helps prove it. holding titles media standards scientific definitions words gonna bad time. news article Idaho. covered Idaho news. mean recommendation made places. Thank you. Yes, read paper never said Fauci illogical. headlines like shot accept them, normalise acceptance illogical thinking conclusions. France done. Yep lucky. Keep up. Even following must basic guidelines guide guys successfully end.  I'm laughing statement. Instead giving personal experience black woman country, telling black OBGYN (woman doctor case know) friend said black people medical industry long written history lesson, I'm going give one suggestion. really want proof read Medical Apartheid Harriet Washington. Let's start book I'll continuing teaching clearly education lacking. different ways looking this. killed LOT people, despite incredible steps taken try reduce spread. 

What feel mournful sad. Certainly ""at ease."" mean...wow! line thinking seem consistent. Masks restrict dispersal airborne virus inhalation virus. 100%, studies seen, reduces risk lethality COVID.

As long smart enough use consistently correctly. virus controlled well places population large wore masks implemented aggressive contact tracing. Japan South Korea two population dense countries gave blueprint properly combat virus without elongated economic shut-downs. stupidity Americans made measures like wearing masks political instead binding action civic pride save lives. Make mistake, US failed miserably, starts top trickles down.  Yes know. act like researched. spreading misinformation.  Take consideration lombardy populated region (10 millions) italy second density. addition ran mass screening using serologicial tests affected area affected province lombardy showed 42% people antibodies. speaking small area (60000 people).
There still lot people come touch virus, even lombardy.  Youre probably going die virus

The northern hemisphere going flu season get slammed. Wisconsin opened field hospital still 5 months starts warm up. know someone staff member one facilities.
New even longer term staff members motivated excel well, ,""by book,"" mentality VA used, thanks ex military workers, chain command BS, saps power. really need revamp get modem world. VA veteran number. Seems like got first wave well... put guard down. really. keep watching fox news spouse veterinarian. seeing massive increase unknown respiratory illnesses dogs cats. owners covid, cost test dog cat covid outrageous. many going undiagnosed wait. Two weeks!!!!! Bodies streets! Antibiotics? don't, reason listed. reason second wave death tolls anywhere bad first young healthy people main drivers new cases, old vulnerable people still taking extra precautions.  familiar probability works?

Yes, matter also familiar healthcare works US?

How ""works""? question general impossible respond to. Lordumber93 troll. That's account exists for. feed it. B&amp;H massive store Manhattan staff almost entirely ultra-Orthodox Jews. owner Satmar Hasid huge employer within group. covid Rabbi mentioned article Bobov Hasid, different related group. Satmars endorsed Hillary Hasids went Trump groups identical. ""prove"" anything. supports Dr. Fauci's statement, prove masks work need randomized study. certainly believe help based case studies there, concrete science efficacy masks preventing transmission. I'm big Dr. Fauci fan, great statement make. get it. cannot see statement illogical conclusion aligns attitudes. made understand world mess right now. Thank you. Pedantics. Well depending live go sports events brunch, so..... forget, situation even worst also bought non authorized flu vaccines Covid sorts different symptoms (destroyed smell receptors, covid toe, rashes children, etc) 

And attaches differently body, COVID getting ACE2 receptors. 

And different way invades leads different damage (COVID way likely attack organs like heart, kidneys, liver, even brain). causes blood clots way flu doesn't. sort vascular disease rather respiratory disease like flu. evidence strongly suggests less healthy person surviving COVID-19.

What evidence? thought new ""novel"" virus, there'd long term statistics showing this. statement chief virologist Germany last week claimed evidence schools significant impact numbers. guess came tracing contacts. might change course given quickly number cases jumped since last week. Lol. might leave typo fun. mistyped phone chose ""correct"" form me. Bad title article want get picky agree you. Fauci didn’t say though read it. He’s referring specifically data masks proving work.  

“I think — data speak themselves,” nation’s top infectious disease expert said interview CBS News. “We super-spreader event White House, situation people crowded together wearing masks. data speak themselves.”  effects young people? physical effects virus could mental health effects depression anxiety hitting young people harder anything right now? doesn’t make OP logical, concern. guy ignorant purpose. Masks work. didn't, health care workers would become infected hospital alarming rates disease. Likely far you...bro. he's dumbass, ignore wanna say thank china we’re situation (the government citizens course) laboratories wanna rain good weather maker ???
When nato 🇺🇳 punish embargo china ? Who's troll here? Trolls usually downvoted side. earth would that? would point... per capital basis, Germany still well behind western/central European nations, bar Italy. I'm saying things spiking rapidly (which since beginning week), however, Merkel already convened mayors 11 biggest cities approved new restrictions. start become mandatory soon region 35 cases per 100k people 7-day average (in Madrid they're 750 can't agree anything), restrictive ones 50 cases onwards.

I confidence Merkel government take action lot sooner neighbors. Even so, difficult fall winter, there's two ways it. Oh yes even ""forget"" extemely different testing capabilities virus spread numbers cannot compared happened march good propaganda airline industry. I’m talking bare minimum wearing mask going events, bars, partying. 

So living all? work sounds great. wear them. can't trust science -- idiots everywhere Drawing conclusions sample size one major symptom failure comprehend basic science, leads harmful policy decisions, negative public health outcomes, poor decision making larger societal level. Thank you, makes sense puts ease. Yeah lot people rapidly offended forget difference country race. Zinc always helps lot colds. I'm believer! know covid cold business still. 200,000+ people shouldnt dying like this.  Flu deaths England 5 year historical average. (See link reply) 's obviously point always, nothing done. Mental illnesses much ignored, continue be. Prove statement going receive quality health care bc PoC. avoid large gathering? country fighting covid since February. pandemic response huge social economic implications. *always* going political. let guard (or case never guard first place) matter time. Crazy future generations, whole life ahead them, disregarded situation disinformation among pheasants

2020 still running surprises, see. testing masks proves mask prevent spread virus. account banned spreading horseshit couple notes:

* study retrospective obersevational study, thus random control trial study.
* data 14 dutch hospitals, including wide variety academic, regular top-clinical hospitals.
* 1046 patients obsorved 14 hospitals, 566 patients received treatment either HCQ (n=189) QC (n=377), 498 patients received treatment.
* HCQ QC lower mortality.
* HCQ (not QC) associated 53% decreased risk transfer COVID-19 patients regular ward ICU.
* patients included started treatment relatively early normal, non-icu hospitalization start treatment within first day admission.
* Results remained significant even completing risk analysis. ideas? hell talking about? deserve allowed trump elected. 

sure, minority rule, half eligible population even vote presidential election one candidates is, blame letting get point. 

part collectivism sharing blame yourselves, american culture distinctively anti-collectivism. Yeah man, reality economic issues way bigger threat average family coronavirus That’s example described though. Dear leader announces policy ok, Dear leader says something stupid Covid gets flag. excercise. Five days week hour day weight fall regardless diet. read original statement? subject. talking about? protect take necessary precautions you. one size fits situation. one person risk, doesn’t mean everyone else live bubble vice-versa. main issue now. Good point, likely true Lung scarring post infection, accompanied fact get reinfected build upon already existing damage...I would advise taking precautions seriously. stick them, less trouble NO... already it. get one day three days later ""cured"" (his word). don’t think understand logic. Lets call spade spade. called Sars-Covid-2. like SARS. SARS stop comparing flu. Compare SARS MERS You’ll better end it. post comment removed 

Hard Paywall

([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Hey, try sitting jury duty person next deliberating saying “I know hasn’t proven beyond reasonable doubt he’s guilty, know gut it.” taking 3 hours convince cant convict someone gut saying. frustrating day. retrospective obersevational study vs **8 RCTs** saying work. I'm sick hearing HCQ. IT. DOES. NOT. WORK. FOR. COVID. Fl cases NY NJ combined averaging 100 dead day end year deaths continue bad they'll take NY NJ within week they'll deaths NJ. fine going herd immunity Coach Mullen also invite Governor DeSantis attend game person well, without mask course. Good points. However, look another H1N1 virus pandemic, 2009. 8 months new vaccine short supply. Fall wave going cluster fuck. fact Sweden mask policy mean anti-mask policies.

Sweden ready implement mask policies Awful :( think I've heard single person serious symptoms COVID lingering symptoms months. giant breakout company street I'm basically going pretend stay-at-home order again. I'm sorry one stressor life. year brutal many people. hope so! community religious leader, also citizen subject laws consequences anyone else. act, situation never change. lot deadly, spreads easily. stuff known. Yet allow purely political comments fit narrative stay up? 

Why ""reports"" evidence 2 completely separate things, agree current evidence COVID crazy high chance giving people long term conditions. agree, people less babies bad thing? taking proper precautions.

Got it. really sure felt need share that. do. It’s mini dachshund. bar reopenings go totally fine. Signed -The Virus Yeah, no. Nice try. Correct. People trying figure death percentages wasting time. numbers change daily. updated sites says new Michigan today although know 3 positive cases come ER today 2 went ICU. say goal retracted really quickly one dumbest statements time. talk immunity barely knew re-infection possible immunity possible. retracted statement. slippery slope walking down. come “models always wrong” idiots. Take didn’t see media May June calling Macron planning reopen soon quickly given lockdown strategy working.

Also, fact France even distinct second wave proves point lockdowns working, versus America’s perpetual first wave. 

And finally: lol, US media ever devoted serious attention covering nations’ news? case you’re curious French actually feel rn:  go grocery shopping? 

Do perform life sustaining task required survival? Yes.

How relate go indoors literally anywhere home? 

Not unless life sustaining activity like going so, again, ~8x dangerous running maskless. 

I said don't. Put straw man away want adult give smaller number breathing hard running, provide evidence want argue hard breathing makes full factor 8). 

You go 0x dangerous go perform non life sustaining activities. strawman: hypocritical attack indoor activities all.

You acting like participate indoor activities absolutely trying prop straw man.

Again, put straw man away alongside jump conclusions mat stick things true. Ok, fair enough see never cared enough test like COVID. even still, would hope wouldn’t dismiss comparison can’t compare perfectly. People comparing flu since beginning, narrative lately COVID orders magnitude deadly... think suggests simple might different conclusion year data comes in. Yeah, shit, particular berlin missed first wave mostly got real second wave impact.

But crazy thing 26k cases 11% positivity rate. think germany crossed 2%... Lockdowns happened many hospitals' stomachs full. Missouri win. beat Wisconsin. 100% this. Ousting Trump end, it’s beginning! Almost NY’s deaths infections came earliest stages virus spreading, lack credible info shortages supplies hitting hardest. Since NY NJ implemented heavy restrictions numbers past months greatly improved. contrast, Florida didn’t start seeing serious numbers around June escalated since then. around 200k confirmed cases NY right now. doesn’t even take account NY NJ way open reporting, whereas Florida taken steps limit reporting obfuscate numbers. yeah, keep making excuses. hurts face reality comfort Lies preferred cannot handle reality support lockdown necessary so. Real cool twist shit goddamn blender, sonny. Fall wave going brutal. look number ‘cases per million’ population; South Dakota 6th highest rate entire United States. it’s coincidence. We’ve dealing 8 months. I’m losing empathy people. commenting utility antibody tests, many blood donation places (including Red Cross) offering free antibody tests donation. came back negative (yay?).  Woah, say ""holy shit that's bad"" French? They've probably exceeded actual (different confirmed) infections levels spring. lots lots reports it, yes.

And lot things would mostly show later, well.

Again, simply know. I'm one saying know sure. Epidemiologists Harvard, Yale Stanford say lockdowns far harm good. guess anti-science though, listen scientists. Exactly. Sadly denial evolutionary fitness value ages. always percentage idiots push statistically dumb luck. Sad population large older generation quite different IFR population large younger generation. Without knowing age deomografic can't normalise IFR data IFR number make much sense, wanted point out. Yes look like ""the one killed million people 8 months worse one kidded 2,500 8 years"". 

If want say one barely hurt anyone worse one hurt soooo many people, know tell you, probably done conversation. Lmao idea growing rural area hilarious. can't you. saying people lived 100 miles Cincinnati indianapolis commuted way rural commuted? That's weird. 2021 better comment upvoted heaven? last reported test positivity rate 9.3% October 5th. Anyone number today? Fall wave it’s going fucking brutal. still locked down? downvoters, op wrong, insensitive, current rounding number, add pretty fucking fast, factor people less babies due fear virus economic uncertainty. /ˈkärmə/   Hinduism Buddhism) sum person's actions previous states existence, viewed deciding fate future existences.

The sum Karma life amounts position next life.  thought herd immunity already debunked. never learn.  people sub enjoy dystopia  Dan Mullen Governor! Move aside Rona Deathsentence, want someone kill people you. hear? disappearing. admit comments entirely helpful, ask understand position frustration *dear leader* indirectly mods healthcare provider entirety shit show dear leaders brainwash nothing operating area create patients. knew sure right things would way forever may fine dying tbh fuck  That's incorrect. ""flu deaths"" never positive test flu. doctors put based things like symptoms. COVID apparently another Yahweh’s iron chariots. I'll bet another president, even another Republican that, we'd mess lot quicker. Think it. Could've closed state borders everything. fucking deal, pal? statement nothing point community leaders routinely hold exempt rules apply citizens enacted public good. early days pandemic huge chassidic weddings; gather around bonfires burn masks daven (pray) mass groups potential become super-spreader events kill people communities elsewhere City travel around mask less. held accountable actions like citizen!! That's point--how hell get anti-semitism Hitler that.?!?!

They're also violating Jewish principles--pikuach nefesh requires protect preserve life--but that's another deal nothing statement rabbi violated state health department regs accountable danger put people in. 

Be careful toss around phrases like antisemitism bigot, name Hitler, buddy. apparently know fuck talking save offending people outing moron post things understand. 
Gey kakh afn yam! Guessing believe Big Guy upstairs side let anything bad happen them... college kids may fuck 90 year old nursing home infect them. 

I understand stay inside cure!

There point living chance illness. Thats 2 months straight bed. careful going toilet breathing heart problems (I tiny flat still problem).
I still struggling walk around. That's thanks random medication tested gp came medical school one wanted help help. one believed sick bothered check. Doctors told depressed anxious. 

I still unwell without job idk what's going happen liberal troll bot pretending far right? Bet read whole number... FL still 90 deaths day cases well hospitalizations stopped going down. Maybe go bit slower lifting restrictions? Dude feed troll. Well im speaking observable right now. 

Right now, governments running money. Right now, people compliant. Right now, parties, dining out, movies theaters, public interaction taking place people tired living like this, another year? Yeah right. Right now, vaccine projected hit market vulnerable populations end year. That’s think think. New case records set Alaska, Colorado, Indiana, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Utah Wyoming. Record numbers deaths reported Kansas, Missouri South Dakota. 

I would like celebrate Wisconsin list we're still absolute trash following governor's mandates, health emergency/advisories local health departments. It’s completely nonsensical. Pandemics always end. Even without vaccine, people would go back normal resign high death toll needed herd immunity eventually. People convinced take precautions years years virus isn’t going kill vast majority us (that’s downplay COVID; know it’s far worse flu, etc.). don't. like Germans least. still discussion denial hell drug. Cite ONE simply observational study/retrospective analysis. impossible ""prove"" something without isolating independent variable. Previous RCTs respiratory diseases (mostly influenza) shown significant effects mask usage transmission (http://philosophers-stone.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/MasksDon-twork-4.pdf). precedent mask usage. certainly hope masks work, properly designed RCT, air. differ. mathematical models CDC uses predict analyze influenza wild guesses. concede numbers confirmed cases COVID vs flu numbers reached different means, doesn’t make apples oranges. 

But maybe shouldn’t surprised since didn’t know global average differs regional average. Yep. I’ve peeing signs neighborhood. much fun. best fun. adding swastikas. Florida already handling virus poorly,

Florida remained largely open death rate 1/3 likes NY NJ heavy restrictions half year end sight.


Explain metric Florida handling poorly. think there's evidence far COVID? Well want someone who's worse Trump pop win 2024, can't stop ousting Trump. actively repair country conditions led Trump becoming President show again. hope wake 5 hours realise uninformed irrational turn new leaf accepting evidence.

Hope, expect. know. 

Contract tracers put indoor, understood-to-be transmissible contacts outdoor ones. person went walk followed protocol got it, we'd know it.

We instances people know hell could gotten it. no, exact science like that. 

Moreover, many people go walks, wort contact people whatsoever? getting food toilet paper? lost major game earlier today using leverage away limited attendance. stupidity going place millions risk. Hopefully cooler heads prevail, Florida... I’m afraid assume worst. Sturgis...absolutely. Look chart [active South Dakota like rocket taking time event early August. would never imagined many Americans would refuse unite participate defeating enemy soil...or actually air. 

The mask debate insane know effective. Damn, shit crazy ashamed country. Masks don’t stop COVID unless you’re wearing n95+ that’s proper fit check. Wearing mask reduce amount virus exposed hopefully don’t get sick. Imagine many cases recorded 1000 deaths 100 ICU admissions one day. realize 1 month official count 50% excess deaths. firing gun air far safer firing crowd. make acceptable?

Do go grocery shopping? go indoors literally anywhere home? so, again, ~8x dangerous running maskless. (I'll give smaller number breathing hard running, provide evidence want argue hard breathing makes full factor 8). strawman: hypocritical attack indoor activities all.

You effectively choosing compare anything carries non-zero risk firing gun air, Poor baby. used twelve hours day 120 degree flight deck. sorry hobbies changed deadly pandemic

Eh, I'm really poor baby. simply run without mask, perfectly legal even discouraged local health authorities. Running also simply hobby, way keep weight check, control asthma blood pressure, stay sane. things positive even gotten bad place yet. Hope ready real hardships start, doubt given inability deal minor inconveniences. 

I agree. hope implement sane policies control things still can, like closing gyms indoor dining: said, much dangerous running, actual evidence *substantial* contributors spread covid (people test positive twice likely eaten two weeks prior test people tested negative, though could sign general recklessness). Given reproduction number hovered around 1, good chance minor changes would enough. Yeah thats correct. also thought schools could re-open Spring 2021. What's big deal here? We'll vaccine that's allowed every American April. you’re telling subset patients sick enough go hospital sick enough seek outpatient care experiencing lingering symptoms?

This seems like sucks like it’s significant enough say flat out: “if get COVID 80% chance life altering set lingering symptoms.” 

It’s likely majority cases don’t experience lingering illness majority sick enough seek care experience longer bouts symptoms. wear masks! Depends look it. videos broken archive link. They're amazing. Use NYTimes link works you. agree it’s bad thought ans great survived Give people lot confidence before. It’s ok open economy people obsessed w getting rid masks. open still try little safe. It’s one other. also assuming. Next summer could either living normal life, still prisoner virus. Chances we’ll somewhere middle, where? utterly impossible effectively contact trace many cases. Contact tracing works spread low manageable level. upvoted again! must right! 700 million gotten 1 million died like half year. Pretty bad. that’s assuming numbers accurate (they’re not) censored subreddit moderators, allowed create rules. could start subreddit, join existing subreddit allows it, post share heart's content.

I could make post /r/COVID19 talks politician's comments virus, whether left right, it'd get removed, since within rules. mean I'm censored moderators bad removing ""non-violent"" content.

This case someone getting mad volunteer moderators making entire blog post it, citing ""censorship"". Insert CJ GTA Meme:

Ah ****, go again. 

In seriousness, sucks Italy world.  remember summer death rate high hopsitals overcrowded.  guys moved goal posts full eradication now? Redfield head CDC said months ago is. Shocker! almost like lockdowns nothing. 3/4 dead rise. Trump us? It’s like wearing shoes point. Don’t know it’s hard people set forget it. Nah, science understanding risk management instead denying science pretending invincible. ? 

The NIH links compilation RCTs WTF talking about? true younger people risk aswell, number people 25 risk virus incredibly small. odds dying traffic accident youre 25 greater dying covid certain part society thinks everything conspiracy, matter is. health experts say wearing masks offers level virus protection, naysayers object, claiming ""masks nothing"", merely effort higher powers ""control masses"". Alternately, science concluded masks ***not*** effective virus mitigation tool, naysayers would object, saying known masks known mitigate virus transmission, evidenced use masks hospital operating rooms, government withholding known health tools form population culling.  

It attempt look, ""smart"", claiming know something average people don't. Almost 100% time, wrong, also little bit crazy. Cool opinion. And?  guys moved back cases important statistic now?  Florida never high death rate kept hospitals crowding, literally preventative measures for. Eradication never objective. can't keep flipping back forth data points satisfy agenda. read something decrease line Science said required save planet climate catastrophe. catch keep decreasing amount every year. is, keep tightening measures every year. They’re also pretty introverted country. average Swede somewhat socially distancing this. restrictions stopped big events.

They’re also one healthiest wealthiest countries world. Low obesity diabetes rates citizens active. Even though vast majority population lives urban centers, cities aren’t dense.

They lack major risk factors states, even they’re still seeing far worse numbers (both covid economically) neighbors. Seeing countries fucked help compliance messurements like maskes. 

Germans see Netherlands France. drawing strawman conclusion nobody arguing for. 

Nobody saying ""let elderly die, they'll die anyways"". 

What people saying is: 

1. Everybody, matter old young die anyways point lives.

2. average, young people years live elderly people.

3. Covid deadly old people median age COVID casualties 82.

Those three objective 100% proven facts free draw whatever conclusion think reached three facts. 

But make mistake: nobody advocating culling elderly. 

I invite come live real world though decisions must made minimize number deaths due missed cancer appointments, extreme poverty, increase crime yes, Covid. Republican governor put mandatory mask mandate. rescinded day later minority influential snowflake republicans whined it. bad been. Set record deaths last week. might already late Omaha area. Hospital occupancy 88% right now. one still believes like flu going convinced study. right uptick much lower, infection rate already high. Yes, means there’s vast amounts money made, means vast amounts capitalists trying maximize returns fleece consumers customers wear masks visiting healthcare facilities? workers wearing them? guys still Oktoberfest? weird nursing homes pay hazard pay, hospital.

She's exposed twice. second time, testing negative, Dr recommended quarantine days retest, given date exposure. hospital made come work. Yet, ads recently keep saying safe hospital is.... Looking advice. 

About move back family's house (4 them). Cant afford place till holidays. take covid serious. wear masks stores that's it. Cases going area (PA). gonna shock I've somewhere middle last couple months.

People live others taking precautions, tips?

I either job locked room studying really around much thats one thing . Don’t love she’s one getting upvoted? SMH. They’ll never see bigger picture people like us. really hope she’s troll blatant bragging is. RCTs literally gold standard. isolate independent variable. zero knowledge scientific method know lmao. Nope.

August 7th: there's wedding Maine Sept 5th, there's 5 confirmed literally 400,000 people course week (at time) masks social distancing want believe seeing uptick cases area due event 2 months ago still killed 1 person? guy died 2 weeks rally there's nothing since.  Lemonade silver linings. Sweden test much Germany days (since June). wear damn mask leave home, keep on, spare mental gymnastics. Lol, stupidest shit gets upvoted sub every day, congrats guess. Literally letting bots shape views.

Edit: upvoted comment even tho dumb, cause want feel good yourself. Florida decided take today reporting results all.
We screwed. supposed magically protect cure them. part, enough. know limits. Yes officer, comment right (replying deleted reply - seemed good reply?)

Certainly agree vaccines - everything seems going well can, though course waiting definitive results actually work.

Reinfection seem rare - concern (if understand correctly) infections would needed sequenced, would need sufficient differences prove reinfection opposed resurgence. assume worst case, first infection mild, second severe, unlikely first would sequenced (as mild), (yet) know happening. course time element - immunity lasts year, small numbers reinfections seeing statistical outliers? 

But overall yes I'm hopeful - well kinda really!! That's easy: transhumance. October. always reminded lich. saw picture recently purple looking lips solidified matter me. Exactly. flu kill kids. live Madrid yet see checkpoint enter leave lockdown zone go work nightly. So. Yes. totally enforcing something press around. Meh. 27 30 percent most. blaming people ""wanting live lives"". That's want.

It's blaming people assuming entire world put pandemic charade make trump look bad. Everyone thought ""crisis actor"" angle ridiculous Sandy Hook. Choosing believe 213,000+ americans nothing crisis actors exist, calling global tragedy ""hoax"" refusing take even basic safety precautions (wear masks people), causing people die far ""letting people live lives"" gets though. Yeah China called totalitarian. Learn history   initial comment says *little* (mild) symptoms. thing people don’t get open fully still half empty, worse, especially death count starts going again. people think it’s choice economy lives don’t realize simplified false choice like want lockdown, less deaths, smaller shorter overall hit economy, want dumb shit kill people tank economy worse listened experts know armchair experts think know better. also legal issue mandatory masks. MP simply legal right declare something like mandatory masks public Denmark? opened schools April (with distancing) mask policies pretty lax. numbers spiked late August.

From gather good amount inter-European travel summer. cases spiking Europe seems happening time, around summer transitioned autumn. Could spike ruled product seasonality Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions? wild comparing North Dakota Montana numbers neighbors north. Pretty similar population size/density total deaths Saskatchewan Manitoba combined still 50. Trump even diminished capacity steroids pretty scary. decide take information.

Pretty much everyone survives. one wore masks, many people got sick. 

No one wore top hat either, many people got sick. Conclusion: top hats protect covid.

Oh my. Yes, Covid. how, change? freely admit wrong delivery. 

No not, called proven wrong, called second time admit wrong. admission drug like ot offered still look like pharmacies offer drive thru services even schedule II, though. 

So back assuming know everything location, insurance, available services correct wrong that. 

You wrong assume services available, live, insurance dictates go prescriptions. someone tells aresehole, believe them. 

I believe you. course not. coronavirus, influenza. San Diego reported less 400 daily cases yesterday One thing think encourage talk lockdowns wasted grandmother gets Covid probably 60% better chance making learned much past 6 months effectively treating people.   


Every lockdown scoffer gets sick, hospitalized, recovers thank months slowing spread bought enabled vast improvement treatment. Water wet, too. 10 would entire family 'got flu' February. There's LOT interesting science remains done question. also think seasonal effect. summer positive cases visiting nightclubs without anyone getting infected. many big outbreaks nightclubs. One region went low numbers worst country one week due students partying. Dutch politicians listen science? Romney's case could overwhelming pro life base Utah toeing GOP line. Denmark’s curves went steadily early April first week July averaged 10 new cases per day. began increasing again. 

The bump see august (there’s “small bump” “in late july”!?) specifically result two local outbreaks: First cluster tied slaughterhouse Ringsted big outbreak Aarhus. 

Both outbreaks successfully contained, underlying trend continued rising whole country. Beating local outbreak Århus obviously nothing stop steady increase Copenhagen. 

The steady increase accelerated September. first Copenhagen whole country. 

Up point everything largely stayed within younger age groups saw increase cases without increase hospitalised dead. 

Just like we’ve seen Sweden past month... lately older age groups begun getting infected there’s also increasing number cases nursing homes again. 

This means it’s matter time se rise hospitalisation deaths seen Denmark. annoying see much damage could prevented people followed basic rules. evidence would accept valid? Source? Covid. hard follow? world changed Covid. agree. Everywhere else world, ""old news"" now. US, still debated almost daily, along effectiveness masks. Pretty unbelievable. apt comparison would shutting discussion Nazis, racism, child pornography.

Also free helicopter rides! love FI yeah little terms freshness it, maybe aside 7empest. I've never heard anything like them. Personally think record better 10.000 Days match anything pre 10k Days era. Locking 2 3 years? I'm sorry crazy? realise society would collapse long lockdown, right? would complete collapse economy, governments. Whilst lot people subreddit think economy matter all, think funds healthcare system? Economy intertwined every single facet society. society literally formed economy. Early humans formed societies cities economically favourable hunter gatherers. collapse society healthcare system would literally disappear, means painkillers, vaccines, surgeries cancer treatments. Here’s podcast analysis doctors, one pediatrician: missing link species could actually survive would happy lock two three YEARS meant saving everyone preventing mass slaughter disability

Why think this? species know ever locked years avoid disease. species know survived suffered horrible events disease natural disaster predators god knows never history ever locked survived virus. Agree. pandemic, working 3 days office, 2 days remote per week. perfect balance get big face-to-face interaction team/boss getting save little gas/commute time. think value office, regardless people tell you. 

I personally don’t buy idea companies aren’t going pull back promises COVID well done with. One 20 simple things government could done control virus. We've taking shoes airports 20 years one failed shoe bomber, can't require masks airports planes.

Czech republic hit 8600 daily cases yesterday, means 80 daily cases per 100k people.

And give fuck anymore. Meh. 99.9% recover. even news anymore. May well count traffic deaths. white house basically group bioterrorist point, huh? Barr, Pompeo, Pence rooting Rapture could true. probably next nothing. even 20% adoption msdks; it'll shoe improvement.

sadly disease disease spread.

it's vaccines. Ok then. consequences? spread literally member community participating community. That's can't want. live with, every single person might come contact person came contact with. give 20 year old restaurant, fine gives grandma, dies... role that. exactly polled. 

Definitely isn’t AZ. 72% kids going back school. fine. children back school. Here’s latest case/death charts Idaho, running 7-day averages. currently 28.73 deaths per 100k population, less half US per capita average. Wasn’t Germany pretty top things though? seems unless you’re totally closing borders requiring strict 14 day quarantine anyone entering country (a la China New Zealand) you’re bound cases jump back again. thought body kept wanting eat calories chunky like chili baby. Isn’t name Baron? I'm sure way cases. tested positive back beginning September. got mild symptoms loss taste smell. least 10 people know, symptoms treat self-quarantine.

Personal anecdotes make good die it, nature

That's pretty callous. Public health policy what's ""natural"". prevent treat illnesses. That's one benefits gonna afraid 2021?

Why always come fear? imply COVID something like boogeyman vampires. I'm afraid panicking hiding. I'm taking sensible precautions (reducing unnecessary exposure, wearing mask can't). Thursday they've maxed 23k per day weeks I'm guessing still around 37%. Insane true.  Spain 2100 April! Seriously hope there's backlog one. Hope lefties work entertainment hospitality take long look politicians they're supporting. Government giveth government taketh away.  Thanks. website think could use searching range? risk i’m poor country, it’s freeeee!!! Death statistics published daily ~~17188 tests performed, 50.1% positivity. Absolutely insane.~~

See comment, 37% positivity, still insane!  Supposedly Argentina hit even 50% positive cases last week. Yeah Hollande single digit approval ratings one point? Around 1 10 people wear masks. Russia doesn’t work way. Nobody cares anything- people working stores don’t wear masks won’t tell pit one unless boss monitoring fine them. everywhere else. People follow rules avoid punishment. Behavioral survival pressures may make go faster - can't refuse wear mask prematurely dead. Selfishly stupid? stupidly selfish?

:)  Wow love woman’s whole look Europe kinda sus too. reading comprehension poor? ...just wow. trying sound rude, didn’t announce “vaccine”? Tell boss' boss.

I'm systems admin college. Ninety-nine percent job even I'm campus remoting servers. literally two things I've needed campus since March.

About 2 months ago, admins got the, ""We need guys back campus one day week."" 3 weeks ago got, ""We need guys campus two days week.""

And fully expect we're gonna get moved 3 days week end year.

Now, definitely prefer 2/3 split office 40 hours week, there's virtually difference working office 30 minutes home vs working desk 15 feet bed. add cases previous days happened? They're 23.000 tests per day...

For Americans here: That's like 260.000 cases US. Another ""I successful businessman"" work. [Just look moron copying make sound like it’s competition now. Wtf Live moscow reason numbers went from: 3300 3500 4000 back 3200 3500. excellent question. acceptable number preventable deaths?

We still agreed Covid get influenza. Soylent Green. even then, that's _reported_. October 854 cases _total_. 3500 total Sept, 1200/day report. Vaccine will. predictive programming Almost 80 cases per 100k people.

Knock knock, homejail around corner Come Chrissie: dominate it. Use inspirational example Dear Leader path perfect health. Wow, thanks reply. wish start. hospital covid three months ago (got early July) took month recover afterward.  I'm terrified grocery store, doctors offices etc now. This. Like lame world it? :) Look stock market, economy great! 12k? Really? call record? Hah. beat individual states. patents result federally funded research grants, disclose this. think trying regain goodwill sidestep controversy. Guess faith healing even protecting them. Yesterdays numbers came up. 8600 new cases usually test roughly 17000 people. Probably first country 50% positive rate. :)))  private island seem appealing  get new job two years later without WFH strategy everyone wears mask takes seriously live. already COVID summer (but tell anyone people became positive). really need tested #longcovid symptoms. Many ""recovered"" people suffer cognitive issues/fatigue problems months infection. confirmed she'll bench life. right know still experiencing symptoms (physical). 

Also I'm pretty sure read somewhere kids usually much way symptoms, definitely spread COVID19 longer duration. may find children spread infection rose garden ceremony. lot hope get back mediocrity. “The Day Come Be” Today mom Grandma talking incredible Trump “how fast get stuff done. really incredible. He’s always signing something meeting leader”. blinders real loyalists. White House officially nut house...what morons! contrast, cases Africa one reason don’t much air conditioning. also first hand experience highly contagious, potentially fatal diseases. Iceman! 0 60 per usual. Classic iceman Would explain Pence's pink eye? I'm biomedical engineer, PHD i'm doctor still experience general area all. Easier criticize read guess right? That's due capitalism, due tying company's value stock market. thing really matters quarterly profits, executives cut critical areas save dime. time negative effects seen later, they're probably running another company ground. Around 4000 screwed ive literally fighting suicidal urges

No, haven't. Shut fuck up. don’t believe science. believe God covid big city problem... Also completely unrelated nearly worst state education. It’s going ugly soon. year replaced AC spring. lifetime thing, happened everywhere I’ve lived much brain take common sense thing? greatest fear Times Square ball drops December 31, 2020 next date calendar becomes January 1, 2020 lost I'm sorry knows uses public transportation. ain't CEOs. Trump ? optics i’m guessing? project image normalcy ? bruh, episode released back 2010, think thats reasonable enough WHY?!

Why common sense?? It’s me, Margaret. country hate people much (laugh) wear mask, bad person... weird people understand government authority make everyone wear them. that's said own, normally I'd leave - pandemic, many touchable services, I'd multiply desire step foot one germ zones thousand. Air conditioning. sure wasn’t Brazil??? /s Bull shit worst fears lose tons money, come true. think reason deleted tagged wrong person Yeah look well turned CDC politicized way christians want everyone go heaven. Look Manaus, massive 1st wave drowning new cases again. Herd immunity fun concept bur places possibility hospitalize 1% population 15 days... Death one concern. damage Covid absolutely life changing. Trust me. wish killed me. fucked point think never back normal. issue freedoms, issue duty health. flies transmitting ebola around prioritizing economy lives people around you. want go die virus, volunteer hospital help keep frontline worker safe. Otherwise, stop whining stop danger everyone around you. Yea disagree. don’t think Trump cares anyone else (maybe aside family) enough even consider effects choices would them. Anyone taking even bare minimum precautions state minority. wrong many levels - there's 'weak correlational studies' - proven, anywhere mask mandates instituted, drops infection rates severity plummeted. one study, multiple.

And bonus prove get it, included gem:

*As distancing, point ""protect me"". point reduce systemic risk population level. really care get infected.*

That's exactly point - preventing getting infected every bit important limiting spread infected (asymptomatically) know it. Standing 3 feet away someone sustained period time practically guarantee transmission either one it. might care get it, sure hell share get infected. White House currently terrorist organization. They're literally using fear spread idealogical message. That's textbook terrorism. 

End discussion. argue fact, terrorist sympathizer. I'm done saying otherwise. ***If support administration, terrorist.*** Probably real story. Probably meant provoke. true movie. IRL CDC breeched compromised. significance winter minnesota winter Arizona two different things. Likewise summer Arizona completely different summer Minnesota.

The bigger meaning season causes disease spread, human behavior season causes us do. accurate test?

We near shit figured out. highly doubt 20% city Covid. Faulty testing straight gas lit study,. 2021 strong chance like 2020 public transportation usually exist? Democrat run cities... sitting jeep myself... uhh... talking stop calling pro-life party? HOLD. THEM. ACCOUNTABLE. 14 days maximum potential incubation period. mean 5 days. vaguely recall report someone incubation period nearly month, that's exceedingly rare even worth considering general public.

So, yes, 14 days certain infected. Agreed, prepare get downvoted others. They're island middle nowhere, population smaller US states.  options available others. Right practically one get New Zealand. Try major economy land borders thousands miles long. New Zealand interesting case study, unique case. much inform nations. Like one get info? Lol watches lot YouTube know that. also loves Alex Jones, yes, open world round... dont understand. Shes dumb. University educated. become way idea. ........”What agreement on, meanwhile, contracted virus first place.” don’t trust china. New Zealand state would 25th populous state America. Coupled fact it’s island there’s really nothing learn dig moat around every city fill alligators   France: Hold beer software guy, pandemic started immediately imagined app tracked location identities nearby, e.g. indoors near people 15-30 minutes. 

Privacy, though! South Korea's app (IIRC) reveal identity newly covid-positive person sends alarm person's covid-contacts. seems like sufficient respect privacy, me.

They put support Apple Android phones, 10 April 2020, Google Apple jointly announced would integrate functionality support Bluetooth-based apps directly Android iOS operating systems. 

Are covid-contact apps used US? heard anything it. 

If not, not? Sounds easy do, really effective way contact management, much cheaper much much accurate contract tracers asking people recall they've around infectious period, could many days find they're positive. Michael Mina thesis current contact tracing almost useless people *seldom* find they're covid+ most-infectious period, might begin couple days symptoms show up.

I would feel safer phone would beep warning proximity person isolating contact covid+ person within last 14 days. want phone give *klaxon* sound I'm within 10 feet person tested covid+ last 2-4 weeks.

To fully effective, would require universal adoption, though. Maybe app could serve weak golden ticket. enter grocery store restaurant, Sir, need verify contact anyone covid+ recently. Show covidContacts app, please.

That would incentive install app, people want install avoid virus, concerned spreading virus. 

Maybe people pass gate checks status app, enter store. question is, level infection death care? Yea people realize major problem. competition fierce people parts world way lower cost living. happening 15 years manufacturing now.

Time get institutions back. Vote morons November! think past “house fire” description, unfortunately Someone White house cluster going get sick. numbers. cluster 36 so, even real job contact tracing. Whoever gets sick dies needs held example need careful. vulnerable people around us, can't tell looking person die not. responsible people always ones suffer accommodate selfish make sacrifices cowardly enforce masks?

I get this, really do; whenever American politicians propose cancelling student debt, think people financially responsible already paid loans, parents saved money pay university. 

(Although policies affect me, I've really got skin game)

Unfortunately seems responsible people suffering accommodating irresponsible people part life. say Vancouver; responsible people pay taxes politicians turn blind eye craziness goes DTES. many dollars troublemakers pay taxes per year?

Personally family already lives single household; affect us. Although say want infect high-risk family members covid; would good experience would probably feel guilt afterwards. Starting top. Literally everything kill poor Americans. You’re literally talking trump needs sway voters. mine different? people socially sodomized see much difference. indoors?
Are masks required?
Social distancing? 
Will alcohol served? There's also whole continent south us similar time zone. Maybe Brazil become major source cheap online labor. Exactly. China identified local outbreak, likely one among hidden transmission around world, new virus extremely contagious deceptive. China best, far scientifically possible, provide new info world. China nothing wrong except hindsight, many countries still cannot right thing hindsight China. That’s bit much matters, sure, what's alternative?

Again, think article literally people like you. fact going head, devastatingly hilarious. local bar nice patio go times know nobody (usually Sunday afternoon). nice sit outside nice weather cold beer food, patio starts filling though call day go home. never happen Canada (or US). got? Pffft. Amateurs... fucking hospital numbers nothing it

Lockdown always last resort avoid hospitals overrun. lockdown get numbers 0. That's utterly ridiculous stupid. country that. Getting infection rate 0 unrealistic never goal countries bordering countries. spewing bullshit. Measures justifiable. start locking reason government loses legitimacy future measures ruined. know little 7 months course would noticeable effect

How would getting infected restaurants/pubs? get implementing measures target activities know people getting saying 'nah, matter' immoral crap hear often year.

Ok. say ""nah matter"". voted explained 

Curious kind people are


Who you? Whats jib? Another month two lockdowns, we'll see rises winter... again. Absolutely futile foolish. Shame them. opportunities failed. Stop controlling lives. could enforced this? live big city commute work public transportation everyday. wear mask lot people don’t would rather leave alone. Yes. French government lost whole summer gaslighting people, backed state media, making believe everything fine create confidence get people spend. Consequently french people confused tired mixed messages given summer long. 
They could use time organise remote learning, decent testing hiring nurses coming winter. Well didn’t.
So yeah, think it’s Macron’s fault much trump. die, suffer permanent heart, lung and/or kidney damage. Enjoy it. life. Yeah, love working home convenience perspective, COVID bit problem specific aspect. work basically 9 6 sometimes like 8:30 6:30 daily. laptop constantly me, I'm basically still work related things (if full work) throughout evening go sleep. 

Prior COVID hobby required time couple times week evenings vacations go places. None exists now. Since March, aside Memorial Labor Day, I've taken 2 days off. There's really big incentive take vacation there's nowhere go work accumulates anyway. people get intensely sick get proper messaging. need stay home. That, they’ll need vaccinated. Either scenario dramatically cut hospitalizations down. Then, what’s point living restrictions? Im Australia.....due everyone using sanitiser religiously wasnt many people got flu winter. think it’s fairytale optimistic. umpteen regulations new drug/vaccine needs go through; testing, limited release, full release beyond. I’ve worked big Pharma advertising speak experience. 

I certainly wouldn’t try one next summer earliest. said based experience sci new friends back saying can’t done quickly even fast track. days, people Trump’s orbit tested positive coronavirus Taiwan**  turning worse one notorious COVID-positive house parties we've hearing about. guests Trump shindig exported virus parts country. joke.  might care world's future live it. sure constantly posted. held time less 60 new cases week Prague. second wave started approximately 3 months later cases traced exact event. Also high estimates largely come early pandemic seem realize testing increased substantially. thought already learned given early help

Those trials done (along using prophylaxis). Still benefit.

Plus, purely theoretical standpoint really doesn’t make lot sense expect benefit taking earlier. HCQ commonly used immune suppressant people autoimmune diseases. plus people hospital immune system part problem, it’s really something you’re looking potential anti-viral used right start infection. got slapped reddit? It’s almost certainly big wet President, else would refuse CDC offer perform contact tracing? spread someone else, they’d problem blaming them. tracking order publicly known events it’s clear Trump spread everyone circle. official restrictions problem. restrictions put (because share flat person risk) looking forward get rid of. vaccinated go shopping again, cinema traveling. care still wear mask, happy things without fear getting infected.

Look. understand facts harsh pills swallow, agree upset *not* give right try get trouble. Right article lists Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota - 4 neighboring state Iowa got downvoted like really give fuck... true downvote want hear truth. Source claiming studies shows results? I’m originally U.K. it’s awful see fast infection rising again.
The Government allowed people travel summer outside.
I’ve friend whose son mid 20s went holiday Greece immediate group extended group tested return U.K. August 22 positive.
This prime example behaviour helped spread drove virus Europe summer reaping we’ve sown.
You’re right selfish ones ones think they’re popping shop minutes bother putting mask on?
I’ve shop idiots stand door shouting want one thing run in?
And want shout back honestly? time you’ve taken shout probably spreading virus potentially could put mask on. Walked got wanted.
This pandemic shown true colours many. long they’re alright they’re personally effected don’t care... Ah fair enough. impossible find place own? Politicians find sick people inconvenience. Funny thing, created proliferation problem, getting sick. goes around comes back around bite you. expect go away long time. I’m telling asserting thing without evidence isn’t true.

I note cannot support contention, knew couldn’t.

Laters. Iowa also bad. WI's cases skyrocketing late sadly. Low testing. Argentina currently ranks 7th South America number tests million people (without counting dependencies like Falklands French Guyana). look top 20 cases, Argentina one countries tests less per million people, Bangladesh, Mexico Philippines. scares me. understand working home good sone people productivity drops significantly. someone currently looking job make happy suggest try get stop smoking get rid cough. get back better nd mlre proper lung function stops smoking. Nicotine patches, gumps even vaping better smoking. Best quitting smoking nicotine altogether. 

If problems cough try find Chinese cough syrup company called Nin Jiom syrup called Nin Jiom Pei Pa Koa. jus natural things like honey, licorice, menthol ginger. works wonders cough, colds asthma seasonal allergies. whole white house super spreader. dont know continue hold non official events there. Sure start adding big cities like that...

More people live cities not. Like said elsewhere, would take shit ton Harrisburgs add one Chicago, say nothing New York LA. paper, article. Often, teams make public comment results publishing paper - thing saw NYC data. 

Again, person responding talking antibody tests general - responded general well. Looking CDC website. says 60 80 thousand year. Covid definitely worse flu. something trump said Didn’t Russia claim made vaccine? re-read headline.
They talking ICU admissions case counts logic probability problem, evidence much data narrow margin error. That’s happens widespread outbreak inadequate testing Lack tests testing symptoms. So, situation Argentina way worse data shows promise one thing, 2019 normal back within snap finger take mine. [If even feel like taking anyways, lol. I'm young af.] blame weight...not trumps fault obese reasoning...i see already... many testing!! Chances did. Ppl got infected families, family members friends friends friends likely gathered even knew it. friends friends children, children go school play friends go back home infect parents... etc etc etc etc  Impressive given 2nd wave almost everywhere  species could actually survive would happy lock two three YEARS

Jesus Christ, think lockdown enthusiasts get crazier read this. cower home 3 years want, rest us get life fact one first test positive seen [hugging No. Politics absolutely allowed touch vaccines. also think Spring 2021 normal, slow. Fall 2021 going completely free-for-all normal next bloody pandemic strikes. Thank level-headed. mean Iowa?  say soon say can, I'll first line get vaccine! guy crew come back cruise vacation November sicker hell like 6 weeks. varying degrees then. We've speculated covid seen anything NYC quite time. sure stopped measuring I've missed it. Good god everyone know now? logic applies forgive that's possible.

Where else many people attended event happen?

It's coincidence. thanks update. Look mr. two-houses here...

*cries Bay Area* time Well course... there’s invisible fence says can’t infect people beyond attended political event escaped pretty unscathed summer slamming summer season Lake Ozarks, many businesses record summer. Pictures packed lakeside bars Memorial Day weekend reason, people country knew could come party restrictions. 

Many Missouri residents smugly confident covid going skip them. hope right. apologize coming dickish, first all. like head at.

I think we're going pretty bad winter, covid-wise. Even vaccine place next spring, can't see things turning around quickly. I'd love wrong, mean downer. believe see it, holding breath. also fear politics get way progress. thanks read that. last heard macomb county follow suit oakland county reinstating mask mandate. I'll one you: Columbus! Yeah, article fucking dumb even say way did. Somehow downplaying it, expressing high number. like saying New Study finds 98% people psychopaths, imply 2 percent are, nonsensical I'm happy SARS-CoV-2 merciful humans. pandemic could **so** much worse. social distancing mask use neither, wonderful neighbors muster. Given none people give fuck, certainly spread went back wherever from. That's me. Spring one bigass cold season me. Like, oh god, get COVID? ok? politicians vote continuously certain generation it. look qualifications, age. far, odds re-infection full case seem low. And, course, takes years know vaccine works well - let alone percentage.  
Think - people 10X mortality take vaccine tamps virus 50% (among population) go merry way - even tho still 500% greater risk I.

I mean - reddit. internet. Discussion follows thought - everything anything discussed. 

Given variables plum crazy idea relatively healthy people. strange thought - that's main point.

How low morality others (personally, population) consider ""deadly"". stated earlier post, stands right MA, 14 people day die respiratory infections COVID. Approx.. 100 per week. 

COVID, among pre-existing conditions, currently claiming 1 2 lives per week. 

So 2 lives per week vaccine made 1, would solve problem? excess deaths showed way soon caused people missing cancer screenings (which consequences months years). Plus, traffic deaths plummeted lockdowns excess deaths complicated that. says he's part diabolic scheme lower world's population. asked business man makes money people living, would want lessen buying base couldnt answer lol \+1 thought FB. Nope.  
touched bottom reddit comment thread. Tbh thats dumbass fault going first one. mostly agree first statement, example contradicts first statement. Wait, mean can’t get overnight Amazon Prime reliable high speed internet? mean, employee, quality life increased, I'd okay savings going shareholders. winning gift God look like? Good. Even though fuck badly re-opened much early.  also claimed tall skinny.  know either those. Futile words. lived 20 years never going back. Try working mormon company. know unless live there.

As bar/clubs, idiots, say - represent me. Anyone wanna play spot sociopath? It’s pretty tough decision maker Centers Disease Control Prevention drafted sweeping order last month requiring passengers employees wear masks forms public commercial transportation United States, blocked White House, according two federal health order would toughest federal mandate date aimed curbing spread coronavirus, continues infect 40,000 Americans day. officials said drafted agency’s “quarantine powers” support secretary health human services, Alex M. Azar II, White House Coronavirus Task Force, led Vice President Mike Pence, declined even discuss it.

Pence didn’t want discuss whatever reason. know boss feels masks. 


*""I wear face masks like him. Every time see he's got mask. could speaking 200 feet away ... shows biggest mask I've ever seen.""* - Trump presidential debates Biden keep ratching insanity. ""i like told do"" talking Amy Coney Barrett's children. least Vash Stampede help out. indeed one. think article taking UK. globally, covid killed 1.06 million people, still almost double, plus year even yet. *actual* covid deaths vs *estimated* flu deaths. Right? He’s recovering like, two songs. realized misunderstanding is, seem believe I'm saying getting hit hard cause terrible job. 

That's case im pointing can't say that's Canada. large country people living elsewhere. 

From policy perspective thing BC better closing liquor service clubs 10pm end August spread happening Ontario waited long. 

But part yes, geography travel patterns. Folks BC tend take many vacations US, North American designations BC, Mexico Alberta. also snow birds. 

Also virus hit us different sources. virus first came BC came Seattle major break, keeping close eye allowed us catch community transmission early stop early. virus prevalence low reopeneds. 

You guys got hit Iran, New York Italy tracking closely. Plus Pearson Trudeau get international flights. shut community transmission happening long time, even shutdown fully irradicate virus. us pretty much re-introduced Alberta. QALY. I've said long time. Covid mimics lot illnesses like colds flu. deaths even make big splash unless virus got vulnerable population like nursing home hospital. months infections level China even realized unknown disease circulating identified it. time, likely world little pockets. Look far come Microsoft

Sad unloaded stock now... made 30% it, held probably could made 300% could smell shit that's coming way years smell getting worse. Everyone would money. put things perspective US business-as-usual 59,000 new cases today 2 times population. 

Russia's 12,000 cases would equivalent (per capita) 27,300 cases US. headline 27,300 cases we'd celebrating (since June 17, we've fewer 27,300 cases one day: Labor Day... indicating low number due expected low reporting holidays/weekends).

All big headlines countries big headlines they've decently well virus. I'd rather prison. Fair, let rephrase that, imposing value system. alcohol laws finally getting saner. recently allowed people buy 5% beer grocery stores (up 3.2%), hand forced breweries discontinuing 3.2.

Go live year come back me. Dude probably ventilator given provide update. Hope recovers. people use argument also people could give 2 shits social distancing, masking, opening sports entertainment schools etc.. say take kids indoor birthday parties. people spreading shit around could stopped months ago leaving situation schools could safely open doors.

Killer strawman, dude. would almost certainly severely depressed high school see friends. I'm sure I'm one, claiming everyone who's concerned mental health kids teens regard social distancing grade bullshit. 

Fact community transmission stay. going away matter much lock down; virus endemic now. need learn live it. Russia SMASH! We've moved hydroxychloroquine, we're told take medications believe causing mental issues patients. Check India’s daily average September lot trust.  project run people fail. given people India run much likely succeed. can't manage project constant back forth. get bunch people willing work night shifts communicate everything. What?? ever asked Bill Gates would that? Putin Trump wanna kill many can. way, nobody cares. kid cystic fibrosis, pretty normal household, deal stares public (outside covid left property since February), people turning huge assholes others wearing masks. Damn Wear mask ask Florida Everyone believes it, America fucking joke  they're still alive? can't future dead? that, long term complications shown possibility, future still ruined get heart lung defect.

All year two people need do. People get back feet. death forever. less year covid-19 killed people U.S. several years flu.


Over 30% Americans fall pre-existing condition known obesity.


Then there's people diabetes, cancer, kidney problems, etc...


Pretending kills old people ridiculous. 20% deaths people 65. people 55 U.S. died covid-19 several months years worth murders ages.

 Yeah, likely die fool Covid-19 moved neighborhood ANT IFA supporter mom wears mask stays home yet also thinks overblown magically go away election. try ask questions tries change subject says go. I'm passing judgement critical, even bring topics, I'm asking straight forward questions based things says (eg ""Why think go away Nov 3?""). Anyone spouts fatality rate without data trying inform you, they're trying make sort point, usually overblown. fatality rate ridiculously dependent age, much looks like exponential curve itself. guess gather people spout (shiity, useless, misguided) fatality rate whole population care older people (85+), 630x higher chance 18-29 year olds die remember Italy spent weeks February looking 'patient zero' small town middle nowhere they're concerned medications known treat virus causing cognitive problems.  I'm saying word anymore. world stupid. person.  used test developed - actually looked earlier today find published sensitivity specificity numbers, statement accurate there. thanks suggestion. 

There lot people still believe antibody tests can't tell difference different types coronaviruses (which comment responded seemed indicate), clarifying we've got better tests now. bet Trump wishes could pay another $130,000 make bad press go away. narcissist doesn’t care life, whole thing makes look bad. That’s cares about. Yeah. Imagine free would instead state controlled media Fox One America News Network. least cities states still put order place. vaccine already? Putin's daughter took thought. Dont blame snowbirds. Blame govt better plan.  Vitamin levels protective respiratory illness flu vaccines. im lazy get link study. huge international data analysis April 4k views, sad... white house next please I'm kind curious going affect price minks Anatomy lab. teach HS use mink cats close home. Usually $20 mink usually 4 kids mink, I'm thinking I'll demo. try look bright side least get used education, sad =( that’s Moscow ya. People dress Zoom meetings especially screen share really less bandwidthwise working home since march. able take naps bed mom bring freshly cooked food actually priceless. lack transportation costs means splurge family. never want go back.  50k test results unknown another days. Dofo effectively shut Public Health's ability contact trace. I'm fan Biden. But, god. insanity must persist. CAME COMMENT DOPE AF slowing spread filinging hospitals.  
we (and you) knew this. 
the virus go like / lot easier high school kids remote learning, elementary school kids stick onsite learning. system working well places low community spread, i.e. US.

Good health sister. People going deal fact restrictions remain place well 2021. Can’t wait vaccine think it’ll magically get better overnight “May” really complicated. Stop yelling schools open daycares start yelling government stop playing games stimulus/unemployment etc.. psychological problems isolation... 

The people use argument also people could give 2 shits social distancing, masking, opening sports entertainment schools etc.. say take kids indoor birthday parties. people spreading shit around could stopped months ago leaving situation schools could safely open doors. areas fine open schools. Others need fix community transmission first. places need try open doors kids REQUIRE school learning (developmentally physically disabled) make schools available working parents. What's complex can't that, soon one group gets preferential treatment, even compassionate reasons, bitchy self involved parents sue. seven day rolling average went low teens 70 per day. That's nothing. treatments improved lag infection jumps death jumps gotten longer. curing people, also better treatments keep die alive longer lot cases. tends flatten rise deaths, eliminate it. Well, handle 1st wave (that's bold statement btw, lots people died). 2nd wave. come US probably, delayed little. Even Poland well almost 5k cases day. around 800 day October... cringeworthy general. Nothing ordinary.  Hello citizen Earth! see suggesting Chinese government achieved better results containing COVID *the nations* people protesting masks, thought I'd poke head room. everyone fine day? We're talking countries lockdown strategies used, New Zealand. already said, people ignored everything else made China's methods successful. Look happened US' SPH orders things shut two months. That's well good, happens that? Lockdowns long-term strategies, we're currently seeing one Argentina failing. New Zealand China plans adjusting post-lockdown life, although NZ seemed bit hubris. Hopefully, learned lesson time. attitude

European countries can't make sure citizens starve death? know Europe third-world. good leader would 98.1% (where am) died co-morbidities average age 82. remove people - one them, we'd point 1 death per WEEK Covid.

We 14 deaths per DAY - independent COVID - respiratory infections various types. 

It's always easy look news find one case - but, frankly, that's like showing car accident person loses arms legs genitals vision.......or something like that....and saying ""see? drive"". 

We simply cannot use word ""deadly"" (for compared things) know know-among healthy population 70.

The numbers giving right State MA. good public health. 

No doubt bit trolley problem here. So, many years relatively short rest life worth waiting....assuming that, most, re-infection unlikely and/or weak? 65 years old would trade 5 years seeing children grandchildren ""living full""? Remember, odds increase day dying anyway increase vastly far getting conditions make life much difficult. 65 year old lucky make 75 still relatively good shape, waiting years large percentage time left! Mask mandates work people interacting eachother time. 

Activities like going eat, gyms, hanging friends sans mask high risk. Additionally one claiming 100% effective, isn't, helps. What. A. Shocker. No, support that... clickbait title? Go fuck face least CDC taken Umbrella Corporation. Underfunding public health, changing directives mandates INPUT SECTOR. Labs could keep decisions made. cannot effectively contact trace test results returned GTHA average 4-5 day return time. worse delayed testing. Get ready. Fall here. I’ve telling people is: vote office hold accountable. can’t become complacent. Centre Disease Combustion? state doesnt mail 400 page voting manual state measures, offices candidates listed explanations written for/against positions? Su-MASH! Look that. movie trying condition false mindset ""good guy"" People know 200 person wedding next Saturday Cleveland. Hold onto butts hiring welders? course taking proper safety measures, dumb. 

They're accused properly training workers surface disinfection, meanwhile there's single confirmed case world (to knowledge) surface transmission. Cleaning surfaces almost certainly waste time.

Only last item list mentions ventilation, actually likely help reduce spread, state provides standard adequate ventilation filtration indoor space.

They still say people specifically wear cloth face coverings. Companies wish provide protection, like giving workers N95 KN95 mask hammer come formal respiratory protection program, respiratory protection officer, annual fit testing make model mask they're providing.

Here Canada here, behind there’s spikes coast coast blows mind. think mean die. O-H Argentina's [new deaths look bizarre last month. thought one-off correction backlog deaths processed explained one high count, explanation quickly deaths increased last week so? - much dramatic increase cases. think actual functioning government trust gets restored listening ACTUAL SCIENTISTS, could back mostly normal time next year. take big tech paycheck you’re pulling It’s almost like want people get sick Wouldn’t colds make people spend money medicine visit doctors buy tissues etc... CEOs afford 6th yacht :/ seems unfair them! /s Government currently threat safety. seem great. know how? live Utah. cannot buy house everything getting bid like $50k plus.

Hopefully OK. right, point NYC better places. everywhere small pockets cases (at least initially) stopping neighborhood, zip code, school/college, hell even business level places put stop spread hits whole community. Grow rich globalization others lose jobs dodge consequences. I’m southern Italy problems here, wouldn’t consider “unprepared” fair description circumstances everywhere.

Southern Italy hella poor. valley live +/-300k inhabitants. 1 hospital. aren’t many health workers here, tests given fever, although people incredibly diligent social distancing masks, fair share people refuse.

Some places might definitely unprepared, think number people/places simply don’t resources. aren’t mutually exclusive. true: conman epitome toxic masculinity. words Pharma statistician, lowering bar “work” ever more. yet, serious percussions; working home mandatory, schools remain open etc. [So much ""old normal Christmas"", guess. distancing, masks, blah blah supposed listen *scientists*, *politicians*! politicians *never* know much pandemic virus scientists do. 

And make *really* unrealistic chimerical promises keep morale compliance public high, ""15 days stop spread"", ""next year better"", ""we return normal (whatever date)"" (in case, Christmas). scientists long agreed upon accepted *fact* no, *will* take much longer two weeks; yes, things *will* still end getting cancelled 2021 well (Coachella, BlizzCon, Broadway, name it); *no*, *not* returning ""old normal"".

OCS put best, emphasizing even vaccine *seems* over, *not* ""going back brunch"" pretending COVID-19 eradicated. be. Russia saw highest single-day spike yesterday, even *with* vaccine EUA.

If politicians primary source COVID-19 information, *seriously* recommend find *more qualified* experts listen to. *almost definitely* going shift goalposts. course will; they're *politicians*! Yes, might seem like scientists also that, least *they* forgiven, they're dealing constantly evolving novel disease pandemic situation. message might always pleasant (which partly responsible many common folk ignoring them), say tends objective, consistent, reliable, less partisan biased, politicians say. 

And so, listen *science*, *politics*. greatly ashamed self tell *the members Coronavirus sub*, people. masculinity.

Trump quite literally con man. launders money, runs kickback schemes defrauds people.

Con men lie deny problems. Trump's game plan along claim virus hoax con men want marks worry leadership. 

Trump going keep denying con men never admit lying apologize screwed marks. That’s kind irrelevant machines heavy lifting much efficiently men you’re waiting president won’t use drones, you’re waiting apocalypse. least Obama reported drone casualties... 34,000 hospitalized nationally, 18% past two weeks. Plan home improvement activities - ala painting walls, reorganizing, cleaning, etc. also hobbies like plants, board games, etc. I’d also recommend getting grocery store (not hoard stock basics)  What’s saying?

“You get pay for.” President Trump's comparisons October coronavirus flu admonitions fear ""appalling"" lost family members. differnce fining someone speeding debated parliament (in UK) vote held measure passed law lower upper houses parilament.
Here UK Mr Handy cock announces news daily briefing ministers henceforth fines £10K it.
No due process, debate nothing - definition police state.
Why stop - ban smoking totally UK apply £10K anyone it.... case load March/April Europe must astronomical considering France recording 20k cases &lt;100 deaths getting 1500 deaths one point. exponential curve would look way - first. hits elbow curve change quickly. 

And lot ""anywhere else country"" horribly right now. buddy mine disagreed handle virus. kept saying ""everyone adults, they'll take seriously, need government telling us do"". Later week friend threw birthday party, declined go. One people party spent week Arizona (back competing Florida highest cases per day) stopped party way home. got sick two days later (and tested positive). outbreak 20 people. One died know of. Everyone kept quiet part since embarrassing virus president kept saying hoax (everyone around supports Trump). 

A couple weeks later, guy invited mutual friend go fishing. declined. ended getting rained out, dude invited us told friend ""yeah shame can't go fishing. supposed work today huge virus outbreak shut I'm quarantined two weeks.""

My buddy finally admitted right. People able right thing own. 

Another friend mine caught coworker. coworker's wife daughter tested positive kept coming work. told friend ""I symptoms think spread it."" 

I think malice. think foreign concept people's brains can't accept it. Go read link That's BANANAS!

Went med school back '05. Great guy, always slipped presentations. Still ap-*peeling* personality though. Trump epitome toxic masculinity. allowed public transport without one either Jesus Christ.

You can't causation without correlation. correlation without causation.

No evidence mask efficacy exists. best argument studies finding evidence might definitive. can't cite evidence masks work, *you* unscientific endorsing them. live Michigan, back early February, got sick, cold/flu remembered waking night, coughing bad, air extremely dry cough. August took anti body test show covid antibodies.  told know sick around end January/early Feb. went old text messages people asking go night blowing said sick. thought would early knows, either covid then, asymptomatic later without knowing it. Abbott he'll make EO, got many loopholes looks like swiss cheese, making basically useless. think going big mental health impact come. last weeks compliance rules dropping. 

Somethings worked great, others pointless. curfew allowed 1 hr day anyways? Let people want workout night it. 

We also shitty contact tracing let things get control. Pls copy part. Really shame people dying prevention fit narrative... lol wait till 2021! wear masks worthless holes matter tiny stop even smaller-as-sheet virus (20 microns vs 0.1 micron).

You want give clear call, bs muffled one. people treat covid response one extreme another?  happy middle “hide bunker years supply TP” “take masks go pack stadiums bars.” 80% sensitivity perfectly acceptable rapid test done population every day every day. Visit rapidtests.org math. 

Or consider this: live 100 apartment building choice: 

1. apartment smoke detector 80% sensitive goes right away. 

2. One apartment smoke detector 100% accurate. goes 48 hours fire started. 

Which would choose? happened within like 24hours. Nobody really knows timeline, symptom progression worked didn’t. Trump likes numbers go guy looks even sounds like could John Lithgow's brother Dr Mike Ryan, executive director WHO's Health Emergencies Programme, leading team responsible international containment treatment COVID-19, says worldwide infections likely 750 million, *20x* higher case count worldometers. 

It's livestream hosted [Royal Irish 

Link video official youtube channel 

Cropped portion video 750 million infected quoted carry criminal charges someone HIV sex unsuspecting people. Glad went food desert angle. likely source nutrition stressing minorities small ways help-getting active locals help promote/organize community gardens farmer's markets (at super low cost). It’s going get worse. spot quite looked Sweden vs NZ debate. Sweden &lt; 5 deaths day 4 months winter hitting. rises back winter, people generally largely support Australia done. keep numbers stable (along Europe) loose measures, strict Australian regulations lose popularity.  


Personally Australian quite torn, industry (the arts) decimated goes another year, non existant music industry time glad state largely COVID free. However border stay shut 1+ years, going hard continue support. There’s two options here: people carry like normal go back lockdown winter prevent hospitals collapsing (which hypothetical scenario....this already happened places). take less severe virus precautions prevent another lockdown. 

There “everyone go back normal nothing bad happens” option. It’s childish keep pretending is. Reopened early. People got careless. one wants shut best way kill economy hcs. Again.  Yeah, turn stem cell research federal funding, happy use expensive medicine, available common man. given antibody went hospital. timing unclear timeline disease makes sense thus probably full lies.

But he's low O2 steroid treatment body stopped ""mild"" ""flu"" stage. steroids *do* work, nothing viral clearance. Children included ongoing phase 3 studies far know. Funny, reading different article body responds similar Lupus robust antibody response didn’t always correlate favorable outcomes. amount polar opposite information thrown way mind numbing. quite buy thesis.

Men worn gas masks combat. considered prudent, weak.

Opposition masks become political statement halfwits Trump. Mask opponents US showing loyalty Dear Leader.

Outside US, Trump inspired far right groups thrilled leader major nation spewing brand xenophobic dogmatic populism.  

If Trump declared conservatives wear masks fight ""China/Democrat virus"", conservatives would LOVE masks.  merely following leader. real curfew. closing bars sales places 2300. 

Instead taking hard measures half-ass around things bad hand forced. like spring. attempted kidnapping Michigan's governor attempt starting civil war. people want happen. rhetoric fueling enabling it. read average age death 82.4 years. Still, hard data transmission environments.
Doesn't feel democratic anymore.
Not intentional, incompetence. GOP decided wisdom stem cell research pro-life stance, unless saves lives. Testing stem cells policies, unless saves Republicans, anyone else however. /s...adly also increases ""initial viral load"" people infected exponential curve climbs. confirmed covid19 severe higher is. advocating police state.

People ready get back normal get involved economy governments let them, Doug Ford getting podium every day beg people stay home case. Yoooo!!!! game changer! people talking this?! functionally antiviral supposed given early prevent life-threatening version disease. That's theory behind monoclonal antibody drugs.

Trump severe outcome regardless. trial, he's endpoints proving works. Whilst agree sentiments, seeing mum 7 months would much. level seperation far. need find measures curb spread allow humans humans.  money earned back. People's entire lives gone small businesses, many, results homelessness, starvation, alcoholism death (aka upstream indicators mortality). people resources time left lives 'start over'. Throw jail. Enough enough. true? would never possible stop people travelling across Northern Ireland border, right Northern Ireland one highest rates covid world (yesterday 1,080 cases population 1.8m).

This keep happening people go back unless actually get people stay home they're sick. Even COVID I'm hopeful minor colds, even semi-major illnesses, get people stay home ***and*** rest. Why. Why. Why.  it?   virus reminds childhood days polio vaccine. think COVID go away, like polio, trusted vaccine. Every polio case deadly still post-polio syndrome struck survivors years recovery. Like playing Russian roulette mostly spring summer. So..... normal = trusted vaccine. forget it. really sounds like they're going full steam herd immunity. Goddamn you. Crazy 20s tell normal people twice age struggle it. Like lived twice time can't see what's going on????

Well, speed herd immunity reached december... Since total deaths count always = total deaths reported aggregate, missing deaths happened last 7 days reported later due confirmation backdating.

You understand one takes serious, right?  like Walking Dead CDC blows up. kids adults maybe even family members don’t get sick? correct there's speculation prior infection another coronavirus may responsible mild asymptomatic cases people, there's little chance antibodies viruses causing significant amount false positives here. 

Most antibody tests used point highly specific, meaning good excluding false positives. result, false positives big issue low levels actual prevalence, much issue high prevalence like this. people's lives cease matter they're old? people event events got it.

Whether everyone Trump's orbit got day, next hardly matters. since early February! 🤘 infection supressed back there. absolutely fine people unwind lockdown. Way get passive aggressive. There’ll never wild year one, that’s sure. essentially two modes airborne viral transmission. One droplet relatively large water droplets expelled infected person's mouth nose. droplets heavy fall rapidly. Unless someone standing next car sneezing got out, virus would ground time got there.

The aerosol. droplets much finer potentially remain air longer periods time. Less known method transmission may concern enclosed space someone infected. Outside, aerosols going quickly disperse airflow.

tl;dr outside without mask one around safe get. Nice projection going on. always one excuse other, it? don’t let anyone in.

Thanks, honorary Aussie! saw called anti-masker.

Nope. worded reply specifically avoid knew would raise point contention. Guess right. Next. agree we've got mix preventable deaths C-19 deaths mix causing excess - think makes sense draw conclusions point. 

I appreciate think excess death virus-related, made pretty strong statements likely read way - example, claiming excess deaths ""due Alzheimer's, diabetes, heart disease... likely COVID-caused."" I've said, certainly are, making claims flawed. 

I also think probably fair say data coming - study posted, though small, came last week. would assume forthcoming? Sure is.

I mean Federal government crazy idea. It’s like coordinated national standards anything else (sarcasm, food, roads, construction requirements, etc etc etc standard).

But sure. NWO people like scared decades upon decades suddenly going appear.

About 3% Covid vaccines currently researched contain shark ingredient commonly used cosmetics. already kill almost 3 million sharks per year cosmetics.

They’re letting states local governments decide want handle it. curfew. still walk around outside, bars closed. Dr. Horus Schitt, MD. Also know oppose Israel’s occupation Palestine you’re anti-Semite? agreeing certain behaviors = you’re practically Nazi People weren’t wearing masks like 2018. days sick people would wear masks (and them). Yes don’t mind masks didn’t mean wore time; back then. Coupled elderly population, high population density, tendency ask sick leave absolutely to. suspect year would different. developed Covid fatigue changed behavior time?

Yes. Like said, make app work universally adopted country.

Yes, they've avoided colds else missed? high risk, low income children depend school lifeline food escape horrible situations?

I'm trying beat up, far it. also toddler school aged children lack colds viruses nice (although somehow caught stomach bug May) think missing overall risk picture. eliminate risk death unnatural causes staying home day purpose life. Common sense precautions make sense passing day isolation becomes untenable. Hopfully better treatments continue help. So, premeditated murder?

I point fact Golden Week holiday they've had, 0.68 billion people travel around domestically without worry. prior Wuhan big pool party, fact China's economy one currently growing world. dispute happening? Dang. hoping O+ mattered least recent US history, highest single-season flu deaths 61,000. that's estimated deaths, confirmed deaths. (The difference confirmed deaths simply total number people condition COD, whereas estimated estimate many total died condition, whether treated not.) that's entire year.

COVID 200,000 deaths, confirmed, less year.

Yes, flus deadly, nobody trying downplay tragedy 61,000 deaths years ago, comparison absurd face now. guess deadly. data's staring us face. Nothing's gonna sway them.

Yes did...  claim. see data protocols online. claim want , saying make else linked paper protocol.

Yes repeated seen msm. Who's right? one. die soon fairly aggressively negative. Speculation terrible, yes look paper. I'm reading paper linked right validation process include tests coronaviruses discussion false positive/negatives. I'm sure say accurate without looking data seeing identifies different version Coronaviruses. I'm convinced paper. shown detect antibodies, specifically RBD binding antibodies. I'm tired bullshit talk, excuse  WTF China more? nearly year since outbreak began there. something still *believe* you. leaked cccp media new years, gonna assume Chinese flying around entire month December January. climate change coming first, Chinese name actually “New Crown Virus” it’s literal translation. actually corona viruses Americans didn’t know care. He’s given clearance go public starting tomorrow. Thursday last day treatment.

Even mods took sticky down. It’s now. we’re still big mess guess depends mean ""cognitive decline"". thought would dispelled ridiculous idea he's kind dementia patient. Oh - see. want add global pneumonia deaths there, also? Well [2,560,000 people died globally 2017 (most recent data could find). Let's see - 650,000 + 2,560,000 = 3,210,000 people globally dies flu pneumonia combined.

So - fact - globally coronavirus killed 1/3 many people flu pneumonia combined (in typical recent years).

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* came post this. least one day week allergies give 'rona vibes. thing husband help, think we're infected! getting old.  dont want play anymore said anything October? least I’m fucking sheep. right, can't definitively say covid January sick month straight negative flu.. Twice. cheap chips.

microchips, ;) No, want audience happens every single time, without fail. C'mere kid wanna tickle ur brain Yes burden prove otherwise. mean, going tell us aliens sent us virus. zero fucking proof October transmission beyond bunch idiots “think” rona sick. That’s stupidest shit ever. key action going elimination first wave, implementing strict lockdown (rated 96 100 Oxford's Stringency Index, toughest developed world) maintaining 7 weeks extremely high compliance public (movements decreased 90% compared 50% California strictest lockdown). 

It getting cases zero via strict lockdown bought time set contact tracing quarantine facilities. 

That meant second wave hit numbers small enough contact trace every case remove positives, also close contacts mandatory govt quarantine facilities prevent spread. That's shut second wave weeks. lasted 6 weeks instead 4 one fundamentalist church group flaunted rules avoided testing. think it'd fall pro life stance. leak China new years, pretty bold assume leaked right happening months later. 2 cities Actually president appear movie. ugly ass sure hopes Oh, I'm sure think we're expendable. guarantee reasoning is, ""We got entire department turning fine 2018-19.""

And they'll never consider, ""Hmmm, two entire turnovers full time staff two year span?"" ""CDC SPREADING FAKE NEWS COVID! TOLD STOP IT. WON'T. SAD!!""

This game called ""did make quote not?"" used good guy.

Damn near every country's epidemic response modeled CDC. 

We put power worst people possible. Umbrella Corp Go back hiding, fucking sheep. ""We're lead folks!"" Unprobable. problem hospitals perfectly prepared nursing homes hit.

So days 300 deaths.

There huge infection numbers november january, also met stricter measures doctors prepared.

Last time numbers like these, already hundreds deaths per say. Today, 'just' 20 deaths. Given, back then, less testing (so infections caught), go factor 5, we'd could stomache lot infections get trouble LONG protect old people.

Right now, game 'protect risk groups, flatten curve' again. Richard Branson's 90-year old grandmother staying private island fire broke out.

The 90 year old woman **mother**. Richard 70 years old. lucky many guests island acting warning beacons. US even mass testing now, hell think mass testing study January, back even China still political debate whether true outbreak. Late December, yes. October, science proven that’s hard no. administration clearly Team Coronavirus, seem care staggering loss American lives whatsoever. 1/1 = 100% depends- president Contagion Republican? Republicans: ""The federal government going anything."" 
*States try set laws* 
Republicans: ""No either."" New Coronavirus sucks. can't wait bring back Coronavirus Classic US. Brazil same. wear mask worry covid “communist” got fucking owned science still ignore truth. Go back licking red hat mans ass. well-said. Thank you. Aka cable tv package Shocking Sure. support researching it. support BBC making little videos proven thing. doubt it, entire family sick fuck entire month January symptoms suspiciously like covid. Went doctor, tested flu.. Negative. thanks. refuses quit though....Sucks. might get though! David Nabarro political appointment WHO, choice made rightwing English government.

He trotting standard rightwing nonsense, go back making money everything alright.

Rightwing governments around world sky-high death tolls Covid19, whilst left-wing governments far better success saving lives citizens.

Most pernicious Nabarro's misleading claims notion open economy benefit poor. concealing that's virus, lockdowns, causing economy fail. People go shopping plague. 

Sweden opted keep economy open, using logic Nabarro. result Covid19 death toll five ten times higher Sweden's neighbors, whilst economic result crap economy might well closed down.

Dr Navarro speaks billionaires, people. No. saying that.

Disney World HUGE. Like fit California property inside parking lot Epcot huge. People also spend good portion time outdoors.

You're much closer quarters eating average restaurant Orlando Disney crowds they've seen far. Now, typical summer crowds, would different story, don't, they've better enforcing rules.

Those live may realize ones driving response FL. voluntarily shut governor absolutely nothing. opening up, TONS space social distancing, much better situated businesses safe possible.

Not huge fan opening, I'd go I'd go many local businesses here. Noone give exact answer that, lot things factor that.

But I'd say long demographic patients hospital change number climb high enough beds (and nurses operate those) percentage may stay same.

There'll likely patients we'll higher numbers before, hospital staff learned lot regarding stuff works.
Oxygen treatment example different patterns afaik. Also certain meds earlier hospilisation make difference.

It really depends occupancy though. triage comes play there'll likely more. may also effect critically ill patients flown different hospital nearest one full.

As said, I'm expert there's lot factors playing that. number operatable beds experience earlier year help lot Why? plausible immunological viewpoint get infected CCCs child cause disease usually get mild asymptomatic presentation upon reinfection. paint kind outsider view much evidence mutation hypothesis either.
Also, absolute number antibodies obviously thing matters comes immunity (i.e. memory B cells, cells etc.).   ""Honorable President Trump""

🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂 OC43 still deadly cases - example, nursing home [8% mortality speculate somehow population was, chance, shielded OC43 time leading this. Fucking Ah right thank you. don’t think many western countries enact strict lockdowns future. mostly restrictions sometimes strict ones lockdowns. Mate, prime example situation handled everywhere April still true day. reacted faster anyone else, everyone wore masks (not like today) things properly. probably realize effectively postponed peak (yes, peak every country back April slowly surely again) obvious suffer, mainly simply enough people antibodies even disappear like 2 weeks. 

The second issue people fed everything properly. Careless individuals started travelling went clubbing like idiots even knew symptoms. even defeated COVID back April, would close borders several months years order eliminate risks connected travelling Czechs also foreigners (and yes happened summer well) bringing back in. imagine that? Yeah, neither. really understand point here, everyone including tourists behaved orderly wore masks properly (no, nose several days instead several hours), post today. example federal government forcing states enforce laws. 

I’m surprised advocate US military stationed around country enforce mask wearing. sounds like something average Redditor would want. 

You still didn’t answer law gives federal government power force citizens wear masks. Yeah, right. Anxiety NEVER misdiagnosed anything else history medicine people 100% self aware completely incapable becoming anxious rule entirely. guess minorities high positions company paid actors then. Hey you. Yes you. White House given single fuck citizens ever? go back long ass ways. always show learned shed antibodies around 2 months done it. There's civil war coming dank u happen vaccine ? lol. candidate referring always get primaried Biden candidate. shit-talking hasn’t declined extent would like see yet. Hopefully trend continues see less vitriol Americans. hopefully every country gets pandemic control things get better everywhere. live central California coast, taken serious here, back home Utah people lost minds, Trump, anti vax maskers reality seems completely head. I'm saving this, think write detail. would lot work link studies I've reading last couple months. r/Coronavirus sub already good resource links studies.

Just couple things take consideration: Think long took get (more less) rid Polio, child's play compared SARS-CoV-2. Think latter airborne too. Think producing enough doses takes many years, mention long takes distribute it. think *decades*.

Think quick antibody decay (3-6 months), means natural herd immunity, get sick pretty soon depending many people around infected (virus load) get vaccine two four times year costs *fortune* compared vaccines. countries world cannot afford that. guess imagine much India trouble. African countries (combine fact 20% African population HIV-positive too). means *lot* people die next decades.

Think SARS-CoV-2 weakens immune system, meaning get severe symptoms time get sick would matter time end disabled (unable work, think late stage symptoms COPD, mention neurological psychological symptoms) even die. Think many people able get vaccine can't afford anti-vaxxers.

Think vaccine helps immune system produce antibodies, meaning still need lot good antiviral treatment sick and/or old people bodies respond vaccine well. Think children get vaccinated developing vaccine story takes additional amount time. children still infect people. grandparents, example.

Think virus transmitted mammals like cats dogs may cause spread even (to wild life, contaminated fecal, example) may close circle humans again. Imagine could mean food production too.

Think much countries already fucked executing lockdowns restrictions like citizens wear mask keeping distance, already called ""Corona fatigue"", people ""want life back"", think hoax, care anything else, causing spread further. Think long took get least *some* people wear masks least.

Think endless chain incompetent greedy people keep downplaying everything make little money (not knowing lose *lot* money long run). using Covid-19 political reasons. end vaccines available, go delay production distribution vaccines degree, helps virus spread.

That small part, more. lot unfortunate aspects. Combined economical political instability lot countries that's bad mix. imagine happens people realize 2021 still over. Imagine angry people get. Angry people make good decisions, especially comes voting. study garbage. Hydroxychloroqzibe given late, without zinc, toxic doses. know else toxic 5-10x RDA? Water. Slip note doctor follow ADA guidelines. Anyone ever flu tell walk park. Covid, without knowing covid, felt like flu actively trying kill you. lot people know difference sick feeling good. 

My phone records show got sick: usage weeks type. Wild. Nothing else stopped something I've used years. got better. Pretty broken now, dead. reported 100,000 saying well compared 800,000, 100,000 sounds better.

Perhaps reported 1500 today tell us actually 12,000. Exactly. I'm going agree guy moron dumb fuck...but stupid also showing dude. fuck lol. China's govt people decide right now. people need help. 

I imagine someone perspective might think revolutionary war USA simple done grit self-determination. Here's truth case come across yet: freedoms exist unified effort sane people defeat tyranny. solo effort, still isn't. unified effort sanity defeated ill minds last century two world wars. Guess what, none achieved american self-determination. ok reach out, ok give help. 

Try pair understanding time, might like it. everyone's preventative control? anyone it, virus would like country. ridiculous article study. Mainland Chinese rarely get involved politics unless repeating govt issued narrative know better go CCP.

You're also downplaying real issue brainwashing/propaganda China beats citizens head with. New cold war US guess. 😢 Israel. Yeah break study tell people study past point hydroxy helpful. that, gave poor people stupid doses it. selfish one.

You want lockdown means risk fo ryou becomes fraction smaller. care consequences lockdown majority world people living margins. closure borders less spending humanitarian aid, due lockdowns, threatening push millions starvation 7,000,000 people died starvation year! one many humanitarian disaster wake lockdown, usual poorer nations get bad deal. 

The notion lockdown save many lives *world* possible, false panacea. lockdown might reduce risk you, trading false sensation control, putting millions people risk. selfish shortsighted. something dismiss. family, say, attended event one member exposed became infected, may take 5-10 days individual sheds immediate family. say family members continue associate (like work) others attended event, continue infect social group weeks initial infection. reason 14 day quarantines people removed original cruise ship infections failed. quarantined group initial period account secondary, tertiary infections, numerous. study epidemiology sometime. covid, secondary infections outbreak often numerous infections first caused originally infected individual. could mean 10-28+ days transmitting within social group. Oxygen deprivation ya. answer housing crisis tbh. yea we're housing crisis houses near jobs need go unaffordable millenial generations below. TIL lockdowns apparently stop trade economies. Oh, that's actually good rule. Singaporean, deeply apologize American friends saving man. one talking virus becoming milder. 

The speculation OC43, coronavirus, also, incidentally, occurs novel flu viruses prior infection confer protective sterilizing immunity. inconsistent call ""lasting immunity"" - would mean could reinfected time (a year, five years, whatever time frame), second subsequent infections would milder. Exactly. Republicans hand democrats economy shambles - like always - true damage wrought right away. never is. 

Then Republicans start blame state country democrats things start finally taking effect getting better, republican get elected take credit. trump shown Republicans exactly much get away with, they'll even worse. 

Biden probably going win anything Biden doing. Trump beating himself. 

Kamala going presumptive nominee someone even win state. Couple likelihood democratic voter enthusiasm high 2024. We'll probably get reprieve 4 years probably get thrown right back grinder another republican dumbass barely talk. Yay democracy thought figured ages ago. Expected reply. justification acts. echo chamber here, like deranged anti vaxxers facebook mommy groups, could justify violent acts name of......

What BLM NYC joke compared guys doing. outrage obviously guys.

IT FROWNED UPON! Read title context preventing viral pandemic... point. Apparently everyone strongly disagrees preventative controls place would made difference... preventative controls learned early 2003... Exactly get voted hell suggesting we're bamboozled. fair, lot viruses get let loose cruise ships, notably Norovirus/Norwalk virus. They're floating petri dishes.

At least nine people attended rally hosted President Donald Trump's campaign last month Bemidji, Minnesota, later tested positive COVID-19, state health officials said Friday.

""For Bemidji rally, nine cases reported attending rally; one case known infectious,"" Ehresmann said Friday news conference. ""There two hospitalizations associated that—one intensive care—and deaths point."" said health officials continuing monitor another rally Trump held Duluth, Minnesota, September 30 feels like notsaying123 needs visual understand saying.... got excoriated elsewhere. agree.

Honestly, FDA let people get it. Basically, it’s snake oil. It’s sure hell safer supplements. Phase 1-2 data show, worst, it’s dangerous. comes 2021 full fledged approval. now, let people get understanding that: 1. Phase 3 data still underway, FDA guarantee efficacy; 2. that, people presume immune still comply public health guidelines mask wearing. 

This should, least, keep people dying. Maybe even beat curve back bit. least, provide potentially added layer protection vulnerable populations taking every precaution possible. Probably till next October US wil hopefully vaccinated though things begin improve significantly then. think we’re headed civil war? mean get it, signs there, writing wall. don’t personally see actually playing today. hey, could wrong. 7 months ups downs, controls, flares, outbreaks mitigations. Everyone know people cant educated beliefs changed, places go, freedom go will. federal state mandates, restrictions partial shutdowns work. masks.

Only moron would lift restrictions, every one moron charge, theres hundred waiting pack bar think hoax nothing flu. Maybe would sort point actually talking real scientific study  Looks like America competition. list goes far beyond bio. enraging, preventable  administration goddamn mind If. golden ticket idea never work US. apps phone NY VA (because sister lives thought wasn’t safe.) don’t leave neighborhood much haven’t gotten alerts yet. Assholes come shapes sizes - religions want shit get better stop spreading hot takes like ""two good choices"". one fine choice one corrupt moron killed hundreds thousands us. helping. Precisely! Actually can't hold accountable. absolutely mechanisms US civic system join officials, elected unelected, accountable. issue agree me? misjudge me? I’m OP. first comment made thread. absolutely care issues paper leads whether take claims seriously not. 
Maybe misunderstood OP thought saying likely issues testing theorized could be. believe issues paper indicated speculation correct skeptical correct. Either way, seems like page aggression seriously unwarranted unhelpful. 

Even right, tone matters correcting misinformation. People listen tone reasonable context.  bathroom airport next urinal. close enough? joke. Remember movie Whitehouse fought hard could keep everyone less safe... continent Asia... balance submissive moron. war. Biden realize this, he'll hurt nation. Less Trump would, course, he'll hurt it. sound slightly gleeful vindictive it, nice. Ha, jokes y-- 

Aww fuck, real, jokes everyone guess. think that's choice every country make? [removededdit link it. (the deleted comment forgot undeleteparent want willy nilly amendments whoever office time bring argument extreme respect it. Referendums federal issues could address really issue with.

But we're building wishlist, want fucking stupid political party stop railroading attempt address constitutional crisis in. It’s matter belief. Mercola’s cures disproven time time again. 

For instance, Mercola sold tanning beds claimed didn’t cause skin cancer even though scientific evidence overwhelming 

He even settle FTC: would happier wasn’t market report investors. feel you, like least conversation moderates progress, whereas conservatives like Trump budge actively regress country also need worry covid. Trump making cure available all! worked well making available everyone. 
- two family members tonight. Wish making up. Well, American politics. civilized Western nation politics. I'm pretty sure US multiple cities (NYC, Chicago, Boston, greater LA) much higher numbers, overall population population density. blue city? could definitely see Trump ordering bombs blue city White House much control country way federal government country could tell local transportation system could could recommend mean Obama least well-made hamburger. Need America Normal Again. even case. He's blatantly lying, proving contradicting (see recent rush Limbaugh quote talks bad was.

This disease notable people getting better, worse.

Just look timeline late Herman Cain said getting better month died.

Mark words... over. news source Fox News Remember donnie piece shit reality star? Fuck US crumbling thanks one reality star..... Also rapist racist fraud tumultuous three months since reopening been, however, public health officials Disney World’s unions say coronavirus outbreaks among workers guests. far, Disney’s wide-ranging safety measures appear working. 50% more.  Voting issue here. government intentionally designed founding fathers authority control every aspect daily lives ""for good"". national order wear masks almost certainly going found unconstitutional Supreme Court 10th ammendment grounds. Even state-level orders dubiously constitutional.

The issue much broader one. society need government *force* us things good - whether quitting smoking, eating healthy, wearing mask pandemic. really need focus ways de-politicize issues encourage people trust science, try give government power.

The power government use help used hurt wrong people get power. ""more power, elect right people"" risky temporary solution. Yep. really population. Around 4 departments (subsections regions) trouble. locked ppl impacted, stupid bc ppl assumed lying seriousness.  can't remember. taste might've gone. probably get antibody test someday. parties around rose garden event

Okay, still count.

But Admiral Ray John Jenkins. There's one beat virus Australia New Zealand. Twice. never wear masks I'm north idaho everyone thinks hoax. maybe has. never know Good like 100k+ excess deaths Nov-March compared years averaged recorded flu pneumonia think could North America soon literally tests. This. way country ran worse perpetual tug-o-war. It’s like left X minutes clock build huge LEGO right comes build it. Only, time runs out, right runs spends half time knocking down, half trying build way makes harder left either dismantle build upon it. Rinse repeat. 

I feel like politics need sort invulnerability window. Like, laws passed president/administration can’t undone following administration. might slow change bit, issues would time “hot button” time they’re eligible edited. makes wonder it’s going like going back normal(ish) whatever mean. It’s going like reintroducing society. can’t wait. Really sorry go that. Here's wishing safety better health family! can’t. federal constitutional right travel interstate. isn’t prison dude. Overthrow Putin live!!! Can’t mention forum. Someone temper tantrum. resident one states: think two states first unrepresentative best idiotic worst, Biden barely squeaked past Iowa even show top three primary. states cause specific complaint. Difficult say. end probably lot gradual people want expect. Genuine, irreversible improvement begin EUA granted vaccine. much beginning end, least public health crisis Fuckin neat  person flu stayed home. Since mild symptoms didn’t think big deal visiting grandmother inform anyone sick already there. asked wear mask refused “it’s flu”. hearing words year super upsetting. 

My grandmother issue doesn’t 90, nothing working with. walking 15 min church less year that. active, alert enjoying life. doubt would lived many happy years person self-centered. 

But whatever...Masks stupid right? anything might save even 1 persons life might mildly Inconvenience you. Honestly think that’s exactly they’re doing. 

Trump ilk *know* election looking good them. So, better thing tried true method wrecking country Democrat gets blamed fallout? nation finally recovering thanks leadership we’ll put another republican take credit good. probably get 100k day like this. Governors like desantis, Kemp kristi noem wouldn’t put restrictions even states alone saw tens thousands new cases day Next month, repubs out. Vote, vote, vote! Wait that!

That's I'm saying, asking that, listen them.

Fauci others failed, failed HARD, see 8 months results (other than, e.g., 218k dead USA counting...)

Reason says listen ones succeeded. caught throes ideology, demands (more lockdowns, masks, restrictions)... Einstenin's definition insanity! Jared Kushner did: already one numerous egregious leaks wiped away day forgotten.

But people like Mitch McConnell actual conservative leadership smarter that. One party wants keep planet economy livable work towards universal healthcare. steak had. father-in-law went onto ventilator spending almost two weeks hospital various forms supplemental oxygen failing improve. We're 1500 miles away he's told us uncertain terms make trip...not we'd able get ICU even did. hate this. Well congrats - you’re lucky bc live one gives fuck. Thanks insightful feedback someone facing lot stress anxiety. Uhm. Since Trump leader Eastern European country? ""But kills .oooo1% people already old dying anyway""

/s That's true. read article President Obama called Romney bullshitter repubes shocked language could used president. God hate hypocrites. Trumps Federal Hiring Freeze CDC 700 people..... Koch brothers want install puppet dictatorship probably. remember, background news report movie stated president moved secure location. said chances equal? Yeah, would exactly effect two years lock down. Thats impossible.

The economical fallout week lockdown doesnt really give hope event. people would bear stay home long chances getting infected equivalent. State 5 deaths per day state b 10 deaths per day. State open mandates state b locked mask mandate twice population . saying people state higher probability infecting people state b. saying people state b higher probability infecting people state a. probability equivalent? Lincoln killed Ford’s theater. Hope didn’t spoil it. Biden's platform like 90% way Bernie's Warren's anyway.

He may track record ""progressive"" he's given progressives major stake shaping candidacy. get post :) ... though nearly reception original - lot damage done November Inauguration Day mid-January. mostly agree also know pneumonia also trends south find difficult understand even frankly. 

Unfortunately GOP tactics still bad then, they're worst now. uncertainty minimum maximum values (%) cross-immunity population, phenomenon itself: - \[pre-existing T-cell immunity SARS-CoV-2 circulating ""common-cold"" coronaviruses. Taken together, component \[persistent together social component (people's wide variation extent social interaction), entail \[the reaching \[population virus much predicted traditional epidemiological models based unrealistic homogeneity assumption (i.e. \*vs.\* \~60-80%; note population-immunity threshold ""\[the point rate new infections conflated total population infected, overshoot threshold happens often enough). here’s question. can’t CDC publish stuff anyway? abide White House’s attempt block them? People going socially distance forever, that's worse coronavirus. Honestly think could. Id easily give good reference someone regularly returns work quickly well done  Imo, like lazily fried burger, stops condiments, bun. Welp, go again. Highest cases since ~2 months ago. 

I feel like 3rd time past 8 months I’ve thought/made comment.  Add Ducey list. He's good little lap dog. exactly 3 months antibodies fairly long.

Plus generate cells, antibodies even half battle. split wfh office might reasonable solution. Also, evaluated based productivity bad send governors publish it. keep using word. think means think means. Busy school right now. That's another thing forgot mention -- $30k per annum pricetag ten weekly Zoom calls prerecorded lectures. Would love go try things, problem they've either closed close province likely follow suit matter days. /s? progressive enough. Still going vote him, though. yell four years try make act progressive geriatric ass manage. Somethings bit math there. 24,000 cases per million people per day? 7.9 million cases day US? course, seem quoting total cases far, reply someone referring cases per day, may need edit. Russia’s response pretty good imo. locked relatively early first peak that’s helped keep deaths/capita way US Brazil  live, mandated, allowed without mask. tried math that. isolation period 2 weeks, we'll say total lockdown 3, safe. Lots notice, give everyone time stock groceries supplies, everyone sit place. impossible.

All emergency services out. Police, fire, paramedics. social workers. homeless. work homeless. Hospitals, doctors support staff. many things can't locked down. can't afford stockpile supplies lockdown, dumb calculate much need run out. restocking people?

&amp;#x200B;

But imo harder lockdown may answer. Keep truly essential businesses open. Grocery stores, pharmacy... home depot need open. Neither walmart. Neither Amazon delivery services. 100%, would likely lot. (At high cost) Half country doesn’t believe virus real fuck government listen CDC. people whose fucking job control shit like this. exactly expect fast forward 10years study long term effects?

What know 35% covid patients report diminished health 1 month recovery.

And 40% SARS (very similar covid) reported permanent health decline 3.5yrs recovery. Aiding Russia also abetting novel virus.

Bold strategy there, Don. I’m afraid simply isn’t non-political answer. 1) CDC authority. 

2) CDC make reccomendationa states choose follow not

3) Trump Federalist left states make choices

4) Trump actually block anything. recommendations made soon cut Europe ignored Cuomo month. 

5) Fake News see, feel dodged bullet. travelling CA Oregon Jan 9th-Jan 16th, us US mildly aware virus thought flu tearing Wuhan. Turns out, laying roots, essentially.

I friends vacation Florida December *think* had, gotten tested. I'm curious picture *really* going everything's said done. Hold onto shovels Tech paycheck!? Good** Yes getting thicc. Awesome. absurd believe I'm noting grim milestone. 

According **0.1% population Peru died Covid-19**.

* Population: 33,096,655
* Official COVID deaths: 33,158
* Deaths per million: 1,002

Only San Marino higher rate (pop 33,950). suggests real number likely 40,000 deaths Peru.

This originally yesterday removed mods (Rule 2 edited title). honestly think Trump’s gone full psycho vindictiveness. knows major city won’t accept wants hurt people live much possible. 

His rural base also understands mixture hate/envy driving agree Trump’s policies, matter insane harmful us Good. C.D.C law making body. Congress State Legislatures role responsibility.  *200,000 deaths? rookie numbers.* insurance nurse line staffed nurses doctors. usually back insurance look up.online. call them. I'm sure solve problem combination abortion democracy Citizens United decision represents, plus couple hundred years entrenched political interests created.

Some year this, I'd first burn vote not-Biden favor ending dualism. Biden possible next step towards think may actually get us cycle: instant-runoff ranked-choice voting, publicly financed elections, affirmative legislative rebuke/reversal citizens united decision, would ensure coalition-building among diverse interests rarher binary choice goes it. assure fascists ever tend towards that.

Meanwhile, Biden-Harris is, here. honestly think Trump’s gone full psycho vindictiveness. knows major city won’t accept wants hurt people live much possible. 

His rural base also understands mixture hate/envy driving agree Trump, matter insane harmful us listed pink eye symptom months ago. wouldnt assume could infect eyes, like flu cold viruses can? resident TN, confirm. Check info ballot, look prepare go vote. total violation Australian Federal Constitution close state borders well. lawsuits result, anyway state premiers (same governors) unapologetic it. 

They're handing fines thousands even tens thousands dollars state border violators.  states yelled it’s hoax full anti maskers moved country we've learned population density determines quickly spreads. make asshole comment get point. ""we"" different country flinging shit towards south I'm seeing lot comments praising us Aussies/Kiwis handling outbreak.

Just letting people know require wearing masks all, new cases dropped zero once. Yeah electric water bills roof. buy extra screens own. Office supplies responsibility now. point get sort stipend this? write taxes? Well, Whiteh House says so... worth noting main reason Tara Reade's case stopped story found long history false claims manipulative behavior long list witnesses abuse typically pattern-based behavior (see Trump Cosby) sometimes good boundaries, whole story pass sniff test (pun completely intended) everyone know anti mask extremely religious, without fail everyone know extremely religious anti mask. Approval dec Jan max vaccination soon that. expect 6 months get vax levels high enough really stop spread. June July. people leadership trash. proud ‘sacrifice’. We’ll never drop cases nothing enforced half country. Deaths years people obviously won’t vaccinate. disease transmitted via foods partially eaten bats got eaten pigs became source pandemic? movie base real life virus spread way. 

but reality virus different way infect many animals, rare nature. handle control government willing cheat win would prefer die losing money - give 6 months vote em out! take new hobbies 100% believe. conservatives know saying get get immunity people die that’s God’s hands. wish brother. I'm Canada. ""conservative"" premier Doug Ford one implementing measures, realize frustrating lean right live here. people think it’s better never admit you’re wrong learn mistakes. people think admitting kind weakness including weakness medical conditions worse succumbing weakness. people don’t take objective fact objective fact. people fit 3 descriptions. 

If latter natural born US citizens 35 years old, eligible run office President United States America. fucking ROLLERCOASTER said NZ sparsely populated, rural nation. pointed population actually urban US. Kiwis protected virus living tiny towns farms, vast majority live urban areas. 

And US urban areas densely populated Auckland. studied population geography university, something I'm interested in. Auckland population Indianapolis, much, much smaller land area. Urban planning rules NZ prevented American style sprawl houses far closer together smaller pieces land US cities. 

Obviously Boston NYC higher densities cities, vast majority urban populace lives suburbs suburbs way lower density Auckland's suburbs. low density protecting NZ virus. Let guess live Redding? Black people aren’t going stop murdered police Biden President. 

He’ll address black people way Harris VP. far  Well, ought fix everything. 24 states red zone are:

Violent Assholes Lying. big enough library would never bored. 

When sensed lockdown coming went bought like 20 books thrift store. Got 3 left. arguing specifics Ireland's border situation several posts? hard educate trying bail out? you’re Republican, you’re part problem, care happens you? Upper classes US always keen eugenics, survival fittest, master race, blah blah. Wondering cases eat-in, get contaminated takeout? that, seeing even used information southeast asian nations support claims Ireland cannot compared (for responsibility prove)? got downvoted made laugh ass know comment said suppose. going bad... 

Czech Republic hit 8000 cases / day last week 4000... Based population size worst whole EU.

I'm Slovakia (near czech) hit 1900 cases per day (record) czech way. Army called help hospitals.

From I'm friends starting know someone positive needed get tested.

In one regions near Poland borders people secrets weddings (which restricted) going party ""green"" regions Poland, propably locked epicentrum new cases.

Based research:
- 50% people think covid manufactured lab released public intentionally
- 30% people want wear mask
- lot people still think covid hoax exist all

(irony) I'm glad imaginary disease Christ read Troubles Good Friday Agreement carry on. ignorant historical political context island pointless even trying explain without short essay. acceleration right end... Going scary winter. may agree everything, I’m still really thankful vote. That's article says. article says tests compared first wave, asymptomatic positives show up. first wave sick could get tested. Asymptomatic positives false positives two completely different things Aren’t infections platituding around 10-12K? life worth unlimited value, shattered livelihoods kills grew Boston, regularly visited NYC LA 10 times live Auckland, I'm actually familiar them. 

As said, city centre super dense aside LA (which similar Auckland). think way, NYC 24 million urban area. 2 million live ultra dense core Manhattan nearby. Another 6 million live city itself, 20,000 per sq mile. Another 4 million live inner suburbs similar density Auckland. 12 million live much lower density suburbs, stretching way New Jersey, upstate NY Conn. may think areas NYC part urban area, many people commute city them. 

Where grew Boston same. suburb 20 minutes drive city every house full quarter acre lots woods neighbourhoods. Suburbs like Middleboro Carver 1,000 per sq mile. 

Auckland deceptive almost city centre, also outer suburbs all. uniformly dense across whole urban area little variation. 

No one saying Auckland big LA, argument purely average density, since claim NZ beat virus low density true.  I'll bet bull shit. Maybe. I’d argue biggest issue people traveling. CA numbers going down. Quickly. many states. guarantee people visiting safe?

Locals congregating fine. likely cause huge issue-but fight that? I’ve heard arguments won’t allow people travel 120 miles visit Disney... going prove that? many CA residents State IDs. People could fly LA quarantine weeks visiting.

How really guarantee people visiting either quarantined local?  humanity continues exists beyond me. independent, not? Can't border can't closed pandemic/emergency still independent other. madness. internal economy bigger employer external economy.


Even tourist nation like Spain, *more* people employed domestic industry like local hairdresser, non-tourist bar, accounting firms. Protecting local economy lesser evil shutting tourism. hope makes full recovery, like others afflicted covid. look forward songs he'll write goddamn stupid anti-mask people are.  Yes daughter put another tik tok saying mum refusing take see Dr breath. disturbing, 16. Lol, think people participating economy rate sustains small business cases going up? think people Covid, still symptoms like brain fog, fatigue, breathing issues, able work before? 

Covid economy right now. argument there's real purpose historians; need personally lived particular time place 'many decades' understand it.

So, way knowing Germany 1933-45 great place never lived myself? mean wear mask mandated. remember unclear time (before became experts) whether masks actually helped. people need help.

Why westerners insist people need help even welcome help?

I Singapore also authoritarian government here. fact we're authoritarian China certain aspects. Many China copying Singapore. sent thousands officials see things here. we're numerous studies western organizations shows clear CCP much higher approval rate many western democratic countries. ones higher approval rates preaching failing? Would happy gov CCP go ""help"" guys? 

You guys brainwashed think people China crying sleep every night police kicking doors dragging police shot lol. everyone happy.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* nothing lose decision like yet denied anyway. point I’m legitimately thinking Trump admin actively trying many infections possible right election come magical miracle cure/vaccine attempt gain back lost votes. definitely agree, feel Americans need educated difference. Americans uninformed I'm sad report, although I'm sure comes surprise. unfortunately certain segment population, grown current administration, hear CCP hear China. think Chinese people. right large degree I'm sure, saying experience people join military usually bright. meant imply close types people would something like this. judging downvotes, dont like hear lol Weld idiots inside. aware UK Ireland independent nations?

This whole chain comments Ireland land border can't blocked them. UK wish produce UK internal border GB NI hardly Ireland's failing Like cake crisis. ask entirety U.K make matter closed. make U.K Ireland virtually 0 cases controlling borders. comes people demanding control think know fix problem even understand! Yea thats issue second wave began lmao. career?

It depends everyone. worked home 100% time 2006-2019. took new job office (and I'm back WFH now). 

The reason went office early 2019 seemed like companies hating WFH offering regularly. switch jobs old company got bought remote workers got choice either moving office (I wanna move) laid off. took layoff.

That said, started 2006 fresh college grad. problem working way ladder. progressed career office. went Junior developer developer senior developer. got tired development changed jobs data scientist bit. moved bumps well. roles went junior member teams me. got bored switched Admin/DevOps work days. I've got several direct reports I'm well liked CTO (Chief technical officer) I'm likely first line replace retires years. 

I really think career would progressed differently worked office 13 years. 

You also consider, many people want ""career"". want job pay bills. minimum temporarily triggers response resembles autoimmune disease Disaster could used describe first two months COVID. total catastrophe. I've explained NI - Ireland border can't closed. Fuck, actually think long been... least 5 years. real questions. blocked accurately calling out. ok, God *bless* ^positive cases.

Crying fascism make false. fair it’s everywhere Lel HIV?   one would wonder given helpful replies yours. getting tolerated sub categorized much scientific /r/china_flu

Its almost question setting narrative anything else. Remember masks didnt work? turned wasnt quite truth, question unhelpful information, seeing governments around globe fingers somewhere enough masks? whats point may ask, strategic concern prophylactic use drug limited supply.

But guess thinking much hole topic apparently authors study wanted juicy publicity didnt qualms killing people it. setup sounds surprisingly like one first ones UK, surprise surprise, turned kill people HCQ overdoses. 

I going lean window state, title article study nothing scientific discourse hole lot crowd manipulation. getting trained react keeps getting reinforced. 

Let state obvious here, nothing article brings forward new information anything worth discuss. please ponder this, react way study clearly didnt read? think react? 8k yesterday 10 mil population. I'm glad safer place hope sobriety going well. bullshit person thinks capitalizing entire common words, like 'IMMUNE' makes seem smart. not. ride public transit day day would furious. husband COPD one self righteous individuals could kill him. I’m afraid I’d either confront people get ass beat I’d nervous breakdown keeping worries inside head. 
At least separate mask maskless cars. 

I’m sure maskless people thinking, “why inconvenienced wear mask accommodate husband, man even train”. answer is, it’s forever, it’s fault happening, it’s little thing ask you, it’s humane thing do. ^And social distance much **fucking possible**

- Humanity agree completely. think mandatory would comply. end day facebook facts rules rules dutch people. think socially conforming well, different group sees masks submission. I'm sure outliers though. 0.4% still 3 times deadlier normal flu 0.1% respectively. got people spreading misinformation, even reaches politics. Political groups constantly debating rules ( way much say). Government page wich causes confusion. least that's see atm. time get internet. much bullshit. many stupid people online. dumber, louder.

Especially Americans politics. degenerate shitshow. Americans eat choose sides gonna change shit choosing sides they're instantly enemy side ridiculously stupid corrupt 2 party system. Pure utter cancer. worth time consensus people real life bit realistic. Get internet stop following shit stop giving utter morons platform. many people nine spread to... on? Ok grandpa sub literally fear mongering it’s disgusting well duh Anyone works hospital knows many deaths put covid even not, 1 person marked multiple cases covid thoughts reinfected. Yes covid real many people using make money hospitals everyday. generally, no. generational course. health/dental care improved people tended grow little taller. hugely obvious SE Asia. 

Here though, men age around height. 2021 looking like rate. Maybe I’m wrong, I’d assume parasites somehow latch human cells infect blood stream arteries? According Wikipedia “likely antiviral mechanism action suppression host cellular process” seems like interrupts viral reproduction somehow. believe antiviral properties beyond anti inflammatory functions. also strikes interesting malaria parasitic drugs seem particular interest (even don’t necessarily pan out). may theoretical reason test drugs versus medications lay public hasn’t quite caught with.

I assume antibiotics mostly preventing secondary infections. Since huge risk people pneumonia respiratory distress. Lol. Coming level follow along. don’t mind explaining. Honestly, it’s shift happening frequently people may realize. suffered earlier year. worse swine flu, ive also caught.

I'm glad die, really hope embolden would spread COVID misinformation. course, that's much hope for. Thanks explaining. hope works family. Good luck you. re-read it, still wrong. Abortion one example. Anti-discrimination laws another. Examples provided examples fed's inability enforce laws, rather lack appetite to. Further, expand definition ""force"" include methods forcing states comply without physical force, could cite federal government's ability withhold state funding states comply federal laws. feds unequivocally FORCE states comply federal laws. Well tried ""save"" economy using loose restrictions done nothing. take hard measures anything atrocious numbers. ignoring country fire Trump’s watch due pandering right wing extremists. 

But it’s right wing extremists rioting burning. It’s far left extremists democratic leadership state local level allowing them. 

What hell talking “pandering right wing ignoring 200k deaths 

Projections US originally 2 million conveniently ignoring it? counting coherent strategy get control.

But control. Deaths pretty much nears zero treatment programs established. ER visits due covid symptoms drastically reduced well. ignoring guy full racist 

Can provide single example racist though? moderates along left happy it. 

What’s mean break.

And seriously doubt capable provost would considered rational response substantiating anything argue.. stubborn independent streak going sometimes veers stupidity.

As American, can't quite relate! must horrible! 

I hate say since ruins fun, /s god damn it. bets also got remdesivir antibody cocktail? plebs access? sort shit Pence's fly buddy, take people understand Trump administration serves Nurgle? ｉfeel like there's anti-mask groups anti-anti-mask groups. 

And we're kind edged “After research, News5 learned Colorado hospitals entered ""data use"" agreements Colorado Hospital Association (CHA). agreements apparently allow statistics individual daily hospital bed capacity statistics ICU bed counts remain hidden---even pandemic.” seems rougher mental health embracing fall cheering stupidity. 

Corona way fun candidate watch root two race bottom, least covid willing something. greater interpretation situation does.

Sure, people think exist. think 'just flu'. think masks help. full spectrum opinions similar everywhere else. nobody thinks immune small. Uhh no. Rutte literally called intelligent lockdown live television. look first confrence regards lockdown measures. Well course reasonable, would say isn't? responsible people do.

Irresponsible people hold outdoor parties Rose Garden turn super-spreader events. different mindset. average yes much identify height :P absolutely know immunity. Stop fucking moron. US large scale like saw March? probably not.

Other countries governmental control,? there’s possibility pretty ignorant, tbh. US, US dominates headlines. instance, UK going virtually exact shit. lot empathy Lost taste smell due scary sick 6 weeks. Thanksgiving new year.

It spread family. Sister law went doctor, doctor every test could even hiv test. pneumonia 4 times 2 months. Doctor ended saying sars virus didn’t know was.

I sell beer grocery stores, liquor stores, restaurants bars. job gives high chance getting it.

Covid since November California. I'm pretty sure extra careful taking extra precautions deadly airborne viral pandemic spreads asymptomatically considered insane. contrary, considered insane take reckless anti-mask approach times. thing is, happen step outside house, people cities use gloves, masks googles. wait cross people street put mask on, may already contaminated hands, contaminate mask. may enough time put mask also, can't rule rando coughing sneezing face, like said, can't possibly know happen step outside house. better maternity leave all...more education pregnancy *before* women get pregnant, course childcare well. lot childcare pregnancy care classes ones gotta pay for. Theres many scattered useful sources online, women find end rope far late use it. niche treated lot like menstrual products, gotta know secret *look* it, handed like used be. Well know it’s contagious I’m guessing people died found debilitating.

In general though, don’t know who’s going get severely infected won’t be. Covid nasty habit hammering people glancing others You’re fucking killing people guys. starters b/c posted signs. Yeah, head ICU organization Netherlands calling full lockdown. one said before. Things spiraling control. Public transit state local issue. confirm bus driver, passengers wear one. Exactly, otherwise, would seen lockdowns Ebola. danger COVID easily spread vulnerable populations, makes low death rate seem higher is.  sure. lived crowded area, running route filled lots people would different story. gone 7 months running almost everyday without problems, obviously continue wearing mask. always wear one going shopping, inside buildings, etc. Yeah look total deaths above/below average we’re probably closer +275k deaths already still three months go. empathize you, really do. read room, wasn’t place time let us know you’re working home One top comments ""Of course fucking did. like they’re sitting asking themselves, maximize number infections?"".

How civil comment? comment evil conservative opinion? literally world lock opinion? Yeah ain't prepared it. need tax payers here. mean jobs. Yeah, lets head back NC. Plenty space woods there, recall well. happened hospitalization argument pertains lock downs? According data, around 70% occupied, little Covid (5%).  lock downs began, main argument used justify them. realize hospitals hurt lock downs helped (many hospital lost substantial funding due loss non-essential procedures) clearly overwhelmed covid, argument vanished. using justify destruction Nah bro US classified Fake News also went Medikal Skool would kids wearing masks park? genuinely feel like way people would comply made masks mandatory, instead recommended (which already recent, still questioned head rivm). they're simultaneously taking measures, relying people make choices, results lot people going business covid thing. emphasis personal freedom great, pandemic. citation ""killed hundreds millions""? Infected, yes. death estimates closer 50million deaths. happy middle “hide bunker years supply TP” “take masks go pack stadiums bars.”

According view, nations like Vietnam NZ fall under? worth, lobbyist assume private insurance. little nuanced, CARES Act, government program may apply part. case, yes pay part Science whatever want be. terribly wrong. suffer PTSD remain employed. Rose Garden massacre, aka ""The Red Vetting"", outdoor event people wear masks turned America's White House super-spreader venue.

But course, let common sense prevail. outdoors nobody near you, need mask. Duh. still can't hold maskless events outdoors like Amy Covid Barret's coming-out going-away party. I’m California, wear mine outside time there’s people around. Even get mail it’s hand. car grocery store door, it’s on. 

You free live state unending precaution state paranoia. What's OK judging others refuse take part it.

You might also seen reffered ncov-sars2, simply ncov. Meanwhile, Tulsa Doom telling Americans ""dominate"" virus, like kind misbehaving dog something actually gives shit whether afraid not. Covid grow spines based reading news releases vaccine makers listening politicians.

Incorrect. 99.97% people knocking deaths anyway? know region region (Twente) people actually started wearing masks lot supermarkets. Yesterday Lidl think 80% people wearing one opposed literally one two weeks prior simple fact publicized instances religious gatherings held NY metro area scale without masks denominations. correlates directly outbreak, areas heavily populated Orthodox Jews.

Worldwide, I'm totally - people equally upset ""megachurch"" gatherings CA, TX elsewhere rightfully so. behavior illegal, selfish destructive, really wanted convince people religious convictions doubt would hell bent violating laws. comes violations, clearly money (all above, Orthodox Jews) NZ outlier, small island country. think gamble looks like might pay off. don’t think would work Europe though travel.

Sweden essentially shut non-EU residents. also difficult enforce mandatory isolation period returning travelers. point, Sweden's neighbors shown lockdown enforced effectively minimize cases/deaths initial surge without harming economies. NZ done exceptionally well achieving elimination, really never central goal lockdown.

Also, still answered question - what's excessive measures taken countries like NZ, Finland Norway? South Korea, Hong Kong, Vietnam unique spot together countries, Iceland. Hopefully able refuse virus vaccine available, many months happen Iceland see resurgence infections already.

Countries like Singapore already starting open via travel bubble others similar rates community transmission. Many countries low community spread likely soon. core, every country less restricted inbound travel non-residents NZ outlier Iceland see resurgence infections already.

The Nordic countries less restrictions since May. I'm surprised they're seeing increase cases, albeit good news none seem overwhelmed yet. point lockdowns first place get rapid testing infrastructure, contact tracing, PPE production, rest place

In vast majority US, lockdowns basically none things, 2-3 months depending were, lockdown ended workers forced go back work survive.

And people *still* wearing masks distancing -- that's largely messaging political leaders, including president, republican party 2 million died causes really understand motivation gop. seems like want make pandemic bad possible. gain this? must reason stupid behavior can't figure out. completely baseless comparison pro mask crowd wears. could easily compared masking wearing shoes. Cases Germany already increasing much slowly massive spike here

Wtf talking about, number daily cases Germany tripled within 10 days  Funny everyone mother focuses lockdown, fact China massive access PPE healthcare workers citizens, quickly contract tracing testing systems developed utilized.

That's problem many Westerners, sub especially, want one magic bullet that's going make everything better. UK locked focus testing contact tracing, US thing. isolation hospitals built COVID patients isolate home. China went strategy encompassed citizens, economy, government, people want pretend like keep people home somehow magically made everything functional.

South Korea Taiwan basically copied China's strategy without locking down, proving lockdown aspect necessary part. Ok mixed wuhan institute virology genetically modifying corona virus help US scientists Funded gates foundation USA banned working gm viruses. 2 weeks “outbreak”. I’m afraid correct myself. Honestly adds fact isn’t coincidence. 2 separate events essentially concept explored, leading outbreak classification virus studying. 🤔 either one events raise red flag anyone using Brain. No. Really? clue. MN's hot either. Officially active cases 200%-300% higher June/July. Since people generally die get better, number officially active cases time roughly corresponds current infection rate. I'm saying MN's infection rate tripled since June.

Weird surprising. sub bizarre. 2+2=5 Hard read sn article locked behind paywall sign requirement. articles shouldn’t even posted. sub filled people downplaying virus based propaganda level headed individuals trying present factual information

I honestly understand downplayers purged sub. Bolsanaro, Boris Johnson, Trump, Chris Christie--they survived concept karma died. live small place beach. metropolitan area. yes. good news we'll eventually, something like it. There's way around virus disproportionately affects elderly people. theatre's packed, anyways? ironic would tweeter survives Covid treatment, yet catches Flu dies it? Yea I've reading suggests that, US northeast, cold winter might better mild one. optimal spreading temperature seems around 10 C (50 F). 

At time, there's reason believe there's temperature (hot cold) can't spread. problem spreading tropical heat, Sweden March (and, trust me, far north still cold March).

What's going make winter dangerous is: (1) holidays, (2) cabin fever. fear we'll many people think they're woods early spring, we'll see repeats mistakes. again, I'm country half population seems taking seriously season— that's big part we're getting crushed it. words Gunnery Sgt. Hartman, ""well... shit."" nothing like flu, catching virus still trouble breathing negative half year, leaves lasting problems, lungs sometimes sting, please take seriously, anyone else experience I'm nurse. parents severely immunocompromised. dad pre existing conditions mom finished chemo June. seen since January. feels like years since last saw may literal years see without risking lives. 


Florida phase 3 reopening we're getting children testing positive urgent care clinic. get hazard pay tested regularly, real kick ass since I'm LPN getting $15/hr. feel like we're endless war unlike actual war, we're subsidized government contract virus, we're fucked everyone else. One doctors recently discharged hospital Covid son hospitalized too. Corporate still refuses test us regularly spite us never tested.


As manager tells us, can't handle working here, thousands people desperately waiting take place. Fuck top executives. dare thank us run commercials calling us heroes get work home deny us proper living wage hazard pay. I'm exhausted. I'm angry. nothing seething hatred people continue deliberately downplay virus ignore safety measures need taken nightmare end. 


We're essential face masks disposable. Thoughts prayers, likes shares. (For godundme) Problem is, that's pretty low bar, considering level scientific education people has.

(little none unless actually pursued it) Yes, right. kids classrooms staff, hallway? used bathroom. want bring anything home me. I'm certain one else does!!!  sad lack English language news Iran. seem break mean guy shut bridge purely spite mayor like? guy visited state beach family closed everyone else?

I guess gets points destroying Marco Rubio debate, besides he's utter scum. Seriously, someone who's Dutch, better-than-thou mentality Europeans regarding Americans really irritates end. prevalent modus operandi stubbornly arrogant selfish.

The Dutch far saints.  anyone opposes masks simply explained narcissistic sociopathic tendencies shown fuel anti-maskers. good aspect anti-maskers it’s easy tell avoid. Prymula Babis lying allways did. Every single word said lie. gonna let homejail punishment lost election. People aint gonna comply, people aint gonna submit. roll them! went multiple restaurants cafes Germany last month rules well respected, even later evening.

Of course parties, family dinners etc. felt occur extent Netherlands time there. think numbers keep rising days, German government quick install new measures, first wave. Cases Germany already increasing much slowly massive spike (5-7 times cases per person NL Germany), good reflection stance governments white house/fquchi Iran? capitalism intended. too. came back January much different place. You’re spot analysis. goes show doesn’t matter party in, interested giving death industry great profits couple years form compromise. interesting theory. would know real case? see even experts sure man made not... read 2 articles weekly experts accepting denying possibility. like idea though. also true dozens even hundreds gatherings without large spreader event one.

THANK YOU. feel like nobody gets. Everyone keeps saying ""I'm fine I've wearing mask/taking precautions"" never exposed know anything done actually working. whole point virus invisible naked eye can't ever assume around given time. Even gone work 99 days without incident mean successfully deflected virus 99 days -- could mean 99 days never actually exposed. day 100 comes around actual exposure, put methods test better hope work! *not* go.

Like Wuhan government, beginning easier ignore doctors nurses scientists deal virus problem. Gross negligence NZ outlier, small island country. think gamble looks like might pay off. don’t think would work Europe though travel. 

Several Eastern European countries managed kill first wave similar NZ. seeing large second wave. Take look Hungary, Czechia Romania see unique spot together countries, Iceland. Hopefully able refuse virus vaccine available, many months happen Iceland see resurgence infections already. Medical tech doesn’t lot Covid death rates. Almost entirely age. Young developing countries low death rates despite lack medical tech. Extremely developed countries like N Italy NYC high. Mostly death rate reflects age population got infected. Doctor Who?

Yes wouldn’t surprised thought could deliberately infect Biden debate.  know 210k survived this, right? Dr. Martin Kulldorff sounds stupid too. says he's professor medicine Harvard specializing 'using biostatistics monitor disease outbreaks'. Sounds like moron. want herd immunity?  2 routes: prepare millions people die tens millions people suffer lingering effects.

FIVE Looking national numbers pointless. There's national lockdown area different. states completely open hospital room want economy start recovering, states big cities struggling capacity right measures place, chosen want try eradicate keep low level (Guessing change coming months). ""You cited wrong scientists! experts endorse correct!"" I’m talking run mill flu everyone likes comparing covid to. “It’s worse flu.” Right. Like oxycodone alprazolam toxicity. Damn, sharks learn wear masks? Earliest widely available every American. that's kinda meaningless need every American get pandemic over.   least HIV airborne, making infected easier safely manage. Check again. NHL zero cases. Covid well established worse flu, even swine flu, debate comes regularly.

Yes definitely worse flu we've seen since 1918, significantly pathogenic/novel flu span. last time did, killed 50-100 million people, young said, fail see link either things. 

It's not, discussion arises links always exactly that. weird pissing match, ""Covid hoax"" people try pretend less dangerous seasonal variety we're accustomed vaccinated for, ""Covid Mummy's Curse destroy humanity"" people pretend Influenza worse tummyache runny nose despite killing almost million people annually SPITE vaccination.

It's tiresome see binary polarization infected discourse land top public health crisis. illnesses dangerous, taken seriously. future pandemics, next one could highly pathogenic influenza strain, last thing want instructed general populace influenza Big Deal coronaviruses somehow inherently terrifying deadly. many times life someone walked sneezed face? person surviving virus good news, even dislike them.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).*  even need saying point? many people both? HIV never ruled world like this. Try again, fella. 10% still high, 20%+like previously. Ideally places get 5%. Spread hard control 5% appears. *sincerely* doubt I'm one glad go work see coworkers, believe want. thought B&amp;H mail order; that's mom's go-to 35mm camera film. Sure authors ""legit"", legit morons. Yeah, flu infects 10% population year. Without vaccine, Covid infect 60%. Ah, go!

That's debatable considering lockdowns allowed curve flattened quicker minimized number deaths initial countries think best according specific circumstances. judge them. discussing Swedish model many countries measures poor fit Sweden.


If arguing gauge country's response merits, vast majority New Zealanders supporting measures taken would preclude excessive context, no?

Also, judgements, need pejoratives? Herd immunity Sars-Cov-2 given. unavoidable. MSM misandrist. whole narrative covid racist caused white male. think that's bullshit. least part people. People sacrificed much--mental health, social health, jobs (shit, half friends unemployed now) interest government policy (lockdowns) clear exit strategy means defeat covid. someone walks sneezes, could catch faceful virus-laden droplets. told HIV years ago.  Panic porn. travel restrictions zones? something nasty last fall. Like really kicked ass weeks normal month. 

I even leave bed listen music. laid weeks eating soup. awful. NY hot spots overall state 1.07% today. really round two right now. nothing it. 1918 H1N1 strain literally went antigenic shift spun nasty strain.

That NOTHING Sars-Cov-2 me: pikachuface   Lol, I’ve attacked protests hell lot NYC Jews!   Within last 2 months testing peaked higher 2 days. 9/28 10/2. people know it, say worse flu.

Looking overall mortality rate US year SUBSTANTIALLY higher 5 year average previous 5 years. 

Saying someone would've died anyways callous, many people would give lot spend another year loved one, pandemic cut short. probably live tiny island sealed almost cases.


Great. 


Australia, NZ, Iceland, Faroe Isalnds, etc applicable rest world.

Contract tracing unicorn fart fantasy bullshit.  Sorry, point suspected it, made clear suspicion, confirmed say fact.

If believe something can't prove fact yet, say belief something prove. That's difference, always make guesses suspicions clear those. Sorry reinfection short lived immunity shown real now, wasnt' shocker coronavirus. wish wrong. yes, could considered succes worth noting. Hospitals never got overwhelmed. death rate per capita here, great, even top 10. Floridas response really bad everyone makes be, opinion. Spanish neighbors, comes time start bla bla bla without mask on. tell him, talk without mask. looks hurt insulted.

 day later knocking door without masks want talk me. wife seem believe Covid. No. trying hide fact Trump got COVID least two three weeks ago. can't get virus Thursday healed Sunday. Come on. super-spreader event. Let's use common sense, know short supply lately. 

Last weekend got super cocktail drugs, really bad shape, due fact sick week two. par course, covered up. sorcery?!?! almost like simple masks save 1000s lives minimal effort. Nobody white house even saw coming. /s post comment removed 

Hard paywall

 ([More believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* Besides virus’s cause; fever, aches, chills, cough, pneumonia. ruling fact infect tissue spread way, “nothing like flu”
Covid worse flu. title article ridiculous There'll treatments/vaccines pretty soon. think there's information war countries need pile masks flood America BS rich nation hoard masks anecdotal, greatly affects me. people work decided want be. Home Depot morning mask use 35 percent. Liek say, suspected. neglecting fact rbody learn combat even though isnt immune. 

It suspected coronaviruses typically short immunity. say suspicion confirmed now, people still give crap like true say despite confirmed now. Covid short lived immunity, reinfections happened, often worse first infection. rebuttal body learns fully accurate, ignoring fact reinfection *worse* first infection.  Every government story, narrative

Yes, ones run president lies covid muzzled different guidelines western democracies. countries imo battleplan widespread use masks, others one lockdowns 1.5m social distancing

Masks known effective, CDC even knew, white house shut plan masks sent every american got rid requirement using travel. Why? Worries scaring people economy best turned discussion exactly root problem.

If keep taking information year ago learned covid try discredit new findings, sure its' problem. Reddit, Facebook, Twitter. 

They become part issue extending problem virus.

Reasonable rational discussion getting us gone. Everyone agenda now. dunno, people seem really enjoy wearing masks. see alone cars highway walking empty streets wearing mask. think drive bigger rift people Opinions backed nothing worth nothing comes got downvoted treated like moron multiple times saying suspected covid immunity would likely short term 

So banned, right? Agreed. could see acting like back February know dealing with, learn less deadly Covid gets. mention news treatments front looking promising, vaccines way, CFR IFR's continue drop. think people around afraid might go outside sometime soon. understanding, almost every world leader talking AVOID second lockdown. get point wouldn’t hold breath. us

by mean You’re waste space dude Places way closer winter N. Hemisphere totally unavoidable. mass vaccination occur year all. Many places US (Arizona, NYC, Florida, etc) already clearly seeing huge effects population immunity. 

No vaccine ending anywhere. end way every pandemic has. Sure. meant RELATIVE rampant infection rest FL.

Obviously, can't one worst outbreaks earth expect affect nursing homes. employees live cespool rest us.

RELATIVE lack response areas, nursing homes least protected. course, also found months later hundreds nursing homes done testing whatsoever, spotty.

In areas, least, appears fairly well implemented.

Problem stats analysis lack clear evenly implemented policies. Nursing home road massive outbreak, turns one implemented it.

Quite others locked tighter anywhere specific covid locations set up, mandatory regular testing employees, etc. locations follow protocols tended MUCH better.

Overall picture clearer measures impact actually implemented enforced, gotten MUCH better triage, early treatment avoid serious symptoms dramatic effect survival rate.... works people getting tested. This. It’s incredibly naive think accurately pinpoint exactly “deadly” is. clearly see deadly cause problems. probably won’t know true extent damage years road. ends lopping multiple years backend people’s lives long term damage, severely fucked up. tryna put perspective yesterday bad situation is. brand new disease ravaging almost every single country Earth, end sight bunch inept world leaders. think aren’t going grow old? become endemic? work progress prolong human life brought fucking knees couldn’t arsed compassionate? Man it’s scary thought. I’m surprised haven’t deleted yet Remember president sell us cover ass? going ""I survived anyone can"" point. stupid point especially anyone die suggested 210K deaths. Personal anecdotes terrible Wait, Australia good enough testing mom get tested see other? That's people know US doing. also increasing rapidly Germany, denying that. However, meant cases Netherlands rising much faster accelerate outsourcing, physical location workers longer matters. went school kids scarred faces gone font window. people aware 70s lockdowns don’t restrict essential activities like work buying food/groceries.

Still draconian. Really. Chris Christie released hospital: [Chris Christie released hospital COVID-19 looking dangerous. Chris Christie *morbidly obese* nothing (he went hospital precaution [Chris Christie checked hospital citing ""history asthma""). ""For COVID-19, data date suggest 80% infections mild asymptomatic, 15% severe infection, requiring oxygen 5% critical infections, requiring ventilation.""

This still CDC sites, however seems updated data since march/april. recent data, feel free show us. However claim danger really depends actual number guess. lets say 5% example, still issue. Coronavirus makes men infertile. fun maskless face! Yes! wish would gotten numbers too. spent month work barely went grocery store. bet taken guard question lie prepared. lie, tell lie else would easy look through. can’t logic people position didn’t logic into, I’m sorry say. Oh way! also tremendous amount BS ya haven’t seen. drive there, go get it! Also, don’t know nursing COVID really won’t know difference. (But don’t forget deadly- cannot discounted decision may new normal). also encourage read comment thread re: feeling burnout right now. Lastly, profession sooooo many options find bedside nursing isn’t you, there’s ton paths take. Good luck decision. obviously talking fact closing Hotspots. think people misunderstanding point. Whether given city country actually lockdown relevant fact idea mentally physically prepared area one. think got places free? probably paid ICU beds. really 'help'. They're paying service offer. idiot halfway there. hearing things ? important analyze sources. conspiracy theorist neighbor? infectious disease MD know? People talking dr's marking death covid death happening. Lancet far trustworthy Daily Mail. directly address swab question - correct. tests based NP (nasopharyngeal) swabs feel like touch brain. tests base anterior nasal swabs go far up. swab needed based type test, reagents, analyzer etc used perform testing. like learn. way ""third"" peak coming months. Stop feeding troll. accounts meant stir pot, get point across. Pretty self centered attitude since wearing mask you.

It like trying intentionally flunk shopping cart theory 101 here. Jesus babies one study done one person guessed studies dreaming. Published journal dreaming. know. Fuck America. Keep bringing outlier situations obviously discussed. surely key meaningful conversation 

But also, know one else trail? Especially crowded everything is, limited choices getting due shutdowns. hospital: 4,336 (+250)

ICU: 390 (+3)

Deaths: +29  Tell 210k dead counting states, it’s surprise given something simple putting mask become politicized. better US. reporting massive number cases avoid causing panic. really appreciate man. End day, tryna process shit Good luck that. kids symptoms nearly impossible figure came from. dude, thread specific event chassidic community. yes, comments going specific Jewish community.

But seems thread Brooklyn ultra-orthodox top /r/Coronavirus right now. also see threads netherlands, nurses florida, Russia... Jews singled sought thread.

As far tell, person bringing idea ""it’s Jewish people spreading it"" moving forward i'm assuming troll trying build anti-jewish sentiment strawmanning. Fuck off. mean clearly pro conspiracy science denier. reject CDC. downplaying virus, spreading lies like airborne.and basically playing situation. different face coin denouncing. Damn, hadnt seen Spain's recent numbers. Safe say second wave raging right now. recent attempts creating vaccine bat derived SARS type coronaviruses failed, made infection much worse, years point covid19 vaccine 100x easier make hiv vaccine.

That's specific claim. source that? Wow, Eternal September reference wild! forget, first second rule of... That's joke. people want full force Australia police smashing car windows drag car state line checkpoints want reasonable rules people follow.

If US wants ""eradicate"" virus it'll require lots force, would anyone want government president hate wield power.  time can't another lockdown things go haywire sit watch burn Numbing drugs help dreams go away, pandemic not. Mean median likely similar. 

Here Ireland figures published daily, median 84 mean 82 make lives less valuable. Keep fighting good fight.  tons coronaviruses. pretty basic runny nose infections shift populations. vaccine really make sense strains hit randomly need lot injections stop sniffles bug. severe enough make vaccine. SARS research stopped pandemic stopped, vaccine ever finished, although production. technology vs 2003 rapidly different. point covid19 vaccine 100x easier make hiv vaccine. Aren’t better things research right now? Exposed two weeks ago, maybe. He's still critical time. lol, I'm AU testing contact tracing fairly good. early cases returned travellers tested quarantined 14 days. numbers still match results getting local outbreak. 

Definitely trust us data though. states getting 20% plus positivity rate times, last update Australia getting positivity rate 0.08%, one positive result 1,250 tests. Absolutely correct. Jewish. don’t speak me. don’t see point now.

Congratulations, part problem. Merkel can't decide anymore, left plead public making situation worse. Yes is. People acting bad faith spreading disinformation given platform. another nurse - surfaces low risk compared direct inhalation. Thus virus spread easily lacks direct access lungs. quality life went lot stopped stressing surfaces. stress patients coworkers wearing mask properly distancing properly. deduction could made sub since Sweden favorite subject.

How pretentious. Haha love challenge!! talking flu season here. scientist epidemiologists recommended gatherings flu season. flu vaccine general people asymptotic even without it? article, believe find explanation. scientists suggested impressive numbers aren’t entirely result public-health measures. Antibody surveys summer found almost 60% population certain Mumbai slums coronavirus antibodies, indicating degree herd immunity could work.   Ahh fellow challenge fan. Greetings. Oh, Doctor Doom people downplaying virus purple us. ashithole sub. Addressed article... “I want start sharing number significant time. number six,” Rocha Garcia, 41, said August council meeting. “Six family members died result COVID-19. Six cousins whose early economic circumstances combined lack access healthy habits young age contributed underlying health conditions complicating ability survive unforgiving six relatives died span six weeks. One died since August, closest uncle, lived Coahuila, Mexico. Im nursing home, hospital, we've pretty sucessful keeping COVID also pretty stringent measures keep way. Several places nearby less stringent measures got spread like wildfire. 

It gets tiring talking familes (most visit regularly beforehand) explaing no, can't come visit Im sorry feel corona isnt big deal conspiracy let removed come. censorship work ways, although believe trending majority people understanding risks taking proper measures, one point case. information available find truth IMO censorship threaten that. get it; tough pills swallow. know, want sportsball, want parties, want brunch. they're *never* going come back, regardless whether want not, without vaccine. 

You run, can't hide. Denial get nowhere; delude truth long, know. day another, inevitable set in, come realize right, Dr. Fauci right, Dr. Offit right, regret making fun us. sooner accept move life, better end feeling long run. Poverty negative impact education family planning initiatives. Cant afford daughter? Marry off.. Get pregnant? Marry off... Less education girls means lower earning prospects. Marry off.

Very sad, unwinding lot effort address problems. much saying interview basically FHM needed time deciding upon that. Equality central part mission task.

The week following 11:th really became apparent large community spread sweden, yeah may recommended large spread point here.  CoreCivic runs Eloy Detention Center contract U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, part U.S. Department Homeland Security. 

As Friday, 252 immigration detainees tested positive COVID-19 held Eloy Detention Center since pandemic started, [according ICE case active, according data.

The 252 positive COVID-19 cases occurred Eloy Detention Center ***are among highest totals of immigration detention facility nation.*** small death rate covid almost entirely due medical advancements cheap readily available across world. Namely steroids, anticoagulants, high concentration/forced oxygen. 

The oxygen especially important covid many young people go hospital urgent care, get steroids anticoagulants, oxygen several hours days they’re worst it. Roll back 100 years things don’t exist death toll would easily 3-5x worse *at least*. Uh oh, someone learned logic fallacies school... TIL. Math &amp; science combined usually complicates things.

It reminds Richter magnitude scale earthquakes. increase 0.2 roughly doubles energy, whole number increase equals 31 times energy. They've increasing since mid-August. averaging one death day seven day periods. 

It's really fascinating situation, really cool look years political aspects response died down. Way nuanced seems surface. apply surface logic. website counts things sources always updated reliable without sources, least counting cases completely agree. already shown people cannot properly think harming others nonsense. understand could become worse give inch take nine. even small bit censorship lead something bad later on. sure rough times all. one country all. There’s things annoying real healthcare workers watch psychos like pretend one us advance political narratives advocate trusting healthcare workers. don’t know it, can’t imagine whatever brief glimmer importance validation makes feel possibly worth people you’re putting risk.

Grow up, Mikey. Good then. everyone behaves way clearly see country state there’s lot hatred anger moment. goal hatred directed irrational manner towards Jewish communities, it’s duty make sure happened ancestors never happens again. virus continues surge. take cavalier attitude infect care about. Remember looking opportunity, weakness line defense. point pandemic everyone herself. take warning. Who'll think 2021 sure better year? it'll start fresh boat, it'll still better. True.

**Facts: Number dead infected**       
A total 97,532 people confirmed infected covid-19 Sweden.            
To date, 5,892 infected died.             
25 people receive intensive care covid-19 another 152 people cared hospital wards.           

-------------------          
Note, I'll add two informations.       

- numbers October 8 slightly different: 5912 deceased (+1 1 day), 23 ICU 168 hospitalizations.

- Despite higher positive rate (4x 30 days), numbers new tests decreased last 3 weeks. 142673 tests week 37 127844 week 40 cruise ship industry hit especially hard. numbers lie...

The numbers say absolutely nothing mentality majority Dutch people. know Dutch, know Dutch culture, know essentially absolutely nothing Netherlands spare tidbits thrown across ocean. absolutely idea notion epistemologically 'prove' anecdotal claims general 'fact' merely citing coronavirus statistics frightfully simple-minded, actively, maliciously dishonest.

Want cite numbers? Cite credible polling surveys regarding Netherlands. Remember, implicitly asserting mentality *claim* witnessed majority mentality. I'm sitting front poll week ago directly contradicts this. want prove know way around Dutch culture, news, healthcare, politics polling agencies: show me. I'm going sit back watch struggle come data post mine, alright? 

The numbers lie, do, stop fucking doubling wrong. same. pass a... mink? mean could us long time like flu. 5'11"". You?  Totally unrelated... know Trump done America Hey man genuine question cause I'm loop this. shown airborne aerosol borne? 80-90% US citizens even exposed Covid-19 yet. There’s LONG way go. Go away! need filthy, grounded arguments! comment based feelings here. Coming city near soon. 13M youth America obese fault own. Think shout hate someone mask nose selfish putting people risk. global population much much lower too. 1.8 billion 7.8 billion increasing gender life expectancy gap? that's trivial matter compared wage gap all. LMAO swear coming say thing! According Fauci et al, Trump Christie dead. Obese age 74 put Trump highest risk group, yet mild symptoms like cold flu. Fauci explaining do.  destroy fantasy go back normal sequestering elderly! I'm sure completely self sufficient! appalling bedrock conservative ideology: victor, go spoils. treat life NBA championship competition. amassed means (through hard work, luck inheritance) deserve riches socioeconomic position gives them. Whether 1st class airfare experimental antiviral therapies arch-conservatives believe democratic capitalist society can't guarantee equality outcomes, stoke flames hope &amp; competition keep system going. hope gets full recovery, TOOL Puscifer get really active year, Perfect Circle' last year well.

But, February fighting issues lungs question took literally 3+ months cancel TOOL tour get tickets refunded, long governments shut everything least another 6 months. I'm pretty sure Ticketmaster held money good 6 months returned. big deal me, could picture amount people lost jobs incomes make ends meet somehow could've used money back sooner.

I'm hating this, know lot involved fan could know raise question, plenty aware situation, living it, aftereffects etc. delay uncertainty pretty clear tour shows going happen, also wait October speak it?

It's personal shit degree, pre-filling stadium-fulls fans pay premium price see perform, hard upfront situation?

Still, hope get right back it!  many resources wasted debunking Trump's lies? many lives could saved could put resources somewhere better?  Got sources *actually confirm case caught school?* believe said you’re working coffee table book something like that. ""Masks mandatory outdoors well indoors risk coming within **two metres people**, doctors urged."" Right? Whataboutism work here. Well, huge study first wave showing similar results, released: Immigrants hit others, health workers (of course).

Not recent data knowledge.

That said, interesting results study. appears two categories cases 10% poorest... 10% richest, happen usually social interactions. Give time show up, busy writing lengthy posts praising Germany. give patients urge join anti-lockdown protests refuse wearing masks? really act self interest.

It's even big complex issues either. many people wan get shape, can't manage drag gym? dont want like China thedailybeast.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* comment seems like already aware concerned it? point party anyways? So, day job trolling Coronavirus threads throw away account? first travelled public transportation Portugal week. Literally everyone wears mask. people use street too. Varies lot depending place time day though. Right common colds usually barely produce b cell response. That’s thing nearly them. Covid does, we’ve seen studies measure it. Got source 60%?  Republicans number would have, new disease putting extremely heavy burden medical systems. 

What point think making? Let’s say every day 100 people die normal, it’s way long remember. Now, sudden there’s new death reason extra 100 people start die every day. argument, “100 people already die every day death reason 1, care death reason 2?”

Do get this?  Positivity also increases 11%.  Bizarre. listen scientists medical professionals unless goes narrative. There's 8 billion people world. 10000 deaths rounding error. like 3 months pandemic people comparing yearly flu deaths trying say 12 weeks COVID19 compared 12 months flu deaths big deal familiar probability works? matter also familiar healthcare works US?  still entirely air though. B cell immunity counts, antibody liters declining means effectively nothing.

We know antibodies going away likely lead reinfections 4 cold-causing coronaviruses. 

So prove COVID, seems like strong likelihood (and fact, proven cases reinfection already). Automatic translation bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think supporting comment people used take flu/infections seriously seriously? 

They afraid kid getting flu pre-COVID supporting COVID people generally afraid catching things. decided party February (before COVID really concern outside hot spots) weeks COVID really took off. think party pandemic ([see timeline COVID page here] Yep. We're going get accurate count hindsight. Ah, thanks reply. No! researchers entire world must study subreddit decided important. That's law. I'm sorry. Yeah. went club last night Dallas one wearing masks, including bartenders. dance floor packed people moving hotspots measures might well moot. love claims fact without referencing studies.

Especially say heavy exercise one worst things infected folks massive amount viral particles expelled.

Crossfitters proved workout fine full bondage masks designed restrict airflow, cannot handle masks designed easy breath through?

C'mon man. Sharks eat fucking seaweed lmao Sounds fun!! Glad enjoying college. recommendation one friends fall ill careful consider isolation/testing. Best luck you. agree imagine they’ll rectify maintain credibility. though, doesn’t change credentials authors. sound therapists, top doctors field. think opinion immediately discounted people don’t like says. actually, germany paid, least first time relied ICU beds. I’m dentist pretty high risk exposure Twin Falls shocking. ten year old said ‘why wearing mask it’s even real’ saw snap someone know telling 4 year old, ‘The bad lady Nancy brought [covid] hurt President Trump’ cutesy baby talk.. wtf. People nuts there.

Pocatello Idaho Falls taking lot seriously still room improvement. le enlightened redditor, playing vidya watching anime. like loser guys go parties thin gfs I’m complaining? I’m sure plenty people see outside maskless far away enough there’s transmission risk (or house, car, etc). I’m sure that’s relevant though. Cars kill! haven’t banned yet? No, summer likely relatively normal. may lingering social restrictions highly, highly doubt countries sacrifice another summer social distancing protocol. financially destroy majority summer activities permanently. lot businesses survive another summer gone. It’s sub. It’s reflection truly stupid humanity is. believe historically FDA guidelines strict strict world. Given US, public trust CDC FDA significantly damaged 2020, FDA conservative — say, avoiding appearance rush vaccine approval due political pressure. Early winter?

More late winter. February, following data Wuhan early. covid-19 ward urban hospital? Ya that's it! Facebook telling truth disproving another covid case, good got figured out! opinion, nothing wrong guidelines seeing scary polls US say 50% americans taking vaccine first becomes available. think things change one offered public trust plays big part vaccines roll out. Lol bright side people surviving. Modern medicine impressive times.  know, want sportsball, want parties, want brunch. they're never going come back

They're right lol children running amok make appropriate. Donald Trump cronies: think reality knows got flu shot year every year going forward well wearing mask flu seasons newfound knowledge flu. asshokes nothing every year US, freedom religion constitutional right. People home school kids promote religious beliefs send kids religious schools, hostile science.  


So get people idea basics like infection control. moderate believers accommodate science. NY1 interview rabbi encouraging people attend Rosh Hashanah services virtually.  


 I'm sure zealous Christians parts spread December Christmas rolls around. Right, unless mandatory idiots wearing masks falsely claiming put on, wait six feet scramble put mask contaminating hands would left mask instead fighting like toddler like shoes. Honestly it’s duty get exposed*...the faster happens faster results come in. parties!

*i also trialing vaccine. may medical issue. sad situation family. Yes can, know people who's roomates tested positive. know one girl who's bf tested positive took simple measures reduce contact disinfect surfaces (particularly shared bathroom) end catching it. Wish best, keep head up! absolutely intelligent lockdown, still salvage it. need finally clear masks mandatory everywhere, enforce people mandatory rules fine companies work home don’t. Also close restaurants breach protocol.

Edit: also gommers tv less two weeks ago discussing understood people getting fed need listen well. mixed message. Again. Oh shut up. think things touch 

It's likely get touch. dont rub eyes/nose/mouth hands, wash soon after. say, crowded situations associated high even masks use. I'm talking people think inability get reinfected. aware declining antibodies, I'm saying certain point reach level body immune reinfection. happens coronaviruses. Cool tits. know, want sportsball,

You lose whole argument say stupid stuff like this. btw ""sportsball"" playing right type this. There's college football today, NBA finals happening, MLB playoffs ongoing, NHL finished, etc. Seatbelts work! (So keep speed limits?? 🤔) would say letting people put name medical professionals anything fact medical professionals problem. arent trolls, people already walk around claim medical professionals murdering dozens people. 

'A widely-circulated open letter calling governments pursue herd immunity counting homeopaths, therapists fake names among ""medical"" signatories, leading accusations falsely represents scientific support controversial position.""

Why write medical professionals? understand can't check names everyone signing declaration need check names least people ""medical professionals."" several discredits ""declaration"" considering authors credibility. 

Like even put place people claim medical professionals going check it. makes misleading say 20,000 medical professionals signed this. almost like want us get it. that. concensus effectiveness mask, plus perhaps free people world, hate rules oppression. Liberal prime minister played that, unclear rules advices instead clear new rules caused lot confusion killed support anti covid measures. ....Which took lot intestinal fortitude COVID air like oxygen, still need get close people catch it. beyond 2m distance outside, little risk even see people. Masks alone much. everyone responds equally. Plus, put ventilator, chances survival roughly 50/50. Add premium health care politicians got chances survival might slightly better 50/50, even highest risk group.

That mean emerge illness back previous 100%. evidence strongly suggests less healthy person surviving COVID-19. Lol no. Caribbean Africa many European countries also heavily use masks social distancing. Stop. Get help. Ding ding ding!

At least someone gets it.  lolwut? I'm rejecting CDC outright, came admitted like days ago.  comment nothing politics though... Freaking help anyone. Stay strong wish family best quick recovery. amazed many stories like end ""yeah hospital fine now"" Thank you, well long time. know makes sense! someone feels like i""m attack, right lol. step away I'm busy, hopefully read link offered. time link many studies though, hope one saying 35 years studying coronaviruses explains things. Firstly, blaming population virus sending hospital? Really!?

Real time hospitalisation rates fairly meaningless adjusted population demographics linked back serological surveys. applies US AU data.

\* typo Lol ok. Ok great post median mean median Already late came behind around corner bush. Also take account wind, cloud cover, viral load, etc.

Since caught wearing mask, wrong able mask necessary.  get it; tough pills swallow. know, want sit arse, want wear underpants day, want stare screen home. you’re going go outside, regardless whether want not, without vaccine.

You run, can't hide. Denial get nowhere; delude truth long, know. day another, inevitable set in, come realize right, Dr Fauci right pretty much everyone right, regret wasting time spamming subreddit. sooner accept move life, better end feeling long run. 

Btw still waiting summary Boris’ speech. suggested widespread mask compliance wipes virus entirely? suggesting immunity short term? Based what? 

Based cases reinfection ahve healthy people fact coronaviruses notorious short term immunity? studies show people exposed SARs MERs enough immunity protect years later full exposure. enough probably PPE on, that's still full immunity. Level infection mattered well, asymptomatic low level infection odds getting higher coronaviruses like sars.  mind-boggling see someone say herd immunity work, natural otherwise.

Why? probably strain coronavirus multiple times life like everyone else.  think website getting info from? (Hint reports health officials work for/with cases) Let’s pretend like aren’t bad actors trying take advantage current situation Dude, don’t get immunity works, say it. You’re talking declining antibodies. immunity. Immunity PRIMARILY cellular immunity. ""haha, stupid anti-vaxx morons think putting micro-chips autism vaccine""

""Vaccine? Fuck no, Trump done meddling magic probably injected bleach it. Anti-vaxx? No, I'm skeptical. nothing Trump? Yea *he charge* country, must him"" never ever. kind stopped moving goalposts yanked entirely fire


TL;DR: accept new normal, there's going back bad. thought replying comment said start running.  absolutely useless article garbage website. didn’t die know. plan would stop admitting COVID-19 patients hospitals let infected die home. retail store online store. Btw, staff helpful there's chat feature website generally try buy electronics there. Unless they're closed need something quickly. 


The retail store little overwhelming. large harder get help. get help, they're informed helpful. Deja vu anyone? invalidate authority trying derive experts agreeing it.

Now idea random idiots internet liked put effort actually verify data. another thing makes less valuable trustworthy.

In words, appeal authority foiled original big bad daddy logical fallacy all, lying. Apparently must wearing properly. wear properly cases decrease. reinfection happening likely way happens viruses: rare isolated cases, applicable large majority people. 

... would covid19 different every coronavirus?  know SARS-like virus reinfection occurred?

Given two infections similar happened small number people, MERS thousand 8 years sars forget exact number stopped quickly, think reinfection exactly something would know viruses. evidence short term immunity

There absolutely short term immunity, know fact. could evidence this? around less year. know feel like forever march 7 months ago. I'll first person say believe short term immunity like coronaviruses, see absolutely reason would different something like sars 1 year point people appreciable immunity according one study saw. *some* immunity mean adequate protect reinfection unless use PPE something else reduces exposure. bet nurses longer normal immunity assume still use PPE. quite bit precedent longer term immunity SARS MERS long term cellular immunity, low amount reinfection cases.

There evidence I'm aware showing longer 1 2 years appreciable immunity, presence B cell immunity mean anything. nobody reinfected nobody exposed again. Talking reinfection bad faith argument lack knowledge topic, either say nicest way ever. High profile individuals top quality medical care less danger Covid, news 11. SORRY LIVING FEAR Well isn’t drone strike it’s virus, plus everyone afraid death? part cycle life get it. 

Also hospital systems overrun places like Houston reopened schools everything else 2 months ago. data speaks itself. chance herd immunity. infection rate impressive, nowhere near fast enough hit bird immunity anytime soon time antibody-based community probably lasts range 6 12 months. 6 12 months get everybody immune eradicated disease become vulnerable again.

Bertram DMV even close option unless got like world's people together infected purpose hope would become immune long enough vaccine get rolled none makes sense vaccine soon enough mass production idea well long immunity actually lasts. 

In short, ain't chicken pox, can't get immune life. Except shitty news outlets get FP Reddit. Besides, competent news outlets now, like article, pay attention morons there. Actual morons become news worthy. endless cycle. Either stop watching news keep getting garbage every single day. point Sweden always recommend people work home. Lockdown stopped pandemic. 

We went point ICU had prioritize patient, point ICU could work postponing non urgent care, point ICU were empty. worked pretty well. 

However, lockdown nothing preventing virus come back. us live free parts world things pretty much normal whole time. Restaurants closed ~50% people wore masks month it. encourage anyone wants live lives normally so. Reddit opinions reflective reality. Go movie, see friends families, go church, get enjoy yourselves. situation probably even mich worse. Czech Republic cases, 4 times *less* people, yet healthcare much overwhelmed Poland, clearly points undetected cases Poland. fact absolute numbers tests similar two countries shows farce testing Poland. government saving money tests lose 100x economic damage situation.   Well certainly following republican party last 4 years. 

It matter Christie wants, he's gotta toe line say goodbye politician. 

Even Romney's throwing decency aside force Amy Barrett, he's surely going make ""phoenix"" play reviving GOP trump falls grace. Implying large gatherings fine masks. wonder masks don’t seem help much reducing spread.. US, pneumonia flu deaths higher average far year. Mislabeled deaths due limited testing may contributing, least US. problem might also use deals individual countries gain future political economic leverage, says Jerome Kim, director-general International Vaccine Institute Seoul. “That would regrettable,” Chinese vaccines given people, safety effectiveness needs firmly established, says Marie-Paule Kieny, vaccine researcher INSERM, France’s national biomedical research agency Paris, also criticized Sinopharm claiming widespread vaccinations emergency use provisions show two jabs safe effective. company says infections among tens thousands people vaccinated went abroad countries affected coronavirus, even though **no data supporting claim made available**.

Awaiting downvotes Xitlerjugend. good ol' spanish flu syndrome. Coronavirus similar flu sense mechanism avoid human immunity. mechanism completely different flu, share similarity well communicable humans animals.

I think lot taking statements flu wrong comment often used way downplay pandemic.

however time really giving flu fully deserved credit virus cause pandemic killed huge amounts people seemingly endless lifespan.

To fair compare years influenza one year covid 19 that's statement made. 

It's fair respect flu ignore fact one flu superpowers fact comes back every season. That's part makes deadly. top respect fact even vaccine flu reliably kills people definitely mutate something deadly Spanish flu one cycle.

those pretty seriously impressive attributes look span hundred years flu definitely winner. unlikely coronavirus significantly thalassity kind lasting power flu flu's ability mutate impressive copid 19's strange symptoms ability produce short-lived antibodies.

Be fair, influenza one worst viruses humans ever run keeps coming back produces reasonably impressive lethality even vaccine.

Covid-19 little flu, fair enough compare one worst flu outbreaks compare cumulative damage eyes past moment projected future.

There's reasonable chance humans would adapt covid 19 ss going mutate anywhere near fast flu. there's really chance we're going adapt flu ability mutate recombination way fast immune systems ever keep with. possible overtime adoption that's vulnerable facts 19 would transition something looks like bad common cold.

The flu never going transition common cold even predictable sense expect virus flu change much strains.

So mutation versus short-lived antibodies say recombining mutation ability significantly worse given neither virus massive lethality advantage. 

Keep mind say cove 19 better worse flu comparing one strain Corona virus strains influenza ever.

You're making wrong comparison That's technically corrected sake accurate knowledge.

Anybody know code 19 worse almost flu history flu lifetime can't helped. Everybody else could benefit lesson differences viruses especially flu since one common reoccurring threats.

You want to, this, serious flu outbreak bunch people saying well little flu coated 19. Maybe little flu, maybe bleed mouth nose ears eyes flu too. Cove 19 hand fairly stable genetically probably going get big swing types symptoms infects people like get flu months mutation even less.

That stability xovid 19 ultimately pretty big advantage humans vs I'm trying combat something difficult pin clue changes genetic makeup reliably. people died flu pneumonia COVID-19.

Covid causes pneumonia. 

So yes, people died Flu+COVID COVID. Truth uphill battle simply stopped testing test borders... Exactly agreed! one city full face mask.. Except states can't outright ban interstate travel unconstitutional. recommend individuals entering self-quarantine 14 days, there's way enforce without monitoring citizens want travel. States absolutely able ban travel worry legal ramifications pandemic goal right save lives, strictly staying within law, travel bans impossible. already sleep 20 hours day occasionally, actual worry right now. take plenty vitamin rarely leave apartment, chances getting covid low, I'm pretty sure I'm going choose mental health risk physical health sooner rather later. cause outside seems like flu governments. virus.

No matter governments say, virus still widespread economy going continue suffer, smart people going maintain physical distance. 

The way get back normalcy culture go all-in together smart public health. mean everyone stays inside, mean wear masks absolute minimum, temperature checks public places, efficient contact tracing... Things talking late February still resisted never got proper public health campaign, fact got opposite. know didn’t? 

Very drugs like come harms. drug still trial phase. don’t know. doctors don’t. one does. reopened schools 2/3 weeks ago.
Bars restaurants opened since may 18th. Probably bots spreading misinformation agree. said, think politicians trying prevent backlash larger lockdown. hope I'm wrong, feel inevitable there's going one. 

I feeling I'm going Venmoing hairdresser money guide video chat. Good point. Highest number new infected today lombardy: 1100. Thanks link! Yeah, lets pile parents lost child heartless fuck one Mods, reign bit in. post contributed high-quality information. Germany recently changed testing methods. stopped randomly testing Airports increased capacties Kindergardens Nursing Homes. means get go school without wearing mask Oh ok, works internet stranger diagnosing you? Cool beans worked though. need fully lock country stop first wave way late implementing measures cases started going again. sorry, higher standards listening people lie get attention.

They also seem ignoring lack compliance outside shutdowns. people complies would different story arguments fake doctors signing onto would whole lot merit.

But since people even take basic precautions like wearing masks traveling, extreme measure taken things get control run.

If people could handle without shut downs, would seeing numbers going alarming rates every time lockdown restriction lifted. don’t think allowing people leave home walk increase spread virus done responsibly, impact physical mental health. makes restricting excessive draconian.

Yeah, people NZ overwhelmingly support measures allowed flatten initial surge quickly minimize deaths. also allowed greater freedoms post-lockdown, makes short term sacrifice long term gain reason them.

Note I've made judgement whether country chooses lockdown not. *you have*, reason trying push particular narrative, I'm calling on. IFR probably landing around 0.25% total.

Literally higher proportion NYC's Lombardy's ENTIRE POPULATIONS already died virus. 

In words, even every many, woman, child virus (which ridiculous), many deaths IFR low say. 

So wrong. pointless, sub made mind reality bearing that. I'm marathon training right now....

But besides that, yes. I’m denying corona dangerous, also overweight/obese population developed countries. don’t understand people surprised death count; take super contagious disease fucks people co morbidities introduce population mindless sedentary XXL consumers don’t get enough sunlight that’s get. Oh boy. fly Florida catch covid then!  US military-quality drones? one paying attention this. Children catch \~6 colds year school. said may COVID-19 effect way. going school, may change... everyone pretend warning. Coronavirusuk pretty active. could post cautionary example happens health policy politicised. lockdown eye-catching, real work contact tracing. like tree; snip branch leaves fall together. Catching cases early ensures spread people. 

The lockdown also applied Wuhan parts Hubei. **one** city China (or one province 34). parts lockdowns. 

Initially skeptical Korea's strategy, turned really need lockdown (Also, I'm pretty sure partial lockdown Daegu), would great, rest world listen. wrong you? True. Things like Mayor Frey's relatively early mask mandate Minneapolis effect, unfortunately still plenty areas enough. much support Gov. Walz, wish hesitated long commit statewide mandate. find Mpls rarely see people without mask nowadays.

I dont think Minnesotans surprised northern MN seen lots cases; well borders ND Wisconsin hit hard course. mean Trump's rally Bemidji September 9th probably create massive spike. already 9 confirmed cases contact traced event, time tell. Maybe meant: immune common sense basic understanding exponential growth...  Minimal meaning wear fucking mask. Try going YouTube mention coronavirus comment section video. 6 guaranteed responses “mild flu” “face diaper” have... 2 confirmed cases reinfection worldwide.

Also incorrect. 22 confirmed cases reinfection world now. bar confirm reinfection high. needs stored sample first infection second infection. samples need sequenced viral genomes need sufficiently different. There's possibility person reinfected virus. However, there's way tell genomes different. Additionally, whole heck lot people samples stored (which see reinfections often health care workers whose samples likely stored internal testing). Aaaand we're back straw man.

 I'm sure expected people pretend doctors, internet. invalidate actual message. Whether 20K doctors signed actually 10K matter.  Yep. Surgeon General’s tweet Feb 29th advising people stop buying mask don’t work still makes ragey. serious, ""someone might take away **mah rights** make wear mask public places!!1!"" Pithy insults going change truth. Try another argument. I’m you, hope March/April could see restrictions start lift summer normal. Let’s hope everything goes well. son something covid-like November. tested negative flu. russian lost job twice year currently choice webcam defenestration, tell you: another lockdown fucking catastrophe would much worse someone's grandma dying. everyone software engineer, check privilege ""hopes"" another lockdown. I’m fan Sweden’s, anti mask policies damning fact didn’t strict lockdown like countries That’s entirely fair. family Christian church still meeting zoom meetings, despite regulations state lifted. keep members guests safe. However, close friend whose family religious don’t adhere social distancing (well least mother). don’t think it’s necessary God’s protection, yet forget God’s call protect others. misguided people ever section society, religious not, blame religion whole also misguided. Well wife sometimes tell get it. Masks social distancing end world. highest risk issues. Large family gathering grandma grandpa etc. normal person masks social distancing public. Wow hard. /s
Plus countries showing new normal doesnt last forever strict done right. lower number cases lots testing tracing help. least US invading privacy wave constitution. Nah man. thing still deadly causes lasting damage. take seriously health protect vulnerable community. basically spun control, number daily infections cannot efficient testing/tracing. basically spreading freely community. Instead taking simple measures enforcing them, watched increase. uncontrollable cannot possibly another lockdown. Germany next. know got sick? far nobody knows gave virus. Facebook antimaskers disinformation among pheasants stops them. whole family Europe stopped believing covid seen anyone dead close by. see some. change mind. like Arizona usa...  son sick dog November - fever 104.7, dry cough, chest pain, confusion. vague memories two days worst. Right fever resolved, came g.i.

US buys global supplies medicines &amp; vaccines, IFR change again.. Apparently could find enough doctors support leave fake ones boost numbers.

They lost credibility decided lie. doctors hospitals lot data fingertips average reddit user. able see trends data look across cases hospitals, usually times like hospitals share data compare. again, completely correct reviewing hundreds thousands cases say, pattern emerging.

Why know this? brother works statistical analyzer hospital group gives type data job. 

You're confusing random information read reddit reliable news source. Believe me, doctors consulting reddit information 🙄🙄🙄 Imagine foreign entity targeting old people drone strikes. Would feel way?

""Guys, fine. They're targeting old people. go back normal throw granny bunker. know many people die car accidents flu per year? Liberate America! ain't scared dang drone strikes!""

Going back normal would overload hospital system. Worrying trend, numbers becoming difficult grasp. know testing up, we’re fast approaching estimates first wave straight censorship dont like move. Apparently way many kids using website understand yet. MANY FAT COMORBIDITIES? Well... shit. study referring to? much better contact tracing testing April. need whatever told, matter insane damaging society. preservation life matters, costs. ends always justify means. unquestioning obedience diktats achieve salvation plague. maybe, politicians need take responsibility words.

maybe much better. Nice Big Pharma article completely ignoring real questions. questions inverse: like get back line forced employer take vaccine. article discuss untested nature vaccines vis vis “special needs” population discuss short duration limited amount testing general given WarpSpeed™ nature it? younger populations fatality rate per CdC exceeds 99.9% ethical demand vaccination WarpSpeed™ vaccine low risk people “protect” older people? Israel, dozens people show reinfection worse disease. even people didn’t clear infection completely aren’t reinfected, would vaccines cause worse adverse effects people disease previously didn’t know disease forced take vaccine anyway. thoroughly expect silenced, challenge herd mods think questions reply arguments rather delete this. explain steady increase positive test results(an exponential function) testing capacity increasing(a linear function) got CFS shingles. fucking sucks. you’re capable saying?

I hope position life 5 years read feel embarrassed. feel sorry you. Yes, viruses cause long-term damage rate. cause others.  context, Florida Governor DeSantis recently lifted limits crowd attendance games. Private schools likely continue limiting attendance, public schools like UF facing pressure open full capacity. Florida already handling virus poorly, even one full attendance game occurs could incalculable disaster state. Fauci. guy screwed HIV killing tens thousands screwed Covid-19, killing tens thousands more. Generally trust long-term bureaucrats touched patient 40 years health advice. suggest do. Americans committed certain political beliefs opinions change facts justify beliefs opinions, rather around way around crazy? 90k mostly college kids? may get sniffles. risk willing take???? /u/tb0x prove wear masks would prevented superspreading event much spread would prevented. could work home would consider getting corporate job again, otherwise much nothing traffic. like working 11 hours, getting paid 8 actually busy 4.

It makes lot sense I'm probably one get 8-hour day done 4 hours one wasting two hours day commuting. American sounds alarmingly familiar. federal government also twirled dicks, never hear speak that. That's really point, virus kill cause long term damage, that's nothing new, new suggestion long term effects occur crazy high frequency COVID. long post countered 'China it' NZ

And?

China also cross-border communications relevant Italy, Germany France do. think hard China keep borders Siberia, Laos Kyrgyzstan closed indefinitely. So, hell trust? studies suggest flu cases mild symptoms 50%-77% admit Fauci wrong risk ""miniscule"" wrong wearing masks, back dangerous hazardous claims make, likely costing thousands lives, health care hero.

Even COVID getting mixed somehow still lower death rate COVID didn’t even exist! would 135k country size US initial spring wave dominated density international travel populations, rate spread high (often doubling 2-4 days given place) days difference taking action made disproportionate difference flattening curve.

Things far diffuse now. I'm sure still missing rather obvious point made know coming going walk contact tracing ensuing process elimination. person went walk followed protocol got it, we'd know it. That's process elimination works. We're seeing COVID spreading following protocol outdoors. feel I'm wrong would like see proof it. countries closed borders 3? months first lockdown, possible.

And suffered immensely it, even manage reach zero cases anywhere. NZ seven months counting - probably gonna last 2021. possible EU could (and should) completely sealed borders outside world, closing internal borders cases reached zero two neighbouring members - Australia done.

Has it? AFAIK neither NSW Victoria point NZ's example less exactly (obviously island helps enormously) - absolutely uncompromising it.

Nope, also when.

Italy tougher longer lockdown NZ. literally banned people taking walks around block. half country pretty much unaffected virus begin with. Yet still manage reach zero, reopen borders point try save left economy. Solidarity friend. Almost identical experience here. Hope management inept toxic is.

The 6 feet wording meant outdoors Intelligent lockdown == herd immunity experiment?? mentioned herd immunity side effect, came back real quick. never goal I'm sorry. hope mend now. Jeez 2 months recovery. alone says regular 'flu'! I've met Dr. SaintKitts times. That’s still really base assumption. Keep mind differs based age health seriously older condition, take seriously.

Ok, whatever. ruled group physician-kings, politicians make decisions make *de facto* *de jure* political. response shows obstacle fruitful discussion kinds comments present, get flagged.

Hysterical student would get away bullshit. ""no major issues""

Well, Marlins thing March, lol!

Yes, next Spring, Fauci proven wrong again, post link, saying ""That October, lol!"". sky green would hard draw trees paintings. ""Told so"", basically health experts, ""second wave fall"" said advanced warning. I'm pretty sure blame prepared. Idk got from, case. hesitant blindly give money countries financial situation order past couple years without indication improving. demanded changes regard helping financially  wear masks! March, lol! avoid gathering? “Maybe I’m immune, don’t know.” Would CDC legally Constitutionally allowed enforce without act Congress?

If so, could one cite relevant statute? tells Congress U.S. could enough coronavirus vaccine doses every American April

Fauci also told Americans risk Covid-19 ""miniscule"" mocked wearing masks, saying ""skip masks"", forgive think Fauci clue. live Canada elected take part one studies. (I sent mine yet, needs mailed within 24 hours placing blood, want make sure I'll definitely able send day.) reason signed corona like symptoms back February, I'm curious horrible horrible flu caught Covid early. definitely see skewing results. everyone always blames bats. :) yea, remember too. bats man, crazy creatures. Imagine comment coming Sweden. grandma might die within next years she’s old lmao. Okay undercover chinese agent shows growth cases since beginning pandemic. idea case numbers previous months gives rough picture things going. Several countries Europe require mandatory quarantine test upon arrival, governments issued travel advices discourage traveling “red zones”, forms filled crossing borders order trace case positive came contact positive. seems already bit effort operate safety Barely sniffle oh lord.

Generally, wind sun, it’s still way better indoors, I’d hate statistical anomaly caught walking trough someone’s breath cloud wind sun handled it. Rarer, possible. Technically masks public outdoor spaces would better, it’s important get mask wearing indoors crowded outdoor places. also including issues compromise immune system minority. Factor age standard health % substantially smaller. Concrete facts deny FREEDUMB believe anything else contradicts it. It’s her. It’s choices furthering chain spread reaches someone either higher risk age bracket young high risk person (which millions of, one). I’m sure vulnerable university aren’t able isolate. It’s selfish.  Lots people 80s plenty life left sure, let's dismiss every older person ""they're gonna die anyway"".

E: sums sub lately. potentially life-saving health care ought distributed based need, based merit desert. He's wrong, mask usage near universal now, especially Europe. need know age demographic IFR number based make sense?

Why average population? According research, high JAMA assessed mean 60.3 (SD, 13.6) days onset first COVID-19 symptom; time evaluation, 18 (12.6%) completely free COVID-19–related symptom, 32% 1 2 symptoms 55% 3 more. None patients fever signs symptoms acute illness. Worsened quality life observed among 44.1% patients. Figure shows high proportion individuals still reported fatigue (53.1%), dyspnea (43.4%), joint pain, (27.3%) chest pain (21.7%).

I gather depends upon severe initial symptoms were, though. wear masks!! Well actually yes - prepared manage consequences. That's way this. like pillow person. well good job virus asbestos. point conclusively say covid doesn't, long term problems occur significant amounts, year, 2 years? nothing covid strange way, would sudden strange long term effects? millions people recovered, months later still nothing crazy going on, else could happen, seems chances suggesting ridiculously small worthwhile consider them. useful sense know virus control France none subtle measures taken working.

It pretty useless though. slight cold last week. decent testing available would gotten tested since take 10 days get result stayed home week. world hitting second wave? tracing always traced back indoor events case superspreader outdoor events locations contact tracing. 

Well, I'll repeat since ignoring say contract tracer. ask someone say grocery store put ""at store""? so, turn around use fact ""at store"" listed instead walk prove can't get walk?

As fort burden proof would you

No isn't, I'm one saying know something sure. Rather, I'm positing specific issue proof. without proving alternative hypothesis. forget, first second rule of

That thing still going pretty strong. Hahah okay. chronic inflammation never leads anything else. **All scientists news  Yes, garbage information posted here. subreddits might want it. widespread, anonymous, apparently led people saying random things online they'd never say real life they'd need back up, apparently led decline quality journalism decent people wish death others  Nordic countries Netherlands That's true. main reason talk family anymore. Rcovid19 allows research articles published. surprise Whats likely. person trying support cause think better name Dr. Fakename, person cause tried sabotage whole thing adding dumbest names list? IFR much higher elderly, Florida ending restrictions? Dr P Freely well known virologist. Inflammation long term negative effects.  France don’t lockdown places, hospitals collapse. People die benign disease, nobody able get ICU. car accidents? bad, single bed available. Work accident, same. continues forever.

But people dumb. live Paris, today manifestation gym’s owners want open gym. restaurant open, too. 
The government, tacking action day (masks useful, close bar restaurants...), opposite next (mask useful, close bar don’t serve food...) dilute message, showing position weakness.

The main problem presidential election 18 months, Macron starting campaign now. cannot start rejected french. Also people fall people pushing political agendas. Lord, covid punishment God intelligent, wrong think  Binge Fox 24 hours. Daily Mail. NYC hospitals collapse. I’d rather see anyone going virtual meeting era people learn things hard way apparently.  CIA psyop People afraid go hospital everywhere. Fuck that. that’s case I’ll find way move New Zealand. Go ahead give total deaths 3 States. Give adjusted population.

I'll wait. children pay care well everyone else whose care provided .gov thanks supportive words. unfortunately management team worst offenders improvement mask culture store next impossible. wish well! get mentally stronger hope. 💜 lying science denier enough?

Now making random offensive statements apparent reason?

Are like real life? handle disinhibition anonymity like adult? Heterogeneity. reckons vast numbers young people without comorbidities caught (in countries relatively small elderly populations). population, death rate low. However, vulnerable groups, deaths going come from, death rate much, much higher flu. People USED share cups water fountains. 
That's new normal is: sensible precautions.  Idiot. cases spike 2 weeks May 18th?  Well, people scared enough didn’t go hospital- stayed home died. That’s least partial collapse mind. Herd means anti bodies last long reinfections fringe case Well, want look last 7 days, Florida 632 Covid deaths NY’s 45. Also Florida 16,789 new cases NY’s 5,920. 

I could look back you’d like. isn’t excuse early response Covid states like NY NJ get upset kid failed pop quiz one failed open book quiz knew months advance? First ""We x cases need anything"". number cases increased, became ""We deaths need anything."" deaths started increasing ""The flu kills people every year need anything."" deaths exceeded flu deaths ""The deaths per capita US lower Europe need anything."" death per capita higher lot European countries, become ""Those people actually die COVID."" There's reasoning people want hear reality. Anyways, little rant that's somewhat related article. sport. Anything team says us right. Anything side says ridiculed mocked. Sounds like lockdown worked 11%  none posts offer options beyond isolation long term economic ruin.
None posts accepting covid endemic virus, building extra clinics, reschooling lungs specialists, building extra capacity breathing machines.

Its people suck (newsflash, new) try align 8 billion people obedience isolation (not gonna happen) What’s wrong giving risk demographic false sense security mortality? one leading groups calling hoax resistant masks. total complete shutdown beginning worked though?

Evidence points takes one person start wave again.

This part truth. also requires absolutely nothing response allowing get control.

With fewer new cases things like pooled testing become possible would allow daily mass testinof essential workers, health care workers, schools.

If infection rates high, pooled testing actually required tests actually testing everyone.

That would mean catching individual cases come form outside immediately addressing appropriately.

Hell, closing borders early enough enough avoid disaster places like Thailand allow mostly normal activity within kingdom (save fact tourists borders closed, everything else basically open normal.) Okay Vietnam, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan Thailand aimed elimination. heavily populated part world Italy. lengthy land borders. They've kept borders shut continued achieve elimination months pandemic. Vietnam Hong Kong small second waves, like NZ, managed crush elimination strategy. 

Outdoor recreational activity allowed Level 4, walking around block. Visiting beach, walking trail park leaving neighbourhood banned. Driving car banned except going supermarket. essential businesses allowed open supermarkets pharmacies one member household allowed go strongly encouraged week. takeaways allowed businesses, butchers, fruit veg shops forced close. 

NZ geographically isolated, that's irrelevant international air travel. wealthy country 28% population foreign born strong air links Asia, Australia, North America direct flights Qatar Dubai well, NZ thousands tourists visitors arriving every day pre-pandemic. Tourism International Students 2nd 3rd largest industries economy. NZ far connected Africa large sections Asia. like Samoa Tonga, tiny Pacific Island handful flights.

....you think means same? 
Italian here,LOTS people wear mask even mandatory outside know Bergamo specifically compares? high antibody rates. resurging probably assume herd immunity.  two different pandemic flues still us? Either bad luck bad hygiene. taxing systems Spain Italy definitely room improvement, tax absorbs taxes paid EU countries country lecture that.  not. everyone locked ever? Like can’t get immunity this, it’s gonna short term, do?  Yes, based serological surveys think 10% New York State 20% Chicago exposed, that’s 5-10x number positive test results. happened, would start take seriously then? I’m doubtful. disputing that, aware excess deaths metric. saying interesting point data worth keeping eye on, runs contrary happening last 8 months. trend continues needs examined closely. closed mind future based past flawed IMO. censored then? allow let individuals decide themselves? aren’t ones. Malaysia, Taiwan, China, Singapore.. name few.

The measures work people keep them. People choosing take responsibility. it’s like oh “West” failed rest world’s success must wrong continue let people die?

I don’t know it’s ego “West” gotta get shit together. mix-up COVID-19 results third party lab forced Florida's Department Health stop daily numbers report Saturday, according health Laboratory sent approximately 400,000 previously-recorded COVID-19 test results Department Health Friday night. Officials say ""massive"" amount data needed de-duplicated, prevented department's automatic reporting system processing epidemiologists currently working reconcile data, take day finish,"" FDOH said statement. Republicans nationalistic nationalists follow ""their leader"" time leader says jump say ""how high?""

So leader sociopath says. he'd stayed quiet they'd probably reacted properly politicized damn virus see lot issues solutions.
For someone ""suspecting"" intelligent things, clearly thought fact endemic.


What humanity going do? Live isolated supporting entire populace employed events sector welfare?

We can't fix it, might well take hit. thing is: Fauci never claimed what’s headline. 

Second: accept arguments illogical conclusion aligned attitudes, normalising behaviour led whole slew conspiracy theories also rise alt-right populists Trump presidency. 

I get it, don’t care. do. Something isn’t adding up. thinks 1/10 world caught virus, wouldnt death rate chilling (realistically) around like 0.3%? Ya, well, would've thought... smh  Better look 'ironic'. channel Alanis. Yeah still experiment kind herd immunity though?? set harsh measures closing schools, sports bars/restaurant. wanted stop spread..

I simply saying guy said much herd immunity experiment.
Remember making huge deal it? Well backfired.

There 'experiment'. Yup, don’t think Americans would begin give shit unless got that. .6, nobody going give rats ass. repeat thing **three times row** still get I'm attacking you. textbook definition dense. man.

Let cite textbook definition MW EXTREME dense ignorance

You willfully ignorant. providing valid rebuttals anything said, contending points made. There's explanation left behavior. There’s going great data points come northern hemisphere next several months, terms environmental conditions impact spread virus. First all, that's ""policy"" means.

Secondly, never said that. 'It dangerous believe face masks would change game comes 'Face masks complement things things safely place. start face masks think crowd buses shopping malls - that's definitely mistake.' 

From linked sources. censored? allowed posted individuals decide themselves? I'm American sad see politicised wearing mask became. reality there's timeline Americans banded together part protect other. Sad people would prioritise little bit comfort round face weeks lives hundreds thousands. That's fun **fantasy**. 
But heaven, hell, afterlife. one make Earth. I'm one claiming black white whilst evidence says otherwise.

There's one group normal life low risk covid - live areas locked hard eradicated disease. ones working economies working societies. given limited antibody longevity mutation rates, example everyone else eventually follow. inescapable. Ignoring cases make Covid go away. pretty good testing. I've tested twice free. spike cases restricted movement within 5km. mum lives would illegal visit. expensive fine. got new cases 725/day 12/day.  Florida killing hundred people day since august.

New york killed fewer 10 e time period.

Why advocating plan currently killing people? depends factors - broad especially high level community transmission IFR reasonable estimate overall impact population extrapolated spread - course depend hospital capacity medical treatment. seems fairly stable within range 1% hard hit western countries (Italy outlier here) like Spain, UK, US Northeast. course majority people older age demographics import, high diffuse spread throughout demographics infection rate young people big effect fatalities interacting older people.

In cases country like Singapore pirmarily big outbreak among young isolated migrant workers micro state several nursing home outbreaks IFR tell much potential epidemiology virus country, except effects specific demographic.

And country median age 19 affected differently. African countries done well curbing spread, others simply know young population impact may (relatively) low even spreads like flu.

But disease (without near 100% 0% fatality rate) IFR stable across populations demographics circumstances anyway, there's also that. variation example Spanish flu ranges 0.27% Copenhagen 2-3% estimated IFR western countries tens percent *population* fatality rate likes Iran countries. countries hospitals aren’t run profit? big man said sniffle. still kind articles. contact tracer.

Our evidence aerosol transmission pretty well-established. Official guidelines initially include airborne vector scientific community's need preponderance proof - even so- opportunistic politics. pretty much knew thing. 

The evidence reinfection, contrary, mostly anecdotal. pathogenesis SARS-COV-2 yet well-understood. behaves differently coronaviruses, particularly virulence R0 damage done disease. We've never lived anything like COVID-19, comparing dissimilar cousins always best scientific process.

I'm weighing either side debate. wait see happens often people. take time. Well, doesn’t help doubters gain confidence system stubborn mofo. option picking prescriptions.

At least U.S., false. get prescriptions delivered. Walgreens many places offer this. also tens thousands locations drive thru, bank teller style never physically face-to-face lying? go buildings unless life sustaining activity. Expecting die lack life sustaining nutrition medication absolutely asinine.

I expecting die. Choosing go store life sustaining activity. expecting curbside only. everything. it. hard. 

Unless that, effectively firing gun air. Unacceptable. America works extra hard, help make million day next couple weeks.

almost 80 cases per 100k people... excuse good ol' Trump come take it, pushing long? proof worldview

I mean, though. Thats circular... proof worldveiw exists already accept worldveiw valid. Thats essentially logic flat earthers use justify worldveiw.

Actually old ones get die flu. something feel bad about, people get old get die something. long average age go happen. going live good life much longer anyway.

Corona way worse make lots people normally many years left live die this, especially health system overloaded. numbers beginning pandemic incorrect. actually 5-15k day New York, probably like 50-100k people getting infected day.

I knew, fucking knew it. Eagerly waiting Jack Bauer infiltrate White House regain control. quarantine? quarantine. restrictions certain activities. know anyone caught H1N1 know 3 people died Covid-19.

I'm saying impossible, probably - CDC estimates [60 million ""we"" knew, US government knew enough check spread China November, told NATO it.

""I always want play down"" start April, Trump accusing China remember projection century ... What? makes sense I'm pretty good analogies. explain, please? 

If trying say CDC filled good people led bad actors, I'd say sure. change fact anything said.  Centers Disease Control Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield says controversial new process, calls hospitals send capacity utilization data HHS, made CDC Friday, CDC's website apparently updated suggest novel coronavirus may spread respiratory droplets, ""small particles,"" including aerosols. guidance pointed growing evidence small droplets could ""remain suspended air breathed others, travel distances beyond 6 radical change site's previous iteration, suggested biggest risks coronavirus transmission came respiratory droplets spread close contact (within six feet). Instead, reflected latest science suggesting coronavirus spread via smaller, aerosolized particles encountered direct contact infected Monday, change gone. federal official familiar matter told CNN, initial publication updated guidance CDC's website also says update ""Somebody hit button have,"" official said. new guidelines posted consistent every western democracy's standards things we've known start, course CDC posted truth go back change it. would politicized? Experts thrilled see original update. Many stressed months virus travel tiny particles float slowly air, larger droplets fall ground. That’s ventilating indoor spaces (to clear residual virus) wearing masks (to help block exhaled particles) as, more, important keeping six feet distance. 

A tweet physician CDC deleted Extraordinary see @CDCgov finally acknowledge scientists like @linseymarr @j_g_allen saying SARS-CoV2 mainly spreads via inhalation droplets &amp; Maybe superb CDC scientists finally un-muzzled? Centers Disease Control Prevention removed running tally number people tested coronavirus keep going? Look early queries taste/smell problems. That's common symptom uniquely COVID. funny part is, starving, were, best hope would rely others' kindness share food neither dies, and, necessary, raiding outside individuals together group, movies programmed people thinking Apcalypse Road less Mad Max. Remember movie Outbreak government willing firebomb city prevent virus spreading? Boy, writer completely wrong. nothing, downplay threat, sell stock. That’s reacted real life. Yes!!

Firstly, ""cite"", ""site"".

Secondly, I've decided come back take initial comment charitable manner possible, say perhaps completely misread me. said 100 day, we're close 1000, cases happening three places: Toronto, Peel, Ottawa. That's true, takes two minutes verify.

If interpreted words meaning claimed cases happening ""restaurants, gyms, cinemas, venues"" (which four places, incidentally, three) point. That's case, also claimed.

If however really arguing 100 cases day one point, close 1000 day now, mostly happening three regions, I'll definitely go back blocking troll unable figure simplest google searches. 

Either way fine me, random angry internet person. Holy shit what!? Investing similar rule. got banned 60 days replying post trumps tweet ending stimulus talks would affect market Didn’t vaccine? April 16, seen here: Okay, guys? point, I'm pretty sure they're trying kill us all. fact, coupled climate change denialism, I'm pretty sure they're alien lizard people trying colonize planet. obvious. even pushing Hydroxychloroquine taking it. Likely story. typical cycle

people see infections bad something. infections get people take less infections rise. wrong local government making call rather federal employees never state-county-city. experts draw upon. don’t care you’re custodian. even point? You’re inexperienced providing basic information. It’s drudge lapped whatever point you’re trying make. It’s disservice great effort whatever manipulation you’re attempting.  It’s based reading news releases vaccine makers listening politicians. never flu shot. almost never get sick, think year get one. I'm anti-vaxxer, trumper, anything like that. :D get link video? Nightclubs bars riskiest place right now, go remotely surprised get COVID I’m fan past. faith goal isn’t bring domineering Democrat agenda table. genuinely believe goal find way restore *balance*.

Just 2 cents seems difficult liberals understand lol That's stupid analogy. I'm asking vulnerable person is, I'm asking completely eliminate contact vulnerable non vulnerable practice Australia weakest flu season memory people prevent spread covid also thing recommended prevent spread influenza. Except actually works influenza. thing called burden proof. link provided clearly isnt biased starting preconceived conclusion... /s. 

Gtfouta here. Lag, better treatments, outbreaks among younger groups like e.g universities. Risk groups (hopefully) isolating high risk people elderly homes easier protect better testing tracing. possible reasons virtually nothing working opposite direction. definitely something going around November/December. got sick seemed bad cold Thanksgiving weekend. slowly got better couple weeks seemed relapse mid-December. Still felt horrible Christmas Eve. 

A trip doctor got low-grade antibiotics (maybe necessary, maybe not), steroid inhaler, rescue inhaler, prescription-grade cough suppressants. fully better mid-January. followed months allergies asthma, starting March flaring intermittently past week, may triggered sickness. let say unexpected, unusually severe asthma *awesome* Coronavirus spreading throughout world

I truly think COVID -- early, enough specific symptoms. likely bad cold moderate flu knocked entire system. I'm fairly healthy person 40s, could imagine really, really bad outcomes that. report buttons, seem remove much  really think everyone knows except President Trump. goal lockdown stop pandemic, nothing current arsenal can. goal lockdown 'flatten curve', meaning spread hospitalizations enough health care systems collapse. curve infected steep, many people sick time, hospitals can't handle. Bergamo people dying floor hospitals, doctors, nurses, ventilators, ICUs, beds, wheelchairs. Lol would anyone care *hospital security guard* thinks covid. It’s mall cop less education. reason even necessary studies like he's attempting defeat pandemic via Twitter.

I sympathize anyone understand COVID significantly worse flu. props front lawn juiced steroids tells American public ""really ain't thing"" face 215,000 dead Americans.

This study correct misinformation severity infection, comprehensive numbers outlook long-term health effects COVID.

There column woldmeter ""not-dead never live again"".

The percentage prolonged degenerative health effects incredibly 


# Long-term health effects coronavirus study performed long term effects severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), coronavirus emerged 2003  study showed persistent significant impairment exercise capacity health status survivors SARS 24 months.

1 - - are. cost maybe thousand years tax payments, anyone afford hospital bill. Yay economy, launch helicopters!  would probably better got 2mil. It’s shame way enlighten morons dumb realize stupid obviously wrong side history disrespecting sociopaths ignoring mask requirements. 

Don’t want wear mask? Stay public areas. 🖕😷🖕 8 billion people? many people think live US? that's Congress for, could like canada everyone gets 2k getting 2k. Nope. I'm close contact people, primarily essential workers. Short answers countries testing far more, 10x often. They're catching cases back then. really depends live, US? possible, places like Canada probably higher % population vaccinated  sameeee exact boat. I’m 27 younger, know survive spring without party. I’m going workout daily come lookin like Uncle Iroh no, looking post:  Trump politicized masks effort control dialogue create bogus debate.  wearing one become akin waving flag Trump.

The issue straightforward: Trump failed miserably continuing fail, across board, blood 200,000 Americans hands.

We focusing fiasco. Instead, deal halfwits refuse mask Piggly Wiggly. hope you’re right. I’m side, really. right, governments industries can’t handle another big lockdown, let alone continuing measures next summer. That’s USA either. Economics eventually win day.  Got it. top comment always vindictive politicized? never ""oh man sucks happening us?"" always need blame others virus, wanting live lives? Remindme! 6 months. virus spread essential workers, healthcare workers students.

We live world finite resources logistics obey laws physics. Door door tests every single person feasible. Testing large groups people end place time every day organized manner would catch people early would still spread parts population right?

That contact tracing for. mi imal cases, contact tracing gets much point pooled testing stops feasible back started.

Not start low basal infection rate, pooled testing, rigorous contact tracing, targeted shutdown things start get hot specific regions, counties, industries, etc.

Any response need multipronged address everything. Pretending pick stick one strategy detrimental understanding needs done. Seems pretty simple:

1. 65?
2. pre-existing respiratory issues?
3. morbidly obese?

If answered yes those, remain lockdown. answered three, carry life pandemic, avoid contact anyone answered yes. comparison first million took 3 months. Youre lazy idiot. link compilation RCTs observational studies. Get fucked, im done googling people like you. rapid systematic review efficacy face masks respirators coronaviruses respiratory transmissible viruses community, healthcare workers sick patients 200,000 dead. didn’t get live lives, didn’t get say goodbye family, choked fucking oxygen, lost limbs died top that, died alone. 1,000,000 die ppl see serious is? practical impossibility thing said Oxford vaccine, never so. Lagging death count. yeah big cities locked like 2 weeks ago (especially Paris likely 30% positive rate) 3% IFR based confirmed cases.


Actually though that's exactly difference. use confirmed cases number called CFR (case fatality rate). IFR always inferred number based non-confirmed number infections.  5 times number confirmed cases actually implausible. true factor estimated be[ 10-20  testing increases, assuming tests accurate, numbers converge, that's simply happening. well that's weird way looking it. chances getting one different. 

If offered 90% chance $1,000, could buy lotto ticket, would go for? Would say ""well, one, lotto ticket better, I'll get ticket""? Yes given situation (see article below), don’t seem priorities straight. Hospital bias. Worse cases much likely get tested mild cases. Yea, that’s also Infinity War timeline Ya win ya lose half. /s neither. pretty much one wearing mask supermarket.

Its people socialy distancing, washing hands, staying home symptoms, working home, still going neccesary. general urgency combat virus gone paying it. Wearing mask antidote. measures combined going flatten curve. study asymptomatic patients. sharing formula Indonesia least, Indonesia make batches. Florida report new cases deaths today. Sun Florida health officials announced Saturday forced delay release coronavirus report provides daily look numbers new infections, deaths percentages positive COVID-19 test official reason: laboratory Friday night dumped 400,000 test results previously submitted, mucking ability accurately process state’s much-watched pandemic data.


A 400,000 test muck-up?! Damn. logical conclusion covid adds almost full year life!

/s case anyone missed freely admit wrong delivery. still look like pharmacies offer drive thru services even schedule II, though. correct wrong that. Certainly standards, though, pharmacy offers within 100 miles live (so make back without stopping get gas), that, anything else would reckless. No, people like making fun of. Take deep breath, everything okay. fully expect Regeneron charge abhorrently high price tag treatment, per injection costs probably toward top drug market.

For majority people get it, it’s going expensive mAB chronic condition. American insurance system pretty much sentences people chronic conditions viable treatment biologic poverty. need drug costs $10,000 annually hit out-of-pocket max. acute infection treatment, cost patient treatment lower. cdc says 6 12 weeks everyone masking social distancing could virus mostly control, could use contact tracing.

It's impossible, issue leadership making happen. still remember 9 months ago, flu bro, memes Humans stupid. understand every single disaster movie million times better. really act self interest. 

you're blaming covid people think. thing NYC found 60% (reported Cuomo daily briefing mid-May) cases among people working/travelling/taking public transport, partying/eating impossible time, i.e., getting covid punishment wearing mask going living safe spaces talk virus aren’t full deniers? JFC. things bad then. Haha. Thank kindly. tired Weird Al tired life Pretty much everyone minus ONE MILLION people.  have, satisfactorily. 

The coronavirus deadly spreads faster flu. know this. thousands data points. giving single one probably wrong anyway change that. 

You going reason, data, science here. understand get believe want believe. supposed done. nice day. go whataboutism?

If 2 million Americans die/be dead covid, think would enough get Americans care? Simple fucking question. going happen. even NY would still higher deaths per capita.

FL averaging 600 deaths week NY 72 there's 12 weeks left year. stays way absolutely happen I'm sure additional 8,000+ happy hear ok, per capita NY deaths. perspective:  pretty good dentist! cannot believe many people completely oblivious concept risk management.

If right one wears masks, nothing happens. **Good**.

If wrong one wears masks, things get worse. **Bad**.

If right people wear masks, things improve. **Good**.

If wrong people wear masks, nothing happens. **Good**.

As see, one negative outcome risk table.

Why avoid negative possibility altogether since cost risk so? matter. already lost 3-10 years lives this: directly due time sink scraping due economic depression... ain't retiring, kiss idea goodbye.

And counting. make comfortable idea working 3 minimum wage jobs well 80s. yes, minimum wage, able start successful business climb corporate ladder, call ageism will, age, capabilities productivity drop like rock, truth qualified menial jobs.

So want MAYBE rescue semblance future, would fight tooth nail destruction future isn’t relevant topic. article head coach encouraging full attendance game NOW, 6 months ago bulk deaths occurred states. know NY NJ highest death rates per capita, though positive initial blitz (and certainly since May) Florida taken mantle. want explain death rates states never exploded like NY NJ early on? fact better treatments 6 months ago. stepdad hospitalized best course action gave pronate try hand HCQ. Treatments significantly better outcomes yet, despite this, Florida EASILY outstrips states death rate per capita past 3-4 months. happened NY NJ early case lacking preparedness poor decision making. What’s happening now, despite improved outcomes diagnosed virus FL case willful disregard.  There's way second lockdown European countries. population accept it. taking serious expensive. Ah worry, like UMC Amsterdam study organs get affected Covid cells found presence almost them. also study going extensive reaction immune system brain could cause brain damage. could also case organs I'm professional. read this:
 people States care paid Yea I've juggling decision whether unfollow sub seems 9/10 new helpful information, bullshit rile folks unfortunately can't read walk away. appreciate support though, hope family stay safe healthy this.  virtual negative consequences wearing mask, could negative consequences giving recommendations wear masks affects people interact. Time lock good month. big cities, yeah reopen year (and tbh never left lockdown 1 entirely, we're gonna need one wave) I’m sure 2021 better, anyways. I’d close state borders. already answered question, talking keeping open mind keep looking data going forward. don’t understand, sorry. tried best.

Btw lots secondary effects caused lockdowns past 8 months could also contributed excess deaths leave exercise reader. evidence reinfection, contrary, mostly anecdotal

It's anecdotal genome sequencing see reinfection happened 22 front line workers. Yes, number relatively small, covid around long, 100% confirmed reinfection cases, front line workers return work continue use ppe protections worth noting got sick twice - doubly many worse second time around. anecdote, healthcare workers confirmed reinfection. work around covid, especially infection runs risk worse second time around, something concerned about. also plenty anecdotal suspected reinfections, lab confirmed. 

You're right covid19 pretty unique, time trying ignore entire history similar viruses hope instead behaves like different family viruses wishful thinking far tell. gladly wrong, trust scares think may covid part lives good vaccine, I'm hedging bets 1 2 year immunity people depending level infection. Nothing stopping starting website.

The world owe free public relations platform. many, actually is. significant part problem many asymptomatic presymptomatic still spread it. Thank you. It’s depressing someone risk. get people want enjoy lives CANT them. nursing home data (country wide) - new new me, seeing cases deaths per state per capita eye opening. 

bear mind data week old. week 27th, presumably new update come early next week Recreational activities makes sound lot blasé actually was, rules strict. flatmate understandably stopped police given warning run together. Even though could prove lived together, adults exercise alone make sure people weren’t meeting friends walks. I'll sure higher hopes Trump office.

Yes! **must**! Biden issue national mask mandate, things get really bad, six-week national lockdown! Trump gets four years, screwed, due epidemiological incompetence, southern states feel motivated carry lackluster attitude towards pandemic. area people still dont give shit either Deaths situation like month ago. die third week

So 100 deaths u see 6k cases month ago 

100/6000= 1.6% 

So 20k cases give 300 deaths month Ask Governor Florida. link woman fired allegedly manipulating data website.  median age Florida low 40's?  thought kids didnt get/spread covid? Nothing stopping starting website.

The world owe free public relations platform. find total hospitalization numbers? find rates. average age person dies covid average age person alive today

I mean course average IFR number cases cases US get true number US though might higher Japan people older average (might true, arguments sake)  experiencing relatively rare phenomenon Reddit known free exchange ideas. relative size age sub, lifecycle period allowing perspectives instead systemically pruned opinions form echo chambers Reddit. Christie mainly good like Murphy is, curve.

When last 4 governors train wrecks, either stealing pensions (Corzine, Florio), gambling pensions away recklessly letting streets fall apart (Whitman), making completely unexperienced lover affair head homeland security right massive terror attack right backyard (McGreevey), fat guy closed bridge park, doofy old guy underestimated snow storm ground traffic halt, seems like pretty good deal. Whataboutism work here.

So saying whataboutism? problem type censorship draw line acceptable unacceptable? Theres hard fast rule, there's committee review every last word implication dynamic situation/world. figure committee and/or algorithm, basis rules function supposed updated? often? reason best touch freedom speech risk gradually strangling time. I'm saying something done misinformation, believe censorship correct long-term answer. Spain Italy need Dutch money they'd set working taxing system instead making tax avoidance national speciality. I’ve beach, casino, gun show, name it. make sure follow distancing, mask protocol, hand washing. 

But point it’s tonnn people absolute bare minimum live major city. 

I've turned around corner around building lot times basically run right someone without mask. fatalities car crashes year COVID, 20 years olds. put perspective. anybody seen Rudy since hacked lung FOX last Monday? lockdowns delayed inevitable.

That's fair point 6 month delay brought lot. Doctor time gather experience, without cure least know harm good. first wave march like *let's try first idea get, publish result* ideas good bad, that's normal new disease. time government could source gear, including FFP2 masks ventilator. Remember people 3D printing part transform scuba-diving mask breathing aid, everybody discussing DIY ventilators ? 

The full question whether improvements + reduced R sufficient avoid second lockdown whether we'll get over-crowded ICU need close everything 3 month. stated, clearly pointed wrong you’re resorting crying grammar Reddit. Pretty much sums whole argument wouldn’t say. Yes imply things stay way forever hilariously touch reality. inoculation, masks going fire can’t stop anyone else also wants to. like censoring *opinion* censoring *misinformation*. course supposed ""censor"" fake news kills ppl. 

Free speech guaranteed Reddit guaranteed federal government. Nobody carting away lied covid. want information backed reliable science covid information sub. brainer Np, 8k new cases Czechia today...""can't wait"" tmr! I'd like add likely less significantly US actually something rather burying head sand it.

Curious opinion, since Fauci buried head sand time. There's definitely people get pretty bad case statistically speaking mild cases common people. that's simply possible, Tsipursky said. losses recent months permanent.

The sentence right clarifies meant. wait cross people street put mask on, may already contaminated hands, contaminate mask.

true, help person get you. know, see lacking support company's accounting business development data, real time.
Thank you, everyone, fucking economy more. Nothing violates constitution. Federal law clear whose responsibility respond pandemic. Like percentage? Shut new normal crap, people go back normal within year now, vaccine not. way stop us use deadly force. Try it, dictator. work public daily basis? us do. good evidence wearing mask outside makes difference, either. That's see France imposing stricter mask wearing policies effect whatsoever. 

There's lots studies showing mask wearing helps. opposite White House says fine. 7.5 million best estimate total infections? jive statement 10% world? US similar, wouldn’t like 32MM people infected?

Note: got confirmation confirmed cases. many times people mess math badly? Confirmed &lt; Total. math nonsense downvoted. Disney crowded.

Not like, summer vacation crowds, holiday weekend crowds somewhere close average daily crowds.


They give clear numbers capacity they're open to, people noticed wait times rides going back normal, seeing increased attendance people Facebook say another flu? know believe!  two opposing political parties trying use virus leverage political support 

Also people dumb little snowflakes can’t put mask 15 minutes grocery shop. It’s mentality enabled alt-right conspiracy theories Trump himself: rejection facts logic acceptance argument, even illogical ones, long conclusion aligns attitude. I'm envious many reasons. Hope keeping safe taking seriously many England :/ letting side usual tbh yeah exactly societies epidemics. legal frameworks evolved centuries, everywhere.

The Centers Disease Control Prevention drafted sweeping order last month requiring passengers employees wear masks forms public commercial transportation United States, blocked White House, according two federal health officials.
The order would toughest federal mandate date aimed curbing spread coronavirus, continues infect 40,000 Americans day. officials said drafted agency’s “quarantine powers” support secretary health human services, Alex M. Azar II, White House Coronavirus Task Force, led Vice President Mike Pence, declined even discuss it.
The two officials, spoke condition anonymity authorized comment, said order would required face coverings airplanes, trains, buses subways, transit hubs airports, train stations bus depots.
A task force official said decision require masks left states localities. administration requires task force sign coronavirus-related policies.


“The approach task force taken mask mandate is, response New York City different Montana, Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said official asked identified permission discuss matter. “Local state authorities need determine best approach responsive effort depending coronavirus impacting area.”



Most public health officials believe wearing masks one effective ways protect spread virus, particularly crowded, poorly ventilated public places attract people over, like transportation venues. Many feel Trump administration turned wearing — wearing — masks political expression, seen dramatically Monday evening President Trump whipped surgical mask White House door returning hospital treated Covid-19.


“I think masks powerful weapon confront Covid need embrace masks set example other,” Dr. Robert R. Redfield, C.D.C. director, oversaw drafting order, said recent interview.
Dr. Redfield publicly odds President Trump promoting mask wearing along social distancing, warning vaccine virus won’t widely available next year.
The thwarting mask rule latest number C.D.C. actions stalled changed White House. Late last month, coronavirus task force overruled C.D.C. director’s order keep cruise ships docked mid-February. plan opposed tourism industry Florida, important swing state presidential election. Political appointees White House Department Health Human Services also involved rewriting agency’s guidelines reopening schools testing virus, bypassing agency’s scientists.

Some members White House Task Force support mask mandate. others not, among Dr. Scott W. Atlas, radiologist become Mr. Trump’s closest adviser coronavirus, Mr. Pence, runs panel sets agenda 



Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat Oregon chairman House committee transportation infrastructure, criticized Mr. Trump ignoring public health experts administration mask issue.
“It’s especially outrageous science clear: masks save lives,” Mr. DeFazio said. “The millions Americans work use transportation systems every day — bus drivers, train conductors flight attendants, frontline workers rely public transit — deserve know president relying experts’ best advice everything possible keep safe.”
The transportation trades department A.F.L.-C.I.O., represents 33 unions describes “millions” transportation workers, said administration last week rejected July petition require passengers wear masks public transportation.
Larry Willis, president department, said members endangered patchwork rules regarding face coverings airplanes, trains buses around country, well airports, train stations bus depots.
“Some airports require masks walk door,” Mr. Willis said. “Some places masks become politicized, right mandates place.”
“I think creates uncertain level health safety workers passengers,” said. “This global pandemic, national emergency. national standard.”

Sara Nelson, international president Association Flight Attendants, said airlines technically require passengers wear face coverings, enforcement difficult.
“If requirement regulation law, there’s typically consequence following regulation law,” Ms. Nelson said. “So gives us backing often serves deterrent bad behavior.”

See subscription options honestly believe we’re going see really bad 2nd wave covid winter. vaccine won’t really widespread next spring. there’s going flux period ups downs, finally begins really fade away. can’t imagine normal life next summer. Packed arenas, stadiums, concert venues... don’t see next summer. Letting people go back bars, movie theaters etc full capacity... iffy. Masks definitely still required nearly everywhere.

I don’t mean Debbie Downer, hate shit don’t want way. really don’t optimistic outlook. social distancing option know cope except deny deny deny Seems like COVID lot ""worse"" despite lower death rate, huh?

Personally I'd much rather get covid19 ebola mers.  think time take break reddit bud. Enjoy fresh air. What!? You’re crazy. That’s crazy thing say. 

Anyhoo, I’m big indoor rally support Candidate Superspreader. Well know upsetting feewings.

""It"" reality. Definitely contributing reason. excuse. Germany increase 10% last 7 days. 4.600 new cases today  suprised. [72 percent French citizens would favor new nationwide lockdown period least 15 days bid contain surge coronavirus picking information generalizing entire continent.

Kinda like sub cherry picking information generalizing entire country 50 states. Plug favorite doctor name: [Dr. Doctor Willard Named doctor delivered him, Dr. Samuel Willard. Jonathan Bananas one intelligent men ever met. went Medical school together 1984 1988 graduated. 

A truly brilliant physician. Lets say contract tracer. ask someone been. 

They say grocery store walk. 

Wouldn't put ""at store""?  so, turn around use fact ""at store"" listed instead walk prove can't get walk?


The fact need get infectious dose. likely pretty low COVID, cumulative, one moment. Gets puffs people passing outside may able get infectious dose you. Yeah rest Europe bigger outbreaks. look France example... everywhere dude. Look worldometers tracker see spikes place, including total global numbers.

If people could comply rules better including masks, traveling, cutting unnecessary luxuries like eating out, gyms, etc, would keep resorting targeted shutdowns save healthcare systems.

In begining total complete shut would worked everyone complied fully, rigours test check systems implimented. Hell, got infections low enough could using pooled testing test every single student every school every day.

Now prevalent would take long starve virus lead squandered idiots. mean targeted local lockdowns still place response covid. CFR. always knew mild cases detected IFR would lower. Worst case scenario 3% everyone detected ever one disease varied individual response never considered likely. Explained last sentence article: “The CDC figures necessarily reflect cases reported individual states.” U say  That's great considerable portion population support additional lockdowns making unenforceable. want make point one else made thread. said, face data efficacy, equivalent ""technically correct, best kind correct."" people mad even technically prove it, reality stands mask prevent spread, anything could misconstrued suggesting opposite rightly useless harmful people take mantle. rambling thread redditors proved world fucked stuff, actually kind twat. \*shrug\* can't expect popular guy room telling people things want hear. ask Fauci. Sure, create totalitarian state removing don’t like. true. partner get tested September one colleagues get tested positive. first got tested center Paris supposed receive results 48 hours. several days, still get results started getting worried. went suburbs get tested again, thinking would fewer people. got second test results suburbs 3 days original test results Paris came 16 days!!!

We able self quarantine home whole time got negative results, bet lot people able that. Fuck, that’s bad. cases =/= positive tests 
who knows many old viral RNA fragments measured false positives? 
There going disaster*. yes people going die. 
I afraid another public health disaster due missed care patients, like already first wave. 
Also, people knew case sometimes count covid...like literally granny who's institutionalized since 16 months died heart failure counted covid death 2 people nursing home infected time (not even PCR test done heart). Also get see family (as things could gotten worse time, hindsight 2020). 
*unless make one bad public health politics Still override constitution. preparing pandemic. violating rights states vs federal government Nine months later, Manaus:

“There sound machines working, men digging, families crying. relentless.”

“I’ve digging graves 16 years I’ve never witnessed anything like it,” says Mr Xavier, helped bury upwards 100 people single day peak crisis. “I still can’t stop dreaming – well, like nightmares.”

""estimate infection rate like 20 per cent""
""cases ticking slowly  None us dumb us. would 2M deaths US everyone got it. would encourage feel like downvoting instead provide evidence contrary

I'm downvoting saying something certainty actually know. There's enough public support another lockdown. close every business people start gathering private help. Blast past ? wonder doctor would say 213,000 death USA alone Heard mentality! estimate way way back- realized many people asymptomatic. Since February I’ve seeing .75-1.5 estimates (depending age population). think huge advances treatment bringing .6.

But again, remember .6 healthcare. areas healthcare collapses (Italy NYC) number skyrockets. Yea one protesting street storming state capitals demand do, definition neccasary always realistic. Sometimes neccasary means minimum. Also science rarely ever say ""proves"" unless ironclad evidence strongly linking two things together; article fauci say proves. Sure know masks work terms logic never say ""proves"" makes seem like masks 100% reason kinds events possibility variables significant difference actually know think know. I'm sure feel like place explain anybody grasp tenuous best. Honestly get covered *more*.

Oh yeah forgot normal spring according sub downvote away Well mean thats pretty obvious lol. people could handle without shut downs, would seeing numbers going alarming rates every time lockdown restriction lifted.

This fair point. India lifted restrictions numbers went up. Japan lifted numbers went up. end month Florida probably ICU beds available daily case numbers back 10K Waka waka live middle dense city. many joggers (and bikers) running past I'm walk.

Nope, everyone Reddit agrees europe bigger shitshow States right now.

CT scans detect advanced COVID already causing pneumonia.

That's like 20% cases. great diagnostic tool, misses 80% positives! Gotta cut shit man. good you.

I've working home since March, confirmed yesterday I'm moving permanently wfh. log 8am moment 4pm hits, laptop closes put away. touch till next day.

Don't blur lines work home. Put away, spend time enjoying life outside work. oh CDC blocked White House?? Aren’t independent organization supporting research, education guidance navigate pandemic? need job regardless political group might want. That’s science first amendment right, RIGHT?! Give us truth!! wear outdoors Singapore. city state plenty people around even outside. Common sense prevails hiking alone rainforest. days mask stays down. also allowed strenuous exercise mask free. Americans still thinks covid like flu. least American political elites still far behind ten days Ottawa. were.

I'm seeing lost wage assistance gives $300 per week got least $100 unemployment. says pay retroactively week ending August 1.

My question this: long last? Aug 1 first week paid lost wage assistance, last week paid lost wage assistance? 
""The right picked try tell rest world restrictions economic impact."" 

This right exactly misunderstandings im talking about. never told countries do. Sweden unique country highest taxes world, best elderly care world extreme amount trust people people government. fact Sweden might able get without police locking people doesnt mean rightwing capitalist coutry like example US without restrictions.

When say that?  Dharavi, population 1 million probably densely packed human settlement Earth, largely contained coronavirus. Thanks aggressive response local officials active participation residents, slum gone looked like out-of-control outbreak April May late-September average 1.3 cases per day every 100,000. importantly, get vaccine lowers chance severe. like POSOTUS/WH WANTS ppl get sick die. he/GOP win elections... Bezos puts hand OSHa guys shoulder:
Do feel charge? symptoms? Seat belts perfect example. federal law regarding wearing seat belts. laws passed (and enforced) state local levels. old Oceano used work used say....... ""there lessons learned lessons relearned"" reference reports used write wrapping naval exercises. years amazed reports always hit deficiencies over. Changing human behavior (especially large groups) bigger challenge might believe. Big crash commercial/office real estate coming...

Also, businesses supported commuters, like coffee shops, lunch restaurants, takeout places, happy-hour bars.

Not saying working home bad, everything consequences. good.  Exactly. know skeptical. Skeptical many scenarios unfolded months. thought baseball season dead water first week example. success stories there, like said, “should studied emulated.” Doug Ford get away strict lockdowns he's Conservative

what?

the dude pro business gets. government zero fucking plan. sheer fact waited friday call emergency meeting goes show fucking inept are. call Florida's friendliest home town know rich would wriggle it. rest us would locked down, would please. Apparently moment Kids go Kindergarten start getting Rick way often. Damn.

Germany losing control covid. good, I'm worried. Austria already surge. Yeah, I’m PA, got one light snow December think. believe Covid second week March. sat yard nice out, thought vitamin might help. think blanket lap, definitely didn’t need coat. attempting herd immunity saturate every hospital world. Statistics helpful. 210K dead anecdote survivors. also uses Facebook groups like ""cerco affitto camere Padova"". Prices ranges 200 400, one cheapest university city Italy! Hey, look! plane? Wait...wait...wait...oh no, went right head :P nice Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri Wisconsin Montana, New Mexico Oklahoma West graphic: [19 states posts record high number cases far No, tens thousands people worked years fix things. estimates hundreds billions spent.

Sure, media overblew things bit (airplanes fall sky?) large part reason nothing happened concerted effort lot people. Bravo. Sadly Covid already 100 times deadlier 9/11 don't? Must nice. know least 11 positive week. tack adults know numbers go 21 week.

Gosh, jolly, week including since march schools closed down. know, kids actually online learning attended virtual class like... Huh .. never missed school.

Sorry area online school teach instead letting kids nothing. maybe school system something parents holding kids accountable. Please real situation instead trying blame adults making adult decisions never make situation handle properly. 

Source: teacher high school student. History judge, crime humanity. Lol always sentence like people bots.

If people get virus need go hospital/won't die/are recovered without symptoms that, lockdown again. North Americans, would rather canada separate Americas. covid-related incidents racism towards asians canada States, per capita wise: Sorry came rude. I'm stressing situation country right (Czech Republic).

We saw 8816 cases yesterday, ~20k tests, we're country 10 million people. get hit ""Italy March"" type lockdown :( Lock. Down. separate children since risk. true data hospitalizations soaring states also seeing COVID running amok fucking kidding right? entire summer Florida near top new infections country. ALREADY exploded. Voter suppression, republicans like people vote. That’s also reason many don’t believe global warming. Combing belief earth youn strong belief basically *deus ex machina* rescued gets bad. what’s point trying stop humanity exterminating itself? assume easiest way would hold back federal funding states institute mask policy. Keep politics public safety. Full goddamn stop. low effort comments dumb. Read article try understand it. Doctors saying otherwise; hence news article, post. I'd surprised kicked out. opinion something needs heard military racist opinion punishable. NZ beaten international arrival infection via lockdown

They lockdown. level 3 part country, level 2 rest. whole country, parts. NZ special case currently locked attempt defeat infection also born international arrivals

Is Victoria north UK

Not open without first eradicating disease

Not realistic authorities country trying do. Everyone attempting keep control vaccine arrives. means local measures waves, countrywide lockdowns like locked thing actually works

Wrong. Plenty cities countries seen drop infection rates specific measures close clue admit ignorant reality apologise. I'm guessing ignorant reality downvoting mates want ideological bias truth.

You grasp reality. locked panicky subreddit. Yeah, totally agree. Communism idea awesome. practice though, human nature fundamentally undermines communist systems. 

I also think communism stifles innovation. unmitigated growth (companies exist continue grow) untenable.

So think sort democratic socialism, modified heavily regulated capitalism (i know that) could really ideal form government economic system. need create utopia giving everyone truly equal educational economic opportunities. value education number 1 goal. Education key future. depends, it’s ultimately states-rights issues many things. things remove political interference CDC recommendations findings, would enormous. could put mask mandate mass transit interstate capacity, lot it. put pressure governors institute mask mandate, kind like pressure trump put governors put mask mandate. Ultimately, ton good letting medical professionals professional, several huge steps Whatever time polls close Hawaii? /s

When story came out, read lot emphatic statements tune of, ""Our candidate that!"" ""Even that, he's better Trump."" Dismissing claims sexual abuse harassment ""our guy"" big part behavior continues persist, sides aisle. 

I appreciate detailed story. feel better voting guy now. CDC hero, it’s boss villain. get abused white males time jealous don’t make much money. sounds simplistic it’s reoccurring theme 15 years paramedic. think it’s telling raised, perhaps lack strong role models parents, especially females. 

Nurses thing holding society together right now. criticizes countries he’s stubborn. played virus badly beginning cost quite lives. seems like speaking press promoting telling countries done wrong. right picked try tell rest world restrictions economic impact. None true obviously. still day he’s speaking Boris Johnson advising UK. It’s absurd. Arizona is. Hopefully get bad second wave. choosing jot mitigate risk, trying encourage unsafe advice apply majority.

What irresponsible. Plain simple. Sounds like problem. read, “the White House purposefully blocks CDC requiring masks public transportation endanger low income people rely service.” rude but....you power internet side. excuse. resources upon resources every elected official, besides local ones. Take time research. Would give fuck already. 

The article posted literally nothing statements. I’m sure read headline thought something. 

It’s amazing see post daily threads automatically know it’s one three people trite bullshit y’all post every day. got H1N1, everybody family too. Nobody hospitalized though. Lol meant say are, ended funnier is. They

As russia, stories doctors *misteriously* falling windows complaining misreport numbers. Yeah feels like might misunderstand eachother.

You wrote Tegnell used tool ny right.

I agree find strange Sweden probably left democratic country world probably left response pandemic.

My argument reason used tool right obviously misunderstandings.

But feels like blame it. think said made become tool right internationally? feel pressure forehead? probably help experienced first workplace groping right Anita Hill hearings. Everything I’ve heard says except small portion population bad immune system.

For worth, anecdotally sister knows 5 people confirmed cases covid NYC one detectable antibodies 6 months later.  people normal levels health.

That said, antibodies whole story immunity, small percentage people. Fauci said even vaccines likely limited year effectiveness need booster, designed illicit immune response. also evidence covid19 tricks immune system people long term, immune system actually tricked helping virus instead fighting it, making reinfection dangerous first infection. Coronavirus immunity lasting long unusual original sars one longer lasting immunities still many studies showed half people appreciable immunity 1 year point. nothing suggest covid immunity long term, already cases reinfections despite less year pandemic, basically coronaviruses immunity lasting less year. covid19 longer immunity would actually make even unusual virus. 

Can 100% say covid19 short lived immunity everyone? No, enough cases reinfection short lived immunity otherwise healthy individuals (look indian front line workers) along coronavirus information makes extraordinarily unlikely. Give virus months data long term immunity. Moderna already got millions vaccine ready ship. confident get approved Fauci et al spent money create even though fully tested approved obtained patent licensing rights. guess know approved since Fauci's blessing want able sell immediately.  got downvoted treated like moron multiple times saying suspected covid immunity would likely short term

This still entirely air though. B cell immunity counts, antibody liters declining means effectively nothing. Teachers absolutely forced use sick leave! government provided funds schools cover employees 2 weeks time regular pay quarantining. Teachers need talk admin ASAP fight they're getting it. cost school extra, see they'd resist it. Please educate difference case fatality rate infection fatality rate saying someone organization wrong. HIV 100x complicated coronavirus. studied tuberculosis HIV co-infections grad thesis.

That said, we've turned HIV death sentence treatable disease leading somewhat normal life infected dozens drugs switch virus mutates defeats one drug another. post removed because:

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus).* this? April? That's true. weird people act like two potential outcomes, death total recovery. two extremes--there's whole range possible outcomes lie in-between, including permanent damage heart, lungs, etc. ""they worked"" sorry that's verifiable fact dude. Evidence says helped, common sense would say helped, still debate. Meanwhile got people like you. people starving, abusing families, falling horrible poverty they're killing themselves, along child marriages, enough reasons lift sick people reason lock society. Stop pretending care people, don't. care forcing agenda Trump Christie week illness. second week critical. know neighborhoods tend stay place without virus. ""baseball joke""

wtf mean? They're finish season major issues CZ here. Yesterday weve 30% positivity 8600 cases means 80 daily cases per 100k people.

Even politicians admit Israel style lockdown much possible. see basicaly certain. 

And stuck goddamn working whole saturday sunday evening/nights home office able go pub enjoy last evening probably last warhamemr game next month homejail asses. 

FML  literally got downvoted sharing experience someone it. completely remove context conversation, go ahead tell everyone died shark attacks absolutely nothing. original, ad free, article seeing that...? heard anyone asymptomatic lung damage.  Good news! quite worried preexisting conditions. I'm glad see come around bit get released. hope makes take virus seriously. Sounds like gross negligence me. unavailable FDA. classic Trump rope dope. put FDA people “cure”. preparation vaccine claim thing FDA blocking citizens. Yes, proves point. March 17 recommended people could work home Stockholm region. doesn’t burn out. atually read letter. infering snarky ""we'll see"" comment, going come back like ""see, wrong.""

I'm absolutely wrong I'm saying *there strong possibility immunity lasts year.* absolutely true, strong possibility. 

I say true there's *no lasting immunity.* I'm saying people ABSOLUTELY SURE always *super rare* information. 

People sure know everything virus grasp onto every piece information add case whatever want believe. Anyone like ""hey still know shit could really bad still"" downvoted several different brigades people desperate go ""back normal."" enough humility virus want grasp onto literally anything make feel better instead growing living uncertainty. mean survival rate, *even* obese old people, overwhelmingly positive. Looking raw numbers, without perspective, useless

Edit: know what, useless bad word sounds insensitive. 210k thousand people families, yes devastating. focusing solely loss nothing else even *more* devastating. can’t lose sight means alive effort save lives Whhhhhyyyyyyyyy?!?! why? I'd like add likely less significantly US actually something rather burying head sand it. similar response HIV we're seeing COVID would millions deaths here. COVID could similar impact response botched badly. Actually true.. I'm talking enough start national vaccine program. Meaning anyone get it. High risk goes first.

No say ONE WOULD VACCINATED SPRING 2021.

At 50 mil month 350 million people 17.5 months.

Capice? Cant vaccinate anyone would like vaccinated enough supplies. First would high risk general public. Tengell co didn’t take seriously back testing capability low. also didn’t isolate asymptomatic people Tegnell didn’t believe spread virus. take things seriously. Tegnell doesn’t believe masks widely used. change mind too. Hopefully many deaths. guys getting closer strategy Asia since beginning. get little slowly. cancel get normal brain! Probably helps people going Disney also. seem like enough money throw problem kick people following rules protect people. good news. rest country needs ability enforce safety measures. People test positive, “asymptomatic” meaning don’t present normal symptoms. Coughing, fever, malaise, etc etc. People might even know sick. seeing lung damage people. that's takes. think part unclear people last round good distance, masking, avoiding large crowds, etc would stem need lockdown. Hopefully people grasp time. charts  older [NY Times puts March start numbers low April. regular day Reddit full disinformation agents.

During historic presidential election middle pandemic... Let's say there's reason bothered Reddit lately. 

So many brand new accounts shady accounts. Right??? guess technically babies replaceable, always another one, miss party? Lmao I'll sure let died AIDS know ""absolutely nothing""... I'm not, run company. currently make money Korean Chinese customers. one Europe currently dares spend big money high-tech stuff pays two three years right now.

Lockdown decent control way this. tho China, nothing like Flu. comes USA, is. wonder why? I'm much board social distancing preserve healthcare resources. everyone acts surprised virus peaks community community everyone idiot everyone everything right could've prevented anyone getting it. virus viruses do. believe promoted Surgeon General United States  understand actually lying countries stated utilize social distancing measures well masks.

No not, use masks like say. go Tokyo right even enter bars tiniest buildings social distancing impossible. people still go office, people still go work, people still meet others. family Japan way, close contact well wife Japanese I'm currently stuck deny masks work Dutch NL. They've made stances certain types face coverings work actual masks work.

This ""Dutch Fauci"" Van Dissel states ""gewone mondkapjes hebben weinig effect"" translated English says ""normal facemasks limited effect/not much effect"". Something disproven Asia many times, simple 3 layer facemasks buy pretty much everywhere limit infections 80% parties wear mask. Something example Japanese do. walk streets there, facemasks worn pretty much everyone. Tokyo area 30 million people amount infected people around hundred day mortality shown steep rise. 700k sound like nothing me. think US numbers. Globally much significant. 

From 1 million people die HIV/AIDS year; countries leading cause death. HIV/AIDS one world's fatal infectious diseases – particularly across Sub-Saharan Africa, disease massive impact health outcomes life expectancy recent decades. A) That's Fuckin terrible disgusting
B) WTF COVID-19 perverts marrying children? Death always worst outcome See y'all Spring good news going back 383,359 new cases day. mods need ban redundant posts Spongebob? Look charts.

Look case counts, hospitalizations, etc.


Then look date imposed masks mandate.

There zero correlation. Masks shit.


When US South hit outbreak places imposed masks mandates (See Texas) early. late (Alabama) impose actually banned local governments (Georgia).

Their epidemic curves nearly identical. Dr. Joey Jo Jo Junior Shabadoo. hospitals area ever got overwhelmed thankfully. Also hospitalizations way since July. I'm worried infection rates. People going catch it. scared vulnerable need protect yourself. Everyone gauge risk tolerance. took lot precautions back March, take less still little things like wear mask around crowd. common thus far? symptoms, long term negative effects either. long term negative effects, symptoms. would want team highly qualified experts country making decisions national emergency?

I know you, expect small town Kansas level pandemic knowledge experience CDC. many experts idea talking about. 

Test, trace, isolate applied nationally Sweden already February. peak spring wave abandoned hard hit areas though, way keep up. Regions lesser hit continued. cases dropped summer test capacity expanded, test, trace isolate reintroduced regions abandon peak. part strategy. legitimately relieved recovered this, predicted unlikely recover. single person deserves die, suffer result virus. said, fuck guy. I'm going run today.

You too. also pre social also never name brand recognition Pfizer has.

So? Pfizer paid $60 million bribery scheme. ask? fatal drug trial.  looking dangerous.

yes, lets take one case use generalize entire pandemic shall we?  Social distancing way important, we're properly. need bit Realpolitik. can't limit contacts enough social distancing, masks auxiliary measure limit risk severity infection. numbers game. People act like there's set perfect rules eradicate it, might well nothing. That's stupid.

 need perfect beat thing. need nothing. focus effort promoting social distancing, properly, can't say 'welp, tried, guess herd immunity now'. Every little bit helps. Masks, taking bike instead bus sometimes, meeting friends outdoors twice month instead pub every week, driving car holiday instead flying... things could limit high risk contacts. Sadly, like said, many people try ignore pandemic. Nah, fooling me. *not* good argument lifting lockdowns. Yes, child marriages big problem, COVID-19 even bigger. logically, fix COVID-19 first. True, 0.4% DP, case normal community spread. enclosed space, reproduction number teens people likely higher initial particle exposure, probably one factors high mortality healthcare workers.

Like said, areas IFR 0.16%. depends many factors.

Like add I've family member Covid. teen probably caught nightclub back March (full foreign students). really get sick flu. get really ill this, ill enough us call ambulance one night. pneumonia took months clear, triggered issues still dealing with.

So yeah worse flu, I've seen first hand. 

But 'killing 1% population' bad. I'm truly sorry thankful service Spring 2021 feasibility start national vaccine program. also makes uneasy president keeps naming major pharmaceuticals. won’t pretend know anything stock market statements must sway investors put money. 

Big pharma horrible. people top care money people. 
When worked Humira account exclusive patent drug ran out. Normal part cycle opens market brands. Since longer one decided buy factories equipped make type drug. Therefore still keep profit. 

So yeah, fan Pharma. Nervous moving way fast vaccine. uneasy Trump throwing Pharma names. Hey all! message France, see lot comments high number new cases.

Government dashboard understand going on: See helpful graphs «vue d'ensemble» vue, well «suivi des tests» view.

Ok, numbers tell things.

We've got lot cases right now, yes. also we're testing way, way more. We're currently around 160k tests/day weekdays, 65M people country. Back April around 10k tests daily only. means probably missed cases first wave, reported, countries may under-reporting cases too.

The important shit happens hospital. See «vue d'ensemble» view, «nouveaux patients hospitalisés» graph = new arrivals COVID hospital. «nouveaux patients en réanimation» graph, new COVID patients admitted ICU. Basically, moderate second wave, flattening, around 700 countrywide hospital admissions per day due COVID, 140 people admitted per day intensive care (induced coma, artificial ventilation all).

That's still much, «stock» people hospital increasing: see example «en réanimation» (in ICU) graph. low 400 beds august, 1400 beds countrywide. Peak 1st wave, 7000 ICU beds occupied COVID-19 patients, 30,000 overall beds.

Problem: winter coming, already represents 30% ICU beds country, 40% regions (see «carte des indicateurs»). means they're starting delay chirurgical operations. know they're gonna treat flu season. Plus, HUGE medical workforce fatigue. handled first wave pure courage bravery. can't handle second one.

Good news is: curves hard, nothing see first wave, COVID hit country totally unprepared. Seems masks social distancing helpful all. Deaths still controlled («only» 70 COVID deaths hospital per day, 700 first wave), that's gonna change sure.

So see, situation shit, we're mild second wave, COVID fatigue all, shit number cases would tell.

How get there, done currently, expected happen?

Well know, bad first COVID wave, little bit less Spain Italy, yet. choice strict lockdown country nearly two months. tests, mask, anything back then. many deaths fear.

Then country lift progressively lockdown, summer arrived. idea rely tests identify track agressively new cluster, put quarantine cases, «contact cases». Also: masks, mandatory public closed space, public transportation, etc, huge events cancelled. Well, honest, everybody relaxed. little bit much. taking mask thing annoyance, could easily lift taking drinks friends bar. Youngsters young people do: go beach, party friends. Well, virus spread everywhere, went undetected – lot youngsters asymptomatic. realized it, little bit late.

Since September, government struggling try fight mild second wave, coming youngsters, crawling ages. First tightened mask obligation. Paris region, mandatory pretty much everywhere except home. Even street, parks. enough, lowered bar meetings. They're closing bars (again) big cities, keeping restaurants open. Saying companies rely much possible telework. can't afford second real lockdown, companies, factories, transportation, restaurants, shops, everything stay open. course country economic depression, companies closing, people fired all.

It's happy period, we're surrounded cases.

I think winter gonna tough, somehow, I'm optimistic, trend bad (not steep hospital entrance death curve, due controlled R0 social limitations). second lockdown many deaths (I hope, Madrid makes fear). Just, want everybody.

So it, reporting France, hope explains little bit what's going here. 14 hours ago. confusing Case fatality rate infection fatality rate. Restrictions wealthy countries really different restrictions countries people little access good water. Bars closing St Louis roads closing Somalia, leaving people starve. 100 million people.get that's 650,000 death kinda margin error brigading. see post talapark, talaview, temstar going high turnout pro ccp. full shit. Gloat? No, genuinely know mechanisms immunology virus. inferring information now, there’s nothing wrong that. hope you’re wrong too, think it’s best err side caution pandemics, fervently eager return “normal” lives. vaccine comes out, even reinfection confirmed, likely observe stringent lockdowns adherence social distancing guidelines. IFR around .5-1 percent assumed while. I'm betting treatments death rate actually quite bit lower states. know article comment section right? Earliest could start national vaccine program.
And come working one. 

When say *every American get pandemic over.*?! 

Pointing EARLIEST everyone could start getting vaccinated Spring 2021.
A people count. Nowhere US CASE hospitalization rate high. ones ""run democrats""

this uniquely divisive american president Exactly. Anything else anecdotal. downvotes US 30 40 million ready end year, ability produce basicly 50 plus million month. going wait till March deliver those, roll them.

So April let's say theory 200 million people could already vacinated US. Scared people ride busses. agree you. want say something. work manufacturing make lot packaging ppe, ventilators, test kits, antibody test kits, well manufacturing ppe. hit saw much packaging making ventilators. 24/7, 7 days week, weekends holidays operation us. TV, watch MSM. standpoint data company alone, 100% assure novel coronavirus, very, real. Keep good fight. 

Everyone reading this, please show love kindness empathy appreciation towards healthcare workers, can't even imagine must going continue going year. fact dangerous kids teens Covid

I think jury still considering things like potential long-term damage. think know yet.

Plus, COVID contagious. things dangerous get first place. Even risk factors like 99% chance surviving. Maybe 95%. already likely survive, what's important people surviving almost complications far. difference rich people get poor people. They're able get treated early enough, expensive medication they're week instead months. financially crippled, fact, overall cost might lower since overall stay hospital less. 

There's still chance second valley gets them, clear antivirals currently proving effective. still actively bad leadership. Intentionally misleading people. tried testing fewer people get numbers down? They'll weigh guess meant! 

I read afraid flu 2 weeks later COVID became cause concern. regularly pay attention news, COVID might even radar back February especially US downplayed beginning.  Sad, 80s aids pandemic would’ve fluke restricted monkeys gay men.

This admin never fails amaze fucking stupidity. Moving goalposts.... Whatever though.

Prove last statement. Considering ""bUt eCoNoMy"" crowd ok stop social distancing/quarantining/etc normal reached point.

People get family usual.

On hand also understand leaders many countries let many people precarious situations (no money, job, terrible support overall). piss poor management many countries. Doubt online learning continue next year students parents finding unacceptable now. whole situation isn’t control next year it’s time adjust.

I agree everything else said though. firmly grounded reality, realize without strict enforcement precautionary measures, shutting things get control seems choice prevent hospitals overrun.

It seems favor letting hospitals get overrun rather impliment targeted shutdowns prevent happening.

What plan medical system cannot handle number cases refuse shut anything due enforcing basic precautions?

Additionally, stop making shit me. lie make point, point either worth making, properly equipped make point. Many also claim he's pretty unstable receiving medication. busy lives turns 365 day year 40day year different people different pages yadayadyadaa one thing constitution calls federal government call militias repel foreign invasions ie state national guard. mention disease something federal government called address. pertinent section constitution. foreign invasions.

That's issue.  want round jews? seems pretty fascist inferring despite ""on contrary!"" past set events kind proves what's said mask usage. almost certain person responding US. 

Non-Americans always give us way much credit, someone direct blunt surely American. ones shop place work, hours, pestering sometimes abusing staff, refusing cover faces, making plans group gatherings, taking explosive shits poorly ventilated restrooms. Sometimes Karens male, BTW. majority people serious case it. 

The issue large amounts people getting it, still large amount bad cases it. everyone US got it, would kill millions hospitalize many times that, example.

Germans slightly shorter average, northerners around border less height That’s Fauci said said illogical. Because... Constitution says right stupid, infect others process, FREEDOM!!!!!!

/s Come on. really think virus knows affluent different countries are? matter live, matters good country handling pandemic.

Vietnam economically worse America, better chance surviving virus Vietnam America. berufsvorbereitende Bildungsmaßnahme (think education level grade 9 4) thought get fresh air in, instead Querlüften (letting air two, opposite sides). teachers also suggested could take mask long 1.5 metres away... yeah shit air clearing method one infected next day everyone gonna infected well. US, blamed shitty COVID response ones elected government continue support them...even minority rule begin due Electoral College &amp; GOP ratfucking, there's still sizeable loud demographic willing die COVID current admin. 

Russia China luxury, extremely unfair blame leader's failings, although China seems well enough. 

Sure, could 2nd Russian Revolution, thing would incredible feat 2020 Putin. Outside that, seems like Russian People held captive extreme minority rule, one man. 

TL;DR?

That's literally said.  believe opposite opponent's party. homes clean. separated COVID deaths pneumonia, course (wouldn’t useful data otherwise). July deaths due COVID much higher flu+pneumonia. lump flu+pneumonia together people don’t die flu directly, typically causes pneumonia results death.

Still big number though. still hear depressingly large number people everyday life deal whole “well don’t know something doesn’t seem right” story talk number infected/dead/severity cases whatever. 

I don’t think underestimate sheer amount damage done United States deliberate attempts federal government downplay crisis. talk exceptionally high rate exceptionally high? sucks family member died I'm sorry hear change anything.

it's contagious kills people.

But side note, COVID attacks organs body way flu doesn't, along stuff like blood clots, etc. might vascular disease instead respiratory disease:

Us Americans don’t get much world news hyper partisan friends think we’re country corona it’s Trumps fault. forget things slow down, measures slow growth also go away. people stop wearing masks, ability disease transfer increase range. Right may 40% change everything wide open. Realistically... them, probably not. Very, businesses shut 6-18 months still exist end. like people work just... job time either. 

Public health concerns key right now, doubt it. utter collapse tourism entertainment industries plenty issues well. government September bragged test 25,000 per day resigned goal due fact test more, infections show. days, perform 14,000 tests little done weekend. Arguably countries leading CDC's advice. faster masks, faster announce airborne matter droplets (the CDC came recently say that, deleted statement, adjusted - 8 months every western democracy), Birx CDC director play propaganda regularly acting though antibody treatment complete revolution treatment, etc., etc.

It’s difference news language countries something complain about. Clickbait would something like “You Won’t Believe Horrifying New Way Coronavirus Infect You”. Unfortunately, guess make quote yeah quite. Still loads cases every day. I'll agree cases dipping 100 per day.  Czech government plans current PM lies public control. caving infection would indicate PM things control would lose power. willing sacrifice thousands lives long remain power. Czechia like country run populists, absolutely apathetically resigned moment disaster. Sheesh none guys even public transportation lives. People public transit wearing masks years Coronavirus. Airflow passenger jets forced (and sucked) downwards face towards feet. sucked HEPPA filter par with, better than, one used operating rooms. air recycled mixed fresh air outside. shitload cleaner people think is. one dumb asshole mask breathing row behind dead fucked.

If HCQ effective... Trump take it?  


And no... covid 99.9% survival rate.  


You've repeated every single messed (and wrong) theory covid-19 one paragraph. That's pretty impressive. right attitude. We’re maybe halftime. one knows end got right. replicated due differing laws cultures. like wants everyone infected drug buddies make bank selling cure could said others. Why? reason? Well might pass like Herman Cain said felt better yet orange doofus coughing hacking Covid away. way he’ll rally tomorrow without cough every 5 minutes You’re fucking dumb Vancouver, I'm guessing.

Same Montreal. Mask GTFO. wiggle room, except actual, legit medical issues. need official papers prove this. Keep mind, Russia claims already rushed vaccine. see going. That's 2 cases shown. That's all. little bit - friend told makes sense we're used activities cause apprehension normally would. showed two sources now, still talk, proof learn new zealand won't. 

They strict. sure you’re getting downvotes. You’re absolutely right. It’s POSSIBLE it’s POSSIBLE everyone coughed last October run mill illness.  expect law enforcement bus drivers fine everyone? president Pence must outta damn fucking minds! It’s “basic rules” lot us. Nyc opened indoor dining already closing even week. Indoor activities don’t exist unless it’s home.  video appearances done aside single video could muster white house lawn? 


I've hearing scattered phone calls lots coughs, certainly sound encouraging since usually video calls.  


Does look horrible he's switched predominantly phone interviews first time campaign?  


 
(EDIT: removed previous comment trump videos lawn appear green screened previously reported. Still appearances/videos since got back White House. we'll see looks like tomorrow) Thanks. blank names. That’s least one secondary infection. think people talking 6 days news Chris Christie hospital. Plus heads security quarantine. like producing one prevents us producing one. multiple vaccines help us bring pandemic end quickly. Different patient population. elderly catching rampant long term care homes. it’s students better equipped, seemingly, fight off. problem. Kids stupid anyway. realize United States made states politics regulations enforced. isn’t run single government nations throughout history would already taken evil trash out. One way another. everyone cheers, zombies ruin bunker, keep looking new safe home. seems. shortage gullible people follow him.

Another long line wrong decisions made regarding pandemic. easy make right decision... bad thing common sense anymore. city (which Canada one worst homelessness, drug abuse, undiagnosed mental disabilities problems), bus system mandatory masks. signs couple weeks became enforced. wearing mask get on, driver let on. ignore requests wear mask entire duration ride, transit police called meet bus next stop. similar school dress codes vs mandatory masks. choose enforce it, simple. National shutdown never happen work. Like keep saying..... Covid 19 making new believers everyday. Sad way Russian vaccine fake news. Got it. Thanks! People like tyranny. people rational enough accept 0.4% death rate population wide. No, keeping distance single best alternative. virus pass filter can't infect people nearby Dumbass fromage eaters they're trying force ""herd immunity"" theory everyone France smashes harder 20 wish would like visual diagram voting certain politicians propositions would affect us. know friends educated issues know politicians represent. 

I think that's US honest. We'd blindly voting.

When voted Obama 08, thought would question. blindly voted positions props. 

They sure hell discuss school. 

Until public education system fixed gonna pretty clueless comes politics. needs specific treatment discovered current administration. like miracle god. feel better 20 years ago. let virus control life. Positivity rate much different since March bad YET was. work restaurant live family try get tested every 10 days regardless always wear mask. Cant get restaurant shut family dead.

It'll magically disappear one day. tell ya. There's issue Europe. Masks become politicized. Take look asian nations masks worn lot. Well thats euphoria roids. lol Dr. literally pick opposite view science every time ensure take unique? many peeps? latest census numbers? It’s news article scientific paper.

I always look research want delve something.

Popular press articles generally pretty bad expressing science.

Scientists generally don’t talk results it’s preprint. look scientist took seconds.




 speculation isn’t justified speaking general way. I've social-distancing like Bin Laden

I'm stealing that. Along co-worker said, ""stay away people, go ... I've training years"" Thanks! understand mindset people go online spend months end writing scared virus something virtuous. Wow, wear mask. Wow, take vaccine. Wow, rebel. That's cool dude.

What want, fucking medal? Love new studies blog picks up, pseudo Covid scientist comment thread happens upon it, propels ether pseudo scientists discuss. Show reputable source documenting widespread prevalence COVID United States January. Selfishness one many manifestations stupidity household sick around Feb also. I'm sure really indicates anything think it. Since people get sick time....those us happened around time ones saying ""hey sick also."" non covid first place everyone sick around time would reason mention today. 🤔 can’t speak everyone, situation take short mental breaks throughout day feel energized get things done. work large research/manufacturing facility walk place get meetings probably cut hour day alone. I’m also typically cooking/eating lunch answering emails instead driving somewhere go eat. 

Because nature job, still go 2-3 days per week rotating schedule get things done physically can’t get done home. days dedicated specific work I’m running meeting lab back meeting Susan stopping hall ask 20 questions... back lab

I’m sure lot people work job structured, overall coworkers seem lot happier actually getting projects turned around faster. ""It effects virtually nobody""
-rump dad deathly sick December. symptoms COVID lot trouble breathing. Bad enough mom tried make go hospital resisted. got it, said felt like shit next two months after. 

Oddly, mom didn’t get sick all, digestive issues odd her. said bad dad kept distance sick. Even slept different room.

My dad repairs laundry equipment visits laundry rooms apartment buildings college campuses. One college goes regularly lot international students. he's recently said ""incredibly young"". age 74. CDC said human human transmission? Definitely said Masks anything June Cuomo decided maybe NYC subway cleaned? 4 months late.....I need answers lol really need ""may have""? Everybody knows did. one case. Burden show ""I sick"" anecdotes COVID. I’m sure people seem get upset Orthodox Jews spread virus blatantly ignoring rules times worldwide virus spread religious people blatantly ignoring rules.

It’s issue pretty much every religion, though don’t claim know all. stories stories since started religions spreading virus. politicians want gain power money

That's exactly want Biden whole primary lying said did, wasn’t called address it, people think he’s show going swayed held accountable office? Lol

He might better trump one pile shit good. Might better four piles shit, it’s still pile shit. idea he’s going swayed progressives hilarious he’s calling names idiots bragging he’s going “compromise” republicans. Yeah think comment gave wrong impression. totally understand. simply small friend group. 

When school shutdowns started March, schoolboards ready. assignments published weekly fraction ONE school day. honestly improve per parents even June. mention kids without internet/computers/young students tech literate parents home left behind. 

In September school boards staggered start dates(probably good idea), last week still sorting Chromebooks students without, trying get extra teachers/shuffle classes about. 

The ball dropped government schools imo summer, hard. 

Chances are, keeps schools going close again(justifiably), school boards going tough time transition. 

And clear, I'm blaming teachers, leadership, straight ministry fucking premier. would benefit anyone? 2020- Y’all wanted “shake up”? consequences Yeah, really lucky deadly. think one neighborhood friends it. Hopefully see kind numbers COVID. imagine many people die hit 60m cases states. Lol think so. Maybe exception norm. Screw that, already get headaches wearing one day work. Outdoor transmission super low risk. understand wearing one cramped building questionable ventilation, I'm spending life wearing mask unnecessarily. year like people think. I've lost faith majority fellow Americans. 

We'll either close entirely open wear masks. 

Nobody wins pandemic. 

But make worse either. Oh boy, blaming men. next, gonna point finger white people say they’re privileged care? haven’t seen anywhere else yet so.... means nothing. don’t know. I’m tired. White House overruled scientists specialists they’re retarded won't. even leave goddamn West Wing press pool came home Monday. complained Kayleigh McEnneny possibly spreading ""voiced concerns""... still, stayed. can't think worse message send leaving middle outbreak. really access.

An abusive relationship even begin describe media covers administration. think anyone confused Trump Admin isn’t thinking crazy evil enough. talking full blown Nazi idealism goal maximum harm culling anyone like them. (White rich elites).

COVID overwhelming killing BIPOC. Sure it’s also killing whites too, remember see sickness weakness. actually believe better every way - God side genes better. Even get sick completely convinced nothing worry about. little believing science everything culling.

From business point view see state unemployment ripe opportunity. millions people willing anything amount money. keep wages people kept work 10x hard don’t want lose jobs.

It also opens housing market wealthy aholes buy everything dirt cheap make even more. rich benefit pandemic every way. also already plenty money insulate themselves. huge amounts space, multiple houses, private planes boats. social lifestyle might changed little much.

Keeping large portions population sick means chaos fatigue. American healthcare bad hospitals get run account people could saved won’t be. Citizen tired fight back get away even more. 

People need wake except want many people die possible. I’m honestly surprised trump isn’t holding meet greets pay shake hands him. sure think insane cult would thrilled get blessed COVID president carrying, make stronger chosen! 

He wants spread government believes kill loyal him. Like said people need start thinking crazier evil comes Trump enablers. don’t believe die, loss keep power court centuries acceptable. people believe superior humans deserve rule America. think key set laws tax structure viable way organize large business democract worker owned way. Set ups workers getting set amount money labor decision making powers heavily disincentivized. Set ups workers getting either ownership share profit sharing voting power decision made higher organization heavily incentivized. Separating wages operating costs making come profit instead first biggest thing could mind achieve this.

Right every business runs like mini dictatorship instead ran like mini democracies world would lot better place. thing devastated FL nursing homes... one thing governor took seriously, locked tighter anywhere.

He absolutely right kept death rate check.

He's getting rid restrictions continue hundreds daily deaths. roommate ICU nurse said unit lost 8 patients it’s one Seattle. could also constant ""i feel weird, could covid/post-covid?"" self-rotating cycle thoughts. times click report brings reddits page tells people opinions go fuck wanna report someone. think report function that. Gotta open ticket 2 dozen tickets I've opened blatant racist murder subs gotten zero replies reddits admins. maintenance guys:  #:0 even scientists don’t debate even among scientists stringent criteria FDA issue EUA COVID-19 vaccine. Lawrence Corey Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, co-leads NIH’s COVID-19 vaccine trials network helped put symposium together, called issue “the elephant room.” says FDA’s guidelines put bar low ask 50% reduction relatively mild symptoms fever, cough, fatigue, loss taste smell. Instead, Corey argued vaccines also shown prevent called “medically complicated” COVID-19, translates sick enough seek care. champ. Lol chain smokers ya go jep we're fucked. *Trust People* work. politics need stomp ground. police need send fines directly must high fuck. chance go like next weeks stop curve getting higher higher. look future really looks bad us... really nasty illness floating around late December. sickest I've ever been. covid, preceding global pandemic definitely left general public suspicious. ""It's rare""

It rare. survival economies requires us get economies going again! Woowwwwwwwwwww. 

You’re trolling right? that's probably goal. Harper shit knew going lose Canada. Trump kind way regard. much hated Harper least could form sentence. Trump last time he's leaving oval office likely drop match paper waste bin. 150000 idoits..... anyone medical faculty Reddit University sign? disagree, vocal abilities definitely improved. saw live 2018 Perfect Circle hitting notes used avoid live. breath technique almost perfected also making great use head chest voice like never before. Chronic coughing changes vocal range, gets lower raspier part professionals know protect voice usually access laryngoligist help avoid long term damage. doesn’t make sense many people could miss obvious. way through, we’ve heard people talking low numbers infection among children, schools shut down. schools open, numbers going again. 

What missing here? Randy Rainbow line? ""You're siding virus, cuz virus too."" mean, compared states like Dakotas, LA County isn’t bad. Consider this, Dakotas combine 1.5 million population compared LA County 10 million. Dakotas combined 1400 cases yesterday 1000 LA County. it’s great LA County, there’s places much worse. 100%...had guy ask knew anyone died. Well, personally don’t, personally didn’t, proof that’s blown proportion. Like, don’t know anyone died plane crash, either, but... I'm beginning think Republicans WANT everyone get covid. one point, traveling meetings/partys. we're fucked. *Trust people* work. stop without lockdown patroling police swnds tickets right away think really depends see mask. people dont enjoy wearing masks, see something may help keeping others safe lessening spread, big deal put one on. hand see symbol totalitarian government trying enforce senseless rules ""expert"" youtube said so, wearing giving freedoms shadow government dictatorship, could see person may tend problems wearing mask. mean hand IMO people experience taste totalitarian dictatorship put everything perspective them, luckily im lawmaker negligible risk high risk group. Yes can. survival economies requires it. ""controversial"" stupid. around 10% infected, we'd millions deaths stupid herd became immune. Praying go away makes much sense much chance working. Regarding critic/advice think part job scientist give advice asked. (luckely) politician/PR agent. never given advice without asked far know. 

I dont know exactly kind advice reffering too, example? Considering many times I’ve seen people refuse wear masks they’re one store it, doubt claim. ""mom, grandma, love much. retarted"" What's quoting yearly cost drug? gonna year. mean lesson virus can't *really* controlled governmental policy? ban shitty pay wall articles sub already? testing. think he'd tolerate swab refusing point on? Dr Spock here, sorry I'm late fucking republican explain fuck would that? You’re actually way head arguing someone strong formal background practices engineering company know. I’m middle writing long explanatory post wait. need dispel dangerous information you’re spreading to. I'm surrounded them, follow closely daily.

They've locked tighter almost anywhere country.

There have, course, outbreaks, testing readily available get quick treatment, MUCH greater measures place segment society. going amazed quickly things improve functioning federal government.

That depends news station watch. second Biden office Fox News crying terribly Democrats handled crisis. never even got happens restrictions lifted everything open 100%. second wave starting. double deadly flu deadly. work population (most population) must support it. Without public support work. Masks scientific. That's recommended past pandemics. That's also see charts like cargo cult. lol none bullshit true. 'Murican Christianity cult religion. DeSantis said times, affected agricultural workers.  KY schools report cases exposure ORIGINATED school. could kid walking around positive school week, since got home weekend picnic reported. health department contract trace infected someone school reported. almost 2000 year story cloud deity banging hooker somehow relevant anymore depends mean ""work"". possible antibodies worked decrease viral levels prevented getting even worse did. Without knowing info impossible know. Yes course tourism great many places w/o real restrictions Yeah. Literally nobody give shit anymore. can’t lock humans long expect continue isolate. Sure blame orthodox Jews asinine. 

What they’re problem. whatever causing surge Broome county cases manhattan week Illegal Chinese coming across exactly reason second wave Da Nang months back. Also tens thousands Vietnamese citizens waiting get back, counting foreign workers others difficult time getting back. Again, “authoritarian” measures could’ve applied Europe US, still could, aren’t they’re suffering. Masks mandated Victoria Australia 23rd July, 12 days later 4th August hit peak number new cases started gradual decline, lockdown also stepped stage 4 3 two days prior peak. 

Given delay typically seen someone infected getting tested, seems unlikely measure enacted two days prior caused decline new cases... suggests masks impact spread virus.

This also jives I've seen personally areas high mask compliance often active/new cases, areas lower socioeconomic status low compliance continue see trickle cases (and vast majority total historical cases). I'm convinced want us get point... Doctor Strange, Doctor Who, Doctor McCoy reporting in, sir. Flirida's economy anything intact.

The entire tax base gone, government nearly bankrupt, UI cupboard bare, unemployment among highest nation, theme parks forced re-shut half hotels, etc due people simply wanting come here.

We swamped people permanent heart lung damage one states highest uninsured rates nation, reasons higher death rates NY hit later,, significant improvements made early stage treatment dramatically improved survivability, unlike NY, near total lockdown nursing homes early wave lasted recently.

In every way, fared terribly. google nursing home Covid deaths Florida said dude day. Went telling boggles mind conman winning still even possibility.

He's cool guy thought could get past Trumper (I'm staying long-term hostel right now) holy fucking shit.

Dude a:
1). Anti-vaxxer
2). Flat-earther
3). Anti-masker
4). Plandemic conspirator
5). Trumper
6). ?? Likely more

I told ""Give reality chance."" 
He brought Obama/Clinton said ""give present chance.""
Etc. *except schools. really thought going go Moon. playing real life humor sat car waiting post office daughter.

Take care Yeah people worried economic impact mental health one really issue. No, antibodies tested virus made hek293 cells.  antibodies made cells. Dr. House MD signed humiliated initiators white house... Snopes extremely reluctant say bad things GOP :p I’m explaining phenomenon Funny message written tone got downvoted lol. Sarcastic Truth hurts guess! read papers would know saying.

Which papers exactly would infection elict robust systemic immune memory accross disease severities

And yet papers looking report lower antibodies fading faster mild asymptomatic cases. 

The reported properly documented reinfection cases, small sample size are, basically 33%/33%/33% milder/same/more serious. 

For CCCs, actually extensive studies severity reinfection one would like see -- looked at, sample sizes always small. given CCC infections mild begin with, assessing severity easy. 

In case, know empirically truth next 18 months, perhaps next 6. 

I take Iranian officials saying 20-30% hospitalized patients current wave reinfection cases seriously -- downplaying COVID throughout whole pandemic, absolutely reason saying repeatedly, yet are. well go yet another example uppity academic experts West disregarding empirical evidence rapidly developing real-world situation like source, getting caught pants down. phenomenon multiple instances throughout whole thing. 

You ad hominem really deserve response, whatever, know talking to, let's leave that. Center Diseased Corruption, moved 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Since China done well covid, think time rest world listen learn. LOL want mods sticky this. People speculating previous theory popular. study worthless. shows another type flu spread across US pretty severe. That's great, stupidly irresponsible suggest Covid-19 Washington Maybe town tiny everyone knows other.

In populated lot backup staff 100% chance turns chaos. See Montreal 70s cops went strike. don’t think cared whether spread. inflated view themselves, thought could downplay entire thing would go away. Making big deal gives justifications lockdowns financial stimulus/support much oppose.

What failed realize past epidemics went away acted. People still voting shitshow go F themselves. I'm Catholic, attend mass every Sunday, exceptions possible attend, sick. Turns out, everyone sick even exception. Churches outright shut we're limited capacity. Catholic churches diocese shut voluntarily even churches recommended close went streaming. Zero reason people need physically go church right now. Seems like White House wants many Americans possible get sick die.  way. known. nearly great seems. year people want go person. kind hope is. normally get 2 3 colds, predictable times year...this year, 0 colds great.

&amp;#x200B;

i inconvenienced masks  Supertrumper? Obviously.

Why people think testing means you’ll safe? Especially country people think testing positive isn’t bad thing.

Testing *detection*. Social distancing face masks *prevention*. I'm going Lexus nexus dude, I'm telling consensus Nice choice permanent wfh cracked be. lot coworkers can't wait get back office sorts reasons  ""no politics"" rule go. possible talk COVID-19 response US without also talking total, malicious incompetence administration. Thats actually quite interesting Im sure social distancing measuring. France isnt requiring citizens apply social distancing really even shit still complying.

edit:

Bars still open, even capital. Travel still allowed regions, even upcoming holiday season.

We friends visiting kids next week. live covid hotspot side country. coming kids. wife wants us go Disneyland. Thats still fucking open whatever reason. Stop infringing right cult!!! yet debate trundles on

That article about. paucity quality evidence. 

And Osterholm specifically criticizes people (IE: almost reddit) end mindlessly pushing mask wearing based low quality evidence. Except secondary infected cases (+5-14 days event) tertiary cases. safe assume 100% infected event primary infections. I’m sorry got sick hope you’re feeling better. true - and, fact, could debated way around.

Well true, done ethics minefield.

But saying point infecting virus, point. There's multiple vaccines nearly done many anti-viral treatments final stages trials. Donald Trump got one. makes sense expose virus knowingly right instead waiting months seeing outcomes Phase III trials vaccines anti-virals ending beginning 2021. guess also forgot Astros supposed booed season long. doubt crowds disallowed back-to-back years especially going on. dipshit White House They'll plenty opportunities practice faith healing. maybe already did. best way learn live it

Whether like not, best way “live it” means shutting periodically keep things spiraling control. outbreaks actually exists 0.68 billion people spread virus around? go walk dog go shops Government buildings. I’m going place long period time line example. I’ll wear KN95 mask cover on. I’m walking going supermarket I’ll wear home made mask I’ve sewed they’re two layers cotton moulded polyurethane middle. touch anything outside immediately use alcohol gel 80% ingredients takes approximately 15 seconds disinfect hands.
I hold wet wipe hands soaked gel open community building door etc 
I’ve months. sounds crazy realistically it’s way. live centre city population 1.5 million people mostly social distancing. think mask covers yawning OBVIOUSLY know actions included happens... russia coronavirus catches you. It'd look beyond ugly way. civil war would spark way easier. hope get better soon possible. check paper positive negative controls?

And sensitivity specificity often trade offs, it’s clear new extra sensitive test also high specificity.

But again, speculating pretty pointless. raw number cases? makes sense point comparison, due vast differences size every country. really obvious? get old unhealthy remaining years worth less younger person. example death child much worse death 84 year old child many quality adjusted life years (QALY) left . 

Right 150 million people (many children) sliding extreme poverty thanks world's attempt fight COVID lockdowns. lives literally worth vast majority COVID victims average 82 years age globally. Michigan Dept Health Human Services reinstated immediately. We’re good....thank god..as work retail come face face customers daily....a select still wearing chinstrap noses tho.... Dude people sub love draw normalcy like late 2021 society literally let happen. three vaccines like cmon caught regular flu four times flu season (Australia). Spent working online furious sanitising home deliveries. I’m horrified sick despite precautions. Idk going safe go bars clubs again. along lines least 6 months 1 year. think around tail end 2021 go party again. Perhaps even 2 years things spiral continue unchanged take longer time. 

In mean time learn live ""new normal"" socially physically distance avoid gathering even within families. Continue careful habits hand-washing minimal necessary travel.
And use mask crowded settings like public transport stores. fo relatively easy tasks avoid hard lockdowns locked ins.🔒🖖☺️💚 10. occupancy restrictions. 60 percent positivity rate? how? covid mutated spread easily? That's incredibly high positivty rate. Wow. No, still definite tragedy. I'm sure point is. want us care less? consider acceptable level caring? went 800+ 35ish circumstances noticed much yet. Ping changed slightly? far less gaming tbh. understand point, I'm sure need point Stephen Hawking American, really understand point. Trump loses, imagine many books coming regarding zaniness Whitehouse? I'm lot people ready start talking. Yep agreed. said days ago cases Canada surging got downvoted ‘cos dared say Canada’s population fraction USA also shitty job’ live smack bang downtown Toronto pair eyes see fucking idiots live Canada’s largest city. yeah downvote away tell I’m wrong toe line Canada way better states, it’s really not. Yea kind shit definitely intentional thanks FU WH anecdotal company outsourced tech support change management stuff Philippines kinda wish that. saw second wave imported Alberta. we'll one vaccine, btw. Let guess...the county east red/trump leaning county...(I'm familiar parts CA).  says enough vaccinated then, means green light those? /u/tb0x. much likely limit social interactions wear masks, since know significant preexisting conditions.

Where getting from? dialysis patients actually likely low income racial minority, two groups likely exposed due crowded living conditions working jobs can’t done remotely. CZ government repeats plan lock down.

Which actually means nothing exactly spring. Everything fine, lock planned, went sleep free country woke locked down.

I believe stand. 8600 cases 30% positivity shock put work, best guess spin wheels weekend come legislative framework, wait monday hope numbers gonna slow hit button tuesday. 

Nothing point. read eyes open. Still mean everything gonna back normal time. It'll take months things dispersed, numbers get satisfied enough allow thousands people go event. Like Broadway show, concert, baseball game, etc. fall now, let see France could beat Russia winter. Yep I’ve basically completely converted working home. able roll bed, shower, get work awesome. actually like working office, it’s better way get know teammates socialize bit better. able job home cut drive time amazing. Time 100 get ratio rate idiot. fuck off. fringe ideas. Furthermore, science infallible changes a
ALL time. aligned ideology happens like. Well, it’s mostly understand science evidence.

I agree infection count much higher cases, I’m taking exception assertion 10fold consensus position.


You’ve got three links, two arent actually peer reviewed literature one isn’t review literally can’t speak consensus.

Meanwhile examples non-reviewed sources ranges figures like 2 13.

Again, made specific claim consensus know can’t support it. None sources show consensus.


Again, review article would need show think true.

Let know get one those. combination both, kind arrogance want true matters. Ty sweets! Whoever reported fell window ............accidentally course India isn’t “doing really well”. government admitted actual number cases probably closer 150 million data? thought New York City point ? use best estimate numbers convert ratio percentage since thats common lingo 
Best estimate infection death rate according link.
0-19 years: 0.003%

Why countries mask mandates *worse*?

Why else could Arizona's cases declined? decline population infectivity observed Florida Texas? *Yes*.

Why California cases grow time Florida Texas despite mask mandate?

There *no evidence* mask use. look county, realize new cases coming rural areas. Franklin County, populated county, lowest daily case counts since March. Even tho love World War Z (the book, movie), though fairly unrealistic depicted governments, specially USA's, people mindnumbly stupid end front pandemic... know painfully point everything, real article talking advice, talking mandatory. Lmao think he's end spectrum, gone lunatic 'roid-raging lunatic. never wanted play like :( Literally first thought. they’d come strong straight away lie may gotten away it.

Honestly, he’s getting tested. Testing protect others doesn’t give shit. tests uncomfortable moments. slight discomfort benefit others power carry life virus, way regularly testing.

So they’ve caught tested positive showed symptoms everyone wants know last tested negative. can’t. agreed test symptoms. 

I don’t believe went debate etc testing positive don’t think tested symptoms didn’t seem symptoms debate. believe turned late didn’t tested though. Yeah without even country women can't heavy lifting. people pushing political agenda compare COVID flu.

Uncivil screaming nurse inches away face, you’re mad price oil. Btw there's name doing. called gish-galloping. spend 20 minutes dispelling one link taking away wrong idea time spend spamming links without address previous arguments original take. read saying studies linking to. Also, fact linking something relies on. correlative argument arguing masks work there's casual link found, shows illiterate truly are. people besides players talk refs Surewly Microsoft offices lot surveillance, home one could secretly lift data without someone else watching shoulder. GOP lawmakers blatantly ignoring CDC guidelines could possibly spread COVID-19 Toxic Masculinity* Yes, need nazi regime back weak virus whose numbers overblown, cool rent big house convenient location, i.e. kinda isolated still well connected receive supplies? Here: two within last 24 hours. One studies read commented scientific subreddit. want more? 

Florian Krammer Vaccines: wont keep going arguing walls aint fun, get gist it. back marcj/april didnt test much, ""new case"" shit accuarate big load untested case, test see lot more, course 20k really big (thats ""best"") true number case back march higher sure I’ve preparing second wave 2 months everyone thought crazy. also watched state looked south asking, “how learn?” watch state get lax masks, social distancing, etc. I’m incredibly angry. targets really near impossible time frame needed.

Just fyi, actually really close. Unknown cases 7 tomorrow 14 day period (target 5). contact tracing team makes us look like third world country.

Seems working properly least. 

IMO unlucky example rest country. national plan seemed factor would fairly easy control suppress. showed wasnt really possible everyone moved target essentially elimination. another state leak first possibly would careful contact tracing would required. (again, realise assumption part) Here's latest case/death charts Minnesota, running 7-day currently 37.36 deaths per 100k population. ranks state 30th per capita  yet. still process losing too, lost game. talk anyone long racist uncivil, were.

Doesn't matter group belong to. Get soomlab airqueen brand Korea. wear 8 hours problem Here's latest case/death charts Los Angeles county, running 7-day overall Los Angeles great also terrible (relatively speaking). They're 66.77 deaths per 100k population, ranks 712th among US counties. Yeah. I'm sure that's lot harder measure. we've got data paradoxes mandates exist, cases ignored, order officially banning enforcement all.

If anything, big picture data irl dumpster fire coherent plan rules. Somehow don’t think read past headline article. Give us summary Boris Johnson saying speech did. Oh I'm sorry. sound like deep. I'm lucky parents aligned thinking, mother's brothers, live Texas, support Trump. range really liking knowing Trump full s*** supporting anyways Democrats worse, way Trump best thing ever happen anywhere ever.

Thinking mom committed uncles, can't decide worse. Knowing he's horrible yet voting anyway, disconnected reality can't see horrible is? make assertions regarding certain demographics without racist, especially working non-inclusive environment. Atlas shrugged kidding me? lots restrictions around here. Mask mandate, 1.5 meters minimum two persons, tons tons restrictions. We're less touched area France! [Trump says know man. EU surpassing US daily infections, Poland 800 daily (top! news story) around September. October today 5000+. making tests, quite opposite, halved them. 

Yesterday world also record infections. Thanks Wait it’s HBO? Cool! thought I’d need Comedy Central. Attempting herd immunity generate millions disabled people Oh no? isn’t service industry accounts 70% GDP? 

Hmmm. Could swore Germany nice place visit. Things must changed. One argue amount evidence wasn’t enough worry parents beginning. Sure heard kids die diseases, maybe even knew someone, likelihood kid...? Today ample testing ease acquire information (and learning history) people gladly accept medical advice...? I'm talking excessive deaths reason. seeing excessive pneumonia deaths flu deaths? Nothing really stood March. saviors children getting raped, eaten, adrenochrome harvested Hillary Tom Hanks...depends team on. It’s almost like things related! Nah, simulation running low power. Sounds good me. How? gives little sniff hugs women. fine Trump retweet someone saying ""The good Democrat dead Democrat"". yeah.

Can imagine Obama that? ever experienced sprawl US? Economist estimates numbers may 20x higher detected April. 3m cases per week Europe. love stupid motherfuckers can’t comprehend learn new information completely novel situation time.  Take vitamin D, exercise, get sleep. Argentina rocking 15,000 cases 55% positivity weeks (just another reference point) almost like Trump admin Republicans want old people die clear social security roles, small businesses families go bankrupt large corporations buy property cheap, people get sick big pharma customers lifelong health issues.  Nobody read fucking linked article.

Nothing suggests substantially Jan 1.

Now actually point made virus explosive spread driven superspreading events, simple model ""doubling every 3 days"" apply initial cryptic spread virus. fact expected takes multiple seed cases cause pandemic spread. majority seed cases actually go infect people eventually ultimately transmit. theorized actually happened first ""WA1"" case Washington State person simply responsible epidemic spread Washington. Genetically line virus completely displaced individual bringing genetically distinct virus WA.

So initial spread slow fizzle. get ignition though start talking 1,000 cases community, start getting superspreading events going continuously exponential math takes over.

So means plausible handfuls people got late Dec / early Jan. Nobody really rule out. nobody thread caught that. Probably less people Coronavirus Dec United States struck lighting Dec United States. think killed people would less resistance controlling might died like SARS. big difference SARS didn’t asymptomatic infection. knows. handled terribly maybe would let people die. explained false equivalency citing juxtaposed examples deliberately ignored arguing good faith. Something traps femboys getting pregnant??? went talk Pence someone. came watching kittens rpan dont entirely remember evident masks help, even everyone wore mask 24/7 still completely unavoidable. Less impact, yes. there's escaping thing 100%, mask not. evident now, many places masks worn 99% population seeing signs second wave No, no, good sir, you.

It's polite.  Add /s end message, please. Change 2 party system then. Go covid house! USA #1! states Australia avoided large second wave Melbourne sealing long land borders states, even using military NSW. US state could done using National Guard. 

Countries like Vietnam Thailand islands done same, sealing borders. Whereas Ireland island totally failed. Iceland also big second wave right now. 50% take vaccine, vaccine probably 50% effective. let's little math.  vaccine... probably 150k deaths per year. 

So it'll 3 times deadly flu... forever. No, didn't. completely agree! “Democrat aggression mode” meant terms policy. I.e became president, think would far likely push more, slightly leftist “radical” change. make sense? Sorry shit explanation haha 

For record don’t think she’s radical all. creature pretentious Man something special. 

If collective heads. Indie Valley? I'm sure haha meant it’s case. !remindme 243d

We shall see. theory threw kitchen sink him, probably demanded everything Seriously... hell would that?

The level stupid administration quit.

My best guess maybe fuck urban, blue areas rely heavily public transportation? CC released when? Entertained, no. Tired stupidity freedumbers, yes. fine issue localized, pandemic affects whole country. matter NYC mask mandate someone Iowa even upstate New York get sick travel there. crowded areas perhaps according china infections happen outside, infection risk like 0.03%

Going crowded pool party branson mo? Mask up. stinks
 I've seen one mask on. Now, people noses sticking out...  park daughter today first time like 8 months. count 9 families. Us one family people wearing masks. 7 families kids aren’t even wearing wrong, appear brought them.

About light cigarette bait someone complaining. Conveniently ignoring country fire Trump’s watch due pandering right wing extremists. Conveniently ignoring 200k deaths counting coherent strategy get control. Conveniently ignoring reason we’re consistently downplayed virus. Conveniently ignoring guy full racist moderates along left happy it. Give break. China two whole months dealing even cases. I'm American leave house 3 months, suicidal end period. 7 months, would killed myself. entertained? exactly, Sweden always recommended working home enforced social distancing guidelines limiting group sizes 50. Unlike countries nation wide lockdown couple months, Sweden one elderly care homes, albeit extended one ended mid-Sep. think depends population density. don’t wear one walk dog, one gets closer 10 ft me, don’t stop chat, it’s passing. might see 4 people per walk. would different running trail dozens people around. really going try million dead Americans.

This virus real nothing fictional virus used academic exercise. virus doesn’t care whether think it’s real not. Denial won’t protect anyone, Trump friends discovered. even mean Face shields scientifically proven offer protection whatsoever either wearer others. purpose medical settings keep mask clean dry. aerosols still go shield without obstacle. mask filters out. 

I hope Poland rigorous approach back UK, become completely acceptable wear useless shield crowded areas substitute masks.

Having said that, course alone walking outside night wear shield, nothing all. I'd still take mask pocket case never know going meet someone know, suddenly remember need get something something shop, instance. Yeah, let's see learn China:

-if outbreak mostly one single region easier control it;

-if keep borders closed indefinitely quarantine shit everyone entering, easier detect imported cases;

-if ruthless dictatorship afford enforce literal hi-tech police state everyone surveilled 24/7, easier track trace.

Given above, conclusion is:

-we learn nothing China situation nowhere near applicable reality pretty much country West. *Especially* Europe, except maybe Iceland something. guessing paid care? numbers lie... It’s almost insecure, damaged jackass daddy issues comes free trump/pence bumper sticker blue line flag. flu dangerous disease kills 100-200k people annually (globally). often use word flu apply generic respiratory illness, specifically influenza dangerous disease, fact dangerous kids teens Covid (although neither high IFR age) Dr Covid McCovidface though. see, countries gravitating towards Swedish model, way around. 

The problem that, course, relies social contract trust government citizens. don’t trust breach contract might able make work. outsiders perspective is, Nurses getting paid more. even know getting paid, more. still don’t know it. flew back panama four airports mid January  week later coughing fits lasted two three weeks later. needed inhaler breathe sometimes. thought asthma (which eventually was), something like always triggered viral infection eventually becomes asthmatic thing. 

I coughing fits late March, went away got pile medicine make asthma go away. don’t think ‘covid’ since really asthma, feel like first weeks whatever started could it. Especially since symptoms 1) feeling like absolute shit initial two days 2) super tired first days, like crazily fatigued 3) coughing started initial symptoms continued. feel like could well recovered, asthma carried another month since fucked lungs time. 

The last time coughing fits bad pneumonia 17 eventually ‘resolved’ turned asthma attacks similar symptoms. may affects - know still contagious couple weeks. Anytime reddit gets shit major religion, chance jumped like trampoline. think unions important tech. least pre corona jobs employees companies compete like company could switch. mask put avoid situation can. hard. I've said before, personally feel safer wearing mask outdoors time, go right ahead. judge it. personally this. wear mask makes sense. definitely not...

In theory Inside there's always someone who's responsible policing right enforce - retail workers, event staff, bus drivers, teachers, etc.

In practice never do. 

Every little bit help works. week ago returning home summer holidays passing red zone (most serious COVID-19 restrictions), saw cop car stationed bus station. busy — even stopped bus driver little talk. got police patrols cruising streets every town. least stop maskless people. interesting whether Christie actually turn man gave him, stay another season playing role Reek. Recommend effective balanced measures rather excessive draconian measures

I find odd beyond 2 month lockdown, NZ actually less restrictive measures Sweden better part last 5 months since reopened May. Finland Norway timeline NZ, albeit measures similar Sweden's. said, relatively short lockdown meant able flatten curves sooner preserve lives.

Yet, discussing country like NZ, uncommon hear people describe measures draconian. exactly NZ's measures effective balanced? change bad, even brought something awful.

Prior pandemic, company right CEO office culture. 50,000 employees. slightly less 10,000 essential. company sent everyone nationwide overseas work home first week March. May, I'm people manager, received survey senior leadership asking assess productivity team previous two plus months since working home. company critical infrastructure provider, incredibly busy team continued work effectively efficiently would office made sure survey results reflected that. June, employees got email giving two weeks decide wanted work home permanently, wanted cubicle space brick mortar location. three free guesses anyone who's read far majority people chose. :-)

In August September, company started announcing office consolidation plans. four brick mortar offices greater DC metropolitan area, going one. one, three half floors space, going one floor space building. Office space primarily going reserved senior management offices lock due sensitive information. Pretty much everybody else wants come physical office using hotel space.

I expecting company make office supplies office equipment available us coming months. intranet set way company 100% work home set up, agreements major office supplies providers, storefronts internally select printer things like that.

I think good thing. stress level lower since went exclusively work home I'm fending traffic, something always raised blood pressure. want state record, know sounds tone deaf. know that's way people experienced pandemic. know I'm lucky maintained employment able work home. merely point true. less stressed I've commuting. 

A lot made current administration cleaner air figures readings coming back EPA. pandemic gets credit well. air quality steadily worsening throughout entire administration primarily due lot rolling back clean air standards things nature, saw turn around April May time frame people stopped commuting.

Ditch masks open economy. Definitely not. virus far, far smaller parasites ivermectin treats, really ""infect"" individual cells.

Conveniently ignoring countless protestors/rioters country didn’t give shit preventing spread virus. got sick stopped 🤔 Right? confused hell me. Huh?

I look up, seems false. matter, always vote. economic contraction, global economy ... Along good advice - Make schedule structured. 

I worked contractor overseas basically lockdown 24/7/365, surprised unmotivated get routine things like meals, exercise, relax time, personal hygiene Strict lockdowns returned China new Zealand nearly back normal. Done several weeks contact trace prevent large scale spread “no politics” rule prevent political discussion ruining chat. political discussion mean anything center far left right. Far left political discussion tolerated observations. think that. president can't unilaterally hold money Congress appropriated.

Am correct? think you’re confusing order magnitude times. Order magnitude means 10x, “two orders magnitude” would mean 100x, “5 orders magnitude” means 100,000x. 
Clearly Covid 5 orders magnitude worse flu, every single person earth would dead now. 
Current estimate IFR put 6x worse avg flu per infection. unclear many people contract Covid vs avg flu.

New side hustle giving vpn address rural guys appear working expensive suburbs. vaccines accomplish? already DeSatan, better *Despite this, people refused acknowledge essential workers treated like disposable plastic, non-essential workers, especially management executive levels, gained status.* strenuous exercise masks

I feel like I’m living dystopian sci movie I'm you, wear times. ears hurt, glasses fogged, breath stinks I'm sure concentration little lower usual couple hours. benefit work questionable since take eating drinking, greatly increasing exposure. 
 
Sure, deal year. people try impose masks longer that, people go mental. tell want, wearing masks years overall doubtful impact going work. either get rid pandemic somehow suck way. I'm going live decades come. No, disagree. Paranoids call strict lockdowns likely simply ignored.

Denialists get virus endanger others. Fuck religion entitlement. typically rides bus? people want hurt. can’t force people stop going work continue education think shutting everything best option.

Apparently, can. Things may happen opposite wish would happen, that's catastrophes work.

But sorry feeling scared angry, etc. are. idea.

Would feel better lockdown money you? every person U.S. got, say, $5000 stay strictly home 3 weeks. Would kind plan work you? No, leadership repeatedly refused treat us like kindergarten. proving wrong put much faith us. NL kind thing..they coined ""intelligent lockdown"" ""controlled infection"" something..but pretty loose restrictions early January, *many* acquaintances got hit ""weird"" illnesses included flu like symptoms, extreme tiredness, pneumonia, loss taste.

I heard single study done trace people, find whether we're proven resistant COVID. guess Facebook’s point view, stupid people tougher time distinguishing ads actual content, stupid people generate way revenue. deplatforming groups filled stupid people bad business decision view. guess false hope better hope there.

HYPOTHESIS governor sucks. harshest restrictions country reason. People inevitably going get virus anyways. losses livelihoods small businesses nothing. get students.  Contact tracing one case takes while. imagine 900 cases day government cuts funding expects keep demands. time get case, already lagging days behind, causing cases trace initial one. way: BionTech CureVac (both German RNA/Biotech companies) longer business Moderna. Well, makes sense....however, fail point obvious. already waiting since March 1 and, time, treatments brough perceived (and real) mortality 10X. perhaps 1/2 1%. 

I patient person and, started, said ""I'll give year"". - point asking matter discussed. hope best plan worst!

If may ask, - exactly would line basic shoes? Healthy, vegetarian, active, never hospital life - 67 years old - current calc take blood work, etc. account give .6% mortality.

So, one year mark - March, 2020 - together brings risk .3%, ""sane"" stop lockdown? know going go zero even close seniors (it already close 50 healthy).

It's hard question - let's pretend rosy.

Keep mind SPA thinking WOULD basic stuff proven work (for price!) could even sign experimental treatments even vaccine desired. yet another benefit since normal scheme things may access.

In one scenario here, I'd pay $50K month...the idea SPA patients would get better almost treatment extra profit made could help costly patients.

I still amazed spoken of. sane idea than, example, buying 10,000 rounds hi power ammo stocking assault weapons - yet 10's thousands people seem think logical way. It’s parallel universe here, face melting I’ve stepped bizarro no-social-distancing world. I’m upset return Melbourne next week New account, think joined back February? remember watching vids back January. Info limited back Worldometer redistributed cases date death rather death reporting Argentina correction last week. 

But numbers week according day reporting.

So huge gap curve reporting artifact filled future.

Biden, me, like flashlight dying battery going long hike woods. I've angry past 6+ months. people live still masking up, still taking seriously. issue is, cannot monitor control them, either let thing whoever running get decide bullshit spew control *you* get decide bullshit spew. principal’s announcement alarmed school families, though evidence linking school infections White House event. White House official spoke condition anonymity discuss sensitive health matters said Barrett’s children tested negative, never showed symptoms kept school revelations attended White House ceremonies tested positive. First thing noticed thought. Fuck, brain desperate literally anything pandemic shit. baller ass outfit. Trump trying kill many Americans possible. cannot anything else. He's traitor. Vote out. contract funeral parlours something??? find they’re making money dead bodies surprised point. “The approach task force taken mask mandate is, response New York City different Montana, Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said official asked identified permission discuss matter. “Local state authorities need determine best approach responsive effort depending coronavirus impacting area.” would considered metadrama. comment targets users uncivil rules sub.

The best route address situations like contact mod team via mod mail look take appropriate action. asthmatic who's getting bit older side, wearing masks indoor, populated spaces seems like something long time, I've started intention stopping, particularly flu season (assuming get thing control eventually) works millions Asia living close quarters, certainly work us. much contempt him. saddest day French history next Notre Dame burning down. weep guys. get 🙏 never begin Walmart, 2 $300 1 time bonuses count Easy. longer infected contagious simply still dealing effects. Something we've heard countless times. Vote incumbents. could tell lot people exhausted duration lockdown. lifted virus control people naturally let guard down. people turning huge assholes others wearing masks.

Which especially weird me. people miss devoid merit is?

Being asshole someone else's liberty, strange way insist 'right' 'liberty'. Especially one potentially infringes others liberties (oe even life itself) clearly not.

I think encountering people huge assholes others wearing masks, rather running huge assholes. “The approach task force taken mask mandate is, response New York City different Montana, Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said official asked identified permission discuss matter. “Local state authorities need determine best approach responsive effort depending coronavirus impacting area.” big news. think one pretty good option feels like receiving end deliberate genocide. “The approach task force taken mask mandate is, response New York City different Montana, Tuscaloosa, Alabama,” said official asked identified permission discuss matter. “Local state authorities need determine best approach responsive effort depending coronavirus impacting area.” PUBLIC Transoprtion Right, don’t. one knows fool think China told us truth telling us anything near truth. 

I friend deals Chinese lot work. Last year around November commented calls people dealt China strange, people acting weird. covid even thought rest world. bam, it’s everywhere. coincidence. long 2020. Rogan name drops maynard frequently. Apparently do. Americans. That's happened. Late December/Early January. like White House want public get sick. wonder ... commercial real estate fucked, least short-term one...? country vote president voting potus vp ticket, voting party lead dozens federal agencies appointment potentially hundreds federal judges, directors military leadership. thought masturbation that. hi, sorry, uncivil comment? think unlikely HCQ provides significant benefit, also important understand limitations study. HCQ case given hospitalized patients already fairly far along disease. general, antiviral drugs work stage, since usually point body mounted immune response, virus much problem immune response, damage virus already done. went back infected people PENTAGON. POTUS actually infected top leadership responsible keeping country safe! Putin must laughing sleeve. course did. probably day started Wuhan. around 10,000 people flew Wuhan points across globe daily pre pandemic. Another reason nominee (🤮) needs quarantine get tested.   understand comment. ""hang out"" Joe Rogan? referring podcast *last summer*? Duh. 200iq enjoy 3rd world People hate told do, even it’s good them. movie naïve idea federal government could competent helpful. basis proof date - millions people.

BUT, agree add TIME - check 3 months 3 months on.

But zero basis. 

But, again, zero basis say vaccine effective - exist within couple years since 4 years soonest past history many vaccines. 

One add odds scenarios together- use fuzzy logic situation make determinations.

Remember, discussion endanger others. makes much different even accidentally get virus (my way better - put others danger).

We cannot pretend everything same...in way. largest odds going - maybe even agree - given vaccine improved treatments perhaps return healthy populace (less obesity, diabetes) cut IFR 70 levels flu...which consider background (.1%). Right .5% among populations probably already .2% among healthy certain age. 

There hardly chance mortality bring brought much lower that. case, ""line""? Even self-infected still get vaccines couple years keep immunity up. 

I hope sound complicated? might come down, me, whether want wait 2 years .25% mortality (given age) take shot .5% mortality. difference Lord, Science Reason drew line .3 said ""well, cool"". 

What happened happened due complete failure leadership citizens. use numbers going forward - one, let alone WHO, CDC body, says IFR going anywhere near going forward - see already. Even unhealthy Florida, less 2% confirmed case fatality rate means .4% IFR due vast numbers cases (over 4 million) total including unconfirmed. 

I think many people either looking measuring backwards (at happened) optimistic might happen going forward. 

It's one tough situations people would rather face - like women perfect breasts completely removed find gene. Missouri loves company unpopular opinion seems. trend companies permanently closing office horrible idea. know specific article doesnt state permanent office closure happening many places.

 company permanently closes office people benefit saving money rent / office. reason this. saving money, ultimately paying now? are. designate spot home work, would wise free. Also, know lot people rented second bedrooms lacking income. tax write offs negligable this, $1000 -$2000 dollars companies giving home office laughable. 

Also, extends hiring pool companies. longer offie, hire anywhere. complain painful inteview processes, wait literally anyone apply job. Joe Shmo atlantic canada competing Timmy UCLA million dollar start up. not, last two weeks September got data.

That's good news. I'm still dietitian see Covid-19 like fire take strikes match really get going. Many places outbreaks did. always tried figure fact everyone hypothesis. ""What changed?"" always ask, truth really know.  Philly here, too. Heard well people. really wanting go back home/ work life balance boss knows home. “Oh, isn’t commuting anymore time” ""We'll back normal Christmas."" - BJ months ago. keep thinking about. cannot wait tell all’s come out. thing absolutely exploding.....holy SHIT getting bad again. feeling going around long time. also, vaccine mean eradicated. means risk getting gets lower. 

people dont help also. continually going out, getting ""fatigue"" following rules shit. WOW one trying live dusty ass mormons utah lol. Maybe would understand said colorado somewhere cool laughable suggest we're biting bit move utah lol would lot people reporting eye issues virus. 1 case make headline ""corona infect eyes"" little silly. already know rubbing eye infected hand give it.. TIL there's center public integrity. Great rule. mean season soon anyway better focus health. don’t give fuck honest Biden, fucking vote don’t put opinion Biden. would best option.  Yeah, like increased July surge anything.......... parents lost businesses, incomes, dignity provide family, entire way life. It’s easy reduce one sided take name COVID safety, see bigger picture many families support going back school balanced way life.  look smart now. Maybe wear ankle monitors put immigrants. vaccine... would read don’t care. saw called anti-masker. 

A person wears masks anti-mask? 

If I’m okay abortion say think avoided pro-life? Good! Argue him? reccomend either. **explaining** they're something goes long way. I've using (much atrophied) skills former elementary teacher reason kids need produce (dumb, say part loud) worksheets. 

""Your teacher needs evidence trying learn. evidence guarantees job. Let's best show we're something home.""

Does work every time? No. Sometimes get sidetracked talking either kid would rather do. goes long way. 

For OP, yet it, reccomend book ""How Talk Kids Listen, Listen Kids Talk"". tool every parent's toolbox. B claim excess deaths virus-caused. Collateral deaths pandemic-caused virus-related though. 

What claim excess deaths best estimate covid-caused deaths have.

Off topic, positive comment chain. Normally impossible discussions without simply resorting politics. Everyone sub wants believe deaths covid-caused prove right, every Russian account wants believe lockdown-caused show bad lockdowns are. end there's usually compromise Russian account gets /r/coronavirus member agree certainly excess deaths caused lockdowns. evidence, frankly, none (lockdowns short prevent healthcare deficit, cause one).

There ""truth"" here, since even trying find can't ""wait"" it. adjust beliefs data comes in. that, deaths collateral, preventable - means fact (as society) even looking answer could directly killing people.

I believe overdose deaths may increasing rapidly. know get numbers this. considered Europe? can't find data European Union excluding UK. Anyone know can? Worldometer nearly 220,000. gives? They're already spreading rumors REGN-COV2 equating HCQ.... US Russian Presidents keep pushing unproven vaccines castrated drug-regulation agencies public health guidelines, expect even chaos. like vaccines could become ""poisoned apple"". They'll beg money EU, like Italy. didn’t mean offend you. Europe major second wave need lockdown. dont think so, look increase/trajectory last days. really bad :( Damn that’s entire population state right *some much higher absolutely insane calculation. 

No, it’s not. Reread assume literally everyone dies year, died covid, get 11.69x official count. 

That’s exactly wrote. means “maximum estimate.” calculating maximum value estimate could be. said room COVID estimate account 11.69x current death toll. You, hand, saying wasn’t even enough death account estimate high, ever really said 2x 3x, maybe higher latent/long-term symptoms prove issue.  terrible way figure real error bars could reasonably be. real upper limit number calculated earlier (390,000) reach end year.

It’s rough, goal, calculating upper bounds estimate, much better calculation. better calculation would actually similar estimate flu estimate similar methodology similar goals compare happening. See above. likely tens thousands, chances hundreds thousands unaccounted deaths vanishingly small. enough excess deaths year true.

It’s happening speak every time COVID infects someone increases chances ultimately shortened lifespan number damaging effects COVID beginning understand. flu estimate compared raw death I’m comparing two numbers. I’m comparing number additional deaths occurred year covid, estimated excess deaths, vs estimated number flu related deaths per CDC.

Excess deaths decent measurement use here, may better indicator actual covid death count, **it doesn’t make comparison flu estimate valid.** suffers exact problems. still raw death count doesn’t capture true death toll virus, entire burden disease like flu estimate attempts do. take long term factors account like flu estimate does. flu estimate factors whole lot deaths this. That’s lot it’s ~5x number actual deaths, evidence it’s probably ultimately contributing lot deaths doctors realize based scientific analysis. still comparing excess deaths actual influenza deaths. funniest comment ever seen. 

“This one takes seriously, stranger internet!!” break church. continually warned virus. wash hands avoid virus, bacteria germs. stay home flu etc. Covid19 different. virus. trust God germs? hypocritical presumptuous covid 19. Pastors congregants getting infected dying churches spreading communities. you’re totally right. think someone downvoted didn’t say wouldn’t gotten comment made feel better. I’m one people plan avoid vaccine. ty that.

A lot software developers gone open office plan places LOUD. working home, everyone basically private office, relatively private office.

This much harder kids, spouse want around 24/7; but, adaptations need made different people easier commute.

It's also worth remembering United States, people commuting hour direction day unheard of. need anything like that. give fuck life leave goddamn alone. agree impossible completely shutdown interstate travel?

Left Right... two sides retarded coin sucks Broadway probably can't afford either small audiences false starts. There's lead time putting production gets canceled that's lot money drain. Pushing release date production back domino effect delays productions. That's _reported_ deaths, deaths last 7 days. actual data: please filter Date Death october sum ""Death due illness"" column. 37 total October.

edit: total deaths change 7 37. (or 4/day) Definitely. remember sub going crazy stuff. I’m glad treatments different second wave scaring fuck world likely cause thousand less births year. Yes Also free helicopter rides!

Tally ho!  Event 201, else? What’s % hospitalization rate age group? legit pure insanity paywalled? Depends live, daily activities are. Another thing consider leaving might better taking putting back time time (less touching face) need proof Trump administration actively preventing federal agencies jobs protecting safeguarding American people virus? Negligence. Endangerment. Insanity.

I'm sick shit. vote matters US. truth upvote it. idea jobs financial security safe practices necessary control virus odds. Don’t buy it. It’s Florida trying win stupidest leadership ever award. far STRONG lead rest entire world. still tested positive well enough leave hospital Yeah, China lied numbers, know. /s beefed up.

Article wrong. Max ICU capacity around 12k France. 
We 7k people ICU April, article states max capacity 6k lol... incentive large company like Pfizer develop bad vaccine. One people developing candidates two problems developed Pfizer would finished. one would trust buy products ever again.  going send national guard guy tried get bus without mask? would better handled local police. I’m saying since u taking useless measures still survived, u could actually done nothing different fine. virus bad. It’s cold. u wear bandana u social distanced? U trying stop asymptomatic spread yourself? Covid cant get u grocery store? u get food? U didn’t get virus reason didn’t get virus. It’s scam. know one gotten sick corona. hang whatever want. masks, hugging, handshakes, sharing drinks smokes. fine yet u think reason fine mask? Lol Makes wonder Germany help ICU beds then? Lol get flu pretty sick days

Most people flu three quarters infected asymptomatic. proportions vary significantly seasonal pandemic Cause convince followers go firm science, make anything. Germans may remember namentlich.de :). Sweden problem COVID survival rate. rapidity spread. two diseases survival rate - say, 90% - one infects 10 people infects 1000 people, first disease kill 1 person second kill 100. know survival rate COVID sure yet, arguing pretty high misses point. people side stick even worse

Sorry, no. may people like, worse precaution deniers. Precaution deniers selfish, anti-social unpatriotic people allow fellow Americans die horrible deaths. pretty hard find anybody lower that.

Can people get lower? yes! can! careless deplorable people blaming careful people conscientious people world's catastrophe. 

How nauseating low bums go? Watch see. Exercise, exercise, exercise

I went breath pain legs minutes jogging, results years sedentary lifestyle, able jog 12 km 90 min without taking single break. Never felt better life. Hoping break 15 km soon. reputation possibly ""the company beat coronavirus"", none companies anywhere world making real money vaccine (at least current active pandemic). Like example, Moderna day said patenting Hasidic Jews feel like unfairly targeted month lockdown see video news hundreds sandwiched together streets NYC funeral. smarter that. fine. live Florida traveling work quite bit. take precautions. know that. im saying is....this thing going around long time think. slow killer   right though extra attention hurting every day. he's gotta make massive turn win acting like he's already lead.

your last line key. billions dollars free media can't figure something better cater ever decreasing base.

his base love anti-debate grandstanding moderates, independents, undecided voters? Dr Hackenbush among signers? office, badly sick flu fever, see doctor get sick note, instead coming work; true even COVID thing. Get ready restrictions... think social media allows people get echo chambers amplify/spread misinformation intentionally not.  People inhabiting cognitions realities strong emotional overlay. tend ask source, stand benefit importantly quality validity evidence. don’t. Japan, country total 1623 COVID deaths right now? Really? 
More flu related deaths might related Japan elderly, densely populated. 
Regarding COVID they’re definitely better US. keep masking winter they’ll likely much easier flu season. Bars opened back 50% capacity 2 weeks ago. noticeable spike? way sub acting going ""bodies lying streets"" Florida now. You’re right. It’s across board. Midwest getting hit particularly hard right now. Great answer. 

This highlights things. State power vs federal power core republican vs democrat belief systems. you’re seeing is, per party ethos, delegation authority state level, eschewing large govt/federal mandates. American pharmaceutical companies make money? sure people seem get upset Orthodox Jews known spread virus blatantly ignoring rules times worldwide virus spread religious people blatantly ignoring rules.

honestly, probably blatant antisemitism. trying find state representative earlier year blamed jews ""dirty"" immigrants something along lines. ridiculous. unfortunately able find one specifically. “Sweden one elderly hostile countries world. Move 18, years later hide disabled parents nursing home never visit.”

You still don’t source Swedes move 18 20 put elderly parents homes never visit? I’m mostly interested many 40 year olds put nursing homes. I’m really interested. I'm saying happening every else higher population density, possible health care reason, many get flu jab. There’s alot different factors. that’s gross generalisation Japan. 

Your article mentions nothing mask reasons. Plus it’s 2 years ago pertaining Covid. Never go see Dr Acula, suck blood neck! Dr Fauci might get fired job. stores mask compliance almost 100 %, I‘ve recently gym, bars, private birthday parties ... Vast majority people wear mask entering, it‘s mask remainder evening. It‘s probably quite easy catch virus happens floating around there. shudder imagine walking among many people Liberal mp pretty loosy goosy comes masks. advice, mandatory. lot people wear one. No, decissions done federal level Germany Federal Government pretty consistently careful side debate. ironic species. Easier communicate? like quicker spread rumour. Easier access information? Easier access misinformation. Read really interesting Guardian article earlier *2007* discussing we've entered new age humanity : Endarkenment. Opposite Enlightenment. feelings facts superstition business opportunity. Homeopathy available doctors. Scientists studying ""power prayer."" I've fascinated word title new Anaal Nathrakh album (which subject)

As root problem, words divorced meanings. certain leaders shamans talk alternative facts fake news little little talk mean less. much online ""discussion"" devolves empty sloganeering? Word spells create voids swallow meaning thought like black hole destroys light.

One favourite writers suggested words boundaries rival groups shamans negotiated peace. think recognised nutcases like Hannity, Carlson, Maher opinion journalists functioned like shamans used to: defining reality, could honestly discuss them. They're experts, define 'experts' acceptable. Far powerful dangerous expert.

I think last two paragraphs address root 'effective useful communication' problem. people *want* vote Reddit. One thing would mention is, Trump received zinc. scientific study one patient (myself) may may Covid-19, taking zinc (40mg) like flipping switch suspected virus.      

I noticed significant improvement 24 hours.  But, never tested, whether Covid-19 not. case anything comes along winter, supply zinc hanging around. Autumn started, wait Holidays. Remind me! 5 weeks yet, US, least. We’ve killed 211,000 Americans, (barely!!) less 100 times 2996 died 9/11 attacks. It’s related masks wearing. Everyone knows Japanese masks everywhere, come flu deaths unmasked USA? Who, rhetoric?

I'm trying snide right now, crude sophomoric response. response comes place read subject matter, &amp; perhaps see fog disinformation, volume, &amp; language.

It's probably going happen, &amp; going happen lifetimes.

FWIT: I'm ex-Army &amp; 40's. haul things big cities &amp; rural countryside. often seems like country 2 different realities &amp; worrying people like think. kind obvious bunch co-workers show work. public deserves know rapid airborne virus spreads immediate risk community. Lmao, immune? I've yet meet person think that. Also, something I've seen online. thing is, even quote article Fox News negative Trump, they'll make excuse. IE. ""Oh find article anything days,"" ""Oh, reliable source,"" ""Oh can't find anything else back up."" provide definite answer?  3) thought, least infect L1bs way out.

What I've learned past 4 years person capable anything. Check www.votesaveamerica.com . voter guide every state break propositions ballot actually make easy read. Quick breakdowns proposition means, who's against, exactly vote means. I’m doxxing anyone internet, don’t agree coddle refuse bare minimum 8 months this. Positive messaging hasn’t worked, negative messaging ineffective- don’t care. think part angry *scared* recklessly endangering others every right voice frustration.  happen everywhere I'm glad work home. Dude, fuck you? talking shit everywhere spewing Asians smarter Americans/Brits really weird. comments sound same, favor try harder. That's heavily dependant upon population density. Florida. local elementary school 5 teacher cases Monday, 25 Thursday, teacher staff 70. contact tracing 14 day quarantining students close contact. Nothing local news it, yet.

The teachers forced use vacation sick leave, school still open long term substitute teacher hired. county school board shows 57 milllion cash cash like assests, according resent Comprehensive Annual Financial Report. 

We see bad gets quickly. Aside risk elderly high mortality risk people concerned rate mutation SARS-CoV-2. looking back national reserves nurses Trump tweeted yet kind interesting. wonder he'll go ventilator. Yes hope one day find way see antibodies disappear . way tell currently antibodies? fiancé’s boss heart attack nowhere. cholesterol blood pressure fine. He’s 38. put meds blood pressure cholesterol anyway. mentioned fiancé perhaps it’s possible COVID point maybe didn’t know it. Doctors recently suspect may have. told stress. suggested see different doctor second opinion. I'm genuinely confused recent announcement best estimate 10% world's entire population got covid already. I've wondering chew piece information.

If 'wrong' calculation (confirmed deaths divided estimated infections) IFR gets 0.013% slightly higher flu. excess deaths order magnitude higher confirmed value yield much higher death rate?

On hand, many sources like one saying much deadlier flu. died covid real. either shitty job again, covid's death rate actually far flu dangerous overall contagious.

Any insights? elementary music teacher teaching ESOL home protect family. in-laws moving us end month. problem insular religious groups knowingly cause tensions surrounding communities.

They lived area 70 years, please tell issues caused surrounding communities. 

I also reading community agree actions taken head guy protests claims getting arrested Monday. idk. western countries like 'i know better deal that' ... wtf. never Lupus brief exchange Neolone TheMiracleLigament encapsulates big problem perfectly. One comment direct contradiction similar number upvotes. Masks/no masks. Lockdown/herd immunity. Etc. Merkel's decision. decision state govt Berlin. need ""hit homerun"" actual debate tries hit one grandstanding debating instead.

He's fucking president, many at-bats wants, wherever whenever wants.

Edit add: That's basically 2016, made everyone pay attention whenever wanted. attention world now, he's backed corner point can't easily capitalize that, could sign bad shape he's actually in. No, protecting minimal ammount freedom left missing anything. People spewing misinformation place. 'kids less infectious' shit made sense beginning. really say states handle covid. Brace worse come then. Russian bots t_d 

Nope. need stop right there.

**EDIT- deserve lengthy response posting deserves mature &amp; respectable response, think seeing things clearly am.**

It's bots, &amp; T_D.

This something getting fire stoked outside Russian interference while. defunct subreddit either.

Further more: last civil war? Late 1800's. would *strange* one soon, natural course *many* nation-states civil war roughly every 100 years.

It's coming. plan.

And finally; reddit, tumblr, &amp; online communities fail accept constant play occurs outside agitators countries.

And being, *never* agitate ONE SIDE. happens ""the left"" well. Go dive r/politics (a subreddit, along r/The_Dipshit, I've filtered away). think separatist &amp; eliminationist rhetoric happening left-friendly subreddits well, paying attention.

They literally fabricated control using past data, estimated future trends, compared real world data without considering confounding variables. know read study.

How Germany's case numbers looking today? masks reducing transmission 1.32% daily, Germany virus pretty Cases appear rising like rest mask mandate Europe. Let's check Sweden, pariah like similar curve. Almost seasonal. Wait. Let's check  looks like countries experience virus regardless mitigation efforts. Really? Let's run another large-scale real-life study confirm this, upcoming flu season? yet go source articles.

Putting links ya'll access easily:  positive while, I'd bet anything days hospital days 7-10 fb would get rid “share” button, would cut much crap out. remember reading value CDC site. Even lower number probably, danger ability collapse system remains, based real life experience multiple continents countries. Yeah serious cases. They’ve seen long term negative effects covid people little symptoms. make ""conservatives"" suddenly care masks: tell black guy wearing one. worries, might first person internet history admit wrong. found Maynard James Keenan Covid. said he's still feeling effects. Grammar nazi mask nazi. surprised. life must meaning yours. Hence willingness give fake ass virus. one don’t give shit about. irrational fears feelings entitlement people’s lives. I'm discussing whether Sweden could one. idea people praise Sweden reasonable measures countries similar (or even less) restrictions post-lockdown called draconian. simply double standard used trying push anti-lockdown like Australia, Argentina, South Africa, actual draconian measures look like.

Even using Australia example paint full picture. Victoria measures one argue excessive. states open, varying levels restrictions, months Like said, LOL. Small island nation middle pacific closes borders hard lockdown... we're supposed learn something it. guys nuts.  Well, let put tinfoil (but much) hat :) evidences could well lab made virus. weaponized one. Now.. never witnessed biowarfare, idea would start evolve. us think one day leader says ""it's bio war! Death xxx!"" go. no, biowarfsre, think it, would pretty much look exactly like.. now. point weapon made kill, would much manageable, end killing, reaction would occur. weapon renders economy unsustainable? That's game changer. 

Following sun Tzu, great Chinese strategist: best warrior one wins fight. Avoiding fight ultimate win. brother law “COVID Survivor” social media profiles got sick last November. walks around Los Angeles without mask insisting immunity, even though didn’t want get tested antibodies medical community advertising survivors help. evidence data crowdsourced personally? I'm supposed accept bold statement economist written 7 paragraphs opinion section crowdsourced data? 

On website ""[COVID-19 School Response updated since August 28th.

There numerous articles including one today stating [Schools Several States Withholding COVID also reports [teachers/staff fearing reporting people afraid told say things going fear school might closed down. ... they're told things unethical,"" Martin said.

In addition, lot state governments requiring schools report cases, necessitates crowdsourced dashboard. preferring instead assume gut right, examples countries definitively override actual spread US schools

I assuming gut right. comparing data credentials every study data read point. analysis sudden bastion truth 100% factual depiction ""the actual spread US schools""? Everything needs looked initially skepticism, inclines believe woman saying everything else? seems like two general camps: hypocrites defending religion Jewish practices, general population criticizes church/synagogue gatherings little virus mitigation.

Archive link: Many people understand Sweden cannot legally nationwide lockdown, resort measures. said, many people also realize Sweden taken restrictive measures because, again, thing seems matter whether countries lockdown not. locking ""bad"" locking ""good"", even though several components need place make either option failure success. South Korea Taiwan really poster children successful non-lockdown methods, Sweden. say Sweden failure, media forced idea Sweden alone lockdown.

NZ's measures may seem balanced almost anyone focuses lockdown, mere two months, right. Places like Australia, Argentina, South Africa, actual draconian measures look like. Outta sight, outta mind

For mask, got time follow rules much better masks mandatory there.

I've struggling breathe entire year now, PFTs reflect asthma. got sick virus nowhere inflamed damaged lungs. doctor able figure happened time. Apparently, big coincidence. coupled new data robust immune responses even asymptomatic cases

Where see data?

This insanity. 

Who spreading misinformation???

How months people gotten exactly wrong message relative facts are?

People generate immune response, anything foreign enters organisms

That completely irrelevant. question long immunity lasts.

With couple dozen fully documented reinfection cases already (one pass extremely high bar prove reinfection surprising many), many thousands anecdotal ones, well documented disappearance antibodies months, reinfection norm CCCs, heading towards situation massive COVID waves every year couple years. 

And yet somehow shortage people tricked believing even asymptomatic cases confer long lasting immunity...

BTW, said even immune responses even asymptomatic cases

That exact opposite seen -- antibodies lower fade faster mild asymptomatic cases.   Implying whole world relies China control virus. can't anything own. anyone actually looked dosage gave poor people study? wonder mortality group took hydroxy higher. gave enough knock horse. DAILY dosage hydroxychloroquine meant 200mg 400mg people sick enough hospital, PREVENT getting super sick. meant taken get sick enough require hospital care. decide study literally give toxic doses hydroxychloroquine already sick people. hell this... anyone going comment fact doctors literally gave doses knew toxic??? giving loading dose 800mg another 800mg 6 hours later 400 every 12 hours this. WHY??????????? company told could work home permanently too. 

Unfortunately also told would getting paid.  Asking remove political input government legislation matter bit silly.

The political input issue, issue rampant disregard facts, reasoning, science favor things like ignorance, prejudice, religious zealotry. Um. 
Facist State. People threatening violence idiots. That's mean China's government suck -- hard. also mean like Chinese culture. firsthand experience westerners lived view Chinese culture business practices rather awful. 

Criticism one thing. Racial bigotry another, especially combined misinformation willful ignorance like Malignant Narcissist-In-Chief likes display. People giving shit saying go see family holidays without major precautions. Oh also knows all. hail bill gates  Definitely.

Nobody questions mask requirement frowned upon wear one public. said, definitely cases fast loose treatment. anti-government protests like every couple weeks social distancing guidelines simply can't realistically enforced beyond mask wearing. So, things going there?

We hit 8.4k cases single day. Federal government force states enforce federal laws. refuse, send National Guard. government people China decide

They wish. Yeah, dare violate fundamental human right -- right spread deadly disease. fascism. Democrats. corona vaccine causes unexpected side effects future, Dutch government make financial contribution claims damages. apparent agreements made member states European Union pharmacists. 


According Minister Hugo de Jonge (Public Health), 'Member States offer financial compensation event claims relating, example, hidden defect vaccine known time admission'. include side-effects come light testing phase vaccine. 


The Netherlands, together member states, made deals six different pharmacists purchase millions corona vaccines. tested tens thousands test subjects worldwide. turns vaccines effective cause serious side effects, likelihood marketed beginning next year. 


Because vaccines developed lightning speed therefore long-term side effects cannot completely ruled out, summer pharmacists advocated cost-sharing cases event claims damages. all, normal vaccine research takes much longer, argued AstraZeneca top executive Ruud Dobber July year: ""This unique situation we, company, cannot take risks if, example, turns vaccine cause side effects four years' time.  

Those involved European Commission hint member states prepared this. remains unclear exactly distribution look like. However, distinction would made various pharmacists. Swedish-United Kingdom AstraZeneca, example, would better protected pharmacists wants offer corona vaccines cost price first orders. AstraZeneca, working researchers Oxford University vaccine, offered so-called safeguard clause, sounds. means certain amount, pharmacist responsible costs claims damages event unforeseen side effects. amount, member states would take costs. 


Clarification
The fact member states made agreements behind scenes shoots wrong throat case opposition party GroenLinks. GroenLinks MP Corinne Ellemeet demands clarification De Jonge: ""The pharmacists get away easily. business models fully geared profit. governments contribute claims damages? addition, something like set precedent future: put door ajar pharmacists get damage claims"".

Next week, Lower House debate issue Minister Ark, responsible medicines. Ellemeet: uncertainty remains, pharmacists question even summoned hearing Lower House. government investing millions vaccines, right openness. time, transparency also increases public confidence. secrecy grist mill vaccine skeptics"". 

Obligation secrecy
AstraZeneca states content deals confidential therefore want reveal information. De Jonge also points duty confidentiality imposed European Commission: purpose duty confidentiality twofold: one hand, serves avoid influencing negotiations producers. hand, company confidential stock market sensitive information producer exchanged negotiations. cannot become public'. 

Earlier appeared agreements considerable consequences. 2018, State Secretary Blokhuis (Public Health) set aside 5 million euros compensate people became seriously ill receiving vaccine swine flu. 

This involved Pandemrix, vaccine distributed much smaller scale intended corona vaccine. 2009, half million children Netherlands received injection vaccine. Later research showed drug may cause narcolepsy, rare sleep disorder, side effect.

Translated www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version) thinks waste time resources many studies disprove ignorant idiots keep claiming? would nice study something learn something instead trying convince morons something already know. like work acted like Corona exist even couple dudes caught it, scale country. Yikes. lot anti-markers friends/family liked point influenza covid related. Yeah...funnel web black widow spiders related to, I'm lot worried one though. get ""doctors"" say anything. Doctors used favor smoking cigarettes. I'm sure find doctors disagree set doctors. 

The data already available regard outdoor transmission. vanishingly small risk. need focus efforts elsewhere. change mask rules, less people give shit them.

Stop living denial. denying reality science lol. Sweden borders open non-EU citizens, what's point? Also, even compare NZ literally Sweden's neighbors examples.

Just fyi, Finland Norway similar travel arrangements, countries similar restrictions Sweden far lower cases/deaths. think reason is? Interesting info. Thanks. missed 3 months work Covid recently returned wearing noticeable heart monitor. coworker still miss opportunity tell Covid serious actually like flu. knows one person said bad guess thinks doctors blowing proportion? I'm long term heart monitor several CT scans Covid related issues. But, mind, flu. frustrating. men died I’m sure men general affected more. think read data women facing financial hardships comparatively. likely facing family stress, particularly working moms. likely responsible childcare home schooling many also work home. single moms. say men aren’t also affected overall changes virus may disproportionately creating stress women comparatively.  republicans actively engaging voter suppression personal responsibility? makes sense Facepalm. Make sure tell families young &amp; healthy also died. broadway actor traffic, picture health, yet died slowly couple months. look people crowd photos events like this, notice lot people far side middle age, often carrying extra pounds. blows mind would take risks like this. nurse say trending way all.

If governments guts ability actually implement *enforce* policies would work. stupid people (literally, stupid) refuse voluntarily follow facemask mandates staying home showing symptoms avoiding socializing causing controlled.

But ppl cry like snowflakes, ""Waaah, can't go anywhere, want spread virus make multi-year pandemic instead squashing sooner!"" I'm sure one people making comment I'm replying to. Women always victim, never men. Oh Bibi Netanyahu also said cant another lockdown. Thats politicians say. declining antibodies lead reinfections 4 cold coronaviruses though. prove get better either normalcy? mean normal? Sorry, philosophical questions Man, low bar set politicians. guys trump sycophant getting burned nearly four years months ago ready sacrifice everyone else's grandma covid still need hear 'his decency' I'm curious data think they're lying about.

Lower childhood cancer screening? mental health (this one obvious)

Here another top doctor know logical fallacies, probably also know cognitive dissonance. economy continues collapse public health continues worsen, cognitive dissonance taken hold things continue ignored late. quarter million people dead year compared previous years? Take fingers ears. Yes! Well, assuming it’s right you.

To preface, nursing second degree too. Since I’ve done ICU, Cardiac Cath, IR/stroke, traveled US taking contracts three, close 15 years total now. happened contract NYC COVID hit, moved Boston past peak. hanging since then, sure I’ll go next yet.

There’s good places bad, good days bad, nothing replace feeling changing someone’s life way do. get change lives every. single. day. ways folks might get twice entire lifetime. don’t thanks praise, you’ll almost never hear it. satisfies weird, fucked need deep inside help people particular way. times hear thank you? sincere, genuine, honest-to-goodness, eye-contact thank you?

And btw, think applies types healthcare, nursing. healthcare right you, there’s plenty options necessary parts larger whole contributes greater good. Finding team values (and value return) huge part day-to-day stress overall job satisfaction, especially times like these. Burnout **does** happen, happens much faster wrong role bad environment. We’re heroes, we’re people job. Hopefully, it’ll right job you, too.

Also, pay pretty good traveler fun hell strings attached, there’s too. Why? Like, outside purely political reasons...why? East Asia statistics?

That's problem, accurate information spread impact policy driven. However, there's relation politics immediately flagged. honest lot cases center south Italy pandemic hard north. Point reinfects zones hit first time might fucked terms immunity sure? I’ve read conflicting reports whether he’s still Dex.

You: know one FACT 1918 flu, therefore wrong.

Me: ???? 

You genuinely fucking dumbass. even read fight this highly contagious virus continues define daily life  always case.**

If disagree actual points article, that's valid; saying even article! never said things always way. Yeah, shit. virus speaking less year. say long lasting immunity time frame? LOL yeah, LEOs immediately ticketing people wearing facemask middle nowhere, alone empty street driving car maskless.

I Czech, there, seen that. question if. Give power abuse it. Sweden’s government socialist  Average age heavily skewed statistic use things like it’s averaged infant mortalities, means infant mortalities drag average way down. People live longer now, it’s actually 55 vs 75, people made childhood lived 60s 70s like today.

Again, treatments effective also cheap, readily available, easy administer. also didn’t exist 100 years ago. Yes, age largest factor, hospital rates covid start going noticeably 40s, go drastically every 10 year gap after. Without modern care many people get hospitalized would die would suffocate strokes/heart attacks. oxygen levels would keep dropping collapsed, etc. they’re lucky would suffer coma short duration many would die. 

I honestly believe 3-5x low end, since even hospitalized covid still 90%+ survival rate age brackets. different early even modern care, would radically different 100 years ago. unfortunately small contingent US population decided want trust science continue actively fight it. 

I still believe West East coasts secede Union, long state along North ""coast"" Canada, let Republicans run South midlands see fit.

Without liberal elite cities like NYC, Chicago, Twin Cities, LA, Portland, San Francisco, every profitable city US control, they'd failed state within year. citizens New Confederacy would love it. 

(obviously United State Liberal Elites would offer extradite non-confederates New Confederacy free) mind-boggling see someone say herd immunity work, natural otherwise.

Why? really good examples happening without vaccine medical history (or antibiotics bacterial infections). examples actually happening past? understand. Even Portugal government enforcing measures, hasn’t totally incompetent (like Spain) think measures way lax.
The head health administration said 67% new cases come weddings, baptisms, family events general.
This embarrassingly avoidable. Actually made snort-laugh, thank understand trends sub either; seems last couple months went extremely cautious maybe bit overly pessimistic strongly upvoting anti-lockdown/herd immunity posts. could posting literally point view would gotten upvotes one month mass downvotes another.

""Big pharma spend billions lobbying, we'll need consult safety criteria vaccines."" rest permanent heart lung damage think can't possibly hate more. lot people party fight good fight. need shore federal agencies 2024. Trump wreaked havoc across country. also remember head CDC got busted telling wife get Florida. Kinda like pritzker. Time reported early January bad flu season already was, track bad 2017/18. maybe COVID19 earlier, maybe bad flu season overlapping start pandemic. Like mana heaven.  assumed meant recent change specifically block contact tracing. Underfunding healthcare long issue Cons, they’re part reason little leeway letting hospital capacity stretch. 

As 4-5 day return time, ones become global issue second wave. Hopefully federal rapid test kits (27M+ think) alleviate QC, AB, ON, BC. easier relate to. Thanks! Yup, quite time ago though. Even NYC study, iirc. fuck America tall spikey fence gate  days. Loved stuff. Get flu shot everyone - it'll go long way towards helping free resources COVID Good luck interview! Fingers crossed! Yeah, could people sign waiver something. Like said I’m WI literally putting people hospital parking lots full. can’t get worse Maybe read post? article explores feasibility test, sensitivity specificity. validate they're accurate enough use, translate values use determine false positive/negative rate. 

And clarify, paper 20% results post referring to. That's talking about. control freak manager types, yes! ???

I threaten god damn person.   Pretty sad -as we’re 7 months thing.... quite sad there's [It requires almost zero sacrifice ]( ), that's much 40% Americans mask = low viral load, possibly sick
mask = higher viral load, possibly sicker usual Well that’s really sad.. think sticking jade stones help covid? 

Or need come magic stone grift people? document explains possible open societies old normal, recommendations place. Pretty sure that's plan. Right Vladimir? found really strange europe death months Spain death number went hundreds absolute zero quite quickly (in France Italy zero death almost never accomplished (I think never France Italy really rare). Spain weeks zero death... know added later really strange. One could easily think hiding death save touristic season think strange.  That's norm Taiwan Asian countries, nobody slightest problem (one reason Taiwan 500 cases). virus everywhere already. think it’s less wanted spread, saw importance political economic outcomes cost lives mean I’ve seen notsaying123 since pretty much beginning this, definitely don’t thing he’s troll. definitely troll behavior understand simple concept.

When weather specific location causes people flock indoors, cases spike. south, that’s summer. north, that’s winter. isn’t complicated. Im sorry. done. DC plan enforcing dumbass mandate? Trump going start withholding stimulus checks government funding states want go along little charade he's busy thinking 2020 bag?  movie Outbreak government willing firebomb city

Sort like Manhattan movie Cloverfield. fucking virus right think they'll asking advice damn thing Hear one starving Vietnam contained virus. 40% Americans, trumpanzee, shit brains.

this change election. [Trump symptom. ]( ) End 2021 dumb move everybody thinks make difference. IMO year unique many people (myself included) really think either option great. year year lot people believe either them. 

I completely understand mindset ""we can't another 4 years shit"" believe agree that. point make stand say people can't lumped 2 groups. best chance I've seen make reality 25 years living people sick status quo. guess like putin said.

trump accurate understanding appease audience votes him, make continue vote him. Good analogy I've heard recently elections like public transport, bus going take exactly want go gets closer want be.


A past prime minister Ireland told story voter asked like irish system parliamentary elections (proportional representation, vote 1 preferred candidate, 2 next preference etc.) replied loved allowed vote one particular party, would count number candidates give lowest votes candidates party rest alphabetically. 

My point even enthused idea Biden presidency still clear conscience vote supporter act Trump. choices lesser two evils. stupid phrase. Everyone least tiny bit ""evil."" think right. Looks like show March 11th, originally thinking Thursday 12th. recall seeing pair Tool band members Blazer game 10th. CDC power mandate masks like hell this? 

They could taken pressure governors everyone else.

If White House ride CDC mandating masks CDC power. 

Gawd, head feels like going explode trying follow figure stuff out. already over. WFH great people living big house / apartment. spouse need talk meetings throughout day (noisy other), 2 kids, also studying home, playing games friends using voice phone calls whole day. 2 bedroom 1000 sqft apartment. Pretty miserable. 

My friend lives 5000 sqft house parents office room (separate bedroom) like 500 sqft, he’s great time. happens it’s wife, living small downtown 1 bedder that’s 500 sqft? Isnt it...I firefighter/medic going lay people cut everyones pay 10%.... 😃 yay!! half france red zone. invent ""no really red zones"" deal control is.

You can't claim control till real contact tracing EVERY case. People really need accept there’s guarantee we’ll ever get vaccine. ones final testing could end duds, could find long-term side effects don’t notice first whole process rushed politicized. 🙄 Oh yeah, remember Pence talked Obama completely bungled H1N1 response alternate reality world virus completely different killed millions people Obama Maybe Trump feels like get big numbers like boss.  boss always encourages better him.  many get online. CanadianFavourites.com *Laughs US* Gotta pump numbers rookie. Never let good crisis go waste.  that, play? Damn even say anything U sure US rise non challenge Good, better chance dying q car accident covid, average age death 80 Lets Bang it! say based number new cases (e.g., 100K new cases today), corroborated anecdotes several colleagues work Europe (based Italy, Germany, Switzerland, Belgium). Jesus Christ, that’s best could come with? Congrats America, outplayed, time die. needs Iran kill you. Wow That’s stupid study **speculated** Covid then. sososososo stupid -.- guess czechs took covid back :D Right? Imagine get infected covid... europe ya. Smug slow. *""How get fired dummies""* trash article. claim drug ""cure"" simply little information it. Well, that's second grade logical mistake - fact, enough information let conclude one way another. can't say whether cure not.

Also, author cared read results study, would see results positive, especially among patients high viral levels antibodies eliminated 99% viral load. I'm french yes people stupid too. Daily Mail: Coronavirus UK: Deputy chief medical officer warns Britain back daily mail publishes graph showing covid deaths Vs flu **AND** pneumonia..... 

And title graph ""Covid Vs Flu""

It makes fucking blood boil.

Pneumonia deaths **NOT** thing flu deaths. Flu kills 20 times less figures. Covid killed 3 times flu, killed three times **flu pneumonia"". deadly pneumonias **bacterial** I.e. nothing whatsoever flu.

It's killed around 50x number flu. bad speculation. Historically, infectious disease vaccine made phase 3 trials 85% chance success. currently 11 Covid vaccine candidates made phase 3. odds 11 fail roughly 0.0000004%. bad speculation. slightest. Please stop dismissing people's experience something experienced yourself. people seem understand this. makes want bang head wall. like refuse believe anything done anything they've actually seen horrific disaster happen eyes. can't grasp taking action prevent disaster means disaster happen. see many people complaining hardly anyone really died hospitals really overwhelmed, need lockdowns? answer is, reason many people died hospitals completely overwhelmed lockdowns. cannot compute. weird. Extreme measures Prague outbreak. bad speculation. bad speculation. Writing Italy, masks mandatory almost everywhere: Americans, ashamed yourselves. you. ""new normal"" Yeah, wouldn’t want situation improving means. /s Germany, people sometimes use masks shopping public transport. Spain quite good this, well South Korea, judging CCTV YT ""Walking downtown ..."" videos.

While masks effective, controlling personal meetings messaging counts government weak TTI well Vietnam, China, Taiwan South Korea. democratic socialist nations mean? 1.Ontario Canada

2.Canada better virtually every metric countries Europe People listened quarantine now? care, I'm saying people gouv. Wuhan hard lockdown 76 days, contact traced super aggressively months afterward, *still* found 300 asymptomatic cases swabbed entire population city May. always people cannot perfect isolation, like hospital nurses, Wuhan's case grocery delivery staff (they distribute food hand, banned grocery shopping. allowed exit home pick grocery delivery) case, army police. shit stupid. literally start yelling mom b/c legitimately believed covid Dec.. Like even possible???? Fuck shit. STL, MO. map COVID Missouri could laid directly electoral map reveal color areas exploding. this. Also zync. ivory tower drivel disregarding economics 101. Good point. Although snowy states least northeast, first spikes early on. I'm hoping trust remember flatten curve again. True unless COVID hot spot constantly meeting people, still low risk. 

I believe trying reduce exposure COVID sometimes gets much. understand underlying health issues, may need take extra steps personally like look cost benefit ratio. Walking uncrowded street without mask risky. anymore! Well doctored. He'll likely get ""other honorable"" (OTH). Kind thing instantly disqualified benefits. man really idea talking about. He’s fucking dangerous seems obvious us, recurrent trope working home save world. office workers seem miss 60% US work force working class jobs, show person get paid. If, instead ""employees"", headline said ""some employees"", would closely represented real world. come on. Wouldn’t hot spots much prevalent even remotely true? NL literally country Europe I've require masks doors. absolute bunkers. [So much ""old normal Christmas"", guess. distancing, masks, blah blah supposed listen *scientists*, *politicians*! politicians *never* know much pandemic virus scientists do. 

And make *really* unrealistic chimerical promises keep morale compliance public high, ""15 days stop spread"", ""next year better"", ""we return normal (whatever date)"" (in case, Christmas). scientists long agreed upon accepted *fact* no, *will* take much longer two weeks; yes, things *will* still end getting cancelled 2021 well (Coachella, BlizzCon, Broadway, name it); *no*, *not* returning ""old normal"".

OCS put best, emphasizing even vaccine *seems* over, *not* ""going back brunch"" pretending COVID-19 eradicated. be. Russia saw highest single-day spike yesterday, even *with* vaccine EUA.

If politicians primary source COVID-19 information, *seriously* recommend find *more qualified* experts listen to. *almost definitely* going shift goalposts. course will; they're *politicians*! Yes, might seem like scientists also that, least *they* forgiven, they're dealing constantly evolving novel disease pandemic situation. message might always pleasant (which partly responsible many common folk ignoring them), say tends objective, consistent, reliable, less partisan biased, politicians say. 

And so, listen *science*, *politics*. greatly ashamed self tell *the members Coronavirus sub*, people. important. dosages far recommended ones medicine.

I think it’s really terrible study think knew disturbing. mean must right? doctor nurse database “recommended doses” medicines, go unprofessional. Odd. live Denmark I’m Swedish. I’ve seen articles/interviews well press conferences. mentioned even Aarhus Odense outbreaks. 

For record, I’m saying blame testing. say bring ONE reasons, Sweden does. /r/JustBootThings Fuck amazon. I'm Kansas.

Every single frontrunner Western countries nothing positive results far regards efficacy safety. evidence today, microscopically unlikely we'll never get vaccine even worth talking anymore. Quick 2 years. yes, likely lives would've saved ways. Stupid =/= complicated. Well, god damn it. Trump's going way kill us all! Meanwhile, doesnt ever occur base dying too? ""Only losers. like losers."" arbitrary milestone good comment gaslighting dr fauci. 

Huh? spoken word Fauci, ever. old age put risk group must mean obese old people gonna die covid trump didn’t cHeCkMaTe LIbtARdS”

I guess panties bunch Trump got infection Fauci scared death of, barely sniffle it, like he's saying along. must really suck you.  Bottom line is, work employer forces share space people suspect thinking covid joke like flu wear mask even going give 50 percent safety wearing one all. people seem oppose masks think people wearing believe make immune- case experience - better nothing. maskless indoor gathering, even quick screening COVID-19, caused super spreader event. They're relatively rare places currently restrictions kind ignorant behavior. get degrees Universities person hiring would never know online. Oregon State University, reputable college, distance learning degrees majors nothing different paperwork would suggest person online opposed hybrid campus situation. situation least last decade. woman forced give career step sacrifice. Let's honest, lot women choice. Especially majority fathers can't bothered even bare minimum childcare. 

Giving career sacrifice. Also, everyone working right ""risking health."" Stop couples people working remotely full time, 28 percent women 19 percent men said working less 20 percent men say fully mostly responsible tasks lockdown. around 2 percent women Fathers don’t necessarily agree — nearly half children 12 report spending time spouse — 3 percent women say spouse more. Eighty percent mothers say spend time it.

A lot women choice. step up. plenty studies prove this. there's one thing I'm bullish flu season. Flu nearly contagious, Covid spreading exponentially say, R number 1.3 (about normal, fully open society rate flu flu season), flu outbreaks cut substantially even certain amount people following guidelines relative lack large gatherings compared normal seasons.

I think winter might bring Covid peaks surpassing spring though. Here's hoping No, that's ridiculous offensive interpretation said!

This rabbi ignored health department regulations governor's lawful orders enacted way protect populace deadly, highly communicable global pandemic. violated lawful mandates endangered lives--not followers, also lives anyone individuals interact with. predominantly insular community, many members still travel around city--they could infect thousands. nothing equate ""rounding Jews""--it insisting rabbi followers adhere rules apply citizens.

And Jew whose family rounded killed Jewish, statement offensive strongly recommend adjust way throw around miss-apply false equivalencies!!!! EU countries closed borders 3? months first lockdown, possible. Certainly non-essential travel (particularly tourism) cease overnight. Freight continue special protocols e.g. swapping trailers borders. knowledge work need face face interactions, teleconferencing take slack.

The EU could (and should) completely sealed borders outside world, closing internal borders cases reached zero two neighbouring members - Australia done.

Of course, none easy, would cause great hardship many. point NZ's example less exactly (obviously island helps enormously) - absolutely uncompromising it. don’t agree interpretation all, agree “experts” frowning upon general public wanting know things get back normal. 

Dr. Fauci least attempted relay timelines things return normal, based current information. American people right know information.

For Tsipursky completely dismiss question entirely would equivalent judge sentencing someone serve time prison disclose length sentence. get complicated. 90% states “red” states. saying.... way wrong. almost misinformed topic. vaccine Covid-19 WAY bigger deal HIV. get wrong, HIV vaccine would sweet. Yeah isn’t really currently based information available us now. view like relatively unfounded. 

The demand normality observable right now. devastations people’s lives. simply don’t think enough people would cooperate care point. money bail every industry that’s danger going bankrupt. That’s millions jobs permanently gone. know people don’t like point made fact matter governments afford continue regulations long. aren’t gunna it. Also vaccine available vulnerable populations would drastically cut hospitalizations base evaluating restrictions necessary, alone would game changer, never mind vaccine “ widely” available often talking pheasants? I'm interested life Pretty much. Holy shit, going there? dont need completely shut borders. hust able operate safety mind. sub loves exceptions rule. Like EVERYWHERE  WANT repeat myself, guess since ignored antibiotics treat pnumonia caused. right would made huge difference. steroids treat cytokin storms took lot young adults? Good, safe IV fluids treat dehydration. Supplemental oxygen. Tamiflu, want, lets add would quick vaccine super-dangerous flu today. Many supermarkets U.S. too, example 7-9 local grocery designated seniors 65+ years old. one lowest infection rates (by U.S. standards; 1 105) maybe contributing. Almost good comment gaslighting dr fauci. 

“Obesity old age put risk group must mean obese old people gonna die covid trump didn’t cHeCkMaTe LIbtARdS”


Have great day keep fighting (bad) fight. wrong mate. cures lot diseases deadly. Bacteria infections serious thing past, effective cure antibiotics. treatments malaria. knowledge limited lay person. narrative maybe experiences?
Also nrw see people nose public transport every time take ride. Especially train also bus Something tells one third 7billion world population catches it, people still act recklessly wear mask. It’s pathetic, really. That’s insane. Stay safe narrative maybe experiences?
Also nrw see people nose public transport every time take ride. Especially train also bus long post countered 'China it' NZ

I know brought China working template. NZ.

It makes apparent combination people's priorities government's priorities.

Countries get there, prioritize and... act.

Another viewpoint: countries dont embrace coronavirus getting fucked it. 

Respect enemy Yes, and? viruses vaccine possible. guess never looked HIV vaccine, attempts creating Coronavirus vaccine failed catastrophically, likely little insight here. heard phrase ""women children first""?

If world followed logic, Titanic's rescue boats would equal distribution ages gender even means leaving pregnant women kids die horribly deaths.

Some lives, according health policies safety protocols indeed valuable others. Ever heard word triage? Two wounded civilians enter ICU room time resources save one. One 82 one 15, one think doctors make CHOICE save? ""The party told reject evidence eyes ears. final, essential command."" 150k, least. 135k. US highest 75k, July, remember correctly.  Total Indian population: 1.353 billion

Population article belonging news agency Pakistan(and know Pakistan India bosom buddies 😂) says access toilets: 732 million, aka half total Indian population.

Yep. Totally right. responded wrong comment. apology!

Anyway, there's lots reports ongoing illness damage. know long-term issues yet gotten long-term. things take (do know show asbestos causes cancer? Yeah, takes show up) staying home much possible (assuming care) walking past without mask would still negligible chance infecting assuming contagious (another negligible chance).

That whole lot assuming people things required to. easier safer fix rules rely selfish asshole following spirit law instead random people street source significant number cases.

And country detailed enough contract tracing able make claim? friendly warning: point conclusion headline illogical downvoted oblivion mods remove post (see below). herd mentality strong sub. worries :) wasn’t clear topic easy one Jesus, pessimistic enough, Australia? End 2021? faith we’ll vaccine able eradicate then. primarily respiratory infections. Yes difference point can’t say it’s “nothing like flu”. It’s clearly similar flu. Yes it’s exactly same. far “nothing like flu”. 

And I’m anti Covid person. wife ED doc we’ve taking serious wearing masks etc. really is. Actual infections (at point... knows 4-12 weeks now) likely nowhere near spring peak, medical treatment much better deaths lag cases far due much higher testing detecting much earlier.

It remains seen really, saw play sun belt. Deaths may hit spring peak (continue to) rise Europe substantially. stop spamming link. enough go! Respected physicians virologists Aarhus University Hospital (publicador funded) co-authors paper provided biorxiv, bio journal server.

Antibodies signal immunity, cellular immunity take form T-cells (destroy inhibited cells) memory B-cells (the way produce antibodies). Antibodies meant fade time, can’t keep every single one we’ve ever generated Im blood stream. Memory B-cells way reproduce upon secondary challenge. Contact tracing always traced back indoor events case superspreader outdoor events locations contact tracing. burden proof would provide evidence contact tracing failing trace back locations. already said, thus far, I've seen scenario posit simulations real life. Yes, I'm sure comment done world good. older people risk though it. Anyone age high risk vulnerable health conditions etc. me, us working together turn helps me. incorrect. significant (controlling) percentage drug companies owned private equity firms trillions invested elsewhere. firms instructed drug companies control spare expense, driving interest economy back. This! This! specify margin. Covid 14X deadlier flu year, disabilities make covid worse still. league Spanish flu though, young people died within hours symptoms. also big box store feel like i’m one taking seriously one actually willing “that person” holding coworkers accountable wearing masks stage noses sales floor, avail second i’m around pull masks right back down. it’s exhausting people thought friends avoid straight rude. it’s mentally exhausting year you’re right, it’s nothing compared healthcare workers... hope gets better us soon. :(  simple that.

if 80 years old, IFR much higher 0.6%, 20 years old fatalities car crashes year COVID.  admit Sweden right? legaly could lock again, would completely destroy economy forever. probably lot instances veto against... 7% hospitalization rate way high? 10% then? Extremely high? 12% insanely high? time reach 20% adjectives describe something beyond high high high high?

Be intellectually honest second, talking percentages, anything 50% cannot be, definition, ""way high"". go! Respected physicians virologists Aarhus University Hospital (publicador funded) co-authors paper provided biorxiv, bio journal server. Agreed. high risk groups vaccinated, collective fatigue rules outweigh benefits. People starving depression, many stuck abusive households. Wonder kind store is. Saddening see many people don’t value lives. Wonder makes worth risk though. Businesses going business massive layoffs could cause possibly? contract trace random people pass street? gets close punch covid face take ar stand ground... also different symptoms, attack body different ways, infect body different ways, different severity outcomes. 

I mean, jeeze, guess include broad elements ""they viruses"" yes, similar. that's ridiculous. anti mask policies? Sweden. What's point  ""no concrete science efficacy masks...."".  

Dude, youre fucked head trying rationalize something simply isnt true. Try google. Start WHO, NIH, CDC, local university's department public health. literally dozens studies large cohorts demonstrating masks effective. Level evidence, Cochrane Reviews multiple similar studies, many smaller studies multiple multiple places conclude unequivocally WEAR FUCKING MASK. fun thing even go know fucked. bring perspective address said? refuting said or.... what? RIP 210k cancer patients killed covid Without hosting another identical event except everyone wearing masks prove anything? Yes need better that. Ah - comparing infection estimate 49MM flu cases versus confirmed cases COVID, it’s kind apples oranges. apples apples, you’d compare total infection estimates ok shoot headline. 

I agree reddit good handling disagreement. Yes get that. saying it’s “nothing like flu” pretty blatant lie. like flu many levels. 

1. viruses. 
2. similar symptoms. 
3. spread similar manners. 


I’m sitting arguing flu Covid similar mortality rate much similar different. Surprised Pikachu face Lockdown replication rate, getting 1. matter area heavily infected, light - lockdown till number going down, up. that's lightly infected area turn heavily infected area pretty quick lock sufficiently.

And calls failure reducing restrictions whilst cases still community wild. lack control keep replication rate 1, big problem pretty soon. reduce lockdown restrictions till eradicated disease keep control - matter bleating.  absolute minimum, (running outside maskless) much (~8x) safer running gym mask on.

And firing gun air far safer firing crowd. make acceptable?

Gyms open right all. Using two wrongs make right defense incredibly top that, state, don’t even need wear mask exerting gym! 

The ignorance purely harm reduction point view, encouraging gym goers exercise outside, mask off.

Put straw man away honest conversation.

All gyms closed everyone marked public. Plain state exertion “one worst things” provide source indicating actually problem.

You paying attention anything last 10 months, you?

You really cannot fathom breathing heavily could possibly put virus particles air breathing less softly?

I starting think conversation pointless began understand respiratory illnesses tried running masks hate it. 

Poor baby. used twelve hours day 120 degree flight deck. sorry hobbies changed deadly risks outdoor transmission low compared indoor, nothing indoor people present (I work alone curbside/delivery shopping), math I’m solidly problem.

And everyone makes justifications behave properly themselves. Get enough people together, shit starts getting rowdy again.

This even gotten bad place yet. Hope ready real hardships start, doubt given inability deal minor inconveniences. said world changing. way changing? No, usually need test positive COVID death certificate. flu. 

It's comparing apples apples.

It likely ""flu"" deaths people died COVID tested. insane. EU deaths 150 daily months - France likely double coming weeks. Hopefully surge rise true infection rate Mar/April (where UK, Italy, Spain France likely peaked around 100k new cases per day each) extremely concerning.

I wonder reflects seasonality coming play Europe starting cool down. surge might prove harder control Mar/April one, addition costs instability locking again.  here! number confirmed cases. 

10% world still infected US numbers much different. countries global 10%, average get 10%.

Check WHOs dashboard:  Herman **Cain** stage 4 colon cancer, likely requiring radiation chemo, well known destroy immune system. Trump doesn't. See works? ""We've tried nothing, we're ideas.""
-Gov. Doug Burgum sounds right. Unfortunately. EDIt: responding wrong comment. Wake people Uh said I'd mask ready someone approaches Noooooooo waaaaaayyyyy I'm sure subreddit concerned unhappy rising infection rates non-partisan reasons. correct, one would ever see mask outside home, inapplicable you.

As soon seen maskless, proven wrong.  bf travelled Asia came back late December. roughly Christmas Jan 2, sickest I’ve ever seen anyone, literally bed ridden struggling breathe. COVID wasn’t anyone’s radar point way know normal flu/cold. Round 2 showing ugly face already insane, visible testing overwhelmed. know many people around got sick get test slot even call believe get test slot.

Even current data, NL second worse EU behind CZ. (Taking cases/mil normalizing % positive cases) Yes does. Fuck guy mad comment earlier idk I'm getting downvoted too. People fucking stupid. study done testing people swore Feb none virus. really need ask couple things: 

How suggesting immunity short term? Based what? 

Why would natural herd immunity work? I'm suggesting pursue obviously, herd immunity herd immunity, without vaccines. mind-boggling see someone say herd immunity work, natural otherwise. can't say happen sure often difficult tell people contract it

It's difficult. trace outbreaks come live America always indoor gatherings people wearing masks party.

The evidence I've seen potential infection occurring outdoors simulations lab nothing like traced real life events.

For personal opinion think possible get infected outside hanging large gatherings outside, talking person face face directly outside extreme examples. would hard enough particles droplets pass open air otherwise. Well 4 deaths right. Nothing worry according Facebook. understanding? wear mask public people never said didn't. wear mask outdoors may meet one person two. scenario easy physically distance. 

I keep mask pocket end accidentally crowd outside. said urgent started wearing masks recently. asked would wear mask supermarket.

""Oh know, thought yet.""

What fucking idiot.  /r/covid19positive might disagree Yeah brother seem well population 100 years ago age breakdown, maybe. don’t think evidence 3-5x claim though, even countries poor medical systems high death rates per capita. factors pale comparison age. Maybe medical care reduces fatalities bit, maybe even 3x, 20 yo getting vs 80 yo reduced fatalities 1000x

And avg age 100 years ago much younger, make pretty doubtful claim you’re morbidly obese yes risk. Fuck that. part participating vaccine trial. I’m pretty sure got real deal placebo That's well stated distinction. specific Orthodox Jewish populations singled ignoring safety precautions, anti-Semitism. criticized along communities ignoring safety precautions, anti-Semitic.

FWIW, I'm sure we'll seeing lot Christian super spreader events come December. Right we're seeing consequences people ignoring safety precautions gatherings related Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur Sukkot. doubt we'll seeing Christmas related clusters December/January. well secular clusters Thanksgiving. Nut jobs different interpretation Torah find important calling life? we’re making fun people picking religion main motivation? Ok, sick!
If don’t see problem singling single religious group people consistently spewing negative rhetoric towards based personally experience, don’t think you’ve paid enough attention history. Look nazis made people hate jews, look rhetoric time periods? Jews spread disease, Jews control world, etc... TYPES RHETORIC SEE TODAY. doesn’t frighten you’re actually Jewish, don’t really know tell you. Everywhere else situation Idaho. also fraction resources US best also trying keep country fed housed. India weak currency shut actually mean economic social catastrophe. 

The US federal government actively abdicated responsibility let population suffer. Never less us economic social capacity eliminate virus reduce eliminate long term economic effects. yet get downvoted subreddit. lockdown seems politically correct idea subreddit. Lucky estranged family. way phrase makes look like see equal Fauci Offit, funny. Also, Fauci say something along lines normality coming back Q3 2021? Maybe need educated properly wear mask then. everyone wears masks properly cases plummet. Look data pretty obvious many infections, especially per capita, seen Idaho vs surrounding states.

Factor limited health care access due rural nature state, painfully obvious Idaho targeted. trouble ignoring science also brought up. Plus changed advice 3 times week... Pretty dumb. Moderation data-driven arguments censorship, scientific discourse.  true, also acknowledge non-Haredi Jews Jews. They're awful. restrictions purely behavior based like distancing masks, economically disruptive like business closures highly reduced occupancy limits? that's insane disturbing Sweden positivity rate exceeds California. Golden state's 7-day positivity 2.5% versus Sweden's 2.9%. positivity rate almost doubled 3 weeks! 6 frontline workers recovered 'weeks' ago. reinfection, reactivation, something talked virus.

Incorrect. Indian health care workers initial infection second infection viral genomes sequenced found significantly different. Yeah... try mention lot Eternal September Eternal September Looking people bigger city, going go for: stupidity sometimes veers stubbornness. Yeah man, dont want get comment deleted you-know-what! censorship tell idiot speaks fuck off. Maybe give em flair 'feelings important facts weird head'. wear masks!!! last time did, killed 50-100 million people, young adults.

Yeah, novel flu would lot less deadly today seeing first time. 

We even antibiotics treat people's pneumonia getting it. that's ONE many better treatments keeping people alive get it. Obviously need revise history. Pak shits India India shits Pak.

Pakistani ""race"". racist even work here. Go back school son. understands difference trying deceive people don’t get votes.  ears . also wear AirPods . Yeah! Unfortunately people wrote article skipped lesson straw man. bunch internet bozos put fake names pretended doctors, invalidate claims made declaration. currently filming new season. Check /r/mtvchallenge. thread season there’s even elimination list avoid one don’t want spoilers. problem online survey part. fact even mid-term effects yet.  feels like there's are, since come woodwork. hope people fence silently watch see is. Source 1 8? LA county averaging 1,000 new cases day would put hospitalizations 100 new per day (at least). 

I don’t think there’s statistic backs claim 1 8 cases need hospitalization it’s god damn shame you’re upvoted. raised Catholic go relative's wake/funeral recently another gathering honor person showed people taking seriously. felt badly there, I'm endangering myself. sent card food.

I hope I'm wrong, I'm anticipating we'll see spikes Thanksgiving Christmas/New Year's. 


Right now, we're seeing timing holidays, we'll probably seeing similar stupidity November/December. really ""that simple"". Mask compliance public close 100% yet cases still exploding Went bar last night friends. Also went mall dinner friends. 

My sorority also it’s bid day party tomorrow. I’m glad got bid. I’ve made friends fun last two weeks throughout freshman year. Next weekend one frats party. It’s going lot fun. 

It’s good stuff weekends again! I’m seriously happy. completely offensive saying trump ""strong"" ""fighter"" implying succumb virus aren't. best medical treatment world unreleased drugs. nothing ""strength "" Australia getting anywhere close 10% INFECTION hospitalization rate nation needs look inward something insanely wrong.

That would highest world massive margin.

Most US States huge case numbers (meaning caught little actual true number infections) CASE hospitalization rates 5%. “The coronavirus pandemic changed world left countless people longing pre-pandemic way life.

That desire likely straining mental health”

Literally saying “just stop thinking fucked life gotten happier” Just, Duh entirely fault certain public figures decided make covid political instead public health emergency! Bad redditor, bad! shame they, time happened, concerned limiting information spread sharing then. /s

I dont think I've independent reporting actually transpired Wuhan around peak outbreak. Im gonna google later see next one comes hold indefinetly. isn’t source Covid information, would censor everything. people voice ignored entirely. Online discourse never disappear, focus come contact every day community. solely responsible protecting family. It’s easy remove oneself situation risk exposure to, said, trash people. made fun laughed started, people wear masks distance everything January. I’m pointing nothing changed me, someone doesn’t agree, simply don’t care protect myself. Yeah they’re big feel? Facebook’s one-two punch farming every personal detail delivering tailor-made fake reality would (hopefully) hard replicate. Yeah, likely 1% beginning around 0.5% currently.  100% agree. state/the feds requiring and/or masks actually filter well? Must nice spend 14 days quarantined guess money talk matter wearing mask still get sick greatly reduces severity, linger air hours one spot matter person coughing 5 maybe even 30 minutes earlier likely still air contagious, 6 foot rule absolute horseshit indoors. outdoors low risk masks worn even relatively close quarters, dissipates really quickly. 

It also means getting sick eye infection likely thought, explains one study china 5% wearing glasses caught covid 30% without glasses caught covid. 

Don't ya wish knew things sooner? rest world knew. doctor knew. sent letter pain clinic doctor explaining needed drug tested outdoors due covid cited studies findings. public made aware would greatly impact businesses way function, instead letting people know give money businesses reformat designs safe. That's honest thought least. 

If go indoors though wearing shield plus mask massively reduces risk. theory front shield hits airborne particles protects eyes well, mask protects breathe around mask. N95 plus shields infections hospitals, n95s alone nurses something like 25% infection rate. thread say knew guy flew Seattle October last year, got really sick felt breath weeks later? little bit agree. seeing alone post makes quite valid. Regeneron made? require antibodies human blood donations, somehow produce artificially? Uhh maybe didn’t. say wasn’t true? original authors credentials valid. One even commented article. 

“Professor Bhattacharya, professor medicine Stanford University, told Sky News: ""We resources audit signature, especially given incredible interest Great Barrington Declaration drawn. unfortunate people abused trust adding false names, suppose inevitable.” I'm hearing things straight source, victims mouth. news. doctors, I'm hearing families. gossip, first hand experience people disease, experienced loved one disease, somebody directly related doctors made claims.

My aunt room severe flu symptoms, along documented proof virus. fine within weeks. yet selfish wear mask public?

Seems willing spend time put cart back minimal benefit minimum people, willing protect lives something basically free save lives.

Why human lives worth less loose carts? calling common sense face novel pandemic scientifically illiterate defense. Neither I, Netherlands need hard lock asap. fucked many ways, grassroots top down. Intelligent lockdown ass. Really? kidding? serious? fuck? I'm Jewish. I'm ""shielded antisemitism"" I'm ashamed share religion nutjobs. Pakistan? racists? hard reconcile doctors claiming masks needed compulsory outdoors, CDC claiming ""15 minute rule"" within 6 feet infected person. Based that, would think passing strangers nearly 0 risk. two guesses. One, people believe already care science another study much convince them. Two, website trash can't read entire article mobile ads formatting bullshit. (And already agreed this! Imagine someone gets made angry topic..) It’s still rise like people South Park sniff farts. Hey, polite. I'm fan Trump, 100% greenscreen. (Why would bother? could easily shot White House wanted fake something.) 

The world enough conspiracy theories need one more.

Once again: They're keyframes. They're encoded occur periodically. frequently occur, higher quality encoding (that's simplification, it'll do). Movement encoded separately, see weird distortion online videos sometimes colours get really messed up, still see characters face mess. POP! It'll correct itself. POP keyframe.

The interval seconds, consistently popping, even though background actually know good subs post to, let know. thinking since one bit politics involved it, maybe political subs would take it... got rejected pre-approved domain. correct, one would ever see mask outside, non issue. 

If someone sees maskless, wrong alone.

What complaining about? government embarrassment human race. 4 YEARS! 4 YEARS! 4 YEARS! Ooooof. One worst comments I’ve read here. Go Twitter, read something else precious Reddit thread. building anti semitism country proven increase anti Semitic hate crimes! guess non Jewish you’re easily shielded things, it’s prominent aspect life. Don’t tell fuck bc don’t want hear disssenting opinion calls little empathy understanding you’re capable of. Don’t ever tell I’m trying build anti Semitic sentiments don’t know me.

""Masks mandatory outdoors well indoors risk coming within **two metres people**, doctors urged."" wear seatbelt I'm car. I'm hike one within hundreds yards I'm going wear mask. I'll keep ready someone starts approach though Infuriating bc see NJ. Haredi filling local central NJ parks bc parks hometown closed. I'm normally xenophobic comes basic reduction sickness bets off. Worldometer nearly 220,000, explain? did, sources contradict eachother (credible sources) would people react vaccine given EUA Europe Canada November 3rd? I'm european seems new FDA guidelines push date past election based gaining public trust rather actual science. I'm saying decision wrong, seen heavily politicized? wrong first set guidelines? Nope. even close. big risk group people end interacting with. high, you? shit! Really, idea! Oh dear, Swedish nationalist apologists herd immunity fans now? Well, TBF, past two months testing 200k people daily, positivity 2.5% lower, 3,500 less people average ICU, 28,000 less hospitalizations, death per day average lowest since beginning pandemic (1,500 less peak). Well ridiculous ones are, ""medical experts"" medical experts. arrested killing lots people. 

Look homeopathic medicine decide doctors want make important decisions. 0.65% actually high fatality rate far infectious diseases level contagiousness concerned.

It's actually even much higher diseases went way create vaccines for, e.g. measles. face America! I'm surprised masks prevent spread. I'm surprised people followed mandate well stinks. mask test. That’s alma mater numbers pretty darn low face America! fall already sorted? impossible people care elderly skilled nursing facilities home. 

It's **fantasy** people have. pretend old people locked away without help young workers family members families children come home second jobs do. 

That's one done except one nursing home Sweden entire staff stayed residents 45 days March April. 

They come home families slept ate nursing home none residents got sick died period time. feasible workers length pandemic.

It's fantasy. short-lived record. mostly men dying virus, sorry feel bad worse dreams right now. doesn't, *god forbid* make one statement *a certain public figure's* failure act deliberate spread misinformation ooooh no, fucking mods come woodwork delete comment. -_- far compared peak? gotta stop whining every increase Correction: Reservations exist, never existed. Men’s lives negatively affected COVID-19 pandemic women’s lives, that's surely less important general media academia. 0.65% estimated IFR long time now? Water wet. Mine is, 10% courses needed person like Lab classes.

I 0 person classes. Yeah he's gonner sure. live (NRW) risk 150€ fine wear mask. use public transportation almost every day seen like 4-5 people wear mask since became mandatory.  encountered post fellow, paraphrased mathematician, something add up:  deaths 2018: 2.81 million  deaths 2019: 2.83 million  deaths 2020: 2.13 million  deaths last year! shutting schools??

At first thought maybe kinda dumb math.

But thought usual Nigerian Prince scam, first filter selects intelligence. Masks work! (So still keep everything closed California NY?? 🤔) That’s works... CONFIRMED CASES

We capture small number actual infections.

People understand basic concepts refrain comment. Aren’t colleges back person? feel like narrative driven bigger players that. airline industry example really hurting bad, tourist industry, hospitality industry—these represent billion dollar industries cases making majority state country’s gdp. I'm saying good answer, probably fastest solution save lives. trash people spreading dangerous, needs extinguished. see dust settles numbers dynamic. Ok, since assumption likely incorrect, everything follows assumption comment incorrect. 

I mean, started assumption everybody gets covid dies it, yeah, would 100% IFR, would helpful us? would intetesting compare descalation Spain countries. Number trackers, policy tracking, speed reopenings..... I’m frustrated one taking coronavirus seriously. live apartment basically glorified dorm, three roommates. One started showing symptoms week ago, could hear coughing time insisted allergies. got tested leave Ohio, next day told us tested positive. I’ve sharing bathroom coronavirus WEEK didn’t even think get tested right leave. One roommates still hasn’t gotten tested, boyfriend over, keep leaving go outside. saw post picture riding train yesterday. Meanwhile roommate tested negative haven’t left all. hasn’t even gotten tested yet!!!! I’m sick irresponsible people live feel like can’t even control would get coronavirus not. I’ve arguing months lockdowns isolation damaging students virus. see unable actually care people, think fascists supporting makes right. sympathy EU borders, insane US claim control borders - cases arrived air. Nobody bothered checking great stats. I’m missing section shows positivity rates found exclusively within orthodox people compared people? we’re blindly accepting numbers sample size hundred tests? aware sample size small highly likely produce flawed stats. Also statewide positivity rate still &lt;2% arbitrary marker unhappy? Don’t forget cuomo chose 1% himself. He’s hardly someone trust covid response handling. What’s difference 1% 2%? cases 2% still reasonable handle statewide? Who’s making rules reasoning behind Harassing people wrong. treated people park blocking path gently history anti-Semitism. blocked path completely took average 3-4 loud excuse pleases get through. Plus lot kids around try watch language around kids.

I would suggest leaders communities call wearing masks condemn reckless behaviors wearing masks.

And anyone harassing people way boys harassed arrested harassment. see downvoted. rightfully so, considering spouting disinformation (futile) attempts sway narrative. He's literally holding rally currently, seem problems: earth talking about? Throughout pandemic thousands people commuting back forth every single day neighbouring countries. economies interconnected totally different way NZ. Far many people mistake inconvenience oppression.   Usually ones mistake patriotism nationalism. much logic reply idiots. guy’s comparisons, mean. wars brought OP. one Newport open. city actually opened yet. live Lincoln City. Another reason union fucking scum, never ends means title incorrect.

Since ""average"" means mean.

I'm sure knew that, average/mean age sell point trying make. clearly read article. not? We're dealing public uneducated refuses listen experts anything. perfect environment propaganda work. definitely feel censorship answer. People's lives stake here. obese asthmatic men survive it. risk factors maybe take risk death Christie's age 5%, probably high.

Probability hard intuitively grasp. feels like risk factors, surely die. look numbers - even without access healthcare have, 95+% survive. OLD PEOPLE LIVES. OPEN GIVE YOUTH CHANCE. white. invalidate comment.

Not us racist assholes. us blind. us think sunshine flowers. Sometimes, sometimes, guy assess situation relationship someone actually get right, regardless skin colors involved. know life sucks sometimes people based color skin. happens Corps too. But... It's... tolerated Corps. say happen squashed known.

In experience, racist people I've ever met white. China achieved tremendous increase testing capabilities

All fever patients go hospital mandatorily tested $3-5, $18-30 RMB (with universal health insurance)

If really worried, play testing every day, still huge empty queue bars front hospital useless right now

That's pretty weird, too.

(This saw went Beijing Anzhen Hospital.) Viruses mutate.  It’s possible whatever going around fall/early winter earlier, maybe less deadly mutation virus.  loss, they're little bit self important sub. We've done nothing we're ideas. Also rich republicans take public transport much see benefit. literally they’ve saying along. doesn’t stop idiots claiming it’s “really” 0.1% lower. It’s clearly 0.5-1.0% since like early March started getting grasp many actual cases are. thing would potential kill range 1.5 million Americans. point. Perhaps tell previous attempts making vaccine coronaviruses failed? also shares many symptoms. I’m sure say “it’s nothing like flu”. shares many similarities flu. could get bad there’s possibility, NFL chief medical officer Allen Sills acknowledged Wednesday, season could paused even suspended.

Saying it’s possibility season could get suspended worst case scenario =/= NFL currently considering suspending season. Trump got almost two weeks ago, no? subreddit finally accepting .6% IFR, claim small part success, take virtual insults well randos don’t know search works.

I can't Believe I'm saying Biden win. way Harris fix country. Literally anyone sign claim doctor lol reason see many threads daily herd immunity. Yes aware. grew Bonners Ferry Idaho. family still lives there. Mostly small towns small schools. larger towns dotted throughout state...im still confused idaho? There’s red everywhere much populous spots. Yeah Soros funded posts silver bullet. never never be. Illness always requires multi-modal approach, bigger picture nature’s response humans done planet. herd isn’t thinned, it’s bombed. Every super spreader event bomb. one month delay changed social behavior consequences (masks, bars, etc) lethal aspect virus. 

It exquisitely, perfectly designed massively reduce population. majority survivors became seriously ill seriously slowed chronic heart lung issues. live fast general population uneducated understand power stupidly advanced technology use. People use denial coping mechanism ruthlessly weeded population. 

See 2021. Maybe. Depends survival instincts. guys won’t around though. haven’t COVID, experiencing lot symptoms. I’m done. conversation isn’t going anywhere. need start day I’ve already wasted two hours you. 

You suggested compare different regions world mask practices control found study found results didn’t agree with. argued grounds control made name statistical method “synthetic” refused listen. 

For record I’m young earth creationist, believe evolution. published paper two granted outside medicine willing read papers beyond abstract arguing someone. profitable actually treat every single Covid patient instead letting die parking lot they're already 150% capacity.

So herd immunity great hospital business, either. thought god would protect unbelievers yes, republican family acquaintances think divine protection. Democrat = atheist = virus protection. Idk thats GOP feels think that's message religious base holds true GOP going correct lol. Thanks clarification. many posts anecdotal reference bs study saying everyone covid. ughh much herd immunity experiment.
Remember making huge deal it? Well backfired. He's saying damage done already done could possibly prevented from, say, dying. lowering bar? don’t believe went debate etc testing positive don’t think tested symptoms didn’t seem symptoms debate. believe turned late didn’t tested though.

For Trumps medical staff would sane answer... 


If Dr. Conley knew positive rapid test allowed public waiting PCR lose medical license ASAP. Czech Republic’s “Farewell Covid” party June, thousands Prague residents dined outdoors 500-meter (yard) long table across Charles Bridge celebrate victory virus, seems painfully naive country highest per-capita infection rate continent, 398 per 100,000 residents.


/r/agedlikemilk Could thinking immune response *during* illness cause “cytokine storm”? (Yes, quite serious. medicines counter it, like steroid Trump on.)

I believe referred *after recovery*, body fight reinfection. course, historically, pharma industry flips time anyone mentions march-in rights, government basically never ever uses them.

They never have. never will. need to. many asinine law suits occur. government needs put table.


 Patents inalienable rights, bestowed society/government order grant monopolies would encourage innovation. public grant order benefit public. intent innovation. pendulum continuously swinging far, however. Instead research development scientists statisticians, loophole finder lawyers marketers. We're WWI trench warfare pharma. There's lot spending done, lot damage done, progress made. activities regulatory pathway manipulations failing move medicine forward. subverting intention patent system first place. blocking innovation better drugs. balance public good private incentive fully depressed rather evenly weighted. mention go work, see consequences Covid, clock face conspiracists saying it’s over-reaction. also spreading BS. Coachella's cancelled 2021. know they'll either April October.  already leak Jusher Kared thought “the Backstreet Boys reunion tour” would go states populations think everyone deserves rights. one contacted Backstreet Boys slow down. wanted Backstreet Boys give many concerts possible. much baby carrying mask putting passing people 'too much'? telling walk around even alone, near others put on. Unless live city, like majority people (at least US) person speculating covid, saying normal people get sick winter reason people talking global pandemic happened afterwards.

This person saying people trying make connection be. It’s shame... lost twice today. Ah ya would make sense wasn’t sure either myself. Doesn’t look like researched Brownwood paddock square congregate  No. gave promoting stuff works, like lockdowns, government inept White House crawling COVID, clearly can't trusted take care population shutdown. 

Now want people wear masks take precautions, acting like care countrymen. November 3rd. Looks like nonsense autodelete. Sorry see case, bot. 

:( Sad Panda. person needs go fucking mental ward. Yeah real, people can’t accept problems exist anywhere else. United States. mandate. recommendations late summer. data use.

You consider evidence mask efficacy. believe despite mask mandate countries seeing surges positive tests.

Mask advocates young-earth creationists point. banana proof God's design fits human hands nicely? religion people.

Given mask mandates prolific, seeing spread Europe are? course useful. see covid going community spread regions China. Now, community spread happen countries? preventative measures? That’s exactly flu vaccine 2021,people regret 2020. Even though washing hands touching patient norm three decades, still stress it. wash hands? touch glasses washed hands. Even though know washed still stress it. 

Is coughing co-worker sick seasonal allergies. 

I glad one person 200 employees caught virus. Zero would better number. Agreed, me, red flag companies. manager requires employees supervise work, one 2 problems. shitty employee shotty manager. wear mask. wear sign around neck saying ""stay far away me, I'm crazy af""  precedence use national guard / federal police squads Cities aren’t following Admin’s wishes. would different?

Can give example current administration using national guard / federal police cities enforce wishes federal laws? suggesting president use military enforce wishes - go beyond federal laws - citizens? Sounds like people idiots. capacity understand difference ""treatment"" ""cure,"" I'd imagine fewer 15 100 supporters could understand either. lol, wut

a vaccine throttle symptoms. that's works  Adapt die. Real life become Monty Python sketch people offered cake death, except people keep choosing death!

It’s like watching herd panicked animals run side cliff. survive stop step side. swept away fear choice. worked primarily home (office visit every couple months) 10 years manager, different types workers team.


1. task driven individual, enjoys working colleagues go work find friends finds company social initiatives somewhat forced, enjoy home work better.


2. Commuting even 30mins day, still means get 5 extra hours week time back. 


3. cook put together food, save lot money buying lunch probably healthier, meaning feel better time.


4. office, people inclined stop desk chat. Even business related, focused conversation takes longer. add lot less actual work production.


5. person able use technology, bunch automations speed work processes, processes work well task driven person distractions.


6. Many people affected office / department politics, perhaps bullying, unsoliticed advances general 'eugh'....this severely reduced home.


7. need dedicated office space. forced wfh, live small apartment office desk also kitchen table juggling barking dog, kids another person living space, that's working home, thats Covid19 work home 

I would say 75% staff prefer wfh, 25% like get house work different environment 100% prefer wfh rainy, snowy Friday Friday traffic city terrible, many head home lunch break wfh afternoon get enjoy weekend sooner. know Jordan Peterson tells womens fault getting properly fucked, reality ass. 

Toodles. Merkel put economy lives? mean, hospitals need business, not? shitty bot. completely missed far political start thread. NNT 86,834 identification approach exploits previously mentioned regional variation point time face masks became compulsory public transport sales shops. use data 401 German regions estimate effect public health measure development registered infections Covid-19. consider timing mandatory face masks exogenous event local population. Masks imposed local authorities outcome process population involved.2 compare Covid-19 development various regions synthetic counterparts. latter constructed weighted average control regions similar regions interest. Structural dimensions taken account include prior Covid-19 cases, demographic structure local health care system.
We indeed find strong convincing statistical support general perception public wearing face masks Jena strongly reduced number incidences. obtain synthetic control group closely follows Covid-19 trend introduction mandatory masks Jena difference Jena group large 6 April. findings indicate early introduction face masks Jena resulted reduction almost 25% cumulative number reported Covid-19 cases 20 days. drop greatest, larger 50%, age group 60 years above. results robust conduct sensitivity checks apply several placebo tests, e.g. tests pseudo-treatment effects similarly sized cities federal state Thuringia pseudo-treatment effects Jena treatment actually started. also test announcement effects. Exactly! I've calling increase police funding area get proper enforcement non mask wearers.

My neighborhood 85% POC hit hardest virus. need structure organization beat thing. truth dont like trolling.
And ask mom hemorrhoids till day hear mentioning dick. reported likely cause. going data available try provide valid argument. data going of? saying preventive efforts, matter what, useless things happen? Good argument. thirty minute walk work count one hand many people see. Im masks mandatory masks outdoors recipe people it. Yes. First off....johnny bananas villain choking piece hotdog.....well probably gave hot dog, give heimlich, one less competitor hed say. Second....its early second. fair, live Tasmania incredibly lucky case 6 months. However 10 weeks lock really ruined mental health, 6 weeks broke rules saw mum (terrible know). can't see humans expected obey restrictions Melbourne long. really hope measures pay join rest Australia. Life largely back normal Tas that's what's waiting guys strategy works out. feel like personal situation. agree needs boundaries, I'm taking random breaks day knock chores, take time occassionally knock emails random bouts productivity night. difference needs hard boundary on, ""dont expect shit x time, may get random emails feel like it"" Found guy never gotten laid before. There's seatbelts drunk driving laws enforced federally. state mask mandate, expensive. Lol couple hundred most. crowd deep like two three widescreen TVs hanging walls. two high holy days since beginning Hasidic community near appeared care preventative measures put place. last numbers saw Hasidic community near positive test rate around 28%. Meanwhile rest county businesses restaurants open (still limited capacity) months seen jump cases. insane. If/when Germany follows suit, Germany could dealing +30.000 cases per day 2 weeks 😔
🙏🏻 Bro literally self owning, maybe read past abstract. “synthetic” sounds made it’s name stastical method use. literally suggested another comment (comparing Geographic regions world mask usages) protesting would fine. know, that's brilliant... Reagan shoehorn national drinking age. Ordinarily fed gov would authority, however could decide withhold funds. tragic pharmaceutical companies country proven much interested money well-being fellow man.  Even person somewhat skeptical lockdowns (fully support mask wearing slow spread) worried long term consequences vaccine found soon, denying disease orders magnitude worse flu. That's problem anecdotal studies. That’s necessarily good thing, gotta gotta protect yourself. includes mental health too. This. I'm still stunned number armchair experts even legit scientists doctors think surfaces even airborne droplets primary routes. I've reading Linsey Marr aerosol scientists twitter feeds since scientists featured NY Times back JUNE. Throughout summer, even SCIENTISTS fought aerosol tide like hell rose ever higher became tsunami evidence... STILL scientists denial.

What chance public even science infected ego, Iong held unfounded beliefs, suppression evidence contrary narrative?

So far happened masks, asymptomatic transmission, aerosols.

This article time, doctors scientists like Osterholm CNN MSNBC saying contact traced outbreak studies ""inconclusive"", ""circumstantial"", ""based massive assumptions"", ""imperfect"". Six months later they're gold standard that's used basis virus transmitted/referenced constantly. Why? 

Because people learned difficult proper contact tracing U.S. circumstances one ""assume"" study prove work describing virus spread virtually every situation.

Contact tracing U.S. frigging mess largely blame game wishful/magical thinking ACTUAL assumptions basis reality. instance, stay ""objective"" skewing fact person wants kids sports programs rants raves school closed cause outbreak also likely anyone else within cluster engage risky activities. Things like dining indoors, going poorly ventilated office wearing mask, close contact people would same. South Korea, reasonably assume people following protocols.

This following article expresses dismay doctors Germany dealing virus spread far wide U.S., yet CDC, New England Journal Medicine, Koch Institute, SURE lot opinions assumed fact based something even front first time began read things made lot sense surface transmission even droplets. Many scientists, btw, also classify droplets sneezing coughing another form contact transmission - say rare even happens all. dig recent twitter feeds, see would like new terms like ""inhalation"" used descriptor aerosol article tide began way, dissenting voice article, Popescu, seen Twitter feeds scientists bleeding edge virus actually spreads ""fact checking"" clearly upset very, wrong. 

It blows away ""science""(!) Loving crowd believe panacea ignorance realize science evolves way destructive ego driven badly run government. Why? Cause humans. Still human endeavor, still prone human folly. 

Here's Facebook March. Remember, according Trump (on tape!), even President Xi said virus ""in air""... early me, far greatest summation issues U.S. come seemingly country. problems start Oval Office (though course that's one biggest issues American epitaph read:

They let perfect become enemy good. attempted Germany countries Europe.

Yeah, growth cases hospitalizations obviously slower compared hypothetical ""masks off"" situation, still extreme growth right now. Unless stop point winter (which would probably require stricter measures), eventually see hospitals collapse. NRW (large state high population density) school policies also bonkers. made rules kids wear masks take place classroom. Disallowed principals teachers demand masks. rationale kids don‘t spread adults implied really teachers threat teachers got tested every two weeks. Forward 6 weeks higher infection counts numerous schools closed stop regularly testing teachers.

The reality running schools full capacity extremely dangerous kids, teachers parents. kids stay home politically inconvenient. Unfortunately state, schools, teachers kids neither technically skill wise prepared switch remote learning.

They put hard lockdown activities soon combination softer measures including schools. hard general lockdown Christmas. Pick poison. Focus don’t worry others literally place are. contain virus, due contagious nature, requires collective effort consideration others. It’s fucking ridiculous apply edict context. fuck wrong country go people's homes living completely disassociated tbh Dr. Spac E Man Dr Acula False dichotomies, friend. False dichotomies. suppose get ""intelligent"" lockdown next week stays climbing fast We’ve Germany since April never fully understand DeWine's sycophantic mentality. Ohio praised internationally outlets like BBC rare state moved quickly covid response. spoiled caving , reopening, ignoring officials garnered initial praise. Good thing airborne AIDS airborne all! Basically let infection go don’t worry people die. It’s insane doubt happen quick, otherwise obamas buy house Martha's vineyard Ireland allow infected people world come? remember Americans flying there.

Gotta take page places like NZ Taiwan. Stop disease cost FIRST. Yes, tourism suffer, saw domestic tourism made lot lost international tourism. Ireland saved itself, stopped tourists least tourists covid hotspots coming. Irish people can't travel countries travel domestically help offset losses.

By making country safe first foremost, save WHOLE economy take small damages sectors. Taiwan set GROW year 1%. nations shrinking dramatically. can't half ass this. Save country save economy. Let deadly pandemic spread, paralyze yourself. Depending turnover, might completely different team 2-3 years. People relationship besides knowing title sending TPS reports.

Could really give reference somebody never actually met? Like, yeah send data exports within hour get Powerpoint back, bang dude. might well computer program point. 

Maybe works fields. vast majority bosses know want see occasionally, even there's real need. fat pig president go. Vote out! People cities (democrats) people travel (democrats) Tech sales brutal without face face fairly aggressively negative. 

I don’t care think tone. care spread misinformation pandemic. say misjudged ideologue. didn’t think would care paper’s deficiencies.



You correct didn’t really address false positive false negative shown detect antibodies, specifically RBD binding antibodies.

Without false positive negative rates, barely that.

They mention positive control methods, it’s existence.


I would put stock paper. would shock 20 percent accurate.

You’re welcome find sharing paper.

Laters Democracy due new era: à la carte streaming services. Like said, I'm aware existence coronaviruses. I'm even mad online media trying draw readers. Afterall, make money. personally clicked wanted resolve ambiguity ""new"" meant case. right, probably worth commenting on. I'm even phased shit anymore. live shithole saw blue would think taking piss Young people asked give years youth save people voting social safety nets decades--people would never roles reversed. Depression even scratch surface. autoimmune disease still can’t resume daily life people like you. Fuck off. going ignore whole part ignorantly eing wrong prescriptions work jump straight assuming things me?

Get clue dude. understand shit situation. everyone careless self centered insisting pretending know things don't.

Some us adults understand ORM behave appropriately. usually takes community using report button admins know look. I'm big advocate report buttons. gonna chime immunity thing. Antibodies short lived, absolute immunity limited. But, body contains long lived helper cells mount response known antagonist signal creation new antibodies fight infection virus. 

There three main variants sars-cov-2 one variant accounting 90% (possibly higher can't remember exact number hand). infected different variants virus, immunity one guarantee immunity others, probably mechanism people becoming ""re-infected"".

There easy test helper immune cells, like antibodies, mainly concentrations much lower. Currently evidence sars-cov-2 generate helper cells assumed, evidence contrary, lasting immunity virus contract it.

I read literature regarding sars-cov-2 specific vaccines, general purpose vaccines generate t-cell b-cell activation without symptoms antagonist. paper Nature review posits sars-cov-2 generate b cells based early literature. 1 month lockdown incoming, big cities ain't reopening year. Plus might need 3rd one wave 3 rolls around (and possibly one wave?) point chance survival varies based on

* whether country highly developed health care facilities
* whether caught March September, light better ability treat disease doctors learned do
* whether advanced experimental treatments
* whether local hospital room admit treatment all

So giving overall world-average IFR quite useless super informative person particular yea they’re downvoting posts don’t agree like cowards won’t give constructive reason disagreed. ppl continue die unless virus taken seriously. people wore masks social distancing became norm. scared followed rules. Also add schools still closed time people travel regions/go abroad. lying. asymptomatic.   
   
...or presymptomatic 😬 think numbers looking bad US... look country... yikes... Many top 20 countries daily new cases seen order magnitude spike last month. global level, uptick continues week set new global daily case record several times.

So far uptick USA _much_ mild lot places. hoping see massive spike folks predicting. again, we're already seeing ton new cases... continuing current level prolonged period would brutal. Oxford vaccine originally MERS retooled. never went trials MERS ended burning enough funding go trials. 

There's nothing inherent coronaviruses makes impossible make vaccine for. ADE appear issue current crop, would know now. 1/3 Florida already infected.
Got source stat? Ah! preorder PS5. Justified. virus spread essential workers, healthcare workers students. Yeah, would catch people early would still spread parts population right? point pooled testing stops feasible back started. government compares economic benefits project degree danger decides worthwhile. movie appearing large production employs hundreds people so, case, Hanks allowed Queensland. country detailed enough contract tracing able make claim?

You saying significant amount cases would prevented people wearing masks outdoors provide evidence. least double annual flu deaths already. half people eligible vote so...take will. spouse physician familiar complaint. I’m saying venue. Thank work keep people healthy. Stay safe. sure swine flu (family tested positive Flu Flu B, medically literate enough interpret that), would willing bet serious money higher death rate begining whole mess dual infections crazy bad flu coronavirus time.

It worst flu family ever had, Covid definitely mind. keep telling thing fauci said “if job correctly everyone think overdid it” damn, almost like lockdowns masks fucking useless cases come back lift them. Cook books! stop thinking fact lost livelihood, health insurance, contact support system, job security within span months? Great idea! I'm sure help. Oh please, hope see lack numbers graph evidence kind hoax conspiracy. shows trends, graph for. Granted, I'd prefer scale shown, hard find numbers.

Here, 5 seconds work required find numbers you: several information services independently track numbers well case suspect making up. Cases spring vastly underreported, plus cases recently gone overdrive there's still case-hospitalisation-death lag factoring However, vaccines fail, reinfection happens perhaps serious effects, nightmare continue (except East Asia, watching unfold TV) Strip clubs open since July. According friend. headline made laugh  Good point. Archive doesn’t videos. something else does? Again, removing comments claiming political allowing others stay? push narrative want something?

Yup gonna die NC, wear mask fuck huh? 🙄 Vietnam absolutely achieved eradication New Zealand, including beating second wave. Difference is, Vietnam shares several land borders, including 1,300km China. tell Vietnam first world can’t?  someone lives Missouri surprising all. people coronavirus don’t give shit anymore. family invited nieces bday party(they invited around 90 people). said fuck everyone acting like I’m crazy going said covid.Guess won’t seeing weeks. Thank. You. understand people mostly talk masks completely leave social distancing. Masks supposed complement measures, replace... deny science fucking 90 year olds. know existed told me.

I never said anything fucking 90 year olds. insist lying much? Especially things still posted right 90 year olds allowed sex? ""offensive"" that?

And bringing gross you.

I one going talking fucking 90 year olds apparent fuck 90 year olds. I'm keep open mind though.

I guess take yes. control liar bringing crude things realize cannot defend point like adult.

Nothing burden rest society. Yes was. Two factors...bad statistics, treatment got much much better . problem would least partially OK people given shit advice interest - wearing mask protects YOURSELF, like .45acp. Well it’s right get burnt. worry /s going count fact going smack 8 billion people house arrest they're going follow it? Good luck.
Also, lot people can't afford extra 3 months without income, let alone 1 month. Oh, know live, services available, insurance either creepy hell spying me, making claims evidence support.

I mean, 78% U.S. population lives within 5 miles Walgreens, seem like pretty safe bet. live farther away, still probably worth driving to. all, think risk level equivalent ""firing gun air,"" *literally everything can* avoid it. Thanks, too! We'll get eventually! singling “any insular group” — people talking are, bolded quote comment, people believe exempt applies rest us humans: pandemic public health guidelines follow, restrictions observe, ***they apply everyone***, whatever think believe. Ironic considering reply rebuttal. point line drawn censorship freedom speech line potential damage populous greater lost speech. can't cry ""fire."" crowded theater. endangering lives. deaths lag pretty far behind, getting much better treating it. well sucks.  would true strictly look deaths. Covid far higher incidence severe cases flu I'll sure higher hopes Trump office. Coachella get cancelled. way see festival great money get cancelled back-to-back years. Schools safe enough open Spring, Fall. Here's living concrete proof. getting couple billionaires invest lead quite bit taxes little effort pay research safety measures help everyone.

Do see im saying? Letting 6 people lead tens millions extra money. Itd dumb want looked closely?

Covid kids many times people 8 months flu year, that's despite enormous efforts put place control spread covid. 

There' ""we know."" know. dying reality. 7!?!? Quick, bolt everyone inside house. Genuine question I'm trying downplay anything, cases much higher spring, deaths much lower? bad going get admit wrong making shit up?

Florida would 7 million cases liar right now.

They tenth that. someone ""suspecting"" intelligent things, clearly thought fact endemic

What, countries never allow us visit again? US infectious waste humanity going do? Live isolated supporting entire populace employed events sector welfare?

I mean, worked together say would take 6 12 weeks get pandemic control people actually social distanced wore masks. That's even including full lock face shields top masks help can't fix it, might well take hit.

No. Wishful thinking - also people used news cycles relatively quick. Corona disappearing weeks, let alone half year crushing Americans short attention spans.  CASE rates. author declaration thing suggest neatly separating whole society ""vunerable"" ""non vunerable"", anyway? pretty reasonable comment make considering frequently people sub claim East Asia already heavily masked pandemic. NJ FL continues see 100 deaths day theyll surpass NJ 10 days give take. 

With 2.5 FL continues seeing numbers they're seeing could potentially 8,000 deaths end year.

This going happen. even NY would still higher deaths per capita.  jeez florida man, wtf yall doin there? outdoor areas good airflow, probably one one masks social distancing needed.

The big issue Rose Garden Massacre neither things happening. Sin city meets watchers One episodes mostly flashbacks previous episodes. Ya that’s thing horrid flu season. swine flu making comeback I’m mistaken. February never sick entire life. thought going die. bad. Fl 986 less deaths NJ FL continues see 100 deaths day theyll surpass NJ 10 days give take. FL continues seeing numbers they're seeing could potentially 8,000 deaths end year. Surpassing NYC 9,000 short state NY. yeah FL terrible job NY terrible job beginning true. least U.S., false. 

So know anything schedule 2 narcotic prescriptions requirement present pharmacist original prescription signed get prescriptions delivered.

What point go present prescription pharmacist many places offer this.

Not schedule 2 also tens thousands locations drive thru, bank teller style never physically face-to-face anyone.

Oh, know live, services available, insurance use?

You either creepy hell spying me, making claims evidence expecting die. Choosing go store life sustaining activity. expecting curbside only. everything. it. hard. 

If want prescriptions absolutely that, effectively firing gun air. 

Sounds like good go according standards. Turkey made mandatory basically months 20s 60s couldn’t leave house pretty much circumstances. Let's see...

* New Year's ball drop all-virtual

* Met Opera cancelled

* Broadway cancelled

* Coachella delayed, probably cancelled

* BlizzCon all-virtual

* Australia lifting border restrictions end 2021

* Many colleges going online till June, possibly even longer

* many countries repeat lockdown, many *idiots* listen! (This trend going continue get act together, mask up, shut up.)

Don't high hopes 2021. could've avoided obeying science, screwed up. I'm ashamed society. Thanks Definitely Switzerland affect population evenly taking precautions early never let people get scared cases.

People can't stay afraid well protected lockdowns bailouts lot populations countries calm, they're like good time pretending happening real concern money borrowed much borrowed follow rules option let people get sick die overwhelmed hospitals start going hungry.

We might situation would better letting people get sick first real full horrible social experience prevent next couple million deaths.

It's race vaccines treatments people going learn lesson fast enough makes money spend relief bailouts without much complete waste investment.

if we're going afford bailout bailout really work people follow rules we're probably better facing reality immediate deflation immediate negative consequences people get heads asses.

We want get sick coronavirus, maybe got little bit poor would start acting like things serious.

When good job alleviating panic natural disaster especially one runs several months left lot leverage actually control populations.

Face it, scare tactics work asking nicely doesn't. mask debate insane. spring focus social distancing, hand hygiene avoid crowds large gatherings. it’s ok gather crowds long cotton mask face. course cases spiking. think second wave much bigger first masks nobody cares social distancing anymore. I'm Jew, came say forcing follow rule threat locking rest city Antisemitism, public welfare. No. saying worth looking keeping eye general. Death rates COVID almost around world dropped DRAMATICALLY recently, depending first hit virus etc.

“More deadly” necessarily constant time. South Italy relatively poor area economically isolated can't make valid argument, bring strawmen could see certain areas going back lock don’t see states cooperating recommendation(and recommendation US Government doesn’t authority). expect see many people flocking FL winter March/April/May year. interesting see plays out..especially election results bring change. Antibodies virus long loved. memory cells making nothing reinfection right low reported makes likely second infections probably bad felt Imagine thinking reddit influential important removing posts bs petition great political injustice, going write entire article it. facebook lmao. lol, one whinging CDC stated hospitalisation rates high. Please show said saw chronic inflammation asymptomatic patients. ...I never said that? accept arguments illogical conclusion aligned attitudes 

Alright look man, last time I'm replying you. one accepting title face value. sub found subscribed nearly year events slew confirmatory research evidence it. completely different situation, we're talking critical thinking tools, talking sounds like heavy Dunning Kruger. clearly clinging superficial detail overanalysis apparently blind context focused perceived logical problem, absent fact logical exercise. practical, medical, scientific one. goal use logic approach world, please realize logic incredibly flawed. throwing baby bath water. one wore masks, many people got sick. That's correlation. also know causation, incredible amount research backing conclusion. please fuck mr.logic. censored? Anyone says something different president... novel. people could get vaccination, would like flu. way contagious, flu stain contagious spotlighted, I'm sure would people long lasting issues hospitalizations deaths vaccine end year, distributed throughout spring summer things go back normal fall 2021. It’s almost guaranteed. People tired social distancing quarantine absolutely continue precautions vaccine. Folks around already returning pre-COVID normalcy. I’m still diligently adhering precautions, don’t think keep past next fall, especially vaccine. scientists say wear mask. Mask casket like countries children paste eating contest holdouts left, eyeing Elmer's hungry look face. two family members hit similar flu, progressed pneumonia, increased heart rate, pulse/ox 88-93.

It wound influenza tested. 

There serious flu going around time coronavirus getting kicked seems missed people. Without test confirming it, lull false sense security. hi all. found someone close exposed covid whole family quarantine. feel useless. angry, especially current events US. 

Just needed get chest. Thank all, well stay safe!!! anyone care mental health costs rising college education costs before? miserable commuter school time college got full ride really get college experience, got told suck up. treating situation differently? seriously sucks. ""we?"" think impressing imaginary friends get make-believe land imaginary afterlife important surviving now. Additionally estimate saying that's maximal upper cap, meaning think true number infected somewhere recorded 37million 750million 10% would be.

The estimate warming 10% people infected, meaning 90% still vulnerable, must continue take necessary precautions. However likely true number infected falls good deal lower maximum cap, combination undercounted deaths means COVID likely considerably higher fatality rate flu. combination higher rate spread replies addressed equals big difference flu fatality wise. mention long-term health effects consequences people may still good understanding (lung damage etc). found another one least around Paris takes days get test done another 48h get result, likely count five days ago... :(

Making testing basically worthless. rough graphs rather tables eyeballing it, looks like 20k *tests* daily early April. maybe fucking work? People aren’t okay wearing masks. sub talk till mouths fall easy, convient, something small save lives, job 8 hrs every day, etc..

This flat wrong. four super common coronaviruses mutate significant way, remain four seasonal viruses. change ever slightly? Sure, enough fool immune system. I'd love see citation proving otherwise.  virus airborne it’s airborne it’s mostly transferred via droplets

Just one worse make happen. Finally it’s also deadly, particularly young people. mortality rate COVID19 roughly 0.5% flu 0.1%.

We don’t.

Shit completely control information article. read it? cared healthcare professionals tested every shift, maximum ppe. receive medical supplies via delivery. receive food items via delivery.

Why lock entire world mental health economic damages visible already young people simply get bad cases covid, exception unfortunate pre existing conditions. places paying kind hazard pay, let alone retirement matching (frozen) raises (cancelled year). yeah, go take reused n95 see COVID-positive patients, fiiiiiiiine. Governor Hutchinson one Republican Governors spouting COVID problem state?? think lol started wave infections.... That’s use term viral things spread far wide. Viruses that. New ones need controlled. It’s sad enough done. FUCK NEW NORMAL can't comprehend anyone think masks work. especially dire issue reservations. Exactly. proves anyone (even overweight asthma) survive virus. big deal like Christie Trump says. hear bro. Stay safe. Remember iceberg theory popular everyone convinced IFR going really low? much that. 0.6% good news higher range early estimates. Go vegan. understand now! apologize getting snippy 😩 millions people infected recovered Covid, long term damage potential significant amount, would undeniable evidence it, isn't. Correct higher lower? takes 10 soak mask? takes 0.5-1. what? consistent data show much deadly COVID before, hasn’t lately. What? discussing Covid... broad lockdowns ended months ago whatever done selectively implemented. Wtf talking about? Similar story flying miami Feb 1. 

3 day flu, cleared up, month half long cough.

Didn't take antibody test least late June, antibodies showed mask issue shows whats wrong politics. Instead telling truth didnt see comming masks stockpiled asked people knit masks dont buy hospitals stock up, lied. day nutjobs confused many people get infected idiot doesnt wear mask. thats everywhere around world. Politicians honest even hurts people see fuckup. Putin + Trump = #winning flu 0.01% iirc Given happened White house, theres way correct numbers I've read, say ""can"" spread airborne ""can"" get poorly ventilated areas airborne spread, likely spread droplet transmission. recommendation still wear mask practice social distancing along limiting time others poorly ventilated areas.

Yes, everyone wearing n95, could stop spread much effectively. can’t yet lease doesn’t end November I’m planning Stupid people makes sad actually. many world doomed. think close. real reason trump si masks? Honest question. Wait. saying president insist joyride!? order systemic infection need naive system infect. I've seen COVD19 sub commenting nonsense discussions immunity papers. read papers would know saying. infection elict robust systemic immune memory accross disease severities. Sure infect URT, know respiratory tract primary target virus, much like HCoVs, ""deeper"" infection ablated already existing immune memory case reinfections. 

Receptor usage matters little context existing protective immune memory. 

But discussing 4 day old account \_that\_ post history 8 year old could run country better Trump. That's issue. Exceptions East Asians, Yep, interesting cases. Even though might look body would able fully recover, something remains ""locked"". kind situations better understood, maybe could reversed, maybe even relatively easily. suspect reason company telling us we'll looking returning work 3 months revising every 3 months control everyone going ape shit come say can't return work end 2021.

The reality we'll need least 6 months vaccine achieve useful rate uptake. antivaxxers, may never get  people forced bunch schools little cases close put hardship parents. I'm snitching feel too. finally get decent candidates, pushed aside perceived safety. racism, Corps we're green. I've never diverse bunch friends/brothers since. racism tolerated all. At. All.

I remember discussion 2-4 weeks ago. Back Swedes sub fooling Sweden going suffer second wave.

Now countries worse. Sweden worse deaths per capita almost countries. 

Sweden seems unique world pride takesvinbit poor performance. risk everything every day. choose manage risk. feel like wearing mask outdoors necessary please continue so. might good idea personally. judge choice following unless crowded spot. That's another observational study.  I'm American well versed powers federal vs state governments.

SARS respiratory disease, multisystem one. 

Only NL63 uses ACE2 receptor, enhanced cleavage properties make SARS-2 infectious. 

The CCCs completely different tropisms use different receptors. 

MERS uses DPP4, apparently much worse disease progression (from perspective) also much worse transmission (from perspective virus).

How exactly SARS-2 become mild URT infection without losing enhanced cleavage retaining receptor explained. I’m lockdown.  know feel? Safe. Safe lucky brought control.  Almost every country world worse Australia right now. really vary person person, mentally physically. personally get brain fog, really feel like cloud mind preventing thinking clearly.

Sweden Tegnell said going work end year cases would come roaring back Europe.


Europe almost entirely moving towards Sweden's strategy shielding vulnerable.

They right. failure health experts across Europe astounding. absolutely nothing compared Covid. deadly yes, fraction spread. 700k people died AIDS last 30 years. 1/3 way 1/60th fix cable? Well Ohio mask mandate cases going roof right now. people know/see wear them. data back up? previously seen blacks infected 3x deaths 2x whites. would imply white people dying higher rate per infection, really back claim nutrition causing disproportionate differences bad outcomes race. infection rate issue, nothing nutrition. Regarding nutrition, shame public health officials put basically none focus precautions living healthier lifestyle. one thing actually help someone gets infected. 40% America obese helping anyone gets infected Unsuspecting? read Congregants Bobov-45 say informed synagogue leaders advance Unger positive coronavirus diagnosis. rEasOn Hey say Dr Johnny bananas, helped pretty hard donkey Kong levels Complacent, yes. US laughingstock world Europe realizing they’re stubborn, worse, Americans mocked memed. Thanks thorough explanation. Correct. come working one. already manufactured.
Then start vaccinations afterwards. Would still Spring 21 regardless anyone says.

A folks may get access earlier would extremely limited.

Dunno downvotes lol Trump said, wanted play down. Wrong. I'm going indulge wishful thinking. COVID hasn’t even infected close half world’s population stop herd immunity bullshit virus around social distancing measures enforced taken seriously going overrun healthcare infrastructure area outbreak seen happen multiple times disease we’re masking, social distancing, shutting large events. Don’t remember ever flu. sad :(. pay wall strong article though.... major hurricane bearing down, citizens told make decisions. Governments issue mandatory evacuation orders. actions adversely effect people's safety, individual choice longer viable strategy.

Of course metaphor, president lied intensity hurricane people make informed decisions first place. publicly encouraged people listen evacuation orders.  look per capita cases better US. sanitation like? everyone gets sick dies. I'd rather live moment breathe open air worry something inevitably happen us. Also, throw statistics, chance infected person dying COVID-19 U.S. currently 0.02%. understand actually lying countries stated utilize social distancing measures well masks. 

No deny masks work Dutch NL. They've made stances certain types face coverings work actual masks work. problem remains regardless economic viability, certain factions US population would NEVER stand full total lockdown “my rights”. God’s sakes, can’t even wear mask protect others. you’re saying isn’t immunity ? Everything I’ve heard says except small portion population bad immune system. referring lockdown, Philippines countries South America still ongoing lockdown 7 months? saying countries quarantined (legally) people (including asymptomatic) start still it? 

I assume (or least hope) many advice people stay home symptoms many European countries probably give pay leave never read hear sub. second-order consequence ~~pandemic~~ lockdowns

FTFY looked history. Apeared scandel one drug 1999 doubt big deal also pre social media. also never name brand recognition Pfizer has. mention scores usually stoic medical professionals breaking tears camera. Yes elaborate hoax. Gotta agree. fat kid myself, high blood pressure 17!? That's parents. abundance precaution. cant predict person going do, like run you, etc. understand. 

Look charts Italy, California, Spain, Hawaii, Kentucky, Louisiana, Wisconsin, etc.

You clearly look started wearing masks see......it jack shit.

Oh no.

I promised 100 years scientific consensus masking largely ineffective wrong back April Fauci said so. party bruh tragedy....when mot even doctor get meds needed cure disease.

If someone invents affordable highly effective air filtration system conversion kit existing HVAC systems billionaire week. don’t care almost everyone around doesn’t care. Wait mean virus came back? can't be. ""took seriously"" months ago ""wear masks"".

I thought solved problems?


You mean lockdowns delay things masks are, best, simply slow things down?


No can't be.


I thought going ""contact trace"" stop it?

What mean failed? How? mean virus probably infected 250k Europeans given time causes mild illness vast majority people cannot contact traced?????


I'm shocked.


Sweden continues laugh way bank. useful time period allow get back normal like China New Zealand point trying get made earlier thread. NZ Australia tried adding additional protection. community infections started Victoria AU, health care workers caught brought age care homes deaths occurred. Maybe good thing (am german) longer listen stupid people stores marbling ""but muh netherlands, wear masks works"" wearing masks wrong ... thx, NL. :/  IMO makes dangerous: underlying beliefs interest nation. That's higher average life expectancy, scary. listened Kara Swisher podcast current project warp speed head, biased towards liberal end anything. Anyway pretty clearly laid US eaisly enough 300 million people March April. 

It may take longer roll whole world, March way start vaccine distribution everyone around tests positive experiencing flu symptoms diarrhea? That's I've hearing multiple different people either previously recovered people know someone it.

Everyone around chill everyone thinks they're gonna get flu shits, everywhere else I'm hearing could kill you. 

I'm trying say anyone ""wrong"", would like understand what's actually going on.

I'm also hearing doctors around are/were ordered mark deaths Corona deaths, even simple heart attack. People talking much, though, want get doctors trouble, ig?

Tbh also heard stick swab way nose, got entrance mine entire family decided tell person aunt lives tested positive bedroom sick af. 

I hate bubble seem live in. didnt internet know anything anything outside here. /r/mtvchallenge main sub Culture war? talking about? USA all, Trump’s presidency... hear militia Michigan? you’re worried culture war? Pete’s sake wake VOTE! phenomenon noticing local school districts students participating sports teams activities, heavily socially discouraged getting coronavirus test experiencing symptoms, view positive test end team's season disrupt activity. creates unstated strong pressure say nothing team view responsible ending season.

Thus, lot students ""sick"" also quarantining actually getting test, thus counting positive case. view stay home week, feel good couple days, come back rejoin team season keeps rolling.

This alters people act around student, also alters data upon public health officials making decisions. also strongly risks outbreaks. second-order consequence pandemic, making another reason deal pandemic soon possible. many died heart attack cancer? Schroedinger's virus: measure virus there. Yeah shall. I'm betting true not, I'm saying know strong possibility. I'm wrong, that's great. 

God, people really humility things know about. like we're guessing fighting who's right, getting ready gloat I'm wrong 245 days.

But forget site half full 17yos take time mature critical thinking instead arguing fighting. Six year old account submissions, political comments.

Huh. Weird. Seems like something bananas would sure  trouble isn’t one religion. exactly this:

“The Haredi communities ***always seem think rules apply them***! ”

Any cult sect promotes adherents believe somehow unlike rest us — ***that*** problem.

The bad outbreak Korea early on? Members cult attended huge funeral spread far wide. infamous Maine wedding? Evangelical Christian cult. Mormons current Utah outbreak. Amish Indiana outbreak. Orthodox Jews Israel’s NYC’s current outbreaks.

Extremist beliefs root many outbreaks. difficult problem. wouldn’t either, sometimes forest think one around huge group hikers pass right narrow path. It’s good idea mask handy situations like that. Omg excited lol. looks like approval apply EUA. Still important step, I’m waiting see wall “vaccine granted emergency use authorization x country” long China knew. That's odd way view one worst infection rates world still today continues dwarf countries.

ICU road full... many others.

Fortunately, got much better treating early symptoms. [Angela Merkel expects 19000 cases per day according projections presented seem banking herd immunity. CDC guidelines suggest state 10% positivity rate 2 weeks going phase 3. They’ve 10% 3 months straight Phew, relief. what? Genocide weak? even Adolf wanted murder ancestors. Oh yeah, THAT'S gonna happen. /s introduce virus infected people? state fact lockdowns helped. fact, theory, honestly think needs data

Oh, needs data? Based beyond feelings? notion lock downs work comical every piece scientific data I'm aware says worked.  I'd say data pointing towards masks driving factor killing spread, look SE Asia.

That mean lockdowns work. things still debatable.

What, part lockdown helped most? Sure. whether lockdowns effective. virus can't magically infect people, stay home wear mask they're essentials reduced exposure along washing hands obviously going beneficial. part helped most? knows! Lockdowns effective. Full I'm sick people acting holier thou, they're ones ""got right"" others not.

I care wrong past, stop digging heels wrong. That's it, i'll respect say. someone wants lie others respect it. simple.  everyone holidays? want go home parents holidays afraid so. parents 65, mom pre existing conditions. Would smart get antibody test see could come home? get tested prior going home? 1,2 mil week lag results long. break chain contamination. It’a kind useless. least around Paris takes days get test done another 48h get result, likely count five days ago... :( Wtf even retail 1 time 2 weeks paid. Confirmed covid-19 26 additional weeks half pay. Sugar self-perpetuating cravings problem.  overweight last 15 years so, started keto (no cheating) 2 months ago fear death covid. Lost 30 pounds far feel like beat addiction sugar/starch.

A friend mine 400 still always Pepsi colors hand. dread happen if/when contracts COVID-19. Cases don’t matter like use to. We’ve learned overwhelming amount people live contracting virus. people going learn right wrong ban them? worse -- Chinaman

/s FFS lockdown nothing preventing virus come back.

therein lies rub infrastructure help them, including education. 


Michelle Obama tried get everybody eating well, ridiculed it. Oh, admit it. want troll Americans death. Ironically better leadership could prevented.

It’s like country hasn’t fighting COVID since February. There's little chance 10 percent number accurate. Even hard-hit places like Chicago New York 20 percent most, India China definitely nowhere near that. implication comment exercise help weight loss, concerned weight focus diet first. new zealand great example tbh. comparable. question hit South hard North. thing Spain. Doctor McCoy reporting in

""I'm DOCTOR, a... oh wait, nevermind"" Yeah antibiotics oxygen people pneumonia. Can't imagine toll COVID without 2 innovations. mind I'm advocating herd immunity, wanted point north like start hunger famine? That's consequence lockdown third world. crazy much Good Medical care helps Covid, mean boris, Trump Chris survived covid. non-negligible percentage NFL players already barreling towards CTE induced disability premature death. So, yes, level collectively determined sports really necessary. Dude go walk something simple mask shit airborne disease like CDC saying so, many deaths would happened medical technology now, COVID pandemic.

They antibiotics treat pnumonia caused. right would made huge difference. steroids treat cytokin storms took lot young adults? Good, safe IV fluids treat dehydration. Supplemental oxygen. Tamiflu, etc.

Heck, want, lets add would quick vaccine super-dangerous flu today.

COVID worse normal flus WIDE, really WIDE margin. I'm guessing worse us today, similarly novel serious Spansih flu would TODAY one popped up. fits perfectly hanging groups/talking face face outside part specifically posted.. would expect spread conditions. different first world rest world. Shut first world country means social assistance, governments prop closed businesses. Strong currency means take additional debt without real problems. fact many people pay countries privilege lend money (yes weird) secure place park money.

In third world country shut means famine hunger. result shutdown means people dying hunger malnutrition also means people susceptible death disease (including covid). 

Third world countries can't set social assistantance necessary lockdown currencies weak one lend them.

The first world moral responsibility suppress disease. let spread third world effectively lockdown. really? joke. 

Its great using help people, theyve using (ivermectin doxycycline) treat heartworms dogs much longer. 

Maybe instead looking nose, try thinking outside box. ""Normal return 1 year"" ≠ ""As soon 1 year passes, must go back normal."" 1 link single study Steroids you. Fall wave it’s going brutal. entire state 16 available intensive care beds 186 regular, inpatient beds, according Friday figures state health department.

Horrifying. People never going take seriously many going die it. honestly truth people see least start getting idea heads needed right now. prepared, plan stick it, try enjoy things maybe get new hobbies. Keep busy. good point make. correlation equal causation, especially got whole host restrictions coming play basically time. K. Show evidence long term protection coronaviruses. I'll wait. Exactly. That’s became noticeable, like entire nursing home infected. point likely already since multiple nursing homes across different states impacted, happened vulnerable likely die noticed something happening. spreading isn’t perfect doubling number. It’s likely people don’t pass times it’s superspreader event. may require multiple people starts pick steam. type treatment isn’t brand new. Odd side effects harms, like vast majority drugs class.

There’s reason clinical trials study things  It’s anything like flu. It’s Chinese Flu Dr. Acula, Dr. Bombay Dr. Pepper checking in

Heywood Jablome standby wish folks would stayed /r/China_flu agree completely. think misunderstood intent comment. envy you, spent life surrounded idiots finding responses you’re getting genuine surprise.  know China wants share vaccine product vaccine technology. quite different. No, pretty much everyone survives virus......  Sure one, know speak majority. really enjoy people work with, I'm restaurants field really binds people work with. think I'm going play strawman games? obvious game playing realised wrong we're trying avoid admitting it. I'm US met friends returning UK New Year eve shortly afterwards fell sick, much (I'm kind healthy guy) got cough nowhere, since kid. cleared soon, sleep nights it. 

The weirdest thing week afterwards, pee every 20 min. annoying, went doctor find anything wrong. kind nostalgic joined quite early, even asked local school 2 months hit country - get ignored. 

Months later: School unable operate (quasi-lockdown), need use online mailing system school work. tell one ""press message"" they're / prepared (with kind system??) understand FDA's logic, think goes image they're trying portray. mean, cave political pressure; Trump's. truly independent body would've stuck guns, least that's way see it. sad political vaccine become America, sides blame. went nice school mean actually smart. preclude biases. science look form close consensus subject.  


People boasting herd immunity human race historically handled things using sort logic anti-vaxxers use. Science pretty firm types right. people age 30 majority deaths would see completely different reaction.   cases mild, admissions hospital ICU still low, lockdown would overacting point People aren’t going stop going large gatherings whenever ends, masks probably best bet 50 million, that's still hell lot, especially lower population level back then. 

HOWEVER - so, many deaths would happened medical technology now, COVID pandemic. 

They antibiotics treat pnumonia caused. right would made huge difference. steroids treat cytokin storms took lot young adults? Good, safe IV fluids treat dehydration. Supplemental oxygen. Tamiflu, etc. 

Heck, want, lets add would quick vaccine super-dangerous flu today. 

COVID worse normal flus WIDE, really WIDE margin. I'm guessing worse us today, similarly novel serious Spansih flu would TODAY one popped up. What’s strategy leaving house? Dude, fit narrative babies scream for. swear, South Park done many excellent things course tenure TV none accurate PC Babies. default sub Reddit absolutely proof that. YouTube basically like platform crazies. can't even read comments. might understanding wrong don’t think got COVID. think party COVID stuff began. Yeah, flu worse younger age groups. Americans hell bent contrary facts? live michigan flu season going starting doctor said problem they're gonna run early symptoms similar gonna get lot people gonna get misdiagnosed either way winter gonna suck wish best people live lives completely normally. non normal thing wear piece cloth cover chin. cases skyrocketing viral cases doubling every 3-4 weeks. Grow No, people types drugs years. aren’t cancer medication. People don’t rheumatoid arthritis goes away. Psoriasis isn’t cured. Atopic dermatitis tested dupilumamab years. whole lot Mabs list notnindicated cancer. Adalimumab market 20 years many people well 5 years. It’s north 50k per year. Quite number people phase 4 study taking 10 years. 

Just another example someone knowing what’s heute talking about. Well no, governments. Sweden, Florida, Dakotas, Midwest assure us that. People want public. demand every economy that’s open currently. 

I also acknowledged don’t think we’ll completely 100% mask free pre-pandemic levels normal summer. point we’re getting nit picky. I’m talking like nursing homes probably screenings enter, big events require masks. Things much less disruptive daily life. we’re sustainable honestly, really working. People aren’t listening guidelines trying enforce tread personal liberty. Americans don’t like that, honestly think they’re starting point. Harsh restrictions take human collective consideration. They’re nice theory practice, don’t work. People don’t wanna live like prolonging make attitude worse. Well, considering survival rate rather high, I'm guessing fine. bottom you! Byeeeeeeee... No. can't fired sick health care free (as paid taxes).

Obviously exceptions, example job less six months fired reason basically, always social security unemployment fund so. Given exponential growth takes time beginning, wouldn’t surprised first cases late December early January. going handful people, maybe dozen, enough necessarily able identify test certainty. given numbers March, mathematically started least 2-3 months earlier. Wuhan wasn’t noticeable January experts predict initial infection started October November. tho ... ? They're responsible death.  National level emergencies require national scale level responses.

You leave cities respond foreign invasion would you? Someone needs work logic. fact virus spread event people wearing masks, prove masks would stopped spread.

Edit: downvotes makes clear average Redditor sense logic. actually explains lot mess world right now. really, no. article Iran USA? Sorry. misread EU residents. bad. thing is, people know risky. completely fine catching disease. thought ""I'm 70+ okay"" single important driver pandemic. may may noticed comment isn’t pro Trump you’ll get five upvotes check hour two later you’re one zero. think people nothing better go onto non-conservative Reddit posts downvote everything. know wearing mask ""normal"" us Murica, cultures normal cold flu season wear mask. That's ask, classify normal days? one, welcome added benefits masks flu season  That’s I’m asking come worldometers numbers different, doesn’t give us complete updates every day, 8575 deaths sounds bit strange, I’m saying it’s wrong, don’t get 3000 deaths appeared day 26,896 11% 244,500. means France testing almost 250,000 day? That's quite impressive. Yes read article. author says it’s “simply possible” get back normal. don’t agree sentiment one bit. It’s essentially encouraging people give up. doubt Ebola

Yes, lot ""worse"" ebola far contagious harder stop spreading. 

Look way, ""worse"" - MERS 35% death rate COVID, .5% - 1%? MERS killed bit 2,500 people 8 years. COVID-19 killed million last 8 months.

Seems like COVID lot ""worse"" despite lower death rate, huh? Neither you, acting did? Water wet. say never return original comment? feel 20 years younger. Mark Rutte, Dutch PM, denied economic help worst hit countries first wave (mainly Spain Italy) supposedly prepared well enough deserve it. even made jokes laughed it.

I hope things get better there, one deserves get virus, also hope followers learn humility. he's nowhere near woods yet, correct hope christie least survives Nothing said true lmao. Baseball fine, NFL postponed games, two postponed 1 2 days. no, considering suspending season, made up. Here's thing--your employer kind knows this. starts American workers WFH. Well now, workers located matter. look even cheaper sources labor overseas, job. still one first heard disease missed lot development meta joined. huge respect you, informed internet stranger! think need next paradigm thinking, quick. fucking orange hair grumpy old fart say covid less lethal flu? said bless get it. That's like.. entire city gone day... know global scale still.

Unfortunately, China’s secrecy topic, may never know. don’t see origin virus influence response though I've taken gander covid19 sub, looked much write home I'll take another flooded clickbait funhouse media distortions scientific comments barely understand

Which time there's link says something extraordinary read actual study paraphrasing. recommend everyone else get around editorialists. epidemiologists immunologists virologists floated opinions later turned wrong, unlucky guesses. 

Which announced such, guesses. normal wrong science, absolutely normal, studies keep repeatedly showing data hard refute it. really wish we'd settle making strong point Covid-19 seasonal flu, rather compound error making like influenza general potentially extremely dangerous something wary of

Influenza absolutely serious americans clue influenza is, think ti's normal cold. said, fail see link either things. Covid well established worse flu, even swine flu, debate comes regularly. Why? people talk feelings. frank idea worked based Trump's outcome. information extremely limited. 

The early results actual studies really positive drugs however. results continue monoclonal antibodies may game changer. us peasants ever get access ridiculous government forces herd immunity us?.....I think so. Sweden asked 70+ “self isolate” since spring. difference laws recommendation obviously, adherence seems pretty good. problem 85-100 year olds often need care can’t isolate like healthy 70+ can. would need well defined threshold downplaying pandemic criticizing report it. want people getting banned saying believe report biased nonfactual. He/she needs vacation. ""BuT SaFe!"" Perspective Right. Someone get memo. Cut testing stuff! Sure, got reports happening Wuhan I'm condoning that, even lacks full picture done China's restricting ability leave apartments high list.

Most lockdowns restrict essential activities like work buying food/groceries.

That said, countries done anything mentioned list, really, Sweden unique taking balanced reasonable approach.

Thanks clarifying, genuinely curious remark excessive draconian measures included. Mate moved netherlands Australia amazing ignorant majority people covid.
People started wearing face masks supermarkets 
But little late imo dude replying known troll here. useless -- two months Spain got &lt; 20 cases per day per 1M people. US 60 cases per day per 1M people since March. one migrating sweden model all. Sweden took forever get proper testing contact tracing organized. still don’t wear masks. anything it’s sweden moved towards model actually works time gone. continue move.  Nice, already got scapegoat ready. must nice personal responsibility. Following logic, incentive company anything illegal unethical make money. That's simply reality, especially given fact zero liability product. constantly reading group people/religious give fuck spreading COVID. asian country, deal type people/religious? could said reply well. 

"" suspected covid immunity would likely short term despite fact that's normal coronaviruses ""

Liek say, suspected. neglecting fact rbody learn combat even though isnt immune. thi sis exactly problem all.

It kind reminds nothing never-ending story. Opinions backed nothing worth nothing comes pandemic. something share goes grain? Cool, offer citations actually back point up. 

I interest feelings spread fact. Australia grant provisional approval AstraZeneca Makes think story one local news organizations ran yesterday advertising district hiring substitute teachers “we hundreds teachers gone”. Gee, wonder is? /s🤦🏽‍♀️😒 Science care respect Facebook. Damn didn’t realize qualified Harvard, Stanford Oxford epidemiologists. What’s credentials? know people hate good headlines millions people been, shockingly, treated covid recovered. easier detract information commenting posting portrayed doomsayers instead people spreading factual information. I've called doomsayer similar multiple times sharing factual information. Basically, Soomlab Airqueen made nanofibers mask touch lips like surgical masks. almost feels like wearing anything. talk breathe quite normally. seal also good compared surgical masks Asymptomatic mild carriers Headline that’s intended make anxious people click it? wonder it’s coincidence absolutely butcher ads 🤔 Hahaha thank God! Read mask box...""does protect coronavirus"". always contagious nature Covid. comparing two anyway? symptoms similar different even matter? going meaningless comparisons respiratory diseases? Stupid ass post article. I'd say anyone disagrees banned. clear I'm always right dissenting opinions wrong.

If disagree probably Russian bot anyway. I've heard Mike say 0.67% Testing also peak, remember r/china_flu best source covid-related info (along BNO News, tho seems managed make somewhat comeback recently), Diamond Princess, Italy/Spain, reddit pin mod swap happened, long days mainstream media pick subject politicians trying downplay it.

I witnessed eyes big panic small group worried people global deaths reached 1000, chinese information blackout attempts, etc.

Some us may even remember reading small surge Shanghai pneumonia deaths December 2019, even labelled coronavirus.

The [Eternal always destroys find dear. understand still healthcare workers believe covid continues downplay it. authors totally legit. Look yourself. Internet trolls idiots doesn’t invalidate authors said are. initial excessive draconian measures

What would excessive draconian measures then? everybody arguing everything since start pandemic

Most things well established now, we've 10 months research dude many months ago like NO. SCIENCE. like you, telling masks ineffective. Technically correct according science, virus smaller .03 microns. nuance argument.

No, wrong. dead wrong. Masks absolutely positively help even though droplets virus airborne, can't argue rates asymptomatic carriers masks versus wear masks. Viral load important. 95 percent asymptomatic

Is common statistic wear masks, viral load absolutely matters. retarded, point I'm sick people like holier thou. know. know. Nobody knows sure. evidence theories. facts.

Studies happened real world situations combined studies evaluate things like far droplets/particles travel different types masks last 10 months informative. pretend wrong like answers contradicts something heard almost year ago change anything.

I'm sick people like acting like consensus covid. Unfortunately deaths stay 2 100 thousand cases. run without mask, also make point running areas little foot traffic. run favorite areas since start pandemic since many people around. someone argues gut...you know there's convincing. incredibly infuriating. Sure, current trajectory good Germany either anyone enter name. authors fake come epidemiology backgrounds prestigious university. 

But random troll 
wants put fake name they’re somehow discredited? don’t think so. NYC ok

Just clusters here

I wouldn’t going B&amp;H photo  right sir. give upvote right. COVID fucking polio level, *especially* age demographic children. kids covid mild cold, nasty flu like illness lasts couple days. Polio literally paralyzed people. countries think best according specific circumstances. judge them. discussing Swedish model many countries measures poor fit Sweden. need wear masks! It’s simple 210,000 deaths acceptable you? Ya know, would. profession may changed forever year, fresh eyes fresh voice. long willingly go knowing may new norm, good things. I’m sure nursing school also evolve teach students deal new stressors. I’m also lucky enough work ride-or-die unit; us would anything other. get mad denier BS together, laugh good times together. may stressed adjusting new norm, RN still. Pursue want it.

Edit: Successive comments mention pay, consideration many. Search imagine could deal ya hear go now. hope better 3+ years ya get license. shocking. could know masks would work? studies, experts talking it, asian nations wore beginning never high numbers countries significantly dropped new infections since agreed mask mandates, could know would work US? Unforeseeable! Magic almost. Must voodoo like thing liberal left something... virus smart enough distinguish funeral protests?

You’ve never attacked protests throw big party medical advice everybody gets sick, least equally responsible. Man. insanely dense. 

Yeah, ok, attacking personally now, I'll take mean lost argument move on. 

I conversation someone that. Blocking now. censored? posted allow people decide themselves? Yeah, averaging hundred deaths per day since august.

Like said. Leveling hundred cases per day. Turn seven day line seem confused daily statistical noise. 

With restrictions relaxed large gatherings, think going happen?  Hijacking top comment plug Financial Times' information page: looking great new cases, click Deaths button looks lot better first wave (for now). don’t understand: simple division home state, get 3% IFR based confirmed cases. get confirmed cases aren’t cases, telling 5 times cases what’s confirmed? seems implausible me. .01% France? 26,000 new cases today equivalent 136,000 day US anyone wants read Great Barrington Declaration – infectious disease epidemiologists public health scientists grave concerns damaging physical mental health impacts prevailing COVID-19 policies, recommend approach call Focused Protection. left right, around world, devoted careers protecting people.

Simple hygiene measures, hand washing staying home sick practiced everyone reduce herd immunity threshold. Schools universities open in-person teaching. Extracurricular activities, sports, resumed. Young low-risk adults work normally, rather home. Restaurants businesses open. Arts, music, sport cultural activities resume. People risk may participate wish, society whole enjoys protection conferred upon vulnerable built herd immunity. sick December something would let go. Constant productive cough, low grade fever, body aches, extreme fatigue. didn’t feel back normal couple months. population massively reduced, global warming would also reduced. could win environment. survivors could also experience wage increases similar increase wages Black Death. people could also solution housing shortage. 

There lot upsides reducing population. doubt it. Mask wearing part culture (due pollution, etc) much incorporated asian street fashion. know estimate number deaths flu year? number ""excess deaths."" take amount extra people die baseline. 

COVID killed many times people last 8 months flu year last 100 years. 

There rational debate this. showed data throws “more deadly” question.

No, sent data specific place specific time. Besides fact I've shown hat data suspect, flue worse one place one time, mean deadly covid deadly many, many, almost every place amounts time. 2020 worry seeing [forrest] trees can't see trees smoke. Would total complete shutdown beginning worked though? takes one person start wave again. failed finding dried up. never vaccine initiative much money manpower thrown now. large outdoor groups speaking about? Seriously, ones where?

Man. insanely dense. everyone goes outside represent statistically large group people. I'll say **for third time now** likely catch COVID outdoors following protocol wearing mask indoors would prove ineffective. They'd catch went outside. see that. contact tracing tell people catch outbreak. outbreak occur likely people caught simultaneously outside one else did. thing routinely common place around wearing mask makes big difference (hint: do)

No that's specifically know. Masks make big difference indoors. made big difference outdoors following protocol matter wore mask indoors. catch going outdoors. process elimination know that's case. No, doesn't. common misconception.

An average best characterizes sample population. Sometimes arithmetic mean. Sometimes median--like sample clear centrality, skewed way. often neither there's centrality like infant mortality income. liar.

What think stand gain acting like child denying science? get point much harder. Countries Europe often three countries bordering them, people fed up, restrictions way less required politicians basically playing game important prevent worst people happen. Economical, terms lockdown, would affect every single person country, even worse March April let people die form damage control still maintaining economy keeps balance people don’t end kind dystopia.

I reading informing since February several times day hate solution simpler politicians may make us believe, read whole damage control thing sense makes, people generally get angry frustrated long-term consequences (less trust government, authoritarian leaders gaining popularity (assumption) criminality going due people searching way get next weeks months).... imagine happen US lockdown comes one gets stimulus check, everything fucked up... Ok, please use brainpower debunking used maliciously liars, reddit title observing irony practical correlation proven data.  Otherwise pretty much wasting everyone's time. I'll leave aside argument anecdote thing understood 40% buy thing, Fauci used anecdote appeal truth gives fuck. twat. saying pan out, make anyone thread bad people denying reality spreading anecdotal hogwash. makes look bad saying ""technically correct, best kind correct"" make petty logic observation situation hundreds thousands Americans died. Child. Sure coronavirus ended today I'd agree you, said done FL thousands dead NJ. NY NJ averaging 10 dead day. Florida horrible job right moment they're leading nation deaths per day. You’re idiot world may worse, hopefully better. something new, go “back”. 

The world never went back old normal wars big changes. pandemic already going many months, impacts felt long time. think purged sub. are, form one downplayers receive viewpoints. here, get called dumb.  stayed Florida one would care. Trying what?

You want know personally stand this? early days believed HCQ worked, RCT's came out, highly questioned effectiveness HCQ.

Still sure works, combining study, showing statistically significant reduction ICU hospitalization rate questionability RCT's make question again. wrong stop asking questions IMO.

And posted this, like post significant surprising research articles COVID-19 Dutch researchers sub-reddit. apparently living lower-case either. deaths still falling. deaths peaked long time ago. curve later NY.

Not look data. still reporting hundred cases day leveling off, Florida fucked NY/NJ right criminally neglegent.

And never said otherwise, point? Florida far less deaths NY NJ.

Are ok? No, leave place it! true. Lockdown caused lose job, wife cheat me, children come dropsy, sows fail wean piglets spring. Lockdown also turned newt - got better. It’s bad information. Keeping information quality high important. It’s new. incorrect theories posted before. 

What joke, fake names petition? Since town 10,000 considered city? Sorry maybe lack perspective I’ve lived home country considered town 280,000 city 20 million NYC 8 million Chicago 2 million statistically large groups. Practically everyone goes outside.

What large outdoor groups speaking about? Seriously, ones where? Masks would prove ineffective indoors people caught going outside.

Not wearing mask makes big difference (hint: do) husband said mystery illness November December. never gets sick sick full two weeks. get respiratory things mine lasted month plus, shortness breath toes turned red. I’ve heard others state time. choose deaths fewer deaths?

Why? Barrington Declaration rightwing push open economy regardless deaths follow.

It merit, seeks undermine consensus required effective control Covid19 spread. I'm concerned college kids may infect nursing home patient. 

I want locked cure. time people take thing serious world population fallen half. Ignorance, biggest virus among us. Can't let local leadership hook either. necessary. curbside delivery. minor fee (&lt;$5). Worth help slow spread. 

And never said didn't.

But option picking actually said do.

So lying? go buildings unless life sustaining activity. Expecting die lack life sustaining nutrition medication absolutely asinine. COVID confirm it’s NOTHING like flu. sucks it’s serious. Wear damn mask.  Florida's deaths still falling. deaths peaked long time ago. curve later NY.

Florida going come anywhere remotely close death rate NY NJ. 


If Florida fucked NY/NJ right criminally neglegent. 1) we've gotten better 2009 producing vaccine. 

2) spansih-flu-bad, we'd produce quickly. 

3) really bad, could also enact covid-style social distancing masks

4) again, sorts treatments like antibiotics, steroids, supplemental oxygen, iv fluids, etc would GREATLY blunt death rate spanish flu today. 

Again, there's comparison. COVID much worse flu right now. Haha ya confused stating fact not. would depend effective masks (and studies show effective).

We evidence. Large outbreaks occurring, mask usage mandated outbreaks flatlining. spreads get traced. traced back illegal gatherings people following large, outdoor groups? generally banned.

As statistically large groups. Practically everyone goes outside. Masks would prove ineffective indoors people caught going outside. That's see. process elimination tells us follow protocol outside indoors combined contract tracing highly unlikely get COVID. telling Dr. Donald Quack, MD, front University Mom real doctor?

SMH mainstream closed thought liberals. entirely incapable adult conversation? Known how? said don’t test flu like COVID. showed data throws “more deadly” question. still lot don’t know. Yes, right. I've heard one two belief say much, lo behold, last heard hospitalized Covid. ignoring stats?


If want look deaths, Florida reporting roughly hundred since August New York reporting fewer ten time period Florida better job according you? people sacrificing alot others though. isnt “drinking bar” “eating restaurant time time”. youth, last couple years experience crazy stuff relatively worries, discover are, whats important growing person. time meeting new people discovering new things spend almost exclusively behind computer screen. average age people dying 82. incredibly sad people dying part life. people already lived full lives. Thats say disagree measures weve taken far, ill gladly carry 2021 something, im saying fair keep years rob entire generation important years theyre also ones gonna carry main burden paying enormous cost pandamic created. saying make sacrifices, people affected virus least sacrificing most. fact push issue aside “tsh cant handle going bar restaurant while” shows entire degrading mindset part problem. Honestly feel like leave rest behind like anti vaxxers. We’re stalling much progress prove basic shit people aren’t going listen first place. remember seeing study WEEK AGO confirming covid spreads air, anybody who’s paying attention isn’t doubting this. Desperate mate. Germany think due sudden, fast increase daily cases come increase positive rates well upcoming days, another commenter figured, clusters family &amp; people close infected people get tested well likely positive. Oh, interesting. thought person might indirectly attributing antibiotics valid/effective medicine viral infections It’s nothing new Reddit. Gatekeeper’s galore. Share masses H1N1 vaccine short supply global demand way higher standard yearly flu vaccine, however production wouldn’t close theoretical maximum like probably see covid vaccine goes full scale production. 

We’re different world 2009. understand outdoor transmission occurring people wearing masks outdoors wearing masks indoors would proving ineffective?

You stating fact not. would depend effective masks (and studies show effective). groups people reliably follow outdoor protocols getting COVID. 

What large, outdoor groups? generally banned area lots cases covid.  OP comment Florida done terrible job handling virus. 


By metric?


If believe FL horrible job NY NJ insanely, war crime level bad job. suspect combination surge universal, among countries totally different responses patterns past (Ireland, Czech, Spain, US Northeast, starting Sweden) strongly suspect temperatures starting drop seasonality big factor, viruses spread way, make harder mitigate level restrictions reduced mobility before. wonder start see similar phenomenon east Asian countries feel ya neighbour. Belgian here, we've reached 5000 infections day seems everything normal apart bars close 11.

I'm disappointed country ""government"". wear mask. socially distance. want parents safe, looking around.. I'm seeing stubborn stupid people ruin follow rules.
Stay safe take care man Gosh, 1 every 7 people get sick around end hospital, big deal.

The flu, contrast, seems around 1 1900 people end hospital 7. 1 intellectually honest second, talking percentages, anything 50% cannot be, definition, ""way high"".

What heck? fine 1 3 people die whatever? less 50%, way high? fine 1 3 people homeless? That's way high homelessness rate? Making massive generalization anything less 50%, can't way high makes absolutely sense. Let's say 1 1,000 people die medical neglect. way high? Nobody die medical neglect. child abuse. Anything 50% way high you? Cuz people dumb None rambling incoherence anything topic. all. health care living standards kinda shit back ... offence... even sniffles dangerous back then...

It's good 1919 pandemic flu let's overextend comparisons... Apparently 1 10 people go long covid like getting acknowledged.
It's truly worst year :(
Good option work home, take care not. politically connected known storm precincts past challenged. shitshow Brooklyn. problem people, including president, spread false info corona deaths actually caused things called corona coroners kind monetary incentive. spread facebook conservatives immediately considered true, doesnt help Trump retweeted it. pandemic response leader Calling mask wearing dangerous anti mask policy never got hazard pay, got extra anxiety fact might die soon completely unable prevent hanging head every waking moment day. feel like we’re talking past other.

49MM - statistical estimate TOTAL flu cases US year. 

7.5MM - CONFIRMED COVID cases, FRACTION total cases. 

Total COVID cases question mark. isn’t 7.5MM. 20MM? 30MM? 50MM? 

If assume 214k accurate number deaths, IFR 0.3% (small population size seem get IFR), you’d hit 71MM infected. Seems high me, I’d guess there’s complexity (like care facilities early/quick spreaders responsible deaths maybe? Speculating.)

Also, noted last point. obvious simplifying assumption purely speculation. Given don’t know difference confirmed cases total cases, might missed nuance. need mandate butt plugs then. Well yea... flu

/s ignoring infection rates?


Because gives shit. 

You chose infections less deaths less infections deaths.


Which pick?

Go ahead. I'm worry unless standing middle times square new year, theres way hell I'm wearint mask outside right track since note issue observed actual infections. learn statistically normalise observed data overall population demographics. 

For example, say 1 case covid 100 year old. person died. OMG 100% fatality rate!!!!

There way disease 100% fatality rate. 10% population infected, 90% infections 65, observations true representation diseases really like general population. need adjust normalise data. Contract tracers put indoor, understood-to-be transmissible contacts outdoor ones.

Do understand outdoor transmission occurring regularly people wearing masks outdoors wearing masks indoors would proving ineffective? That's clearly case. process elimination see high degree certainty following guidelines outdoors instances people know hell could gotten it

We would expect see saying true; large groups people reliably follow outdoor protocols getting COVID. opposite true. Mask wearing indoors following protocol outside works. comparing NJ FL begin with? likely average whole world - countries like India young population IFR 0.3% UK Spain 1% (in quite thorough well designed studies). 10x deaths nearby countries, -8.6% economy Q2, worse lot European countries. antibody testing shows 6% infected, far far herd. Hard say. Dark figures early European outbreaks order 1:15 1:25, it‘s probably something like 1:3. Given peaked around 100k - 180k new cases per day first wave, it‘s 80k. rough order magnitude estimate, think we‘re quite yet. Getting close though. Oh shut up, say every thread moron. everyone does. NY NJ within week they'll deaths NJ.

Florida population 2.5x larger NJ. getting Pakistan thing statistics also depict India country maximum number people (around 56%) without toilets basic sanitation. shit who's madman associate vaping 2018 viruses 2020? ignoring infection numbers?

Of course states got hit first knew handle virus worse patient outcomes locations kick later.

Are intentionally trying mislead people? lack scientific literacy preventing analyzing situation variables?

Oh, want look deaths, Florida reporting roughly hundred since August New York reporting fewer ten time period? Dude upset likely lost chance another natty. hes willing sacrifice amount fans ppl general population make sure dont lose again. Idiot. Center Disease Contagion sad study prove Ah well fuck.

Edit: thats couple weeks old, worst case projection expected result countermeassures (curfew, banning sport events, etc) taken. Seeing people downplay hurtful. I’m ICU nurse seen bad Covid is. I’ve seen families lose 2 people many days. I’ve seen mother, father, son unit together. I’ve seen people look like they’re better wind vent hours later. Yes, we’ve seen flu complications, like this. Patients taking weeks get ICU many aren’t going home, they’re going rehab/LTACH staying IMC med surg another weeks. saw lot flu hospitalizations year prior, lot ICU tended either get better quickly die quickly, require months long ICU stays vents. deaths covid also particularly brutal. Multisystem
organ failure, proning...all ugly. proning, everything keep getting skin breakdown, it’s nearly impossible prevent start becoming swollen kidneys fail. don’t know I’m going this, really hurts see people suffering like see others deny reality. wonder can’t get people side voting. Lord, listening?    exactly harmful rule place? worst, mask nothing. everything gain everyone board wearing them. Reminder: Toronto Sun FOX News Canada. Also, 2 doctors lol. Hopefully works worry little late. might need bigger shutdown.

Had done BC closed clubs night time liquor service could avoided surge turn prevented bigger lockdown. movie theatre since 2015. can't say something missed, miss. Ohh got it. Would putting surgical mask over/under n95 w tape make difference? Basically world fucked. virus everywhere sensible thing Wuhan style lockdown 2 weeks, clearly won’t happening. Hopefully eventually pass reduced real estate costs employees. Pre-covid, toddler's pediatrician said expect 10 bouts illness within first year daycare. 

Not 10 _days_ illness, 10 different times getting sick, translates like 50 100 days illness first year. Ugh. They're children, there's army people want downplay want restrictions. either want believe ""herd immunity"" care want us open bars struggling current situation.

There definitely chance coronavirus like coronaviruses- give 6-12 month immunity. That's fact. get Cov-HKU-whatever every year catch it. 

I'm arguing I'm stating facts saying know, definitely possible. 

People also assume tolerate accepting scientific fact, means love enjoy bad news. infantile. personally think big trouble vaccines 100% effective half people get anyway. concerned reinfections long run, new virus maybe 15% US infected. immunity like coronaviruses lasts 6 months, people asymptomatic, still strong mitigation, may see reinfections easily yet. could take year good mitigation live. one biggest concerns. think bad think about, course downplayers want ""go back normal"" matter aggressively reassure comments downvote rational people say reinfection real possibility future. reasons. 

They cite happened far, truth enough data, immunity 6-12 months definitely enough data. Places hit hard strainer preventing resurgence, community probably protection 3-6 months too. 

We humble instead assuming know reinfection rare. Reinfection rare *right now.* static fact since behavior virus still unfolding dark lot things. Bad idea Rabbi. Good luck getting public support another lockdown. Even wear masks like should, distancing possible virus going spread. think things touch bus, tram metro open door, hold onto stuff trying fall, hold onto stuff sitting down, people end touching trying get off... etc etc... sadly sounds like American thing religious thing. live abroad different churches husband's family go still broadcasting sermons online high risk people dont come person well promoting handwashing/social distancing/mask wearing. people going along precautions also range casual churchgoers people dedicate whole lives church.


The belief people magically saved illness nothing prevent contracting stupid. God, rolling eyes right people given basic health safety info rejecting claiming spared. given info tools, dumbass, using them. First reason study can't find link limitations study, actual properties mask usage. IMPORTANT PROPERTY MANY EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCES BAD ARGUMENT RELY ON.

Let give example: Say reason notice phenomenon every week child comes home black eye someone bullying him. want run experiment think part clothes causing bullying need make sure something else (the needing make sure something else called practice [having making sure [""confounding start telling child say anything school. Another week passes still comes back black eye. confirms he's bullied saying. throw wardrobe purchase new clothes him. following week send school. Noticeably time comes back black eye confirms he's bullied clothes. 

If child told you, ""Dadddd, talk schoool!! can't quiet entire week!"" still threw wardrobe got black eye results: can't say there's casual relationship changing attire getting bullied. happening study linking. thing measuring (the effective masks), they're looking retroactively data mask usage (before changing wardrobe). noting widespread mask usage correlates descrease spread. can't control behavior decreasing spread (can't control soon talking school) can't infer casual relationship.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

One lead scientists (Jaap van Dissel, RIVM, Institute public health environment) publicly states masks much focus social distancing. says social distancing way important. get wrong, care measures needs taken. gladly whatever protect people around me. Enjoy outdoors. Go walk, hike, see what’s there. Lockdowns suck don’t let stop enjoying life, still visit others long long exercise necessary precautions. much easier police people wearing masks outdoors make people put mask entering closed spaces. 

It's definitely not... Inside there's always someone who's responsible policing right enforce - retail workers, event staff, bus drivers, teachers, etc.

Who's going policing outside? actually going station cops walk around see people wearing masks? Would need ton cops that... Say hi good boy(or girl) me? Excellent article especially regards discussion 'muscular Christianity.' expect electorate continue consent measures vaccine becomes available. Especially implying reason slow return people end getting it. see renewed level support heavy handed measures unvaccinated hopefully sustained well funded campaign targeting antivaxers.

If made mandatory employees present proof vaccination order work (or medical exemption doctors exempt certain percentage patients facing censure) would hell lot quicker Nuance doesn’t get likes upvotes Cue screaming Karens. even issue? always go jogging outside without mask on. again, there's never anyone around me. Ok. thinking opposite direction, haven’t spent 10 seconds weighing pros cons. 

“Over 75 working? Stay home, we’ll deliver essentials care vaccine”

Or something... don’t know... think we're going crazy pandemic. single proof wearing mask outside helps pandemic, *one*.
 
Sure, wearing mask protects others, doubt. live non-densly packed area, asking wear mask outside akin asking wear talisman. 
 
We see France imposing stricter mask wearing policies effect whatsoever. I'm Switzerland wearing masks shops declared mandatory places showed absolutely effect local statistics. one. 
 
Sure, Singapore fine, South Korea Asian countries. assume due cultural factors well, mask wearing. Kudos effective guess. exactly wrote. means “maximum estimate.” calculating maximum value estimate could be. said room COVID estimate account 11.69x current death toll. You, hand, saying wasn’t even enough death account estimate high, ever really said 2x 3x, maybe higher latent/long-term symptoms prove issue.

There enough **excess** death. It’s possible people died covid.

This like saying could many 3 million shark attacks rough, goal, calculating upper bounds estimate, much better calculation. better calculation would actually similar estimate flu estimate similar methodology similar goals compare two.

Better best. excess deaths give much better approximation covid deaths overall death happening speak every time COVID infects someone increases chances ultimately shortened lifespan number damaging effects COVID beginning understand. flu estimate compared raw death counts.

You keep acting like way bound number. do. I’ve explained it. It’s unreasonable assume dramatically fewer people died non-covid causes year, excess death number gives good upper limit number deaths caused deaths decent measurement use here, may better indicator actual covid death count, doesn’t make comparison flu estimate valid. suffers exact problems. still raw death count doesn’t capture true death toll virus, entire burden disease like flu estimate attempts do. take long term factors account like flu estimate does. flu estimate factors whole lot deaths this. That’s lot it’s ~5x number actual deaths, evidence it’s probably ultimately contributing lot deaths doctors realize based scientific analysis. still comparing excess deaths actual influenza deaths.

This wrong. excess deaths takes account everyone dies even tangential ways covid. Even people shoot quarantine counted excess death numbers. excess deaths absolute liberal estimate covid deaths. anything, flu death estimate restrictive compare excess criticism use estimate compare even refer “estimated excess deaths” flu estimate you’re comparing takes shit ton data account estimation does. estimations created equal simple estimation based excess deaths verified death counts alone I’m sorry pales comparison flu estimation. need factor LOT data reasonably compare two numbers.

My estimate upper limit. I’m aware it’s flu estimate, difference help case here. difference estimate covid almost certainly higher true number would equivalent flu actual raw death counts either disease, however, none faults. fact matter informed medical professionals reason believe influenza contributed someone’s death mark such. COVID. verified death counts either disease comparable come.

Those numbers significantly less comparable, like already explained. Way, way fewer people get tested flu covid. idea percentage covid deaths go unreported percentage flu deaths go unreported extraordinarily unlikely. Well icu really issue here. Scaling normal healthcare main concern. right, reason deserve help Germany.

Also rant bit, wait three days get test. waited 24 hours already result. confirmed case job close contact with. feeling bit weather, would disappointed included statistic tomorrow.

Keeping gold medal. Boulder, Colorado don’t think I’d good comparison - car crashes definition fast unexpected. cars appear pass within seconds, get crash without another car around (crashing pole, etc). walking less populated area, see another person approaching good minute put mask on. almost like republicans believe delegating power states...which better idea kind rules required locally. 


Rules make sense New York City necessarily make sense rural Idaho, logic kind power delegation. Sort of, one county city banned young people going bars gathering, group .02% chance dying virus. Why? live bylaw. likely call police however get fine gives business added right refuse service. advised federal government enforced provincial municipal. organized less contradictions government levels page.

 still small percentage people refusing overall there's risk fine comply point balance. people say coronavirus myth good complying safety rules would say people side stick even worse. panic much want everything everyone shut down, I’m like: „Dude financial family responsibilities can’t stop going work otherwise family fall far worse problems COVID cease exist”. Plus often times aggresive. would say people either side spectrum bad advice would be: „Don’t ignorant stay vigilant also don’t selfish a*shole craving shut universities, work places etc. ruin others peoples’ lifes God sake solve panic issues”. guess twitter giving opinion Shareholders rejoice. already know like flu. get flu pretty sick days. get COVID small chance really sick, moderate chance flu like symptoms, really good chance symptoms all.

So yeah, definitely flu-like all.  r/thechallengemtv might know Bannanas got PhD say Asian men pandemic handled well?  Umm... isn’t least negligent homicide?  

What “White House”? Who’s charge goddamn thing? Arrest charge immediately! What’s big deal? still choose wear masks, weren’t outlawed !

Trump, CDC, beloved Fauci told everyone masks don’t work... like option. like across ocean then. source might need linked order directly go deeper know SARS-COV-2 transmitted, know steps take limit transmission.

Then cases simultaneously dramatically rising across North America Europe?

Human infection SARS-CoV-2, causative agent COVID-19, leads remarkably diverse spectrum outcomes, ranging asymptomatic fatal. Recent reports suggest clinical genetic risk factors may contribute COVID-19 susceptibility severity. investigate genetic risk factors, collected 500,000 COVID-19 survey responses April May 2020 accompanying genetic data AncestryDNA database. conducted sex-stratified meta-analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) COVID-19 susceptibility (positive nasopharyngeal swab test, ncases=2,407) severity (hospitalization, ncases=250). severity GWAS replicated associations severe COVID-19 near ABO SLC6A20 (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, identified three novel loci P&lt;5x10-8. strongest association near IVNS1ABP, gene involved influenza virus replication, associated males. two novel loci harbor genes established roles viral replication immunity: SRRM1 immunoglobulin lambda locus. thus present new evidence host genetic variation likely contributes COVID-19 outcomes demonstrate value large-scale, self-reported data mechanism rapidly address health crisis. think people never hypochondriacs realise powerful human brain is. young medical anxiety really bad, would read symptoms diseases experience full doctors took full blown tests assure it. people Germany diligent wearing masks? it’s still spreading? curious see there.

You may recall Trump saying virus would go gone Easter, even though knew case.

If taken real action back then, America would real change actually fighting thing. I’m talking fact. I’m talking conditions provided animal-to-human interaction. Go read article looking origin virus, many others, risk markets.

It happened 2003. Regulations put place didn’t remain place are. There’s guarantee would stopped anything, did, wouldn’t know pandemic wouldn’t happen.

Not countries types conditions extent.... regulation/culture/etc.

You focusing initial transmission argument controlling people interacting other, preventing spread, agree lot impossible.

Yes able control fact (from data shows) control happening? No. Could learned current technology history conditions likely allowed initial transmission occur could prevented? Yes.

Anyway, I’m done trying explain view title data provided far. People obviously critical can’t see flip side coin.

Healthcare capacity vital. i’m essential worker (grocery) life can’t get co-workers wear masks properly keep on. top take personally ask put on... feel like i’m hated everyone trying safe. it’s mentally exhausting, can’t imagine magnified feeling healthcare workers dealing front lines.. thanks do! think premise holds many insular groups, believe ignore rules apply society whole. Bruderhof, group Christians live number communal groups pretty much separated broader world strive see simple caring life Jesus told followers live, seem think behave way want. Justice karma dead called false dilemma. person grocery store one got infected look elsewhere. collapse choose, either ends tears extinction You’re literally comparing HIV Covid. That’s why. know funny part tho, people STILL say Covid basically like Common Cold. stupidity beyond point. yet Texas Abbot saying ""we've done great job containing virus let's open EVERYTHING UP."" I’m shop teacher custodians shop quite bit one asked go spray room new sanitizing sprayers. asked possible covid case said weren’t allowed disclose that.

I understand telling everyone person it, HIPPA everything, gonna ask someone go room might contaminated seems like right know. Johnny Bananas listed ""Dr. Hard Sums"", that's fucking priceless!! Silence golden Exactly, ability.. almost like made, ya know, purpose. season coming up! Many people every year, sometimes 100,000, despite Vaccine, die Flu. going close Country? No, learned live it, like learning live Covid, populations far less lethal!!!

Tweeted days ago. think guess tweeted it. happens government systematically divested public education system &amp; reallocated monies military. yet everyone survived ""rose garden chickenpox party"" lasting effects.  Including so-called ""high risk"" people like Chris Christie.  they're immune.

Ditch masks open economy. Granted, worked home long invested it.

But put much effort comfortable home. 

I'll grant you, cramped small space couple adults trying WFH kids trying remote learning comfortable.

But something fixable. worked home permanently could move somewhere cheaper rent (even different part city) get space. 

Even two adults working one spare bedroom together fine setup it. good affordable $100 basic computer desk. decent chair. Headphones mics use audio. could even run green sheet stapled 2x4 frame quasi privacy able better use virtual backgrounds.

You could spend $600 set basic WFH situation two that's still going effective office spare bedroom. 

While it, upgrade internet home fastest possible. surprised many co-workers super slow super expensive plans. Like $75 per month 10MB speeds crap like that. Basically paying per month able get 1GB down. Even ones available able save money upgrade speed quite bit time.

Most people's problem right struggling know ahead time would working home. prepared  also know permanent can't justify long term changes needed make better.

I've co-workers working kitchen table, sitting kitchen chairs day long (very uncomfortable) working 13 inch laptop screen. course miserable. Whatever Yevgeny mean putting someone medical profession's career line well. doubt medical staff that. weird outbreaks often revolve around religious gatherings people denying scientific evidence advice pack confined space masks contagious virus. almost devout religious belief encourages people disregard fact instead sacrifice fable, speculation, blind devotion ordained leaders. saying... rush judgement seeing hospitalization death. \*And Republicans Well, headline wrong.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* So, two old obese people easily survived COVID? thought death sentence! Trumps electoral path victory right there. lockdown, WFH, minimal going out, demand cosmetic decrease greatly hope charts 12 locales? chart MS, list statewide mask mandate, though MS targeting mask mandates affected counties well before. looking statewide data obscures effect might had. seems cherry picking data make charts suggest conclusion want us draw, show masks ineffective. 

The CDC released effect masks NPIs reducing spread Arizona. 

There [study](http://www.sfu.ca/university-communications/media-releases/2020/10/study--mask-mandates-shown-to-significantly-reduce-spread-of-cov.html) SFU suggesting effect Ontario. 

Further, far tell twitter profiles, one scientific background, much less one medicine infectious diseases. Remember would get bad July, August. Hmm, let's agree perpetual lockdown No, always biased Sweden. generally, no. mean lets face stage always herd imunity Hospital hallways mass graves. It’s sad see you’ve brainwashed conspiracy theories won’t take minimal precautions. hope trolling don’t end making one narcissistic videos saying didn’t believe family member died. neighbor nurse working directly covid patients, even get hazard pay. started working nursing home pays PLUS hazard pay. I’m wearing masks hiking forest one around. articles like wonder anti-maskers exist. Don’t hard one guy it, treason, millions it, mainstream party. Well know know that's complete bullshit. situation bad significant group people (I'd say around 20-30%) take corona corona measures seriously. Combined second highest population density Europe mandatory masks recipe disaster.

How hell would size country provide immunity lmao must really nice. miss wear mask faceshield every time step outside house. pandemic, people living rural areas way lucky us living huge cities. living south Chicago. 

*Ralph Wiggum voice*

I'm danger Sweden recommended self-imposed isolation start *all people (including kids) slightest symtom* recommending people stay home feel sick getting also paid needed. Quarantine would legal term except instead forced act, based personal responsibility. many countries quarantined people slightest bit symtom (including headaches, diarrhea, muscle pains, exhaustion, little bit sneezing etc) without sort known exposure also paid it? help particular person highest office land keeps reiterating debunked point. Burma.

You get hostile takeover country, rename benefit.

At least, anymore. 15-18% hospitalization rate issue, none countries prepared that, basically ability collapse health care system, kinda scary think it. understand downvotes though. trying help here, guys. No, older people stay home take precautions, help grocery delivery such. Things locked dec jan feb. Yes, feels little bit better.
But main anger stems fact Tegnell slow introduce measures all. Denmark example held Eurovison song contest March 7 without audience. Tegnell already knew virus spread superspreader events still thought okay 30 000 people audience Swedish Eurovision song contest Stockholm date. Add two rehersals lot audience too. wonder Sweden got lot virus spread early Stockholm surrounding regions. 

See e-mail March 6 governor said following: 

"". . . first-term Republican encouraged residents take “personal responsibility” choose. . . . We’re managing way path positive results, need little personal responsibility side.'""

First, encouraging populace leadership. People/populace group take personal responsibility. Individuals take personal responsibility individuals chose not, ever many reasons. Let’s equate Republican's abortion stance: ‘We need little personal responsibility, may suggest abort baby, aka wear mask?’ No, Republican would never say that! pro-life stance life life. Hypocrites. True? mean entire generation forced put lives hold them? Thats fair either January almost felt crazy... constantly refreshing r/china_flu keep reading new cases. Weirdly enough cherish times, weird amounts speculation crazy (now pretty tame) conspiracy theories you’d find r/coronavirus, conspiracy subreddit. Back 1,000 cases total extremely worrying we’re getting like 6,000 deaths day. remember getting arguments family kept trying downplay it, saying it’s like flu. Naturally, ones changed mind denied ever downplaying it, still family downplaying it...

In ten years guarantee dumbasses deny ever downplayed virus. always reply, ""You can't live fear either. Fear science dangerous. can't live fear... science."" muh rights! would say risk pretty low, fomite transmission seems much less prevalent airborne means. emphasis washing hands disinfecting surfaces common start pandemic knew much less virus. However, washing hands often good habit give peace mind. Yes, need go back normal sequestering *everyone*! Wow anti-semtic Hitler, pal.

FUCKING BIGOT would still hospitalized chance second week critical. first wave hit north area closer europe lombardy far populated region second density.
This wave diffuse, campania first density third population got 660 cases.

Lombardy 10 millions = 1100 cases
Campania 5.9 millions = 660 cases saw Worldometers 15 deaths today. population 750,000, that's rise 20 deaths per million. like Texas getting 600 deaths. South Dakota matching numbers North Dakota fairly soon. trajectory. also starting see spillover Montana, Wyoming even Nebraska. numbers rising too, maybe 1-3 weeks back per capita terms. sound mad TIL takes 2 months get sick COVID play Gov Cuomo's absolutely respect that. :)

Didn't mean seem ranty was. Exactly... studies satiate morons. Straight jail. trial. nothing. Finally food fckin comment. Deaths better indicator. know, new cases could reached 100k day March People raging, selfcentered idiots comes expected anything might benefit someone themselves.

Just ask whe hospitals overrun. resort insults name calling cannot make point honestly.

[It lemmings attach political ideology mask wearing party tells think. 

People naturally weak minded seek “belong” group sense comfort. Unfortunately, groups rob independent thinking. Social media made worse.

Sad true Normal always kind expected realistically around March April idk downvoted, kind ridiculous considering that’s actually optimistic great timeline Besides two ways said different, plenty others well. 

For example, attacks organs lungs differently. whole host weird-ass symptoms (covid toe, anyone?). Specific claims (I phone give studies want later):

-Being outside reduces risk 95% compared inside.

-Cloth masks around 60% effective.

Therefore, absolute minimum, (running outside maskless) much (~8x) safer running gym mask on.

On top that, state, don’t even need wear mask exerting gym! 

From purely harm reduction point view, encouraging gym goers exercise outside, mask off.

Next, state exertion “one worst things” provide source indicating actually problem.

Finally, Crossfitters love miserable don’t? I’ve tried running masks hate it. Given risks outdoor transmission low compared indoor, *nothing* indoor people present (I work alone curbside/delivery shopping), math I’m solidly problem. capable answering question honestly?

Should figured much way conducting yourself. positive case identified, contacts must reached next 24 hours, source.

Can done 26.000 cases day though? honestly understand downplayers purged sub.

I mean, may soon purged sub. way probably thought. Straight jail. trial. nothing. husband watching Texas football game apparently stands full? Also, isn’t Texas almost caught California case numbers? bought tickets, knew getting into. say, let 'em crash. Trump punished handling correctly? Fauci saying mask necessary? Cuomo letting go New York? study time ago showing never work.

I mean, here's study proves would work: people need help, medical day-to-day stuff bubble burst seconds.

not extensive mitigation methods testing, though. mention ignoring effect younger people dangerous.

it virtually 0 effect young people, need worry. That’s great news! would USA equivalent be? Honestly, would put anything past man. Given shape age, get better awfully fast. number times pushed Regeneron's mAb treatment since left hospital also suspect. know is/was faking it. simply feel fact even question appalling, state country. Yes, encouraging hate speech faking near death experience election two separate things, frightening; encouraging hate speech may frightening. Ok also people overplay virus. Yes coronaviruses seasonal rate mutation far higher one low rate mutation RNA virus. Meaning immunity likely last year.

While virus airborne it’s airborne it’s mostly transferred via droplets. truly airborne would spread similar r naught measles.

Finally it’s also deadly, particularly young people. mortality rate COVID19 roughly 0.5% flu 0.1%. publication standards primarily stop worst people publishing, best.

when blow doors media regulation mostly empower radicals previously suppressed media costs stricter publication standards.

With internet cost distribute media cheap there's regulatory factor. throw everything see sticks couple decades ago practical able afford endless amount media distribution able easily.

When deregulate media new medium comes underregulated mainstream benefits, extremists opportunists see benefit.

The pattern repeats even media new market emerges without enough regulation. Opportunistic people ones benefit most. Sometimes that's good, lot times winds exploitative predatorial that's mostly opportunistic accomplishes society. 

It's good opportunistic little tribe barely surviving, there's civilization society built around individual without relies cooperation, work well society. 

The opportunistic people greedy people get benefits patient people try make best get screwed. Nation wide 5700 133k swabs, approx 4%.
When lockdown enforced 2300 13000, 17% nationwide. lombardy 300 1300 23%. Staying home another person risks health sacrifice Dr Al-Rubaye said families forming pacts get tested. said stigma coronavirus, concerns job security isolate long periods time deterring people getting tested.

The stigma joke, gotten worse past two weeks. 

Now people find positive, might suspect unclean, Republican. money important repatriating 100000 Australians stuck abroad due caps incoming flights?

Edit: Sure. downvote pointing fact thousands citizens struggling return home. little, late...we need mandatory medical face-masks shutdown: schools, working home strict enforcement rules. Also dramatic upscaling testing capabilities professional contact tracing. post comment removed

Of course, 100% citizens agree restricted don’t see problem. substantial proportion against, perhaps live cramped spaces know negatively affect health, it’s longer clear cut. could tell Germans were.

The financial incentive things like RSV, HIV, etc mountains larger Sars-Cov-2. predicted start would commercial real estate hit. Idk im happy right. Full title ""Dutch offical, head ICU union, national treasure Diederik Gommers"" Mostly Africa Asia though. remember feeling indescribably distraught daily death toll Italy reached 300. back February. *glued* subreddit, one best ways find info progress COVID. living fantasy world. According logic, Vioxx scandal (insert scandal here) Merck exist. do. deeply saddening. slightly scary too. Teenagers dying too? I’m screwed. thing ""herd immunity"" coronaviruses. get reinfected CCCs every fade fast

Expected. Means nothing. reinfection cases fully documented already

They expected rare. 

Every virus known man documented cases re-infection. Even virus known create lifelong sterilizing immunity REINFECT rare many thousands anecdotal ones.

This means nothing. 

There thousands ancedotes Bigfoot too.

Even 10k people reinfected less 0.01% cases. Covid make happen? suspected coronaviruses typically short immunity. say suspicion confirmed now, people still give crap like true say despite confirmed now. Covid short lived immunity, reinfections happened, often worse first infection. rebuttal body learns fully accurate, ignoring fact reinfection worse first infection. bem doesnt mean be. Many thousands teh hand asymptomatic. isnt immunity perse, narrative would flawed begin with. bodies learn deal like virus common ones run president lies covid muzzled different guidelines western democracies.

Nah critical European policies well. imo Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Singapore handled well heavy emphasis masks. 1.5m distance latter bullshit according known effective, CDC even knew, white house shut plan masks sent every american got rid requirement using travel. Why? Worries scaring people economy best guess.

In NL Dutch equal CDC still discard masks effective barely effective. narrative also strengthened ""Against"" arguments people since basically government saying correct right? exactly issue whole pandemic. Dont get wrong saying serious. Governments drop ball directly gave ammo conspiracy theorists make use off. Doctor House care shit. expect peak 10k cases, countermeassures started get implemented again.

Thats problem 2nd waves: Corona almost gone, fucking idiots pretented completely gone went vaction, party, etc.  Child marriages bad, death. info increase/decrease testing? said before, $$ survive. private-driven system even suck d*** recovering. essential workers making less $80 k, well.. may right medicine you, even better, do, call insurance company first ask permission.   Yeah, theories. facts. That's point. like mask guy. state fact lockdowns helped. fact, theory, honestly think needs data. I'd say data pointing towards masks driving factor killing spread, look SE Asia. things still debatable. I'm sick people acting holier thou, they're ones ""got right"" others not. know many fucking people know like ended getting virus? joke. Ruled world? What? idea about. political, mental health. Pretty much every day we're seeing increase hundreds, recently goes high +500 per day. 
At rate we'll 10k/day week's time—reminder NL population *17 million*; seriously tiny.

These numbers absolutely insane gov still sitting ass nothing, repeatedly proclaiming change come people. 
How setting ground rules above, people excuse follow them, point rules people behaving irresponsibly? vote live U.S must around 80's then. absolutely dominated times. happen. 0.000% never believe plot point anymore.

No american president would nuke city contain major threat. absolutely liability here, serous issue vaccine company toast. one buy Pfizer product fear saftey. Even executives would able sell stock fast enough get out. reason companies banded together made statement saftey.

Also people developing vaccine real people would want use themselves, gives huge incentive get right. Look here's one Maybe stop acting like baby  agree you. comment referring people. people made even minimal sacrifice together, we’d mess now. Bruh, ikr. mean covid could literally evolve wierd leopracy causing mutation Americans still claim made believe hoax trump call gift god comes mob. Open sewers lack toilets help.

Swine Flu ""NEW"" VIRUS.

2009 swine flu descendant H1N1 1918 Spanish Flu. 


The 2009 ""Swine Flu"" vaccine basically year's flu shot.


There going mass vaccination year. Solid chance none next year.

The fastest development vaccine human history 4 years.

Most 10 years. going stop. many people incapable takes. okay. Europe learn either. Seriously. Even masks travel restrictions state country level begining would nearly stopped tracks. think brave folks way work every day. work big-box store feel unsafe. think can't face another day fear remember hard all. think types places work probably spreading it, promise telling everyone listen please careful. Oh okay, 6 days introducing first measures. pedantry better you?  infected matters well. got nursing homes within network older people deaths started skyrocket. yes, sadly USa carries great influence , current regime everything accelerate spread. pressions exercited religious extremists cult places churches function, pilgrimages, need small businesses survive across western world. veryy exceptions, failed impose safety measures real efficiency. still find staggering monumental faliure masks made mandatory anywhere outside house early march example. That's lyin' dumb donnie says...  Fuck Thanks advice Fauci I'll go wherever want wear (or wear) whatever want. disease 1 order magnitude worse flu, needs IFR 1%

Not really. suppose depends definition ""worse"", think take contagious account well. 

If ALSO contagious flu (my understanding pretty universally considered so), kill 10X many people even death rate 10X much. 

And that's even taking account parts ""worse"" like hospitalizations, long-term damage, etc. Unless plan provide free phone upgrades everyone needs one

I attempt math, given cost pandemic, even cost contact tracing, might make sense. tough administer, though. lol works. 

do u even basic statistics bro? Oh gosh please stop it. can't people understand NZ's approach applicable part Europe (bar Iceland, maybe)? Good decision. rest world follow suit. People like reason grandma might die within next years guess let die? thought process? 

Yeah. we'll literally kill seem fair rather treat bad faith arguments are. Try visiting Florida...then understand. think emerge better normal this, take time. thing deaths usually 2 weeks infection. delays reporting. Also, excess deaths would necessarily statistically significant early stages. 

If first infection started mid February doubling time 3 days would still take month 1000 cases. math correct it’s since high school exponential growth. You’d probably need another 2 weeks number deaths high enough significant beyond chance maybe another 2 weeks deaths reported. It’s surrogate I’m sure indication correlation. I’d venture guess current case count US underestimates actual infection count. 

I’d say Canada lesser degree.  friend works grocery store wears mask day.

She go ER bacterial lung infection severe pneumonia.

She blames masks.

Any truth this?

It seems weird. Spanish government declared state emergency Madrid surrounding region combat rising cases coronavirus.

It follows ruling high court Madrid Thursday, rejected measures forced region central government, including partial lockdown Spanish capital nine neighbouring municipalities.

The move Friday Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government takes immediate effect last two weeks. forces authorities Madrid restore travel restrictions brought government struck court measures mean non-essential trips capital nine suburbs prohibited, affecting 4.8 million also mean renewed restrictions bars restaurants, stores, sports venues, gyms hairdressers -- limit six number people able meet public private.

Spain's interior minister said 7,000 police would deployed enforce restrictions. Officers duly began carrying checks Friday.

The government wanted act quickly Monday public holiday wanted prevent thousands city-dwellers heading area weekend.

Emergency follows court ruling
-

The state emergency declared national government latest twist tug-of-war Madrid authorities efforts fight spread coronavirus, region experiencing one Europe's worst outbreaks.

It followed Thursday's successful legal challenge officials capital restrictions imposed centre-left national coalition led Sanchez's Socialist Party Unidas Podemos.
-

Madrid's conservative regional government opposed constraints, saying draconian hurt economy. argued moderate measures enough fight virus.
-

The court agreed, saying restrictions freedom could introduced without bringing state alarm. 

It ""rejected ratification (of measures), harmed fundamental rights freedoms"" 4.5 million inhabitants affected partial lockdown, came force week ago, court said statement.

The national government said late Thursday night Sánchez spoken telephone Madrid's conservative regional premier Isabel Díaz Ayuso gave ultimatum. Sánchez reportedly told Ayuso quickly tighten measures make formal request national government declare state emergency, government would go ahead declare anyway.

A state emergency gives national government extraordinary powers time crises temporarily limit constitutional rights citizens. case, limits freedom movement restarting perimeter controls Madrid nearby towns also suffering high contagion rates.

COVID-19 power struggle
-

Ayuso previously unwilling implement harsher COVID-19 measures arguing would cause damage economy, Thursday asked inhabitants leave city.

""We ask residents leave Madrid follow health recommendations, especially coming days extended weekend,"" said, referring national holiday Monday.

Spain's national government ordered two weeks new restrictions started 10 pm last Friday week ago, despite pushback regional officials.

But Madrid's autonomous authority clashed Spain's central government order, saying would comply would simultaneously challenge courts.

Madrid leading resurgence virus Spain, Europe’s highest cumulative caseload — 870,000 confirmed cases since onset pandemic. 

The surge cases Spanish capital hit hospitals hard, officials saying 40% region's ICU capacity used treat COVID-19 patients.

The bickering Madrid’s conservative-led government Sánchez, leader Socialist Party, angered many Spaniards find petty use public health tragedy political skirmishing. Gross negligence parents. get there, it’s kind refreshing, quite entertaining. 

Doing 3.5 month road trip around country helped cement position though interacting Americans over, see would take others bit longer get there. really don’t think that’s attitude. trend right makes news sign company thinks pandemic headed. many companies going fully remote. Many people want get back office, aren’t going anywhere. 

Yea, headline misleading, even misleading employees office workers. guys hell bent proving Darwin right Dummies throw jail. included “Sweden” title. people haven’t heard city, although kinda deduce approx “å”. Plus plenty islands remote, helicopter evac would probably doable.

I actually agree that. island close probably need full-time doctor residence anyway. shit sherlock noticed another factor people-watching. Unhappiness. Especially among lower end economic scale. People frustrated lives, daily struggle. feel little control world. people likely latch onto something like 'muh rights'. know improve lives, control. bad, sure country thinking instead that's related how? Florida become bit safe again? Lack travel summer seems slowed everything there. March: recommendation July: imagine would everyone wore masks months back March.. probably would well instead thousands dying every day. Well yeah, infected ideally. fact able get easily shows corrupt government is. Trump even said knows ceo reached personally it. “How many countries quarantined people slightest bit symtom”

 ... would pretty much everyone. 

With addition unlike Sweden countries also realize asymptomatic spread real thing. good friend mine attitude it, caught January (with job absolutely explain exposure early, think tested antibodies something), doesn’t elderly relatives still living worried (or kids), isn’t part high risk group. So. try remember totally different thing him. could probably test more, third highest testing rate per capita world (behind Israel UK). radically accept covid stuff, I've got long way go cheer on. Around 15% cases land hospital country. yes, discounting avoid getting tested - countries mostly weak symptoms. Yeah, giving birth something men great First time here? literally answer question. I'm asking Sweden lockdown, that's literally irrelevant. I'm asking measures taken countries unreasonable. actually answer that? I’ll preface saying speaking strictly personal burnout perspective yes, bigger picture 210,000 lives lost US alone. 
I don’t know care much Trump deniers say, still deeply get me. COVID patient routine I’m longer afraid like months ago. every day bombarded news opinions isn’t real shouldn’t “let control lives.” Well, “freedom” pick choose scientific theories convenient life affect countless colleagues mine. months ago heroes, we’re fear mongers blow COVID proportion. I’ve listened patients give denial spiel, immediately walked prone paralyzed COVID patient’s room afterward. took care dying patient originally refused treatment besides oxygen... ultimately ended dying. video chat patient passed, family STILL denied COVID called “liberal conspiracy.” personal emotional burnout. can’t one. No. gave 4.4% March, hasn’t publicly updated since. No, realists. last time checked NBA good season. Baseball joke NFL postponing games every week considering suspending season. they? get insider info? understanding they’re closing neighborhood hotspots. even really cold yet, get worse. get you, hard reply statements like that!! College students go home infect middle aged parents. Oh no. Maybe 4 5 get sick. 

That scary. love people assume things others UK also 1%. world countries young population (lkke India countries Africa) lower average. fair, imagine significant portion parents homeschool kids public education crappy. perform life sustaining task required survival? Yes.

It necessary. curbside delivery. minor fee (&lt;$5). Worth help slow spread. said don't. Put straw man away want adult conversation

You actually said do. Found neckbeard.

But again, Reddit.... lack credible info shortages

Yeah took till June people realize sending infected people nursing homes bad idea. CUOMO MURPLY NY NJ implemented heavy restrictions numbers past months greatly improved


While economy sinks around 200k confirmed cases NY right now.


Oh confirmed cases!!! doesn’t even take account NY NJ way open reporting, whereas Florida taken steps limit reporting obfuscate numbers.


If insane conspiracy Florida ""hiding"" half COVID-19 deaths still would less deaths per capita NY NJ keeping state substantially open.


So metric FL worse NY/NJ.

I'll wait. definitely say ""if get COVID 80% chance life altering set lingering symptoms"" (and neither person speaking originally). read last sentence comment, think find agrees point severity initial symptoms agree principles said Declaration find completely appalling expression (or other, non-violent) view censored platform. textbook second wave. contrast US many different regions different responses meant first wave never really ended, EU cases death tiny fraction first wave...

enough people longer take seriously, rules discarded everybody still trying get summer vaction. Fucking idiots. Even coworkers smart. ""But drive north sea, like fly somethere"" - skipping sea one summer option. it’s fucking trash, maybe? kids going go home Thanksgiving break winter break, infected turn infect loved ones. isn’t hard understand, make effort wrap brain cells around idea. 0.1% CFR flu. IFR estimated 0.01% normal flu, 0.02% swine flu.  Yeah. teacher ever say ""focus others"" little kid? exactly why. tattle naughty kid sitting next many times, eventually forget *own* actions, start winding trouble yourself. I'm *flabbergasted* much people numb basic advice remembered elementary school. read study.

First, create estimated control group:

*The synthetic control group thereby constructed estimated weighted average regions masks become compulsory earlier on.*

So made control. Even then:

*Expressed differently, daily growth rate number infections decreases 1.32 percentage points per day*

The found measured 8% reduction transmission 2019 review found reduction indistinguishable *random chance*.

So study failed read yielded results contrived control indistinguishable luck.

Read more. Post less. fucking moron long kicked WH.. many different times need see virus spiral control actually believe it?

It’s virus March. don’t like call people stupid, I’m struggling come another description people think nothing virus magically problem. live Cambridge, (basically Boston, side river) go blocks without passing anyone. really even busy downtown right now. Trolling like going make dick bigger sorry. Allele Biotechs claim fluorescent protein used R&amp;D needs give approval drug doesn’t protein frivolous. defend Orthodox, Conservative Reform Jews everyone else blocked me.

I problem insular religious groups cause tensions surrounding communities. doesn’t matter it’s Hasidic Jews, Jehovah’s Witnesses, Fundamentalist Latter Day Saints, etc. exact critiques insular religious groups, it’s Hasidic people relevant current time. bought way name brand networking. 

I personally doubt elite education dramatically better state whatever. That’s said supposedly. Obviously though - conceited idiot in, conceited idiot out. possible myocarditis covid.

This relatively unheralded complication scares well. understanding, direct symptoms would awaken virus taking hold heart muscle, potentially fatal cardiac arrest nowhere. read early literature suggesting many 10% COVID patients level heart involvement. live New York City literally everything said crock shit. point hold man accountable attempted genocide?  Definitely this, dumb treat economy health populace zero-sum situation (aka, either one both).

The economy still shambles people afraid go spend virus everywhere.

If do-over, mandate enforce proper mask wearing everywhere (absolutely required), nip conspiracy theorists bud start, strongly recommend social distancing, recommend place closures. 


I strongly believe done mask wearing right shutdown indoor dining maybe school tots, would scoffing COVID-19 right now.  Depends air sars sure. Asbestos free hope. possible fall country

Where pull ass from?

Like country going fall over? care society general, truly every man days obvious signs say can? countries locked early hard better. may actions actually little impact course virus takes

This wishful thinking defies logic. know SARS-COV-2 transmitted, know steps take limit transmission. virus isn’t sentient creature—if block routes infection wearing masks staying away people, can’t catch taxi, swim walls, pick gun get way. mechanics seasonality interesting, sure, nothing combatting novel pandemic, mysterious black magic. incredible. 

As in: literally believe it. Even care Tool, they're among talented musicians popular music. Wait, What? I’m fairly certain agreement... I’ve steadfast social distancing, wearing masks, getting groceries pick up...I haven’t seen family 8 months. angry going right back started people lazy selfish. Kill poor live area moderate climate. Churches shut awhile (gotta love diocese Denver’s 28 min streaming mass 😂) mass outside, likely continue starts get rainy month. people parish don’t want go back indoor services. (Still wearing masks outside, &amp; handshakes exchange sign peace.) Anyone familiarity industry tell it’s likely effective. isn’t second grade logic test, it’s empirical evidence based complex statistics. drugs fail phase 3 trials alone. doesn’t matter positive press release is. People always forget this. take active cases (heck, \*10 fun) divide province/state's population. Ontario;

Rounding 6000 active cases \*10 =60,000.
