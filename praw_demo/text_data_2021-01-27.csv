Anyone even little understanding scientific method vs stages vaccine testing see extremely safe able make public all.  Um... deaths? Nice! side effects next 2 days, days 9 10 overall bad difference value life. difference teacher took job teach, daycare. public health emergency teachers ones line provide babysitting service. Daycare workers signed exactly job decision continue theirs. Closing schools would still result reduction exposure people work home others could possibly opt stay home 2 income households. Reducing exposure key here. also reserve like gas helium. Hope there's longterm affects kids tho amirite said time it’s total time contact person increases risk. So, would say standing register mask on, behind plastic screen 3-minutes would much lower risk classroom poor ventilation kids hours end. mention, kids don’t best control masks, somehow put risk equation. I’m nurse practitioner (NP) many years internal medicine question “non-steroidal anti-inflammatory” medications Tylenol (acetaminophen) ibuprofen understandably coming time. Many people take pain, headaches, fever, arthritis. people taken dose getting vaccine worried maybe cancelled blunted effect going miss benefits vaccination. valid concern, research date shows it’s probably minor one. 

According literature, appears still fully clear answer question over-the-counter medications “maybe” blunting vaccine effect. Specifically question NSAIDS “non-steroidal anti-inflammatory” medications examples acetaminophen (Tylenol) ibuprofen (Advil). literature I’ve found far, experts I’ve asked seem indicate little concern. According literature (there’s lot subject) blunting body’s response first vaccine, appears effect disappears booster immunization, body “catch up.” (Get second shot!) meantime, people aware concern seems ideal avoid taking medications getting vaccine, need take require medical condition, continue regimen don’t live fear interfere much vaccine response. Make sure get booster one recommended according product receive. 

For want research, looked around bit found mentions animal studies pursuing thread didn’t really yield helpful information. 2016 literature review helpful opinion:

“Observational studies reporting antipyretic use around time immunization concluded use affect antibody responses. randomized clinical trials demonstrated blunted antibody response unknown clinical significance. effect noted following primary vaccination novel antigens disappears following booster would nice specific answers over-the-counter medications, enough data available yet. seem concerning hope sleep well tonight.  **Jan. 28, 00:00 (UTC+9)**

UK supply Covid vaccine ‘more needed’

Britain could donate jabs countries

Sean O’Neill, Chief Reporter | Chris Smyth, Whitehall Editor | Bruno Waterfield, Brussels

Thursday January 28 2021, 12.00am, Times

Britain enough coronavirus vaccines year could eventually donate countries, senior industry sources told Times last night.

They said Britain secured doses needed meet targets expected deals pharmaceutical companies honoured.

It came Boris Johnson said confident EU threats disrupt supplies would fail. bloc’s vaccination rate lagging far behind Britain’s Brussels accused Astrazeneca, one biggest suppliers, reneging delivery agreements. called supplies company’s British factories diverted Europe.

It marks escalation deepening post-Brexit conflict included German threats block exports Pfizer’s vaccine factory Belgium Britain. senior German MEP warned stand-off heading towards “trade war”.

At Downing Street press conference Mr Johnson sought cool war words insisting manufacture must “great multinational effort”.

The industry source dismissed demands Brussels divert British supplies “political rhetoric”.

“They cannot stop vaccines contracted delivery. vaccines already given people due receive second dose.

“It would human rights issue millions people process stopped,” said.

Britain’s move secure vaccine contracts pharmaceutical companies approved given head start. total 367 million doses ordered, enough 5.5 per person. Times told: “There plenty vaccine. exceeds government wants do.”

One objective Britain’s vaccine task force always contribute supply lower income countries. Norway also pledged donate stock poorer nations.

Britain vaccinated 13 per cent adults EU average 2 per cent, gap growing. Astrazeneca vaccine, developed Oxford University, expected approved European Medicines Agency week. Astrazeneca says vaccines NHS part separate supply chain EU. Britain signed contracts three months Brussels time smooth glitches.

The bulk vaccine produced Britain proportion imported Netherlands. Stella Kyriakides, European health commissioner, demanded jabs produced Britain domestic use sent EU, causing huge disruption NHS vaccination programme.

In talks last night Ms Kyriakides due tell Astrazeneca legally obliged use two British factories make shortfall 70 million doses EU. “There’s priority clause,” said. “We reject logic ‘first come, first served’. may work neighbourhood butcher contract. contract specified country UK priority signed earlier.”

A spokesman Astrazeneca said last night’s meeting “constructive open conversation complexities scaling production vaccine”.

The British government believes contracts Astrazeneca give right first 100 million doses produced Britain. Asked Ms Kyriakides’s demands, Mr Johnson said: “We’re confident suppliers, we’re confident contracts we’re going ahead basis.” added: “The creation vaccines result international exchange, international partnerships distribution vaccines around world also going great multinational international effort.”

The row raises prospect Brussels putting pressure Pfizer, Europe-based vaccine producers, cut shipments Britain. Peter Liese, German MEP member European parliament’s health committee, told Euronews European citizens “treated second class UK-based company, think consequence immediately stop export Biontech. middle trade war. company UK better think twice.” Lol no. You’re severely underestimating fucking stupid brainwashed significant portion population is. Sure, normal people “skeptical” change becomes even painfully obvious dumb skepticism is, you-know-who’s easily swayed reality they’ve already rejected.  Don’t get arms. It’s Americas. America’s. That’s thinking. thing forces air apply patients certain ailment unless doesn’t job? It’s like ventilators made COVID. Yeah many people want keep going. sucks refuse admit privilege pandemic instead pretend want shut greater good. Like no, vaccines horror we’ve gone through, need move on.

I want permanent WFH options though. hope people push offices give options instead insisting everyone graduating class 3400 average class size 30-40 depending portable classroom real one. makes proud things shit America, it, acknowledge it, criticize hell ourselves. always strange things going bad another country sometimes person country might deflect say 'well least things bad America'. may true, bit odd way handle whatever shitstorm happening locally them.

I'm generalizing course, I've noticed Reddit.

Anyway, I'm also you. spent lot last year embarrassed ashamed take stricter measures. Unfortunately, can't change past, lot lives lost. However, I'm looking forward easing restrictions getting back normal year. I'm happy I'm Texas state fairly lax restrictions. realize lax restrictions best everyone, personally, I'm looking forward day mask mandate lifted I'm guessing we'll beat lot world punch. bet mask companies want sell masks. US 40%of deaths two continents. Wear mask. Im wondering, true, told loss smell/taste common symptom anymore cough, muscle pain, sore throat. damage, isn’t attacking brain/nerves now? yes, endeavor get vaccine need first dont throw away help it. big classrooms? I’ve seen class 20, that’s graduating class 1600 plus.  link? Except stores policies place employees get paid quarantine wait test results exposure without dipping vacation. time off. school districts know aren’t extending courtesy teachers. I’m disgusted way NJ handling things. really thought going keep us safe Superintendent terrified fucking parents gonna whatever loudest screamers want true.

AstraZeneca one blame due incompetence. failed massively getting things ready end, even hundred millions euros front investment production capacity alone. 2%, 10% even 25% cut acceptable, cut deliveries 60% massive failure, screams extreme incompetence AstraZeneca team. 

Also communications screams incompetence. Notifying EU week approval cut 59 million doses. means EU still track 80 million doses Q1, suddenly became 31 million. things happen suddenly advanced stage process. prior warnings, smaller cuts even notice might problems. communications all.

The EU pass blame, already fact 100% AstraZeneca's fault. EU cut deliveries 60% last notice AstraZeneca? AstraZeneca complete sh*t show currently. particular type sea squirt used make Aplidin, called Aplidium albicans, found waters around Spanish island **Ibiza** 

&amp;#x200B;

Side effects might include **techno dancing, shoulders hand movement, laughing 160 bpm, euphoric behavior predisposition dress neon colors.**  It’s 70% though, it’s closer 90% give one half dose followed full dose. 70% figure give two full doses they’re anymore. surprising. ace hardware work for. (Theyre individually owned operated) I'll honest, know, that's I'm advocating first place. People already ditching masks right now. go store Texas south see that. 

I think encouraging people get vaccinated saying they're going able go back normal problem, provides good incentive people fence. people decide ditch mask, probably would regardless, social messaging much effect behavior regardless.  plan would obviously return normal everyone chance vaccinated immunity kick in. guarantees vast majority people get sick.

We yet. Double masks, pride inflates feel even better yourself. everyone else starts wearing two, wear three. 

Really, think time start getting people psychiatric help. get things actually help people, like charity work. Maybe could go work soup kitchen three masks. also thought dallying fingers haggling lower prices winning strategy, instead know, throwing money manufacturers get going set production time.

Now nerve turn around blame production problem manufacturers. Remember delivered promises US UK respectively Q4 2020? That's expected circumstances. EU ordered later, delays happening now. Instead owning mistakes start whining threatening steal prepared advance.

I get EU anger AZ warning ahead times delays, that's water bridge. Everything else EU scum. Lol 100%. knew gonna problem long initial lockdown us NYC metro area. 

The amount times kid came ""allergies"" entire class came ""allergies"" less two days. 

Regular people know either kid two, classful, work office things spread amongst adults like schools. ""Normal"" folks get live normal circumstances. 

But teachers know cold destroy classroom 48 hours, pandemic Worst Case Scenario. Once, kid sneeze Circle Time every last one us got sick time within hours following night. believed either happened multiple times eight year career.

Teachers knew. society listen. really know teachers come back mentally, knowing little truly respected. turns masks really work all. Unless double triple mask,

Woah, source that? fucked up. would tearing super new one. amazing quote, totally going use COVID done second waiting period finishes get vaccine. worried mutations variants all. know news people want extend pandemic long possible I'm good, I'm crowdsurfing second finish 2 week mark second shot. shut schools last year 3000 new cases day. 200k new cases day things somehow ok? Seems like people given trying anything pandemic. Sad. Quick question: know evidence vaccine protects vaccinated person severe forms COVID. far know, still definitive evidence vaccine eliminates transmission vaccinated person - infected - another person. Would possible vaccinated person get virus (the vaccine prevent catching virus, far know) pass unsuspecting Icelander? missing? key mutations Brazilian one (aka P.1) fairly similar South African one, would expect similar effect there. Ah gotcha. Awesome! I’m moment see number cases city. It’s know bad is. I’ve seen news hospitals bigger cities starting problems though. think they're legally required supplies hand treat reaction. got mine made us wait monitoring area 15 minutes leaving. mention teachers quarantined whatever reason, there's nobody replace them. substitutes. think would want substitute right now. train wreck. mRNA turns revolutionary invention!

Not COVID-19, already multiple sclerosis even cancer treatments pipeline using mRNA. Indeed. know I'm gonna get dozen times, want first time prepped ground vaccine. 


I objecting language 'letting hang around long'. around evolving forever, really want exponential burn naive population. I'd love go wife girlfriend, dont think they'd appreciate much... reviews really bad justify fuckup response? could’ve closed borders seen similar success, right? epidemic decided finish getting credentials. know, lot vaccine ""missing"". in, crates vaccine taken trucks loading docks sold used someone's social circle. Imagine tens thousands doses getting required refrigeration, going waste. could used feedback. I’m generally type person worries things covid same. Today, walking building double mask opened door another person walking mask on. basically face face second timing. continued walk around immediately. Would potential encounter could get covid? I’m getting vaccine volunteer two sessions vaccine distribution Bell County, TX two weeks. excited!! Advantages here: it’s traditional vaccine already two approved. don’t need go dog pony show time around. People want get moving now. first two took month could take two weeks. Could. favorite word recently. screwup. con job. Kickback City. death penalty level corruption.

We could least try wait shred evidence anything incompetency throwing around things like death penalty. 3M model KN95 N95. ideally n95 better IMO  mean guy said basically. COVID fake previously thought could significantly effect efficacy virus (based study mention article) appears minor impact 2 year old better mask control lot brainwashed assholes see schools. work school district lot people care. maddening. “Africanized honey bees” virology schools manufacturing plants same. Let's say send home 8th graders. logic spread 7th graders unused classrooms, right? 

Wrong. There's one supervise still *one* teacher time. 

Use assistant? Nope. county currently 240 open assistant positions. 

Use subs? Nope again. district trying attract subs saying they'd able get vaccine earlier. work. need *hundreds* subs *a day* get. 

It's okay know things. okay basically calling teachers liars arguing class sizes. 

Sit down. millions people getting every day one growing gills it’s pretty hard stupid enough it. really, masks better others GREAT results! vaccine made? Well, lot deaths without heavy restrictions. NZ then? winters anything ""balmy"" yet response ranked #1.

Also, winter Sydney ""mild"", balmy. Even though comparatively short, warm enough outside time. murder hornets super massive big deal... Since I've home kids anyhow, considered homeschooling approach. realized kids want take seriously teacher. least sit lot online instruction, help/teach understand content they're weak with, learned lot learn strengths weaknesses. eye opening experience say least.

Also seen lot deficiencies school system too. busy single working parent, previously, assumed well world. know I'll involved school much if/when get back meaningful job. I've downvoted banned saying providing studies offered evidence it. People want believe anything goes conceded thought processes are. living age cognitive dissonance. sooo Easter?  drives crazy too. Happy Cake Day though! arguing children high risk covid death. that's true. one unwilling take risk level covid presents children, would never leave house. living this, too, friend. students take standardized test didn’t count anything state already paid test. Failures online in-person. Students incapacitated anxiety. alone. tough tell article, truly opened hospital staff's friends/family last minute jab doses expire, that's one thing. opened executives donors friends family, completely different. born Peach, flip wrong georgia lately?? Im thankful grandparents arent lving this😭  we've exposed vaccinated, cases usually mild, endemic viruses. current problem virus *novel*. N95 = US

KN95 = China

KF94 = Korea

FFP2 = Europe

These offer equivalent levels protection, scammers selling cheap, pretty much useless versions them. Europe look FFP2, find masks labelled N95 ones likely fake (because N95 common search term). I'm hoping globalization drive industrialized nations take vaccination developing world seriously. pandemic taught us anything, way contain anything spreads easily long. outbreak spreads enough one country bound go global.

I hope force leaders make funds materials available get global populace vaccinated reasonable timeframe. live wealthy district lot resources area people generally taking thing pretty seriously. grateful. Unless president, anything fair game. mean, look her. Inbred least five gens mug. no, child mortality rate covid roughly two orders magnitude less older folks. everyone rate, would less worrisome flu. know 0.00% within error bars child covid mortality rate? dont personally believe anything government regime. much arent perfect. took 100 years declare eradication polio US. never believed covid would year, dont believe it'll control summer. obviously made leaps bounds medically probably wont take us 100 years control covid. doesnt take away hope helps patient think countries eradicated covid19, think again. cannot even get rid common cold Antarctica halfway winter gonna virus. Mankind extremely arrogant think eradicate them. basically first admit read sources provide. made slippery slope argument: ""japan bad california therefore must great!""

You facts, logical fallacies. What's point arguing simpleton like you? trust N95 KN95 many KN95 don’t meet standards. read test reports news many KN95 literally similar cloth mask terms protection.  Yeah what. mask more?  one people manage catch COVID getting second shot dumb things still pandemic. sure think 100% immune. Yeah, meant sound frightening. Media allowed anything fearmonger. this. People ITT way libertine life individual vaccination. That’s epidemics end; need case numbers *community spread* fall jumping back regular life. might look different one city next. I’m vaccinated according people going Applebee’s movie theaters putting kids swim class. ain’t going fucking happen city shows community spread way down. 

I. am. tired. like everyone else. anxiety isolation issues burnout like everyone else. months seeing case counts come vulnerable among us get vaccinated everyone else (like husband) fucking worth it. Could agree more. punching (or even sideways) needs stop. Parents fault options kids they've got choice work person (or even demanding position home)... Teachers fault wanting work person, either. intractable, tough situations exactly government elect competent people good character lead it. Pzifer recipient here, symptoms 2nd dose thus far. Got morning. Milder sore arm slight fatigue. We’ll see next 24 hours go though  Corruption exist system, is. think rhetorical question &amp; become deadly &amp; means us would like ten that’s complete utter failure contain it, hospital overwhelm
popping random locations reach “herd immunity” naturally euphemism total failure. baseline defined number deaths likely occurred influenza outbreak occurred.

Pretty important detail considering japan extremely bad flu can't read titles scientific papers. details difference ""we cure cancer"" ""we cure cells dish high controlled lab"".

This detail also show excess mortality August October, 2020 estimated 12 104.

Excess deaths (despite qualifiers) detected rising since last fall. third wave completely ignored study. NY. Kids class since September teachers eligible sign many say appt still months away. worth though claimed trace amount spread occurred inside schools. Nothing major all. Half capacity, masks, etc seem effective. US weeeee bit plugged global economy Vietnam. assuming live developed country, last time heard polio, measles rabies?

Last year. Thanks CCP going us end time. Simple mutations concern these; spreads likely get recombination event different coronavirus (similar event lead SARS-COV-2 first place). Teacher parent here. teach large high school, managing; however, teachers, students, administrators- exhausted. worry every day bringing infection home. really lucky, many Covid tests seek pay for, sometimes taking work so. Many teachers teaching hybrid classes - person online time, many given mornings planning periods teach additional classes would normally teach. Right now, information provided additional sick days Spring, quarantine (sick not), use sick days. don’t paid maternity leave, teachers returned sick days left (five days cover half quarantine), sick days gone, paid days take off. Many teachers already precarious financial positions anyway, pay losses medical bills would exacerbate that. Right word receiving vaccine. us conflicted: teachers want classroom teaching kids, expense families. boils working class fighting responsibilities should’ve taken care state federal governments: people paid stay home months, none would issue. I’m sorry parents, teachers, students, administrators, custodians get paid enough battle Covid-exposed classrooms - better system top place. Georgia really doesn’t matter. It’ll everywhere whether tell population not. know bringing notion believing everything Fauci says like he's god remotely said implied, since reasonably assume since believe process ongoing, expect things change future.

As flipping script, almost like he's politically hamstrung edged process knowledge situation far limited really needed be. Doug Ford late November: “Look states south us want ignore regulations — they’re blowing up,” said. “They mobile morgues driving around Texas collecting bodies. that’s wake-up call, don’t know is.”

Doug Ford January: “I can’t help ask president,” Ford said. “The least thing ... give us million vaccines. hundred million there. Give great neighbor stands shoulder shoulder million vaccines get us hump. That’s would love see president.” say many things... profit means lots stuff. quite deceptive phrase many instances Stay daily thread stick around. tend positive rest sub. know many business struggled find associates. even close minimum wage, person. Mostly 100s apply never show interview first day. Teachers want return school.. safely.. everyone pay cost vaccines. Astrazeneca said making profit Lisbon Treaty kept re-voting got result wanted? Naw slim. Teachers hate shit. They'll go back. really question? It’s called facts...actual fucking facts. Sure, need studies it, reason know called *science*. No... Thanks. I’ve dealt lot feelings regarding work since testing positive, watching 1 2.5 year old get it. Even kept telling people, schools safe. something attached article data experiment... oh wait, is! hear ya. I'm single dad two young kids unemployed school home. yeah, complete cluster too, least USA around. think wrong. comes garbage in, garbage out, garbage lingering around waistline. Eating healthy food small quantities benefit body eating junk food small quantity. stabilize blood sugar mood make active able burn calories. Lockdowns vaccinations day sooner. point moot. smell strong sense privilege here. may sound optimistic, think people surprised quickly normalcy returns.

All major industrial nations world ramping major, effort produce distribute vaccines, sparing expense employing basically everything know production, logistics public education.

Additional, easier produce distribute options like Astrazenecca coming online, getting promising practical data places like Israel critically US administration making winning battle absolute priority. 

Based rapidly vaccination rates increasing, think largely sorted middle year.

When humanity actually sorts shit collectively focuses problem, stuff gets done extremely well extremely fast. Congress needs pass federal law ASAP permanently bans schools workplaces requiring coercing attendance sick quarantined individuals. leaver, enjoying watching unfold politically. enjoying human level though. Well, actually know number it’s every hospital record country know someone works hospital becomes obvious that... You’re wrong, I’m saying far worse anyone realizes! number dead early January America 3 Million rose quickly point don’t know it’s pretty much fully confirmed 2020 literally highest death toll current history America since least maybe civil war completely fucked counted fraction really get it! fun sounds, I’m willing bet outlier. full overrun hospitals

Are fucking serious? chairman Japan Medical Association pointing healthcare collapse happening everywhere. actual fuck? shouldn’t lump conservatives like that. know plenty received vaccine already, many people left wing won’t get it. ...you think 10 people got second dose day? Remember “twindemics” freaking August/September? back person month now. 27% student body fully virtual per parent choice. panic every time get tickle throat headache. okay this. Every student school teach laptop. fully virtual. parents pushing back hard private school. diocese work worked damn hard keep us safe. lose/lose situation. mean, really change fact companies let go thousands employees. openings retail stores change much. things updating day. projected today could change tomorrow data rolls in. I've tried reply comment twice AutoMod keeps saying I'm ""political."" wear mask everywhere go probably support causes do. 

In case (staying topic), comment providers call first responders doses going waste, wealthy donors. plenty first responders LE. long?  mrna  people die test them? makes sense. people dying something (like Covid, example) , can't hide that.  little excess death Japan.

The US 300K excess deaths due Covid. According died tested? Oh yeah. Easy! easy! Ahahahaha. high hopium! End summer MAYBE D614G ""Italian variant"" spread world. So, patient gravely ill, struggling breathe even oxygen, Hero thought good idea pull person hospital? 


Okay. Yep. Sounds like sane, logical person ~~who totally want sweet sweet life insurance money~~. We’ll never get one anyway, we’ll probably get chinese russian vaccine. course, there’s money made... someone take advantage situation. US, dose distribution administration bottleneck that's causing injections severely lag behind available supply. CDC allocated 64M vaccine doses distribution, reports around 47M doses successfully delivered, yet US administered 25M doses total.

Put another way, US would likely 3rd place instead 5th place good job putting available shots arms procuring doses.  virus, pandemic. Obviously 101.  Lol. UK US EXACTLY this. Vaccine produced UK US needs go citizens first. finally got sober, felt ten years older, fuck something do. careful what? Two weeks vaccine careful? Depends variant. Strange. thought sorted “new”.  missed /s Well Avicii cold. Don’t know you’re downvoted. You’re right. one wants uncomfortable. one wants right thing anymore. wish stupid country would pay people stay home two months try bring numbers back down. don’t think that’s going happen, wish would. truly essential workers would working. I’m hoping keep getting vaccines arms eventually poor kids get one too. Incredibly, incredibly jealous. But..... failing everything. It’s disgrace, demand leaders. 5-10 warmish winter many parts Britain, although completely question (and becoming common, obvious reasons).

That said, huge swathes Western Europe winters kinds temps. I'm gonna go stupidity... second dose definitely hits harder some

Source: Got second dose 18 hours ago. Feels like one 24/48-hour flus tbh, sucks, nothing soldier felt like _not_ pandemic... First dose fine, arm sore couple days would say spirit brexit exports imports vaccines stopped immediately. What's produced UK stays goes Europe. agree schools far essential large venues reopened. It’s ludicrous things like casinos, arcades, amusement parks open time it’s even safe enough normal school. Oh no, like something, let's something reckless endangering hundreds lives. Well, considering one city vs profession, nationwide I'd imagine would way easier that. Shit smells like food food smells like shit? Horrifying.  Yea like seasons. It’s raging four seasons. depends company. crap, lot right thing. don’t know school districts right thing though. add insult injury, teachers aren’t even considered priority group vaccine. person schooling occur pandemic Full Stop. actual evidence caused vaccine? 

I mean we’re vaccinating millions people every day, mostly people 65+ (I know 60 year old) it’s surprising someone die within group. took pill Ibiza show Avicii cool... Daycares limit numbers smaller rooms needed. Public schools turn kid away. inherently risk nearly 30 child sized classroom 8 child sized daycare room. Private businesses leeway manage numbers. understand feel daycare workers employers making daycare environment safe absolutely possible. people across country, gathered general vicinity. maskless

Thanks captain obvious. don’t sound like condescending twat all.  really possible make direct comparison. obvious vaccine actually working well massive difference scale, getting 95% effectiveness impossible nothing controlled for.

For example, possible went vaccine earliest also taking seriously thus take significant precautions anyway.

Or many care facilities still restrictions visitors surrounded vaccinated staff.

Or since population first vaccinated elderly, possible less social interactions younger people closer Israeli median population.

otoh possible since 2cond dose people seized opportunity went partying meeting large extended family friends.

No, what, know me. appreciate attempt make sense. 10M doses shipped week. arrive number without counting 2nd doses? shipping everything make every week. happens concerns...

They get MASSIVE attention quietly find weeks later wasn’t told “may” kind goes wayside next incident occurs.

See D614G, twindemic, Denmark Mink situation, murder hornets, “rapidly waning antibodies,” etc. etc. etc. 

This keep happening. Everyone try panic every single fucking time try freak everyone fuck out.

In honesty, protein mutations shit need left scientists working vaccines people actually studying stuff big news... isn’t virus ever. Public well-versed enough really able milk stuff relevant actual day day situation.

Been told multiple people matter factly “tHe VaCCinEs WOn’T WorK New STraiNS.” 

They aren’t dumb, don’t time actually look real info. It’s fucking inappropriate false readings complex matters becomes common knowledge.

What load shit. Seeing many absolutely refuse wear mask spent summer war criming citizens allowing prisoners masked separated sick inmates, think LE probably even get guys stop acting like children start expelling white supremacist ranks. 

But I'm nobody. I’m ok permanent masking public made 18 hours ago(Sputnik v, first shot). Feel fine. small chills. couple 80+ old guy one lung ahead me. worries 2021.  nothing. SA variant caused Moderna vaccine 5-6x less effective. useless. variant cause little problem Moderna. said themselves. decided make _third_ booster shot SA variant. 

That’s nothing. many things popped up, maybe another one causes issues. 

Scientists already starting see data UK variant higher death rate. That’s nothing. 

The Pfizer variant pretty much fine SA variant. Great know. again, also know vaccines game cat mouse hands. Next one line essential workers, don’t wait longer. may survived, really living? alternatives kids left behind -- summer vacation shortened kids need caught so.

My six year old alright distance learning, husband try fill blanks can. I'm keeping virtual school long necessary. mot surprising almost there's one factor play wrong reassess sources. Think it, N95's anywhere near worthless would medical community horded months denied necessity gullible public Covid spread? Would single uninfected medical person works infectious patients?

The answer no. Masks, N95's others, valuable tools work you. still wear form seal whenever potentially virus laden air. still protect eyes, especially unmasked person speaking air current hitting face.

If convinced read scroll "" **Direct Epidemiological Evidence.** "" read study showing masks (generally) 79% effective reducing within household infections residents. stupid believe Nope allowed call 6 till recently, apply retroactively. today change anyways. shipments come special syringe able counted 6 got second dose Moderna last Friday. night Saturday absolute hell me. Fever, chills, headaches worst body aches. Everything cartilage ear toes hurt. felt like bag hot garbage hit truck expressway. really feel like flu. Monday, feeling like superwoman. regrets. Well, reason doesn’t want clear many seniors dying teachers getting vaccinated. It’s justifiable I’m sure...gotta love politics. Look like this:

If 50 antibodies (just made number), you’re 95% covered-about covered one be.

Originally Moderna’s vaccine generated 600 antibodies (made up), generate 100 (made up).

You’re still fully covered. super tired two days. downvoted legitimate thought. Sad.

Kids go school, spread cooties, come home, spread classmates cooties home.

Just bad decisions cloaked idea vaccines way. excess death numbers looking?   Fauci: Massachusetts ‘really good job’ coronavirus vaccine rollout It’s weird seeing much tone shifted sub recently. People finally waking using common sense.   vaccinate first people highest risk death needing hospital treatment covid19. hospitals stop overcrowded get back treating patients. still care, way want. caring would actually improvement position. country (Brazil) difficulties importing vaccines factories starting work. developed countries emptied shelfs top-notch vaccines.

Nothing Bolsonaro absolute bellend covid? fan fauci. think he's man pushes agenda states science..

That said, I'm really hoping news article twisted words.

Like could supporting marketing vaccine amongst minorities thry opposed vaccine.

Not give vacinnes first ahead elderly anything. feel sorry you, knocking slightly positive sub one lol. fucking shithead, maybe get context situation.  Link? boosted higher. evidence. researched shit it. Everything investigation. guessing could related autoimmune reaction preservatives stabilizers. knows... BCG vaccines interesting though. want read studies them. Hi Thanks. update, tested negative tenants here. per local health worker's protocol, still isolate 14days, meaning go Feb 3, even symptoms. certificate released that. EU: Give us now! Envious. jealous .....and plenty studies shown people color, especially Black people, medically risk. like studies shown men risk women. There's absolutely reason science ignored offends some. 

But PoC, many reasons make vulnerable covid also make less able access vaccine - economic reasons, communities fewer pharmacies per capita, lower trust medical community (which, let abundantly clear, fault _the medical community_), language barriers, etc. makes _even more_ important put extra effort giving vaccine.

But truly believe this, I'm sure agree status quo US extremely racist, 16 states released vaccination data race, white residents vaccinated rates often two three times higher Black residents, known risk, partly vitamin-D deficiency. Perhaps Fauci recommend vitamin-D supplements them. think blood clots. high blood pressure meds it. link. Article states 130 deaths potentially caused adverse vaccine reaction 23MM administered doses (in US) Thought might like look figures rescind statement: Roman Empire sinking faster time.... that's awesome!  India could still use wanted. population small. fuck lol. get reason thought I'm UK excluded reaction flu jab. looked guidance US appears there. calculations many anaphylactic reactions end day, could one, can't be. true measure far see Nice, restrictions work. aren’t. One side blame one. honestly makes sense blame anyone Trump this, odd you’re trying hard considering you’re defending Trump.  fuck? info manages contagious? getting masks effectively? bind cells effectively? What's scoop here? Compared cost covid19 lockdowns, $1-billion even pocket change. “Hey, things improving” doesn’t get clicks like “death destruction: friends die go outside” does. UK daily infection rates 60k 20k 3-4 weeks lockdown.

 (On hand, would've expected lockdown even bigger effect.) make 20 official government figures: long people contagious first symptoms? see lot people saying hell point taking vaccine can’t return normal life. Like that’s think reading backfire. heck told 20 minutes?

They said would year half create vaccine would distribute that's lucky. 

The 1918 pandemic took three years reach herd immunity. 

Even Summer ahead schedule. that's **absolutely freaking amazing**!!! Considering half public refused follow scientific guidelines work scientists medical professionals bringing us solution. 

Who heck promised would normal that?

And say going happen? Well sputnik 3rd phase trials india... safe get approval... Redditors say whatever want... pandemic political circus thought read source saying 11 per million anaphylactic reaction vaccine mid December, new news release CDC saying 2 million. That's gave pause, neither number high significantly different other.

I wondering may misread article, though?

Edit: also super appreciate replied know suddenly news UK today. known months we've ordered hundreds millions doses seven million vaccines. Since many proven successful, course we're going end surplus. that's great news struggling countries they'll almost certainly donated. shortage ventilators needed whatever could get. guys really want expect times like those? would surprised. 

There's already words Thailand allowing vaccinated tourists without quarantine. Source: promise soon countries start ball rolling, others follow suit without question.

If think Vietnam sit tight borders closed Thailand welcomes back international tourism... There's way. Stop calling Pfizer vaccine. BionTech vaccine. I'm attacking you, especially since know point, covid time really bugs many places using lieu adequate protections. bunch places hand mask two employees tell ""yes, get infected, worry, charge vacation time getting sick preventable manner."" way means virus pandemic stop. Basically like flu get shot every year maintain immunity. Right?

Masks? *Nope made China.* Fuck!

Vaccines? *Nope lol* Fuck! see comments UK subs remaining EU. hate EU seems everything look exactly like villain Brexiters portrayed as. Pfizer peer reviewed

Not saying study bad, reliable either Weird... agree. wanted ensure international companies international production networks able incentivized produce much could, end global pandemic.

For time, wave April May subsided, scientists government officials wondered whether city achieved herd immunity. scientists estimated three-fourths population infected. Many believed worst behind city.

Daily reported cases Manaus July
“Why Manaus first Brazilian city defeat Covid-19 pandemic,” wrote group researchers Federal University Amazonas.

No one saying now.

A seductive vision unravels
In late December, holidays set begin, Amazonas state Gov. Wilson Lima debated do. daily counts cases, hospitalizations deaths begun pick up. Scientists issuing increasingly urgent letters, calling officials institute immediate restrictions businesses gatherings.

“We need save lives deepen health humanitarian disaster,” epidemiologist Jesem Orellana pleaded one missive. “Lives matter!”

On Christmas Eve, Lima announced closure nonessential businesses. Protesters swept city, closing roads setting fires. Business owners lawmakers said economy couldn’t survive shutdown. third city’s workers informal — street vendors, delivery men, maids. pushed governor repeal decree. within two days, did.

Retailers restaurants brisk holiday business. Massive parties — numbering 4,000 revelers — gushed onto streets. supporters President Jair Bolsonaro, made inaction defining element pandemic presidency, rejoiced.

“All power emanates people,” tweeted Congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, president’s son.

“Regardless alarmist newscasts, Manaus seen large drop deaths since June, showing collective (or herd) immunity,” tweeted Osmar Terra, former Bolsonaro cabinet member.

But belief — seems seduced many Manaus false sense security — quickly proved fiction. Soon holidays, deaths hospitalizations exploded. hospital system buckled. number confirmed coronavirus deaths home rose total 35 May December 178 far month, according city health officials.

Daily reported cases Manaus since October
That stunned Brazilian researchers last month published paper Science proclaiming 76 percent Manaus’s population already infected virus.

“How 76 percent people infected and, time, epidemic that’s bigger first?"" asked author Ester Sabino. “This concern moment cases started rise.”

To understand happening — city wasn’t protected debilitating second wave — team started sequencing fresh samples, see changes virus could explain it.

On Jan. 10, Japan announced discovery new variant, found infected four travelers Brazil’s Amazon region. Sabino’s team published preliminary findings showing strain accounted 42 percent coronavirus cases sampled December.

As viruses course population, inevitably mutate, although genetic changes functionally insignificant. coronavirus spawned countless variants around world. P.1 — along variants found South Africa Britain — provoking particular concern.

Not spike protein mutation could lead higher infection rate, possesses what’s called “escape mutation.” Also found South Africa variant, mutation, known E484k, could help evade coronavirus antibodies.

Sylvain Aldighieri, senior official Pan American Health Organization tracking Manaus outbreak, said evidence suggest reinfections driving health crisis. “We would many reports,” said. “We use common sense point. Herd immunity Manaus achieved.”

Other scientists expressed doubt 76 percent people Manaus infected.

Doctors said haven’t seen many reinfections cautioned it’s nearly impossible know. city swept disease time shortages supplies meant could get tested. early failure seeded today’s: Without previous testing, it’s impossible confirm reinfection.

One case, however, confirmed scientists. Dozens analysis.

Mariana Leite, 31, engineer Manaus, said tested positive antibodies June felt “sense relief.” didn’t think would possible reinfected, said was. polymerase chain reaction test came back positive Jan. 8.

“It’s caused much anxiety everyone,” said. “We feel like it’s never going end.”

Meanwhile, P.1 variant appears widened reach: January, according sample 48 cases, represented 85 percent infections.

Global coronavirus cases surpassed 100 million Jan. 27 countries around world struggle new virus variants vaccine shortfalls. (Reuters)
The surge ‘like horror film’
The toll clear. mid-January, hospital system hadn’t run beds, first wave, also oxygen. Wards transformed, words one epidemiologist, “chambers asphyxiation.” Hundreds patients shipped city, side country.

The federal government warned looming disaster, according investigation requested supreme court, didn’t enough avert it.

On Jan. 3, local health officials told federal officials health system would probably fail within 10 days. company White Martins, supplies public health system Manaus oxygen, warned state federal health officials couldn’t keep demand. Jan. 14 15, dozens people suffocated death.

The Health Ministry defended response, arguing sent doctors helped city open beds patients. Federal Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello, investigation attorney general allegations inaction, stationed city indefinitely.

“We jump contaminations since beginning January, tripling number people infected,” Pazuello said Tuesday. “This completely unknown situation whole world; fast.”

Lima, state governor, closed nonessential businesses imposed curfew. warned weeks ahead could still difficult. Demand oxygen 70 percent higher February worst days month, told newspaper Globo.

It’s difficult Lucena, epidemiologist, imagine could get much worse.

“You watching deaths every day, deaths could avoided,” said. “You choose lives dies, gets oxygen doesn’t.”

“It’s like we’re horror film.”

Data cases Amazonas Health Surveillance Foundation. foundation report data Nov. 6 7, 2020. exactly possible lose years education...by losing year education?

Even assume learned *literally nothing* entire year remote, that's one (1) lost year.

Do think remote learning somehow worse nothing all? Negative amounts learning? good option, distillery would hand free one day week. NJ moved goalposts close schools. counties ""Red"" High cases covid supposed shut down. knew going happen changed it.  **During average hour participants touched face 23 times** (median, 29.0 times; LQ (lower quartile), 42.2; UQ, 108.2; range, 4- 153). average duration mouth touching 2 seconds (median, 1 second; LQ, 3.0; UQ (upper quartile), 24.0; range, 1- 12 seconds), average nose touching duration 1 second (median, &lt;1 second; LQ, 0.09; UQ, 1.2; range, 1-10 seconds), average eye touching duration 1 second (median, &lt;1 second; LQ, 3.0; UQ, 11.5; range, 1-5 seconds).

Now downvote tears. continue using EU dumpster incompetent politicians. Oh...I see parent 👆🏽 always picks child hour late!! 😂 Make sound really horrible like thousands dying. city 2 million, half size country im living goes 35 deaths month 178 month write picture ten thousand dying. development holidays happened pretty much everywhere planet. went world holidays. special panic spreading unwarranted responsible behavior. know normal deathrate city size is? 2000 people month. that's right. sound logical need mass graves sudden would notice burial sermons? definitely not. told lies? maybe perhaps mass graves along. increase deaths perhaps 8—9% actually extremely normal periods like flu season seasonal fluctuations. tiny change deathrate could logically warrant mass graves painting picture horror mind reader. journalists agenda, want spread fear facts want American readers scared stay home. might like im saying can't deny truth words since look fact check get conclusion. mass graves Germany Denmark Brazilian city would mass graves begin with... Even EU's reduced deliveries still getting doses UK, manufacturing UK enough UK scale what's going EU. chance know blood type is? blood types indeed affected Coronavirus, maybe thus much reaction? far British government seem made comment behaviour EU this. I’m sure they’re internally seething think silence spells one two things.
1. entirely confident EU chance taking vaccines meant brits know gain nothing bad mouthing eu need build good trade deal keep good relations ongoing Brexit issues. 
2. They’re worried keeping mouths shut negotiate plan contract lawyers exporters. 

I honestly think first likely. EU throw public tantrum must desperate probably know unlikely get uk jabs. India actually makes way vaccines China. may want look place restrictions introduced multiple times, somehow number cases seem magically follow restrictions. Oh wait, UK, country talking about.

I graph show downturn number cases point restrictions introduced, 3 times. would agree could coincidence happens once, even twice. triplicate. also happens mid-winter, immediately rising restrictions lifted.

This concerns community. can't compare cases prevalence different communities directly situations behaviours different different tools. UK tools South Korea, example. we're looking one community, obvious.

Unless 'virus thing' - mind play along puny human restrictions three times, even time 'seasonal' prevalence rising rapidly unstoppably. looks almost like break applied November Bit late one isn’t it?!

AstraZeneca probably zero percent effective then. None manufactured, tentative estimates obviously dependent fulfilling previous agreements. You’d think article year old now. Trump signed order US produced covid vaccines need go US first anyone exports countries.

And even contract Pfizer practically export ban. way anything gets exported countries US enough vaccines everyone.  Yeah, rounding error point. many people go work interaction strangers close. kids want school officials schools open, unable job. Would like everyone safe, sure, wrong kids schools. 90% point efficacy result half-dose subtrial, upper limit confidence interval.

The authorities concluded enough evidence show half-dose different (better), different trials treated combined, efficacy 70%.

They decide half-dose results good ignored - would insane. believed results two subtrials different, they'd approved half dosage, decided different went larger trial.

I know get idea even picking lowest number discarding data good would ""optimistic"".

That's original trials reported last year. buzz new 90% efficacy, trial/subtrial longer break two doses, seen yet, comment that. possible submitted EU would come week, again, know.  Look clinical trials run, AZ tested subjects weekly pfizer asked people self report symptoms. would figure Israel testing whole population weekly going self reports. hard say vaccine working better different methodologies trials sure showed prevent serious infection important, saving lives. almost February. EU still allowed AZ vaccines distributed used. wanted vaccines produced 2 months ago kept laying storage god knows instead going somewhere used? think 76% city caught virus October

That study sampled blood blood bank donations. time, donating blood one way get corona test. blood donations may representative random sample. Perhaps much less 76% caught virus. step right up, right back clinic many months ago, patients need see doctor. I’m neurologist, nothing treat life-threatening. people suffer measurably can’t get injections device adjustments, even can’t new tremor evaluated properly. am. Sure, simple medication changes via zoom phone. can’t realistically diagnose Parkinson’s disease via video, won’t pretend can. I’m going step classroom that’s expertise. no, don’t think it’s unreasonable ask teachers perform vital, important job. Pretending school done 100% virtually sham, data backing up. None guys counts natural immunity widespread summer anyway new mutations approaching. AZ actually providing Uk though? Don’t forget UK huge head start EU even approved vaccine. uk producing 2 million per week won’t even make dent EU order. Well hope stays guys. Cheers right. Moderna claim found vaccine 100% effective preventing severe symptoms trials. They'll suprised admited countries anymore, ever travel all. exactly Pfizer owe Canada? Lol talk sense entitlement.....

Michigan schools restaurants closed. 

Wisconsin everything open. 

Not long ago, Dakotas worst outbreak world. They’re couple hundred cases day single lockdown restriction. 

Arizona two weeks ago heading worst outbreak world. Cases rapidly declining change anything. one oldest, oldest one far 28% people 65. Italy second mere 23%... Clearly AstraZeneca fair-play providing way dose UK EU. likely they'll come deal either reduced priced vaccine, reduced priced something else. means people get vaccine time. 

I called pessimistic summer fall saying even vaccine, producing enough dose huge challenge take time. bet still we'll keep semi-lockdown March/April, spring helping we'll get slow re-opening summer restriction, keep restriction winter, point we'll vaccinated everybody risk big part general population meaning 5th lockdown, restriction lifted spring 2022 India crazy big pharmaceutical industry--shipping vaccines great couple genuine kindness relief common-sense diplomacy.  AZ agreeing publishing contract resolve conflicting statements true. Ooh why? Italy spent millions vaccine ""made italy"" still requires people get tested efficacy seems good first doses expected come September.

Seems smart decision. /s That's racist. ironic seeing comment reading multiple stories today countries approving AZ vaccine, ordering setting production facilities it.

I guess get memo lol Waste time. serve propaganda China Pfizer vaccine &amp; contracts nothing AZ stuff currently ongoing. 

If EU stipulation Pfizer x% EU factory output went EU would comparable situation, far know nothing pfizer contracts (outside US) says this, vaccines produced pfizer plant shared customers paid. *chips
FTFY  saved ass WW2 limey!

How predictable. bring 1776 well? Donald trump play book presenting logical points providing data personal experience back up. Don’t let people’s emotional retorts logical fallacies get down.  Glad you’re former teacher... find baffling personality trait relish right deaths suffering despite benefit anyone. time day usually start getting daily vaccine numbers U.S? Ah alright. true, wonder exactly means. know exporting doses EU countries, best effort? idea is. deliver 0 doses would best effort? acceptable say 60M doses missing 2 weeks delivery? seen coming? Maybe fine. really know anything guess. anyone know buy "" Ellume COVID-19 Home Test kit""? hope guys turn okay. Damn guys getting vaccineted. Thats lucky.
Well maybe next year country. people even look graphs? ""surge"", casea rising, really slowly. small change behavior could easily turn around. Maybe example removing absurd curfew pushes people together commute shopping insanely concentrated rush hour? literally real effort inore testing isolation? Nope, let's lockdown! sure half sub heavily applaud it. airlines international destinations accept PCR results issued within 72 96 hours embarkation. Instituting similar requirement domestic air travel would place massive financial burden Americans. 

While many cities *do* offer free COVID tests, turn-around times close week. private clinics offer rapid-PCR tests, rarely complimentary. I've seen labs, pharmacies, physician's offices charging close $400 same-day next-day results.  Except EU warned Pfizer inform shipping UK. doses they're getting manufactured?

Unless they're made EU affected current issues. teachers realistically teach home, really should. High school college students old enough learn virtually without much hassle. 

But younger kids simply cannot learn virtually meaningful way, need parents’ constant attention so. Parents equipped suddenly stay-at-home parents work, people simply can’t afford hire nanny send kids private schools like family year. Parents also aren’t educators; that’s part point specialization complex economy. It’s pure wishful thinking try educate 6-year-olds via laptop expect virtual school provide anywhere near benefits public schools meant provide (educational, social, financial, physical). 

I’m asking teachers something I’m myself. I’m neurologist, see patients clinic variety non-life-threatening conditions. work gone virtual, especially great patients used travel appointments need medication adjustments whatnot. things cannot done virtually. I’m still seeing lot people face-to-face, especially new patients, can’t evaluate conditions effectively via zoom. Pretending disservice profession patients. wear masks, screen people symptoms, wash hands lot. don’t stop clinics, patients need them. 

I don’t think it’s unfair ask school continue in-person younger grades. Virtual education ages charade, think we’re going seeing socioeconomic educational effects years come. Innovative companies usually global giants. That's global giants either cooperate even start ""little small companies"".

Which smart move large scale production need large scale company. think people use analogy tanker speedboat. speedboat change course quickly get new places easily. tanker change course really slowly, course, nothing carry tanker. We're prideful, Sanofi going give hand Pfizer-BioNTech 100 millions vials starting summer.

Trials errors inherent research development. Sometimes win, sometimes lose.

It's definitely great thing, UK, US Sweden, mankind AstraZeneca, Moderna Pfizer delivered efficient vaccines record time. Still plenty projects failed.

Pasteur least tried. There's shame that.  export bans US. US signed contract Pfizer saying Pfizer cannot export countries doses produced US contracted US. long deliver obligations US, free send countries want. Seems like it, doesn’t it? Yeesh. Yes, wait half long half ""white"". welding people houses... showing proof discernible benefit.

I graph show downturn number cases point restrictions introduced, 3 times. would agree could coincidence happens once, even twice. triplicate. also happens mid-winter, immediately rising restrictions lifted.

This concerns community. can't compare cases prevalence directly situations different different tools. UK tools South Korea, example.

Unless 'virus thing' - mind play along puny human restrictions three Testing free, mean results turn around quickly. 

I live United States right now, I'll go back get student-project visa April. I'm expecting it'll difficult find facility offers rapid-result PCR tests reasonable cost. I'll Arkansas, usually fly O'Hare--most facilities Chicago offer same-day next-day results charge $300 test. 

I see clinics Little Rock charge closer $100, I'm hoping still option. think so. coming interview AZ CEO. much better anniversary Auschwitz liberation. Think ad revenue. AZ agree publish contract so, would end alot media speculation want AZ produce hundreds millions vaccines may may approved? they're approved?  UK got something EU even approved use yet. amount pretty small commensurate amount demanded EU.

They getting angry novasep collaborated harder logistics chain earlier. old people, get vaccine soon possible, maybe wait anniversary Auschwitz liberation, somehow make news it. U.K. they’re vaccinating half dose, full dose. read full dose twice???

Also even 90% upper end, it’s still enough achieve herd immunity really doesn’t matter it’s 5% less Pfizer’s vaccine. 20 people without vaccine chances none would develop severe symptoms well.

The vaccine still awesome, single piece data doesn’t show that. necessarily fucking way EU could block access Pfizer Moderna. EU pulls kind stunt, supply UK US plants EU take seat. 90% upper end confidence spectrum half dose/full dose, real effectiveness much lower.

Also, vaccinating full dose/full dose, real effectiveness around 62% go AZ. Even optimistic I’m mistaken. U.K. they’re saying it’ll least 9-12 months virus mutate enough even chance escape vaccine want wrap whole vaccination drive end summer. think they’re expecting jab similar flu jab old vulnerable people need go GP get yearly top winter. use Pfizer production partner.

I stop right there: Pfizer ""used"" BioNTech, partnership. Pfizer charge clinical trials, testing, approval(s), production, dissemination. Producing working formula one thing, making sure properly trialed, tested, approved, produced disseminated something else. 

Making sound like BioNTech global giant using Pfizer cheap sweatshop here. Two conventions normally go August already cancelled year months back, met group Pakistani tourists Turkey. asked whether lockdowns Karachi Lahore, looked one another started laughing. 

Coincidentally, I'm flying Pakistan tomorrow. One acquaintances Karachi told people bother wearing masks, unless they're going shopping center office complex (wherein they're required). Nutritionists HATE her: one weird trick lose 50 pounds FAST obvious sub turn November. Unfortunate since useful place discussion that. turning point schools — posts started getting loads upvotes closing schools cruel horrible children parents. It’s there! Asolutely. That's usually production started single small batch got enough initial substance, everything gets split multiple vessels scale reduce risk everything going bad. Enables manufacturer open vessels check progress/quality production (those losses usually pre-planned already).

I understand able avoid surprises. like Pfizer Moderna companies faced producing completely new kind vaccine first time. Vector vaccines, also new kind, still produced like classic vaccines. Plus, AstraZeneca already producing large quantities vaccine idea production process. figured out, process predictable replicated easily (the scaling usually limited needing clean room facilities production equipment). Biden said, yesterday, government release report routinely. ""leaked"". 

Does anyone URL, perhaps CDC site, report may found week ? Thanks! 99.99, 92% (there another post it) It’s bonus dose population large said dose otherwise going trash keep seeing this. reading wrong, 5-6x less effective lol getting majority country vaccinated  Sundays Australian liberal. version American Republicans. thought words would encourage lift up. Household members providers viewed 1A many areas getting infected quarantines provider two weeks best, infects worst.

Household members providers also used soak extra doses expire able communicate quickly highly likely come appointments.

Wealthy donors relatives executives different matter. somebody life involves hanging Reddit work. Sequencing variants wastewater, testing covid-19? knew good sequencing individual tests. thought new sequence wastewater keep eye variants might problem whole point EUs contract upfront payment doses would produced prior approval, that's literally contract today apparently. there's good chance approve elderly due lack data (those German 8% effectiveness claims pure slander though). This. face virus one day. soon number dead elderly reduce, economies open like last summer.

Difference let infections go rampantly control. let people vent without preaching ""ackshually misery benefits us thankful"". Exactly immunity takes time build vaccinated. hopefully remain highly effective there's data. short term bad idea filling likely end eating even later night never good idea less likely burn excess calories picked nutritionally void dinner.

in long term bad idea eat things like pretzels dinner causes blood sugar spike mess insulin production lead things like diabetes hypertension. also serving pretzels probably 20 30% daily suggested intake sodium also leads heart disease one main raw ingredients vaccine exported UK reason EU peeved case believe ones suffering reduced production

Specifically, EU seems believe AZ shipped vaccines Belgium plant UK using ""production delays"" cover-up. They've [sent disagree. UK need EU tbh. fact took long negotiate exit EU bad negotiating contracts; backed happened here! SOP years already.

Just look happened WSB today. trolls basically went all-out trying shut down. 

Problem they'e becoming obvious spectacularly backfiring often not. Yep. It’s 1 week, it’s midst highest rates transmission date likely even turn that. think we're actually going eliminate next years. yeah possible scenario understand people can't understand that. simple concept. believe covid eliminated within 2-3 years. We'll see. motivation unlike anything since smallpox. Maybe EU hadn’t then, still hasn’t approved use AZ vaccine? Moderna creating booster, safe say saying one thing another. Even transfers UK happened happened numbers EU claiming, still pale comparison EU's shortfall. thank Pfizer that. Deliveries ramping next week. We’re fine. EU hasn’t even approved AZ vaccine yet. 
Talk late party. think want advertise publicly available.

Hopefully folks put good use. Tracy Latham says prime minister ‘blood hands’ allowing meet-ups partner 12 years, elderly parents uncle die disease

So thinks family bears absolutely personal responsibility? 

I live state zero restrictions, mean going crowded bar wise safe decision. Due level spread, means need take even precautions others not.

This mean Good know. Thanks! care articles say. reality people return normal vaccine. glad US hitch wagon dumpster fire AstraZeneca. Regardless EU AZ fault whole situation shit show. CDC Director doubled made statement recommend Americans wear N95 masks, reiterated wear cloth face coverings. Thoughts? matter ordered first. buy item vendor promises you, would care else ordered ? relevant thing EU AZ contract them. contract AZ anyone else. oversold production already (Like UK) keep making contracts promising deliveries fault. customer. sure make UK vs EU. AZ violating contract EU.

If order item give delivery date x. 10 days date x say ""Sorry can't deliver already sold guy day before"" fuck seller. customer.

Making additional contracts can't fulfill fault company customer. Must weird world live blame customer expecting party honors contract. matter orders first contract set amount vaccines delivered certain date. seems AstraZeneca signed 2 contracts could fulfill. Maybe tuned much news realize several countries curfew, strict, outside outright banned.

But right, parents able see first born grandkid coming weeks life oopsie, quit sulking. Thanks amazing empathy! Yeah think India pretty good case fact herd immunity work Yup, biggest concern least one consideration ability physically distance avoid getting sick.

I absolutely think 70 year old lives independently retired (so either stay home *choose* risk health) lower priority teacher (who cannot *choose* stay home frequently required around kids aren’t consistently mask wearing keeping distance, hours end).

Additionally, teachers refuse go back (in many places), Chicago. aren’t enough qualified people willing replace them. care children—and should—getting back school top priority, way achieve vaccinating teachers. argument kind falls apart realise UK plants ready time first UK doses imported EU Trump white supremacy. Wall Street feeling threatened minions applying labels can. You’ve certainly got room temperature IQ argument simply “but you’re going kill everyone’s grandma!!!” Life’s lot nuanced that. Aspirin known fuck digestive system. Might reason issue, might aggravate it.

EDIT: I've long hauler since april 2020. getting slowly surely better, hang there. Might take year more. sent unproven one?? guess better nothing Well rate going Canada that's going much issue... Eh bit different vaccines produced EU EU vaccines. case Pfizer Belgian plant supplies EU, UK, Canada, Israel probably more. EU allowed drug companies private companies, able produce vaccine EU export, EU still wants vaccines ordered. reason EU peeved case believe ones suffering reduced production (unlike Pfizer every country getting reduced vaccines due upgrading plant). nice live somewhere high vaccination rate, vast majority world barely getting started that. variants still cause huge issues. number cases, hospitalizations deaths country plateaued since early december, they've recently started going again, likely UK variant. We're probably going third national lockdown days that. Yup, teeth clattering like cartoons lol. Got tired went take hot bath hour. Shakes chills went away. need national campaign combat vitamin deficiency. Especially Black people non white Hispanics Yes, exactly suggesting comment. think people risk prioritized? USA Today headline: Brazil variant shown elicit anybody response Pfizer vaccine Thanks, there’s much seen news channels already showed us. basically raw data gets simplified dummies.

These numbers drastically changed now, don’t know would make available soon. pandemic clearly far over. Hundreds thousands Brazilians die every month covid? millions die Brazil year? Sure thing buddy can’t take night walks? guess point clearly can’t much situation, might well avoid sulking Nicely asking humanitarian reasons would put UK gov much tougher spot, that's hard thing turn trying present morally right. Well places prioritize smokers... ya go haha Even obese, relatively young, chance actually dying still quite low. chance significant complications low however. r/covidvaccinated Got 2nd Pfizer dose Monday afternoon.

Easier said done. agree states, crazies guns misplaced sense pride. Edited typo. Thanks, appreciate it. AstraZeneca months behind UK orders well. article technically say this. better source? couple good stories today waiting Osterholm saying gonna die April sure said UK's fault ? person replied said EU would share vaccines roles reversed. EU already sharing vaccines. Pfizer/Biontech vaccine produced EU exported kept europeans only.

AZ 100% blame reason british people claim fault EU ordering AZ getting ordered. sub also rule cannot edit article titles, heads up.  it’s not. Measles doesn’t need annual updates despite hundreds variants. variants investigated thus far covered vaccine 

Stop buying fearmongering unreasonable all. I'm thankful, hundreds thousands people go bankrupt, government help them, instead give money billionares Yes UK ordered approved first, leads us back EU missing early orders. UK AZ factories also export production UKs early order filled.

Valneva also UK export vaccine bulk production started on. agree measles still exists highly effective vaccine aggressive suppression makes not-so-big deal, actively trying erradicate altogether, would rule chance success that. thing polio, almost totally gone, existing rural Pakistan Afganistan. (And fail erradicate those, thank Obama undermining vaccine program using spy tool locate bin Laden). even say almost going expected... would go say 50 plus percent younger people already level immunity Even may relatively short-term... vulnerable US likely going get immunity actual virus vaccine. mostly level existing infection hoping assuming maintains long enough get vulnerables vaccinated stop thing. see way herd immunity vaccination alone US least short medium run mandated colleges, schools, etc op-ed, I'm pretty sure. ""slightly less effective"" mean Covid catching terms? finally get strongest world something rugby !! OK sorry used wrong word. I'll reupload later effectiveness instead efficacy. offense, tuning news nothing still can't night walks sit get coffee group friends see family uncertain period time. UK literally received first AZ shipment Europe plants ready. Regardless, UKs fault, seems AZ promised UK EU tonne vaccines could ever hope produce reasonable timeframe somehow managing turn trade war rather people blaming AZ really wanted vaccine asked instead threats slander. British government can’t seen respond kind thing already open helping countries.

I think wanted pass blame mishandling signed AZ. safety. thankful live place willing take kind decisive action order protect folks.  compare infection rate vaccinated similar unvaccinated population. 

If one comes contact virus can't claim vaccine 100% effective. see masks taken retail transport/travel least year. Regardless whether people believe effective kind mask use, they've become part security theater. Yeah even getting vaccine first place simple. still though. drew terse response AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said EU late strike supply contract company enough time iron production problems vaccine factory run partner Belgium.

Interesting. CEO also November (relating UK shortfall):

[AstraZeneca CEO blames trial delays, manufacturing, COVID-19 vaccine delivery hiccup caused AstraZeneca’s inability produce enough vaccines, mainly slowdown ongoing phase 3 clinical trial, Soriot said Thursday call reporters. mean values also mean commenter gets education advancement opportunities similar chain would never offer. treat employees really well fast food place.  world data worldometer imo  Yeah, saying 6% even remotely realistic, could noticeably 62/70% efficacy 65+ without steep drop. UK data stratified age? [I'm decline cases, hospitalizations, deaths US least. know body still responds vector weakening covid response That's partially true, countries planning large vaccination centers within dozen miles inhabitants anyways (in Belgium plan least). understand. 

In absence contractual term contrary, country manufacture irrelevant obligations party. AZ contractual obligation supply x UK, that's provide. contractual obligation provide x plus amount UK factories, that's provide. UK EU equal contractual rights x doses failure supplier meet contract would subject civil law.

We seen contracts certainly possible EU screwed way screwed rest procurement up. forget


DOOOOOOMMMM'DDDD!  totally right.

But right choice long western country it. still hear sub everyday ""reckless Russia political stunt vaccine"" say gather gathered. Well... want stay room okey video games. get it. cry want. stay home nonsense coming end whether kick scream not. Maybe save “great concern” public health system turned country gigantic petri dish rampant coronavirus transmission. 

Then allocate small concern people speculating crossover event. obscure unlikely ever known. Trump right /s that, easier throw shit AstraZeneca... /s There's studies looking possibility virus hanging people's brain causing relapses. They've also supposedly found higher levels virus brain known outcomes women gave birth getting vaccinated?

Has recommendations changed new strand seems harder pregnant women? It’s high quality source even people agree opinion. real scientific world, would avoid comparing vaccines. public media however.. anyway, beside point. I'm memory jogger. not? see while. 1-2 weeks post infection see symptoms, add 1-2 weeks symptoms get bad enough go hospital, add 2-3 weeks people die.

We're looking 2-4 weeks enough people gotten doses hospitalisation drop, 4-7 weeks deaths drop. fully agree you. main issue EU seems center around late notification AstraZeneca (on Friday 22 January) 60 percent reduction deliveries (originally planned start 15 February) EMA approval (slated Friday 29 January, tomorrow) Astra Zeneca applied EMA conditional market authorization Tuesday 12 January.  Thank much. Good. Right call. take vaccine. Can't back established methods grant approval. I'm confident work. That’s thing...maybe it’s I’m early 20’s I’ve seen many people side wearing masks, going small concerts, going restaurants, shit honestly shocks me. Honestly, 47 million people vaccinated 1 dose within 6 weeks distributing vaccine. 1 dose offers level protection. point, we've protected frontline healthcare workers significant portion elderly. expect us get better virus used vaccine delivery mechanism incite cells produce spike protein, causes immune system respond spike protein. live attenuated vaccine anything. feeling now? thanks Cuomo absolutely fucked up, didnt want people knowing bad actually fucked nursing homes. complete opposite health officials. Shame. Shame. Shame.

Positive reinforcement usually works much better constant doom shame.

Fuck pal, left EU obligation anymore. hate us leaving fact got shit together EU makes kind glad otherwise vaccines ordered would shared Yeah dont get that

They claiming everyone wants shot gets one mid summer

Then say start begin return normalcy end fall wtf???

When 60+ crowd vaccinated hospitilizations plummet may, whats point lockdowns anymore lol can't wait Perfect Peggy stuck complaning bad parking yells of,""PERFECT DISTANCING!!!"" Jan 21 ... one day Biden took office Dr Fauci announced US rejoining WHO, specifically mentioned led COVAX vaccination effort get vaccines distributed countries need.

So, US involved. imagine J&amp;J vaccine approved tailor-made distribution effort. I’m sure delivery completely stagnant they’ll never get ever won’t ever get back track. article:

After Colorado teachers child care workers fully vaccinated, longer quarantine exposure COVID, Gov. Jared Polis State Epidemiologist Rachel Herlihy said Tuesday.

It’s still entirely clear educators vaccinated large scale. [The Denver Post reported Colorado National Guard Brig. Gen. Scott Sherman, heading vaccine distribution, said teachers child care workers would get priority ahead essential workers next phase vaccination. Delaware, 39% vaccinated 65%.

Delaware doin new math. testing. Illinois started testing February last year, done 15m tests. 12.6ish-million Illinoisans. one test per person less year. basically invention test, everyone ability get test (yes delays) year logistical *miracle*. also probably expensive vaccination. People much influenced behavior peers like think are. Eventually daring individual social group going start inviting others eat taking kids play grandparents (who want spend last years lives never seeing grandchildren grow) next person going decide accept invitation on. media find new things cover places currently offering programing online stop limit extent order things person. Eventually, fairly minor modification (more people working home often, individuals choosing wear masks sick public transport, stuff like that), people return value doing. Moderna paper showed limited effectiveness. 6.4 fold reduction neutralization full spike protein mutation set South African variant. 6.4 fold reduction puts large set vaccine recipients levels lower lowest convalescent patient.

Yet, somehow, we're supposed take paper, used 3 mutations, even mutations RBD, assume vaccine effective? thanks. Meanwhile brits hogging giving people get benefit. Well played. felt like moderna Pfizer came good numbers, pressure AZ twist data make look good. many saw combining data bad science  need recalibrate sarcasm detector. *all year long* yeah vaccines come it’s gonna take months get lot people

*vaccines come* oh guys... it’s gonna MONTHS! MONTHS tell you! hope lost... 

Why news this? Wow, hadn’t thought that! Bigamy must tough juggle pandemic! I'd guess that's unlikely data shows strong antibody production elderly there's enough data show works real world setting. UK data become available next week interesting. isolating, died, can't caught result meeting.

We can't say one unlucky, least one must caught Covid outside bubble somehow. correct. Pfizer far produce vaccines EU. 500–600 million doses 2020. J&amp;J Curevac approved basically vaccines delivered EU Pfizer. Oh 100% agree you! given choice either continuing career essential person service bitter society treated parents like day die. worked last year gloves masks mitigating risk best could, coming home trying catch kids up. finally hit breaking point kids.

FDA guidelines demand data shows efficacy different ethnicities US approved.

The US trails also much larger sample size, avoid dosage issues, crucially, sufficient data determine efficacy over-65s. Amazing even discussing NFL politicized. ""The Wuhan Virus?"" Putting ""scientific paper"" quotes? exactly objective source. No. go work don’t, don’t get paid. three small kids home can’t afford go without pay. (I’m fellowship, final stage training, I’m making doctor usually makes. make less school teacher Seattle.) don’t know way teachers contract district different hospital employs me. 

I seen well 35 different new patients enclosed spaces, spending well 8 hours total, it’s new patients coming time. high-risk older people, often coming various assisted living facilities. can’t keep distance; examine that’s job. 

If teachers renewing contracts going leave without pay, would one thing. they’re still getting paid, taxpayer money (same me), they’re watching children suffer families crack pressure. carrying line safety, there’s ample evidence done safely. 
And profession used respect highly advocate for. It’s unbelievable. Oh goodness gracious headlines. Genuinely feel like saw cases dropping flipped spin new takes. It’s sick. It’s unethical. let good news good news. virus making new variants since March. Every pandemic ever undergone mutation or... thousands ends. Good lord need get grip. Curfew completely backwards ""solution"". forces *more* people together, less, everyone shorter time window. Whiever thought wants look like strongman, actually lower transmission. Sure, vaccinating old high-risk part that, they’re ones far likely end hospital die, that’s reason closures. that’s past, open vaccinating drive even more. contracts work sorry. logic AZ never send doses vaccine EU UK. Yet that.

By logic none Biontech/Pfizer vaccine produced inside EU shipped England. Since contracts still gotten doses order. Animal studies shown promise, indicate possibility sterilizing immunity humans. want links, probably time repost megacomment anyway. don’t powers anymore Hopefully US trial come save day. incredibly hard make body artificially mount immune response something automatically already.

Is treating things like cancer difficult? like they're trying accomplish newest treatment? mess, jesus christ. Reddit hot takes stupid sometimes.  poop... mean company also behind production schedule: worrying pandemic, still plenty worry about. plagued worry finding job, partner, etc. Worrying I'd failure college. one point told one professors thought I'd dead/homeless 10 years find job. 

Life's big deal. Enjoy can, chill everything else. soon let go expectations, everything improved vastly. 

The end pandemic like opening door, it'll slog. Enjoy though. would next list get vaccine (after medical workers, etc). age exclude them. apply online state qualify. probably take while, course, since still shortages. told could take 2 weeks response, heaven knows long appt. idea proof ask for. Maybe doctor's note script?

Anyway, eligible folks 65.

Montgomery County, PA maybe time countries count died covid died covid including people died sorts diseases even accidents. even true number 500 still newsworthy. remember I've read ten thousand people died bad air quality Northern Italy long ago.. cause panic spreading news articles? nope. people totally blow covid proportion. sure hundred dead thousand dead people sad irrational highly illogical focus much run entire world economy ground what's essential drop normal death rate. mention many dying people actually months away death anyway. 30 years people look past period one worst deliberately created crisis worst world wide manipulation human history.
for crying loud people even Europe enough eat live healthy lives think ok run economy ground, remember reading UK 8 million people means afford enough food. many months think elderlys life average extended avoiding covid infection? 1? 2? many years think life expectancy drops someone can't afford proper food? tell 7 years probably even 15 years thereabouts based research.
covid proof powerful government tyke media is.
and think im insane saying know several accredited viral experts said similar things even biggest news outlets started tell truth think going far, published real death rate known since april. 0,3% nationwide change deathrate Germany even height covid even visible graph, insignificant. Globally covid supposedly killed little 2 million people. That's LESS 2 weeks worth annual deaths. lockdown decided objective AI calculated optimal outcome society whole im terms years lifetime saved, lockdown all. Math bro. Math. opinion fact tested calculated with. believe fine, research end result. popular fact still fact. world can't hide facts forever can't keep shutting critics forever. theres reason countless medical experts criticized lockdown much fake death numbers. may fall cliff either. None data seen AZ vaccine show efficacy various age groups. like lot existing vaccines less effective older get general, could nowhere near even 70% 55-65 year olds. really see helps AZ produce vaccine. shame strived first ran clinical trials awfully. things considered fact two vaccine candidates novel virus emerged year remarkable. ? contract AZ EU surely include something like ""We deliver fulfilled delivery another customer"".

AZ simply fucked sold doses dont several customers. EU demanding get fair share. Surely whole production least share damage solely lie them.

This fault EU AZ delivering agreed contract.

And repeat potential clauses UK/AZ deal much want. contract irrelevant deal EU AZ. Ease business mean whatever fuck want without hold accountable. Depends J&amp;J vaccine goes, yet approved.

We special want won’t happen us. Actually it'll rerelease Tenet Bullshit.

EU put €300million Oxford AZ vaccine. US UK put money R&amp;D Ive wondering talk Vaccines, Ive mainly heard mRNA vaccines.  


I know types, regular non-mRNA vaccines development?  
If companies producing them? got lion's share Phizer Moderna vaccines (largely banning exports countries). That's difference. alcohol need denatured order effective sanitizer? denature it? see morning Merck, since dropped vaccines, negotiation companies start producing vaccines seem true.

At time AZ shouldnt agreed price means cant meet demand. What’s suggested 6-fold drop may even cause decrease real world efficacy levels needed protect. 

I also disagree vaccine assessment.

1/20 get it... still, even Israel done another study efficacy posted today... Nobody yet hospitalized getting shot, even among got COVID vaccination, disease remained mild!

Does give free reign break law??? Absolutly not, book.

Does give free reign stop worrying resume activities state allows resume?

In opinion, hard yes. someone Pfizer shots down, that’s personal approach well. you. totally doable wait longer get good place vaccine-wise opening again. worth rushing. want vagrant traveling Bard's, get vagrant traveling Bard's? variants spread faster typical variant US, it’ll change many people get disease die Single dose here. ""Soon"" mean anything. 

100 million doses 50 million people fully vaccinated, 100 million people partially vaccinated.

It near enough remove restrictions.

Another reason stay clean.  100M doses supplied 80M UK facilities 20M EU facilities, technically first 80M doses produced UK reserved UK, unless contract says EU shortfall made UK facilities. 

This also likely explains AstraZeneca supplied UK 4M contracted 20M EU facilities year end. it, part existing contract stipulated deadline, AstraZeneca probably expect output delays long minimally affect EU production. contract... 

AstraZeneca lot issues getting supply partners spec mass production contracted delivery schedules, they've pretty much missed every single target agreed to, look like couple months. since EU took 3 months longer sign contract UK optics look really bad EU. likely reason dead already people get vaccinated protected herd immunity. Let's see healthy feel contract polio something... luck run one day there's enough people get vaccinated like you. would say well done AZ/Oxford. screwed trial many ways. example making mistake dosing trying play positive reported results. That's highly deceptive arguably unethical. Notably even MHRC sign loonacy approve mistaken dose.

This screw ups preventable. anything that's baked situation. self inflicted wounds reflect failure execution. properties mRNA vaccines inherent platforms themselves. ability execute phase 3 trial not--that arises competency. Moderna Pfizer proved competent running clean trials result relieved pressure leaders make decisions based incomplete bad information.

There's limit much production anything sped up, suspect factories fairly close limit already. fact wrote book, fucking title, makes news galling. Preschool learning social skills making friends. kind vile person takes away child year.

How Zoom preschool even work? Well, starters, fatality rate depends - anywhere 0% Singapore almost 30% Yemen. Source: UK 2.7%, death rate overall mean deaths going spread randomly throughout infected population. many members family belong high risk groups, could fall similar reasons. noticed kind-of PTSD mind. Working therapist. make sense use Pfizer Moderna +65, Astrazeneca -65? sure. Genetics probably. head, 15 blood related familiy members got covid. None go hospital obese mom fever that's it. ambulances deal anaphylaxis ambulance buy it? What’s name product? Thanks!  MiCrOcHiP. isn’t Biden’s work. We’ll see impact Biden’s actions week now. AZ's responsibilities mostly shareholders, must furious situation. AZ deliberately try alienate 27 rich nations.

They try placate parties get it. Licence revocation, raw material bans etc would state level

That another pharmaceutical firm might future work humane reasons rather profit gone, especially EU involved. unjustifiable thanks EU mean US paid billion plus they’re demanding hijack doses made UK? 

eu exporting product uk. want UK’s vaccine plant production (which faster Uk ordered months eu) exported them. either case won’t close done. 2-dose vaccines 100M shots would 14% done. 1-dose vaccines 100M shots would 28% done. first 100 days Biden’s presidency we’ll delivered mix two, maybe we’ll 20% done.

20% vaccinated far ready open. legal battle. arguments emotional. mix things up.  J&amp;J talking \~100 million doses delivered end Summer US market starting sometimes March. (This actually pretty huge proves effective single dose vaccine)

AZ barely keep Demand UK Europe significant existing manufacturing presence North America. also weeks months away paperwork ready US approval. mean randomly happens give blood get shot.  
Sometimes hurts like bruise stings little. 

I mean getting stabbed needle expected. hopefully could know effective strains would wonderful. really think whole world hated Trump much planned fake virus several million fatalities? EU: AztraZeneca made shit vaccine doesn’t work we’re approving yet old people.

Also EU: Britain give us 75M AztraZeneca AZ fulfilling contracts, deserve legal consequences apply. view based Netflix really change anything. Even considering screw ups vaccine good mRNA ones.

U.S. counties received passengers China beginning pandemic experience higher COVID-19 infection fatality rates counties average May 2020; fact, outcomes lower.​
Counties received passengers Italy beginning pandemic experienced higher COVID-19 infection fatality rates. Specifically, additional 100 passengers Italy arriving given county fourth quarter 2019 corresponded increase case death rates 5%. normalcy begins return, prepare media go ballistic act like Covid disappeared overnight found UT/Pfizer paper encouraging because, although included 3 mutations, done using engineered SARS-CoV-2 mutants vs. VSV-based pseudovirus used Columbia study. results Columbia study showed E484K _was_ mutation causing trouble studied individually.

What think aspect studies? putting much weight behind aspect methodologies? (Sorry sounds snarky --- meant be. real sure word differently.) .. don’t get sick entirely correct, though measles one really interesting viruses immunity seemingly never wanes virus mutate much unlike viruses Influenza. absolutely right entirely possible Covid never escape immunity. think that's unlikely COVID likely animal reservoir measles (which allows spread mutate among multiple species), major mutations spike proteins also antibodies also target (at least vaccine immunity, I'm sure natural immunity). stupid, make stupid things.
And antivaxx, behave like antivaxx.
Gotcha.  True. EU delay signing AZ, much converted 'best effort' deal That's works.

They contract Oxford sell cost, can't simply start increasing prices want to. China, South Korea, Australia New Zealand , despite stringent curbs, disease can’t eradicated completely event, point isolation must end economic reasons. world must come together make sure capacity exists every continent, provision place fair equitable distribution necessary combat disease effectively. short term, must ensure fast sequencing clinical characterisation new strain; repurposing bioreactor capacity manufacture vaccine; development better rapid tests; proper coordination main credible regulatory bodies speedy clearance new drugs; overhaul clinical trial procedures; advice high-level group, including science, medicine, pharma industry, manufacturing, distribution logistics, guide governments decision making. Lol. I'm assuming /s, Poe's law all. problem getting Pfizer vaccine care homes. Many old people frail travel queue mass vaccination centers. care homes equipment needed store vials. AZ vaccine crucial age group, far simpler store administer. wish could get vaccine, even care can't use arms like last time... body seems react kinda strongly vaccines.


Immunocompromised young people prioritized all. left house since last march. I'm angry scared... feel like lucky ones ones GET vaccine. sustainably. haha sharing opinion. agree me, looking order events, something seems seriously wrong here. pharma companies screwing like that. 

Up 2 weeks ago, AZ think EU ordered late. ""ordered late"" cannot deliver last moment? agree ordering earlier better EU fault Publish! Kerala Maharashtra contributed 50% cases ruled secular parties.  Money can't buy success, increase odds. Time absolutely critical clear time given situation would much improved.

Remember AZ making cost developing boosters older population shows lower starting point neutralizing titers drop neutralization puts many titers seen lowest titer convalescent patients best situation know neutralization titers needed prevent infection. yeah less cautious trials put higher degree risk older people took part. I'm particularly surprised happened USA tbh.

I think lot risk involved testing vaccines quickly. risk needed weighed risk nothing.  People virus itself. Regardless statistics, many seem think they're high risk know one person got severe covid. read time people talking reinfection. agree. can’t even find greek yogurt without sugar majority supermarkets. went Europe first time, shocked much less crap food “bland” tasting was. reality I’ve overstimulated poor quality food years. need enact laws similar theirs.  Never, fear mongering draws people's attention keeps coming back information hope things improved.  mean kind agree point ultimately death toll country (UK btw) caused negligence part government. But, maybe things would've different beginning CCP bothered grasp severity situation facts proving virus h2h. think another clip recent BBC doc one heads getting kinda irrate china phone. seemed aware fully attempting grasp situation regards h2h transmission.   It’s coming Brazil send Brazil AZ production UK fine. months teething problems production started, fortunately UK settled deal months ahead EU commission, worked out.

The real problem EU commission spent months wrangling cutting cost significantly lower price paid UK government, signed agreement 3 months later.

Now shocked find delaying making agreement forcing AZ cut costs product already making profit has, shockingly, resulted delays, problems getting production ramped mainland EU. would thought?!

But smokescreen cover ineptitude, trying make big noise unfair. kids vaccinated birth theoretically  understand hate towards EU here. EU ordered 80 million vaccines. AZ replies able deliver 31 million vaccines, can't really offer satisfying explanation why, provide transparency regarding cause delay. EU wants answers investigating. morally repugnant here? Yes, EU fucked comes ordering vaccines timely manner, irrelevant situation hand here: AZ said would deliver 80 million vaccines, don't. civil you. Run arguments, ? comes stated legal contracts. can't ignore law like EU can't honestly blame people feeling way look numbers. Geez, that's lot. Thanks explaining.  article says vaccinated people get sick hospitalized mild symptoms. Although number sick people vaccinated group low number, cautious making generalizations based low numbers, trend looks good. Lol. got couple HUNDREDS MILLION euros produce vaccine EU. export UK. 

It’s charity get paid HUNDREDS MILLION EU. could've overpromised amount doses could deliver, everyone loves Pfizer sticking (mostly) delivery schedule think happening many vaccine skeptics even top governement levels, Israel first faster taking risk, every country seeing vaccines work, rush public pressure mass buying them... political alright I’m lowkey worried happen 10, 20, 30 years body it, also don’t know would happen get covid. risk willing take. point US (yes, Trump) much diversified UK/EU. AZ work still make major progress. Yeah highly doubt that. original lockdown rules wear face covering going tons businesses still open I’ve said before, we’ll find soon enough.

Sorry makes sad.

Fact is, I’m really seeing Avenue eliminate COVID, I’m ABSOLUTELY seeing anyone even put forth clear cut plan clear cut metrics reopening. me, always hospitalizations.

I one life live, fully vaccinated, I’m simply going indefinitely wait around things I’m literally legally entitled risk family (also fully vaccinated) like akin cold flu point.

I take every recommended precaution... nobody authority really giving acceptable timeline... well... I’m going live life fullest... 

I would 100% get behind plan legitimately says “at __% hospitalizations lift emergency order return normal.” 

That’s happening. Instead pushing herd immunity such. I’m going wait long don’t think many people either. It’s time live reality. 80% patients autoantibodies. That's concerning. hospital can't sustain operating 100% capacity indefinitely. surge plan.

It’s like people don’t realize literally started handful people single person spread 100s millions around world. 

Stopping virus simply within capabilities. Nature always wins. think we’ll hit 2M per day soon first second doses. Second doses ramping greatly soon. 

It would nice get 1.5-2M first doses every day. blocking exports. fencing “contracts” shows hypocritical everyone being. I'll make simple: hospital accept new patients ICU, 100%? Logic would say no. would also imply none things said true, including nursing shortages, monitors, etc.... average person, seeing 100% value would assume no.   almost year now, government public health officials saying need hold vaccine. moving goalposts say even enough? vaccine end this, see short everyone refusing comply restrictions. really confident so! ;-)

I personally feel like plane flight, two weeks doses one mRNA vaccines, dangerous long diligent wearing mask. Obviously, risk increases length flight increases. 

Everyone make decisions, guess. actually applaud friends taking shot! lot 20-somethings feel need get vaccinated. age bracket covid bad cold. They're way worse shape strep mono. many demo feel they've sacrificed enough want ""forced"" get vaccinated. done users r/Coronavirus

Seriously expect guys. Nice see though Telling someone who's city slammed plague 'take breath' pretty thoughtless say least. Here's they're dealing with:  article me... admitted he's basically pulling numbers butt. agree, Biden reduce role advisor get stop talking  need Americans avoid lockdowns. high risk population vaccinated/will next couple weeks. vast majority hospitalizations come people 70+. vaccinated hospitals able easily manage covid case load. Looking well AZ can't even get approved EU royally fucked clinical trials. Britain waved actually check whether worked not. purpose determining efficacy, sounds perfectly reasonable exclude asymptomatic cases. That’s vaccine for: prevent “sickness” which, definition, involves symptoms.

On hand, we’re trying evaluate potential vaccinated person transmit disease, it’d useful know percentage people exposed, never developed symptoms, incubated virus enough become detectable produce positive test result.

By way, updates whether A-symptomatic (not PRE-symptomatic) people infectious? change 150 million doses 100 days? still pretty low (and easily achievable) goal least improvement. Yes, Darwinism. We're thinning weaker microbes leaving stronger ones breed/infect, along weakening immune systems underexposure (particularly youth). macro-level, leading rare, worse illness infection [say hello, Drug-resistant Super Gonorrhea]. well, nuking necessary microbiomes water supplies grey water runoff. 

Until crisis actively trying pull back over-use sterilizers outside medical/industrial settings. even banned triclosan, common water-contaminant, consumer-level applications. That's can't find real ""Antibacterial"" soap almost anywhere. There's also many cautions ""hand sanitizer,"" rather simply using soap hands soiled. Though regular soap, record, break lipids kill/deactivate majority bacteria/viruses anyway.

Obviously, important protect viruses bacterial infection, reduce molds fungal spores local environs. tricky spot, directly related health environment (and extent, climate). push remind people immune system reason -- fact co-opted used argument anti-maskers whole separate issue. need stay safe, times, outside LITERAL PANDEMICS, less more. hope so.

They took risk knew existed - turned horribly. Cannot fault government that.   

I also visited grandmother christmas. risk acceptable bc infected 4 weeks earlier thus likely immune, positive antibody test 2 negative pcr tests week visit.    
But still risk - willingly took grandmother also knew okay with.  
If infected her, people blame would grandmother. government allowed it.

Germany curfew. vaccines. half cases compared Christmas. Also anxious see well (continues to) protect serious covid (of course) new future mutated / variants.  far good. Good thing nobody said 100% ICU beds occupied saying 100% ICU beds occupied. said \*the ICU 100% capacity\*, \*some empty beds available\*.

If there's nurses available, ICU 100% capacity not?

If vitals monitors taken, there's 5% beds available, ICU 100% capacity?

If ICU cannot take care new patients, there's empty beds, ICU 100% capacity?

I can't decide reading comprehension logical reasoning problem. Good luck.

And THIS:

"" says state's dashboard, person tests positive counted positive test once, matter many times test positive. person tests negative counted time test negative coronavirus.""

is different inconsistent methods \*between states\* mentioned CDC article linked. disagree. fear mongering. education. 

If people really knew awful need hospital care die COVID, maybe would reconsider actions. Besides leaked clips COVID wards, really like needing extreme care.

Watch you’ll one ones doesn’t mild side effects. sold cost Alexa, Israel, old Zealand, New Zealand exist? total 371 715,425 Israelis passed least week receiving two doses Pfizer coronavirus vaccine contracted virus – 0.04%, 16 sent hospital – according Health Ministry report released Thursday.
 
Immunity COVID-19 supposed kick week receiving second dose Pfizer vaccine.
 
According studies conducted Pfizer, vaccine efficacy 95%, considered high. Israeli data appear confirm inoculation’s effectiveness, showing even promising result.
 
Later day, Maccabi Healthcare Services – one country’s four health maintenance organizations – released first results vaccination campaign members, organization also comparing data control group get inoculated.
 
Some 248,000 Maccabi members already week second shot Thursday. those, 66 got infected virus, majority age 55 half preexisting conditions. infected experienced mild form disease, none hospitalized.
 
Over period time, 8,250 new cases COVID-19 emerged control group 900,000 people diverse health profile. inoculated therefore 11 times likely get disease immunized, showing 92% effectiveness.
 
“The fact seven 18 days receiving second dose vaccine shows 92% efficacy encouraging data,” according Dr. Anat Aka Zohar, head Maccabi’s Information Digital Health Division. “We continue monitor situation see number increases reaches 95% demonstrated Pfizer study.”
 
Israel established vaccination powerhouse. far, three million people received first dose Pfizer vaccine – including 82% people 60 – 1.5 million given shots.
 
Beginning Thursday, Israel started vaccinating people young 35 pace 200,000 shots per day. returning back ""normal"" ignoring safety guidelines? still lot states businesses still closed... fencing “contracts”

Damn Brits for, *checks notes*, watching quietly UK-Sweden group sets production EU UK expect use. Seriously. understand science behind (no evidence *yet* prevents infection, even though almost certainly does) - kind stuff going cause reactance. 

Get vaccine. Wait two weeks second dose. Continue wear mask. *should* advertising return normalcy unless super high risk group. statements like giving ammo ridiculous conspiratorial crowd ""this control fear"". 

There's difference adding caution versus language like this. elements, professionally panhandling could buy crack.

Thats saying all. saying focusing solely efficacy percentage misleading take account rest data. even though may prevent infection let's say 40% people, detailed data vaccinated cases show prevented severe cases 99% time (including long covid etc) wha matters UK first good, EU first bad?

No, all.

Unfortunately continental Europeans, EU 3rd wasted time faffing price not-for-profit vaccine UK-Sweden group offering. put likelihood people restricting 2 weeks second shot 0%.  point, certain dilutions take prolonged contact (Upwards minute) SARS-family viruses

One minute. said, saw data knew could dilute going wet hands minute peroxide.

Hmmm, one us actually knows long stays wet? vaccine available anyone wants (which time I'll allowed get it), suspending rights anymore. true Europe behind, main reason ""failed distribute vaccines"" rather approved later. currently around 3 weeks behind US. sure saw, NovaVax reported UK phase 3 results Covid vaccine. Efficacy follows:

Non variant - 96%

UK variant - 86%

SA variant - 49% want shots we've ordered, UK says**

How's different EU says ???? Shipments states going 8.5M 10M next week. NYTimes reported Moderna Pfizer currently producing around 12-18M doses week US, unclear got numbers from. great news, deaths eventually start fall well, concern variants mutate enough lethal avoid vaccine, far (hope continues) vaccine seems provide degree protection variants, hope continues us able get control. nice couple chunks good news Vaccination enough “crush” anything...

Oh, already ?

Good !!!

Yeah, looks like point anything possible, let's honest, money important AztraZeneca laboratories see opportunity take advantage take it. all, excellent news. Seems stupid they're punished vaccinating people, whether 'on list'. think they'd happy seniors others vaccinated all. 

And since seems lot people want schools reopen think would make extra happy teachers gotten vaccinated! Realistically, really impact AstraZenaca much? Governments might like emotions factor approving drugs. Consumers buy drugs based company name; Pharma companies actually try hide names packaging.

It's possible doctors less willing listen AZ's drugs reps, they. might get random inspections health regulators. 

But think effects pretty minimal. asshole probably reprimand health workers. thanks :) data SA unreliable moment. wide margin error enrolled 4k people SA 1 placebo group even severe case. can't base much right right think Eu need now. many EU countries run supplies need help Answers = Supplies limited world-wide it’s available yet. stinks, know, please patient. soon know I’ll let know. huge head start population immunity fucked around got 30% population infected helps  Yup. guess understand winning move would be? give factual information they're doing. say facts, *think* come true get called liars lose public trust. Although point lose public trust matter say. really feels like they're rock hard place blame sticking conclusive facts leaving that. people Whistler contracted COVID month 2020. But, know, kind calm 🙄 KC vs Tampa Bay!? Nah.

It anywhere near spike LA Laker Dodger victories. also 95% CI 19.9 – 80.1. seems quite wide it?

Seems like might enough data yet. think doses divided yet, agreement 100M EU preliminary point (I assume reserved doses final agreement confirm it), countries order finalizes. agreement allows 109M needed. wife second dose she’s okay, first dose sore arm, second dose kinda feels like shit described (fever aches, fine medicine)  come guy understand stopping transmission stops pandemic?

Fully Fund 12 Week Lockdown (AU, NZ, eradicated endemic covid). smokescreen appalling vaccine rollout need vaccinate 60-70% get good herd immunity effect. mind spread country also help achieve herd immunity, silly sounds. wonder apart sponsors athletes actually interested times Thailand relies much heavily international tourism Vietnam does, even Thailand we’ve seen kinds proposals nothing really came them. think depends fast vaccinating. longer take vaccinate everyone, bigger probability virus mutating bypass vaccine.

If look extreme scenario everybody getting vaccinated magicaly one Poof, virus able mutate anymore.

But might wrong, far expert. Wait contract leaked? 20A.EU1, mostly known Spain variant. spread Europe, due summer holidays. became major strain travel increased contagiousness. news Europe time.

Good overview significant mutations:

""How Covid-19 mutations changing pandemic - BBC Future"" remember ""panic"" new worrying mutations, they've never really spread, like Mink mutation. I've double check URL confirm really r/Coronavirus. someone skeptical far back March, still rather bitter way people like treated here. end seems reason finally starting win that's actually matters. waiting Pfizer CEO finally take I’ll know it’s safe. Interesting. U.K. longer EU, thought English would longer official language. Putin also found antique vases diving popular tourist beach. answer don't. Given quite basic background knowledge really highlight poor foundations EU's arguments are. Also pathetic outrage even understand situation.

Delays UK (actually worse remember). UK's deliveries end Q4 30million 4million delivery schedules still quarter around effort clause recent interview CEO AZ along date contracts well known publicly really hope aware this. case restaurant, probably data many people getting food poisoning compared restaurants. better data available, anecdotal one value. yes, might risk going restaurant. case vaccines, large studies placebo, absolute opposite ""my niece got vaccines nothing happened me"". thought CPS funded taxes paid parents well. realize using publicly-funded service ""free"" childcare. little bit late WHO, yeah, whatever need go home. nothing prove reason genetics. Without proof treating essential workers priority automatically increase minority priority. talking about.

Dude. still remember news 20A.EU1 mutation Europe spread Europe summer holidays contagious. spread Europe due travel. Also remember Italy variant, called D614G spring. one contagious variant mainly going around Wuhan. seems like variant also came China, instead Italy. B1.1.7 mutation mutations really first big mutations significantly increased contagiousness, possibly even higher mortality anti-body mutations, since pandemic began spring.

So no, saying complete nonsense. Thus ending pandemic summer. say negatively? current Chicago union contract, beginning teachers make base salary $56,000 year, senior teachers extra credentials make $108,242 year. 

They meet bar exceed significantly. that's base salary. worst hit many essential workers. prioritize essential workers already capture black people without artificial bias.

A stupid committee state recommended state minorities white people preexisting conditions even. talking young healthy folks put ahead sick folks cause co,or skin. right. really hope thats fauci ssying. Fear mongering much? course wont. infectious disease humanity managed 100% exterminate Smallpox Polio strains. also cases Bubonic Plague reported every year US. Well, least think we’re better Netherlands, no? wish could upvote once. AZ half Swedish paper. HQ London, company listed London even that’s beside point vaccine developed Oxford University (AZ responsible fir logistical side, science). Also majority funds gone developing Oxford AZ vaccine come U.K. government. EU barely contributed money development. 

Yeah producing how’s going? French vaccines canceled/pushed back end year. Honestly surprised, France dysfunctional place.  Germany. It’s maddening Captain obvious enters discussion. 🙄 Interesting! fave brand pure Lanolin? Back 70+ extremely rare, COVID back problematic. Many people fall temporary sickness, path herd immunity would happen quickly. work home I’ve two rounds also. 
My wife teacher. new great, top. manage vaccinate oldest (or weakest) 10% population, corona death rates going drop. think momentum Pfizer Moderna have, end Q1 going see whole new world. stop discussing AZ drama, focus Pfizer ramping production Begium. long vaccine still works, problem developed countries. time variant gets established here, we'll enough people vaccinated become widespread. read post replying to? actual location factories little issue. issue UK ordered vaccines months EU, AZ began setting UK's supply chains months EU's. actual factories located matter, supply chains set UK investment supply UK. would happened reverse EU willing invest AZ stage UK did. revolutionary mRNA probably even need rely Covid much longer. many potential uses pandemic may kickstarted. Exactly. UK longer ECJ oversight... Damn waste! friends family rich donors really could paid those. reference Bill O'Reily's comment tides... People seem forget population Africa 1.2 billion yet entire continent collection individual countries definitely getting shafted vaccines. haven’t even started vaccinating frontline health workers. value life equal everywhere distribution equal, bound money certain times give payments early irony EU going able get appreciable number vaccine doses UK essentially any... yet. UK production currently straining reach 2M week, time UK AZ production ramps could start 'donating' EU issues EU production also getting resolved needed. expanded Pfizer production taking too. 

It sharing, taking delivery order UK ordered earlier approved earlier. point UK took delivery EU approved Pfizer. EU placed orders Pfizer time UK approved time Pfizers reduced output would distributed proportionally us would sharing. 

How think world react EU start seizing goods companies within borders already paid countries? 

And UK agreed AZ USA agreed Pfizer, EU going too? 

And think Astrazeneca's EU facilities do, blindly accept can't export contractually sold goods might well sell union holding hostage. might decide sell anyone sue EU courts. like EU install workers churn vaccine, there's skill set industrial secrets play here. There's extremely high probability attempt seize vaccines result reduced overall supply later on. 

The thing ridiculous showboating EU leaders try cover fact badly dropped ball delaying vaccine procurement months IVA handed agreement ready rubber stamped. IMO worry UE. Here, Spain, feeling page UE, measure discriminate you. Also, AFAIK, UE going monitor AZ.. “7 year olds can’t learn home...”

Um, yes, certainly can?! 7 yr old getting perfectly fine 1st grade education. dedicated iPad &amp; adequate internet access, kids don’t 2 things + really talented &amp; committed teacher side screen may outcome.

My daughter’s teacher online ~3-4 hours day. completely manages class screen, he’s incredible. kids take pictures &amp; upload work, story &amp; snack time, sharing, small group discussions. 1st grade education 100% fine IMO. reading far grade level &amp; math probably grade level.

it’s FUN school way. can’t wait next school year, teacher safe &amp; we’re safe. middle &amp; high schooler too, taking advanced classes &amp; outstanding academically, adequate socially/emotionally. 

It’s HARD sad days, we’re getting &amp; know made sacrifices year health safety community &amp; think that’s something always time. upset minor inconvenience keeps people safe? worse forced wear shirt. USA: Friendship ended Mudasir. India new Best Friend. never tested enough, never shut borders, never enacted proper lockdown. 

Their constitution allow lockdown. taken measures though. China giving away huge number vaccines too, actually. prioritize poorer neighborhoods hit statistically hardest. need bring race this. Plus black neighborhoods completely black white people neighborhoods supposed wait? unlike usa uk, eu selfishly blocked exportation vaccines feel first post kind attitude upvoted. applaud it. won’t going crazy wife vaccinated also, soon fuck shit. It’s over. That's Civic Duty is. Meanwhile US complete export ban.

""How nice despite poorer country. though."" matter time also find states. Thank sacrifices past year. need perfect, even need done willingly, suffered given something past year pandemic associated restrictions done countrymen women service, I'd say acted quite honorably. I've reading lot people saying there's reward thank this, that's true. least internet stranger, family avoided pandemic starting get vaccinated. could one sacrifices helped contribute avoidance, gratitude. Let's get this, back normal away pain. yes, sure. Let's ignore fact pfizer-biontech astrazeneca product european collaboration. (biontech german astrazeneca british-swedish)
They available soon thanks EU billions paid developement production.
Indeed producing (Sanofi Reithera) It’s “bonus” dose ends invoice counted order total. keep turning nothing.

Yup clue. B1.1.7 considerably contagious (~30-50%). Also evidence mortality pointing wrong direction (higher mortality). turns extremely bad mutation. happy vaccines work it. except that, new variant bad news. already riots country (the Netherlands) week, going get worse vaccinate quickly enough.  Well, said Germany, Netherlands, France Italy tried negotiate deal AZ EU barged room telling cancel negotiate better deal three fucking months later.

And, aside three months delay, deal even better, ""best effort"" kind deal... mean, seriously? Take away shady place flavour happily immunity barr mutation process CEO pharmaceutical, certainly hopes case. Mate restaurant could best ever cleanest ever, chance close friend relative food poisoning going restaurant fence next time thought going place?

Not best analogy came mind, person person opinions really important reason one best ways marketing (make good product people talk other) comment childish saying, ""people want open care deaths.""

Just people different priorities automatically mean care. Businesses shutting hurts economic power, best interest open wave infections ends. 118 deaths, 7-day average peak. dropping. Fewer 7,000 cases peak, two weeks ago. one oldest populations world.

That sounds pretty damn good me, I'll trade numbers. matter didn't, numbers really point doing. Everyone's favorite bigot chicken gets pass sandwiches supposedly delicious. over/under 20k deaths state 3 months?  live super locked city things morning. google it. pay they're staying long. Yes, agreed. China makes virus makes people sick world wide, India makes vaccine keep world healthy. Well done India! Thank much! Would appreciate link, anyone find. Someone contracts Plague every again, NY done better states comes vaccination. actually recurring rumor cameo. concerned looking good considering real consequences. death toll Covid *despite* progress, large part *because* progress. means transportation immensely helped spread disease, also top-heaviness age pyramid. Covid-like disease happening 20th century would likely gone completely undetected (killing mostly old people, bad cholera, plague, smallpox, syphilis, you-name-it...). Source? That's like saying someone thinks investing good, logic, put everything penny stocks. exaggerating position. Things quiet summer, thought consequence spring lockdown. case started rise slowly September kids back school sounded like manageable. October came suddenly cases rise faster Elon Musk's rockets. 

So difference summer bad manageable mask measure winter even masks got crazy realize us Americans got saved German scientist created base COVID vaccine? Also AstraZeneca shown 95% efficiency Pfizer Moderna wrong. don’t want lawsuits. want employer protect us family unborn baby safe. compromising basic rights safety. Repost: probably vaccinating enough people matter much. easier say sorry ask permission According studies (sorry can't link , I'm cel) peak day 5 start decline day 9 nl longer contagious. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Better today, better year ago?  Thats nice. Pfizer nothing Oxford/AZ vaccine though. exactly experience. Got (max) 102F fever day second Pfizer dose well. day felt great like nothing happened. think several reasons, Japanese population Japanese government:

Japanese etiquette dictates way less physical contact people. 

Japan collectivist society, opposed individualist societies west. suspect means Japanese people likely adhere comply covid restrictions.

And lastly, Japan already history frequent use face masks. California they've done better job controlling virus. EU wants know location realise AZ also failed meet schedule UK well right? Apart UK got 20% expected delivered end quarter. EU I’d getting closer 40% deliveries starting first half quarter.

The difference UK supply chain issues dealt AZ extra 3 months sort out, whereas EUs still facing problems.

Also according CEO contract fixed delivery schedules best effort clauses. best effort include breaking contracts (by sending vaccines Uk). Never mind simple fact issue entirely due EUs delay would morally wrong Uk punished that. Sounds like could suffocate wearer, good idea imo. It’s kids I’m worried about, little monsters survive anything, it’s grandparents living house I’m worried about.. aren’t quite resilient kids myself. think comes disease breathe ventilation ducts, could permanent. whole life, one universal human comforts turned painful ordeal. study essentially “we shall see!” 

Case closed, works me! Lol. would stop going place made clients wear two masks. It’s seriously like onion article coming life. anybody take stuff serious? considered good pandemic response 2017/2019 something can't even discuss without called ""Anti-Science"" various people frankly probably even know documents exist.

That's really thing, it?

When talk people lockdowns bad, I'm sure masks magical solution they're made be, everyone anticipates they're fighting strawman instead someone might looked little closer situation using facile, bumper-sticker type argument.

Frankly, quite patronizing make assumptions, need fall narrow spectrum ""you must believe anti-science"", despite fact science operates way demands blindly believe everything hear, matter tells you. 

I've watching general area since last March, say, general feeling I'm (a bustling suburb) people piling streets, maybe people turn news little while, might stroke stress. 

There certainly much change behavior since mask mandates put effect, many people observing reason they're wearing want psycho going crazy don't. 

And I'd say idea anyone around might fundamentalist psycho versus someone getting sick, that's far worse society COVID doing. Getting ready workforce LOL   DailyMail like Fox TV dumb racist Brits That's I've thinking well. hoopla rapid testing whatever really waste. going needed. really rapid transition slowly opening full normal. People talking like going 6 9 months lol try 1 3. explain low number deaths then? tourist? don’t see Vietnam opening time year. really aren’t going take chances stuff. Around 50% 1 dose. Sounds right, half believe hoax conspiracy tool used government order suppress peoples rights.  think every state shortages. 6% populations received one dose Opening Star Break really solid possibility. Technically yes, practice no.  Yep, recall that. good news. U.K. doing? Giving lower dose noted trial? Hear out: quadruple masking  China US larger EU now. state? haven’t watched governor’s afternoon updates while, huge drive get public school teachers vaccinated kids return school. like said, kids? adults home? know even teachers vaccinated, better damn well still continuing online education option, don’t want kids get disease, baby, myself. even evidence could long term lung damage, I’m willing risk lives. one point pandemic, Black residents Milwaukee County six times likely die coronavirus Wisconsin's white residents, state health officials state's governor, Tony Evers, Democrat first term, issued mask order mandates protect citizens, Republican-led legislature successfully sued strike Evers fought Covid-19 restrictions, GOP resistance faced inside state Capitol. state Supreme Court issued several decisions siding Republicans limiting Evers’ power act public health “It’s pretty shameful didn’t want act didn’t seem concerned loss life toward Blacks Latinos,” Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes, Democrat, said. “It seemed like could care less. would make statement something even clicked on? research next see ton japan shills parrot ""low excess deaths"" narrative single source. stat literally ranks 147th world covid tests per capita. even testing living, well testing dead? 

yes minor comparison last pandemic wiki quote **Influenza pandemic 1918** serious lasted three years, January December people infected across 1.80 pandemic spread remote [Pacific killed 50 100 million three to five percent world's population means one deadliest [natural Stupid, stupid, stupid. swallow pride talk Israel instead getting placebo vaccine. posting denialist viewpoints past year. come say believe virus made exist. Get chest, feel better expressing yourself. Well, say teaching home same, think child different, given pandemic think option. One children done public school online since K year, 13 now. curriculum way different say nephew public school getting shuttled online, hybrid, person etc.... think end day take hard look heading. listen scientists worried new variant taking hold infectious. People refusing masks. UK reporting death toll greater great plague. could perhaps prevented would shut bit. one wants uncomfortable, hell, think another year hell lot uncomfortable 8 weeks really hard times. know people luxury own, need pressure make happen. End summer long way staring 100k dead month. I'm teacher, think insane think kids source asymptomatic spread. really agitated people brushing non issue like flu. tell EU christ sake. we're not. Angry noises Tasmania forgotten, again.

The hardest hit city cocked initial response. They've since fixed case month. don’t get this. mean isn’t significant protection 1 dose? “utilize space” need lot teachers teach smaller classes, there’s already shortage teachers definitely correlation, yes, linear function like that. cannot assume 2x less antibodies means 2x lower efficacy, immune system (unfortunately) much complex that.

Here's analogy. Let's say want go concert, tickets $5. mom gives $20. line, bully steals half money ($10). still get concert? Yes! bully steals another $10, trouble.

Antibodies kinda like money here, sense vaccine seems give way antibodies actually need order fight virus. wiggle room lose antibodies still plenty effective. put two cloth masks top! Sure, thats right now. It’s hard convince people get vaccine one day may allowed wear masks. fact, disingenuous way pandemic handled terms misleading public (“15 days slow spread”) leads people really trusting authority unfortunately. new variants less concern US elsewhere. probably elongate pandemic possible see relatively small surge April something. pretty clear trajectory towards going away mean, somewhat true. I'd rather get vaccine hospital rather grocery store local pharmacy. I’m guessing use gun-type thermometers work? Mine tells I’m 94.3 never find funny tell turn FM radio mode fine. small chance less capacity distancing sort thing foresee major issue. subtract sometime numbers fauci mentions. herd immunity likely late June early July, rapid transition normalcy masks distancing etc. published.

&amp;#x200B;

Modeling COVID-19 Inform State Local Response explains changes California vaccine distribution plan, formula tier who's talking living whole lives afraid virus? even year! live life way feel like. Used busiest air corridor world. Overlake Medical Center Bellevue, WA got busted trying thing. refunded ""invitation only"" emails webpage word got out. (the US) currently fifth world getting people vaccinated. Israel, Bahrain UAE currently leading world truly impressive job - large countries, vaccination effort world leading. 

(The UK also vaccinated slightly people US, rushing approval processes denying people second doses drive overall vaccination rate.)

America actually bad everything, contrary popular opinion! study required understand this? think check vaccination percentages countries AstraZeneca testing Sputnik V second dose Oxford vaccine? Unfortunately neither 2 grocery stores small town curbside pickup. 

I’d drive it, roads pretty bad snowstorms. 56 spent time ICU last summer, although admittedly always looked dreadful age.

However, sure fuckability leader good metric judge performance.  i'm really getting tired arguments, especially seem based willful misunderstanding virology. makes sense except researchers asked asymptomatic adults come lung check due suspicion, realized wide spread issue is. would think would immediately ask asymptomatic parents bring lids lung check, know? Supposed see rescheduled outdoor Billy Joel show September. Fingers crossed. Don’t want kid get working immune system? BS, dehumanizing description conservatives treating monolithic group.  everyone sub lives USA. look vaccinations rolling rest world. Nobody beside US Israel getting serious quantity UK stuff pretty iffy. think going happen much sooner people think actually. saying makes sense think there's going desperate need normalcy. normalcy going forced idea vaccinated. yes, them? insane Kentucky, least two cities, we’ve closed entire time. Online school win. Biden unsealed data today. OP's article week old. ever dry hands, pure lanolin best moisturizer use. misleading data they’re using evaluate decision available arriving decision using data isn’t explained explicitly. numbers flattening daily appear cusp significant decline. take page Governor Desantis hire Uber driver explain it. explained government private entities would this? Yeah I'm expecting see fully open baseball stadiums somewhere around July 4th like full capacity. could see half capacity happening soon late April  really ridiculous. way streamlined would recommendations science-based. No, fact low excess deaths full overrun hospitals means lot covid deaths. Aye, health paramount, rest family high risk too. damn shame Putin immediately politicized gate eroded trust it, could've genuinely big win Russian credibility, instantly undermined. We're already ""on way"" herd immunity. reporting that's half-assed. Europe:
Medieval Population: 61-90M (year 1100-1500)
Current Population: 741 Million

This article: Clickbait dig link, I'd love look! missed first time around. bet first foray large events come baseball: stadiums outdoors, 50% capacity widespread vaccine deployment, think attendance person could possible May June. virus similar SARS-COV-1 MERS. wrong long term data.

also, can't live life fear every possible danger. Staphylococcal pneumonia flu causes long term damage. sucks. diseases suck. cause long term problems. risk associated lots things do. goal get risk acceptable level. people afraid germs lock house never come out. considered anxiety disorder healthy behavior. behavior roughly line actual known risk link goes support position, read best efforts clause could defined as:  characteristic stipulation inserted certain international commercial contracts, debtor undertakes cares, measures, maximum diligence, view effectively realizing finality agreed upon creditor.”  as:  service certain difficulty, **where achievement result cannot guaranteed absolutely**.” best efforts clause thus fits field notions “variable endeavors imposes duty reasonably done circumstances standard reasonableness reasonable prudent board directors acting properly interests company.”

Breaching prior binding obligations reasonable.

And same. EU failed, lashing making unreasonable demands divert population populism. What? Afaik people dying now, like week, weeks months ago. I'm Pennsylvania rule. I've 2 students last week test positive - I'm told class period. Que people calling profanities parties thing. 
Just reminder people start arguing ""see gotta vote party yours"" even though corrupt. lag... jobs indirect... afford new home built ect.. buy trinkets disneyalnd..

basically feifdom catchy name.... current strategy seems trying steal UK's instead, doubt it. Attacking post-Brexit UK popular relying Russia. enough people feel way, societal effects terrible.

I give flying fck society anymore. mental health time low. start looking myself. Yes, I'm selfish. Probably similar happened hospitals. little transmission patients staff procedures followed soon break staff hits cafeteria, whip PPE share virus cups lousy coffee.   r/Flipping, r/EBay Gotta make sure old people get though ""essential"" front line workers. We're essential enough work essential enough get vaccine. propping demand... giving money made gop easier sell helping poor. least anyone vacation homes....  summing data , includes data future.  great idea post-pandemic I’m more. Put alcohol little 3oz sprayer need get train little spritz pole grab it.  try explain people: tell people fire around them, need part bucket brigade, yes?

But reports keep rolling fires bigger worse ever nothing making condition better.

Eventually, resign letting everything around burn, better trying convince need keep throwing good energy bad.

That's lot people feeling now.

And frankly, enough people feel way, societal effects terrible. lot politicians hated teachers kids..

this revenge. Way covid first baby. Wife like going insulate people awhile birth. Left hospital hungry. Went Denny's next door. Even still smoking area back . Set table car seat everyone loved him. need anywhere near much basically restrictions. husband. Hes losing mind home time. state already (one of) worst education (and pretty much everything else). parish started school year fully virtual (I proud once) took literally THREE days school board change full face face elementary hybrid upper grades due parents protesting. amount times saw “what us parents actually work?”... FIGURE SHIT KIDS! doesn’t matter it’s easy not! kept 3rd grader virtual, work full time nurse hospital dad works 14 on/14 offshore. already expose kid daily work covid patients directly, I’m going add exposure expose classmates teachers. found yesterday started switching classes last week entire 3rd grade quarantine 2 weeks. parents scramble figure they’re going kids last minute, found quarantine Sunday afternoon. moms middle school teacher another parish stomach ache every day school. guess went bit rant, ridiculous. AZ best effort clause.   literally dreams walking past doctor’s office someone saying “we need use vaccines, want one?” cloth masks get much 85%, mass produced ones use cheap material tight enough weave, less likely sealed fit. However, layering kind adds little, double masking even cheaper ones significantly raise effectiveness. 

Layered quality cloth additions proper fitting could come close n95s. fucking variable constrained supplies race bottom cheapness can't sure unless get approved n95.

Unless information way date ever evolving issue, happened changed fast. gotten handle pandemic. see getting better all. Call negative Nancy, shit started hit fan.  I'm familiar research. Lockdowns work. expect Floridian understand science though. Lemme see find crayons you. stupid? Raise taxes pay it, enough idiotic means tests increase costs leave small subset people behind.

Plus, keep calling “stimulus checks.” Perhaps stop call survival checks instead support means testing them.

It’s fucking idiotic recent grads one good year SF, lost jobs, still buried debt, they’re disqualified receiving coronavirus aid. Meanwhile every retired Boomer income paper, even $4 million, got check. punish success work, reward wealth every step way? you’re gonna means test checks, wealth instead one year income tax returns? I'd argue population density work massive tracks land zero people. country dense remove places like Alaska much mid-west. would probably telling look major metro areas, pure land-area. Yeah, took oversight trump let friends handle shit. Mostly shorter want know getting data.

Their ass. That’s total horseshit know it.

Direct quote: “Try it! Try it. lose?” doesn’t make sense. many families, person school necessity kids nowhere go nobody watch Ah. makes sense. ""ab"" throwing me. Lmao fuckin source. 

In news, oil companies say solar power bad environment.  Agreed, it’s huge concern. comes about, it’s going mess. fine. Nothing worry about. knowledge, EUA requires less rigorous trials full approval, issued extenuating circumstances benefits drug outweigh downsides particular use case. Full approval much rigorous, often taking months FDA deliberation take place, often requiring drug less risks potential downsides would gain potential EUA approval.

A better example EUA approval would led full approval later use Hydroxychloroquine treatment COVID-19. EUA issued, current data said \*potential\* benefits outweighed negative side effects. However, longer trial would proven necessarily safe use treatment, would fully approved (and later EUA revoked due similar reasons) really hope ill get vaccine then. vaccine available age range yet. Hope get trail teens done least june! Maybe acted unethically maybe early waste extra doses. Makes sense appointment no-shows would otherwise dispose dose they'd call friends family last minute.

These examples support either scenario. maybe lack *written histories* victims new world calamities vs old might bearing perceive events today? 


Stop looking issues offended try looking facts. bad OP deleted parent comment. I'm optimistic going happen, would happened already. UK variant found less country now. I'm generally optimist we'll see. Thst true. UK's contract forbids export AZ vaccine order filled.

The US nothing AZ vaccine deliveries EU. True. might possible, turn around times tests. takes 2 days get result, there's way going work someone travels much. yeah...It really seems lot people preferring wait out....which know, great. I'd fucking love one right tbh [archive link anyone trouble accessing article got first dose moderna today. took Tylenol 2 hours beforehand unrelated reasons. sitting waiting 15 minutes injection, stumbled articles saying Tylenol vaccine “blunt” it’s efficacy. mess big time? articles imply wouldn’t prevent working, I’m worried screwed best possible protection. Anyone able give insight?  Agree. can’t stand virtual teaching. actually become less worried following reason: see coming. already announcements Moderna Pfizer adjusting variants don’t see big public rejection concern showing fact. 

I think eventually see increased number reinfections specifically due variant drive home campaign getting vaccinated even previously infected. someone ""best /r/Coronavirus"" compilation over, hope comment makes um Perfect Peggy wants everyone miserable is. also demands suffering. here. I've booked trip see family midwest July I'm going I've shots then. they, member states independently went ahead procurement without red tape, without theatre EU solidarity unity would arguably much better position today. 

This fine dandy – happens countries Germany scenario?

Like, EU single bloc countries open borders, freedom movement, people working across borders on. makes solidarity way go.

You can't possibly expect countries like Greece, Slovakia Poland even dream out-competing Germany France forced compete other. Essentially, create situation one country could invoke laws, pay twice much single dose things hog entire supply, others would left without recourse, either waiting new vaccines approved chance get themselves, – new vaccines never materialise – forced wait knows when, deeper coffers political clout fully vaccinated sell some… price right. When? knows, maybe Q4 2021? Maybe Q2 2022…

As result Germany fully vaccinated neighbouring Poland stuck without access vaccine.

Then, there's issue sharp rise Euro-skepticism result letting every country negotiate deals. think Poles, Czechs Greeks would thought EU, richest powerful countries got entire vaccine supply themselves, leaving waiting? dare say would probably lead drastic drop EU approval could tank good. There's already dissent comes concept multi-speed Europe. Letting powerful countries dictate vaccines EU would this, steroids. 

Then another issue, namely countries currying political favours showing sympathies using vaccine. hard imagine ""You agree Nord Stream 2 kick fuss it, we'll give 40 million vaccine doses Q2 2021 decent price… Otherwise enjoy lockdowns get line."" goes well, Covid gone October. Neutralizing antibodies. Somebody correct means found antibodies people neutralized (stopped) virus petri dish. looks like Bloomberg stopped reporting doses ""Distributed""? wondered number came accurate was, seems like CDC still reports it.

There lot reports places failing count administered shots apparently complicated simply keeping tally. reported California record doses health care workers get vaccine forget submit online form, submitted paperwork involves filling 40 fields.

Virginia said behind reporting 90,000 doses 3 days worth.

So dunno. seem like rocket science. Well.. least somebody got vaccine NJ.. distribution % sucked. going need provide evidence one. currently 435k dead. Additionally, estimates deaths Spanish flu nearly accurate without form testing. number likely higher 600k. So, CDC website says South Carolina (my state) received around 400,000 total vaccines. DHEC website (our state’s heath division) says around 700,000. reason discrepancy? sure source believe since they’re government organizations reason believe either trying deceitful regarding amount doses state has. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Bargaining: ""It kills 1% population""

Acceptance: ""Fine give shot""

I'm hoping coming months get people Acceptance phase. Cuz looks real stupid steps then. get vaccines fast enough/reopen way quickly there's possibility new disease variants could create another peak around february/march. rollout continues planned probably see vaccination rates start push covid cases significant way around april/may. statements mutual exclusives first.

But they're still trying sell public idea vaccination failure caused everyone else them, UK, US, developers distributors subcontractors blame. Never EU.

Never mind, turns masks really work all. Unless double triple mask, wear N95!

Seems like dangerous plan we're early stages getting people vaccinated. “Hey look, right”

“HoW VINDicTiVe!!! way, regarding google document, ""% Used Distributed"" useful metric. 

For instance, compare date ranges Dec 20 - Jan 1 Jan 1 - Jan 21. first range starts us 556,208/3,682,456 ~= 15.10% ""% Used Distributed"" rate, ends 4,225,756/13,071,925 ~= 32.33% rate. second starts 4,225,756/13,071,925 ~= 32.33% ends 16,525,257/35,990,150 ~= 45.92%. 

Which period better terms speed? quick comparison - 45% vs 32% - us thinking latter. Consider though, first period entire initial stock - 3.6m distributed doses - moved end period, 12 days. Disregarding long already waiting administered period, doses averaged 6 days lead time administered. second period moved initial stock - 13m doses - 20 days, average lead time 10 days. Doses waiting longer period time administered latter period former. Administration lead time increased.

What would really useful lead time - average amount time vaccine distributed administered. apart knowing long vaccines already sitting Dec 14 Dec 20th - interpolate catch discrepancy - calculate data have. went back see what’s screenshot - static looking visualization death count. I’m sure is. odd. 

My screenshot window I’d open since earlier morning, wonder they’ve since taken down? Wait know people get vaccine won’t spread still? 5.5% effective x 2 = 11%. Covid Tracking Update: 18.5% last Tuesday, hospitalizations 12.5%, deaths 7.5%. Except countries opted AZ vaccine reasons outlined above. Personally, I'd take AZ vaccine day. EVEN 6 FEET. said move desks, teachers best make happen didn’t work went ahead fucking opened anyway. Every town hall meeting streams online, blood boils superintendent says 6ft apart understand, vaccine needs two weeks reach full potency. two weeks second shot, good still careful. majority people vaccinated cases gone dramatically, think we'll start able calm down.

But efficiency number claimed Russia, corroborated outside peer reviewed studies.

You account Russia significantly corrupt, Russia history representing success *some* products. *some* important silly assume applies Russian products.

unlike Moderna BionTech vaccines Russian vaccine mRNA. non mRNA vaccine boasting high efficiency, way rest field. 

Lastly, one leading doctors working vaccine Russians, [done hiding?

Look, I'm sure vaccine works, Russia well capable creating old tech vaccines. mistrust efficiency numbers advertised side effects. get anything else availble (including Chinese vaccines) would. Considering Chinese New Years effectively cancelled last year, cancelled year going extra punishing. Good stuff. don’t teach. I’m involved school district. naturally handful cases nothing that’s shut schools. clearer nurse works dad's nursing home got sick week getting COVID vaccine, said still better getting COVID. took week got second shot. agree, needs reason people get vaccinated, reason return normalcy. Trying keep people indefinitely masked vaccinated losing game, non-zero amount people would turn vaccine case, would taken knew could go back normal kicks them. Yeah, ever overreacted pandemic like one? 


Classical pandemic control works. time tried something different whim (mass lockdowns, continued social distancing, etc) society going marginally fucked awhile. 


When over, soon, need create kind commission study wrong (and right) make sure next pandemic poorly handled one. I've heard EU put money AZ, think 300 million preorder rather investment? know teach, we've half day hybrid four days per week, get 2-5 cases every day!! What? nonsensical comment I’ve seen while. logic pandemic inevitable? last one scale 100 years ago. Many teachers full careers since without deal pandemic. There’s reason anyone would assume would happen.  He’s wrong, I’m sure everyone arms reason. I’m waiting new category anti vaxers emerge, delay getting vaccine don’t return office.  exactly found info Powecom masks several months ago. Thank reminding link lower deaths/ hospitalizations enough people take vaccine said  That's weird.

I see map anywhere page go nytimes.com True, taking responsibility one’s finances commonplace. 

But scale easy credit rampant housing speculation makes cultural phenomenon, one person. wouldn’t even entirely blame Wall Street, though play biggest role. Somehow entire generation kept rolling dice hot streak, never thinking could lose all.  needed still need child care time like offered small companies thru FFCRA bigger scale. wife wfh wfh part time teach 1st grade daughter, take care infant daughter wake around 6 go bed 10 11 catch-up work. exhausted wife risk group we’re going take chances. able take 6weeks summer thru FFCRA (it gets rolled FMLA couldn’t take full 13 weeks), probably time last year wasn’t always exhausted. Absolutely sick tired shit clearly kidless redditors constantly shitting parents helped. makes really mad. fauci cdc pushing schools reopen. I'm sure knew risks still wanted push it. I'm CTA member, extremely coddled. see. think I'll right...  Mass. know great way keep down? count it. Eye roll... production difficulties necessarily certain. Sometimes factory able start production smoothly sometimes takes ironing out. One EU factories operating full speed instance. putting tight spot, ask anything positive say Spahn BILD, ""any day hear anything either good day""... Yea, thankfully Iranians. government statement want western vaccines rather cringey Yeah offered work countries secured own. They’re US-created vaccines. good breakthrough medical research. US bad everything such, vaccines good we’re getting first. Sorry locking extremely hard ISNT paying long run. US experienced brand heartache struggle. UK: 750 billion USD

EU: 1050 billion USD

So absolute terms, EU contributes significantly more. Per capita less, EU whole also significantly poorer per capita UK.

Now EU also exporting vaccines, ensuring enough vaccines European countries (not EU), UK, Israel (honestly find anywhere getting doses from, assumption) Canada. might others too. Also EU probably largest excess doses world year, might also donate rest world/COVAX (over billion doses probably).

What UK exporting? US exporting? They're keeping vaccines now, unlike EU. EU evil potentially considering export ban, UK US evil already one basically.

And say basically ban vaccine US rules prohibiting export Covid-19 jabs. practice, vaccine maker used powers Defense Production Act obtain supplies able export finished product, according person familiar matter. covers big coronavirus jab manufacturers. 

""Vaccine export rules: EU proposing?""  didnt want like literally first line feel like ive observed now, weirdly mom getting one knowing ton genetic makeup somehow made comfortable (I know thats weird) Good idea wear one rear - get covid farts. else would China using anal swabs detect good luck you, sounds like fixed problem own. sure wish political leadership could fixed make sacrifices. mother law works teacher lives Oklahoma commutes 2+ hours way teach north Dallas Suburbs teaching policies pay make worth drive 4 hours day.

Not sure don’t move Dallas.... Best sense? Five times price? Check. Extremely difficult store? Check. licensed producers free charge? Check.

The metric Pfizer/Moderna vaccines *might* better efficacy. know efficacy AZ vaccine yet. right regimen could 90%, case practically par others. mandates experts power give them. Otherwise they'll never give bully pulpit. maybe important question would AZ give UK priority? would wise move multinational pharmaceutical company lots business EU? 

The AZ contract UK stated return early investment output built upgraded UK supply chains UK manufacturing facilities growth bottling would initially solely go towards UK's order 100M doses. fulfilled additional production could go elsewhere. unreasonable clause. 

There restrictions output AZs EU facilities, also exist time. Contract payment pays building infrastructure. 

If AZ guilty anything underestimating many production issues would long taking fix them, look like could manage full production around end February, mere 9 months starting, impressive. I'm sure lessons learnt setting UK even though EU made contract paid 3 months later going 1 month behind UK. 

Frankly I'm little surprised rich countries went big paid 2-3 times large setups they'd get vaccines 2-3 times fast, vs cost economies extra money would percentage points. assumption they're piloting it. would expect extend goes OK Useless comment can't LA like Gibraltar? Yeah fake MSM deflated actual death toll bubonic plague. research 🧐 Guess else coming? China already using anal swabs test covid now. Guess what'll coming US? places around thirty (or less) degrees. They're even allowed go recess temp, let alone sit outside day. windows open, that's second safe way school masks distancing. Ventilation. non-EU travelers though? Seems like bullshit restriction part TBH. vaccine vaccine, US travelers still banned even vaccinated? Considering study even use SARS-CoV-2 also peer reviewed still would trust more. also testing full set mutations within two weeks. AZ confidentiality clause. shown waive CC would give stronger argument UK agreement (as already shown would).

This, like mRNA, relatively new technology vaccinations. can't really call ""traditional"". Australia also going manufacturing 50m doses AZ  really think need weigh cost vs benefits.

 Honestly, better chance ran car dying vaccine. assume never leave house? Actually, better chance dying house fire vaccine, even doesnt compute. wonder people assumed like D614G. made virus much transmissible led higher viral loads early studies. However, lead worse outcomes. takes time things clarified. point risk increased severity becoming clear. 

Anyone speculating early would worse outcomes, met skepticism, prior evidence showing wasn’t case. don’t think anyone would banned opinion. Unless course talking r/COVID19. Pretty sure everyone posted anything banned point. crystal clear main culprit European Commission delayed vaccine orders whopping three months compared UK US, Netherlands, Germany, Italy country wanted buy soon June 2020.

Which irrelevant. like wait UK doses produced get ours. matters what's written contract, AZ knew going able respect contract delivering less one third planned doses EU definitely blame. no, ""crystal clear"". Thanks! mean Reddit?

Sometimes you’d think there’s not-so-insignificant group that’s cheering pandemic. weird see competing headlines. CNN write shit like this, NYT, Atlantic talk vaccinated people ending social distancing. know separate contributors editors, really race clicks. Also, add context foreigners Brazilian usage AC: general rule Brazilian houses central HVAC system ventilation ducts vents throughout house, instead ventilation/air-exchange expected done windows doors. go-to strategy cooling install separate single-room AC units room cooled, past mostly window units (a misnomer often installed purpose built rectangular holes wall), days overwhelmingly single-room ""split"" units. relevant older window units could (optionaly?) provide ventilation room, newer split AC units provide ventilation design, cool recirculate internal air.

So, hot day (most days Manaus) people close doors windows, turn non-ventilating AC unit, spend hours sharing air occupants. UK paid first paid production facilities, well paying actual development vaccine.

Why everyone suffer proportionally mistakes EU?

You guarantee way round UK would get nothing EU. concerning whether reinfections happening.

That's issue, reinfections.

Manaus one places already reached herd immunity. Demonstrated serological studies, 70% population antibodies SARS-CoV-2.

Now spiked again, significantly, December (with individual reinfections shown hospitalised case, even broad epidemiological picture practically requiring significant reinfections, least vectors transmission). I'm going ask think second now. 

Just bc black neighborhoods hardest hit mean anything except they're hardest hit. think it. Compare households others. mask usage? social distancing? social life general?

I know vitamin deficiency thing can't say ""black people hit harder they're prone"" bc that's necessarily true.

That said, order would front line, elderly, essential workers, general population. care race want everyone get equal opportunity. communities not, yes, problem. USA. Maybe tune news(?) EU late strike supply contract company enough time iron production problems vaccine factory run partner Belgium

Hey, I've also dealing questions wait second dose. science still murking public messaging worst right now. 

Odds are, cases hospitalizations falling make clear vaccinating impressively decreases spread. Keep eye data Israel especially. lot news articles taking "" studied yet"" mean ""you still need paranoid killing grandma even fully vaccinated."" 

The truth is, even weeks first dose, relax little. know want know maximum, go 0-90% suddenly two weeks second dose. I've waking morning practicing little gratitude *thiiis* much protected. wonder new variants affect herd immunity though... cogent, logical rebuttal.

We've lockdown since early november extended march 1. can't even go 8 pm, I'm tired never said reason. simply said interesting. Maybe research done see increased cross-border foot traffic plays role (thinking US commerce mexico Canada huge amount back forth travel per day, well many countries adjacent one another europe). I'm sure EU truely grasped political impact they've done domestically UK. single-handedly argument Leave side. Remainers absolutely furious too.

They given Boris Johnson (little toad is) complete vindication Brexit almost immediately healed culture war. 

Not every multi-national corporation enters good faith agreement EU going pretty wary going lash publically like this. people pointed out, AZ joint UK-Swedish company French CEO, effectively largely internal company. Imagine AZ UK, another third country.

Also AZ even making profit this, must wondering bothered. How's everyone today? feeling? 

I keep ping ponging dooming optimism, intensely before. Brazilian variant thread yesterday fully spiralled it. pulled focused positives: vaccine roll out, numbers falling, spring approaching.

Realistically speaking, every scientist credible medical professional knows vaccinated reduce transmission rate, verified significantly.

So EU paid towards EU infastructure ramping produce doses then, AZ currently issues. might reporting delays. in.... feds mark **distributed**, need get packed, picked up, shipped, received states, allocated, possibly shipped + received again, appointments made, shots given, recorded, periodically send state, states compile numbers, periodically send updates feds, feds report shots **administered**. could take time work chain. Yea. Teachers school keep open three inches max, less, open all. kids keep stuff desks instead cubbies anyway, put easily. haven’t classroom.

Calm down, article says infected sick. vaccine protects one illness infection. mean least 2 different new variants coming Brazil already. I'm saying bullshit but... hardly notice anymore. Often enough catch wearing still to. think true people complied. That's main problem. We're pretty wealthy country run imbeciles corrupt AF. problem maladminister everything. imply paid upfront vaccines? 

Clearly, linked article says "" deal covers development, liability costs faced vaccine maker."" 

I know date information is, maybe someone another reliable source? obligations share stockpiles

It's UKs stockpile AZs given UK. think misunderstand vaccine de facto handed country. UK emergency approval. unfounded arrogance assume EMA nothing extra time took approval process, cannot help you. EMA could certainly transparent could probably urgent processes. assumption UK early adopters simply shortcut crucial steps strong indicator Dunning-Kruger effect side.

Regarding ""urgent"" part. Right now, UK vaccinated people farther vaccination plan. Presumably nursing homes vaccinated already, instance. people older 90+. Whereas countries like Portugal frail human beings still fall victim disease. yes, 90+ nursing home resident needs vaccine urgently 70-something retiree London.

Basically happen following: Next time someone needs important medical supplies, EU leave across border cannot trust partners same. long run, everyone suffers, smaller nations suffer more. February 2020 deja vu kind headline. information value lines: 1) barely adequate sequencing 26 states, 24 states effectively unsurveilled, rest undersurveilled, least six weeks behind curve; 2) ignoring problem, producing sequencing facilities, going crucial arms race vaccines variants. may make rational sense, countless studies shown people trust friends family read media. Yes, AZ promised. wrong. didn’t promise UK (actually UK worked it). 

The difference “the begging” three months later EU uk. “Sorry can’t make supply date” extremely common markets, even breaches contract. 

AZ profiting this, intend deliver vaccine globe. promised delivered vaccines aren’t aren’t there. isn’t “big Pharma vs EU”. can’t take another county it’s even like another country them. 

What actually think happen? uk give doses EU? Half doses? see AZ sued? EU block vaccine exports multiple countries? None actions make impact getting vaccines Eu citizens arms royally piss countries outside block. Oof, wealthiest counties assist others they'll dealing new variants years come.

The UK obligations share stockpiles, even one. supply contract AZ, vaccines supplied AZ nothing anymore.

If EU wants ask nicely I'm sure could consider selling some. left sell, vaccination rate plummeted due lack supply. sorry excluded employer’s outdated values. think many countries beat Viet Nam contact tracing. rely multi-prong approach (technology, good old-fashion manpower, declaration quarantined confirmed cases...).

Pfizer second dose last Friday, sore arm maybe 13 hours later, super super light joint pain.  crystal clear main culprit European Commissio

Well, outside crystal clear go bit deeper headlines. seems unfortunate situation obviously big mistakes part EC, also course AZ cannot deliver there. Still absolve AZ, especially face (relating UK shortfall CEO blames trial delays, manufacturing, COVID-19 vaccine delivery shortfall   hiccup caused AstraZeneca’s inability produce enough vaccines, mainly slowdown ongoing phase 3 clinical trial, Soriot said Thursday call U.K. they’re vaccinating half dose, full dose.

This wrong. two full doses 12 week interval. Lots misinformation thread.

There enough pain suffering go around days. try grateful health (knock wood), I’ve never felt unsafe job before, I’d lying said wasn’t taking toll mental health (and also mental health students). Honestly baffling anyone side AstraZeneca dispute.

AZ clearly overpromised underdelivered UK, bit, order magnitude. AZ fault.

Then EU months later - time must aware production issues. AZ fault.

Looks like UK deal 'supply us first' clause AZ disclosed EU. AZ fault.

Both UK EU provided advance payments AZ precisely avoid situation we're in. AZ fault.

The problems manufacturing must obvious months, yet AZ bother notify partners last Friday. AZ fault.

AZ's public relations department colossally screwed announcement, leading CEO trying firefight via news interviews. AZ fault.

Instead spreading damage equally, AZ unilaterally decided ameliorate UK problem exacerbating EU problem, without even notifying partners. AZ fault.

As became clear AZ cannot fulfill contracts, AZ pulled stockpiled EU vaccines UK, something explicitly forbidden do. AZ fault.  I’ve worn neck gaiter throughout 90% percent outside time ive never gotten corona never given anyone corona Idk you’re talking gee , wonder 🤔 Show plotted lines deliveries per month/quarter countries then.

I plotted country (in EU), conclusion enough vaccines everyone wants one May/June. Slow start mean whole process slow. EU fucked start, still half year catch up.

So country already already enough vaccines (*looking calendar, hmm 6 months*)... last month? that's case people get infected covid once? Two fold reduction antibody titer levels= “only slightly less effective”. mean legitimatly concerning California band outdoor dining outdoor transmission doesn’t really exist

It worrying state weather allows outdoor dining year round, governor decided blatantly ignore science close restaurants income. industry worker it’s scary politicians force business closure badis supply problem infrastructure issue. Smaller countries like Israel past 50% vaccination completed almost entirely mRNA vaccine.

On flip side UK deployment strategy based entirely desparation point they're recommending increasing time mRNA vaccine doses recommendations manufacturer. thank I'd happy US deal BS AZ what's going EU production. better options deployed almost 50 million shots month. would covered entirety UK already.  Ekka Zohar said encouraged light symptoms vaccinated people caught coronavirus, well low infection rates. “None hospitalized light symptoms,” stated. “We talking headache mild feeling sickness, almost completely without fever. It’s really light illness.” 

That really wanted see. heard protection hospitalization vaccine something like 99.6%. find encouraging. It’s nursing home deaths NY. US whole undercount covid deaths 30%. Ratchet hysteria. Way go. that's many people died covid-19 instead following public health guidelines... judges much fear is: General comments social media make much easier gauge public sentiment past. fear level past aren’t going enough vaccines, would work, millions going die, etc... it’s vaccine might less effective variants. That’s whole lot less fear.

Who weapon used this: Every single politician. closing borders xenophobic anti-maskers. weapon used gain political economic advantages.

The media loves division:

And you’re right can’t convince someone change giving facts know, work foundation know. (It’s part early education crucial outcomes, everyone common base knowledge set).

Johnson Johnson gets shit together provides data government something. There’s nothing J J constantly keeps backtracking releasing data jelly can't get mine yet soooo comforting knowing people getting it. protect yourself. But, vaccination proven infect others. 

Basically, argument wearing masks. Protecting others. Uuurgh yEEEEESSSS. I'm kidding I'm totally regular person. Cascades volcanic distinct forms, often classic 'mt. Fuji' type peaks arise valley floor. rockies basolithic range (I think) peaks parts chains peaks. me, extremely different. get There's chance may never reach herd immunity. that's case, what? Reading headlines actual articles new pandemic.

Fauci clearly talking ability vaccinated people infect unvaccinated people. That's problem stage we're right vaccinations still rolled out... problem much longer things ramp up, yeah. got 2nd dose 2 weeks ago want travel today, bearing mind people around vaccinated. “We won’t going back normal 2022” “you’d lucky getting vaccinated fall” starting sound like ManBearPig.

Post viral syndrome real idea we’ve seen evidence covid hurts people long term uniquely silly see lot frustration locating vaccine. also think frontline essential workers prioritized vaccinations. don’t think anyone “missing out” life don’t get vaccine right instant cities keep restrictions next weeks. think goal vaccinations open everyone mid-April ready summer. indeed gives 92% efficacy. 2.7 million number from? article says equivalent sample groups.

Yep, Brussels trying instigate war UK claim territory space add another manufacturing building. Aww, thanks much! Good news EU, right? 75% number heavily disputed, work lancet today say number hugely overblown.  vaccines different possibly important way. understanding J&amp;J vaccine codes pre-fusion spike protein that's modified stable shape. stabilization used Moderna BioNTech/Pfizer. might expect results like single dose Moderna, barring issues adenovirus platform.

**After limited delay production vaccines, Pfizer plant Belgian municipality Puurs returned normal production schedule, company said Wednesday.**

Last week beginning week, 8% fewer doses delivered compared initial schedule.

Pfizer announced 15 January would temporarily supply fewer doses coronavirus vaccine due adjustments production process Puurs plant. delay expected limited impact week 18 January (last week) beginning week 25 January (this week).

“As announced, returned production schedule,” spokesperson Marie-Lise Verschelden told Belga press agency Wednesday. “The impact minimal: delivered 8% fewer doses planned.”

On 15 January, Pfizer’s announcement made headlines would mean Belgium would get 40,000 fewer doses week planned.

A day later, number adjusted, Belgium set receive total 86,500 doses week, 7,000 fewer planned. Even look tests ran, per capita basis US fucking NINETEENTH ones say worse running 5X PER CAPITA. they've already started opening dining &amp; shit (Illinois). us vaccine yet &amp; indoor dining, winter, masks... oof. hope individual people smarter government. say okay get together inside masks mean true. problem arisen days ago Astra Zeneca announced cannot deliver agreed upon vaccines EU due shortage materials. 

That reason given. production ramp belgium setbacks, EU paid research certain amount vaccines certain date. Astra Zeneca saying deliver promised vaccins, small part lack certain ingredients. Meanwhile EU suspect lack ingrediënts Astra Zeneca sold vaccines meant EU different buyer profit.

Which absurd opinion, since AZ moved 500k doses UK december, short 40-50 million doses Q1 due EU EU quite pissed Astra Zeneca. suspicion true blockade Astra Zeneca able deliver vaccines whoever sold to, EU probably seize forcing Astra Zeneca fullfill contract EU agreed upon. 

The EU looking seize Pfizer vaccines bound export. AZ doses produced Belgium always going EU use. conspiracy theory back unfounded now. struggling justify can't prove nonsense that's grasping ""$$$ seems erase internet history."" Prove wrong fuck outta here. Hey left EU crazy, here's number, call maybe. Sorry Fauci, definitely means :) last heard production US recently increased 8.5 10 million doses per week.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* got first (100k doses? like nothing) anything last two weeks. Well, yes. majority countries respond appropriately disease travelled origin, China, everywhere else caused pandemics. deserve criticized that.

However, let's pretend Chinese Communist Party hand process. matter facts actively undermined Covid-19 response countries online Wu-mao activities otherwise. Documented hard Healthcare workers get can’t afford get infected quarantine two weeks, need hospitals. It’s necessarily due increased risk illness death. think AZ genuinely walk away deal Europe. cost benefit them. Europe acting petulantly. AZ focus partnering Asia Africa set better factories regions. EU keep Pfizer doses deal production that. lockdown number3  convincing enough people take damn vaccine point.

It *should* be, yes, people crossing arms going ""well know I'll get cancer 50 years?""

There people simply never convinced. saw another headline today said number Americans want vaccine ""immediately"" continues rise, we're least moving right direction. I'm phase 5 possibly lose work year it. better believe I'm making appointment second I'm allowed. third safety reporting system, called Vaccine Safety Datalink, looks medical records nine participating health care organizations, including data 12 million people per year. 162,000 people system received least one COVID-19 group, ""no signals January 16"" increased risk 20 common conditions, included heart attack, appendicitis, embolisms diseases caused low platelet vaccinated group, four people reported Bell's palsy, form facial paralysis seen small number people vaccine trials. unvaccinated group, 348 cases.

This interesting tidbit buried data. fear Bell's Palsy, occurring pretty much exactly expected rate. good news Europeans! Hopefully really stop exporting AstraZeneca change minds.   seems AZ sold vaccine make accidentally took payment EU October UK July(?) maybe invest plants. 

Then days ago AZ accidentally realized could fulfill contract. 
AZ supposed produce enough October enough stock fulfill obligations. 
But somehow accidentally AZ didn’t stock vaccine instead delivered vaccine customers somehow accidentally never checked could deliver doses ordered EU started vaccinating. 

There course point make stockpiling vaccines could used meantime, however, there’s something fulfilling contracts, too.

I may completely wrong, though, I’m looking forward experts analyzing contracts. say. blame parents really choice unless longer want able financially support family? Never approved original response DeSantis almost every metric, Florida (despite seeming give fucks) currently better states harsher lockdowns - including California, strictest state country. People delusional ""selling cost"" thing, please wake up, world like wild-west vaccines, I'm pretty sure AZ trying renegotiate bigger prices.

The whole ""selling cost"" Fairy Tale time vaccines really guaranteed work, people seeing do, everyone os going wild... don’t think possible. Read different article takes around 1Week produce batch additional 3Weeks quality control. afraid people going say I’m unreasonable, I’m glad agree. It’s straight happening. I’ve locked apartment almost year 100% classes remote. you’re paying I’m dressing zoom! Hell, even person class don’t really think right police sort thing. long tits vag covered shouldn’t problem. 

And pajamas sitting bed two much distraction reason, that’s fine, camera stay off. starts harassing zero problem reporting that’s ridiculous. say more? interesting south african variant found USA mean unmitigated transmission rate. effect describe could counter fully. Again? six months ago? got it, wait 20 mins ambulance standby. still plants ""wet paint walls"" produces millions vaccines shipped UK see can't give credit? They'll used end pandemic.

 
Of course riskier trials means get results quicker seems paid mRNA vaccines risks actually occurred? 


Imagine world Oxford vaccine, would stuck pandemic longer people would die. Also, mRNA vaccines unaffordable unusable due storage requirements world. 


Well done people made mRNA vaccines, well done Oxford group, probably well done J&amp;J effort likely working vaccine next months. competition, need multiple vaccines end pandemic globally asap. According company, typically takes four weeks production release controlled vaccine. 

Let's hope, speed little. Ah shit. BS coming mouth bro Polio spreads contaminated water. hard stamp without vaccination places modern sewage water treatment systems. UK using 60s weeks now. We'll soon true efficacy data. spent time took write comment instead read article commenting on, would've found this:


 ""Ekka Zohar said encouraged light symptoms vaccinated people caught coronavirus, well low infection rates. “None hospitalized light symptoms,” stated. “We talking headache mild feeling sickness, almost completely without fever. It’s really light illness.” not.

You bad, riddled...

And yes strategy historically worked US..., course others. Nationalism protectionism usually winners losers words President: ""This big fucking deal"" might still wear masks months widely available vaccination help people can't get vaccine (pregnant, certain conditions, things like that) hopefully spread basically nothing, lose masks stuff. mean symptoms transmission rate correlate?

To me, looks like another ""study"" mass testing. vaccinations result way milder illness means fewer people would report symptoms go get tested, mildly sick.  I'm going want see citation that. UK respond EU's threats, become reality, stopping export raw materials. Full-speed vaccine production, though. Actually rate decline INCREASE 1.5million+ people get shot every day, even number go coming weeks production JNJ coming online. 

Combined existing natural immunity available hosts virus rapidly shrinking. also know Moderna Pfizer protect still new variants (although don’t know much efficacy lost). haven’t got data back oxford perhaps it’s best side caution. argument protection none prevailing could lead false sense security? professor asshole ""dressing professionally"" thing alone lmfao Agreed, would everyone’s interest share produced among UK EU? Instead sending everything party party B? concession, mean. see parties coming from, it’s matter resolve situation IMO...  Ah okay makes little sense, guess that’s picked borders, wherever sunshine rainbows fairies unicorns gold feet ends snow begins grass/weed isn’t quiiite green/Potent, that’s Oregon begins idea anyone would downvote. guess that's get trying slow reddit doom train. opinion lesser infection (is meant mild) one require medical intervention...one home without risk fatal debilitating consequences (strokes, etc). 

Once require admission medical facility especially ICU infection departs Lesser degree moderate severe.

Like FLU shot, get flu shot get infected strain that's covered shot experience lesser (milder) symptoms. flu many times flu get shot flu get shot feel difference....one basically commission two weeks another 2 weeks slow recovery sick maybe week days recovery.  consider flu shot lesser version one shot. 

But always bench-press logic verbiage cows come home. Damn right. Fucking seatbelts. know isn’t necessarily representative germany whole made better public health decisions throughout pandemic uk. guess that’s government’s though rather vaccine regulatory boards. vaccine? disclose all, fuck ""confidentiality"" thousands dying daily probably expecting happen time, going confidential many people expecting... Right. Exactly. Like that.

I saw Wu-mao suggesting China censor people speak freely. Obviously farcical argument even need addressed, goal. want drag down, muddy waters, waste time, spread propaganda, test waters. constantly trying see lies people willing believe online focus propaganda them.

RIP Dr Li Wenliang. blew whistle, got censored dishonoured, died disease warned about. watch town hall, assume doom gloom? Keep mind COVID likely huge ratings boost news outlets, try milk hell still can. necessarily mean saying necessarily true.

Except really sore arm, reaction Moderna vaccine pretty mild mine Pfizer vaccine.  getting second shots late next week. coworkers received first shots vaccine hit super hard. link! check website time. PReP HIV protection basically like birth control cis woman. negative partner uses it, positive partner. it’s effective condom protecting HIV transmission. 

What you’re describing HAART. However, innovation HAART allows *unprotected* sex negative partner, without risk passing HIV on, assuming regular checkups following proper medical guidance. 

Condoms already allowed things decades ago. work great! It’s everybody sort hates would prefer use them. makes sense me. think certain vaccine used vulnerable. Well, refuse something offered. see happens ;-) Yes-I should’ve clearer. correct Exactly, zero sum game AZ.  Based lack data. know lot people uk getting angry indifference, germany right cautious here? efficacy lower older people expected Pfizer prioritised groups? Without sufficient data, don’t know. personally side Germany’s caution one. comes someone who’s great aunt (75+vulnerable) AZ jab.

We wait see EMA tomorrow. France's 6 pm 6 curfew likely effect probably allowed country ""to avoid epidemic curve seen many neighbouring countries"". But, added, effectiveness ""not enough stop spread virus"" especially circulation transmissible variants. inflating numbers measuring doses instead number people vaccinated? Especially single-dose vaccines coming soon. Last time got downvoted stopped days. That, plus fact millions 70+ year olds UK already vaccinated, we'll soon real-world statistics true efficacy AZ, outside trials. actually pretty old news, fda started warning shortly issued emergency deregulation hand sanitizers poisoned people drank it. Awesome. Brazil new US variants Ca Tx Oh. AWESOME POST.

Thank taking time that! think reason people say Fall believe schools really going get back Summer Fall nice place look normal school year.  I'm disabled living isolation lot longer most. Despite health issues, I'm able get vaccinated. Disabled people essential. 🤷‍♂️ Stop pretending care people like actively participating eugenics. direct parallel fighting climate change. Fantastic manage produce many doses. gives hope EU screwed all! UK stop vaccine production? one gets any? 75 million initial deal AZ EU, AZ said would deliver 40% that. EU asking 75million doses UK Hydrate!!  Yeah development UK left EU January would mean UK also part contribution correct?Also said vaccines first come first serve? since UK ploughed money back June(?) EU trailed behind ordering vaccines really leg stand since helped contribute (as EU members) paid upfront vaccines (for left) needs reposted every single daily discussion. Thank you.  mRNA vaccines effective, better platform boosters (AZ/Oxford unable this), easy platform addressing future mutants, already showed effective mutants. clearly superior platform.

They ran clean phase 3 trial leave unanswered questions AZ/Oxford. backdrop previously unproven platform.

And telling AZ/Oxford somehow given pass screw ups done? Even considering screw ups vaccine good mRNA ones. go again: “The scientists currently engineering virus full set mutations expect results around two weeks, according Pei-Yong Shi, author study professor UTMB.”

Round 2 guess, I'm definitely person.

I mean, good not. change fact vast majority people are.

It's like 8 feet tall act surprised rest humanity isn't. Good you, make productive ignore rest humanity. Hi, think people telling might misheard degree. caution people saying *yet* hard, definitive evidence vaccines stop transmission — true, clinical trials weren’t set study that. However, animal studies suggested lower transmissibility. Moreover, cannot think single vaccine efficacious also reduce (if outright eliminate) transmission; it’s extremely likely vaccines *will* reduce transmission, don’t perfect evidence yet.

Hope helps! read contracts? still remember Fauci got agitated following first study. even study exited kind obvious results conclusive all! Moderna delivered 30 million vaccine doses U.S. Tuesday, Bio Stocks reported Twitter. company still track roll 100 million doses March 200 million end anyone know status vaccine production? seems like given economic disaster is, everything make vaccines faster, order get shot every arm world.

At time, make sense companies involved expend capital increase production past certain point.

So question is: 

Is government saying companies, would take quadruple production? FFS, pay it.

We're already seeing lots states USA vaccine limited supply. could vaccinate faster, we're going hit limit many doses are. so, PFizer factories states could ship UK European factories ship States make blocked shortfall

The US blocked vaccine exports 😄, that's canada receiving doses Europe California huge long state. Oregon atop it, sure, it’s also underneath Washington, borders Canada. mean headline also could ""Man Dies Days Brushing Teeth"". probably factual correct, chose headline fear drives clicks. 

That's kind headline irresponsible. I'm sure UK would come better without Brexit, we'd likely mess EU. Shit! cured me??? wanted know it!  MAGUINDANAO, Philippines — 25 members police force Pagalungan town relieved placed quarantine tested positive COVID-19, health senior police officials said Thursday. time I’m vaccinated anyone wants offered it, guess doesn’t impact me. 100M doses (assuming 2 doses per person) 1/7th way full vaccination. won’t ready start opening get much further. even number efficiency. That's mistaken number 65s trials booster contingency case worse variant appears line. 

Also, Pfizer literally said vaccine slightly less effective too. I'd rather 1/.027=37.... 1-0.027 = .973 97.3 people 100 get it. get whole person need 37 times percentage, 3,700 people 2 vaccines 1 person gets Covid. aware that. Doesn’t mean follow it. I’ve safe year vaccinated I’m living life again. Misleading. say „20 instead 800”, 800 many people group would get sick vaccine.

Still awesome. limited supply. 3 weeks second dose Pfizer AZ vaccines maximum immunity, go licking doorknobs Valentine's day No, shows discernible benefit. heaviest restrictions placed happen peak right peak infections.

If places restrictions well ones high restrictions I’d say that’s interesting phenomenon. still denial. Apparently government made increase compliance lockdown justify cancelling Christmas plans 🙄 start, say. ridiculous standard healthcare settings. say contract pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates two main vaccine production factories UK classed primary manufacturing sites, production sites Belgium Netherlands secondary priorities.

AstraZeneca seems disagree. guess we'll eventually find telling UK agreement reached June, three months European one. could imagine, UK government said supply coming UK supply chain would go UK first. Basically, that’s is. **In EU agreement mentioned manufacturing sites UK option Europe, Ah yes, 6 day weeks show care! Okay, admit informed better might wrong points I'm sorry citations come across wrong way.

I changed opinion based arguing sources come conclusion topic complex initially thought.

The three months delay however give az right deliver vaccines uk first, although might happened exactly described EU.

I'm sorry comments came across hostile and/or toxic. emotional topic I'm sure understand sometimes emotions get better Lol one n95 job better even cheaper kn95 government doesn’t want say though instead double bs science lack restrictions state mean restrictions elsewhere work? Here, cases come presence restrictions. fact, happened 3 times UK without fail. virus thing, choose follow downward curve everytime restrictions introduced? Yeah sub astroturfed months now. denied variant, associated wave, it’s transmissibility etc. couldn’t anymore. Ahhhh, forgot them! Thanks. OP, I've similar number flights post-covid, travel every week install fix sortation equipment distribution centers logistics hubs across country. thought polio iradicated it’s much traditional mrna, uses adenovirus, inject dna body produces spike protein. much like mrna vaccines time, kind weird. stay forever, means we'll basically get time another. true blame completely AZ. signed contract UK saying couldn’t export doses UK orders fulfilled signed EU saying main suppliers? Surely company incompetent yeah hopped twitter saw that. also point is: UK got something produced EU production island ramped yet. EU money helped ramp up. AZ want honor EU agreement sending doses UK EU. company overcommitted, everyone suffer proportionally.

 UK reason smug here. EU made commitment good faith, AZ broke it. UK keeps what's produced soil. that's trading UK works, probably stop it. said work. Same! Vaccine production grows exponentially. 2% vaccinated first month does’t mean take 50 months get 100%.

If capacity doubles every month, 2% Jan, 4% Feb, 8% march, 16% april, 32% may 64% june, effectively ending pandemic. Publish contract see ourselves. Rember teump called Chinese vieus everyone freaked out. calling South African mutation one bats eye None phase 3 ready

And publish mid-term results sent newer results review. mention, get much information Russian vaccine scientifically Lol that's true, that's significantly less optimistic subreddit posting.

By saying sub J&amp;J shot couple days ago, believe would vaccinating large numbers vaccine 1,5 week.

The young fit almost going expected catch turn get vaccine. UK got 1-4m 75+ million shortfall. worth noting 20 million doses UK ordered 2020, got 0.5m. Everyone suffering unprecedented speed manufacturing needed. EU delayed 3+ months placing order. OK would really piss vaccines provide good protection far reason believe don't, even need new shots every year, think end 2021 certain parts life back normal countries vaccinated 50% population.

Back normal activities predict end year (probable way sooner).

Dining bars (indoor)

Travel (will need proof vaccination back normal)

Movies live shows

Tradeshows

Weddings parties

As big disaster is, human brain move quickly terrible events, obviously much physically hurt lost loved ones. 

The world spending fortune fighting global warming. However, area would invest lot money government endless ads telling people wearing mask feel onset cold etc selfish act wear simply care others. would ads rolling months non stop everywhere.

We could save lot lives year everyone wears mask feel sick. problem even now, 2 million dead, many people think masks needed paranoid people wear them. 

A disaster like least something learn improve. think vaccine innovation positive thing negative event, however, could positive things. That’s herd immunity getting work though, right?  got produced EU. saying restrictions thing bring number cases? Thing is, even EU sues AstraZeneca vaccines unless get doses reserved countries. escape would improve production output somehow possible need verify claim widely reported last week main reason current situation? claim aware situation know basic facts. Also even one links posted... try discussion good faith rather whatever BS trying.

However, here's another link without paywall(not one FT either) - UK got theirs's first placed order 3 months prior due get first deliveries 3 months earlier (Q4 2020) that. Placing order scheduling orders 3 months later (Q1 2021) can't surprised get order later. schedules met would still UK got vaccines without problems EU questioning get vaccines. AZ troubles producing vaccines, UK EU get equal amount vaccines produces UK EU deal fact AZ produce fast promised. 

&amp;#x200B;

That complete lie already admitted such. UK get vaccines without problems fact first delivery later much smaller percentage EU's first. Also no, UK factories additional 3 months increase capacity (funded UK) support EU who's factories (Novasep Belgium) still increasing capacity due 3 month delay. contract signed hugely important allowed (or didn't) AZ build supply chain. Delaying caused problems EU choose 40% statement false? AZ deliver 40% vaccines far. fail deliver 40% breach contract. 

&amp;#x200B;

No delivered yet EU approved yet. new forecast 40% Q1. really scratching around something right you. Also breach contract claim based opinion MEP claims contract hand. Strange ended previous quote part. CEO next paragraph contradicts entirely. contract public knowledge know says certain. However seems much likely based best effort rather fixed deliveries would insane make guarantees without supply chain place. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall completely unable discussion good faith. demanding sources information already know true try dismiss false. cutting quotes key bits information actually completely altering meaning weight quote. Basically pulling every scummy tactic try 'win' argument, likely aware actually good point. mental health far shitter finally getting see parents godsend. don’t even know would without partner thankfully lives me. Hang need (form small pod, see outdoors, keep sanity) still miles go. EU disappointing much, thought smarter this. plan since “two weeks flatten curve.” “Two weeks flatten curve.” “A year there’s vaccine.” “Forever cuz science.” No, thanks. Fauci sit home masks.

One could say it’s almost like haven’t watched Thick Indiana well.  Hahaha. Nice one! Yes. answered above, usage AC widespread even poor neighborhoods areas Brazil AC luxury item (even warmer, drier places).  can't life understand issue wearing masks I've studied human behavior adult life. simple thing tradeoff saving lives slowing spread turn also slowing possible mutations. possible theory I've able come large majority ppl think attractive narcissism demands looks covered mask, sounds ridiculous stage pandemic information airborn transmission can't come reasons ppl would cause fuss something simple, especially end might well sight vaccines rolling out. Great. ready time EU 'demand' get them. /S Covid still exist wont anywhere bad now. whats going israel seems like majority arent getting sick all. Thats vaccines creating immune response. Hopefully vaccines havent released yet reach 90% options. Summer mean anything cities like Manaus, almost equator line. Manaus always hot wet, wet season dry season (still wet, less wet season). think biggest COVID driver overuse closed spaces AC (most homes uses ACs, even poor neighborhoods because, believe me, really warm whole year, lived one half year) also, developed city, lot overpopulated homes neighborhoods. 

But hard figure Manaus bad lot cities Brazil problems (poverty, poor health system, etc) Manaus. think uniqueness Manaus, comparing cities, climate. Brazil indeed warm country Brazilians lives near coast, weather dry. many people living Amazon area, big cities million) besides Manaus Belem, last one different climate lies close sea. check antibody Titer know vaccine actually worked, look number shots taken say fine. know personal experience shots work, likely I'm immunosuppressants. Likewise, old weaker immune system probably favors either, especially even manufacturer says vaccine needs time. half international tourism, domestic tourism really well. GDP grew nearly 3% last year better country except think China. Don’t get wrong, would great tourists could come back, it’s highly unlikely Vietnam take risk. Try next year. Nothing really stopping massive spread virus time. suddenly changed US makes suddenly better preventing COVID except vaccines. basically stopping US seeing another wave April/May? US never managed stop another wave, decreases significant since start pandemic, increases wave also significant far.

Is US national lockdown, countrywide mask mandate everywhere, curfew? really see anything US prevent spread B1.1.7 mutation blowing faces. Vaccines gonna help lot new wave February March. 

My country strictening lockdown applying curfew even though cases dropping weeks. 70% decrease since peaked Christmas last year. R 1. still lockdown, why? British mutation popping everywhere, R British variant 1,3. even strict lockdown, old variant disappearing, new variant speeding up. means eventually cases going lockdown. measures, would slowing while, new variant blows faces. Holy shit, bad headline. 

According text quoted Axios, Fauci ""I think that's one thing really got careful of. want beginning ... people getting otherwise, well, middle-class white people."" 

At least article, Fauci's saying United States get vaccines ""people vulnerable"" working instill trust among minority communities. literally paid for, gave EU Oxford/AZ vaccine.

You fucking not. EU invested lot money AZ, UK propably too, mean ""you paid it"". Oh stop. lock basement let normal people take super tiny chance order continue something important. Also OP, got felt like minor fever day....and headache. arm sore, too, bad.  headache second shot, know shot contributed that.

This Pfizer. I'd like see evidence believe it. ""The study Pfizer scientists University Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), yet peer-reviewed, showed less two-fold reduction antibody titer levels""

Can someone please translate means using following format...

The Pfizer vaccine mutations 95% effective, South African mutation ____ effective.

Does mean 95 / 2 = 47.5% effective?

This easier understand opposed many folds titer levels difference is. English original language. recipient first dose, next dose 2/12 allocations work out. mom received first sore arm. Second dose messed up. work healthcare facilities aware worst. attacked joints experienced fatigue week. sucksssssss got Pfizer’s weak day half. Couldn’t even take dog pee guarantee you, everyone else, watch daily death ticker horror 2020. Pffff 10M week. think line reasoning works explained why. math shows point make sense. actually translates perfectly 95% prevention rates tested phase 3 happened before? I’m sorry getting ridiculous 'One final push', 'one last hurdle', '2/3 weeks' hear phrases one time, swear God. sound like robots. hear dude, truly do. plan graduation go education plan executed buried desert years ago 'cause absolutely asinine frustrating things saw teacher-role models deal with. 

Unfortunately, *someone* it. Otherwise, there's intelligent people teach young ones grow stupid within century we'll living Idiocracy. Brain drain *cannot* happen education fuck entire generation more. There's reason Moderna Pfizer working booster vaccines South African variant shares several key mutations Brazilian variant... 6.4 fold reduction neutralization Moderna vaccine South African variant. Nop. Portuguese. started really good. people don’t know behave here. No. easy catch we'd now. catch socializing indoors people outside bubble. may achieve full herd immunity. Even still herd immunity translate covid. goal don’t get severely sick. That’s real goalpost right now. public emergencies cease exist. Careful.

Parents responsible teaching kids, basically parents also working remote don’t feel ability let performances slide work can’t pass responsibilities anyone else. Especially since there’s definitely shortage applicants right now. 

I’m also still amazed many teachers still literally can’t upload correct assignments consistently completely touch basic tech. Italiano? surprising all, reaction 2nd dose worse body recognizes vaccine already mounts immune response it, response makes feel crummy Cringe know moderna vaccine it’s effective new variants virus Pfizer, that’s fact.

Exactly 😂 It’s hybrid (thank goodness). words Journalism 101 guys enough now. countries (like South Africa) really struggling get, even ones made within borders haven’t blocked exports like US   Right - goal say “we sent ventilators”, actually increase appropriate treatment capacity. That’s based UK schools. believe masks distancing, also one things open time. would imagine hospital grocery workers similar rates. Also looks like self reported data ? there's bunch talk scottish independence? firefighters medics social workers jumping head line, glad personally agree many issues wear mask. 

Perhaps better chance listened coworkers. tried, gassed shot rubber bullets head others peacefully asked stop murdering black people. hope better luck did. “We’re sorry got caught.” American science best world!!!! probably are, take much longer.

Teachers essential required teach school. every teacher willing it, also choose move unable to. 

I understand last spring know going jumped close schools, time learn virus isn't. kids future need education best possible even understand themselves. thank done, really teaching home harder opinion teaching classroom.  Apparently pfizer direct access israels vaccination data swift vaccine rollout giving us information right help countries waiting vaccine. know impossible many complexities mrna storage transport believe everyone getting vaccine like really smash virus global scale. Iv listened two epidemiologists aus usa AZ 62% cover enough achieve herd immunity. Pfizer 60 70% population gets vaccinated.

Saves problem double masking It’s got safer indoor dining Also good advice strippers.  wonder kind adverse reaction had? Big true. recently read article new technology enabled existing drugs remain effective, I’m trouble remembering details. 

I believe made rounds another sub. Perhaps someone knowledge post article sub. Yes, yes would. 

Lol deserve vaccine. understand it’s oneself. deserve feel better situation. hope do, too. wife warning MONTHS! Im surprised took FDA long finally say something. Even now, im sure ppl like, ""what's big deal? hand sanitizer."" Without realizing cause blindness death. EU contract AZ, uphold. decided peoples live UK worth EU.

Most Pfizer 65+ infections actually 65-75 hence 75 group wide confidence interval, exactly approved 75s? Wipes? wipe off. spray let dry. Like hands stay contact minute. wiped off, cancel doing.

Ever see someone carry perfume? inconvenient that. Zero restrictions? Wow time vote buddy, that’s unconscionable Here's hoping that's is! Found tankie New Delhi [India], January 28 (ANI): India gifted 55 lakh (5.5 million) doses coronavirus vaccine neighbouring countries far, External Affairs Ministry said Addressing weekly briefing, External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava Thursday said India plans gift vaccines doses Oman, CARICOM countries, Nicaragua, Pacific Island states. 
Srivastava said New Delhi plans supply 1 crore 10 million vaccine doses Africa 10 lakh (1 million) United Nations health workers GAVI's (Global Alliance Vaccines Immunisation) COVAX facility. That's insane. you? 75 get well 65+ two preexisting (will extended 65+ soon) Yep, problem trials disaster.  messed dosing failed find vaccine actually works 65s - kind key demographic.

However, looking numbers, share 2 million doses made UK every week going make much dent EUs problem.

Likely many world suffer EU scrambling recover position. One would hope there's culpability line this. multiple professions (dentists, nurses, doctors, anyone operating room, scientists labs) wearing masks PPE daily prolonged periods decades prior covid, we’d data back concern. 

But, isn’t. agree, Oxford would argue better vaccine work safe vaccine works safe.

Now I'm suggesting vaccines safe, trials took extra risk something go wrong could affect vulnerable groups likely worse outcomes.

http://archive.today/ Nope, got right guy. Big fan Shall Named sub. That's shocking. located, mind asking? figure all. Moderna says vaccine produces 17% many antibodies South African strain abd Pfizer says produced 50%. know exact real world implications that, idiot would say big deal. Probably correct, though think dissembling playing fire public health perspective. Texas, I’ve heard Reddit I’ve never heard used like real life. People use show thanks really pity someone. UK: Vaccine nationalism bad.

Also UK: signs contract effectively bans exports guys even read article. trashing media mindlessly. reporting concerns people studying situation. turned mutation caused vaccines useless 2x deadly would cry informed media. Read fucking ""Manaus already 75% people infected \[in spring last year\].""  variant U.K. took three months dominate outbreak England, P.1 took month dominate outbreak Manaus. addition, Manaus already hit extremely hard virus April. One study estimated population reached herd immunity virus able spread easily community.  ""While \*know\* exactly variant apparently successful Brazil, none explanations table good,"" epidemiologist Bill Hanage Harvard University Twitter.  that's saw,"" said. ""In fact, really quite dramatic drop-off sensitivity. saw half serum, antibodies significantly less effective new variant \[from South Africa\]."" far, scientists tested P.1 similar neutralization experiments, P.1 two mutations scientists already reduce antibody binding. UK already gathering data Cautiously optimistic here.

Spring near. don’t feel attacked. It’s particularly helpful response feel backed corner choice. 

But thanks listening empathetic. 

I wish could step aside mental, emotional physical wellbeing. can’t. it’s shitty spot in. 

I can’t wait year over. Pfizer. Israel rolled Pfizer civilians, Moderna Pfizer used military Yes really strange. getting vaccinated assume give name birth date check computer database. guess vaccinated first asked afterwords. 44% estimate blood donors. Many people donated blood specifically free antibody test. gives biased sample. Also, measured 44% increased 76% without much justification particular number. BioNtech developed coordination America. 

Oxford cool. 

Chinese Russian vaccines good body! recommend! sounds absolutely dystopian changed way live deal restrictions, we’ll change lift. Humans short memories, sometimes good thing. US export ban place. Make Europa Great  Semi topic, ""secret"" creating archive link? I've tried several time rarely successful. frustrating several subscriptions want share (usually covid related) articles friends/family. Maccabi Israel's second largest HMO following nearly 250,000 people received second dose 7 days ago (the point Pfizer claims vaccine gives 95% protection). group largely made elderly citizens at-risk patients, ones got vaccinated first. recorded, far, 66 people tested positive reported 66 contracted disease despite receiving vaccine, age 55, half suffer background diseases. experienced mild illness symptoms headache, cough, weakness fatigue. None hospitalized suffered fever 101.3 degrees. patients tested due exposure verified carrier.  data infected among vaccinated, test conducted among control group size 900,000 Maccabi members diverse backgrounds yet vaccinated coronavirus infected virus past. Among group, 8,250 active verified patients found test period.  comparison data groups shows vaccinated 11 times likely contract disease vaccinated, stage vaccine's effectiveness Israel 92% seven days receiving second dose. Maccabi emphasized figure considered excellent encouraging, since according experiment conducted Pfizer, vaccine's effectiveness 95% 28 days receiving second dose. Honestly, great! live EU pretty distraught vaccine situation. hoping shots April, group (healthy 30 years old) going START getting shots May. take account AZ delays. seen 82 year old father (in US) year half getting pretty tough. End rant. believe states, assuming u.s., establish priorities. Google Brazilian newspapers, use google translate. Look deaths state. google bat populations. matches thing Pfizer imports reagents outside Europe. happens Canada stops Acuitas exporting reagents Anyone experienced post-COVID symptoms months initial infection really need advice. gf really going it.. really tough time symptoms seems getting worse day. Extreme headache fatigue, chest pain, brain haze, blurry vision, lower back pain, extremities tingly legs feel heavy, shortness breath lot stuff.. 

I wondering anyone degree symptoms give advice far treatment used? it’s waiting game long felt little better? first tested positive March last year since symptoms. would get better time (not go away) come back stronger harder. 

Sorry kinda place really worried looking advice get... That's good know, even anecdotal. vaccine take? Yes agreed. everything could sidestepped AZ/Oxford ran decent trial saga continues. We'll see many doses delivered come end February. betting anything anything specific regarding vaccine. Colder weather, moving indoors, plus holiday season recipe disaster absolutely was. hoping see post holiday drop happened. Deaths always lagging indicator suspect drop well. new variants little concerned, growing optimistic worst behind us. Here’s hoping accelerating vaccinations weeks ahead Imagine dying due academic ethics. feel bad 65s EU right now. fuck happen lol? fuck happen lol? perspective, contracts conflicting other, get sorted increase production, fair option would split total production runs half EU UK. way least getting something. Yeah neither headlines. yeah dude we're aware variant. We're monitoring keeping tabs. Take breath. It’s also worth noting Israel significantly cut back testing.  low risk likely efficient vaccinate old people vaccine might work well enough? Sanofi suffered effect, participants trial received little vaccine. too-small dose generated adequate levels neutralizing antibodies adults aged 18 49 trial, adults 60 older generated lower levels neutralizing antibodies seen blood people recovered Covid-19 infection, Ng overall, think worth it. hope see reduction hospitalizations soon :)  EU contract, according european commision, includes UK plants plants vaccins EU made. fact AstraZeneca claim two seperate supply lanes (the UK EU) EU claim one supply lane probably reason UK get mentioned countries. March still part Q1 can’t explanation. There's indication that. Yes immune response good get older. things. No, developing booster shots ""out abundance caution"" ready case mutations later bigger impact vaccine efficacy. restaurant Italy Italian head suddenly become British either. Pretty much exactly home. There's always spray bottle 70%+ alcohol peroxide hanging next masks personal air purifiers right across front door. Masks get sanitizer use, everything enters house gets sanitized. keep least two travel bottles high quality sanitizer car, sanitize hands, phone, keys every time get going anywhere.

It clearly works since us essential workers regular exposure anti-mask shitstains, we've avoided infection year now. yet Pfizer Moderna pretty good data older 65. Trump signed EO prohibiting export. EO still place. recall contracts signed French firms NHS torn last year PPE supplies NHS desperately short on.

I'm guessing UK seized assets companies UK French govt would words that.

Peoples health relied PPE contracts. 

The EU moment making things worse think get much sympathy outside bloc.

Maybe instead making idiots demonising neighbour, ask buy license turn factories within EU making vaccine? India did? Months vaccine close approved.

The rest statement may correct however one whooping cough one example get vaccine protection better protection. nobody telling can't anything. Lol cmon first order priority.

So seen contracts ?

Can share us ? Virus still ahead. Community spread travel history. good. googled also apparently EU negotiations buy placed order yet despite months negotiations.

Sounds right. Maybe slight increase risk, maybe none all. Either way risk covid still extremely low since young. 1% IFR trivial. We're already 400K US 2M deaths globally. 

If trying trivialize idea suggesting increase responsible behavior decrease number deaths. ""My views"" expressed nothing ""moving on.""

They're merely stating facts: enough evidence say one way other.

If took indictment people choosing relax social distancing go see family friends, that's guess what? [I'm going even though realize know answer sterilizing immunity. vaccinating 65s yet. 10x people die age 65 unless vaccine 10x worse still better give them. depends contract.

Commercial contracts like queues. 

You last sign contract given absolute priority.

We'll probably dealing level COVID infections, fighting variants flare-ups, etc, rest lives.  point even people followed rules want reason live again. Link? Comparing anthrax Moderna tetanus, would say Anthrax still much worse Moderna worse tetanus. course worst part anthrax get 1 billion times lol. Many covid end hospital lung damage, loss taste months, heart muscle damage, long covid. sure point here. count deaths ignore side effects covid? Well, end hospital died. see countries retaliating here. Vaccine Efficacy (HIV negative) 60.1 % (95% CI: 19.9, 80.1) 

Vaccine Efficacy (overall) 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1, 72.8)

You compare HIV negative. 50% HIV positive. cant really compare apples oranges.

Pfizer Moderna HIV positive. Since immuno compromised. likely AZ efficacy going drop lot due SA variant (Matt Hancock suggested efficacy could damaged half due SA variant). Pfizer Moderna seem hold better Cuomo needs impeached charged this.  officials said new system would force companies disclose export plans, Brussels sought reassert control doses manufactured inside bloc. “Any exporting company would send national authorities plan export, when, on,” one EU official said. “National authorities would allowed check that, give authorisation refusal.” not? policy US UK.

Sure isn't. EU demanding UK's vaccine supply nothing UK. I'll leave show naive comment is: Liese, MEP German ruling party, foreshadowed “trade war” EU found retaliate blocking exports UK alternative “very good” BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine “produced Europe, supported European money … company [AstraZeneca] UK better think twice.” 
 
Germany's ruling party literally wants start trade war UK this, ""but issue UK"". Sure. Look, think everyone right suspicious vaccine developed less year. Maybe many want wait see aftermath results vaccine others everything went well, they’ll take Freedom stupid.

Keep making assumptions. CEO specifically? believe lot important people gotten Pfizer's vaccine point, heck, believe one Biden got Imagine hypothetical which, example, 5% population catch certain virus January. Everybody subsequently gets vaccinated vaccine 0% efficacy (say, dummy vaccine), next month, another 5% population still catch virus. 

By logic, would say completely ineffective vaccine 95% effective simply 95% population didn’t get infected, even though nothing changed pre-vaccinated post-vaccinated scenarios. whole body cringing Fantastic! needed good news. comment. turn chick fila’s vaccine drive thru sites we’d covid toast summer lol Im really hoping rates come outdoor requirements way dodo. thinking thing yesterday depressing masks are. can't wait end year headlines ""COVID-19 may thing past, could COVID-21 pipeline?""

Oh right, know trying bully UK Brexit popular choice massively distract failings, entire reason they're making public argument, working perfectly Europeans eager hate Brexit-UK Absolutely irresponsible UK give millions elderly. Seriously, could backfire hard. 
They could easily give moderna biontech vaccine elderly AZ everyone else.

But UK like this! AZ go elderly UK Biontech Moderna goes younger healthcare workers. It’s amazing sickening many people think words **Expendable** **Essential** *synonyms*. Honestly depressing? thin piece slightly uncomfortable cloth. makes depressed idk man thats pretty privileged life got. EMA apparently approved ""all adults"". Sounds like Germans got get dig in. Thanks support. :)  Disinformation helluva drug want fear life going buy milk. Good point actually. hopefully hit 10% make bigger deal it. finally hit yesterday depressing see everyone walking around mask everywhere.

I really can’t wait over. tracking data spread CT schools beginning year seemed case. However, weather nice enough many outdoor breaks lessons, schools hybrid, holidays.

Over past months data become much mixed, comparisons showing teachers higher positivity rates local communities. [This sums pretty well. could higher testing rates among teachers, states seem case. Congrats dose 1, end sight!

I may mentioned previous daily thread, Manaus issue blown proportion media. original claim blew threw herd immunity early study pegged infected population percentage @ 75%.

Turns out, study flawed. sample set drawn blood donor population tests offered free perk donate. great...if want sample people infected likely suspect are. Plus, blood center running study offering free Uber rides promotion; again, great want sample lower income folks already disproportionate risk contracting COVID. Frankly, design biased study tried. That's good point, wrote covered due age. 65 older crowd also working lowest priority group vaccine least impacted order stay home. Significant lower , effiency 70% means 70 % vaccinated people don`t get sick. rest stronger immun system respond well. 30 % likely get 
scratchy throat mild cold/sniff. May ask old mom is? currently receiving significantly less doses promised/negotiated. go ignorant ""entitlement"" comment, like people dying everyday need vaccine anyway... celebration articles US vaccines administered officially topped confirmed cases? big milestone across pond. hence approved numerous regulators age groups

Not single regulatory body properly approved vaccine. preliminary emergency approvals based incomplete data. 

In flu vaccines also vector vaccines like AstraZeneca one diminishing efficacy increasing age norm. without evidence contrary reason think efficacy elderly equally high younger people. 
(Although comment correct mRNA vaccines). Good idea local public health lead told everyone wear masks outside banned access tobaggan hills, despite staff saying kids playing outside cold high risk behavior.

I understand need restrictions, reached truely rediculous point. Right? sit get downvoted sub full baby’s takes potential threatening news chooses completely ignore it’s possible. virus around year already seen 4 major variants yet people choose believe it’s absolutely impossible variant comes current vaccine can’t cover fuck Portuguese government! joke measures been. table also says efficacy 62%.  I'm sure contract written conditions recognise earlier contracts also signed

That's happened. written including building new production facilities least major contracts.  Yes, literally last days EU demanding UK send large amount vaccines (up 74 million) citing 4 million (disputed number) coming Europe UK EU even signed contract AZ. It’s totally ridiculous frankly demonic claim would lead countless deaths UK due EU incompetence. fact think right everything produced EU countries beyond me, let alone fact didnt contract time. mean vaccinated people cannot contract Covid, therefore spread further? happy kick ass certain researchers. would steer clear news ""Variant X Z"". Unless specifically see Pfizer Moderna J &amp; J come say ""whelp gotta retool vaccine folks come get another shot"" speculation chattering heads want Eternal Pandemic.  come banshees screeching 3% drop... Sure UK stop exporting chemicals required EU manufacturing plants use solely UK production instead.

Such decisions possibly escalate! government always right. question. /s average American thinks 1 6 chance dying COVID. hundreds thousands times high young healthy people still substantially reality old infirm.

The media unequivocally failed job. logic EU stop exporting vaccine UK too. pfizer vaccine UK then. guess saying EU threatens that, makes sense UK budge, that's clearly EU protect citizens lives. used first AZ became available, health workers continued get Pfizer (as limited quantity).

The answer tests came back Tuesday night. infection tracing yet complete municipality therefore know brought infection Gerda's farm. However, likely virus came via someone staff became infected incubation period, according Babbs Edberg. staff yet vaccinated.

According clinical studies, Pfizer / Biontech vaccine provide 95% protection covid-19 infection. protective effect slightly higher younger participants older ones.

However, takes vaccination protection fully developed. gives full effect weeks doses, according Sweden's national vaccine coordinator Richard Bergström earlier January.

We really know people became infected, mild symptoms. noticed sometime weekend. infection may come vaccine started protect, says Babbs Edberg.

There indications mistakes made time vaccination, says. That’s rational approach. Right though herd immunity bust coming media.  may get there, won’t fully vaccine.

Yes, believe US better letting 400,000 die. need herd immunity something overwhelmingly affects small subset population? people 65+ mostly vaccinated, deaths drop flu-level, perhaps even lower heard one explanation interview - already country. countries rely commercial travel. commercial flights carry international cargo like medications, raw goods, etc.

So stopping travel completely really expensive sometimes impossible. monitor dripping facet time even capacity test hot spots.

You divide attentions nothing well enough effective.

Edit

For worth, reject notion. someone pro open borders, pandemic, first goal stop spread means firm lockdown.

I would rather eradicate virus first would allow us focus resources mandatory forced quarantines like many countries do. sounds like school right. can’t happening schools? use word “hatched”? It’s like wanted mutate \*huge hecking difference\* ""new guidance says wear two masks"" ""new guidance says masks really work unless double mask."" really enjoying pandemic much want extend fall another lockdown? that’s you’re asking for. 

We’ll tools available us end summer, morons seem hell bent keeping going long possible. parent that's kid bring home head lice relate.

Schools sespools sickness.  I'm waiting hear sold vaccines $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ Buddy 100MM already got sick virus, largely meaning go bars restaurants aka what’s already happening like 40 states. EUA first March, maybe.  Supply kicking mid-March. lucky. Nobody knows sure. Could week, could weeks. Probably 6-8 weeks. 


The average time diagnosed case death 2-3 weeks, iirc. lag death reported numbers really wide. Sometimes they're reported almost immediately, sometimes show numbers many weeks. unfortunately wrong. US vaccinating far slowly true. current vaccination rates reach herd immunity Spring 2022 almost research understanding COVID ongoing political factors make difficult predict ability distribute vaccine.

Fauci saying new things time proof he's unreliable, proof learning adapting strategies accordingly. Key 90 million doses AstraZeneca vaccine made Japan expected supplied country's vaccination program vaccine approved health ministry. Clinical trials underway.  supply vaccines behind schedule Europe countries, AstraZeneca aims stable supply Japan. damn shame Putin immediately politicized it

what mean this? Wait, taking screenshots teachers kid fully remote?  OP mentions superficial stuff like age, appearance even hair...

Why focus policy irrespective physical attributes?

President Moon Jae-in nearly 70 yet pushed hard Green agenda, greater welfare provision stimulus payments pandemic. School Board, State Board Education.

They usually people elected voters appointed local govt, pretty shitty. maybe meet help vote next time. Awareness needs raised people need involved levels politics, nothing change. It’s kind impossible many areas country right it’s winter. springtime though agree, outdoors would much safer.

I want ""kind normal."" want packed concerts events soon possible. thought Babylon bee article second. 700K almost given. around 500K excess death, next 3 months still kill 100K plus excess death. summer numbers low, ongoing. Covid still kill years come, millions antivaxers. I’m you. kids staying virtual school while. Nobody promise anything. many variables. Except there’s one thing know sure: one day — like miracle — disappear It’s frustrating watching kind thing happening here. kind bullshit that's left complain about, we're great shape. love it. Keep bitching. 50 people got vaccinated typed care less socioeconomic status was. bar soap water bottle work What's fun routinely deal European suppliers job, kings ""well need week, ordered 3 months ago"". study study claiming lower efficacy peer reviewed  like OP, also plan keep kids online schooling thing gets better. school full 600 students plus educators staff, likelihood people following necessary precautions time great. everything I’m reading comments, sounds like CDC doesn’t reliable data pull schools manipulating low Covid numbers. I’ll keep kids home longer. work educational institution, student recently asked process reporting faculty member disregarding mask rules. process exists. report students, faculty get power-trip undergrads without worrying repercussions.

To make matters worse, class could absolutely taught online, apparently professors prove class legitimate reason taught person, least, legitimate fashion.

To make matters EVEN WORSE, student professor's class already caught COVID-19, professor habit asking students remove masks asking questions. US, people *are* prioritized vaccine based age, job, health conditions . Anyone fits inside metrics phase get vaccine regardless race that’s way be. race excluded getting vaccine race prioritized get vaccine another. immunity timing really needs stressed. People think one shot arm = safe go hug Aunt Suzy way home. also OCD. worst fears realized beginning pandemic last year told therapist going crazy spraying things Lysol, washing hands cracked, etc. knew going overboard. replied ""well, right dont think that's overboard."" 😳 point else do? We're 10-11 months varying degrees lockdowns, draconian restrictions noticeable intrusions everyday life. sustainable even remotely reasonable expect society continue operating manner point. 

However, I've noticing shift tone past weeks even among taking things seriously remaining well-informed past year. anger. Anger fact we're still expected tolerate living like this. honestly foresee even dramatic shift come spring form mass noncompliance hit milestone one full year dreadful quality life. summer, I'd wager vast majority general public longer adhere public health recommendations restrictions despite numbers cases, deaths, etc. reflect time. 

The beginnings social end pandemic right now. historical pandemics played out, there's reason believe one play differently. Moderna currently conducting studies vaccine 12 - 17 year olds I’d expect read months. may options too.  Teachers cannot forced work feel safe so. School districts every right replace people believe science. teachers refuse work different anti-vaxxers. medical professionals. Nursing homes tons aid type workers. really hard work, highly educated. also professional staff - hesitant speak state training risk analysis. one posted also yet peer reviewed. mean? Apologies so, long day. laugh every time use ours. local distillery-made really smell mildly boozy. Apparently it’s use denatured ethanol instead using ethanol active carbon filtration, aren’t pouring bar mat residue!   I’m Texas teaching person since day Labor Day. think respiratory virus infection preventable illness, buying much Andy Slavitt propaganda. idea illness endemic respiratory virus somehow preventable.... it’s insane.

The reason lockdowns wasn’t prevent death. prevent death health care systems broke down. knowledge single health care system truly collapsed anywhere industrialized world matter level restrictions place.

Seriously, calling respiratory virus “preventable illness” one nasty disgusting bits propaganda come whole affair. Summer Brazil really hot. They're probably experiencing happened Florida. people inside AC, primed cause massive outbreaks. obviously read article can't distinguish words ""won't"" ""shouldn't"". Ebola stopped 5 days hard lock down.    right means nothing Reddit. We’ve person Texas since August... it’s nightmare... threaten go strike lose certification... meaning hard work become certified thrown window. Please explain why. think increases overall risk something? know tested asymptomatic cases vaccinated group? called accident. April, 1 month news even mentioned covid-19 country. many cases, yes. huge number people severe depression anxiety disorders reddit. Also lot spectrum. covid kill 1 million Americans.

With excess death may 700-800K. wrong prediction. already around 500K. Dieting got easier. Guidelines going 100% based many cases community. course, cases go vaccination goes up. frankly, warming weather you’ll probably see lighter restrictions see community vaccinated. ..can ask purpose? called ""going eat wife/girlfriend/friends"" really fun, try sometime think like we're talking. Agreed. Im Michigan wonder unreported spike weird bacterial infections. relatives families Ned Flanders mask types one got mono got pretty sick.... anecdotal still clue one got mono... bet good money damn masks.

Kids wearing masks... honestly think state endorsed child abuse. we’re talking 3,000 EXCESS deaths, deaths could’ve prevented, every single day. still things people associate lots deaths to... Would prefer story "" many deaths AIDS might think?"" Hawaiian population: 1,407,006

Yeah alright mate 😂 Gradually? state went 100% virtual schooling 100% in-person 2 week notice reason 2134938453945689 deniers anti-maskers actively fucking rest us. we've let virus hang around waaaaaay longer needed to, giving time reproduce billions times, comes mutations.

wear masks demand others around same. make lives deniers anti-maskers uncomfortable safely legally can. I'm different country, exactly like here. mask anywhere outside, minute get restaurant (where actually risk), masks off. Fortunately semi-outdoor dining norm probably big.

I get went whole hog mask policy never thought worth putting focus environmental factors, much important also somewhat determine mask effectiveness. Downvoting this. Ok, hospitals overwlmed countries severe mesures, like california. According you, Japan one highest death rate ignore pandemic lockdowns, not. mean...in places right now. April feel comfortable enough them, too. literally one study cluster wisconsin schools using masks compared state average, state notoriously lax mask policies. Like come now. That's super common thing, matter infectious long people dying getting hospitalized much. Means you’re likely get downvoted used everclear earlier last year. Bonus also drink it. People probably scared 4Chan Post 2020 January
I think it’s bullshit need keep terror alive advertising dollars. Vaccine “war”, hyperbolic language. actual competition war. countries well others poorly We’re going p good rate JJ mid Feb, totally blow doors open. caring company world, except gay course. read know obviously great news, look actual totals still feel depressed. think mentally accept going away (self-defense mechanism avoid disappointment) United States consistently 100,000 cases/day. I'm hoping happens within couple weeks. Summer 2021 finna movie Lol good thing start teaching 5 day person Monday 3ft distance 👍🏻 CDC saying already like part Florida, without vaccine priority. I'd lot okay least 50+ year old teachers level priority, especially since high risk health conditions usually enough get option teach students choose remote option. laid bunch teachers put 50+ students online class really need teachers teach one two periods day online. trust done safely admin competent well-intentioned, two things often case unfortunately. 

I love I've back able labs person students I'm also proud we've managed put together individual lab kits students choosing online also labs. I've seen online still pretty awesome high school level spent summer developing awesome chose online.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Team Pfizer !!! penalty corrupt dealings death bloodthirsty ape, work guy calls scientist amount idiocy spews disturbing. So, ventilation critically ill patients respiratory diseases gets pretty complicated pretty quickly. Sometimes patients lungs lose much elasticity pressure needed deliver certain volume air gets dangerously high. Sometimes patient need put mode ventilation supplies certain pressure rather specific volume. Sometimes multitude minor tweaks needed changing duration time ventilator allows exhalation.

Afaik, ventilator article basic ventilator basic 4 functions. adjust volume air, respiration rate, percentage oxygen supplied, much pressure lungs end expiration. fine basic vent throw someone ER ambulance someone knows comes along. would adequate ventilator ICU.

The question intent purchase was. Disaster vent? Sure. Supplement hospitals running short ICU vent? Nope. study isn’t looking SA variant exactly...they picked mutations test. helpful researchers know mutations worry about, doesn’t good job answering question “does vaccine work SA variant”. Awaiting second shot weeks. reactions it? Pfizer Moderna? post made collective r/Conservative heads explode Canadian, hopefully gets approved quickly. Pfizer fucking useless ATM. News make clickbait how, rising covid numbers got normalized stopped reporting much Christ Right! I'm parent two young children there's almost nothing I'd like see back school full time 5 days week, know what's list I'd like see more? end fucking pandemic. I'm half jealous Australia New Zealand (and many others) half furious country seemed understand getting pandemic control best thing economy freedoms. inexplicable graph. enough deaths reached herd immunity first wave (just months worth ""extra"" deaths; compared Peru 15 months extra deaths 2020), way fall fast first wave would extremely low R value presumably achievable overshooting herd immunity. course, data may unreliable.

What happened last two weeks specifically? everyone Brazil Manaus tell me: 
Is virus severe affecting everyone, read article somewhere saying nurse talking it?, asking Yeah doesn’t make tons sense me. enrolled kindergarten years ago kept going year year. enrollment year. 
So moved wouldn’t come back?
I guess it’s different NY. Funny would Chicago Teachers Association days ago [you lived 
 
 
If way make point lie personal experience, probably stay discussion. think it’s rural parts country. mom lives Cornfield, IL far they’re basically coasting due much lower population density. assume batch yes work together hospital. sure rest know sister got second shot Monday. vertigo, nauseous, tired, threw think. think wrong. live carbs, microbes crave carbs dominance, affect brain make want carbs. balanced microbiome reduces cravings allows think clearly, move comfortably, make better decisions. Trust me, lived ways old. secret good health balanced nutrition including assorted produce. Drink V8 eat multi-grain bread feel better lose weight. gave multiple sources hospitals overwhelmed japan.

You, hand, provided source excess deaths significantly lower.

You're one blindly ignoring facts here. Stay school, kid. basically living solely future right now. 1 year lives wasted. really understand hesitation get it. afraid times like potential negative impact. *Optimistic high five favor...

_stupid virus hoax ruining everything_ 

/s low excess deaths hiding pandemics still able see results hospitals excess deaths. parents encourage others disclose sickness selfish human beings. Hearing anti people about. Good news like makes smile does. Ignoring ridiculous policy would be, even evidence Latinos affected controlling everything race? Thanks! it’s remote teachers need masks? People downvoting speaking truth. need remember we're together. Back envelope I'm getting ~20m ~26m.

I think including second doses shipped yet. instance ""Second dose shipment distribution (28 days later) week 01/04"" shipped yet, February. include ~30m ~30m. ""Slightly"" makes think know less effective might really know ineffective yet. Otherwise, would able give numbers fuck took long? think vaccines work not? They’re quite literally effective ever hoped for. chances infected spreading teeny tiny percentage. I’m talking 5%, understand strongly effective vaccine is. Even exposed someone household, unvaccinated, chances getting spreading virus isn’t even close 100%. vaccine, almost nothing. So? tons excess deaths hospitalisation, means lot covid deaths. N95 masks 3% efficiency rate studies ive seen, individuals wearing correctly still distancing. im wrong im wrong please tell me, dont agree mask enough turned empty office space makeshift dorms, rounded kids isolated them. parental contact. Teachers stay well. Basically NBA bubble.

But appeasing parents making employees productive. That’s drove decisions. Unfortunately, still vaccine licensed anyone age bad situation everyone. Kids need school learn get benefits come school environment. Parents also benefit time away kids work etc. parents can't help kids study home. putting kids danger sending school well everyone come contact with, especially teachers classmates. think BLM protests Capitol riots certainly exacerbated people's frustration pandemic impact life even though that's events really about.

But yeah, agree we're told point restrictions must remain place despite cratered case, death hospitalization numbers due experts' fears could resurge new variant could become dominant something we'd see pretty substantial uprisings. 

People going along restrictions part a) metrics still ragingly high despite recent downward trends b) weather sucks US, people would naturally inclined stay anyway. Yeah mean people vacationing across country packing bars apartment parties fuck parents working, right? 

They predicted global pandemic decided kids. That's good news. 33 percent current population 20 million people uk. even ballpark  picture Gal Gadot singing imagine...or Ellen, ""quarantined"" mansion....

We're together! wouldn't. says box to. stepped away covid news month ago. personal issues spent previous 9-10 months checking sub daily necessary wellbeing. checked back yesterday, really surprised much gloomy stuff scaled back. I’m still gonna try limit time spend obsessing, wanted say appreciated that. Hey got that! 
It also changed color next week two. deep orange threw clear got it. 🙃 complete insanity whatever Less severe symptoms include sick one two weeks can't even get bed. Several students sick this. so, sorry. 5 month old can’t imagine work in-person. hope best precious baby. Time unions start suing negligence, malfeasance, reckless endangerment, whatever stick. Fuck shit. Yeah gonna sleeping friend’s house Go Montana! concerned would anti-vaccine.

From County's first public vaccination clinic takes place Sunday, Jan. 31, 7 11 a.m. University Montana's Adams hour announcement Wednesday afternoon, 402 vaccine doses assigned, according Missoula City-County Vaccine Coordination officials. doses available yet serve walk-in vaccination clinic intended individuals qualify Phase 1A priority recipients Phase 1B. Priority recipients Missoula County residents 70 older American Indians/people color 16 older.  everyone wants vaccine one, longer lead lockdowns.

The thing lot people don’t want vaccine. there’s bad enough outbreak, there’s going new restrictions. health department doesn’t get tell people “I told so”. government responsibility towards even it’s stupidest citizens. clear, concise, and....correct. Thank this. Yes online schooling sucks, it’s also temporary. It’s long temporary, eventually safe. yet. I’ve learned pandemic even guidelines set perfectly, leave small number individuals follow make things unsafe everyone. Take care instructional planning hours. turns like people teachers really bad estimating much time spend stuff. nice see willing stick blatantly false premise though.  
 
This statement literally meaning.  
 
In reality, teachers 7-8 hours in-class instructional time. also deal lesson planning, preparation, grading minimum. 
 
Wtf time estimates? takes lot time regardless estimate. Minnesota. No, even 8-9-10-11-12, probably older, can’t left home alone even don’t need constant supervision. Why? He's longer relevant. logic too. governor pretty much zero interest opening state, schools, removing kind mask mandate. lemme get straight need go take experimental vaccine even though I'm lowest risk group. still wear two masks, small biz town still die, dare see anyone holiday selfish murderer. Lol. would care deal? Yes, food smell change morning sickness, whether (normal) smell sets off. like wannabe grim reaper... They’ve already moved Brazil variant. It’s like fucking clock work point I'd wager vast majority general public longer adhere public health recommendations restrictions despite numbers cases, deaths, etc. reflect time. 

Then last 10 months then? Clearly strict compliance. sad developing countries bet cheaper options... is. 🤷‍♀️ That's good hear. know testing shown masks getting almost fitration new ones 40 hours wear. whatever comfortable with, cost adding up, get safely get life them. Teachers go back, need protected, high quality masks(and shields want) way. schools provide this. can’t work watch kids time even WFH. Watching kids takes full attention younger (I 3 6 can’t take eyes second) That's need get vaccinations quickly. less people getting there's less chance mutate Probably start seeing drop next week. pretty significant decline end February. conversely teachers back person since August get priority list? want 61 year old mom who's person whole time safe, we're looking maybe April May. US fifth world terms doses administered. US much greater supply countries, Moderna Pfizer vaccines manufactured US. 

The US good job manufacturing, poor job actually getting shots arms. propaganda. known fact that, like things China, people (especially frontline) allowed speak talk media. China closed system and, whatever reason, concealing evidence human human transmission.

You conversing literal Wu-mao. entire agenda muddy waters, spread propaganda, report/delete content opposes Chinese Communist Party, etc.

You going come understanding responding acting good faith.

Because bad faith actors design, best thing post sources address wider audience directly, pointing obvious propaganda find it. Even strains, Corona type viruses really mutate drastically simpler types. protein spikes pretty much mRNA vaccines training immune systems recognize. September reasonable time frame. pretty optimistic allows pull things done faster months. gonna lie really idea. Never Brazil myself, hospital work lot Brazilian immigrants working patients. stories told me, I'm guessing middle-class probably get AC? total speculation. poor people. horrific suffering trauma. safe. 

Then you’ll sorry. Asian countries like I’m glad we’re well comparatively, see health department handling *horrendous*. might ok, could also lot better. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Well, far know even current speed bump due capacity upgrade we'll still get 4mill doses total Pfizer end Q1 always committed to, closer end. pittance know 4mill always sad plan. Q2 supposed ramp quickly. EU export transparency initiative really affect us.

One could course weary Pfizer's promises, real test Q2 ramp we're *supposed* get serious numbers rather Q1 piddle..

J&amp;J behind getting manufacturing going. also promise US 100 million doses bye end June - probably priority ahead us. promising deliver customers contracted I'm guessing wont right away.

I'tll help us lot right away. Israel anyone read Boomlab report explained immune escape worrying unlikely huge effect vaccines. right, always scary here. Better hope parents find children's legally-binding paperwork filled signed non-certified staff... FAPE case waiting happen. Sorry aunt going that. leveling around country, going lot areas. That's really good news almost spring. Covid tracking flu season combination vaccinating likely sick die warm weather going give us breathing room get even people vaccinated. 20% people get covid even develop fever, I'm saying serious disease, things looking really good. vaccine rollout keeps ggetting better. even companies manufacture vaccines agreeing manufacture competitor's successful product get vaccines people. Yes, October 2030. point, clearly, major Western company partnered major Western university thinks Scary Russian Evil Putin Doom Vaccine legit based strong science, possibility exists bit better informed random Redditors. Supposed reach 95% seven days second vaccine study, published New England Journal Medicine,1 found vaccine efficacy first second doses 52% (95% credible interval 29.5% 68.4%), 39 cases covid-19 vaccine group 82 cases placebo group.

Seven days second dose, vaccine efficacy rose 95% (90.3% 97.6%), eight covid-19 cases reported vaccine group 162 cases placebo group.""

Not sure assumes healthy 7 days second vaccine. guy obviously larping. ""prophetic"" news Italy already announced lockdown, rest reads like made-for-chan copypasta. love media paints picture COVID incapable mutating North America. Nothing held back anymore. 2nd doses shipped along 1st. already reported. That's states given 25M doses far, holding 2nd shots themselves. Again, hear good answer thus far. Yeah, it’s fucked up, gonna disagree all. I’d rather somebody get read another story idiot destroying thousands doses due unplugged refrigerator conspiracy saboteur. I'm sure know yet. know slightly fewer antibodies produced (but still well number scientists estimated needed). different Manaus rest Brazil? mention fact people would FREAK even already did. Gun sales skyrocketed last March reason people thought could use protect virus. least month, already wild. Well, damn. It’s moving goal post didn’t clue timespan experience would March November, collectively bunch people think continuing distancing month two mass vaccinations best way end pandemic. Nobody suggesting keep 2022, take short term gratification instantly personal vaccination. serious health official who, point, thinks Covid become endemic.
And that’s ok.

You’re making sound like moving break up, absolutely okay. That’s terrible. Even live life endemic, fact Covid would endemic default makes life terrible. Asking educators sprayed animal intestines blood going home crowded dormitories marginally better prison wards isn’t asking we’ve asked meat factory workers. one’s saying “shut things down” that’s pretty nonsensical closing international tourists would’ve competent move. say wrong? gloomy fucking outlook. I’ve noticed media playing variants scare game. guess trying compensate drop clicks since trumps name isn’t headlines anymore. Make mistake, new variants like old variants death rate coronavirus continues drop. Nothing changed, except vaccine, media needs stick story. he's unreliable waves such. elderly neighbor died Covid Saturday (found yesterday). grandsons live house attend daughter's school ride bus. daughter's school listed outbreaks list, past present.

I glad chose virtual schooling year. heart breaks family, though. grandpa amazing gardener. youre good Also government paid large portion development costs previously well. ""slightly less effective"" look like? mean slightly serious symptoms? chances getting sick greater?  here. also use sanitize mask come store. go store saturate hands wipe everywhere touch cart. Hard find alcohol stores easy find Amazon. 99% supposed suppress information? haven’t seen articles suggesting people won’t able get together reach population level vaccination community spread down. sub become overrun anti-lockdown trolls FDA keeps list ones approved emergency use medical settings. right, fake, fortunately us, there's maintained list ones fake. five humans inside grocery store selecting groceries delivering trunk limits spread. Otherwise two hundred people store much likely multiple ppl already infected, many ppl infect, turn people go communities onward. really go straight curbside pickup, imo. kind agree. can’t spend next 10 years worrying variants. We’ve done job unlike 90% America. Lol
my garbage men risk lives every day pick trash, neighbor working shitty hours grocery store....
Teachers though....

Vaccinated teachers tho.... Broken Arrow suburb Tulsa, decent-sized Jewish community. (source: used live Tulsa.) still surprised Wow

im surprised though go South Africa test real thing? simpleton?  dude thing could make shit 2 days straight i'd still take Article ensure wide adoption new regulations, Austria said would distribute 1.2 million free masks. Large supermarket chains also hand free masks first days new rules.

Austria's population 8.9 million. VariantS

More come longer goes Hopefully we'll get vaccine long, although seems going slowly. Good luck stay safe! hyperbole, 100% expect teachers given increased duties responsibility without increased compensation backing administration, easily thrown bus something inevitably goes wrong situation they've placed in. parents actually try involve children’s lives give education. Instead sending underfunded public schools hope strangers them. Can’t get child learn online classes child pretty much screwed begin probably wouldn’t learning class education either. People upset actually spend time children they’d rather send away 8 hrs day. Let’s real 🤦‍♀️ really got comment... ? think okie dokie? fucking REAL! seriously, shit amazing! hope works aids.... incredibly simple point, one completely evaded worrying variants making vaccines less effective. Duh! 

I feel better now. Also concerning whether reinfections happening. Makes vaccine push much urgent. sad gives less hope every day. Thank btw, can’t imagine medical field time. Plenty us appreciate People manipulated badly. can't evaluate risk properly. got second pretty mild body aches/chills zero symptoms first dose. Tylenol helped it’s better getting Covid. Sooo exposed/sick kids removing masks lunch? 

Oh, that's right. course are. huge difference person wrong sometimes, person unreliable general. reliability being, again, entire focus discussion. KN95 approved CDC emergency use high quality. counterfeit garbage. Kinda way things china go. doubt mainstream media 4Chan Post, agree likely bullshit, supposedly pretty accurate now. wonder authorities take look it? got smelled like worst tequila planet. take deep breath use gives flashbacks time judgment nearly good. good now, so... Oh right, German politician. Germany that's trying get EU block exports vaccines produced EU. Fantastic idea! literally way 1000 vacant spots. think find them? assure better? even fully credentialed? new people jump work together first year. 2? unlikely. double masked, encounter brief, outdoors. Three good things. Yeah. avoid getting house. mean gatherings. go work. night shifts now. need groceries go early morning. bad thing coffees closed. country routine going expresso gather friends. don’t much. expresso machine house end save money. restaurants though closed, however sometimes order take out. help restaurants. small shops closed. never went anyway. work windowless office people, steps take mitigate risk spread? course wearing mask social distancing, anything else?

We still major political leaders saying March tourist come visit. democracy great ways, doesn’t luxuries authoritarian cultures others. clearly value economic success, shutting foreign countries wasn’t option. 

Our peers Europe. There’s APAC country comparable United States multitude reasons. It’s disingenuous argue otherwise. Congrats Vietnam incredible response. Wow, lots unpack here. First all, find nothing ""mysterious"" Covid vaccines- work pharma closely followed development since beginning. fully trust trial data would get vaccinated tomorrow could. husband physician he's vaccinated already, he's working Covid patients year.

To suggestion risk/benefit assessment related ""nurturing career""- well, certainly can't job without childcare, that's true. take leave absence schools closed spring, would quit entirely watch kids school year. primary concern actually education mental health; remote learning unmitigated disaster son (7), struggles engage Zoom, gone loving Kindergarten last year saying hates school, hates himself, wants hurt himself. Parents young children watching struggle suffer this, teachers work asses deliver remote lessons developmentally appropriate effective little kids, heartbreaking. 

Your argument amounts observational experiment teachers would merit conversation 9 months ago- closing schools point prudent decision, given knew time. many months data upon base decisions risk mitigation strategies, know safe ways in-person teaching. point keeping kids remote, especially young kids, harm them, needs factored risk/benefit assessment. probably excess production capacity, design already FDA approved, technically ventilator. 

That really criteria needed get money thrown early pandemic. almost jewish people Oklahoma. surprised never met one. I've wondering this, mass vaccination sites..... article say, Maccabi study lacked control sample, Cohen said general Israeli society treated “imperfect” control group, calculation indicates vaccine slightly exceeding 95% effectiveness predicted Pfizer’s clinical trial. live 21st century, surrounded best technology information ever planet. arguably educated generation history, yet people direction, consistent message, means trust source. People happier watching brain-melting television shows scouring memes iphones actually dedicating time reading articles fact-checking sources. 


It sad. Lockdown fetish mask worship strong here. Good thing explained perfectly rational factual manner twice then. Unless, course, particularly rational. people, swear. top things mentioned, there's also standardized testing, full assessments, curriculum changes, cohort planning, staff meetings, grade level meeting, constant parent contact every problem imagine sun. assure you, teachers sink hours work people regular jobs. problem estimating time stuff. Geez. Many sold countries lot also allow export China (3M) ... saw news early still remember Yeah time, virus shown conclusive signs slowing, vaccine rollout going poorly. guy gets it. Half people total denial. 

Why delay what’s obvious? That’s people gunning agree, I’m saying general kids don’t front mind all. Hopefully we’re decline 😬. Yup. focus media overblowing story that, end day, virus showing conclusive signs slowing. Also, thanks Rupert Murdoch Fox News... That, previous administrations absolutely _abysmal_ response. really know people became infected, mild symptoms. noticed sometime weekend. infection may come vaccine started protect

Those good signs: may gotten sick immunity, illnesses seem mild. Incredible still around. doesn’t mean let run wild. 

Herpes, it! Lmao Anglo bias circle jerk thread, shit sub. Worst envision, one country supporting one side/state/faction other. type global pandemic really helping unite countries conflict rather divide though. 2134938453945689 deniers anti-maskers actively fucking rest us.

Right, anti-maskers deniers reason close borders consistent science-based plan year ago.  wow pfizer one two folds moderna 6 folds, wish took pfizer Thank you! even know! CDC doesn’t find evidence schools safety measures place time kids return classroom. Listen science.

Still, early days. ""We found potent inhibitor SARS-CoV-2 replication, clinical trials still needed find whether provides benefit patients,"" added Garcia-Sastre, director Global Health Emerging Pathogens Institute Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai New York City.

Because plitidepsin antiviral agent, ""it inhibits replication virus needs given active replication phase COVID-19. Similar remdesivir antiviral drugs, sooner given you, better chance effective,"" lead author Kris M. White, PhD, assistant professor microbiology, Icahn School Medicine Mount Sinai, told Medscape Medical News.

A Paucity Therapeutics

The investigators point current therapies patients COVID-19 include oxygen treatment, ventilation, remdesivir, steroid dexamethasone. add ""remdesivir particular shown limited efficacy dexamethasone steroid directly inhibit viral replication.

""This leaves continued need development repurposing antiviral drugs treatment COVID-19,"" note.

Given need effective therapeutics, investigated repurposing existing agents. led investigate antiviral potential plitidepsin SARS-CoV-2. Plitidepsin initially discovered sea squirt Aplidium albicans.

In human cells Vero e6 cells, kidney cells derived African green monkeys, investigators demonstrated cytostatic effect plitidepsin. added antiviral different time points 24 hours. agent significantly reduced genomic RNA content 8 12 hours post infection Vero e6 cells fell ""just short significance 24-hour time point,"" note, similar remdesivir.

""This laboratory study plitidepsin showed drug hits one targets animal cells SARS-CoV-2 virus needs replicate. cuts virus replication vitro, though 24 hours statistically significant reduction amount viral RNA,"" Robin Ferner, MD, told Medscape Medical News when asked comment.

""It also reduced infection mice given virus,"" said Ferner, whose honorary posts include professor clinical pharmacology University Birmingham United Kingdom associate professor University College London.

Findings Validated Mice

Garcia-Sastre colleagues showed nearly 2 log reduction viral titers SARS-CoV-2 lungs mice treated plitidepsin compared others treated vehicle control.

""These experiments show plitidepsin treatment reduce replication SARS-CoV-2 2 orders magnitude reduce lung inflammation vivo significant potential clinical efficacy treatment COVID-19,"" researchers write.

Ferner raised caveat regarding potential adverse effects. ""The drug used experimentally treat patients with multiple myeloma, adverse effects common included raised liver enzymes"" 2019 study, said.

On positive note, plitidepsin ""has cleared first hurdles long steeplechase show clinical efficacy COVID-19. runners fall long end race,"" Ferner said.

Future Implications

Interestingly, dexamethasone also commonly used treat people multiple myeloma. ""This led plitidepsin already established safety profile concurrent dexamethasone treatment allow clinicians treat drugs warranted,"" researchers note.

In bigger picture, eEF1A inhibition might may good drug target human coronaviruses unrelated viral pathogens. ""This potential broad-spectrum antiviral activity makes plitidepsin intriguing candidate exploration treatment viral infections clinically approved therapeutics,"" researchers note.

""We would like study antiviral activity viruses vitro animal models, hope results accelerate execution phase 3 clinical trial,"" Garcia-Sastre said.


From article NYT didn’t like 170 history behind it, would definitely seen something like national enquirer. They’ve really gone downhill last 10 years could blessing disguise.

The strategy vaccinating oldest oldest weakest weakest (European countries almost focused care homes staff) might give good numbers Covid World Games faster, little public health postpone good number deaths months. people active social lives, jobs, hardly transmit anyone outside care home.

Vaccinating people balanced age range (old enough Covid serious risk, still working socially active) would logically best option interrupt transmission faster.

This would good idea. Use Pfizer Moderna done, try AstraZeneca vaccine younger people. study suggests even spike create autoimmune problems. they're 'fucking useless'. Right. “The report AZ vaccine 8% effective elderly false! It’s 6%...” EU producing vaccines world. built vaccine factories, UK didn't. would every right stop exporting vaccine contracts fulfilled. 60 years old history high blood pressure slightly overweight says nothing reaction was. literally could passed away uncommon 60 year old people die least expect inconvenient times. agree frustrations concerns, point remains, 'fucking useless' incredibly disgusting entitled way get across. yet EU frothing mouth trying get hands it. Canada banked consistent deliveries promised Pfizer ensure timely access second dose.

Them suddenly changing delivery schedule means might enough doses everyone's second shot ontime.  want thicker? 🍆 🍩 Yeah, NGL, actually surprised hundreds holocaust survivors still alive. They've already hitched cart ""THE VARIANT!"". really need take next month falling hospitalizations, deaths, increasing vaccinations good news business. variant take hold future talking points be:

1.) Long haulers

2.) Vaccine approved kids yet

3.) Second third world vaccinations

4.) completely unforeseen (please note sarcasm) economic educational devastation 12+ months lockdowns. article definitely gives hope. husband monitor Worldometer daily case numbers come significantly, daily deaths still close 3.5k/day (some days 4k). Anyone know why?

Back late Dec, 7 day case avg 250k, recently 175k. 7 day avg deaths late December around 3.3k, recently still 3k.

Is still likely 2-3 week delay deaths, ideas? ""control group"" *has* closed airports. Yes, started LGBTism. Well thats slightly concerning. get vaccine years yet 20 something. Moderna says vaccine still provides sufficient protection, that’s good enough average Joe.

With 6.4 fold reduction, numerous individuals 56-70 71+ cohort would neutralizing antibody levels lower lowest convalescent patients 3 months. 18-55 cohort well. 
  delays cost lives, understand frustration. instance, last week Pfizer reduce shipment EU, today cities Madrid Barcelona halt vaccination. happens many EU countries. disregard problens causes, lives may cost IMO I'm sure we'll know really obvious. variables so... Variable huge drop cases could due anything, point obvious vaccinations. new tweet. Old one incorrect: uk didn’t make hash vaccine procurement though, EU did. Yeah, rich countries arguing month vaccine delay... Must unbelievable watching around world... Well... absolutely unbelievable even watching here... Humanity bad place morality-wise... think covid fully eliminated, never said would be. Measles probably be, though. You’re literally continuing argue sides blame something president United States stuck arguing drug could turned good that’s totally irrelevant conversation. It’s little infuriating I’m seriously done. seem want last word, go ahead.

Obviously ideal received soon possible, far cry calling 'fucking useless' entire point regarding entitlement initially allow people who'd prior reaction flu vaccine covid vaccine. rates anaphylactic reactions 5 times higher time newer report suggests. Upon analysis, people allergic flu vaccines excluded vaccines going forward. 

What talking many severe adverse events cause, hypothetical.

Edit: thanks replying! “You take covid masks tests shove ass” 

...... whoops  Myalgic encephalomyelitis swine flu infected prevalence something like 1-2 per 100,000 infected, little less twice ""background"" rate, virtually zero vaccinated. 

And killed maybe 12,000 US. Comparing two *at best* disingenuous. would take several mutations. would take mutations compounded onto variant EU seems saying AZ fulfilling promised deliveries. AZ says contractual problem EU.

EU saying, delay, would accept proper communication since Pfizer. AZ seems gone straight defensive mode; seems making things worse two parties.

They saying, AZ issues, say so; instead came ""contracts issues"", meaning, EU still expects deliveries since reasonable excuse presented.

I'm guessing based know. included production UK plants

Yes get capacity UK's production run. data. data shows enough cases happened vaccine placebo group 65s. enough data great confidence efficacy different. Come on. Biontech EU company. Vaccine developed EU, produced EU exported EU least Israel, UK Switzerland. think China trolling rest world already getting regular shipments, suddenly cut production barely notice. worry, reason media invents good news. syndrome, sometimes referred long Covid, include dementia, “brain fog” joint pain.

Honestly beginning sound like ""long covid"" actually autoimmune illness like fibromyalgia triggered covid. Got placebo trial. Still can’t get vaccination promised trial participant. Ah, get it. Thanks context. specified diseases. people die, die infectious disease like covid. stuff like heart disease still considered disease really cant compared infectious disease. scarier simply near people lead death overwhelm hospitals Sorry incapable understanding purchase commenters usually praise China RiGhT That's good point.

After got 2nd vaccine, posted joke Instagram like ""T-minus 10 days till run around licking subway poles!"" half friends responded ""omg, safe keep wearing mask.""

I'm happy wear mask required, think universal policies make sense carry vaccine card around masking bother me, extreme reaction. AZ made contract EU included production UK plants. AZ delivering doses promised. hard understand ? picture indication, hope least use different swabs nose part  like EU, seems, given amount Q1. probably meet deadline boost production Belgium.Fortunately, Pfizer owes doses, consequently deliver. But, due delay, present time helpful enough CAN. rule , exception DNA-vaccines like one AstraZeneca less efficient older people ( example common flu vaccines).

There ""DNA-vaccines"" like one AZ (and soon J&amp;J) market anywhere AFAIK, certainly current flu vaccines, I'm sure comparing say there's RNA-vaccines like one Pfizer Moderna complete opposite , efficient older people. Oversimplified problem RNA-vaccine tha try fill ad something glass already full ( immune system).

I've seen anything supports that, explanation make sense all. OKCPS decided contract third-party private company called Passport Health set vaccine POD district employees. seen many state move jump line ahead others phase 2 vaccinated yet. really served entrench idea many Oklahoman's minds teachers selfish, lazy, entitled- much we're willing cut line ahead adults comorbidities. conveniently ignores slated start vaccinating teachers \~Feb. 12, following hierarchy vaccinations state, superintendent making abundantly clear vaccine deliveries would ""intermittent, limited,"" effect, people vaccinated first teachers age 65 comorbidities. Common belief young teachers (which make TON staff OKC turnover rates high) probably start see first doses maybe March. UK order enough vaccinate 28.5m people pfizer/moderna enough get elderly vulnerable vaccinated 2. factor ordered vaccines right now. EU substantial order pfizer/moderna they're hardly getting yet hence vaccinatiimon programme gone extremely slow. Even UK placed larger order would still relied AZ time due low supplies pfizer/moderna. They've also ordered 30m J&amp;J understand that, also seems like vaccines still effective. 
 
From scientific perspective - significant difference interesting note.

But average Joe - want shot allows us get back normal. Moderna says vaccine still provides sufficient protection, that’s good enough average Joe. 

I would bet there’s probably negative correlation moderns’s effectiveness variants age, maybe boosters needed ‘more risk crowd’ - doesn’t sound like we’re going shelter place booster distributed SA variant - think assumption proven otherwise future variants : slight negative devastating blow. Brazilian variant completely hairless far know safe enough rounded zero - serious complications tens thousands people trials, nothing serious reported millions people who've gotten since approvals (admittedly less well followed trials, still).

Either way, clearly agree think worth saying skeptics, *certainly* low enough rounded zero compared actual virus. Even healthy guy 30s might 1% chance ""bad"" case including long term side effects, vaccine tens thousands times less likely give real bad time virus. Hence I'd absolutely take week bed vs small chance random stroke heart attack like we've seen virus. patently untrue ridiculous. Well EU says contract includes production factories UK. say contract worded right ask doses produced UK. French population isn’t going commit actual lockdown, what’s point curfew? Healthy adults allergies. doesn’t mean anything, especially literally millions people vaccinated without issue. Stop fear mongering internet points. It’s beyond disgusting. Hi all—does anyone idea might know whether vaccines reduce spread virus? LBH first wave mask burning happen June. bye bye fuck Zoom bashes. Reddit: Employers care workers treat like slaves!!!

Chick Fil A: We're closed Sundays workers enjoy day off.

Reddit: EW, GROSS HOMOPHOBES!!!1  FDA relying US trials. Oxford trials UK Brazil mess...don’t go trying unfairly bring race this. Glad lost oil pipeline expansion project. Based what? Sorry verb tense problem. *made

that's worry them. heard school district near quarantining student COVID-19. kids class quarantined. Yes wearing masks, least 6 feet part. Oh teacher quarantined either. whoever quarantined. 2nd famalies..... lower deaths/hospitalizations enough get people take proper precautions would've done back last July lol.

Promising ability eat inside Chili's seeing Black Widow crowded theater might hope actual F? child’s teacher, class day, doesn’t count close contact. glad live somewhere that’s remained virtual whole year. 50% drunk mistakes.... .... Yeah placebo vaccine count type comments becoming minority. tide turning. scare you? Conservatives accuse anything toeing Trump line crazy liberal. I'd take grain 9f salt. Wife teacher TX (DFW suburb), another teacher tested positive told district symptomatic could still come work need wait negative test result. going great Governor Abbott thanks asking hate this, really going hate whole trump presidential timeline comes hidden data. Ha. Guilty. Great! Going back face face next week, can’t wait. \*cough\* Osterholm public schools Kentucky’s two biggest cities also online entire time. thankful live god forsaken state. least governor superintendent believe Covid give shit teachers kids. private schools also open here, cap numbers distance way effectively. They’ve also go online weeks least one point. lack clear achievable goal causing many people flip bird this. 

As done last March.

If someone tells something big may happen near future, best offer timeline. Otherwise, they're bullshitting you, one blame buying it. government buys us company founded 2008, selling AutoMedx SAVe II ventilator since 2017 hurts knowing vaccine surplus growing 22,600,000 chilling freezers watch do-nothing govt. vaccinating 24/7? asking much teachers online education reality students. student net home, give alternative education method. Finally! good reason go Olive Garden. America new Rome. envied admired feared once. That's attitude comes from. see 330% study pushed teachers' unions call study CDC: Many people seen ""too little carrot, much stick"" action saw last March.

It *ever* going ""just two weeks"", hard believe ""official"" timeline pushed right again. number daylight hours still changes That's definitely false, EU already received around 17M doses. know Spain 10% EU hace received 1,7M doses already! See, maybe public health officials need come terms fact stuff like constant mishaps cause people distrustful ultimately listen end mattering. No, don’t think malicious thing California purposefully hiding things make seem like virus worse is, fact happens lead think that.  vaccinated peers *don't* wear time anymore. People like never want normal return. admit, enjoy Covid lock downs restrictions. probably frightens think U.S. return normal. also live middle nowhere. went trade school last 2 years. 3200 students still wasn’t class 20. is, represents happened several weeks ago, sometimes months. Definitely good Pfizer/Moderna. least enough people vaccinated get herd immunity.

not happening

full stop EU demand Germany etc. negotiate purchase

They clearly did. legal power that's mean, President Commission Angela Merkel applied political pressure end achieved. Trump become chancellor???  mate, really needs learn something. Let help out:

http://www.interleges.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Best-Efforts-Clauses-Common-Law-and-Civil-Law.pdf Glad I’ve stuck Bath Body Works throughout last year disagree teaching home same, see point. find odd become thing whole country made responsible shouldering this. It’s fair anyone. certainly school essential lot functions reopened, far less pushback employees. people shouldn’t push back, feels like teachers somehow made anyone else trying navigate shit creek. remember hated people Dallas. like think one kind welcoming ones. I’m sure long ago lived Austin, assure point derision Californians, Dallasites. Little know time.  kidding, Californians. Hang there. get y’all flocking here, especially now.

It fairly recent (2015-2017). yeah, think I'd receive hate Californian, I'd hated matter Texas went.

I appreciate one welcoming ones! I'd definitely say 95% people nice friendly, but, overtime, vocal Dallas haters started get nerves. Austin still lovely city there's reason many people want there, could without haters..haha.

I try welcoming well, know like receiving end family actually Canada, hear hard. God, insufferable insecurities comparisons. Yeah, yeah, universal healthcare, know, know. still love them.

Ah gotcha. Canada definitely seems lot hate towards America. Again, I'm generalizing case everyone, definitely understand frustration.

Hope 2021 well. Looking forward road tripping Austin things start opening back visit friends seen while! sister friends nurses they’re feeling sick vertigo since day took vaccine. personal experience figured i’d add mix. relative who’s severely risk got COVID scared shitless getting vaccine too:/ actually well far. number new cases hit lowest point since early November continuing decrease. number known active cases dropping month. Deaths little eratic dont exceed 100 deaths often ever 150. actually 39th deaths per 1M 33rd cases per 1M need shit. anyways, I'll agree sub whole like vaccine posts never denied that, initial comment directed many people tend respond good posts negative shit lol like sub gives two fucks abt health antivaxxers. Welcome GA. ruling GOP party pure idiots. think place tested true live virus South African variant South Africa. already dominant there.
 
Wasn't one Pfizer Phase III studies South Africa? Seems like would easy source samples fully vaccinated subjects lab tests (test tube, obviously). Also, variant become dominant there, degree? Pfizer obviously still tracking Phase III subjects, it'd interesting know field data. need understand America new Rome. centre global civilization yardstick every country compares itself.

America greatest people world rotten, smartest dumbest, richest poorest. land contrasts everyone find something great something terrible it.

You hear people boasting bashing comes insecurity sometimes fear America could really turned nasty. Everyone opinion America America impacts everyone.

I'm telling non American friend.  lot people become felons next years. problem isn’t kids getting sick, it’s staff. Nobody wants sub ppl covid. pay isn’t worth it. Reuters reports effort completely standard clause signing contract company product yet exist,” one official said. “Obviously cannot put completely legal obligation” conditions. 
But official said best effort meant company show “overall” effort develop deliver vaccines.

It's need learn something mate. There's reason UK deliveries ""best efforts"" EU are. 3 months lag US investment production infrastructure part that. EU directly caused AstraZeneca saying gonna reduce amount vaccines 60% ?  summed well last paragraph. think constant, negative news making people feeling even hopeless. probably opposite effect ""experts"" trying do. sometimes think, ""fck it, even bother anymore?"" could state many perfect humans something like this? /s Next school year public schools aren’t “normal” going mad rush private schools. damn well know they’ll loosen up. moved 6 years ago regret leaving sooner. Hope able find happy place ✌️ You’re right, missed part EU hasn’t even approved use vaccine it’s trying hijack. toxic nonsense. people Reddit Americans US main focus here.
I'm Australian happy given state play much world, that's say Australians like happy what's happening elsewhere.
From perspective I'd happy see vaccines allocated Australia distributed places need do, US, Europe, Africa wherever, would mean international borders would closed longer live means saving lives life pretty normal here. Amen, sister. kiddos. I’m gambling health baby’s.  Sending kids die highly contagious disease causes pulmonary failure potentially infect kill family members others come contact profits damn sure is. ...and entire discussion backing point. opinions led post dumb article. it’s over, rubbing alcohol much safer peroxide. Peroxide causes free radical damage cells, mutation risk. Kinda like UV light. Yes EU physically taken vaccines destroying future supply vaccines cos AZ would longer want supply can’t reason people want miserable. really rare class size. 30, high 34. school one less 30. elementary school. gives hope. hope trajectory stands. laid press conference. reporting bit shoddy￼

Regarding widespread “I think spring,” said. “But it’s going logistical challenge exceeds anything we’ve ever tried said feels “confident” summer, “we’ll way toward heading toward herd immunity increasing access people aren’t first list, way going children.” That’s bad batch. It’s good batch wasn’t kept right temperature. Meaning wasn’t handled properly. article OP clearly states administration doses be. point is, batches rigorously tested leave plant. never glad live freakin Kentucky life. kids still virtual schooling. never went back year. superintendent takes Covid seriously incredibly grateful. Exactly, polls Israel showed 20% population willing get vaccine right away, we're already past 30% vaccinated still lots demand go. end. Always.

why kind ""new normal"" talk bullshit start, even vaccine, we'd go back normal years. deny that, need learn read properly. I'm saying sub loves vaccine posts like one. Don’t blame one bit. read re-write different (reliable) source chose post original article referenced, regardless that, Reddit. people find topic worth discussing, they'll upvote it, opinions matter nothing anything. Unlikely, case, contract signed September, AZ claim 3 months behind would also complete lie. also claimed forced wear seatbelts crucifixion defending guys, totally understand April purchase. time, everyone thought vents determining factor someone lives dies huge rush acquire many possible. point later understanding virus, realized vents weren’t end-all, be-all previously thought. question whether known June purchase almost 4x much April one. doesn’t matter it, isn’t spreading something evenly, it’s made look stupid lack planning, lashing trying take stuff people prepare.

The EU basically like Negan Walking Dead, older, whiter even stupid.  Kids don’t die Covid hoax anyway, keep school. /s seems like they've basically head stuck sand whole time.  Well, least media got couple weeks worth “the vaccines won’t work. Here’s why” pieces. Wow. right time vaccine available everyone. Otherwise, create haves-have nots scenario risk lot need vaccinated yet (healthy adults 50) claiming health issues try get vaccine now. hopefully approval 16-18 year olds 

Pfizer already approved 16-18 years old, Israel vaccinating demographic. They're trials approve vaccine 12-15's well, that's going take months, perhaps approval Q3. Wanting schools open get people educated isn’t greedy. wrong you? We’ve told entire time shouldn’t take next extra precaution would pointless, months later get benefit hindsight wish take extra precaution life would much better. seems like another one things. long term won’t care adding another month two Covid social distancing. care Covid restrictions becomes occasional thing part life. 

I’m defeated told something aiming impossible, finding possible done it. Unpopular opinion: voluntarily paid provide something used public good might allowed receive benefit said asset. mean, get fair certain perspective... but... life. worst thing think of.  Likely production started site EU signed contract. Spinning production sites UK order may even sped EU production, gave time get process optimized.

It's thing happened Pfizer. order 3 months (AZ) 5 months (Pfizer) countries, get deliveries later. Commission explicitly warned contract signed. Whoooa...ultra liberal Inslee stepping tell teachers get back it. Interesting. 
Tell governors aren’t scared political minds. didnt. deny there's far gloomy articles comments stupid lol said, absolutely clue ""best efforts"" means.

Google , maybe learn something. know I'd call spike. 7 day average deaths fairly flat two weeks hospitalizations falling. expect deaths decline similar manner short order. [The IHME model decline start around Feb 10. I'm going bold say downward trend start today! I'm aware Pfizer Moderna vaccines authorized Emergency Use? exactly difference full approval emergency use? 2.68 million children US tested positive virus January 21, according American Academy Pediatrics, number infections increased recently. CDC ""certainly concerned"" variants encouraging public health departments look cases, Campbell added. CDC advises parents caregivers contact doctor right away kids fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes extra tiredness.  whole child thing COVID cloaked slight hand. Much time, mild symptoms say children typically display give adults (including DRs) excuse test. - child displaying cold symptoms, acting sorts - cold, testing. Or, would soon test - understand one, relation exposure, child displaying symptoms. - swept rug, tested. beat goes on. kids think able shake COVID well, infect adults around them. 

It's ridiculous, sad statement society teacher's place risk along hats wear parents ""busy"". No. Herd immunity end May?? Yeah right lol general public gonna access vaccines starting April. take 4-5 months get everyone fully vaccinated (especially 2 doses). Herd immunity achieved US end summer May. know Europe variant wave. pray loud US doesn’t. Disagree. one point this. Cases consistently dropping weeks, test positivity rate going down, people getting vaccinated hour. Covid likely never eradicated. People get long time. return regular life point, metrics heading right direction so. underestimate compliance generation. dig teachers. btw. 

Oh mrs robinson No, trials people infected (despite screening measures) report problems. Per article - 

“At least six cases mutant, contagious COVID-19 strain United Kingdom confirmed Georgia, Georgians way knowing it’s spreading communities.

That’s state Department Public Health, tracking new variant, refuses say cities counties people infected. department contends revealing could lead discovery names patients, violating privacy rights.

Several states, however, identifying counties cities variant cases detected.”

This irresponsible total bullshit excuse privacy concerns.  Huh? analogy made makes zero sense. article tell avoid anything - simply stating information. probably inhaling many toxic chemicals air fresheners. Case Reinfection

The case patient led alarm 45-year-old woman healthcare executive. comorbidities. team following healthcare professionals patients tested positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing understand whether represented cases prolonged viral persistence new infections.

The woman symptoms viral infection two occasions (May 26 October 26). occasions, results RT-PCR testing SARS-CoV-2 nasopharyngeal samples positive. first episode, patient diarrhea, myalgia, asthenia, odynophagia 7 days. returned activities 21 days later. second episode, severe symptoms lasted longer, still require hospitalization.

""It first confirmed case reinfection Bahia, second episode, observed mutation could impact ability antibodies neutralize virus,"" Souza said. ""The research continues investigation cases patient positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR interval greater 45 days, higher level evidence."" cases fatalities among younger people, illnesses fatalities among older people. Currently older prioritized vaccinations probably we'll see decline hospitalizations fatalities first see broad declines cases. Every fucking pandemic-related phrase cringeworthy, I'm you; one takes cake. bought start pandemic literally smelled like kerosene vomit. return walgreens. anyone explain cdc says 47M delivered Pfizer Moderna ask Pfizer Moderna say aggregate 60M delivered (not counting week). See links below, CDC contradict 47M number. 

To clear, said nothing held back anymore. issue 2nd doses held back (which reason cdc says 47M delivered, half administered). links literally break state week, add 63M. Like +15M doses vanished thin air??? WTF? 

This matters helps us understand many doses going get. may end 15M doses less ordered reason never know. suggestive evidence infections mask protection might milder infections unprotected masks, see effect, exists, would cascade people around you. infection different. Australia too. like shut borders single case arrived. became apparent serious virus was. even domestic travel bans one point. def be, government bases restrictions hospitalizations, hospitalizations non existent end may, warp speed expects herd immunity end may, many experts expect close normal summer, go on...

Just put together, things gonna fine People rightfully scorn Daily Mail Independent bad somehow gets free pass Reddit. 10 month mark faced music, let go hope kids returning public education left system (home school/private school). I’m sure many parents like public schools across country (I’m NY). 

Side note- likely never go back remainder kids elementary/high school education. already give career track essential field (in person) current set gives us much flexibility control lives. damage done moving forward. mayor LA kept trying push push open schools even though ""COVID numbers deaths increasing"" radio TV eeeeverday. 

Thank goodness head LAUSD LA like uh hell. School's plan money properly follow guidelines. 

So stupid. We're already seeing case reductions, think really tell what's vaccinations what's happening anyway. Bubonic plague multiple waves including devestatig Rome. usin one specific wave Indi cherry pickung 21-24 days lag keep seeing mentioned. want get vaccine called Sputnik V? district allowing basketball. masks games. Practice organized 13 min sessions. Want know why? State CDH requires contact tracing individuals 6 ft proximity (15 minutes more). 13 min sessions, absolve responsibility propogation year long pandemic. Fucking Savage. Teachers got tiny little raise (now make around $38k instead $33k?) , it’s mostly old old. ask give lives, dreams, future. get return? “yOu SeLfIsH gRaNdMa KiLlEr!1!1!1 dOnT kNoW rEaL sTrUgGlE lIke!1!1!1 wOuLdNt SuRvIvE wOrLd WaR II!1!1!1!1!1” SF? 7 day average 83K peak around January 12. Would still month number get zero, silly reduction already showing signs slowing expect logarithmic (or logistic) curve. 

I'd expect decline deaths start day now. Hospitalizations peaked like Jan 6 shown drop (although dramatic case rate part due less testing). fact, I'll go ahead predict decline start today noisy decline on.  Education. Social services. roads. Literally anything else. Albanian saying, ""Evropa është kurve"".
Growing I've realized truer words spoken.  honesty AZ performed well  I'm like 50/50

if people understand still need wear masks &amp; social distance vaccine, we'll good

if people immediately start partying &amp; traveling get vaccine, we're screwed

I think info have, people know risks, they're apt stay inside &amp; risk we've got 1 year minimum go many folks been, BIG reason still dealing mess poorly. 

Just put freakin mask social distance. whiny entitled little child grown body keep crap another year. 

All goddamn mask Trump decided poorly reelection would harder took seriously....

If simply let medical folks thing supported publicly, would landslide. previous administration anything good dealing pandemic?

Seems like concerned using money making opportunity. Don’t apologize lmao hope it’s normal won’t be. still mask requirement public places that’s normal envision Come see we're Texas. Thanks putting teachers, families communities risk Texas Education Agency. Hi OP, future, please refrain linking live threads unless able permalink article section interested in! Well Ive looking 7 day average primarily dipped little significantly temporarily. started going couple days ago Im fairly certain might highest value far now. Read dam article... Wtf lol I’m sorry. depressing stuck around people literally don’t care. thought Tom Wolf going Hella rogue second lol *you*?

It's saying get vaccine precaution offers robust defense. that's ""doesn't contribute herd immunity"" discussion we're having. know reddit, try fucking keep up. think funny virus injecting bat RNA genome making us stay inside time. really logistical nightmare vaccinate everybody... work health department it’s disaster. one hand understand difficult, other... haven’t known vaccine would come months?? Shouldn’t steps planned already? I’m disappointed wasn’t preparation roll out. Brexit happened Brexiteers felt EU reformed. way EU knocked back Cameron's mild attempts sign complete waste time.

The EU 1990s gone, Lisbon treaty (which shifted power away states Commission, also introduced Qualified Majority Voting things, away veto except budgets).  read article? able read? I'm sure dictating child read you. Could link sources? I've looked CDC stuff, I'm inferring one really knows ton antibodies infection. Ontario largest Children’s Hospital (Sick Kids) make recommendations. pretty clear: hire teachers open new classrooms allow universally required 2 physical distancing; update ventilation meet international standards; masks everyone, shields teachers testing testing testing.
Unfortunately Conservative government, read it, claimed following them, went . . . PPE. Period. despite gifted billions federal government help. Billions yet spend. seem realize viruses literally alter DNA reproduce. likely cause long term damage developing antibody. Hey happens lots friends newly established medical supply companies whats guy do? investment fund behind actually registered vaccine EU, meaning could soon applied conditional market authorization. Given cooperation AstraZeneca Oxford University, would say legitimate effective virus.  think suddenly security enforcement executive order signed? I'm sure 3 methods transportation masks required. incumbent operator enforce this. Nobody going stop mandate gone. Knock out.  Sending kids school pandemic child abuse. I've never understood rush reopen schools needlessly put children danger. stupid. 

This entire thing really opened eyes shitty people are. many people doing... want ASAP I’m high risk group wait months. I’m hopeful summer vacations maybe firm order. paid delivering. Keep mind paid 9 months True, like media others he's place stuff. America gets much travel coming work. I'm even worried it. got this. Yes will, stop trolling end game WFH forever nice homes yards, cushy white collar jobs, never put pants again.

- source: talking standard tech/stem employee middle management south Texas district, class sizes aren’t capped like promised sept parents aren’t held virtual/f2f decisions make start 9 weeks. Constantly allowed bring kids back forth, zero concessions teachers. thanksgiving Xmas break 15 51 staff members due Covid/close contact students. I’ve virtual family “check in” via zoom week straight oct universal studios!! allowed return f2f next week. I’ve 3 kids test positive room told won’t sent home “monitor symptoms” jic. Yet monthly board meeting brought HR getting calls staff parents reporting see coworkers/district employees pics Facebook. make sure “are line Covid guidelines” work risk non renewal. top still asked teach TWO separate sets students, classes, curriculums, grading guidelines ZERO extra $$$ time given so. honestly can’t think invasive, uncaring occupation there...we treated like lab rats whole Covid education experience district leaders sit alone office day making decisions “piss parents least”.....15 years I’m counting days job market bounces back gtfo. biological material. finnicky like assembling car. pretty well known point Fauci gives conservative estimates, literally every public health expert expects summer close normal. Sorry Good!

My kids still learning home, hope vaccinated start next school year. trait people unlikely disappear anytime soon. Given people accustomed social media, probably even worse. attention span geared toward short content. Conservatives embrace authority people, themselves.

Unless mean things told threat punishment, yes, love authority. 100% additional kicker. 

If manufactured Germany, would issue meeting delivery targets? Need *for what*? People contribute herd immunity, whether like lol See, it’s soon discussion, we’ve already lived 11 months 3-4 months far future.

Nobody’s saying start eliminating mask mandates vaccinated people starting, say, next week. also can’t reasonably maintain current guidelines every last person vaccinated, particularly reach point vaccine hesitancy rather supply bottleneck. in-between period April/May look like? Last summer, May 2021 felt decade away. didn’t know vaccines would work. Cautiousness necessary.

Right ideal time start talking real carrots coming view next months. abstinence-only / change-nothing-after-vaccination approach realistic reasonable. 333% sounds like fear inflated number somehow goes past 109% Buy local distillery breweries. Problem solved. start seeing case reductions vaccinations? 25% fully vaccinated? 50%? caused severe pain entire industries whole cities regions risked economies kindly never complain anything anyone younger again.  Really? kept hearing today first Covid one: yes, I'm relieved too! aggravating listen year ago, it'll good finally hear medical professionals. uk government involved suggests. vetoed Oxfords first choice partner Merck supply line concerns Trump potentially preventing export. vaccine still effective degree new strains. could likely see annual booster shots well keep changes.

The criteria clearly said, spread low herd immunity kicked in. Let's wait come across new varient antibody effectiveness entirely new vaccine required go freaking out. point cause doom gloom. Science-based leadership get control. know hard imagine given last year complete wasted time managing manageable pandemic. underestimate human stupidity. 100% agreed. Meanwhile US expect authorize AstraZeneca [until vaccine far shows 62 percent efficacy used two full doses administered 28 days apart. dilution mistake one arm phase 3 trial, scientists found vaccine 90 percent effective small group received half-dose regulators need evidence: drugmaker said combined results showed 70 percent efficacy, Slaoui suggested U.S. regulators would satisfied far American people concerned, think it’s important say one vaccine 95 percent efficacy, another vaccine X percent, whatever number,” Slaoui told reporters, referring high efficacy rates Pfizer BioNTech Moderna vaccines FDA authorized. “We need clear concrete number number accumulated adding together different trials different schedules different materials.”

Remember FDA's minimum efficacy requirement 50 percent Covid vaccines. can't decide whether AZ vaccine described ""good"" ""excellent"" resolved dilemma making vaccine illegal. know anecdotal people know work pretty much getting vaccine weeks ago. people saying ""I'll take want with."".

Whatever takes, let's get vaccines put mess behind us. see bought EUs lies. Presumed Yea, 75% number insane. tested found 54% blood donors antibodies assumed somewhere May June, 20% people lost antibodies. I’m really wondering it’s something like dengue another tropical illness messing antibody assay compared 75% population COVID, resulted tens thousands deaths, thousand. protein spikes pretty much same

Except aren’t. mutation protein spikes Brazil variant whole concern. whole thread full people desperately downplaying something smarter people calling significant danger.

I would really advise people take Reddit comment boards information, pay attention researchers actually reporting. Actually, yet. even high risk population vaccinated yet. People seem forget US massive country 330 million.

And exports still leaving US, US among 1st make deals, initial orders filled first.  list Glad Australia made top 10 - Victoria did, eradicating (if may use term) high daily case count incredible feat. every single ER days away complete collapse.  I’m currently senior college. Personally feel much worse high school seniors missing us. year’s meant big event everyone waits for. younger brother missed feel shitty him. tho, here’s best sophomore year life next year! Well... are. doomscroll articles, monetize traffic, keep writing articles keep scrolling keep lights on. possibility support earlier implications..

Someone asked evidence provided possibility. Redditors think they’re edgy attacking journalism time. see anything made me... Stop giving clicks. You’re trying make seem like “media” thing, isn’t.

The longer virus circulates, mutations get. time, variants going get traction. Epidemiologists worried beginning. actually read reports, coming highly-qualified experts.

The irony many people Reddit love shit journalism, whereas it’s widespread disinformation online bullshit helped COVID 19 become global crisis. left, really good pandemic plan.

Now started making plan. Lol bet tell teachers they're lucky get summers off, opposed authentic instruction going via distance ""learning""... school district live (~16,000 students) Ohio decided semester quarantining students share classroom someone who's tested positive, since district considers masks 3 feet space desks sufficient. They've also decided stop notifying parents there's positive case child's classroom.

It's insane.   appears Bad. Interestingly enough I’m reading book called spillover history zoonic pathogen crossover beginning states pathogens we’ve able wipe (small pox basically polio) efforts ones likely arose us jumped another source. thought interesting. You’re right Yes, that’s someone else teach. plenty teachers don’t agree lockdown, person doesn’t speak all. flatten curve escape deaths suffering....Duh? qoute May.


""I think we're going get four, five years single aspect lives that's unchanged,"" said CNN's ongoing coronavirus townhall. ""It's almost impossible really fully envision look like.""

It's contagious.
Vaccines 100%.
Americans ever lock down.

We're going dealing forever Texas, although would prefer Florida. idiot lol? Careful. EU might try steal it. vaccine sounds good. info russian vaccine? government want give here...   completely agree, delay school openings September cases much everyone 16 wants shot daughters tutor taught high school different state high poverty urban school last year. said 120 kids 5-6 turned regularly online class March. Sometimes single kid show day. Nothing ever done school end. 

I honestly think going one things society look back realize colossal mistake made many ripple effects crime urban decline. Maybe it’s dramatic bet cities get lot 70s/80s feeling near future. Looking forward obligatory, “number people vaccinated eclipse number confirmed covid-19 cases US” headline! correct. False equivalency. spread cancer, HIV, cardiovascular diseases without exceptional effort.

*Preventing* spread COVID active effort. I'm talking analysing existing data. Click button unblind data, run script calculate stats print report. UK hiding ? may bluffing. may trying de-escalate. they've agreed release contract, would suggest contradict previously said. What's good vaccine effective? Pfizer stuff fixed dry ice, AZ still shit. necessarily. everyone gets side effects vaccines. Plenty vaccines I've gotten past got side effects. Everyones body different body react way someone else vaccine. want shots we've ordered, UK says

We want shots we've ordered, EU says Oregon mountain range middle, parts get snow others don't. famous part, Portland, get ton snow (when got couple inches lots things shut -- towns drivers experienced dealing it, safer shut even quantity snow looks like joke midwesterner northeasterner). Portland whole state obviously. 

This story Cave Junction, Oregon, pretty near top California. apparently get ~7 inches snow year, Portland, still pretty low. looks like might gotten hit unusual amount snow time. Yes police really need get involved fine jerks.

Christian virus, obviously. “First seen South Africa” vs “UK Strain,” least they’re consistent, haha  Denial river. report negative things, also report positive things try make things look scarier actually are. 

A good example report severe cases covid young people. extremely rare, media outlets actually report statistics fatality rate age. this, people extremely misinformed. study going around says many young people think 10% chance dying covid, thousands times high. Daily Johnson Johnson watch. Anyone hear anything new ETA? supposed foreign trial data released 1/21. I'm starting wonder good news. r/SelfAwarewolves... close friend, close. took long realise headline wasn’t fictional tragedy Doctor Who. big pharma. media. bother jokes you, might well cancel internet connection. one said solutions. would be?  Fair point! slightly annoyed major media organization multiple science editors staff make crystal clear. people work  Delivery already? even approved use yet corrected numbers need clearly stated state broadcasting world. 100% ICU beds use mean 100% ICU beds occupied lie, plain simple. People subreddit, due numbers manipulation like this, believe 100% going result apocalyptic crisis fact states ""Correcting"" numbers, case. 

I guess disagree Rebecca Jones considering second paragraph half point. like method FL picked called misleading. Firstly still clear EMA follow Germany. member states want pursue 65+ EMA could always approve age groups Germany thing. 

But mean EMA follows Germany they'd probably reserve pfizer/moderna elderly vaccinate healthcare workers using AZ. Although considering scarce supply right without AZ help much terms preventing elderly going hospital. healthcare workers assume they'll probably decide move onto general public even since able give elderly vaccine. data coming AZ soon could always reverse decision later on. That’s someone would want friend according experts Facebook feed. Sheesh. Fairfax teachers demanded go back CHILDREN vaccinated. might happen sometime late 2022. It’s absolutely absurd demand ashamed of. people get ill can’t get vaccine hurts everyone. Hopefully governments complex understanding little views get news stories Reddit. Yeah thinking high school, definitely think could learn material something like Khan Academy make lot difference. Demanding in-person high school ""think children!"" places there's bad outbreak still ridiculous imo.

In elementary might matter more, although think it'll still end fine given probably even full year affected end. People start elementary different ages different countries anyway, outcomes seem lot different. Even year's kindergarten end total waste time, pretty much going equivalent starting school age 6 instead 5, done elsewhere already. substantive, good job! Yep, agree fully. vaccinating teachers going much return home families go respective (and likely unvaccinated) offices. 

I'm thankful work home children right now, let's put way. we're talking UK Canada's hypothetical response EU blocking exports Pifzer vaccine. Hence AZ vaccine totally irrelevant.  obvious problem

""Canada 30th best healthcare system, even include cost""

\*redditors rejoice, praise it\*

""The US 38th best healthcare system, even include cost""

\*redditors boo, hiss, cannot believe it, angrily downvote\* can’t thankful county district route taken. Teacher vaccinations beginning. get jabbed, ready go get back work person. 

Zoom school kept stability structure kids needed get time. society chooses send kids back school unvaccinated, guess that’s them.

I’m looking forward best helping kids make educational losses may occurred... Ironic. irrelevant overstated doses 50 million? actual tangible goal look at?

With vaccine included mix here.

So end goalposts moving? 

Israel 50% vaccinated. 

February 5th. 

I'm holding breath time. Chuds chads thing  That’s actually correct interpretation confidence interval. 95% confidence interval says future, hypothetical repetitions study contain true value probability 0.95. 

It doesn’t mean true value interval level confidence. think like throwing horseshoe blindfolded stake. larger confidence interval, bigger horseshoe. throw without opening eyes say 95% horseshoes throw contain stake inside it. one throw I’m pretty sure one threw isn’t part 5%. open eyes, may actually way off. Yeah - root us!

Grüß mir Berlin! Yeah, tough say they've pretty opaque production. going hit targets they've already increase capacity yet percolated CDC's planning? banking capacity increase supposed come online soon? BS'ing people come heads? actually believe fully vaccinated means still spread covid? 

What know AstraZeneca (AZ) Moderna studies vaccine much effective preventing symptomatic covid preventing symptomatic. fact, AZ study **un**able prove prevented **a**symptomatic covid recommended dose. 

So, definitely lot vaccinated people walking around covid. pass people? likely make difficult -- probably *likely* parties wearing masks brief encounters -- spend time unprotected person close personal long period time, odd go way up. Walking Walmart watched guy cuss person counting people coming store simply offering wrapped disposable mask. guy disappeared store counter radioed manager. said likely deliver contractual obligated Q1

This ain't exactly I've read. 

Last time checked asserted delay experienced upgrading facilities caught end March, therefore meeting number doses ordered Q1.

I seen single representative Pfizer / BioNTech going far claim would deliver even doses previously planned March. doses expire, would preferred tossed trash? making mountain mole hill. would violate contract AZ Oxford.  GTA research university. agree statement. know fact ombudsmen busy complaints these. even professors call baby crying background. One suggested take grade come back ""when things better concentrate important academic priorities"". finished fall semester straight As. graduate May.  Yet qualify talking today, end January, say April. watched video, much love listen every word says, find messaging unhelpful. needs crystal clear. got stuck snowstorm LA county earlier week. take back, chuds Chads thing vaccines still work south african variant. need ageism. lost credibility initial AIDS outbreak, digress. understanding CEO J&amp;J predicted 100 mil June. They're going 10 million upon approval, end happening maybe late February.  Okay, I'll enjoy $65 month covers literally everything. Everything. wanted make appointment get prescription advil, could.

Sorry defensive weird reddit meme. AMERICA BAD! need stop treating every word like it’s mandated policy. 

There reason public health officials aren’t charge. good do, also myopic. last summer, Covid variant stories? 

Here's UK first good, EU first bad?  would care production issues promised delivery already. restrictions living under? Honestly make small talk types acquaintances like slightly better saying nothing, it’s like get anything substantial brief chit chats problem AstraZeneca make vaccine Eu UK, already country, Thats Eu want limit Pfizer coming made EU Whatever floats boat! hey making legal try get control large scale anticipated rule breaking

That's completely idiotic. can't enforced it, fact remains actively allowing sends wrong message, choosing say rules sends right message.  
 
It's realistic vast majority lockdown breakers caught punished there's still rules, many people take notice right thing do.  
 
The actual reason Boris bear see headlines ""Boris cancels Christmas!!111"". chose popularity thousands lives, sickening, sickening see people defending it. guess Trump’s vaccine export ban doesn’t help. People die lots diseases every day. broadcast 24/7 TV? Cancer, heart attacks, diabetes, HIV... relying U.S. trials statutory obligation. One regulations race. lot countries racial diversity U.S. real medical consideration. I’m looking good source guide decision trying make. due 2nd shot 2/11. grandfather (86) getting second shot 2/17. I’m wondering birthday “party” (would basically two us since ones vaccinated) on/around 2/27. 

Looking info safety vaccinated people hanging other. really need stop hanging Fauci’s every word. Decent guy, he’s Oracle, yet another bullshit thing he’s said doesn’t pass common sense test.  decreasing due immunizations, though.  6% population gotten first dose, number much lower.  need get 60% immunized immune due virus recovering.

We're side spike caused Christmas/New Years' travel anything.  Hopefully new variants cause another spike.

edit: reference Bit surprised this. results coming May probably already late. would way funnier chud Chad ratio Please forget ""vulnerables"" include elderly, also people age serious co-morbidities. Without doubling tripling Pfizer Moderna output, see massive group getting shot anywhere near March. quarantine really made y’all lose it

I wouldn’t go around accusing people moron’s post history like yours. quick google brought this:
 sure better links info. case. Read translated post :) Nah bro camera balls /s point, certain dilutions take prolonged contact (Upwards minute) SARS-family viruses going wet hands minute peroxide.

I would go back 60-70%+ (depending variety) Alcohol ASAP. ambulances generally EMT's? seems likely checked EMT ambulance first. County hospital Los Angeles actually opened household members medical &amp; staff, focus lower-income workers &amp; elderly family members. think extra doses would've available first come/first serve waitlist basis, decided pick &amp; choose family members associated hospital get shot. 

It makes sense since reports number social media savvy wealthy yoga moms making way far-flung sites around SoCal, scooping leftover shots families. They've got FB groups Twitter feeds ins &amp; outs waitlist process help direct probable vaccination sites leftover doses. Yup. able get soon due job. Originally hesitant I've convinced. 

But there's talk like this. changes nothing still wear mask avoid everything months (Come on, I'm buying spread vaccinated people would significant issue all), want bothered?

The vaccine always finish line. Stop acting like may be. sounds like bound determined hate everything, would probably greatly reduce time spend around someone emitting much toxic energy bigger issue 22 year old charge decisions.

Who made decision?  honestly highly doubt death numbers low reported love living Oklahoma.

If infected recovered still need vaccinated. bother? He's going give another number, another time line, guidance week anyway.

Cool. I'll stop talk anymore want deal facts instead hypotheticals whatever else rattling around head. 

✌️ Get ur phone n go live woods nerd No. think know yet J&amp;J 70% would surprise me. Still pretty good, certainly good enough use, maybe big enough difference target certain populations. news I've missed? 2 days facebook. Biontech/Pfizer developed EU produced EU US.

Janssen's vaccine division primarily EU vaccine produced EU US.

AstraZeneca developed UK produced UK, EU, India, etc.

Moderna US-based production Europe US.

Curevac developed EU produced EU.

I think even Novavax production Europe. 

Vaccine development, production supply chain international effort. country monopolize it. Florida far ""armpit"" US. We're like big swangin' D. prediction unrealistic imo.  hospital needs make sure future donations kept place come surprise. Going concern - it’s well known Covid attaches ACE2 proteins cause infertility. wiping generations potential children? won’t know decades line it’s something you’d even check kids obvious reasons. 

Are also impacting developmentally since virus also attacks brain? cases coming children hospitalized months later also concerning. got kidding me. Florida less infections California less deaths California &amp; New York stricter lockdowns.

If ignorant, probably able realize virus affected ineffective lockdowns. Infection rates related population density like infection deaths related age population.

Get reddit echo chamber actual research, use logic digesting research, come conclusion instead told think title article someone posted. Wtf Remember blow 514,000 candles. What's funny? wish lived good state lawyer way

expertise domain specific I'm going pedant technically mean *technically* eradicate smallpox. can't call disease eradicated genome sequenced, synthesized lab. Yes, pedantic. true. Point well made I’d still like see percentage risk rather subjectively assessed “extremely high.” 

And still find fishy map replaced case count front page days case count map stopped looking apocalyptic. Well, Americans disagree.  A.) natural anitbodies mount good protection vaccine does. still need vaccinated.

So? Need vaccinated *for what*? us go back normal? lol B.) Feel free argue Fauci.

Why bother? He's going give another number, another time line, guidance week anyway. testing Spanish Flu 1918, measuring excess deaths ballparking it. Excess deaths deaths caused lockdowns likely 1M said done. thinking? funny feeling actually hope that. think hospitals stop ""COVID wards,"" still dealing cultural PTSD aside things choice resemble form normal. Pandemics end. Always. Yes, 30M doses AZ promised UK end 2020 cut 4M? 

If two late orders, would generally try fulfill one waiting months longer. people think EU country issues performance dates. UK saw cuts 80%, EU cuts 60%. EU fulfilled first also ""agreed performance dates""? thinking shit went Astrazeneca-Oxford one December? surprise one... People never military, clearly. huge economy, obviously decent system, problem good compared wealth patient. science beginning pandemic. accepted virus truly airborne. didn’t want update include new information would mean “6 feet” bullshit. would shut airlines, schools, workplaces, etc.

I’m always astounded see science debunked early still touted fact.  Many teachers know say many students unaccounted year. Unfortunately mostly low income, ESL students. Working parents need students school. A.) natural anitbodies mount good protection vaccine does. still need vaccinated. 

B.) Feel free argue Fauci. I'm happy guys. earned it. glorious, grateful day safely re-engage communities again. A.) natural anitbodies mount good protection vaccine does. still need vaccinated. 

B.) Feel free argue Fauci. wants hike trail anyway? fucking dump Lol-I take double take (Pittsburgh here) I'm sure overlap got vaccine. saying time we're 70% vaccinated, one gonna social distancing anything. class outside I’m teaching face face students home learners simultaneously 5 days week? tied computer can’t even move around room sound like butthurt nationalist. Yes, healthcare system better many countries, prioritizes profits people. essential workers vaccinated (unless refuse so) time time get vaccine given age type work, moot point. LOL....I mean, Putin daughter took it. there’s that. That’s pretty close clinical trial. think locking needed right now, there's zero community transmission far. Maybe I'm misreading, right current number second vaccines received today appears match number first vaccines given 3.5 weeks ago. took lot less time vaccinate past 10-15 million compared first 10-15 million? Length life minimizing risk death balanced quality life. 

Some people argue statement, true, arguing balance. society considers first two last one all, would simply dystopia. anti-vaccine talking point many years. best tortured misunderstanding means use cell cultures vaccine development, worst total fabrication. somehow got head literally baby cells injected arm, just...I words. Omission form prevarication, too. I've saying since last April. easy nervous new vaccine far-off thing. lot different actually get start make things normal again. Honestly, would look see resources state has. Someone able help find catastrophic care. 

I’m sorry job doesn’t give healthcare. That’s bullshit. 

Personally think Medicaid greatly expanded, regulations passed prevent situations like yours. push whatever. need stop reach certain point. restrictions we're like 50% vaccinated would dumb, considering hospitalizations deaths would low. Palestinian authority, Pennsylvania Independent rag. Cool, get treatment average cases prevent hospitalizations? Olive Garden Red Lobster worked privately owned know offer franchise opportunities.  Summer give us time regroup get people vaccinated starts get cold again. wish closer! Palestinian authority, Pennsylvania Palestinian authority, Pennsylvania Uhhh, know people covid antibodies cells it?

There’s really required quality control education private schools that’s desire. don’t need licenses teach there, yes, grab whomever major experience field — sometimes even that. teachers licensed get hired potentially lower pay, lower benefits, less ability complain, lose pension — less likely bother anymore unlicensed teachers ones stay burned out.

Students, especially younger ones, set back *years*. learning. 7 year olds can't learn home, need teacher tell pay attention environment lets them, computer screen. crucial years educational development child, getting it. going lead great problems education coming years, worse longer at-home instruction continues.

Then there's soaring rates depression anxiety among students, online system.

I see little brother struggling learn math struggling study history. Thankfully school allowing go classroom half time, realize person important studying mental state learning.

Study study showing remote learning inadequate, hell I'm living anecdote university. *sucks*. hard learn hard retain. can't imagine middle-school-aged little brother even attempting it.

So I'm going ask again, really alternate means job?

Or willing take bit risk civil duty teaching children? think so. Grocery stores like want deal immunized customers complaining wear masks, moment one caves, will.

I'm betting places statewide mandate, see stores lifting requirement sometime March April vaccinations go stories declining COVID deaths/infections common. English first language? sentence make sense that's implying. Maybe meant say SARS-CoV-2 mortality rate adults children, would make sense said. 30% higher death rate? I’m sorry thats false. new variants aren’t lethal, changed wear masks, social distance, wash hands. don’t catch nothing changes. catch it, it’s disease, nothing changed. media run extrapolations people getting infected higher rate mean people die. course die infection rate rises. study Pfizer scientists University Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), yet peer-reviewed, showed less two-fold reduction antibody titer levels 

I recall reading Moderna one ""six-fold"" reduction. Moderna one similar Pfizers difference greater? understanding right?

Thanks. One biggest issues CDC's studies done, cherry pick perfect example ideally run school, claim schools safe open.

The problem school districts parents realize precautions needed open school safely, slap haphazard plan together, shit hits fan start coming arbitrary measures keep school running due lack substitutes healthy teachers. 

Just example, new policy school district test positive, **you come work unless want leave days docked.** I'll take 2... thousand. Give Moderna give death Yeah, curbside actually makes sense people need it. Delivery someone getting paid shop you, get you’re high risk would rather someone low-risk go you... regular healthy adults, doesn’t really seem like it’s necessary really helping anything. Mmm dunno partiers thing. Lots popular geothermal pools (there locals ones besides touristy Blue Lagoon). Plus bars. avoid bars would skip pools you’ve vaccinated. underrated comment could sworn recommendations changed ""15 minutes 24-hour period."" could wrong, point definition close contact.

Does district claim, well seated near one class 14 minutes there's proof sat near another class, lunch, bus, passed nearby halls bathroom anything? It’s complicated close borders international tourists. literally done day.  man knew masks made difference, wanted masks faces healthcare workers regular people fibbed March somehow that's misinformation? bf date little things related vaccine, showed something even vaccine still infect others, joe Rogan clip think, worth looking suppose. Also potential new variants able get around vaccine seems troublesome. Ill glad truly understand disease, missed pleasure, ill happy wear lipstick 😭 thread new variants. linked paper Antarctica. think people living countries it’s contained quite happy normal lives. know, dine-in movie theaters becoming pretty popular COVID hit. mean, ok. Sure, read story across 25 different sites doesn’t make less true. read results scientific studies skip news sites. do, still realize actually reason concern. would buy N95s shave beard worried. masks highly effective filtering particles warn properly.

Personally N95s fucking uncomfortable, worth wearing day way expensive accept risk.

I can't work N95 felt choking first month switched regular masks.  BS science. get anything this, one would assume every person vaccinated exposed. announcement comes couple days Israel also said cases going due number people antibodies. taking still likelihood people get transmit COVID even vaccine, jabs way end pandemic. high level risk immediate death due COVID. unknown risk long-term impacts due COVID. rocket scientist. Nobody knows impact brand new disease kids. absolutely right Fauci's mask debacle. still completely trust that... say thinks needs said accomplish greater good, may seem admirable face relies level manipulation countenance. Cool? would’ve prevented lot coming Europe, obviously. You’re suggesting borders remain open whole time? Step 1: become gymnast hysteria? town 75% people caught covid April new variant re-infect people known mutations make harder antibodies bind. fact it’s re-infecting people moving nearly 3x pace UK variant indeed worrisome. 

And yes, mention scientists currently studying haven’t concluded exactly what’s happening it’s major concern existing vaccines: posted peer reviewed published article science.org deemed speculative unsourced................?????? Either faked giving vaccine poor people, bad batch. horrible happen. went long avoided covid get got vac. Hospitals completely overwhelmed majors cities, like Tokyo. They're turning away people letting die home. Testing abysmal. Source: student works hospital Tokyo. sources: 8 students live Tokyo. went gym fee times “first wave”, numbers 500. miss community friends made years, love all. However seeing many people wearing mask properly taking wall reinforced fact responsible likely aren’t public places. it’s worth risk haven’t back 7 months. Plus summer doors open fresh air winter it’s closed up, big me. work physical working outside I’ll satisfied right now. gonna judge court? Yep No, possibly 10 received enough exposure someone contagious fall ill themselves. Even setting everyone supposed wearing masks maintaining social distancing, people properly consistently. proficiently summarized study well failed rebut rebuttal OP's claim ""school simply safe."" Sorry, isn’t supported facts. UK total lockdown right similar variants.  Yeah, sucks, it’s called reality. isn’t scare game. It’s reality. death rate new variant 30% higher based know right it’s 70% transmissible threat surging hospitals therefore causing people die.  Fauci already commented this. need prepared brutal months. Preprint articles require higher degree scrutiny rigor accurately evaluate many types articles. kind discussion would appropriate strictly scientific subreddit /r/COVID19.

Anyway, think Vietnam island. makes numbers impressive New Zealand's. remote island nation still advantage, requirement competent response. I'm terribly sorry. shame, really is. even UK gave produced vaccines EU on, would fraction EU ordered would still cause huge friction inequality across block. UK would screwed over.

I'm speaking states, I'm certain alter specifics fit AUS well. dumb think even over, I'm going keep carrying it. Same. candidates pipeline? wonder chose AZ one. original Bill Gates quite ethical move he:

1. persuaded IBM license (not purchase) PCDOS IBM PC standard OS), even exist
2. negotiated Seattle Computer Products (SCP) purchase rights 86-DOS (previously QDOS) SCP, $50K without mentioning anything deal IBM.

If Gates pulled off, possible would still small time entrepeneur.

BTW QDOS stood Quick Dirty OS.

IBM dumb persisted negotiations Digital Research, also entered negotiations SCP direct (or written OS PC - OSes small simple, heaps experienced CP/M programmers around).  AZ supply issues worse laid absolute turd clinical trial. US currently even including AZ vaccine national plan. majority Pfizer Moderna best vaccines approved.  People would never want hang with. can't interesting person that's view world.  everyone access go back normal, though...

I'm honestly even sure *why* think that.  people talked to, timing hits really seems vary. might fine. Might want take ibuprofen try prevent feeling aches, chills, etc case start evening.  It’s also end world wear mask vaccination. end. Welcome Texas almost like watched Thick It. logic, Pfizer given supply issues. difference is, AZ making profit. hey, they're British, they're easy target. Sorry, interested arguing politics. can't recognize order may benefit everyone small percentage people start masking this, may alleviate burden conductors/operators police this, interested objective honest discussion.

And I'm interested pointless conflict ideologies. almost like watched Thick It. Sorry, interested arguing politics. can't recognize order may benefit everyone small percentage people start masking this, may alleviate burden conductors/operators police this, interested objective honest discussion.

And I'm interested pointless conflict ideologies. Welcome Texas  almost like watched Thick It. logic, Pfizer given supply issues. difference is, AZ making profit. hey, they're British, they're easy target. almost like watched Thick It. plan absolutely.... first weeks immunity kicks Take boat. believe mostly regulatory marketing implications influence supply. 

So I, nothing noticeable would change. want wear mask rest life. vaccines end mask mandates, will? said using continental facility initially booked capacity “which wanted use rather waste”, problems British sites. think Poles, Czechs Greeks would thought EU, richest powerful countries got entire vaccine supply themselves, leaving waiting?

The proposed purchase group four would bought enough everyone. see claim they'd preferential distribution amongst themselves? EU nationalising Pfizer site would bring severe retribution US. think socialism bad name now? Shit would hit fan. [I found seems take tylenol ibuprofen vaccination. There's data vaccines yet, vaccines, sometimes causes less antibody production, still offers protective levels antibodies. worry it, second dose. tbh idea this, think major concern, would bigger public warning. hear lot arm pain, bet lot people pre-medicate tylenol ibuprofen without knowing guy honestly understand talking about, go easy him. right though. EU nationalising Pfizer site would bring retribution US. think socialism bad name now? Shit would hit fan. would impact supply. manufacturing fast People think things media (mainstream social) talk it. media inundated people car accident statistics pictures wrecks, day, every day, would absolutely become scared think twice driving.  assume you’re American, try stupid things first, we’ll try come plan. Rest world making us look bad....  miss recommendation somewhere article post person linked stay quarantine even vaccinated? case, think states lower education requirements teacher (associate's degree considered fine) youth end learning chemistry 21-year-old two chem classes single one-semester course classroom management.

Either going hospital administrators nurses shit hit fan: double number people responsible one else available fuck safety efficacy, right? Elementary school classes end looking like freshman community college biology lecture hall, 200 ten-year-olds falling asleep guy front droning projected powerpoint presentation.  saying get it, he's saying already covid results immunity, subsequently rest population.

You're talking things. Bloomberg updated again. 25,646,032 doses administered.

That means 1.2 million vaccinated today.

And averaging 1.2 million per day past week(we dropped due 20th data dump days prior). said pity him? Fuck guy. thought clear that. I'm glad got caught I'm glad losing 10s million dollars consequence. could also add meaningful fine too, pretend $900 fine consequence also rather disingenuous. I’m quite shocked Japan forefront vaccine approval, production distribution. Even considering hosting olympics summer news 10, whoever BBCs Europe correspondent said Agreed. got mine yesterday started chills last night, plus trouble sleeping despite tired. Basically feel like flu today, plus arm super sore. Ibuprofen helping. I'm hearing similar things others.

I work tomorrow evening, hopefully I'll feel better then. Great way get volunteer experience resume... swabbing anuses Covid. Sometimes wonder letting people breed all. believe crosses mind should. Sometimes wonder letting people breed all. believe crosses mind should. know much private educations cost right?

EU right vaccines UK ordered suggesting? 

IF AZ breach contract EU choose either carry breach uk contract choose breach contracts UK supply fraction EU ordered. 

And public fight vaccine world’s wealthiest nations ugly, especially vaccine that’s provided profit specifically designed developing world mind. 

The EU quietly negotiating AZ see there’s anything do/ negotiate/ spend speed process, tantrum making threats. mean tell years pressuring people go school they're sick means go school they're sick, shocked, shocked tell you. Guys, it’s end world wear mask getting vaccine. nothing new what’s said months now. let's say vaccines would receive approval right now. Would change anything all? example mean increase supply? getting weird, like I'm getting thing now.  Maybe makes selfish, feels kinda good US right 10 months hearing awful America stupid locking everything. Literally Wow, sounds like great way get volunteer experience resume... swabbing anuses Covid. Philadelphia 2 month lockdown ended week ago true. could gone totally differently Japan acted quickly took situation seriously. island nation could like Taiwan, Australia NZ, case would least somewhat safe hold Olympics. Almost seems like Japan felt entitled hold Olympics even without properly controlling covid situation, think people want go enough testing even done know extent virus's spread? you’re forgetting quite number Australians kept families due international border shut down. apply ‘permission’ travel, Australians can’t afford steep airfare currently costing upwards $10,000. practice alone seeing tenfold increase amount patients presenting severe anxiety depression part due kept family. Australian government forgotten world lot connected maybe 10 15 years ago. people long distance relationships families living across multiple countries, impact shutting international border real plan reopen anytime soon really affected many pockets Australians. country sees decrease known covid cases, come heavy price can’t shouldn’t ignored. lot Australians life isn’t “pretty good”, it’s absolute hell country needs prepared spike mental health cases. keep mentioning country/region that's smaller one major cities US? Gibraltar zero covid deaths. So? can’t even get kids date usable textbooks. think might asking much. top bullshit measures look good paper completely ineffective, states penalizing school districts choose continue encourage distance learning. Texas, instance, requires uneven equivalency distance versus in-person education hours. remember exact numbers, think meant every hour student spends in-person learning, student remote learning spend hour half. absolutely absurd expected state leadership declared broadcast TV elderly expendable. Don’t buy Amazon. Sorry say then... parents demand 
teachers risk lives get low cost underfunded public daycare paid for. ignoring COVAX see sure grasping manufacturing may taking place specific geographic region, without orders organisation cannot forecast.

Forecasting what? big delivery bottleneck really is? time last year spent companies delivering vaccine production processes. long period, literally difference whether vendor wants produce 10k, 1M 1B doses. late start ramping production large quantity. Pfizer began real mass production mid october yields still low compared deliver Q2.

Plus, vaccine production like car production need invest billions huge manufacturing plants.

In fact, vaccine production really cheap fairly easy. couple thousand liters drug substance contains billions doses. hard pard making drug substance scales fairly well afford produce far market needs nearly money.

The costly part production fill-finish. something widely available CDMOs relatively generic service short times. fill-finish huge bottleneck vaccine production. Therefore many vendors without approved vaccines blocking many CDMOs fill-finish lines drastically reduce ability delivery vaccines. Moderna's could deliver far would able get fill-finish capacities. Therefore clever book quite late start produce drug substance early.

I've worked pharma company 20 years ago, think much changed EU fucked passing blame onto manufacturers trying steal vaccine doses UK produced UK manufacturers.

It's stealing asking get paid for. sounds like like doing! I'd go shopping store :D high school literally allowing wrestling starting Feb 1. Wrestling. Makes sense. They're effective vaccines. 

Shocks people want them! misleading article. Australian state governments always listened advice. 

It's us uk governments think exceptional selling sanitizer called Next CVS towards beginning pandemic. used shit once. Smelled like gas, followed stench dry vomit, lingered almost 30 minutes. shocked list. also wear mine longer bc im vaccinated fine, let someone enjoy least! im last get vaccinated ill wear dont punish everyone else til get mine, thats people sound like No. said interview wanted masks healthcare workers. want masks heslthcare workers ""don't work""? purposefully misleading us thinking would keep us hoarding masks (which plan failed miserably). said later press conference internet already turned throw away comment potential therapy latest culture war argument.

My point Trump go later. Trump goes anything base behind. everyone ratcheted single mention drug might work left vs right war stupidity without real evidence.

The FDA help things, either. actually approved drug emergency use Trump's ""Try it!"" quote.

It giant mess. Yeah, that's highly optimistic appraisal. Walmart close by. 😐 so, vaccinated people spread unvaccinated, mean chances happening high.

So- stop normalizing masks social distancing vaccinations. absolutely silly. “according laboratory study *conducted U.S. drugmaker*”

“*which yet peer-reviewed*”

“The study conducted blood taken people given vaccine. findings limited, *because look full set mutations found new South African variant.*” basically done beginning summer let alone end. CNN exaggerates importance things. they’re outright liars. think root problem worse.. diseases school keep happening long continue us childcare instead education. bad (kids sent daycare school feverish medicated, etc) pandemic exacerbated problem hundred fold...

Our public schools (especially) indirectly subsidizing labor market. Parents send sick kids school means take work. Schools pressured reopen communities want kids back schools go work.

Those insane numbers women leaving workforce pandemic good example phenomenon immense consequences families future. mean literally everywhere anyways. 3% hydrogen peroxide will. I'd read lab data 1% hydrogen peroxide kills coronavirus minute, diluted stuff store problems now. instructional planning hours. turns like people teachers really bad estimating much time spend stuff. nice see willing stick blatantly false premise though.

This CTU refusing go back classrooms, lets focus CTU. underpaid stretch imagination. teaching positions require masters degree either quality masters degrees teachers hold tends lower comparable professions. source provided also completely ignores teachers pay scales increase faster professions teachers significantly non-salary compensation professions. 

Comparing many children someone looking pretty piss poor way evaluate compensation actually believe reasonable way evaluate feel sorry you. must hard. 

I would advocate teachers get vaccinated first included anywhere list demands would actually return classrooms case. But, CTU made abundantly clear getting teachers vaccinated would enough them. Also sending teachers deaths. Even sent back schools pre covid risk death individual teacher fraction percent. average age teacher US around 41 years old falls covid basically risk death group. Even force older teachers retirement, see necessarily bad thing. whatever want. going make damn difference far vaccines go UK variant really issue vaccines, South African abd Brazilian ones are. study uses actual SARS-CoV-2 virus, pseudovirus, like studies. could explain difference results. Although course, viruses used study still lack couple mutations, need see data full mutation strains. Walmart near you, use app add grocery items cart schedule pickup. check one pickup spots enter car color pickup spot number app put groceries trunk. depends location try schedule slot 2-3 days advance. It’s free. also Walmart+ $98 year unlimited grocery delivery. He's one. people could gotten sick died reactions. know full scope care rare, still something researched ok concerned wonder may caused reaction. Especially since person went ER save life. one cares teachers lol. district said keep kids 6 feet apart classroom. told could 4ft max. said oh fine print says ""6ft applicable."" Long story short kids sit 4ft apart regularly take masks matter much tell need keep times.

The funny part high school kids easily learn home without problem. fine last semester. gone October pretty much developed countries. Probably early mid next year developing. expect basically done US May June many EU HQ’ed corps R&amp;D subsidiaries US? Say Bay Area particular. 😏

Pfizer may producing vaccines EU UK... still US headquartered MNC. dot one death. Hurts try comprehend pain chart Nope, strains.  ones near 3 lanes going still backed up, insane. One places indoor dining even though allowed months. Hopefully last month headline. That's good likely late move needle make real difference. Working one SARS-CoV-2 variants seriously dangerous biosafety security requirements. using engineered something test pieces.  Like Wuhan Northern Italy? No, state USA that. Even San Francisco's stringent lockdown level. Absolutely! 😊

Oh keep sanitizer car wipe handles, steering wheel, etc.  Yep exactly. exactly we've gone to. trust sanitizer anymore. Surprisingly 70% rubbing alcohol dried hands thought.  Also, waited till week due time announced 60% short goal. Parent here...

I actually happy schools opening. would rather keep kids home...

&amp;#x200B;

I always considered schools breeding ground - even covid. started get sick often kids spread 3 different institutions. ""normal"" infections stuff spreads like wildfire build production means order would produced weeks scheduled order rather months before. too. even may road trip back safe (and car)! [archive link anyone trouble accessing article  pod system hybrid model everything online single group kids room day long alternating days year. switched changing classes yesterday, I'm already remind kids put mask up. rural school, lot family members telling hoax, overdiagnosed death certificates. Frustrating. Yes - careful take mask goggles properly wash hands so. UK variant appear immune escape mutations, research shown problem there. increasing evidence all. lack evidence showing transmission possible. two different things. past three weeks coronavirus pandemic’s deadliest United States. Since Jan. 7, daily reported coronavirus deaths repeatedly exceeded 4,000 — number never reached single day 2020. milestone 425,000 deaths, passed Tuesday, came week U.S. crossed took 44 days first U.S. death recorded reach 25,000 deaths. last five 25,000-death milestones recorded week half each. visualization, pixel represents one death tick mark represents one day. date indicates 25,000-death milestone passed. nearly half Americans?

That insane, least rising though even slowly.

The EU insinuates company exported vaccines produced Belgium EU pre-paid ready vaccine approved.

Damn right I’m going hug elderly parents us safely post-vaccine. 

Why even question. 

I’ve strictly compliant guidelines whole thing, miss public health theatrics. I'd like tweak AZ clinical trials many unanswered questions  Well it’s expected Johnson Johnson 100 million vaccines distributed April. vaccine one dose means 100 hundred million. You’re right. I’ll wear one everyone able get vaccine want vaccine doses. that, masks :) mean that's fair, one downvoters can't speak them, trying respond general over-fearful mindset rather person specifically. good end too, trying clear point. get 3 feet apart January thorough March busiest season work. constant work eat sleep repeat 12 weeks straight us. 

I reading watching news, really time brainpower left shifts. cycle usual. 

I'm 100% serious, even know COVID 14th March... Never heard talked tasked setting everyone Work Home. “Stay away negative people. problem every solution.” probably read article. think one side open ventilation. It’s cold AF manage Italy, Netherlands close signing agreement AZ back July, EU stepped said we'll handle this.

According [this accompanying press released even signed contracts. question becomes: EU tore contract up, renegotiate terms. Going language used subsequent press releases Dutch ministry, I'd guess renegotiated. means reason prepare EU vaccines. EU activity takes place English commonly used second language across member states takes time tweak biotechnology process full yield. vaccine produces managed get full yields right beginning? message need. 65 already paid stay home social security. rest us need vaccinated go work pay social security. want vaccinated first, need flip employment around working pay us stay home. long continue vaccinations.

Also, UK country fucking alcoholics old white guys educated Eton wouldn’t dare disturb drinking habits “constituents” sensible things.

“Never!”
“Oh shit...Hey, guize, think ‘cold’ BoJo got might actually real.”

(Don't forget taken away time get comfortable!!) Current government mess self centered nationalists. No. Vaccines work variants new one could developed 6 weeks virus mutates significantly. coronaviruses mutate slower influenza viruses SARS-coV-2 virus would need undergo much larger mutations order present problems immunity. Even mutation would likely cause virus become less deadly transmissible, best evolution virus have. variant virus could antibodies longer bind strongly virus’ antigens before. would affect body’s immune response significantly antibodies would bind spike protein antigens well. majority virus would undergo mutations could render virus ineffective. It’s long step become completely new strain (like SARS-coV-3). understanding it, I’m expert, I’ve heard. anyone degree virology immunology wants correct me, go it. Fauci Predicts U.S. Could See Signs Herd Immunity Late March Early April Why? Why? Fine, part. try exercise hour day I'm pregnant keep homey hobbies. biggest stressors reading UK Germany news whatever seems affect policy degree, matter much cases, hospitalizations, deaths go down. Also parents definitely seeing baby turn like... one, given current trajectory border closings. that, trying best. sure they're counting India rich big proportion vaccines order (1bil).
India rich macro sense per capita sense - makes sense. so? can't wealthy donors private hospitals. can't converge doctors medical licenses Public Health Service.  Art thou feeling now? Chemical processes much likely culprit biological ones. said care open anyway.

Do reading comprehension problems? literally said ""so everyone else, open country"". Never say care. Quit bullsh* EU still approve AZ vaccine. stories sound quite odd. Pfizer vaccine correct?

UK real-world results AstraZeneca 'soon'-ish. think generally would. client valuable really driver here. AstraZeneca producing vaccine cost price, make money element. cost negotiated element supply chain, rumoured EU decided negotiate hard, would word ""cheap out"". 

Regarding liability, touching UK produced doses reaches 100M clear breach contract, compared EU's ""Best Effort"", know clearly defined.

Regarding client would prepared lose? UK provided Oxford Uni AZ develop vaccine. provided one best per capita investments world AZ, helped fund creation UK supply chain initial parts EU ones (which setup UK contract prior EUs contract)

I think reasons mentioned would give AZ reason impact late UK deliveries reduce impact EU's late deliveries. 

The EU Karen, complaining cheap, non-Profit vaccine producer treated better anyone else despite offering little. Imagine demanding take doses away worst hit country Europe sooner. That, article mention whether 163,00
 vaccinated people exposed Covid. Still encouraging results!! 1. schools policy 10-14 day quarantine student let back in. let back doctor's note. test required.
2. Asymptomatic spread problem; know teenagers factually spread virus well adults. compounded lack testing desire prevent testing happening
3. Parents sports athletes high performing students pressuring students test, either participate sports take SAT/PSAT/etc.
4. Even assuming study true; schools taking massive precautions every school district can. top head, strict enforcement masks, temperature checks, social distancing (like actual social distancing), actual pods, sports going schools, etc.

The problem many say ""see, CDC says school safe"" twist force schools open full capacity. Also, study says ""in fall"" really code ""we looked September"". long-term health effects patients die? want restrictions lift ASAP also want permanent damage organs lol Maybe effectiveness directly proportional antibody titer range they're looking at. reason assume would be?  me, thanked things keep employees customers safe. also upgraded HVAC new tech outputs dry hydrogen peroxide attempt kills viruses air surfaces. definitely didn’t find two masks big deal.

Going fun see scsmmmers crying get caught year pay back seems flu normal times much lower R0 we’ve truly driven 1. actually better looks, 92% effectiveness infection disease. Although possible asymptomatic people seek less testing. expect happen? think things go back normal? Masks made beards, clean shave stubble would better.  Yeah we're giving benefit doubt hospital things could def played extra doses started calling people knew wanted able come short notice. Unless NJ1015 evidence that's inaccurate, think stories like helpful. don’t work ICUs? Handout vitamin pills free then. people take much sympathy rural white folks wear masks. idea much needed hear today.

Thank You. according article.... bind cells effectively 1-8PM EST CDC, usually 5-7PM EST Bloomberg. Rich countries funded research, paid doses, house institutions created them

The fact that’s it’s half 100% surprising part First dose vaccine would give great protection serious mild illness however may require second dose sterilising immunity. Definitely get second dose really worried COVID make sure wait roughly 2 weeks-3 weeks return gym immune response. Yep. hate agree this, spade spade. according article keep restrictions protect people refuse get vaccinated. Sure lol. right now. Sell markets. Honestly great. virus keeping night I'm scared catching dying though.

The virus keeps night can't endless work/home cycle longer. Im anxious edge time now. hate  think Democratic Party perfect it’s hilarious.

Oh, wait, serious. Let laugh even harder. India's vaccine diplomacy smart contrasts Chinese rival.

But US consider neighbors too. Canada small country (in terms jabs needed) government bungled vaccine program. would really nice bailed neighbor trickle supply. promise tell prime minister near big decision ever again.

Herdimmunity.

If 70% population vaccinated matter vaccine rate 5% failure rate virus able spread. Economic impact vaccinating citizens larger potential trade actions. Trade actions would also hurt country putting trade war reciprocal actions. would noise actions that’s it. 

They’re making noise UK, Canada really. Wonder why?

Sticking UK isn’t going play badly EU either. reality they’re minnow uk always reliant eu vice versa. UK found negotiating exit.

I’m saying EU every time someone includes UK UK market somehow important EU justify whatever, it’s time reality check. ""emptied shelves"" mean ""invented""?   what’s idea long term game plan? Social distance masks when, forever? understand unreasonable people? Tylenol NSAID! basic medical knowledge. think situation simple making be, I'm waiting contract made public deciding right wrong.

EU officials seem pretty convinced contract contemplate UK sites secondary role supplying EU. AZ can't make contract UK stating production would stay UK, another one EU plants primary role. two contracts would incompatible. sense, EU demanding make ""best effort"" supply doses promised, using manufacturing sites laid contract, seen fair. 

Then also issue EU notified delays. AZ find 60% cut production last week? find highly unlikely, knows. 

This, course, contingent contract actually says. could also case EU messed contract facing consequences. We'll wait see. Yes. France Netherlands voted it, re-named forced without referendums. What. work healthcare. I’m essential.... privileged. trials found around 80% (at least two weeks first dose) based small sample size. could lower real world. personally would wait everyone fully vaccinated resuming close contact.

I live parents high risk, would prefer maximum protection. circumstances may different. 

If 60-80% reduction risk works you, would say go it. wait second dose could go 90-95%. Ahh gotcha. Thanks that. 

Stay safe friend 🤙🤙 Yeah explain civil. Good work. surprise. European Commission lumbering bloated bureaucracy last organisation I'd trust handle crisis. Privileged asshole. Problem? Better blame Russians Sick looking mask tho  select family around masks indoors. work health care get tested never concern. Maybe adding safe folks ok too. think I’ll little comfortable public really. Dealing nose maskers (lol) less panic attack style stress. vaccine 5% chance working you.  concrete evidence still spread virus super easily, seems incredibly unlikely

There 5% chance vaccine simply work you. companies ensure deliveries inside EU planned. long case, export much want. fall behind, companies cut deliveries countries proportionally. zoom university work. professor right tell dress decorate home.  Everyone's immune system different based many factors, hard time claim. seem provable me. People NYC hate havn't seen full terms contract. AZ said something expected initial production low. Implicit is, later production higher. EU basing figures even level delivery. deranged new production line.

Full terms contract may clarify. Google ""Bloomberg vaccine"" Seems like people reacting emotionally rather wanting sort mess. Hopefully people charge act mature way. Shocked! SHOCKED SAY!! 

I’m glad US jumped kn orders vaccines soon could, Well, \*is\* fact arrogant prick Biontech/Pfizer vaccine send UK produced EU. need imagine scenario. EU already sending vaccines continent elsewhere.

Apparently Belgium ability block vaccine exports Pfizer plant strategic reasons. I'm Belgian power politicians have.

We're one month vaccination campaign already turned trade war. Really? common people (both European British) really want? lot companies involved manufacturing owned AZ.

Proportion 80+ year olds amongst die COVID-19 trending downwards last four weeks. supply chain partner manufacturing vaccine produce (in bioreactors) facility Belgium achieving yields 1/3 be, taking time rectify. given takes weeks grow batch days bottle likely found production would much less late current cycle.

That’s fine dandy pharmaceuticals “say” get new vaccine 6 weeks already struggling maintain distribution vast amount countries ordered original! look Brazil South Africa, near infrastructure account cases deaths accurately US. Hell current deaths Brazil 220k estimated 25% excess 275k. South Africa 42k 110k excess deaths. That’s confirmed cases require testing (they have!). even excess deaths could wrong. It’s dire situation world right now. Bradshaw, researcher SAMRC, said although South Africa generally good reputation registering deaths, took place outside hospitals often went undiagnosed thus escaped official think confirmed covid deaths really reported hospitals, whereas many leave hospitals death never make hospitals first place,” potentially cause tens thousands deaths, South African variant sequenced researchers fewer 700 times.

oh almost forgot, sry english, ect. misleading title though? study prove vaccine less effective

""The study Pfizer scientists University Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), *has yet peer-reviewed*, showed less two-fold reduction antibody titer levels,""

**(2-fold would 50%, correct? they're saying 100% useless)**

they saying vaccine less effective 50%. even 20% would lot. thats 1 5 people still getting infected.

""Its findings limited look full set mutations found new South African variant.""

""One possible reason difference could Pfizer findings based engineered coronavirus""

I think article still implies need remain vigilant &amp; safe

I never saw articles saying vaccine work, offer less protection. line everything said. saying 20-50% reduction. saying thing basically. Nobody cares.

Have told  getting topic? what's efficacy 75+ Pfizer trial?

In case forget maths below,

Yes, even already horribly racist, elitist approach. Ugh disgusting. haven’t learned anything pandemic except humans terribly selfish. Well that’s bit irrelevant situation customers due receive first deliveries time signing contract (Q4 2020 UK, Q1 2021 EU). UK got less 20% it’s expected end Q4 reality EU due get much closer expected UK did. all. AIDS caused HIV, problems therein result virus causing destruction cells. talking virus triggering autoimmune response -- basically, body freaks creates antibodies recognize self tissues rather virus.

While unfortunate uncommon outcome COVID-19, important note viral infections #1 cause autoimmune diseases, barring none. unusual; would far unusual *wasn't* case there's widespread viral infection.

No reliable data available. Shoving throat poor countries cut it. Yup. Live there. live reserves get Yes, least experience. recieving everyone also wait 15 minutes leaving ensure negative reaction. Wash using what? Fair enough. I'd mad letting get point first place.  soon let go expectations

UK think Fauci defeatingly pessimistic here. indications point vaccines severe decline spread virus. Whoa. Mind = blown… don’t get sick? Midnight curfew here. remember time evening walk 12:04 turning corner crib, police van. hid shadows arrest spreading covid crickets chirping yards. keen make friends need find ways legitimize power! also wrote book didn’t fuck handled pandemic much better others. recommendation still risk serious reaction roughly 1:1 million. 2 weeks turned year counting.  Gonna need proof even happened. Right baseless accusations. Ok man great messaging bet people definitely take agree lol wtf man UK left EU almost year ago, end January 2020. last year transitional period governed Withdrawal Agreement. far know, UK chose participate EU's vaccine programs, deciding instead make investments arrangements. explained make money, they're gaining this. come ahead company vaccine producing one. Perhaps UK ahead per capita terms vaccinations administered USA quite decent amount? 11.25% compared 7.11%.

The USA slower roll strategy cost associated it, probably thousand americans needlessly die due said slower roll out. Maybe diet?

Lots ginger garlic anti-inflammatory shit. also still warm humidity country.

But alas, guesses. getting beyond stupid. Cooperation key cooperate, investigate monitor, there's breach contract block. Well, seems EU right all. reply guy saying incompetent embarrassing. live grocery store worker. higher death hospitalization rates healthcare workers significant margin. fact, healthcare workers large objectively get less overall ppe work distancing outweighs slightly higher exposure

Also zero right get living doctor, soooo entitled coming guy wrote book successfully handled pandemic. thought trump arrogant ? Get load Cuomo.  Wonder Ahhh, get Alright let put straight. fear tactics fine carry without peer review, get work reliable source assume false? EU bad late order cheap.

US UK good early order big money...

&amp;#x200B;

I bought two movie tickets 8 p.m. three days ago someone else bought four movie tickets three days ago. 3 places left! 

***Grrr***, places mine bought two days earlier, rights places!!

People keep forgetting countries standing line vaccines, contracts, like tickets. good contract make might depend make order, contract made, equal. 

Now problem really share vaccines UK EU, problem constantly pointing finger towards EU giving fault, ""they ordered later"". reality AstraZeneca f'ed big time due incompetence (which display trials too), cut deliveries massive 60%, they're trying spin EU guilty. Add anti EU rhetoric UK US pro EU Europe that, perfect toxic cocktail hate... Thanks AstraZeneca.

SARS-CoV-2 mutants vs. VSV-based pseudovirus used Columbia study. 

I yet see Columbia study. know Rockefeller Institute study NIH/Moderna study. But, Columbia study. Perhaps news articles confusing Rockefeller University Columbia University? 

As whether one better other, VSV pseudoviruses used throughout pandemic gauge antibody responses. There's reason believe there's significant differences conformation spike protein VSV vs engineered SARS-CoV-2. UT group include mutation falls directly RBD site (K417N) spike protein direct impact conformation RBM (direct ACE2 binding site RBD). mutation included Moderna study, 2.7 fold change difference neutralization. mutations included, 6.4 fold change difference. include mutations least mutations fall within RBD, really giving us complete picture whether vaccine effective. paper shows importance K417N amino acid neutralization. 
 EU blocked restricted single drop, then? troglodytes carry on, worry, despite lies, misinformation fearmongering. 

The EU flexing AZ making show produce export like: "" EU done u-turn decided block exports"". Straight LIE. India become TSMC pharma lol. Get here, moving goalposts. Omg want shit hard saying that. Rockies! imagine?!? behold, countries spent countless millions paying vaccines, EU done u-turn decided block exports.

No , manufacture failed live contract simultaneously taking EU ride exporting another country. short-sighted go away? long last? studies show average person thinks 1 6 chance dying catch virus. healthy people 50 odds actually like 1/10,000th that. *will* take back. Authority *never* wins. statistically relevant.

In case, I’d prefer 0-5 ratio age group would give 100% efficacy. Also third largest population world runs largest number tests daily. need use per capita numbers make fair comparison. see US bad, worst done better several European countries. 31/163,000 vs. 6,437/2,700,000, I'm wrong. Reminds Belgian railroad deciding run fewer trains combat covid. Excuse but, who's even talking taking guns away? They've going weeks so... therapeutic then, right?

Perhaps stop saying vaccine prevent transmission Fauci tombstone everyone trying travel.  herd immunity even false goal. illnesses deaths focused elderly health conditions, drop significantly way reach herd immunity. guess couple months. Fauci seems want extend timeframe long possible, summer, fall, even winter. based anything he's trying scare people wearing masks. Yeah maybe invent time machine go back time give information upcoming trial readout everyone 8 months back. negate risk leaders (and I'm taking mostly UK here) take incomplete information. mean shit fast moving thing people make decisions based risk millions citizens. Maybe good information make decision.

Finally, personal vendetta vaccine. I'm sick tired people defending national pride. end day, truth everything conducted poorly deployed widely situations there's choice pretty much desparation. US AZ/Oxford vaccine even factored talking national vaccination plans another choice--one effective cloud surrounding data. Oh, outdoors much safer. understand situation. Sounds like you’re things safely can. Good luck! got second Pfizer shot Sunday took Monday-Tuesday work.

The following day getting it, bit tired lethargic. *could* worked pretty glad able sleep late spend day watching movies couch. Still managed summon enough druthers laundry cook dinner.

Tuesday woke feeling 100% back normal. Based similar side effects phase 3 studies treatment placebo arms, definitely mechanical stay Holiday Inn Express? Prime Minister warned Scottish Government publish Covid vaccine supply figures Nicola Sturgeon revealed would make numbers public, despite demand UK government keep secret. finding *people* live high altitude locations. Whether ICUs high-altitude irrelevant. dont see schools going back August, that's me. relatives Kentucky would never, ever give guns. hate say this, could see news police ever tried raid home take away automatic rifles. think perhaps countries (such maybe even UK) might also provided massive funding help create vaccine put massive orders (several months EU did)?

Do contracts matter benefit EU? ""Mr. Weber said doctor ambulance crew hand help oversee operation.""

Pain injection site rare minor placebo. Also, Florian Krammer said felt pain placebo, pain two real doses. Looks like really vaccine. 

So boils primary immune reaction viscosity suggest, placebo saline water - that's thick sure. hope right. would mean USA get 220M - 47M 172M doses till end March. would good. last night's CNN town hall ..im wondering that's ever going happen. depressed funny. So, get vaccines still can't go anywhere, anything wear two masks.. I'm anti vaxxer, signed astrazenica study I'm wondering not... Moderna Pfizer said likely vaccines going slightly less effective, still provide strong protection.  So, maybe eating bats best idea ever? idk, hard tell. government never gives back rights taking away name safety. 


sorry learn way. saying washing hands effective Covid, less effective? article;

""Essentially, Oxford started vaccinating older people later, huge number older people vaccinated. that's debate is,"" said. ""But strong data showing strong antibody production virus elderly, similar see younger people. possible countries, caution, use vaccine younger group.""

They basically currently lack phase 3 data older people. reason AZ anything fishy. saying smells fishy without evidence ""low blow"" 

EU order late. People already travel. I've trying contact local pharmacies checking daily see appointments become available. problem live rural area limited options live several states away I'd worried exposing drove try take appointment elsewhere. I'm glad hear family luck going route. I'll continue searching online see find something sooner. Kids deserve punished hypochondriacs. suppose depends definition ""back normal."" think people, means capacity restrictions masks anywhere. unlikely people vaccinated, summer.

Regardless, mid-summer basically late July/early August, people consider Labor Day fall (even though later September). think we're splitting hairs month so. think lack vaccine production frustrating general. matter would fuck pfizer supply chain EU plants even policy ""AZ indirectly killing people we're going indirectly kill even people unless get way"" toxic behavior ever. 

Don't try justify rationalize toxic attitude EU's politicians. Even r/europe people vehemently disagree nationalistic stance.

Imagine house burning fire department refuses help you. accept sue fire department set fire neighbors' houses hoping maybe, maybe, fire department get work save house first (spoiler alert: work). surprise me. months, may eventually odd one vaccinated yet, definitely put additional pressure remaining few.

I think cases/deaths start go down, economy become main focus hopefully messaging getting vaccine getting back normal important save jobs restore economy. I'm excited happy Superbowl Wrestlemania fans.(same stadium, mania April) Outdoor stadium shows definitely huge deal terms spread.

Hard hit businesses appreciate little extra business events bring even capacity limited. choose vaccine get ? (moderna/pfizer) imagine joy felt drove past prissy enormously expensive I.B. religious private school kids football field playing flag football. masks on, others not. close contact. 

then there’s school street me, kids playing every day close contact, typically wearing nothing cloth mask. 

this going backfire, backfire HARD. disappointed biden ok’ing this, whatever. don’t kids i’m fully vaccinated, problem. fun watch new strains spread families “experts” put best shocked pikachu face. 

i’ll stay inside continue i’ve anyways. ""dire""...there enough data draw conclusion. probably better placebo...we enough cases deduce, Phase 2 trials, elderly generated robust immune response. might dissipate quickly younger people, almost certainly effect probably AZ agrees release contract not, probably give us hint going similar 

Because similar. different, much. War peace Currently unknown appear from, says article. instead one delivery Feb apparently three larger overall amount. can't march production exactly. waited two weeks receiving second dose? wtf point all. Pumped. fucking pumped. overreaction news. doesn’t change much. AZ strategy company capable delivering orders major clients? Especially clients invested massively development vaccine? 


I'm really sure AZ would like image reliable alienate EU market. I've following news since Brexit referendum always ""EU punishes UK"" BS. anyone surprised? 95%

Just make sure, 95% efficacy vaccine means 20 people got shot one respond vaccine creating antibodies. 19 others immune, 5% chance getting covid.

Everybody test antibodies getting shots act accordingly. suspect even counter productive. means shop overcrowed 17 Well yes trials normally take years scrunched short months, surprising things went wrong.

At end day come leading vaccine highest production capacity world sold cost order magnitude cheaper mRNA vaccines well easier logistics storage likely save hundreds thousands lives globally. That's something proud imo.

Of course everyone wants picture perfect data instantly reality get picture perfect data next months anyway. Pfizer never tested see efficacy asymptomatic cases (or transmission) Caveat, scientist, follow things I'm paranoid want vaccine 1) possible AZ's vaccine efficacy lower PFE/Moderna measuring asymptomatic infections?

Possible! unknowable. suspect might true would seen higher infection rates post-vaccination Israeli studies would assume rely 2) LD/SD, SD/SD?

No idea guess, weird Low Dose Standard Dose thing AZ caught onto due mistakes UK wanted trial 3) 10 hospitalizations entire ~12,000 control arm...isn't bit low side? Thought would ~2-3% &lt;1%

IIRC, AZ vaccine prove effective reducing hospitalizations tests, seemed less effective reducing case loads. get virus, knocked ass hard. Yikes!

Honestly, someone enjoys staying home, I'm sure year may nice you. get avoid social obligations pat back saving lives, I'm sure certain people would perfectly happy continue live life feel good staying home time. There's nothing wrong staying home loving it, everyone lot people mental health take serious hit past year. Measles seem found variant decades, it? Sure. buy ticket first Judging post history, you’re probably bit biased. least bit contract containing specific deliverable amounts quarter seems missing translation. person gave shot must looked wrong table maybe person prior reaction still thinking 30 minutes.

So got wait 30 minutes instead 15.

I got line leave minutes thinking line would take bit ended going fast. 

They made go back wait final two minutes came back checked again. Lol.

Its good see people ground stickler rules something like this. history shown us previous pandemics virus mutations serious implications whats come, hopefully vaccines stay effect enough get us soon ppl reddit need stop absolute denial important information like might imply. 

Maybe year maybe bottom line non us control virus scientists working develop potentially necessary booster shots do, absorb information comes leave experts guide us next steps necessary get soon possible. parenting sub I’ve seen lot “Help! three year old won’t participate Zoom Preschool!” Like oh god, joking? right move use Pfizer one older people one younger ones?

Not necessarily. 

Pfizer harder transport store, younger people actually get centralized locations. 

That, fact AZ \~4× supply UK Pfizer. No... say article:

**In equivalent sample** unvaccinated Israelis, 6,437 diagnosed timeframe fire building, fire alarms going off. out. believe case NY, received first dose already gotten two text messages reminding come second couple weeks. outdoor 5 months away. already postponed. 12k line. concern.

If people want come, that's fine. open making guest list smaller too. can't put life hold anymore. June year since things started US, risk guests vaccinated, maybe guests rate. certain point, life go on.

I firmly believe barring truly apocalyptic scenario, June better time get married time last year. that's good enough me. things progress month, less likely apocalyptic scenario looks probable (yes, even variants).

Have little faith. Yeah good luck finding ethical employer cares human anywhere capacity. Realpolitik practiced consequence Brexit?

Unforseeable! intended satirical comment mirroring style charlatan named Dr. Ding... nutritionist has, throughout pandemic, making tweets like that.

I swear would funny people know Ding is. ""We touch faces lot without consciously knowing it.""

Speak guess, I'm definitely person. It’s already states. Canada needs lot help, pronto.  [Pfizer’s Covid-19 vaccine production back impact minimal: delivered 8% fewer doses planned.”

I idea much production capacity increased.

Hopefully BioNTech's new factory Marburg starting production soon. thanks accepting information. dont want seem like think world ending, want spread fear rain everyone's parade, think there's real hope, informed decisions best decisions NY ""pods"" become HUGE thing wealthy neighborhoods.

Parents could afford ir loved keps kids safer, allowing socialization. 

Teachers hired allowed teach safer environment public schools.  Yes, well supplemental oxygen observation nurses. Elementary schoolers Zoom might depresssing thing I've heard while. That’s type rhetoric people mask closing non essential businesses used since start. don’t see one would give end sprint finish bury this. also implied vaccines aren’t going help much basically told us get back inside zoom go foreseeable future. class zero virology anything like that, it’s certainly helping take seriously. long spike protein doesnt restructure a-ok. gf one ppl gives vaccine, said iirc thicker vaccines. maybe that's Fauci said last Friday ok Maddow though dont know story believe honest. dont think EU would seize vaccins without fair reason either. suppose time tell. 

And apologies EU asshole story. believe fair sharing vaccines countries contintents. need it. Moderna affected? I'm confused bc figured differences two vaccines minimal Oh wow.... I’m sooooooooo scared. got banned said we’d normal 2022. completely civil comments still up. Messaged mods asking got response. Pathetic. ""Only fits""? sure point is.

My point ffp2's actually fit everyone (ok, ADULTS) MUCH better cloth masks ever could, (in addition material used) requirement Bavaria (and Germany guess - sure live Bavaria reqs stricter time).

But well known fact advantages ffp2 largely lost bearded faces \*fit\* compromised. vaccinated subsequently exposed virus (regardless variant) seems likely every week immunity enhanced transmission dampened, eliminated.

We already know asymptomatic people less likely spread Covid. means conjecture still.

That’s like saying math conjecture teacher grades paper. course peer review important saying data worthless peer review word god farcical

It’s set stone, it’s still “a pretty solid bet” Well duh, travel restriction. I’ve read far. EU ordered August agreed certain amount doses. assume based expecting able produce, wild guess. Mind you, pharma company specialized do. December significant issues reported. mean time production EU exported. weeks later, EMA getting approval request, sudden expect 5 10, 60%! less. me, smells fishy. blaming EU ordered late, that’s low blow feels like throwing baby bathwater. still lot good responsible journalism TV print. Dismissing media untrustworthy likely result worse outcomes judicious watch/read (and seeking media confirms assumptions biases) Really depends status vaccines. still think would spectator free create a

Then see people dyin left right covid people still ain’t maskin washing hands 

Idk shits gonna play people won’t even mask expect vax 

Tons younger friends don’t even wear masks “dude covid isn’t even dangerous I’m healthy LMAO”

I agree, suits better vax lead example Honestly, although get other's nerves, like it.Maybe I've worked weird schedules lot lives working home home school, home love spend breaks them, spend me. Unfortunately youngest, usually honor roll struggling stay track, course miss social interaction, 2 high risk family members, probably stay home end school year. Teachers important, vital work kids’ wellbeing. didn’t stop true there’s pandemic. Parents equipped work long-term; that’s point specialization economy. 

How got idea coffee shops, fast food, elective doctor’s appointments essential schools aren’t beyond me. 

I always respected teachers tremendously advocated higher pay resources. seeing gleefully teacher’s unions put children’s well-being chopping block... well, it’s eye-opening. work non-emergent, non-essential outpatient medical clinic, we’ve navigating uncertainty changing recommendations unforeseen circumstances since April.  Patting India back gazing China unimpressed expression. Trump administration, would advising drink detergent try sell hydroxychloroquine. 1. bother even lower flu numbers? Vulnerable people get vaccine first. 

2. actually big problem, social distance well? mask? alone save you? promising. Let's check numbers March. People complain individual cost American health care, quality functionality. Nah, error big serious. literally contributed death thousands. Everyone involved deal receive death penalty.  12-15 year old children following conditions apply vaccination:

(each application needs approved HMO another high ranking public health official)

1. Children person suffering severe immunosuppression. 
2. Adolescents severely obese high BMI compared weight height percentages age. 
3. Developmental neurological disorders including seizures congenital syndromes. 
4. Diabetes. 
5. Severe chronic lung disease severely impairs lung function. include balanced asthma patients (as opposed suffering chronic asthma attacks - eligible vaccine). 
6. Immune repressive conditions, including patients biologic drugs immunosuppressive drugs. 
7. Cancer patients. 
8. Heart failure pulmonary hypertension. 
9. Kidney failure. 
10. Sickle cell anemia. Hoping she’s gonna feel great momentarily!

I’m super skeptical vaccine (not antivaxxer long shot), really want higher suits Pfizer others show example taking shots, would persuade lot people.

This whole debacle can’t end sooner right? Feels like decade passed. mean, 65+ year olds getting regardless.  I’m sure asked discussed ad nauseam, what’s general consensus long receiving second vaccine shot one fully protected be? 
 
I received second shot week even though don’t plan stop wearing mask public social distancing foreseeable future, feel little bit less stressed? 
 
Also, info interacting again? There’s many conflicting reports whether vaccinated person still able spread virus. two weeks vaccine full efficacy be, see hug friends? Vietnam tourism almost 10% GDP, that's pretty good chunk dead moment. 

Both countries open quicker think. Money talks countries start opening up, agree left behind lose share tourism revenue. might first so, sure hell last. feel like knowing people got vaccine side effects grow two heads whatever going help comfort levels.

100%. know teachers want return school protection.

But hey, talk talk, go walk walk become teacher. right now, you’re saying can’t back up. no, americas whole. 💀 man UK go almost hitting 500k vaccinations day dropping 220-300k?

It’s nice winter though. Lots people getting really low readings, I’m not. current thinking estimates total infections might high, lesson. also possible new variant reinfecting people. Either bad. correct I'm wrong recent development, phemonimally almost 2020 god knows reason.

The engineered coronavirus simply contain anywhere near number mutations spike protein VSV pseudovirus had. actually make full variant run assay, I'd inclined believe them. “Key South African mutations” ... wait?

Smh happens US probably send Pfizer vaccines ones who’ve already first shot. Would massive geopolitical win US. Thing there's properly tested vaccines. Usually takes 5+ years launch vaccine market. 

Yes Pfizer little bit better, every vaccine market made compromises speed. power soft restrictions logistics, suppose week they’ll still meet targets

Not timescales agreed though, I'm pretty sure even started production europe yet. Pfizer also problems delivery.

Pfizer let know 2 weeks go.

Astrazeneca giving similar warning.   mean, can't go around feeling bad people dying whole life, context regarding curfews. 

Everyone die though gotten vaccine yet. apparently people blood type suffer effects blood type. thinking maybe vaccine similar effects. blood type positive, trying guage expect possible. 8% claim Handelsblatt seems technically correct, also rather useless statistic huge confidence interval lack data mention.

Also EU: Block exports!

EU: want EU's fair share everyone share equally shortfall

Also EU: Block exports allow full quota delivered!

Absolute hypocrisy. trying get vaccines bound UK divert EU?

It's unclear true, AZ obviously denies allegations. they're accused opposite, they're diverting vaccines bound EU UK, UK pays money per vaccine.

Obviously, would bad. I'm honestly sure believe amazing bad AZ seems PR, trials vaccine deliveries complete mess. Alright, do. pack clorox wipes santitizer setup right next screen next time student use it. wouldn’t count “most vulnerable” vaccinated then. rate going, including disabled high risk individuals, won’t vaccinated around late April May, earliest. Hope right No, EU producing them, AZ producing factories located certain EU countries. 

You understand difference private company (AZ), country (the UK), political union many countries (EU). 

If EU blocks exports AZ vaccine, magically get vaccines since vaccines legally belong AZ clients (other countries). 

The EU playing stupid game chicken ever threatening block vaccine exports since would royally screwing UK many countries absolutely nothing AZ mismanagement.

The moral thing left EU point sue AZ tax oblivion plants located EU. screwing countries right thing do. talking Israel following true:

1) incident happens vaccine emergency use noted investigated proper professionals 

2) almost certainly unrelated. vaccinating 1 million people day, decent going drop dead unrelated causes day 

3) media statistically literate enough know professional ethics consider headlines imply readers even dont actually say lost turns Americans really hard control, especially virus like COVID-19 that's, whether admit not, even close world-ender. makes sense. people told regardless vaccination status, need quarantine 10 days every time exposure, it’s going drive vaccination rates. Yup, administration that, *at best*, cares 'optics' actually anything positive, constructive, helpful, end up. :(

Pfizer contractual agreement yet ship sell EU (and EU receive decide nation gets many).  


My question is, vaccine capable shipped Air ?  


If so, PFizer factories states could ship UK European factories ship States make blocked shortfall - financially penalised making committed deliveries UK. Exactly, numbers like this, pandemic-ending breakthrough, work looks like work vaccines flu. keep sequencing new strains adjusting vaccine accordingly. Moderna already looking additional booster shots variants. Argentina: tests per 1M: 132k / deaths per 1M: 1044 / 2020 GDP forecast: -12.9 %

Mexico tests per 1M: 30k / deaths per 1M: 1184 / 2020 GDP forecast: -8.0%

Brazil tests per 1M: 134k / deaths per 1M: 1032 / 2020 GDP forecast: -4.5%

&amp;#x200B;

Argentina longest one strictests lockdown among major economies. Mexican president downplayed pandemics like Bolsonaro. Brazil worse Latin American countries. Although EU failed act quickly sign contract

This non-argument commercial contracts. Performance requirements dates matter , nothing else. 

Example: 

Company orders Product X Company target delivery date 1/1/2030. contract signed 1/1/2028.

Company B orders Product X Company target delivery date 31/12/2029. contract signed 30/12/2029.

Company B contractually entitled receive product Company , despite Company ordering 2 years earlier. No, you’re probably fine. mRNA vaccines tend provoke less side effects traditional vaccines. that's easily explained away old people healthcare workers given first vulnerable group already weakest immune systems (old people) constantly exposed (healthcare workers) mean company HQ Cambridge, Sweden?? even close. 179 countries corruption ranking. US #25 ahead famous countries like Spain, Israel, South Korea, Italy, China (#78), Russia (#129), France (#23). ""Free 12 count nugget deluxe sandwich vaccine!""

Done Probably March's supply pushed forward tbh. Imagine blaming government letting drive family dies car accident. Maybe grief clouded mind. maybe she’s fucking stupid. Yup ADE  It’s complete block, they’re gonna start controls vaccine exports (excluding COVAX exports poorer countries) besides AstraZeneca seem finally willing negotiate EU, hopefully prevent EU tightening restrictions exports.

Basically people follow path, normalcy starts resume people see follow along. pretend huge negative impact society.

Yes! Let’s Go!!! exchange want 75 million doses.

Where say that? responded today. Fine. able publish contract soon assuming release NDA done writing. people wonder spread much UK. know dosing changed anything. Better results might caused group lower average age (which did). what's anti-vaxxer EMTs? sister EMT basically refused get vaccine. said colleagues dodging well. CDC ACOG's recommendations changed (don't withhold vaccine pregnant women). said administer vaccine, that's lack data data would indicate harmful all. 

My wife made decision get vaccine (first dose) 34th week pregnancy. (and me) benefits vaccine outweigh whatever risks might hypothetically exist. mRNA broken reaches placenta see risk fetus. 36th week regular vaccine side effects like sore arm.

23 women became pregnant receiving Pfizer vaccine trial known adverse reactions occurred. Edit: also note 6% reported, useless, clearly Handelsblatt article came from.

Are sure? German health ministry, suggested “two things confused reports.” 

“About eight percent subjects ... trial 56 69 years age, three four percent 70 years age,” stated health ministry spokesperson.

Biden literally saved humanity Looks like sensible compromise made. wonder extra doses magically found. Yeah, multiple studies countries around world say so. Keep seething tho. fuck supposed expand daycares multiple times capacity turn de-facto schools. Keeping schools open best way this, put precautions. system perfect keeping schools open precautions least bad. Haters say faked Check trials age too!

Good book though! gonna lie, I'm loving drama new powers make clear. there's shortfall EU, export blocked. Pfizer already behind.  “insufficient” replaced “useless”. obvious along.

Puritanism cure virus. Restrictions US impact people others. lot people lost livelihoods business closures. Kids college students missed year education social opportunities school closures. Working home really sucks lot people whose living situations conducive it. 

Yes, lockdowns US strict China, Australia, parts Europe, etc., pretend huge negative impact society. Nice, but, snows? Oregon? Considering flu almost non-existant 2020 thank measures taken covid pretty weird stance.  Wrong 

Buckle up. completely understand frustration. don’t understand guys taking everyone else, fault government? 

No one stealing vaccines. government slow react. Sure block exports vaccines nations, going result lawsuits, diplomatic rows counties blocking vaccines/ingredients EU. mention long term impact companies thinking it’s worth hassle manufacturing done EU. totally understand everything wrote. comes fear able handle situation.

Wouldn't right move use Pfizer one older people one younger ones? anything? showing evidence J&amp;J course meet targets. person begun thread saying would better without AZ. 6.3% efficacy AstraZeneca lowest point CI. point estimate. nothing like Pfizer data. Pfizer data shows efficacy people 65. AstraZeneca not. 

After seeing data, lot people owe Handelsblatt apology. trust school daycare.  -12.1% lower bound 75+ Pfizer. covid vaccines ridiculous confidence intervals older age groups still find strange decided approve AZ Pfizer Moderna.

Immune response still seems high though. UK exported technology. factories build EU make AZ vaccine. Half Swedish actually! 8% individuals got vaccine got sick...is outcome infection better? sick counterparts get vaccine? people active social lives, jobs, hardly transmit anyone outside care home.

For UK: “The first interim analysis based 62 cases, 56 cases COVID-19 observed placebo group versus 6 cases observed NVX-CoV2373 group, resulting point estimate vaccine efficacy 89.3% (95% CI: 75.2 – 95.4). 62 cases, 61 mild moderate, 1 severe (in placebo group).”

After guess Astrazeneca likes rest. Honest question, documented cases successfully vaccinated person spreading covid? grave concerns 80% population outweigh concerns 20% population loses 5-10 years. *quite* bad. 

Problem focusing deaths nobody dies anymore infections skyrocket like GME share. that's going cripple whoooole lot people. grave concerns 80% population outweigh concerns 20% population loses 5-10 years. *quite* bad.

Worst fears happened... 50% efficacy South Africa strain novavax 96% regular strain Pfizer Moderna good sign problem people show symptoms infect others quite easily.

However, seem difference never develop symptoms do. Unfortunately can't tell difference looking them. EU make sense. r/COVID19 someone pointed curious. “Novavax’s smaller trial found vaccine 49.4 percent efficacy overall.

Lock downs finished U.S.. think Pfizer/Moderna similar efficacy Novavax normalize population (Novavax's trial slightly order participants) margin error. 

But mRNA vaccines naturally advantage T-cell response. one knows much impact has. 

There's also many organizations experts think 50-60% efficacy good enough stop spread, account likely population would refuse take vaccine likely would need 70-80% efficacy (esp virus mutates transmissible). 

Either way kinda moot point even Novavax announced they're developing booster SA variant they'll select candidate next couple days. Novavax nearly 90% [efficient ](http://news.sky.com/story/covid-19-uk-trials-show-experimental-novavax-coronavirus-vaccine-is-893-effective-12201756).

So far:

* create vaccine, Oxford team did.

* trial mess. That's EMA approved yet. That's FDA ordered new trials. that's Germany said give 65s.

It seems though HIV removed findings boosted SA variant 60%... see approved US HIV result, since it’s likely Pfizer Moderna better front. 

Not great news SA variant... incredible news variants... encouraging enough still protective all. 100% agree. Biden’s “100 million shots 100 days” goal pathetically under-ambitious. Every American wants vaccine one then. probably defense mechanism. Otherwise confront fact made choice killed loved ones. Hospitalizations nearly 20% peak noise data makes hard say exactly new case peak was, last couple dyas 25-30% compared 2 weeks prior. Midwest region started drop earlier regions (having started wave earlier well) new cases fallen nearly 2/3 there. third phase phase 1B NYC time allowed receive vaccinations appointments available. Still aren't. experts? thought asymptomatic spread huge problem? maybe it’s pre-symptomatic I’m thinking of. Look, know what's going on. fishy, one deny that. EU points out, Pfizer completely open transparent would deliver when, told shortages due upgrade would make etc, etc. 

Meanwhile, AZ last minute told EU would 10% short, 20% short, no, full 60% (!) short. due unspecified problems Belgian plant, UK supply kept rolling uninterrupted. account happened stockpile supposedly preparing since October. credible answers even repeated high-level meetings commission AZ. 

So gives? Some, high risk parents disregard advice go test. know someone who's kid exposed thrice, never tested. scan lungs? mean lost 20 years life expectancy country year, yeah kind doom gloom scenario. people listened instead sticking fingers ears like reality global respiratory pandemic, mess. Agreed, matchup potentially greatest QB time heir apparent. great watch! would thought technically effective two, least original strain. According Novavax's [press ""95.6% original COVID-19 strain"" , ""85.6% UK variant strain"", 60% effective troubling new South Africa strain. 


If recall correctly, Moderna's efficacy original strain 94% Pfizer's 95% 95.6 95 Someone know told tested positive today :/ still legally buy cigarettes so.... public school teacher 100% agree.

We advised every organization devotes science avoid congregating, especially social distancing impossible. classrooms teach 30+ students IMPOSSIBLE. Even person beginning year, students wearing masks properly constantly removing them. Wow! whole paragraph repeat criticism already made already accepted.

You seem easier time words math. Fair enough. point, however, need reduce blah-blah figures. Making prediction science about. is, taking account 95% reduced affect elderly, assume that, effect 10% 65+ would vulnerable received anything. saying 80% fully protected, 20% 50% protected. _you_ tell _you_ think death toll would every 65+ vaccinated exposed.

Or would rather keep pontificating?  study involved 15,000 participants aged 18 84, 27% aged 65.

That’s great! Never grateful work rural county CA. got vaccine changed age guidelines.  vaccinated family friends vaccinated able hang much want.

Just take precautions going public pandemic still present area. 

 american likely receive vaccine sooner rest world.

Everything get better life would go back normal see. see news back saying FDA look non American trials trials par American standards. wish would disclose many, any, severe cases group infected received vaccine, excluding HIV positive group immuno compromised begin with.

Another factor consider trial sites South Africa different socio economic challenges UK, people would find adequate social distancing, access reasonable masks, access sanitiser much harder come by. Would interesting compare results J&amp;J / Pfizer also trials this, see comparable base. would agitate people back line you’d riots vaccine centers.

You riots large, urban cities U.S. lock continue warm, Summer months. No, op know they're talking willfully obtuse. AZ produced Europe they're slap fighting UK receiving full orders limited EU. Title kinda misleading. information contrary Pfizer's 95% promise, Pfizer talking effectiveness 28 days 2nd dose article talks 7-18 days. means vaccine prevents infection even earlier Pfizer initially thought, really good news.

Didn't read article I'm lazy slob (just recovered covid, I'm allowed one), 66 people got infected second dose, 250,000 vaxxed, mostly 55+ years old background illnesses, and... wait it... cases mild. even 38.5°C fever.

Definitely good news. Okay, thanks! think year us staying home barely seeing friends family means we're willing make sacrifices. Ha...Novavax jumping line??? said Thursday early analysis 15,000-person trial Britain revealed two-dose vaccine efficacy rate nearly 90 percent there. small trial South Africa, efficacy rate dropped 50 percent.

It's early analysis, I'd assume enough date yet approval, want share good (and bad) news early. hope Biden shifts messaging becomes widely available, doubt TBH. Trump
was anti-science, American politics series radical actions radical counter reactions, wouldn’t shocked Biden goes along Fauci keeps us locked October, show us pro-science contrast. mean studies issues results less ideal overall efficacy 70% compared 85-95% Moderna Pfizer.

However overall sample size good, 70% good enough. also showed low levels adverse reactions compared vaccines.

Are holes? Sure saying prove efficacy false.  shit-can mask mandate - confusing state. least count consistency Iowa, always mediocre wrt COVID. Evil EU trying partially save face partially what's best citizens. 

While problem incompetence shown whole duration, trying get vaccines EU citizens normal, UK US others doing. US blocking PPE exports last spring/summer. Novavax received orders minimum 276 million doses supply U.S., Australia, Canada, U.K. UK secured 60m doses jab, made Teeside. kinds comments derail discussions, aren’t able cope talk family member, friend therapist. matter SA variant becomes dominant unvaccinated populations late spring early summer?

People cited paperwork, bureaucracy, poor communication, covid outbreaks nursing homes wait subsides vaccinating.

The New Jersey governor said many things CVS/Walgreens program.

Also Virginia sends doses localities (counties etc) based local population ability give shots, places can't give lack paperwork, personnel, way make track appointments, etc. places give shortage can't give surplus. probably bunch sitting freezers.

The governor said 90k doses given tracked apparently tracking complicated, health care workers need submit online form fill paperwork including 40 fields, rural areas internet connectivity apparently can't submit data. sounds stupid able use phone knows.

Because uncertain supply vaccines, lot places reserving 2nd shot give 1st shot causes bunch doses sit 3 weeks.

The governor person put charge completely lame, keep blaming federal government sending doses meanwhile they've failed administer half ones have. keep saying understand people frustrated nothing improve it. friends eligible (health care workers etc) appointments cancelled meanwhile 500,000 doses sitting freezers elsewhere state. Hello! I've reading anecdotes wherever find regarding second dose, seems feel ill second dose, regardless Pfizer Moderna.

My girlfriend received first dose last week felt muscle soreness days, lift arm without pain.

I received first dose yesterday felt discomfort full range motion.

Regarding friend, saying aunt 60s soreness second dose?! That's great news, anyways :^)

Otherwise, you’re fear-mongering, what’s point that? supply chain reporting chains long winding.

Makes sense people end hospital? No? Cool. Done. 

People going catch covid. March. fully expect get again. However chances whatever version covid, I’ll totally fine protection. We’re acting like infection wholly unacceptable means distancing forever. Moderna started production. Moderna vaccines produced Lonza plants Europe US.   Interesting. people week two post second shot protected phase?  It'll interesting see levels time goes - hopefully hold strong get damn thing. also interesting see compares natural infection induced immunity. People keep assuming vaccines provide better protection, longitudinal studies still need done. It'll interesting they're same. quicker this, better hopefully herd immunity (in combination both) reached around July people predict (in US least) Niceeeeeeeeeee

Tomorrow’s one day HOPE bad one lol.

Lots places economic support health insurance, prevent second third waves. good things help, think experts exaggerated much control really spread virus.

But think good way keep people safe connected without physical connection. Humans need humans physically, think telling people give need long going disaster ways can't predict. There's reason believe continue current rate.

The manufacturers still ramping capacity states still ramping distribution. reason can't get 2-3 million administered doses day, couple months get there. Primarily prevent dynasties forming.

At best, EU trying use legal loopholes contracts steal UK supplies. live peacefully knowing randomly get spread disease could kill family? Even social distancing? banned NYC subreddit.

Any mention verboten.

A govt report. Reported NYT others. Memory holed. Sanofi expects start manufacturing mid July, end Q2, significant deliveries expected Q3. 

I'm trying clarify people overly optimistic get disappointed. vaccine rollout getting ridiculous areas. understand need vaccinate certain groups first, vaccines going trashed, makes sense vaccinate anyone can. We're going need vaccinated anyway, fail see problem. able get vaccine, get it. to. highly effective vaccine also prevents transmission. known.

It's like surprised fitness instructor says ""NEVER eat processed foods!"" country Germany trying everything deny facts spread doom. can't get disgusting that. temptation shove findings throat every red-necked Anti-vaxxer quite powerful.

But then, can't quite read.

So I'll happy fact science (AND METRIC TON HARD WORK) winning, instead. Firstly nobody got AZ vaccine died COVID. That's goal. 

That absolutely goal. goal prevent kind long-term effects. obligation AstraZeneca provide agreed upon doses agreed time parties involved, EU UK. recent article EU contract even specifies 2 UK based factories involved supply EU. hot mess made AstraZeneca promessing things can't do, latest article even mentions AstraZeneca suddenly finding extra dosesses EU. try explain would pay 336 milion delivery say ""60% good enough"" afterwards, clear notify EU last possible moment going make agreed upon delivery. kicks rich duh CNN needs fire whoever wrote headline That's boring man!! first delays announced saying they'd deliver promised, couple weeks later started talking delivering. Guess hedged delays process ramping manufacturing, things gone relatively smoothly.

So completely wrong, updated. Someone questions everything must crime. r/furrys care. it’s restrictions completely thrown out, media focused horrible covid next pandemic worse, focusing viruses pandemic potential, “mutant” forms current coronavirus, I’d guess may even seasonality media reporting — every flu season could next pandemic! flu related death... “could next pandemic disease”... on. anything, Canada thank EU.

Weird see different peoples experience been. sure, seems like still super easy get scheduling phone call doctor. guys getting tested without referral probably less likely infected anyway who're tested proximity known case symptoms. Yeah I'm sure obviously can't prove it. Let's see break 100 downies Can’t tamper Title ;-)

But true USA well! fucking year able see people's faces seen others. able properly socialize since last spring. think masks burden, good you. millions others, absolutely burden, can't wait day throw away. UK says ""well made contract first plants UK ours"" EU replies ""omg plants ours!"" 
  
 
But situations reversed, EU says ""nah fuck Canada. can't get problem"". Dr. Snow says half Americans want vaccine immediately. Another quarter hesitant 25 percent say get all.

I think really need focused soon. Yeah demand sky high things improve coming weeks months. shown lot vaccine hesitancy minority communities. need leaders communities show important is. People don’t listen he’s Dr. Doom Gloom. Telling people wear masks travel there’s definitive scientific proof can’t spread vaccine? 

At point make inferences everything else know diseases vaccines couple healthy dose common sense self awareness you’re saying may sound. else be, first come first served? EU whining haven’t simply reacted time. It’s simple demand supply issue hopefully ironed coming months. skip age group apart children. findings released interim data collected. unusual data old people come later last enrolled trial safety reasons less likely get virus work cautious. 

But immune response young old same, hence decision approve vaccine adults regulators. Oh, love story. vaccine program about. absolute dedication Healthcare workers getting many people possible, even adverse unforeseen conditions. vaccination doses like gold right now, made sure one wasted even stranded road. wonderful. can't AstraZeneca vaccine, publishing mean efficacy confidence intervalls. whole problem. issue elderly data much whether works not. It´s today limited amount data older population. think program today run Oxford, Oxford program. Oxford academy group. They´re ethical, academic. didn´t want vaccinate older people accumulated lot safety data 18 55 group. said ethical vaccinate old people enough safety data younger people. companies took risk, went ahead vaccinated older people faster earlier. start earlier, people wear masks wear “lifted.” It’s really political theater. It’s like enforced state all. People made minds whether wear mask not. part phase III trial SA, find results announced next week. Risky move UK use population so. Oh need 328 million masks times 28. Seems feasible. AstraZeneca screw phase 3 trail much.... Like seriously.... much controversy cuz incompetence. embarrassed them. say EMA? I'm reading, German decision. could give every symptom case 'rona would, I'd still take I'd know ultimately harmless there's risk long term side effects death. point person replied wrong since thing claimed would happen actually already happening. EU keeping production internal themselves.

Yes. EU keeping vaccine US firm made UK ingredients. could have, signed better contracts earlier, AZ/EU feud vaccine issue UK EU. 

It becomes one UK threatened export ban EU demands vaccines contractually obliged overstated capacity made contracts fulfilling. think anyone deny that.

Yes. Obviously. denying that? UK less delivered contract, too. furore concerns EU's response know disagreements past, respect acknowledging people’s sacrifices. Despite news may want believe, majority population taking precautions right now. Especially younger generations, sacrificed much actually mocked scolded “not knowing real struggle looks like. least get acknowledgement someone. Really depends many vaccines actually send UK. alone fact EU monitor things, tells us incompetent people are. governments held accountable putting trust institution, especially people like Merkel called back health minister early efforts secure vaccine. Vaccines kill severe disease thing big point lot people miss. eradicating covid-19, least next years, realistically true herd immunity long way off. really matters many at-risk groups protect severe disease outcomes. Right every vaccine seems protect severe disease that's important kids able get herd immunity vacinnated clarify, I'm saying that's precisely measures sustainable long term. Sad part life, people die disease, COVID stay can't live Zero COVID risk-free lives forever. Unless go full feudalistic mode travel contact outside bubble, suppose. Swine flu nearly April 12, 2009 April 10, 2010, CDC estimated **60.8 million cases** (range: 43.3-89.3 million), 274,304 hospitalizations (range: 195,086-402,719), 12,469 deaths (range: 8868-18,306) United States due (H1N1)pdm09 However, AstraZeneca failed disclose efficacy age group. refuse publish data whether actually efficacy age group. scientist recommend giving age group. D614G

Wow, forgot that. funny concept new variant goes back essentially beginning global outbreak, yet sudden UK one people start panic. really disgusting media shaping public's opinion understanding what's happening. Oh go. skipped fundamental age group altogether. Great. called taking personal responsibility. refuse visit family know risks. depends mean normalcy. Bars restaurants open summer. thing early data blinded, unless mean phase I/II studies (in case AZ looks good too). 
Even J&amp;J gets approved though, woods (without help another vaccine) end Q3 though, 2021. 

Better keep hoping US trial AZ works (should data soon too). data AZ included data within 18-55 age groups significant CI.   work great creativity, collaboration, building social capital inside business clients.

Tell need person physically front collaborate creative though. Zoom / Teams video calls give exact things. Well depends immune response. since AZ vaccine found immune response young/old same, likely significant differences efficacy. Try worry much fall; even though I've extremely careful pessimistic whole thing, seem likely enough adults vaccinated brought case counts way fall. I'm trying worry get bit closer. I'm optimistic vaccines we're eradicating thing. infectious anti-vax people, difficulty getting vaccine less developed parts world fact variants seem existing starting reduce vaccines effectiveness (still works SA variant shows potential escape mutations).

The good news low mortality rate people that's really issue, fine covid-19 exist, need vaccines risk groups protect severe disease. think people trials Moderna, Pfizer Oxford actually severe disease died covid getting second dose, thing real world data Israel. people getting mild version covid absolutely fine expected Stay strong, man, wishing best. tell know make easier, unlimited support love people really going right now. DPA initiation provide adequate supply proper ventilators timely fashion. big deal sounds. Mask mandates exist county level. populous counties mask mandates. dumb thing do, big impact. herd immunity kids get vaccines Congrats. stupid. :) Thanks admitting that. 

You’re right it’s quite complex depend contract haven’t seen. However, still disagree UK doesn’t deserve vaccines first. signed contract earlier giving time set supply chain UK (they similar issues Q4 EU facing now). EU giving significantly less time AZ impact UK recognised urgency EU didn’t. Also hard say UK doesn’t deserve first vaccines literally agreements AZ(UK due get deliveries Q4 2020, EU Q1 2021). 220 Americans 18 100% want vaccine. Also Dr. Fauci said early data J&amp;J looks promising approved couple weeks, give us another 100 doeses AZ even gets approved. I'm absolutely fan tory government, crystal clear one--they making legal try get control large scale anticipated rule breaking, absolutely would safe. agree way handled never suggested anything risky thing do. Even logic alone tell hanging elderly relatives risk, government explicitly tell us that.

I feel bad necessarily blame meeting up. Things utterly grim temptation take gamble strong. felt too. Though resisted it, much understand others may have. knew risks made decisions accordingly. consequences one else's fault. Thank you! Sure approving within next days? Otherwise complain receiving enough even plan use it? Yeah, people get sick die. 

Just like die dozens diseases, thousands flu year. Thank this. Bless family. Well called immediately saw vaccine less effective freaked out. good news Well, efficiency vaccine strictly age related (Just like gravity disease), may start thinking AZ data (95% efficacy) tweaked order show higher rate sampling 65 people.. time tell. felt pretty bad 36 hours following first shot. worth though. greatest nightmare go forward responding hyper risk group localized diseases instant indefinite lockdowns. 

If another covid situation disease almost exclusively targets immune deficient old people, shut everything year minimum (unlikely get vaccines fast normally;) honestly would probably end it

I make whole thing, worked radio arts show production loved work. Covid killed stable income. started working kitchens since covid found love line. another lockdown happened move moms house wouldn’t able to.

I already moved home one pandemic financially I’d goddamn embarrassed depressed couldn’t again. already feel similar shit family media telling it’s fault up-and-changing careers. nightmares instant month long lockdowns brought media fear mongering  Swine flu nearly contagious, would concerned it’s true measure vaccines - say don’t take you’re likely allergic.

I mean don’t take flu shot reacting you?  you’d count allergic reaction covid vaccine (that you’re taking) you’d also count yearly allergic reaction flu shot (that you’re taking).  would weird way count.

Also rate many bad reactions *could* cause really isn’t important own.  first number care many *does* cause.  second important number would many people excluded taking ... moment allergic reactions dwarfed reasons: age, pregnancy, available country. media really report confidence intervals estimated efficacy number imo. vaccines. AstraZeneca failed report data efficay though. large confidence interval different refraining report efficacy data. Ending maybe countries. find amusing comparing flu COVID considered blasphemy general, somehow become comparable lol Yes, flu vaccines don’t work well older people chance know previously covid? heard anecdote symptoms seem worse people already infected. -- Many international science community reacted disappointment little frustration Wednesday, finally seeing statistical data study effectiveness medication confirm primary outcome statistically significant,” said Dr. Emily McDonald scientist MUHC’s Research Institute. variably infectious disease infecting humans wide variety compliance public safety measures even mandating measures reduce spread

Even humans complied disease clock work. Early experts poo pooed concerns variants, mutates slow, airborne, ... 

Until data know

This **novel** coronavirus meaning everything new

We know know

The best estimate

Then revise new data something like infectious variant getting foothold usa

Or maybe good news like effectiveness vacnnies people getting faster expect

Revise estimate again

Btw higher transmission requires higher herd immunity meaning larger % population needs get vaccinated variants can't spread far

Even best vax leaves 1 20 risk severe illness - that's 95% effective means. Add mutations, calculation changes. Chance reinfection increases.

*I bot, action performed automatically.

Even assuming Q3, 200m people though.

So definitely still depend J&amp;J long term, want quicker Q3/Q4 AZ too. Bet feeling pretty silly today huh Ah true, forgot 12-week delay doses bit. case two-dose results wait while

Also would interesting see data 80+ yo Germany blocked AZ vaccine over-65s! blame EU all? [A World Map Visualizing Coronavirus Cases Worldwide Past 365 agree, that's headline written Financial Times want editorialize. told newspaper prime minister Boris Johnson “blood hands” allowing people gather together Christmas England’s national lockdown come late.

Whilst sad horrific story, don’t agree take. Nearly year pandemic ignorance isn’t excuse, knew risks yet made decision meet up. Lot sub eager take cause too. CI Pfizer vaccine -13% 100% 75+ age group.

This means, there’s sufficient data. People need keep mind, important. We're dealing ""Spanish Flu take 2"" kind situation (and comparisons unhelpful dishonest), coronaviruses studied decades known stray far terms mutations. 

This kind magical supervirus that's going keep outsmarting us, new version zero natural immunity prior 2019. continue circulating quite likely forever, destined join endemic coronaviruses cause common cold; essentially concern otherwise healthy individuals certain level collective immunity built up. opinion parents claiming online learning, children falling way, way behind? waiting results separate US-based trials larger meet FDA's insistence ensuring efficacy different ethnicities. going results slightly strange results. lot people 1 dose remain one dose another month two. currently vaccinated people also mostly 80+ years old we're basically first test whether Oxford vaccine works well older folks 55 category may Philippines, going said previously country supply chain, suspect fairly near destination.

But course, nothing announced speculating based previous comments AZ.  never lockdown Manaus, sound insane trying defend piece sh*t Bolsonaro is, wanted let virus go wild nothing months, like Trump (and plenty evidences, even studies, showing Bolsonaro turned pandemic worst instead helping, even now).

Source think ""opinion"": US export vaccines produced enough locally. also importing Europe. Honest question, precedent vaccine that's effective people age ineffective people age? Germany use Astrazeneca vaccine people age 65! ""Data individuals 75 years age limited (about 1500 total, half vaccinated). subgroup, estimate 100% 95%CI lower bound –13%, reflects current uncertainty around vaccine efficacy age group.""
But Pfizer/BioNTech currently given 75 right? Confusing. Yeah, AZ overpromised UK EU, that's whole point.

Suing nothing EU, need money, need vaccines. agree bad look ask UKs vaccines, especially UK getting like 2 million week like 8 million month 16 million Q1, nowhere near 50 million EU shortfall. AZ fucked massively here, overpromising could realistically deliver informing EU earlier meet targets. J&amp;J coming soon number mNRA vaccines order seems like bu time could actully get AZ vaccines really need already supply better vaccines people. True. freedom choice literally alternatives vaccines right now. eighter chance dying, getting long term damage spreading further... vaccinate literally negatives. 

Hence comment. Freedom stupid. younger remember reading young teacher who

1. enjoyed beer,

That enough convince become teacher - respect. Getting exactly? Summer? know what’s people’s safety? forced isolation objectively causes mental illnesses objectively alter brain lower life expectancy long term

You know what’s safety? Making take minimum wage jobs don’t afford diet before, lack gym access lost weight pre covid gained since, since still people shaming going outside Yup. That’s Nazi’s said put people trains. SARS-COV-2 mutates pretty average rate viruses. fact, mutation rate somewhat slower viruses. incredibly uncommon viruses mutate way allows evade vaccination. knowledge, never happened before. rare, worry COVID-19, especially considering *slower* mutation rate. Yeah can't say 60%, week later say 70%, week later say 80%, week later say Immune response reliably predict vaccine efficacy. would need large-scale phase 3 trials case. Yep, misinterpreted bit, probably pre-coffee. anxious hear sterilizing immunity stats. Thanks clarification. comment commented efficacy though? smugly wrote data published Lancet? incorrect? 

Vaccines approved immune response, approved efficacy. evidence efficacy people 65. long AstraZeneca unwilling provide evidence, reason approve it. Well vaccine fact huge news one think rollout going pretty good.

I think people also starting realize extent media spinning hyping this. countless sources data show things improving. There's enough reason believe efficacy different - hence decision regulators approve age groups. people turn 65, vaccines stop working even immune response same. Well experts work animals already said plenty viruses like bats animals lingering waiting jump animal human. share concerns don’t think something like going repeat anytime soon. century event. trial finished week ago. They've full week unblind people. understand term 'Zero COVID' means? means zero covid. province Australia shut aweekend *1* case UK variant, variants expected always exist emerge. sustainable? No, vaccines save you. EU hemming hawing enough data approve AZD despite MHRA approved month ago. comical much fuss they're kicking vaccine even approved yet. everyone wait tenterhooks see EMA thinks sit doses. beginning outbreak, bit sympathetic less information transmission. Now, doesn’t seem like excuse all. 

But say, imagine told government a-ok, trying find sense peace that, realise it’s massive damn lie. Shocking way, stage, idea people ignoring countries lockdowns social distancing working well [archive link anyone trouble accessing article Yes, signed, I'm sure contract written conditions recognise earlier contracts also signed. Signing later contract (EU) cannot overrule already agreed UK contract.
AZ pretty clear give EU fixed/guaranteed date exact reason. EU dispute that, given evidence, I'm strongly leaning believe company lawyers considering every statement rather politicians conducting PR mitigation campaign.  know work want show work lower efficacy numbers. That's pretty clear... J j likely concern way. fact introducing live virus create immunity older people deal new immune system threats efficiently. Something like recombinant mRNA vaccine would work much better senior citizens that's like Pfizer mrna nvax Awesome news! Another vaccine one one shot know. US too. Sundays holidays low past Sunday pretty good. overall shortage deliveries approximately weekly, many places simply use shots give next shipment. places prioritizing second shots first shots run give second shots lower volume days.

But overall simply shortage vaccine. SII like 70 million doses stockpiled vaccine approved. SII producing vaccines faster rate government use currently.  People entitled reject vaccine think so. ""it feels like US vaccines available inject""

I think fine average person frustrated slow roll-out, really public's ignorance logistics incredible. Amazon others created illusion product travel manufacturer end user days/hours, really case. US distribution vaccine far perfect, 1 week inventory transit really indicator supply demand, that's anyone involved supply chain logistics would expect.... unfortunately that's headline people read.

As US helping Canada, per capita infection numbers reversed think would reasonable, US much worse place really position offer assistance anyone. media greatest source ferar mongering misinformation.

It fucking insane terrible scumbags are. efficacy data though.  people age 65 flu shot substantially less effective. Honestly regular dose starts becoming much less effective time upper 40s 50 even. Correct I’m wrong, wasn’t leader Brazil less helpful stopping spread country? Isn’t hoax fake cure rhetoric? 

I might thinking someone else, him, that’s people heaping scorn Brazilian leadership language like “hatched.” Yep headlines ""[something good] [something really bad]"". examples:

""U.S. Coronavirus Cases Falling, Variants Could Erase Progress""

""Covid Cases Fall 46 States, Biden Warns Death""

Other choice headlines:

""What never get better Covid-19""

""Why vaccines alone end pandemic""

""Variants threaten undo progress world nears 100 million cases""

Gee almost trying keep everyone state fear even data shows strong improvement. think NZ AUS leadership think they're sustainable indefinitely end time either. measures thus far prevented thousands lives, saving dozens different decision. Whataboutism MORONS

The 6 foot rule adequate really following either. AZ sold doses US too? missing doses gone to? EU genuinely made massive mistakes here. Pfizer AstraZeneca obviously made own, EU absolute shambles, countries like Serbia Romania vaccinating much quicker outside EU system make look even worse. They've come bureaucratic, misleading inefficient, way they're throwing companies bus publicly least half blame incredible. unblinding happen threshold reached. Even CEO see data. best happen hold announcement weekend get full week increased stocks. way Fauci could seen anything unblinded couple days public.

But good US leaned heavily Moderna well compared others. ""It safety/good"" often leads stuff nightmares. Well even 3 months, elderly jabbed stop hospitalised... can’t find recent numbers. Here’s CDC report October[cDC excess mortality estimated 299,028 excess deaths occurred late January October 3, 2020, 198,081 (66%) excess deaths attributed COVID-19. largest percentage increases seen among adults aged 25–44 years among Hispanic Latino persons. clicks tho Olympics without spectators?1st time happen school district went 100% online. son absent days (because sick school) asked us lot COVID-19 questions.

I think way be. 6"" thing giving teachers timer measure 15 minutes? think would realistically happen? airline analogy apt thing I’ve read while, sums feelings tee too! small concerts summer? Except majority vaccination, can’t spread rapidly decimate health system contracts signed well production started, dates. Adult vaccines anything kids, they're immune despite people want us believe. worry they'll expect everything ""normal"" school adults vaccinated. Even though I'm state, age range qualify Q3/Q4 school goes back anyway. protected teachers admins enough protect household, especially unknown percentage teachers admins refuse get vaccinated. 

I'm probably extra paranoid right I'm baby next 4 6 weeks, mine husband's combined parental leave run right around August schools go back. want forced sending 8 year old school district give us options, risking us including infant. 

I'm still worried long term effects virus bad symptoms sick -- lung problems, heart problems, cognition issues, CFS-like symptoms. things kids deserve forced rest lives they're mostly asymptomatic time illness. certainly better -1405-94,2 AZ currently show data. They're already suffering. 10 days ago lowest income countries used 25 doses total. gotta hope China Russia produce (and leftovers go them). Let's forget Chick Phil racist company years ago would allow black people work forced dress code center criticism racist.  that's true, Moderna Phizer authorized EU kids school no. Presumably protected parents course everyone's going get it. still think case that's going affect decisions made society whole. argument rate severe complications kids quite low apologies missed one, what's delivery rate moderna EU? Pfizer charging 6th dose reducing vaccine shipments accordingly better going trash. date. There’s 1 infection confidence interval -1405-94,2. 

Useless data point. think needs worked governments. EU convinced UK AZ vaccine relatively, redirecting shipments vaccines made EU EU makes sense (and mean EU citizens vaccinated faster). course hurt AZ, solves problem EU creating one UK. clearly argument governments company government. That's true, effectiveness (e.g. flu vaccine 40-60% effective) based much **reduces** risk infection. means compare vaccinated group unvaccinated group, case many people equivalent group Israel vaccinated got covid?


If disease 1/100 people get vaccine everyone still 1/100 people get disease efficiency 99% (which calculation method would indicate) efficiency 0% Peaks fall like herd immunity people get terrified deaths overwhelmed hospitals least try keep distance safe. Yep. 1 billion doses novavax probably hardly use. think we're going get eliminated world like 2023  far Middle East, Asia UK already probably read comments replying smug comments. 

I never said efficacy data age group. said data immune response, Phase 2 data released Lancet.

And since immune response same, definitely recommended adult age groups. South African trial already finished, Fauci probably already seen assume that's he's referencing. remember gets information general public does. says looks promising trust that. Two, third set tomorrow. banked big AstraZeneca said last week they'll able deliver 25% promised. thought CDC changed directives regarding masks 10 11 times now... first masks, wear mask, medical masks, cloth masks, ""neck gaiters"", two masks, we're back cloth masks.

In words, idea. current data preliminary, test younger people first ensure enough safety data start testing older population.

  ""The issue elderly data much whether works not. It´s today limited amount data older population. think program today run Oxford, Oxford program. Oxford academy group. They´re ethical, academic. didn´t want vaccinate older people accumulated lot safety data 18 55 group. said ethical vaccinate old people enough safety data younger people. companies took risk, went ahead vaccinated older people faster earlier. start earlier, data."" Moderna too. We'll 3 authorised tomorrow. that's vaccine even approved especially relevant point thread title. moderna one, timeframe doorknob licking? am.

Good you. made choice could live with, terms.

Surely understand neurologist-employer working relationship totally different teacher school district. 

Next time see 35 patients 8 hours enclosed space without full access medical grade masks cleaning, sure let us know. know two families lost multiple elderly relatives due Christmas meetup. People stupid. EU can't take doses UK, stop manufacturers exporting vaccines outside EU. US UK keeping supplies well receiving doses EU factories... can't fulfill orders outside EU, that's manufacturer. EU contract countries. actually true keep dose fixed? give people 65+ four times dose...  authorised one, one that's slowest make hardest store. immune response yes. immune response age groups. Ew. sound like awful human being. Virtual hug anything comes AZ always negative.

We seen multiple reports, since started testing monkeys, 100% people get Covid receiving AZ vaccine experience anything worse mild flu. basically cure severe symptoms/death get jabbed it.  can't life understand issue wearing masks I've studied human behavior adult life.

It's early politicized ""an assault freedoms"" and/or ""just first step taking away many freedoms,"" combined many people sowing seeds doubt effectiveness. people inclined believe entrenched belief system. ""Its findings limited look full set mutations found new South African variant.""

So good news yet Chineese Remnibi stronger Norwegian Krone!! article written got 200M additional mNRA shots. unpopular opinion agree. headlines ""The virus targets elderly health conditions caused 1000 deaths nursing homes today"" people would completely different perspective it.

The media seems going way way try portray Covid virus affects everyone equally. report rare cases young healthy people meanwhile never mention fact 80-90% illnesses people 65+ serious pre-existing health conditions. lock 85% low risk protect 15% high risk. im toxicologist , coworkers friends getting too, prove anything. far know last stock count shady alot vaccines missing. know health agents getting vaccines getting denied without logic reason, know why, stole  businessinsider.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Still cases skyrocketing despite lockdown vaccines. would cautious data... Correct, however, flu vaccine still effective age group, like efficacy falls cliff. reported efficacy data people Lancet paper. reason recommended age group.

You probably read paper yourself, writing smug comments. They're caught japanese exceptionalism foolishly thought countries would blindly believe well.

There million different things japan could done prove responsible enough host olympics none them.

They never tested enough, never shut borders, never enacted proper lockdown. ""state emergency"" bad joke, even among citizens. could fiercest proponents vaccine looks it, one last developed nation start vaccinations.

All follow NZ Australia's example test less purposely report lower numbers.

The third richest country world enough money bribes IOC can't buy tests vaccines? I've conversed people genuinely idea countries Europe bad America. can't really blame though, media pushing narrative America COVID wasteland anti-maskers anti-lockdowners uniquely American problem.

While things true America, also true countries well.

Ah well, really matter end. I'm glad live America people news critical really time/capacity point finger countries.  Scientific sources encouraged, think everyone subreddit, “*sigh*”, 70IQ you’re better condescending elsewhere. Petty maybe, vindictive.

Vindictive: “having showing strong unreasoning desire revenge.” Getting haircut shopping groceries instead ordering online would signal big improvement me! Oh, getting driver's license renewed, too. Eventually become like Spanish flu still exists threat anymore. also long land borders, super hard sneak across you’re determined enough. Australia’s island, it’s lot easier monitor travel out. What's significant it? paste highlights cannot access it? Thanks Yeah...get ready happens summer. scrapping entire second year summer isn’t happening. “There noise here” applicable nowhere science. think idea vaccines end restrictions make vaccines seem desirable people. hell people downvoting you? exactly right! part normalcy. split hairs wanna argue, things part lot people's lives. thought instances reinfection months initial bout disease. Or, uncommon? Theres probably little information asymptomatic kids lungs scanned someone feel anything wrong themself impetus go lungs scanned Yep. school district seeing increase teachers quarantined changed daily questions say exposure you’re near someone without mask fifteen minutes, we’re probably never going quarantined again. far, seems pretty rare. Lol chill homie twas joke vaccine plant India ablaze day two ago?  goes beyond health. political. global reputation EU line here.

The EU got hit hard virus. points time, worse numbers even trump America numbers.

So everyone's asking themselves: ""powerful"" nations EU ""amazing"" infrastructure getting demolished virus?

And now, seems going late vaccination race.

But raises questions: ""developed"" countries EU unable secure manufacture supply? left Belgians Dutch instead ""efficient"" Germans?

They desperate point. EU can't get vaccines time, countries recover much faster them. EU become increasingly less relevant world stage. Better efficacy, possibilty booster later (this possible AZ), efficacy mutated variants, clean phase 3 trial. would go mRNA vaccine. US price issue money. nothing pay vs opening economy. worth every penny deal AZ BS.

The US excluded AZ vaccine plan even mention anymore talking vaccination progress timelines. totally sidestepping mess AZ using platform superior every way considering controlling virus future case mutations pop needs booster reactivate immunity. worth money options. I’ll drink 🍺 scary. note summer Brazil. may smartest thing could done decade...

...just talk one neighbors; get VAX, welcome house anymore nobody knows yet VAX contagious... point? Saying ""end spring"" one day ""end summer"" long afterwards give hope. gives feeling someone's stringing us along, makes much harder trust anything that's claimed future. problem lost faith would normalcy kids even teachers vaccinated. Maybe years near future. 

As far sacrifices goes, knows, maybe better long term everyone. I’d prefer master problem anyway. I'm specialist I'll take word it, correlation amount antibodies vaccine procures degree efficacy?  Pfizer AZ faced delays delivered US UK respectively Q4 2020. nature rushed procurement manufacturing.

Furthermore, Pfizer set deliver **more** contractual obligations Q1 hundreds millions Q2, temporary delay weeks. good news bad news. EU acting mad Pfizer Pfizer set deliver obligation irrational populism set cover incompetency.

EU ordered AZ 3 months UK, they've overall spent 7 times less UK US per capita investing vaccine procurement manufacturing. 'surprised Pikachu face' delays happening. Sadly access either, would convenient somebody subscription could repost article. pretty sad significant events like hidden behind paywall. Same. I'm waiting high risk people essential workers get start looking getting mine. I'm doctor's office offer one I'd accept supply low. Otherwise I'm happy wait turn spring. Seems deadly also becoming toxic ... Well, mods scientists. Hit us best shot. Adjusting population, 670,000 deaths 1918 would equal 2.2 million deaths today, mention people killed young people. Yea going 4 days class missouri, social distancing etc. want school name called central high school I'm tired argument. child. need lied manipulated. cater do, those, frankly, screw people. expect voices authority honest me. aren't, longer authority. Oh man, excited you!!! Up. Middle school teacher Midwest here. twin students, boy exposed student tested positive quarantine, twin sister not, even though they’d spent weekend house unmasked. school said parents said he’d wear one outside room moving forward quarantine. 

I another come school days holiday break, find Wednesday brother positive high school, parents sent student assumed asymptomatic fine go school. 

It’s surprise tested positive 12/27 despite never going anywhere ever. can’t definitively prove got school, mean custodians weren’t actually wiping desks thanksgiving. know got it. kicker followed CDC guidelines quarantining kids, I’m still waiting hear covid leave covered. words, miss shelter place days people recognized teachers. I’m covid fodder. Stupid fucking idiots middle there... maybe whack-a-mole scenario many people feared...though knows abomination might evolve current strains... point really dispute efficiency vaccine (because clearly know population wide numbers) rather question specific instance could've happened. missing point. Nobody wants continue eat restaurant food living room. point is, OP wants get out, among people, social again. must confess cant find it, maybe Mandela effect. Golden beet kvass favorite drink. Normality means whatever could couple years ago.

If people choose maintain precautions companies decide cut fixed costs concern all.

No restrictions mandatory vaccines widely available. SAID

They say less two fold reduction ""Antibody titer levels"". different efficiency percentage. less two fold reduction antibody titer likely effect vaccine works.

What saying vaccine likely still 95% effective Yes, that's takes get people vaccinated it. I'm getting second turn health reasons, someone wanna go great, let's get needle them!  may wake Unicorn tomorrow. like ignoring oversized role viral load always played Covid cases. 'superspreader' became buzzword. Offered received? childhood vaccines approved yet portion adult population take it. That's extremely misleading! Please take down.

The study measured antibody titers blood vaccinated people controlled laboratory setting. actual efficacy contracting COVID wild, 94.5% number clinical trials references. completely apples-to-oranges comparison makes ZERO sense apply kind math to. Ok, time settle whatever new science guys read: 

Can person recovered covid transmit virus? Can't read article. severity among 10 infected? would make normalcy happen mind? Full stadiums normalcy. Large concerts normalcy. What's changed since last September choose go remote schooling? There's vaccine small percentage population had, infectious strains circulation. So, indicators time return school.

I think Inslee screwed up. moved teachers vaccination queue WA could vaccinated schools staff 1.5 weeks supply vaccine, but, instead, they're waiting 15 weeks behind giant cohort people 65  Scary, I'd [rather lean findings large rather anecdotal evidence one Swedish nursing home. inconceivable might've administered bad batch vaccine (either first second), besides, know vaccine trials better vaccine.

Also, OP, mind translating let us know cases symptomatic, so, whether serious? One things know sure almost approved vaccines highly effective reducing chances serious COVID. even domestic travel shows government serious stopping covid. Nah ""normalcy"" 2022. However we'll start see semblance starting late spring/early summer. fall could see things like concerts full stadiums sporting events, assuming enough people get vaccinated. We're going immediately see ""normalcy"" post vaccinations. take months economic recovery take years. everyone country visited offered vaccine. country like Iceland, likely occur summer. far off. UK sovereign nation oblige /s schools would still result reduction exposure people work home

so would closing daycares. I'm shocked. two friends professors prominent Boston colleges. 

They're actively lying students employees manipulating people going class. They've even upped enrollment there's people class used be. 

People wring hands wondering go bad. 

School. 

It got bad fucks sent everyone back tiny unventilated building. must one 19 mean may fair general point, Bill Gates particular anything philanthropic ensure forgotten. He's enough effect world would pretty known decades death even never bothered anything charitable.

It takes look legacy Steve Jobs similar comparison could hope for. agree vaccinated, arrange ""vaccination"" parties, care. throw caution wind vaccinated someone else quite selfish privileged. Pfizer temp lower production EU retooling one plants increase overall production hundreds millions vaccines 2021. set make delays end Q1 thus meeting contractual obligation.

EU complaining Pfizer bad faith augmenting. Pfizer set meet EU deadlines, increased manufacturing going massively favor EU Q2 forward.

Pfizer news good news, even hurts bit couple weeks. EU consumed populism, rationalism, leaders fighting shift blame massive failures late last week unveiled factory upgrade that’ll allow company Pfizer deliver ""significantly doses second quarter"" require short-term disruption supply.  manufacturing upgrade start boost output mid-February, BioNTech said, **leading deliveries first quarter “significantly second good news media platform determine real not. Nope. wish What’s rep? we'll eventually end air rabies, that's takes

Got winning lottery numbers? baller shit cant trust media today really compromised tend report biased towards certain wing society - next bloggers alike spreading “news” journalistic background often covered basics rewriting whats reported elsewhere “truthful” , got folks social media enrich opinions - really difficult days get sense truth What's wrong? sounds like pretty significant abnormality interesting know naturally is, never 100%. Well, eventually reach herd immunity either way. whole lot antivaxxer deaths. Problem solving skills actually liability consider lawsuits doctors face. might better ways people run set instructions rather creative. name checks someone please explain reported “CDC says” primary source disclaimer it’s official CDC position? Ah dang man sucks. Sorry trying diminish it, that’s disappointing situation sure. Good. upvoted ""Vogonian bureaucracy"" Thumbs up. means 96% efficient. saw article early said reimagine contamination OCD exposure therapy can't go like state. article therapist said treat patients making wipe apples floor bathroom sinks handles eating them......yeah no. Call pessimist, I’m starting accept convention I’m looking forward *November* good chance happening. Even restrictions complete theater point, lot big corporations probably won’t want risk it. Texas, would prefer neither. South African here. Looking forward country getting doses 2022!  main selective pressure immune escape, infectiousness. vaccinated population TINY. also town called Broken Bow know. It’s disheartening. Perfection become enemy good. One would think widespread re-hospitalizations would making news, rather illness numbers. can't go cases known reinfection, know happen regardless low rates new lineage thats circulating COURSE people are.

The 75% number subject LOT assumptions attacked likely inaccurate. 

An interesting intermediate possibility people already sick could getting infected noses way barely notice, passing people still naive. shut border one country... forgot 190 so. look happened that. Yeeees. I'mma make spot got shot at.

Today 14th day second shot. Dr. Fauci stated full effectiveness 14 days second shot iirc. zombie outbreak starts right, still go work vital supply chain. such, treated like essential American supply chain **provided best protections possible.**

Instead almost guarantee Wal-Mart, Target, etc. said here's shitty 1 layer cloth mask called day (maybe overtime pay, that's it). in: members LGBTQ+ community immediately eligible receive COVID vaccine Hungary. Business still, done, online I’m sure you’re getting either. nuances speak inconveniences, ironically mostly done away with, long time later have. consequences? right here. Nobody right tell work, try force work unsafe conditions. Anyone thinks fuck right off. Sorry dead man Texas Education Agency, oversee public education Texas. Great. lets get vaccines. think many teachers want teach pandemic, even given proper protections policies place make sense. extremely important question. think Trump shutting borders January.. timeframe fauci saying going cruise okay... think possible. Dunno tell man. say like good bad? ^ you’re real mvp kid online-only education fully immersive Mandarin program lol. Neither husband speak read language. Google translate goes far. Once, trying get translation ""kiwi fruit"" popped ""monkey peach"" funny, also bit defeating. said, never said going send kid back. even resigned disenrolling school compelled in-person learning. Nope. remember preschool years 1st grade, kid much older. kids going keep mask day, hell, many still pick nose eat boogers. adults kids live much better, probably less trustworthy. Going daily life like shopping work without mask vaccinated likely come months things cleaned enough start packing indoor venues big events Stop it. let one thing. bringing March? I’m talking January. I’m sure half people make US covid task force lobbying exactly this. even sure I’m joking.  looked ventilator model made sense. vent clearly meant short term use. 

Either someone fucked *real bad*, thought could get away it. good. Keep low efficiency vaccine there. work LE. calling first responders doses danger going waste. co-workers gotten vaccinations way. down-voters probably among precious little gang shaming early maskers Feb March. 

One reasons love family doctor much 1000% honest us kids, lets us know suggesting course treatment knows they're daycare (well, were) versus another treatment would look like (it's come twice). treats us like intelligent human beings capable understanding nuance. never go advice, given agency knowledge able make decisions part reason trust completely.

Fauci failed establishing basic trust favors continuing gloss it. Next up: US Canada  I'm still wondering people actually take shot tho... Japanese coworkers say take it. Madrid Spain.

And recall anything variant Spain. source? Yeah good point. think Americans already moved on, good see even people sub also prepared move point.  Ya except theyre ones wasting doses. adds up. don’t mean tourism. Places like NYC global hub international business. recall variants UK one fall. sources this? slippery slope vaccine IDs nice test market vaccine effectiveness... know one SA gotten vaccine yet hmmm? Well Mackenzie Aiden need school play sports! else gonna get partial scholarship Montclair State? I've amazed I've gotten older seen people went high school treat teachers. Like half fuckers barely got high school know teacher Masters's degree. fucking bonkers. Additionally, previously infected flu virus H N current one, likely seasonal flu, never one H N, rip harder spread easily. Virus already widespread circulation well March. cat way bag. thanks playing. say like really shine different light it. Enough money would really changed people's circumstances. Even simple means test would probably bumped significantly. Exactly! every time pick books semester “is coming back? It’s bad!” ....um yes is. Thanks. International tourism US actually quite small fraction GDP compared countries, again, I’m even sure you’re referring to. makes say that? I've heard Texas really close response looks like similar rate per capita despite California much larger densely populated cities. Unless value staying open more?

(Just genuine question, trying argue) Damn. mRNA awesome. 10 people cold too. going end hospital die it? know, point was, agree socialized medicine, wont fix problem. think people risk get vaccine first based age, job, race, comorbidities? take deep breath wear 8 masks. Safer better  Good explanation. Thanks! said anything fuckability?! I’m talking lack care future planet putting economy people’s health time. need young blood cant see people let NZ australia without quarantine populations vaccinated. 

We cases (well couple NZ..) would get least 50+ age group vaccinated quarantine travel doable. one good thing Trump complete lack leadership let state follow path. Washington state still distance learning. wondering state better states East us... say anything administrator told that? I’m wondering. know there’s much it’s job, whole situation put extremely unethical. ""Australian plant"" owned AstraZeneca. produced government owned Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. licensed vaccine. plant new either. producing flu vaccinations antivenom ages. UK signed May, EU signed August, that's 3 months. experience AZ gained setting UK enabled avoid issues optimise procedures came EU, enough overcome 3 months seems managed knock 2 months timetable.  Well, us want get vaccines get sooner then. Silver lining?  covid tested every week? Vertigo common symptom. guess would they’re passing contagion around (including covid, since it’s unlikely two doses completed week ago get full expected immunity) environmental exposure contaminant. got vaccinated manufacturing batch lot maybe something wrong it.

Do work place and/or hang together? working reasonable hours overworked exhausted? Two problems:

1. organization powerful enough meet exceed Government reach communication, standard held Government?
2. spirit rights created Bill Rights, general forward-thinking leadership, acknowledges reason enshrine things like ""Freedom Speech"" law *the absolute minimum standard way humans interact other.*

And point 2, fail constantly understand people maliciously officious think loopholes individual liberties simply they've found current panic temptation giving up. 

You think great thinkers throughout history came conclusions without considering time-specific equivalent we're discussing now? 

Do think time history one, absolute special one special came reason exception great thinkers throughout history, lauded ages, way smarter us living today could *possibly* comprehended? 

So no, spirit law ""it's following rules letter"". spirit law *that's way people thinking part society.* mostly hitting phones screaming Covid's manager. overthinking it. probably drink Tylenol too, huge care liver.... yet.... lots it. said shout told so. Read more. Surprise, surprise. That's already happening... I'm high school teacher teaching person classes since September started school person. SAFE. Since day one, I've worn full face respirator P100 filters. Luckily classroom microphone system, students gotten used impacted teaching ability form meaningful relationships kids. They're adaptable, sure. (Also, admin never said SHIT it, smart part, even though principal covid denier. prepared ask many fucking staff members think would taken get mask fuck around find out.)

I highly recommend looking something similar. use 3M model 6800. comfortable, love it, wonder actually saved life. Luckily, I'm receiving second Pfizer vaccine dose 20 days bring lot peace mind.

Staff members gotten sick, new covid case email alerts every. Single. Day. I'm exaggerating. students regularly quarantine. Thank Joe Biden 🙏 I'm saying wrong open schools. I'm saying justification stupid. Haha right? Super Barracuda spoken. 💯 first vaccine? teachers absolutely signed work public. one signed pandemic. matter job is, think anyone comfortable risk working pandemic make choice perhaps change jobs, even temporarily.  Please post scientific sources supporting conjecture. 2.6 million people die year USA. 7,100 per day. mourn deaths too? deaths tragic. Teachers always test answers UK large scale production simple designs planned, also production existing simple ""transport ventilator"" farmed factories (including parts made F1 team). 

It halted months believe found patients seriously ill enough need ventilation need modern advanced machine, putting something basically 1960s cause harm good. Also patients simple ventilator probably need much care modern one, lack trained staff much problem lack ventilators.

The scheme probably end investigated future enquiry, regards selection companies money spent. :( I'm sorry. talk hard family family live with.

Hugs you. Hopefully soon get real one. Makes sense, even today. county sent masks every house hold see everywhere. zero chance people washing them, hanging shifter wearing go store. mask months. That's actually valid point, definitely coming better names variants. Dude log out. Florida. Gov came said (teachers) nowhere near close getting it. Israel uses Pfizer, plus small amount Moderna (100k doses).

Pfizer probably supply enough vaccinate 16+ population. HIV spreads Nowhere Asia? chances person vaccinated transmit.

Is data back yet? dare /s Idealistically, I’d love nationwide strike, won’t happen. One, individual unions tied individual districts -- teachers even unions monolith. Needs requests different across board.

Two, get bodies. emergency situations license people bachelors degree felonies room. don’t care work decent teacher, getting warm body 25k-45k record unemployment easy. (25k broke areas, 45k rich areas country). 

Teachers aren’t starving. job suck, we’re starving put roof heads — albeit like 4 roommates sometimes. pay sucks compared jobs graduate degrees, long strikes mean zero income, potentially negative income lose pension license. that’s recent “successful” teacher strikes ended relatively small concessions. panic set \*hard\*. 

finally, rich parents might revolt, scabs decent skills go rich schools. true drain occur nearby poor districts, whose parents don’t energy knowledge fight sue.  likely get sick all.

It’s. Not. About. You. 

Infectious diseases community problem. get vaccinated still catch virus? You’re spreading community never vaccinated. fact, odds way higher you’re spreading variant escape vaccine. 

By means happy longer personally high risk. you’re still playing team sport like whole time. reading comments awful think numbers coming Florida less valid numbers coming anywhere else rest country. variant called P.1, emerged early December Manaus, Brazil, mid-January already caused massive resurgence cases across city 2 million people. ""If ask right now, what's concerning things I've heard far, fact reporting sudden increase cases Manaus, Brazil,"" virus expert Jeremy Luban University Massachusetts told NPR two weeks ago variant arrived United States. ""They kind major targets immune system,"" said virus expert Penny Moore National Institute Communicable Diseases South Africa University KwaZulu-Natal. needs treatment list. I've saying ""long term effects"" gaslighting antivax anyone touting antivax  people understand still need wear masks &amp; social distance vaccine, we'll good  think info have, people know risks, they're apt stay inside &amp; risk we've got 1 year minimum go

LOL maybe dystopian fantasy got production rates high enough begin stockpiling, time UK approved vaccine. 

Keep mind instant bottled clock starts ticking, total number AZ doses UK administered end 2020 0.53M. 

The UK currently bottling 150k doses day i.e. 1M week, majority UK vaccinations Pfizer, also mostly delivered EU approved it. We've also similar reductions delivery targets, supposed get 30M Pfizer end year, got 5M, instead 20M AZ doses got 4M. That's we're controversial delayed second dose. 

If UK received 40% promised years end we'd laughing, instead got 18%. 

AZ prioritising UK, contract UK stated return money AZ would develop UK supply chains UK facilities, two growth one bottling, initial output would go towards fulfilling UK's 100M order. unreasonable clause, production could go anywhere, including Europe. note makes claim EU facilities started months later. 

The UKs production rate Pfizer delivery rate barely enough keep vaccinating vulnerable groups, note say *all* vulnerable groups. that's first dose, stopped vaccinations today we'd still need 4-7M Pfizer second doses within next 2-3 months. 

You happy AZ going able achieve quantities fast are, full production rates taking couple months longer EUs unrealistic delivery timetable cause celebration. That's EU contract best effort, though odds getting full production date unlikely, even close vaccine always better none. someone explain narrative extreme lack supply clearly problem getting shots arms? States passing blame back federal government? teacher Florida, I'm jealous. COVID Australia though... really necessary good hand washer? really get it. fear catch transdermally? Yeah first case's husband even tested negative, definitely complacent definitely looking like might lucked yet again! I’ve wondering Kushner quiet site since election.  Here: several co workers vaccinated fine.

I also several co workers seen fine still refusing get vaccinated.

Some people stubborn conspiracy theorists. think government trying get them. One boss. suspect actually ""spending much time social media perception reality altered"" effect ;)

And I'm half joking that. implant false memories people's heads telling thing again. quite scary think it.

Anyway, here's Boris advisers talking delaying virus flattening curve start actually showing diagram policy work variety reasons, never planned let everyone get right away.

The assumption time (among *all* Western European leaders AFAIK) way stop majority population getting vaccines came out, flattening curve best anyone could do. get it. happened born American Texan, I’m speaking experience. didn’t choose that, like one else chooses born grew up. chosen travel many countries world, I’d never decide knew issues culture viewpoints one person met places. Yet happens lot Americans. Like said, it’s huge country millions people same. 

I’ve even read people sub past talking idiot Texans Covid spreaders anti-maskers summer (okay, first) peak. know spreading then? Poor Hispanic families live multigenerational homes living border option lockdown wanted survive. That’s kinda point. put Americans Texans box accurate. Americans government. aren’t portrayed media movies. It’s much complicated that. ""both V590 V591 generally well tolerated, immune responses inferior seen following natural infection reported SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines.""

You guys really like glossing natural infection part you. Good one! really tell 12 insult instead valid response. Nice! Cough Slavitt Yup. know people like that. ""It's big deal continue living restrictions!!,"" ""You're bad selfish person wanting wear mask die!!,"" etc.

I've given wedding. graduation ceremony. baby shower. Another family members graduation ceremony. husband's ability see first baby ultrasounds. son's first holiday season. first rice ceremony. chance practice real court first time program. I'm postpone wedding SECOND time, even know vendors let do.

I've worn masks everywhere. Sometimes even walks outside people get close. wore mask labor son. seen friends year. I've given LOT. Things can't get back. buy time creation vaccine. I'm high risk. Neither son, husband, anyone immediate family. 

But see people articles telling even vaccine goes vulnerable people, even I've vaccinated, keep practicing social distancing. keep wearing masks public. hug, kiss, even touch people outside bubble. frankly, made want give right now. Maybe selfish, I'm living like perpetuity. Especially I've watched idiots idiots full year, sacrificing nothing all, ending fine. 

I'm tired. I'm burnt out. want 2019 outlook back. want second chance last year. importantly, want end. vaccines end, is? Doesn’t seem gradual Fauci also said people wouldn’t use correctly (very true statement) would give people false sense security people would take risks wouldn’t (also true, even disagree covid risk consider).

Last flight took kept reminding people take masks eating put back on. *Actual* protocol would replace removed mask fresh one every single time. alas nobody that. Every time touch mask, fucking up.... Except not. people got second dose last week. soon expect full protection. shitty luck. doubt link something like I've heard kids teacher keep coats hats day, due open windows dead winter. realize solve problem. Instead wealthy donors would become prominent politicians people power. IDK what's point there?  talking about? third article January 12th. Alcohol makes puke! public service announcement. Folks surely wear masks ensure social distance! far 3 teachers district died administration threatened us disciplinary action close contact. don’t actually care contact, want punish us someone quarantine us left. dozen teachers school split classes. horrible. I’m sorry deal stupidity can’t even count valid Covid sick days paid for. Wasn’t already every country PPE withheld inside EU borders? TBH, I'm wondering got infected time received second dose. Ask yourself, think mask condition cleanliness conditions surgery?

And point, ask yourself, think everyone around maintain standard cleanliness times? 

And even that, ask yourself, think neurotic level cleanliness good productivity mental health? I'm sorry hear that. Early hours, double mask, get in/out fast help decrease risk though.. Glad country well. hope visit one day. 30 hours travel get home state. thought KN cheap pretty much useless Chinese ones? opposed good N95 ones? Correct I'm wrong. surprise all, time Biden administration step set people straight right. time frame September. Oh shit someone better tell trump They're probably morons hang /r/coronavirusuk think pandemic over. base allowing full high school classes regular hallway interactions...you're asking community spread way kids infecting one another passing infections adults within outside school. many kids certain age, hardly seeing friends year, gonna conduct conversations 6-10 feet away one another? Every time I've seen footage kids together schools (outside class) they're talking foot less away groups, crowds. masks force fields - particularly w/ new even infectious strands US. put past tories compulsory purchase vaccination manufacturing Oxford patents EU start trying road further. God knows almighty hell would unfold. failed parse, read again.  That’s really good point. 

A lot people saying “We’ll outdoor dining, drinking, hanging parks”. Yeah, that’s 2020 hope so. Homeschool private schools really best options going forward drags on. vaccinated absolutely correct. even disputable? Thank much appreciated! close getting""it"" Good you, u u stand ground should, im hairstylist cant make money without inches away people. opportunity id take it, think ridiculous home forced back potentially contagious environment. Idk many horror stories ive heard highschool teachers break outs kids listening restrictions countries sort results would also act fast unfortunately many slow make big changes beginning. 

Yep, Australia acted fast. went overseas 1 March 21 March. time left community transmission Australia. time returned borders closed non-residents isolate 2 weeks. Things moving fast 3 weeks. know that. fact, I'd much surprised disappear. We'll become better treating preventing covid, unlikely we'll eradicate it, especially since animals get it, too. you’ve initial variant, antibodies longer effective new variants? Don’t find ironic Vietnam’s economy booming don’t deal restrictions anymore? US could’ve easily implemented policies successful countries did, yet didn’t, pay price now. r/teachers could told since August Ok fine. maybe acknowledge really rare circumstances, anywhere near norm. mention teach safely from
Home; grocery workers can’t. It’s shouldn’t ask teachers leave safety home kids vaccinated.   mom teaching 3-4 year olds NY area person since think September.  uses 2 kn95 masks day face shield.  family we’ve talked various protocols donning whatnot. says despite fact works 3-4 year olds 100% mask distancing compliance. haven’t case community transfer yet school (it’s small small classes).  I’m really looking forward either vaccinated finishing year safe.  prepping go back like Eff you’re wearing freaking cloth mask. Well know that’s true Exactly, confusion ventilator specs types could safely used Covid patients.

Remember Elon Musk offering supply and/or build ventilators, turned right various hobbyists engineers developing countries coming 3d-printed otherwise jury-rigged ""ventilators"" hacks share ventilators patients. respiratory therapists said designs dangerous useless?

There lot fumbling around initially people good intentions.  feeling lie  fuck half? ..............and still greatest, richest country World!!!!!!! think everyone calm vaccine shortage abates new strains stay control That's really true.
A lot school admins shitheads, money. lot former teachers wanted career options. small towns, usually part powerful families, getting easy job keeping taxes low, etc.  go unremarkably focus Brazil variant Please CashApp $1 

$AL999999 mean I’m going back old ways lots stuff... saving lots time money way.

Businesses haven’t evolved going lose money.

Reality times changed. aren’t going “back” normal, we’re finding new normal.

Do really think people want get rid vote mail tradition normal? giving vaccine age applaud fact older people get vaccine first. virus one thing older people another thing young healthy people.  Sorry... first military industial complex?  Better lazy names like Portland Springfield v208 Wow must new here, CDC various models predict 5x actual infection rate, think everyone gets test, asymptotic people?, last April impossible get one?, believe wish, largely spring wished locked homes. Remember last summer cases dropped lot people went back normal, even though experts warning bad idea would lead second wave?

We’re getting ready exact thing summer experts trying hardest tell it. We’ll tools need end pandemic. doesn’t mean we’re guaranteed succeed. people giving shit get vaccinated (and plenty still capable acting vector virus) anti-vaxxers, third wave fall 100% possible fuck summer. think people willing miss another Summer. still strict ""lock downs"", point, fear would see violence streets. Anti-lock protests would get hand quickly. BLM protests U.S. Capital attack shows angry U.S. population now. Already begun Nope. adding doses thru Jan gives 30M Pfizer, another +30M moderna said 3 times already: test less people slow? literally said.

Testing japan pathetically low. verifiable fact.

Now use logic: going spend tests living dead? course living.

They testing dead bodies covid write pneumonia.

And fyi, japan horrible flu seasons. statistics ""respiratory deaths"" exceptionally high begin with.

So stop spreading misinformation based biases get context. welcome there's lot see here.
It utopia means stands well comparison places, summers difficult endure times spring autumn generally nice temperate areas, places 30 degrees latitude.
Meanwhile, stay safe look neighbours. know I’m random internet stranger, proud letting go working hard make positive change. need like you. well said. You’re bound culture, rules spirit United States is. We’ve embraced decentralized rule law, questioning government overstep mindset, pride economy health. may best people’s measures, it’s brand wear. 

Whether you’re Korea, NZ, Vietnam, Australia. There’s certain advantages never able implement. Stop playing game cheap points. live USA either. country even vaccinated 1 percent population. 

I responding poster's fearmongering. claim situation developed countries radically better october is, put plainly, kind fearmongering damaging people's mental health. think implies that: Without attempt prevent transmission allowed virus breed prolifically enough generations evolve something even successful virus terms. Exactly. Thank you. I'm object opening schools. I'm object opening without proper precautions. schools can't. want to, funding facilities make proper adjustments. Hospitalizations tend around 2-3 weeks; deaths four. think we’ll see continual, steady decline each. ah yes

the nutritionist turned covid expert baseless points zero facts.

Although leaps illogical point, illogical point hilarious read.

It became issue Melbourne 1. breached hotel quarantine returning traveller, 2. relatively new time people weren’t taking issue seriously needed to.

It’s temperature, geography, population density saved Australia, New Zealand etc. it’s people rallied together community necessary save lives. Lockdowns, masks, social distancing. 

It sucks, works, yet countries still refuse acknowledge truth instill half measures nothing slow death, muh freedumb. what’s fascinating also scary think global climate change. somewhere there, animal plant cure cancer dying due changing climate. could US done same? really need list blunders made past year states living rock? curious - would potential adverse consequences someone received vaccines (Pfizer Moderna) due interaction vaccine components? Pretty funny thought exact thing. People hard time changing eating habits last couple days weeks. happens. Somehow entire world expected change overnight anyone follow measures lock step shamed blamed. Really happy USA :) wish Latinamerica quickly too... Unfortunately, things getting worse day day... let alone premium vaccines given majority people. WFH office workers record unemployment, probably think. Man brought back memories January/February anxiety last year, fun time. 

Obviously virus turned horribly, stuff would read subs time insane (like 4Chan post lol). also another one supposedly Chinese doctor said people getting instantly reinfected dying. 10-4 got I’ve seen even myself. Everyone pissed, burned out, angry, depressed. 

On top restrictions everything else completely drains hope body, seeing everyone angry hating ridiculous extent making absolutely dread future. problem it’s getting worse worse. Yeah Democrats want open everything up. Make like Biden fixing everyone. Well dumb asses. one shots yet different two months ago. don’t get governors now. least wait till teachers staff shots. sue school district. people die handled. Thanks China!!  Got second dose day.. looking forward future. Hole E fuck. I’m respiratory therapist look ventilator. worked New York first wave use mostly transport ventilators patients barely provided support needed. ventilators 70 million contract fucking joke. meant extremely short term emergency use get pt definitive care site. can’t fucking believe anyone would thought would work covid patients. Okay sure *concern* every fucking time new one pops it’s gonna cycle now. Christ. latter article os dated one cited. Seems like damage control due political pressure. Still, where's raw data people decide themselves?  blow brains kills instead nut job shit like this? I'm growing suspicious people may contracted covid may sevier mental decline side effect. parents go jump cliff. get empathize ones terrified may lose job therefore income, home, healthcare. knowingly expose sick kids kids adults, tell parents to, unconscionable me. also parent. Americas' America's You’re forgetting infectious stuff is, survive left long-term damage.  mom says felt same, im 23 dealing long hauler symptoms. Hoping torn throat doesnt come back, ive concede taking aspirin twice day. also recently redeveloped intense stomach cramps. Amd boyfriend dealt except hes gotten crazy nausea. hope doesnt alter lives fof long haul Selfish parents 

It's always selfishness. Employers frown upon taking work, especially one day. child might sick several days parent simply cannot take much time without fear reprimand fired. Others sick time paid missed days. money tight, choices made best worker child.  Hold minute, you’re telling kids getting sick forced back school middle Global Pandemic? don’t buy it, blame Liberals. I’m supposed see rescheduled Billy Joel concert April. don’t want get hopes up. either producing EU prior signing EU 3 months behind. Pick one. can't both. China Japan much better year. Achtung.  Vee haff vays making ship vaccine.  Remember Lusitania.  

/sarcasm (I hope) fact downvoted insane me. 

It’s downvoted us want actually end pandemic summer go back normal. Telling everyone throw caution wind first chance get guarantees you’re going drag longer needs be. anti-vaxxers could even risking third wave fall. Let's give teachers REAL MASKS. know proper respiratory protection, fear go away. protected well family(which certain vax.) Masks always answer, right masks(n95/kf94/ real kn95). A: Unions
B: already shortage teachers Chicago barely anyone cover vacancy. 

This dumb thought take Someone let Dr. Osterholm know. story microcosm US's pandemic response: try hard good job week, cave anti-science demands eventually go painful series starts-and-stops things go bad worse. Y’all lucky! felt like warm ass 10 hours second shot. crowdsurfing second finish 2 week mark second shot.

Please continue wear mask social distance. may still transmit virus others. Sad isn’t it? incredibly frustrating. want over, can’t ignore pretend like something isn’t there’s news data stating something negative saying. KNEW. Except hit America, changed tune kept saying, 

""If known earlier!"" 

""If China told us earlier!""

""If knew severity!""

What saying talking BS watched videos saying way earlier bad, coming America. warned us changed tune later.  Kf94 made Korea pretty comfy, lots fake ones, careful . think what’s going Astra Zeneca vaccine EU shit show wait one released (assuming efficacy good). Hell they’re smart probably know works taking last couple weeks figure release news. 

Media needs weekend update “end pandemic” “back normal” “vaccines won’t end pandemic alone” stories.

Bold prediction: Merck said they’re covid vaccine game. Merck steps manufacturers J&amp;J vaccine. makes business sense makes perfect public relations sense. many per 128k got without shot? 85% would like 6 layers like free one Hong Kong government give people? good point, certainly could one outcomes.  High school senior here. Losing fun senior year effectively doubling negatives maddening say least end day isn’t goal? mean sickness end stops fatal continue daily lives case, wealthy communities high rates immunization poor communities lots rates immunization. Reopening lead disproportionately high death rates poor communities. Nah, that’s saying 90% people neutralizing antibodies certain amount time. doesn’t mean it’s 90% effective preventing disease, efficacy we’re waiting edge for, it’s really good making body respond it. almost exactly experience high school Tennessee Huh, you’re Palestinian, aren’t speaking PA, apparently taking money Palestinians health care isn’t actually providing health care. They’re engaging massive disinformation campaign, claiming they’re buying vaccines administering them. 

Don’t feel it’s duty speak this?

We’re deadly pandemic, and, according you, PA completely lying vaccinating people it. 

And you’re completely okay that.

WTF. There's telling kind trump/kushner-lead nefarious grifty shit going turn up. 5 years masks SD unreasonable unacceptable matter bad COVID gets. would represent failure science restore society way be. 
Might well mercy kill music, entertainment travel industries tell kids today won’t childhood. Forget there's verification system place better handwritten card.  There’s rumors TX even teacher tests positive feeling ok asking still come due substitutes available. also allowing students teachers schools showing symptoms exposed waiting test results. Well, university, ""some organization""...that's point. That's neutralizing ab

What's that? Yea it’ll interesting go back. normal class typically two four students high needs behaviorally. It’s impossible keep safe bodies normal year it’ll interesting see that’s handled Feels good know people charge preparing eventuality rather guessing spreading misinformation. agree. initial nonsense saying proof transmission air need mask use insane. People latched months afterwards even dis-proven. can't believe told public information scientific data back up. 'sent' UK, UK ones produced UK EU ones produced EU.

The production EU started earlier UK production millions AZ doses send EU UK government’s vaccines task force acknowledged Monday 4m doses vaccine developed Oxford university AstraZeneca would delivered year, *imported Netherlands Germany.* Earlier year, task force said envisaged production 30m doses UK probably combination. virus able latch cells better probably allows move faster, damage, inflammation, quickly before. immune system cant keep up, goes overdrive, additional damage. work airline. wish could true me. Lol take long I've saying since last April. easy nervous new vaccine far-off thing. lot different actually get start make things normal again. probably talking Biontech  believe everything Fauci says. also said 60% another time. Pittsburgh too. I'm glad drinking something, would spit out.

Terrible title, great troll. Nothing worry about. Biden going solve problems. /s think like, ""hard justify making mandatory there's still limited supply easily available flu shot, enforce policy"" makes sense! Fire them. states fine people school true. british Hitler dog thing pissed off. 16 days late, sorry, think load baloney. say think whatever want, can’t control people react ideas, resistive pushback often misinterpreted “cEnSoRsHiP.” Honestly, I’m even certain arrived topic tolerance nothing said predicated notions. suspect political lens view world might something it. blame powers want, point, social irresponsibility entity that’s pointed fingers at. present challenge, though. exactly “social irresponsibly”? It’s much much easier blame governmental institution frankly, social irresponsibility, encompasses society large. doubt us go neighbor’s house wag fingers shame idiotic choices.  georgia school I'm requires students staff members wear masks. exceptions. gathering etc. Yea sure next damn post fear feaaaar spot summer months chart?
Because Okay sometimes bad long-lasting side effects even don’t die it. 30 yrs old healthy really don’t want get it. did, last sentence.

To elaborate that, people like Newsom, Cuomo (until recently), Whitmer, Hogan, etc. trying open draconian long open quick make cases go even higher, well new variants Europe migrating resistant current vaccines resistant previous immunities COVID. End april educated guess going hold big event need plan months year+ advance, well put nonrefundable money down. Many people decide hold event anything less 100% chance hold it. cancel they'd lose money people calling fired wasting money. win situation still one important thing going us United States - still _free_ (for part). 

Whereas UK, example, arrested put stickers ""wrong"" text them. 

The United States far perfect, still one best places, people worldwide recognize - many people still want come USA. tell mail-order Purell really Purell? You’re assuming half staying home .... people living lives also last people know want it. It’s ridiculous. seasonal UK Europe.
Of course people usually outside summer much air-conditioned know directly friend whose teenager covid schools least Texas discouraging people getting tested. I've heard similar stories well others second hand. There's way I'll trust school administrators anymore. country December early January, even something people worried about. Right... also airport, full control export imported products, full control borders, water, etc. Palestinian government much control territories, Israel always cities villages? would considered invasion everywhere else. Go better student spread hasbara somewhere else tricks lies work Palestinian-Israeli like myself. ;) Lol one! yes, people living normal probably gotten it. many, many Americans taking precautions living lockdown gotten it. close borders... Lol amazing people think simple task eradicate Covid. 

What 3rd world countries run Dictators make Trump look competent caring? think they'll lock everyone inside? Russia? Brazil? 

Covid destined become endemic. There's simple ""just XYZ another month"" solution. Hilarious suggest otherwise two late orders, would generally try fulfill one waiting months longer.

Not really. situation business would need make decision client valuable overall liability attached client would prepared lose least liability possible. Liability exposure would important aspect decision. Pfft, call pleb? I'm currently drafting bill make procedure mandatory air travel entire logic arguing COVID spreading schools immediately contradicted people want reopen schools. 

""COVID spreading schools kids getting sick.""

Meanwhile....

""We reopen schools there's child vaccine kids get sick.""

If kids getting sick, know spreading schools? Infection rates teachers rising.

They want sacrifice us wealth. They're falsifying data. already forgotten Trump literally ordered CDC falsify data? forgotten Rebekah Jones home raided trumped charges willing speak truth? I’ve seen similar situations play countless times school too. It’s frustrating. admin says school spread super low!!! Yay!! Yes, also number gained immunity naturally infection. Florida 30th cases per 1M 26th deaths per 1M. They’re literally average among US states better lot states lot stricter restrictions. idea you’re talking spout BS media narratives vaccination numbers going explode anyone wants one get one. many people eligible right choosing get wait. He’s saying everyone access vaccine end summer, everyone vaccinated end summer. Even Dr. Fauci said return resemblance normalcy late fall assuming enough get vaccinated antibody tests notoriously inaccurate. estimating reason morality spreads quicker stronger ACE2 receptors. Meaning immune system going drastically higher immune response previously. It’s like sending 100 compared 10. Higher viral load it.  mandatory schoolchildren, like China. think argument teachers aren’t higher risk people work professions interact people. example, work homeless shelter. used work restaurant. high risk jobs right now. Look happened meat packing plants. 

No one denying virus spread schools, science doesn’t really support idea it’s somehow worse buildings teachers higher risk people working public. school district actually NY; everyone else hasn't. Notice alot CDC studies tend target NY schools.  drew terse response AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said EU late strike supply contract company enough time iron production problems vaccine factory run partner Belgium. “I think need make sure vaccine supply bought paid for, procured UK, delivered,” Minister Cabinet Office Michael Gove told LBC Radio. EU failed make breakthrough crisis talks AstraZeneca Wednesday demanded drugmaker spell would supply bloc reserved doses COVID-19 vaccine plants Europe Britain. That's people's minds work. Even feel comfortable getting vaccine know people gotten it, despite empirical data enough get begin with. completely irrational, fundamentally human thing, unfortunately.

Countless psychological studies shown human beings irrational reason used post-hoc rationalization emotional choices we've already made. Reason designed evolution influence convince others, find objective reality. Reason like press secretary judge.

 
The whole reason even need science begin even rational human beings still fundamentally biased.

EU blaming AZ potentially signed incompatible contracts. blaming UK. 

[From nutshell, EU officials furious AstraZeneca. say contract pharmaceutical giant clearly stipulates two main vaccine production factories UK classed primary manufacturing sites, production sites Belgium Netherlands secondary fact, EU officials point EU money went upgrading facilities UK fully expected operational them. turned deeply unpleasant row, sets stage difficult meeting UK-Swedish company. single dose vaccine company 2 names. 

Coincidence? think not. astounding AstraZeneca media managed turn EU VS UK fight. Sure, EU free blame (far from), fact remains Astrazeneca overpromised something could deliver without even giving notice week ago. mentioning least seems contradictories EU VS UK contract (EU: factories UK used supply, UK: cannot.), although hard confirm without actual seeing contracts. 
If would communicated issues clearly real-time, least mitigation plans could set companies get back schedule Q2. Pfizer also delays EU, least announced solved 2 weeks notice. Astrazeneca chose start giving warnings week advance, people suprised EU demanding explanations? That's way always been, though.

I think people salty lockdowns, masks, vaccines, people advised make best possible choices first foremost stop worrying anyone else doing. 

The idea people outsource safety literally *everyone else vicinity circumstance give solid damn them* great big red flag here.

The fact matter is, can't imbue virtue onto people personal bottom line threatened. *lot* people, bottom line making sure families fed, sheltered generally safe. 

I always said: want lock down, that's fine. want wear mask, fantastic. want vaccine, roll it. put society notice ""bad people"" (because that's really ""selfish"" meant imply) thing want think keep safe (and real talk, full lockdown practically impossible, masks advertised - especially according mask manufacturers, vaccine moved along little fast lot people's comfort), thing causing want around drama-queening ass. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

The important flatten nose wire reshape comes less point, hugs nose, lies flat face. also use silicone strap make fit bit tighter earloops themselves. 

I'm sure perfect, compared putting mask pinching wire nose, seems much secure.  Again, agree assessment. really want demolish argument feel like thinking wrong headed, I'm really sure where...

Who going work kids less pay teachers? think possible get enough bodies without dipping pool convicted felons.

If teachers show enough solidarity strike statewide, can't continue private schools trip put even babysitter front 30 kids? Parents would revolt kids become victims neglect worse schools. Schools would get sued kids harmed.

I'd like see teachers nurses stage national strike bring country full stop.

In addition, people receive vaccines begin behave protected - 60% protection COVID-19, resulting spike risky behavior could cause significant short term spread occur.

Taking AZ vaccine questionable effectiveness risk-free decision.

All also doesn’t take account primary bottleneck US currently last mile distribution capacity, supply. Lol yesterday wasn’t even contemplated Reading tiktok comments posts vaccines good everyone get sad.

I actually saw someone say already got flu vaccine dont need Covid vaccine. say week deliver? parties fail here. acceptable swindled either EU claims has. Trust good, control better. EU physically taken control produced vaccines EU facilities. discuss now. That’s put ‘draconian’ qualifier there. lockdown basically amounted “you can’t eat indoors we’d appreciate didn’t indoor gatherings home”. Still allowed in-store shopping, non-essential businesses allowed stay open, curfews, meaningful restrictions outdoor congregation, fines individuals, restrictions movement, etc. etc. etc. think they’re coming around fact real clock they’re racing covid exhaustion. get done give people hope.

Meh. much - hard feelings ok? annoyed ""Fuck"" poster got down-voted one-word reaction even sorta overkill. read freak omg everyone forever afraid COVID even vaccinated. good.

Stop pedaling bullshit dangerous ideas feel like there's massive negligence around kids virus tend milder symptoms. still know long term effects virus, medium term already looking pretty bad. could condemning kids (and teachers) lifetime medical problems.

And number people I've seen person acting like think kids can't *spread* virus astounding. Parents properly masked letting 8 year old run around train/store/laundromat/wherever unmasked breathing everyone. Yes. Go weird time (early later night) safe humanly possible.

I’m surprised tbh.

If asked June July think winter would like, would’ve predicted we’d second lockdown Thanksgiving Sounds like it’s clever vaccinate younger people AZ then. hand think people working STIKO smart enough take account Wonder Bc according close contact infected person. knew TEACHER maybe she'd felt differently approve message!

Good luck yours. Bloody marvellous! could better bringing might Japanese industry bear vaccinating world? Yes it’s black white say, large centres tend give Pfizer (easier refrigerate etc) many old people would go somewhere locally. fact is, lot Oxford vaccine available Pfizer moment. US UK keeping supplies well receiving doses EU factories

How many doses US received EU factories? Source? news articles far saying vaccine provisionally blocked 65s, approved others. apparently read book?   haven't, strongly recommend it.  
 
If still think that, given new double mask thing, well guess different thoughts.  make think Catch-22. think necessarily true hospital get funded one way another. Plenty hospitals closed past decade. Experts: need stricter lockdowns

Anti-lockdown protesters brigading Reddit: NOoooo, can't stay locked forever!!!! wanna go back bar nooo!!!!!! think did, balance, considering everyone said would happen them. Maybe well Norway certainly better rest Europe. think often keeping things open seen bad thing itself, like toeing line showing solidarity countries did. 6 pm curfew insane, 8 pm one, worse Rent free still? fact relies several assumptions bearing out. Number one cases rapid decline US right throughout almost entire country first time entire pandemic. Number two vulnerables vaccinated strain dominant. big nothing burger US. Can't say elsewhere. We'll done best job world vaccination campaign besides maybe Israel little faith Blue Shied experiences insurer, honestly anything point better local government. really. expected that, although X-ray tech contact many known positive patients, knows many maybe don’t know it. 

I feel like people known showed pretty severe symptoms. concern mine doubt young kids nurse wife also contact known positives. Promising news shows SA UK variants mostly covered Pfizer Moderna shots. least we’ve got going us, nice. Sarah? said another comment, I'll dammed endured really shitty year careful wimp wanna anymore. juvenile diabetic husband probably made feel important. He's fully vaccinated (healthcare worker) choices son. I'd love send son back school, k-5 district allows face shield instead mask keep going hybrid (2 days week) full time. never public school classroom large enough full class actually socially distanced. So, time make sure he's staying task 100% virtual math class... US two big advantages terms vaccine campaign compared countries right now. Number one we've really high percentage people who've actually virus probably 25% states high 40-45. Number two we're beginning vaccination large scale cases coming own. long short keep cases low 50% Americans protected either infection vaccination good really begin opening worry anymore Meeeh keep reading UK variant become dominant variant US within next several weeks. it’ll get control real diminishing numbers begin show IIRC guys already ordered 1.5 million doses AZ india also getting doses covax. get doses year yh still long way acquiring enough doses entire population. awesome.

We seeing historical scientific breakthrough live.

Now need control situation variants, current ones possible futures, Way...  EU exporting vaccines. Vaccine producers might. fact vaccine produced EU make property EU. Thanks man. Yeah 75+ nearing 2nd dose portion here, good far. absolutely will. logical reason think otherwise. write articles Bild? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think agreement AZ manufacture vaccines locally. IIRC ordered 1.5 million doses AZ india spend lot days ping ponging. I’ve learned pandemic I’m quite introvert thought was. can’t wait trapped house anymore actually go movies random spontaneous trips. moment though mental health kind toilet there’s whole lot except hold on. It’s getting really hard, I’m trying I'm entitled oblivious like you. quite sickening fair. Yeah I’m happy balance states right now. Everything open part, it’s open safely. I’m glad I’m UK much EU endless rolling lockdowns. 3PM controlled explosion took place suspect item. 
 
Can robot open package!? wanted know it. Depends vaccine we're talking about. would rather take chances covid take russian/chinese vaccines. Firstly nobody got AZ vaccine died COVID. That's goal. 100% cases prevents infection serious enough cause death.

Secondly can't directly compare efficacy AZ thorough. tested regularly asymptomatic infections, whereas Pfizer didn't. Yeah pregnancy fucks immune system it’s major flux (sometimes enhanced protect, sometimes suppressed reject pregnancy) later pregnancy also physical effects like squishing organs (if COVID 19 struggling breathe, losing space diaphragm lungs move freely likely help). Without germans Pfizer vaccine either. Biontech developed it. doses vaccine UK receives manufactured EU. That's moving, much Pfizer pay write that? It’s still going look embarrassing don’t get anything. way everyone annoyed. 

It would better everyone act like adults ask cooperation. didn’t humanitarian pity. equal trade agreement. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Oh, minor caveat - included teachers asymptomatic school home COVID.

Lies, damned lies statistics u/InvisibleRegrets different user me. Whether like way said it, share sentiment wish people won’t rush resuming normal activity personal vaccinations.

We looking forward hugging family. don’t want separated later public spreading mutated version virus next months best bet strangling all. 6% figure bullshit confidence interval huge. know. won’t be. government can’t tell wear. want mask rest life power don’t force everyone else too. rambling about? first shipment AZ 17 million doses EU February 7th vaccine rolled 18-64 year olds following days (assuming EMA Germans tomorrow) Someone must asked question? didn’t watch briefing. course are. EU ban export vaccines. nothing other. AZ/Oxford yet shown data vaccine effective 65 year olds. may change soon EMA might even data already, it’s logical give demographics proven work in. *Especially* since we’re getting much People don’t think virus affects everyone equally think virus “doesn’t discriminate.” absolutely fucking does. amount articles permanent complications (which proven it’s less fucking year) nuts preliminary review data. That's desired outcome course enough data suspect time make conclusions. information tells us 128,000 fully vaccinated individuals, 20 contracted illness 1 week. reference, current infection rate Israel 520/100,000 Covid Science sub, cast doubt question epidemiological data correct identifying strain virulent first place. could human behavioural factors play super spreader events founder suppose time time could well one may confounding try explain people actual evidence variants contagious look like I'm stupid main stream media told pandemic clearly exposed general lack scientific understanding planetary day data comes suggest variant caused change vaccination schedule actually contagious, British government comes says may hard time reconciling that. Especially considering went spike strained healthcare facilities, lead worse care reasonably causes take face value, especially government that, aside sequencing, abysmal track record virus.  much hate masks actually like wearing give sense anonymity worry people looking everyone's wearing mask people fully know look like.

But yeah going weird going back people really wearing see immunogenetic data well though. 


Immunogenetic data jab shows antibody levels similar lower age groups. Gee don’t know it’s dystopian Orwellian see eyes public real interaction people see emotion. believe back normal nonsense fall. going early mid-summer. vulnerables opportunity vaccinated early mid March. happens open season things get back normal within 2 3 months Honestly isn’t covid news, it’s political headline loosely related covid. found instead mil, fil, bil's family, second bil's family would joining Thanksgiving in-laws'. second bil wife reckless means, work public-facing retail. sil pregnant. less 48 hours go, managed put together first Thanksgiving dinner household. 

We allowed mil fil Christmas brunch visited anyone else couple weeks. would go stay bil weekend, wait two weeks, another weekend another's. also close call retail-facing sil tested positive 3 days visited. Luckily, one else caught it. 

It's tiring tell people gone really shitty year tried hard careful blow I'm tired trying. Fuck shit! That's easy way dire consequences. husband juvenile diabetes I'll damned something stupid endangers him. thing is, explicitly anti-lockdown March. convinced, even airing concerns totally unacceptable would lead kinds abuse. groupthink insane. I've tried remain unbiased objective despite backed corner, easy. screw up? reality vaccine trials enough participants draw strong conclusions small age ranges.

CIs also large Pfizer/Moderna vaccines older age ranges. enough data. know US-centric point view, man wild reading people talk lockdowns America like China military barring people leaving houses.

My state pretty far left things think I'm legally prevented going large indoor gathering like concert.

There things *want* do, one stopping going bar, restaurant, gym, small business store downtown, etc.

Wearing mask fun, especially getting vaccinated, I'm pretty confident we'll see rules relaxed see sustained drop hospitalizations. think serious... video increase overall weekly vaccination distributions states, tribes, territories 8.6m doses 10 **starting next week**

So no, week 10 million. week 8.6 million.

You want zoom this? I'm sorry extremely confused numbers trying make be. That's true. 


Pfizer jabs also given elderly AZ healthcare workers. entirely random. 


There bias towards Pfizer given large centres though easier jab due storage requirements. whole lot antivaxxer deaths.

It'll whole lot deaths. It’s likely won’t worry Israel lockdown.  Everyone’s supposed stay home.  matched group unvaccinated people 6,437 caught it. you’re comparing 6,437 cases 31 cases.

Reads like matched age health status. guess could say matching missed something - occupation suburb compliance lockdown rules something.  

But difference 6,437 31 absolutely huge. mismatch groups might account percent, wouldn’t give massive difference like that. meant say like May vaccine available everyone. Believe want gone too. everyone obsessed wearing mask? big Deal? society can't even muster wear mask protect lives others, doomed fail. learned art absolutely shame yet. Australian politicians always seems lag years behind America. Give time. really think you’re first person who’s thought hasn’t researched? EU: Disclose contract!

Also EU: disclose bit! dont wanna asshole. inform vaccines, know long term damages thing.

If side effects visible first days weeks injection. makes sense think longer time.

But mentality literally killing people.. help defend it. this. going accept repeat living like henceforth. Starting look way. 

*fingers crossed* getting stats ? TX = cases -12%

* CA = cases -37%

* IL = cases -13%

The 7-day average right somewhere around 159,000 new cases per day. 

That's probably ""holiday spike"" we're seeing chart ?... 

""slowing"" nice applaud that. people allow become complacent. increasing vaccinations, fighting chance now.. people need keep isolating masking distancing.  I'm favor big institutions deciding public best public know about. approved Hey wanted say thanks making optimistic thread. pandemic hard many people, think everyone different story tell. I'm glad place rational discussions without hearing old stories.

I'm freshman college, really hope next years life worry social distancing wearing mask. people saying might worries lot. stop manufacturers exporting vaccines outside EU

So UK bought Pfizer doses, stop exports, taking doses UK. Barely. case case ""we really enough data"". Thing though kids generally low risk anyway. many go hospital end dying. main reason schools shut teachers risk course kids passing covid onto vulnerable. we've got majority adult population vaccinated major deal since adults protected point developing severe symptoms going hospital. covid low risk then. pfizer authorised 16+ still vaccinate seniors high school. contrary. Updating one's map match territory immesne benefit everyone. Decisions made due status quo bias killed hundreds thousands Americans pandemic. Plenty people aged 18-64 desperately need vaccine. course EU expects contract fulfilled. good chance litigation. see wins. much surprise. Yeah, almost makes wish set aside small amount doses mega rich bid on. use money Covid relief funds helping people pay hospital bills. doubt rich assholes would pay cool million get vaccine early Wearing mask basic courtesy essential workers know vaccinated forced experience additional anxiety they're surrounded countless idiots day would throw meat grinder someone whispered ear would increase fReEdOmS. Near normal, near 3rd world death rates. always happens, one stupid MP government associate says something ridiculous people take word important official statement going see effects vaccines second week February Well done!!!!

Best feeling ever wake 2 weeks second shot. 😯😳😳😳 thought important EU countries start vaccinating people time show solidarity vaccines quickly. EU citizen living US, go hell. vaccines going available late summer, guy wrong. Oh? must missed that, time skim papers, where's ref that? Huh??? comment attracting weirdos lmao later contract 3rd party can't overrule that, would breach first contract.

That's AZ's problem then. I've custom molded hard plastic one (for grinding caused GAD) nearly decade. always relatively good shape chewed straight first three months pandemic.  someone help find site see linked time? black background, says ""if continue current rate, fully vaccinated x"". Last time checked November. I'm talking different one. That’s bit bold, I’d say closer Fall like September October, especially 2 dose vaccines Anyone reading reported expected effectiveness different vaccines? Teachers work hours professionals, complete myth. 
 
This true discount non-instructional hours. Teachers work far hours average ""professional"" paid far less. Teachers make poverty wages. fact, teachers paid median household income Chicago. 

Chicago one thepaid districts entire country, still money making career. Starting [teacher pay around $30-$40k per year. *literally* less half expected jobs require master's degree.
 Day care workers criminally underpaid, somehow got facts completely backwards. 
 
Day care workers generally education requirements country legally restricted ratio 1 worker ~10 kids. teachers country responsible 25 kids classroom, equivalent pay would 2.5 times daycare worker. Instead, generally tax bracket unless job years.
 Education one important things governments provide society, fact people willing abandon criminal.  

So go advocate teachers vaccinated first. Maybe consider sending deaths. certainly regret future since already dramatic shortage teachers. Maybe really think education important, could even advocate paying people job way matches claim. consolation, death toll probably higher 21st. took shady article obscure finance newspaper trashiest tabloid Germany sub fall ""8% efficiency"" fake news. reputation matters? incorrect. lung damage seen young people prior health issues. UK 100% innocent too. dispute EU private company. Ah official denial happens Free lol 11 yr old daughter positive result, minute clinic CVS. lady called tell results, said used call kids' schools inform theres positive case, said doesbt really anymore. said could call wanted really (almost implying ""dont bother""). 

What didnt know Ive daughter cyber school school district refuses limit physical attendance way... district covid 
numbers ""are low"". Free lol I’m never going see vaccine anytime soon. going go straight BEE rest sold illegally. 78% America living paycheck paycheck 77% Americans consider surprise $1000 expense severe financial hardship either pay would borrow money for.

Your baseline survival is... well really baseline. Yeah they're embarassed UK well bad estimate. trajectory we're going, could hit around 600k spring even though gets much better gone gone. one seems judging others

Idk, I've seen fair bit it. friends mine posting group chat weekend neighbors people shaming lot. So....the shaming definitely happening. Though guess lessening some. literally test year ago.

Technology takes time. Oh agree EU principle. hard remainer. EU's current actions shameful. Fwiw, US getting 400 million doses pfizer moderna vaccine end June currently, that's almost enough vaccinate every adult, even without Johnson &amp; Johnson's vaccine. government also got another 200 million doses ordered summer. there's definitely going enough vaccine go around normality end summer basically 0 doubt. question enough people get vaccinated, able vaccinate kids, vectors spread somehow keep us things going back normal. Getting vaccine returning normal two different things. risk straying much topic, events show EU absolutely beyond reform, put self preservation ahead anything else. ideals solidarity largely gone, explicit Greece, EU tolerated police thuggery Catalonia, among many things, explicit now. say solidarity countries arent EU, Ukraine Serbia EU loves court anti Russia crusade, send single vaccine dose. mean EU order 6 companies, 4 vaccine get approval first , 6. 

Sanofi , ""the French"" vaccine ordered EU , UK , Canada US decent big amounts. 
The logic "" French "" vaccine blame , comes mostly conservative media likes blame find mistakes weren`t. reason Sanofi ordered many (300 millionen EU), symply produce reliably lot vaccine ( 1 billionen year France, think around half billionen UK). Vaccine back safety net mosty countries , way AstraZeneca . One worked out, not.

IN end see contracts , know blame. Especially J&amp;J ramp quick once/if given OK. it’s offered I’ll definitely get since work healthcare. Better safe side! even post shite ""article"" even quote match clickbait headline. would humiliating. Even now. large quantities available anyway. Wear damn mask social distance. know can't help snark. please, wear damn mask. Miracle spring water inbound More! estimates say approximately 33% Americans already Covid. Also average age death Spanish Flu &lt;25 Covid surprise me. look citizens far EU good job getting vaccines union. Well let's see. 210 days (end August) 2M day would 420M vaccinations. would add 80M already done 500M. 100M single dose vaccines others two doses, gets us there. that's also right line supply already promised.

Seems doable me. summer even technically end September 22 there's leeway. 

On hand, anti-vax crowd make much difficult. Also, need vaccine approved kids get number. words, get there, it'll issues enough people willing/eligible rather logistics distribution (hopefully) supply. First, please discuss decision Dr. vaccine study showed mycocardial infraction aka heart attack .03% higher placeblo.  Pretty sure don’t let get vaccine positive covid. 100% sure tho donate free patients. slowing due limited supply, without MLK catchup effect probably would small increase, like yesterday, instead decrease.

I expect something 1.4m 1.6m tomorrow's update, vs 1.3m last week. kids go school. tell they're school. Im guessing area offering online only. are, many poor parents working 2 jobs means can't home school kids work. 40% brash rude, 40-60% *need* start getting brasher ruder! Deaths have, slightly, begun falling. look like charts noise data MLK holiday. Look yesterday 3734 deaths reported (per covid tracking project) vs 4064 two weeks prior Tuesday Jan 12. Exactly thoughts ""meme"" drug hailed panacea COVID.

The people genuinely need drugs get fucked over. know buying things works right?

I do, apparently don't. Time signature payment irrelevant thing matters agreed performance dates. sure downvoted you. district hybrid mode entire year. issues knowledge Regardless wrong keep American citizens returning home due amounts fine. kind thing infuriates me. Yeah similar area NC. School district said hundreds students accounted for. wonder bigger hitters EU start this, would interesting. Also lag getting 2nd dose time 2nd dose immunity kicks in, plus even vaccinate every adult, kids may keep us herd immunity. find hysterical ironic day Biden takes office, Democratic party complete 180 policy last 10 months, despite cases sky high.

I agree everything stupid, thinking stupid magically end either. real winners perpetuating crisis, keep going. Sounds right. Can’t fire people ICU’s full. 

Once things closer normal, make mandatory anyone works hospital. Might well one every hour then, logic. contracts work.

What nonsense?

I think find contracts ""work"" certain way. depends specific wording contract question. That's kind whole point drafting contract first place. Hey man, saved butt TP news. I'm thankful. Extinction event Shitty luck Pfizer AZ facilities EU hit massive scaling issues (supposedly) right start deliveries + pre-existing conditions (lol) e.g. inexperience new production methods (according AZ CEO's interview yesterday). 

Ultimately whether shitty luck shitty planning main component mess, EU still plants seize name obligation health safety European citizens first. That’s going happen. countries economy would collapse. covid come from? 

Is still circulating wild somewhere?

Also infected individuals hosptials would still pose possible risk. ...is good advice? Im moroccan, maybe keep reddit police radat check hate phrase mask other. It’s cringeworthy like it’s supposed cute trendy. It’s not. Ah, yes. also. Heart-to-heart distance called it. Netherlands Germany, point same. YA, feel people young kids . . . time socialized properly. Oxford vaccine made team Oxford university/the Jenner institute, AZ came onboard develop/manufacturer it, UK ordered guaranteed doses first, enabling production facilities built, months later EU ordered doses, facilities built, unsurprisingly facilities months behind UK production, hardly expect skip queue.

On subject export bans Germany banned export PPE last year It’s lot things. Free childcare, kids hate school it’s online friends, can’t sit still long enough watch video (and arguably teacher matter). feel like vaccinate teachers doses offer ppe, fine. parents want risk kid bringing home SARS-CoV-2 potentially dying/succumbing long haul symptoms - that’s risk. 

You also government mismanaged start, telling us kids don’t spread covid, utter lie parents buying propaganda want break. fact Capitalism doesn’t care life cogs machine fighting scraps make meaning utter nothingness.  Im moroccan fuck messaging 5 months [**2021-06-27 22:43:03 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-06-27%2022:43:03%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide too. Every time see someone say ""We need x amount time vaccinate everyone"" want die. need vaccinate everyone go back normal. probably even need 70%, considering like 20% population *has already covid*. sound like someone looking things angry about. UK contract signed first says priority matter EU contract says all.

Yeah think that's contract disputes work - contract automatically over-rule another contract signed earlier. I'm lawyer I'd assume parties promised certain number vaccines would stand equal footing negotiate there. Unless EU signed contract actually promise anything, said would mistake. head AZ seems claiming 'no promises made' yet would surprised one noticed negotiations.

But maybe important question would AZ give UK priority? would wise move multinational pharmaceutical company lots business EU?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* I've read articles homeless, prisoners indigenous people getting vaccine first responders still waiting. Remember Wuhan awareness dangerous new pneumonia outbreak instead things properly arrested doctors journos reporting held potluck like 50,000 people? riddle. One explanation would people getting vaccinated people ignoring quarantine people. basically vaccinating already take lot precautions get COVID.

Another explanation UK variant dominant Israel affecting children more, account large percentage new cases. rights signed away safety something never go away?

The Nazis said thing Jews put trains. ""Its safety."" said. Lipids, raw materials Pfizer vaccine think majority people super worried personal risk themselves. see/want see vaccine key getting lives back. Around world we're seeing that's what's peoples' minds days. Seems like visit belgian plant weird magic there?

It's plant Wallonia. Here's scenario I'm envisioning:

* CEO arrives plant, blocked flaming tyres picket fences red flags.
* ""What's matter?""
* ""We proclaim revolution! get 120 days year et ça, c'est inacceptable! Nous n'avons rien à perdre que nos chaînes!""
* ""Ok, here's €50/mo bonus""
* Picket fences removed, production resumes. whole thing really shed light much school obedience rather learning. 

This find moral panic we're ruining entire generation kids in-person school part year kind ridiculous. Anyone wants able catch actual educational material pretty easily, rest mostly stupid power dynamics like this. lot society probably wants people servile bootlickers bosses I'm sure kind thing useful that, acting like essential proper development young minds nonsense. That's peoples problem moment.|Except antivaxers apparently queuing say no. wait till he's school show em things 'round want stay basement henceforth go right ahead force masses hermits. Happened London (with tube) actually believe fully vaccinated means still spread covid? Like heart hearts really think that?

I'm vaccinated, yeah... *think* I'm spreading virus, still accept not-zero chance.

If I'm vaccinated people, like parents, back life normal. I'm public space hanging unvaccinated people, seems prudent continue taking feeling time afraid two classes people: vaccinated unvaccinated could unravel social fabric.

Do want vaccine passports? get people prove vaccination status everywhere go.

Or wait couple months vaccination widespread today. truly believe month beginning end pandemic.  Honestly think hatred stems changing name tappenzee Course! think Fauci saying months know 

I wish would speak clearly like yes go see grand kids let’s avoid pool party Ozarks Vegas comment heavily implied it. Exactly. point, media becoming boy cried wolf.

Imma pop popcorn go r/Wallstreetbets instead. interesting AZ plan get extra doses. Agree. parents 62 high risk. really want get neither eligible yet. mom organ transplant survivor immunosuppressive drugs past 40 years. annoying isnt higher priority. hope get summer. Holding hope J&amp;J approved things start move faster. disheartening hear local govt say months still 65+ done. masks mandated forever never get herd immunity? 

Do want tell grandchild time saw eyes public? vaccines question made facilities owned British American companies happen located EU. Hence, rubbish. racism treat autism??? Hmmmm? mr smarty pants! Thanks! doctors place admitting it’s geared towards vaccinated people running maskless streets. would agitate people back line you’d riots vaccine centers. 
Your second point studies done...what show don’t prevent infection whatsoever? That’s basically scare tactic used. You’re already making presumption prevent least infection. vaccine high efficacy would unheard put serious dent infection. 
If they’re confident what’s “herd immunity fall” talk?  you’re preventing infections significant clip can’t get herd immunity. Never mind fact children 12 make 15% US population already.  

Assuming you’re suggesting one lie:
1) Vaccines don’t prevent enough infection
2) Herd immunity fall
3) normal herd immunity

I threw third one think goal posts reality make sure hospitals aren’t overwhelmed. mean, we're spending trillions dollars bailouts. Almost amount money could conceivably spend spin factories would orders magnitude cheaper damage done.

I'm asking there's serious effort afoot try I'm suggesting. new variants coming up, might end losing simply vaccine production slow gets jumped new congagious, deadly variant. 

And again, vast sums spent unemployment, business bailouts, etc, could probably build thousand nuclear power plants. We're talking vast sums money. Thanks! despite small groups dumbasses get amplified, vaccine culture US strong, vaccines way life since 50s. people dominated headlines early process IDIOT ANTIVAXXWERS!!!1!1! people understandingly apprehensive vaccine developed quickly. vax numbers go up, public figures get it, good news keeps pouring in, people willing take it. know else seen South Carolina? kickass vaccines  Thank you, felt like talking potato managed roll keyboard. IM testosterone shot almost completely sesame oil: viscous. way volume. cause anywhere near much local inflamation. saying get it, he's saying already covid results immunity, subsequently rest population. Ok we'll see happens. Hope faster! personal experience vaccines general much move arm afterwards. dont move arm much shit try go work roughly location, cause swelling pain. 

I thought might allergic tetanus vaccine long time initial dose kid swelled size half baseball arm hurt several days. recently got booster finally telling severe reaction (normally would refuse give one thinking might allergic). turns didnt move arm enough. 

After got booster moved arm bunch fine. swelling pain first hours

Everybody really moving vaccinated arm around much possible, especially hour getting shot say doubt lasts. chose free force wear mask henceforth. Thank you!

Dude fucking prick everything else tenure  newest study small, nine patients, five autoantibodies least seven months. yet undergone peer review publication, authors urged caution interpreting results.

Can please stop kind crap. bunch people going think get Covid body eat inside something. 9 patients millions. Proof, please, it’s possible fuckup Pfizer / Biontech supply chain UK. [CNN better, ten years ago, default news station, really fallen badly. Rubbish? Lol. Sounds like someone Brit reaping sowed. actually believe fully vaccinated means still spread covid? Like heart hearts really think that?

Come on. feeling time afraid two classes people: vaccinated unvaccinated could unravel social fabric. Fauci saying years months though? me, pain like isolated flu aches less soreness injection site. second night shot, aches shoulder finger tips honestly quite painful. woke up. Luckily gone morning. that’s aches COVID feel like, man, I’m super grateful never it/them body. emphasize protection getting sick then. know works regard. I'm sure understand completely. see significant drop cases now?

I see numbers dropping. 40% population vaccinated degree, fall cliff? Curfew work contain growth, see situation Marseille (since first week No, community spread still control. isn’t teachers’ fault. Vaccinate first schools priority. Problem solved. I'm always skeptical specific brand name product touted potential cure/treatment. Could be? Sure. But, reads like ad Xlear anything else me. US yet approved using AZ vaccines. delays Pfizer production EU due plant capacity upgrades. really. They're pushing dumbshit narratives point. seems like bad call given don’t know whether vaccinated people transmit virus. instilling hermit going anywhere unsafe unhealthy absurd. clear Japan absolutely control virus, besides decision start manufacturing AZ vaccine, they've done little curb spread even *document* spread. I'm glad I'm school point. wear mask every day school would depressing reddit, anyone progressive called Trump cultist. 

Extremist partisans dumb- really matter type are. Ffs, click baity. Yeah, that's meant, poor wording part.

They tested showed symptoms. Others (e.g. AZ), tested periodically, later excluded asymptomatic cases. ah see. Thanks, know that. real shame global system know it, dissolving eyes. Stop making irresponsible life decisions!  necessarily. overly cautious/bordering pessimistic suppress vaccination rates people see point getting them. first big festival concert city going without question hesitation. LOL VACCINE STOP DEADLY PANDEMIC LESS EFFECTIVE ONE LOOOOOOOOOOL SUCK

Crab bucket. think he's talking seniors start getting 2nd doses within weeks. want rushing visit grandkids science &amp; data yet know whether shot prevents asymptomatic transmission. microbiologist buddy says almost guaranteed vaccine (like others) stop asymptomatic transmission, health experts want absolutely certain, new contagious strains there. want spread new mutations states vaccinations widespread. mean shouldn’t naked underwear lol, otherwise agree there's information, daily briefs necessary hourly ones. teachers highest priority group. live, high school, college university teachers third fourth line. can’t vaccinated yet. Seems kinda backward, tbh. though? CDC guidance exactly did. feds told to.

Literally state would made mistake gotten hit first. Trump admin's fuckup. Definitely. also requiring hafnaya testing could also impacting testing numbers. Makes sense. Hope bears coming weeks. You’re writing reddit, internet, probably smartphone computer. yet science lie? Hm... yet, *even accounting cost*, 80th percentile healthcare systems world. Meanwhile, Canadian system gets sucked daily? 84th lol dont think guns, probably much *Fairfax County Teachers Union entered chat* we've tried. think literally incapable enjoying anything anymore. buy gift cards restaurants, show, she'll go complain that, er, non-white people too. one time parents took vacation Mexico mom complained Mexicans - joke. take go shopping she'll complain cutesy phrases clothes homegoods liberal. can't even spend time grandchildren without turning something political. go church thinks people fake (jeez, irony). i'm typing up, really kinda seems like lost cause maybe bother. point reduce risk severe illness eventually reach point population protected mass vaccination. people vaccinated still take precautions. dad doctor vaccinated. still takes precautions doesn’t impact behavior. Thankfully live somewhere almost one wears outside lots smiles shared outdoor walks like green belts near live it’s hard stores. like facial expressions &amp; smiles. Can’t wait shit end. European American vaccines 95% effectiveness they? California! healthcare sometimes 65. slow going. Teachers slated vaccination while. It’s bloody disgraceful. Exactly. Maybe stopped dismissing people’s desire actual live opposed simple covid avoidance may actually get somewhere. 
It’s like telling teenagers sex might baby. Kind true, went 110-120k per day 70-75k per day. still pretty high per capita compared rest world. 

much reason simply less infections, less symptomatic people who've near confirmed case test. weekly average cases dropped 8,300 daily 6,600. 10 million, enough 5 million people absolutely correct things could changed course virus. haven’t scene Biden’s vaccine rollout increased decrease yet. referring to. Yes, right. important emphasize likelihood things happening though, like said. Hell, could get car die fatal car crash, chances low enough take risk. got first shot moderna yesterday feel worse H1N1 really bad years ago. feel like drank bottle Poision barely able sleep last night. Here’s hoping it’s passed tomorrow . Wow, thank response. good news informative realistic. apparent government communications tend reflect think general public handle hearing, necessarily truth matter. hope everything normal summer like keep hearing, point, likelihood process goes flawlessly? also make good point 100 inoculations 100 days initiative. sounds great we're able pull off, that's less third population every three months. Things would need dramatically improve anti-maskers anti-vaxers would need sudden ability logical. Thanks time took response- much appreciated. fear could hardly wrong. Experts seem disagree almost universally I've seen. saw federal plan blank piece paper prior 1/21 right? starts top. Hopefully fixed quickly Perhaps lowballed initial shortfall. 


Have shortfall 45%. Tell EU actually 60% deliver 45% less vaccine everyone happier said delivering 45% less originally. Yep. really miss smiling people/seeing people smile making small talk strangers grocery store. Interesting standpoint, especially seen fact EU spent 2 billion euros upfront development vaccine. much ask deliver according agreements made, making new agreements fulfill first? Yes. concern widespread lockdowns work, they're table public health measure they're never table. Worse, clear failure restrictions laid feet loose late, pressure future lock early hard rather waiting see situation worsen. consider determinants health eg. nutrition, environment, socioeconomic status obviously genetics there’s going quite bit overlap within family groups. families higher risk Covid complications others (not saying that’s happened specifically case though). can't create factory, create entire supply chain, takes years do. China already supply chain they're limited much produce. realise dosing issue small subset one trial right multiple trials across three phases multiple countries? hardly impact, notable interesting results came group error. 

There low phase three data across vaccines older people. It’s AZ. Questions:

1) possible AZ's vaccine efficacy lower PFE/Moderna measuring asymptomatic infections?

2) LD/SD, SD/SD?
 
3) 10 hospitalizations entire ~12,000 control arm...isn't bit low side? Thought would ~2-3% &lt;1% may dumb question food place employees already days off? everyone works every day right? working much harder before. really feel teachers professors, used way teaching. Plus responding students online takes lot time. 2 weeks ago UK variant. Last week South African variant. week Brazilian variant

At point start recognize trend stop fearmongering? Fauci still says true range 70-90 per comment

he believes could 90% &amp; honestly actually know real number news shouldn’t agenda, even it’s discourage people going out. cases need report it. public health experts media hide info public order achieve certain outcomes breeds distrust contempt. people really struggling anxiety depression never end (because media people like Michael Osterholm tell so), relief would know cases dropping concurrent vaccination. thing said it’s *technically* true, reinfection *can* happen new variants *may* cause problems, I’ve noticed people harp things usually haven’t done actual research basing they’re saying headlines. It’s sensationalist annoying. need get facts straight. nothing nationalism, vulnerable people getting vaccine first. 

The EU spent 2 BILLION euros upfront AstraZeneca develop vaccine. Therefore, EU opinion AstraZeneca honor agreement EU agreements. Especially think true, selling vaccine higher prices countries, put EU deliveries back burner intentionally since make much money others. Denny's never fails me........it delivers immediately :) meantime jabs arms. I'm board part.  second dose Pfizer week. first second doses fever, chills, body ache, head ache, sore arm.

I'm sure Astrazeneca would meet deadlines could. Problem simply enough vaccine. 


They selling cost selling elsewhere, would gain? happens allergic reaction vaccine? Maybe say Oxford know properly run trial given errors including trying use spectraphotometry measure concentration vaccine.  understanding least first, withholding second doses make sure people could get first dose. get wrong, completely believe schools significantly worse teachers higher infection rates, meaningful data prove that. clear, headline refers Covid vaccine, virus itself.

Okay, people going anyway. check what’s going now. imagine summer bunch people vaccinated. swear govt should’ve recommended 12 ft public would use baseline mess around magically precise 6 ft measurement. saying multiple people 12 ft apart 2 people clearly changes behaviors. hang people 12 ft apart, might much fun would probably stay home often. 6 ft sort measurement could liiiittle careful still basically activities. AFAIK pregnant women still smell actual food (and find repulsive)

We’re greeting “Hi! you? vaccinated 😉 ?  You’re never going able tell. I'm betting meant 350, comment over-the-top sarcastic. pretending discuss ""implications"" article literally admitted read! lol 3,000 deaths day isn’t awful? lucky ones get vaccine. see life improving summer fall. Enforcing mask mandates public selectivley work. least tied amount spread population, whats going individuals. I'm scientist consumer COVID news, many people talk seem pessimistic, somewhat natural, given we've through. variants may wild card, re-infection seems rare far, vaccinations people already infected flat start making harder COVID spread. projects US reach herd immunity (through nearly even split infections vaccinations) July 11th. may optimistic several months (and site uses different herd immunity criteria Dr. Fauci), things gradually improve get closer herd immunity. California, believe (and hope) January (and December surge led it) worst month pandemic. ""Probably"" good enough comes putting people's health risk.

IMO, Sputnik Sinovac would last resort (as : there's choice need vaccinate NOW) Turns necessarily like WFH. like forced commute 5 times week chained desk 40 hours. It’s teachers fought keep schools closed Ok let’s creative then. 7 12 online learning utilize space opened up. half days, staggered start ending times. manufacturing plant it, can’t school? im 14 lot grocery stores curbside pick-ups. list, vouch couple these.  me, comment point really dispute efficiency vaccine (because clearly know population wide numbers)

Yet i'm somehow fearmongering. News like (posted reliable non-partisan source) far implications simply saying ""vaccine bad"", hide interesting information simple minded people might interpret incorrectly practice i'm going adhere in-school testing throughout state. 25 different schools far, NEARLY 25 different policies. ludicrous! Right are. mistake. googled. forget never FOMO need confront social anxiety excuse stay home. Major key. Serious question here!

I get TB test today. also sign covid vaccine today! However, email, says took vaccine within 14 days can't sign covid vaccine. TB test count? Based research I’ve read lately: It’s extremely rare become reinfected first place. People get reinfected generally don’t symptoms. symptomatic people thought pretty bad spreading virus. it’s theoretically possible, really unlikely.

If you’re around people high risk, it’s obviously still good idea take precautions, especially they’re vaccinated yet. It’s simple thing too. remarkable even Guardian Indy leading anti-EU headlines front pages. say didnt like held accountable school. reported surplus can't found.

The day said 200 million additional doses seem like enough, even others pointed addition 400 million already ordered. gets disclaimer r/worldnews. screw Funny, funny everyone talking really pays, right said people. Patients, taxpayers, businesses saddest “believers;” every one. want fools ordered punished returning use patients actually need shorted long months, isn’t bad trade exposes stupidity. think understand ""best efforts"" actually means. ""prior obligations"", immaterial far contracts concerned. thing matters agreed performance dates. Yeah don’t get people live. positive angle people sub saying “when I’m vaccinated, fuck this...” know widespread. Seven months? She'd know now. Good luck getting second vaccine dose.

Masks, aren’t effective others, work. news far positive get widespread media coverage. save somewhere I've keeping close eye regarding Brazilian variant news Wanna bet they'll still refuse get vaccines?

Because will. priority list em home. Yep Ironically, measles resurfaced due antivaxers recent years, doctors extra concerned many people skipped normal childhood vaccines early pandemic people afraid seek normal health care. Except poor people still go work provide people food also young kids home supervision. lucky least one kid age 12 watch younger ones Maybe pregnant, no? I’ve CFA article. Always long line. never takes minutes get food. Who's talking Florida? Yeah, keep avoiding point. Lol Growing drug substance biological process geometric growth rate, takes weeks per batch. 
  

From article looks though AZ expecting big vaccine produce facility Belgium supply majority drug substance sent bottling facilities initial EU order decanted latest batch, growing weeks, yield 1/3 expected/hoped for. 

And produced doses date still ramping probably larger initial quantity. 

This threw manufacturing projections month proverbial last minute. question whether resolve problems partner company next cycle completes, might one that. must suck live every day worst case scenario. ask question asked, fucking bother? Idk you’ve ever experienced Brown’s commencement weekend, it’s LOT people 3 days events include alumni weekend + grad activities. Unfortunately, don’t think “meaningfully better” means school want many people around campus infectious variants now. means 60% won’t cut it. think deep know kids spread disease easily adults. Society fine teachers collateral damage. travels countries, people (mainly English speaking countries EU) super critical US face American. honestly better Obama years- GW Trump years, whew. didn’t help Texas, (although Austin, fair). Ive literally people act like slack-jacked moron ignore learned from, without even talking me. But, cool that, screw them.

I get it. entire extended family live England, get time. Anytime talk American, think would happen (an America) talked someone else certain country. I'm sure I'd quickly labeled bigot, xenophobe, racist, etc. whatever reason, people shit Americans get free pass, people abuse hell said free pass.

Greetings Dallas, way! lived Austin recently two years. Funny thing mention Austin way get treated English relatives American similar got treated Dallasite Austin..haha. know describe everyone Austin, got one many people talking Dallas decided leave return take agree fair criticisms country, complicated place. People watch news TV/movies decide know Americans American culture, one who’s loved actually understands huge diverse culture is. rarely agree things. home, goddammit, think think know messed country is... idea. Yet it’s also full lovely, wonderful, friendly people friends family. It’s difficult dysfunctional. think countries like that. blast it’s powerful (for now).

Well said. hard picked people world. I've noticed English relatives seems like picking Americans almost like coping mechanism them. Like need put Americans feel better themselves. might true everyone, look like that, feel bad them. I'd hate put people another country feel better myself. I'm proud Texan live life enjoy city state. realize problems (all countries do), deflect pointing laughing countries, problems face head on. islands? Commission order AZ late August, order Pfizer November! even ordered less needed political pressure. must worst mistake governance Europe decades.  **Dr. Marielle Fricchione city’s Health Department said Chicago large — along N.Y.C., Philadelphia, Houston L.A. County — receives vaccines directly federal government, suburbs towns gotten doses state.**

I able deduce rest comment paragraph, tbh, helps. former administration’s leadership might contributed distribution/access issues. Scottish Government told Michael Gove remove supply numbers vaccine roll-out plan, ministers scientific advisers concerned knowledge exact number vaccines UK received would allow countries world pressurise vaccine manufacturers divert supply.

They’re even discrete it. still pass virus

Nope. Definitely say that. Made clear still determining that.

But actually watch video read headline jump straight comments? Yeah I'm buying whole, ""asymptomatic cases cause organ damage,"" fear mongering. Sure long covid thing, rare complication proof damage permanent. read article provided, quoted union president saying also remain students vaccinated return school. require maintain hybrid model continue social distancing, masking, mitigation strategies.

Those seem like totally reasonable demands. teachers vaccinated mean let schools hook mask wearing, social distancing mitigation strategies. Probably really 10m week max that's much administration ramping distribution. J&amp;J approved definitely possible though know lot people can't choose right? sad care family understand. takes lot mental strength handle this, everyone it. hope family remains safe &amp; hope actions &amp; like dont ruin rest us

in IL opened indoor dining week. us vaccinated yet. government telling us okay get together, inside, without masks, vaccines, height pandemic. legal mean smart.

&amp; absolutely cruel workers vaccinated yet choice serve definitely have, come across good summary yet. thing happen dad. unchecked pneumonia turned anti-gbm disease (goodpasture syndrome). otherwise healthy active 40 year old. Sure. Getting people vaccinated significantly ineffective cause celebration.

Just add, UK 10 per 100 U.S 6 per 100 without real plan. close million day soon coordination. exactly point? Eh, quite. still got email HR department saying new variant infectious deadly zero context provided must distance even mask even harder, etc.

Anecdotal know, people still brainwashed variant stuff right now.  So, degree Physics, swear explaining quantum mechanics laypeople easier explaining statistics.

You say ""future, hypothetical repetitions"" eyes glaze over. Ok, fine, let's start way simpler then. :/ Looks like article read may old news, 10 mil better nothing... game changing 😒 It’s definitely vaccine would less willing get atm, that’s using proven technology. really mess pretty bad. Americans 65 need get vaccinated soon they're able. I'm hard time caring state live in. US 25M reported COVID cases. likely underreported, let's say 10% 330M people US sort natural immunity. Currently, \~1.5% people received two doses vaccine, \~6.5% people received one dose.  


Looking towards end March: US averages 100k cases per day then, number people natural immunity go 12%. number people fully vaccinated roughly: \[number currently vaccinated\] + \[number currently 1 shot\] + \[number new doses shipped March\]. I'm counting doses shipped March, since folks receiving chance get second shot. Moderna Pfizer report able deliver another 155m vaccines end March. need rapidly ramp rate they're shipping meet goal, let's assume they'll ship 2/3 March 1/3 February. means another 50M doses/2doses per vaccination/330M people = \~7.5% people could full inoculation doses shipped March. 

That would grand total \~27.5% people US inoculated. juuuust enough offset increased infectiousness new strains projected become predominant around time. However, shipments stay schedule (and vaccinations able keep shipments), number go \~43.5% end April, would mean lower rate spread even new infectious strains. 

Johnson Johnson significant production issues - clear able make dent vaccination rate April, \*assuming\* study promising results.  Well like article focuses primarily partisan differences overall makes asked estimate share deaths age group, average American dramatically overestimates share COVID-19 deaths people aged 24 younger, putting around 8%, fact 0.1% fact COVID-19 poses much higher mortality risk old young clear feature virus early on; remarkable many Americans remain misinformed basic factor December, asked, “What percentage people infected coronavirus needed Less one five U.S. adults (18%) give correct answer 1 5%. Many adults (35%) say least half infected people need hospitalization. true, millions resulting patients would overwhelmed hospitals throughout pandemic.


I think pretty clear people absolutely idea serious virus actually is, average healthy person 60 little risk. anybody believe see 3 million doses day coming weeks think that's basically already problem. heard next week admin moving 10m distributed week would mean 1.42m day. We're already basically less supply. point may wait J&amp;J increase many happens many people refuse vaccine.

Cross bridge get tell people vaccinated can't see anyone whatsoever runs risk people refusing.

I can't really agree statement. told can't see anyone vaccinated well. they're still told could save life. also told ""It might prevent infecting others, we'll get back months."" unchecked pneumonia one time manifested anti-gbm (goodpasture's syndrome). took kidneys damaged lungs. I'm dying kidney failure need transplant covid, everything hold. Wear mask people, story well. Moderna one swab test patients came second dose. remember exact number, showed \~60% decrease asymptomatic disease point. So, preventing symptomatic disease \~90% days 15-28, \~60% reduction asymptomatic disease measured day 28. know announcements UK contract AZ states UK plants exclusive UK 100m doses provided. based announcements regarding agreement UK govt &amp; AZ simply plants UK. 

This announced initial agreement UK AZ last year. new news way shape form. increase weekly supply starting next week, believe 2M per day expected! Haha yes, I’m mainly hoping rogue grad students see comments go oh yeah review stats. 

Interestingly enough, NEJM Pfizer article reported credible intervals, everybody gets technically correct!  not? trained so, what's issue? like idea is, he's ""Acting administrator centers medicaid AZ still shit.

Prove stories reason vaccinations going take longer. Oh dear lord. 

how many ***scheduled***... good used.. 24-48 hours?

&amp;#x200B;

the next problem going supply..

more vaccines going need approved. 

&amp;#x200B;

my city 2 mass vax centers waiting go.. vaccine available..

right now, supply one. parents uncle feel moderna one either Crocodiles good economy know two contracts distinct, people assuming AZ plant UK, get priority share. Yes, bit US banning flights China NY still getting multiple flights full infected tourists ( American European) Italy every day. washpost article msn get paywall: scientists eagerly awaiting results trial conducted Johnson &amp; Johnson partly conducted South Africa, first hint beyond laboratory tests well vaccine may protect area world variant circulating. useless story. course existence vaccine end pandemic unless get vaccine. meantime continue social distance mask up. pandemic everyone wants vaccine gets it. would hasten, develop vaccine length time gets better.

I'm case needs get asap.

I imagine 3 years time vaccine kept room temp much thinner fluid.

in 10 years might pill.

.

.

.

in 20 years people refuse take still people sware hydroxychloroquine works taken zinc. Germany blocked AZ vaccine over-65s!

Well, i'll damned, least good news.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* None exports banned. know getting at, wrong. EU giving power block exports paying customers. UK paying customer first 100m doses produced UK. situation same. biggest issue organ damage, even asymptomatic mild cases, hits age groups ethnicities. 


Covid nasty beast going scar millions over. I'm fan lives line. 😬 That's good hear :( We've seeing year still amazing epidemic moves. variant developed Brazil, significant travel curbs around, winds multi-step domestic transmission monitored facility Europe. UL variant doesn’t seem going control anywhere except UK far. Oh yeah, true. Count one comply. Whatever takes get back normal. :( want mine already work essential. Feelings nothing that. 

As far taking unpaid time, that's stimulus *should for.* think perfectly clear ICU 105% capacity operating beyond design limits. can't even imagine else could possibly mean. still getting wrecked new mutation. live fairly small city northern israel spread beginning January whole family friends. Cases went like 50 percent town like two weeks. It’s crazy. Might ocd ""1st"" really annoying me. say civilly possible: living reality. 

If stopped Wuhan, let’s say, could made go back reservoir bit, even wouldn’t eradicated. stands, world wide airborne virus. literal impossibility. 

It nothing rhetoric will. Unless honestly believe lock entire planet decade. usually good sign notice something vaccinated indicates immune system working recognizing foreign antigen subsequently mounting inflammatory/immune response. would chew ever living hell right now, would result getting banned. I’ve gotta stay sub another months dispel doom gospels like you. every article like there’s another two say indefinite 2022... Fauci creeping date back “early winter.”

I see mean, do. really poster-child reasonable precautions never got COVID... 

But, I’m vaccinated now. I’m legally allowed go out, I’m risking family all. others around choosing risks. 

Again, always follow law. point, unreasonable imo. mean, already answered vaccines give sterilizing immunity

I think made painfully clear (and video included) know sterilizing immunity. still research now, folks careful wear masks, social distance, etc.

Yes, people going let guard down, there's little denying parents going come visit us kids April daughter's birthday (they'll get shots next 2-3 weeks), I'd expect wear masks gas stations, go packed restaurants still, etc. pessimistic watched actual video.

He explicitly stated reason expect vaccine prevent transmission *and* currently studies it.

Most people know still saying nonsense like ""the vaccine preventing spreading virus,"" still get arguments point almost daily reddit. people shifted understanding Fauci espousing here, would great thing. Cool Yeah, go Chiefs Bribes would accepting sales costs it.

Besides evidence whatsoever AZ bribed UK government? smells unsubstantiated bollocks me. We're currently making 7 governments.  risk group elderly probably 99.9-99.99% safe death. 
Of course chances death still 2-6 times flu. Source claim federal government withholding vaccines Illinois Obama? Looks like 1.5m vaccines sent Illinois less half used. much vaccine UK exported? metrics made digestible public. Comparing measuring Jet engine's N1 shaft Space shuttle engines able go beyond original 100% throttle limit make sense.

Logic needs employed avoid misleading average joe looking ICU loads. 2019 Americans welcome travel anywhere. 2020, American tourists get global 'stink-eye'. US currently ground zero COVID-19 outright bans heavy restrictions involving quarantine testing travel, particularly US passport. people saying 2021 year road-trip since collectively persona non grata anywhere else.

Check idea still travel heavy restrictions: normal forms international travel Americans includes cruises tours pretty much completely halted. correct people already travel, fraction barely year ago, heavily restricted get back normal several months inoculate population.  Hopefully visit people vaccinated. i'm California liberal, stage rollout premature applying race-based criteria vaccination. Race ethnicity one component determines who's getting sick &amp; dying covid. could argue household income even better predictor infection mortality. 

While important aware different communities make sure everyone channels access, want overburden state &amp; local officials record-keeping slows pace rollout. 

Also want make intrusive potential recipients asking pointed questions race background. may object, like akin asking citizenship residency status.  Polls show people think something like 1 6 chance dying Covid get it.

This second reply mentioning poll except last time ""many young people think 10% chance dying covid"". lot miscommunication surrounding study/poll i'll look but, using ""study"" say ""news bad"" thing news take sad cases say ""covid bad""? read day a-symptomatic likely transmit all, can't remember where. ~~I thought went hospital, though, hospital required update VAERS? No?~~

Nevermind looked up. right, probably inaccurate. passive reporting system, meaning reports adverse events automatically collected, require report filed VAERS. VAERS reports submitted voluntarily anyone, including healthcare providers, patients, family members. Reports vary quality completeness. often lack details sometimes information contains errors. production mit first Belgien later UK?  Also EU one last bodies order Vaccine months UK get first?? current climate would bet significant deliveries plants inside EU. BoJo would want hide that, too. rage real. Wife work schools. person since August. person except Nov 7-Jan 6. vaccine. hear ""maybe weeks"" was-

Saying he’s nationalistic therefore he’s trump-like silly about: learned Americans like 10% says, present cautious version everyone would back licking doorknobs now. 

He spent six months telling us Christmas holidays going bloodbath, stop X, Y, Z, etc., people half listened. Fck. cancelled hundreds, thousands, scheduled vaccination day bec ran them. enough scientific data either, bet.

mRNA vaccines new never widely used.  Today, learned far people internet presume know much actually judge licensed EMT locale. clickbait headline? story vaccinating population stop spread. take time vaccinate population then, we'll still need restrictions. headline suggests even everyone vaccinated, disease would still spread that's article says. misunderstanding? pretty obvious joke guy Calm old man lol That’s huge blow since 65 ground needs most. Hopefully enough doses vaccines cover 65+ population. 300M Pfizer

Now expanded 600M.

Ordering 300M Moderna would tricky US company. EU leaning J&amp;J, option 400M. sovereign choice, sovereign choice EU buy products manufactures first.

If UK wanted say EU policy, perhaps stayed EU. US clear beginning would case.

The EU clear beginning thought vaccine nationalism bad would never this. Lo behold, countries spent countless millions paying vaccines, EU done u-turn decided block exports. 95% still 1 20 people. think people hear 95% sounds close 100 really quite far.

but course amazing &amp; save many lives &amp; relief finally tangible response pandemic Two years row.... one year later still feels like change  God damn man. wish could shut country weed shit out. know economically ain’t feasible still. Either way hoped shit doesn’t cause major fourth wave stopped low-key pissed since feud Train Daddy. said, daily info dumps March April consistently reinforce distancing, masks, severity outbreak. sort messaging help modify public behavior. People praise things, still criticizing others. one other. won’t able get shot Xbox One Series X till end year. Great. Could force EU stop exports.

It also tactic used EU Trump's tariffs. totally false.

 factories(whether upgraded build ground up) infrastructure build since summer anticipation vaccine paid EU, US UK. worth billions, remain property companies.

But importantly, increase stock, adding value shareholders. Yes, AZ make bank like Pfizer/Biontech think charity gain nothing this, foolish. chosen Oxford ones gunning position. ones getting paid Oxford University, get prestige big Thank Me. why, AZ gain?  EU threatening take something UK already paid for. UK. Canda too.

You're right EU duty. utterly fucking failed. lashing anyone everyone, resorting outright piracy try fix mess caused. Yes Cascades get many feet snow. valley coast sees mostly rain. anybody figured they've managed bring like this. Living US can't imagine India much better . want go back India . Well seizing countries vaccines would risk diplomatic incident (and I'm talking UK here) do? *The Independent * aren’t fucking hate Tories. wonder encouraged story. scientists currently engineering virus full set mutations

Sure, lets go ahead make sure gets upgrades... GONNA DIE Potentially, ever less likely.

See: Israel 0.027% California Firemen 0.01% Yep. Schools necessarily going back normal fall that's kids able vaccinated. Society functionally normal summer post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Okay, here's Moderna's press release they're talking about: . I'm posting give little information: 30.4m rather 30m.

This dated 26th, Jan 25th number we're talking about, meaning *more* Jan 25th numbers.

So try calculating Moderna's Jan 25th numbers using CDC schedule way are. number calculate ends higher 30.4m press release, something wrong. release straight horses mouth 25th, higher numbers calculate Jan 25th.

Two bucks says offset second doses, higher 30.4m.

Again, want zoom? [This question. Novavax ? 

India already 2 drugs authorized emergency use drugs phase 3 trials. definitely think remain vigilant safe. Even vulnerable taken care of, us could one 10,000 chance die COVID age group. going take get everyone vaccinated. think forget miracle vaccines nearly 100% effective. Mumps 80% effective still mostly eliminates mumps outbreaks. Flu pertussis vaccines effective either, still tremendous amount good herd immunity. vaccine even close 100% excellent. common treatment anaphylaxis epinephrine, oxygenation ventilation. things ambulance EMT/Paramedic crew well-equipped deliver field. 

Parademics even trained perform surgical cricothyrotomy field if, reason, interventions work. 

TL;DR: actually safe environment get vaccine extremely low rate serious complication. get accident like that? big deal back then. least month news air time news outlets. $$$ seems erase internet history, can't eliminate traces. Certainly memories.

Sorry Chick Fil suck, run racist homophobic guy. That’s surprise. won’t real numbers till probably year two post pandemic. It’s part inflammatory response. It’s called Even that's considered fast. suspicion distributing produce fairly, i.e. favouring contracts others dubious reasons. idea means screwing vaccination rollout. guy horrible New York State known years. Unfortunately New York City always vote Democrat matter rest state pretty much screwed since little tiny strip land tail state controls entire state. I'm saying want Republican, want get Cuomo mess UK supply manufactured - plants Oxfordshire doses sent Germany Netherlands last year process called fill-and-finish, involves putting vials.** done plant Wrexham, creating complete UK supply arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, impact production problems EU vaccine manufacturing plants experienced. like early AZ doses sent uk taken sense EU supply. it? 77% Americans money hand handle surprise $1000 expense. That's good news, thanks. Teacher realize easily replaced. Plus, love hide behind Unions every little thing! guys taking everyone else, fault government?

Too many people easily swayed elites telling think. papers _full_ accusations towards AstraZeneca. Add loneliness epidemic people wanting belong tribe taking sides... implies R value *far* lower 1, though. impossible; Wuhan (R~0.3) welding people apartments (obviously meme, extreme enforcement). Gain access router enable parental controls disable access websites. deprogramming starts programming ends.

Without something drastic, typically need constantly fighting questioning misinformation taking in. ""How could Fauci board directors 1970 Moderna 10 years old?"" needs come realization news source lying her, yes, she'll rationalize plenty lies, there's straw breaks camel's back *eventually* -- question patient enough get there. Hopefully, return normalcy people come work ill get coworkers sick. better 'proven' 50% soda water one Warren always 'slamming' someone. Can't lady speak normally? see, bad EU it. analogy fit. 

If one factory whatever apparatus need produce vaccine, replicate factory 4 times 4x production. 

Obviously would logistical issues solve, they're solvable. already proven once, always easier. 

My question is: incentivizing this. there's financial incentive build bunch extra production something likely maximum number doses needed. get paid amount either way, invest lot increase production. what's point getting vaccinated? worth mentioning ""it proven yet"" mean ""we'll never know."" I'm sort hoping that, time I'm vaccinated, better data available topic. end I'll follow advice public health experts based data available EMA already stated likely going approve without age restrictions let member states decide. Guys he’s r/conspiracy poster ignore him. think consider work essential. Teachers would aghast asked take unpaid leave absence. people can't take year work keep food table. legal contracts matter. Az has, seems, entered contradicted contracts fucked. Blaming EU childish.  difference vaccinated REALLY effect top-line efficacy number touted article?  exceeded dire predictions every turn,

What talking about. hasn't. March people saying 5% death rate. ballpark .06% scaled heavily age.

People saying every hospital country would overflow. didn't

People saying vaccines 12-18 months minimum. Turns actually like 8 months.

The scary varients going overload hospitals (again) evade vaccine fact cases trending down. Perhaps importantly, time (assuming young) vaccinated, may actual data available vaccination impacts transmission. Travel policies surely impacted quite bit data, especially international travel, given countries vaccines widely available countries (sadly) source 2 billion EU? I've read multiple times c. 300 million (some paid yet). UK invested AZ vaccine.

Nevertheless, EU get UK factories that's contract. I'm adjunct lecturer two universities. student, I've problem professors I've dealt with. Here's recommend:

1. private class meeting students feel way
2. Draft letter outlining complaint everyone sign (digitally)
3. Send letter complaint department chair program director (whichever think sympathetic ear)
4. chair department program director problem professor send letter ombudsman-person

As individual student, little voice. even half class bands together (assuming school decent) able push back professor. 

If take route, aware class representative matter probably meetings professor department chair. take work, voice!

p.s. Document every step, every meeting, every email, every letter grade unfairly docked actions, escalate complaint ladder (student union, provost/vice president, president, etc). tested positve last October day struggling appetite. Food smell like .... difficult time finding anything appealing. Lost 17 pounds able gain back hold own.  Covid nasty, nasty, nasty, stay safe everyone. PS worked home since last March go groceries idea got always wear mask, wipe everything disinfectant, sanitize, always wear gloves addition everything else. Idea got me. unclear article much testing done. 

In clinical trials symptomatic got tested. (In order get trial done vaccine out)

It would interesting tested 163k see extent asymptomatic positives vaccinated population degree contagious. Covid back Late February early March. fever cough went away fatigue lingered. noticeable effect like girlfriends. wicked brain fog, anxiety, mood swings. abnormal clinical anxiety. episode cleared month so. know anecdotal heard survivors similar mental issues post-infection. Hopefully helps really hope girlfriend recovers fucking scary live through. Yeah always risk, case vaccinated 6 people, probably asked history anaphylaxis, filter 90% cases. know would like guy jumped car get it.  don’t think help solve anything. Ah okay. work health policy? certainly one would influenced sub . really you’re kidding think comments value. makes sense. know people shit Tony Blair, makes quite cogent substantive argument. get Anthrax shot?

Everyone else unit said burned like hell. weird reaction, made completely numb, messed muscle control arm. could still sort sign things right arm, hold arm left one would flop. stop donating anti-LGBTQ groups though. UK: want leave one largest markets satisfy ego past rulers, abusers colonisers!

Also UK: demand access European company's services help fix damage pandemic done take seriously!

Note: wish British cousins best.  proven, history empirical data clearly show vaccinated people spread virus appreciable amount. Fauci overly cautious point. fun watch new strains spread families “experts” put best shocked pikachu face. 

If idea ""fun"" sick person. suggest seeking mental heath treatment. Honestly, doubt functioning well even Covid began.. live France. confirm crazy stupid. Public transportation say ""adapt covid situation"" work 80% normal capacity. makes even worth. know logic here. got Flu Vaccine earlier year also caused stiff arm pain 24 hours. believe uncommon side effect vaccines general. European here. EU trying save face admit mistake, pissing AZ potential manufacturers process.

The common man benefit fight way. EU wins, vaccines going magically appear. EU loses, instability increases countries start fighting vaccines again.

Can stop fighting, hug brothers across channel drive wrong side road speak American funny accent, focus getting people vaccinated vaccines manufactured?

(Of course, EU personal beef UK incentive salt earth, learned since Trump, ordinary people useful idiots war elites...) Sanofi's already same, helping Pfizer 100M doses  non-indigenous poor people? conspirators said numbers w would go way elections. weren’t wrong.  ask sister? I, one, would rather shot water pistol 9mm. Oxford astrazeneca vaccine approved around world, loads countries across continents (bar Antarctica) clearly many regulatory bodies disagree assertion 'screwed up'.

You've clearly got weird personal vendetta vaccine realise end day save hundreds thousands lives people otherwise would died. bothers stories like many people jump conclusions work high schoolers do, work wages someone less worthy respect. many kids work help pay college/university many work help families keep roof heads food table. yeah, teens qualified, gotten CERB continue get it. deserve made whole too: AZ makes separate legal binding contracts EU UK. seems contract UK says AZ prioritize UK contract EU says prioritize EU. 


AZ states vaccines produced UK go UK vaccines produced EU go EU make sure everyone gets orded.

AZ tells EU cant fulfill order enough vaccines.

AZ ship 4m vaccines produced EU UK.

EU says, WTF? ask AZ explain themselves.

AZ says ""We best trust us""

EU says ""Hell no!"". Maybe bad wording, likely thn 163k like idea government hold 2nd doses reserve. Trump Adminstration claiming hold reserve along found true. One absolute biggest things problem zoom settling people, like professor, begin extend domain control literal bedroom. Kind crazy, ik common disturbing none less. Yea actually see anybody real life saying *It's piece cloth* like here. friends ready ditch masks moment can. pharma companies customers ideally want. UK could use vaccine currently obtaining. 

Was stated clearly back around June would take time build production. without prior investment pharma companies could afford ***start*** vaccines past clinical trials.

So choice order early, accepting risk vaccine would fail trials worthless. wait till closer end trials would delay production could ramp up.  Wish they'd done last year, too. Yeah, what's that?   kid already awesome CEO. There's ton comments ""media"" meant ""scare"" people every daily thread. Genuine question, trying sly, way ""media"" reporting since inception? 

Natural disasters, mass casualty events, viruses, 'news'. argument say ""we murder hornets"" move want omit completely? else would report on? people want news channels cease exist completely, truly trying understand people want. feel like we'll find sooner later: glad New York coming clean. Let's see states well volition. Seeing already vaccinated parents seems pretty reasonable. think things like international travel going crowded theme parks aren’t. I’m concerned people taking vaccines free pass think that’s Fauci worried about.  EU giving 65s basiclly giving biggest group's risk death, stop hounding AZ give let country's around world giving 65 EUs share 65s covered no? sounds fair no? EU harping fairness half year regards vaccine distribution saw 2 guys wall smoothie shop today. unmasked.
I confronted mgr asked served the? said cannot refuse serve unmasked customers. point BP going max turned away blacklisted establishment. 

How experience relevant op? People still refusing wear masks public one enforcing.
Even leader power lockdown, enforcing happen.many people give rats arse okay people needlessly getting sick worse. Others pointed extremely low rate anaphylaxsis fact surely asked this

This seems like scenario adult able consent considering routinely allow much riskier behavior (such driving interstates snow storm :P) doesn’t upside of: actually save lives exactly made unclear begin revise original comment make clear? say end next week, lockdown continues. knows? dont write vaccine experts approve vaccine yet clearly know they're tell do. AZ owned country. corporation wronged EU.

The EU's response? Wrong multiple countries NOTHING AZ's breach contract.

The UK Canada moral right (and responsibility) look citizens ban exports materials EU EU stops nonsense.  Sure, i'm skeptical hit target too. said, doubt would confirmed going way off. 

Also think 10M/week next 3 weeks provide assurance best estimate. production higher ship 2-3 weeks.  a, ok, thanks clarifying. that's helpful! many people feel priority everyone way they'd prioritize everyone  turned year plus people didn’t follow original lockdown rules. had, we’d far better off. still accept not-zero chance. 

0.00000000000001 not-zero, chances spreading COVID low, would still concerned?

I get sense people acting possibility, going probable possibility makes sense me. data comes back tomorrow says Moderna/Pfizer cuts least 75% transmission, what? think know better scientists immunology experts UK?

This serious question.

Why think spending millions using vaccine thought didn’t work?

Explain qualifications experience. Phew. I'll take bad news re: Astrazeneca, let's goooo! mom same! Felt like moderate flu. Dude lost credibility long time ago. Biden brought different adviser still respect. favor. AZ obligations contracts signed first; there. EU get special treatment.

And EU wants make sure moved bottom priority list suffer longer delays, raiding factories good way it. difference US UK signed agreements early companies planned production sites supply chains around realities. AstraZeneca knew export first 100M doses UK countries ensured production sites elsewhere meet non-UK demand. Similarly, Pfizer knew first 4-6 months production US could sold US, diversified production still allow sell doses worldwide. Moderna same. 

If EU moved faster negotiated exclusive rights doses produced soil, companies would likely set additional production sites elsewhere (Moderna producing Switzerland instance) rest world. EU late signing agreements never negotiated kind exclusive rights, unilaterally come demand essentially stealing countries already negotiated paid doses agreed upon schedule. 

Thankfully, sound like EU trying block exports order make slowness. sounds like want allotments laid contracts prioritized shortfall, comes non-EU orders, fair enough. know many people making argument

The main concern reopening teachers asked die altar economy vaccine days weeks away. good news need. Yep. Spread word. Wu-mao real thing. circumstantial evidence reasonable speculation anymore. real real gets.

BTW, sub likely moderated least Wu-mao. else would Automod censor (try removing hyphen, commenting word, checking allow Chinese state-sponsored propaganda sub (The Global Times)? Beyond strange ask me. mean, Nationalism. EU transnational :P Meh - blessing curse. Loved GOING old job, loved coworkers office environment. also advancing quickly deserved fell bit complacent mindset. 

Working home made easier accept new job offer elsewhere. Way stressful, much better growth. want go office though. 

Much different set coworkers, enjoy ability log couch 2 seconds later. commute, stress. take dog long walk lunch, make healthy lunch without full meal prep. 

I miss vibe office, outweigh
 WFH lifestyle me. Id get lot news segment clips cousins aunt Fox MSNBC CNN various medical professionals on, past 3 months saying vaccines coming/here gonna get better soon spring temp lower numbers, gonna normal end summer agree tiny bit enough people vaccinated. think itd accurate say end 2021 get people's hope's prematurely. know numbers looking better lately main issue alot predictions doctors reporters lately based vaccine rollout timelines rollout US comically mishandled dont think predictions hold weight vaccine rollout handled better mostly completed. even address looming economic depression dont think given things life normal soon matter much want be, wish would. Yup too, think everyone is. Biontech/Pfizer said likely deliver contractual obligated Q1.

If everything goes well supply Europe improve March enough April going forward.

It seems like 2 Month behind US. Awaiting first rate maybe next year? sending exchange large sums money, exchange nothing point prevent getting sick personally eventually reach point population protected via mass vaccination. vaccinated people basically act like don’t vaccine.

The difficult part going convincing people get vaccine afford flexibility lives. I'm certainly going following rules establishments wearing masks; long grocery store says need mask enter, I'll wear one. business, rules. 

But I'm vaccinated, I'm going start getting together friends. I'm going see (already vaccinated) parents. I'm going meet new people. I'm going travelling. I've done basically *nothing* almost year, I'm going start living little get vaccinated. Better shooting friends heroin. I'm cautiously optimistic Pfizer Moderna hitting targets, skeptical. They've delivered 65M doses CDC\*, promised 220M end March, that's \~155M outstanding doses nine weeks: 17M/week vs current 8m/week. order hit target would need double rate shipments **today**. CDC reporting next three weeks, shipments 16% 10M doses/week. sort jump completely possible, would require sort game-changing improvements capacity come online near future. 

&amp;#x200B;

\*Note CDC reports bit 50m doses delivered various states/healthcare providers, CDC's vaccine allocation data suggests Moderna PFizer made \~65m doses available shipment. discrepancy comes fact doses shipment, doses earmarked second-doses shipped states later. I'm OP, woman Lansingerland summoned letter tested corona, inadvertently received Pfizer vaccine. Staff GGD location Rotterdam Hague Airport check woman's details properly. result, ended injection line test went wrong woman, according GGD Rotterdam-Rijnmond, properly read appointment confirmation. impression get vaccinated. woman arrived test site, show appointment confirmation test. Thus, possible ended wrong also things went wrong. registration desk vaccination, confirmation letter must usually shown. However, woman her. computer system slow time, desk clerk sent woman ahead save time. vaccination, everything would woman well
Immediately shot, error noticed. GGD quickly called doctor. spoke woman, explained happened carried health check. According service, woman well. get second vaccine soon.
The GGD says shocked incident. ""If registration done carefully, vaccination could taken place. shows important steps must taken carefully. taken steps prevent happening weeks ago, Lansingerland, major testing residents began. 60 thousand people called participate, young old. aim study find spread coronavirus especially British variant. Residents visit three additional test sites Bergschenhoek, Berkel Rodenrijs Bleiswijk, RTHA residents access.

Translated www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)  think lot cases they've never actually lived major threat national scale like this, really sense proportion terms restrictions. Since actually live Wuhan Melbourne, find kind restriction unimaginable really think they're boat places.

Some also anti-lockdown/anti-restriction people arguing bad faith, consider policy acceptable completely ignoring pandemic. Yeah that's manipulative resort fear mongering. make people put restrictions even further. Britain placed export restrictions medicines could used treating covid: US vaccines. 

The EU done way earlier try play nice (not fun one that). current situation fuel exit movements member states (which obviously bad EU). interesting proof. possibility. option. Well speak American posh accent. Better? You’re missing point. Zero Covid quixotic quest. can’t done,at point, anymore could globally eradicate flu. 

It nothing rhetoric, everything possible vs impossible. 

Even could get entire world lockdown, need decades. Plus still unknown zoonotic reservoir guarantees eradication fools errand.  didn’t, control group vaccinated group members specific Israeli HMO. groups higher risk Covid-19 members HMO aren’t part study. “It may”?

It *does.* publicly released. EU EU blaming everyone else fuck ups. AKA... always do.  first 2m day hit next week absolute latest. right weekly average though. would regular onlooker, see substantial improvement case numbers, without riddles? article states teachers unions OH still balking getting vaccinated condition would return classroom. yet me, really seems like reasonable demand. classrooms kids day, know kids huge germ carriers. next top priority phase one. can't willing keep teachers safe, might well call society general shows value put educators whole education system.  prefer use *doses vaccinate x amount people*. Using EU has:

* 400 million Janssen (J&amp;J)
* 300 million BioNTech
* 202,5 million CureVac (Q2 delivery)
* 200 million AstraZeneca
* 150 million Sanofi-GSK (Q4 delivery sadly)
* (Contract signed yet) 100 million NovaVax
* 80 million Moderna
* (Contract signed yet) 30 million Valneva (Q4 delivery sadly)

You UK ""Canda"" make vaccines any, maybe need rethink policies toward nations need things from.

Nothing Next time, try cultivating friendships instead rudely dismissing partnerships due racism.

Friendships? EU actively got first vaccine three weeks ago. Maybe get 2022, unless course rotting fish research pays off. Cheers.

Lol ridiclous claim. UK far ahead already received huge amount Pfizer doses complete vaccination programme ahead EU internal capacity built dither delay months like EU Commission blind panic.

Cheers.  Friends let friends jab friends I'd give student thousand hours community service. saw info claiming opposite? happens many people refuse vaccine. tell people vaccinated can't see anyone whatsoever runs risk people refusing. there's fact theres ton anti vaxxers usa US hasn’t lockdown. states reopened since April. Go outside. “Both tested early month, understanding well,” Traxler said.


A 2-3 weeks spread detected two regions state already. there.


I know people want national lock need something. 


We already millions Americans possible long term organ damage, fallout going get worse nothing. Hafnaya = Referral non-Israeli peeps.  think need stop pretending vaccinated people shouldn’t see privately behavior normally so.

*Is* something people doing? That's got anything Fauci said answering question, clearly talking vaccinated around unvaccinated people. Oregon coastal north New Jersey. Yep honestly think we've turned corner, think find rate infection throughout country lot higher people think like 30-40%. Add 10% vaccinated ""herd immunity"" enough cut way spread. Add vaccinations 15% risk wrap. think month people finally start relax open up.    We're done yet that's certain. don’t know, I’m pandemic specialist. easily see close family members without masks right take right precautions, even never reach herd immunity, I’m sure grandchildren able around people without masks. regards ""months"" Biden administration talking regards general public vaccine access, Andy Slavitt MSNBC (I take care elderly parent leaves TV channel day), said projections ***don't*** include J&amp;J, AZ, etc. submitted EUA approval yet.

I know provides clarity different timelines, go. red herring whom? Who's gain financially stringing pandemic? Drug firms? Cleaning supply companies? Maybe realty companies (they're rung historic profits past year believe not)? China Russia? Vaccines really uptick well, almost like race. stop. roll eyes far. figured vaccines ok UK south africa variants news needs turn dreaded brazilian variant clicks. Biontech doses funded Germany ? would I?


Oh sort ""you know there"" Vietnam type defense? Whatever dude. work Starbucks know brain surgery either.

There's nothing wrong teaching, something need. Teachers complain much would suggest reading paper. use full set spike protein mutation, 3 (D614G-N501Y-E484K). Moderna paper, used 4 mutations (including 3 including Pfizer paper, D614G-N501Y-E484K-K417N), 2.7 fold reduction. K417N within RBD. Using full set mutations (L18F-D80A-D215G-∆L242∆A243∆L244-R246I-K417N-E484K-N501Y-D614G-A701V) lowered 6.4 fold. 

I know people consider encouraging test needed test. German expert panel (Stiko) really wants see lot good evidence favor vaccine recommend it. 

They still recommend flu shot everyone, 60 risk groups. Basically err side ""no vaccine"" unless case clearly ""vaccine better vaccine large margin"". (Only year changed mind pandemic, hoping reduce flu hospitalizations, maybe next year situation different recommend flu shot everyone again.) could also contract amount deliver. delayed UK EU... probably wait evidence citing death penalty. One largest counter arguments use death penalty fact people death row served penalty due unreliable evidence evidence wrong.

No one listen person screaming blood evidence. could stupidity/incompetence/negligence. could greed-related. could clerical error unrelated politicians (doubt). facts yet 2016-2020 Trump era, I'd rather wait actual facts come instead relying emotional triggers misled millions fake news. That’s valid point. generally good hospital one coming without mask. Enforcing rules part logistical challenge institution face. good, we're seeing downturn deaths/hospitalizations don’t forget one airplane shipment Pfizer vaccines went America. hadn’t happened, EU would approved vaccines months ago vaccinated 20% population now. problem curfew stop people choose ignore virus. want party dine etc anyways. tons illegal gatherings speakeasy bars/restos Paris. Plus, even smaller groups started sleepovers. curfew primarily affects people go party middle pandemic. Unpopular Opinion: AstraZeneca seems many problems US experts would better delaying approval turning attention distributing Johnson&amp;Johnson. hospitals run profit centers. No, I’m saying I’m disproving theory. I’m trying brainstorm you, think it’s fascinating idea see attractive individuals may take far claim wasted shuttering “beauty.” 

I’m wondering narcissism around much longer many would predict something ultimately fuels narcissism. course don't. mind, kids two doting parents eagerly provide multiple iPads healthy snacks every day. Two weeks second shot stop worrying masks. Sure I’ll wear one indoors it’s required I’m moving life. experts piss far I’m concerned! June. July. June.

But Merkel decided sign(organize) special EU agreement. epic fail. 

""First come, first serve"" work case. AZ got enough money time prepare production, AZ informed EU, delivery possible literally yesterday. Giving EU zero time react. EU enough power stop vaccine export(as US). exactly. There's 5% chance might still get COVID, there's 1 32,000 chance get severe COVID. get it, basically guaranteed die likely get mild case. I'm pretty risk adverse person, I'm 29 years old healthy. I'll take chances 5% chance get mild version exchange leaving apartment. start end August. UK paid June.

It's surprising difference yields UK vs EU plants. Redditors seem think starting production new vaccine 6 months easy peasy rather exceptionally difficult. long it’s mandatory don’t care.  Holy smokes! WTF going on??!

Now time this. produce vaccines give already. mean EU picks? EU almost picks UK excluding Novavax Curevac stage trials although curevac started pahse 3 earlier. stipulated time period Pfizer supposed deliver vaccine? Uh, yeah? real problem. Tell that's joke Well perhaps reported solely death generate article someone claiming cause covid. hell EU angry AZ? built facilities run AZ responsible? Lool bit complicated that. Like gathering data across different age groups tested seeing efficiency rates etc. imagine they'll also want get paperwork ready apply approval asap Yes, would expect potential logistic problems. talking whether owed something not. different issues. “Do want mix business pleasure Dubai? new one-year virtual working programme, live work beach,” says Visit Dubai “An added benefit program UAE residents receive Covid-19 vaccinations free charge,” says.  have. keep thinking I'm saying something I'm not. lol.

Why teachers special? yes idiot. know last year Germany 900 thousand people died quarter million died cancer? guess brazil twice size Germany logical millions die every year, think people lived forever? who's ""buddy"" buddy? curfew enforced? i've noticed states mandates, enforcement point mandate claim ""ineffective!"" shaming people risk evaluation theres is. mind calculating risks mind people get mad indoor dining 10 months one unmasked gathering time. like WSJ used silhouette clearly black woman depiction “overweight/obese” group numbers comparison race close could used 3 point.

EU's contracts provide EU wants, that's EU officials responsible procurement. disappointed Governor state letting people come state get vaccinated. larger population 65 already allowing snowtirds 65 jump slowing getting people taken care of. Therefore going take longer get younger ages vaccinated. straw broke camels back...I support state politicians support idea candidacy whatsoever. What's interesting AZ J&amp;J Adenovirus vector vaccines (slightly different strains/mods), AZ intended two dose regimen (but testing one), J&amp;J intended single dose (but testing two well). Unclear specific mods dosing changes made accommodate this, and/or real world difference comparative single two dose efficacy. Also, J&amp;J's original timescale single dose almost two months reach maximum efficacy, sure much spanner throws works. read deleted comment worries. worries either way- thanks kind words, you- together come stronger. much EU vaccine AZ one UK vaccine.

Fuck that's implied. said EU doses Pfizer produces. Pfizer business. No. really haven’t understood anything wrote? feel like talking brick wall. I’m bailing conversation. Cheers. It’s Atlantic actually hires good writers think themselves. Thank you, Joe Biden getting control! end sight! honestly expected 0 logistic problems delays? Tbf though J&amp;J originally say gonna release data end January IIRC also reports could released 22nd. J&amp;j week late data number UK study. reference 660 65 Oh, trust me, teachers care all. teachers screaming crying BLM yet turns poor, minority students negatively affected school closures? Whoopsies, problem! parents kids prepared potentially home school whim! German vaccine committee independent. decision completely unrelated European Commission. That's great, thanks link, I'd seen 75+ data.

So Pfizer undoubtedly effective 65-74! Interesting, I'd interested see estimated cases last year over. I'm sure 25M confirmed. Either way, realize bad swine flu was. think right.

And bet private sector drive lot that. remember state masks mandates I'll put there, really take seriously back February. stores started requiring entry changed saw masks increase community.

So stores start masks optional (whenever is), think government catch up. really don’t see general public’s behavior ever revert normal point, year super bleak media coverage.

I personally avoid talk restrictions eventually lifted people household, sends panic mode think implies I’m considering letting guard down. 

My mom thinks even considering going without mask it’s longer government mandated naive “asking trouble”. Last 3 weeks so. close! still occurs Pakistan Afghanistan. neighbor works eradication said mounting comeback places even covid. pandemic erased least decade work :-( first comment applied science deniers... specify left/ring wing. 

In second comment made generalization conservatives appeals authority. see two blended together, intent say conservatives opting vaccine.

In reality though, find 100 random people online denying risks covid, anti-mask, anti-shutdown, anti-vaccine... know side aisle majority people would on. general would agree, except fact virus likely one many animal reservoirs (such mink). even everyone got vaccinated, whenever immunity rate gets around 60% due waning immunity new population growth, likely see virus come back potentially mutations allow bypass antibody immunity  year theoretically builds year prior. missing foundation, going affect rest building. this? Dark skin healthy close equator. healthy UK northern USA. Trying pretend makes difference medical nonsense. say generous nice guy. Phrasing. won't, it'll effective. worries. everyone else data age group aswell, emergency-approved it? Taking guess instead basing decision facts? Covid can’t eliminated wild animals carry it. reason flu never go away. Misleading title. EU vs Astrazeneca. stricter? People can't leave house 6 pm Window AC units don’t provide ventilation fresh air cooled space. works unitary units, circulating indoor air. I'm parent work psychiatry DISASTER children. Many people realize schools also provide testing, special ed, services like speech therapy kids going without.

I'm homeowner I'll never support teachers referendum. 2019 huge statewide rally order increase pay. want essential highly paid yet push comes shove, they're demanding get work home jammies unrealistic goal met, claiming ""babysitters."" one asking babysit, they're asking important work properly educating kids.

I've office others entire time. work home. one gave choice. somehow teachers think they're heroes also exempt working environment poses risk them, like every nurse, uber eats driver, grocery worker last year. statement backed data. lack evidence efficacy over-65s right now. Let's hope US trial data AstraZeneca available soon includes older folks.

The ""Stiko"" (commission decides vaccinations Germany put statement) political institution, scientists. Well planning reopen justifying looking decline holiday peak (which outlier) even 20% population vaccinated, hide details future failure somehow.  don’t. I’m sure knew point can’t remember. commonality type A? data? didn’t Oxford ensure enough 65s clinical trials? disease primarily impacts (hospitalisations/deaths) group. getting suspended? leftover vaccines! Well expected everyone else approved recommended age groups - guess everyone else dispute AZ moment... see that. know local district claiming every positive case acquired community school. Gathering family friends unmasked, etc. Regarding manufacturing J&amp;J vaccines started till approval. Regarding EMA approval kind worries since EMA tends take much longer approve(last ones approve pfizer). significantly slow initial delivery supplies I’m stupid, don’t vaccinate anything healthy, probably even healthier vaccinated people. I’m antivaxx, live antivaxx lifestyle myself. don’t recommend new vaccines anyone though. Interesting, hadn’t heart that. didn’t covid I’m aware of. tested beginning pandemic worked home since. whole family gotten vaccine sister mother-in-law reactions. didn’t COVID aware of, nurses. I’ll research that. make sense you’ve built immunity prior vaccine due covid exposure you’d severe side effects would essentially immunity booster. Someone medical knowledge chime there. problem exporting AZ vaccine produced UK. Since UK it. exactly what's happening booster developing though ( might wrong) ? means ""there enough data actually report elderly patients"", others noted, European studies (UK EU), AZ apparently joint P2/P3 elderly left safety reasons guess, means get sample old patients FDA study comes US.

The original idea usps deliver free masks every mailbox revisited. way teachers treated fucking travesty. Hopefully old Joe help way soon. Copy pasting UK already export restrictions.

This disingenuous. One companies contracted produce vaccines UK AstraZeneca. contract pays UK-based plant operate produce UK's order vaccines (after point sent elsewhere). Likewise, *exact thing* already happening EU, AZ setting plant Belgium, solely used make EU vaccines. contracts involve use 3rd, pre-existing AstraZeneca facility Netherlands allocated (relatively small) batch vaccines UK's order, longer used UK's orders.

Meanwhile, EU-exclusive factory held (I believe issues French supplier NovaSep). Instead dealing this, like UK dealing plant's holdups, EU basically floating idea engaging vaccine piracy UK requisitioning legally bought, domestically produced AZ vaccines, blockading legally bought Pfizer vaccines. Literally still trouble getting mine prove it’s medically necessary think everyone agrees keeping schools open paramount importance-- question factor health safety in.

[Am crazy? see front one concern new vaccines would take 6 months produce &amp; another year vaccinate everyone. could maybe cut time half didnt test &amp; could get everything 1 shot instead current 2. every new vaccine another year lockdown &amp; everyone already losing goddamn minds. also know people still anti-vax there's way they'll take untested vaccine. 

but also hope. walk around depressing hope knowing real risks convince non-believers. actually think gloom &amp; doom Source? Could distinction doses allocated doses delivered. doses set delivered week next allocated may arrived yet. discredit anything say

That might true you. Sounds excessively pedantic me. liability. That’s schools need open ASAP incorrect comes ""ISA"".

The EU demand Germany etc. negotiate purchase, normally EU makes medicinal purchases, national health systems do.

Those countries handed negotiation EU voluntarily  ""EU solidarity"" seen good political ploy time.

Of course meant Vogonian bureaucracy handle negations, are. Well, people likely severe adverse reaction vaccine supposed excluded, far excluding people likely go anaphylactic shock, saying vaccine unlikely cause it.

Even excluding people, rates extreme. I'm sure information complete.

The EC claims UK plants mentioned contract explicitly among places vaccines would produced without hierarchy production sites.

So according claim would told AZ would get 80 million doses produced four plants company reduced doses EU suddenly said UK plants could used UK completely separate production.

Now EU produced AZ vaccines sent UK bottling facilities EU UK used days announcement made.

That essentially point contention. AZ told UK would use UK plants included plants offer EU least according EU.

It also implausible claim think back many doses wanted produce would way ahead UK's EU's ability vaccinate. Stocks react speculation. 

Their stock prices likely (I haven’t looked personally) started increasing announcement vaccine trials fall everyone cashes speculation. 60% South African variant sounds comparable AZ vaccine “regular” covid. I’d feel safe vaccine. course spread cancer. People make sell products people consume get cancer. England largely responsible developing AZ vaccine, fair getting doses.  Truly amazing, human spirit do! Novavax’s Covid-19 vaccine 89 per cent effective works new variants virus, according data published clinical trials UK South Africa. 

The US biotech said trial partnership UK government’s vaccine task force showed 95.6 per cent efficacy original strain 85.6 per cent B.1.1.7, circulating widely country study. 

In separate phase 2b study South Africa, Novavax found vaccine 60 per cent effective participants without HIV, none Covid-19 cases vaccinated group serious. vaccine work well HIV-positive participants, however, dragging overall efficacy South Africa 49 per cent. 


Stanley Erck, Novavax chief executive, said “first vaccine demonstrate high clinical efficacy Covid-19 also significant clinical efficacy rapidly emerging UK South Africa variants”. 

Novavax — received $1.6bn Operation Warp Speed, US government programme designed expedite vaccines Covid-19 — started US trial end December. Bolsonaro got elected knew would bring Brazil down, managed worse imagined, imagined terrible things. hope country anymore views Covid becoming minority. majority Americans sick tired shit. moving on. Maybe also?  Cuomo got explaining do.... Reddit.. like people complained went Texas, restaurants open, masks waiters, etc. It'll Brazilian variant SA one lol. Like video game boss keeps recharging health. 22m first doses right, many 2nd doses? yeah true. India got support Russia that. Sorry, I'm really tired Pakistan vs India debates. really divide us brought literally everything south asian. guy sucks, take one trip r/philadelphia see clearly got weird personal vendetta vaccine realise end day save hundreds thousands lives people otherwise would died.

Pfizer stans raging know pricing unethical. Lashing Pfizer tested three epitope changes RBD whereas variant total 21 mutations. another (independent) paper shows mutations RBD SA variant contribute half immune escape. example knockout 27% samples tested RBD mutations knockout 48% mutations taken account hefty neutralization degradation rest samples (have look tables page 7).

 [SARS-CoV-2 501Y.V2 escapes neutralization South African COVID-19 donor plasma 

So, basically Pfizer tells half truth, best. anticipate Moderna Pfizer won’t 50%+ effective even though efficacy higher overall? motherfucker Cuomo win fucking Emmy?? kills per nursing home award?? Evil empire strikes back serious cases vaccinated groups, small sample size tough conclude anything data. going brutally honest. year shit, care much people. Covid fatigue really set mental health time low. Post holiday surge subsided, vaccinations occurring building overall immunity, people ever infected means less people virus infect.

Turns out, one year 9 students. 
Yup. barely dodged sexual offender charges lost license first years out. mean Novavax applying approval soon update?? Moderna Pfizer vaccines effective South African strain though, 95% effective Grab grab grab. me. selfish, lawless, amoral attitude disgusts me. focussing UK, focussing exports net meeting deliveries promised. EU also big stake AZ vaccines, Belgium example would second biggest supplier, J&amp;J. EU trying force suppliers meet promised. consensus seems surface transmission rare basically requires someone sitting coughing package.

But washing hands still good for, like... general life hygiene. Yes, let's ignore fact multiple regions healthcare infrastructure overwhelmed. area never made news ""overwhelmed,"" yet New Year took several hours get transfer man literally heart attack. Even right today, place answer phone sister hospital. 

Yes, people street look fine. bodies piled corner mean everything fine. tell full confidence regions still suffering lower quality care due stress COVID patients system. UK secretly negotiated *exclusive use* AZ plants UK exploits *shared use* Pfizer plants EU, diplomatic problem. would longer contractual issue fault would lie AZ, would lie British political decision-makers. 

No one would faulted stated front would produce vaccines UK also warned EU make arrangements produce EU vaccines EU (due Brexit whatever). seems like EU discovering UK AZ plants producing UK vaccines (until contract fulfilled). 

Something definitely fishy feel like know enough facts. AZ publish contracts we'll know more, seem pretty certain position. excellent point. getting released   I'm looking forward vaccine stuck random highway someone knocked window said could vaccinate me, I'd need *lot* proof I'd go along it. It’s called sell news. rumor NVAX would get funding make good vaccine made shoot thousand percent year.  Might good enough EU, almost certainly good enough UK, think good enough US yet. Get ready 4 5 shiny, new media strains/COVID variants roll time Novavax J&amp;J production distribution starting. NYT, important caveat w/ S. Africa study: 
Novavax’s smaller trial found vaccine 49.4 percent efficacy overall. (The company reported *about 6 percent trial’s participants positive H.I.V., H.I.V. positive, vaccine 60 percent efficacy.*)

60% efficacy African strain excellent, especially coupled less severe disease experimental group Roman Empire nationalist, nation could join equal terms. set Romans apart people time. describe tribalism certainly lot era. went office 50 people, many knew liked office three people, I’m one third switching out.

It’s painful AF social person what’s timeline approval novavax? Yeah, makes sense given published numbers. Moderna supposed deliver 100M doses March, another 100M July. Pfizer 120 April, 80M June. Plus another 100m end summer. hit targets, May US around 160M Pfizer doses around 130M Moderna doses, enough 145M inoculations. point, likely vaccines generally available (though perhaps still hard find), collective immunity high enough amount return normalcy warranted. 

&amp;#x200B;

Also unclear J&amp;J/AZ/etc would make significant dent predictions. AZ J&amp;J serious manufacturing issues moment. I'll never understand stock market, hope make money :) believe current consensus surface transmission possible pretty rare. mostly spread air.

Washing hands preparing food still good idea though prevent illnesses. like people forget ""drama"" *going kill people*. main problem AZ 

That's true. Setting production across continent newly created vaccine short time hard estimates production always tentative.

Both Pfizer AZ missed delivery estimates US UK Q4 2020. instead throwing hissy fit public conflict, govs involved threw money problem helped companies resolve whatever needed.

The delays EU happening EU incompetence, late ordering spent 7 times less per capita US UK helping ramp manufacturing. colossal EU screw up.

Now instead owning extreme incompetence lashing everyone everything. Especially watch success invested early invested envy.

Yes, AZ promised. that's exceptional EU deliveries AZ particular, especially given circumstances. Yes AZ could informed delays earlier, EU monitoring? thousands EU bureaucrats even doing?  ""best efforts"" requires diligence , untimely communications diligent. want 75 million next two months. much production. even close room compromise :( sounds accurate given people long term symptoms virus long gone. 

I know teenager symptoms months getting hit virus. part trial? unblinded told got real thing? dad also huge baby that's fear vaccine needle soreness know I’m going regret but...

Do honestly believe people uninformed stupid understand facts even research ten seconds suddenly change mind Bill Gates explained them?

Come now. isn’t going happen. people ignored, like are. Yes, implied context immunity ""vaccine immunity"", parent comment would see declines due vaccinations. I'm sure 44% residents testing positive immunoglobulin antibodies June increased unmitigated transmission scientists using data estimate 76% October antibodies disease tapered strongly ""wild guess scientists"". 

Scientists make wild guesses publish scientific journals like this. told say that? There's freight version 747 carry containers. Containers exist carry sorts special products. yes air-freighted. Even without UK US airforce transporting it. either clearly would essential medical supplies.  imagine many Astrazeneca doses Q1 actually delivered Q2.

I know looking J&amp;J get none doses Q2 anyway, least get doses AstraZeneca Q1.

Same Sanofi, supposed delivering vaccine even work, EU anger them? Latvian here! wanted say us idiots. eager get vaccinated return normalcy 🙌🇱🇻 Actually one study, French one, seriously flawed. 
The rest studies came later FDA already approved .... without real evidence effectiveness like another version flat earther? really wish US India get long better future. never understood US decided allies Pakistan India (well understand disagreed logic).

What mean talking mutations needs yet studies saying ""It might work every vaccine"", need real data wishfull thinking headlines still 100k hospital remember correctly, inevitable many die next weeks.

Sure corse do. That’s already confirmed many carry problematic set mutations mutations give virus advantage.  task force saying next 6-14 weeks going brutal. don’t know people seem think otherwise. It’s complete fantasy land ignore it. Vaccines sometimes similar effect - make future infections much severe. Maybe likely, least worse. suppose negative effect possible vaccine trial. states going export single dose order vaccine fulfilled. AZ, Pfizer, UK EU sit discuss fix this. compromise EU gets UK produced AZ doses, guarantee export Pfizer, Moderna J&amp;J (which UK doses produced EU) go smoothly would best. Perhaps world lost pandemic pandemics can’t beaten. 

Has world ever truly pandemic “winning” apparently stopping incredibly transmissible respiratory virus becoming pandemic? near certainty vaccines reduce spread virus significant amount. produce antibodies kill virus chance multiply much. question whether prevent spreading virus 100% (""sterilizing immunity"") something slightly less 100%.

EU exports vaccine. fcking fair. Enough enough.  US approve data? Actually would say HEALTH biggest reason, considering biggest factors associated hospitalization obesity, diabetes, hypertension - conditions American people droves, brought one themselves. think that's problem, UK trying keep it.

What think EU population going pretty annoyed US UK start street parties, still locked up, likely going happen. Given already bunch riots week restrictions live, could interesting, think everyone wants share blame early other. people forget 60% still good. prevents severe disease 100% time also perfectly fine. worth also suspect confounding factors SA trial (it's low number anyways). following train thought, every live stream person dying, live stream 99 individuals whose COVID cough transmitted well, no?

After all, point educating people showcasing IFR/CFR essential. showing negative outcomes misinforming people. wanna see J&amp;J SA data. solid data variant, would great news. feel like need real world vaccine data variants anyway opposed bioinformatics. Might efficacious think. get full vaccinated, odds weeks later still test positive get barred travel?  mean stop COVID? within top 3 leading causes death US several months. still see people little splish-splash hand wash taking crap. 60% solid vaccine. I'm actually concerned violence happen U.S. fully eliminate ""lock downs"" us vaccinated. Things could get real ugly, real fast. Right, healthcare continued overloaded brink many areas whenever lockdowns eased/ people started ignoring them. Fucking come on, use brain. AZ: We're going make 31 mil

EU: *freaks out*

AZ: OK, make 50 mil


EU: *happy noises*

It's looking like AZ played EU me. Get side accept shit sandwich making think he's avoided even bigger shit sandwich. know, travel today living perpetual fear like guy. two water bottles 80 cases one bar one largest super spreader events seen worldwide past year. happen? bad news press release unrelated vaccine. trial found 1/3 South African subjects already antibodies original strain still got infected developed symptoms new variant. Additional data natural immunity great E484K mutation (South African strain):

“ approximately 1/3 patients enrolled (but included primary analyses described above) seropositive, demonstrating prior COVID-19 infection baseline. Based temporal epidemiology data region, pre-trial infections thought caused original COVID-19 strain (i.e., non-variant), subsequent infections study largely variant virus. data suggest prior infection COVID-19 may completely protect subsequent infection South Africa escape variant” Reduced efficiency better efficiency. Still win book. penetrate vaccine  Broadly speaking, subcategories prioritization scheme has, slower vaccinations go. Also, try prioritize many groups people once, defeated purpose prioritizing. 

For example, US, phase 1-C includes: 


\- Anyone 65 (53m)

\- Anyone 16 high-risk medical condition (110m)

\- ""Essential workers"" (87m, neighborhood 60% one previous groups)

The US neighborhood 265M people aged 16 over, means somewhere neighborhood 80% adults eligible vaccine phase 1C. point may well open vaccinations anyone wants one away red tape. people's brains, including parts affect judgement, finish developing they're 25. increasingly acknowledged experts adolescence continues person's Probably going wait bit US results many doses United States exported otherwise given away another country date?  cares say? want travel somewhere buy ticket so. think EU rustle two three experts consult 27 countries? Again, night day communications Pfizer AZ. AZ knew already early trouble UK contract would major delay EU, say already last year? Land vote, people vote. NM teachers taken priority group state pushed open schools :) make sense me, want open cool probably fine let teachers get vaccinated. want prioritize teachers, also fine, let stay home. think water bottle sufficient thorough rinsing. expect reduction deaths even efficacy 90% elderly (although early data Israel showing even elderly). 

I gave number. Deaths measured hundreds per 10 million, tens thousands per million. Let's revisit 6 months see closer. Depends apply approval. looking long took pfizer get approved I'd say 2-3 weeks hopefully.  choose whether buy product. Something tells 2M dead COVID choose get infected die. people refuse vaccines mostly media's fault. Vaccinated? matter, still can't anything.  50 different strains deadly according media vaccines effective? get vaccine then? take long ""drop presents"". Technically he's correct, getting vaccine specifically free pass travel - people already free pass travel. called freedom. people listened probably wouldn’t lost many lives. 

But public health official, know difference people people do, make recommendations latter. 

You liken abstinence sex ed. Nobody would get pregnant spread disease people followed it, doesn’t jive reality human nature. mean eradicate disease. Pigs fly first. wonder many posters bots bought paid AZ. entirely sure tbh hopefully. J&amp;J come next week means 2 vaccines Dumb question: Oxford Vaccine AstraZeneca same?

No severe case. Yes. Report says privately owned Nursing facilities higher fatality ratio.

Privately-owned Nursing facilities transferred funds shareholders instead using buying PPE.

Privately-owned Nursing homes test staff. 
They also found nursing residents died shortly getting hospitals counted. 


They found forced employees work even though covid.

They also found Privately-owned nursing homes knowingly withheld information NYSDOH.

Or maybe, maybe, inflated forecasts get money EU, fully knowing able deliver.

You think know they'd 50 million doses short ????

That's 50k 500k short. basically half order.

Fuck shit. 

The EU investigate fine AZ bankruptcy.

So tired corporations running fucking world. say can. contract confidential made public sides agree. EU asked made public.

For reason AstraZeneca would rather not. ""best effort clause"" relates company's ability develop produce vaccine. example, GSK/Sanofi failed best effort. AZ not. ""Best effort"" mean best effort one customer worst effort another customer. check see comment person said touch face. Quelle suprise! 430k deaths really bad. 

Say again, slower. 9/11 every day. deaths single year entirety WWII.

I'll give benefit doubt, really hard interpret position pro-death.

So increased drug overdoes suicides what? UNCONTROLELD GLOBAL PANDEMIC? need treatment things too, course! one saying give people. failing make concerted effort control pandemic giving *tens hundreds thousands* people could die COVID. Best distributed less 50% allotted doses vaccine, would nice leader department. think anyone suggesting wearing masks public times heck normalized, would opposed idea wearing mask sick around others? smallest inconvenience reduces likelihood getting someone else sick. rational people: much people aren’t showing hospitals droves nobody gives shit. That’s need results severe cases were. 


To nearly certifiable: never end single 30 year old South African variant super spreader waiting send millions hospital one breath. barely ahead RIGHT government plan. weeks, better par UK added benefit approved vaccinations proven actually effective age 65% data fudged. Kids virtually risk actually getting sick virus, like literally one million. risk vaccinated reason keep things locked wear masks behalf kids. Yes, doesn’t make sense prioritize group people perfectly capable staying home people must go work. first group going go straight back normal, taking basically precautions. possibly expose second group even more. 

It bothers bunch retirees going hitting road travel many front line workers still waiting vaccine safe job. ordered kind rough timeline expect deployment? overconfusing things friend. contract politicians made plans citizens made dreams.

My dad IgA nephropathy late 30's onset; sister ended developing issue 60's. Obviously genetic predisposition triggered virus. seems like COVID may slightly different causing general autoimmune response opposed triggering something also predisposed to, concept definitely well known. like Fauci lot, send messages like this. incentive getting vaccine...presumably means return normality life. vaccine literally enable travel much safely. stop me. soon get vaccinated I'm resuming travel (at least domestically). still wear mask follow regulations aim travel places social distance well (beach resorts Caribbean, Florida, etc) stop me. soon get vaccinated I'm resuming travel (at least domestically). still wear mask follow regulations aim travel places social distance well (beach resorts Caribbean, Florida, etc) day now. us like masks. time selfish asshole stop wearing get shot. data current Pfizer/Moderna vaccine South African variant? talking inevitable booster shot made (for truly vulnerable)? Yeah parents got first dose last week told pharmacy literally holding 2nd doses freezer don’t know week week many even getting doses. don’t want risk anyone getting 2nd dose time.  know needed see crap reason. 

I must hate myself. flu every winter? broadcast hospitals then? effective treatment groups fucked dosing regimen too.

I'm science-based approach vaccines, fucked way many parts science trust conclusion all. KNOWS else come light yet. Nope, definitely game-changing think 10 million shots divided among 50 states. Seems like kind drop bucket point. Heard where? go away D00m3R know what, vaccinations slow predicted (Paris already speaking stopping first dose vaccinations entirely), could well Argentina, Turkey Brazil, among others, catch EU. Poor countries started vaccination much later. fact, Serbia point almost double vaccination rate EU. unlike EU countries, bound geopolitical grudges, rely Sinovac Sputnik.

What EU done fuckup massive proportions, specially considering one affected areas world priority. happened national, elected, government, heads would certainly roll. obscure, unnacountable unelected EU comissions. believe science, too. science said ""kids can't carry virus"" kids getting sick, kids getting sick, I'm preeeeeeeeetty sure they're carrying virus.

Kids suffering, lmao gtfo here, we're talking MAYBE couple months virtual learning. One measly semester cause harm.

Oh, work school, 10% students sick covid. Science proven kids get covid, carry people. like literally every virus. return Emmy.  tanned UK super hotspot like usa trails

And pziler like Amazon eBay actually stole 52% ate side chicken tendies spring break, elderly/at risk people vaccine, least opportunity it. cut hospitalizations deaths quite bit. Came back home Portugal. God experience last weeks were.
I could physically get tested. directed go Lisbons biggest hospital. Santa Maria.
I arrived 13:30, 30ish people line front me. went home 21:00. Cold, hungry, thirsty pissed off. Ten people still front me, couldnt get tested.
I rebook flight, day came home slight cough headache. old roommates tested positive, friends.
The kicker? Half positive October. probably positive asymptomatic too, got symptoms.
This probably second round well. Much less shit first. Ok Speculation around EU planning thing companies can't keep EU orders fulfilling orders countries, Pfizer deciding cut exports interim re-tool plant. 
If EU wants fuck around countries supply( they're row UK well), hopefully Canada UK limit exports reagents lipids used vaccines delay manufacturing.


If US sudden decided limit exports vaccines PPE start pandemic, I'd agree. Correct I'm wrong, Trumps EO passed well vaccines began roll position known quantity. EU done U-turn towards Trumpian Europe first policy process telling Canada go fuck slap fighting UK despite export agreements already place. 

 

Here's looking forward struggle massive amount migration they're going see people flee conflicts effects climate change along boarders Africa tune thousands, millions people. Good luck that, hopefully west leaves devices take view isolated continent. want say legit best resonant thing think I’ve read since pandemic began. really articulated I’ve feeling didn’t know actually say article talking per capita, Israel. can't believe professor call baby crying!

SB parties issue, think SB celebrations pale comparison Thanksgiving Xmas. know many people invite grandparents SB (although I'm sure exist).  simply false. proved safe proved effective.

However sample size evenly distributed age groups. lead data inconclusive people age 65+.

However given effective people 20s, 30s, 40s 50s, one would expect also effective 60s 70s too. prove study.  No. recent example nationalism EU railed against. adopting similar tactics. Trump example demonstrates hypocrisy

Your post silly. age nationalism shows ignorance.

1. Israel, many volunteer, fact, seek places give leftover vaccines (sometimes end day health centers call people age come). Many people can't wait government reduces minimal age (right 35-40+ ages 16-21) refresh queue website like fucking glastonbury. therefore statistically likely people high awareness also get vaccinated, turn, would lower rate infection gen. pop anyway. kind comparing apples oranges.
2. likely people get vaccinated, try ""keep safe"" even more, - could gotten fake vaccine keep save get infected 3 weeks vaccine shots would show reduction infection. 

Again, points think about, without diminishing awesome effect vaccine stuff. Also worried California lift lots restrictions tomorrow. talking America? Sweden population 10 million America 330 MILLION. so..... going ""slow"" process. YFI Thanks 👍 confuse. Emails.. talking billion dollar contracts wartime right, already free pass travel. talking someone EMT experience license, perhaps explain little words: general policy remotely second guess decisions EMTs make field kind one-off service provide? know states like PA base hospitalizations California College, University Adult education people next line. places already bring given vaccine. right 75+, 65+ im areas. fact despite fact nearly announced remote education fall. lol no. can't pearl clutching ""OMG EU would *never* block exports! *dare* suggest slander!?"" also admit think fine go around threatening bully people.  
 
If repeatedly threaten something, people going assume might well willing it. That's basic logic works.  fuck ups trial, I'm even surprised. deaths lagging indicator mine. entertain thoughts awhile literally brought IMF’s “World Reset” timeline government’s world converge, eliminating debt taking right assets predisposed working essentially nothing (incarceration camp kind scenario). 

I really don’t know get crap internet without infringing people’s “free speech” it’s driving crazy. UK grant eua.

Oxford front runners really messed Pfizer dropped data November 18 got FDA approval December 10 CDC recommendation December 12 first doses sent following day, probably like EUA second half February first doses March. people wear mask properly anywhere. everyone goes schools, colleges, cafes, parties give single fuck corona. truth pandemy russia. super depressing. WTF retention? Since he's retained, asshole retain bonus? Recycled clickbait article. hard wear mask? don’t care That's...not what's happening. I'm sure that's true -- certainly pre-2020 pandemic standards, everyone hardcore willing shut economy -- least claim cared untimely deaths, barely even blinked idea telling everyone stay six feet apart anyone outside household, indefinitely. 

No one ever tried before, know previous pandemics deal fallout death economic damage, there's real playbook dealing may unleashed social distancing. saying don’t know, don’t travel. Err side extreme caution. Probably early March. child 16? not, no, everyone wants offered it. Make vaccines. real interactions strangers acquaintances restorative ways talks close relations aren’t—they much lower stakes lower stress! Mods completely useless. literally political issue. JnJ complete different animal. 

AZ timeline Novavax point. Hopefully Novavax running trial appropriately able shoulder burden AZ leaving behind. quite sure level protection expect disease overwhelming impacts greater 65.

Why UK government test antibody levels shots? Yeah don’t think seem understand people aren’t going refuse comply. Maybe small pockets areas won’t way people comply ever necessary. mention cities likely actually start enforcing fines penalties generate revenue small amount establishments individuals refuse comply. 

The problem 50% United States willingly wants get vaccine 50% refuses, causes issues. elaborate point 

Fortunately, impossible elaborate something ridiculous. Ethically new vaccines must least match efficacy old vaccines place.

Of course pandemic rush different situation. 25-30M figure (which I'll admit back napkin math) would include J&amp;J (single dose) Pfizer/Moderna (double dose). 25-30M *new* recipients, 25-30M shots. still pretty substantial would mean there's enough jab 10%+ US adult population every single week, first, second, dose. course there's lot could happen pretty theoretical exercise. Moderna shot last week slight itch arm wee bit ache. Frankly like mild aches, something else, register. 

I feel anything administered pain seemed reminiscent achy arms childhood shots. Perhaps stated, body reacting (in good way) terms firing immune system.

I read second dose sometimes causes reaction. Dr. Faucci said felt ill 24 hours receiving second dose. so, small price pay able get back somewhat normal existence - although per guidelines continue mask social distance wonder risking death every time venture - especially new contagious variant.

FWIW, read one prophylactically take aspirin drugs prior shot might impact antibody response. advice based studies among children less antibodies produced children given pain killers prior shots. theory since drugs anti-inflammatory immunity trigged form inflammation, somehow lessens effect. medical personnel recap article read. Cave Junction middle nowhere Siskiyou Mountains -- reason people would want/need go get [Oregon roads narrow windy, generally get lot snow imagine lot snow plows people good driving snow either.

One crappy thing may noticed snow northwest often hovers right around freezing get rain melting snow day refreezes overnight. (Portland particular also notorious ice storms due collision wet air flowing Pacific cold dry air coming westwards Columbia gorge.) Well exactly. EU start trade war vaccines. Glad agree. Yup Well, numbers freaking low confidence intervals ridiculous.

Hopefully UK going publish real numbers soon.  Sweden never left normal. okay minimal restrictions.

That hope. professor ridiculous. I'm grad student/adjunct professor pretty prestigious private university, LOT discussions students drastically different home lives need make things fair everyone. Many kids university very, wealthy, others scholarships already struggle feeling like fit in.

For example, told students prefer keep Zoom cameras on, requirement. made joke sometimes can't bothered make bed put away laundry, wanted people feel comfortable putting home environments display option keep private. see guess that’s happens half state mountains plateaus. found mother, saw past Saturday, tested positive covid. flew town Monday morning going fly back Friday night I'm unsure do. EU ones choosing argument publicly. intentional. specifically meant rile emotions shift blame parties cover EU's fuck ups. working perfectly them. snow storm paralyzes traffic NOTHING getting point point B. ambulance, tow truck anything else.  epi stabilize period time wear off. “Very worried”. Yeah man they’re worried variants we, course, find they’re deadly still respond vaccines. Learn pattern recognition friend. 

And realize callous nature said poster answer this, exactly it? change it? healthy stress something control level? That's probably good sign. Hi! anyone know long covid lungs still show ct scan? Thanks! know stands xmas UK plants getting running ~530,000 vaccines came EU plants (Germany Holland said).

There nothing know states EU plants EU doses only, assumed nothing concrete said like UK - AZ deal. blocking Pfizer vaccine delivery UK nothing punative reason all. likelihood can’t spread it, thus extreme lowering cases Israel many got shots What’s first USA? think closest one r/MURICA Okay, makes sense.

2. anywhere near sea level here. high country even low places. means people vaccinated spread virus? friends healthcare workers got vaccinated. asked could come sure worked. EU build vaccine factories. made contribution. I'll follow whatever rules mandated venue. numbers off, UK closer 12%.

UK average rate last 7 days 354k day US vaccinating rate per capita need like 1.7 million day. million per day nothing population 330 million, rate would take nearly 2 years give everyone 2 doses.

So UK ahead accelerating away. exactly point?

No data published SD/SD group. Germany already   Indigenous people poorer often worse health compared Canadians ethically imperative vaccinate first. Canadian, really hope you’re right...

/s Nope. Rebuild facility increase production may lead temporary delivery problems. Everything described reliable US company everything going mostly according plan. Nobody cares. 

But AZ keeping silence till yesterday. nobody knows fck situation delivery. May half, may quarter, may third. May March. May June. 

Also nobody knows reasons interesting outcome. Why? 

With Pfizer everything clear. Rebuild. 

With AZ nothing clear. EXPLANATION late. Ok, two months late. two months 1st March. Could expect promised deliveries since date? Yeah done exclusively age without regard profession cormorbidity Seriously wtf ‘tough love’ authoritarian, ‘Darwin awards’ type insensitivity?? afraid cling strict, principal-type rhetoric?? “failure accept personal responsibility.” guys actually talk like this, tough nails perspective tend fall back make better rest? Yeah think age-based early stages (65+) suspect we'll go right everyone getting next month two. got second Pfizer shot last night. I'd heard colleagues taking next day shot (I can't afford to) took prophylactic ipuprphen last night, morning. side effects report apart soreness site injection. (we) blocking exports. european committee said checking exports better (or all?). week's time BioNtech/Pfizer AZ announced reductions deliveries. AZ one especially seems shady. said deliver 80 million vaccine next months, suddenly gonna supply 25% this, time still delivering elsewhere without reductions, plus knowing EU factories shipping doses UK past. EU made mistakes, Astrazeneca severely overpromised best plain commiting fraud breach contract. 
It seem weird go check factories game monitoring what's coming bit more. Yeah apart trial. Yes unblinded us two weeks ago, shocked got vaccine. Absolutely zero side effects, soreness, nothing. We’re Hispanic helps all. Colombianos That's states honest. want reduce strain healthcare workers, vaccinate people likely need hospitalization  explain one. [Coronavirus (use Google Chrome translate) notice certain areas (Ultra orthodox Arab towns) extremely low vaccination rates compared rest country. low vaccination rates translated high case counts. also see breakdown infected, majority infected, people either yet eligible vaccinated became eligible vaccinated last week.
Hospitalizations deaths lag behind infections means majority elderly people serious condition infected got first second dose vaccine. UK different dosing regimen countries, that's likely increase efficacy rather decrease it. 

Very adult vaccines gap 4 weeks less booster. Generally months years. 

You want response booster come memory cells rather remaining antibodies cells first injection. wonder higher rate anaphylaxis first dose verses second dose. can't find information anywhere. would encourage look elsewhere possible. Pennsylvania worst country this. really get appointment dose basically ready go Full dose full dose approved, trials run half dose full dose afaik either/or? Seems like both/and.

Yes, eligible, like half state latest guidelines appointments  commission quite important German vaccinations though. politicians follow recommendation, AZ used 18-64 year-olds Germany (for now!).

Maybe US phase 3 study shed light efficacy 65+ approval could extended. Best effort means promise best fulfill order give scraps. would EU upfront +300 million get scraps? make sence, best effort means trying meet goal fewer consequences something goes wrong controll.In kind world would accepted sign contract ""best effort"" get +300 mil say well explenation without details 60% order. reason might legit damn dropping ball communication part.

And thank every day! AstraZeneca trial United States might yield useful information that. 

The UK three-month gap shot spacing that's going quick data. Even flops used off-label. issue lack data over-65s bad results.

The US waiting own, larger trials making decision. don’t blame you. guess country doesn’t care many businesses go under, economy collapses mental health.  Headline wrong. Nobody blocking use. reason, commission recommended used people aged 18 64.

They say used age groups evidence efficacy actually exists. meanwhile many countries reported essentially zero cases flu year. media stop nothing drive clicks onto fear mongering articles like that; threats never even come close materializing, pretend never said rather calm peoples' fears.  Still, may start doubt efficiency, midst pandemic killing mostly 65, vaccine stopped particular category... someone dealing logistics getting vaccine doses out, sympathy people. give exact doses, exacting timeframe, gets complicated. Sometimes eligible person doesn’t show appointed time you’re left dose go bad hours. point look someone give doesn’t get wasted.

It’s possible people shitty cutting lines wealthy donors, may best chaotic situation ever-changing guidelines. appear know contract better AZ’s lawyers, I’m sure EU fine then. There’s also data Pfizer vaccine older 75, yet people still vaccination plan.

This stinks. thinks family bears absolutely personal responsibility?

That's absolutely thinks, that's absolutely wrong. course AZ blame make contracts. idea people think dispute UK EU.

And first dips contract really matter all. clause apply two parties signed contract. 

Any contract coming different parties affected clause different contract. blaming government actions family members took? relaxed distancing restrictions doesn’t mean meet up. failure accept personal responsibility. EU approved either though, understand point? Aussie here. live largest state (NSW) &amp; we’ve cases past 7 days 2 ‘large’ outbreaks totalling 100 people testing positive mid December. whole council ‘county’ strict lockdown Christmas, whilst everyone else limited activities 10 adults houses. cases, visitors 30 permitted homes, 300 weddings, restaurants bustling again. Schools start tomorrow usual holidays people back offices days week. Masks frontline hospitality staff public transport. Feels almost back normal.

Total deaths state since beginning pandemic 55 population 8.1million... 17 aged care many others related cruise ship. right here. still walks stopped helping mental health got cold sun sets 4:30.

I want smoke joint friends damnit. headline misleading, block use way, recommend used people aged 65, evidence efficacy age group. 

People free use 65 year olds, say currently data actually helpful age group. would nice read headlines ""Vaccine Effective South African Mutation?"" legitimately supported medical research.

And herein lies entire problem. soon word got variant SA, media went all-in ""is vaccine going effective?"", pure speculation studies done yet. spent literally weeks stoking fear general population, know good news like going top story. going get buried ""more articles"" sections websites positive stories like make less money. point surprised US even end using AZ. That's big Shhh, fit EUs narrative vaccines gone UK. Sorry it’s South African variant that’s 80% resistant. never approved it, that's mean. long take EMA get necessary data? assume countries can't afford Pfizer Moderna jab elderly regardless Mumbai’s excess deaths around 0.1% pandemic. don’t think unreasonable think rest country around amount Covid finds way spread rural urban areas. United States lose 0.2% population yet 40% think flu. agree government must protect idiots themselves, idiots still bear responsibility. Swine Flu viral infections long term effects, nothing new, keep lockdowns Eh news really bothering much. endless work home cycle.

Just got make till spring. keep telling myself. Worst case immunity fade bit quicker we'll need booster year  think saying generous person.  Tracy Latham said partner 12 years Darren Fisher, elderly parents uncle left isolation fleeting visit government relaxed social distancing rules allow households areas meet one day.

And people *by far* likely ones end hospital ICU and/or die. don’t *need* vaccinate everyone else return normal. even approved yet Indeed. overly ambitious availability dates, louchy data releases, non-submittance said data EMA, late contract signings, last-minute delivery shortage announcements, bitter vaccine lead us put crisis. invested mRNA vaccine production offset this.

Seems like US hoping AZ J&amp;J deliver tbh, EU. German authorities issued draft recommendation AstraZeneca vaccine Covid-19 used people aged 65.  statement Standing Vaccine Commission Robert Koch Institute, Germany’s main public health agency, said “insufficient data currently available ascertain effective vaccination 65 years”.   reason, commission recommended vaccine used people aged 18 64.   body said two vaccines approved EU authorities — BioNTech/Pfizer Moderna — judged “equivalent terms safety efficacy”. point ?

My point person replied wrong since thing claimed would happen actually already happening. EU keeping production internal themselves.

I applaud UK exporting ingredients whatever are.

This AZ/EU feud vaccine issue UK EU. AZ overstated capacity made contracts fulfilling. think anyone deny that. mean even sent doses UK, UK around 8 million people vaccinated (including Pfizer) AZs production shortfall 50 million EU? belief AZ never capacity produce 80 million doses lied teeth EU get deal line. western media hitting new levels cope daily [Screenshot politicians always trying pretend don’t make mistakes. probably hundreds people countries cannot vaccinated whatever reason, children 16, etc. mention conditions applying incoming travelers. no, answer work, unless want exclude unvaccinated ever going countries again. ""Vaccine DNA affecting lives. 20 patients thought family tree ending them"" Fact:USA,Brazil Mexico Covid deaths India staggering 1.3 Billion population!!

Infact India lower number deaths per 100,000 Population Finland!! lmao  basically US pretty much rule vaccine used guess. don’t CHENNAI: Even India sending Covid-19 vaccines part vaccine diplomacy, truck companies planning export vaccine transportation trucks number neighbouring countries well markets Africa. Tata Motors looking export reefer trucks transportation Covid-19 vaccines markets like Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka African markets, said Girish Wagh, president - commercial vehicle business unit, Tata Motors. Already Daimler India Commercial Vehicles Volvo Eicher Commercial Vehicles also announced export plans vaccine trucks.   another region enters fray, signs contract, demands supply UK diverted EU instead diverted ""first come, first served"" relevant. I'm pretty sure EU would disagree that.
The EU slow buying range vaccines. really wish global pandemic could brought countries together, instead driving even larger wedges them. is. know much testing new variants vaccine require? know basically designed first gen weekend based virus's genome, need full scale trials boosters/variants?

It's crazy hindsight vaccine right away. ever get point know much skip human trials could nip next pandemic bud. know that. Thanks information. mean guess alternative use 65s even efficient would much less impact deaths. could 5-10x less efficient 65+ age groups 65 would still cause bigger drop short terms deaths give older groups.

Imo UK invested bit heavily Pfizer/Moderna, they're slightly ""eggs one basket"" Pfizer novavax J&amp;J rleases data. Hindsight 20/20 though see UK focused cheaper, proven Oxford vaccine type largely unproven expensive mRNA vaccines hey still allow air travel outside US. could go wrong?

Get LLNL modeling team it. basically nailed r0 covid back March.... would suck. vast majority deaths people go hospital 60. would vaccinate elderly, would drop much. Hopefully countries use elderly even entirely scientifically correct. emergency. It’s pretty good case extremely young population help weather massive infections. 50% population 25. average age 30 crazy low. issue UK received 4m EU another 75m tricky one. Pfizer used first AZ became available, health workers continued get Pfizer (as limited quantity). AZ became available that’s currently used mostly 65+ groups (while health workers continue receive Pfizer). Maybe people understand 95% protection means.

We know right move another year more.  Pfizer AstraZeneca vaccines used elderly non-elderly target groups similar extent? lied tried rationalize it. Hmmm, that? Anyway, time paid foreigner trying lecture (and spread propaganda public platforms) goes Palestine Israel. one that's deflecting you. Get lost. equally embarrassing! Super pissed that. took sweet time concerned negotiating cheap price crisis costing us millions euros day mention lives! would nice. We'd vaccinating dogs cats now. German don’t know feel this.

Why blame EU ? UK looking citizens. EU. AZ fucked contracts AZ take blame find solutions. situation EU go ""Oh shit. AZ fucked up. Guess better nothing""  That's genuinely quite astonishing. Data limited efficacy nothing suggest ineffective. fact immune response line age ranges tested, suggesting work.

When considering cost/benefit vaccinating enough virus impact genuinely unbelievable.

The thing imagine intend keep Pfizer back give rest AZ vaccine. 

If they're going instead significant reduction amount vaccines available almost unspeakably bad decision.

Thinking tin hat on. probably much data available right time AZ supply EU increases. could way push blame slow rollout onto manufacturers rather accept blame poor planning. That's great news!!

No, instead conducting PR exercise divert blame countries like Spain run vaccines. competence! magic EU suddenly 3 month grace period need start vaccinating 65s AZ vaccine. long strong supply AZ vaccine EU, yep, 3 months.

I've rejected every conspiracy theory I've ever come across inherent trust scientists (I've gone journal peer review process sides many times), disappointment tribalism shown many countries last 12 months makes question impartiality statements one first time.  see now: urban zones nothing faceless people marching sidewalks. Rural suburbs: enjoying life. Even government relaxed restrictions Christmas, people need common sense SARS-CoV-2 read memo supposed stay away.

With supplies? none, pitiful hundred thousand week.

The choice whether vaccinate 10+ million vaccine likely work (but without fully completed trials age group) wait keep seeing 1500+ people die day. Uh, no. second shot people instructed stay clinic 15 minutes, go back day. They're also told vaccine take effect 1 week second shot. study looked rate people tested positive days 7-13 second shot, compared people similar health age vaccinated. It’s make people doubtful time development vaccine. Many suspicious whether like they’ll right even arguments rely on.

And read comment again. Don’t jump conclusions right away put shoes said probably want wait period see what’s happening people already got nothing went wrong 1 year so, many would consider vaccine.

No, EU simply wants get doses. love people Reddit think they’re actually hurting feelings. He’ll vaccinated unmasked enjoying life. lot others won’t that’s them. expert would assume bring herd immunity closer. treshold herd immunity estimated assumption immunity distributed equally across population. however young people interact mostly young people vaccinated , spread slow down.

* Employers make Vaccination ""condition employment"" ?

* so.. deal high percentages people refusing ?

* also.. public large refuse vaccination ?

""having enough available vaccines"" half (maybe less) battle

* logistics effectively efficiently distribute also important

* convincing high enough percentage people actually take another. 

We need upwards 80 90% herd immunity. Numbers I'm hearing somewhere around 40 60% volunteering take vaccine. That's enough. No, think many reasons make vulnerable covid also make less able access vaccine lower trust medical community (which, let abundantly clear, fault medical community) careful say protects infection. 31 people tested positive probably sort symptom got tested. order find much protects infection would need test 163,000 people. test another 163,000 control group. way find exactly has/hasn't infected, opposed testing symptomatic.

This supposedly one Oxford studies get information.

Edit: general shows vaccinated might get less infections. potentially still get infected less symptoms.  Measles literally infectious virus known clearly idea talking probably take break thread zero context people's personal lives beyond one Reddit comment masks, decided live super privileged life! Bravo. suspicious good. Saying stuff like ""developped less year"" wrong.

Waiting exactly? Milions people across world got vaccinated. Nobody died cause it. Milions got covid, milions died.

Thats need know.

Maybe not, right EU beurocracy looking lot worse UK government embolden, ""leave"" campaigns countries. like n95 production. can't wealthy countries create factories this? really baffles me. Fuck end 21. Partly normal April, fully normal early summer. vaccine pssports needed either. Yup, I've got bottle hand sanitizer local place going make gin alcohol changed last moment. Smells like pure corn alcohol. CEO disagreeing.

I mean, implying he's necessarily lying, else would expect say? go ""oh sorry guys, that's true fucked big time""?

I guess could make similar argument towards EU, hard time believing EU would gone lengths truly believe right. gone far beyond normal levels political bickering. EU sending vaccines out. better. I'm tired seeing articles vaccination efforts weak, really aren't. Yeah, course. nevertheless makes stupid. worse tyranny force man pay want merely think would good him. Fauci needs fired. vaccinate oldest youngest regardless ethnicity, sex, etc. We're getting India's SII think good PR. However he's right currently scientific consensus points higher herd immunity requirements. 

We could actually end vaccinating large parts population hospitals get overcrowded. Sort dangerous tipping point insufficent herd immunity people absolutely letting guards down. Thank Pfizer delay less 200,000 doses. 3 months waiting see real shipments? wish Canada could.. know, vaccinate people. far, going well all. course summer. That's addition we're already Article written what’s happening UK apply US. 
If vaccinate 60% hospitalizations low we’re ditching masks least they’re going government mandates, might well thing. You’re going majority public protected majority says “eh, well. It’ll fun remember life enjoyable.”
We’re hearing virus experts whose lives dedicated viruses. downright giddy wearing masks. That’s rest public.  One way another day day restrictions done year. 
Put another way: governors want re-elected next year also move things. doesn’t happen it’s covid time people aren’t allowed live lives.  mask mandates based emergency orders. vaccine coverage real threat mass hospitalizations emergency doesn’t exist. really worst kind person “Protects infection rather disease” means something specific. (That wasn’t tested here.)

You could say definitely protects infection test everyone vaccinated. Otherwise you’re seeing people sought test ... going mostly people symptoms (plus contact traced due definite exposure). 

Without testing everyone there’s always possibility (a few? Many? Most?) infected didn’t seek test didn’t symptoms/disease.

It’s important know difference preventing infection 92% would huge - aren’t infected can’t transmit it, herd immunity easy, spread hard hit countries drop like stone.

Unfortunately still don’t know study.  I’m hopeful, need wait it’s actually proven rather guessing. Yeah thought “it medical certainty” part really weird Yea downstairs Neighbor parties every damn night.

I’d hope Oxford scientists getting honours least.  supply problem infrastructure issue

Almost vaccines need stored minus 70 difficult roll quickly, limiting usefulness public health terms.

The size country matter. smaller country less doctors, nurses hospitals give doses, that's look per capita figure. Likewise larger country would expected capacity produce vaccines.

All grandparents parents vaccinated could happier UK response. think equivalent means sample size. think mean equivalent ways like age profile, pre exisiting conditions, etc. It’s better cautious say can’t spread virus turn wrong. he’s 60 fairly healthy numbers already drastically side. bad one wears masks here. :(

Seriously, live upstate. Every store go to, *at least* quarter shoppers/employees either unmasked wearing incorrectly. Someone please tell premier Quebec, withholding delaying distribution second doses because... Reasons. Never ascribe malice adequately explained incompetence. No. OP, got doses Pfizer. Zero reactions either. Injection side even less soreness flu vaccine did. Also talked many friends family who've gotten both. Zero reactions them. Wide variety ages, blood types, health levels anecdotal sample size. ""drop"" really. statistics normally works.

The 95% confidence interval initial phase 3 trials (the one Pfizer said efficacy 95%) 89.96% ... 97.57%, new 92% value Israel falls well within range.

In words, data Pfizer really said ""we 95% confident real value somewhere 90% 97.5%, peak likelihood around 95%"".

So new 92% value strong accord older data.

TLDR: 1m first doses posted 1.5m total. Dope point attitude going become widespread.  outcome vaccine “cool won’t get sick. Oh btw, omg, didn’t tell you, three masks better two. hold couple years” people going say fuck credibility non existent. vaccine provided cost price everyone.

The EU wanting less cost would course issue. makes sense Bidens appointments energy well fauci able freely give middlefinger antimaskers already changed course tvirus

Why sense valid mine? would say yh not. mum shots. Personally side effects much worse first shot although arm pain alot confirm: decent amount fun still last year lockdown skeptic. Actually didn’t anything wasn’t legal &amp; within safety precautions still found fun social things do. Much better judgmental social shut in. keep going back forth even gonna acknowledge lie whole discussion started from. said EU decided block exports. Maybe want true bad lying yourself.

This powers transparency, Belgium wants stop something exiting country, anytime. putting pressure AZ Pfizer. also UK either(as much trolls try make EU-UK beef), EU AZ. 

Pfizer make dozes end February ahead schedule 100m end June US EU. That's reason behind, scale up. there's nothing say whether asymptomatic positive cases data presented 

Israel basically tests 3 types people:

1. Symptomatic.
2. proximity known case.
3. Whomever wants whatever reason (smallest group).

Majority tests conducted people category 2. statistically probable either vaccine prevents asymptomatic positive cases include asymptomatic cases. state still restaurants closed such. We're well. New York Times says nationwide cases 35% last 2 weeks! One theory herd immunity may closer thought asymptomatic cases getting immunity. Another people vigilant vaccines close end sight. think main thing practical viewpoint, whether 8% needed medical care, especially hospitalization? Western nations deal ppl suffering basic cold/respiratory illnesses, tsunami ill ppl need advanced medical intervention that's brought whole medical delivery system knees. Canada contract J&amp;J purchase 38 million doses. delivery schedule attached purchase moment. read lines he’s saying, he’s saying probably safe travel you’ve hit two weeks past second vaccination.

But he’s public health authority first, individual care practitioner. recommendations apply entirety US population aggregate public health perspective. 

What he’s saying here, summarized, “we don’t yet know likely infect people even you’ve full vaccination, advise traveling know.”

Is realistic expect people adhere that? don’t think so. Would good everyone **did** adhere that? think Quite frankly don’t see EU put Brits citizens. tables turned they’d blocking exports too. graph article! hope too. want whole mask business behind us.

I seen comments sub want norm normalized, don't. Everyone ordered tonnes doses everyone. contract signed 1/1/2028.

Thanks making feel old. local schools South Carolina in-person 5 days week since October. hope teachers able get vaccinated soon. It’s fault family fault government allowing it. Without pieces wouldn’t happened. Don’t know you’re downvoted... literally started at/ near wet market fuck someone fuck back would make sense UK continue supply EU wants pull bullshit like this. Yea, least realizing CDC can't report higher numbers Moderna would; CDC can't report doses produced. least show CDC report 60m doses suggested did, they'd reporting doses even manufacturers said produced.

Now, question would CDC report lower Moderna. comes back one responders posted: reporting lag different reporting types. CDC numbers *what allocating available states*. federal government stockpiling anything, lead time receive dose provide states. glean lead time CDC's dataset lists allocations doses made available states jurisdictions order against. Weekly first-dose allocations provided states Tuesdays; jurisdictions begin placing orders Thursdays. doses ordered states, shipments begin following Monday. entire order may arrive one shipment one day, course week. Second doses opened orders Sundays, appropriate interval two three weeks later according manufacturer’s label, shipments occurring jurisdictions place orders.

We expect CDC's numbers exactly match Moderna's Moderna saying ""This number doses provided US government"" CDC saying ""This number doses provide states"". similar, same. Judging Conservative media spinning proof Fauci know anything confirms /s end last sentence. 

People simplify scientific process really frustrate us all. considerable discussion source virus closer identical naturally occurring examples are, less controversy likely exist. Yes tone changed. He's obviously trying de-escalate situation. That's he's repeating previously inflammatory commensts. 

There's point discussing further. They're releasing contract. We'll know soon tomorrow. Germany’s numbers going too. half cases compared Christmas. Didn’t UK pay 3 months earlier that’s got order first? think it’s opposite. able function never blame matter truth. Thanks! Checked out. r/flipping looks especially helpful already joined it. :) Texas heard used way entire life. harsh ""fucking idiot"" usually, ""haha, said something incredibly naive endearingly stupid."" think varies person. husband's workplace (maybe 20 people) one person went home early first shot one person called second shot. husband side effect sore arm times worse flu shot. (Pfizer) Fort context, need 70-80% immunity halt disease via herd immunity makes sense DPA take week shows changes. Back March April saw picture Reddit someone hung banner interstate overpass saying ""Cuomo killed Grandma"". hope want run political office going haunt him. they're not. Right change. say people see friends family members without masks, they'll probably stop too.

So many people say keep wearing them. fear gone, people find non-COVID things worry instead. Ah good ole “let’s create two tiers society approach”. Wait sorry “vaccines don’t prevent infection” line. today tone AZs CEO completely changed.

Europe getting 31 million doses anymore, more. 1 charge delivered February, suddenly 3.

Apparently also claims made interviews repeated anymore showed personally instead representatives it.

Seems like visit belgian plant weird magic there? Yep. Called month ago. infections inevitably lead enough immunity slow spread. Could gotten faster, states uniform approach. love it. It’s guise “can’t” actually power impose policy. worries, blocking sometimes feels like sane response. know much trust given data saw Israel basically largest scale trial live. would probably trust numbers little bit right now.  Canada contract J&amp;J know of, sooner everyone US vaccinated, sooner US likely start allowing vaccine exports again.

According Bloomberg tracker, Canada contract 10M doses J&amp;J vaccine. hope Canada United kingdom block trade EU. got fuck themselves. UK ordered large supplies Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J vaccines addition Astrazenica one Sanofi Merck ones materialize.

The Pfizer AZ ones vaccines currently delivered, though. Significant supplies Moderna J&amp;J vaccines due Spring. Sorry teachers! superintendent definitely slug board meeting state capital. Keep masks eating(if afford to) foreseeable future! Understood. hope Europe come resolution soon. dispute isn’t good anyone. 

Stay safe there! 🙏 Analogy nothing like cinema though, issue production issues occurring EU affecting ramp up, they've cut forecasts. Meanwhile UK, ramped earlier, full production, contract AZ signed UK guarantees fulfillment contract export UK plant.

If using cinema analogy, bought 2 tickets screen 3 folks screen 4 who's movie working sound, want come sit screen seats left sure it’s conditional herd immunity hard hit areas brings numbers down? quite. bounds better Pfizer case.

Although statistically irrelevant, equally irrelevant. going mass test large % Israeli population kind time frame, resources prioritized dealing pandemic?

You going get kinds academic studies expect normal times, something need understand.

Israel going significant wave, almost testing efforts directed controlling outbreak, making studies. one time resources kind studies waiting for, either take data try make much possible, knowing confidence lower one would like, stay completely blind. really hope kids wear masks school come fall see dollar signs eyes According local paper, worse that. _The Belgian government_ block exports now.

The Belgians among understand massive problem. give people hope. says stuff like this, it’s totally demoralizing. People aren’t anywhere close perfect mostly selfish. Stop ignoring reality telling people do. reminds preaching abstinence instead actually providing sex education. Yes, we’d safest never leave houses see others, it’s reality it’s life worth living. say crap like big part population wonders, exactly point? Especially didn’t explain would need happen able travel vaccine timeline. focus advising vaccinated resume normal activities carefully like “yeah nothing changed, stay home.” Trump didn’t invent nationalism... it’s thousands thousands years old. good 😌 news 🔴🔴 I'd imagine says best efforts, fine print may define best effort actually means. decided pissing one largest markets world good business plan, decided try rectify situation working EU rather digging heels Others covered well responses -- basically, viral infections general number one cause autoimmune disorders whole; remotely unique SARS-CoV-2.

How make sense? 12 hours post 2nd shot began feel really fatigued feverish. Moderate body aches chills. weird feeling cause felt like getting sick (body’s immune response kicking in) chest congestion anything would normally accompany something like cold flu

I spent rest night bed feeling like complete crap

Woke today foggy mind, headache really sore arm feel worst passed now. 

Is worth it? Yes absolutely knowing body building immune response covid. safety vs efficacy. Safety take priority includes know somehow Pfizer Moderna emerged data far riskier unknown platform there's equivalent questions two vaccines.

Well yeah less cautious trials put higher degree risk older people took part. I'm particularly surprised happened USA tbh.

The exact data clear soon conclusion US trial UK monitoring questions go bed. true, may gone bit overboard comment I've extremely frustrated entire situation lately. Elementary teachers also trained technology way trying get 6 9 year olds successfully navigate things computer.

I get sucks everyone everyone tough spot. turning everyone sterile, like Bill Gates wanted, word that? /s I'm going keep wearing mask years come. asthma, wearing mask public kept breathing allergens trigger asthma. decades, used use inhaler twice day, everyday, used inhaler three months. Wow! Hope works out, don’t think you’re putting cart bit horse?COVID exceeded dire predictions every turn, selection pressure increases, I’m concerned may facing really nasty resistant variants spring summer. Good luck though, hope instincts wrong. US ordered 300M AZ doses. Originally ordered 100M Pfizer Moderna, subsequently negotiated 300M (600m total). Also ordered 100M J&amp;J 100M Novavax. 

The EU actually took similar approach. 400M AZ, 300M Pfizer, 160M Moderna, 200M J&amp;J, 300M Sanofi. mean, 138 deaths month vs 3k deaths month pretty big difference. many articles said similar things, use misleading titles. actually read title?

""The study Pfizer scientists University Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), *has yet peer-reviewed*, showed less two-fold reduction antibody titer levels,""

**(2-fold would 50%, correct? they're saying 100% useless)**

they saying vaccine less effective 50%. even 20% would lot. thats 1 5 people still getting infected.

""Its findings limited look full set mutations found new South African variant.""

""One possible reason difference could Pfizer findings based engineered coronavirus""

I think article still implies need remain vigilant &amp; safe

I never saw articles saying vaccine work, offer less protection. line everything said. saying 20-50% reduction. saying thing basically. Fauci said might need 90%, pushing timeline back further

Fauci stated said get people take vaccine.

 Fauci said, “When polls said half Americans would take vaccine, saying herd immunity would take 70 75 percent … Then, newer surveys said 60 percent would take it, thought, ‘I nudge bit,’ went 80, 85. need humility …. really don’t know real number is. think real range somewhere 70 90 percent. But, I’m going say 90 percent.” Don’t mean Ron DeathSentance, NY nursing home residents blood hands!

So, uh, long. Fauci conditioning accept masks distancing long time. refuse accept him.

In less conspiracy words, Fauci moving goalposts again. make sense countries times new variants arrived scene. i.e. people coming less likely infected people already country, what's point? really paying attention, impression time Belgium government. Problem solved? Small talk acquaintances lead new friendships. feels really strange depressing gone whole year without meeting anyone new. Would work better young? know makes sense theory data indicating young people benefit vaccine? username suits well!

Thanks optimism! probably time. controlling manufacturing would report worst possible numbers C-level.  Stonks talking whether diseases spread spread, guess thanks contribution. someone hospitalized, assuming due severity process administer treatment, walking around spreading variant. virus mutate wants, nowhere go long patient quarantined correctly. Yep they'll report something like ""covid lungs look like smoker's lungs"" ""there long term effects covid even without symptoms"" giving absolutely indication often happens. There's world difference something happens 10%, 1%, 0.001% time. media can't bothered. reporting factual standards nonexistent. NPR reported somewhat similar situation transport truck nurses stuck blizzard. Instead letting doses go waste stuck snow, vaccinated stranded drivers. 

Femi Oke, journalist Al Jazeera English, reported grocery store something heard quick announcement anyone wanted jab come pharmacy. She’s 50s seemingly healthy. let anything go waste right now? 

“My target demographic isn’t right now, I’ll toss stuff” going get people killed. Put shit darts start throwing willy nilly! mean still see capitol riot news still data release scheduled next week. Fingers crossed Monday. Sounds right. probably ""find"" million doses market export somewhere. 4-6 hours I'd guess, fine time went home.

Got shot 4 times, 2 arm.  ""slowly""?

If someone vaccinated protected week later second dose.

So want slow then? They’ve saying can’t get rid Covid entire time, hindsight, we’ve always chance eradicate now, always inconvenient. It’s rhetoric climate change deniers use, used claim humans don’t contribute much climate change can’t change habits, rhetoric it’s late may well change habits. joke world kept getting fed things. 4200 people died yesterday US celebrate yet. true media always bias bad news gets clicks attention.

But extent keep drumming bad news, ignoring good news, also distorting risk facts, crazy. Polls show people think something like 1 6 chance dying Covid get it. actual risk 50 healthy something like 1/50th that. People also think risk evenly spread throughout society fact highly concentrated age 65+ health conditions. short public, policy makers, misinformed concerned wrong things. Exactly, production issues exposure ""oh friend fever got week"" way heck going take seriously see people gasping last breaths, alone, hospital full severely ill dying people.

Outside particular age demographic, reality vast majority infections. unreasonable think. Bloomberg interview Pfizer's CEO said April ahead schedule US EU. said US supposed get 200m doses June 30th they'll get April 30th, EU said.

US 200m orders Pfizer they'll probably order more. EU 600m.

Edit: also Sanofi produce 125m Pfizer/Biontech vaccine sometime 2nd quarter, EU. insane watched pandemic Reddit since December last year South Africa. First Americans give shit. suddenly everything America suddenly everyone shots. one country single shot. Banning AZ vaccine exports one thing, banning **ALL** vaccine exports, including Pfizer absolutely nothing AZ's alleged breach contract insanity. 

It's equivalent burning entire city spite person burned house. no. dads pharmacy started giving vaccinations yesterday :)  sweet ad revenue. article weird like week everything used unmasked everyone find well normal. new normal normal. huge deal, best. resurgence. One three French residents don’t believe vaccines safe. 

French people burning 5G towers, unlike people UK soon birth data, (women known pregnant enrolled trials, volunteers got pregnant trials, earliest would conceived late July early August give birth around April/May), nice pregnancy data them.

""TL;DR: Yes people phase 3 trial got pregnant vaccination. difference rates pregnancy vaccine placebo groups. one vaccine group trouble pregnancy course study. also tested female rats find problems, either fertility pregnancy.

The Pfizer vaccine FDA report give nice summary like this, report 23 people became pregnant trial. report 2 adverse events related pregnancy, placebo group.

Both companies say continue monitor pregnant people. general, know reason vaccine would affect fertility. believe ever before. mRNA technology new-ish, radically different would reason believe fertility would affected. hand, growing evidence covid-19 *does* affect Yes, really stupid. applies people drive drunk without seat belts. Mods need sticky somewhere. Pure gold. Trump able take credit economy Obama left mean thank daddy Biden saving us Covid??  “All 3” things listed? basically everyone besides moderna pfizer mRna still understand ramping factories mass produce shit instead shutting factory makes upgrade... time critical, genuinely understand anything else taking priority point.  money would saved returning normalcy (or close) sooner would absolutely make initial cost.

Glad progress made, least.  gf teacher able get it, teachers works either, dad scheduled to. UK supply manufactured - plants Oxfordshire doses sent Germany Netherlands last year process called fill-and-finish, involves putting vials.** done plant Wrexham, creating complete UK supply arrangement, AstraZeneca sources say, impact production problems EU vaccine manufacturing plants like early AZ doses sent uk taken sense EU supply. dad started giving vaccinations pharmacy! proud him. i'll try keep within mod rules possible - even know right place post - way get conspiracy folks see light/realize they're spreading misinformation? 

my mom is, um, *not* supporter current administration. gone conspiracyland last 12 years, worsening last 4 so. 

the day told course COVID going away new administration office - ""just like planned"" - increased vaccine distribution ""nothing case numbers going down."" said take vaccine ""Fauci's connections Moderna."" connections, ask? ""Well, know, Fauci CEO Moderna back 70's first founded he's still heavily involved today!"" They're it, dontcha know! 

Well, quick 5 second Google search showed [totally \- Moderna founded 2010 Fauci never CEO he's even board directors. appears misinformation started fringe sites passed along youtube video. 

here's catch - mom refuses entertain news considers left-wing. so, basically it, like 2 websites 1 certain news channel. total lost cause, anybody success using methods? think California's notable cities either center southern half state, point might hundred miles west southern Nevada Arizona. idea fun though, I'll admit. Read article? Seriously, gained level control populace going hold last breath. 

The tide turned, winning fight. lady came pharmacy work ask making vaccination appointment. told booked mid-February company open dates. response was, ""I'm 60 heart disease, can't wait February!"" Uhhh, okay, sure want that. wonder that's case every vaccinated individual Israel. Well least vaccinated individual Pfizer Moderna mRNA vaccine. hear Chimpanzees remarkably identical humans, ""genetically speaking"". consortium found chimp human genomes similar encode similar proteins. DNA sequence directly compared two genomes almost 99 percent identical. DNA insertions deletions taken account, humans chimps still share 96 percent sequence. EXACTLY point, Linlea? expect kind headline sky news. haply 45 % less... Vaccination already going turtle speed EU surely must downsides oversanitization? Looks like French people preparing tenth revolution. lost count French revolutions. determined vaccine prevents transmission yet?  Thanks volunteering!

Don't worry. restrictions shot (masks) limited pubic folks catch up. summer, probably need that. 

For now, vaccinated, gather vaccinated friends relatives, give hugs, marvel medical science. It'll soon. Getting first dose 2 weeks!! excited!!!   read article? Xlear, sale Amazon probably pharmacy Note panel headline involved approval such. usual job decide vaccines ""recommended"" thus covered health insurance. reasonably likely vaccine approved everyone EU level German policy may may follow panel's recommendation deciding gets vaccine.  Yeah, penicillin shot. largest amount shot I’d ever gotten (one large barrels) liquid apparently super thick. decent bit muscle felt like someone shot ass. shit killed couple days, limping could lay back hurt butt cheek badly. infections adverse reactions that.....was fan. 

Smallpox one worse reactions, completely normal apparently. injection site looks like gets infected days come, tenderness/pain pretty decent gets worse got fever. Lol fan one either. Nice! wonder means we're getting fat update today  realise AZ one vaccine company making money right? mess.

Good luck whomever sorts out. worry Pfizer vaccine. Unlike AZ, Pfizer &amp; BioNTech good reasons delay delivery. Mainly massively increase production new plant Marburg. unlike AZ , Pfizer &amp; BioNTech communicated timely diligent manner also applied shortfall equitably across customers. short Pfizer vaccine still delivered. AZ hand prevented exporting anything. mad Israel? indeed fast / smart / selfish enough set exclusivity clause contracts.

Looks like fixing fix right now, wipe superior, smug look face. Well protect getting sick possibly permanently injured dying disease that’s going around want wear mask rest life go right ahead many others longer mandated. Andrew Cuomo responsible deaths residents nursing homes sent sick patients to. Rather apologize like have, ideally *resign* due causing deaths constituents, wrote book great job controlling pandemic. might generally opposed Governor Baker's pandemic response, blood hands, never claimed hero. Thanks detailed explanation EU done u-turn decided block exports

The EU done thing, simply monitor goes on. Stop lying. UK ""Canda"" make vaccines facilities.

If any, maybe need rethink policies toward nations need things from.

The UK insulting EU daily. Canada insults US like big deal. Oh well. Sorry kids! parents definitely slug warehouse factory. Keep face laptop(if afford one) foreseeable future! ^ guy thinks there’s never plague restrictions rights later reversed. History weeps Lots regulatory bodies approved SinoVac vaccine. would never take vaccine. sign desparation anything else.  order:

1. Brazil 

2. Mexico

3. Colombia

4. Iran

5. United States  inexperienced made mistakes boasting media found golden formula..

Sure, also lot things right. ignore mistakes either. people stay home then. pandemic devastating, nice hear small silver lining. need these. Yes is, I've said differently. perhaps stayed EU.

This demonstrates exact opposite.  I'm bar. Canada England rich countries, England richer country UE except Germany. manufacture doses? us Europeans send jabs? poor countries need. think production coming around soon alleviate shortage well additional options. Yes lets cancel everything rest year extend restrictions indefinitely people obey economy collapses oh well industry can't operate find new career. Taiwan considered? may make shit day. That’s side effect Pfizer one said lol. Go right ahead, want start proper trade war. doubt UK's reliance imports EU would UK come top. Well important data set, deaths course ultimate consequence virus. It’s apply another level nuance changes. deaths plateaued even month case decline, could bad news. need confiscate them. make ""mandatory buyback"" force hiding. every time one gets caught, publish news headline says, ""Criminal found *arsenal* illegal guns *thousands rounds ammunition*.""

The sad reality might live soon. second this. guy entire family always corrupt assholes. I'm surprised all. He's like guy office talks much hopes people see little work he's actually ""we""? 

And mean everybody, gets priority?

I think entity changing rules dealing threats left unchallenged. EU Trump. real psychological aspect that's well documented even pre-COVID. Seeing people's entire faces communicate allows less confusion intent/emotion, makes feel closer connected them, makes interactions memorable meaningful, etc. mention vital children people mental impairments learn social cues gain better understanding socialization works. accounts read say wish next day happy took off.

If can, would. _CAN GET TRADE WAR ALREADY_ Don’t blame way passed out. didn’t come guidelines. recipient. I’d suggest contacting local place like facility/hospital passing workers. tend extra cannot take back. Call around. home health aide therapist? getting vaccines. Won’t next round soon. care people man. That’s chose get vaccine don’t infect someone. help world get back level normalcy. mad something isn’t fault. want part. Whether it’s getting vaccine, promoting current safety, giving advice experience. wonder much miscommunication due vaccines subcontracted out. EU negotiated AZ, it’s different firm Belgium actually manufacturing doses.

Hopefully investigation start getting root issue. Agree completely know teachers concerned students well educations whole seems leaders care would rather keep schools closed make seem like care mandating masks school? supposed make friends everyone obscured? It’s one, website big counter increasing per second one populated countries world. meaningful metric cases per capita, even so, deaths per capita (as countries test less others). there, US far first place. Europeans eager hate Brexit-UK

Aaactually, one really excited EU anymore (except poor countries hate EU hoping sweet pork).

Am Belgian. plant _Wallonia_, economically socially halfway Detroit USSR. Production delays fact life there, along general strikes. 30 middle school classes, that’s norm everywhere around me. 20 pipe dream wealthiest schools According first source, people recommended vaccination due history with:

* Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) previous dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine components
* Immediate allergic reaction severity previous dose mRNA COVID-19 vaccine components (including polyethylene glycol \[PEG\])\*
* Immediate allergic reaction severity polysorbate (due potential cross-reactive hypersensitivity vaccine ingredient PEG)\*

This consistent hospital system (am MD). number people excluded rules would extremely low. people history anaphylaxis (to non-mRNA polysorbate/PEG) simply receiving monitoring post-vaccination (30 minutes rather 15). seem case, EU orders ""best effort"" clause. Best effort mean breaking prior obligations means breaking work laws make deliveries. say goes comfort boundaries

I say look facts data I'm moron. bulk pandemic months fall almost entirely normal. 

Wake up, indeed... Yes thank you. I’m really disappointed educators this. Yeah.... Islands South Korea, might well island.   think realistic assumption!

If anything going well, two month behind USA GB. J&amp;J (Vector) mostly way EU. 400 million doses J&amp;J, means almost entire population vaccinated vaccine. Eventually people EU vaccinated J&amp;J vaccine, relative early deliveries large quantities.

But also BioNTech (mRNA) important way EU, enough doses vaccinate 250 million people, possibility extra 50 million. Behind CureVac (mRNA) important EU too, deliveries starting Q2. Enough doses vaccinate 202,5 million people. AstraZeneca (Vector) 200 million people. Moderna (mRNA), enough doses 80 million people, Sanofi-GSK (protein) doses 150 million doses playing big role EU vaccination program (only Sanofi-GSK due late approval). NovaVax (protein) also play big role, possibility enough doses vaccinate 100 million people.

An outbreak coronavirus cases Jyväskylä linked student gathering city bar.

The city Jyväskylä Central Finland reported record number 106 coronavirus infections Wednesday, majority linked city centre bar.

Authorities said 80 new cases traced Heidi’s Bier Bar, due hold student event last week. event cancelled estimated 150 people still turned up.

If event cancelled, would considered public event -- currently restricted ten people Central Finland region.

The mass exposure led 1,000 people placed quarantine city, authorities added.

""I contacted worried citizens called university student union take responsibility. However, must remembered independent adults, spending free time,"" Petri Laaksonen, chair University Jyväskylä’s student union board, told Yle.

On Wednesday, Heidi’s Bier Bar announced Facebook would close doors notice help prevent spread coronavirus city.

Authorities left limited options

The City Jyväskylä's Emergency Management Team meet Friday decide possible new measures aimed bringing escalating situation control.

However, according city’s infectious disease doctor Ilkka Käsmä, authorities many options tighten coronavirus restrictions.

""We could shut hobbies people age 18, would seem pretty unfair chains infection coming bars. think we're going that. measures must go root causes,"" Käsmä said.

He added operations private businesses protected Constitution, city allowed intervene current Infectious Diseases Act. example, privately-owned gyms city remain open.

""The city's gyms already closed,"" Käsmä said.

The city also reminded students even though university switched distance learning, people return hometowns different parts Finland.

""Young people often ones carry disease asymptomatically, therefore yet accurate picture extensive problem actually is. Adding equation fact origin infections known, time stay put, avoid contacts wait situation become clearer,"" Käsmä emphasised.

Best isolate anyone risk otherwise treat like normal natural occurrence is. Moderna supposed deliver 100M vaccines total end March. Pfizer, 120M end March. **If** hit marks, US enough supply average around 2.7M/day end March.

Your analogy still proving point. fault cinema messed sound? analogy general, completely accurate, like yours. They're detached reality. reality extremely complex situation lot problem really share vaccines UK EU 

And also depends what's contract. know contract looks like, secret. EU example states 4 European plants used meet orders, clearly conflicting contracts. Something put past AstraZeneca, they've shown incompetent multiple times already (extreme late notification massive delivery cut without prior warnings, massive delivery cut, thus meeting goals even little bit phase 3 trial problems).

Also, better analogy would still seats (basically amount vaccines) room (the product, thus AstraZeneca vaccine) ticket (the contract). tickets might exactly same, dates ordered vaccine too, ones directly responsible getting seats ready (the manufacturers) Keep defending it, dude.

 Tom Keith-Roach: stand today released 1.1 million doses date scaling up, said, rapidly—this happen imminently—to releasing 2 million doses week. absolutely track and, therefore, deliver tens millions doses first quarter year. Clearly, small inter‑week variation around average 2 million doses, clearly average 2 million week course year, gets us 100 million doses committed UK course 2021. 
 
Maybe I'm understanding? 26,193,682 total doses including 21,698,606 first doses 4,263,056 second doses 01/28/2021.

24,652,634 total doses including 20,687,970 first doses 3,801,053 second doses 01/27/2021.

1,541,048 doses administered (vs 1,021,093 01/20, 51%) including 1,010,636 first doses (vs 782,816 01/20, 29%) 462,003 second doses (vs 233,512 01/20, 98%).

Per CDC dose number determined nearly reported doses administered but, missing data dose number, sum people receiving 1 doses people receiving 2 doses exactly equal total doses administered.

For data, see: coming super fast. Rises exponential, falls. hoping big spike winter, we're relief. Y’all need chill. never reach herd immunity I’m sure solutions. probably stop adding time service too.  prefer strict lockdown.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* delusions led bludgeoning two daughters death. really laughing matter. Enough US UK stealing EU vaccines narrative. government screwed up. Plain simple. Hold account, rather blaming others little vaccine program delayed. Pfizer vaccine massively funded EU germany developed german company. much EU vaccine AZ one UK point, UK owns first 100m doses produced UK business AZ. 

Then maybe AZ made deals EU includes manufacturing UK. According EU PMs contract also includes production UK. another potential fuckup AZ. handy want details contract public. One biggest problems they're trying force teachers back school, always enforcing full safety precautions. district started k-5 requiring masks hybrid full time last semester. require least face shield back full time. Parents keep posting articles safe back school keep highlighting articles state safety depends distancing (no full classes) mask requirements. 

There's way hell son going 4th grade environment. high risk father vaccinated (healthcare) go year hell wimp now. Safety first, people mandate others put lives (less) risk. Un-fucking-believable message public health officials. Well yh 31% received first dose 16% second dose. need alot 31% population vaccinated see national effect vaccines. majority population covered like 60-80% see nationally vaccines taking effect think hardest part (and maybe lot people) constant risk evaluation. draining stressed relationships thought smaller trial group 90% efficacy, bigger trial group 62% efficacy also included elderly. Good! put $ right back economy. Guaranteed. 

""Unemployment worse aged 15 19, 40 per cent drop employment compared 31 per cent drop employment aged 20 24.""

I fail see problem. live UK I’m glad I’m media quick peak recently:
‘Professor Johnathan Van Tam warns Lockdowns place end April’
‘Professor Ferguson warns restrictions still needed AUTUMN [fall Americans]’
‘Fears children’s education grows won’t back person 8 March’
‘Boris Johnson says UK could still lockdown JUNE!!!’

I’m getting pretty good writing headlines - maybe journalist. Seriously though, couldn’t much longer - we’re still lockdown - proper lockdown UK masks distancing - can’t even drive 30 miles grab package even go beach. end lockdowns much longer. Life won’t worth living. Right majority regulators around world looked immunogenetic data alongside much clearer efficacy data 55s approve it.

Little efficacy data older age group data used.

EG. Pfizer jab 75+ efficacy data lower confidence bound -17%! mean safe approve 75+ Yes, US done. EU exports vaccine World get back nothing? UK exports vaccines? No. US? No. point news day guy wrote taking time considered extreme measures. I'm point shake head say something like, ""Bless heart."" AZ private business ? may sell vaccine cost not. Nobody knows since contracts secret. selling vaccine reaping good news surely positively affects business. invested keeping face. makes teacher’s life, lives various support staff school, less important someone else’s career?

Nobody said life less important career. makes think wife (or even worse, single mom) quit job quickly find baby sitter affect person's health? We're talking life altering moment person quit career spent years developing years college get sudden kids home backup didn’t sign this, they’re economic situation direct life death response some.

I'm teacher education I'm situation. come back work May option. Every person work (about 1,000 us location alone) come back quit. meetings work closely people every week. I'm quitting job many years education career-building wanted shut schools.

If co-workers high risk (and one quit job) would expect necessary protect themselves. teachers high risk expect go back school. choose do. kids' parents choose bring back not. Bad luck teacher's job puts risk job important good education children important career family's entire well-being dependent on. would lose house vehicles quit go work administrations politicians ignorant uncaring live die, kids don’t go school impacts job.

You clearly career house maybe even children seem understand implications ""that impacts job."" Losing job grave ripple effects you, spouse, children. could lose house try find apartment rental children. going pay without job? We're talking starting scratch. Credit destroyed. I've heard many stories years people killing losing jobs devastating.

This also black white issue, either. There's hybrid week options situation. There's options like teachers ok come back. Teachers virus come back. kids whos parents want teachers ok come back offer online rest. think everyone comes back everyone lose job problem. Talk right place right time! Probably smallest mistakes. sound like insider news. ""Rest-assured, we're working plan ensure safe, quality re-opening students fall!"" Good, let someone actually wants work take place. Sadly think right. MASKS WORK efficacy cloth masks especially, inflated near religious levels. science faith. That’s easier said done. confidence interval -13-100% enough data draw conclusion from, even tighter CI AZ.

But right, we're already seeing promising data Israel Pfizer, great! Think forgot /s people reading quickly! they'd put private market, it'd gone faster pariah gobble prey. time I've thought mail free masks instructions/info everyone would one best uses control/relief funds. Cool. doesn’t actually make policy.  Health restrictions ultimately political decisions.

What’s funny said 60%. That’s majority. So, agree me. Even better. wacky confidence interval. I'm sure read age line, CI ""-1405-94,2"" likely combination really wide range typo (yes, know comma denoting decimal), right? ""-1405""? ""-14""?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's unrelated though. Also, discovered issue **immediately**, MHRA told, gave authorisation continue scientific purposes.

I'd look figures vaccine providers, elderly figures similar. Paywall Someone Facebook feed legit used argument numbers hoax inflated make Trump look bad. Went convenient numbers reported go inauguration Brazil variant overcame city 75%+ herd immunity already achieved. Worry variant, UK variant child’s play comparatively. I’ll play along. 
The precedent mask wearing US back 1918. fact many people wearing masks sort accomplishment. know lot people want howl moon people observing latest advice doubling masks it’s unnatural concept sprung people overnight accompanied scolding even wanting hang life know. People love equate masks seatbelts. Check history seatbelt use. took decade actual laws get compliance now. 
Picture this: you’re kids tball game summer. It’s nice 80 degree day. Sun shining....and everybody pestering kids stay six feet apart, put masks properly making sure adults nice snug.  Or, it’s time school. Let’s make sure kids sitting rows masks behind plexi glass dividers. don’t see something utterly sad nothing you. win can’t explain you. 
This bullshit “it’s piece cloth” line people use make feel superior. say people want march around masks years it. Good you. slap baby you’re top girlfriend care. goal people actually enjoy life yes, something unnatural mask wearing impact that. Masks make seem like goal exist live. may think they’re super that’s case wear one often like. Again, it. think you’ll hard pressed find many followers come July so. needed temporarily nonsense 2022 beyond simply happening. Hasn’t approved use US isn’t part current vaccination plans. Curfew wrong tool. Social distancing isolating needed.

Avoid crowds. Curfew may actually make crowds curfew.  US ordered tons doses everybody, correct strategy beginning. Right? I’ve walking around sounding like Darth Vader Bane respirator (though I’ve used hotspots show up). Kinda like Halloween year something I’m thinking it. irrelevant.

The UK Israel way way ahead us respective vaccination campaigns yet they're strict lockdown now.

The emergence new variants combined Winter season main factors play here. **The vaccination oldest come ""a long way"", according state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell.**

**But many others may wait longer planned, Astra Zeneca's covid vaccine may delayed.**

**State epidemiologist Anders Tegnell** began Thursday's joint press conference account global situation.

\- still high level internationally, says.

The European region may slightly reduced share new cases, says. 

In Europe, big difference different countries terms infection status. Belgium, example, infection rates reduced somewhat.

\- whole Europe affected future.

\- Sweden constantly somewhere middle crowd starting tip little, continues.

In Sweden , clear decline recent times, according Tegnell.

**Another 95 new** deaths confirmed covid-19 reported Sweden, Public Health Agency announces.

Thus, total 11,520 infected people died country.

A total 564,557 people Sweden confirmed infected covid-19.

**The new** deaths authority's statistics cases occurred several days earlier, deaths occurred near future included due delays reporting. means daily update shows reported death rates, death rate particular day.

In Sweden, peak number tested Christmas, since number samples decreased.

**The proportion of** positive people test also decreased recent weeks. 12 percent samplers received positive test result week 3.

\- proportion positive test results decreased significantly. heading right direction.

Up 30 percent everyone age group 90+ received dose one vaccine, also received dose two.

Even though small part population still vaccinated, increasing rapidly, says Tegnell.

At present, 2.65 percent population vaccinated, says.

\- goes fast get vaccine deliveries, says Tegnell.

\- shows order priority recommended followed well. come long way protecting oldest society.

**Tegnell** **reminded** importance continuing follow advice recommendations: keep distance, work home, test symptoms maintain hand hygiene.

The number covid-19 patients hospitals decreased compared last week. total 223 fewer patients cared hospitals last week.

\- short term, regions challenges dealing care forced postpone time maintain ability able escalate covid care turn upwards again, says Thomas Lindén, head department National Board Health Welfare.

\- regions see smaller decline, clear decline occupancy, says.

**274 patients** covid-19 cared iva today.

\- occupancy iva also decreased compared last week. pressure high load varies regions.

Six regions staff mode 13 regions reinforcement mode, two normal mode.

\- regions report see improvement, short long term, Lindén says.

However, load varies regions.

Right now, MSB focusing number risks, says Svante Werger, advisor MSB. Among things, discusses vaccination.

**Deferred** activities also considered entail number risks, perhaps healthcare also parts society. something consider, says Werger.

He also mentions parallel events pandemic risks pose challenges authorities, heavy snowfall, power outages outbreaks bird flu.

Public confidence authorities fallen pandemic, including MSB. entails risks worth considering, says.

Another risk area whether recommendations followed public. important citizens continue follow advice recommendations even see spread infection decreases somewhat, says.

**The delivery Astra** Zeneca's vaccine expected smaller planned. asked TT whether could affect Swedish vaccine plan delayed, Tegnell answers:

\- plays important role, vaccine could increase vaccination rate look like could so. means many vaccinated later.

This makes greater challenge able offer everyone vaccination midsummer. problem, possible say anything else it, says adds 70 extent vaccinated later.

**Since** questions arose effectively Astra Zeneca's vaccine protects 65, Germany advised using vaccine group.

When asked Aftonbladet would mean Swedish vaccination plan vaccine prove effective group, Tegnell answers:

\- means gigantic problems, Pfizer's Moderna's vaccine.

**The vaccine definitely** dangerous elderly, says adds turns effective group, must given groups healthcare professionals.

\- would good possible give elderly. weeks, much better data group.

When asked ETC requirements rapid tests fever checks travelers countries mutations discovered, Tegnell answers:

\- requirements presenting negative test result come UK.

However, fever checks entry shown good effects, according Tegnell. therefore occur great extent Europe knows.

\- many fever, may well early phase control go infection without fever. RNA-vaccines like one Pfizer Moderna complete opposite , efficient older people. 

Do source this? AZ seems many problems experts would better turning attention Johnson&amp;Johnson. Imo UK invested bit heavily Pfizer/Moderna

Why? They've ordered enough vaccinate old people, even means going back giving people first recieved AZ. also sent me, subscriber, e-mail today subject line ""The Fall Cases"" pretty optimistic outlook seeing drop cases well assessment probably get worse long U.S. keeps improving vaccine rollout. NYT hate circlejerk threads overblown. matter I'm concerned simply making point? there's literally incentive something - would it? 

Further, elaborate explaining wearing mask ""isn't bad"" - I'm going elaborate million drawbacks wearing them. 

Instead I'll pose original question:
If masks work, I'm still forced wear mask movie theater restaurant vaccine, get vaccine?

Also, anyone feel free shame downvote, there's legit hundred millions plus people feel like do. Perhaps, 3 living grandparents Pfizer though. expected, btw. Something similar happened another vector-vaccine ever heard reading past headline?! Instead blindingly spewing woke bullshit, inform yourself.

Fauci suggesting government create campaign marketing vaccine POC increased risk history hesitation towards vaccination general. Think campaign like ""planed parenthood"" instead informing contraception sex health, benefits vaccination. Nothing cutting line front others. point lockdown flatten curve, thereby extending amount time we'd pandemic? do. understanding, group full dose, half dose, people younger. Germany going approve AZ people 65, may increase effectiveness profile. There's nothing exactly wrong reporting new variants cause problems they're transmissible etc. headlines imply vaccines effective without scientific/medical research doubt fear mongering etc. think that's main problem reporting new variants almost focused vaccines may effective even though nothing really come suggest far vaccines remain effective. use adjuvants vaccines elderly? It’s real. triple masking 15% better protection. Porque los dos following science. sadism. fact press briefing, administration tells basic truths, press-worthy. “No one cared put mask” ditto, way less stressed facial grooming beard (finally letting grow out) imperfections would obsess before. Add fact, haven’t gotten sick yet year I’m happy health it’s currently! New Normal crew gonna pissed “Expert worship”

What’s alternative? Trust random internet people? I’ll continue trust people wrong 10% time self-proclaimed experts wrong half time. ‘Coronavirus didn’t come China came Shiva. Shiva Coronavirus gone March.”

😆 oh Shiva. huge problem. AZ vaccine restrictive refrigeration issues two have. plan EU countries use AZ vaccine elderly need travel. Im genuinely sure whether mocking actually believe that..... wow.... Try decision document MHRA AZ vaccine, data there. news far positive widespread media coverage. People also missing. rules uncle originally breach catch Covid first place. already couched said caveat top-level comment... Obviously. 

That's it? Ignoring points? OK. answers. good day nearly common. Sorry misread. recommended approval (in 65s) Sheltered? Says one whose face buried deep inside Pfizer's asshole mean, data low statistics, pretty dire.

They gave like 300 people 65 placebo vaccine, group got one case.... man wild reading people talk lockdowns America like China military barring people leaving houses.

see: daily discussion threads everyday lol I’m trying hurt feelings dude. pointing attitude child like. There’s segment population cry ‘the man’ moving goal posts disruptions lives without realizing cause changes government virus itself. come spoiled petulant children. AFAIK, EU paid August. AZ got time money. ""Herd immunity"" vaccines mean virus eliminated, people susceptible spread. would controlled like measles something  Much relates fact EU thoroughly botched vaccination campaign blunt swear purposely keep locations far enough apart they're always packed, even went drive-thru only. guess cuts overhead costs sure. Lmao completely made up. bother?  week two. Hospitalizations already begun fall. Dr. Fauchi experts said still need wear mask even vaccination! Stop ""ditching mask"" BS need continue mask wearing social distancing majority vaccinated. begin journey get back normal late 2021.  Surprised run headline infects people protects. would equally absurd. I'm freshman college :( here's hoping better sophomore year Yes, wasn’t saying intentional. way panned out. If, this, turns Oxford significantly less effective old people, government look foolish.
There many questions, especially since Europe diverging decision vaccinate elderly Oxford jab. may crazy repercussions line Good news get clicks! point start see noticeable decline deaths vulnerables &amp; healthcare workers vaccinated? Yeah hear you. bit concerned level overstepping boundaries governments did. Even US thought rights inalienable came point people thought ok government make exception take away rights case. 

For worried governments would never give back freedoms get us back normal long media kept releasing stuff made people scared. seems like it’s still happening stuff variants people fed finally fucking sheltered uninformed regarding real world insane issue dosage. sign enough old people. vaccines approved older people Europe signed enough old people. Don’t get AZ-Oxford didn’t find enough old people studies.  


It combined phase 2/3 trial, initial participants younger due ethical reasons accumulating safety data. 


Other companies went quicker threw elderly people straight mix riskier means get data age group quicker.


There plenty data older people US trial finishes soon. Meanwhile FOX NEWS, ""Coronavirus time DANGEROUS levels since Biden took office."" ""virus numbers bc Trump did...."" hard allow others live lives wish? Right. know city, current bottleneck vaccine supply. They're figuring 7+ weeks get everyone 70 older vaccinated rate we're receiving doses. That's gonna change though. hundreds millions doses coming spring, bottleneck many people give shots day. Looks like large CI. similar results released? think fewer people susceptible infection slows spread? Never made investment quick. $NVAX! already kinda showing WSB thing. Check twitter accounts major politicians analysts 'the media'. blue checks talking Robinhood closing stock options average traders instead COVID. that's case, feel like non-science-y people waaaay high assumption vaccine efficacy.

Two doses polio vaccine 90% effective. MMR vaccine 78% effective mumps. really flawless effectiveness saves lives, rather reduction spread afforded mass vaccination. Makes sense. I’d imagine potential life ~10 million people would really excellent umami flavors going on.  Read latest news. EU/AZ contract made public. AZ fucked EU came top. Pack hate misguided opinions go somewhere people care. Everyone's vaccine based spike protein, SA variant mutations spike protein, making antibodies created original spike match mutated spike. 

The mRNA vaccines also trigger small T-cell response (instead looking virus antibodies, looks cells creating virus). traditional vaccine typically prep T-cell response like adenovirus/mRNA vaccine would. Obviously data this, infinitesimal number people. Covid poses massive risk people autoimmune diseases one would presume vast majority get vaccinated. medical treatments--anything likely make vaccine risk probably also makes covid even bigger risk. Ah, thanks that. Makes sense. Looks like quite large confidence interval well. release says 19.9-80.1 efficacy. concern vaccines still allow transmission we’ll open completely kids can’t get vaccinated end infected. hope people still keep wearing masks, social distancing avoiding obviously risky things like concerts crowded bars get vaccinated well. definitely move forward many things like indoor dining, gyms, visiting family, etc. plan unless Pzifer delivering promised amount vaccines. oblige contract.

They confiscating vaccines, contrary, want avoid vaccines sold EU going somewhere else paid it. Every talking head TV says got it, take precautions before, they've idea still pass on.

So low-risk group Covid (most people) - where's upside?

Genuine question. described here, I've able retain (but barely). make week grocery run WalMart. people think stay car, let bring out. brief *visits*, know 12-15 employees, worth it. Someone sees across floor, waves says name. simple act, helps fill empty spots. spring much better true country name blank? point making get point everyone wants vaccine gotten it, still restrictions, nothing get us back normal besides mass non-compliance. goalpost past mass vaccination. Stock market manipulation future average joe participation Wall Street WSB/Gamestop thing.

&amp;#x200B;

original press release Phase 3 start.

Sep 24, 2020 4:05 PM Parts pretty awfully wrong.

1. Oxford University research, EU paid production facilities readied Europe vaccines thereof. Oxford gave away common good.
2. AstraZeneca cost. Hence price rock bottom. stuff profit maybe would charge euro1.78 (vs $18 charged Modena).
3. lack ingredients, produce vaccine, yield variable. amount producing enough. fixed, takes time.
4. think problem AstraZeneca selling stuff elsewhere breach contract put block in, see point 2.

UK made work AstraZeneca, India made work. US fine (and even needing AstraZeneca - they've approved it, even though they've paid facilities vaccines)

EU stuffed badly, they've got good choices, put export block vaccines including pfizer weekly EU quota met, bad taking everything, good choices sat hands 3 months getting cheaper deal, go large orders (and damn expense) 

It would interesting see results Belgium investigation, contracts would interesting see much AstraZeneca this, moment looks like EU stuffed up, going looking countries coming restrictions months earlier, less deaths, going well Europe  Reminds UK forced pubs close 10PM. streets rammed immediately after. According Richard Bergström, vaccine coordinator Sweden, contract explicitly states number doses AZ obligated deliver week. Novavax nearly 90% effective. Wow parents 84 74. Neither gotten vaccine. mother allergic one ingredients mRNA vaccine hoping J&amp;J one ok (she immunocompromised). father able get appointment. Medical Center Elberton started vaccinating school employees weeks ago, administering doses willing members state’s highest priority workers completing vaccination Brooke McDowell, administrator Elberton’s medical center, said 90% local first responders medical personnel chose get shots. finishing group several weeks ago, facility started administering vaccine local teachers school workers, though willing seniors federal government calls phase 1a yet vaccinated. center still injecting many 90 seniors day Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, McDowell said going leave shelf ruin,” McDowell said. “The governor’s asked us put shots arms, that’s we’re doing.” Another article says 60% effective south african trials majority infections south african variant delicious. Honest question, would expected? Seems mRNA vaccine still protective.   feel like crap 24-48 hours every flu shot vaccine fine. That's key point. sounds like effective MRNA Pfizer's vaccine bit least original strain. 

Greed reason China tried hide beginning.

The government almost countries world want close international travel airline industry tourism suffer.

Now, almost industries affected.

GREED main reason pandemic. Part also appointments booked up. ""Running vaccines"" necessarily mean none left. Appointments foreseeable future booked area.

If vaccines could make appointments. I've zero luck getting gf's parents vaccinated far. sure you’re getting downvoted. lot people simply go way avoid treated expressed I, extrovert, mentally suffering this. spoke like worth less garbage entire mindset didn’t revolve 24:7 people don’t know dying. people aren’t ever going back life. constant screeching complete lack minding one’s business certainly changed view humanity negative ways. lot “ohhh Germany managed WW2. help snitches thought greater good.” post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Now, almost industries affected.

GREED main reason pandemic. kinda frustrating tbh. want know see family etc one dose better waiting dose 2. mean know better wait dose 2, like dose 1 effective all.

I imagine offer 95% total protection, might offer something like 70% total immunity + 25-30% mild cases. something like that. wondering - Maybe still less effective moderna/biontech? original lockdown rules wear face covering going tons businesses still open

The *very* beginning told wear masks all.

It took weeks messaging change, weeks fucked hope ever getting everyone trust government this. really understand hesitation get it.

Well, every talking head health official TV says even get vaccine they've idea stop infecting anyone, take precautions now. given I've already Covid, where's upside?

Spreading doom consequences. Sorry. restrictions common countries, place prevent profiteering necessary medical supplies. retaliation, standard practice. days ago, Fauci saying probably two weeks. point believed J&amp;J would release results week, though. case, suggests FDA prepared authorize EUA quickly, mid-Feb quite possible study results unequivocally positive. Yeah, found report. Looks like still consider effect, much less. 

""The shot still considered effective protecting virus, efficacy rate 49.4% among 44 Covid-19 cases South Africa 90% cases contained troubling new variant, company said."" EU literally much worse scum Trump, completely ok that.

EU top tier hypocrites. Criticize Trump blocking vaccine exports, turn around screw everyone worse divert public attention complete utter incompetence failure securing vaccines. Thank you. Amazing quickly sub went doom gloom ""WE WON!"" downvotes cautious posts lol.

The next surge B117 likely, judging done Europe, could looking full lockdown situation US spring. 

People need stay vigilant, CLOSE getting pandemic, throw cap air finals even done. variants going challenge. 

Greed reason China tried hide beginning.

The government almost countries world want close international travel airline industry tourism suffer.

Now, almost industries affected.

GREED main reason pandemic. seems like contracting virus also gives pretty good immunity (not 100%, neither vaxx). Considering many people either getting covid getting vaccine, they're sites tracking percent people antibodies, regardless source? That’s great someone explain 8% like I’m 5? give 100 people, 8 people would still get virus? idea far. Great see vaccines proving high efficacy. I’m 50’s good health well. America living near-normal now. Crest holidays coming end (mostly). States soon loosen restrictions (CA) much like existed holidays, we're seeing rollouts vaccine. aggressive vaccines, could maskless indoor dining late summer/early fall. would company shares down, given good news released? worry dude due time! endgame. Greed reason China tried hide beginning.

The government almost countries world want close international travel airline industry tourism suffer.

Now, almost industries affected. 

GREED main reason pandemic. Great explanation. Rigorous enough!

I'll add expect efficacy parameter public non-blinded vaccination same; probably likely engage activity know received vaccine vs. situation uncertain control treatment. I'd expect real world efficacy setting like modestly lower, reflecting fact vaccinated probably going bit now. safe considering vaccine 95 percent effective social gatherings especially everyone vaccinated hanging going get lot that. Folks serious co-morbidities told 10 months we're high risk elderly. vaccines here, find we're far enough priorities list going months-long wait. people cannot get vaccine 

... patients advised take (due autoimmune diseases medical treatments) doctors it’s true. Canada still getting shorted Pfizer. countries might well. EU getting way expense others. It’s matter time new variant appears though evade vaccine. ""I'm antisocial mind leaving house month groceries all!!! would anyone else problem lifestyle??"" Des... May habe netherlands. remember first batches crossed channel. Meanwhile, CDC claims it, too, holding back second doses. 48m doses delivered states, CDC around 15m doses earmarked second doses either held back currently shipment. Hopefully we'll see better coordination CDC state health departments soon. clearly partisan. Politics aren’t allowed here. Yeah....

Whatever point.

Dont trust blowhards stop me. soon get vaccinated I'm resuming travel (at least domestically). still wear mask follow regulations aim travel places social distance well (beach resorts Caribbean, Florida, etc) potentially risky environment  Nothing happened wife second shot.  ""If peasants told punish you!""

I seen said board others: policy requires 100% perfect compliance work bad policy. Need know many symptomatic cases variant ended hospital. You’re going people poo-poo results still stopped people going hospital we’re good. looking like truly vulnerable get Pfizer/Moderna 50 healthy crowd gets Novavax, Astra, J&amp;J, etc.  would totally fine would get job done. part 'don't realize it"" understand? Perhaps touch face, however unlikely is. Still, hubris sounds like teen.  mean Novavax approval horizon US? know efficiency numbers came Pfizer Moderna approved month later. Could see something similar here? I've psoriasis years know well tissues attacking body. Sooo novavax? Haven’t heard discussed while, since amazing news, anyone info submit EUA rolled out????

PUT [proverbial since already got Pfizer vax] ARM!!!!!!!!!! good thing ask devaccinated. good thing ask devaccinated. harm distancing mitigated getting way soon possible, like dealing stage 1 cancer vs stage 4. Places like US Uk chose stage 4 places like Taiwan Iceland chose would better accept death less strong economy could done without social distancing. 

This depends mean ""social distancing."" Social distancing alone never meant stop pandemic; countries like US France UK put eggs one basket acted surprised basket broke. Found idiot. need flatten curve stay home month we'll go back normal...no no...stay home longer...and wear masks everywhere...until get vaccine....well even vaccine, make sure wear mask travel... point vaccine confer disease immunity prevents spread?

""If ask right now, what's concerning things I've heard far, fact reporting sudden increase cases Manaus, Brazil,"" virus expert Jeremy Luban University Massachusetts told NPR two weeks ago variant arrived United States. **""Manaus already 75% people infected [in spring last concern P.1 twofold: Scientists understand variant spread explosively Brazil, variant carries particularly dangerous set variant U.K. took three months dominate outbreak England, P.1 took month dominate outbreak Manaus. addition, Manaus already hit extremely hard virus April. One study estimated **the population reached herd immunity virus able spread easily** community. would city see even bigger surge 10 months later? **Could P.1 evading antibodies made previous version virus, making reinfections easier? Could significantly contagious? Could true?**

That's scary part    expecting EU share theirs.

When US/UK expect EU share? That's great news. Truth whilst need work reduced infection, mild infections would enough save lives. Lmao Jesus, remember threads LAST CNY holiday would cause cases explode. Yeah like sorry y’all acted like everyone know would dead leave house things store occasionally hasn’t happened yet. Nothing bad constantly drum beat point, it’s boy cried wolf shit. reasonable demand! teachers I've known 30 years extremely resilient people ! 
HOWEVER, told teachers Oregon made one demand that's vaccinated forced back classroom.
And, 100% support decision! 

Our teachers get enough support is! issue Pfizer vaccine data 70s, enough cases huge CI 308 million go read CEO's inteview day explains it.

Yields EU plants lower factor 3. UK plants place 3 months ago they've managed improvements get up, improvements EU plants takes time 3 months behind EU signed deal could start 3 months later. read CEO's inteview day explains it.

Yields EU plants lower factor 3. UK plants place 3 months ago they've managed improvements get up, improvements EU plants takes time 3 months behind EU signed deal could start 3 months later. Counterpoint: Yes.  last saw Saturday tested positive today? I'd get tested Pfizer yes. Moderna no. Moderna developing booster address issue. would still people waiting 2nd jab regardless remotely point.

The EUs woes EU, trying punish UK vile. 75 million doses would sitting refrigerated warehouse tomorrow existed, well paid people EMA stop skiing holidays. know theory regards already virus getting vaccine. people afraid getting it’s new. time people may decide get see it’s safe effective. Pennsylvania I’m sure brings peace cast non idiot safe guarded danger, I’d venture say don’t put others’ positions, assume dummies Disabled ""high risk"" still vulnerable absolute sense real impact reopening. almost 75+ don’t even know begin comment. might check rules of, know, [arguing logically responding. say suggested “a letter written every single whackjob” called straw man, exaggerate someone said enforce argument. It’s logical fallacy it’s sketchy.

I didn’t ask letter. asked Gates honest interview major publication, lie pretend “no idea”. isn’t “deserving”, it’s acting speaking particular way achieve goals purport want.

If actually want “people fighting” and, “only half population vaccinated”, well then, lying great strategy that. thought goal getting people board. That’s I’ve told, know people tell me. explain one. [Coronavirus (use Google Chrome translate) notice certain areas (Ultra orthodox Arab towns) extremely low vaccination rates compared rest country. low vaccination rates translated high case counts. also see breakdown infected, majority infected people either yet eligible vaccinated became eligible vaccinated last week.
Hospitalizations deaths lag behind infections means majority elderly people serious condition infected got first second dose vaccine.   fingers pies: bit tourism, bit business, bit oil/gas airline.

None things healthy moment worry much, billionaires still OK. careful hurt getting big soapbox yours. you’re vaccinated, majority population vaccinated also, still spreader. It’s ultimately you, still think wearing masks would wise herd immunity. someone family might stay home forever (combo legitimately scaring conditions make risk Covid along mental issues/ocd type behavior). choice family coming terms with. family members including high risk elderly planning fully resuming normal life vaccination. planning resume mostly normal warm out, vaccinated (I stuff outdoors mask til get vaccinated yeah, Im going outdoor dining, workouts, parks, friends deck patio). Like someone said. People short memories. someone wants completely give life can't stop them, know 99% people know that's returning old behaviors. Pennsylvania. eligible get it, appointments. pre-registered two weeks ago contacted health department received notice spot line end March  one saying Canada cut all. could hypothetically happen Pfizer huge manufacturing difficulties Europe, Pfizer would unable prioritize Canadian shipment European one. Dang covid cured cancer never said going force anyone else to? Dunno got that. mostly combination two imo. already got lived life safely normal. stayed home helped smaller asymptomatic pool thought (lots people say symptoms really mildly). think back mostly normal mid late April fully July 4. need tiny tiny tiny amount antibodies protected covid (we know exact numbers yet seems significantly less flu need value 40 stop 50% infections...a value 20 seems stop 80% infections think this). occurs sometimes viral infections. 

It's believed virus enters kills cancer cells evading immune system, releasing tumour antigens priming immune response. 

Some companies work developing reproduction-arrested viral treatments cancer therapies. Can't remember approved yet. they're effective, stop freedom travel close borders forever view? even want live world like that. What's end game vaccines prove affect transmissibility still massively reduce severe disease? Maybe India. saw article today serum institute manufactured tens millions doses AstraZeneca distribute they're danger expiring. hear l, personally I'd see like fire house. there's fire ANYWHERE yes want know. there's fire room I'm RIGHT that's big problem believe media reporting something inaccurate quoting studying COVID? would like see report differently? Correct wrong, UK delaying time first second shot vaccine? Sure, AstraZeneca defended decision, still seems easy excuse case efficacy proves less expected.  
So seems like generate lot data, ones clinical trials normally looking for.  thought Dems inflating death counts make Trump look bad?

/confused Basically, argument wearing masks. Protecting others.

Absolutely not. *know* people without masks infect others. also *know* 99.999% likely vaccine prevents transmission. h ave positive proof. clarify, talking heads science medicine liars, whole science tree Yeah, agree paints positive picture - scenario seems unlikely we'll see another large surge vaccination rates get close herd immunity. I'm skeptical Moderna Pfizer's manufacturing projections, since we've far seen \~8 weeks flat deliveries, modest 16% increase starting next week. they're (c.f. UK one dose) also get shat would need long term fix? like hospital disappeared something, need keep alive long enough tow truck come They'd to. 

I mean, they'll driving rural Kansas Missouri, I'm sure ""have to"" business. envy crowd. I'm still explain friends coworkers risks covid heavily determined age group. Oh, cool. like headline shared Washington needs expect ""a Mount St. Helens-like eruption COVID cases"". That's creative new comparison. I'd heard 9/11 death comparisons, course, natural disaster analogy pretty rad. tornado regions, F5-like swirl new cases. coastal regions, Hurricane Katrina-like flood new cases. Lots ideas here. would that? Isn’t Denver mile up, wouldn’t move somewhere near sea level? Mom 89, going 90 diabetes. still vaccine. enough doses go around. awful. However positive news, allegedly doses soon retirement community. hopefully she'll soon. shouldn’t gone large percent population vaccinated available. point mask reduce spread that’s achieved still required it’s possible wear them. people vaccinated hospitalizations way ease mask usage. Speculating happen useless. Let’s wait see situation changes. think still spread even vaccinated. going slow process everyone get vaccinated. going go back normal ""overnight"". YFI AZ signed contract Oxford uni profit would made vaccine pandemic. perspective seems like cared lot economy thousands thousands untimely deaths loss health opportunities millions make mistakes I'm vaccinated, I'm going start getting together friends. I'm going see (already vaccinated) parents. I'm going meet new people. I'm going travelling.

And that's obviously fine, that's absolutely point vaccine. public keep wearing masks distancing. show says that? know been, that's pretty much we've doing. Plus half-assed lockdowns restrictions. working. 430k deaths ain't hot. instead tell people ""You go hang friends even though know might kill them?""

Also, kill yourself. message change get along. 5k cases nationwide, whole different ball game 250k. too, ppl family part risk group thats main reason Seems like EU bluffing ask me. vice.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* brainwashing since SA variant (and UK variant) demonstrably transmissible? take precautions non-variant Covid, people get sick, individual, likely get sick. can't expect results different parameters. Haha it’s true! mountain pass heading north I-5. Never would expected it.  vaccinated people basically act like don’t vaccine.

In Public. reason parties home. agree EU would halt vaccine export different companies would insanity. hope aiming at. ask doctor based public information pretty solid immunity week 2nd shot. could get tested days meet want another layer assurance. Better throwing garbage. ideally would go need first, certain level pragmatism that's acceptable process. Lots people still brainwashed. average person 40 believes caught covid, they’d 10% dying. People badly misinformed risks That’s contract says best meet quotas. I'd expect wear masks gas stations, go packed restaurants still, etc.

They'd to. **all** to, soon allow vaccinated people wear masks public *every* Karen earth claim vaccinated. who's going check every time? That's reason vaccinated people need wear masks shots. I’ve keeping news past month due burnout; decline mostly due ramping vaccinations? talking licensed EMT 30 years experience, let facts ignorance get way rant Wait isn’t good thing? doses going get thrown trash. wouldn’t prefer arms can? fellow Hydro Homie see Parents told test kids, quarantine them. know many kids asymptomatic, would know kids get scanned. first shot Pfizer vaccine last week, slight burning sensation actual injection. Arm felt fine afterwards 10 hours, sore 36 hours. symptom chills 10 hour mark till woke next morning feeling fine. I’ve worse side effects eating KFC. can't answer certain, give benefit doubt try communicate like do, warranted energy to. still slip act judgmental sometimes, hard game play, fair.

Taking steps towards actually solving problem requires logical rational thought, though, neither allowed co-exist space emotional mind. think approach makes sense completely counter-intuitive, seems like approach perspective.

Funnily enough, lost job due COVID, making large effort past years rectify lifetime poor communication skills. Self-reflection brutally honest tough pill swallow. appreciate convo, though. Feel free message ever want talk! Stay safe, good rest week. Well EU one wanting contract published. I'd imagine also believe contradict saying. We'll see there. long blacked important stuff is. It’s chilling see little government values lives poor, aging, disabled, living trying survive without health insurance... way normalized many untimely unnecessary deaths use increase strength germex refill bottles car. also useful wiping groceries can't want wash. EU actually screwed UK sharing vaccine plants reciprocated, EU probably take measures punish UK. favour withholding Pfizer vaccine delivery need shown vaccine protectionism acceptable, whether EU not.  guess domestic facilities help. dunno. many times unprecedented global pandemic botched global, national, local response? flu one long ago dont remember feeling anything Coronavirus probably shitting pants right I’m reopening normalcy, mean slowly majority people vaccinated. reach point, I’m full speed ahead. then, gotta mindful people vaccinated. absolutely science even remotely suggests vaccine prevent transmission.

Someone asked scientiest ""Does prevent transmission?"" scientiest, dumb was, answered ""Well, test that, proof does"".

That's literally bullshit started. Many thanks!  too, thanks! short introduction, go hospital first visited 9 months ago see massive current 3rd wave effecting them.

At one point hospital overwhelmed 80 patients diverted hospitals. Remember vaccine emergency authorization? 

We wait months definitively determine vaccine prevents infection/and spread. 

Imagine f\*cked we'd could still spread told 10%-30% population go ham? hope so, too- we're small facility, really tiny example. little glimmer hope toward another day sushi!!! Wait realize *not* risk covid. Currently average 30 year old thinks 10% dying got getting vaccine means still live life lived now, can't lot faith vaccine.

Until message is: ""Get vaccine, get normal"", give dose someone else. Headlines like damaging. me, got flu jab nurse asked side wanted / side slept would likely ache... really, no.

Autoantibodies particularly concerning -- baseline, general population, find double digit percentages people autoantibodies, order 10-20%. issue autoantibodies actually cause clinical problems. Second, mentioned comments, particularly unusual -- viral infections number one cause autoimmune disorders (i.e. situations autoimmunity actually causes issues), means unique COVID-19.

It's important concept medicine that's often overlooked -- lab abnormalities problems. Laboratory findings problematic. become concerning cause *clinical* issues, there's indication case.  USA results Moderna, guess.  respect hell that.

Not believe I’m going say, play devils advocate - isn’t ‘little longer’? virus mutates faster vaccines altered pumped out? limit regards waiting bit longer willing accept additional risk? due younger population

ie. Expected lifespan 55 better immune systems

ie. Everyone without good immune system dies baby remainer never fucking disgusted EU. Fuck them!!

We amongst worst affected country world one thing we've done right sort vaccine program. EU wants take it!! fucked up!!

I doubt would help us way round, either. serious chip shoulder. Haha. True. give free vitamin pills everyone especially market put pills close minority communities. numbers going lot since vaccination started. get idea they're rising? They've halved since start January. happen shockingly high begin with, still look high compared equivalent countries. know dude. piece cloth. Masks make social interactions awkward, people hearing disabilities, big pain ass. can't see smiles anything, anonymity kinda sucks.

Seeing people wearing masks outside fun. make depressed I'm much looking forward day mandated anymore, know? week-old Biden White House acknowledged Wednesday Americans need wait months get vaccinated, top officials launched regular briefings coronavirus response seeking illustrate fidelity science Slavitt, one five senior officials held briefing, said administration working increase availability vaccinations “with incredible urgency purpose” “it months everyone wants vaccine get session largely compendium promises points Biden team made days leading inauguration since then. President Biden made major announcement day government working purchase summer 100 million additional doses two coronavirus vaccines — made Moderna Pfizer-BioNTech — allowed emergency use United States.  good haha probably posted typing. Thanks honest reply. I’ve keeping eye cases trends see area downward slope line. guess that’s best way approach it. keep eye studies such. That’s great think, morning I’m one step closer much protected. one concerned real threat constantly inhaling microplastics microfibers hours end, way, especially job requires these? kinda agree, don’t think it’s depressing. mask sign respect, miss seeing peoples entire faces it’s sad never do. someone works service industry, it’s honestly nice wear fake smile 24/7. Oh that's interesting, hardly surprising. Thanks link californian teacher, I’m totally fine honestly long schools stay closed. don’t ask us go schools vaccine right tf there.

i can’t imagine rage teachers feel states forcing person education shit conditions yet still back line. see we’re among countries respect most. Top notch! Almost every country that. far EU since manufacturers cutting deliveries might time look citizens first. see EU one prioritizing first. cases spiked 20%+ holidays. might virus coming back naturally holidays &amp; associated infections &amp; travel passed. level right thanksgiving. im sure vaccine affect dont think would work *that* quickly.. like helping attribute 100% drop vaccine post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  happen enough people get vaccinated herd immunity achieved, proven vaccination prevent spread. would really bad said protected people turned didn’t. much false hope given it’s exhausting disappointing. can’t believe anymore. need worst case scenario least prepare, think lot people feel similarly.  You’re right. Student testing low. officials acting like low case numbers mean students *definitely* aren’t getting it/aren’t spreading it. aren’t acknowledging aren’t getting full picture testing low. 

But friends teachers report concerning things. Like recommended protocols followed. Furthermore, county put graph case numbers schools number among teachers pretty shocking, proportionally higher case numbers among general population. 

I know it’s contentious debate whether schools open. I’m saying continually shut down. Idk answer is. guess don’t like way things manipulated county. get good sunny weather strong vaccine train running *should* agreed. US covid riddled country whole US. Moderna vaccine produced Lonza Switzerland, mixed bottled Spain getting labeled Belgium. plan produce 300m year. cuts narrative pandemic almost over. Actually, evolutionary standpoint, ""most"" means millions rather billions  Really disgusted EU.

Happy see taking mask off.

Hope pro EU sentiment reddit finally change. brain can't function forever stop working sometime future I'm dead, better stop using now? like odds. delivery schedule attached purchase moment.

Tantrum 3, 2, 1... I’ve similar experience. try push-ups too. idea actually works I’ve fine last flu shots  agree certain extent, let’s forget huge part school socialization, especially young kids. social animals need around others especially still developing. I’m curious generation kids zoomed way kindergarten going impacted it. That's good tip, thanks! Nursing homes like .06% population responsible 40% deaths. vaccinated things look lot better. Officially, new cases 50% since peak start January. Pfizer also behind.

Pfizer longer behind starting week. Funny news r/coronavirus. stuff happening around world besides covid slightly disagree. 

In cares there’s enough data, one data tell direction, quite frankly none far.

(And Israel deliver data next days/weeks, far already looking stellar) Maybe it’s little unfair EU disclose parts want, refuse disclose ones may paint bad light. role UK plants agreement comes mind. agree lack communication frustrating, communication written contract regarding delivery dates? Great idea, tell corporate daddy hurry up. understand curiosity desire know others “reactions” feel like fuels anti vaxers people talk felt lousy low fever not. You’re going feel sick. You’re body engaging immune mechanism uses catch cold flu infection. area going swell tender, that’s normal inflammatory response. You’re going feel tired, body putting energy towards immune response. low grade fever expected people. None reactions worthy talking about. Nobody discusses reactions tetanus booster. already it. Wife decently badly. long hauling. bad want see people suffer anymore. time feel claims percentage long haulers grossly exaggerated know 70 people who've virus three bad long hauling. others milder forms maybe another 5-10 able function less okay minor restrictions life. Reality time stop functionally done even technically herd immunity April May.we're vastly different situation almost anywhere else world

The basic deal situation focus primarily treating still suffering long hauling. We're getting pretty good treatments ICU we're frankly going many ICU patients anymore. Probably one month really cases large number done terms hospitals overloaded. Cases continue smaller amounts probably half year.  yeah, could also -75%. comparing like like, yes, would meaningful data. still feel it’s early tell every week know more.. Tbf start extremely high number like 60k cases take longer cases go low numbers. 60k-20k cases still fairly good especially considering new UK variant transmissible honestly think get us herd immunity next months going end two classes citizen... vaccinated unvaccinated. life going become way inconvenient second group stuff reopens, etc. Want go concert? Proof vaccination. Sporting event? Proof vaccination. Attend college classes in-person fall? Proof vaccination. Apps already developed used demonstrate this. 

The incentive getting normal back get us line, people unvaccinated going like left cold. also suspect lot employers going go way Trader Joe's etc. try incentivize bonus cash, months start incentivize firing anyone get it. vaccines manufacured private businesses profit. EU sending them. Businesses sending them. That's great hear! Shame stay isolation reason least sick. Someone needs tell stop wasting time reddit start sending Canada vaccines! Hurry up! Adult vaccinations help children reduce spread, resulting much smaller numbers cases. example, adult vaccinations bring county's case count 150 per day 5-10 per day*, would much lower chance kids would exposed community spread low. completely agree concerns long-term effects, I'm trying hopeful risk coming contact COVID greatly reduce fall. Again, right wait see exactly far numbers drop.

(*This assuming vaccinated individuals asymptomatic getting tested still spreading. yet evidence true, scientists expect true.) wife teacher, go back in-person January. takes precautions past school board recommends, brought PPE bought money. ($250 HEPA filter, $100 KN95 masks, $40 face shields, sanitizer soap). live county enforces mask use schools teachers kids, that's plus. also teaches science classroom evacuation vents ceiling others pump fresh air recycles air classroom every period emergency evacuation system. windows open.

There things schools could better, there's also lot personal responsibility teachers must take keep students safe. Schools could provide better PPE teachers junk provide default. could also hold fundraisers HEPA filters classrooms allow happen. (They afraid schools get equipment fundraisers allow school. leave teachers pay pocket).

Some teachers schools eat lunch together room. smart. even anti-masking 1918 flu narcissism fueled back then? talking neutralization tests like far I've seen, researchers took part study claimed ""breakthrough"", even preprint released. Pretty much independent experts urged caution full data could examined, afterwards started forming consensus results impressive, even disappointing. problem stems sensationalized media titles present press releases independent praise."
