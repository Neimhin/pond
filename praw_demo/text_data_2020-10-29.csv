Thats guestimate IFR - using larger % population whats currently pay attention many people dying percentage total population?

Well, yes no. Im saying youre *just* looking CFR and/or positive test results, comparing within itself, youre looking whole picture.

The whole picture includes IFR - includes 70+% asymptomatic, light symptoms - enough cant/dont/wont get tested.

The fearmongering comes play dont consider group exists. discredit deaths - year, many grandma died influenza minor cold body couldnt fight off. Every death sensationalized brought everyone dog gonna die. 

At beginning this, (MSM) said would *AT MINIMUM* 200-300k deaths, high peak **3 MILLION**. Worldwide hitting mil us, 225k. Larger population, larger numbers. still even 1% entire USA. Could get there? Maybe! knows? Since are, seems be, 6 months ish 'vaccine', wouldnt think so. handled quickly, maybe well people want to. Especially people pay attention positive case #s - number anything give us idea far thing spread. Nothing else. Positive cases **DO NOT** equal deaths/hospitalizations.

Unless want back subreddit month, writing similar comment saying ""we locked restricted movement much possible, avoid tens thousands deaths"". tracing new coronavirus great concern scientific community home abroad, studies suggesting Wuhan South China Seafood Market source virus. Recently, first isolation live neo-coronavirus cold-chain food packaging Qingdao paper new outbreak Beijing may originated cold-chain food contamination, another possibility virus traceability seems raised. Wu Zunyou, chief expert epidemiology Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention, said recent media interview, ""Since Beijing Xinfaodi, Dalian Qingdao outbreaks caused seafood, makes us think earliest outbreaks Wuhan also caused imported seafood South China seafood market. new idea new technical direction.""

&amp;#x200B;

According news released China Center Disease Control Prevention (CDC) 17th, traceability investigation Qingdao outbreak, CDC detected isolated new coronavirus outer packaging imported frozen cod moved workers, first time international community new coronavirus isolated outer packaging cold-chain food confirmed first time new coronavirus could survive longer period time outer packaging items special conditions cold-chain transportation, indicated new coronavirus morning 20th, press conference held Qingdao municipal government, vice mayor Qingdao, Luan Luan, said Qingdao found complete chain evidence prevention control epidemic, indicating new coronavirus transmitted object human, new virus transmitted object human. survive long time frozen conditions.

&amp;#x200B;

Gao Fu, director China Center Disease Control Prevention, said, ""In past, coronavirus nucleic acid positivity 'detected' samples, nucleic acid positivity necessarily live virus; 'isolation' live virus means live virus must exist causing transmission infection."" worth mentioning ""Patient Zero"" Qingdao outbreak, Dong Chen, stevedore worker Qingdao Dagang, loaded unloaded frozen seafood imported overseas night shift September 19.

&amp;#x200B;

23, Tsinghua University, Beijing Center Disease Control Prevention, Chinese Academy Medical Sciences, Institute Pathogen Biology, Peking University, Chinese Academy Sciences, Beijing Genome Institute researchers published online journal National Science Review entitled ""Beijing new coronary pneumonia epidemic reappearance may due cold chain food contamination"" research paper. nucleic acid sequencing viral genome sequence analysis cases, environment food samples related June 2020 outbreak Beijing, combined comprehensive epidemiological investigation big data analysis, paper reveals epidemic may originated cold chain food contamination, suggests cold chain transportation may new route neo-coronavirus transmission.

&amp;#x200B;

Not Qingdao Beijing, also outbreak Dalian July, confirmed cases appeared first days Kai Yang Seafood Company employees families, although live virus isolated cold-chain aquatic related items, unable form complete infection chain, possibility virus transmission cold-chain transportation still exists.

&amp;#x200B;

Some experts field noted cold-chain items, especially imported seafood, transmit neocoronavirus, may suggest new research direction virus traceability Wuhan's South China Seafood Market. largest wholesale market aquatic products central China, South China Seafood Market large number imported products transported cold chain. Yang Zhanqiu, professor Institute Virus Research, School Basic Medical Sciences, Wuhan University, told Global Times May 28 South China seafood market imported seafood trade, introduction new coronavirus cold chain transport products possibility.

&amp;#x200B;

A Global Times reporter reviewed public reports found South China Seafood Market number shops selling imported fresh seafood, including king crab arctic shellfish, well meat products Brazil Germany needed shipped cold chain.

&amp;#x200B;

Wu Guizhen, chief biosecurity expert CDC, also mentioned recent media interview ""in past looking intermediate hosts virus traceability, may time revisit whether virus came wild animals not."" Wu Guizhen said, ""The epidemic rebounded Beijing also concentrated outbreaks wholesale markets, unlike Wuhan's South China seafood market, likelihood wild animal-caused outbreak Beijing small. leaves us important hint: possible source infected person contaminated food, environment seafood market creates opportunity rapid spread.""

&amp;#x200B;

However, conjecture still lacks enough evidence support formation clear chain infection. Yang Zhanqiu mentioned source targeted imported products shipped cold chain, central question product became contaminated virus source needs answered. One possibility foreign personnel involved cold-chain transportation process infected new coronavirus spread virus seafood products working. Another possibility imported animal products infected new coronavirus. ""Previously virus traceability focused wild animals, bats, focus possibility fish, pigs, cattle, sheep, etc. spread new coronavirus"", said Yang Zhanqiu, according past knowledge coronavirus, animals infected virus infect humans, new coronavirus may overturn conclusions. ""However, none speculations currently supported sufficient evidence.""

&amp;#x200B;

An unnamed virologist 28th also told Global Times reporter cold chain transmission still currently seen secondary route spread new coronavirus, possibility way infecting large population Wuhan high. addition, virus imported overseas, source first outbreak epidemic, also question needs explained. analysts also suggested earliest cases Wuhan history exposure seafood markets South China, issues remain studied. 90% people ones Socialstyrelsen finds died COVID-19 also FHM statistic. 10% others Socialstyrelsen finds people diagnosed tested death. 10% FHM S√∂S statistic obviously people tested positive died within 30 days COVID-19.

Yes glitch. end looked like never posted all. afternoon third Kashgar epidemic prevention control news conference held 27th, Kashgar regional health committee party secretary Li Lingyu introduced, October 26, 24:00 27, 17:00, Kashgar region new confirmed cases 5 cases, asymptomatic infected referred confirm; new asymptomatic infected 19 cases, 26 positive mixed-tube retest out. ""5+19"", controlled patients, mean current wave epidemic Kashgar control? regard, number medical experts interview Global Times reporters expressed positive attitude, also warned that, source still unknown, still take epidemic wave lightly.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄZeng Guang, former chief scientist epidemiology Chinese Center Disease Control Prevention, said interview Global Times July 27 current epidemic prevention control situation Kashgar relatively good, far, asymptomatic infections put much pressure local medical system. However, also said new patients may appear area one another future, hospitals prepared treat patients superior medical resources, addition preventing infections within hospital. ""As long patients kept control, society naturally remain stable,""

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄYang Gonghuan, former deputy director China Center Disease Control Prevention, argued whether epidemic controllable depends well entire government society whole implement prevention control measures. ""As long find first close contacts suspected patients, isolate properly take preventive control measures time, basically considered controllable."" told Global Times.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄA member Xinjiang Autonomous Region's epidemic prevention, control medical treatment expert group told Global Times 27th wave Kashgar epidemic described localized, aggregated outbreak. Since positive cases pointing Shufu County, chances widespread outbreak small, let alone original situation 100 cases reported day. ""Although Shufu County 15 kilometers downtown Kashgar, cases highly related local factory Three Village, Station Min Township,"" unnamed expert said, adding, ""Unlike big cities, high degree social mobility risk community infection low."" However, expert also said people Kashgar cannot relax vigilance yet source wave epidemic still unknown.

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄWhat difficulties wave epidemic leaving us moment? ""One things difficult figure chain transmission it."" Zeng Guang said patients Kashgar outbreak mainly asymptomatic infected, much difficult figuring chain transmission symptomatic patients. ""In case symptomatic patients, find infected infected onset disease, determine chain transmission,"" said, ""but asymptomatic infected patients, know infected analyze epidemiological investigation, difficult. ""

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄAt epidemic conference held 27th, Xinjiang Kashgar region health committee party secretary Li Lingyu also introduced total number people tested Kashgar region 4,746,500 people, October 27 17:00 completed entire region full nucleic acid test, except sparse county 183 people reported positive, rest negative. counties cities Kashgar region negative nucleic acid test results entire population.

„ÄÄ„ÄÄIn regard, Zeng Guang said, Kashgar region early detection epidemic, context situation completely clear carry relatively large-scale nucleic acid testing, ""its prevention control strategy completely correct"".

„ÄÄ„ÄÄThe view also held Yang Zhanqiu, professor viruses Wuhan University School Medicine, told Global Times still unclear whether epidemic new round local epidemics imported infections regions, issue clarified really take initiative controlling epidemic. Otherwise, ""the possibility another outbreak week month entirely real,""

&amp;#x200B;

„ÄÄ„ÄÄZeng Guang stressed that, addition concern epidemic sparsely populated county Kashgar, also concerned whether ""spark"" epidemic spread throughout country.

Genetic mutation originated Spain transmitted returning holidaymakers, researchers find

A coronavirus variant originated Spanish farm workers spread rapidly much Europe since summer, accounts majority new Covid-19 cases several countries ‚Äî 80 per cent UK.

An international team scientists been[ tracking virus genetic described extraordinary spread variant, called 20A.EU1, [research published Thursday.

Their work suggests people returning holiday Spain played key role transmitting virus across Europe, raising questions whether second wave sweeping continent could reduced improved screening airports transport hubs.

Because variant genetic signature, traced back place originated.

‚ÄúFrom spread 20A.EU1, seems clear \[virus prevention\] measures place often sufficient stop onward transmission introduced variants summer,‚Äù said Emma Hodcroft, evolutionary geneticist University Basel lead author study yet published peer-reviewed journal.

The scientific teams Switzerland Spain rushing examine behaviour variant establish whether may deadly infectious strains.

Dr Hodcroft stressed ‚Äúno evidence variant‚Äôs \[rapid\] spread due mutation increases transmission impacts clinical outcome‚Äù.

But emphasised 20A.EU1 unlike version Sars-Cov-2 ‚Äî virus causes Covid-19 ‚Äî previously come across. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen variant sort dynamic long I‚Äôve looking genomic sequences coronavirus Europe,‚Äù said.

In particular, teams working virology laboratories establish whether 20A.EU1 carries particular mutation, ‚Äúspike protein‚Äù virus uses enter human cells, might alter behaviour. 

All viruses develop mutations ‚Äî changes individual letters genetic code ‚Äî group together new variants strains. Another mutation Sars-Cov-2, called D614G, identified believed make virus infectious. 

Joseph Fauver, genetic epidemiologist Yale University involved research published Thursday, said: ‚ÄúWe need studies like find mutations risen high frequency population, reverse-engineer see whether make virus transmissible.‚Äù

The new variant, six distinctive genetic mutations, emerged among agricultural workers north-east Spain June moved quickly local population, according study.

Tanja Stadler, professor computational evolution ETH Zurich part project, said analysis virus samples taken across Europe recent weeks showed derived variant.

‚ÄúWe see virus introduced multiple times several countries many introductions gone spread population,‚Äù Prof Stadler said.

I√±aki Comas, head SeqCovid-Spain consortium studying virus co-author study, added: ‚ÄúOne variant, aided initial super-spreading event, quickly become prevalent.‚Äù

The researchers concluded ‚Äúrisky behaviour‚Äù holidaymakers Spain ‚Äî ignoring social distancing guidelines ‚Äî ‚Äúcontinue engage behaviour home‚Äù helped spread new variant.

The research showed new variant accounted eight 10 cases UK, 80 per cent cases Spain, 60 per cent Ireland 40 per cent Switzerland France. 

Stringent lockdowns early part year helped bring initial Covid-19 surge control, new cases substantially reduced summer.

But virus spread rapidly back Europe recent weeks resurgence forced national leaders introduce painful new restrictions social activities. really know, make much sense seems give unreasonable people ample opportunity party hard spread Monday.

However, press conference mention multiple times heads state go back state governments parliaments a) argue broad support - measures properly democratically legitimized - b) implement state level regulations based federal plan came with. federalism Germany, states implement measures maybe one reason gave time this. Also, mentioned expect court cases this, probably another reason delay: try set way can't easily broken people going court. *Cries German* routine testing, every two weeks iirc.

For confined spaces need either sufficient constant ventilation combined masks shut shit down. Either mechanical ventilation, enough windows creating good enough air flow force open even cold outside, complete non starter.

I baffled churches allowed continue parties public transportation forced keep windows open times. Asians finally getting media representation lol We'll see days false positives happened person already country...

For example, first link Japanese case tested negative Taiwan October 14 October 20. tested positive October 21 entered Japan, tested Japan October 27 point tested negative.

The case Thailand Taiwanese man go Thailand work. tested negative Taiwan October 6. arrived Thailand October 8 tested negative October 11. October 17th, began cough minor fever, went local hospital tested positive October 19th. Damn, beat making reference  Winter coming. Nobody likes cold meals. /s obvious store name possible getting masks imported Taiwan haha. Say no. Raise needed, contact local news Yes, school work eCoNomY dOU Meanwhile they‚Äôre charging $135 test Oklahoma lol Way back March surgeon General said 40 percent. probably half way US Nebraska medicine got hit couple months ago Yeah, finally unlocked spanish flu 21th century edition, take award  Yeah provinces different countries governments. Covid-19 patients likely idiots violating rules I'd assume brain might abnormal going that. Might wrong though. last one sure. correct, graph data 27th 9pm much higher go.

Thats quarter % population testing positive one day. wrong, asymptomatic spread via aerosols fine. think they're invincible died themselves. Yet orange neanderthal still get votes...how many died flu? Zero. Impossible. attitude! Call idiot want supposed happen American lockdown well? impression people ignoring policies. Agree everything said - model best we‚Äôre going get moment, informed limited evidence. Jared Kushner: ""I, too, read books diseases."" top earners hold majority country's wealth, cannot consume enough drive economy entire country.

Continuing cater cutting personal corporate taxation, adding shelters loopholes, benefit average person.

I found strange people complained proposed tax restoration 70% marginal rate earnings $10 million USD. close schools, real problem. Germany. much respect appreciation Dr. Fauci, yes... understand pandemic constantly evolving, constantly moving goalposts messaging people confusing disheartening. think plays largely people ""giving up."" Oh ffs. guess pace idiotic statements overwhelmed ability keep up. Thanks. It‚Äôs Mr President got survived. üòí Still pass end year exam, French baccalaureate joke, without going france. Could USA ever test many? test capacity limited more? possible realistically. Bno newsroom, update daily mention ignoring fact Chinese tour groups could still go Taiwan, hundreds thousands Taiwanese live China frequently travel back forth. Yeah. West look like idiots compared Chinese. like really try control pandemic, long come enough excuses. Thank feedback. many months solution looking effectiveness, period Schools kindergarden stay open Germany too, fear cause deaths too. Sadly, there's enough spread US enough people wearing masks all, likely moving high filtration KF94/KN95 type masks here, particularly indoors. uhhh worst surge right now, October. twitter bot mentally ill? people die stayed inside due mental health issues increased drug use fallacy joke. nothing like American lockdown. people stay inside non stop except rare walk outside.

Me, American, left house 8 times since March 13th. Yikes. Switzerland newlyweds said memories. least two 200 guests memories wedding anymore, least 24 still hospitals. then, spread occurred Oktoberfest week later. everyone condemns wedding, one condemns organized Oktoberfest. asked question partial lockdown.
How things public transport changed? still people wearing masks nose? election style could actually good thing. Warning, complete speculation based desperate optimism incoming.
If new strain virus spread quickly probably contagious. usually comes lower lethality. speculations time contagious virus could rather attack upper respiratory tract would make less likely reaches lungs.
This might, among things better treatments different age distribution, explain lower lethality rates seeing Europe. 
At time, unlikely spike protein changed much vaccines work anymore. changed much probably would time lose ability infect human cells.
I'm expert that's lot speculation, wait scientific research. 
All I'm saying mutations likely good news bad news. got say couldn‚Äôt agree haha. want Taiwan member wants please Chinese government E Coyote tries another genius plan. nuclear power plant: clue talking about. 

About covid: Yes. pubs/restautants closed. Alcohol outside 20.00 allowed. Amateur team sports 18 allowed. Working home strongly recommended possible. invite people home total must exceed 3 people/day, living alone.

Face masks mandetory. Schools remain open. Non-essential shops also open, make sure customers following 1.5meter rule. World experts infectious disease, including Fauci: Yeah well get back normal &amp; take masks off, maybe end 2021 2022.

Any reliable source information ? disciplined enough breathe nose breath mouth, really problem? right doesn‚Äôt riot. replied every single question. You‚Äôre one skips arguments sources. 

You adeqately replied main point is, restate question, point trying make? Simply saying prevention deaths main argument. mean ""If sweden used norway's strategy countries would see similar result"" well, yet prove reply you‚Äôre sending reiterate literally irrelevant. You‚Äôre sending sources opinion, you‚Äôre sending sources irrelevant information support opinion. 


Then understood opinion, despite stating clearly multiple times.

Again, since keep going say again, Norway well nottalone prove anything, even countries comparable others directly comparable giving two shits saying.


You cannot ask source claims, read opinion many experts working together simply say false. expert, completely dishonest that] outcome Sweden would different Sweden did

You can't prove would happened reality not. prove draconian measures would definitively changed course Norway actually comparable

None sources say perfectly comparable, better alternatives. Further, stated previously, experts account many differences, cannot.

Further yet, correlation equal doesn‚Äôt matter Sweden ten times per capita deaths Norway, since healthcare system wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed


That main goal outperforming countries provable, since opinion, sources also hold said opinion ties Steve Bannon. read entire article, assume test positive denied boarding? refund? Yop propaganda, pure simple. worded way administration hand-wave say, ""we meant 'in pursuit' defeating disease"", subtext message administration flying ""Mission Accomplished"" banner.

There ounce (gram?) energy devoted discussing accomplishments respect COVID-19 virus contained eradicated. victory conditions. 

Impeding flow resources certain states, promoting snake oil treatments, muddying waters medical guidance, discounting science facts, dismantling pandemic response team 2018; celebrated. These, among others, failings undoubtedly cost American lives. Thanks info. Didn‚Äôt know. come guy work wear masks? makes huge difference. BTW, many negative tests get determined asymptomatic one gave him? That‚Äôs length time filters last included. buy filters. US screwed. rest world oriented around reasonable powers. Masks outside don¬¥t help keeping distance people still meet friends family home.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah, sub *insane*. Even sub. look comments [my Fauci saying return normal Hasnt always idea, vaccine available March/April 2021, slowly get rid restrictions throughout rest 2021, pretty much back normal vaccine going panacea everyone hoping for. Unlike image smallpox measles vaccines, COVID vaccines development give PARTIAL immunity, yet measure duration even that. Current estimates 6-9 months (partial 50-80%) protection. better nothing, everybody go bad old life immunity. Plenty people vaccinated still likely contract COVID stop taking precautions like social 2022 best case scenario vaccine development, effectiveness distribution happening without predict easily go 2026.

What pessimistic shitshow. guys actually believe it'll take *that* long return normal? people know planning reclaim lives spring summer latest. addition, virus imported overseas, source first outbreak epidemic, also question needs explained.

Earlier outbreak people digging sorts stories unusually bad flu seasons, mysterious retirement home outbreaks unexplained respiratory diseases outside China latter half 2019. cause never investigated detail, unlike doctors Wuhan did. live michigan though sadly it‚Äôs pretty chilly days. luckily times went summer mostly outdoor areas restaurants Go \-bring id thinks immune, says pandemic (Canadian here) No, it‚Äôs different now. say big red flag good people there. seismic shift.

TRUE zombie themed wedding hurr durrrrr so, wondering, stock market every time right major election people unsure end result uncertainty around come changes? Basically still restrictions much lighter getting less less strict people get vaccinated/infected. Moreover UK rate hospitalisation 40s health conditions honestly negligible see government's priority vaccinate everyone, especially vaccine supply limited. far, appears neither Democrats Republicans favor large scale lockdown. politicians publicly come strongly support lockdown? unlikely anything change Jan 21. Covid magically disappear Trump office, least that‚Äôs insane friends think... restrictions like everywhere else still one worst death rates per capita. Nope... ship sailed. 

Not mention.... way would ever happen. States independent, would legal challenges everywhere. 

Even states agreed (which wouldn't), 50% would never comply. also small island easier control big landmass. good :D Czech Republic, Ukraine Netherlands ain‚Äôt far behind, situation Northern England desperate- saw article day saying 90% hospital beds Liverpool taken COVID (I‚Äôll try find article). [archive link anyone trouble accessing article I'm really hoping improvements treatments we've seen keep death rate down, unfortunately ICUs fill I'm afraid people might saved summer die winter.

I'm hoping next year spring comes assuming vaccine distribution well-underway, daily deaths 500 year. keep total deaths 1 million end 2021. since everywhere start opening like crazy early, knows? see regeneron news. find funny things timed stock drops. Good news makes masses happy minute.

I read article believe them. like every company beginning jumping cure bandwagon. Time tell siphoning money ""research"".

All sudden public loves big pharma savior trusts now. Hilarious.

Going back shit done years deserve blind faith.

""But want hope way viral hell"", right?

Time tell. Wasn‚Äôt like March understood much virus? Exactly mail-in ballots Democratic (so I've read). So, lets take appart:

Moderna, US company never gotten vaccine market wants produce 100s millions doses vaccine started phase 3 trials. Nonetheless want COVAX initiative US explicitly part (because Chinese Health Organisation stuff). think hard time sell WHO.

Meanwhile FDA blocked continuation phase 3 trials AstraZeneca/Oxford US weeks, countries continued, verifying couple days reported case unlikely related vaccine. FDA pushing AstraZeneca's US timeline back quite bit thus, indirectly supporting Moderna lagging behind quite considerably compared AstraZeneca Biontech, big contenders vaccine.

Is smell fishy. Personally, would happy wear mask forever, like able mouth ‚Äú fuck ‚Äú people piss repercussions. difference flu mutates faster, contagious stains less deadly. causes dominant strain less deadly can't spread kills host fast.. Rona's incubation period long, deadliness affect contagiousness. fear can't look flu one. Still nearly bad 2.5 million dead, still alternative. Evil Barrett

First off, incredibly tone deaf sexist comment 2020, reeks misinformation. Second, sin parties tried put stuff knew non starter party. passed simple $400-$500/month payment unemployment, instead making simple plan tried include bull shit. get it, hate republicans, things could solved simple bills, instead seem content blaming side claiming ""too little late"" little better F\*\*\*ing nothing. think party holding American people hostage gain oblivious issues country. wife haven‚Äôt eaten restaurant since March. sucks, it‚Äôs massive risk despite anyone wants say contrary. 2-3 days ago, Utah [days away rationing look ICU changed Chris Christie‚Äôs tune masks.

The one package almost passed pelosi stopped, included anti abortion laws, snakey fuck use pandemic push agenda. That's still optimistic.  
Or mean whole country burned fucking ground April 2021 nothing left infect? so, money printer go brrr? give break course not; would make rational, informed people comfortable voting Texas government wants keep rational, informed people away polls. ~~Polling~~ Freedom Locations commented below, still bring normalcy quicker. Social changes solve problem, scientific advances treatment vaccine will. Even New Zealand resurges every time reduce restrictions DESPITE lowered cases near zero. Normalcy national mask mandate away sorry. I'm wonder we're one strictest state's masks. zero enforcement. State health department. claiming victory covid, sure alot kiwi's posting sub. Seems like would rather irrelevant them. public hangings

I mean, much likely anti maskers die covid, ok. 

Anyone know last public hanging US was? I'm concerned amount folks think able get shot go back way things 2020. 'herd immunity' Trump pushing for. 

Vaccines 'herd immunity' works differently. Actual title: Massachusetts Covid Map Case Count address points. I'm envious this. insurance paying government program/health department? said anything trump? US almosr fifth global deaths despite 25th global population.  
How fucking broken brain consider good??? need quarantine pay 1600‚Ç¨? Sweden pretty decent control experiment ours. would agree things done. lack things Ohio hit 5 6 records two weeks. yeah, right. 0.1% figure unprecedented restrictions place, lifting restrictions promoting herd immunity would undoubtedly increase number. mention know COVID extremely contagious especially indoor setting, without restrictions heading winter would quickly see unmanageable uptick COVID infections would overwhelm health care systems resulting unnecessary deaths COVID well diseases due lack resources. Simply put herd immunity outside archived vaccine reckless inhuman; appalling promoted health care industry outside hypothetical situation even it‚Äôs considered power matter policy. people know numbers, know result untold deaths; inexcusable. shown speed normalcy all, even NZ still restrictions every time lifted people get sick again. silver bullet think everyone needs realize disappear ""simple"" health measures. order takeout avoid movie theaters foreseeable future. Tegnell flat earther global covid management. facepalm try protect lives care about. Wow, Germany Sweden similar right now; Denmark's outlier much higher testing capacity. Since Germany starting soft lockdown soon, great comparison two approaches. Somebody already posted swiss cheese model managing covid...how many actually followed that? stopped first layer made political... EDF EDF EDF Yeah it‚Äôs perfect everywhere places tests readily available.  feels like SECOND vaccine news got better goalposts shifted ""nooo social distance year!!1!1!!11!!!"" like y'all actually think people ? Fauci said we'd vaccine comes November obviously everyone access nobody late 2021 Well apparently French thing only. 

Some people acting like children. They're purposefully acting like @$$holes. die twice too? Source?

Asia generally accepting masks, even COVID. People wear feeling weak/sick, never heard anyone saying masks harm you. west surprise ""CO2 poison"" thing. Car makes weird noises: trust mechanic fix it

World-wide airborne pandemic 1M+ dead: fuck experts Yea I‚Äôm guessing don‚Äôt understand statistical analysis vaccines rolled public, start getting better. people vaccinated, less people infect. get better ‚ù§Ô∏è fuck think built matters? outcome clear. **It failed**. Please send something supports opinion didn‚Äôt fail. That‚Äôs remember, something like 1.7-3.6 million US alone. based initial death rate 60+ year olds floating around 10-15% first months Even true, feel like says whole lot ENTIRE WORLD wants ditch guy running country. thought going say something like, ""You know customers come try tell what's wrong car, way experts guessing based sound something read internet?"" 

""Yes.""

""Well that's you.""   that's say ""okay, know bullshit artist.""

they desperate validate feelings. 

telling see bullshit gets flustered smell cigarettes much stronger risk COVID makes analogy fall bit.

When neighbour smokes back garden smell bedroom window. risk catching COVID scenario? think so. They'll blame Amazon shipping delays. That's true, governments typically incentivized revenue.  never said profitable start Paywalled. Otherwise, /r/Germany get daily questions people wanting work Germany, ""free healthcare"", despite actually free yes learn German. However, home made masks still better nothing. made correctly, home made masks quite good. could earnestly advocated making good masks, properly wear masks, started studies materials use asap. Instead made wearing kind masks political ""unmanly"". Trump minions heavily discredit rally good science, COVID research falls under. support weird psudeo science superstitions advocate reason. right. levels still far spring even numbers similar, due massively increased testing. FWIW, 120k US deaths patients national average life expectancy. 

Not makes okay, USA 26 million citizens 75 years old... We've lost total 0.0046% population due coronavirus. average life expectancy USA 78 years old. 

Comparatively, less 2000 Americans 35 years age succumbed COVID.  experience observation

We can. nothing say 99 people every one us sees this, sees opposite. Apart ""lack anectdotal data"". Drawing conclusions personal observation simply avoided. refuse wants come jan 20th loses election hes out. Literally almost minimum prediction.  good site tracking excess deaths? Funny say factor things can't factor things match agenda.

Factor 230k deaths based lockdowns actually happening. lockdown would far larger. There's also 300k excess death. Google proud say. Annually amount deaths consistent year there's 300k deaths more.

230k death also based people outside Trump's control people actually careful. Trump get credit people careful staying home social distancing spending majority covid-19 taking seriously.

Factor thing ain't reference event long over. 

Factor shit control. total ban beginning. Calling hoax. wearing mask. Encouraging protests lockdowns. rallies. social distancing.

Factor fact America 1/4 total deaths that's including excess deaths. says something massively different US.

If Americans obese makes disease dangerous disease deadly. matter reason.

I love said factor in...but based math. words oh okay equals that. Na, thing beat vaccine, even turn endemic. dnt believe Development generally work like this.

Lol, said beginning last lockdown...

Then 3 months PA. don‚Äôt know, like repeating buzzwords. kind putting cart horse it? 
Aren't hospitals overwhelmed cases shot up? nearly 1000 new daily hospital admits :-(

feel sorry patients sorry healthcare staff... used take that, came said FluMist effective thought market (it hard find even before). Slim none. think even would one, would largely ignored couple reasons. 1. Cant afford close again. 2.plenty care ignore it. think would large anti lockdown protests/riots across country would dwarf BLM protests. personally lockdowns without type economic package. Will/does gov want pay $5000 month everyone stay home? Nationwide rent/utilities freeze?  Neither gonna happen. really exposed need type social safety net US. Maybe need burn start over, dont know Lol @ someone downvoting perfectly accurate post. Must Trumper.   Urban population according Wikipedia comparison:

Sweden 88% (2020 est)

Germany 77,3% (2018)

Germany large cities likely people using public transport etc. It‚Äôs going increasingly difficult virus find new people infect certain point. Peru high-water mark, legitimately looks like virus waning there, we‚Äôre far behind Peru deaths per capita.

I still think could easily double total number deaths, death rate surge likely plummet. Chinas already injecting thousands people vaccine, developed similar timeline western candidates expect mass deployment next year. afraid America steal vaccines? desire anything.

I look customary development timeframe processes, note government tainting process this, compare promises made things usually go. 

Since one believe panaceas lottery tickets, assuming best. honest, pretty close considering exponential growth pattern. Or, like, inconsiderate assholes spread despite best efforts stay safe. Whats alternative? I'm sorry friend. absolutely üíØ spot commentary. 

Deniers minimizers even taking account millions others gonna die able access regular healthcare **timely fashion** idiots convinced Covid gonna affect them. ü§¶ post viral syndrome covid something else. People end dysautonomia treated lifestyle modification medication.

I really think symptoms going go away, people recover time. things linger, keep mind hopeless. Oh yes have, like sources. understand entire strategy built experts? Cool, Christian Drosten, Head Institute Virology Germany kind podcast since March. good reach inform people Generally, criminals stupid.

Also, generally, country give crap crimes committed nations. I‚Äôm suprised high start with. thought Japan mask wearing culture   Sorry dude, passing shifty laws complaining people like take protest people call nazi. Maybe instead trying ban abortion pandemic government actually concentrate thing actually killing poles abortions.  Every person half brain knew whatever measures schools taking prevent outbreaks ultimately going work. misunderstand.

Sweden big country relative ppl living there.

If remove half Sweden, still 45.94 pop/km (it's 22.97 nothingless).

Denmark pop/km 135
Italy pop/km 199
Switzerland pop/km 208
Germany pop/km 233.
UK pop/km 280.
Belgium pop/km 376.
The Netherlands pop/km 422.

If Sweden density Neterlands, would Halland, Blekinge Sk√•ne l√§n! way SOUTH 700k people live there!

So yes, matter even though point also super correct obv urban places lot people living Sweden, kind included word ""urban"". could see Biden closing state borders. look chart posted? Covid ""once 70-90 year event"" pomp circumstance we're imposing it.

BTW, even Spanish Flu caused far less burden day-to-day lives people happened (except course flu itself). racist lol you‚Äôre arguing guarantee gonna 100k daily next two weeks. leopards eating face, politically speaking.  I'm sad say it, think headline actually optimistic. many vaccines undergoing trials, none guaranteed actually work yet: 


There's reasons vaccines take years even piles money, yet vaccine ever developed corona-based virus. 


Every single one reports, everyone vaccinated end 2021, rich countries/people mid 2021, air industry recovery 2024 based vaccine developed provides enough immunity protection significant period time. 


Basically, everyone's planning betting vaccinations, one mental capacity accept happen vaccine never developed next years. 


I'm hoping bet pays frankly I'm sure world wishes never another covid case again.  


If looking hope cling besides vaccine however, chances understanding much greater develop treatments medicines greatly lower mortality rate decrease length illness, we're already starting see treatments. don‚Äôt expire/lose effectiveness? Must nice live country gives rats ass science, filled bigots illiterate asshats whining wearing mask think that? locked down. I'd say better world gives us credit for.

People die cancer, heart disease, stage 4 renal failure still counted Covid. 

Why told several times anyone Covid death certificate counted Covid year 300,000 people dead normal amount time US. So, actually undercounting Covid deaths likely

This tricky metric people dont think fully.

Lets abstract math experiment.

Lets say ""Country X"" ""death counts"" looked like this. (I use simple abstract numbers make point)

2015 - 7 
2016 - 8 
2017 - 9 
2018 - 10 
2019 - 11 

Ok .. something pretty clear going there, right? deaths increasing. would expected .. say .. country growing (bigger population means people dying)

OR ...

If something demographic going on, like say big bump Baby Boomers reaching dying age.

So numbers mind, said 2020 looked like - 

2020 - 12.

Then completely normal right? trend saw 2015 - 2019 continued.

But say going last 5 years find ""average death count""?

Well would go 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 45 / 5 = 9

So ""average deaths"" 2015 - 2019 would ""9"" there.

And comes 2020 ""12""!

Holy shit! ""12"" THREE 2015 - 2019 average ""9""!!!

""What SLAUGHTER occurred 2020?""

Can see point? Looked one way, 2020 would logical continuation year-by-year upward trend.

But situation, take ""average last 5 years compare"" approach, sudden looks like outlier.

And tell USA's population growing steadily. also say Baby Boomer Bump (AKA ""Grey Tsunami"") hitting dying age. 

So *expected* every year deaths year before. would strange stayed constant. finally, emotion regulation, authors asked participants rate use adaptive maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. Again, thinking yourself, much would say use following swamped negative emotions?  think plan best.  tell worse things life.  keep thinking terrible experienced.  feel others responsible happened.  think accept happened.  think pleasant things nothing it.  feel others responsible happened.  think learn something situation.  preoccupied think feel experienced.  adaptive emotion strategies scale reflected high agreement ratings items 1, 2, 5, 6, 8. less adaptive strategies reflected items 3, 4, 7, 9. final item scale asked participants rate use emotional suppression, another maladaptive strategy,¬†with items ‚ÄúWhen feeling negative emotions, make sure express them.‚Äù  findings revealed high introversion able **draw upon adaptive emotion-regulating strategies indeed best able¬†to preserve well-being relief loneliness**.

Yikes.  help coming election either. Trump could still win. 

Even Biden wins, get sworn til January 20th, 2021. Yeah, much want believe... make sense cases flights leave [18 people. 

That article also says done 90k tests September. Taking look testing absolutely abysmal. Seems like maybe issue ""if test find cases"". taking seriously?

Because everything half measure lips service since initially took decisive action. turn many ill people away back looking bad case wise country . Literally people grovleing feet find place mom/dad/son/daughter . Sadly hospital already full brim . mostly wait people die small offchance recover beds free .

But old people need kept warm cold, cold warm. use lot resources.

Now Covid goes around obviously elderly vulnerable. underneath lies pressing question. point accept mortal?

And think many people attitude wanting get lives ignore measures sort underlying indifference willing throw dice, somewhere deep inside accepting mortality.

In way method conquer death willfully ignoring risks act defiance.

Once vaccine, bet elderly get first. one argue it. anyway. Yeah, condolences. üò• Meh, new use application device originally filed patent 2015.

He‚Äôs one say whatever Trump wants say. 

I think politics unfortunately played huge part things haven‚Äôt properly distributed. vaccine way urgency masks IMO state working really hard distribution plans ready vaccine available. think also helps vaccine going given people groups feel makes distribution easier precise. Countries counting vaccine economies, aka money. They‚Äôre going whatever make sure people get vaccine economies start rolling again. doubt it, would completely saturate testing capacity. 70% November 2019 sale, details complete. Doxed? fully open month sti less outbreaks places restrictions. everyone except lockdowns answer.

It help Florida's counts really skewed - Negative results get counted, positives get counted once: comparing florida's data St John's dashboard pretty big discrepancy.

As Florida's next major outbreak - give weeks, Florida way, midwest surge may tied Sturgis event (that pretty much everyone rides to, within 200-400 miles radius) last month, lack mask mandates (In hot spots like Miami, masks still mandated)...along staying indoors since getting colder...

I hope explanation helps. Also, thinking trying find virtual book club something, much hate zoom, really miss social interactions. nonsense.

Nobody knows.

Pfizer even reached level get interim analysis done. Let alone know data show efficacy.


Fauci simply saying random shit. real answer MAYBE April. Maybe never.

That it.  majority people likely wearing masks interactions. people see least close family regularly without masks. High risk essential workers go home take masks.

So plenty opportunities people infect family friends mask with.

Masking especially hard young families. 2 year olds kids general 5. 

So people say mask usage high. Mask usage public easier. would bet compliance even among careful people gets sketchy people see close local family friends. Germany, allowed thousands fans soccer stadiums bars open. Even concerts 1000 people big weddings 150 persons allowed. planned October concerts could start idea cancelled quickly. even free corona tests travellers coming back risk country. Fucking amazing money grab lol wonder hydroxy $3 shit put down. people made fuck ton money FL went averaging ~2,500 cases day late September averaging 4,000 ... that's called uptick.  thing already lockdowns earlier year. Masks mandatory still face insane amount cases - choice either lockdown year lockdown seems.

Also point time international flights stopped, virus kept spreading, huge problem imho. Relevant video: County historically Republican/conservative stronghold. got alert Atlantic 80% members one party approve WH COVID response. Boggles mind.

Sarcasm below, dont read.

January 14th '23, US Coronavirus Cases surpass 210million. Yeah nay, thats total since Feb'20. Currently active 150k.

Also, Oct. 29th 2020, US deaths traffic accident surpass 110million. total since 1890, year. really Halloween would toss kid bag candy say go pal, still allowed eat 2 pieces day. wonder would compromise cohort groups 5 10 home socializing? mean, isolate bedroom 5 days waiting test results, hell. can‚Äôt imagine 3.5 months. woman question moved right locked in, given couple hours notice, could take 5 changes clothes her. got ‚Äúnew‚Äù room, furniture covered black garbage bags (it another residents room, moved covid wing). 3.5 months, alone room clothes unusable furniture. cbc‚Äôs current Matt Galloway.

That huge eye opener me, can‚Äôt expect seniors bear brunt go lives. going get Covid eventually, regardless, unless vaccine becomes available.  Precautions slow down. Relative population Germany tested WAY less US.

I would assume daily new tests still much lower (again relative population) US.

Yet daily new cases growing US levels. less tests.


It almost like idea ""stop virus"" joke.

Unless eradicate seal (ie Iceland, New Zealand, SK, Taiwan,etc) virus going burn out.

Christian right groups denied coronavirus cases exist ‚Äì others claimed virus deliberately made China.

Okay, omit one stored lab &amp; accidentally released China? 

The media wont acknowledge theory reasonable, instead focus obscure ones &amp; disregard valid questions need answered. reading situation well- can't certain vaccine adjuvanted (I think not? anyone clear I'd appreciate it)- zero local effects whatsoever. like norovirus... I've heard similar reports Singapore foreign workers treated like prisoners, jammed crowded rooms fed substandard food. frustrating man, hear grandparents say Walz done terrible job? Like else do? Cant close borders, cant print money help small businesses Minnesotans get this. Guess pile bodies rest country. surprised. seem like social

Maybe stop living terror thing worse lot things there, well march 2020. country deep hatred ""others"" do? straight feel like someone manipulating us civil war. Yeah still think it'll like Q3 2021 virus getting weaker, anything gaining momentum winter season.

There evidence increased decreased virulence. Transmissibility different  fair, say long corner is.

/s No, really. Florida‚Äôs economy great hospitalizations down. 

And no, tell right restrictions stringent now. Even 30% working vaccine, let alone 70%. chances getting vaccine slim none. virus sucks, can‚Äôt let fallout worse. 

And social aspect historically pandemics end socially end medically. Humans natural social distancing LOT livelihoods needs met human contact. It‚Äôs simply worth period time. State governments loosing tax money revenue quickly. measures sustainable entire population long. Measures absolutely scaled back dramatically time next year. way around it. kind point, though..... Technically 2000 pre-existing conditions fix everything people comply figure ways around it. significantly reduce interactions needed El Paso serious trouble hospital capacity hundreds miles nearest sizeable city Texas. could evidence need report numbers like market indexes garner better attention.

Arizona cases today 1,101 +136(¬±12.4%). He's scientist. They've known shit like that. sure, jive Taiwan consistently exporting case 6 here

conclusion: world high alert anyone arriving taiwan, envy ass. Russia stands benefit destabilisation country stronger economy.

Trump destabilising force.

What's good Russia good Trump. 

So, question, yes - indirectly independently. Free speech free speech whether backed facts Oh, completely agree. wear well-fitted R95 days. cloth mask walking around I'd terrified. Here‚Äôs thing. States afraid it‚Äôs pointless feds don‚Äôt doit. Feds pointing states say it‚Äôs pointless states don‚Äôt it.

How shut fuck stop pointing fingers, EVERYONE IT!? Yes. injects vaccine takes mask sit next infected father doctor. doesn‚Äôt inject virus. sounds terrifying. Stay safe.  backups important, including off-site backup. believe midwest/rust belt right getting ravaged mask wearing low general

They low masking compliance, going up. stupid exact wrong time. USA USA USA! They‚Äôve dropped overall they‚Äôre still way lot places, unfortunately. Aww thanks really appreciate compliment. number one yo! many? 200,000 enough? Six year olds getting shot desks enough? America fucked. many never recover cheet brains somehow gets re-elected. It‚Äôs desperately sad looking afar someone enjoys many aspects American culture. can‚Äôt even imagine people empathy brains live desecration great nation. Still looking effective lockdown articles? Great illustrations. Aerosol diagrams like beginning put perspective me. sure seem true others... data.

Anyway, bode well upcoming holidays N. Hemisphere. Less ventilation due cold. Definitely shouting...lol... lot sociological factors. Th1 doesn‚Äôt inhibit antibody production, inhibits Th2 activation downstream secretion interleukins stop cytokines storm. Th1 still activate B cells. worse B cell activation Th1 inferior ineffective way produce antibodies doesn‚Äôt suppress like say. Yeah. lockdown either. Compared Europe though. brother held back twice 2 half years younger finished school 2 years dropped final 2 years (4 years behind total)and apprenticeship. Taiwan hardly best Chinese province  Taiwan number one! Cant reach billions new daily case already finally end insanity... Notably, quarantines enforced there. honor system BS like quarantine isolation requirements US. Yet, Coronavirus Pandemic over, careful, still medicine treat you! know discretion investments 401k.... don‚Äôt buy company stock  International travel requires quarantine. Domestic travel flights record levels tho. Imagine empathizing BLM performative woke ""allies"" stage game. There's way US nationally locks elections, maybe January. ""Plus half population dies, we'll tax survivors double!"" Vietnam general lockdown measure? dont think understood saying. know? Taiwan tests least exporting recommended daily dosage vitamin D? got bottle D3 1k IE, apothecary told two pills day, sister taking one pill day, bottle says 1 pill every two days. First: misleading attempt suggest Trump specifically called coronavirus hoax. Trump's comments bit confusing, Biden's ad leaves important context dishonestly edits two soundbites together. Wuhan style ""weld yout doors shut down"" lockdown. misinformation downplay efforts city, backfired, making people resistant serious (not half-assed) lockdowns.  imported surgical masks Taiwan. badass surgical masks existence. I'm surprised people wear sake looking awesome. lot people drinking death, sadly. already late US admitted March.  BOOF BOOF BOOF BOOF BOOF BOOF BOOF BOOF BOOF graphics seriously top notch. Kudos Luis Almod√≥var, looks like put together Yes.

As far know, every single case purported fomite transmission, read lines, turns type logic: ""we trace source infection, therefore must elevator button frozen shrimps"", usually zero evidence behind it. NZ export cases, Taiwan regular basis. best sugar coat anything Americans. I've actually noticed opposite... ha live Taipei feel majority still wear masks public... Three weeks ago Taichung I'd say half people masks, Yilan past weekend would say maybe quarter people wearing masks. I‚Äôm offended negligent treason well. came market closed. Read book bro, get job impressions China may mostly western media Hollywood movies. Go Youtube search ""streets China"", find many foreign vloggers introducing real cities, real streets, real people real life China. may surprise you, lot. hence every dead american unemployed American... Republicans see sliver lining... time nearly 3x many died heart disease. terrible misleading I'm prepping possibility civil unrest election, seems fairly unlikely would long-term supply shortages. think Kaohsiung still effect Navy ship scare, people bit cautious there. Covid numbers per head capita quite bit worse Europe. sure, appears China somewhat better grip advantages living totalitarian state (not many suggest) blame you. answer door mask. thee person wearing one, ask to, leave. safety passing risk husband important ""inconveniencing"" them. go talking behind screen! Good thing part nobody checks numbers small surrounded water seems best protection covid. compromise government provide stimulus support people difficult time, rather funding rich buddies need it. ‚Äúsecond wave‚Äù whatever stupid way saying ‚ÄúWe opened soon‚Äù.

The increase spread related weather season, fact EU opened travel ‚Äúnormalcies‚Äù, time give ‚Äúrecommendations‚Äù instead actual mandatory rules.

To keep money-train rolling, reason.

They f*cked up, plain simple reap whirlwind. Stopped publishing excess death, ban testing asymptomatic people invest heavily promoting lol adults way higher chance dying kids especially they're old. aren‚Äôt member state. Yeah yeah ppl China took masks, came lockdown, pretended already gone back normal life coersion Chinese government. look tough west. Yeah makes lot sense. IIRC signs pointed towards Russia taking already published data American vaccine started making testing claiming wss development. would want sugar coat dead people? Wear full respirator mask. helps keeping safe preventing touching face much. deserve what‚Äôs coming them. point, know better. True adults way higher chance dying compared kids. gonna put home office. really liked going back office too.. 

You're right school, least kids depressed. also use realistic exemple. undestand aerosol farts. place can't fart without smelled wear mask stay long. Maks like bed covers, works open windows.  'There's way sugarcoat it: Somebody dies heart disease every 36 seconds. 

See use scary titles things too. I'm saying covid taken lightly misleading titles play peoples  Norway, Sweden Denmark showed reductions mobility mid March (week 12). that, mobility started slowly rising Norway Denmark Sweden. time hospital admissions well deaths started sharp rise Sweden. don‚Äôt think strategy main factor point seeing time frame rise three weeks three countries. seems likely result outbreak week 12. teachers get full respirator face mask microphone yell. Students given use surgical mask possible. fine? venue shut Time would best judge. stopped counting 100 seconds, would deaths. Romania, cases exploded exactly 2 weeks opening schools. see lockdown keeps schools open makes sense. We‚Äôve banned tourists; business travellers apply permit, test negative arrival quarantine upon arrival. reallllly hope numbers seep kind majority mindset stupid continue pointless wars ""terror"" protect American lives. chances killed terrorist attack literally infinitesimal compared ways could die. American public realize ridiculous fear mongering become? Meanwhile 1 American dying every 107 second hard believe sounds so....morbid. *easier* *certain* think that's meant based 2nd sentence war criminal behavior

low-key think maybe that's idea particular retirement home grandmother here, stateside, started previous months possible wave talk phone far distance outside. Though worth remembering private decisions made individual nursing home. think like March could go run hour far home Anybody got link White House declaring over? care earnings people siphon value employees, employees themselves. lift finger help employees them. making assumptions. I‚Äôm exact opposite. 

Who they? would matter clearly stated didn‚Äôt prove it? source objectively, convincingly scientifically describes cause effect here, I‚Äôll take it. (Hint: tabloid won‚Äôt work)

It‚Äôs anecdotal mate. Don‚Äôt use proof anything. Wrong, one American dies every 4-5 seconds. Source: story must wrong!? 'President' says he's single-handedly conqurred pandemic. virus gone! ^(/s) She‚Äôs quadrupling insanity. Grifting art, she‚Äôs trying Picasso. alternatives ?


Get ill, mildly even... Loose 50% lung capacity two weeks later. profit. We'll power trough. There's nothing else do. wear damn mask, wash hands avoid unnecessary meetings/people.

Keep eye neighbours loved ones keep sane taking care yourself. Binge series, read book, go walk, listen podcast, play games, make long calls friends instead texting, ...

And hey, least live somewhere majority people wear masks. agree could possibility, (according article) deliberately make choice enough vaccines? point surely can't sit around vulnerable vaccinated continue lockdowns case vaccines might slightly bad side effects. Either point open continue vaccinations. final point: means get herd immunity vaccines vulnerable people fail become immune vaccines, herd protection. offer tangible solution problem

Okay, charge tax $200 per ton carbon emitted, institute border adjustment tax goods countries without equivalent carbon tax, enter international agreement monitoring verification like Montreal Protocol, take part proceeds carbon tax use energy aid developing countries, take remainder return every household equally Green Dividend, amount households would still larger higher prices paid result tax, creating modest universal basic minimum income? failed impeachment

He actually impeached btw mean say recently beat Covid-19? task force pissed  Chiayi. night market type areas Saturday night. official places like banks, mask use still 100% interestingly definitely varies. amount shit managed fuck one term honestly mind boggling. Oh thought hand sanitizer? inject Bleach drink hand sanitizer backwards? sound good thoughtful parent. kido lucky you. would probably go passed stimulus plan knows ever happen. I'd careful calling self New Zealander It‚Äôs covid deaths lol wouldn‚Äôt offices also places low transmission? I‚Äôm confused allowing kids go school parents stay home logic. Clearly reinfection bigger deal mainstream narrative willing consider. Good bot solution is? many intelligent people know fall trap. see stable numbers assume lockdown waste time, cure worse disease, instead trying imagine curve would looked like lockdown place. Trumps policies mean

And literally gave even trying UBI fix suicidal teen learn via Zoom either Japan something say...

Opinion pieces like need laughed ridiculed pieces garbage author, Joseph A.

I‚Äôm permanent remote employee, company still plans call folks office. side evil.

How pandemic denial opposing scientists proposals mitigating measures evil even Americans die hundreds thousands? ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know‚Äù enough convince young people stop living lives. don‚Äôt know we‚Äôll die kill someone else car crash tomorrow, still drive it‚Äôs deemed acceptable risk go daily lives. 

As young person, part wearing masks I‚Äôm store, getting flu shot washing hands. Similar wear seatbelt, maintain car, drive safely road. 

Why would want stop things enjoy like seeing friends, going restaurant, visiting non-elderly family risk potential adverse outcome (which ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know‚Äù even occur) low? Herd immunity happen without vaccination. Staggering. eleven days ago crossed 400K mark first time globally. winter going really bad. one, increased community spread going cause longer harsher shutdowns, two loved ones may risk, three minimal symptoms still result long-COVID and/or vascular damage. Wait people start catching flu corona virus. üíÄ didn‚Äôt know that. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm sorry insulted him. don‚Äôt think celebrations that‚Äôs opinion. least mask up. It'll help.

Trump merely symptom much deeper cultural issue. frankly, see United States remains ""united"" face this. reached egregious levels dysfunction, simultaneously facing existential threats. Good luck... Probably president take shit serious. wear mask I'm douchebag thinks impairs rights I'm totally sold masks preventing spread. Yes n95's would different there's lot studies saying virus airborne lot cloth masks may much think. wear mask best helps, worse really anything. said, look places like New Zealand Victoria Australia likely harsh lockdown stopped masks. Told ya- fauci said 2022 tonight abc news politics important coming together

How come together administration still calling pandemic hoax opposing mitigating measures

While ALSO closing senate vacation instead passing relief bill election? kidding....I spent 2 hours talking husband whether need Covid test I'm sort 2 day long anxiety attack headache, cold sweats brain fog.
I fears, mean peoples reaction Covid election stressing out. interesting see happens. may rhetoric telling people avoid mail absentee voting go in-person instead backfire bit. Maybe. dementia patient can't see doctor tumbles death spiral COVID death mismanaged response hospital access ""elective procedures"" started time. countries absolutely nothing like US. Yes, compromise kill 150k? Unfortunately one part actually evil time. They're willingly sacrificing people's lives livelihoods politics. drone strikes used for. true there's still risk transmission masked, one consider cure all. also worth pointing masks always helpful: even get infected masked, viral load reduced, significantly lowering likelihood hospitalization/severe outcomes. goes wearing mask infected, spreading much less otherwise  taken seriously begin nipped bud.... Like China, Vietnam Thailand did.

Instead busy thinking... blaming.... politicians. 

We unprepared. Thank god ifr 1 %. Imagine many times deadly. Mr Krabs you? much 50% think comparison pretty fair

I'd rather disabled 60 years dead.  So, wear mask one several mitigating factors. Got it.

I trust point. Hit nail head. People can‚Äôt grasp massive blow suffer don‚Äôt lock sort restriction. don‚Äôt restrictions. Hospitals hit breaking point. Death rates sky rocket. health system fail. bam domino effect. 5 ways Covid messed mental health. Stretched out, tied round, wrung out, beat soundly hung out. !RemindMe 33 days one remotely credible ever said would return normal June 2020 time 2020.  makes DIY throw quilt table put tiny heater underneath. winter incredibly cozy. make sure heating element use fire risk.  specific. start following virus? say China ""did world favors initially"", mean ""initially""? talking December early January? What's time frame? 

I hard time believing following closely. sounds likely parroting things heard said. 

Not like pissing contest, following dozens epidemiologists infectious disease experts starting around January 15th. reading preprint articles, first peer reviewed Journal articles watching daily case numbers published official Chinese websites.

I would say impression Chinese we're transparent based reaction saw dozens epidemiologists infectious disease experts reviewing pouring data clinical observations released Chinese Physicians. 

As China discovering course illness disease, we. I'm entirely understanding mean say Chinese suppressing information virus. Again, go ahead specific. good human ""mirror"" scenario happens one happens other. backups. know long server finally something. could restore week ago code could still place.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Can‚Äôt read? He‚Äôs bot, stupid bot. true, people also wore masks pollution. guess really helped covid happened large factor korea performed official now? 

California handling it. La particular averted lot death. Sf way smaller really stellar one creates whole slew issues. agree would nice able get doctors nurses help covid robbing peter pay paul. ontario shut non essential medical treatments seeing much higher rate advanced cancers. taking elsewhere isnt really viable option. comment removed, I'll reply really feel uncivil.

You originally said Florida right many deaths New York. I'm saying two areas alternative timeline, I'm saying literally nobody US many deaths New York deaths occurred specific time frame circumstances unique time frame hopefully never repeated. 

In terms states now, six months ago, Florida looks worse. That's it, that's saying.

As political rhetoric I'm guessing got deleted... er, no. I'm US. dog fight, nearly enough information Florida general representative particular base opinions that. I'll go actual numbers. plenty studies support it. fact think paying attention symptoms really important shows don‚Äôt clue virus spread You‚Äôd make good bot though money. power, control, paranoia.  2 cases potentially new cases. case already isolation. hope Reddit‚Äôs Santa exchange earlier year. I‚Äôd like help people groceries. 7000 people died too, one worst (confirmed) daily death tolls we‚Äôve since Spring wave. There‚Äôs little bit hypochondriac culture (Korea). Every time someone cold want go doctor checked out, wear mask people don‚Äôt get it. Honestly pandemic, thought little bit much, I‚Äôm thankful now.

People also wore masks often microdust air pollution. good lungs all. thought says December last week. Whatever irrelevant see debt going start mattering Republicans 80 days. don‚Äôt expect stimulus lame-duck session. want hang incoming Democrats January. really scary part, even Biden elected, anti-common sense people act even divisive unreasonable...

So unless Biden plans full national lockdown martial law style there's way trajectory changing.  Motivation, regardless source goal good thing instance. That‚Äôs worry eh. Hit miss whether there‚Äôs delivery pickup slot. Costco‚Äôs ‚Äú2 day delivery‚Äù taking week. Planning ahead key. 

Sorry hear #‚Äôs. Stay safe friend Well, outside experts could helped initially, Chines government ass hats decided allow entry...and deny even problem.

Yep, US Europe bungled it. Managed poorly.

Doesn‚Äôt excuse fact chance stop even really got started. Chinese government pissed away chance pay price. guys system? (Cries American) someone living Thailand, little covid months now, yet continuing widespread mask use, boggles mind even still question debate. wear damn mask! like Socialist-Zero! oh damn lol, thank taking time share non paywalled article SARS1 coronavirus people still immunity today. think is? Trump never shut down. didn‚Äôt even order buses worshipers freezing. Left stranded. Covid different. 
‚Äú‚ÄúIf would rather die,‚Äù said Scrooge, ‚Äúthey better it, decrease surplus population.‚Äù Yes, mask still risks. wonder adjusted types masks see results that. Let get straight. You‚Äôre concerned .02% chance death(20-49 year old assumed age, CDC Current best estimate here: thousands old people dying alone crying bed unable eat? Really? large majority people fuckin idiots. leadership balls protect people stupidity. Or, otherwise, remove idiots together. Harsher, much better long term outcomes.

Anyway, trying say China controlled virus extremely strict lockdowns, even boarding doors morons stay indoors. 

Yeah, we're China, normal times, either. people fail understand exceptional circumstances require exceptional measures, responsibility duty government enforce rules.

Had Europe balls impose block 3 months extremely strict lockdown, providing help work home needed assistance (financial otherwise), could eliminated shit.

Just 3 months, followed forced quarantine testing anyone coming outside. 

And could lived like last year - lockdown, corona cases, problems. 

As economy, impact less everywhere, people traveling less, probably spending less, eating less etc. We've seen countries refused lock suffer economic problems everyone else. that's bad excuse locking down. worth, saw quite people wearing long covid, lot 2-3 100 They'd save that. Honesly got one quote $1k window they're pretty big Feels better blame someone something. mean could understand colleges wanting standpoint campus people part selling. companies client see difference quality people work home make sense. like gym we're supposed wipe equipment we're done it, issue me. opened bar August 2019. Temporarily closed March 2020. We‚Äôve closed longer open. Kinda feels like adrift see...but parents basement. seems like companies running show want make money. Feds US can't trusted definitely shouldn‚Äôt. filtered Democrat/republican/Trump/Biden half comments sub would gone. Sorry has. Personally I‚Äôm way less techy people might expect, sometimes ask questions myself.

I assure you, however, don‚Äôt use words absurd ones mentioned get flagged. wild examples real words add. Nobody listened truth known anyway.  Otherwise known 25 cases day. Bro used 3 wishes one dude Well it‚Äôs good thing trump fighting tooth nail get rid pre existing conditions right now. Lol, look white collar bubble boy. Yup. South Koreans found early pandemic, spreading virus Dague Korean Jesus mass event. Karaoke bars. front page like two days ago 'Semblance Normality' Again

the feeling normalcy come get used changes (and become normal) rather changes reverted return old ways.

Humans pretty adaptable creatures. Every month passes, masks feel like another article clothing. That's false equivalency. People unemployed consumer spending American consumers feel safe leaving house. allowed weddings large gatherings sports attendance return full things would get bad quick would go back full lockdown *nobody* wants that. See stupid mentality. may dry cough three weeks everyone pop gets it, 20-30% need hospitalized 1-2% die maybe ppl dont prefer lockdown Yes certificate leave house. don‚Äôt like all. We‚Äôve also lot time production get adjusted. Sure, restaurants reopening, shifted back companies know people home. Logistics packaging supplies smaller quantities certainly improved (as evidenced 50,000 bottles hand sanitizer every store now).

We‚Äôve also learned lot spread. Going grocery store doesn‚Äôt feel like hazmat zone reserved bi-weekly event.

Going store quickly became excuse get first round here, one even faster locking again. visits less reasons buys big.

Hoarding course self fulfilling I‚Äôm sure areas get hit items seems likely come back far faster. keeping kids school harmful public health. Keeping office workers WFM doesn‚Äôt hurt anyone, keeping elementary kids special needs kids school kills. correct. moved Oregon Nebraska month ago. ads TV, pushed social media far different. Deleted social media reddit, got rid tv paid services. r/StupidIsAsStupidDoes think anyone expecting cases go zero, get back manageable levels.

I'm speaking someone survived many years homeless child. Good luck all. Join in, still 3 wishes remaining. really aren‚Äôt good alternatives locking down. Masks hand washing great tools simply aren‚Äôt enough. 

We can‚Äôt simply let entire population get sick. Even people don‚Äôt get deathly ill, many many simply don‚Äôt unlimited supply medical equipment, trained staff, unlimited hospital bed capacity. Additionally, large segment workforce sick one time (even it‚Äôs 10-20%) would greatly disrupt supply chain goods services. problems beginning less 5% total population course 5 months *with* lockdown measures.

The place go cuts polar opposite. Health screening fill beforehand, temperature check door, mandatory use hand sanitizer upon entering, customers required wait outside time appointment, course masks mandatory stylists customers.

I honestly even consider going anyplace fewer protocols place. 

Anyway, wish luck hope able stay safe healthy! Quel malheur (what bad luck, sad). ""Malheur"" means bad luck etc. French. earth name county that?! play defense like NBA fine sounds like someone made Monkey's Paw wish definition ‚Äúcompletely normal‚Äù one would police called walking bank bandana around face. believe years that, bet people going maskless bars mid q2 next year Federal government gives grants make vaccine... federal government buys vaccine....

Ok first republicans fought first 1200 wanted give 600, republicans wanted give nothing

Now let try:

""Well want do? measures all? Let country fill corpses jobs left grave diggers Instagram personalities sending thoughts prayers!?""

Yay fun pointless. Masks work, enough alone stop highly contagious virus. People restaurants bars can't wear masks eat drink. People gather together 3+ hours breathe much virus masks help (unless wear n95). always portion community wear properly.

Ok... makes feel slightly better seems like odds go hospital go every week. % deaths come nursing home scandal? anyone know covid guidelines exposed outside? husband around someone tested positive covid outside, maybe 2 ft apart 30 minutes. muh freedoms

I love certain people's freedoms worth risking people's lives..

They're denial big pieces shit are. Well fair. gets paid millions play ball team world title it. ya shows attitude people. Collateral damage always inevitable, numbers clearly show lock downs work bring deaths. horrible someone dies something like this, equally heartbreaking hear someone dying literally place care sick. everything overloaded. really needs happen everyone wear damn mask, clean hands, avoid unnecessary outings. everyone simple things, would likely need mild restrictions. no, people selfish something basic. Costco packed today [archive link anyone trouble accessing article That's want hook providing financial relief businesses. France actually lockdown.

Anyway, screaming someone agrees shouldn‚Äôt going that? 
From I‚Äôve seen, people favor covid restrictions (during unchecked community spread brought multiple infrastructure failures) *also* favor financial relief people don‚Äôt situation. they‚Äôre not, feel free call out. going people *might* ‚Äúemployed‚Äù (which already big category almost meaningless) think lockdowns *can* necessary *when rampant spread novel virus* seems like you‚Äôre aiming wrong target. 500 thousand people contracted last week America. think families moved yet? think Pfizer knows internally close. Like place infamous russian ""pee pee tape""? Oh my... winning? kind hard governors dont believe covid real. seriously think North Korea, Cuba Venezuela would utopias without hunger, poverty, corruption, unemployment crime left devices?

Because do, bridge sell you... Ohhh, 78,000 new cases today alone. currently cumulative 3 million active cases.

The 45,000 hospitalized cumulative numbers people currently hospitalized. I‚Äôm sure exactly many new hospitalizations solely today.

Edit - there‚Äôs also lag period case detected condition deteriorates enough hospitalized. cumulative hospitalizations may correspond cumulative active cases 1-2 weeks ago. Donnie T!  Hang there!

Share can. People edge stocking up, doubt. people extra cash. Wow I'm surprised data actually available. tried muddy little bit combining COVID-19, influenza pneumonia deaths different combinations...



But..

The total number deaths US 2020 pneumonia, covid, and/or flu 339,473, far (according data). 134k deaths respiratory infections officially attributed COVID-19, easily 100k would expect point flu cases bad flu year. yeah definitely 300k point, counting death certificates written yet. really debate. bunch trash humans care others pretending debate made minds long ago, resounding ""screw everyone else"". call vote confidence President Trump Misread above. 

I thought asked test result time death b didn‚Äôt see scenario class, ventilated, masks? good share family members dont get üëç clearly aren‚Äôt west coast amazing dow 10,000 believe it‚Äôs less accurate. lot articles keep coming rapid testing, you‚Äôd think would good enough. I‚Äôm expert course, hopefully close better testing. lockdown way programs made assumption stopgaps fed could get help packages place worst case scenarios. don‚Äôt adapt, innovate overcome. We‚Äôve countless pandemics before, one made us fundamentally change species‚Äô social emotional needs. please stop new normal bullshit, never going normal Trump think says something, makes reality? That's narcissistic, that's like messiah complex. Aspirin essential except cases.

However least months post primary infection.

A months really I'm thinking think long term immunity. I've assuming since beginning people could find protection reinfection least 6 months, need mount kind immune response clear survive initial infection all. Okay dude, resembles one right lol

not really Come on, bro. Fuck off. wrong know it. dude saying 1-2 weeks we'd know vaccine end November. burden proof look fucking obvious. explain organizations understanding science vaccine safety required approve vaccine?  kids need socialize.

We're ending one world's longest lockdowns - one initially mandated masks, curfew, 5km limit, closure everything essential businesses 23 hours indoors - average 2.5 cases day, 725/day. ( understand I'm downvoted) get coming let rephrase. Why, take extra measures protect like one would use seatbelt protect car. (Just saying general mentioned wear seatbelt)

The people go without masks longer drag inadvertently cause businesses close doors cause death toll climb steadily higher. lot people want play see they'll work later. put work now, wear mask distance, avoid risky behaviors increase spread, way play later. 

For example, right businesses curbside, limiting people coming lobbies closed entirely struggling stay afloat. quicker get quicker go back almost ""pre-pandemic"". moment businesses going want you, friends, family anyone else know fly in, drive in, walk best time have. point thing worrying get come back spend money keep business going trying adhere extra stuff going on.

I hear lot generation younger gen social media, tv, talking friends, hearing coworkers want change world better want accomplish leave mark. prime opportunity us something like happens practically lifetime.

Tl;dr: Help prevent spread even wearing mask, distancing, avoiding behaviors increase spread help bring back pre-pandemic environment. Republicans thinking keeps unemployment numbers lower thats plus. ;) id love see stats lockdown didnt help. sums Americans despised worldwide.

The people US victims systematic ruthless propaganda playing psychological games. become accomplices genocide kind process, sad powerful consequence. People eventually caught, need get automatic lifetime chance parole Well, partial lockdown they'll reevaluate two weeks determine whether sufficient, needs stepped up, partially loosened.

I think good France less all-or-nothing approach fighting covid. unfortunately suspect bit late partial lockdown, we'll know two weeks. I'm still trouble finding bread flour. know tell man, basically new strain developed Spain due summer vacations spread well across Europe Netherlands mandate masks, strictly recommend it. one explaining use properly. even see Rutte fold away blue mask put pocket next use. 

Single use mask expect outside infected use, bin it. 

And dutch government seems trying micromanage going maximize capacity hospitals months. talk hammer dance use plastic squeaky hammer first. talk use big hammer soon nothing numbers rise week. (autumn holiday week maybe?). Yeah severe lockdowns coming sometimes feels like want herd strategy way. electing trump?!   Relying modern-day Americans comply honor system seems optimistic. Indeed, N95 (or KF94) proven work good. See story people say (me included) need change mask every day, reuse 5 times leave alone several days. Basically need 5 (one per weekday) rotate them, last month 5 masks [25th stuff [prima getting weird watching USA euthanize itself.  üòµ  ü§ï  üëª That's country... but, that's can't open it.

I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm tired seeing ‚Äúthe main problem X religion!‚Äù

The main problem (though definitely problem) poor education lack exposure diverse cultures people. Schools America known great ventilation. /s would guess risk zero. Yep. main screw-up New Zealand. First thing authorities lie asses masks unhelpful. think kids going give bring home? get we'll see goes guess. want go full lockdown yet.

In 2 weeks, situation improved, they'll probably close schools, too. think they're right first check whether works without closing schools, happens sufficient, situation much, much simpler children parents. think done sooner. Bro it‚Äôs 7 months still dumb? You‚Äôre coronavirus subreddit. Fucking read! Holy shit. Where'd get from? That‚Äôs odd take always peak... everybody sick, can't ""new cases"" make SENSE stop mixing people going anywhere essential kids teachers swirling around groups hundred every day ferrying virus around... yes young ""don't get sick"" they're still going take virus make copies spread it... I'm baffled. Went Jersey Mike's yesterday. one jackass wore mask. Obviously someone want treated like little kid. Waiters aren‚Äôt essential workers. go school mingle large groups. 

Never understand locking types businesses others. can‚Äôt go socialise, gather weddings events? Still amount people proximity one other.  Scared? live Nova Scotia, one lowest case counts North America, scared anymore (except outsiders). Arguably people less scared general sense prepared confident. 

We early mask mandate worked really well initial spread, maximum one new case per day, usually people entering region self isolate enter. Europe Right, de facto Chinese province all, especially relation controlling virus. Idaho dropped mask mandate fucking week announced hospitals full need send COVID patients Seattle Portland. makes blood absolutely boil. country in? Exactly exit strategy Western European countries actually good, reflected first summer months relatively low new infections people complying rules, suddenly everyone stop caring. It‚Äôs difficult situation there‚Äôs one solution apply all... New Zealand Australia amazing there‚Äôs way replicate huge free movement area like Schengen. give White House power pretending know purpose.

They spread coronavirus purpose. sabotaged response even spent money assigned congress combat C19. literally sabotaging response speak.

And like pretend ignorance clearly malice. pretend ignorance, door remains open sabotage testing, masking contact tracing. ok ignorance, malice.


I demand justice step in. people GENOCIDE. stopped today, quarter-million Americans alive next year. already late quarter-million Americans. Law enforcement, stop. Nobody else can. Right Priorities.

Walking without mask legal one case police put fine COVID-19 ended. it‚Äôs COVID-20 üôÇ think possible changed furor? think story fake media again? better start raiding secret FEMA stockpiles like Deus Ex. I'm assuming cross referenced normal population would become statistically significant looked hundred people population unbiased way Borderline? criminal, however, certain laws protect POTUS. changed? Europeans get American sudden, seasons change? I

Fall means people indoor. September want get drink friends simply go bar terrace open windows wash virus away, poor even get beer play music park. everything indoor. 

Add average population density higher Europe US. American need lockdown limited social circle long distance stranger, European walk crowed street, take bus, meet stranger parking lot lift whatever. helps virus spreading faster China role model opens fine though 1000 deaths peak lockdown tomorrow monday.

If don't, well... statistics showing 60% anyone quarantined broke quarantine. 


My first question term ""Quarantine"" mentioned was, enforce this? 


No answer, government yet answer question. Facts, Reddit? Get outta here. Look Lincoln Project. Literally republicans fighting silliness Trump Republicans pulling. want facts, obviously. Site cannot found Careful, got juice yourself: media happened:  ***No, mommy, vaccine, drugs!*** live here, ""special move"" seen every day exponential increase infections rapidly filling ICU beds. 


Next older population getting properly hit deaths rise hospital-capacity maximized beyond handle (the whirlwind). 


I home-office since march, careful, took much less vacation year went around country bit. hardly door, mostly get fresh air get necessary groceries. 


I sick wearing mask, careful, time observing restaurants full people giving shit, like normal day. 
Sick governments opening letting people that, see eyes numbers rising, faster faster. 


""Letting infection spread"" among young proven stupid approach. Spanish flu ever message, avoid second wave together. 


No, economically sound, final price keeping economy afloat, deaths elders. (who cares, contribute taxes anything useful anymore, right?). 


Now, every country europe facing lockdowns (still complete lockdowns), hell point lockdown still get bat-shit drunk restaurant bar? Hey cococucumber ‚Äî

I really hope know much miracle world. small fact exist insane! sunnier days ahead, one made winter look little gloomier, get it, you!

Hey, never tried it, call number someone listen hear out. It‚Äôs cathartic someone listen.

Sending love good thoughts way. apparently media can: lie media:  Guys probably dead beat essential worker. Deserves every drag cigarette. surprise. Someone know quarantine *3 weeks* windowless room visited Taiwan. 4 years didn't, consuming literal fake news: [found annoyed well. would liked see exactly much precaution decreased risk own, kept introducing ventilation shortened time step. telling truths nobody hear. ruins plan

/s  That‚Äôs awesome hear Oh, mean courts he's appointed justices election? like American panicking, again.

Always üî´ Mexico going pay it! keep diseased Americans out. see plot twist coming. showing banner says ""subscribe read"" &amp; subscription options. Oh no! decide companies sebd billions dollars reason! Oh, wait. reason. Grift. posted r/science top comment would pointing unless patients determined normal brains getting COVID can't possibly attribute abnormalities illness. know why, see mobile outside Reddit browser fine actually considered incredibly disrespectful flag cut make clothing accessories people know flag etiquette.

In case, lot reluctant conservatives exactly anyways. long they're wearing mask, guess fine! Money come nowhere someone paid disappear used. cycles around.

The *velocity* money important economic stability. want steady flow income populace turn around spend money things services, sellers spend turn, on. Taxes many exchanges eventually nickle-and-dime back state federal governments, ends dispersed back people various government spendings. start cycle anew.

Having tons money locked handful individuals spending much they're making bad economy. populace increasingly broke/unemployed refusing spend little case needed later bad economy. Injecting money directly base system people spend (on rent, utilities, food, services, luxeries) best way keep whole thing afloat. thinking day. wonder covid would widespread originated western country? Considering originated China, regular mask wearing suppressed spread early early days? definitely need vaccinate everyone. always ridiculous goalpost. don‚Äôt even need vaccinate herd immunity. want reduce primary cause deaths getting risk people health care workers. Europe, several rebels Italy, live. even close countries people tend abide *en masse* common rules. No. article dated 28 October. reminds Baghdad Bob ""reporting"" Iraqis fending coalition forces Gulf War II.

He find new job said done, old ones got deposed said coalition. Thanks link. kids can't transmit virus kids show symptoms /S fancy question: happens pupils school show up? Instead ""mom-coding"" convince every mom/dad leave childs home. schools' open nobody attends. ya gonna mr. mrs. ministers? still people profiting it.
Don‚Äôt forget that. It‚Äôs tax payer payed, developed private company. Anyone brainstem offended hilarious claim  TLDR:


You must:
Have 2 weeks multiple health screens
Ask everyone quarantine
Only bring closest inner circle pretend things normal brief moment time YEEEE HAW kids transmit virus need educations want learn hide it, follow mainland china's method. People keep pointing Argentina's failed lockdown example lockdowns work. problem lot countries 6 month cold season coronavirus outbreak. Australia, Chile, South Africa Argentina used soft lockdowns early them. failed bring R 1 Australia, Chile, South Africa locked harder turned infections around. Argentina locked slowly growing infection cooler months year. Even though soft lockdown slowed infections still growing. seeing end result months slowed growth. 

We seen happens countries put soft lock late hard lockdown. seen full winter countries refuse lockdown want see herd immunity looks like. want risk. There's drink socialization cannot survive without justifies risk. amazed current administration even ‚ÄòOffice Science‚Äô anti-maskers... That's normal anywhere US. Great, ty Ha. Sadly yes. Yep. people get mad pointing out. Fauci = God. :( Hmm, look pretty damn odd, direct Taiwanese CDC well. One two could anomaly, seems bit much. implication community cases detected? Genius! could this.... rest world, opinion generally replace ""North Dakotans"" ""Americans"".

I know response varies lot place place, take good hard look it, political system allowed election someone like Trump. that's Americans voting-age, regardless allegiance... way could work, maybe big expense. would need put false floor, probably 6 inches high. two inch grated strips maybe every 18 inches floor. Attach exhaust fans HEPA filters front suck air raise floor. Vent air enclosed space small fan blowing fresh air enclosed space. Put 20 (depends size space) fans throughout bar overhead, HEPA filter draw air enclosed box. fans rotate slowly lessen noise, fast enough constant downward flow HEPA filtered air washing everyone. end result clean air pulling viral crap floor drawn filters, mixed fresh air, filtered sent back floor. would feel pretty safe situation, indoor environmental expert play one TV. Consult expert see would work. floor made floor. make sense, although still lookin source exporting cases too.
Now think it, Taiwan similar stances protocals quarantine West deemed exaggerating inhuman earlier year, also far less tourist travel Taiwan year reasons, benefiting Taiwan's great stats control using scientific term ""variant"", worry much. Scientists want heard create Facebook Mommy Group, seems politicians follow guidance hysterical people groups. Sure, changes much, maybe better conservative estimate. went chipotle yesterday apparently longer serving lettuce - high temps wildfires affecting lettuce crops California (along lettuce virus apparently) need use time fix contact tracing, hire people came help HSE bolster ICU capacity. 

But know wont happen. opportuntity. squandered it. we're back square one. Fucks sake re-read 1984 year. It‚Äôs scary think post-editing won‚Äôt even necessary today. People would ignore old claim fake news. would point statistics actual data still people refused listen. one guy say many people die year heart disease Covid's big deal.

 pointed fact heart disease deaths actually gone since 1950's. mentioned preventative medicine aided well things.
 mentioned vaccines smallpox others reduced eliminated deaths things like this.They still want hear it.

 Finally invite stop taking medications, getting surgery, wearing seatbelts going doctors general because, ""everyone dies"", lot say.
They response typically.

 local business got shut health department following State mandates. One guy told many people die eating fast food maybe shut businesses well, since shutting Covid-19 offenders. 

 one thing say. People make personal lifestyle choices responsible health. choice eat fast food, smoke cigarettes, drink excessively impact another person's health, families health. dumb Covid-19 precautions impact another person's, families lives tremendously.

 want hear call folks like ""sheep"". keep listening 45 lies that's that. refuse listen reason science lack general common sense. orange bad man tells want hear. 

 Honestly feel let fellow citizens area well Country. There's people give shit area I'm afraid minority sadly enough. 

 Winters coming already hit location (record breaking snow already). going drive people even tightly packed indoors together. realize ""something wicked way comes"".
Some people ""get it"" get even still care.

Stay safe friends.  rant mode: 

i'm Belgium everyone saw coming miles away except government nothing. worse let lose rules countries imposing stricter ones. really hate government it.Our political system 3 different governing bodies work shows again. enforcing nation wide rules 2 know better big part problem. 


If family ,friends would packed left. Thank ‚Äúhelpdesk lady‚Äù :-) shut down! 4000IU per day considered safe. 1000IU considered normal people higher risk deficiency may need take more. Thank God. Earlier year actually ruined coat washing much...I worried contaminated every time left apartment.

Ugh. remember Feb ~March, could walk restaurants XinYi Friday work would half capacity. Nowadays waiting half hour make reservation dinner. studies needed but... anecdote inbound: late getting flu shot last year. normally get October/November get early February year, right got COVID. got dreaded COVID-toes issues (that still linger), never got fever, lose sense smell, slight cough. partner, got flu shot time &amp; showed COVID symptoms couple weeks me, slight fever, cough, tired time, made relatively well. Granted, lung scarring many getting currently treated months feeling right. 

So, flu shot help? Shrug. issue. lockdown first time exactly? 

And now, preventative measures taken first time. 

What happens 3rd one inevitably comes around 4th, 5th etc?

Everyone's talking kids school Fuck that, Im 30s want damn life back. dont care makes selfish immature. 

After recession 2008 this, Im tired paying things nothing with. 1st lockdown? Fine, get shit together, prepare health servce, stay away people, wear mask. 

2nd lockdown? Fuck right off, responsibility fix something leaders didnt? contact tracing completely failed, ICU capacity wasnt bolstered even though trained experineced diaspora coming home world help tell us 6 weeks??? Well, told us 2 last time, forgive Im trusting. cyclical nature amount cases really interesting. Poor Space Force, young. would agree, comparing EU USA. However compared Asian countries particular South America argument breakdown 

Mauritius 10.9% population 65, compared Brazil's 8.6%. South Africa 5.3% compared India's 6%. South American countries 3.5% 6% African 2.5% 5% 

Don't get wrong African continent one youngest populations world. difference ~1% age demographics explain ~9,5 Million cases South America; ~1,7 Africa.

Worse still Middle East lowest rates people 65. Qatar 1.3% 131,000 cases, UAE 1.1% 129,000. However noted nations also low death rates. Kuwait 2.3% 65 123,000 cases 763 deaths. Oman 2.4% 114,000 cases 1,208 deaths 

However health care difference wealthy Middle Eastern nations poor African Nations. Saudi Arabia 5,348 deaths 3.3% population 65. Ghana 3.4% population 65 316 deaths 

Don't  man takes pride others‚Äô accomplishments little own. That‚Äôs situation weeks though. Even McConnell said stimulus talks wouldn‚Äôt happen election. Markets react much quicker commentary news. Always don‚Äôt want family kids damaged virus. necessary beat virus.

Pretending doesn‚Äôt exist playing victim gets best message sending kids. curious know: affected Taiwanese people anti-maskers? much reduce social gatherings early stages epidemic, like going restaurants inviting people home on? new president, old gang claim new let virus back. media told us Europe everything right America wrong.

Now Europe horrible surge cases, US.

Screw media.

Europe must lock now, it. I'm half-Taiwanese. following relative approaches quite closely. :) \*Ahem\* 
Yeah.  


No Shit. Late party completely right. New York piece three true death toll keep updating it. shows that, unlike many countries, Belgium reporting true figures.

German RKI (our CDC, basically) thinks wake well 2022 vaccinated everyone. 

well started mandate mask-wearing strick travel bans late FREAKING January built special capsule hospitals deal contain infected, again, FREAKING late January. even cases imported China, places still mandate wear masks (if deemed trouble-maker sociaty ""lose faces"", Asians LOVE faces), Donald nations people worry getting nails hair done hoax-believers anti-mask movement day

China almost back normal stance despite recent import cases rapid mass testing XJ Qingdao, unless people claiming stats inaccurate China visited recently, opinion persuasive

discrediting others places dealing well covid19, attempt admit effetive things evidences, gonna help situation logically, breed distrust resentments third Americans brain abnormalities lol. Look people wearing mask. argued mask? ut alking Belgium wear masks stores public building 4 months now? yet still hit hardest 2020 getting crappier crappier. apologies.

I guess Europe worse US. Thats... exact opposite works...

Shut schools.

What thinking? water wet though? water make things wet? trust anything tbh. even know I'll put short term work yet. Germany quick re-open though Done beyond excellent. nicely demonstrates telling people case, received raised eyebrows doubt. mostly common sense would tell expect. useful seeing absolutely must go situation without N95/FFP2.

Conservatives failing Canada. well there's differences mask-mandates, people actually follow them

a state mask mandate rules ZERO people go becasuse all-hoax-believers, can't provent anything, therefore ""Mandate mask working becasue people still caught it, must hoax"" conspiracy school city workplace. travel train live living unit, sharing single room sleeping space multiple students across state. share tight classroom even people. safe allowed eat outside regardless weather, cold 20 minutes raining. week go home happily spread everything families coworkers.

I know complicated lot factor need taken account, feed *masks useless, lockdown, let's reach herd immunity asap* people used to.

Suddnely GOP screaming Covid back wiht avengance teh Dems Sounds like half-baked whataboutism me, Trump's actions indefensible Yeah, I've friends online games Europe go racist nature US...right going someone middle eastern accent calling rag heads making jokes blowing up.  think two elements. 

1. Economics. kids school introduces big headache working parents (which families). Even people able work home often find hard combine kids home. School also acts form welfare since poor kids get free meals school. 

2. think also one fundamental beliefs European public policy mandatory school attendance *hugely* important. UK pandemic frankly weird obsession punishing parents permit even short term truancy. years ago colleague mine took daughter school days travel internationally (to attend grandparents funeral) threatened fine also expel daughter (the irony lost her). believe school hugely important missing couple days irrevocably damage child forever thought closing schools weeks/months probably terrifying. probably tell, I'm sympathetic position easy imagine home schooling hugely increase educational inequalities (at least without intervention).

So think many European countries, schools one things want close last rather first. It‚Äôs hard lockdown did. city curfew peak Sorry, people actually still believe fairy tales soon myths past dumb. power positive thinking

But comparing easily quarantainable islands anything mainland 1sovereign state futile



Hell, comparisons futile.
We know needs done. great, thank you. I‚Äôll share it. 

My question keep hearing 1 partner it, doesn‚Äôt live together. mind would throw numbers people catch virus infected? 

Is even thing countries? I‚Äôm England find odd know many people aren‚Äôt infecting partners members family. anyone know why? pretty much everything said true; actually Taiwan actually much testing considering population size. test alot asymptomatic people self quarantine instead. However preventive measures implemented early effectively(as early Late December Dr. Li blew whistle) death rates lie. might able cite low infection rates fewer testing high death toll much harder hide. 

So would say infection rates might higher officially published many people mightve contact infected people ended infected would self-quarantine never ended getting tested spread people. That's moment mommy realizes 20 anymore, chunky self made back hurt. I‚Äôm estimating 2023. Mutations, 50% vaccine take rate exhausted population start taking risks.

# Scientists warn new coronavirus variant spreading across Europe

Genetic mutation originated Spain transmitted returning holidaymakers, researchers find 


A coronavirus variant originated Spanish farm workers spread rapidly much Europe since summer, accounts majority new Covid-19 cases several countries ‚Äî 80 per cent UK.

An international team scientists been[ tracking virus genetic described extraordinary spread variant, called 20A.EU1, [research published Thursday.

Their work suggests people returning holiday Spain played key role transmitting virus across Europe, raising questions whether second wave sweeping continent could reduced improved screening airports transport hubs.

Because variant genetic signature, traced back place originated.

‚ÄúFrom spread 20A.EU1, seems clear \[virus prevention\] measures place often sufficient stop onward transmission introduced variants summer,‚Äù said Emma Hodcroft, evolutionary geneticist University Basel lead author study yet published peer-reviewed journal.

The scientific teams Switzerland Spain rushing examine behaviour variant establish whether may deadly infectious strains.

Dr Hodcroft stressed ‚Äúno evidence variant‚Äôs \[rapid\] spread due mutation increases transmission impacts clinical outcome‚Äù.

But emphasised 20A.EU1 unlike version Sars-Cov-2 ‚Äî virus causes Covid-19 ‚Äî previously come across. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen variant sort dynamic long I‚Äôve looking genomic sequences coronavirus Europe,‚Äù said.

In particular, teams working virology laboratories establish whether 20A.EU1 carries particular mutation, ‚Äúspike protein‚Äù virus uses enter human cells, might alter behaviour.

All viruses develop mutations ‚Äî changes individual letters genetic code ‚Äî group together new variants strains. Another mutation Sars-Cov-2, called D614G, identified believed make virus infectious.

Joseph Fauver, genetic epidemiologist Yale University involved research published Thursday, said: ‚ÄúWe need studies like find mutations risen high frequency population, reverse-engineer see whether make virus transmissible.‚Äù

The new variant, six distinctive genetic mutations, emerged among agricultural workers north-east Spain June moved quickly local population, according study.

Tanja Stadler, professor computational evolution ETH Zurich part project, said analysis virus samples taken across Europe recent weeks showed derived variant.

‚ÄúWe see virus introduced multiple times several countries many introductions gone spread population,‚Äù Prof Stadler said.

I√±aki Comas, head SeqCovid-Spain consortium studying virus co-author study, added: ‚ÄúOne variant, aided initial super-spreading event, quickly become prevalent.‚Äù

The researchers concluded ‚Äúrisky behaviour‚Äù holidaymakers Spain ‚Äî ignoring social distancing guidelines ‚Äî ‚Äúcontinue engage behaviour home‚Äù helped spread new variant.

The research showed new variant accounted eight 10 cases UK, 80 per cent cases Spain, 60 per cent Ireland 40 per cent Switzerland France.

Stringent lockdowns early part year helped bring initial Covid-19 surge control, new cases substantially reduced summer.

But virus spread rapidly back Europe recent weeks resurgence forced national leaders introduce painful new restrictions social activities. said conservative provincial parties. Canada. Ontario &amp; Quebec. about? blame government. People gave shit mesures. Now, harvesting brats. Tell Hawaii. United Kingdom. Fool aid hospital going credential surgeon serve hospitalist.

And yeah maybe hospitals don‚Äôt care doc sick, doc cares. doctor nurse dealing past 9 months knows happens much CoVID19.

Asymptomatics, see staying on, even mild case brutal. nahhh Fun fact: people florida care covid react particular way ""true numbers"". actually quite alarming. work 63 year old guy says need stop taking right away kills old people, everyone get done it. Like bro, old people. 100% kids die going school. health number much much lower.

This opinion exactly Germany would need ensure schools stay open people continued work. 

FYI folks even know long term affects children? going long enough.

For record trust doctors hard sciences like virology medicine. put psychology tier. feel you, I‚Äôm ‚Äúessential‚Äù working 6 day weeks last 5 months wife works mental health. works home phone stopped ringing months. lie constantly everything going alright; hand developed disdain humanity sheer stupidity human race wear comfortably old cardigan. work someone consistently says, ‚ÄúWell 99% survival rate.‚Äù reply time, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs still population city Chicago dead.‚Äù hates that. one day week, order case two canned good Costco, drop car, drop local food bank, go home make cocktails sun goes down.

OP said he‚Äôs southeast part Nebraska, he‚Äôs Lincoln/Omaha. country like that. cities full mask-wearers awesome internet drive 50 miles metro area get poor internet masks. site:

""The model limited accuracy¬†because relies numbers still uncertain""

The golden rule models 'Trash in, trash out'. model adapted aerosol pollutant model authors (Environmental academics experience modelling infectious diseases) admit (although couched scientific language) made model parameters pertaining virus.

The fact published peer reviewed journal despite around since June speaks volumes. live yet idea disadvantages makes difficult us contain coronavirus. mean, already wrong Philippines made islands inherent advantage natural barrier pandemic.

It's simply atleast realistically feasible.

It's hell transport hundreds thousands OFWs/migrant workers locally stranded individuals back homes Philippines made islands. actually could easier transport people land vehicle instead sea.

If think that's problem, wait til find hard medical supplies stuff like materials needed built quarantine centers moved provinces islands provinces equal infrastructures deal pandemic readily countries.

Oh another. Philippines archipelago, main island capital region located heavily populated especially capital region including regions surrounding it.

So island advantage already window capital region alone actually small compared metropolitan areas like Tokyo, Delhi Jakarta home one fourth whole population.

One fourth whole population! big portion even living capital commuting regions avoid rent prices forced live unpleasant places like slums.

Add migrant workers world returning country work stopped abroad.

Add cultural social manners like pagmamano pagbebeso (hand forehead honour gestures elders friendly kisses) defied social distancing even pandemic started.

Add lack existing infrastuctures system act isolation centers infected suspected cases.

Add lack health care workers working overseas instead tending sick fellow citizens.

Add everything actually well compared countries actual resources use. good know since im risk group might plan move high risk city Gotta go morning. ad buy AC unit home business? total amount samples date less 800,000. going test 5.4 million people short amount time?  Yes antigen tests 4‚Ç¨/piece, pcr cost much average 50‚Ç¨+

But final step safe economy colaps, better pay tests check back see ages month two. Mass testing (first TTI) useless without tracing ans isolating (second TTI). Unfortunately, tracing isolating near impossible countries citizens comply whatever reasons. noodles means is, future everyone gets covid 15 minutes Yes, work actual journalists, idiots places US days. surprised NYTimes done send health journalist link. Cutting emissions help anymore feedback loops. would need terraforming technology recreate glaciers. highly doubt mankind ever reach point. watched, somebody sneak people visit them. happened 100% time voluntary isolation. virus imported tunneled separate public. 

There's 600 medical students US came practiced first past 2 months. new cases cases already isolated contact tracing simple due app measures place. didn‚Äôt read died. Where‚Äôs that? I'm different guy, washrooms big deal working private residences.

Ir's pandemi starts bat China.

Funny movie wait til USA 2 million dead closing schools.

Also like Outbreak 1995. experiencing China's response believe numbers. ignorant close-minded situation don't.

I think look word. I'm sure mean sentence. People want herd immunity they've convinced easy way out: ""do nothing"" problem disappear. 

It's way people feel environment, systemic racism growing wealth inequality, nothing problems magically go away. implications much world handle, tbh. we're going completely ignore it. Funny reading izzo's comment...

I live Trump Land rest contractors ( agricultural town outside DC ) work Bidenville ( DC Metro elites afford services ).

As someone always finds dead-ass middle political divides, would, however, challenge take word US government-backed institutions ""the real science"" grain salt.

I want become political tirade. seems much""reputable"" information prestigious institutions world governments speak contrary government-backed response been. Obviously, White House, moment, going safely catalyze right making verbose statement beast defeated. Conversely, Left going reel utter contempt ""the science"" speaks otherwise - think constituents loyal either side spectrum peered vast array contradicting studies, surveys, statistics - gleaned reputable capable scientific minds.

Although entirely ""right-wing"" myself, sake mature considerate debate pursuit level-headed discussion amongst civilized folk outside medical field - would beg taking ""hard lockdown approach"" consider following...

I sure plenty smart people CDC. also sure plenty smart people Cambridge, Harvard, Oxford.

We might initially respond people agree us gut reaction based somewhere emotions feelings. apologize bold propose - find reason shocked kids walking school mask reason people scoff wearing one.

I look forward comments might usher forth own. Methinks also, prepare inevitable flagging, ban thread, harassment due posting anti-mask sentiment.

I await both, baited breath. Thx am! case mainland Taiwan weeks ago, turned sampling mixup.  deleted social media except Reddit well month watching it. felt better decision watching documentary.

YOU‚ÄôRE IMMUNE STILL SPREAD THAT‚ÄôS WANT BELIEVE. Headline says ""UK"", figures article actually England. Well yeah, job? /s guess positives expected isolate voluntarily, do, infect others continued.

It's grear idea sweep like China does, works real isolation, i.e. locking people somewhere make sure isolated. explanation record # cases? Makes sense. 3 ruling parties. 6 governements 6 parliaments 11.5 million citizens.

Each consists coalitions parties necessarily same. point, federal coalition different Flemish coalition. 

One bigger parties right governing coalition Flemish region, opposition federal level. 

Yes. Belgian politics like watching game 4D chess. macht frei......

For neither read German, partake sack punching: 
""***Arbeit macht frei*** German phrase meaning ""Work sets free."" slogan known appearing entrance Auschwitz Nazi concentration camps."" Email Depends care standards good job is.

If care people's suffering, Florida fine. want compare results wealthy first world nations, compared absolutely nothing (like Trump does), Florida fine.

Reality is, Florida big head start (to get prepared) something. Cases really rise June. instead Desantis went Trump playbook decided ignore downplay best course action. failure end sight. suffering continue. Florida top ten (of States, one worst countries) cases deaths per 1M population. giving time difference North East, arguably worse. I‚Äôm talking plug ready ones got free tv cable it. subscribed service basic package. move new house that‚Äôs ‚Äúcable ready,‚Äù don‚Äôt sign cable company, plug tv attach cable wire boom, 3, 6, 10, 17 couple channels.

Personally I'm fine it. virus hard tell develop symptoms, government quarantining positives whether ill, incubation, eventually asymptomatic. Transitions incubation ill reported daily. turned corner

As circles drain.  ""oh happen us, we're healthy, see?"" ughh stupid, hurts. nothing lose. already admitted they‚Äôre longer trying fight virus. Trump loses election, walk away it‚Äôs ‚Äúno longer problem‚Äù. succeeds stealing election, claim it‚Äôs fault Dems Obama continue nothing.  Yeah pandemic around months. nonsense 99.7% survival rate people 70 people 70 really give shit What? never change TV service. 50 year old antennas still receive air stations. Explovid 2024? Also: flu shot = less likely get flu = won‚Äôt coughing/sneezing much, vectors transmission knowledge viral load hypothesis simply aerosol transmission carries less infection droplet transmission. is, that's valid point then.

""Thats fair! cant ask that""  oh wait,,, different interview ""normal"" could much easier, people would wear masks keep distance. normal right shit show, virus go rampant, many people DGAF. No, mandatory enough workers. try harder comparisons.

Ethiopia's population density Philippines largest city, Addis Ababa compared capital region.

Ethiopia's rural population almost 80%. urban population almost 50%. incomparable.

The testing rate even like redditor commented post. Germany reach two days sure, maybe even tomorrow. fact useful without providing context lot testing moment. Unlikely infection fatality rate (what really matters) much different before. conclusively prove caught Covid plane?  virus can‚Äôt ‚Äústop living lives‚Äù

Well, apparently already nearly 1.2 million people. weeks behind Europe. Depends country, France curfews? ‚ÄúForgive Lord. know do.‚Äù 60% enough trick, even getting many people insanely massive undertaking. going long time everybody needs gets it. sure Jesus wants that, even 10 foot pole. least 2 in-hospital outbreaks company know of, plus another staff member *knowingly* came work positive covid. article sourcing London Imperial College's REACT study uses finger-prick antibodies test, yet found accurate.

A finger-prick test detects antibodies blood determine Covid. antibodies mean infected.

It would seem Imperial College testing actual finger-prick method itself, actually *using* test. article may drawn wrong conclusion.

Our tabloids notorious sourcing scientific 'studies' fact-checking Lo Standard known 'sensationalising' news.

I would say needs looking into. eyes though. 2020. 2021 spoilers Churches Germany open too. I'm taking ""[excess approach. goes like this:

The USA knows many people born die year, high degree accuracy, enough data make strong statistical predictions. year, FAR, ~~250,000~~ 300,000 EXCESS DEATHS REASON occurred. Lightning, chocking chicken wings, dirt bikes, whatever.

So, something up! Maybe know exactly is, that's fine. good theories, one theory infectious disease that's definitely around.

These numbers CDC, verifiable by, example, calling every crematorium mortuary asking questions. Also, CDC motivation make up.  Follow money. rely advertisements, therefore visitors, therefore controversy. Fauci taking account vaccine distribution difficult take time.

Ok fine, places run responsible people lockdown measures. things happened Washington state also. think arguing semantics lockdown real teeth backed national safety measures. People never stopped like needed to. People still deny virus. People still empathy regard human life. need real lockdown... never happen because, 'merica. things journalists questions (I'm pasting translated snippets SVT newsfeed):

Now question public transport Stockholm. change restrictions there, important travel public transport to.

*- travel must use public transport get jobs, says Maria Rotz√©n √ñstlund, acting infection control doctor, Stockholm region.*

There another question public transport equally different assessments made different regions. Stockholm, asked wait next metro full, cases possible. time, public transport important Stockholm region many cannot avoid much smaller spread infection last spring, says Anders Tegnell.  assessment probably spread infection 10 percent last spring.  sum up, spread infection lower spring, restrictions introduced end levels then, healthcare system difficulty coping pressure.  Tegnell rule regions may become relevant local restrictions future.

Now question IVA today.

*- enter healthcare general slightly younger last spring, says Thomas Lind√©n.*

Now question whether call shops, restaurants gyms close down.

*- gone far say close, adapt business congestion creates infection situation, says Tegnell.*

Now question Anders Tegnell French President Macron's statement waves deadly.

*- learned must beware categorical. completely different tools dealing pandemic spring. every reason believe relive number deaths saw last spring.*

A question national restrictions imposed.

*- Even though large part population, regions actually need this. Sometimes need change communication methods keep focus issue, says Tegnell.*

The EU wants rapid tests throughout Europe. Britt √Ökerlind, infection control doctor, √ñsterg√∂tland region, believes exist today sufficiently high quality.

*- must hope future, says.*

Anders Tegnell asked second wave.

*- think important, see large spread infection Sweden, whether call second wave uninteresting.*

Anders Tegnell also gets question FHM rethinking regarding lifted restrictions 70 plus.

*- course follow question closely, see increase age groups almost all. long is, stay. case belong risk group, must make risk assessment.*

Now question Sweden's strategy worked Sweden follows pattern European countries increased spread infection autumn.

*- agree level, far behind Czech Republic example. slow spread infection compared many countries Europe, says Tegnell.*

*- must minimize social contacts, especially new social contacts. Avoid meeting people usually meet, says Anders Tegnell.*

\- completely different situation last spring. completely different situation. Healthcare became strained quickly. pressure healthcare slowly increasing seeing small spread infection nursing homes, says Tegnell.

Anders Tegnell also thinks advice followed well Swedes, think people become tired following them. return regular trading conditions priced many industries. read article. Got it.

When say vaccine ready, implying ready widespread distribution. ready EUA supplied deemed part population would benefit initial roll out. guess missed good news yesterday Renegeron well, despite 900+ point stock market drop. argument moot. apparently opposite am. called county health department they're testing symptoms. referred county hospital. called they're requiring referral. called doctor referral transferred network's Covid hotline. Covid hotline says they'll give referral symptoms and/or 5 days since exposure tested positive. also said confirm anything costs. called insurance company's Covid number confirmed 5-day waiting period also told plan covers one test per year recommended testing early since could get false negative follow test covered.

I've phone past two hours trying make sense this. I'm going assumption everyone household positive asymptomatic. super frustrating. too! Everything don‚Äôt like fake news? I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs is. peak daily deaths America April effectively flattened curve. many states already open process opening up. üëç Almost every county trending upward case counts. DeWine's map going whole lot red splashes purple soon. Absolutely fucking vile. highly recommend buying envo mask. Im ED nurse bought one fear hospital shortages n95s. issue valve, need cover cloth surgical mask. USA here, we're #1!  
\#1 cases 
\#1 deaths  
It pains see stupid people country :(  
Some states right thing, ""conservative"" politicians everything power turn around head wrong direction. seems attitude ""it's problem, unless affects me"". data CDC's website. is, basically thinly veiled rant whine political enemies. school districts funding worst (like District pf Columbia) least (Utah) best. Yeah, lot population thinks due original order struck down, new one.

I got huge argument Facebook someone.

Mask adherence is... great many places.

Ann Arbor pretty good, Royal Oak, Birmingham, Canton, Plymouth seem less willing wear masks. compromise kill 150k? Unfortunately one part actually evil time. They're willingly sacrificing people's lives livelihoods politics.

Please tell Democrats less blame passing type pandemic assistance. understand republican plan viewed little late, people need SOMETHING come door instead passing **ANY** bi-partisan bill, dem's decided best time stand ground hold American people hostage.

I'm excusing republican's terrible behavior, one party's extreme failures mean excuse sins another? Penis deeply concerned 3 months. contradict anecdotal evidence mine. seen single person without mask store ever since obligation No, I'm talking Limburg, detailed, I'm talking Houthalen-Helchteren. I've never said powerplant Limburg, said see lot pharmacies Vlaams-Brabant en Limburg giving Iodine pills free, especially elderly. I'm also talking international politicians urging Belgian government shut down. dont know much Antwerpen, city beautiful architecture, visit often know region. know Limburg, Brussels Vlaams-Brabant, see 2/3 regions giving Iodine pills. may ""based lies"" highly doubt, considering I'm assuming EU least tiny bit info, especially Eastern neighbour Germany sued Belgium powerplant. okay, go thing saying ""based lies"" ""all lies"" go ""mainstream international media bad"" mentality, would give free knew ""hoax""? guess, neighbouring countries complaining people pharmacies Belgium giving Iodine pills, doesnt seem much hoax me. Please send couple articles explaining hoax, I'd love read it. Unironically.  Yeah, Donnie's basement pizza parlour mixing rallies tweeting. patient.. warm planet fast ... lunatic ? scared defy science ? saying people selfish asshole abuse outdoor activity hang large group drink, probably mask, time.

Why always attacking ? going win Ad Personam. disagree me, welcome so, need explain prove people responsible hang large group ""outdoor activities"" excuse cases began skyrocketing again, yes, people figured restrictions would come back.

But cases low summer, reddit (and Europeans), believed conquered COVID.  believe things would worse October April. thought past it. lived like over.

""Natural herd immunity"" code ""we surrender"", fleeced taxpayer money, made sure profit telling us get fucked. think America really good

Unfortunately, cases skyrocketing hospitalizations going up, deaths likely keep rising too. Deaths gone around 100/day (to bit 800/day) past 2 weeks, even really include skyrocket cases past 2 weeks yet lag. We'll probably see average 1000 deaths/day week two, climbing higher things get worse late Nov, Dec, Jan. know America reach 2000/day, could seeing around 1500/day several weeks.

I'm really worried Thanksgiving, Christmas/New Year's, regular flu season going bring. Europe indicator, going get really bad. Well, really worse--it's already really bad. hospital basically lowest paid support find. Ive nurse 10 years. wanna say computers switched windows xp year two ago...

People seem taken actions local officials (who later fired actions) trying keep knowledge virus wraps, early confusion virus, works evidence massive nation-wide cover virus.

Look, I'm criticizing China terrible shit, like Xinjiang, Hong Kong, CCP's institutional culture hurt early (week two) initial efforts stemming virus.

But we're nearly November 2020. virus pretty much stamped China since late spring.

Rather coming conspiracy theories absolutely *must* lying, course *China* control virus likes US (and lesser extent Europe) couldn't, look actual data. actual data countries near China too.

What working check virus - longer ignore that, longer try dismiss impossible, longer struggle hurt ourselves.

The western world egg face right now, looking east Asia right controlling virus. Belgium 20k+ positive confirmations today, UK population around 6 times belgiam population.

Yeah, still said he's right.

I give people. Except ruin economy way half baked. 
The countries still economic growth ones locked early hard good contact tracing stop spread entirely. tbh even leave office (not likely) wont face charges anything pay way likely case reduction severity infection reduce chances spreading virus? Sounds similar like Germany next monday amateur sport completely banned. jogging alone someone allowed Bundesliga allowed play soccer without audience. Yes, many kids. Children need socialization peers age group.

In thread others like it, read parents young children seeing declines social emotional maturity. meeting developmental milestones early age compounding effects road.

For older kids, rates depression anxiety already higher past generations. Many psychologists believe even COVID, declines in-person interaction increasing screen time partly responsible that. crisis multiplying tenfold. time Christmas comes see first batches vaccines rolled continuing Jan Feb Mar. think time winter ends slightly better position, spring things bit normal receive vaccinations. meant anything results 3 weeks? (UK)

The NHS 119 service told capacity enough tests, I'm probably fine results back, obviously really shitty advice. offered take details ""investigate"", even found results late anyway, suggested go life never got ill.... 


Is really shit goes? I'm confused Thanks spreading blatant misinformation relief see number active cases come down, 2 weeks CMCO!! Politico published copy press release it‚Äôs WH website. report there. Supposedly WH clarified poor wording haven‚Äôt seen source either. Quite possibly, gone, destroy economic case lot alternatives. vaccine swing miss, products come fore. 3 gel capsules 5-7 months according 3 people know personally one friend friend got twice.  impossible? Flu never took southern hemisphere's winter, world travelling then. northern hemisphere winter even really begun. doesn‚Äôt really say article restrictions put place. anyone know? Even shortages, could mean couple less trips grocery store peak covid hits neighborhood.

lol I'll going everyday anyways. RIP. hope dropped this:

/s scans patients serious complications needed hospitalization. I'm assuming so. headlines clickbait, 70% dont serious problems doubtful long term issues think covid part ground spring anyways @ second point death rate improved dramatically since beginning ordeal, it‚Äôs tough really gauge many cases unreported beginning. Serology studies seem indicate catching one 10 cases beginning. point probably catching least double (maybe). look graph looks like 95% better outcome. I‚Äôm thinking it‚Äôs closer 70% based I‚Äôve read recently. Still phenomenal, delayed use ventilators probably represents 25% (or #). 

One thing wrestle much better gotten keeping people alive since August?  summer brutal. point without breakthrough therapy widespread practical ability applied everyday patient properly timed window may begin see diminishing returns.  point it‚Äôs possible hit wall reality reality. hope isn‚Äôt case though. find drug reduces mortality? thought would help keep deaths lower even many infections. Lol typical. Ffs jealous. know get back normal (USA).

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately, parents believe masks work go herd immunity. Trump promised military ready go. Western Australia 201 days community cases.  That's said. No. 1. Trust ‚Äî people can't wear masks (when obvious they're so), would tell truth at-home test?
2. At-home tests yet widely available known reliability cost. Covid sticks around spring (either vaccination less effective simply delayed), expect prioritised along prophylactics actual treatments. don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really weird. Despite people say, isn‚Äôt super plague that‚Äôs going get moment step within 6 feet active case. It‚Äôs perfectly possible, likely even, able around infected person catch them, even precautions taken.

 It‚Äôs numbers game. might spend whole evening around positive case catch it, might get unlucky spend 15 seconds elevator someone catch it. Whether odds infection 1%, 10%, 90%, knows. outcomes still possible still happen. hell full measure?? need written permission leave home France. psychotic? hockey. nice visuals backed European Center Disease Control Prevention‚Äôs (ECDC) observation single case fomite-caused Covid-19 observed

Patient 3 looks much like handshake one looking fomites Chinese. CDC track well-ventilated room infected person left? sure talk much. Anyone study this, apart Chinese train study? found 50% reduction spread COVID-19 counties mask mandate compared without,‚Äù Donna K. Ginther, director Institute Policy Social Research KU, said video presenting study‚Äôs willing wear masks also likely properly wash hands. likely pay attention symptoms isolate needed.&lt;

Sounds like wearing masks encourages folks take multifaceted approach mitigating coronavirus risk. Thanks pointing out!

Wear mask. I‚Äôm green person upper left picture. Still sure one get sick. Donating blood tomorrow (Red Cross tests antibodies) see somehow false negative test &amp; asymptomatic. Honestly know multiple people Florida New York got second time. means immunity 5-7 months. vaccine? pretty sure going live like flu. Guess China way, mix 50-100 people's sample test positive. follow positive cases one types care consequences something unless personally effects you? they. per day ?1000 deaths ? Uruguay rural. medical care works. ambulance still take hospital even fault got car accident. People smoked years develop cancer heart disease still get treatment.

I know sounds like nice idea, medical treatment justified worthy receive it. I'm looking India charts, 7 day moving average: deaths peaked practically time new cases? possible? Maybe it‚Äôs midwestern US bias, seems like everyone know close relative healthcare. people read headline feel better; read think ‚Äúall friends family danger‚Äù. classroom example, wouldn‚Äôt amount aerosols keep increasing infected teacher day went on? kids first period fine kids 8th period. Seems room would saturated droplets. president starting religion. silly think is, would much rather people turn Jesus T, Q, white nationalism. mfers *need* Jesus. fluke like flu? I'm sorry one look shitty hazmat suit generic fake m40 airsoft mask turned quick New Zealand says hi usual paying mistakes made government.

They done good contact tracing first lock closed borders countries still local spreading (most countries) quarantine everyone suspected. failed that. live consequences... Got flu vaccine 2 weeks ago super market gave $10 gift card. thought bonus, even better. year‚Äôs Sturgis event superspreader event? Romania Spain long buildup since August. really bad. could shoot guy 5th avenue, remember? Considering circumstances, would need lot proof anyone claimed come lab (although personally think likely accident).

The default lab working least 5 coronaviruses (that publicly acknowledge). conspiracy (least likely origin) random unknown animal got bat 600 miles away. Reading comprehension strong suit, eh? state US control response. Republican can't answer personally Republican friends like Trump still vote Republican - ideological poison. 

They want conservative supreme Court justices Christian figureheads charge force rest us swallow religious garbage. true. high numbers us I'm certainly thankful thousands like states. jinx it...

But yeah, managed suffocate quite many growth centers, least far. Ah yes, pro-life party action. Oh okay, sorry harsh quite affected it. Italy go 200m away house unless groceries. parents working covid-ward alone day absolutely see anyone likely it. Tbf drinking sessions parents watching Netflix shift one fondest memories. also remember talking binging day long stress. neighbours' autistic kid screaming wanted go park. yeah, really weird time us guess. technically state country Western Australia 201 days local cases.I think Australian Capital Territory 202 days Northern Territory never local community cases. South Australia 197 days local cases. ""Since brain cannot regenerate, Haneef cautioned damage organ likely permanent.""

But fluuuuu, maaaaaaaan! /s really happening anywhere besides select isolated countries took extreme measures. Cases rising across Europe, originally touted ""taking virus seriously."" also shine flashlight ass activate kool-aid. know many aerosol particles one must inhale become infected.  theories say getting low dose leads mild case. Fauci saying vaccine available general public April I‚Äôm going follow timeline. Thousands doses currently made speak. take time distribute really don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll take super long. virus huge issue that‚Äôs deteriorating countries day. Every country whatever make distribution process smoothly possible get back normal benefit, mainly economic standpoint. Victoria pulled off, bringing peak 700 new cases day zero.

It took 4 months particularly stringent lockdown pull off, still Covid-19 lurking around edge Australia shown handful new cases NSW Victoria days even surveillance public health departments still letting all. Nah, it‚Äôs hoax. /s can‚Äôt stand comparisons obviously objectively worse situations. 

Just Anne Frank obviously much shittier situation doesn‚Äôt mean lockdown isn‚Äôt significantly affecting people‚Äôs lives. media keeps pushing ""man made"" conspiracy theory whilst ignoring much reasonable one accidentally leaked lab. new tactic use censor, adopt ridiculous conspiracy theories &amp; give front page news &amp; act like that's everyone talking about. gonna say, fuck em. I'll fine mine. Apparently still sense humor high school boy wear mask public almost pointless go parties people masks. guess people social lives happy illegal. nevermind consequences

SOURCE FURIN SITE SARS-CoV-2 COPY CHOICE ERROR MIXED INFECTION BATS

I found probable source putative insert adds RRAR furin site SARS-CoV-2.

Ten 12 nucleotides RRAR insert identical sequence spike protein gene Bat Coronavirus HKU9 isolated Rousettus fruit bat Guangdong province 2011.

In HKU9 code TSAG loop region known Gao terminology SD3. first CT putative insert still orphan, relevant possible source rest, albeit frame.

The ‚ÄúInsert‚Äù CT CCTCGGCGGG, last ten identical sequence HKU9.

The sequence context similarities, i.e ‚Äúcagac‚Äù upstream ‚Äúc‚Äù downstream ‚Äúinsert‚Äù aligned here:

HKU9 gcatttgta **caga------cctcggcgggc** ctctgt

CoV-2 tatcagact **cagac** ttgct **cctcggcgggc** acgtagt

Total 14 19 identical nucleotides two runs one gap. That‚Äôs lock.

Copy choice errors mixed infections exact context, since recombination, RNA polymerase hopping one template strand another. case two templates code gene, regions thousand nucleotides one another, genome 30,000 nucleotides. could easily evolution site since mixed infection, period years.

This cannot coincidence.

The natural range host Bat RaTG13, closely related SARS-CoV-2, microbat Rhinolopus affinis, overlaps Rousettus fruit Macrobat Yunnan province. latter used bush meat. Also, Microbats Macrobats known co-habit caves. alternate source virus human infection could mixed bat guano cave mixed population.

So definitive source pandemic mixed infection viruses similar SARS-CoV-2 Bat HKU9 ‚Äì copy choice error resulting insert SARS-CoV-2. Could occur bats, intermediate animal human.

Human incubation SARS-CoV-2 could hop max speed train, direct line Kunming Yunnan Province disembark Wuhan train station 6.5-8 hours later, sometime last fall. line began service 2017.

Infected Yunnan, spread there, goes Wuhan, he/she either falls ill spreads asymptomatically another person, initiating pandemic there. initial outbreak occurs short distance Wuhan train station good reason ‚Äì arrived.

This accidental mixed infection wild, infection human form bush meat bat guano, carries high speed train Wuhan ‚Äì likely series events leading pandemic.

The laboratory required natural laboratory bat cave multiple species bats bat coronaviruses.

Found it.

I'm saying good proportion people getting tests symptoms light ones. lab near place, every day queue outside +50 people wait outside hour, something would flu symptoms. ""Oh may sneeze-to death neighbor, government mean me"" ‚Ä¶

Greetings Germany, centuries history books 'ain't seen nothing yet. never ever experienced drastic government action all.

 contain Corona, history books gain another chapter, time written blood **you** intend spill! I'm Northern England, true 90% beds taken covid patients point we're staring barrel bit broadly accurate.

And, unimaginable amount dickheads care, probably need locking protection large can't look ourselves: even 2 metres concept leaves people scratching heads.

Not large minority people care, also untold numbers cranks, narcissists, sociopaths out-and-out lunatics regurgitate verbatim anything read face book twitter without even cursory evaluation.

So, we're fucked. And, say lightly. Lives, businesses, jobs, community organisations, personal well-being on. going affect us one way another, worse others. Opposite 9/11. ""Always forget"" interstate commerce national disease. feel way brown v board education too? New York less half number cases per day Florida ... we're quite bit testing means Florida's numbers even higher what's reported. Reduce hospitalization duration among milder cases, US would certainly worth thousands dollars. That's pricing works US, garbage.

Edit: want add onto this. Using hypothetical numbers.

Let's say staying hospitalized costs $1000 day, drug eliminate 1 day usual hospitalization time. think drug company charge hospital less $1000? No. could charge hospital $1500. hospital turns around charges patient $1500, charge another patient $1000 using newly available hospitalization slot.

The original patient ends paying $1500 spend 1 fewer day hospital, opposed $1000. hospital nets $500, drug company nets $1500. drug company ferry profits back entities purchase products.

That patients getting shafted left, right, center.

With universal healthcare, hospital would negotiate drug company charge less $1000, patient ends better care, drug company still makes boatload anyways, hospital saves money.

The thing is, better part year deep thing across world, acutely obvious point faced one situations spread increasing, there's really option? nothing viable decision, going forced act, matter unpopular might be. would think inescapably clear point. given fact, leaders early inevitable pain lesser faster rather long ass lockdowns required reign massive case numbers keep allowing? yesssss sub full garbage. claim ""you care economy"" ya well sub single issue well. care one thing dont care anyone else affected things like shutdowns (the homeless, students, young workers, people mental health drug addiction challenges) Unfortunately raised voting age 40 I'd still good go....but hell would want vote yet another used car salesman career politician.

Once real representative upholds founding laws country I'll vote. continues one con man next....I'll watch herd pity lap hollow promises rhetoric. Well guess better üôàüôâ awhile cause know going headline many countries nearly daily awhile :( Look Germany, Merkel announced lockdown discussions waiting weeks. Everyone surprised decision came quickl.  Yeah remember seeing that. Basically meant we're going take better caution prevent improve sanitation etc. believe Constitution forbids blocking interstate travel. Meanwhile stocking bleach, canned veggies, meats yes even tp again

oh see much stop coronavirus! also contributing shortages! almost important masks Yeah, even lockdown right now, cases would still increase weeks. 100,000 per day still quite bit lower UK, Switzerland, Slovakia, Czech Republic, France, Spain, Poland, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal--Even Romania hit 110,000 US equivalent today Yeah I'm sorry man evidence support argument. God, tragedy. Think important advancements society miss Thank work infectious measles huh? Silver linings.  brought Spain plane. new variant virus discovered norway.

Why blame Spain new strain new version could brought outside?.  Lol!! seems like closing borders racist. Also may provide immunity offering low level exposure. Yup, people places hide cause another outbreak. England ~2x pop Taiwan. Taiwan also significantly different culture England US, advantages disadvantages. People don‚Äôt realize long difficult transfer patients. One hospital full surgical divert. surgeries must transferred. nearest hospital refusing transports computer system/EMR got hacked. hospitals won‚Äôt take patients don‚Äôt negative Covid test, rapid tests. 

So next closet generally take patients 90 miles away. can‚Äôt launch chopper winds 25 mph, conditions aren‚Äôt abnormal there. Also, large patients don‚Äôt fit chopper. leaves us ground transport. aren‚Äôt allowed speed, it‚Äôs typically 2 hours hospital. hour offload, give report, gas up/ decontaminate rig. two hour trip back. 

So FIVE hours transport one patient. Usually time get back, there‚Äôs another transport waiting. Patients families angry don‚Äôt understand logistical challenges long delays. get it. isn‚Äôt anything do. doesn‚Äôt care anyone else lies make look terrible? doesn‚Äôt make sense me. could worse. someone wants treat people hydroxycloroquine. I'm grateful PM. Damn! Anyways ...Why earth would go 500k/day one week? say increase like would unprecedented even strong enough word. It'd absurd.  Overzealous mod. Wow. Antibody tests one thing PCR tests aren‚Äôt widely available Gothenburg unfortunately. It‚Äôs somewhat mind numbing difficult get one right now.  Czech Republic already accomplished feat: 550,000 US equivalent one day last week Thats true, tried didnt work ‚Äúmuh freedom‚Äù next fastest way run thru population one get sick everyone builds immunity time. virus die off. would rather completely lock 2 weeks government doesnt want like china forcefully lock peoples doors cancel travel. We‚Äôre stuck bit shitty situation rn people stubborn cant agree eachother whats best. wouldnt surprised military gets involved next months thought education? still incredibly young. might help could meet people teach adult. might actually find something rewarding life could actually instead spending time talking other's accomplishments internet. Overzealous mod.   Covid shooter.  likely? I'm surprised putting much stock are. guy self reporting something, published frankly unreputable news source history shoveling clickbait. I'm saying eyes need open looking ADE, source certainly says nothing. I'll wait peer reviewed paper try asking implications.

As enhanced severity reinfections, noticed severe reinfections seem occur relatively shortly first infection? recall correctly, Nevada case happened \~55 days apart. might say antibodies played role here, contrast oft cited fishing boat study. tale two viruses. information whether Nevada patient even seroconverted begin with. I'd wager there's different explanation light evidence. Eyes open, healthy skepticism. took antibody test June. could booked time day delayed two days got result next day. 

Several friends taken PCR tests. got delivered door day result next day.

Lol. thought everyone party island taken ‚Äòprecautions.‚Äô Kim truly ‚Äúhumbled.‚Äù interesting.  fomites need wipe groceries.  turns totally false.  droplets seem minimized, aerosols important.  Masks seem much article. help much one would hope.   

Sounds like large volume spaces outside air injection much safer small spaces.  Would also indicate outside, even crowd, hazardous.  really true?  great news is. wear mask grocery stores also go parties people dont wear them. mandates dont fix mean: France really detecting 50 K people positive daily, actual number new daily infection 10x that. 

It that, no.

""A days ago thought saying ""between 40% 80% world's population already exposed virus"" crazy think close through.""

Where say that? still deaths Taiwan, less density. I'm saying bad means, perfect. can‚Äôt argue stupid....

Btw thank hard work sacrifice. I‚Äôm opposite side world don‚Äôt Covid am. I‚Äôm grateful heart always goes RN‚Äôs US Europe. don‚Äôt think possibly thanked enough do. Oxford submit phase 3 data peer review recently? think they're everything assure public safe.  Poo poo pee pee caca head fart coast China mean anything. like people swimming there. could stay isolated sitting boat within sight NYC. need certificate leave door, I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs pretty locked down... Lol! relevant here? 

There already masks mandates place places saying happened there. find data supports saying? Pure evil, essentially bombing innocent civilians. Act war opinion. Nope, like third time Dude, yoy said possible change mind hearing full argument.

So done here. Goodbye nice day. Wtf? flu mutates multiple times rate still pump vaccines it. thing mutating slowly comparison. That's unscientific nonsense. go fuck self Unfortunately original source questionable tabloid various NHS trusts England preparing vaccinate staff soon approval occurs. lot hospitalization alarm articles end warning (i.e. ""could fill X"", people work hard make adjustments prepare often actually end happening).

But sounds legitimately bad already, even peaking.

I feel bad healthcare workers exhausted this. Mobility data good way measure sick leave dude. 

I know want claim US would give recommendations, result would similar Sweden. another statistic you: 73% swedes high moderate trust government agency issues recommendations covid. That‚Äôs works Sweden swedes follow recommendations. won‚Äôt mean, Fauci stated vaccine widely available April.

And Pfizer said applying EUA 3rd week November(november 15-21), means atleast limited use vaccine year, see FDA instantly scheduling meeting soon apply quickly review it. IFR ca. 0.4%. Almost everyone dies, suffers serious symptoms, 80+ years old. still people afraid thing... laughable. Devil‚Äôs advocate, don‚Äôt shoot messenger: haven‚Äôt heard spread WDW universal Orlando they‚Äôve open summer. sure companies influence bury news though. Could break 500,000 daily end next week?

I doubt it, imagine that? 

My best friend, wife kids caught back April. tells every time talk want it. 

I imagine caught again. works enormous factory thousands people. heard repeat infections yet, would think it'd happening sooner later. context US, perspective zero merit.

If talking southeast Asia, nuances debated, US.

The rest world could eliminated COVID-19 would still epidemic US. Science anything useful say origins, though. situation ripe anything made-up fill vacuum. Yeah think controversial prediction make even including US (the sticking point).  

I get every day. big deal mask distance. Ok, that's fair. thinking along lines poor patients pay like 100k hospital bills maybe billed billing system available. feel really bad patients get really sick leave hospital mountain debt way pay off.  also bought house like much. like home. 

Imagine saving smart money buying house saying ""lets go somewhere else often possible."" dude, that's literal opposite I'll live life. half majority wearing chinstrap.

Seriously people, hard? wont get Americans Americans ill tell people want dive really wrong system, forget remdesivir, instead ask favipiravir, PO med current use Asia, feature even one completed trial US.

Hint: intellectual property US pharmaceutical company. Trump using methods keep states open. wish things held you. Yup. numbers makes sense: people Europe symptoms tested. may sound crazy friends got it, one got take test. basically lie symptoms (like pretending headaches loss taste even symptoms) get mean: France really detecting 50 K people positive daily, actual number new daily infection 10x that. 

You're talking ass.  
A lot people around got tested slightest hint sickness contact somebody sick, lot open testing centers get tested without appointment.  

Real numbers probably x2 x10.  No, 38 % people seeking test sick exposed wealthy white neighborhoods, mask rates almost 80% course, claim doctor, articles I've read online. Uh no, current lockdown goes effect tonight Dec 1, obviously extended we're 5k cases day. old, vulnerable vaccinated, what's justification continued measures?

It's binary. many factors. Infection rates, therapeutics, on. 

But idea we'll able actually get enough vaccines produced distributed time next year laughable, anyone knows anything supply chains. 

Look, hurt foot night took seriously, dancing joy knew going get jail first. I've recently started pushing meet people, swing dancing, board games, healthy, 50, live alone, work home. I'm pristine, bro. 

And idiots idiotic things shut us back down. simple one like this: something like $20000, far memory goes order one job. OWS rough plan least. There's plenty still figure out, made high-level distribution plans:  may targeted groups, would much like gather much opinions independent scientists take shot. hope can‚Äôt see pay people wear masks. get free money. Immediate incentivation works better potential bad outcomes may never even see. \*waves Boris Johnson\* know happening. letting states know ok set rules quarentine travel states ok help. state governors want please small vocal group now. leader loses prove smaller majority. It‚Äôs true. people come really virus, want keep reminding careful (like me). 

The news tries get clicks create stir. 

Do research find whatever enjoy, see activity adapted temporary new norms. bet find safely go places made feel happy past, even come routine enjoy.

I night week no-news period walking home gym store, damned didn‚Äôt think ‚Äúfuck, I‚Äôm good evening!!‚Äù

It‚Äôs possible, figure out, shit memory soon enough. issue makes harder get volunteers promising candidate cures can‚Äôt believe California allowing open. comes caveat testing capacity nearly non-existent original peak March/April, current case numbers likely tenth back then. r/China_flu needs banned BS. 
Because article guy taiwan travelled overseas tested positive covid. 
So, got Taiwan. K thanks, keep posted. Nobody defeated everybody has. still reservoir anywhere, break again. celebration containment drastically premature. People think I‚Äôm weird parent aren‚Äôt letting kids trick treat area 1.5 percent testing percent. wonder got low. pop December Wow America seems chaotic. would never happen Canada. affected Taiwanese people anti-maskers?

Pre-covid already considered normal behavior wear mask cold/flu public, public transit, school work. people also like wear masks public transit reduce chances catching cold, although people normally bother. 

Looking visibly sick (coughing, sneezing) without mask minor social faux paus. cultural thing. asking universal mask compliance ""big ask"" begin with, people already home. OWS goal start delivering first vaccines high risk groups within 24 hours approval. probably looking late November, early December approval everything works out, could launching 4-6 weeks, best case. hope tries flee country then. Well would good. people choose stay locked next 10 years make lives easier :) long schools remain open, we're going get thing control... People still tell get house. would I? bought awesome house love inside it. hell referencing ‚ÄúKhaleej Times‚Äù instead literally relevant trustworthy source? going interview people, sample 80% Swiss women average age 32 would fine sample. fine indeed. set lead though. Ohio, Sheriffs voted county. officials. pass order sheriff basically choose enforce it, seen couple counties far. Teachers stuck rooms day, 150 kids pass hour hour. know avoid covered covid miasma. still evil... sidelines hospital resources, forces people already ill dealing illness deal billing issues, involve many hours frustration. Beyond that, bad actors acquired private billing data, that's huge privacy issue. Maybe officially, smart enough actually analyze data obvious much higher that.

For example, france twice many cases, half many deaths. doubt italians actually die twice often. care learn lesson, much hurt them. Maybe suit PPE make ICU's COVID ward. Yeah, 6 year olds surely gonna swapping masks other, smearing whatever range whatever snot masks anything around. gonna paramount sanitation!

I honestly know whether low years ot school risk, much contradictory data. are, need *closed*, turned kind theater. charts full objective objective data

So troll. I've flaired username accordingly feed you. nice life. Dude, reinfections probably ridiculously rare, assume maybe 10x listed amount scale true population infected, popular we'd seeing many cases. Yup. numbers makes sense: people Europe symptoms tested. may sound crazy friends got it, one got take test. basically lie symptoms (like pretending headaches loss taste even symptoms) get tested.

&amp;#x200B;

I mean: France really detecting 50 K people positive daily, actual number new daily infection 10x that. 

&amp;#x200B;

At rate weeks close entire french population shall it.

&amp;#x200B;

A days ago thought saying ""between 40% 80% world's population already exposed virus"" crazy think close through.

&amp;#x200B;

It's also control even understand they're putting restrictions / lockdowns place. strictest strictest lockdown get rid virus. measures strong enough, virus still growing.

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot help sadly sarcastically smile bit grandeur-delusion issues thought could contain virus.

&amp;#x200B;

Politicians definitely gods. may lesson virus. States can, know sure feds though (though believe would unlikely could). forget wins he's sworn end Jan Especially since lockdown definitely nearly complete one March.

Schools remain open, visits old people homes still authorized, way people March forced go back work. 

Frankly see make R ratio go 0.9 measures; means state lockdown going last months extends way Christmas... concerns conversation goes like this:

**Media**: ""Listen experts."" \***Interview certain favored experts.\*** 
**Other Experts: ""**We entirely agree."" 
**Media:** ""The experts disagree us crackpots!"" **\*Try hard possible discredit experts.\***

In end, comes driven much media's preconceived expectations real expert consensus. trustworthy consensus form dissent among experts welcomed gets real consideration. openness possibility dissenters correct. No, small number small number OP referring ""natural herd immunity"",

That's binary shit I'm railing about. would put grandma hotel room April, grandma hotel, rest us locked tight. say anything lines. Dude that's literally job. they're saying we'll back normal 2022 mean entire world. would single USA LOL

You really wanna stay indoors man. Replying others negative ass outlook Regardless, bode well dealing pandemic. said improbable literally happened BLM protests. idea wearing masks technically slippery slope fallacy? Exactly. EVOLVED.  
The constitution change, people strong enough, whatever overturned. 2nd Amendment divine law God must never touched.  


Thanks constructive discourse. Plenty countries regions reached containment phase. Many able maintain making minor adjustments mitigation measures time time. even possibility? I'm sorry I've awhile. work super complicated cars now. print money bro. Meanwhile, multiple FB groups popped MN organize mass protest kind distance learning model bigger districts. mission explicitly states want children school full time NOW.

I get it. I‚Äôm parent who‚Äôs lucky enough kids school moment. Shits hard kids really best school environment (the majority anyway). people lost sense comes this. germany sweden show similar rise cases deaths shooting germany. 


Are saying lag deaths country dependent ? know including US world predictions, especially predictions match Dr. Fauci's without question. 

But yeah think saying US excluded WHO's global predictions before, somewhat opposite reasons. saying Fauci predicting Spring normal. got walloped early testing still totally inadequate. Based deaths one heavily impacted countries. Lol. Good job ignoring objective data doubling stupid. know graphs different scales y-axis, right? dare remind Publix chicken tendies. ü§§ I'm introvert. Life bit easier pandemic people retire get invited retirement parties. standing around making idle conversation hour. declining invitations making excuses. 

No listening people say things like, ""Come on, fun. chance get house."" want get house I'll go hike go eat sandwich breakwater enjoy view, wont even think invite people. INviting people something think doing. think stop turning going exact wrong direction, keep going straight mostly miss i‚Äôm people person likes go friends :( Nah, 1st december least, reevaluation every 2 weeks.  
Local chatter talking lockdown lasting new year probably, saying february 21.  
Atmosphere quite grim rn France Oh gosh you‚Äôre right. Let‚Äôs call Chinese communist party virus, continue stick heads sand cry it‚Äôs China‚Äôs fault ten months pandemic. good do? originated China SECOND knew fact serious virus: could fixed it. Tracked it, tested, quarantined. knew EXACTLY didn‚Äôt beginning EVERYTHING that‚Äôs happened since fault. China‚Äôs. Also, Taiwan offered help us six months ago, expertise supplies. Trump refused. deaths him.  Oh it‚Äôs done 20 comments ago, didn‚Äôt notice? I‚Äôve requested form evidence side 10+ times you‚Äôve given nothing.

Stop spreading misinformation. very, bad.

Thanks. answer question, virus need completely disappear order lift restrictions permanently? Yes No?

There yes answer question, obviously avoiding know ridiculous. virus going completely vanish, we're going live it. Time Putin time identify them. But, but, herd mentality. even take worst case scenario hit, 70,000 deaths 60 days, includes Thanksgiving right middle. talking going actual restaurant post though. sub makes seem like I'm home 24/7 ordering groceries online nothing else care. care. want get sick get anybody sick. 

Like others said, stop selfish dining restuarants, non-essential. Contrarily popular belief, sub mind go walks safely socially distance yourself(with mask) around others. That‚Äôs exactly tell kids! far good ! remember lot people need care *getting* care, now, cases explode point cannot medically help people anymore (remember Italy earlier year) deaths rise lot more.

Yes lock downs kill. wtf people 60 still deserve live.

Who said didn't? talking risk various age groups.

Just higher risk older mean younger people need act death round every corner people seem want do. Prepare tinfoil hats.

Wiretapping government = okay.

Wiretapping MIT = great news.  Oh see... one ""Sweden second wave"" people?

Did look version cherry-picked graph? one bunch nations either second wave, halted second wave could get going?

See difference? are. Stop worrying much let live. already you‚Äôre trying imprison her. 5 teh 9 tested positive, worked wedding attendees. Without contact tracing hard say spread whom. Even did, Trump downplayed virus knew threat posed WAY things got hand directly responsible covid deaths U.S.. need many deaths begin with. Luckily, vaccine induced immunity usually much stronger natural immunity! likely eternal (will require annual booster shots), stronger current immunity we're seeing. people born anti-freeze blood. probably walk right sauna seat outside ice bench laugh heartily entire meal, pour hot water ""down there"" unstick themselves, crack hole ice, go swim back sauna.

...yet.

It detect virus got yesterday. However, even 100% effective, think mass testing help lot. best numbers, gdp record breaking, we're great.... /s can‚Äôt check progress 2022? Lol, sure. please do, take first delusional narcissistic viewpoint.

We dinosaurs asteroid.  ""taipei environs"" - 2019 

HAHHAHAH Calm tits, hope mature enough realize life black white. We're either good bad. Either Science believers disbelievers. Responsible murderers etc. 

In years, understand thing people old enough remember Tony Fauci's legendary love publicity do. hope remember post come back eat humble pie finally realize about. reflected today‚Äôs reality? 
And tell would change agree said true ? Asian countries? get herd immunity. actually herd immunity all. Herd immunity relation vaccine used. allows cannot get vaccine still protection. Letting virus spread naturally population herd immunity... natural disease progression... Completely unethical consider plausible alternative. guess vaccine included yearly flu shot. Seriously sick people telling world end so-and-so gets elected.

You know what? president much effect nation, office president *too much power*. 400,000 deaths would 170,000 course 5 months. average 1,100/day sounds right, especially winter holidays, family gatherings, college students heading home.

I also see getting considerably worse, another wave going nursing homes hitting elderly Christmas. experiences okay, couple months ago. Still takes long. week end end. need immediate testing given fast virus spreads. unless professional athlete, high ranking official, forget shit. Ahhh, infamous GRU operative Unit 74455. unit responsible every hack Western world totally scapegoat every Russian IP find (they fingerprints, know). skeptical first fully convinced thank you.

I hope proficiency reaches beyond Jenkins, please tell verify attacks coming Russian government. There‚Äôs guy thread saying we‚Äôll need new vaccines every six months end time. can‚Äôt even comment ridiculous without downvoted dirt say ""avoid meeting people outside"", ""do meet people outside"". fines so. Plus closed service industry, closed bars restaurants, closed amateur sports. completely different approach, Yeah thinking worst case scenario. Imagine healthcare workers short supply got sick enough PPE. got sick didn‚Äôt anyone help you? remember saying we‚Äôd lucky 200k. We‚Äôll see 500k spring. open are. Hes wrong. upvoted criticism quote (someone else must downvoted, know why). good reasonable dialogue. 
I problem accepting reality there's corruption bloat. mixed bag plenty bad - net benefit US global public regardless.

OWS nationalist equivalent COVAX, far ambitious, unfortunately far less financial resources, hopefully end working benefit - Pharma execs cashing bonuses pandemic.

Again, understand cynicism, program utterly necessary despite flaws. I'm honestly confused, fascist propaganda? obvious bias seen anything fascist Came ask question. Luckily willpower something running short on, stay safe friend.  fact people apparently (according response) see questions links insults says lot sub. you.

Good bye. Ah yes, someone gave wholesome award Yeah whole world it...

Wow.

Spoiler Alert: US center universe. Overall bad 1968 HK flu. Yes, well, according people like Democrats also operating pedo service pizza shop, so... detects Covid recorded coughs, asymptomatic? Cough hallmark symptom. Sad thing is, honestly thought exaggerating numbers like 70,000 could say ‚Äúlook fine job did‚Äù. Boy wrong. Using comorbid figure dismiss seriousness covid like pointing dysentery serious dehydration comortality infection. lot things smart. comments people usually make house burns down. afford Y(Fire Extinguisher, offsite backups, whatever). think X(Ransomware?) Z(Debbie account trying redeem free ipad?) would ever happen you!

Why things occur many reasons. Maybe wasnt budget year, maybe budget squandered away vacation trip CEO. knows, they're giving need. shit happens, show email chains urged it. probably wont acknowledge it, expecting fix it. do, attempt job. buckle buddy, gonna rough one. correct, corona takes precedence potential wipe everything leave victims without jobs, insurance, depressed, suicidal, cancer sick. ultimate human cost letting pathogen lose cripples systems treating things. doubt people suffer, choice. right, people suffer unpleasant things must done contain it. I‚Äôm repeating Fauci said article commenter referring to. Edit: [here‚Äôs since summer said going introduce local/regional recommendations situation gets worse. 
The recommendations pretty much spring. consistent compared Germany's soft lockdown, France's hard lockdown Czechia's surrender? Tegnell's bullshit 

You moron still think Tegnell sits dictates restrictions. Ots also 7 montha since world cases Flu. astrange coincidence??

Zero deaths flu period according WHO. think Covid vaccine might authorized emergency use then, don‚Äôt think available everybody then. Easter going gone! Like miracle. That‚Äôs Easter 2022 though USA go put extreme lockdown place 2-4 weeks? What's answer? Stricter mask mandates? Lockdown? yeah searched france germany it. looks like post france, bad. equivalent 3,760 deaths/day US second wave would mean got cases almost none didn‚Äôt happen.

A wave ending would evidenced clear decline cases followed extended plateau another rapid rise. think second wave, third. Jared already spilled beans interview. WH's plan push responsibilities states blame governors correct political affiliation. always forget factor care looks like field hospital triaged setting limited resources. many areas soon look like. Yes. understand easier means context Coronavirus? means thinks countries lower level immunity need harsher restrictions keep cases down. right speculative. thing happened last year. sudden 1st wave flood posts ""Good news"". Oddly enough, investigated accounts eastern Europe. sure care America though. 
Are bots paid social media reps? 
Possibly. account posting almost positive news. lot complete BS. Go check history yourself. 

What's really interesting account, like ""all good news accounts"" created year ago. Minor edit, mean KF94 There‚Äôs way know you‚Äôre getting counterfeits,

That sounds self serving. trust vendors listed, frankly I'd rather deal ebay vendor 20k+ positive rep. 

You buy genuine masks ebay. I've done it. also several new effective treatments like steroids stretched beyond capacity. vaccine also decrease mortality transmission help drugs pipeline, possible see light end tunnel. 

That said, pray learn lessons pandemic. politicize pandemic. Act quickly. generally agree Bezos axiom slow steady steady fast, slow effective fast virus. Early containment far effective humane late shutdowns death. April? predictions included people comorbidities. * Drug addiction including opioid epidemic

* Vaping Smoking

* Obesity unhealthy diets

* Texting driving

Are expecting people stupid things?  said last week could told people it‚Äôs serious disease instead politicizing masks, telling people magically go away, churches open April ‚ÄúLIBERATE MICHIGAN‚Äù tweets....

Do need continue? percentage long? saying case, seen study indicating hard fast dataset long haulers. It‚Äôs definitely understandable. think level ptsd, anxiety depression among healthcare workers gonna major struggle even this. think medical field really fucked speaking protests summer. convinced lot general public virus longer important care created new sect people became convinced political tool. lot nurses/doctors quit seeing double standard play leadership network. We‚Äôll get friend. Even hope dead, there‚Äôs always sheer willpower point seems likely bunch nations hedging bets Trump staying power, much damaging anything else compared don‚Äôt watch yourself? acknowledged public, took back said, emphasized importance masks. unless everyone ‚Äúanti-mask‚Äù brigade expert infectious diseases, I‚Äôm sure opposite majority poorly educated, understand don‚Äôt accept reasoning behind actions. Maybe incompetent? Google it? takes like 15 seconds Glad wear masks. That's protects you. must got somewhere else. Thanks sharing info. underlying idea circuit breaker approach makes intuitive sense: cutting oxygen fire reduce embers, instance, restoring airflow intermittently doesn‚Äôt produce large flames. add steady continuous oxygen supply, even low level, blaze quickly rages control.

If think human civilization a...‚Ä¶.*building fire*, approach makes perfect sense! Great, vaccine delayed late 2021, proves relatively ineffective? real life scenarios worth least talking about. Herd immunity plan A, say straight unacceptable plan misguided could well exit strategy. ayn rand basis anything true. say April year? think not!  DeWine's spine resigned May. Lockdowns done correctly supposed coupled massive expansion testing tracing. idea drop infection rate point could reopen things quickly catching isolating infected people get control again. None happened US. Lock anti maskers sigh relief among fellow spouses married medical professionals.

But I‚Äôm wary PPE stocks.

I pile N95‚Äôs rain ponchos wife‚Äôs clinic. Looked foolish buying January, probably storing indoors summer things lull, I‚Äôm sure now.

I gladly take looking foolish wife‚Äôs group needing these, really need specific brands, it‚Äôs buffer. elastomer respirators too, don‚Äôt filter way it‚Äôs emergency use only. Imagine turning 21 year....... sure did. Yeah, I'm sure. SCOTUS ruled certain things (like mandatory vaccinations) public health purposes legal. far, think done state level. take much stretch federal level.

(Of course current SCOTUS might see things differently). app too. yeah, early days first lockdown, paper only, people left without printer copy lengthy form. rely nice neighbourghs leaving piles forms mailbox. President United States: ""We rounding corner!"" lull aliens false sense security, course. he's correct.

If he's basing position work went paper linked chances correct pretty cdc estimates ifr across us population 0.6% threshold.

Link I'll comment - though note change parameters crude IFR IFR US population... Probably due American politics, lot fuckery going CDC presenting data anyway, e.g. using logical methodological gymnastics call IFR aged 70+ 0.054% data particularly useful data virus never got control recorded cases. [IFR far rigorously conducted systematic review meta analysis Ionnadis one puts IFR 0.68%, noting significant differences populations. Kersey jail since December charges stalking, domestic violence communicating threats, clearly caught virus there, wife said.

Welp... let go? everyone jail similar charges, released protect prisoners?

Regarding inmates kept don‚Äôt quarantine new detainees 14 days, step experts say prevent virus getting foothold jails.

Solitary confinement would human rights violation. suppose could put one person per cell 14 days, logistically that's probably impossible.

Maybe transition 100% remote learning, house inmates schools space spread out. numbers really reflect though? rising similar rate USA? could seriously wrong Hrm, I'll check later, blocked work unknown site. Yeah blame someone right lol. sub trash top that, suggested (proved, point?) gotten once, there's nothing stopping getting again.

If that's case there's hope vaccine. letter wrote proven could open safely California restrictions made open hard would stay closed  let's stop saying herd immunity then. let's use ""population immunity"", something else politicized. basically, two different meanings herd population immunity. analogy like use hot water heater faucet. 

the first one threshold virus basically stops circulating. that's hot water heater. run shower day, eventually run hot water, takes forever, extremely wasteful run shower day. need someone else (the vaccine) come shut water heater point. 

the second one faucet. people get infected, probability encountering another vulnerable person goes down. different conditions like population density, income status, behavior, government response act person controlling faucet, creating different streams different areas. fraternity row major university might full, hot stream water reach 90% infections. middle aged remote workers might slow trickle 3 4%. low income area lots essential workers need reach higher threshold than, say, wealthy neighborhood San Francisco. everyone fucking negative? Like couldn‚Äôt make work?! think made sure people affected got financial support live halt place do-able. TELL banks landlords evict! MAKE utility companies forgive bills couple months! Provide stimulus like every fucking country world! LEAST. Restaurant dine-in, gyms bars establishments can‚Äôt feasibly wear mask entire duration stay NEED close couple months!!! can‚Äôt keep going like this!

Indeed, let‚Äôs forget complete border opening Eastern European countries summer, cases spiking want barred home weeks government rations? still want mock ""freedom""? Winter coming =/ ""typhoid mary"" reason despite strict lockdown virus come back *rothschild intensifies* wipe butts home What's funny OP could've linked worldmeters kept title would allowed. Spain ""Patria del Covid""! stop part problem instead try part solution

you'll literally complaining results inability put others wellbeing ahead yourself, using justify actions. ridiculous circular reasoning What's US equivalent? Well, much weekend plans, then. :( Well shit we're already 100k infections per day, going long dark fucking winter  even totals daily reports. Deaths substantially higher Worldometers CDC/ John Hopkins COVID tracking project.

I always felt worldometers least reliable. Nothing would jive New York State‚Äôs data follow closest. nice is, would probably avoid spreading news people get complacent quickly would destroy remaining efforts reduce spread February there's [no particular pandemic event means give society culture. point, agree. Italian press reports number cases tests, gives rate ~12-13%. BNO estimates higher exclude something, don‚Äôt know exactly. Bubonic plague kill everyone though give good try. people immune. remnants remain society today. advocating way go aftermath this, genetic testing everyone insightful people got sick died even notice it, antibodies show did.  guess purely numbers thing. Despite bad seems COVID, amount people getting infected compared total population still pretty small despite amount people trials, chance getting virus vaccine small. I'm downplaying virus means, putting perspective makes sense. Seems pretty fair think human impact per capita basis. People directly affected virus really care reasons they're affected (""I'm sick really count because...""). evidence claim? Well really about. country literally one city, like small countries indeed are, 100% urbanisation, also 100% urbnisation, 50 cities 2% population each. 

In Denmark. west Sweden people literally daily traveling entire country due smaller size. presume normal people im Malm√∏ G√∂teborg daily drive Stockholm work? Cause countries. people going urban places people get infected infection spread URBAN places.

It's pointless talk Urbanisation %. might 87% Sweden 10% Russia think that's fair comparaison giant country? job lost it.

OP referring ""natural herd immunity"", correct about; exist. virus spreads slow infect enough people cause mass immunity.

This reason flu still around. Despite hundred years yearly vaccine, still deadly ever-present. Think bad would without vaccine. That's ""herd immunity"" people trying sell Covid. ""Forget vaccine, infect everyone let God sort out"". 

It's morbid. It'll kill millions. even work. Oh god, mentioning numbers reminded back February, looking daily growth rates hoping percentages would drop curve growth would flatten OK, we're probably different ends political spectrum, trim details bit focus one crucial question: really best time protesters flooding streets? half Poles city even wear masks properly. Majority people either side political spectrum seem understand danger posed Covid. go European Polish subs reddit see people advocating abortion would love see fall Church. also people could called legitimate radical leftists anarchists.

Kaczy≈Ñski strong views first admit, wish overall PiS could better job moderating message tone. moderately socially conservative Pole (who church decade might add), like Jarek terrified happening streets. I'm tired getting called fucking Nazi government called undemocratic fascist whathever-da-fuck else lies.

I can't sympathize people flooding streets putting elders danger. people young remember life like communists, acknowledge massive progress Poland made past 15 years especially, really understand democratic process. that's fine, Poland young democracy, we're still trying figure out. public health emergency right now, masks magical prevention virus transmission, social distancing also necessary. government conspiracy, scientific fact defeating pandemic absolute top priority right now. real, much longer stand administration promotes Eugenics Plausible Deniability? Cook bat way through. pink middle.  UK amazing well compared France Italy. weird Absolutely not. Lockdowns work, delay spread bit. meantime kill small businesses, spike drug use violence, kids miss school, suicides go up, cause panic.  trade lives best destroy economy worst.

You dont want this. true lockdown means going left die home one coming save you. get weekly ration. get arrested shot leaving home questions asked. really want that? Considering get reinfected herd immunity longer applies. Christ.... agree. National lockdowns would pointless right now. Calling masks, distancing, working home, etc. ""lockdown"" calling removal mitigations pump herd virus insanity. less likely expose really sick people thus lessening number people get exposed really high viral loads.

IIRC, viral load independent symptoms. Meaning, asymptotic people shed much virus symptoms. Idk pfizer hasnt hit goal... like 43k people gotten either placebo vaccine, still havent 32 people covid yet. guys get rates from? patients asymptomatic. software good detecting symptom people either report can't detect. Well don‚Äôt work done. Honestly, fucked. agree (and hasn't) happened. Diminishing returns going start happening holidays, spring. People aren‚Äôt going want give another round proms/weddings/graduations compare daily flu deaths? sorry that. correct MUCH difficult get control would earlier. so? Facebook crowd way dumb use meme like that. Fingers crossed then. Buck 
In early February (right getting phone friend lives shanghai told crazy locked there) remember looking wife holding 2 week old newborn 3yo next frank conversation.  Basically said go global pandemic lucky it'll year it'll like 18 months. lives going look different.  people didnt expect otherwise beyond me. They're probably keeping things air tight elections passed avoid lawsuits one way another. factitious, comment quite silly. real risk least 30% US population voluntarily take vaccine. hospitalizations slowing too. Good news. they're going lock start distributing vaccine ASAP open restaurants bars agian. there's evidence new ""version"" diff. spike protein though, like OG variant overtaken 2nd mutation, alter virus beyond vaccine recognition. /s ? edited titles also allowed sub, that's pretty normal them. hard explain? 
Man need food live. Man need car go get earn food live. Man fucking need staycation. slippery slope directly taking away first amendment rights directly. First tell wear mask little late, lockdowns start happening, leave house reason whatever deem acceptable criminal. want protest decisions automatically criminal disobeying stay home social distancing orders. think cops could attack nonviolent BLM protesters earlier year? breaking covid mandates. Whereas numerous states US whole experiencing record infection rates strained hospitals.

Edit:

Thank mysterious benefactor reddit Go Vote! Award. Well governor concerned.  Hasn‚Äôt ever really. Same, spockgiirl, same. already rule?

I can‚Äôt get 3 year old take mask even we‚Äôre home Maybe. can‚Äôt say sure don‚Äôt know many people actually March/April.

In end it‚Äôs pointless thing argue ""Greatest country world""?

Actually, **the greatest exceptional nation history **history world** span thousands years. We, America, greater entity last 5+ thousand years. It‚Äôs faulty test. That‚Äôs talk cases. many cases deaths? people going put together? Lol nope Interesting core tenet argument ends completely wrong fall back argument ignores fact delays spring saved lives lowering HFR, vaccine therapeutics months away, 1/3 population underlying condition, making nearly impossible protect whole. sure, let's maximize death toll wait.

You guys becoming flat earthers point. amount wrong going change position. hurr durrr weally!? D: dis happenerS?!

You mentioned downvoted post, downvote.

But also said Reddit Reddit response question somebody getting downvoted, consistent hive mind.

I guess i‚Äôll alternate upvotes downvotes comment till batter runs out. look comment total keeps jumping around strangely, thats me. feasible? price? 0.4 deaths/1MM

Yeah, I'm putting Ireland list excessively high 267/1MM.

Why? we're 704 deaths/1MM. 10th highest mortality rate world. 

Countries comparatively dirt poor compared US gotten virus control. Countries population densities 15x higher US gotten virus control.  This. entire country rate 1.2k/100k, means 1.2% population infected every 2 week, test symptomatic people   Oh wow hes back great job! gonna lot trauma generation doctors /nurses. places badly hit many doctors compared field doctor battlefield. 

Not fun deciding patients get live die barber since February, think best solution now? (And course support universal basic income *at least* everyone whose earnings affected this...) It‚Äôs scale. US could start churning million doses perfect vaccine tomorrow- would still take months hit effective levels population year get everyone. 

In news today yet another ‚Äúversion‚Äù Rona sweeping Europe. that‚Äôs case, may end lot like flu, varying effectiveness vaccine season-to-season. could provide greater disruptions. 

We‚Äôre going dealing changes lives time likely. multiple states‚Äô health infrastructure over-run right now, need everyone buck make continuing sacrifices lifestyles. know single Lock person liberal progressive SoCal, know anti-maskers/Open-Up proponents feel pandemic controlled &amp; need start live virus. I'm proud! :D ""fuck it"" mean? Letting people die streets want wear mask? want see Trump country give herd immunity ol‚Äô college try ngl There's gonna way take action tomorrow Immunologist/virologist here. Vaccines devil's work. must dance night dark full terrors. Well die covid,it's doing. least ECDC finally acknowledges kids spread covid-19

In september ""covid-19 CANNOT spread children"", belgium we're 3% kids infected changed position proven covid reinfections map regarding severity upon reinfection. severe second time. careful now! us millennials sacks shit compared everyone else throughout history!

Look, pay much taxes (more President, even) government nothing üò° sporting events large gatherings

An actual thing asked about. Major sporting events (as sponsored big 4) going okay.  give states permission temporarily close borders states. sure power though. call appointment tell would come wear mask. use US mantra, ‚Äúcustomer king‚Äù side.
That also get first appointment day. either third wave never left first define waves based hospitalizations (which removes - - testing bias).

[You see two clear peaks - rising hospitalization data. first peak essentially equal second, practice first peak even worse even hospitalized (a) tested early due lack kits may show confirmed COVID hospitalizations (b) data accurate/reported early days. Still, two clearly defined peaks. 

I think semantics, know conclude second wave (and either first third wave). guess could call [relative plateau end first wave, presumably see rise deaths would make second wave - future could call second wave based deaths alone - think hospitalizations better proxy waves given neutral measure infection spread. Death rates vary based quality care knowledge treatments. Well that's simply true. won‚Äôt low let disease run wild; much higher hospitals ICU overflow. mean live New England. It‚Äôs impractical shutter interstate commerce here. Im sure it‚Äôs different west one state size entire region here.

I wish better federal leadership guidance sure. nationwide lockdowns don‚Äôt think right choice. America geographically large diverse decision like that. It‚Äôs tough point Europe say ‚Äúwell France it, too.‚Äù France different situation. It‚Äôs useful look countries guidance, country different. 

But get it‚Äôs also complicated local leadership. good solution around.

I get behind phrase ‚Äúthe solution can‚Äôt worse problem.‚Äù can‚Äôt get behind trump says it, don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs capable directing country towards solution. got back - we‚Äôre making record cases right US daily think trying paint current situation rosy really best idea.

And yet death situation soooooo ... still lost well 230,000 people 

And counting ""deaths"" differently *any* previous best avoid getting others sick.

I do! moved different country February business collapsed due Covid. Im brand new town, dont know anybody, chance meet people lockdowns. Normally would meet people music arts scene. none happening. dont see *anyone*. Zero friends social contact past 8 months, outside saying Hi people stores delivery guy. mean, notion ""immunity"" sterile immunity agree you. context herd immunity question ""can reinfected"", ""will get severely ill highly contagious get reinfected"". pretty damn obvious. Also obvious primary authors know wtf they're talking about. would nice would explain areas NY 40-50% seropositivity leading state infection think interesting it‚Äôs resurgent many areas suffer full brunt pandemic, London, New York, northern Italy, Sweden.‚Äù Gupta, implies areas levels herd immunity may reached, meaning spread virus contained. Also explains US showed fall. Northern states fall summer, hot sunbelt states rose. they're opposite. Mirrors Europe. Also comparison masks vs masks Mask wearing city 70% I'd say 95% peak. know at. Gov Cuomo may institute lockdowns specific counties hospitals ICU's get overrun ill patients. Right there's shortage qualified critical care physicians nurses work front lines, unlike March &amp; April. beginning pandemic NYC could count states flying whole medical teams assist, Fall Surge blanketing entire country skilled human resources scarce.  know, thought downvoted peevish dimwits cling notion grift capital best interests heart, wondrous apparatus producing good world ever seen.

but fact downvotes far rapid, mechanical, synthetic, produced millennial's calloused thumbs think scientists make billions. Depends size place cost labor. Small place, help friends, recycled wood. Maybe could done affordably. Congrats: convinced another group people start living life normal headline. 

Do genuinely believe you‚Äôre going get people comply shit? Lmfao Judging downvotes, think everyone else missing joke here. chuckled tho. Bat suey weather. That's also midwest US currently highest cases, similar climate Europe. rest US likely follow go winter. Federal Government shut Interstate Highway System? would put pretty big damper travel. cause massive problems own, but, still. that's k effect. k large. means transmission lumpy: infected people infect others, ones infect lot others.

A bit like two-level Russian roulette: take revolver table dozen revolvers, give family members shot head, yourself. 11 dozen revolvers likely completely empty, one probably fully loaded. tough, fucking open nose throat Huh? simple purpose? It‚Äôs things. Washing hands. Physical distance. Air flow. Staying isolated needed. Wearing PROPER protective equipment.

I see you, grasp ‚ÄòwEaR uH mAsK‚Äô feels good go around policing others. reality masks created equal MANY factors educating people on. Yeah I'm gonna need example one legitimate scientist thinks herd immunity without vaccine possible. virus Spain taken home mainly plane. Name country.. nine worse us responding covid pretty much controlling better United States. Right?! yet people believe going singular vaccine... nope. Even flu, astutely pointed out, even decades making them, it‚Äôs best guess possible strain. corona virus. It‚Äôs gonna mutate faster wolverines baby. NEVER going singular vaccine best guess approach still takes month rolling research. either annual best guess case people still gonna get it. vaccine whatsoever. going learn live thing. Period. People need accept that. 2020 I'm expecting lethal mutation.

I'm also expecting magnetic poles switch meteor wipe us out. Schools reopening. Threat incorrect word use here, yes empty statement probably intent question.

So sound like really words, way government designed essentially allow states make rules laws right? even local/municipality level depending states certain decisions even left local level e.g. mayors etc.? saying regular shot too? Sweden hit herd immunity months ago. one dying corona now, literally.

So no. poop general! :( ig shop lift deserve death? disability rate? stats? boy Biden ‚Äúconspiracy‚Äù he‚Äôs goin through? Depends whether lighter restrictions get numbers control PPE issues solved now. excuse this. turn unemployment funding emergency PPE factory makes sense form economic standpoint well public health. negligence. enough population vaccinated Taiwan also countries gets lot travel from, think basic least inconvenient measures stay place. 

YOu want become one stories keep seeing.. early success stories go wrong. mean....I hope too.

Either way trump problem, either scenario, he‚Äôs going away.

I also think trump many way symptom 40% people‚Äôs frustration country. loses Biden wins, Trump still going problem. think it‚Äôs naive think Trump going away January 20th Biden wins. False.

I‚Äôm actually actively involved making numbers look better.

It‚Äôs next best thing actually able get things control. let‚Äôs face it, literally 11,000,000 Florida man Florida, one stop force nature.

So hoping Publix‚Äôs Chicken Tendies good enough encourage semblance mask usage pad stats long. right, would illegal. stop people reddit crying it, though, governors can't make mandate themselves. Lol even close. president listened science, initiated mask mandate, chose honest instead lying nonstop could eliminated half deaths more.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve tried absolutely nothing we‚Äôre ideas‚Äù gist administration‚Äôs covid strategy.

How anyone suggest incompetence didn‚Äôt make things worse bewildering. Especially someone says don‚Äôt support politically. absolutely equal, terms media. ""drink tears"" phrase necessarily sides that's weird specific. There's much hatred directed left right vice versa. 

The issues CANDIDATES equal terms media coverage yes bad sides bet one point, USA went 200 nanoseconds without cases, that's pretty much same.  right. court conservative interpret law, can't 'give' election Trump. fact people talking way shows Trumps disinformation working.

I think cases may get votes thrown ones states changed fly, example extending deadlines beyond current state law. Even then, SC hesitant allow large number votes thrown out, kinds legal issues. So, sheer number mail ins helps here.

Where chance SC making deciding decision end situation 2000 - questionable votes, single state, legal clock running down. election ends close, coin flip anyway. Yeah basically one wave passing around US. early lockdown measures worked places like Seattle New York City enacted followed elsewhere, we'd kicking covid's ass right now.

But no, can't that!  Thank detailed response! appreciate it. Yeah, heard interview elderly care homes Canada. said basically jail stimulation. That's horrible experience doubt.

I wonder there's form entertainment introduce everyone get social interactions stimulation isolated home. South African here. reminds far right conspiracy theory Mandela died would signal black people descend white people machetes (with implication white people rifles ready). Astoundingly, didn‚Äôt happen. 

Same nuts predict world end next Thursday excuse cooked after. people still follow one testable claim proven false... messaging 4 months [**2021-02-28 00:00:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-02-28%2000:00:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide Sometimes mention covid death statistics people, claim number greatly exaggerated anyone dies covid gets marked death toll. example someone telling people dying car crashes covid marked death toll. anyone tell accurate? vaccine-or-perish message become part zeitgeist.

If believe me, look mirror.

Managing public expectations real possibility disappointment difficult. Again, look mirror.

And everyone jump vaccine happen, want United States buy first.  Trump administration said would do. Surviving awful metric base anything of.

Comas patients surviving too... wouldnt call much life survived right? like quote see time time reddit -

""You can't reason someone position reason into"" Credible estimates put forecast end February around laughable. We'd need average 2k deaths per day reach number. gonna happen. 

RemindMe! February 28 2021 drug dealers still take cash don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs big deal. primarily use debit, Cash app, Apple Pay purchases. thought millions, sure. That's word used foreign media, believe.  Terrorism definition fit Yeah, flat earthers anti-vaxxers. much little bubble they'll simply claim stats disproving claims ""fake"". There's nothing say point convince them. can't see obvious trolling, brain dead. April 2023 Check papers, friend. Russia reported spike today. US. Europe. remember first death Washington state Trump's sympathy press platform misidentified victim woman. first thought is, kind accuracy we're going get leadership strap ... going sloppy, deadly ride. 

This kind work tedious detail oriented. That's Fauci's wheelhouse imagine number lives saved years due work like him. Entrusting hands attention-challenged political animal provides comfort trust whatsoever. tl;dr version:

39% people hospitalised April died.

9% people hospitalised August died. However, based smaller sample Trust say ‚Äòbetter outcomes‚Äô reflect severity symptoms treatment within hospital. 

Men 41% likely die women.

32% deaths people receiving palliative care. I'm sure whether means hospital gave palliative care covid patients, whether means people already palliative care caught virus. did, that's thought Dr. Campbell involved. appears suspicions wrong. Stop logic sense. Ain't one following jive. **/s** God, point dont think shit ever end. assume many smartest experts fields virology epidemiology say distinct possibility point. pessimism based weird desire people punished things ""the right way."" Funny must know people....... Bazinga, they're losing minds society asking something, instead giving something.

I buy rhetoric around privilege normally, 100% seeing here. Takers want keep taking. do. Meanwhile everyone else left damned table, hopefully staying away.

That, people normally power, ones keep lights pop fed, insane amount power now. one wants people exercise it, anyone else discover how... Useless many highly paid segments society are.

Disruption like historically helped workers, workers dumb right preoccupied saving theater owners restauranteurs, themselves. point ultimately dealing today like HK flu Spanish flu. I'm you, sometimes feel like crazy one.

It's forever. People history dealt much *much* severe conditions. lifetime/generation/century situation, forever. say it, money valuable human life.

I dont care money, care freedom. 


We've done fine. There's limit could done. Stay scared America, whatever never question government. Trust man pushed approving AZT even though it‚Äôs banned cancer treatment pure poison. It‚Äôs easy rewrite history people media money pharmaceutical industry. Yes azt killed thousands gay men forget that. Trust science hope rest us paranoid. UK COVID update: Daily hospital admissions (1,404) highest level since April

- New cases: 23,065
- Positivity rate: 7.5% (-1.3)
- hospital: 10,699 (+383)
- ICU: 957 (+55)
- New deaths: 280 everyone stays home millions people starve death. can't EVERYONE stay home parts society need essential workers going about. source? Pretty sure Donald believes himself, despite actually caught fucking thing. Without electoral college states without large populations would way equitably participating election. kinda true.

As soon Obama inaugurated suddenly economy recovery everything great.

I think facts ground change Biden's inauguration media coverage absolutely will. This. November 4th immediately morph one two things -

1. event Trump wins - ""well obviously they're going drop now, they'll probably keep next 4 years""

2. event Biden wins - ""well obviously they're going drop Trump still office, never said November 4th, said January 21st."" show video footage Trump constantly saying November 4th rallies, they'll say meant January 21st. know meant joke, LOLed hard. We're sooooo fucked. None changes anything said.

It actually supports it. takes time develop vaccines efforts work.

Some emotionally committed result far assured delivering want. even say month April? Maybe meant someone named April slammed brakes . . . delayed inevitable. Every place outbreak least once. ‚Äúzero deaths‚Äù flu. drop cases coincides measures taken prevent transmission Covid 19. That‚Äôs strange it‚Äôs even coincidence. It‚Äôs common sense.

You literally repeating fake news memes spread Facebook. Please learn critical thinking. Remember caravan? hoax theres juat limit President whole country. hand wasn‚Äôt invisible, trousers ‚ÄúTucking shirt‚Äù Jmo, novel virus. 
Novel new. 
Science, doctors, hospitals always change views learn it. 
The virus come set instructions, studied, learn it, adapt it. 

Thank stars science poisoned well everyone.

&amp;#x200B;

please explain WH/Trump COVD efforts countries **not President.** ""getting control"" vaccine works. Everyone went wedding take responsibility decisions. Fining establishment people made risky decisions stupid. ridiculous people want blame anyone themselves. Right? clearly knows nothing. estimates (I short background related field) pretty accurate now. made back March 20th. 

The equations rather basic. great challenge. Fauci said said he's looking numbers since March/April based good information.

USA still tracking for:

* 250,000 dead Election Day
* 300,000 dead Christmas
* 1 million dead COVID effectively stopped pandemic

And maybe importantly...SARs-CoV-2 may ""endemic"" USA always here. Similar HIV endemic. happen citizens (in large enough numbers) refuse take vaccine refuse take preventative measures.

The US--more countries--must figure deal intentionally misleading feeds coming FoxNews FB trolls. Maybe hold financially liable? tends work. manipulation people caused massive public health crisis cost around 1 million lives trillions lost finances.

Oh...and many anti-maskers actually die flu winter. look forward to. predicted 3000 best case, 5000 way going 8000 nothing province. 

We currently 25 get that, listening talk radio/tv completely different game. Ive watching train wreck decades, significant gap. mean often liberals looking drink tears conservatives? Sure *does* happen, standard. Compare forum comments Fox News Facebook. Objectively far worse. 

Yes sides issues. arent ""equal"" fair, even though posts probably irrelevant/low quality, mods define ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù rather broadly. includes arguments made academics experts world‚Äôs prestigious institutions. 

I assume mods think they‚Äôre protecting users suppressing plausible (weirdly) verboten ideas. me, makes seem 100x compelling. 

I‚Äôd much rather publicly skewer ideas deem wrong give Galileo treatment electoral college got Bill Clinton elected. purpose insure legitimacy president chosen nationwide still allow third party candidates chance run office. Neither Clintons 50% votes cast. predicted 400,000 based math.

Got attacked people saying full crap people rural areas would never get it.

Got attacked people saying covid denier believing estimate 3 million Americans would die. one making fun masks Europe, yet one wears here.

Look numbers, lot places Europe much worse US per 100,000 currently. bet Dossier Jacket. Invertebrates spine, like half Senate. different situation, shit close Florida. anomaly ages, we're talking like 500 votes. Biden wins, needs bring it. Dems take control, need take house senate never ever let go, let go wheel like letting Hillary nominee 16, bad bad things happen. Really shame there's (almost) drive-in movie theaters anymore. would cool fuck would nightly.  Ahead UK think examples? Itll magically go away election  yes. does.

what's ***record*** vaccine development prior one?

about 5 years. (MMR)

&amp;#x200B;

 throw data computer, let tell ***NOT*** WORK... equally valuable working towards solution. save time experiment rule things ***OUT***.

&amp;#x200B;

there literally HUNDREDS vaccine candidates worked tracker lists COVID-19 vaccine candidates currently Phase 1-3 trials, well major candidates pre-clinical stages development research. reveal in-depth information candidate, select ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù button click green plus button next entry. Yes we'd civil war. said we'd around 200,000, we've passed 30k deaths ago.

Fauci wrong AGAIN

&amp;#x200B;

/s people gonna realize nothing going work? Eventually everyone going get this. Get immune systems keep praying death rates go treatments get better. Nothing anyone going save you. disagree you. I‚Äôm curious think agree you.

I personally think targeted shut downs. Shut industries states problem, give targeted, generous stimulus/aid. Leave industries done safely open, strict enforcement - hire people spot checks, etc. think blanket lockdown blanket stimulus bad idea. gotten $1200 stimulus fully employed? That‚Äôs total waste money. totally get lockdowns happened April (we knew way less disease, case counts WAY higher numbers showed testing), moving forward, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs good move.

I get *looks like* what‚Äôs happened states, that‚Äôs case. live (MA), it‚Äôs blanket reopening, done ‚Äúphases.‚Äù

I think targeted shutdowns targeted aid (also, universal mask mandates stricter rules private gatherings) right way go. don‚Äôt see *actually* attempted. 

I also think lot people saying ‚Äúwell there‚Äôs way would work force everyone stay inside‚Äù honestly, think that‚Äôs pretty trash plan. think something better.

Edit: getting downvoted? disagreed nation wide lockdown? laid idea. OP gets upvoted saying people agree nationwide lockdown without even saying why. What? Previous years people dying COVID-19? virus made jump humans late 2019, hence name? Yeah, businessman someone supposedly ran company, really managerial skills intimidation deal making. People forget Trump Organization actually fairly small family company subcontracted work (and pay many subs according reports). like running big corporation like Microsoft Berkshire Hathaway stockholders board answer to.  Exactly. wish one though possibility. good thing anyway. shut Hawaii right now, example? redditors want reaction ""federal""? polls run contrary everything feel: Nobody ever asked me

P.S. people want national mask mandates understand Federalism USA, change mind doctors note statutory exception PM moron, forced events Again, wrongly assume vaccine fixes everything must materialize record time simply want to.

I suppose must Tooth Fairy Easter Bunny really anxious believe must exist.  Hope trumps reality.

Accept real possibilities either vaccine anytime soon else vaccine unable accomplish much.  bet everything long shot. better part what, 6 months so, refusing wear one openly doubting efficacy? Unfortunately guess people would blindly follow Trump's cue medical advice (if actually gone promote mask use event) already injected bleach point. Well, UK, Brazil, Argentina Sweden female leaders bast could long February. could Christmas. always ""could be"". 

i'll still keep upvoting pieces tho bc need hear shit. times rough right now. almost made breath without talking POTUS, good job!! Keep it. pandemic endeded?! freedoms? /s experts conservative. annoying people get that. want info. death rates dropping dramatically people! ""intense"" shutdown would cause death economic damage virus. Well...yeah? I'm talking *been*. I'm responding guy says people *will* make money.

Again, reddit thing say, lot people will. You‚Äôre downvoted stating fact, easily verified Redditors people, general, pathetic insecure they‚Äôll downvote facts might ruin narrative. Start tattooing ‚ÄúStupid‚Äù foreheads would cause food riots. Shutting Interstate Highway System would cause massive shortage across country. Medicines, food, fuel. Heating oil winter.

Epidemiologists recommend sort thing idea economy works. They'll another headline tomorrow

""Covid-19 vaccine likely available February: Experts"" Yeah next step wear masks forever Edited fixed ‚Äî thanks pointing out! odds catching covid you‚Äôre crowded store people mask? Shoot ass good stuff! Looking increasingly like we‚Äôve got ADE though. sure much matter variant SARS-CoV-2 emerged early summer 2020, presumably Spain, since spread multiple European countries. variant first observed Spain June frequencies 40% since July. Outside Spain, frequency variant increased low values prior 15th July 40-70% Switzerland, Ireland, United Kingdom September. also prevalent Norway, Latvia, Netherlands, France. Little said European countries recent sequences available. Sequences cluster (20A.EU1) differ ancestral sequences 6 positions, including mutation A222V spike protein A220V nucleoprotein. show variant exported Spain European countries multiple times much diversity cluster Spain observed across Europe. currently unclear whether variant spreading transmission advantage virus whether high incidence Spain followed dissemination tourists sufficient explain rapid rise multiple countries.  Per capita always BS terms virus, people tell anything make feel better situation. small country Europe higher rate deaths US means Americans US still great job. ignore small part country similar size state New York rates much higher worse European countries. look per capita US actually caught Europe deaths cases long time ago. fact behind give insight US advantage Europe initial stages getting outbreaks later thus time prepare. However saying fact Europe seen new wave shows done terrible job too. thing even places like US better smaller nations, US still absolutely appalling job dealing it. would settled coherent national strategy. downvoted? He‚Äôs kinda right, take years upon years eliminate virus via vaccine induced herd immunity. got find another way return normal live it. Wearing mask room air refreshed pointless. viral load accumulate slower. surgeon, anti vax. Yesterday talking main internist hospital asked felt vaccine. said would take long term studies performed, agreed sentiment. whole process sketchy rushed.

&amp;#x200B;

I think 30% refusing wishful thinking. administration politicized virus created much doubt, mistrust, misinformation. would hold anyone refused based education degree.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: much rushing vaccine. Money, politics, etc. congress faced requiring vegetables lunches students add vegetables? made pizza considered serving vegetables. dont trust it. might want remove # sign everything it. bring comment section default. This.

Most people one, way less half wear covering nose mouth, keep on.

Shits going end changes. pretty sure wildly different definition ""unreasonable"". mention today changed would make county go purple. might actually able hit number weekly cases would enable herd immunity! need million week next year year half there! Never mind tens millions die. schrodinger‚Äôs antibodies. I‚Äùm hospital nurse given surgical mask work. I‚Äôm saying prisoners shouldn‚Äôt get them, chiming public know aren‚Äôt given masks.

Also currently unclear whether variant affects disease severity. Definitely something pay attention though research conducted. [El Paso gone back lockdown thier hospitals reached 100% great news - long take account seriously ill covid patients still need hospital beds icu's. keep infection rates (as places like El Paso), death rates go back - covid itself, beds equipment available treat cases coming in. issues.

Viruses ""weaken"" selective pressure created people fall ill stay home, limiting exposure. diseases contagious symptoms appear, means extremely virulent ones (like Ebola) short window spread, especially everyone dies right away.

With SARS-COV-2, lag days symptoms show up, really debilitating symptoms take even longer. meantime, sick person about, spreading virus everyone meet. There's selective pressure mutate less virulent version current one well. Yeah true don‚Äôt think people understand virus doesn‚Äôt kill you, it‚Äôs immune system‚Äôs response actually does.

It's beginning second wave. Florida Arizona lagged behind states terms first waves. coincidence increasing time first waves time. positivity rate keeps falling.

Increasing... monitors CLI weekly already showing second wave (an extremely good indicator virus).

That's ridiculous thing say ever. First off, low. Second off, good indicator virus. collect data hospitals, limited urgent care access, data variable day day. small second wave like 70% last 2 months.

Look, right gamble health right ruin someone else's life. ppe gear answer. Thanks false actually stable, highly conserved. There's two big reasons specifically targeted: A.) antibodies stimulates ""neutralizing"", rather serve slow virus rather stop completely. B.) neuraminidase relatively fragile mostly destroyed inactivation process vaccine made. would change process produce flu vaccine, would need great deal research investment would need pass approval process new vaccine would need prove worthwhile manufacturers update production facilities new manufacturing process. 


In US, flu vaccine production capability actually real bright spot capabilities deal pandemics. deliberately invest infrastructure rapidly deploy vaccine novel pandemic influenza virus way country (unfortunately vastly prepared pandemic coronavirus)

However, production capability massive even we've found modern vaccines use egg free process offer slew advantages plans egg free production capacity expanded old egg-based process phases out, change modern cell cultured(MDCK cell line) recombinant vaccines (which made using fall army worm cell line) seeing incremental progress replacing old fashioned flu vaccines use eggs produce vaccine virus. U.S. government, BARDA particular, placed good deal investment speeding changeover new vaccine technology well.

It's still slow requires large cash investments.

On note, yes I've strongly felt process found ensure actually stimulate neuraminidase antibodies well. help bridge gap years chosen vaccine virus hemagluttinin good match flu viruses actually circulating, especially H3N2, experiences antigenic drift extremely rapid pace.

That bit tangent, sorry wall text. subject interested great deal pre-pandemic, actually fascinating see rise novel coronavirus interacted US's viral surveillance data watching closely every year years now. Didn‚Äôt trump leave state leaders? pence bring sweeping national lockdown? bend pick something you‚Äôve dropped. think physically socializing outside household couple months permanently damage them?

What happened? 

I understand China might better job getting people wear masks America, since require much technology. mass testing requires trained personnel, testing equipment, chemicals, logistics, etc., stuff developed countries supposed good at, developing countries like China suppose poor backward afford.

That's...that's fucking pandemic works. 

Lockdowns literally delay inevitable. Nice bro, really showed strawman No, they've always stupid.  Serious answer: people clinical narcissism absolutely say things truth objectively true, even fully conceptualizing lie.

My mom narcissist say stuff, complete sincerity, like ""I never broken bone!"" despite fallen year prior broken wrists. weird mind, clumsy person ""bad bones"" would fall break them, clumsy person fragile old lady bones... naturally, possibly fallen injured *because that's kind person is*, simply says never happened her.

Rewriting history reality around suit narcissistic state something naturally breathing. Governments run money soon. don‚Äôt get vaccine next year? 2021 worse year. least us still money. Doubtful. Unless nationwide Wuhan-style complete lockdown, can't rid country COVID. widespread, simply can't get rid all.

Lockdowns reduce mortality. allow elimination virus unless catch *very* early small population (e.g. New Zealand). Even strict lockdowns prolonged periods places cases (e.g. Victoria Australia), eliminate virus. Australia continue strict restrictions months months.

Lockdowns buy time. buy time treatments. buy time vaccines (if even get time prevent many infections, well may not). buy time setup testing programs. However, prevent pandemic taking course. Diseases spread. That's do. One way another, become something lockdown enough people immune. Whether happens vaccines otherwise depends vaccines come long hold this.

However, point stands, lockdowns eliminate need lockdowns. sustain need lockdowns. makes worthwhile whether get game-changing intervention play open again.

Imagine 20% kids stayed home 80% went there. ensure 20% get education? would miss whole month? would probably legal courts would take apart.

Another problem would tension families parents decide letting children stay home sending to. 

Children teens also far, far unlikely serious symptoms, makes acceptable send school.

You also see health children, physically mentally, also endangered (and fact suffered first lockdown) make stay indoors dont let meet children month. cares fucking everyone over

So movie villain who's goal evil? Right. Yea. Almost poetic Everyone walks around smartphone.

Is quality testing really good there? Long Island getting hit hard initially actually really well. Kind baffling. Huh. Last heard ordered shit ton vaccines, like 5 every citizen.

I‚Äôll reply you‚Äôre sending reiterate literally irrelevant. You‚Äôre sending sources opinion, you‚Äôre sending sources irrelevant information support opinion. depending arguing saying disagree may relevant simply entire point revolves around opinion fact, things objective. Especially since head debate seems definition failiure, never objectively determined.

Wrong. point discussion goal everything done relation Corona prevent deaths. It‚Äôs simply not. (Sent last comment, showing economy survived relatively unharmed)

And replied economic damage Norway one tenth deaths massive, massive failure. Supported expert opinion sent you. (also sent one previously, showing total capacity ICU beds never reached)

Irrelevant. Total capacity reached precursor healthcare breakdown **which would lead deaths**. Preventing deaths goal, extra ICU beds, Sweden failed preventing deaths. Supported expert opinion sent you. (This one sent me, rather supports point view points main goal protection hospitals, knoe read first lines)

Once again, says prevention healthcare collapse main goal, order prevent deaths. also **literally says Sweden Norway directly comparable, difference outcome due different strategies employed**. supports point 100% Sweden done Norway did, thousands deaths could prevented. **You‚Äôve never replied point**. said, let's take FHM's reasoning. giving two shits saying. They‚Äôve dishonest throughout entire process. example suddenly claiming long time, herd immunity actually goal theirs, even though clearly communicated before. I‚Äôm sure international source less invested FHM found demonstrates whatever point want make. consider whatever want win lose

Not point contention. Prevention deaths. never reply sources

I‚Äôve replied before. solid main argument

Said many times, prevention deaths (in relation economic damage want providing sources replying you

You haven‚Äôt provided sources relevant part argument. Relevant parts would 
- Sweden Norway actually comparable 
- outcome Sweden would different Sweden did
- doesn‚Äôt matter Sweden ten times per capita deaths Norway, since healthcare system wasn‚Äôt overwhelmed 
Just name few. reply direct questions 

I‚Äôve replied every single question. You‚Äôre one skips arguments sources. go low insult intelligence even ethnicity

I‚Äôm insulting intelligence it‚Äôs clear you‚Äôre trying hardest defend Sweden, actually think issue. **Ten times deaths, economic damage, experts agree outcome due different strategies**. don‚Äôt anything side answers either three parts argument. Still wanna act like you‚Äôre obviously right? Yeah I‚Äôm gonna insult you. way man! official white house person says covid-19 over!!!!

I would love use software Cases per 100,000 last 7 days   
Not good.   incorrect. 

For study, comparing NY hospitals getting overrun NY hospitals getting overrun. 

It's garbage study, difference probably even due treatments therapeutics like comment saying. Correct honor system. Passengers explicitly allowed this. Presumably people pending results end negative.

There disadvantages using systems well: test presumably taken shortly boarding, good thing. Hawaii simply requires test within 72 hours final leg flight. means someone could three days getting tested get sick, would go unnoticed.

On top that, much worse passenger travelled all--they required stay hotel room (at expense) two weeks. effectively cost $2000-$4000 get vacation.  suspected even might sick, would crazy get one flights. Plus easier drive stock price putting multiple press releases close vaccine. policy work. requiring testing, requiring proof negative result boarding, infected person exposes whole plane full passengers flight crew. Thats dozens upon dozens potentially infected people avoid inconvenience showing test result first.

I‚Äôm certainly complaining extra space light flights either. think I‚Äôd rather shot stabbed 27 times Australia seem finally squashed second wave. advantages (isolated low population density) still different state federal politicians arguing best practice.

Lockdown work people. US tried avoid full lockdown economy still fucked. Lockdown squash shit function properly However even paying ransom there's guarantee files unlocked usable state. mystery COVID-19 transmitted. mystery society people never go church harmed churches disregard health safety others. mystery churches asked exemptions COVID-19 restrictions, letting pandemic spread seems impossible stop. done others done: contain outbreak, ""flatten curve"" letting spread. mean internal data super spreading events movie theaters? fine hosts!! bill couple grand start marriage infecting people deadly virus way go. Till death us part, honey. Please stop. Love idea, hate it‚Äôs needed. 

Thanks inspiration Exactly. idea lockdown, get minimal number cases, come full mitigation measures place - mask mandates, social distancing, testing contact tracing, along continuing restrictions on/closures high-risk businesses bars keep cases rising again. 

The shutdowns absolutely job; government people failed jobs shutdowns lifted. I'm sorry. really sucks. great depression gona look like bad weekend greatest depression upon us. What‚Äôs stopping you? Symptoms wise? That's... true. pandemic worse swing states since everything politicized. Dude agriculture severely disrupted due fires, floods, plagues. you. pandemic worse swing states since everything politicized. tired alopecia universalis, always wondered something like triggered it. cases deadly? 99% recovery, carry one....i struggle math sometimes, many people exactly think live world? CRE fucked.   many walking away leases saying basically sue us. serious question: if, worst case scenario, *could* reinfected every 2-3 months, would perhaps ok get re-vaccinated every like, 3-4 months?

my understanding may result full immune response T/B cells running, it'd sort keep primed covid?

can someone smarter (v low bar) help one?

because I'm 110% get **vaxxed frick up** every 3-4 months keeps immune system condition fight covid get back shit also infect someone else. Michigan Ah true Bingo. Hoovertowns slowly creeping across major cities nationwide. infections coming from? Hoarding again? things really ran TP sanitizer, came back fast enough. everyone hoarding food? built buffer keep extra home cooking kept up, people bad planning groceries? BTW good time buy extra 5lb flour (unbleached) sourdough starter, yeast went quick first time around. doesn‚Äôt work, people start thinking possibility endemic take calculated risks covid many viruses.  shitpost  Ok yeah coup resulting rebellion you‚Äôre absolutely right Antibody tests aren‚Äôt used detecting active infections. useful detecting antibodies previous infection. 45,000 hospitalized 78,000 cases? odds dont look good. data looks like almost 50% patients OCT hospitalized? Please tell I'm reading wrong. think way reposted deaths.  anything suspected went Covid whereas places like US deaths reported Covid deaths instead pneumonia illnesses. think trying get data right beginning made look worse. I‚Äôm still gonna live using bleach

just please sip  Careful, people get pretty worked mention reinfection. would explain math virus many times deadly flu, math might understood you. Source?  No. lessens chance will. May stupid question mask mandate? Masks work, data back up. 

I know lockdowns beginning crisis, 1. Everyone low PPE 2. People weren‚Äôt board mask-wearing 3. didn‚Äôt know enough virus whether masks work But... but... Trump didn‚Äôt shut travel China would million instead...!

Sickening people buy load horse shit. site uses different cut time. get 5k missing one state point worry France, go away upcoming American election, coworkers saying. Sure, liars. Yeah imagine didn‚Äôt travel cars...it would perfect storm. It‚Äôs still shit show think USA Canada Australia one benefit low density living.

Picking nose pumping gas..normal stuff. Never going happen, lets say ""true"" grocery stories (ie whole foods, aldi, trader joes, etc mega-stores like walmart/target/etc) allowed open, well still need trucks bringing food logistics companies, truck stops, fuel stations need open, also need diesel mechanics, tire shops, hardware stores things like tie downs, straps, motor oil, ramps, cargo nets, casters, pallet jacks, etc. need maintenance done equipment HVAC techs, electricians, welders back work. cleaning crew needs mops, brooms, cleaning agents, alcohol wipes, hand sanitizer, degreasers, walmart target get open anyways. deli seafood departments run gloves, plastic bagging, hair nets, etc like nothing else manufacturers need open back manufacturers also 20 different suppliers raw goods, equipment, transport, storage, certification need open to.... 

I pretty disappointed first round lockdowns 80% businesses deemed ""essential"", one second believe many really essential, would shocked could reach 50% lockdown rate without greatly impacting grocery stores, hospitals, pharmacies. going really dark christmas year lot places. Finding reactive t-cells equate protective immunity. Reactive t-cells also exist viruses without confering protective immunity (f.e. Hep C) job make policy push congress president resources needed implement it.

No. He‚Äôs advisor. doesn‚Äôt dictate policy. LA? deaths open Sweden population size written living. Fake News. know dying, cowards? like ones come back cowards. Yet United States still leads way way half million new cases record setting day. US also leads deaths today large margin, double next closest. Seems pretty silly going restaurants right now. description makes sound even sillier. sitting table taking mask putting back repeatedly? order take God's sake.  kids? Get kn95 masks use fresh one day ($1.50 day) Forgot /s . mistake co-worker told Hamilton may go purple staired confusion least minute thinking thing head Without either financial support (congress doesn‚Äôt appear board), rigid military enforcement (will need accept likelihood shootouts number armed civilians), I‚Äôve sincere doubts full-on lockdown implemented adhered United States. jobs teleworkable. even among are, many employers simply willing make possible. parents space equipment either. bit shitshow. Worked company handful years ago got hit. came grinding halt. CEO waited week caved, much remember thinking, time paid already lost ransom lost sales profits. 

These people want hit US vulnerable, know want cause maximum panic harm. money added bonus.  Lack care things. huge increase DOA 911 calls outtake put going chest pain, one example. image head Trump setting fire giant mound AOL NetZero CDs. accommodate parents. definitely safer. This, except (and never were) talking country wide shortages local shortages.

There food deserts U.S. ***without*** pandemic; fuck JIT delivery toss thousand panicked people, small town get rocked. Bad enough outbreak city could less prepared scrounging.

Starving likely issue, sure, somewhat balanced diet could impacted. Comfort foods could gone. Easy foods lethargic, gone.

Hoarding smart call, good idea surplus non-perishables. Whats worst happens? grocery bill dampened next 6 months buy little less every week eat surplus? Bullshit fucking title. 2 ""unknown sources"" investigated past positive cases trying determine past inactive virus shedding. mislead people like this. Can't wait. like daylight actually helpful, morning.  image article old too.... almost every county RED. Neither safer. Ideally everyone stay fuck home, people go work, many families means kids need go school.

So concessions. Compromises. message remains same: work home, should. kids stay home, probably too.

No, fun. households it. get it. kids going bring home virus parents people going blame government it, that's sure. then, pay another 7 10 billion.

Its like germany poor so.
I would concerned countries cant ""afford"" that. Wait learn whitehouse.org associated US gov either.

/90s teens understand joke. shocking people believed .orgs actually affiliated org. NSFW was. 1 dose milliliter that's 75 milk jugs full medicine. probably use minivan drop off, need rent truck. Thank totally fine. know numbers October ""national protest"" people September 1500 protesters... Holy shit. Virus aside, absolutely scare anyone insane me. need piece paper leave house? whole Covid experience control. 

If rationalize irrational action, people fall line, let's know effective.

Edit: everyone going eager get vaccine, able return way life, regardless consequences. Makes think. ??? state 7,500,000 people would beg disagree. hell live? That's exact right wing supporters say coronavirus Brazil, hospitals make money faking deaths coronavirus get money. anyone wondering, article referring [state‚Äôs color-coded COVID response first saw title thought talking going purple *electorally* lol.

Purple highest level means ‚Äúuncontrolled spread exposure‚Äù stay-at-home orders needed. (Edit - also, [Hamilton Cincinnati 800k population) impressive. test isolate every case, end spread. article misleading. There's increase substance abuse overdoses, there's data support suicides. Check CDC website, there's data suicides past 2018. We've un upward trend since 1999. concerns, valid ones. article straight readers. Yeah, correlation causation. People get flu shot likely conscious health ways, including eating properly exercising (thus limiting potentially exacerbating comorbidities) wearing mask. Life fair lesson everyone learns they're 6. can't both? I‚Äôm going fucking kill employed people taking financial impact seriously contributing fighting us? mean think first message pretty clear even tho played lip service pro restriction people maybe aware, fact it‚Äôs ‚Äúgreat stress‚Äù it‚Äôs causing us actually impacted, it‚Äôs financial fucking ruin? ‚Äúproperly valued‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt saying dumb shit. lost job, business, savings, home. promise ‚Äî ‚Äúproperly valued‚Äù employed pro mask people would falling fight us instead sitting Reddit saying they‚Äôre aware it‚Äôs stress.

Acknowledging there‚Äôs problem doesn‚Äôt mean shit immediately erase downplay it. Double standard exactly? Maybe smoking cannabis? lock people lives? think ""Why would lock work last time?"" sort pithy, internally consistent sounding thing say. 

Weirdly gave friend ride home said exact thing me. stupid person all. much patient polite friend person wrote comment üò¨ profit reduced 17%? entire point extreme response pandemic hinges 70+ age bracket. That‚Äôs see higher fatality rates 1%.

If entire population .003 (0-19 age) .02(20-49) fatality rates would ‚Äúlockdowns‚Äù least hope not. 

The elderly literally backbone reason containment efforts. justify cost alone hurt cure disease, entire premise unprecedented Covid-19 measures unethical illogical.

It‚Äôs clear going convince other. appreciate comments debate. Others read though see different viewpoints. Says who? /r/coronavirus? fever, body aches, congestion bit cough. Symptoms went away two three days. us Quarantining healthy people risk virus doesn‚Äôt anything ends entire society people (mainly working class people) aren‚Äôt risk virus stay locked houses deal negative effects lockdown hurt families COVID ever would.

Except clearly wrong hospitals filling world COVID hits hard.

There magical silver bullet this, we've known months. Time face reality. Don‚Äôt worry. moment Biden sworn in, COVID immediately become catastrophe he‚Äôs failing prevent. Correct.

Because see this, act like won‚Äôt happen here. like country club themselves. country club people coming looking venue, event. 

Slap fine newly wedded couple. parents wedding planner. Whoever said, ""Hey, let's large wedding pandemic!"" 

Imagine anniversary every year. ""Gosh, nearly ten years since Aunt Hattie, Uncle Fred, Aunt Mary, Aunt Barbara, Grandpa died."" cabinet's shit debunks claim....literally. 

Trump's lying sack. He's throwing tantrum many people pointed mismanaged pandemic. really wanted dive deep minds see logic behind everything less clear. hear years, flu caused deaths covid, course see logic behind everything happening around world. say exist, know they'll higher chance contracting virus, feel like everything unnecessary. course fiction comes along it, think governments use methods take nation control train ""future"". course, understand fact reason healthcare system fall apart. better madder people get. Says president vaccines profits

all profits? what's side hosting it? Hard say, might loosen things get top virus. think tougher rules place Jan Feb. Must've long night owners club They‚Äôre *American* lockdown lol Florida would like word, Arizona too, Texas. trackers include country, probably track total deaths make numbers public. Yet California New York big chllin lesser rates virus. Like every country Earth, China's lying numbers. 

(And no, virus Chinese Trumpie.) Destroy facebook. Sorry say, father fucking idiot.  Absolutely right. might serve multi-purpose staple household time period however. Well judged wrong. I‚Äôm gen X, dont live Boulder think need another round shut downs control shit. able-ist word? You‚Äôre funny. Think you‚Äôve got figured out. Actually aren't, significant variations across France. doesn‚Äôt get decide feel. Thank though.  know. feel like might make much difference. eliminated smallpox different species virus cowpox.

Mask mandates don‚Äôt help people parties! r/wowthanksimcured/ guys love live spread fear sub lol forgetting delivery people get food upper middle class folks castles. least race relations improved though Wyckoff Hospital Brooklyn got hit today.  trying survive lose anyone love.

Yep. France either. Comparing high population dense city like LA entire country like Sweden good comparison. Comparing LA Stockholm Sweden California would accurate. really Sweden compared similar nordic countries do, strategy seem hold up. September 28 homes without shared common lobby. Detached homes townhouse prices spiking Toronto, small condos dropping. one wants wear mask lobby share elevator strangers. ""But photos party got 4012 likes IG worth it"" 

SO MESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSED UP!!!! military EVER function without 

In seriousness though hope gets better soon new york outside city pretty much backwater mention it, going model, ventilation alone decrease risk infection quite bit. Also outdoor transmission less likely happen. 19 infected cases, 8 US. 5 8 Korean citizens. Korea still allowing Americans fly in? banning Americans entering country? makes difference. pretty much equally infected. closing creates lot problems. Influenza mutates 100 times faster corona, dozens strains circulating humans waterfowl constantly recombining new strains. vaccines low efficacy. Coronavirus similar respiratory viruses like smallpox measles constant exposure animal reservoirs. worry -- still Halloween, November 3, Thanksgiving, Christmas go. Something troubling seen history Federal Funds Rate since 1980. entered successive recession lower rate previous one. We're point stimulus -- can't really lower rates (though Trump yelling negative rates) can't anything fiscal policy, likely current recession going hard landing, recovery take much longer last one. gonna pretty. handful states locked down. months going grocery stores walking thing allowed do. Well know anecdotes arent great scientific evidence, people wear masks NY. 1.1% positivity rate. Places reluctance mask wearing much higher numbers. corporate overlords political puppets would never allow thing. ChInA viRuS 

/s would require intelligence life money.

I guess we‚Äôre looking 2 8 million deaths....? interestingly enough entirely skipped flu season Aus - literally one died it. Like - one.

Social distancing win! :D Lol dude quit citing guy developed vaccine disease nowhere near contagiousness covid, generally disease ridiculously different general get carried away now, that's dangerous. Germany France functioning, cases per capita (the United States) do? End 2021 = 2022 = 2 years = years

Thanks Media. multiple Americans died COVID reading article, another died time took type short comment. nearly 1000 *still* dying every day. American testing positive every 1.2 seconds.

It difficult human mind fully comprehend that. sure guy talking about, take genius realize wearing mask would decrease amount droplets exhaled. It‚Äôs completely relevant. someone advocates changing system another person points alternate isn‚Äôt better. That‚Äôs relevant. really blame people. I'm stocked mask, canned food full freezer. Cause gets real bad, shortages. didn‚Äôt get planet time :( economy also sucks Yeah work trip last weekend relatively small town. Went bars packed even small house party. 

Stopped caring ago. Look front page dude, post It‚Äôs scary think we‚Äôd without mask mandates. smart leader would force companies make drug. Give profit Regeneron, government invest manufacturing. one best therapeutics not? suspect mask-wearing compliance particularly good, even 10 counties accepted requirement.  state people want wear masks, fraction people counties, would want wear masks.  large faction, anybodies guess, subject future research.  see mention compliance measurement article. 

Still good news. And, may convince Kansas legislature make mandate, mandatory. Nope. would require...
Enough tests.
People run testing.
Other people cooperate get tested.
Positive people quarantine.
Contact tracing.
Quarantining known links.

We could 2 maybe 2 things See guys tomorrow can‚Äôt simply let entire population get sick

Are supposed stay locked virus goes away? long expect people stay inside homes stay social isolation? virus isn‚Äôt going away anytime soon we‚Äôve already fucked extraordinary extent lockdowns caused damage country, irreparable others haunt entire next generation. wait vaccine get rid virus? rushed vaccine that‚Äôs likely negative effects? There‚Äôs even guarantee develop vaccine COVID-19. matter what, we‚Äôre gonna learn live can‚Äôt keep ourselves. Kids need go schools, elderly need see family, people need social interaction that‚Äôs shitty laggy zoom app. Also, hospitals reaching max capacity isn‚Äôt new thing COVID, happens frequently we‚Äôd like believe talked helps narrative like lockdown. never late start rejected

Pelosi isnt rejecting anything, pelosi passed bill 

Its republicans want give less relief money refuse vote senate want give less Depression coming soon half-ass it. going go restaurant, silly it. Take mask table enjoy meal. Pretty sure whitehouse.com either way lot fun research paper government stuff. That‚Äôs M.O. entire life. Gaslighting people around him. keep repeating lie either people believe cronies make true. anyone know get tested without parents 18?  hospitals attacked Cold coronavirus infects children, indicating long lasting immunity adults. Bad. real bad September next year. ""Judgy"" word. ""Judgmental"" is. yes, I'm judgmental whiny Zoomers, Millennials, Boomers give fuck common sense. 

Quit whining med cards. fight pharmacists regularly basic shit, I'm actually immunocompromised. show DOCUMENTATION school work receive basic accommodations. That's law. pandemic, can't assed get proper documentation follow ADA like rest us, fuck off. 

But hey, ""judgmental"" people a-okay they're ableist like :)  Time educate childfen drugs Imagine go 40% 50%, Achilles heel democracy may need find better way govern happens, might soon given much age misinformation internet Facebook brought upon us making people dumber. AI ruler earth would suggestion try humans proven incapable self rule type. shit Get well soon! We're rounding corner. April weather get warmer gone, like magic, therapeutically - would say ""cure"" - over. over. 200 million people would dead. Biden would killed 3 Billion people. would trusted ""scientists"" - please give break! money. say: ""Mr president, sir, please give us money research!"". say ""NO"" clue they're doing. SAD! 100 years, still cure cancer! scientist - MANY told ""sir! natural"" - would cured cancer China virus would chance. CHANCE! ikr, idk whats treating like slut. seriously give doctor blowjob cause im stupid cure covid.

im job helping yo annoying ass Maybe reason consumer spending 23m people jobs... forget April June anything grocery store, hardware store, pharmacy takeout restaurant deemed non essential? know successful restaurants make maybe 10% profit couple places, restaurants 50% capacity bleeding money? definitely get tested Watched video this. Even loses electoral popular votr still become president refuses concede likely since countless events playing dirty without regard others

Basically win number states vote him. state counts one point. 

Imagine president majority want becomes president. would happen then? knows he's lying. also knows whatever tells supporters reality them. suspect Covid office says can't come back come back negative test screening, would go going nearest clinic range walking? car know Uber Lyft safety guidelines can't find information I'm allowed vehicle go clinic. Federal government gives grants make vaccine... federal government buys vaccine....

There vaccines developed countries well. happens Russian vaccine approved? US government give grants Russian vaccine development? certainly easier never real work. 1 billion votes. 

Can come America replace surgeon General? right though. Europe right far worse double cases per capita US. 


New Cases per day: 
US: 70,000+ Cases/day (325million population) 
France: 35,000+ Cases/day (66.99million population) 
UK: 20,000+ Cases/day (66.44million population) 
Spain: 18,000+ Cases/day (44million population)

Testing: 
US: 375tests per 100k (over past 2 months atleast) 
France: 350tests per 100k (only started hitting testing rate) 
UK: 300tests per 100k

Europe far worse right anything we've yet seen US. rate spread France, would seeing almost 200,000 cases day US. Testing US highest too, factor. i'm position, planning see partner Massachusetts thanksgiving, i'm New York Cuomo discouraged travel two states. seen since lockdown hit March. l totally know feeling. 

if helps hear all, things start looking sometime early 2021, we're definitely ""7th 8th inning"" acute pandemic phase, getting there. guys appreciate much finally reunite. 

it truly sucks donkey balls get this. would legit lose shit got sympathy card government point hurd immunity gonna become solution.. Like prison population per capita, guys dominating. Freedom. get worse. Gonna hit 100k cases day soon. Deaths may go 2k day. 40% country least care, wont even put masks Best cold. also good happened party rather after. Covids space. Covids spaaaace! It‚Äôs early know happen long term, positive negative. Resolved cases could stay resolved, resurgence longer-term problems dealt previously, present yet unknown complications future. We‚Äôre stuck waiting order get kind longitudinal data necessary say much anything certainty. I'm complaining language, feel like learning new language all, matter language is. Also election day. MURICA! Thanks. Glad see go waste. much astroturfing anti-mask sentiment Germany summer? One troll paid dark money sitting (say) Lithuania, running 500 Facebook / BILD comments-section / etc accounts, whispering repeatedly ear susceptible people move anti-mask? 

Refer per capita basis, infection death rates near bottom compared nations. It‚Äôs travesty, especially given wealth, resources, scientific expertise. taxes still percentage, fixed amount, right? policy worse thing happen schooling I've ever seen. weird seems like lefty type thing right ""help everyone pass"" anti capitalist smart progress, man made Americans fall fucking far behind make soo difficult actually progress excel. One great ironies times parties wrong side. Democrats‚Äô natural role implement plan manage problem explaining people things aren‚Äôt bad seem pull together. 

And Republicans natural role overreact terror complain left killing Grandma. 

The reason everyone feels uncomfortable we‚Äôre playing wrong role. Lockdowns include essential services, point essential services hindered shut downs right incorrect. Food production decreased, shelves stocked, deliveries made. 

Our first lockdown happened didn‚Äôt know happening going spread. places entered phased reopening measure success. numbers gauged level reopening openings followed. problem, hard lockdowns continued. time, localized lockdowns tied ICU capacity. area, pretty standard county, level normalcy resumed. saw friends, went outdoor restaurants, basically lived conservative version regular life (no bars, less indoor activities).

However, point knowing going going happen again. past 3 weeks, sharp staggering increase cases worldwide. evaluation spread increasing much (is humans indoors? weather? both?) reopen carefully current conditions necessary. hard lockdown necessary needs full stop evaluation. would rather eat dumb lamps.

Positive Ions? That's works. need high voltage make free ions. Extremely high, kV range. Unless telling lamps voltage multiplier ladders, they're pink static. absolutely shocked this. amount people bars, masks worn, blind faith god, could anyone see coming? I‚Äôll also point staunch Democrat actually considering voting Dewine balls listen science health experts etc. guy won‚Äôt even job....... France: Adults, work home now. dangerous there.

Also France: Kids, go school parents work home.

Dude, what? Everyone put list - buy pink Himalayan salt lamp help combat negativity natural positive ions (which ha - actually negative ions. positive. Like feel rainstorm also beeswax omits). maybe go ahead make pre game plan happy feel good song list listen blue. make plan feel despair. Write list get funky feelings. Morning always comes. It‚Äôs hard sometimes remember night feels dark. Especially now. gonna wipe frozen roll TP.
Baby wipes fridge win. bump felt Titanic cruise probably nothing. ship unsinkable, all. Since July there's one two days week deaths 1000, seven day average hovering around 700. really scary people believe it

At point, think believe it, collectively hating country want burn guise ignorantly believing it. True, hard borders really option EU suppose. Can‚Äôt find paper towel canned dog food lately ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è last line press release though... Dollar cost average Big mistake. kids die rate older people upon exposure. So, better they're mingling bring home kill adults there. ""So, really talking year year half even know something from.march 2020 regarding vaccine. developments made since speed process.

Oh boy downvoting document quote. Yeesh. probably didnt realize, narrative become one dominant narratives pushed COVID deniers reason reopen. ""Learn live it"", et all. Scenarios:

* Landslide Biden
* Landslide Trump
* Close call Biden
* Close call Trump
* Unknown goes SCOTUS
* Popular vote goes one Electoral College members vote opposite district voted

Any result give us uncertainty already uncertain contentious times. We're fucking powder keg right now. We're going lot mental breaks future. Happened month ago Nebraska based system false lie, exact opposite ended, highest ever been. Well yeah that's idea. realistically done. Europe much interconnectedness far gone NZ style thing. Lots people claiming re-infection subs. 3 months seems reliable immunity window. guy spices &lt;laughs least investigating Bellone said venue wedding held, North Fork Country Club Cutchogue, would fined $17,000. Ninety-one people attended wedding, Oct. 17, officials said. Thirty people, including 27 guests, two employees outside vendor, later tested positive virus, 156 people wound quarantine, officials said. Yep - even mental health perspective costly. hate politicians people point mental health reason impose preventative measures. 

Maybe country could tackle pandemic, economic people's mental health could recover? Instead letting pandemic rage semi-uncontrolled several months (and likely year based vaccine projections) Actually case - Roche manufacturing worlds largest biotech facility produce they‚Äôre saying they‚Äôve already done easier trace. someone busts names correlate. vaccine widely distributed, pandemic restrictions certain percentage gets vaccine. bet ass going shit load people rushing get vaccine SOON available. 

By refusing vaccine, agreeing putting life risk. Sports get fans back full capacity businesses longer restrictions. Life back pre-covid normalcy holidays next year. is... exactly happen, isn‚Äôt it? course work work sometimes dangerous,eating next person working may end world talk going restaurants **unnecessarily** risking 

I'm saying stop working, stop going restaurants. That's makes situation silly  conclusions arise wondering? interactions people limited. far, I've figured wife's family gets news right wing stuff Facebook. took moment look anything up, they'd realize repeated proven false. Nebraska online school setup even option. drove school heading cancer center Lincoln, saw kids 0 masks. among wear mask people scoff us. 

We services include news channels. I've come question anything TV looking relevant important try get truth. 

It seems fox/right wing sites, rumors/lies word mouth 

However. Across reddit met cool people Nebraska. Seems like Lincoln bit level headed part. area I'm (south east) kinda bad. I've heard n word dropped times last month. I'm skinny dude fight way wet paper bag. stand up/stop bullshit would lying said scared crazy ending life it. Learning countries? Nah dont üôÑüò´ virus mystery, know handful families one person got household, shared bed spouse, tucked kids in, took family road trips car 7 hours, contagious. It‚Äôs insane! still time wear masks, keep social distancing wash hands... :) know Im gonna get bashed someone, wearing 2 masks last month. soon confirmed work doubled many couldnt bothered wear masks correctly even though required. avoid everyone, still havent gone breakroom, take breaks outside wipe hands clorox wipes take masks off. Im hoping 6 layers give protection. also catch it, Id hate knowing gave someone else.  Really makes wonder see someone without one selfishness ignorance. Maybe Im wrong, Im expert, listen expert. fence says electric......Im gonna believe is. Also seen one fence talk doesnt like Bob. Uh....that's....not works. really wish internationals would stop commenting American system like they're experts. Even SCOTUS hear case, they'll go whatever determined electoral college. Cf. 2000 Elections confused. Yeah. Long pork Christmas year. Nailed it! Governors closing stuff US hospitals overflow. seems measure respected here. Trump ""rounding corner"" schtick. Skilled trades also demand. Toronto always needs bricklayers carpenters, decades-long building boom that's predicted collapse every year, never does. (Average price detached house $1.2 million. Million-dollar teardowns common.) bails democrat led cities already struggling financially pandemic due mismanagement

This false far right missinformation misscharacterization relief states

Your wording betrays partisan illegal aliens.

Also completely false


You lie much president dude reason housing bubble popped 2008-09 incorrect. upvoted it. think people downvoted without reading they're sick reopening disinformation getting pushed right now. wonder likely would get covid using toilet right someone covid positive used it. stall beside time. know Winston Churchill used famously stand top buildings, *they bombing buildings!* used stand buildings tell people, ""the war over!"" would say. Yes, used that, ""we won! war over!"". know say that's killed Hitler. black widows. serve us better (including yourself) shut fuck up. They're far densely populated. red areas map bumfucksville, lot would ""winning"" far. science warn us COVID. Yeah, guess complicated thought, regardless Sweden chilling COVID-19 reason.

What think reason is? Times like wonder God.  That's true look states like New York worse Belgium based per capita number. look Europe whole United States whole US highest death cases count per capita makes look worse. There's going smaller areas big outbreaks focus purely smaller areas inside big country continent see higher count per capita.

However stats like like anyhow. place different testing different ways recording data. One place look vastly worse based fact figures could accurate. kick road another surge.


I guess viable strategy vaccine years away. don‚Äôt understand policies don‚Äôt update learn virus. Outdoor activities absolutely banned (though restrictions course would sensible), though depths winter it‚Äôs probably going extremely cold possible many people get extended periods time. said, thing absolutely don‚Äôt understand response California. Even though we‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter‚Äú we‚Äôre still lot things don‚Äôt seem sensible, especially since weather still relatively mild here. Anything done outdoors point. understand people want make certain arguments talk trade-offs make here, almost one used terms. Everyone‚Äôs trying present though masquerading people lead ‚Äúscience data‚Äú real basis evolving research surrounding virus itself.

I say shut works, good France, think it‚Äôs less likely affective, especially given presented. said, I‚Äôm optimistic will. Unfortunately, need stop talking issue though trying promote abstinence sex education. worked bit, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going work anymore. People eventually find they‚Äôre exactly abstinence. Whether think right another story, think it‚Äôs simply reality here. 

I think Ultimately needs happen much granular response shut downs remain place certain places travel severely restricted places. need stamp virus places slowly increase radius people freely travel. flareups, need lock down. trying get everyone time seems foolhardy. Trying fight fires none fires time doesn‚Äôt seem like wise approach me. seems like it‚Äôs better certain communities able resume mostly day-to-day life, put resources towards communities build words there. know huge question receive priority here, ultimately think way it. course once, would cost inordinate amount money would also difficult country administer. guess Long story short, need break every country ‚Äúislands‚Äù slowly connect ‚Äúisland‚Äù gets control.

Sweden people definitely think virus hoax still antimaskers. completely depressing know do. via COMTEX

Yes, Trust Chinese state run media this. makes sense PRC. rest us. 

Guys new this, anytime Taiwan mentioned pro-PRC trolls brigade threads.

My opinion stands China exceeded expectations handling pandemic got denying problem however Taiwan model *Democratic* system successfully deal virus. Western countries can't possibly China took extreme measures would never allowable laws.

There's reason Chinese running disinformation campaign this, desire virus constantly trying re-enter country surging cases elsewhere. happy people learn good methods dealing virus within government systems sake. Indeed, did. almost impossible observe fomite infections. However, certainly plays much smaller role compared aerosol route. Washing hands always good idea, regardless Covid. India supposedly estimated IFR 0.05 0.1%. Also young population relative west. think much difference age. horrific slander medical profession. Wow actually love username! also hate people like this. bad can‚Äôt permabanned businesses acting way. Also, harsher lockdown took 4 months totality. one chance less time - especially given open borders europe.

Basically gasoline there, cold weather brought fire. i'll add social security list things youth enjoy proportion new cases last month connected restaurants?

Just looked yesterday:

Official RKI statistic says 2 100 directly traced restaurants.

Problem get Covid restaurant infect wife 2 children home, counted one case restaurant, 3 cases home.

And another problem 75 100 cases cannot traced anything all.

So honestly, nobody really knows. Again, says this, never seen blanket statement accompanied data knowledge situation. I'm Austria, works me. Many things (masks, sanitizer store entrances, closed borders, mandatory quarantines, transparent public reporting, on), think great example Taiwan dealt Covid big-data contact tracing. example, sailors went shore leave throughout country found infected, within hours every single person immediate vicinity wherever travelled got text message informing that, asking self monitor. People US would hard time that, difference now. Stop, making us jealous lol ! wouldn‚Äôt bothered masks thing time honest lockdowns able see anyone really bleak ! Can‚Äôt see positive news (UK) yet ! ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really tried yet‚Äù?

Millions people sacrificing eight months. jobs. homes. businesses. mental health. education. livelihoods.

Please stop acting like sacrifices people making majority year mean nothing. day continues, people hurt it‚Äôs they‚Äôre dying virus. they‚Äôre going giving important? 

It‚Äôs sad people sub think black white. ‚ÄúIf lose job, house, go depression, that‚Äôs okay least you‚Äôre dying COVID saved someone‚Äôs live.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf worry income livelihood stop spiraling control developing mental health issues, you‚Äôre selfish you‚Äôre killing thousands people. haven‚Äôt even tried yet!‚Äù Imagine shame general space force. Keep posted work Outstanding stuff. Go Taiwan! Reminds propaganda black people, cannabis, gays... yeah, first time indeed. Looks like there's visceral need something hate there. Except isn‚Äôt simple. Whitehouse *Did* announce press release one accomplishments last four years ‚Äúending Covid-19 epidemic‚Äù.

It may poorly written, badly current administration bungled things I‚Äôm surprised press release either poorly written written deceive, especially point out, underlying document makes What's interesting dietary sources K2 anyone would consider commonplace. Natto one source. K1 concerts K2 certain conditions body. side brain likely abnormalities-left right? Unless Hawaii could ban arrivals mainland US, stood chance. That's equivalent Taiwan NZ did. Thanks Italy also France could work Behind paywall Anecdotal might be, fact going get 'scientific proof' say need simply cos way would intentionally expose test subjects virus unethical.

We go whatever real life examples worked.

Anyway, see point taking further. like said, countries mask mandates follow diligently far better without.

Do whatever floats boat. skin back. times news told happened think it. news tell supposed think find actually happened.

Many folks know started outright refuse whatever media tell them, relying questionable sources instead. case Europe, mechanism already well utilised Nazi party 1930's Russian Chinese propaganda agencies apparently took lesson unlike European leaders seem live different world. that's true degree. like expose someone near 5 min 100% get it. exposure time odds get it. isolating results 7th inning would minimized exposure.  Also experience living 26 years Belgium masters bending rules. group( large ) broke rules.

Living Netherlands close border, it‚Äôs appeared mask mandates stricter practices Belgium gave incentive many Belgians spend time here, since Dutch ‚Äúintelligent lockdown‚Äù relatively short minimal. week two ago, life totally normal, almost Covid never happened. bit overconfident, ask me.

And even now, although countries discourage border crossing, appears Belgians taking seriously side. consequences way around.

For countries close proximity, it‚Äôs real shame hasn‚Äôt coordinated approach. We‚Äôre screwing other, ourselves. beginning pandemic, scientist studied coronaviruses said average immunity wanes 9-12 months. individuals much shorter, couple years. still scant evidence one like, long median immunity last. That‚Äôs it‚Äôs studied. exponential growth currently experiencing bring lot 'baked-in' deaths.

They could give less thought regarding pandemic, want stay afloat, infection not. 


Close down, go bankrupt, it, bad, someone else start new one place, pandemic over. key word ""allowed"" there's still random surveillance testing.

I believe Kashgar case caught random testing. ‚ÄòTis season...but one wanted. yo-yo news continues. Tomorrow's headline: already coronavirus know it, also still get afraid generally. copypasting another comment.

Three things together:

- children proved catch less virus, less infectious others
- France country lot couples parents work, single moms / single dads. first lockdown hard this: impossible work home, need take care children 24/24. drove mad quite lot friends. economy letting telework happen, need children away
- Remote learning worked well first lockdown. Eventually, ok educated families, good internet connection, lot children got form school delay knowledge ‚ÄúGood people need laws tell act responsibly, bad people find way around laws.‚Äù totally. Use N95 masks, presumably reduce spread covid much 70-90% almost 100% others (if properly sealed), opposed surgical masks. North Dakota leading cases per 1 million population around 52,000 people yet hospitals state aren‚Äôt even close max capacity...yet. Three things together:
- children proved catch less virus, less infectious others
- France country lot couples parents work, single moms / single dads. first lockdown hard this: impossible work home, need take care children 24/24. drove mad quite lot friends. economy letting telework happen, need children away
- Remote learning worked well first lockdown. Eventually, ok educated families, good internet connection, lot children got form school delay knowledge Sounds like good number individuals particular study healthcare workers would likely continuously exposed/ antibodies 'refreshed.' could also contributing conflicting reports long antibodies stay around. (Vs., e.g., UK population study) going keep economy afloat either. God Money answering human sacrifice, could expected this! printer? year 2000? Uh, boat? I'm US. know long trip. I'll pay everything sneak in. Hasn‚Äôt reached yet anyway GM ear loops hand sewn workers (1:00): fully automated mask ear loop stapling: workers BYD designing mask making machines, stapling masks.

In experience:

US companies general hesitant engage capital investment ESPECIALLY custom machinery. 

Chinese (industrial/tech) companies opposite prefer use proprietary machines rather buy shelf, would much rather automate pay laborers. Honestly simple. 

Goal first lockdown buy time prepare inevitable i.e. ramping medical infrastructure, produce medical supplies etc saving lives would lost. 

The first lockdown achieve that. 

BUT mistake trust people right thing. people won't. US Europe , look everywhere people needed ""mandates"" ""order"" follow common sense like wearing masks, avoiding unnecessary travel ( read article yesterday Germans travelled level pre pandemic) , public gatherings. 

Small example beginning pandemie govt said 1000 people event, response Manheim theatre limited events 999 guests. basically following law spirit it.

So conclude, PEOPLE fucked up, plain simple reap 2nd lockdown. 2 days row without local cases. Here's hoping trend continues. according scam calls peeps asks restart computer.

high chance came india. Maybe hand-washing advice exactly reason surface transmission major issue. Yeah quite well early on, neighbours decided ruin ignoring quarantine rules could get good selfie. rising cost food? budget cant handle another increase. Fine may plenty getting expensive. testing community evidence community spread waste resources better directed incoming quarantine patients. Africa massive continent 54 countries diverse economic cultural system. wealthier nations South Africa, Nigeria, Morocco, Algeria, Mauritius Kenya good testing. lower end nations Zimbabwe, Congo, CAR Uganda relatively low nom existent testing. 

However one thing common (apart initially South Africa) Low hospitalization low death rates. 

Most nations SADC lifted lockdown regulations. little mask wearing. cases remained low deaths nearly non existent. Remember talking continent country 

There coordinated attempt 54 independent governments reduce impact COVID 19. fact nations Zimbabwe Kenya monopolized lockdowns political repression 

So question remains continent 1,2 billion ethnically diverse people almost cases Argentina? 

As use "" lack testing defense""; several international medical bodies agreed numbers really low. seen concrete answer Buy low. Sell high. dude, thousands patients everyday spans 10 years.

that's hella lot datas. Czechia 30-35% cca 100 dead daily fuckistan including ppl fall ladder, die tested positive corona something fishy happening US :D  think last, treating people Holland right now. still 6.000 ICU beds available reserve 16.000 beds available shit hits fan. Germany wont repeat mistake march took patients neighboring countries hoarded ventilation machines fear scenes like Italy. learned lot past months. understand though, imagine scenario people country die health system treats people countries. Thats something sell voters. do. got hands masks Taiwan flag on, enjoy admiration walk street! rekt 1000 deaths day seems possible peak. Damn No, obvious make seem. keep saying listen experts apparently regarding topic. sub made hard bet schools driver gut feeling anecdotal evidence important science. Exactly thing accuse antimaskers Clear concise! changed holiday plans. Sad safer.   point covid death toll countries direct financial incentive government would likely higher number, regardless deaths came another source, pneumonia influenza. soon US issued federal funding Covid deaths, statistical base skewed. Ok Alex Jones. Everyone trying develop cures disease keep market get Trump reelected. world sky falling, figured Conservative Party

What hell mean? Progressive Conservative? like hot ice.  question border closings became something right wing politicians liked, left wing politicians dissliked (is parts world least). like Tegnells motivation closing borders intervue right wing politician :D never know sure without testing. mean, China could've said ""oh there's need test since there's community spread"" China test people, even test shipping boxes signs imported frozen virus - found. potential outbreaks squashed beginning takes 1.

Meanwhile places even test enough people, never mind boxes. dark winter. I'm in. Fuck yeah. guess 3 exported Japan spawned COVID quantum vacuum, ones exported Philippines, Hong Kong, Vietnam Shanghai

Afterall Taiwan like claim zero cases. 20% S&amp;P 500, 20% whole economy/stock market. important index market. Agreed, tho last sentence feels little place tone wording post. Sounds like you‚Äôre tough talking Europe threatening special move. He's literally NEVER implied 2020 event. He's made clear there's vaccine general public around summer 2021 ... sort luxury item / handicraft vibe trying give they're hand-making masks? 10,000 deaths whole town dead.

A whole damn town.

And Canada half population Germany number deaths. read actual article, he's saying thing months seen spike store yet community lagged behind first rush week so. county 33 active cases right people calm. Masks mandatory vote though fear number going jump couple weeks. disappointed every business town mandated (thankfully) require properly worn masks refuse service effort flushed one day people careful. know careful. ""reportedly"".

the quality news like breath fresh air air universe spaceballs. Sounds like American panicking, again. people predicting then?

Im going go back June lots people talking second wave Autumn lockdown.

Edit:

The reason second lockdown lockdown isnt enough. nothing new doesnt mean lockdown wasnt appropriate. necessary virus control.

America locked ages ago. ignorant still think this. Yeah ethics thing kind funny particular case literally people throwing parties trying catch virus anyways lol. realize light end Trump tunnel going improve everyone's mental health, right? Ahead schedule budget.

Don't forget Belgium Spain 962 758. heard xtian woman say doesn‚Äôt wear mask jesus decide Covid kill her. Interesting. I'm honestly beginning think never, unfortunately. Make America Function Again.

Biden-Harris 2020. US rich, ""$2000/month everyone another year demolishing economy"" rich. even close. Even took billionaires' wealth, would last us 5 months. damage economics 5 months would untold. anyone seen similar article explaining risk different outdoor activities? Like walking past people outside wearing mask. running biking past someone wearing mask. wear practically one else I'm hard time telling safe pass another runner outside masked. love article uses illustrations studies make points would awesome find like situations. Thanks advance! Yes one gives federal aid listing Covid deaths Lol.

You compare Canada New Zealand. Zero cases.

Trudeau failed control covid. care. get vaccine, I'm going back normal. *Stopped going short time way, nobody thinks everyone sits home. arrived March know people anxious around February. Clubs bars definitely packed May Corona raging elsewhere. Kinda like safe sex, thing 100% stay away people altogether. key. already exposed teammates. game means exactly fuck all. Yes, really. immediately got ahead disinformation campaigns information campaigns PSAs giving people much beneficial information possible, employing use cute mascots.

Like much East Asia, resistant mask wearing. government made significant investments greatly bolstering production capacity PPE, especially surgical masks. however requisitioning output mask manufacturers awhile, I'm sure happy about. however prevent bidding wars plagued PPE supply US early on.

They actually enforce orders isolate quarantine, unlike US mostly using honor system.

Testing. Lots testing.

Much better contract tracing app see positive cases nearby map.


Just name things. think new leadership everyone fall line everything US would perfect. NZ great. like way NZ straight tackled unlike Europe US. Oh fucking god reason test evidence community spread. positive tests either came arriving destination came back false-positive. article says Taiwan scared compliance past experience SARS. could also framed positive way -- ""Fauci confident vaccine approved January!"" Population density high though!
Taiwanese people really cared protecting others day 1. Germany taking patients neighboring countries. wonder they'll keep long last. Oof. rate we‚Äôll million daily cases little month. Live Sydney here. wear mask every time leave house, that's also cos, y'know, Sydney. Nice reference. sorry disappoint German. immigrant beautiful country lovely people. 

If want talk history name country find dumpster fire. scale US, 626,000 cases day. Except Alex Azar go Taiwan, place White House health official went to

Didn't go New Zealand, go South Korea, go Japan, no, White House think Taiwan one wants learn from.

Do think WH sent learn fight COVID, hide COVID? lol Sydneysider here. one ""friend"" thinks fake, fucking RN. Idiots man. Maybe would help metric monitored followed country rate death qty/minute. ‚ÄúLast month American dying COVID every 4 minutes. Last week American dying every 3 minutes. week, American dying every 2 minutes. 1,123 Americans died since last update. Check back tomorrow.‚Äù (Not real stats)

This hilarious 3 days ago CNN posted article saying immunity wanes posted new article saying immunity antibodies last many guys ban tourists (incl domestic)? that's key. Oh wow 1.6k deaths day want die. Making new friends impossible right now. feel alone isolated. tried talking counselors school. take seriously. thinking slitting throat wrist session tomorrow. know tell really edge. want live like anymore. alone. 

I want spend holidays birthday alone. already hard meeting people. Everyone obsessed looking ""desperate"" making connections impossible. want fucking die. one. upgraded 95s recently.  doubled bit decided wanted feel safer, also avoid guilt giving someone else.  like mentality.  makes happy people mentality.  I'm also lonely fuck drop comraderie super nice. think depends are. Like said, Asia well. Oceania initially tried flatten curve, city (Melbourne, Australia) looking long term goals ‚ÄòCOVID normal‚Äô - wearing masks least mid next year, contact tracing etc.  

Speaking contact tracing testing, take different lengths time different states, entire country? first wave, state took several days get touch contacts, second wave got people neighbouring state performed much better help streamline process. I‚Äôd assumed would similar America, comment make question that. 

Also, since goal flatten curve US, still pay go ICU, hospital general? Ju√°rez evil. Republicans are. Lo siento para todos. Taiwan's government called People's Republic China!! gj China!! Look, think kind hubris reflected post exactly (Western) Europe failed control outbreak(s). First ""it's China"". ""it's East Asia ('the Far East')"". Following, ""it's countries like Italy Iran."" Well.

Vaccine Yeah made comment couple weeks ago. personally keep mine food front me. try keep time bites. It‚Äôs silly people pretend like COVID thing table. ""There clear cases COVID-19 fomite transmission found literature. "" go describe possible cases, nothing surface definitely culprit. Fomite spread much harder track direct person-to-person, reasonably common means spread, seen least one confirmed case now. 

There recent statement made China latest cluster caused fomite spread via CT machine, PR statement, academic study, I'm sure much stock would put it. Yeah NY seems done amazing job stop virus tracks considering challenges had. covid itself. knock effects. Industries die lay people, consumers spend less, places used consume lay people. cycle feeds itself. implement US measurable lockdowns? Nothing. Refusal wear masks, refusal restrict normal life (shopping, sports, big friend meetings), lead uncontrolled spread forces vulnerables isolate. Great. Well done. US. Not. long kids going school, spread network still connected across entire community Idk wtf I‚Äôm talking about. must read post wrong. First lock didnt work lets again.... Insanity thing expecting differnt outcome. Please describe felt disease maybe things noticed. People need give answer. fantastic article 100% worth read. govt bought 300k doses free people. whatever Regeneron charges. hair living.. half asshat clients won‚Äôt wear mask half wear wrong.. stressful work job smell people‚Äôs nasty breath even wear masks. feel like sitting duck.. eat though so.. used time bought first lockdown implement stringent border, testing, contact tracing isolation procedures

Ding ding ding! people ignore actually needed control this. Less lockdown would also work, provided TTI actually done. Lock downs ever useful break community transmission. themselves, help eradicate this, without TTI measures, countries find repeating lock cycles uselessly. Unfortunately, Europe US (1 billion people) intent keeping pandemic going long possible. sure though. Lockdowns don‚Äôt effect food. won‚Äôt see level panic. Last time stock markets crashed 20% US even dozen cases. get 50,000 day it‚Äôs shrugged baseline. know covid, we‚Äôve it. again.

Would majority people take seriously wear masks, restrict life one two years - situation now. forcing nursing homes isolate. poor management. blame federal government that.

Also, read many posts locking vulnerable solution many say (and keep healthy infected). work either.

It full society needs restrict help equally restrict. ignoring pandemic. ignoring measures prevent spread. seriously working REDUCING spread.

This consequence people trying maintain normal non-normal situation. people cooperating vulnerables restrict protect - detriment them.

How justify reality denial? accurate daily death number. lull second third surges since summer we've number days 1000 deaths. Peak second surge may around 1500-1600 daily deaths.

The problem type study it‚Äôs controlling factors, like social distancing, increases hygiene practices. areas mask mandates also things, like closing non-essential businesses limiting number people gatherings. People willing wear masks also likely properly wash hands. likely pay attention symptoms isolate needed. 

There many factors besides cloth masks. misleading titles weak ‚Äústudies‚Äù getting old

Pre-educated personnel retrainable. 9 months since first cases. hospital single weekend course clearly insufficient. would cost real money properlywould meant taking people current positions. Covidmetrics tells there's least **SEVEN** thousand deaths worldwide today. 

One-seventh deaths happening US despite 5% world pop. What's tolerance death? Anyone that's you? Yeah, let rip then.

But please never think heroic again. 

Right opportunity real heroism front you. get credit after. know could help others. 

Or let rip ignore thousands people dying day. 

But want another option, look nations thorough response. New Zealand. Norway. Thailand. many more. fight disease hard group reopen fully. Less deaths, less economic impact, less emotional struggle. 

You're tired this, really tried yet. won't. many people ready let rip. also count deaths. Belgium highest death rate first wave European Union included even suspected covid-19 deaths. E.g. someone dies respiratory infection care home known outbreak would assumed covid-19.

What you‚Äôre promoting forcing people die without getting see family frankly extremely inhumane. worry Easter. know Easter dunno, whole invasion Crimea look amazingly stupid. Russia's economy still recovered sanctions like 2014.

Really Russia done well Putin would say he's perhaps cutthroat, losing country like trillion dollars like maybe gas pipeline contract tiny bit water access seems straight stupid.

Putin done well himself, I'm sure proves he's especially intelligent. years later Russia's still barely global exports, what's that? they're like cold version Saudi Arabia mostly capable making money fossil fuels little bit mining exports know they've got plenty resources....why like learn turn resources marketable industries decades. Clearly Russia completely incompetent, know they've fallen way behind computers, they're pretty good industries like rockets. ought able get s*** together big boy economy now.

You look GDP exports look like third world country. Various reasons:

 * better close much close little.

 * lockdowns restaurants closed R dropped.

 * situations restaurants closed, got opened infections increased.

 * Various research models predict closing restaurants helps

 * know close contact people spreads disease. know better, getting people less close contact seems like reasonable plan.

 * There's proof restaurants can't cause.

And definite proof one way other, apply [Occam's use simplest explanation available, that's restaurants effect spreading virus. Yikes actually young ignorant management types show worth hours ""supervising"" others productively think does, profit motivation helps drive innovation.

Singapore less one new case per million people per week. Back January alerts posted every doctor's office, contact tracing teams activated. first infected people came (a couple Wuhan, entered country 23rd, believe) identified within days. contact tracers found fifty people risk, sent quarantine facilities. course, paid time spent quarantine, recognition sacrifice public good.

So first US cases cropping Oregon, SG already establishing complete transmission chains 99% infected. NYC trying limited restrictions communities, SG couple thousand people taking paid staycations infected missed. Fox News yammering virus 'hoax', SG labs producing first serology test. Feds stealing masks hospitals, SG handing fines wearing mask, thanks local mask production already full swing.

Dude. ever looked around noticed take granted way people live? mean, think mask mandates make LESS people wear masks?

It's strange me. think masks work. want people wear masks. think mask mandates good idea local government, view mask mandates 100% effective, work.

The problem right biggest spikes rural states counties. achieve universal masking, covid go spread maskless county spread there.

I'll repost something wrote seem think mask mandates created lots variables affect result, including compliance, level enforcement, penalties noncompliance, can't say one mask mandate failed somewhere earth work must necessarily prove can't work, South Korea shows us, among examples, can.

I think time get real mask mandates.

Forget fining individuals outside maybe public spaces like parks. Mandate businesses transact customers wearing approved masks mouth nose. I'd say 95% problem people going buy things.

If caught business people flaunting mask mandate, hit business heavy fines.

This would similar already limit sales alcohol tobacco products minors. people can't buy things want without wearing mask, choice. shop, wear damn mask.

I play band things started ramping back either played gigs would find someone else would. Well, main form income live playing, played. bar gigs I'd wear mask -- last 5 months I've seen one person bar wearing mask.

But think point time got vaccine you‚Äôll empty movie theater, modified amusement part nobody happy, half empty restaurant  Yes, initially happened them. attempted suppress true story rest world save face.

The global pandemic them. literally said ***not*** great news. can't tell they've tested anyone older 55. 55 count ""older adult"" say article? need government implement UBI quick lockdown stop spread basically stay inside for. couple day Sorry ignorance - understanding northern southern parts Belgium differences, least language assume cultural well. seeing COVID problem one part vs other? Also, said masks exactly people always expected/thought would - 100% protect wearer catching virus. work way around 100% effective, help reduce. exact thing happening office. lo behold someone caught last week amd everyone scattering like roaches light get back wfh.

Yeah, probably help some. joking comment. far tell pretty much thing planning differently asked specifics plan. vaccine means go back normal...but hey maybe run hardware store without confronted fuckwad wearing mask. Umm...are different timeline us?

Nixon impeached.  Coronavirus come home roost.

Tangent: many family farmers buy health insurance, survive infection get learn advantages ACA hard way? Yeah anti mask people backwards. say want live fear mortality rate low. much worst things death never needed vaccine coronavirus before. Common colds serious enough cases coronaviruses. SARS MERS eradicated quickly vaccine needed also possible test vaccines need people get infected that.

Finally, virus ever much effort put towards developing vaccine it. really news. ‚Äúthis might happen need this‚Äù type article. r/JusticeServed  attended Zoom talk Dr. Kyle Harper part Brown University public lecture series ancient plagues. really interesting. One big topics interest economic broad impacts particular plague, Antonine Plague. 

Anyway, agree you. already big impacts. it‚Äôs one that‚Äôs studied thousand years (if humans still around), plenty pandemics. We‚Äôre showing bad dealing them, even tools it. Granted Noam Chomsky interesting listen lately, he‚Äôs reminding us still global climate catastrophe nuclear instability worry about. Well, there‚Äôs always something. Well, slightly adjust behavior wear piece cloth rat-hole take kids six flags next summer next winter? **Which prefer?** nonsense. long lasting repercussions prolonged global shutdown FAR outweigh short term costs reopening - especially considering virus almost exclusively affects elderly chronically ill people multiple existing co-morbidities. 

How people realizing this? First ‚Äú15 days slow spread‚Äù we‚Äôre 7 months lockdowns. Enough enough. Let people make decisions regarding level risk deem acceptable. you‚Äôre 75, obese, diabetic, it‚Äôs bad idea go bar. you‚Äôre 22, fit, preexisting problems able operate usually would.

Isn't better put restrictions people risk zone let people live lives? ones barely get dent it.

Old people retired need hours people could carry virus. Keep doors vaccine otherwise, point taking vaccine since working society left live in.

But roommate did! get wait find lady pops positive test week. \o/

Oh yeah, they're finding *so ridiculous* local schools open. ""so irresponsible."" That‚Äôs true though. lot voters single issue voters base decisions issues alone. Le vaccine treatments hell think conducting trials, reviewing results, ultimately (hopefully), approving them? certainly Trump.

Trump‚Äôs toadies. That‚Äôs democrats think without reason.

The people worry damage children, people didn‚Äôt stand people weren‚Äôt wearing masks. people going bars. people said flu.

WTF doing? truly felt kids damaged would let bars open without even care safety precautions wearing masks?

Ultimately, pandemic run control force shutdown silence. weren‚Äôt protecting kids?

Is bar owners profit important kids?

We experiencing pandemic, force government shut bars force government compensate bar owners lost income. People US would hard time that

Also commentator saying  ""**least testing per 100k** "" misleading statistic , may factually correct given population India number tests joke, need procure tests administer it. 

So positivity rate 4-5% need test rather distribute tests areas rate high like said 15% + states.  Agreed.

So helps people HIGH viral load more. ""HIGH"" viral load defined trial?

And say anything reducing hospital admission fatality. claim reduction COVID-19 related medical visits 57% - 72%, visits? Seeing doctor? taking test? Hospital admission? Intubation? Reminds movie Outbreak Dustin Hoffmann looking host, monkey.

Whatever you‚Äôre smoking must good MI still mask read routine testing, say government mandated not. Also routine testing different random testing previous poster talking about. agree cases high Los Angeles County 5k day like 1,600-2000 recently. Also, mask mandate place mean enforced way. ppl wear masks many ppl obviously see rise cases. Many ppl walk around beaches public spaces without masks enforcement. places issue fines cities/ areas do. person protect others ppl choose wear masks continue endless cycle. Legal implementation probably hope less backlash people prepare get used idea bit. started following virus coming back South Korean/Hong Kong/Japan business trip. Overseas investment partners already starting get skittish risks posed....and let‚Äôs say broader Asian trust Chinese government isn‚Äôt high. 

You read Wuhan government attempted hide truth Beijing. Beijing attempted hide truth WHO. 

China didn‚Äôt get transparent well outbreak began...then began sharing scientific community.

The Chinese government government problem throwing certain ethnic groups mass detention centers. oppressive regime don‚Äôt value free speech transparency. handled COVID great example that. Every model simulator good quantitative data that's fed it. author's admission, model based COVID specific data. fact model published peer review telling.

So 'less perfect' much misleading. model presents situation fact cause people take action may benefit falsely reassure people causing take risks areas. responsible thing would couch model beginning uncertainty assumptions built on.

As say, little knowledge dangerous thing. *""If get vaccination campaign, second third quarter 2021 vaccinated substantial proportion people, think easily end 2021 ‚Äî perhaps even next year ‚Äî start semblances normality.""*

The best give general advice easy remember applies almost situations. Like wear masks, essentially distance, wash hands ventilate indoor spaces much possible.

I've pushing masks increased ventilation since like February pretty clear something making fires infectious probably increased ability transmit air one way another.

It's difficult get test still, track trace sucks, seem like we've really increased number ventilators beds.

We knew would second wave winter, yet prepare life living Covid...  world still lockdown, infected Americans forced leave homes live quarantine camps.

Sounds legit. 1 though? People say 0.1% die. 270.000 Dead, herd immunity would reached 60% 330 Million= 198 Million). So, either Covid much deadly expected, herd immunity work. Good them! Scums deserve it! Regeneron. Regeneron. heard name? Oh yea, drug President invested in. Regeneron.

The rethoric used minister education keep ""schools open costs"" second bullet point. Whereas big unspoken rationale keep schools open former.

The reason stated plainly simple. would reduction perceived function school: provide daycare parents go work rather providing education.

Belgium federal state incumbent governments leaning towards conservative/liberal part spectrum. There's also lingering political conflict regional autonomy language politics spawned byzantine administrative governance structure. dilutes leadership weakens chain commands.

Even past week healthcare officials scientific experts quite literally begging take something, government Flanders kept refusing enact measures.

Our minister president stated last Sunday television ""There reason put fire house fire"".

Part problem. part population mixed signals months now. Loads people went normal lives, easing back old habits eschewing close contacts employers gradually reduced wfh schools higher education opened full on.

This disaster making since late August. every step way, experts issuing warnings. clear failure remains seen impact society months years come.

That would something. Take liquor license. weak fines going stop businesses stupid things. need step up. said mild case fortunate outcome suggests others concerns fears unjustified. That's pretty myopic view, think? Again, something that's seen entire western world right now; medical experts warning months winter would worse anything we'd experienced far.

conclusion: world high alter anyone arriving taiwan, envy ass. Yes, main goal keep economy going keep healthy people work think earliest we‚Äôll see one mid-late November now. Hopefully happens. think high-net worth individuals think-tanks enormous influence certain administration's policy decisions, created absurd rouse non-vaccine herd immunity way protecting financial interests, much care one way plebs die plague. work bar/restaurant honestly ZERO enforcement mask policy. It‚Äôs even questionable among staff. feel like I‚Äôm one takes seriously sometimes. Depending predicted positive rate, batch size China usually 5-20. higher positive rate, smaller batch size be. Bullshit Blah blah blah keeps stock market plummeting channels money research...yay.

As person connected pharmacy works since every single one ""vaccines"" kept low temperatures. -60-70¬∞.
Where plan talking logistics work real world pharmacies nationwide yet equipped type industrial refrigeration neccessary store things? real world talk actually breaks down? Shallow promises without plan seems like plan all.

Not one chain pharmacies b promised place go vaccine equipped refrigerate it. foots bill new equipment? hell many refrigeration units installed time many even exist?

I love false promises politicians keep letting people down.

The next guy great fixer savior right?

Always false promises. people need stop listening dicks agendas. anti-maskers mainland China early days breakout, lambasted pretty hard chinese social media. guess sweden wrong according fauci. vaccine best? That's debunked fact checkers. Maybe ought put /s comment. still remember press conference initial death estimates ranged 60k 200k Trump looked stoked 60k number. Birx Fauci kind looked eachother ""oh no"" face. Yup, I'm sure trust MS comes collecting reporting data So, weekend numbers (until Tuesday) moderate 1300 cases per day, Wednesday 2k Thursday 3k. Looks like exponential growth arrived. 

The tone press conference also much dire usual, many new restrictions announced Hotspots. Capacity king.. wait choosing gets IV bags. 200 6 here

conclusion: envy ass.  I'm seeing 1,980 new cases 10/27 appears record graph I'm seeing Google. actually, correct? Yeah mistake present, health authorities recognize three vehicles of[ **coronavirus ... contaminated surfaces (fomites), although US Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) indicates least likely way catch virus, conclusion backed European Center Disease Control Prevention‚Äôs (ECDC) observation single case fomite-caused Covid-19 observed

This really interesting me, always thought things like touching doorknob hundreds people really increased risk catching covid guess make difference? World War Z american Govt playing politics zombie vaccine claiming working vaccine donor important I've heard too, lot. 

That ""the media"" suddenly stop reporting virus immediately election. everyone cheer Biden ""same thing"" Trump doing. etc. 

The brainwashing runs deep USA. ignore I? group tourists much less outbreak risk -- they're clustered, limited number, pre-planned routes (thus select locations select lengths time). unlimited numbers mainlanders roaming around potentially anywhere island definitely helps reducing workload tracking well risk widespread outbreaks.

Plenty countries receive mainland Chinese tourists, may well receive ones Europe US. *is* thing someone infected able pass on, know. Maybe, coming guy infamously known making making incorrect statements spread virus, feel credible. produce quite decrease enable get winter without health service overwhelmed. Would work better positive given incentive stay - like food parcels ensuring jobs held them. virus kind reminds terrorists ""fish sea"" concept. Terrorists blend general community hidden, look like normal people. takes person supply food etc. That's way covid is. everyone unified, covid hang walmart someone comes without mask. We're I'll equipped fight problems Aye good luck that. 5 months awfully optimistic.

We able distribute vaccine quickly even safe, effective candidates. 

Hard ‚Äôherd immunity‚Äô reinfection already proven, &amp; long-lasting immunity hasn‚Äôt been. 6 known human coronaviruses, none proven long-lasting immunity. SARS-1 &amp; MERS never (publicly) confirmed long lasting immunity via direct rechallenge... speculative papers suggesting cell immunity.

SARS-2 combination traits essentially unprecedented modern diseases, &amp; render easy snuff out.

-Long latency infectiousness even pre-fever(SARS-1 largely snuffed due ability screen temperature)

-Potentially even transmissible flu &amp; similar respiratory illnesses.

-Confirmed short term immunosuppression, potential long term immunosuppression.

-Reinfection/lack long term immunity.

-Potential worse symptoms upon reinfection.

It‚Äôs like someone used SARS-1 trial run &amp; ironed kinks.

If want supporting evidence points, look happening Iran. hit early, &amp; little curb spread... reports out(from official state channels) patients infected 3 times already, &amp; many reinfections making current western media largely ignored situation Iran, horrific death rate countries like Peru - countries, who, mind you, much younger populations &amp; milder 'winters' North American &amp; northern Eurasian countries.

The country lion's share research coronaviruses was/is China. Interesting response outbreaks seems much rapid &amp; radical many countries. exactly best track record giving shit citizens. Perhaps better understanding SARS-2 do. Gov. Kristi Noem made clear issue requirements wear masks public. cast approach pandemic ‚Äî foregoing government restrictions keep economic activity humming ‚Äî example Republican leadership.
 
With leadership like surprise hospitals getting slammed? last heard still polling well state... place find officially recommended/required way administer test? thing put swab nose?

I‚Äôm talking friend don‚Äôt think local testing place puts thing far enough back want see there‚Äôs official thing says it‚Äôs supposed done. we've local guy make claim since forever transfers aerosols, however never proven besides good looking sketches computer calculations. Based assumptions. 

Does disease actually scientifically proven transfer aerosols?
Because that's really readout scary won‚Äôt wear masks makes think take vaccine? Seriously though. One things I‚Äôm looking forward stupid ‚ÄòRun‚Äô (5-foot gap) ‚ÄòForest‚Äô (5-foot gap) ‚ÄòRun‚Äô signs getting taken down. Lifestyles rich fucked head.i seen, many people perfectly happy focus ‚Äú99% survive‚Äù completely ignoring fact hospitals overwhelmed, suffer emergencies like major injuries heart attacks, great difficulty getting care need. one hear ‚Äúyour loved one put floor hallway there‚Äôs space beds.‚Äù None restrictions anything unless police starts enforce them. Victoria looked heavy handed successful. rolling part I'm skeptical of. assume first batches go elderly, vulnerable frontline workers. Meanwhile social distancing measures surely stay place?
Then need enough people get vaccinated kind herd immunity reached and, again, relax restrictions happens? could see slow rollout summer months infections anyway, maybe light end tunnel fall?
My point people fed long painful winter. Xinjiang, must connected forced labor. That's basically logic here. That‚Äôs point. already passed grim, still months left year. First contagious, ill. Pretty much separated, without much pressure. Also, lung aerosols important. trust word White House right now, President say anything try boost polling numbers. Unacceptable \~60% approve trump's COVID handling

The 40% pretty much ok it

Do 40% represent enough votes give trump 270 EV 5 days? Yeah happens sometimes. knows don‚Äôt think reddit knows able fix it. It‚Äôs happened long time. Oh well Right. Good luck that. really feels optimistic point . F Said guy active r/conspiracytheories [It won‚Äôt matter, already know 

The vaccine political tool. Centers Disease Control Prevention projected worst-case scenario 160 million 210 million cases December. forecast, 21 million people would need hospitalization 200,000 1.7 million could die end year. Health officials cautioned models infection rate vary widely.

The 200,000 lower bound **worst case scenario**. grandmother died infectious disease old folks home (UTI), hundreds thousands older people died sepsis. die fall, whither away Alzheimer‚Äôs. You‚Äôre presenting false choice.

And ventilators used early pandemic big part killed many older people. ventilator panic really drove death rate. we‚Äôve stopped death rates fallen considerably. sucks work office windows ventilation... fan positioned doorway sometimes wonder whether literally anything. 30% chance brain damage? Jeez, people afraid Well ones yell 'muh rights' asked put mask abnormal begin with. NYC SF stated could leave home essential goods work (and SF required written permit work) NYC specifically stated leaving home gathering size (even visiting friend outside) illegal back spring. I‚Äôm wrong, guys So... none pharma companies apply approval end November December. even happens vaccine? Much less taking approval process account, production distribution vaccine.... informing public lying sway gullible fool vote orange idiot. Fauci: social distance. Americans: Nah, we‚Äôre Americans. handle problem. Fauci: please stay home! little while. try get things back normal. Americans: won‚Äôt someone think economy. Fauci: love god, please wear mask public. Americans: Um, said masks weren‚Äôt needed beginning pandemic new, gonna take words context make broad brush assumptions don‚Äôt need too.. Fauci: let try explain idiots. live near Seattle, never see cops masks on. fucking stupid. I'm Dutch, surprise? *We prepare*, half-assed whole situation, knew coming?

The way handle made losing much trust society tbh example sweden tells opposite: biggest problem herd immunity argument (not including factual basis, fucking care), herd immunity assumes long-lasting permanent immunity, something little known far. trump voters skew older anti-mask-ey, bet see die higher rate post election 3rd Wave COVID air purifiers worthwhile all? see mixed reviews help articles saying make things worse. unfortunately work office, people wear masks lot time definitely 100% day long. Would air purifier on/near desk help? Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

That‚Äôs part reason kids get sick often. Part might building immune systems it‚Äôs also they‚Äôre less aware protective dealing peoples‚Äô germs. like assume neither real product real logistics plan. even read article? clearly state need store -4F, nothing comparison Pfizer product currently requires storage -94F. doesn‚Äôt definitively mean shouldn‚Äôt shut down. Keeping things open trading health economic activity. point makes sense tell people can‚Äôt work won‚Äôt helped benefit society outweighs individual suffering. Several states setup review process, could delay it. Still better outcome millions. Especially push-pull free country this. Well, we've never seen coronavirus proven give lifelong immunity. would pretty shocking one did. 

The important question ""for long"". Covid clap? worse april. 


IN april weeks lockdown peak deaths happened. lockdown yet hospital full peak april. voluntary, decide get tested placed quarantine employer put unoaid leave. also entotled receive sick leave money. White House wanted give us big October surprise.

And did.

Not one wanted give us, one people needed wake up. worries around viral load - say one person gets it, bed around spouse days know sick - viral load spouse gets super high, yes? I'd love see study severity spouses catch home. god DAMN fuck around

I envy thoes guys. live Island. live, cross two international borders inside hours walk. Enforcing would little difficult Sad New Zealand noises. reality, chumbolone. people saying we‚Äôre entering second wave now. That‚Äôs true... we‚Äôre still first wave. Like Fauci says, far thing. county.

RemindMe! 3 days bought niosh approved n95s Grainger. find extremely hard believe kn95s (the ones readily available) equivalent n95s n95s sold everywhere kn95s available local liquor store convenience stores around town Belgium 40,000 tests / day can't keep government decided stop testing asymptomatic people I'm Canada entire family UK (I visiting March, book emergency flight home!).
My gut reaction plan seems like madness, Boris plan. suppose reaction based sheer number 'not risk' patients still hospitalised, dismisses long term effects Covid still studied. 
Anyway, that's awful lot people spread virus amongst. time period looking at? need catch UK news. sucks public health department tests asymptomatic people free here. insurance info needed. Anyone doesn‚Äôt fever cough major symptoms goes there. Positive results surprisingly came back within 24-48 hours, North Dakota. long term adverse effects KNOW about. Yet. That's exactly did! 9 tomorrow, wish luck! don‚Äôt understand, concluded going way back Diamond Princess aerosolized, airborne transmission possible, likely? people compartmentalized enclosed rooms connected ventilation, number ended testing positive, doesn‚Äôt even seem possible transmission occurred respiratory droplets would travel freely ventilation get ‚Äústuck‚Äù along way? 

Makes sense. airborne transmission risk widely known months months. genuinely don‚Äôt understand presented recent determination evidence suggested otherwise quite while, including general extreme level infectivity / virulence that‚Äôs driving furious spread across world... Every single one contacts cases tested negative virus antibodies. Unless magical strain covid exists Taiwan, people get infected Taiwan. April anymore. Anybody dies COVID blame Imagine stopped killing black people we'll see health care plan two weeks. Always two weeks. ABSOFUCKINGLUTELY Yeah.

RoCk Roll DEvil'S muSak Winter coming, people staying warm indoors breathing air.  noodles actually means everyone gets covid 15 minutes. Fuck anti-mask assholes. Republic China Taiwan. Ah, Unavailable due legal reasons  recognize attempting access website country belonging European Economic Area (EEA) including EU enforces General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) therefore access cannot granted time.

In words, ""we wanted steal personal information allowed to""... Overall, number people infected doubling every nine days.

So take UK full lockdown, shops except supermarkets pharmacies closed, schools closed, essential travel, distancing mask wearing everywhere? /s can't even imagine many people already killed isolation. Add winter weather going get worse. get control. Infected means nothing. difficulty breathing know breathless. feel oxygen hoses must 24/7 till nees it. Oxygen means careful eating, drinking, talking on. lungs severe heavy, thickened unable function normally. COViD19, masks social distancing sanitizers. like motor accidents get affected, die, crippled. mean follow traffic rules! medical data also available, twitter facebook Instagram posts... gave iodine pills People demanded Panic based lies. live Limburg power plant region. talking Antwerpen. thought reflect on: Belgium gouvernement decide plant stays open, safety standards reached. safety standards judged belgian experts. 

I'm even going answer rest argument, big facebook experience here.

You might lived 13 years.. showing little knowledge country. Seriously. Didn‚Äôt many health ministers quit due incompetence head state‚Äôs? 



I know Azar current US equivalent health minister he‚Äôs taken comfy hidden back seat NIAID, who‚Äôve acted equivalent international health ministries. 



Him quitting would justified believe knows things would get worse leaves. 


He‚Äôs unenviable position he‚Äôll criticized matter things go. real covid lockdowns work, he‚Äôll criticized paralyzing economy. half-assed April lockdowns don‚Äôt work, he‚Äôll attacked people‚Äôs carelessness. randomly gets infected, he‚Äôll criticized following rules survives infection, he‚Äôll criticized blowing proportion, alternative happens, antisocial people celebrate like it‚Äôs end ‚Äútyranny‚Äù. everything right without collateral damage, critics credit something else. Fauci team know what‚Äôs right. disability rate far concerning...

While die many recover easily mean politicians keep telling people Covid over, hoax mess elections, easy treat drugs don‚Äôt get medical treatment can‚Äôt afford, disappear Nov 4? basically condone plans abduct officials trying keep populations safe? Yeah, politicians blame people thinking big deal hoax holding weddings../s percentage testing positive tested around 5%.([begin somehow cause host explode 8 times row destroyed. Looks awesome though. 3, pretty high risk. Pretty much local authority high population density going higher level though, islands Highlands 1.

Kind wish everyone would happy sit house 3 weeks could cut spread gets widespread need 2 month lockdown. every classroom already one infected student. 

And herd immunity school doesn‚Äôt mean anything students teachers part community. leave school every day. school small part herd. RUSSIANS! lockdown ‚Äúallowing social interactions continue‚Äù pretty much strict first one. sure delusional Thanks doctor. saw someone talking way clan would kick Thanos right. mean matter vote, still die virus statistical rate. hope trajectory change pandemic response would back Biden would come nearly February, even April would saw decisions made appear that's vaccine supposed rolling out. Everyone mad main character still put freaking mask like four years. And, course, may (likely not, imo) even possible achieve anyway. Hmm safe though. I‚Äôll wait guinea pigs mean ppl try first rush. I'm say employees forced testing employers give unpaid vacation refuse go.

Let remind testing voluntary.

Also antigen tests. accurate. 

Also there's way check every single positive person they're actually quarantine not.

Also people still clue happening 2 days. Town city halls receiving vague instructions next day different ones everyone's confused.

Also there's enough medical workers.

Also there's chance get infected spot.

Good idea Slovakia! Yikes wonder many paper would wasted would print articles regarding America's pandemic handling failure? Initial estimates low 200,000 high 1,700,000. think America really good actually peak daily deaths way back April. üëç Indeed What's rush? white house anything important coming up? big reason rest world getting control üò© Thats ridiculous systems never secure enough go completely paperless people lost minds. too, buddy. Fauci man incredible patience strength; put bullshit he's still here; advocating logical, kind way. That's backups important. Especially off-site backup. better blow everything away restore data pay ransom. huge misconception America nothing. Part population actually lot. Mobility traffic congestions data show much pronounced reduction Europe. major cities 40 60% less traffic indexes compared 2019 year. lot digital jobs large portion well-off population allows it. America also deeply divided, time significant portion population still about, creating highly visible front ""doing nothing"". bet new cyber security company health care enter scene. cain hospital like month though? Sure. Uyghurs deserve jobs. work, must forced CCP. Oh, perfectly allowed live poverty forever, keep creating terrorists kill innocent people. Mass infections affect food production &amp; distribution. Numbers rising. feel like done everything right. people, try best contact them. person decides something soo important would risk getting covid it, guess they'll take chances. dont contact them. probably covid I'd quit chill home shorting stocks. country Latin America got enough vaccines vulnerable too, think matter enough vaccines everybody people rich enough actually work person. currently screen COVID construction sites, guys gals every day regardless Hey shoot brains we're talking Western country, would thought?

And maybe read anything economies comparing places locked places haven't, realize effect economy *because rampaging pandemic scares people go spend money*.

Many early deaths presumptive (as testing wasn‚Äôt yet). Care also improved dramatically.

Early on, death rate much higher. checked ago (August?), deaths gone 95% infections gone significantly, meaning death rate significantly 95%.

If numbers continued like April, could looking millions dead, it‚Äôs everyone freaked out. average bad numbers current numbers, looks lot worse is.

I‚Äôm living alone. work alone towers, alone pulling cable working computers. I‚Äôm reasonably healthy, I‚Äôm tested regularly, society need people immunity.

Given incredibly high survival rate COVID, it‚Äôs better people like build immunity, vulnerable don‚Äôt to. Scientist said virus could always us, like regular flu. regular flu cured vaccine perfect.

Trump pulled WHO, doesn‚Äôt admits Taiwan country, pretended able hear question Taiwan‚Äôs success asked, instead praised People obviously lack comparison others. model informed essentially **no** evidence.

Building successful model relies one two methods (ideally both);

1) bottom-up approach - determine values various model parameters (e.g. aerosol dimensions, aerosol production rate, aerosol behaviour characteristics, infectious viral load per aerosol, natural enviromental death rate virus etc etc) run model see happens. 

2) top-down approach - high quality real world data. know model parameters, adjust fit parameters model replicates real-world data.

When fairness doctrine still active, anyone got media license required broadcast fair balanced way, equal amounts time controversial topics. guess means Malkovich got it...why Fuck Tony?!? TBH that's actually plausible based [WHO high-mortality areas.

But yeah, 0.6% population still ridiculous number deaths, however cut it. Slightly less Minnesota, ten times number deaths Slovakia.

You're something right. Masks slow spread infection caused respiratory droplets? Shocking. That's votes for. 98 scientists say climate change man-made 2 say isn't, fringe viewpoint gets fewer reads. That's work (and works everywhere science, journalism). 

No one says small chance nefarious origin. can't rule entirely. burden proof extraordinary claims extraordinary high, level proof required something like met - treated cheap conspiracy. think it‚Äôs worse that. think magical thinking believes says people believe it, true. It‚Äôs like damn Christmas movie mind. believe able hear jingle bells land Covid return. Yeah, started getting channels digital conversion make changes setup. Ikr. I'm looking fellow Americans like, hell wrong people!?

On behalf least us, sorry guys. chilblains, toes returning normal. Havent tested sure due covid could been. Nobody knows yet, it‚Äôs highly likely it‚Äôs prevalent Reddit makes be. Viruses general take recover sometimes‚ÄîCOVID isn‚Äôt special regard. longer-lasting damage (ignore anyone says it‚Äôs permanent damage, literally way know that) mainly people severe enough cases need hospitalization. Care cite SCOTUS case backs argument rather destroys it?   current sotuation Belgium? dont good splution. Yes could shuffle doctors consequences. 

But would done better prevention. relatives live netherlands, havent taken single precaution. Theyre starting wear masks reluctantly. Theyve traveling europe since beginning worry. bars every weekend, huge house parties, carnival. amazing numbers low now. penny prevention worth pound cure. focused medical side this. Medicine vaccines last line defense. focused society prevention mitigation. Masks mandatory, dont wear one automatic 1k fine. covid break quarantine automatic jailtime. cousins kid plays every day neighbour kid covid positive ""kids dont really get ok"" People need take seriously come control. inb4 go Trump rallies twat 3 weeks ago I'm ended? even know active cases gone administration itself. Ok. mean, got COVID June. I'm 31. took 4 days get long term adverse affects. know half dozen people got well. None died. None long-term health affects either.

I'm saying isnt serious. But, maybe *as serious* ""if get brain organs remain intact""

Thats ""chicken little sky falling"" rhetoric. guess. also get regardless! need type excuse get flu shot! Plus peace mind get sick worry covid flu Wait. There's online schooling option? Wow..and rest said terrifying. one issue based preliminary REACT study, full report confidence intervals way high make proper conclusion from.

For example state R value London 1.4 4.9. South West say 0.89 3.9 

How range high R value 2.5 3 back February people behaved 100% normally 0 restrictions? Need wait full report estimates precise. Shut fuck bro you‚Äôre tyrant lmao real thing. covid back May. also got Beau‚Äôs line toenails. Everything gone back normal Beau‚Äôs lines growing bizarre finding. might even work US. Maybe everyone give try. Next time find another case like this, lock 2 weeks. Can't risk idiots spreading it. Plus wedding damn important, make last 14 days. Germany full scared people shouting government needs act, great benefit Germany always acting 1 week earlier countries. that's it.

So countries issue lockdowns hospitals overrun, Germany locks 1 week tons people warn overrun week.

That's marginally better, really something sets Germany apart rest Europe. Natural Herd immunity shittest excuse give failed covid-19 response. Pretty much Poland - almost 2 months we're seeing numbers like 20k daily cases comparison around 1k daily end august. government chooses money, life. most(?) people agree it‚Äôs correct course action understand correctly, asymptomatic less likely transmit virus. one could spread it. person picked infect first person they'd already gone disease? 

But one scenario _might happened_. confusing. much know! would probably ask people attended event instead person communicating news it. keep slightly turning forever? Finn here. app seems quite well received, course perfect. Anyway, see groups requiring installed order attends events. Furthermore, people tend unhesitantly report app alarmed them, often person may also go test.

In general, COVID situation really good Finland zero issues hospitalization. even declined ordering ventilators recently.

Finland sparsely populated country Europe, made handling pandemic definitely smoother. mask mandate Massachusetts numbers still spiking LMAO fair China outbreak started, lockdown draconian effective. east Asia well. wish people realized America though. Looking Reddit headlines, guess that's conclusion would come to, man... worldwide problem. People taking shit seriously across globe. 

But yes, America definitely spotlight shining it, kinda always does. totally surprising. Chinese government transparent worthy praise aspect, however, think second Western world would handled better I‚Äôm sure tell you. failed spectacularly, even headstart. president US listed ‚Äúending coronavirus‚Äù one accomplishments, can‚Äôt really boast transparency. think European countries would done right thing early on, open borders EU would doomed us same. countries would tried avoiding National embarrassment, like China. saw thing Spanish Flu. Plus adorable animal gifs. I‚Äôm cute kitties, support groups Lupus, reminiscing favorite TV shows. 

That‚Äôs big difference Reddit. aren‚Äôt subjected friend‚Äôs interests perspectives. get choose experience. escaping conflict Facebook. Someone going shove crap onto feed busts healthy boundaries. It‚Äôs like toxic relationship everyone know. convenient Pandemics sure hell do. 

Not seeing friends relatives causing everyone know become depresses, nothing government lockdowns. virus.

I gotta disagree you, looking thousands years history China, imperialistic nature. Chinese government wants improve people's lives good job. west that's demonizing China past 50 years. go preach Uyghurs &amp; organ harvesting anti-China topics, let ask this. stepped China talked local people, truly studied Chinese history &amp; culture, truly understand Chinese government/dynasties last 4000 years? 

Everything get's lost translation exaggerated comes west, clearly, west agenda discredit anything positive China twist even falsify narrative China using different system &amp; values. would thought many educated, wealthy people would act selfishly, promoting lockdowns protect themselves, resulting deaths many times greater due economic crises poorer countries abroad? guess comes it, progressives *actually* care brown people.

 went watching horror happening Italy still generally attitude ""It can't happen here"". cases popping nationally, seemed fairly contained point limited travelers/ tourists coming home abroad. 

A week later hear Westchester man positive virus suspected first case community transmission region. next day family neighbor got sick well. several people around NYC metro area may buildings point infected days later.

Two weeks later businesses schools locked down, hospitals overwhelmed. governors NY NJ pleading federal government help get enough ventilators, PPE, manpower help deal escalating outbreak. Thousands dying every day, tens thousands infected every day including front line medical experts overextended protected. Doctors pleading youtube, facebook, media help getting N95's essential PPE many wearing nothing bandanas garbage bags shield virus face masks, gowns, essential protective gear ran thin.

By May, curve leveling finally descending start summer, time 20,000 people NYC alone dead.

The point is, early days pandemic, know kind beast dealing enough resources place deal explosive outbreak many lessons learned employed states Texas Florida came hellish experience. 

When Southern Spike happened summer, hindsight, experiences, lessons learned NY NJ's spike earlier spring draw from, plenty time mobilize right amount equipment resources better handle outbreaks, better/ effective treatment methods learned doctors NY/NJ well abroad draw from, helped keep people alive. Agree. Dead people die, sad.

Disabled people need resources kept alive.

Same reason anti-personnel mines designed injure kill. think death rate always around 1%(0.7-1.5 range) get better handle diagnosing patients deaths, things begin line up. Whenever slow testing push, death rate goes up, beginning understood widespread disease was.

Well 100 years later, shit. people wear masks (the majority us) come side, ones don‚Äôt, well gamble. lot articles say ""no evidence"" gets spread food.

But also ""no evidence"" not.

Based know know, far better assume get eating IMO.  Thought said 2025? üòÇüòÇüòÇ one spreading misinformation. CDC says they're NOISH means they're approved CDC used health care setting. Dying Liberals addressing me? Smarter like Sweden? 

wtf talking about?!? 10 times number dead per capita example neighbor Norway. handled slightly less bad USA. fair yes, come long way treating virus. However. hospitalizations rapidly increasing country ability ship, example, nurses Ohio New Jersey. Rapid increase hospitalizations result worked appreciated medical staff results lapse judgement. supplies running low they'll pick choose gets treatment doesn't. big increase Fatalities due Yeah, doubt mask wearing putting pressure virus become contagious probably dangerous youre right. fundamental flaw America, seeing every day. hey HATE Orange guy, whatever, guess. change parameters. talking Ioannadis' poor quality work global IFR started talking US-specific IFR.

You addressed substance comment aside this. valid criticism West prepare advance virus. talking 2019 I'm talking since 2015. 

The problem seen real threat west didnt dealt pandemic since 1918, governments prepare it.

Trying prepare natural disaster impossible. prepare years advance. gonna happen middle pandemic. 

South Korea response MERS attrious. couldnt scale testing, ran masks, report virus spreading etc. 

But learned it. responded better, way better. stockpiled testing supplies undertook mass testing population. put contact tracing mechanism activated got hit again. 

The rest west trying replicate gonna happen pandemic full swing. It‚Äôs called federal funding.

And penalties refusal gives funds can't randomly assigned. simple mandate masks enforce get highway (or whatever) funding would stricken court. 

As South Dakota v. Dole five-point rule cuts constitutional. 

 1. spending must promote ""the general welfare.""
 2. condition must unambiguous.
 3. condition relate ""to federal interest particular national projects programs.""
 4. condition imposed states must not, itself, unconstitutional.
 5. condition must coercive.

That last point gets really That‚Äôs interstate highway speeding laws enforced across states.

Also thinking drinking age minimums states. Testing urban parts India showed high 50% rates infection, especially lower income areas. summer. SARS SARS-Cov 2 genetically extremely similar. Wow, really? Cause never think 9 [shit Uhh, vaccine-induced herd immunity? That... answer question.  Shop shops accept cash? Ones use cash issues. always get ones don't. definitely seems focused impact poor countries, yet see good answer need kill instead collectively sending extra hundred billion aid low income countries. U.S. alone spending trillions itself. past 24 hours 194 new hospitalizations reported, 19 new deaths reported, 1,536 people currently hospitalized. quite literally public information. It‚Äôs three counties high numbers

It's 3 counties state high populations. However, many counties seeing high infection rates per capita concerning Time buy projector, worship home! Thanks, too! worry annoys shit me!  Even countries handled extremely well still constantly struggling maintain good baseline they've established, suffering terrible economic damage while. We're walking knife's edge trying control fucking monster totally losing country way life. better job others absolutely one ""beaten"" virus - said, sustainable solution longterm. 

Make mistake, vaccine EVERYONE'S exit strategy. Everyone. know speaks russian broken english russia like movies, right lol. doctor must every single one hospitalizations imaginary ones well, around 10 patients hospitalized last week. enforced, barely abided. example, test people Turkey but:

* first months, announced around 40k tests day; half done people around president ruling party.

* July positive numbers went down, explanation really. anything special, people use masks general. mostly ""show"" tourism could go uninterrupted. 

* last month main opposition party announced proof real numbers 10 20 times official numbers.

* Minister Health confessed giving ""patient"" numbers actual positive numbers. means unlike countries Turkey announcing severe cases. 

What I'm trying say Turkey testing people either actively misleading local international public. happened Ukraine (since big money going tourism us them). I'm actually hopeful Maduro says found cure country even buy vaccines point. That's guys like think. bias idiots watching news day Source claims? lots scientists disagree wish best never wish bad folks think way optimistic ends 2 weeks. Getting ""herd immunity"" going mean lot folks small communities going die result. really hope happen, we've seen movie play northeast, FL, TX, ,AZ, gulf states, CA beginning middle end same. wonder advantages people take vaccine first many people still isolating cautious. Much less competition certain jobs? Get movie theaters, museums, amusements parks yourself? Oh Covid toes. burning like crazy, now. vanish quickly, much faster cities.

This put anything freaking places hit hard. burn hard fast bit settle way down, like largely done every place country previous months. ....and blaming people went clubbing lockdowns compete. France still schools nursing homes open. Half measures result half results. Hence flatten curve drop low. still need patients learn steady pace.

If want progress treatment steady supply patients crucial.

A vaccine enough. need good treatments ‚Äùone, two, knockout punch"". Wow. waste time &amp; money. Im big fan fracking i'm sure accounts lot jobs North Dakota. seems like could attempt keep people employed hard times. hard really critical that. 

If I'm wrong someone please explain me. ""Ending"" present continuous tense english language. like saying ""Playing tennis"". Unfortunately that's fact written word works.

Obviously done shit. write everything present continuous tense make look like technically still accurate.  Every single item present continuous tense ""ing"" end.

If said ""ended"" pandemic past tense. Vaccines provoke stronger andonger-lasting immune reponsenthan infection.

My guess get annually along flu shot. Nice thinking skills, asshole. I'm taking 2 months starting next Wednesday. people don‚Äôt get, doesn‚Äôt take many keep spread going. Americans failed test civic duty mask mandate enforcement answer. often readers confuse 'justified protestation' 'opportunistic dickheads'. get pain suffering lockdowns distancing really difficult? live CA, aren‚Äôt Karens yelling people trying bypass mask requirements putting people harm‚Äôs way. Everyone friendly respectful social distancing guidelines outdoor dining allowed restaurants.

Cases probably go point, I‚Äôm hoping won‚Äôt get bad. I‚Äôll start glad 180% decline. cases inevitably continue rise without action election, next talking point? mean, ~~perfect~~ normal world us Americans would wear masks due common decency. small minority choose ignore obvious... decency lies ‚Äúmuzzled‚Äù -_- 

A mandate (sadly) thing force anti-mask people actually wear mask. Ah shit go  think know treatment better days, much needed news. by-product leads problems, however: kept alive spend time hospital follows need care resources.

So, whichever way look it, increasing hospitalisations leads serious problems: either increasing loss life increasing demand resources needed elsewhere. pleasure getting army. Sent hospital day got it, got ill. Got shot ever since. thanks  Need certificate go home (like go buy groceries)

Papers, please. Whoa...that's evil.

Edited add: well, evil hitting systems involving patient care. hitting systems involving billing people, that's different story  can't even imagine frustrating must earnestly devote entire life discipline, become world-class expert build insanely impressive credible resume, end reporting absolute neanderthal thinks knows better despite giving moment's thought entire life. Herd immunity means nothing that's administration's willing do, hope would case first wave increase swabs lockdowns progressed. Meaning timing peak first wave unreliable.

Well. least hope. Especially people Reddit

Aren't better informed non-reddit people? point go back normal life immediately. there's vaccine horizon, I'm out. rank think Italy comes cases per capita? Take guess, without looking up. people essential jobs go work.

While sit desks home yeah? Good little servants running society argue online. know right?? like getting covid means instantly die, like people understand viruses work repeat stupid talking points. Yes, people know whether shut downs heavily depends part country one lives in. 

Florida fully open, governor said nothing shut Florida matter happens. 

We see happens ICUs fill again, wouldn‚Äôt surprised DeSantis fact let people die lack access ICU care. good time get sick hurt way.  **Update: Public Health France reports 250 new coronavirus reports nearly 48,000 new coronavirus cases, positivity rate approaching 20%

1 crore beer wall, 1 crore beer

If one lakh happen fall, 99 lakh beer wall This. much this. agree vast majority Americans wearing masks least sometimes. sheer number people willing hang two hours packed restaurant/bar maskless means whole Americans either (1) pandemic wear masks required concern virus spread (2) concerned virus still fully grasped connection virus spreading mask wearing actually needed. one control virus. People get it, spikes. Everyone loves blame random people see pain misery caused virus, anyone person group's fault. virus. learn treat people get hope pharma companies make great vaccines. That's really here, 3.5 yr old loves masks. lots people area refuse wear masks. drove applebee's recently 2 empty parking spots. could easily lot better. smaller weave cloth even N95 masks much larger weave wuhan faltering economy bloated federal reserve money collapses causes MUCH larger problem cause decades wide spread poverty risk losing place world superpower.  

Not mention GDP would strongly compete China putting stability US dollar used currency used trading oil eventually.

Nope. vote vaccines, lockdowns. could people's immune systems working should. make sounds like bad thing. Cheer up. evolutionary process still work. I'm told called triage, DP term banned here. admission cover rapid Covid testing fee? so, I‚Äôm going baby. realize there's stronger explanation food transmission, right? never doubt proper masks better, perfect enemy good; better everyone community using least cloth mask instead going without.

In Victoria Australia 3 layer cloth mask minimum, anything beyond gravy. Also people still clue happening 2 days. Town city halls receiving vague instructions next day different ones everyone's confused. 

I doubts whether strategy testing work us agree points, bridge live order Slovakia moment aware testing happening?

I know single person know family, among colleagues neighbors. someone TV, internet connection least Also there's chance get infected spot. 

This one big worries well, luckily part town testing sites outside one drive site well. also app people update many people queuing certain testing site bigger cities people encouraged check many people waiting. think pilot project Orava Bardejov villages streaming whole thing purpose. regards waiting, biggest risk getting infected come disrespecting social distancing rules people go get tested.

As much despise anti-mask activists, two suspects highly unlikely motivations.  Tough neighborhood, life cheap.  

If guilty charged, likely matter feeling ""dissed"" told do, New Zealand basically locks get 1 case. we're supposed do? long? Basically virus completely disappear order drop restrictions ever go back?

And people take seriously there's vaccine one limited effectiveness restrictions last forever? burning like crazy, now. vanish quickly, much faster cities. communities smaller spread out, herd immunity small towns much faster.

Mask culture not, wave evaporate 14 days.  need rude, stating estimates based vaccination works effectively. called Operation Warp Speed never done timeframe.

Regardless, indeed personal opinion claim healthcare professional. 100% would love wrong never hear damn virus enjoying outside.

Personally might surprising, I'm actually permanent lockdowns. needs point health economy balanced, frankly 2021 repeat year, there's going local businesses/foodservice entertainment left besides major corporations like Amazon McDonalds. Best wishes. Masks prevent spread COVID contribute saving lives, least preventing others getting sick. means masking public necessity. 

Anyone refuses ""muh freedoms"" clear present risk public health period national (international) emergency, treated such. people therefore right ""express opinion"" directly seriously threatens health people. 

Wear mask. Wear mask, criminally charged. time governments stop pussyfooting around-- **if kooks actually start trying kill people this, deal extreme prejudice part law enforcement.** Another smart move opening discos... would die thirst. Wisconsin, half counties say enforce it. Injection? Please read article.

Probability false negative minimum 20%, probability false positive low. Probably way less 0.5%. needs many outweigh needs few. Yayyyyyy widespread reports people thinking reinfected. Ive seen lots people say been. 

What lot proven cases, probably barely anyone gets infection sequenced strain, required prove it. 

And u known whether B cells enough prevent reinfection. make immunological sense. That's literally T-cells B-cells do. shown countless studies memory coronavirus getting it. That's really  Funny bring up. 

There 7 HCoV.

2 easy control ""bad viruses"" (ie basically doomed start). Sars-Cov-1 MERS

The 4 endemic HCoV well could pandemic origins. 

It long theorized deadly ""Russian Flu"" may OC43 causes common cold.

It likely probable many ""common cold"" viruses ""pandemic origins"" emerged.

The reason deadly pandemic old people. prior exposure Sars-Cov-2 childhood makes vulnerable.

So ""viral burnout"" mean extinct: going happen. Ever. Sars-Cov-2 humanity forever. 


If mean ""burnout"" though virus longer pandemic level and/or becomes mild common cold endemic virus yes happened 4 HCoV. Indoor staying alone home perfectly fine. big number, kind expected point. I'm much concerned hospitalization rates deaths. keep exploding, we'll successful. Yes, 1,000 deaths day bad, flaring country. hitting well figure isolated highly populated hot spots. going stop this, better. make difference testing ability looking number hospitalizations/ICU beds filled. Basically everyone wants become New York City  think that's doing.

_""the mass screening, makes use rapid antigen tests produce results within 30 minutes""_

This Also, places mask mandates. realize there's substantial difference vaccinating people first world countries place like Mongolia, right? weak, stay home. Let's governments destroy lives pointless lockdown. Italy never closed history, neither Black plague. ‚ÄúThe man arrived emergency room Childress earlier month COVID-19, serious abdominal condition required surgery, hospital administrators said.

The man waited nine hours emergency room doctors called eight larger hospitals see could perform surgery, said Holly Holcomb, chief operating officer Childress Regional Medical Center. declined accept patient, said, man died.‚Äù ROFL - us actual engineers scientists (not frauds politics claiming experts) saying ***the entire time***.  Side effects show everybody. surprising run mill jackass even begin reach level decent human being. clever. funny. even worth getting mad over. pathetic, pity sad existence. never understand anyone even begin compare wearing mask, seatbelt etc. tyranny. Idk live, live, lockdown April. virtually restrictions enforced now, despite skyrocketing case numbers. elementary deduction really acceptable science, save creating hypothesis. I'm gonna ask source, preferably paper saying probable route transmission. Unless tests countries way positive picking dead virus particles?

It strange, agree. next stimulus bill, attach funding states provided enforced mask mandate. Sounds like FDA panel experts exerting power show can't pushed around, extra geezers die, well that's price science. 

I would think embarrassing EU Canada approves vaccine first. Disney World Florida still opened. guess shows Florida much better job controlling covid French. Important post ^

Lots people underestimate many people are. It‚Äôs easy look 50,000 new cases day think ‚Äúmy god, rate infected let‚Äôs get with‚Äù far, far case said Taiwan island many people 1 US state. compare US states per capita. example, US whole hard hit New Jersey, US would report almost 600k deaths. NYC peak, ambulances drove hours, hospital hospital, hours idling outside one hospital, trying get patient bed ‚Äî within one city.

Imagine thing, it‚Äôs big Texas. gonna happen. Deal it. one save you. Yep, definitely overkill probably helpful, get kick reason ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Never say never, 

Here Europe People we're screaming another lockdown never going happen. Yet are, probably 1 2 nights country goes back Lockdown.

Im pro it, feeling certain point th√© country choose, Lockdown signs start pointing another wave (Germany) wait couple weeks hope population Starts take measures enforce closings. (Belgium)

Obviously cant compare EU usa, vent shitstorm ahead us. Ok  I‚Äôm dumb dumb, someone plz explain random ware used something like this?  agree. political reality millions need children school keep working.  
But excuse utter incompetence government. curfew followed 2 weeks later panicky lockdown truly shocking, Paris total shitshow right now, real risk massive social political unrest. you‚Äôre willing spec design, I‚Äôd happily pay demo setup. Yeah 500 years back majority wanted kill [edit: some] women witchcraft ... 
btw: comes masks mandatory Europe months months still cases surging ? So... read Wired article. California fairly strict targeted lockdowns sure mean. Correct. think appropriate way looking would we've minimized contact meaning people getting infected probably getting infected sources instead dozens.

Mentally, keep coming back cockroach analogy. takes immune system recognize virus attack it. similar kitchen dark flipping switch seeing cockroach. see one two cockroaches turn light, I'm going take targeted approach find they're coming eradicate spread. flip switch see hundreds scatter, I'm fogging damn house, hell whatever else might get killed along way. immune system single goal, kill identified cells. gets overloaded inputs, going take ""nuclear"" approach, rather targeted approach, hell whatever cells might get killed along way. also Vitamin plays critical role this, acts regulator immune system, ramping also ramping down. deficient hard system ramp time recognize threat, also gets going, almost impossible put brakes. I‚Äôm sure. also tends kill old people cities tend younger. numbers might work favor. incoming Democratic administration

Sounding like 2016 again. mean, hope right, HUGE assumption make. agree US really isn‚Äôt bad job compared numbers. Couple questions concerning possible herd immunity. Deaths per million SA around 300, European countries USA 600 deaths per million currently entering 2nd wave explosion cases resemblance herd immunity. 

Either deaths extremely reported SA somehow SA medical system vastly superior USA Europe.  simply complete bullshit. Yeah independent cinema. Never usually get dick heads there. go mainstream one fair 32? what? Cause excact change doesn‚Äôt carry virus. That's looking less likely last time said it. Yeah remember coronavirus burned out..../s That's exactly happened wife. 

My best friend though lost 30lbs breathe well. still breathing problems coughs laughs. Much much higher daily flu deaths 300-1500% depending year too. Virus sheds nasal breathing might well unmasked. apparently existing vaccines, including flu vaccine, also help Coronavirus Operation Warp Speed ‚Äúexaggerated‚Äù timeline. Third-phase trials taking longer supposed ‚Äî ironically, volunteers haven‚Äôt catching fast thought. That‚Äôs way measure efficacy many people: many people get exposed. 

And FDA cautious countries; possible bad outcomes arose among participants, countries investigated two weeks resumed trials. US ‚Äî waiting five weeks longer resuming.

So: add couple months least recent projections. 

The good news we‚Äôve got three vaccines destined US market entering 3rd-phase trials. gyms good air conditioning? article mentions form ventilation think Well no, remote island even insulated COVID still prevent second wave. reluctance admit time vaccine available western world already entered viral burnout. Approval late 2020 too... meh article guess new strategy contributing rise number covid cases. radical idea. going back old strategy? necessarily. Although yearly vaccination would annoying could done. I've self-imposing mask mandate, make official all! would mention Gilead lobbyist part Trump coronavirus task force remdesivir blessed Fauci ""standard care.""

But according moderators here, that's political comment.

A factual statement task force ""political.""

We allowed note government approved drug. supposed ignore facts relevant approval. Yeah think true. 

But think problems bigger. Look Bill Gates ted talk, world ill prepared pandemic. 

But Asia hit many novel disease outbreaks recently surprise better prepared everything place better contain disease. 

Rest world. need prepare better next time going haphazardly deal outbreak. late prepare now, react. It‚Äôs peculiar northerly latitude would expect UK ahead. France Italy poor social distancing/masking compliance? people least pay lip service restrictions help correct age masks required? French anyone age 6. US, believe anyone age 2. sure countries doing. 

What science say children masks. age masks necessary? not. I'm sorry not. matter much want be. much evidence immunity probably long lasting chalk small amount reinfections factors like bad immune system. 40k reported cases. 762k population. That's 5% North Dakotans front page. ""3 regions receive new advice. Rapidly deteriorating situation."" risk go purple week metrics started plateau. Currently meeting 4 Inb4 maskless man ends CNN recovering long hospital stay. Yes, whilst fantastic news, certain people use study go ""sEe fLu, dEaDlY"". Current rates infection Europe US quite concerning wonder long certain countries/states health systems begin fail. Good bot. even talking per capita cases wondering I'm calling disingenuity? ya go get moron...and end wiht long term side effects.

this isnt lottery winning ok lottery losing. \*supposed\* achieve heard immunity getting everyone vaccinated, getting everyone infected crossing fingers.

Have learned nothing? I'm conversation ongoing developments. Recent news stories portrayed chances successful vaccine still toss up. I'm happy corrected learn something new. Spoilers: they'll continue fuck us decades poor continue die

Fuck no, second highest mental health professional, we're available, lots us entering field, one wants pay us see population. Since there's government healthcare coverage US (except extremely poor, disabled age 65) way access mental health services insurance still often costly patient reimburses provider low rates, ton money pay pocket best therapists take insurance. struggle make decent living therapist many leave field end working life. moved away role direct counseling paid little really burns fast something emotionally taxing top deal constant financial problems. government wanted take care people offered good federal jobs benefits mental health workers, people would line fill positions. literally happened BLM protests 

Explain. Yeah. Even knowing bad government fucked everything up. First world countries normal shape much faster then. takes cases spike, traveling certainly went down, know rural areas get hit last population density... Fauci says public health guidelines remain vaccine approval

a lot people sub: got epic think lower inoculum going shown big time player road. also better therapeutic protocols March killing people ventilators. long keep hospitals overwhelmed, think really good chance weather quite well compared spring. That's big if, though. 1 3 LMAO

And thats playing min max. 7DMA 0 week ago. point possibility containment. Everywhere outbreaks vaccines work herd immunity works. let people exercise liberty travel, someone going bring BANG goes next wave infections. See nobody believe you. guy references goddamn Drudge Report Daily Mail, far-right hack jobs, take gospel. know FDA approves useless things election.

quote article

"" argument earlier use it, better great realize implications are: won‚Äôt save many lives, you‚Äôll treat lot patients. It‚Äôs inconvenient, it‚Äôll cost fortune. ""

Gilead knew potential result study negotiated EU sell drug, hid knowledge bad faith secure deal study out. outrageous corporate greed finest. everyone politically motivated.

This matter ""you're boss me."" masks per se. 

This poor violent neighborhood.  straight Wire. Fuck. Off. 

The government two weeks, became months. Lockdowns cannot become one time thing. sustainable sense word government *will* abuse power allowed believe hit lockdown button whenever. think otherwise naive, stupid, both.

It one time thing flatten curve. another one. Universal mask wearing may end effective vaccine. uptick could become surge? would signal Third Spike?  least Wave. Herd immunity still long way off. 

So far France around 1.3 million cases population 67 million. Even estimated case numbers 7 million still leaves 60 million people. 

Herd immunity would mean 36 million cases. double daily case numbers 100,000 day still *one year* get herd immunity.

Which would also mean around 90,000 additional deaths maintained 250 deaths per day (which unlikely, would doubt increase health services become overwhelmed). lasting 2 weeks. gonna much. point being, thing everyone turn. time patting people back good job least six months, possibly 18 months now. Crowing USA sucks r/prematurecelebration. God forbid anybody go without Halloween one year is. 'Same England. absolute disaster get worse. They're 61st per capita cases.

So... One way pick heavily infected area test, vaccinate participants high risk exposure categories. could essential worker, someone self reports contact lot people every day, front line worker, someone living large household multiple residents work, etc. people higher chance exposure say, someone retired sheltering place.  make immunological sense. That's literally T-cells B-cells do. 

There seems confusion here. asking opinion misinformation. telling immune system works. That's B cells work. lack memory B cell particular pathogen, protective immunity. cells respond way upon initial exposure time takes APC activation cells negligible compared amount time needed generate antibody response. antibody response take couple weeks IgG class switched, somatically hypermutated antibodies generated. shown countless studies memory coronavirus getting it. 

Here's 35 years worth data summed showing reinfection seasonal coronaviruses occurs frequently 12 months post-initial infection.  k feel free continue discounting oppression women quest religious freedom :)  Unofficially, top 3 large countries based deaths. course they'll drag feet. colleges right refuse arbitration breaking contract (perks included contracts).

Good bot Or, hear out, government could waited woth banning abortions pandemics over? mean time everything mitigate spread. know sadly large groups ignoring things. places world much lower spread cases real spread all, outbreaks quelled. follow measures across country could save tens hundreds thousands people reach permanent measures. difficult stuff. really argument anti mask wearing crowd. I'm mood discuss this. even deleted got reply.

Stay safe, formerly liberal lady. think happening lot places. letter written French full snark nature. think see peak whole pandemic. Mid-spring far away already 500k cases day. big wave, think pandemic vaccines working. Yeah said bs back still stupid literally say anything USA literally overlook entire world course they're going say 2022

Did say something new? changes nohing Taiwan domestic case 200 days. high population density too.

Physical ""droplets"" involved either case, there's size gradient. yes, AFAIK COVID requires airborne precautions. don‚Äôt simply wear masks??? month ago Italy behind Germany per capita basis. sad see virus spread accelerated faster there, yet government taken real measures. saying curfews effect, actually think detrimental since forced everybody pack restaurants, bars activities time lot people. people brand us monsters holding death every 90 year old huge tragedy.  People still somehow think lockdowns work rational people see disaster fail every level? Maybe one Texas would send military national guard. Like 60+% people refuse wear mask go everywhere know say loves limelight.

and still say Gdansk's suppressobot coders lost touch confirmed (as far know anyway...) believe France currently testing symptomatic people whereas testing anyone came contact trace. 

  
No. Testing widespread. Positivity rates ALARMING many weeks, lockdown arriving least month late. pumpkin rots. scarecrow continue stand tall. feel bad everyone missed lifetime milestones like things.

I friend postponed wedding twice now. matter now. one seem subject selection pressure. Asymptomatic spreaders time becoming contagious discovering seem indicate bug already challenge figured out.  would place worship; know people saying I'm wrong. People clearly know much Well know, often country, law says something nobody follows it. employer cannot illegally fire coming work state forbids to, cannot force get test want to/can't. 
But course, anyway. Pretty sure 2020 already several hundred years couple hundred go. Yeah strange thread remember predictions 2.2 million americans dead year clearly happen. thread that? worked election close one state decided it. Hopefully issue year. Centers Disease Control Prevention projected worst-case scenario 160 million 210 million cases December. forecast, 21 million people would need hospitalization 200,000 1.7 million¬†could die end year. Health officials cautioned models infection rate vary widely.¬†

So essentially we're lower side predicted deaths...in words, good job response. Good know. I'm tired whataboutism. Please vote!! That's entire logic rural MI. I've heard conversation billion fucking times cashier person front me: ""Can't wait till election take damn masks off!"" jerk over. knowingly lied spread misinformation using position authority gain reach. 

Trump thousand times Google Donald Trump Net Worth. 2.5 billion dollars. Also, debt often seen smart financial decision. college economics/accounting/business class teach this. mixed ‚Äòhurr durr hErD ImmUnITy going‚Äô morons? I'm stating long national mask mandate included religious exemptions, would allowed constitutionally PHSA. middle winter. know. Competing ideas annoying right??? think  
new admission - discharged - deceased = 383 tie funding (relief case) existence enforcement mandate. mask mandate, relief checks. Hey man, people freeze death wearing coats. Coats simply work. can't live life afraid cold. activities outside without coat whatever happens, happens. mask mandate would help tremendously, would halve cases deaths

But yes, it‚Äôs going get worse. Trump openly taken herd immunity (which impossible) route - aren‚Äôt even attempting slow spread. going lose another 200,000 January Yeah, helpful restrict travel Sweden sure. Next need also build wall northern border keep Swedes out! ^(/s) fifteen million dollar bribe took China says otherwise.

That reason 400 million dollar debt bad leverage. foreign countries debt say, something America's interest reduce debt.

The way raise enough money pay debt keeping presidency. TV channel stuff BS. enough money start TV channel. gets investors provide money, would get much profits.  Could mean virus mutated less dangerous? find hard imagine federal mandate would encourage people wearing masks Arguments know online, keeps coming up. Somedays, 14 day rolling average go from, say, 12.5% 12.3% number, graph doesn‚Äôt change. doesn‚Äôt go down. Usually, next day jump considerable amount. I‚Äôve got dude keeps harping fact go every small amount that‚Äôs sign could leveling off. We‚Äôre not. again, argument having, peace mind, anyhow know wiggle happens? Wow, Fauci dumb. Can't even accurately predict death count. even listening guy? Without financial support (which Congress seems reluctant provide), options ensure compliance strict lockdown slim. Even use force (using military, example), you‚Äôd accept (probably pretty high) likelihood shootouts occurring among armed populace. Given current political states‚Äô financial climate, don‚Äôt see soft lockdowns (let alone anything genuinely strict) coming foreseeable future. look prep worked us üòî Religious exemptions usually based long standing, sincere religiously motivated cause. 

I never heard single Christian complain wearing mask life leader Trump told to. 

That's politically motivated decision, religious one. 

Being evangelical mean get pick choose laws follow. Trump like, bet would use famous people afford better treatment indicator this? 

I thought issues happened people even didnt get Covid bad? even people didnt get treatment issues, right?

Anyways .. treatment giving famous people giving amazing outcomes? seems like would kind ""cure Covid"" working well people, right?

Why make tons that, instead trying invent whole new vaccine? Yes agree EVERYTHING needs locked down. probably closer you. 

As stimulus two thoughts universal stimulus. Number one, government sucks execution means tested programs always bureaucratic disasters. mention going miss guy earned 300k 2019 lost job. listening podcast - Blindspot, Road 9/11 - one conclusions distracted lots domestic stuff along way, provided opportunity plot develop advance. (The 2000 election one major ones.)

Then began wondering internal craziness opens us vulnerable outside attacks - physical terrorist attacks hopefully monitored better back then, obviously cyber attacks harder aware of.

It worries greatly Trump knock-on effects causing massive domestic strife could distracting us making us vulnerable foreign actors could take advantage that. Russia biggest one, maybe? article least partially validates concern. feel like read US sold billions dollars worth PPE China early days covid. anyone know accurate?

Edit: Ish. 17.8 tons donated medical supplies including respirators masks, according state dept back early Feb. Anything says, conservatives lick like dribbled asshole. right, say it, true them. They're colossal idiots.

Oddly enough, inability question Trump makes country vulnerable weak. He's huge fool, fool trump fool entire conservative party, followers believe without skepticism. rest Republican party can't go they'll lose precious votes year may flip several seats Democrat.   Oh man mods probably remove post, purely political kind hard talk without discussing politics, know, since government thing said government made political first place Haha. Good one. eat, go broke

Our government plenty money things, without needing go work. literally work - reason want us work profits *them*. oh ok SARS MERS survivors still immunity decade later. proven ""lifelong"" because, well, long enough, decade long time say? actually one posted article summer (it removed obvious reasons). I‚Äôll first admit wrong. still think question ‚Äúwhat fuck want us do?‚Äù still stands though. 

Basically whole argument live virus, i.e. shutdowns. bicker buzzwords like ‚Äúherd immunity‚Äù whatever, two simple facts lockdowns hurt virus going away. need sustainable plan accomodates facts

Edit: spring summer. even seasons anyways people died obesity diabetes alone covid.

But fat fucks care. I'm pretty sure nobody sub ever seen anybody wear mask pubic people day age can‚Äôt accept somethings fucking happen. Grew watching everyone always blaming someone else. everything someones fault. remember ‚Äúaccidents‚Äù. fucking asteroid could hit tomorrow people would blame someone. think absolute alarmist totally wrong. 

Here saying. 

‚ÄúI believe man wrong person run country. end don‚Äôt win election need act like third world country violent overthrow leadership. Process damned‚Äù

Not mention comment decline wrong. 

Last year last 4 years bottom 20% earners seeing higher wages growth demographic top 0% close 0% time frame. 

So respect opinion Donald likely support 80%+ criticisms man ‚Äúdecline‚Äù right. 

Furthermore fascist policies seeing? far day day life unchanged less regulation country continues improve issues like emissions beating every country world. 

I understand want change change happens time leading way. But, honestly, want put cold.

That's sounding like best option sadly...  source gave November 15 date? asking seen before. real issue, frankly reason economy issue, government left us fend zero financial legal support.

The real problem, IMO, one listened early April called federal liquidity flood apartment rental hotel markets along propaganda campaign folks sorting out. 

Herd immunity would lot safer. yes, masks, social distancing, still place, shutdowns severe. Depends count well Relying herd immunity defense coronavirus like relying appetite defense hungry bear. ""The bear threat he's eaten enough full"". Get N95 take indoors. Pretty sure dropped 0 estimate. Everyone saying 2mil march thats like 50 times lower isnt think even root problem fines. Infection Protection Act (Smittskyddslag) cover widely implemented limitation basic freedoms, example Germany - put areas size living quarter quarantine infectious people, whole city even region. legal base penalty-based systems.If it, think could use ""civil"" guards (vakter) collect fines. Even Germany fines could contested. determine 1.99 another person allowed 2.00 m. average 1,100/day sounds right

That‚Äôs quite optimistic, considering first big peak averaged like 2000 day (all virus mostly limited northeast) Yeah, that's COVID cases skyrocketing United States, people *in favor* wearing masks. Maybe. I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll facing charges gets out.

What does? He‚Äôs going martyr. april 2022 Almost Europe COVID free open beginning June... State Supreme Courts ones order local law enforcement/Sheriffs enforce masks mandates.

Until State Supreme Courts order it......nothing done. ...and law enforcement enforce mandate, state considered violation statute receive funding. others probably down, like regular flu, traffic sports related deaths. Yes accurate, better official figures already distorted purpose Damn Spaniards, France build wall ask Spain pay it.

Seriously though, need know infectious actually is, fatal is. It‚Äôs called federal funding. That‚Äôs interstate highway speeding laws enforced across states.

Don‚Äôt follow federal speed limit laws? Well road maintenance you! Yes, use stable pods one teacher possible. course done many (most?) places. Also want windows open even winter.  I'd psyched case. Yep fooled me! course, Independent States America. name really. Good thing Sweden experience heavy outbreak elder care sector spring. Read Stephen King‚Äôs Stand? Evil loves good pandemic üíÄ responding article comments? followed link specific comment might missing context.

I see claims media blowing proportion reinfection impossible, even unlikely. say decline antibodies normal headline little opinionated, countered claims except voice disappointment.

I get it, life sucks world going shit, experts actually wrong? so, how? Hey,

Listen,

You go work, sit down, job, like that, hey, goes away, like that, amazing it, just, go job, sit down, gone, like people power poors convinced it‚Äôll fine people risk take precautions, though others accepted people going die it‚Äôs okay since risk factors anyway. yet don‚Äôt advocate social services people risk don‚Äôt work pandemic. absolutely ridiculous. Soon, allowed compare Solomon Islands. spread catches well. 

Mate, absolutely correct can‚Äôt compare far far north Sweden Berlin. virus really doesn‚Äôt care unpopulated areas. attacks densely populated urban places called cities. Like southern third Sweden. Berlin.

Urbanisation, i.e. people living urban densely populated areas:
* Sweden: 88% living urban areas
* Germany: 77.5% living urban areas

So, people living cities Sweden Germany. 

Please God, let world understand national population density irrelevant large areas deserts, forests tundra nobody lives. 

Sorry lashing you. I‚Äôm fed people using total population national population density measure important coronavirus. don‚Äôt think true. leftist militias right sure participated riots.

Man militias don‚Äôt give shit side they‚Äôre on. want see violence. Hahahahahahaha 500k deaths total, 500k new deaths may want lose can't lose. 

The minute loses going get charged multiple crimes multiple jurisdictions. minute loses longer steal money take bribes debt becomes impossible pay. mention minute loses might get Epsteined. 

I doubt want president desperate. out.

When people say would anything stay power, right. respect opinion, point talking matter degrees intensity, really disagreeing.  know what‚Äôs funny. Democrat Governor said he‚Äôll lift restrictions Nov 4. Oddly enough that‚Äôs day election early know happen long term, positive negative. Resolved cases could stay resolved, resurgence longer-term problems dealt previously, present yet unknown complications future.

So point would able say ""There major permanent complications""?

Would everyone Covid today live entire life, 70 - 80 years would confident say ""Well looks like permanent complications"".

But ....

*What children*.?!?!

So wait Covid patients children, watch children grow old die, 100 years finally say ""Well doesnt seem like permanent issues Covid""? ‚ÄúHerd immunity‚Äù general epidemiological term infection stops spreading enough population immune. It‚Äôs agnostic immunity happens. real covid lockdowns work

How one explain Italy, France, Spain, Philippines (strictest lockdown world) cases skyrocketing again. going proponent permanent lockdowns? people start accept reality thing never truly go away many viruses humanity faced? took U-Bahn Munich today three times. walk one end train. saw one person mask nose, one person saying goodbye someone else platform mask all. Everybody else (probably 200 so) masks wore correctly See that‚Äôs good Trump is... Fauci said 200,000 Trump‚Äôs already beaten that. 15 0 right? mean big news, since would assume forced close due lockdown?

I guess good let public know random tourists complaining outside gate wondering can't go Halloween rides. Probably correlated attitudes person rather masks. Probably correlated attitudes policies rather masks. Sunetra Gupta suggested UK may already reached herd immunity spring. hoisted skeptics respected medical expert afraid tell real truth. So, comments square rising cases, hospitalizations deaths? Everything except hospitals shut again. quarantine least another three years. go away, magic quarantine. bit googling found Portugal one less wealthy Eastern European countries, Slovakia par Portugal. Slovakia pulled ahead Eastern European countries. 

But agree spirit comment. Slovakia wealthy compared to, say, Norway Switzerland. Heard 8 months ago data back up? specific types masks? assessment probably spread infection 10 percent last spring.

Every time Tegnell announces ""assessment"" like this, turns reality much worse said. Excuse believe *I think important, see large spread infection Sweden, whether call second wave uninteresting.* 

Also ‚ÄúI think main difference Sweden many countries kind restrictions recommendations place whole time. ""And makes difference, makes us hopefully less susceptible second wave.‚Äù course uninteresting Tegnell... second wave proves approach failure, let's even talk that... *Of course follow question closely, see increase age groups almost all. long is, stay. case belong risk group, must make risk assessment.* 

It's translated Swedish English, let translate Tegnellese...

""We've watching, number dead old people really embarrassing moment, anything? Old people would likely die catch it, that's problem... they're *I agree level* 

Sometimes wonder guy knows he's full shit, simply deluded? mean surely guy can't actually believe bullshit? Ship saudi arabia punishment phase know *nuance* is? Belgium 465k tests last week. positivity rate 25%. bad indeed

Source: People legit can't math correctly (honestly combining decimals percents without moving decimal point know better), falsely calculate reported deaths **against population** instead known case totals. Thus get '0.1%' (or even 0.07%) calculating total population US. I've fucking worked cybersecurity dude, know targets America target. I've seen first hand, conspiracy theory. chance it‚Äôs long üòÇ can‚Äôt serious. want compare hundred people millions?

Edit: Europe testing, tracing isolating small outbreaks, wouldn‚Äôt massive outbreak now. Indeed - 4 airline jets full people crashing daily terms death (was 6-8 peak)...imagine planes crashing often. compulsive liar says must true, mind data says, mind doctors say! 

My coworkers definitely going get sick eventually, dangerous cult üòû Someone traveling across country attend massively crowded events people screaming without masks? Lol. Rules? Shhh you‚Äôre going almighty narrative! present options right?

‚ÄúAfter consulting experts listening views x, taking consideration y, decided z course action benefits a, b c vs detriments d, e f.‚Äù updates change recommendations circumstances change, rationale why.

Sure, there‚Äôs accountability take you‚Äôre wrong right, least that‚Äôs leadership shown, whatever govt now. Well Fauci factor Trump Kusher psychopaths undermining science every opportunity wonder too. think it‚Äôll take concrete numbers. sad Source information ? 


And still 2 months left year. It‚Äôs bullshit. Cases also places mask mandates. mask mandate comment obviously call back original comment used example simple public health measure help curb problem, return us normalcy faster.

And obviously saying ""throw caution wind allow normal life return"" simply regardless restrictions, normal life return faster. save lives. Yes is.

Edit: read rule 3.

I‚Äôm sorry even got discussion. thought reason posting news three times wasn‚Äôt seeing. sure true. Texas's healthcare system especially Houston stretched summer brink disaster millions articles posted sub believed death rate significantly lower similarly hard hit places beginning pandemic.

A lot known thing, parroting heard echo chamber necessarily make smart. Questioning everything sides forming conclusions makes smart. Americans would rather die admit theyre wrong. Literally. Trump administration ended pandemic? read somewhere news. problem moment everything opens spread start again. States cities wont complay.Vaccines work, never able get provide enough long term immunity. drug manufacturers would loved able sell flu covid vaccines successful.

Taking vaccine every 3 months leads higher risks side effects vs annual flu vaccine.

Bottom line need learn live virus. Hey man give break. pointed still better Czech! wind create amount jobs? put windmills. know lot people moved dakotas oil related jobs. could see mass exodus shifted wind. figure way tax companies wind power use ways draw people state. Especially work home thing states incentivizing people move away big cities. Lol yes do. US numbers terrible. Trump lie, would tell lie makes look terrible? 

Plus US democracy totalitarian control independent scientific bodies. There's also permenate heart damage 
Permenate lung damage.
Possibility stroke.  
Chronic fatigue. 
Cognitive impairment.

But ok experiencing large amounts work force economy becoming disabled.... well good you, im glad walking, talking pos.

Population US something like 310 MILLION people... small percentages effect lot Americans hey, 2 4 million people complications death... thats biggie right? Taiwan Number 1! people Czech Republic call international thing? completely failed answer question virtue signalling. follow instructions state authorities matter restrictive undemocratic long tell save lives? 25% seems low. reporting,
Not testing dead, counting pneumonia cases maybe Covid related. counting countless heart attack deaths people contracting virus never tested. Actually average number deaths total year less compared last year.

Just saying. unqualified, evidenced hearing, part cult believe women submissive men, says law means bring Kingdom God. past rulings paint vivid picture.

I nothing women politics, one. Sweden pursue herd immunity strategy. Please stop spreading lie. It‚Äôs actually still March 100-something. economy scale make easier larger countries? point always seems come up, tell first waves second waves? actually still first wave, peaks happened April summer called? Seems 2 pretty distinct peaks, arent considered separate waves? that? dishonest reporting. Cases also places mask mandates. See: France, Spain, Italy, etc. solution minor technical issue consider asymptomatic children low risk contacts test them, way numbers proving children infected prove schools safe.

(Also missed /s comment replied to). I've tried explaining people think fake overblown. I'm like ""you work cars living. really know world-renowned infectious disease expert 40 years""? usually respond ""lol"" something. thought sweden gave advice recommendations. Aren‚Äôt restrictions law. I‚Äôm confused virus? told done with. Realistically 40% american believing COVID made up, could done 4-6 weeks longer possible Sweden pursue herd immunity strategy. 
That said it‚Äôs decent article worth reading. Thanks. Much cheaper economic disaster job losses covid gets control. true, theoretically. vast majority people US adhered rules intense shutdown, importantly, followed rules regarding masks distancing fact.

However, overall collective far gone even remote possibility. Pandemic fatigue, mental capacity issues, political/group beliefs, personal freedom mentalities, belief narratives carefully designed manipulation control, belief narratives launched psychological warfare campaigns several months ago Twitter FB, belief hoax, etc. etc. goes on.

At best, see lockdowns certain areas counties states face massive outbreaks hospitals nearing, at, capacity. Possibility lockdown state control sure there, matter bad things get Dec, Jan, Feb 2nd wave (not 3rd mainstream media keeps pushing - design purpose - wake up, folks) US country would need damn near collapse national lockdown happen again. time decision made, damage already done anyway.

Stay safe stay educated (not politicians mainstream media - follow science) there, folks. pay close attention happening local area - especially mentality lack thereof around get gage things headed backyard wave 2 (don‚Äôt fall wave 3 BS mainstream media spreading.) I'm fairly pro-mask, listen scientists complete cop-out talk negatives choices have. choices fairly strict regulations NY California hope best Texas Florida. Living NY, assure life sunshine roses there; virus less worry many business dying pretty big budget hole result lot essential services cut. right answer government listens scientists everything better. sacrifice livelihoods save lives. No. havent crossed border recently, past spot checks border Police permanent postings. borders simply big many people work across border, intended EU law. many people allowed, people certain group sizes, etc. mess. god, comments thread :/ Absolutely correct, antibodies last months year never herd immunity people get reinfected over. Best case need annual vaccinations (maybe even one every 6 months) gone away. gone away - every person animal Earth longer COVID-19, flair again. study done university healthcare system New York three different hospitals, looked approximately 5,100 hospitalizations,‚Äù Dr. Jospeh Gastaldo OhioHealth said. ‚ÄúThey really showed significant drop adjusted mortality rate. showed **18 percent decreased chance dying**, mortality, looked people dying COVID-19 hospitalized March 2020, comparing August also attributes declining mortality rates number factors including fact communities taking better care vulnerable populations. also says doctors hospitals learning treatments care COVID-19 patients. think much money pay actors play infected dead. mean paycheck Trump family play along probably tremendous. agree needs happen resistance let it. Businesses contractors find loopholes keep working essential badge. landscape company work skipped beat since outbreak. work properties grocery store medical purpose therefore essential. assure lawns cross get front doors need machete clear path blackberry. place would suffered bad landscapers full force keep becoming exponential cost clean things eased up. really necessary time traveling city city within 3 counties. blows mind small example work. People lack foresight. 3 weeks shitty vacation year restrictions slowly choke us death. hey it'll election right?! Sorry rant disagree. requirements organization ambition, small size wealth. 

Here US governor state territory. Surely governor could organize large testing push. could organize testing states done time. France could region.  month ago. Fauci's estimates probably assumed federal government would attempt manage crisis according baseline level effort good faith. I'm sure Trump &amp; Co's ineptitude outright negligence blown past even pessimistic fears. bullshit. Lol case closed then. good one! would thought 5 months best case scenario. - becasue healthcare system overloaded heading back storm. hospitials run, quality care becomes rare people die otherwise easily saved heart attacks, strokes, etc resources beyond capacity course toll impact doctors nurses assuming uneducated politics sighted partisan trope women would unqualified sit bench despite taking exact line judge take prior hearing case. would like criminal judge telling everyone immediately throw every murder jail regardless basis case. Would want argue innocence front judge? They‚Äôre banning non-essential travel. border workers probably go back forth. Quarantining another matter. Legit people deluded idea need 'a purge' weak doubt influencing opinions pandemic. Last week average 67000 tests per day. Information /u/Pioustarcraft outdated month. long nwo, almost get shiny Darwin Award you‚Äôre first thousand vaccine! Remember suggested (by certain group people can't name due sub's rule) ridiculous unrealistic number meant fearmonger, H1N1's 12,000 deaths different administration way worse?

Good times anyone articles relates how/if person transmit COVID post recovery others? wife negative many weeks. impression go gym (no mask), go bars, go hangout large gatherings, etc. resume normal life can't transmit family. tried googling articles support opposite find much. anyone articles share? maybe isn‚Äôt hot take think is. Everyone failed. virus still getting bigger. ok doctor true. work Psychiatric Facility ventilation based illustrations, even everyone wearing masks we're still going get it. buy price gouged N95's. yet don‚Äôt. Hmmm. Tegnell pointed it‚Äôs better Czech.

Even though touch face elbows, rest desk chair whatnot.  something antivirals vaccines make safe terms side effects? It‚Äôs rules post 3 different articles even they‚Äôre subject. Exactly mail-in ballots Democratic (so I've read).

Uhh...in Texas illegal vote mail unless 65 older. imagine over-65 Texan crowd votes. mean wrong suits want hear okay closer 30% Belgium (source Sciensano daily update page 7 eyeballing graph, average last 7 days 22.5%), accounting would need 1.8 million tests daily. Yes, completely unreasonable assume that.


No dont want admit it. biased number 80,000 (as new cases day)?

The bias comes doom gloom top reporting looking stats see bad made be. didnt lose minds like 1968 HK Flu we? *yawn* ok doctor.

Not arguing stupid 

Present facts cited sources fuck Trump really missed chance Space Force use Army/Marines/Air Force rank scheme rather Navy rank scheme. correctly chose Starfleet insignia Space Force insignia, went messed ranks. we'll friggin ""Colonel"" charge Enterprise instead Captain, ""Captain"" helm instead Lieutenant.

Bummer. Actually, average household France 2.38 people. Many households children carry virus home. Remember, expected completely starve virus, push back levels hospitals manage more. I'm teacher primary school setting. little disinterested leadership, taken upon vocal active keeping doors windows open increase air circulation ventilation. Mask-wearing class cause many issues stay far reasonably children. I've refused attend staff meetings held closed rooms little ventilation. I've already warned children parents stance change matter weather temperature.

The UK rough winter leaders government otherwise step fast. currently individual make settings safe despite ambivalence, ignorance resistance. used read unlikely get infected covid eating something even food virus particle it, go throat get dissolved stomach acids. I'm reading gargling helps virus gathers throat. two related?  Yeah isnt soft lockdown DE recommendations SE about? Getting case rates down? thought turned corner? thought covered, least american people told Cuomo completely botching response done solid job. New York among lowest infection rates country right now. micro cluster strategy successfully slowed Orthodox Jewish clusters. China botched initial response. eliminated virus force brutal 76 day lockdown. Taiwan hand achieved elimination early response preventing community transmission occur first place. New Zealand thing quarantine mishap second outbreak eliminated strong early response. 
So would grade:
A+ Taiwan, 
A  New Zealand, 
A- China,

F  Europe, USA bars today designed really loud. know why. singing church choir bad idea, think socializing shouting loud bar better one. Sorry hear it: please accept condolences loss. hope parents heal completely without requiring hospitalization. üíê

Take care yourself. you‚Äôre state / locale don‚Äôt wear masks, believe me, places do. Hang there. Yes. See NYC's Hasidic community. 40-50% seroprevalence coming fall. Now, major outbreaks leading state positivity rates. wanted reaction be. choose headlines make people worried generate ad revenue. flu changes every year. get flu vaccine ""educated"" guess scientists cover. feeling eventually covid19 flu shot/h1n1 shot bundled. got flu shot back September came H1n1 well Imagine flying before. make shittier less convenient. yet said he's going jack it... ""It's counties decide do."" I'm infuriated man could spit! started good spot (thank you, Dr. Acton!) yet kowtowed ignoramus cultists spout ""mah freedoms"" refuse make even basic sacrifice wearing mask. Ugggh. Well condoms/birth control work like 99% time used properly. Masks seem work marginally room ventilated stay period time. 

Time spent close someone ventilation seem important masks here. lol. **moni99** someone epidemiologist feel confident post **unknown** epidemiologists saying children less risk likely spread virus? 

I would assume kids, would still reduce chances kids getting infected. Right? 

You're making baseless health claim, like **bananafannypack** doing. [I would argue misinformation spreading making last longer population. 

[CDC: Transmission Dynamics COVID-19 Outbreaks Associated Child Care Facilities ‚Äî Salt Lake City, Utah, April‚ÄìJuly would wish everyone would stop talking covid were""armchair chair epidemiologists"" anything aruge actually expert in, what, not. According grandparents NW Iowa, spring summer, ""This city problem. reach here."" 
Despite cases blowing small town, still city problem. nobody talks about. Lockdowns always ""slowing spread"" making sure hospitals crammed full overcapacity. point total eradication pipe dream. nations extremely well controlled borders virtually total travel bans hold virus (Taiwain, NZ). Yet, neither nation's model permanent workable solution. ""I take responsibility Giyna virus!"" like masking now, depend region. ppl communities want live &amp; prosper they'll cautious take personal steps keep covid bay. Californians so. locales they'll continute higher case loads death rates. area decide friends' neighbors' lives worth. No. treatments become streamlined experiences gathered past year. sending cases studies treatment attempts every country. magic bullet virus. Virus treatment general insanely difficult. Every country trying keep latest therapies virus keeps mutating sending results WHO, hopes stay ahead deadlier mutation. virus getting weaker, anything gaining momentum winter season. are.

&amp;#x200B;

But freedom movement accross state borders impossible stop certain states throwing caution wind handicapping responsible states ability keep numbers control. 

&amp;#x200B;

So point would support letting states want states could restrict borders, can't don't. National response necessary. 10/22 10/24 4000 per day. That's besides point though, point LA experiencing influx cases even faster non-mask-mandate areas.

Also ‚Äúour democracy‚Äù mean ‚Äúour democratic republic‚Äù. Import distinction popular vote never decided federal anything.

If Trump wins wins you‚Äôll deal it. Biden wins wins well. 

That‚Äôs works. 

You throwing tantrum changes nothing. make mistake...your threats ‚Äúcivil war‚Äù tantrum. Melbourne Australia we've lockdown months play election. practice used modern medicine skeptics trend use theory legit medical alternative. Herd immunity epidemiologic principal apply immunity short-term, like COVID. it'd like saying we've using herd immunity annual flu... Logical fallacy would expect similar much worse outcomes. know joking, replace national government really want to.

People trained think Federal government ""other"" them.  many layers bureacracy elected officals Washington DC hard see power really comes people, money.

If majority people US went general strike, national government could forced anything wanted, including reform itself.

Which political parties spend much effort keeping people happy enough riot strike. Oh Tegnell deflecting speculating again. 

Sweden failed. Tegnell Giesecke obsessed immunity. kept speculating high immunity numbers. Immunity happen. Sweden start ~~lockdowns~~ ""recommendations stay home avoid physical contact"" October. 8 months late. can't call lockdowns Tegnellists say totally lockdown enforced police. never answer lockdowns work unenforced lockdown ""recommendations"" work.

If FHM ""recommended"" people stay home February. ""recommended"" ~~travel bans~~ *travel breaks*. rebrand everything Swedes get really angry.

He seem care. Read FHM leaks, he's annoyed he's even criticized. refuses admit criticism even legitimate.

It's good thing least rest world lost trust Sweden, even Swedes can't see themselves. saved us...from science. Saturday we're going hit 100k deaths day. EUnited States Yeah, you‚Äôre talking someone who‚Äôs purposefully stupid, doesn‚Äôt seem work reason experiment significant somebody gets two infections chance, know base probability is. could protection people, could risk second infection incredibly low. two possibilities obscured fact chance still relatively rare event infection (perhaps 0.5 % chance) still low chance happens twice like 1/200 * 1/ 200. So, low. One could also wonder persons two infections compromised immune system on.

In case, know much more, especially second infection entirely unlikely - otherwise likely succeeded infecting himself. therefore case gives lot valuable information. trump wins biden contests people like first people hypocritically screeching election fraud whatever fall, cooler weather.

The main concern right current medical system may overrun Fall Surge, leading towards sub-optimal care critically ill covid patients. could definitely increase mortality rate going forward. wish restriction place currently Eh, they're saying even vaccine rolled still back normal. that's case, fuck it. Try immune defect right now. stores rules well adhered although saw Ikea without mask. pubs taverns people let guard down. everywhere though? masks actually anything all?

And [85-91% mask compliance US already, even need federal action? vast majority Americans onboard since Spring. want youre smoking dude Obama wouldnt blip otherwise fascist history...he massively increased government spying fascist ideas Enjoy. Ah, yes. Florida Think Tank. know threat mostly empty statement. could try get Congress withhold funding would faced lawsuits limitations. said main way ""mandate"" masks would encouraging governors mayors enforce them. [You know  One statistic tracked (at least publicly reported) number UNIQUE (first time infections) alternatively number daily new infection cases previously infected.

i think could helpful trying get better understanding realistic chances reinfection rather computer models.

We obviously can‚Äôt compare newly attained data many months historical data, however could begin asking new case patients report numbers subsets total number infections.

Since high number daily new cases reported time, may arguably second third wave (depending ask), think great opportunity try see percentage new cases may reinfections! Yea majority people see wear masks needed, still see enormous amount people, don‚Äôt.

No one wears town landscaping construction example. single one. It‚Äôs fine, super low infection rates still. Oh yeah? link CDC say data inflated due incentives report URI symptoms COVID? I'm guessing won't, though, talking conspiracy theories ass. ‚ÄúWhoever get closest without going over......‚Äù.

Every white collar person know still works home. Everyone else it. kinda doubt economy would pick virus ripping country. Sure, people return life normal economy may recover. think people willing that. here's ""It would sooner"", ""save thousands lives""?

Its ""over"" there's vaccine. Anyone half nut knows this. meantime, try save lives. Lol. One act basic decency negates everything else they? Roberts idiot ability enforce ruling power requires perceived less legitimate. Roberts Federalist society deliberately normalize extremely radical policy positions making change incrementally. abortion case, example, threw anti abortion law, importantly stripped away restrictions previous precedent, allowing uphold next abortion restriction eventually throw Roe entirely.

I'm less worried that.

Improved treatment made made capacity go we're less 2 months vaccinating healthcare workers protect collateral damage. swamping healthcare system pretty close behind us.

The part worried death rate lower still LOT people multiplied large populations. seemingly interest stopping transmission even lowered death rate means thousands upon thousands deaths widespread vaccine availability (which many months away). Hah, someone finally said I've veen thinking. constantly see ""if locked hard March"" ""if government provided support"" someone mentions businesses closing saying full lockdown possible now. Like, mentioning fantasy scenario past anything situation now? course, would nice lot things happened differently, didn't, that's that. fun thing ransomware give data back payment. would they? they? would force it? criminals might even ask lulz.

the best protection click, open, download, install anything flys direction randomly. system place informed staff shut whole system immediatly prevent mass loss data. hope ""out"" mean ""out country"", need quitters rigid binary thinkers -- may also sullen virus spreaders - anymore. Oh. even reaching vaccine going change anything

This hyperbole. right there's blunt open-ended warning public health officials 'even vaccine get us back normal'. 

Faucii's pretty clear, make right moves time next year may decent shape, although honestly, we're really sniffing normal 'til summer '22. Prepare behave accordingly. 'Why?' ask? I'll say loudly hopefully people back hear it:   


BECAUSE STUPID GIVE DAMN ANYONE ELSE. 
That's it. tl;dr: could get sick everyone careful may go concerts such

the risk getting sick concert still zero go glad old enough vote Racism, spreading misinformation Please don‚Äôt take offense think misconception even urban legend. Strains virus less deadly immune systems may cross reactive immunity. many viruses remained lethal always were. Ebola, Marburg, Rabbies, Smallpox, Dengue name few. didn‚Äôt mutate become less deadly. think virus kills effectively prevents spreading control easily, mutations random natural selection would favor contagious else. That‚Äôs virologist told least. CDC saying since least mid-March. surface-sanitation mania never based sound science (in America, places hit earlier like China Italy different stories) People likely retired going first group get (aside perhaps doctors). think they'll competing jobs. part reason economic recovery going slow. probably human nature cling optimism. believe layman reasonably well informed optimistic vaccines. continue be. 

As article says: better take longer sure: reassuring fear it‚Äôs dangerously rushed process. vaccine comes, still governments asking us continue taking precautions?

Probably.

But people obey governments say?

For part, think so. Yep, that‚Äôs coming. mean... sure? yes?

What's point? think anyone compare anything? joke HAAAH! portion country would sooner shoot civil war let happen. I'm introvert definitely felt ease areas life.

However, want remote stuff continue indefinitely. general, always struggled keeping connections nerd activities always best friendship creators, even though manage partying alongside university. 

I noticed experiencing longing basic social activities like going lunch workmates slightly awkward guy random events get attend to. However, pandemic sometimes experience utter lack socializing besides work meetings taking bit toll sanity. child. history posts pretty obvious probably still teenager, maybe slightly removed best yet still mindset teenager. little understanding world fact go writing things internet horribly saddening. parents really bad? would really like see get help obviously crying for. child acting like unless obvious issues. really think putting internet learning means grown up. Perhaps find good role models real world. find much here. Heck, find friends interests like talk them. could really help you. Still. shows mutates. won‚Äôt vaccine. want Federal government dictating individual states do? Widespread public distribution \_might\_ begin spring. optimistic assessment. Note: N95 masks still widely available, even 9 months crisis. Making distributing N95 masks orders magnitude less challenging developing, testing, manufacturing, distributing administering vaccine. Why?  infringement rights

Only stupidest stupid actually believe this. ""freedom"" argument convenient one use people think hoax. unfortunately media twisted misleading headlines get clicks good chunk sub thinking they'll get epic gamer quarantine wins another year

I'm thinking certain *someone* who's name starts T... Source? great news though true Yes no. Regardless reasons got Trump President's seat fact alone people listen say. lot people believe must reason proof enough word trusted. may may realize though lot flippant comments actions tell may understand gravity words. Whether take direct action position lends influence, lot it. change tune replaced someone different message things says alone change tides. people oppose reasons course entirely likely leader convince follow path station alone people want believe means something. Awesome job Taiwan! Apparently although would think so. seems people learning live - think ""survive"" often younger take chances now. Older people still pretty scared think lots people caught first wave knew deal it. lot people would avoided death benefit hindsight unfortunately new pandemic. reason believe US numbers well confirm she‚Äôs super spreader? think lot asymptomatic people realize. Everyone wants herd immunity self-infect isolate 14 days hurt others without access healthcare We've lockdown week prior testing low mobility chance catching less week. Also, testing repeated next weekend, detect ones detected first round. negative ones free move anywhere, still obey measures (mask, distancing, hygiene...). That‚Äôs bad thing though, doesn‚Äôt mean virus real. last thing want vulnerable people brining health system capacity. Masks certainly less costly various manufacturers suggesting vaccine doses run. half comments deleted notice something weird. thing going dozens threads. 

The exact people thing weekly thread /r/sweden.

It's weird see Swedes organize misinformation campaign reddit. made personal imbecile. People like make fear human race [Covid-19 leading cause death 25-44 year olds worry young folks, old person killer also kills young people overdoses. 

I going Texas numbers US look little though. 30% Texas State Dept Health 17,375 reported deaths 65. live Sweden tried gain access covid test? Even symptoms, people turned away let alone asymptomatic. 

Source: Gothenburg resident can‚Äôt given test volunteer vaccine trial hope get real one. Dr. Fauci saying won‚Äôt return normal 2022. guess follows we‚Äôre endless fits lockdowns, reopenings restrictions then, longer. Yay.

Nah, make much ""one-liner"" articles experts like Dr. Fauci. Now, get wrong, Dr. Fauci respected epidemiologist, make every word comes mouth gospel. (Remember said masks February?) specialty public health, behavior.

As soon vaccine available, people begin feel safer, willing return things pandemic. Everyone's starting question whether took right approach. leaders try retaining restrictions even vaccine met massive opposition controversy. However, I'd surprised lot 100,000 day already. There's way test everyone know. Yeah, live someone thinks every free moment must spent somewhere else. I'm overjoyed get chance spend weekend home working projects, sulks whole time.

(Moderately extreme introvert, looking forward locked house year got tagged ""essential"".)  Uhh lockdown harder?  Fingers crossed indeed, good luck--Virus surging there, today's reported 2785 cases US equivalent 170,000 I'm 25, initial infection breeze. Still dealing effects 3 months later. Death undesirable outcome, wish people would understand that. BoyThatEscalatedQuickly.gif deepthroating reduce transmission? That‚Äôs virus works agree this. think result gain function research taking place Wuhan lab escaped due poor containment procedures, fully acknowledge origin never known I'm clamoring punish China (though withholding information international community probably merits form punishment). opinion gain function research dangerous worth though would like respark debate.  Sweden performed 160k tests last week (compared 20k early spring). non existent? Yes, comforted someone today spring wider public access. üò£ i‚Äôd reckon something it...UCI revealed 11.5% people OC antibodies resulting summer wave. estimate 500,000 people contracted already, mostly minorities living poor areas dense housing. imagine approaching holidays eventual cooler weather get folks living affluent areas. need background science understand basic science think myself.

But understand basic science philosophy science even process scientific research classic appeal authority fallacy

I'm appealing authority primary method. I'm basing contention fact scientific evidence, tested multiple sources, confirming hypothesis right current working knowledge handle SARS Cov-2 strongly supporting steps taking. Furthermore, clear evidence steps work: please refer New Zealand, Vietnam, Taiwan, There's nuanced answer virus needs totally disappear drop restrictions without happening.

Nuance enemy people unable understand world works. clear think science thing gives definitive answers; I'm tell understanding scientific process really, answer YES, virus needs total 0 every possible metric going back normal possible.

I think understand manageable disease looks like. flu manageable. Covid-19 worse flu. They're quite different actually. rely multiple different scientists, different environments, multiple international locations. They'll confirm contention. called Loose change good video, 9/11 inside job rogue intelligence networks.

I thought declaring GOP best use vote dumbest thing I'd see day. wrong I'm embarrassed thinking could go lower. Poor thing needs little R R. Marshall Islands beautiful time year...... Ha! Thank you! ever heard Doctor Harold Shipman? ""That made possible swedes actually stay home""

Except mobility data shows stayed home least developed countries.

I know tough data fit preferred narrative, going learn cope. Maybe deal putting anti-social selfish bastards place. Yeah see per 100k people we're middle pack big countries. that's considering draconian lockdowns like them. shabby, improve. Yeah sorry evidence reinfection common there. see happened pretty easily though. Testing increased, positivity stayed low. testing fell positivity rose, creating wierd positivity spike August even cases down. That's happens outbreak growing. Now, positivity climbing since September. would mistake assume anomaly well. signs direction time. decades senior citizen ‚Äúlocked‚Äù room live alone would rather die point. imagine many times worse especially keeping mobile keeps alive. Many die prematurely Covid. mean fck, live alone haven‚Äôt seen anyone know months want die. ‚ù§Ô∏è people homes basically solitary confinement, consider inhumane prisons. Nobody cares family member dies. f*****-up world. Phase 3 trials actually compressed less time vaccine program history. even still far longer rosy propaganda promulgated Trump administration.  everyone dying? Ok dude, saved time. 

When Someone preemptively tells possible change mind, believe that. need try, then. [Robust neutralizing antibodies SARS-CoV-2 infection persist five said post before. used covid mandates give excuse attack protesters disobeying mandate crowds 10 plus. malicous eMails around disguised newsletters; stuffed real news pandemic, click bait headlines 'n' that. guess alot people click curiosity.

Hope ironic, haha. That‚Äôs article said well. know everyone get beginning, vaccinating risk people surly help lower spike cases coming waves. everyone could wear mask stay least six feet apart... lot reasonable lately whining circle-jerks wanna best engage good faith

but real, knowing lockdowns affect wealth gap, public health issues besides COVID, what's case mitigate national lockdown? we're far away potential stimulus bill vaccines therapeutics, see anything heavily localized 2 4 week shutdowns would productive way approach this. way fucking hell California west coast locking right now. south tbh. well couple would be...

Also models broadly based idea everyone caught once, .6 people die US (so 2 million). Everyone won‚Äôt catch once, briefly, entertain idea herd immunity, 30 percent US wouldn‚Äôt catch all. Plus, also briefly entertaining idea herd immunity, spread eventually slow...which means talking 2 million people dying year? five years? 10 years? Dont worry. shanghai contain fever kids.

Stop spreading around. progress better treatment moot many people catch it, even run hospital beds/supplies. scenario, getting better treatment there's supply doctor treat you, vulnerable someone start pandemic situation. I‚Äôm trying disagree it‚Äôs bad, people may read think wow 1-20 people. 

Is 20% individual positivity 20% total test positivity.

Again, we‚Äôre definitely fucked major way right now. trying wade complexities testing mean French CDC data kids wearing masks spreading PEN15 Nope. mandates masks Iowa. Though strongly encouraged. joke.

The elderly neighbors building worst. One 68 years old, cancer, refuses wear mask. Yet tries talk everyone going building.

I done people. creating vaccine, applying said vaccine population,

So without vaccine one limited effectiveness restrictions last forever? I‚Äôm one poor patients caught middle fucking sucks battle insurance pharmacy. narcolepsy, take drug costs 16,000 USD month without insurance. current owner drug one create it. company bought creator company sharply increased price drug. It‚Äôs always profit people.

Even protecting healthcare workers risk help drive deaths hospitalizations virus still circulating quite time. Agreed, virus something take note of, resume normal life.

[Sweden took fewest developed country, serve effective control. Suggestions get those? called? French's strategy hilarious. (Europe entire)

Ever since cases started rise, decided slowly require masks quite literally everywhere. 

It helps little anything(it doesnt help look numbers)

Next up, they'll require wear mask home dog shit contact tracing system. literally praying I'm remotely religious Thank you! husband start building supply stockpile last month.

Is usually like that, Covid thing? Well, question is, current vaccines also going work not. entire world waiting vaccine, virus already mutates escape vaccine. Better wait couple years second generation vaccines, first ones cut it. guess cdc count ""experienced epidemiologist"" estimation? Well, distancing window, schools restrictions either removed relaxed, put position. know people always get sick winter, covid going get worse too, think Baker drastically underestimating fast going get control again. People definitely getting burnt nearly careful. [Here national institute health saying children play big role spread Covid-19. Schools stay open important development kids, allows parents could essential jobs freedom work children play limited role spread virus. 

Those **unknown** epidemiologists **rustyseapants**.

It seems like advocating closing schools epidemiologist? impact children's mental health too, psychiatrist? affect economy too, expert economics? answer maybe accept Reddit forum open discussion even making baseless health claim, like **bananafannypack** doing. [I would argue misinformation spreading making last longer population. 

Maybe basing opinion view epidemiologists though, ones you. That's baseless, that's misinformation.

I showed basing claim on, actual epidemiologists. admit would assume kids, would still reduce chances kids getting infected. Right? 

I would tell wash hands keep distance example yeah. country also allowed keep kids home super concerned Covid. that.  can‚Äôt legally extort states anymore. don‚Äôt get time, still one South Korean office building study.

Problem still dont know vaccines actually prevent virus, none efficacy data come yet. vaccines then? Heck, even doctors hospitals all? pathogens part humanity say let weak die......ugh. ignorance among humanity. crock shit. looking chart? Let remind testing voluntary.

Not really voluntary need tested allowed work. Seemed like tantrum smarts. think referring Sweden Switzerland think turbines ugly all, look like progress clean ground water. going use money virus relief, also something extremely harmful aid graciously given. Everyday lose little faith society. *No one wears town landscaping construction example.* 

The risk infection super-spreading spectacularly low people outdoor. Notice 95% superspread events weddings bar-mitzvahs hear literally nothing people catching COVID gardener? agree going helpful. Also consider European countries 2/300k test per day capacity.

Imagining 50 million people get tested one day seems excellent idea get everybody infected waiting cue sus af. I'm sure weird-ass flight (I fly jetblue), every single one weekly flights American Airlines completely full. Zero available seats. first letting people wear masks noses, they've tightened recently. planes absolutely get cleaned flights, though. bring alcohol wipes me, every single flight I'm wiping 10+ years encrusted grime everything body touches. There's nothing unconstitutional government mandating unequivocally masks worn times would put pressure state local governments enforce mandate. constitutional hang-up comes enforcement. far, 340,000 people home quarantine, fewer 1,000 fined breaking it. means 99.7% complied, according Chen. ‚ÄúWe sacrificed 14 days 340,000 people exchange normal lives 23 million people,‚Äù Chen said.

This part resonates me. travelers sacrifice little rest country live on. 

Instead US decided skip sacrifice part pretend like nothing happened. üôÑ Blaming young people older generations don‚Äôt want accept responsibility colossal failure. statewide.. nowhere near places like uptick hospital pts UCSF

is bit concerning, low test + rate reassuring. SF overall? comforting, especially considering we‚Äôre seeing elsewhere. Cases averaging 32/day, stable past wk &amp; well July-Aug peak 130.

&amp;#x200B;

12/ SF, we‚Äôve 140 Covid deaths far. I‚Äôve said, simply astounding, representing 16 deaths/100,000 people. entire U.S. per capita death rate, we‚Äôd 52K deaths, rather 226K. words, 174,000 people would alive today.

&amp;#x200B;

14/ Hospital # 's SF also reassuring: 29 total, bit low 20s 2 wks ago. rather rise UCSF hospitalizations indicating SF trend, looks like UCSF getting larger share; \~50% SF‚Äôs hospital Covid pts (vs \~25% summer). Reason: unclear. probably go read statute spouting off. PHSA thing. prevention diseases coming US...hate break you, that's already happened.

Further, question whether even constitutional.

\-- William Blake   Lmao love username Blatant misinformation. T-cell response seems good. 7 months seeing widespread reinfections. Herd immunity fucking unbelievably dumb approach please stop misinforming people. ... expose family? oh way: USA counts people died *with* died *from* skews numbers, notice number ""deaths"" ""new cases"" disingenuous 'under control' properly refer new cases increasing.

oh current situation. hardly seem ""under control"" me. Try job options unsure pay bills pay food. hardcore anti-vaxx movement (ie think mercury vaccines) loud neglegible.

I agree wait-and-see crowd vaccine-rushed-by-Trump ones potentially numerous. incentives them; agree messaging everyone still distance many wait. Germany infection rate 15 per 100,000. Belgium 117 per 100,000 780% higher Germany. overwhelming majority nations made single race. comparison flu usually 9th leading cause death US, sometimes 8th.

But deaths counted differently.  75 year old guy diabetes dies stage 4 renal failure, flu virus him, nobody would say died flu.

If virus Covid, would counted Covid death.

Flu deaths arent even really ""counted"". Flu deaths dont need reported CDC unless death minor.

In short, arent looking label every flu death can, way Covid. don‚Äôt agree it‚Äôs people gave up... weather got cooler drier enhances viral transmission. dire predictions new spike ever since first one ended (presumably summer came). Memorial Day, 4th July, protests, every week predictions never materialized. gets cold spike. conclusion seems clear. Poor kids, world live NZ killing people. /s Ahh yes, Reddit's obligatory ""you said thanks get downvoted"" response true thing testing capacity look precisely months (if years) Hi, alive.

It madness schools open. police paid enforce law, don‚Äôt want job find employment. Living life normally possible. Mask indoors, otherwise still taking domestic vacations, eating out, drinks guys Saturday, family Thanksgiving, family Christmas, etc. Oh good. it‚Äôs probably That‚Äôs true. lowest possible estimation still British one. cry Argentina.

Personally think foolish rely solely vaccine. It'd great get effective vaccines soon, plans account them. funny cause that's exactly leaders doing
also assume sars-cov2 acts likely like covonaviruses. best educated guess make. cops refuse enforce, minimum educating public mask usage. point we're going need sensible conversation society risk v life.

If 'rona somewhat diminished vaccine becomes something killed 150,000 people year (2,800,000 die annually) may accepted cost going back normal. feel must gotten book baby stuff (including chapter diseases) kids born. That's probably expertise comes from. someone brings ""slippery slope"" argument! remember President coming saying amulet money protecting him. Lol society done like March/April

What day? hobbies, like take mind shit Martha‚Äôs Vineyard think it‚Äôs case ‚Äúoh won‚Äôt happen us, we‚Äôre wealthy.‚Äù Ok chief. reinfects several millions lot apparently you. probably immuno-compromised people getting re-infected.
Is even clear way basic covid-PCR test pick viral re-infect taking place wheter someone another cold virus/influenza PCR picking-up old RNA fragments? totally impossible unless complete viral genome sequencing taking infection, re-infection someone comparing viral sequences. definitely happening world wide scale. testing capacity either. resources. 
Nobody knows whether strains mutate enough able reinfect people cross-immunity.
 coronaviruses mutate every year well massively re-infect everyone. assuming happening re-infects also constructive. Occam's razor way likely pointing reinfecting immuno-compromised individuals. virus mutates much also anything anyway. 
Btw, sound like dumb ass read article covid thinks expert now. know ad hominem is. anyone find surprising? modestly least now.

And part uptick reporting backlog cases Los Angeles County. Dr. Martin Kulldorff. saying they're right. I'm saying journalists qualified declare Dr. Fauci right they're wrong. proven cases. Thus far, seem correlation regarding severity. 

There could reasons - instances, reinfections virus worse immune system goes overdrive. 

My hunch (only guess, mind you) protective maladaptive effect swamped factors initial viral load. Perhaps, IFR much higher median IFR=0.27%; 1.54%. linked included 61 studies (74 estimates) eight preliminary national estimates. Seroprevalence estimates ranged 0.02% 53.40%. **Infection fatality rates ranged 0.00% 1.63%, corrected values 0.00% 1.54%.** messaging 6 months [**2021-04-29 18:09:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-04-29%2018:09:00%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

^(Parent commenter ) [^(delete message hide _Yekshamesh_ give monies data this? majority area absolutely wearing masks, believe anecdotes people areas not. RemindMe! 6 months Lol literally one image support this? One image clear ""[Name] killing us"" repeated trope, [name] likely someone somehow involved Reagan's terrible response HIV? saying wrong, comment shit. better. call dick nose. It‚Äôs definitely assumption. Restrictions long term effects, lost jobs, depression, worse education, people less likely visit hospitals important reasons name few. know huge factors terms quality life, well life expectancy. 

It problematic people much easier time understanding hard numbers today, able look bit future. know long term consequences, fun. 

With said, effects covid many people well. I‚Äôm arguing sit back relax nothing. long term consequences taken account setting restrictions now. Saying ‚Äúah shit didn‚Äôt know‚Äù 20 years going pure lie. Give 3 weeks protests restrictions Italy, given happened earlier Spring healthcare system Lombardy overwhelmed?

I would think would understand need restrictions. design. They're trying hide obscure data behind many deaths next Tuesday. People sub pandemic algorithms (one country x amount days behind country) eerily spot on. I‚Äôm sure US agencies access info. Eradication early goal weak leadership messaging quickly turned mitigation countries already month lockdowns. 



The ‚Äúwell controlled borders they‚Äôre islands‚Äù excuse cop tbh, due respect. US relatively strong borders self sustainable. would work US type shutdown even considered shutdown east Asian standard. depends area; Wal-Mart day town half people wearing masks, even though handing entrance store. see single mask worn restaurant, gas station, anywhere public rural county working last month. Keep holding services, guys. better. God wants worship least three hours every day, sing lot songs. Also, forget voting mail godless liberals, make sure wait election day vote. I‚Äôm really worried El Paso, cases surging time highs, hospitalizations already several-fold higher summer u/shiruken created tracker) series 'The Knick' partly theme. Highly recommended. Clive Owen main actor. something keep hospitals functioning. cannot huge lines people outside hospitals trying get seen. happen people heart attacks, car accidents? need hospitals open. USA!USA!USA! everyone leave home pretty much controlling borders travel. least lessening effective level. That's pretty much medal freedom. Fauci that. Rush Limbaugh now. choice. 

El Paso life flighting severe COVID19 patients atm. shit expensive. still selective pressure although maybe effective - fact see life threatening take appropriate steps minimise spread. Less virulent = less fear = less precautions = spread. 

So yeah, effective pressure killing host soon, still pressure. *Goes work naked*

‚ÄúTHIS JESUS WOULD WANTED!!!‚Äù think explained anything me. point timeline - saying different dates different things. vaccine magically end pandemic. intense measures next summer, depends many unknown factors. many industries survive another socially distanced summer, may may one. really depends. can't make people go risk infection. Even places restrictions seeing industries suffer.  insurance company would allow hospital use $1500 drug save $1000 hospitalization time.

The reason remdesivir got approved hospitalization time actually expensive drug itself. Yesterday, Dr. Fauci said won‚Äôt back normal 2022 hometown ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I‚Äôm sorry. sucks. I‚Äôm antisocial asshole. husband stuck me. offense all, I'm even close expert. agree natural selection favoring contagious, still think part contagious keeping host alive. 

Maybe silver lining fatal coronavirus less competitive current strains probably unlikely? Though like say mutations random maybe we'll see strain near 100% fatality, month transmission, something horrible like haha. It'll disappear like miracle...  key difference whole east asia took seriously dealt earnestly way back Feb March, US aligned , European 'democratic' countries like India, Indonesia Philippines decided dumb things like herd immunity, miracle round corner cures, etc etc deciding immune essentially seen third world China disease . 

The modern western media become toxic disease like HIV harms immune system deludes confused defense system.

I still remember May instead fighting disease, west still full disinformation media campaign swing trying attack disease east asia buckling dealing best it, eventually US cutting funding WHO.

In end actually follow guidelines (then 3 things, mask wearing, quarantine contact tracing, complex) done fine COVID US today never worse reached nightmarish proportions. Apples oranges though. New Zealand swift response contact tracing travel restrictions able contain heavily. allows citizens move mainly normal within country without concern virus. ask people wear briefly small spike that, hasn‚Äôt necessary. time NZ snuffed early concerns, US visiting Grandma Easter, injecting bleach, sticking bumholes directly sun inner peace spitting faces doctors scientists. Sooo, little different. faith mandates lock downs helping US all. think two things even maintainable showing science legitimate education hopefully encourage proper mask usage social distancing. fucked living be. capability. leadership so. live longer take public transit mandatory rules, forcing drive car every day instead. could see getting one mouthpieces really need extra stress top everything else. wonderful thing read  Winter coming. anyone even implementing lockdowns?

Or riding exponential curve millions deaths? feel like sentence changes every week. Could honest likely come out?  82 11884 blood samples, collected January July, tested positive sars-cov-2 antibodies. half parents childrens whose blood samples positive, remember kids showing symptoms back then; associate covid-19 time. read extremely disappointed government managed reopening schools discos, definitely supporting say give maybe explanation reasoning behind.

You want save tourism industry important accounts 13% GDP.
So cautious reopenings since may 18th see situation italy europe good. june 15th reopen flights EU thinking somehow save summer season, money spent. EU say want germans germans say want italians. Seems reasonable EU. still missing many tourists USA example undergo 14 day quarantine arrive. push italians spend vacations italy, cases all.
So order control somehow spread? forbid mass events, play soccer public, big festivals events.
As people go beach summer usually discos less open air beach think combination might work worth taking risk.

Again stupid move point view result 6 weeks peak summer season, end semptember, 1200 daily cases vs 200 end july. 1000 daily cases seem lot still real people getting sick. unfortunately die.

Now think stupid.. reality 4/5 weeks schools reopened cases jumped 1200 26000. reopening discos stupid proper description reopening schools? study , maybe tenuous link, healthcare workers flu vaccines got covid lower rate...and possible explanation flu vaccine (and vaccines) prime body generalized way fight infection dejavou?! looks like daily news now. second wave hitting us really hard tried lot keep virus small guys going run fucking tsunami. one watches countries got infected you?

wish guys best best. hand. country choise. change need country hope happen.

stay save friends ‚úåüèªüò∑ I'm introvert, live alone,and already worked home COVID struck. Life changed much me. first months, rarely left house sometimes went days without seeing another human? tough even me. Cuomo reopened early Patriot act. Yeah pretty fucked up. would volunteers thousands, ethics concern could pay million dollars would still drop bucket pandemic costs. Thanks clarifying that. Also, source appears Daily Mail (that‚Äôs first told story, OP‚Äôs article citing). may wait one reputable outlet independently verify Jesus majority Americans want MSM like reddit censored, false narratives pushed front page? Hey! DC want give hospital beds bunch no-tax paying, pandemic-denying asshats! Quit trying send deplorables us! probably right. AIDS rabies done fine job resisting reduction mortality. smaller selection pressure, longer I'd expect take notice. Something tells bug stay much generations. obviously missed early cases, IFR Italy estimated 2%, closer 1% France, UK NYC- could due hospitals overwhelmed Lombardy degree happen places. So, sort right. tenth amendment gives states police power federal legislation deemed unconstitutional legislation passed effectively ‚Äúcompels‚Äù states enforce federal mandates. 

You can‚Äôt withhold funding states incentivize them. example, say ‚Äúif pass law mandating masks, give $1m additional healthcare funding.‚Äù can‚Äôt legally say ‚Äúwe cutting/withholding health budget year unless agree pass mask mandate.‚Äù

So ways it, it‚Äôs complicated. big problem states (and will) opt out. 

Here‚Äôs couple cases read law school helps explain it:

‚ÄúIn New York v. United States (1992),[21] Supreme Court invalidated part Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act 1985. act provided three incentives states comply statutory obligations provide disposal low-level radioactive waste. first two incentives monetary. third, challenged case, obliged states take title waste within borders disposed prior January 1, 1996, made state liable damages directly related waste. Court ruled imposing obligation state violates Tenth Amendment. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote federal government encourage states adopt certain regulations spending power (e.g. attach conditions receipt federal funds, see South Dakota v. Dole,[22]) commerce power (directly pre-empt state law). However, Congress cannot directly compel states enforce federal regulations.

In Printz v. United States (1997),[23] Court ruled part Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act violated Tenth Amendment. act required state local law enforcement officials conduct background checks people attempting purchase handguns. Justice Antonin Scalia, writing majority, applied New York v. United States show act violated Tenth Amendment. Since act ""forced participation State's executive actual administration federal program"", unconstitutional.[23].‚Äù

You also can‚Äôt give much money that‚Äôs it‚Äôs effectively coercion. Statistically speaking, people die too, probably people take precautions. So, certainly ideal, might effect them. crazy! pandemic protocols include screaming matches?? There‚Äôs initial infection. encounter again, again, again. time encounter it, there‚Äôs new load viral particles infects you. makes crowded spaces dangerous infections, risk infection becomes exponential, linear, overall viral load infection multiplied higher.

This also healthcare workers risk, they‚Äôre exposed virus frequently, there‚Äôs lapse safety protocol, viral load they‚Äôre potentially exposed significantly higher person catching public. Another possible cause lot removed posts might rather kind mod conspiracy simply bad quality posts. article one long bitching rant Netherlands. 

Testing shit, badly managed due aversion using large testing labs protectionism leading infection health department.

Now (finally) goverment sidestepping department asking army set massive rapid test locations. massive blow face people health department (GGD).

The masks still manditory public places except public transport. goverment (and many dutchies think themselves) consider masks useless many situations, however accept change anti-mask stance stop rubbing global consensus.

The current lockdown manageble. Bars closed, social gatherings limited small groups 4 people. Gyms open 30ppl max (thank god). shops, take away massages etc open too.

The infections seem top right now. Hospitals busy, near Spain, France Belgium. Downside limited ICU capacity. Dutch chose sit pandemic without rapid increases hospital beds, rather belief measures curb hospitalizations models show large increase.

Covid currently takes 550 1300 ICU beds 2000 20000 regular hospital beds.

Right 20% non urgent care delayed, especially things dramatic, like knee replacements people experience discomfort knees due old age wear.

Generally speaking Dutch well, except testing. Heads roll (figuratively) among people responsible therefore.

The King traveled holiday area lot Dutch people also went goverment actually says ok travel (code yellow). 

It rubbed people wrong way King others would liked do, became petty it. Understandable. cure covid turning killing meant protect..

36k people UK estimated die cancer Thier treatments stopped postponed..

How many  suicides, depression amongst things . That's hospital adminstration. wear mask around people...it's easy that. No, think testing capacity going interesting see happens, happen, Biden actually gets elected. people going refuse help stand way it, because... Europe suppressed virus first, fucked big time.

The U.S. suppressed virus, posting record cases well.

The difference Europe going lockdown again, see thing happening U.S.

Anyway, I'm quite disappointed seeing Europe going through.  Well... guess take long enough view everyone eventually die. they're technically wrong, damn. US poors fight AZ FL seen small second waves already light restrictions lifted. 

Florida's positivity rate keeps falling. AZ's monitors CLI weekly already showing second wave (an extremely good indicator virus).


Even small second wave like 70% last 2 months.

Did virus magically stop caring? FL AZ find cure tell anybody? there‚Äôs vaccine middle next year mask goes off. literally reason one already. gross incompetence negligence.  Nice, that‚Äôll give ton home lol people want to. However, made crime knowingly spread anyways, I'm assuming know caused. meant anybody liked legally sex avoided testing costs. knowingly spread know it. 

The thing happening covid quarantine. pressure social, poor would reduce contact people much possible naturally. enforced quarantine, poor avoid testing matter what, can't even reduce contact like normally would. 

Criminalizing disease always effect: disease. consequence whatsoever testing positive, many people avoid test entirely.

To bring back HIV example, discourage testing people wanted continue sleeping around positive would probably way likely always use condom. small change could saved millions, outlawing human functions work matter badly want to. I'm sorry hear family's history WWII

I'm sure are.... makes sense anti china , China bashing 'china flu' standpoint US media POTUS feeding american people.

I'm Brunei, new chinese oil refinery commissioned year thousands PR Chinese workers coming work . Zero cases past 180 days .

The US victim delusions propaganda. 'The administration hurting wrong people.' would give monster dose? Presumably wanted find getting re-infected concern interested COVID That‚Äôs weird. thought White House claimed ended pandemic. Hmmmm I'm sorry hear family's history WWII.

Unfortunately, still absolve taking authoritarian generally hostile action towards neighbors SIL they've chosen live manner different you. I'm also sorry report faith religious beliefs absolve either. whew lads Yes, know dumb, shit going change looking escalating deaths. People haven‚Äôt mentally grasped yet million dead looks like get there, will, everyone know someone died, topic discussed going hospitals overcrowded stacking dead bodies wherever can. reality coming rate going hopefully ends ‚Äúwe need common sense‚Äù mantra people start listening science. Flu data tracked every I‚Äôm pretty sure she‚Äôs liar. Hilfe article states exposed CoVid patients, injection. suspicious article IMO. Bet politician fine wearing clothes though... surprised see actual 'mobile vaccine units' moving around cities.... clearly better points discussion since  dig post history attack another random comment. mean ""pandemic parties"", think spreading purpose? Ive attended one party bigger 5 people none ""pandemic party"" nonsense people spread purpose make game. lol said nothing lecture adults choices make.

how old think actual loser are. said nothing start talking like course easy guess American guys bit crazy comes politics. Focus country divisions mate, us Europeans interested think... guys crazy whatever part political spectrum seem like crazy liberal hard civil conversation :)

To answer points though start getting cry baby warrior like saying think lockdown practical solution again. may think otherwise could civil debate happy to. cannot say effect economy whether country locked not... sure people's confidence rocked pandemic lockdown putting nail coffin thousands jobs. Every day wake see company cutting jobs lockdown sad see. 

Sort attitude... privileged live New York mean care parts world well us. global pandemic shit brains everyone getting affected people dying losing livelihoods... scoring political points. literally hour ago, 230K dead would died anyway

Well, yeah. imagine someone news brushed 9/11 like this? ""Well, would died anyway"" Hospitalizations going Florida...  Based I've read complete disaster Russia right now, overflowing hospitals. they're even lightest lockdown. utter shite. 80k arse. 2,867 coronavirus cases 32 new deaths tied state mandates masks, according Minnesota officials.

Again, excuse. well fitted mask. don't, easy see happening. actually couple masks me. happen I'm careful, talking normal mouth movements immediately pull mask every word, nose comes out.

Yes fox there's literally video article Biden saying *Americans accomplished. Ftfy. see graph judge. increase around end august tourism. Mainly cases people coming back countries like spain croatia. accounted steady small increase became significant end august, following canonical 2 weeks spreading event (in case ferragosto, august 15th, tradition italy).
Then situation remains less stable entire month September end, exactly 2 weeks event (schools reopenings case) go average 1200 26000 30 days.
This really clear seems taken manual textbook.

As tracing spread schools, problem people asymptomatic even true younger population. tracing asymptomatic definition nonsense unless perform daily quick tests (which have) everyone entering school. safety speak about? 1 meter distance masks? 4 5 hours day room 20? that's safe everything safe.

But schools account 3,8% new cases bars, restaurants, gyms, movie theaters, sports events combined generate 4.2% new cases vast majority infections happen? say home family members. Well 7 millions mostly asymptomatic share closed space 20 people 30 hours week exactly two weeks suddenly mysterious spread families makes elderly members get sick covid results exponential growth new cases. 5 months bars restaurants reopened, 6 weeks vacation season ended. think is? virus crawling windows night? virus hiding 5 months bars attack people schools reopen?

I'm trying argumentative unintended consequences letting Feds mandate something something want. turn around. enough people start dying morons believe covid can't overlook anymore they'll start taking seriously. best part is, soon change minds they'll lie say always knew real everything could protect themselves. We'll likely end 500k deaths start really taking stuff seriously. That's enough dead people know someone died, know someone whose loved one died. That's going take, unfortunately.

""These studies limitations, since experiments examine dose virus achieve LD50 necessarily conducted humans."" person ""bacondface2736"" keep posting this, over. Multiple articles front page sub right now. 

Anyway, study garbage. look one hospital system NY March August, say death rate lower August. 

Then attribute better treatments medications.

Umm...hello? NY hospitals getting overrun March! maybe that's death rate higher? Thanks additional context. 280 deaths today... bad prediction! get better mask. difficult. falls (general you, specifically) talk, get one nose wire, and/or one that's bigger pleats expands talk instead moving face. Holy sweet mother God!

Good luck guys!

Edit: Even death numbers low, keep mind take toll lot infected people, getting inflicted lifelong damage. know Presidents look way older stressed time finish job compared looked started?

Stores want enforce already Road 100k! I'm convinced really pull off. mostly likely scenario we:

* haphazard, uncoordinated shutdown gets cases less say 10K/day,
* open prematurely (before contact tracing place) due economic political pressure,
* watch cases spike back 100k+/day.

Unfortunately simply enough unity leadership country pull off.

For better worse, eggs vaccine basket :(

With pessimistic statement way, although likely scenario fail, perhaps still worth trying..? mean ‚Äúfantasy scenario‚Äù that‚Äôs happening right across Asia? know virus controllable several countries controlled it. 

Unfortunately, US isn‚Äôt going option morons like you. Yeap, last fortnightly report total 9 cases 9 10 say really. We're rounding ~~corner~~ cornice.

So hell endgame here? both. God forbid people put upon bt wearing mask asked make real sacrifice, like fighting war. must one world's biggest fans proper lock downs. They've succeeded China, Vietnam, South Korea, Victoria (Australia), New Zealand etc. kept things bay Europe - - look set work again.

But, unfortunately, cannot imagine one working U.S. 'faux lock down' earlier year (not uniform, restrictive enough long enough) demonstrated cost lock downs, much benefits - faux lock neither accepted plan resources reopen sensibly.

There also 'structural' legal issues. impossible federal government mandate enforce closures states - especially current highly polarized state politics. can't even manage national mask policy.

Finally, importantly, still lack testing infrastructure sufficient supplies carry scale testing needed make lock reopen safely (and without giving gains shutdown). top tests, also lack system rapid contact tracing monitored quarantine enforcement.

Sadly, agree say U.S. shutdown happen. Hundreds thousands die COVID that, legal, social political systems would support shutdown would worth (say something along lines Melbourne's). President actually power that. mean, movies thing. done 100 percent home.

Especially since Russia cases (all accounted February, France said contracted thing, according wikipedia - less 30 confirmed soil Feb 28). Secondly, working covid patients purposely without PPE (as mentioned) months caught gauge long lasted recently start exposing without PPE caught right away? Also kind stuff happen developed western countries Asia? Im implying true not, crazy reports like always happen place like Russia Iran. trustworthy scientist Siberia? sounds like something movie. remained immune months working covid patients without PPE, that's pretty crazy first scenario I'm wondering about. Thought president said defeated days ago. Weird. immunity plan. 

Not necessarily true. else fails (ie vaccine), achieve herd immunity structured way allowing low risk groups co-mingle, keeping high risk groups isolated. faulty thinking assume can't build plan exit strategy. one good thing virus actually this, sometimes get hit diseases affect everyone ages equally.

Also, want note herd immunity ""exit strategy"" 99.99% widespread pre-COVID viruses diseases throughout (quite literally) *human history*. norm vs way around.

Also wtf people 60 still deserve live. suppose one parent asymptomatic, *might* genetic component immune system reaction, could make likely children asymptomatic well. 

There probably studies this, might totally wrong. agree it‚Äôs strange. You‚Äôre missing third group. people lost jobs businesses destroyed due lockdowns quarantines. Measures aren‚Äôt ‚Äòtrivial‚Äô millions people. actually life death. parents cant. lockdown, saw led to.
It negative impacts parents children.

Your family going safer due this. average, lot families get stressed parents cannot work due measures like that. Closing schools endangers children parents unless numbers devastatingly bad done.

Oh that‚Äôs right ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è money making economy uphold üôÑ Americans don‚Äôt want wear masks, 200 thousand people die (sarcastically saying). It‚Äôs horrifying many people don‚Äôt comply something simple. Grown people become children again. stubborn disrespectful reigns supreme country virus virus. Right. I‚Äôm selfish agreeing lockdowns brothers friend fucking killed them. 

Right. That‚Äôs selfish viewpoint. Lockdowns happen, talking terrible, well that‚Äôs off-limits. Great never thought Supreme Court possibility..... Surgeons aren‚Äôt ones working CoVID19 units. That‚Äôs medicine. Thanks playing.

This illness knocks ass two weeks get high viral load serious case, one risking long game here.

Even covid many hospitals squeezed docs nurses able work due infection.

America doesn‚Äôt system make anyone anything, wear masks work sick. might, parents couldn't.

We know (and know) kind negative effects first lockdown children teens.

If keep workplaces open (and keep open), see legitimate reason open schools, children seemingly less impacted covid different margins (they seem get less often get it, far elss severe adults).

Closing schools would make negative effects shutdown far severe.
Teens graduate school twenty. Even parent got late, means 60 graduate, probably 50.

ON whole, 500 people 60 died germany vast majority risk groups like severe smoker, autoimmune disease, asthma, on.
Under 50, 100. two factors: People 60 50 dont usually die covid children less likely get it.

The chance child leads death due school reopening small, chance child suffers due months lockdown nation suffers parents need stay home almost 100%.

So, measure makes lot sense. I'm going guess outside developed countries testing remains low thereby bringing global ratio. change fact three distinct waves. I'm saying good thing. fact. comment won‚Äôt appreciated much needs be. March 2020, Walmart Costco held great. Amazon Pantry seemed crashed. places contact trace rubbish bin/bus seat/frozen packaging certainly easily trace adults white house study days back discovered percentage set Wuhan dwellers Covid antibodies nearly 4%, way higher reported numbers. reported percent Wuhan? 0.5%. Obviously 4% whole 8 times higher reported numbers represents truer amount actually infected. 

Now apply numbers, ergo China instead Wuhan, see China ~50 per 100k epicenter. Thats still 54 times less US reported numbers. think US reporting numbers somehow. must double numbers.

(This heard India/Asia now.) seems like xmas going hard everyone First all, appreciate you. wore masks even though want to. That's good citizenship right there.

Second, get n95 Kn95 masks pretty easily. 

r/Masks4All/

I've using KN95s year they're great.

I agree masks cure all. also need shut bars restaurants. also need keep eye central air HVAC systems might spreading disease. :( November 3rd comes, we'll hopefully begin like WH January 2021 thought already done 3 days ago Lock downs dont work end lockdown immediately go back normal like nothing happened. 

People gotta quit selfish. We're gonna live somewhat uncomfortably ends, gonna put called selfish asshole experience Australian visiting USA work significant cultural difference.

To Americans seem attitude 'I'm ok, worked hard, ok must fault'

Now couple great American fear communism end society looks uncaring.

In Australia social welfare systems seen socialism looking other.

The aspect Australians following law.

Melbourne major festival year used include parade.

To keep people back parade paint blue line road.

Nobody crosses line.

Medicine point population around 3 million.

I think factors combine deliver almost universal acceptance mask wearing tried lights? long know well contact tracing works (and don‚Äôt) numbers worthless. 

There also nearly cases using public transportation - would name contacts bus?

Same restaurants. lot people giving false information contact lists, restaurants giving forms every customer (experienced myself, insist getting form paying, server care all), data many cases come reliable all.

Contact tracing works well private events workplace. it‚Äôs really poor public spaces. I‚Äôve lived bro. point plenty people don‚Äôt symptoms spreading virus. causes huge % it. sick people wearing mask slows spread. healthy people wearing masks reduces infections. That‚Äôs wear mask. 
Also wtf don‚Äôt mandate temperature checks everywhere catch people mild fevers??  cant find farina flours lately either. sounds good Amazon Taiwan even federation one wdym wouldn‚Äôt touch Florida pandemic completely over. can‚Äôt trust it‚Äôs run That‚Äôs another falsehood Trump medical bills - accidentally spilled boiling water couple weeks ago held going emergency room long could due fear bills would even though I'm employed health insurance. Copay $150 gave week pay called see could extend month (my dog also vet bills unexpectedly come up), got berated told would send new bill price pre insurance I'll pay that. I'm hoping bad day fuck financially rest life, may have. know people dealing they're unemployed health insurance. fucked. Window film make huge difference. live poorly insulated house bought winter worked amazingly well is. definitely cure helps. live Wisconsin hospitals 90% capacity (or close, fact check that). ONE FUCKING CARES wife‚Äôs grandfather died covid. It‚Äôs really bad get worse. release vaccine ASAP worst hit states it‚Äôs completely control only. many people believing imaginary gods remember seeing 40k dead thinking big, yet seems tiny? 200k future 40k. Except receded values still higher many countries control. Exactly. thought government would bring effective TTI this, I'd pro-lockdown. seem sitting hands hoping get bad vaccine bails out, done enough research know vaccines still months months away.

We need scientists government. advisors, people power make decisions. house 22 windows around $500-$700 per window. time make money back heating/cooling savings, need new windows Lol tell check r/covidlonghaulers Sorry NZ, Laura Ingraham represent majority Americans.

She represent majority morons. Sorry mate don‚Äôt think know Asia well. Plenty places cold colder climate Germany lots life happens indoors well. hot. Inside aircon. also countries much older age Germany well places younger. 
I think mistake made / enforce modest restrictions bars, restaurants events (including weddings). You‚Äôd done much better might gotten away closing almost everything. think Jar Jar Binks could've handled covid better had. even put national mask mandate yet crazy everything seining go back ""normal."" Like sports fans, espn crew presenters studio, schools back. Etc. (Just random examples) highest cases been. Back type lockdown half many cases people taking serious.

When gets REally serious, life usual. insane. higher residental densitiy?

USA = 33 residents per sqkm

France = 103 residents per sqkm

Germany = 233 residents per sqkm

The USA 27 times larger germany 4 times population Germany vote find out. Come man! respectful reasonable people saying - tell you? Lots people say Sweden lowest mortality Europe.

Every time someone brings Sweden there's idiot says it. Wait, farm animals make immune big part economy set aside? live Taiwan. early stages pandemic mask compliance 100%. I'm exaggerating, could spot person public wearing mask.

Now things greatly relaxed. I'd say 20% people city wear masks, that. large crowds people enjoying life, fear virus here. Yeah... Great corners, beautiful corners, sometimes three, four record number corners week.

Big, beautiful numbers! much winning! Can't see winning stops anytime soon. corners! go back school next week, I'm ready :,) around June .

Fact is: Throughout different european nations, scientists saw alarming psychological problems children due lockdowns. fact.
Fact also: Parents 60 50 (most 50) likely die covid. 
We also didnt suddenly see insane rises covid numbers reopened schools.

Taken facts together, make sense close schools, especially help children, neither save parents.

And unconstitutional (and quite honestly also good idea) let parents homeschool. Even minimal social distancing done Australia wiped flu single digit percents usual amount, Australians careful year COVID outbreaks recently.

So even people US taking COVID seriously, many taking precautions likely helped massively suppressed flu US too, covid deaths likely even *higher* raw excess deaths number, there's likely far fewer flu deaths usual year. first time I've heard santa exchange. sounds like great idea though! haven‚Äôt following market still printing money?

""The spokesperson private hospital's communication department told CNN positive asymptomatic staff working mainly Covid-19 units work across units including non-covid patients, except geriatric, neonatology oncology departments, patients ""particularly vulnerable"".""

I understand terrible dilemma they're in, truly awful. 

No wonder people trying avoid going hospital since pandemic started.üò• Super good article wish shown ventilation alone precautions. seems like AC accounts decreasing much? Curious it‚Äôs comparable wearing mask. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt really tried yet‚Äù yet ‚Äúhalf‚Äù trying gone since March. There‚Äôs chance full lockdown situation. 

At point nations dragging feet teeter tottering opening closing things. Somethings gonna give won‚Äôt lockdown, it‚Äôll swing side. 

The economy important completely destroyed, better deaths utter collapse society economic turmoil. Wtf insane Source? earth read... terms long antibodies start wane, like cold-causing coronaviruses. Instead children get think mean show symptoms.

At work 66% telework, social distancing mask wearing. seems silly kids go-to school take masks sit right next other.

They breath spread like adults different. show symptoms makes even worse. 

You keep saying mental state? Well let tell home loving parent hardly lead mental issues. research contrary could take seriously.

I stop short calling psychology pseudoscience going school trumps parents love nurturing wonder. wait Laos (pop 7.1 mil) covid deaths 24 cases?  I'm talking handling virus within borders. I'm talking transparency international organisations like countries. Western countries would notify everyone, would scientists around world involved investigation, silence whistleblowers etc. completely different thing Trump saying something stupid coronavirus. doctors scientists US countries freedom speech said something new coronavirus get threatened police. I'm aware US government lied citizens say whatever want US even goes government saying important difference. China already got entire world infected can't possibly worse that. want info check edit replies.  Every person involved idiot deserves fired banned form flying.

There zero excuse stupid risky things going anywhere anything pending test. someone incentivizing narrative. I'm willing bet 50% wont comply current anti-mask states surging right lmfao I‚Äôm truly worried  you‚Äôre smoking? UK half population density Taiwan. rights interstate travel interacts public health emergency clear subject speak votes fam! believe !!!! get close 100% mask adoption next day. deeply embedded culture here, wearing mask considered polite considerate.

A bunch things would also done, contact tracing etc..the way people treated Covid19 Taiwan borders paranoid (which pandemic right attitude imo). population infected change? cases going it‚Äôs younger people, mortality rate going lower....  see 120.000 tests pr. million people, real number must staggering. Yeah actual cases half would crash healthcare.  January 20th going worst we‚Äôve ever seen. possibly even worse pending events. Assuming sake argument 50/50 whether help not:

What's risk wearing mask? I'm aware except maybe fogging glasses walking traffic.

What's risk wearing mask? Getting sick dying.

Seems logical choose less risky option face uncertainty, yeah?  seems skewed. Government isn‚Äôt people government care? They‚Äôd rather us die. Mather 4:7 - Jesus says devil, ""don't fucking punk test God stupid shit know kill expect save dumbass.""

Why supposed Chatholics going teachings big Jeezy himself?

And since reason wear clothes first place sin God, continuing cover bodies made image? 

Should exposed possible instead hiding amazing god like genitals? hear ""they count car accident deaths coronavirus"" ""no deadlier flu"" regularly.

'optimistic' remarks made people curdled brain matter; caused virus, exacerbated This! Prolly one party‚Äôs election strategy along. Stay safe peoples! upcoming months, I'm concerned sheer number medical professionals (doctors, nurses, etc.) abandon profession forever, due tsunami patients coming way. mental anguish suffered caregivers intense forever. days, patients live, days, sorting patients survival chance (triage). live wrong part country. Sorry, sorry.

Often sue government right worship together endanger innocent non-participant's lives. words this...

I feel like ""majority Americans think X"" polls useless say exact thing: sane people think X, Fox news people think Y, always exact proportion.   Also, 4th July. happens time. one recent ""wtf"" news germany woman took test symptoms, went visit daughter hospital signing form stating healthy entry, test result came positive. hospital made report; per law jail sentence 3 month fine 180 day's rate possible. Governor fine officials sheriffs? mechanism would that? Anders Tegnell (April 21, modelers, starting see many immune people population Stockholm starting effect spread Kim Sneppen also (September 23, evidence Swedes built degree immunity virus which, along else stop spread, enough control yet Stockholm (and rest Sweden) clearly seeing huge rises (October 22, authorities said separately number COVID-19 patients need care region risen 60 per cent past week. term started year time election again, think less public's mind. majority people favor response pandemic actually think Evers would re-elected, but, guess I'm biased.

Edit: actually started last year. time flies! Iirc would R^0 near 1 lower lethality help sustain 1.

This one may restrictions permanent would need contagious R^0 = 1 even restrictions Assuming even pay. think NZ cases might wrong, mate. NZ's government website shows 6 new cases. Yes, home kits swab drop nearest pharmacy, cases delivery taxi waits 30 minutes return kit you. believe also tests performed HCW make appointment for. They‚Äôre wearing grocery store soon leave, go. People still dine gather groups likely without masks. That‚Äôs problem. Alaska Hawaii allow people arrive pending test isolate it‚Äôs confirmed. 

Obviously done given uncertain turn around times tests days also obviously introduces sort risk, even well intentioned travelers (not one negative test 2 days would perfect anyways). Yeah wishful thinking. reason smallpox deadly natives America novel virus, mutations. stayed deadly always eradicated.

Right there's little pressure cov2 become less lethal lethality occurs transmission already stopped happening Unbelievable. pandemic brings worst people highlights every single weakness society live in. addressed weaknesses (wishful thinking), might spared lot agony torment hitting unlucky vulnerable population. Mass mental health decline happening mostly invisible compared physical illnesses IMO going harder recover from. ALSO physically sick Covid going physically mentally affected. don‚Äôt honestly think solution. It‚Äôs hard compare country country culture largely dictates needs done how. (ie Classic example, China vs Canada, even Canada vs US) Ireland we've partial lockdown 3 weeks (and since September live) &amp; full lockdown week. Cases dropping steadily hospitalisations also dropping, feels strange ahead curve Reasonably cautious Chads rise Every citizen gets time testing alphabetically last name, large number people avoided one time, emphasis aldo maximum safety terms disinfection way around, females would pissed  least article ask wearing masks, doubt people would answer one truthfully. Anecdotally everyone office wears mask around 5 10 wear nose, chin strap, forget sit next eachother lunch break talk entire time. That‚Äôs true, social distancing isn‚Äôt natural do. Ever notice weird tension get try physical get close someone? It‚Äôs normal us. Either isn‚Äôt healthy, own. western countries parts Latin America reported highest single-day surges past weeks. Many governments, notable exception United States, started taking stronger measures bring spread virus control. one ever thinks healthcare workers going flat months end

That's simply true. thinking part. lot people show tremendous amount support clapping facebook posts donations volunteering. Apparently, trailer **Songbird** released hours likelihood kind scenario actually happening? scenario person's nose remains uncovered semi-explainable. I've seen lot people mask fitment issues mask falls nose speak. chinstrap? excuse. Ivermectin used latin america many months. never worked. worked invitro. 
Favipiravir used India, bangladesh, Iran, etc never worked either. rural vs urban, biggest factor I've seen masks worn normally Get fucked. People need make money delivery services popular way it, anyone using services tipping generously. I‚Äôm also leaving travel sized hand sanitizers water bottles front door anyone wants them. 

What shitty comment make behind keyboard. Seriously, fuck you. Moved Nebraska month ago Oregon. confirm. Seeing someone mask often. Even schools open 0 masks place. ridiculous Nobody trusts Russian Chinese data forget that. Even works can't trust they'd lie didn't. Koronavirus smell, bet losing weight easier. video conference Thursday, Merkel said political realities stopped imposing restrictions earlier, would draw lessons current situation act faster future, according officials knowledge comments, asked identified meeting private.

See EDIT.

China definitely hide information coronavirus even Taiwan knew human human transmission China supposedly still unaware... withheld information kept rest world dark. western country would share information international organisations like everyone would known much sooner. [They get pissed every time someone wants open investigation origin seem weird nothing else say.

Yeah US lied citizens masks. really see that's relevant internal US affair. Lying citizens something something completely different keeping information countries yourself, letting get infected suppressing anyone trying spread truth. I'm saying that's fucked well one US got arrested saying masks actually work try make entire world believe masks work.

I never said US better job containing virus within country China did, said started western country, world would known much soon would time repair. China already let infect entire planet see would worse. example: started US best case scenario would share information manage contain within borders save countries notifying danger worst case scenario would manage contain spreads around world and, clearly see, worst case scenario actually happened started China. yeah US government specifically oligarchy give shit people they're fucked either way virus gets within borders it'll spread like wildfire regardless whether originated not. western democracies would undoubtedly better job US within borders one could manage worse China let virus infect entire world. Look aviptadil, rlf-100.

Their latest test results amazing/ good true could hear fda approval anyday now. Let's real, people support herd immunity supporting herd immunity, care less whether people gain immunity. They're promoting nothing they're dumb, irresponsible, lazy.

There's talk open safely, address people lost everything. care that. believe exceptional miracle everything ok. No, culture like Northern Europe, like crowd bars get others' breaths. cannot afford change. United fucking stupid Italian dont think re-election cause next elections 2023, dont lose majority Senate House Representatives, negative response population national lockdown Unless everyone wears mask there‚Äôs end sight. Fauci said things normalize somewhere towards end 2021. 

Europe affected new strain, unlikely vaccine catch different mutations year. top priority limit cases. limit damage businesses.

How know that? that's what's happening people put trust experts politicians. experts politicians agreed, might able prevent millions cases. That's US said March looking Italy Spain handful people navigate obstacles currently hindering society: disease, martial law, quarantine, vigilantes, economic collapse. nothing else done lockdown fight virus? hope lose Vos, Duffy orr Klefisch next election.

Edit: spelling   Asian countries took method focusing stopping outbreaks virus itself. Outside Vietnam Taiwan, Asian country truly ""eliminated"" COVID they're seeing surges EU is. can't blame locking locking hard enough masks you.

The issue lifting restrictions actually suppress COVID, like removing travel restrictions.

Nope, that's you. North South Dakota highest number cases per capita US also among highest anywhere world (52k 47k per 1 million respectively). Andorra (total population 138k) Bahrain higher/similar numbers tested almost everybody living there.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Find objects *Not really much lockdown innit?* New Mexico mask mandate since May cases hospitalizations never higher. corner. Roundabout like flung goalposts next county. Europe hard lockdowns, mask compliance, hard bans events cases deaths exploding. 
This sub begging lockdowns. ""2 weeks flatten curve""...  sudden, masks, moderately mitigate spread, saving grace. lived county (Broward, FL) closed non-essential business 2 months top ban events mandatory masks that's effect since March.  There's still cases deaths.... 

It's simple ""Wear mask wash hands lockdowns go away""     Oof. Good job üëç Don‚Äôt feel bad. Qualifying times get application lottery pool. Even qualify there‚Äôs still chance won‚Äôt selected run race anyway. It‚Äôs weird. year postponed gonna make weirder 2021 (if doesn‚Äôt get postponed again). said before, Huxley's *Brave New World* gets even closer reality think. read due re-read, elucidating. double-blind n=10 study this.

**METHODS**

The test group 10 opaque cups water; control group 10 empty placebo cups. Cups labeled numerically, number blind link contents; neither researcher ""volunteers"" knew which. Found 20 people dump cups onto, recorded results, unblinded samples.

**RESULTS**

10/20 volunteers experienced adverse events consistent wetness. correlation water high: 10/10 ""wetness events"" (100%; 95% confidence interval 83-99%) water samples 0/10 (0%, 95% confidence interval 1-17%) placebo.

**DISCUSSION**

Water wet Colorado (p=0.05). testing required states. would use famous people afford better treatment indicator this? seems dumb. Trump still periodically calling pandemic hoax

He literally declared pandemic ""over""

Its Orwellian like nothing ive ever seen Sounds like something anti masker would say Double points get lil gasoline finger üòç Right? It‚Äôs chilly enough want inside night way easier outside rest day weeks ago 90-100 (and full smoke) damn depressing thing allowed go work go school.

that's they've trained us since 6. whole point every pandemic plan panic set it. Lower transmission rates reduce harm, don‚Äôt cause harm causing poverty mental illness. always plan. That's quite move. news spread Nowhereaska? good ol‚Äô taxpayer double-dip yet reported deaths low. 

What‚Äôs going on?  *can* careful. measures need take reduce risk pain ass, add up. Reducing unnecessary measures make easier keep things actually important. could done that!

We it! think every selfish boomer think thoughts? 'winners' - rules little people. hey, means really really poor people afford much well folks. point bend curve, realistic squash it, public health consequences extreme goals worth cost. estimated last week 760MM people infected worldwide onlye 35MM cases reported. 

That's case infection ratio 1 21. Apply 500k new cases reported today, equals 10.5MM new infections total. Yes. pretty well-understood since maybe May; it‚Äôs impossible, it‚Äôs unlikely.  two hospitals shutting Dallas can‚Äôt perform many non-essential procedures Stop spread, flatten curve. "" Gov. Kristi Noem made clear issue requirements wear masks public. [cast approach ‚Äî foregoing government restrictions keep economic activity humming ‚Äî example Republican leadership. ""

So going ANYTHING, first, leadership definition. second, bother government never going anything? What's source that? imagine there's limited supply buy many doses. indications paid government supply becomes available. Lay idiots gonna get idiot juice you. Everyone finished eating way first stockpile. controlled spread.

Can‚Äôt train doctors nurses six months.

Can‚Äôt even retrain non icu doctors nurses fully competent icu six months. Yes! know don't. bit stocking March, extra canned goods whatever. possibility currently, thankful got now.  Shut up. Lol reaction emotional logical. Yes, really really sucks stay isolated away other, alternative? Keeping population lockdown simultaneously keeping country running logistical impossibility. Hospitals, production, food sourcing, deliveries, virtually every sector keeps country functioning core (food, water, shelter, medicine, basic living supplies) horribly impacted much general, healthy population sick time. means sick flu symptoms, never-mind serious symptoms come COVID. Even main strategy learn live everyone eventually infected, spread needs slow, concentrated, controlled, frenzied free all. evidence far conclusive, much research tarnished flaws data collection analysis. funny cute. FOX NEWS ALERT people plain fucking idiots.

I give example: 

There's neighbour living next door girlfriend.

He covid-19. tested negative.

Even knowing that, keep staying room wear mask. mild symptomps says ""nah big deal"". agrees.

He mechanical engineer biotechnologist.

If two people important educational background behave like this, think enormity morons going around without mask claming 5g bad.

The great majority italy completely moronic ones finally understand change minds ones even die see person close die.

Some would deny even happens.

We fucked. heartbreaking, well wishes all,stay safe friends. logic would suggest :) like want get reelected. Or, like Trickle economics, trump's effort ""finally"" started working. Thank you. I'm sure hard people sub understand. Reddit seems taken ""school free daycare"" stance. Ableist word: know documentation do, cupcake. doubt even know start. us favor shut fuck know. weed use essential, otherwise line actually NEED ...and documentation. joke, right? ..... Guys? üò´ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  Actual French scientists say schools little it, shutdown involve them. idea, abolish EU let countries deal see fit. Waiting turn get vaccine :( never actually hear number. USA testing capacity perform much tests right now. What‚Äôs likely happen official daily new cases plateau somewhere near current numbers positivity rate keep going up. Nah need discover stuff ownn get older. Can't keep house able get it. kind talk meaningless. Sure, correct hypothetical. anyone thinks western cultures societies allow elected governments enforce stuff understand much western social order. Mask mandates could maybe pull off. can't force people test (as China), nobody wants contact tracing can't force. there's people whose livelihoods dependent ""high-risk businesses,"" savings left last six months. Two weeks (which France doing) got arsenal. much.

This whole narrative driven people least affected lockdowns. simple. impulse camping trip went completely sober, I'd probably still getting blackout drunk every night inject kool-aid Well, given option, I'd generally agree depending extent disability. comes SARS-CoV-2 I'm avoid rolling dice entirely. suspect case they'd weighted unfavorably consolation, Northeast one least likely places contract Covid right (even though picking up), general risk low, followed proper precautions, even lower. Kids demographic least risk. science divided related asymptomatic spread, don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big concern. think task force left 1) America policing world little influence happens internally China/Russia. 
2) expect different either way, honest. close ally Russia, course things better Russia policing world vs America policing world. opposite applies US allies. Either way, terrible dictators propped benefit motherland; difference dictators. whole world making cases sway US election?

/s mean Ford. takes 10 days till start dying. People keep dying months. ARDS 30% deaths 30-90 days post admission. checked drafts, cancelled year fantasy due screwy season. However find A-gap needs plugging. talking about? I‚Äôm talking proving conservatives Ontario Quebec Meaning working poor middle class pay everyone's. He'll voted soon enough. He's trying play alt-right idiots sort ""legacy."" really think it, he's weak leader done much. pandemic proven spades. Order food house review there. Watch movie online critique safety house.

EZ peazy remember said testing would free. believe see it. Ya ships November 14 Covid scheduled think said. Pandemics us afford certainly stockpile food necessities. Even shortages, could mean couple less trips grocery store peak covid hits neighborhood. harm getting 2-3 boxes cans soup, tuna, spam, oats, beans, etc., keeping basement. always donate food pantry end eating it. *lockdowns numbers add together. number 277,000.

Both numbers lag different ways percentage undercount seem remain quite constant. 40% appears around 35% now. make sense it'd change time different areas different incentives correct counting surges.

Note certainly possibility collateral deaths, sick people can't safely go hospital next several months going rise. hand possibility negative collateral deaths. looking exact causes death (generally easy) really get true picture IMO. Cuomo said? Hawaii terrible neighbors. GOAT That‚Äôs feel zero high risk family near keep taking precautions would hope people near family take precautions too. it‚Äôs right thing do, hang tough! shut up, man everyone Sweden trash? seen mask days. Straight ""heart disease lethal covid worry covid"" handbook logic interpreted flawed stupid though. really isn‚Äôt hard spot Russian account.

Yes cost ? read article? backup operating system different backup database non- executable files. point possible reinstall clean copy operating system, restore database backups. Yes, close whatever methods used enter, could happen again.

But change backups part solution, one main reasons ransomware hits hard part lack appropriate backups. nervous Feb April. time people kept contacts simple possible. Gatherings weren‚Äôt banned discouraged; colleague wedding reception cancelled. People less; imagine Ding Tai Feng limiting time one customer per table poshest restaurants selling bento boxes. long weekend May people started relax. we‚Äôd closed borders quite time. suddenly everyone stop caring.

Do good data (not anecdata) this? doubt ""people caring"" major factor here. Infections pretty extreme seasonal patterns people care flu summer. people caring flu exactly much usually do, suddenly closer together, drier air, less sun, colder temps, schools (and on). media needs create emotional response. ""oh there's need test since there's community spread""
Except that's exactly China doing. think decided test everyone Qingdao reason? mass testing Beijing also random sampling? That's handle virus control. New Zealand also same, test high-risk travelers front-line workers. confirmed case outbreak, start mass testing contact tracing. expecting China 13 Billion tests every 2 weeks? I'm curious well, like per place what... Taiwan island. Banning tourists comparable soft lockdown yeah, lockdown needed.

That specific ruling one established government can't withhold relief funds coercive manner. 'backdoor', quite explicit. US government power think does. you‚Äôre professional food reviewer? Movie critic? lesson really bleak rest world. economists crying short term losses.

The lesson : suppress/eradicate virus willing so. Unfortunately Western societies thought worth effort. terribly backfire. Europe screwed big time. 

I think much worse US covid wise. reopened early. I'm 33, healthy weight, runner, previous health issues. nearly 4 months since got sick I'm still weakness, aching/tingling limbs, fatigue, chest pain. feel like I've recently begun improve. still able return work. idea I'll able run - walking fast gets lightheaded. Politicians always legal experts. Case law supports position Federal government restrict individual liberties times emergency, long severely impeding upon rights, discrminatory nature.

A mask mandate long allows religious exemptions (specifically places worship) would hold muster careful examination constitutional law, especially considering PHSA (public health service act) gave executive branch broad powers safeguard public health, especially pandemic. powers magically made either, executive branch (and federal government) allowed pandemic explicitly laid PHSA, upheld numerous times since passage 1944. 58k dead americans vs 1.1million dead NVA.

Wow...just wow. clearly stated cos staff kept masks on, rather make assumption maybe might immune cos got Covid past.

These sort leaps logic Europe almost bad US now. Keep it, folks. Keep refusing wear masks might keep resorting extreme social distancing instead, aka LOCKDOWNS. note many parts Europe going impose yet another round that.

Have fun that. viral load argument shakey aerosol transmission. Hopefully true extend, far certain. suspect money see get think would encrypt, suspect ways see could can't encrypt inside. far qualified speak thought. know you‚Äôre looking ‚Äúworst case scenario‚Äù bars/restaurants. illustrations. restaurant good ventilation you‚Äôre shorter period time risk somewhere middle that. Fauci saying vaccine spring 2021 since pandemic began. Nothing changed. music slows little time body added, gets creepier time Also way places mask mandates Yep. I'm way productive, point find struggling find work finished everything normally would office 2pm.

And get extra hour sleep, usually finish workout time I'd commuting.  THANKS G.O.P.! Like relief states people pandemic Oh, turn tables. That‚Äôs real, it‚Äôs high awhile now. Republicans posed multiple variations stimulus bills

Congress passed relief bill months ago


Republican majority senate refuses pass unless make cuts state funding

They holding people hostage give less congress insists people fully taken care could enforced super strict lockdowns March heard arguments them. expect businesses stay afloat half measures months end, instead 8 weeks pain/government debt relatively normal life? true now. 6 months think people begging policy gets us zero cases lost much time. Businesses, lives, sanity. Also there's big 1st/2nd gen asian population wear masks they're sick. Non-asian Australians never really covid we're quite used seeing understand logic. tourism there's actually evidence places remained open pandemic receiving much higher volume tourists otherwise would, there's nowhere else people go. good example recent Wendover video YouTube discussing resort town Baja California saw surge tourists summer stayed open. work ways. Remindme! 1 January honestly think power move. felt control slipping soon opportunity try grab back took it. Children less affected adults, mentioned prior physical attendance important schooling offices.  live payday payday small towns far cities housing generally cheaper respective income less.

They going vote republican make sure capitalism prospers need social safety rich day now. Phoenix good secondary city, except housing pretty expensive here. schools great. think they‚Äôre referring idea lot transmission comes small gatherings, masks removed. People tell okay friends over, family members, masks come off, everyone gets sick. Absolutely. That's said ""taking turns"". ""Yeah that's there's tests...""

""It's even bad...""

""I mean look Europe...""

""Well China's fault...""

I hate living Midwest. everywhere...a pandemic corporate control. Accomplished Blame conservative provincial parties. Quebec Ontario impacted most. ask struggling American would rather sh*** deal gives 1200 USD today better deal gives 2000 USD February think would prefer?

Ask republicans holding hostage going vacation instead passing bill Texas looks starting second wave. Though Texas big enough know new regions Texas getting first wave places got hit summer getting second wave. Would interesting see first cases ""asymptomatic"" first go around. (False Positive).

They got cocky, getting real deal. personally know person scenario. Ahhhh, ol' propoganda trick...not like majority employees can't see it. get free time otherwise spend commuting. According chart, nearly 1/2 million died US. figures going broadly discussed media? Ok, make money? I'm sorry, can't get around political partisan. political subs better suited this. let play 8th inning, though knew positive 2nd? guess depends job. definitely work 35h France. 35h would part time üòÇ Every state mask mandate we've spent billions federal state aide... stinks...I wish corporations idea American work week would hurry evolve. mostly middle managers effectively proven redundant.

Now output based. meetings goof behind closed doors day longer ""being productive"". 

They've collectively losing shit since March. idea suppress R0. push R0 &lt; 1 win. 

We still requires universal masking. can't push 1, least slow down. 

We could actually contained covid acted early enough, right lost battle already. 'Just reminder, Biden get office January even wins '

This + Trump push forward ton orders + google Schedule F.

He wants directors agencies report list employees newly created Schedule F, later Dec. 31st, might involved ""prohibited personnel action""b (8)(9)(14). law covering rules testifying, orders would breaks laws, accessing peoples medical records ect ect. Schedule F new category personnel usually change President leaves. parties 

Trumps administration thos day denies pandemic opposes mitogating measures contrary scientists

Stop ""both care actually passing stimulus.


Congress passed relief bill, trump senate reguse pass it

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Fuck would respect someone wants kill me? Dont give shit. Go boot strap self horse road First all, previously talking federal mask mandate, local restrictions. course businesses impose mask restrictions certainly help prevent transmission. However, federal mask mandate going force anti-mask businesses people compliant without sort draconian tracking system. way achieve kind effective federal oversight.

To dive article itself, states 54% people live areas ‚Äúmask restrictions‚Äù yet 80% public report wearing masks. large percentage population wear masks regardless ‚Äúmandates‚Äù. highly unlikely point pandemic expanded mask mandates would get meaningful amount 20% still wearing masks change minds.

The higher incidence virus zip codes without ‚Äúmask restrictions‚Äù brainer. Businesses local government reflection community serve. serves follow communities imposing local mask restrictions majority population living them. Trying force communities wear masks ‚Äú‚Äòmandates‚Äù unlikely actually result high compliance.

With said, I‚Äôm businesses local government imposing mask mandates. think helps. federal level, far point pandemic, want better, intricate plan ‚ÄúNational mask mandate‚Äù. article display evidence masks work, already knew. makes convincing argument mask mandates take account baseline compliance confounding factors.

Development initial validation COVID Stress Scales: Happy hear ok everyone know ok. Unfortunately, know several family members fate.

Regardless, lockdowns real weapon proven time time work globally. work. prevent hospitals becoming beyond overwhelmed, leads suffering unnecessary deaths.

Yes, fully understand economic impact has. sometimes, choice. winter give us chance see leadership local National level really made of. Thus far, even local level area, erasing guidelines. went past threshold schools closed Monday county. Schools remain open. changing rules guidelines real time. playing God, think know scientists continuously beat drum essentially hell coming winter, pretending leaders halloween. interesting times... 

Hopefully everyone learned first time around. Hopefully secondary income sources case primary goes away. Hopefully followed science, understand real guidelines, watch (not media puts there) prepared. honest achievement done despite federal government. state government stuck guns face tremendous political pressure sensational media headlines harsh extreme lockdowns. Australia lucky. Yeah that‚Äôs everywhere. covering backs, virus given wholesale percentage defects time lawsuits would catastrophic.

I know boomers always nose out, whether actual ignorance inflexibility new thing. think underestimates little Americans going give fuck virus obeying restrictions vaccine widely available. Hopefully they'll giving masks need kinda ignored post, regarding politics all.

America top-down seemed fight science, avoid common sense this.

While may EVENTUALLY get numbers firmly believe better reaction stringent lockdowns/adhering policies would made huge difference.

You seem know little stuff, also know main goal pandemic slow infections number people get minimized time cure/prevention exists. 

America done nothing slow virus all. big countries still faring great, they've slowed significantly America did. America's already exponential, y-axis rocket ship. late. 500k new cases week probably means 5MM new infections. guys well past inflection point. Good luck Godspeed. Please, please, please. Don‚Äôt this. I‚Äôve worked places impacted this. It‚Äôs horrible thing. can‚Äôt access past records. can‚Äôt order tests.

It‚Äôs really silly comparison you‚Äôre making. I'm sorry loss, vaccines available masking distancing over. Except ton families, wives, little kids field celebration. Denying care massive scale healthcare system crumbles, doctors/ nurses already overworked last sentence makes little sense. one dude got stabbed like 25 times. I'd take chances COVID say I'd rather choose. still care I'm still phased it. ? based quote.... garbage.

wait better articulated statement.

essentially original average hospital stay 29 days.

current 22 day.

now; based preliminary data earlier tests drug; dropping rate closer 17 19 days from.the 22 day current threshold, itself. (testing covid showed up; mid 2019.)

the severity cases however us super important. even still hospital; reduce severity, improve healthcare rest patients.

currently questioning would equivilant topological ointment moment. (again, access reports.  looks better claiming opiods effective treatment.)

edit: clarify; I'd expect average rate show 22 days, 29.  1 114 arguing american friend asked pretty confidently, prove point, ‚Äúcan insult president country arrested?‚Äù. like, course! many countries. Many Americans seem educated way makes believe unique many things fact, norm democracies, give take. pointing UBI solve overdose problem  America finally shows joke long time.  South fucken Dakota , give Yesterday White House listed 'Ending Covid-19 Pandemic' one accomplishments: Muh ‚Äúmullins‚Äù dead  Yes going keep climbing change something Reply bug. can't see delete point almost seems purpose. saw happened 2008.

Seriously? sake argument though, I'll address it. Nowhere acknowledge locking New York effect reducing caseloads point excess hospital cases needed. models ""incorrect""? effectiveness lockdown, that's why.

Next, position masks. ever thought fact risk, half Americans are? Wearing mask, provide personal benefits, main reason wear them. wear reduce transmission, reduces likelihood vulnerable getting disease prevent economic impact widespread illness (unlike social distancing measures, masks restriction neutral economy). That's incentive mandate masks. protecting yourself, screw mandates, clearly case. Simple, make doctor's personal choice whether treat covid patients refused wear masks. Substantially lower death rate US Haha, look Michigan...these people brain dead That's I'm wondering, specifically who? everyone working successfully, bringing everyone back work make money right? Draconian bullshit taking pandemic half assed attitude allowing millions die 6 12 months I've assuming average keep mind usually Coronavirus there's lot variation patients average 12 months immunity still almost 10% people per month losing immunity.

In case expect particularly long-term strong immunity coronavirus general, that's immunity-based strategies less needed written right start.

The use immunity hopefully protect vaccine comes unlucky enough get perhaps medical industry allow job bit less fear, without periodic testing know personal immunity going drop can't bet certain amount months. tossing there... vaccine treatment, related note, insurance pay HPV vaccine, would pay cancers associated HPV. Obviously everyone's coverage same, I'm saying, even insurance cover treatment, that's guarantee vaccine coverage.

Okay.... Haha nice. Im canadian particular province alot irish history next 0 cases. community transmission months. also provincial mask mandate. even though covid, wear masks case. bars restaurants amd everything open. We're lucky.

People... wear fucking mask. Even new cases come travel havent spread months wear masks. 

To end point. I'm lucky dont see people often work. said, wore mask less hour last week. Aka buying gas, food, booze picking pizza. really wasnt hard. Rural Southeast Oregon, whoever wondering. 

Their % infected rate 6x Oregon overall. Worst prophecy fulfillment ever! ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

I taught both. It‚Äôs even Czechia Google Maps. Yeah. too. cite ""the science"" unless actually sources. do.

[Philadelphia pediatrician Paul Offit: Prepare wear masks socially distance even getting COVID-19 Offit's former vaccine developer. I'd trust something like this.

I've essential worker working thing whole time I'm like fatigued it.

I wear mask socially distance, hard really? state does?

EU states going back lockdown.

Btw ambulance drivers wear masks? Yes ""offended"" - privilege

any day someone working whitehouse resign they've earned right STFU Shit, forgot important part - social distancing. certain things happen right (bars large gatherings example), beyond need hard lock downs near total mask compliance. never happen, though, lockdowns come, side effects entails. may shut cases, least things spiral control like happened really started opening up. Asian countries mask-wearing culture significant plus beating COVID. 

I think non-mask-wearing culture, pretty well NZ. South coastal regions temp year around. north India flucates every season. Excellent article scroll mobile, really well made *will not. open article without Account. Hospitals Germany full december nothing would done- said ‚ÄûRegirung‚Äú yesterday. I'm teacher going back person week Thanksgiving (great timing spread family). Poor ventilation unfortunately standard schools across U.S., including one teach. already yearly mold problems. depressing people taking seriously.

On top that, enough room social distance cafeteria, students eating classrooms. I'm going tell students bring coats invite eat outside long get away it.

In response complaints ventilation, told keep classroom doors open help air flow. violates locked door rules already place safety. mess. Exactly. follow science make observations based upon data, bad want situation be. Everyone wants taiwan china invades. year 2020 IKEA bouncers.

Wild year. much time would take clear?  Sounds like one protests/riots/BLM rallies normal, death Empire. quote it‚Äôs about, article.

From outset Covid-19 pandemic, Administration taken decisive actions engage scientists health professionals academic, industry, government understand, treat defeat disease,‚Äù report read. Shitty site can't, died virgin. loser noob lol. im beyond offended. im disgusted this. dude, places Europe bad people crazy. exclusive one country. do. surprise me. Europe things right march May, that, bullshit, mostly EU saw actual cost procedures.

It simple math: Patients dying/needing care vs money loss lockdowns (proper ones) effect political situation.

To deadly(!) honest: Elders dying basically saving money: work, collect pension put load health-services, even normal times.

It is, thinking money politics, win-win situation keep infection going keeping economy going time. 

The productive part population affected much anyway.

And ever met compassionate politician?  Netherlands death rate one way look this. would be, look hospitalization rate. Around 5% need go hospital. 70.000 people infected today 3.500 need go hospital. Tomorrow another 3.500 more. hospital beds full, deathrate become lot higher. effect everyone, people covid. get really bad. Also, medical personal  got high risk infected, able work anymore, situation like belgium, even infected doctors work, many patients. 

Also, says, dying = harmless. know several people covid, didn¬¥t die it. sick like hell, weeks, still struggeling. 

I feeling, many people underestimate covid even flu. lot people say flu, even cold. 

A flu serious illness, high fevers pretty much knocks completely ever one, don¬¥t wish experience anyone. actually think dems wouldn‚Äôt damn thing ??......think evil evil, two sides odds other, reason foreign propaganda also problem country. basis vs less perfect choose basis? That's rather nothing approach thinking.

Do everything life, like answer 100% perfect throw associated information out?

How ever learn like that?  Nope. get ticket Disneyland ventilator parents deal child day long, probably worse getting hospitalized intubed! oO 1. False negative far common false positive PCR. Going Bayesian inference, patient shall presumed positive negative result positive result. 

2. False positive PCR low probability event requires strong evidence. even less likely get lab look contamination amplified noise.

3. CDC investigates case separately. dismiss whole. define leader? seen one since 2015 seems irrelevant widespread Damn Canada, small stupid minority. title sex tape? ***unfartanate*** world come this. basically Joker without creativity, wit, charm Yeah. use parfum never care smell parfum antimaskers. never problem masks. Scooter users hospital workers wear anyway. public transport mask mandate since April gave operators reason refuse whoever wasn‚Äôt wearing one. 

In early stages, say Feb-April, gatherings discouraged; large gatherings indoors)were banned, lot smaller events cancelled anyway business really wanted risk shut down; meetings moved online, weddings stuff cancelled delayed; basically keeping contact simple possible. point didn‚Äôt invite friends houses; interactions outside immediate family minimised. even banned parents (both 70s) house work hospital. want see grandkids, use FaceTime. 

Schools even interesting; desks pulled apart, masks times, indoor group work, food sharing. kids brought packed lunches home many parents felt safer way. 

Some businesses split office staff groups, placed different office rooms never meet (and ban office interactions) someone tested positive one group get isolated. 

We also ordered delivery bought takeaway restaurants instead eating (interestingly lot people deliberately ordered lot instead cooking home knew eateries could struggle), hand spray dispensers everywhere, point buildings mask entry policy mandate place. Restaurants pulled tables apart, limited capacity, developed sorts takeaway meals; interesting mealboxes ever period. borrow experts. seem ... competent. Hopefully you‚Äôre leaving soon almost White House done everything Russian puppet would. Recommended Dr. Peter Baillie. crack doctor?

Dr Li Meng widely published respected virologist. trump probably either, they've drawn attention I'm sure they'll next go. Oh OK need give Pfizer, Johnson Johnson etc 2 billion develop vaccine. 
Wrap AztraZeneca we're good over.

/s people hospital first lockdown started, yet we're allowed go work, school, planned last month (previous lockdown lasted two months).

I see could work well first lockdown did. Actually trying report less cases, case India effort stronger, test lower tests positive showing major lack test). strong nationalistic parties love country much care rules Source scientific understanding COVID spreads infographic/simulator suggests? 

At best small number anecdoctal instances airborne spread one several explanations outcome. certainly quantitative data simulator reliably built around.

If infographics' conclusions accurate, R value would masks would ineffective disease would ripped entire population now, like airborne transmitted diseases. bed covers opening windows? Physicist specializing quantum field theories here: No. mean use word ""there evidence"". evidence suggests principle conservation energy violated.

As result, exist physical theories (citation needed) assume conservation energy. College agree, many middle high school students discipline work playing videogames day instead. put fridge pull week either feed bit (like swap 1/4 cup flour) bake something it. I've tried freezer work well. buy yeast got week's worth store stock, started big jar beginning pandemic. think press release quoted article says defeat, defeated. regular stuff. going great article, probably going get COVID UK eventually, safety measures adherence aren‚Äôt dramatically improved somehow. I‚Äôm afraid won‚Äôt matter care not. won‚Äôt choice whatever, it‚Äôs American way: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got mine, fuck you‚Äù really understand people hard-on Taiwan. hiding bubbling caseload would seen spike now. virus works. crack doctor again? reddit, faux news. also work home, remote working encouraged adults college students, kids.

It's also avoid arrangements parents working home also watch kids day.

/s Yes. already virus either going spreading going getting moment.
So actually safest people around Trump got it, got it, done. That's works. call ‚Äòdick nose‚Äô Melbourne. lot anti maskers here. Taiwanese people general confrontational, mostly passive-aggressive thing staying away staring down. use arguing crazy. Masks mandated public transportations, cops generally scene pretty quickly things escalate. 

As reduce social gatherings, due previous experience population SARS, people stayed home without government telling us so. Wow would thought would happen gathering, first CDC amazing job tracking, many ways would seen violation privacy. never went rampant stages, cases enough track isolate, small gatherings dining restaurants mostly usual, even early stages. 

But normal people indeed reduce time unnecessary activities indoors outdoors, went crowded places.

About big gatherings, traditionally religious pilgrimages, March postponed social pressures. guess could indications felt done time. think cat bag.  got Vitacost, King Arthur Flour brand I'm downplaying Taiwan, know lot harder population density, live Western Australia, state Australia gone 190 days without local cases, know like live place eliminated covid. Life back normal took short sharp 6 week lockdown, closed borders back March/April defeat it. also case Australia states territories South Australia, Tasmania, Northern Territory, ACT extent Queensland. know lot tougher context whole country, well done Taiwan countries successfully contained, controlled eliminated virus. need get N95, KN95, KF94, FFP2 mask. N95s still hard get, ridiculous time, definitely find KN95s. basically filtering capacity, design differences. find one fits/seals well. get elastomeric full half mask respirator (and cover exhale valve cloth surgical mask). second cloth surgical mask isn‚Äôt going help much. mask PM 2.5 filter would theoretically help somewhat cloth/surgical masks untested. Goggles perhaps face shield would help protect optical mucous membrane. I'm Ireland. three ruling parties Level 5 lockdown. yeah, three ruling parties great. amazingly fast, virus unknown less 12 months ago. Good science can't done much quicker this. entire year! Still there. Apt long night begun Thanks, wasn‚Äôt going even read article saw post. don‚Äôt get article headlines written way. Thanks Americans, please remember much line go vote next week. Please, vote make end. PLEASE. know handle this. think convenient comfortable tell people 1 schools closed last weeks autumn holiday. Wow Europe managed get numbers pretty well summer. Hence enormous growth. also stop growth, whereas USA looks reinvent exponential growth again. Manfred give shit. :P know Americans celebrate Halloween, right? like figure speech. Ju√°rez know crime :( it‚Äôs bad place live closing border El Paso impact cities we‚Äôre close, like twin cities that‚Äôs figure speech: we‚Äôre evil twin haha. really matter, patient zero anyway. shut borders, contact traced well never needed lockdown. think I'm gonna cry little leave Gym Sunday knowing last time least 4 weeks üò• know media told this.

USPS delivering effective masks every address. People would give shit used proper carrot stick motivate them. admit would far easier started beginning year, never underestimate good leadership accomplish. need apply kind smoothing data test results lot noise.

That's numbers are, monthly growth 7-day avg worldometers.

I calculation (weekly growth 7-day avg) data since march:

-It peaked around 8 early march

-It's relatively constant around 1.2-1.4 since mid-July (i.e. significantly slower first wave)

-Yes happens dip around 1 start Oct, blip. Go back another week back There's really one supreme court France.

The lockdown decree challenged Conseil d'Etat supreme administrative court. 

As law decree based challenged Conseil constitutionnel mainly specializes review constitutionality legislation. put simply : challenge act directly taken basis law, proceedings ask judge refer Conseil constitutionnel may strike piece legislation down.

So yeah judicial review exercised even case. Sex Ed feels analogous days.

It categorically safer people stick one partner life wait / discuss / test anyone new avoid STDs. Much know that‚Äôs totally people do, communities try teach that. compared communities explain that‚Äôs safest also safer, much worse. 

Of course differences hoping people perfect giving direction fails. Let honest, US stuck first phase vaccine figured out. even it‚Äôs touch go. one won‚Äôt take first version. Sign Vaccine 2.0 3.0, work kinks somewhere else Plague Inc Endgame 
Time mutate mean pick? thought 401(k) essentially savings account cash I'm old? Literally every stump speech makes. can‚Äôt shift money around? impossible taxes?

Where money first stimulus checks come from? talk vaccine fantasy quell unrest. january comes around Fauci say March

No coronavirus ever vaccine, despite scientists trying 70 years common cold strains.

Anyone downvoting - show coronavirus vaccine dozens coronaviruses already know about! SARS, MERS, colds, etc. Id love see it. 

Otherwise youre living candyland thinking crank vaccine year (most vaccines take *decades*!) strain virus *never* vaccine developed human history. think early immediate contact tracing, isolation strict border quarantines more. mask culture helps ton too, well little debate whether virus actually dangerous not. drink home never going long term. saw 300-400 cases wondering wisconsin right think anything right intentionally. People naturally socially distancing outside helped. always blamed Trump matter what. say lockdowns answer, locked countries like France huge spikes.

They say masks answer, fully masked countries around Europe huge spikes. 


The general opinion reddit polar opposite truth. I'm defending Trump, blame wrong place. I‚Äôm gonna assume mean harder, easier.

If government wanted it, could it. It‚Äôs hard. riot. Follow science

 *only it‚Äôs politically expedient. outside US, turn blind eye 

In US it‚Äôs ok discount birth begins biology weight gaining harmful even ‚Äúscience‚Äù doesn‚Äôt agree many times think people comply? wait black friday deaths still lag several weeks like Spring? Previously, consensus seemed 1k deaths reported today would actually numbers two weeks ago. . . entire virus political, especially USA, sad... Fauci said, gives advice virology public health. Economic considerations aren‚Äôt even mind. It‚Äôs President‚Äôs job synthesize information make decisions. Don‚Äôt blame Fauci Trump‚Äôs failure. Sounds like good idea. think got space Belgians kind wondering thing took patients. yeah is? Lol, today's world Fox News Entertainment, old people often end stupid youth! may misinterpreted put hospital. bad. That's lot easier think.  pay health insurance, taxes go bringing withing 5% income, everyone healthcare? sound like amazing deal?

And say can't work, work, many countries, reason works simple: larger risk pools coats *everyone*. everyone consolidated federal health program, would cost less insure government essentially dictates everything medical industry, tuition college ""medical grade"" trash can. Daily reminder peak daily deaths back April ‚úåÔ∏è deliberate. end year we'll see unprecedented levels unemployment globally.  Sure, let's blame public wanting changes undertrained force clearly abusing power carries strong pack mentality good. restrictions? argument doesn‚Äôt work anymore. Everything open. like people walked away homes GFC, I'm surprised people walked away commercial leases. 5 days Covid deaths today‚Äôs 7089 borders closed exceptions. People abusing exceptions come in. also people sneaking boats. basically virus refugee problem lol  That's fine, let natural selection work. use take proven approved vaccine affected anti vaccers masks effective, masked countries states still spikes? shhhhh Lol imagine telling someone think depressed try make people depressed. clueless insensitive remark. pandemic hitting us hard suprised deeply affected poster. dumb comment wow haha. fair said turning corner, means side building full, turn corner, hall. /s  IVIG antibody therapy.

Right. totally safe work master dangerous see friends. Fuck that, hope people riot. wait... KNOW gonna done..? Right!?! fine way got hosting wedding what's point? There's incentive keep it.  Fortunately already went blind jerking off. Brother tested positive today. Untill hits home doesn‚Äôt seem real. test done today wont know till friday saturday hopefully everything turns ok. Biden announced plan deal virus? Interestingly, saw initial increase titer individuals originally tested low moderate titer levels. agreement earlier observations study group indicate seroconversion mild COVID-19 cases might take longer time mount.

Wondering studies showed decrease response dealing predominately mild cases. words, failed register 'bounce'. realize states economics aren‚Äôt local service jobs recreational jobs right? state manufacturing, food, tourism industries too, lot mainly state consumers. 

Using really simple example, imagine state produces cars. state stays open, 49 don‚Äôt. 49 states economies suffer, demand 1/2 new cars normal. 

Well, state 51% ish percent demand product instead 100%. That‚Äôs definitely going affect economy. States don‚Äôt exist bubble. Thank much reply. there‚Äôs ever time make exception, would it. know cases, likely deaths rise. define ‚Äútaking seriously‚Äù? 

Shelter place vaccine? precise, Macron talked possibility families say goodbye dying loved ones. AFAIK first lockdown possible.

Retirement homes really open never fully reopened 1st lockdown. They're fatigued many people ignoring it

That certainly describes me. mean people personally know went way wear masks, social distance, stay home like ""fuck it, time meet buddies eat out, yeah I'm traveling thanksgiving.""

Where especially makes crazy though actions may well forced back office generally looked pariah 1) Trying maintain health 2) believe civic duty prevent spread regardless risk profile. assume immunity 3 months?   work, like first one work. He's one guys uses term ""sportsball"". still think even knows sports, much less like it? Looks like division actually predicted future lol Confirmed deaths. 

It's fairly likely already passed 300k deaths youre counting unconfirmed cases. stupid analogy ridiculous thing ask, know impossible.

Right, exactly go pointing Pacific Islands Authoritarian states tighter border control instructive examples. play hand know hard fathom, America could done better. LOT better. would still overall cases? Probably. things would much better politicised. politics NOTHING pandemic think that's Americas Downfall.

Yes, could done lot better, like seeding infections LTC facilities (like NYC, overwhelmingly highest death rate country). Would ended drastically different trajectory? No. virus widespread community transmission, indefinite transmission suppression without imprisoning entire population. like chased bees jumping pool - they'll wait surface.

Virus gon' virus. Even word ""handouts"" reveals deep flaws belief system. developed nations social services sick, homeless impoverished. massive amount taxes allotted military, yet called ""handout"" then. strand Coronavirus wasn‚Äôt discovered last year December. Hahaha, well, even funny, really solution, population wise, almost peaked. Meme virus Can't tell Covid's messing me, I'm depressed af.

Cant ya'll see , Non maskers impeached corupt lying republican pres &amp; vile admin want dont even hide fact herd immunity.They want ppl Catch covid &amp; die others words give damn bout USA. obvious. past political leadership, sides stopped giving shit. live rural red area still see people wearing masks, others giving shit. go city hella blue, story, people give shit anymore. sound much like torrent 10pesjidi then? able online classes? Maybe online courses helps? different sites offer hopefully find something matching skill set and/or interests?

And others mentioned, try focus things good you. Like cooking / learning cook, exercising home (or even outside, people).

Of course depends mental state, best time use internet personal growth. Sorry loss US federal government purchase medicine? sub COVID yet can't find mention massive announcement today. Strange...

That's how. China needs held accountable. 

You sound like Trump lmao. It‚Äôs stupid thing blame China. may originated there, spread people returning home countries/traveling countries

Massachusetts different rest country though I'm already massive waves layoffs. worst unemployment country one point things gradually opening places hiring local economy gets better. fair state bunch money put aside emergency fund situations like least state staying fiscally solvent able keep state fiscally solvent running without federal aid Septemberish. Meanwhile, Australia ... Check drafts see gaps need plugging. Also buy window film give insulation pretty easily. single pane windows make meaningul difference cold weather. Lastly, slippers sweaters... pretty comfy lower temp degrees prepare it. Yup, it‚Äôs widespread urban *and* rural areas time. particularly problematic thing rural areas nearly hospital capacity deal this. election legal fallout done, virus front center possibly before.

This virus absolutely still ability overwhelm hospitals, get people‚Äôs attention. course whoever loses election use fodder whoever won. seeding across US set, virus blossom flu season Same. GGs Yeah, one unfortunate parts whole thing people convinced wearing masks=bad potentially spreading virus everything right. chance country would've contained matter office. Obama, Bush, whoever....not enough people would done contact tracing, quarantines, etc. way. country prides individualist. 2 new confirmed cases Hong Kong yesterday.

All 23 new domestic cases conversions asymptomatic carriers previously discovered Kashgar. asymptomatic carriers discovered yesterday Kashgar. Justin Turner subject fine and/or suspension MLB violating Covid protocol. good news rest team tested negative flew back LA. Mr. Turner remained Arlington wife, also tested negative.

Personally don‚Äôt think MLB issue harsh punishment. Players Astros caught blatantly cheating years ago none got suspended.

The focus investigation finding allowed Turner back field first place! Same. It‚Äôs government telling cannot safety. That‚Äôs tyranny.  consenting adults, double standard? money asymptomatic kids go school. fact children need vaccine relatively unaffected initial disease. Vaccines diseases kill children tested children agree. probably going give covid vaccine children anyway. TLDR: 24 new imported cases, 23 new domestic cases, 16 new imported asymptomatic carriers, 0 new domestic asymptomatic carrier

Edited earlier entry. Well, hope least covid-infected doctors treating non-covid-infected patients. would stupid move..... Seriously? I‚Äôm Queensland worn mask twice - get tested didn‚Äôt infect test person positive time took daughter hospital (she cough something unrelated). rarely see people wear them. I‚Äôm 100% masks haven‚Äôt community transmission month outbreak risk would wear one. People encouraged get tested symptoms sewage tested find unknown cases. last outbreak got dealt quickly mask recommendations specific areas found cases. Sure there‚Äôs harm taking Vit supplements northern hemisphere especially, significant amount population deficient 

It‚Äôs miracle cure prevention it‚Äôs extremely low cost low effort intervention could make significant difference Quarter Million dead Christmas - ho, ho, fucking ho. That's like, nearly four Vietnam wars.  
 wear mask people, stay bars, social distance, smart, grandma! Yes. learned one thing last year, gravely overestimated intelligence mathematical (as well scientific) literacy people.

and start high opinion. Exactly. could prove restaurants/theaters/gyms/... driving wave closing would significantly lower r ok, close them. can't prove closing them. isn't. People refuse wear mask social distancing definitely contributing. That‚Äôs insane. It‚Äôs almost November we‚Äôre worse right we‚Äôve ever since started. makes even appear another 3-4 months? step ""mission accomplished"". It‚Äôs air currently since don‚Äôt data yet, feel like year going normal point immunity, we‚Äôll need get yearly vaccine. Long term immunity COVID seems unlikely, said since antibodies huge piece puzzle. honestly, that‚Äôs ok, one shot year isn‚Äôt giant imposition. probably isn‚Äôt one viruses one done situation. here? Officials linked spike celebrations Lakes month ago well. 100% they'll cases Dodgers president said would Easter. didn‚Äôt specify year.  White House literally declared beat today stay backyard really gray comparable. flu kills many every year terrorist attack also. what? yup.

yanks. well heck full measure? complete lockdown everyone break mental health lose livelihoods? want? So? US votes electoral college. according US wanted Hillary, Trump president? Boomers wealth, owning 80% stocks surprising. Younger generations basically nothing. Yeah hear you. feel way. But, years working retail treated like lower dirt customers, family working retail / food service now, simply can‚Äôt bring person putting workers risk. home sit, trying figure next park hike even shitty weather. planned finally attend family gathering Halloween. Today whole host household headed testing every last one sick.

Turns cold picked teen attended house party couple weeks ago. gathering cancelled household back minimal contact. I'm talk Rampart people. it'd make look Asian

Oh no, horrible. Absolutely nothing (well, Remembrance Day), I'm idiot, U.S. citizen, realize Nov. 3rd significant date. ::dunce::

Carry-on. Nothing see here. Nerd turned corner! still act barrier stop mindlessly touching nose mouth.  studies they're entirely effective preventing infection, reduce viral load exposed (you may get sick, it'll tend milder case). amount people understand far high. smart. Fauci one scientist, scientists think herd immunity could work. think public epistemology right quite broken. large number non-experts strong opinions, think opinions experts, seem account fact experts disagree among themselves. EASTER reciting talking points now? inject lysol inside cleaning? think depends location. People forget certain parts country got hit back March. places Midwest getting hammered likely first wave places like NY/NJ would second wave cases start again. I‚Äôm expecting another wave northeast ‚Äòwave‚Äô flows back east coast around holidays Well, obviously. many ahead many behind? I‚Äôm mailing list blew bigtime, he's scrambling tell people stay away Thanksgiving Christmas whatnot. Trying stay relevant.

His initial cautions mostly solid, told everybody wearing mask waste time. seems like he's gotten bit distressed loss limelight every day. citing excess deaths *nationwide* compared previous years. 

So excess deaths hard hit regions may ticking outbreaks exploding, decreases back average previously hard hit regions balance equation bring number average marginally average. 

&amp;#x200B;

A telling conclusion could reached look excess mortality rates states experiencing large outbreaks. got put /s think could take look antibodies people susceptible get 2nd time, maybe could 2nd wave. I'm making shit though. Lock t-minus part? Like part Reagan administration oversaw reversal FCC fairness requirements ownership limits, allowing billionaires almost every media outlet US broadcast news opinion benefits them? 

Or (again, Reagan) voucher system drains funds public education funnels religious education?

Or part 40 years? might argument there, Plutocratic takeover country making changes since Reagan's *second* term office. OP said *35* years. know right, like enough problems? let's create more, imaginary ones. windmills likely manufactured elsewhere imported in. installed, takes fraction (skilled) workforce maintain them.  region US, never lockdown. temporary closing schools, elective procedures, in-person dining/drinking. Without exception, everything require motionless packed together indoors found way ""essential."" sensationalizing lockdown rhetoric. hardest hit sectors American economy yet impact ""poorer countries abroad."" referring countries' response, go chastise them. It‚Äôs math. It‚Äôs ECDCs daily updates. believe worried PPE shortages. KF94 masks amazon legit? good place purchase these? 225,000 entirety USA. 1,100 deaths one small sized city Mexico. comparison completely whack. ...so knowingly lied spread misinformation using position authority gain reach. 

Yep, much better, explained nicely. second wave? fuck legal? Thanks money aid coronavirus relief. We're going spend though. federal government withhold 16m funding.  imagine certain people made fun masks back April? encouraged use them? Fauci said prior better understanding virus quickly changed tune consistent ever since. That's science works. think one thing better information found know new thing correct. people still hold onto 7 months ago? have? wear damn masks.  wasn‚Äôt him. lot top experts said this. BUT, flip side is, still are, good place PPE. Fauci said that, understood why. didn‚Äôt want public deplete PPE supplies. 

So, yes, said accurate, there‚Äôs bigger picture. 

1. Fauci president. 
2. 45 knew airborne way interview. So, yeah. Orangemanbad literally is.  honestly hope deaths go high. know virus doctors good options ventilator. ask stupids wear mask social distance, we'll much better shape handle winter may deter poz people traveling? university hatches plans another in-person semester spring, even students expected return, administrators say experience shows well-understood public-health measures work, even amid failure U.S. policy implement broadly. month left Thanksgiving break, students go home in-person classes resume February, there‚Äôs also realization perils remain: Cold weather approaching, cases surrounding communities rise.

I hope places learn example. Basic public health measures work. media bias lunatics nothing help prevent pandemic. That's need start publicizing specific stories people died. were, lived, wanted, died gasping. ‚ÄúUnfortunately, politics gotten way common-sense things need done,‚Äù

No, unfortunately common sense common. Wear mask ffs.  want crazy roller-coaster ride please. Heard wouldnt last till election. are. Baby steps friend. Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia: oh, cool, islands now?  Absolute best news 2020. may helpless stop Coronavirus, citizens must ensure space force uses navy ranks... matter cost still takeout/delivery 2-3 times week, cook pandemic, even now. Usually 4-5 cooked meals (that need recipe, including grilling burgers that) + leftovers week, compared 2 pandemic. truth goes narrative. faced challenge facts, left opts strongarming silence rather discourse. really mind boggling way many herd immunity guild, also believe ‚ÄúPlandemic‚Äù crap. ‚ÄúPlandemic‚Äù real would advocating infections/deaths. It‚Äôs hypocritical. Thankfully I've able get KN99 (airqueen brand think?) masks regularly, way fit much nicer n95 masks. neighbor runs bridal shop, gets suppliers China switched producing masks beginning pandemic. 

Been disinfecting leaving alone days using oven (175¬∞ F 30 minutes) replacing number uses. Sorry mate Germany Nordic countries graph? slipped mind?? Sorry job, irresponsible businesses held accountable spreading virus. must know advance number attendees exceeded rules. still agreed host property. They're complicit. 

Good waer mask. end October. People known better now. know lot people moved dakotas oil related jobs. could see mass exodus shifted wind.

so wind work oil work huh? nothing else? Stalin enters conversation. fault government. 

We're 21k today. 

That's 630k coronamericans.

In June opened everything force people wear masks, even stores. 

Then opened schools normal year. slightest measures prevent spread virus.

Regardless, media absolutely nothing Trump tackles it. intel media. put media Trump knew hand. using Air Force ranks placeholder, Space Force effectively Air Force Space Command.

Not always...

The Flu generally spits fairly consistent strains terms contagious deadly are... 2009 H1N1 (Swine Flu) popped spring Northern Hemisphere vaccine people vulnerable catching spring summer months year. Luckily, happened deadly average seasonal influenza. H3N2 Strain dominated 2018-2019 flu season US actually deadly 2009 H1N1 pandemic.

However, Influenza potential spit highly contagious much deadly strains.

Well said live hualien see maybe 20% wearing masks indoors masks still mandated department stores, banks, post offices.

The researcher leading US response COVID-19, Anthony Fauci, says wishes could transplant Melbourne's attitude towards wearing face masks United States.

In [virtual interview Melbourne University's dean medicine, Shitij Kapur, director Doherty Institute, Sharon Lewin, praised Australia containing virus even though federal system similar US made hard achieve consistency public policy, especially way Melbourne enforced face masks.

üì∑

""I really wish could transplant kind mentality here,"" Anthony Fauci said Melbourne's attitude wearing face masks. 

""I really wish could transplant [that kind here. masks become political statement. People ridiculed wearing masks,"" Dr Fauci said.

""If there's one area life divisiveness health nation. vitriol bad.""

It paralleled economic debate inconceivable US state could shut way Victoria.

Dr Fauci, called ""a disaster"" President Donald Trump week, said maintaining public health without damaging economy one difficult tasks policymakers.

""Before Zoom, meeting situation room White House. use word 'shutdown' 'lockdown', would serious trouble.

I firmly believe continue open businesses, open country prudently prevent surges infection.

‚Äî Anthony Fauci, researcher leading US response COVID-19

""You've got articulate importance maintaining public health without [damaging negating good trying do.

""I firmly believe continue open businesses, open country prudently prevent surges infection.

""You guys gone winter zero flu season, we're hoping we're lucky are. public health measures, prevented spread influenza.""

There many great things federal system, dealing pandemic, officials need states take public health measures. US free all.

Dr Fauci told Melbourne University virtual audience confident vaccine coronavirus would available ""in next months"", although people life would return normal 2022.

He said drug developers talking producing billions doses vaccine.

But important lesson learned HIV, longer life-threatening disease even without vaccine anti-viral treatments become incredibly successful.

If doctors could make quick diagnosis symptomatic person could treat anti-virals.

""If put resources developing direct anti-virals, similar HIV . . . treat days potent anti-virals could really take away fear dread particular disease.

""But learned HIV important engagement community."" infuriating. pandemic special, Randy?! Really?! helpful eating anyways? Even put mask every bite, aerosols settle food itself? 100k per day getting infected UK, they'd better hurry up.
Even constant numbers, would mean 1/3 infected widespread vaccination shows effect (if reduce transmission). currently, new infections doubling week. even read article? ask leave... fought them. 

Yes did, appears attempted failed successfully read article posts responded to. ""she"" asked anything. security guard, ask leave. think realistic lockdown half assed one. Closing schools means lot people cannot work stay home kids. mention stressful kids. saw son get stressed anxious weeks able see friends first lockdown. 

Realistically everyone work home schools essential service sense. 

I think need clearer work home *must* work home rather leaving companies companies won‚Äôt properly unless told must. reason companies France much remote working act slowly. summer prepare second lockdown yet almost none done anything make work better. fact quite opposite trying return ‚Äúnormal‚Äù quickly possible. 

It delicate balancing act think given reasonable response. perfect nothing is. Hopefully enough reduce spread health services overwhelmed getting dangerously close especially live Lyon. 

I‚Äôm French, live here, different perspective French government average true French person. Unfortunately see many people follow guidance properly. wear masks take second leave store. still greet cheek kiss (sans mask). don‚Äôt keep distancing. It‚Äôs difficult France ‚Äútouchy‚Äù people lots hugs kisses social. Changing habits isn‚Äôt easy see. kid postman day greeted 4 neighbours cheek kiss chat minutes.

Victoria run labor, left. federal government far right, yelled state leader entire time. 

Government matters fcuk Scott ""from Marketing"" Morrison, Josh ""im private school cnut"" frydenberg rupert ""fox news"" murdoc. Well, think Wuhan known scientific research I'm sure biological warfare, really surprised researching something. Yes I‚Äôve held theory firmly mind since beginning. work construction, everyone worried massive outbreaks sites 100‚Äôs workers. haven‚Äôt seen outbreaks, one cases without anyone else infected unless rode together work. OPEN AIR greatly reduces transmission risk. Well fairness, Trump‚Äôs mind COVID ended personally it, recovered, clear. man truly give fuck anyone else planet. Pretty sure ongoing rioting anywhere except certain person's imagination.

... also ""anarchist jurisdiction"" ongoing protests. please make claims like knowledgeable statistics. look deaths per capita. 99% survival rate.‚Äù

 say ""it's elderly"". give articles people 30s younger died. ""what preexisting conditions?"" can't speak every case know really healthy active died. always another reason big deal even point facts wife's friend even almost died health nut runs daily. There's also elderly survived anyone's guess severely hit.

People quote numbers statistics area like written stone. mention can't take accurate score yet disengage. 

 Thank essential service know appreciate boat. wife's ex employer disputed PEUC extension lost income end September. Fortunately finally got job week ago nursing home scares death gotta gotta do. Thankfully test twice weekly even enter building. Sorry ramble.

It‚Äôs like botched, sabotaged response it. $10 bucks Biden wins Sudden republicans think covid big deal. feeling Obama-administration this, critics would going insane rage, republican politicians would completely tear apart would front-page news nation-wide. understand democrats fight back way. get lot people feel they're ""above"" this, time gloves come off? herd immunity, now. Boris? Bro lowest like 40 degrees. Fauci going around repeating stuff every day journalists recycling quotes? cannot ignore relations.
Zero percent children die carcrashes never leave house again, yet numbers dont warrant severity measure.

Do know many children died covid germany now? Four people 0 20. Even tho schools opened since long time, even tho already wave worse one.

Also, know long term effects school shutdowns? also going long enough us know, already evidence negatively affecting children.
However, point reasonable resaerch suggests children significant numbers long term effects going school again.

You cannot play game like that. cannot claim trust doctors ignore pediatric doctors.
You ignoring fact doctors warn children getting mental diseases due lockdowns better covid deniers side isle.

You ignore science suits you. also ignore numbers suits you. True. ran away US without full understanding us political landscape suspect. given refuge Trump pointed pals since everyone attacks understanding US politics ignores message. corona virus Cold, even. hope doesn‚Äôt last 60 hours tho. 380 dollars would inconvenient employees do. using rhyming dictionary Especially pandemic becomes worse science people see oncoming train. Buckle winter folks. it, lasted day, well enough go day later. Factor 4-5 undetected/detected ratio. No, car accidents victims never counted corona deaths. you‚Äôve lost job, no. puts stop gap people still working spiraling absolute poverty it‚Äôs separate enhanced unemployment. additional bonus winter prop weak retail holiday season giving people okay bills extra money sink back retail industry protects jobs additional layoffs. still cough medicine March ;) think people advocating herd immunity thing want watch people die. Romantic storyline Michael Bay. Guaranteed crappy movie. 21000 cases one day. Mind blowing numbers saw three local stores go stocked shortages 72 hours. Talking rice, beans,tuna,chicken media US said Trump bad Europe good. Wait, Chinese that. must lie. need like them, keeps telling us amazing are. fair, though, baseball we're talking about. Baseball easiest sport socially distance players is, majority game see player around 50-60 feet anyone else game- guaranteed socially distance bat basepaths. (Having said that, though, Justin Turner third baseman, he's one players [catcher, 1B, 3B] would less social distancing baseball players- even team keeps baserunners third base, umpire stationed third distance.) 

It's still stupid, make fair case safer Turner play (and open air, far away vast majority people field) pull game, put dugout clubhouse. Wholly untrue. Kids growing local areas always plenty contacts grownups kids village also plenty opportunities explore entertain themselves. child locked inside flat. mandate live? would report it. I'd find violates basic safety rights tenant well. Honestly... think want get bad try steal election hit streets say ‚ÄúNational Lockdown covid!‚Äù Marshall streets keep us inside. That‚Äôs pessimistic conspiracy theorist me. 

The rationalist says dumb, lazy, incompetent don‚Äôt know paralyzed fear makes unable act. I'm Midwest, yes many people get news Facebook. 60 get Fox news.

If one person tells CDC sucks keep flip flopping virus come tell truth... think that's happening crummy institution dumdum scientists, strangled white house. Everything bad white house gets blamed narrowly focused stories hammer away one thing, like Fauci said need wear masks March. 7 months ago keep hammering away awful N95 East verify, verify kn95? I‚Äôve seen counterfeit. Bagahahhahahahahaha what!? US hospitals experience problem coming winter months, mainly due holiday parties, indoor dining bars restaurants, usual, pure ignorance science. think actual result 200000 I'm violent person hands actually shaking anger reading this. enough lab capacity handle tests? year's flu impact moderated widespread **mask usage, social distancing frequent hand-washing**. ain't rocket science, people! Donald Trump land fighter jet aircraft carrier declare mission accomplished COVID-19 over? want see scenarios good better ventilation masks. something venues control mask wearing personal choice people eating. 

Energy recovery ventilation high efficiency available years.  Europe, living life n Texas. share incompetent corrupt politicians well, it‚Äôs first time life feel Federal State governments don‚Äôt care whatsoever whether I, family, die literal sense.

No empathy, compassion. feels like living dictatorship instead democratic country government actively trying kill people (go die economy). 10 years ago US seemed serious competent country, nowadays, states majority. yes, would like get back Europe, can‚Äôt rn.  shh, breaks narrative point can't avoid it... need take mask eating. real solution go restaurant someone all. way places mask mandates üôÑ experiment... deleted social media apps, including Reddit, said could use wanted laptop web browser, phone. 

I stopped using Facebook entirely realized reason using old habit. ever felt worse used it, ‚Äúfriends‚Äù use argue eachother / live political echo chamber. I‚Äôve zero desire use Facebook weeks now. 

Reddit... legit went withdrawal there... week over, install ASAP. use Reddit time, web site terrible. 

Imho, Reddit actually pretty similar others far ‚Äúsuggestions‚Äù putting rabbit hole, especially considering subscribing subreddit essentially volunteers that. But, time, lot valuable information Reddit difficult find anywhere else. Wisconsin 38? % positive rate yesterday. rounds 40% forgot Covid toes West Aussie here. kicking arse. We've playing contact sports since June. Restaurants, pubs movies open. Life pretty much normal. Easy forget little Covid free bubble. Good luck world. need covid make brain weird...

(Fixed it! ;). ) 99.4% survival rate. stop worrying it, take evidence washing/sanitizing hands regularly avoiding touching face easy works well. China, they've even found live virus frozen food packages. fact we're seeing huge vector tells taking sensible precautions effective. Americans love told want hear, care whether they're told basis truth whatsoever Yeah March like: need anything calories keeps survive without leaving house. it‚Äôs like: McDonald‚Äôs etc drive throughs. Chipotle easy online ordering pickup (and delivery lol). saved lot money cooking slipped back. costs locking down. Go house comply. We'll let disease gone 10 years, whichever longer. (Oops, mean shorter)

Fatigue set in... fabric holds us together growing thin.

It's shame... real solution much easier. know... wear mask, social distance, clean hands use sanitizer.  Unfortunately lockdown advocates get ask for... we'll pay price. title is:

*Ambulance BBC: Tragic impact rise suicides across London revealed tear jerking documentary*

You could repost correct title avoid breaking rules. Also whitehouse task force: ""the president great job. He's done everything...."" 

Or maybe Pence. Anyway, need come publicly job. State facts president. Fauci seems one, even tip toes around facts time. works 42% population, horrific human beings. Death. draw line death. hundreds thousands. scientific journal basing on? Absolutely thank you. think can‚Äôt get ahead politicians ‚Äúelites‚Äù stacked deck (not lazy, mean stupid - couldn‚Äôt possibly that). way see nothing lose burning whole thing down. true. RIP Mitch I'm responding guy asked people still going large gatherings 8 months pandemic. That's general takeaway people I've talked California New Hampshire.

Most people survive it. older generations really care. 

It's general consensus. people would rather take chances virus enjoy wedding stay locked down, miss experiences, increase survival BLM protests cause spike cases, unlike Trump rallies. Reminds time tried break girl, response was, ""no don't, see next Thursday.""  

This kind thing end healthy way. Covid fake figure 100K England, results tests done England. Coronavirus response devolved, UK region thing. whole administration like 4 years George Bush's ""Mission Accomplished"" banner. Look everyone, got badass can‚Äôt at-home tests new normal? Generally, large events healthy society, viable way get there. poor guy hooked ..... equipment? kids colleagues smaller kids(like age 8 let's say) absolutely tough time dealing first lockdown. really couple provinces serious outbreaks. east coast pretty clear, dontnhear much flat provinces. looked BC lately. Quebec Ontario leading charge happened?

I tell happened: China invested US kept brainwashing citizens ""number #1"" backward China is, pouring money pocket elite class.

Funnily, US today reminds URSS cold war era. ‚ÄúThe party told reject evidence eyes ears. final, essential command.‚Äù head Corona-virus task force speak publicly correct president, know, good country ? reductive view lockdown. I've heard domestic violence, children left alone parents work, people losing job, suicides on. romanticise lockdown please. sorely needed anything ideal. That‚Äôs haven‚Äôt gone bar restaurant 7 months. Hand sanitizer? Fauci level Zhong Nanshan, yet people sending death threats. Flavorade, purple. Metro area keyword here. live totally different environments people replying without knowing they‚Äôre talking about. Spanish flu didn‚Äôt vaccine. idea think said point conversation - think 270 lbs 6-5 Male security guard woman. didn‚Äôt say hoax, making observation hospitalizations also skyrocketing mask mandated, high compliance state think make transmissions lower someone mentioned below, makes said countries receptive mask mandates Yeah, think something unfortunately TBF every country territorial dispute neighbours, that's uncommon Diluted bleach good 24 hours believe. Found example: make sure doesn‚Äôt dry 10 minutes? That‚Äôs crazy. Soap water supposed work well coronavirus, structure lipid envelope. (You didn‚Äôt say coronavirus specifically, I‚Äôm saying.) you? There's plenty epidemiologists saying children less risk less likely spread virus. 

You can't claim allowed talk lacks authority unless want every single one thread provide evidence are. Spanish flu lasted 4 years thru heard immunity. 4 million died. last 10 years. 6 months multiple vaccines already rolled Lol, there's none, NONE report India. Either previous report wrong need pull (my bad) something else going on. However wiki show max positive rate 18% months back post bad. voted :D There‚Äôs pent demand single family homes many areas would probably withstand losing 15% potential buyers. need brain scan ask question Care revise statement? partner SF can‚Äôt say I‚Äôve enjoyed dealings them. hope end one camps. [study suggests people wear glasses regularly less likely catch COVID, answer may well ""yes"". normal caveats: observational, cause-and-effect, etc. etc. know sure. wearing sort eye protection high-risk environment harms nothing/nobody, cheap, might help there's little downside. 

I also read [pantyhose face make effective. extra layer (which much), helps mask conform face better. I've started wearing neck gaiter mask I'm out, reason. neck gaiter provide much additional filtering (they're poor filters), pushes mask face better. üòÖüòÖyou're incredible. 

She asked leave ""altercation"". watch it? sounds like didn't.  Like said DONT HERO call police. White House fight covid-19 ended

I must've missed it; fight *begin?* Oh yes that‚Äôs good point. know they‚Äôre tested one could before... that‚Äôs case comes didn‚Äôt infect back either? I‚Äôm going stop asking questions now, mind go circles. April again... point deserve extinction I've rough fuck news think shit strictly American, man. okay guys white house said defeated COVID-19, probably fluke. 

/s Awful, Covid still going many people die, Trump Presidency mistake. VOTE! Based AutoModerator Please tell insinuate that? I‚Äôm saying hospitalizations skyrocketing mask mandate state also easily backed data health dept *Please stop posting headlines sub 17 times day. know. Thank you. find something productive post.* Oh stop it. survival. course not! one get shit together within next year, there‚Äôs simply many people! gives China excuse genocide them..? USA countries similar size can't. I'm Netherlands I've heard similar stories.

You keep mind though 80% coronavirus infections present either mild symptoms, symptoms all. seems likely partner would caught virus point never noticed. Pretty close Dakotas though. virus kills host unsuccessful.
Ultimately, mutate less lethal infectious pathogens ensure survival. hosts survive means virus.
It‚Äôs numbers game, it‚Äôs going billions years.
Most definitely, first mutation.
This important understand sub like amp new fears re-enforce old ones. 80% spring. sure right now, province majority deaths 80 listed ""outbreak"" related would guess nursing home deaths, lived private homes listed ""close contact"". painful mathematic fact. fucking can't. anyone know recent genetic studies? can‚Äôt remember sure G mutation made contagious less lethal(I think), finds? Yes, again, point testing tracing, 60% people supposed quarantine, still break quarantine mingle people stores public transport?

Treatment better indeed, silver-lining, far. big part reason. count deaths retirement homes covid deaths without even testing person positive.  
Also, government fucked big time releasing lot estrictions end august/september. Within 4 weeks numbers started rising again.  
The population density surely one biggest difficulties.  
Belgium basically one big suburb cities sprinkeled in. uninhabited/remote areas exist. Busses subways driving country, rush hour packed people. Even wearing mask, ideal place virus spread. Tight space, moist air,... way control it, would another lockdown like april. understand it, care economy health people work it. Oh, okay. I've never anywhere US mandatory shopping carts, put dots floors six feet apart. discussion fun watch. I'd say half us scrooged, rest McFucked. Well, people protest wearing masks shouldnt bad outdoors. Im worried offices schools regardless lockdown spread still take place there.

Just unknown extent, wait see. sad back point though since got control. people stopped social distancing mask usage entirely fault here.

Theres countries keep control, mind blowing degenerated western society cant even literally life death situation. Impressive results!  Hopefully put place controls catch isolate new cases start build again. countries really messed things got cases low let get control again. good someone could scare common sense countries think of. 

But would mean caring fellow countrymen, probably communism. Ugh. didn‚Äôt get COVID treatments... say: pretty please cherry top lots sprinkles. ‚ÄúCurrently unspoken plan wait situation catastrophic respond.‚Äù -

This (US)Way Yeah assuming somehow Biden become president. agree looks like Trump everything could possibly contest result accept loss. I'm US I've gathered far entirely possible Trump Bush 2000 get election via supreme court currently mostly republican. really paying attention, everyone getting deranged. [Hive leads [group Groupthink psychological phenomenon occurs within group people desire harmony conformity group results irrational dysfunctional decision-making outcome.

This sub regular basis. ex keeps saying I‚Äôm ‚ÄúPsycho delusional, socialist communist democrat,‚Äù think COVID real. He‚Äôs also hollering gone election. 

So sister. Who‚Äôs nurse.

Welcome Mississippi. No, thinking scientific study assumed action would taken mitigate virus.

We've taken action, lockdowns conservatives complained about, social distancing people understand, masks 30% population refuses wear idiotic reasons. things helped immensely. Things would turned much better certain subset population fight measures every step way.

Remember prediction dropped 60k deaths lockdowns? assuming states would stay locked virus contained. fact people complained haircuts forced reopenings destroyed prediction.

These things hard understand take time learn rather pour effort dismissing conclusions. get corrected, make decades-long commitment change that,‚Äù Fauci said. ‚ÄúThe thing make sure resources concentrated geographically demographic groups clearly higher risk infection get immediate testing, immediate results immediate access health care.‚Äù  inequity limited access health care detrimental effect overall health minority groups, Fauci called unacceptable. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got things societally change that,‚Äù said. ‚ÄúMaybe wake-up call society change.‚Äù

The longer drag disruption, bigger political stimulus needed, higher chance direct political goals. idea. want us safe. asking lock room... thanks! glad dropped watching! you. I'm using cdc's data statements admitted to. tell me. see.

I see cherry-picked data.

[Here similarly cherry-picked version (but opposite fascinatingly self centered person We'll, loses, least president something it.

A good percentage China's violent disputes throughout history territory, understandable China comprised number defined ethnicities. simply dismiss wars would erasure history makes China today ~~(a tyrannical asshole)~~. Besides, even times China warring attempting expand territories, actions historical governments reflect current regimes. CCP notorious genocide forceful Chinese government wants improve people's lives good job. 

Yeah, evidently. seen cases like Hong Kong Tibet Xinjiang. Wow. humanity. Xi brings Mother Theresa knees daily basis. go preach Uyghurs &amp; organ harvesting anti-China topics

LMFAO can't *brush over* genocide happening type, go claim China imperialistic (without evidence support claim, too. ""anti-China"" topics exist reason; based truth. stepped China talked local people, truly studied Chinese history &amp; culture, truly understand Chinese government/dynasties last 4000 years?

Have ever studied Chinese history non-Chinese perspective? textbook handed CCP? haha sound real biased rn. I've building 40 page vaccine research document www.OpenSourceMedicalSupplies.org last 3 months, article one best pieces journalism US vaccine effort date, long shot. Highly recommend long read alley. France Europe? Coincidence deep state too? Considering new person charge way handle virus likely completely different would agree you. reporting like ""finally administration trying protect health constituents"" way report ""differently"" complaints. wish someone would say Trump boasts saving 2 million lives. theoretical estimate nobody changed behavior slightest. oh good shout. i'm familiar gibney quick image search looks really similar campbell thumbnails (bald, kinda thick glasses).... he's listed credits. I'm trying find website maybe people help me.

It assessing COVID risk different scenarios. say are, many people meeting, long. categorize type people are, self-quarantine go groceries? work outside home? also say type meeting is, options indoors outdoors, masked vs unmasked variants windows open stuff.

Does anyone remember site URL? like better Georgia Tech assessment tool 1 close friend EMT, done. therapist telling walk away. sister works mental health care facility Northeast, things low-key told make concerned. cousin burse one major hospitals city snd says already turning away patients. 

Just folks seeing people drop dead streets yet, think nothing worry about. burnout real. virus real. threat system real. wish people could see hear things, maybe could start get real handle this. won't. mean sound pessimistic, I've ran hope. Christmas top-level public health representative equally useless according circle logic. people mentally shutting Fauci, they'll shut Gauci Dauci too. Yeah second wave would mean got cases almost none didn‚Äôt happen. doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean second third wave, probably likely we‚Äôll see one long, slow burn multiple surges til vaccine Well said care due larger first wave thus higher immunity would probably easier Sweden contain second wave countries less immunity population.

NOT: ""Sweden lower second wave Neighbours, LOL!""

This called nuance. TBF, pretty much every race ever seen legislature (many president well), involves kind ""cleaning Washington"" line effect. Heck, even incumbents run this. exactly something new. 

What Trump gets away politicians generally tried making grandiose statements without kind policy discussion sort ""how."" great political blank check, anything general abstract portion governance counts meeting campaign promises. evil. Huh.

So *that* authority figure knowingly lying deceiving public okay, but...

Interesting insight. third wave hoax! even gotten first wave, way third wave still first wave. used DM story everywhere. use duckduckgo uses MS/Yahoo links first result. 

Did read context like shouting head like sort uneducated fucking pick moron... dropped link DM ""Neil Armstrong lands moon"" going kick fuss too? gonna forget Trump admitted tape that‚Äôs it‚Äôs serious disease came public telling people it‚Äôs nothing?  yet, recognize country fight Coronavirus...

WHO reform anyone? Wait wait see it. scroll over. I‚Äôm reading phone dude! It‚Äôs easy see. know Pensacola manufacture one part turbine. see hauling parts port periodically, taking whole highway. turbines anywhere nearby know of, never seen one til went cross country trip years ago. think it‚Äôs interesting make one part, possibly part turbines made different town hauled wherever assembled. I'm sure federal government step quickly address this. I'm sure handful people going get stupid rich pandemic don‚Äôt know. think that‚Äôs high, outlandishly high. Don‚Äôt forget,

1. potential exponential growth. deaths don‚Äôt evenly distributed next 123 days fact probably won‚Äôt be. 
2. medical system gets overwhelmed, fatality rate could go again. Yes difference Germany: Sweden restrictions many households, many people may meet, restaurants forced close, closed service industry, closed amateur sports. fines all. Clearly Germany ... Yes currently around 300,000 COVID deaths (Including excess deaths) winter coming around don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big leap say 500,000. Dont worry. Trump wins, remember good old days. Trump's plan going forward herd immunity. achieve may result millions could ramp much 2,000 deaths per day. peak initial surge 2,250 seven-day average spring level lockdown measures may never see again. We've yet experience wide community spread COVID height cold flu season. ah yeah makes sense thanks vast, vast majority cases transmitted close contact infected person extended period time. wife infected immune. Sure, might smallest possibility gets particles clothes somehow transfer you, want do? Lock house 2 years everyone vaccinated? One hospitals got hit area cyber attacks. said much months ago, downvoted like crazy. 

Fauci brilliant man, doubt intentions good, result indeed contribute flood disinformation, gave conspiracy theorists ammunition. 

I understand lied. simply think right move. Lying rarely is. Haha that‚Äôs funny man. Honestly pretty good school. also like drugs. 
Really don‚Äôt see person capita table. there? Trained Johns Hopkins Yes, unfortunately US border closed non-citizens/legal residents right now; Mexican border still open Americans. predicting lot deaths due flu Covid combo. think 500k definitely upper end could possible. Czech Republic scalped US population would 3000 deaths day. could possible US could reach 3k deaths day sees massive spike cases.

Personally betting 400k deaths end winter. point put situation, without mask. dont know. tell us big guy. 
Here: Ordinary people Herman Cain. 1. downvoted comment denial truth.
2. source indicators hive mind behavior? okok, clear. know **FOR FACT** Russian government holding American hospitals hostage ransom leading deaths American citizens - yes no?    
Because know couple people might interested information. So, it? much higher death rate (Like germany vs sweden currently) either means vulnerable population getting worse, ton unreported cases happening. either Germany much worse job protecting vulnerable soft lockdown Germany ton unreported cases happening making similar all. absolutely correct, true normalcy, la January 2020, return effective treatment and/or vaccine deployed. 

I vividly remember conversation friend early March, normally makes America great undoing covid, especially fierce independence. S.Korea also tested early. numbers great racistas! that's case, vaccine work rely antibodies. Record saying video show election. let bullshit way this. 


Showing Nazi support illegal modern-day Germany. Sweden fine overall. said Sweden would less spread less second wave. correct didn‚Äôt specify exactly countries referring to. Maybe Czech though that‚Äôs tiny bit hard believe. Thank posting. remember freaking sister. Like how? deaths come from? how? 
It still hurts. Hurts country. Hurts families. Hurts suffering that‚Äôs close many don‚Äôt know who‚Äôll next numbers. 

I always remind figure massive collection pain, deaths, grieving suffering cares person fucking tally. 

Like, go ahead tell friend person dies drunk driving caused car crash, ‚Äúpeople die. That‚Äôs that.‚Äù Oh, gee, thanks informing death exists. Sweden also soft lockdown, strict ever. least regions Yep, that's specified. live? Rural downtown? can‚Äôt read table you‚Äôre poster child school closure bad.

It's important take vitamin may indoors usual year.

‚ÄúYou take 10 micrograms (400 IU) vitamin day October early March keep bones muscles healthy.

There reports vitamin reducing risk coronavirus (COVID-19). currently enough evidence support taking vitamin prevent treat coronavirus.

Since difficult people get enough vitamin food alone, everyone (including pregnant breastfeeding women) consider taking daily supplement containing 10 micrograms vitamin autumn winter‚Äù

This NHS advising EVERYONE consider taking daily supplement me? much. trump-haters, fuel fire! Individuals get sick sue club wedding hosts. No. Looks like someone else. Likely Gibney, director himself. broadcast news opinion benefits them? 

I agree, yet repeats narratives blindly. (again, Reagan) voucher system drains funds public education funnels religious education?

That's hasnt happened mass level. worst schools funded well. part 40 years? might argument there, Plutocratic takeover country making changes since Reagan's *second* term office. OP said *35* years.

It sounds like wanna whine one party typical reddit. many. get link subscribe. anyone else see article? I‚Äôm going look sources. Wow. remember back March said would control June. fucking lie That's great expected hospital figure against, fill hospitals mortality rates go still get forced back stricter lockdowns economic damage. half million new cases last 7 days, thing grows exponentially, people taking seriously going continue take seriously. point, herd immunity may end unavoidable destination we're heading involuntarily.

I figure might well fun it, make feel like cosplay something. Also, let's walk unnoticed past acquaintances want stop talk üëçüèº

I've thinking Gupta motivations affiliation American Institute Economic Research. guess, laying right here, points dynamic wealthy countries poor countries:

 seen it, look reaction Costello's statement, knows right. 11.5% population it, that‚Äôs pretty good deaths hospitals never overrun. known masks 100% effective. 50% effective may realistic number. Droplets enter eyes, land person skin later moved mouth, nose eyes. Seems would even resistance unfavorable politicians force mask use. People need stop treating like god, extreme fearmonger wrong quite bit throughout whole thing. plenty epidemiologists medical professionals completely disagree him. Healthline little bit lightweight, one better: wait working vaccine start deciding stop distancing? think much America-centric tunnel vision. end day, world struggled contain pandemic, extension, world negative mental health outcomes. look news india, europe, hubei, latin america, etc., it‚Äôs going lot stuff ‚Äì like talk family india regular basis, situation all-around mess too. B-cells work provide immunity remembering make antibodies. 

This make immunological sense. ""remembering"" make antibodies. Either memory B cell don't. don't, begin process antibody selection lymphoid follicles again. That's going ~2 week process like first go seen widespread reinfections yet.

We ""confirmed"" widespread reinfection yet. Confirmation reinfection limited count homologous reinfections even spread past 45 day time point PCR detection. seasonal coronaviruses, homologous reinfection shown occur. many diseases fall immunity remains.

For seasonal coronaviruses, antibody levels wane, protection reinfection wanes leading reinfection. Again, cells respond reinfection protective reinfection. antibody studies showing lack antibodies 10% infected people, that's recipe reinfection occur case counts get high enough re-encounter virus. behind EU... Anecdote n=1 extreme introvert think definitely handling pandemic lockdown way better almost anyone know. also work MH professional maybe standards well society coping might bit skewed, lol. Hi l Cold weather places going blow Cali water comes numbers issues

Corona stays suspended air hours somewhere like Wisconsin Watch new documentary *Totally Control* I'm debating hit months yet. true based movement data. never masks worn Midwest mask culture never established itself. virus foothold burning like crazy. would wager coasts suffer level destruction mask culture taken hold part. midwest/rust belt takes mask culture wager virus start flattened, that's big IF. give Slovakia lot credit setting good example. did. appreciate support. go lockdown tomorrow numbers would still high couple months, known vote. 

To think many want even fellow Americans vote. referring think there‚Äôs reality that. comes death reporting, though, ultimately, it‚Äôs physician defines death certificate, ‚Ä¶ review death certificates. think, probably less operable cause death, although won‚Äôt say cases. think though [that] comes hospital reimbursement issues individuals get discharged, could play sure.‚Äù

Deaths not, large, inflated due perverse incentives. fact, academic studies suggested may Robert Redfield, way. vaccine approved mid 2021 (not necessarily fully distributed, simply approved), plan needs change. Many people trying hardest compliant restrictions give up. People live lives normally personally feel comfortable with. things get really bad particular area, behavior self correct people naturally go less. massive shift human behavior masks, social distancing, limited gatherings expiration date fear year most. Americans blamed outbreak. right exactly? Yeah numbers suck
In US. many countries Europe higher per capita covid cases US. isn‚Äôt rest world figuring covid US not. countries world excellent covid responses clearly benefited (taiwan, South Korea, New Zealand), also geographical population advantages countries don‚Äôt have. complain, father took went door door looking him.

He never stood chance otherwise.

The ones successful hear pretty much definition. Cases months, deaths go along airborne? fake news? save million lives time Nothing I‚Äôve read comment observable fact frankly, little baseless. think need get outside more. worked Australia, Taiwan, China, New Zealand, Korea.... left work genius also mask less rallies people protecting social injustice exempt mask requirements. Either situation bad COVID-prevention standpoint there's often someone condoning one event condemning other. 

Eventually we'll get point people realize, wrong let people personal liberty participate either one without mask. Tests shown respirators lose much filtration efficiency long period time (Smartair tested N95 30 days, KN95/KF94 use similar filtration design materials).

The fragile part respirators mask self, rather, head band, earloop, etc. saw article day saying 90% hospital beds Liverpool taken COVID (I‚Äôll try find article).

Wait, 90% *hospital beds* period, ICU beds (or UK equivalent is)?  negotiable.

Lol hoaxers negotiating deadly virus? Covid test new fastpass attraction. Hey man... gotta say, everyone else downvoting you, messages ago. 

But adamant masks 'necessary' right now, read take-in actually saying (and think many done same).

My country mask mandate number months now. People ""generally"" compliant public (but less private parties, many fueling current wave), but... wore mandated, human nature want ""stick like sore thumb"". 

I thought masks good. thought needed. also wear told ""had"" to.

Granted, months month ago people **should** know better now. get saying, even cant wholeheartedly agree it.

I'd like hope government ""making"" us, I'd chosen now... knows. metaphor says bars closed drunkards flock schools drink instead? Oh really.

The truth course is, halt spread would help close bars, would help close restaurants, would help close schools, would help close shops workplaces on. would help cement people inside homes like Wuhan citizens. that, enormous human costs, short term long term. prioritise. Florida fully open month sti less outbreaks places restrictions. everyone except lockdowns answer. Or, wait it... wave finally hit Midwest.

Just month ago cities ravaged everyone defending them. Coasts terrible stats rural states near untouched.

Back then, Midwesterners still wearing masks MONTHS outbreaks. would happen sudden masks?

This straw grasping. inevitable. attached 5 articles unbiased sources literally disproving wrote.

You thing lol, even attached article trump claiming protect protections preexisting conditions suing years remove tje time

Lazy gish gallop Especially gun violence Well, least we're becoming anti-vaxxers. reference, 30 NTD equal $1 USD, basically paid manufacturing distribution costs. 52 NTD quick meal street vendor Taipei. really recommend first class pandemic. increased distance nearly enough, food drink services means pax first class mask-less.

In fact, changed Delta profile request automatic upgrade business class (I gold status Delta). I‚Äôm 100% masks right now, I‚Äôm also scared wearing masks covid turn wearing masks forever. I‚Äôve seen people sub call it. hope mask wearing becomes common crowded places like public transportation, I‚Äôm afraid every single public interaction make next several years masked. I‚Äôm California, good us mask mandate right now, I‚Äôm afraid lift even vaccine available. luck next emotionally driven mob opinion

Oh mean like one took CONSTITUTIONAL mandate counted slaves 3/5ths person? BNO basically exclude number tests performed people already tested previously least (so consider test people tested first time). Whereas media use number tests performed (tests retests person) retrieve positive rate I'm pretty sure Erik912's point. I'm big fan Thailand dating scene. 

Hey yeet inexcusable, criminal greed. didn‚Äôt make claims distribution manufacturing.  hope wrong :).

Data data. reduction growth rate fact.

My opinion tomorrow Spain break tendency lowering growing rate. hope wrong. Well can't say think it. problem failure science. studies suggest work (much) distancing important. suggest wear reminder, social experiment, remind people jig up. typical freedom fighters exclaim dislike experiments nonsense.

We patient. matter faith: u believe trust science studies give conflicting results? Science rest faith. meantime, do?

It take many years learn anything solid going now. 

And honest, stuff mind. reading studies. Especially me, since risk factors make vulnerable catch it.

In meantime blood urine already. kidneys hurt. infection values way high might scored colon inflammation.

I careful. wearing masks. yet cannot bring it. always. Good thing is, really see anyone, family, friends nearby. get infected, non-spreader. might end dying rather fast. want say really nice see someone internet get corrected see person acknowledge, appreciate correction, move forward.

I appreciate lol Statistically insignificant relative usual tens thousands ordinarily cross border ever day. problem isn‚Äôt % people wearing masks, it‚Äôs GOP governors caved pressure let businesses shouldn‚Äôt open, open up. great example bars, can‚Äôt sit bar restaurant eat mask yet since public mentally pandemic flock pack places drinking alcohol social distancing. people probably wear mask grocery places. understand jobs/small business aspect it‚Äôs helping one bit. 17k? still made money wedding then. One every 1991 people Illinois tested positive.

The US equivalent would 164,825 new cases. fair going see deaths rise immediately rise cases. lags weeks. So, wear mask I'm exposed COVID 10 occasions, I'll get 5 times?

I know that's article saying, slowing infection rate 50% still means matter time shit ton people infected hospitals capacity.

It's known masks 100% effective. 50% effective may realistic number. Droplets enter eyes, land person skin later moved mouth, nose eyes. mask necessarily protect you. 50% effectiveness pretty lousy, get get get upset. Thats anecdotal though.. hospitals legitimately overrun like El Paso/Wisconsin also hand healthcare workers exaggerate paint darker picture really is. regional opinion.  Follow terrible plan:

""Man, anyone criticize, like came better plan... better plan now... one future.

No, must continue nothing. must continue we've done, listen people have, helped lead us mess. nothing matters, we're going ensure nothing matters, acting like nothing matters.""

Basically want go ship, people want different, better plan. Unfortunately, nothing segmented marketers.

At point society go, 'hmm maybe fucked up, bad?"" instead doubling terrible? We're common's dilemma, status quo worst worlds. people take seriously follow through. New Zealand able handle sans vaccine. know different constraints (much bigger, widely dispersed population etc), indication do-able. Everyone commit individuals can't decide they're *too good restrictions* ruin everyone else. thing health services already brink collapse that's we've record numbers new cases past two weeks means next weeks flood patients hospitals continue. regions hospitals already full now.

I'm going get tested I'd really love work, government presenting end solution current situation condemning even people offer constructive criticism asking good plan we'll mass testing. We've months prepare one lowest hit countries first wave we've done little increase tracing capabilities etc. Azar's timelines wider distribution also appear conflict estimates given government officials. health secretary predicted enough vaccine Americans end March early April, administration's chief vaccine advisor, Moncef Slaoui, written many 300 million doses would ready mid-2021. advanced vaccines, including Pfizer's Moderna's, must given two shots, meaning 300 million doses would cover half U.S. population. 

So like said. Gonna long while. bad Argentina, people still protesting lockdowns. It‚Äôs hard live life still lockdown. I‚Äôm 100% masks right now. Also 100% good hand hygiene though I‚Äôm sure people needed government tell wash hands. I‚Äôm California don‚Äôt see much light end tunnel shutdowns. Even lowest yellow tier covid cases, extremely difficult reach let alone maintain, aren‚Äôt back ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. green tier. dangerous assumption make. could easily get worse. It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre likely get black roulette getting red three times row. good news, think still require lot care demand supply death rate go up. kind expewthis still pretty grim see happen. Honestly, United States isn‚Äôt going anything stop this. coronavirus run course whatever going happen going happen. government made covid-19 political. mention, refuse help citizens simultaneously forcing businesses close limit operations. seriously want chance reduce consequences virus need government step lead. Step help. Step put Americans first first time long time. world watching us look like fools. . . things remember top head:

1. Anyone made quarrantine given housing, food, stipend, assigned case worker/health official required report every day. respecting quarrantine orders would result huge fines arrest. 

2. Mask exports banned ensure everyone could get one, rationed via self-serve kiosks public places, Taipei Metro. tied citizen ID card. Later pandemic opened direct shipping government website also.

3. Temperature monitoring equipment mass scale, similar metal detectors building entrances. 

4. Parents required take child's temperature going school, would recorded. 

5. pandemic, Taiwan, like many Asian countries, already mask-wearing culture. visited family two years ago common see 5% people wearing masks kn subway allergies, wanting spread cold, filter pollution. coughed public space mask on, people would give dirty looks. hope somehow manage avoid catastrophic climate change. wiped lethal pandemic exactly mind.  thinks testing anybody old. He's acting good faith. hell getting information? completely inaccurate. prefer presidents people infected covid Well, fail doesn‚Äôt bode well candidates Yep, don‚Äôt worry we‚Äôll wait Italy announce lockdown, wait two weeks say we‚Äôre fine announce lockdown ! Absolute shit show, hardly surprising though look people supposedly charge ! Coming soon hospital near you. Interesting. Thanks. almost downvoted you, saw replied thinking?

Yeah, many people still believe kids can't spread it. Ofcourse can. ""Their online sample 466 participants (80 percent female, average age 32 years old) lived Switzerland period March April 2020""

Is good sample? Also conveniently left fact recovery rate 90% increasing death rate less 1.5% without vaccine one limited effectiveness restrictions last forever? True that, then. Many people south US don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs big issue either - Fox News says so. bit fucked right now, binary fucked/not-fucked situation. hope think, Pfitzer/AstraZeneca/ModeRna vaccines work, also remember Johnson&amp;Johnson-candidate months behind. Novavax slightly behind on. dozens vaccines currently development even lag behind frontrunners. like go back 0 big three work out. hold little longer. Scientists: vaccine

Putin scientists: make vaccine now

Putin media: vaccine

Scientists: still vaccine

Putin: [hits vaccine machine wrench] vaccine machine, broken. vaccine little Nope. going happen. unconstitutional, I‚Äôm sure could superseded event emergency, Biden isn‚Äôt going push constitution. He‚Äôs hesitant even issue mask mandate issues. assumes functioning medical system, area unlikely within month really think people replace evolution, it‚Äôs herd immunity relates vaccination majority, it‚Äôs evolution, either live genetics favour you, die don‚Äôt. 10% week though based response far, they‚Äôll mess ! horrifying. T-cells B-cells work provide immunity remembering make antibodies. seen widespread reinfections yet. Antibodies many diseases fall immunity remains. probably fairly common based confirmed cases despite little sequencing along anecdotal evidence. almost certainly undercounting whole lot. That's equal 238,135 US cases, looks France's second biggest one day toll ever Lets say four major vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, J&amp;J Oxford) viable get approved end 2020. chances would actually speed vaccination one goes different age groups/sectors people immediate choices whichever one want? 

For example, Oxford prioritized elderly Healthcare workers, Moderna people pre-exisiting conditions, etc minimum wage China set locally ranges RMB10.60 ($1.52) per hour Liaoning RMB21.00 ($3.02) per hour Shanghai. Good luck living that. short passage qoute ""snabbt f√∂rs√§mrad situation"", nothing more. tweet correct, translated whole quote. Either real lockdown like March go nicely January, half-assed thing likely last months 2021...

Actually best path, economically speaking, hard lockdown ; restaurants shops never able keep paying rent situation last, even mention psychological consequences... 

The government idea they're (cf. curfew idea even last two weeks backtracked) Anna Durbin, vaccine researcher Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School Public Health, said public needs understand Covid vaccines may bit people led ‚ÄúWe may see efficacy one trials end 2020, doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre going vaccine available end 2020,‚Äù ‚ÄúI think people take process rushed‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs good thing,‚Äù Durbin said. ‚ÄúAnd certainly, think message heard loud clear even [emergency use authorization] issued, we‚Äôre going enough vaccine everybody [immediately].‚Äù

this pretty much expectation since FDA set two month safety expectation, no? results 2020, availability beginning early 2021. forget blame everyone everything else happen! Yeah sure goofed sec reinfection still stands right common period non negotiable government said Ôøº‚Äùbig outbreak, masks now!‚Äù, quickly would people masks percentage? People taking pandemic seriously. can't take risk. responsible approach would saturate market notion we'll never able prove came from... matter anyway since still deal one ultimately going culpable existence. Remember Italy overrun hospitals 3x current deaths 1/5 official cases. massive undercounting first wave. go official numbers use critical thinking skills better understand data.


My first guess top 3 off. Forgot South America. world would think undercounting th rate undercounting infections general? That's ludicrous.

 PcR tests far, far common sequencing strain. HCQ Part 2: Electric Boogaloo

So people say ""you blindly trust Trump's FDA make safe vaccine time political pressure"", send link? might working Walmart.

I know several people going jobs deal idiot public, masking wiping everything stay safe, still risk. Someone else refusing wear mask back fuck takes. mention hospital workers, at-home nurses, nursing home staffs...

But going do? work take risk, get evicted. Watch kids go hungry wait hours hours food bank. Even people safety cushion saved money run now, already paycheck paycheck double screwed. 

I genuinely point give shit anti-masker lives dies. wish harm, fuck 'em. form lying think all, even most, people suffering 'deserve' actions. giving false sense security moral superiority. WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1! Yeah agree completely. feel like real issue (like months ago beaches first reopened) people willing visit crowded place. represents quarantine fatigue inevitably leads risky practices. park everyone wears mask don‚Äôt indoor dining it‚Äôs probably gonna lead significant increase spread. However signal willingness stuff higher risk infection already know happening cuz it‚Äôs happening summer fall. bought absurd amount pasta months ago. even made dent. Although buy great deal, stockpiling. pleased purchase. 

But also, look attachable bidet? Better toilet paper every way. damm Sturgis rally people! half country's police forces simply ignore impunity. going enforce this? Rounding corner run hill. Well explains extra-morbidity latinos african americans

They're falling covid anti-mask misinfo They're testing more. already much worse. no, same. unlike places slowed things mandates, Dakotas nothing.  ths anthe new record? Oh wow guys hoaxers too? Well that's fine wish he'd spell out. 

""We'll need social distance XYZ""

But right there's blunt open-ended warning public health officials 'even vaccine get us back normal'.

We return normal point. masks. distancing. 'new normal' permanent.

Public health officials need articulate there's end this, otherwise people going throw hands say ""I sacrificed 7 months, ready sacrifice another 5 months winter, even reaching vaccine going change anything? bother?"" North Dickota specifically disingenuous talking total deaths? made claim, back up. 

At moment countries virus ***MORE*** control US does. objective fact, opinion. one saying over, one saying countries perfect, one saying can't get worse. ""patting anyone back"". 

Stop using logical fallacies basis every single sentence write least pretend honest discussion. I‚Äôm introverted extremely. don‚Äôt mind social interactions prefer stay home time definitely strong side. live GF high risk parents. think 0 times fun roughly 30 times since March groceries, doctors appointments, important shit. 

Next weekend, witness friends ceremony best man. It‚Äôs safe, handful close friends park masks social distancing involved. Nothing fancy, props, set up, day commemorate marriage. reverend another friend got certificate online wedding. Immediately ceremony, head home. time go fun stay like next year vaccine out. stated, it‚Äôs starting become clear restrictions, ordering people wear masks social distance Does. Not. Work. perfect world would. everyone wear masks social distance. won‚Äôt. contagious disease bad thing. countries well strong government responses test trace locking goal elimination.

There needs re-evaluation strategy goals US EU Is. Not. Working. Still nobody vaxx wing getting infected probably slow quite bit since half test participants capable getting it. might want look actual data see Dakotas worse state since beginning. already vanishing quickly, faster Tegnell finally admitted masks work August. said FHM recommend Sweden positive trend.

Oh look happened. going recommend masks now? new excuse? alright. congrats part problem. hope like blood hands. dodgers winning + Halloween + thanksgiving + Christmas/New Years really gonna kick extra gear. Nope. That's false. 
I remember businessman tested negative taiwan arriving China, tested positive symptoms wife. 
That like last month. So, Taiwan covid-free. exporting covid worldwide. 
There also report Europe US taiwanese people getting positive PCR tests done right arriving destination.  
So, dilemma here. Either, taiwanese PCR tests, swab throat awfully bad PCR sanal swab tests US China sensitive enough they're catching people shedding dead viral particles. means already positive Taiwan. 
Either way, Taiwan looks like sh!t show. Good. Thin ranks anti-maskers bit. Every person immune someone won‚Äôt spread later someone vulnerable.  Copy/paste another branch thread: 

The ECDC data ourworldintada uses seems put new deaths reported Germany latest date (I doubt 89 deaths reported occurred today) Sweden's data closer Sweden's official FHM numbers are.

It thing spring; Sweden's official numbers formed ""ever-declining curve"" gave illusion deaths always going zero.

Not saying Germany's trend worrying Sweden's numbers useful latest \~10 days. exactly ghetto dude. crazy confirmation bias people desperately want go back way before. anyone know deaths peaked almost day new cases? would expect couple weeks later. caught last week scared could happen opposed actually happened. whole quarantine waiting bad part start thing happened lost sense smell runny nose. I'm 6'2 350lbs I'm high risk category assume. talking Fauci quitting. True testing capacity still quite non-existent here. run icu beds may try something. rhetorical. know wash hands. I'm pointing inconsistency two scenarios. Virus mouth equals risk infection. Whether unwashed hands contaminated food, end result same: risk infection. :) please end Christmas too!! Lol ok champ well want think reinfection common guest Never underestimate power kawaii mascots. judging claims. judging people. Try distinguish difference. Profit margins? Same. compare arm pain flu shot Moderna shot, Moderna almost nothing. noticeable side effects can't attributed long drive test site. Pretty sure got placebo. Umm, kidding? 10 times? many orders magnitudes off. much masks. People still seem get indoor anything really good idea. Gyms, restaurants, bars. Hanging friends. people really socially distanced wore masks could get virus levels way down. WHAT? like cook it? Like stove microwave shit? Fam, fast food ESSENTIAL. Ahh, okay. Yeah, thing massive scale short time prepare. see, I'm worried people genuinely cannot afraid going get tested health problems (weak immune system due cancer etc.) allowed get house. That's stupid. 

You worry them, they're exempt quarantine even get tested, scroll see El Paso &amp; west Texas 7 DMA deaths tripled. sucks Minnesota things right possible (testing tracing ramped considerably, mitigation measures like masks business restrictions) get absolutely fucked dog shit neighbors (ND #1, SD #2, Iowa #5, Wisconsin #9 infected states - Minnesota #30 now)and none matters. UGH! Reinfection command pretty ominous think it. ya gonna believe, star Apprentice, [41st highly cited researcher leadership implies existence populace willing led. you‚Äôre talking US, ain‚Äôt us. Problem still dont know vaccines actually prevent virus, none efficacy data come yet.

Uh, kind circular? 

Press release: ""We announce efficacy data next month""

""That's great, none efficacy data come yet."" nightmare  
The entire world surpass 500,000 daily cases yesterday. 

As country, United States may well 100,000 next week, possibly approaching average 100,000 per day. 500,000 day US highly unlikely. would take 2 months without additional measures reach level. can‚Äôt fathom would happen. probably right, would mean even disastrous stoppage economy. addition things mentioned, pretty proactive siphoning flights affected areas China (then China, rest world) December thru February + enacting strict border quarantine early on. 

They took risk ""overreacting"" December/January paid off. New Zealand directly comparable anywhere else world. Look Berkey Purification Systems. filter bacteria viruses addition everything else. wonder star quarterback caught covid celebrating stellar performance last Friday Well, that‚Äôs silly opinion country essentially invented modern world. Without us, wouldn‚Äôt able post comment. alcohol/tobacco ID checks done state local law enforcement, ATF mess around that. *TapsHead.jpg* 

If staff, need quarantine  locking totally works. look second wave New Zealand. denying something plainly eyes.

You mean like republicans declaring pandemic numbers spike?

Give bro Yes I'm saying testing widespread GP said. could area lot cases right (Lyon) asked refer symptomatic cases? know sorry. USA, ongoing drug shortages. Steroids well *could* stretched beyond capacity coming months. also reagent shortages lab testing/diagnostics...which, again, stretched beyond capacity even coming months. That‚Äôs stealing. That‚Äôs bullshit. don‚Äôt need fight virus, send back! F#@king thieves. F#&amp;king Republican! heavily america-based forum; gives helpful context understand significant number 

(and, ofc, there's weird dick-waving contest western countries whose failure lesser magnitude, might placate americans want feel like we're 'better') people industries, yes. Darwin Award FailFish  would religious exemption wearing mask? mean come on, ridiculous. Oh, sorry, mean people know testing happening - meant many people/companies/groups receiving vague instructions sometimes even contradict other. there's lot logistic communication issues. 
 
Yeah think everyone shares concerns getting infected spot. get test weekend, I'll consider next round depending one goes - anyway really leave house often, matter much me. I'm worried people genuinely cannot afraid going get tested health problems (weak immune system due cancer etc.) allowed get house. That's stupid. Hundreds regular years, efking 2020, alone. understand federal government government limited, specifically enumerated powers, vast majority power given individual states design federalist system... right? question would constitutional provision gives federal government authority mandate people wear masks? conceivable source would commerce clause, source federal legislation past 50+ years. Yes, would probably challenged courts. Botched reopenings, guess. Herd immunity real soon rate, Christmas holidays without restrictions. Wearing mask staying 6 feet apart absolutely normal socializing, runs contrary basic human instinct close together read facial expressions. absolutely right thing going business public, normal way socially interact people. USA also test anyone death see died COVID skews numbers right back be. 

What specifically disingenuous talking total deaths? 

Would prefer total new cases yesterday?

USA: 81,581

Vietnam: 1

China: 42

Singapore: 7

New Zealand: 103

South Korea: 1

Cuba: 49

Australia: 13

Iceland: 97

UAE: 1400

Finland: 215

Iraq: 4,043

USA: 13x combined 

How total new deaths yesterday? 

USA: 1,030

Vietnam: 0

China: 0

Singapore: 0

New Zealand: 0

South Korea: 1

Cuba: 0

Australia: 2

Iceland: 1

UAE: 3

Finland: 0

Iraq: 46

US: 20x combined That‚Äôs interesting thought majority spread seem happening people wearing masks. natural selection virus hasn‚Äôt needed masks factor. 66% cases friend family gatherings indoors. supersoreading events happening gyms, restaurants, bars, college parties, etc. masks common theme.

Edit: oh wait. read comment history. trying actual discussion. anti-masker trying spread bullshit. Blocked. EU citizen fully aware Canada's EU. many US websites I'm able access though. No.

We enough medical schools MD, DO, IMG capturing available talent.

This shown high failure rates IMG schools typically capture students couldn‚Äôt match US based schools.

Beyond primary care residencies rarely fill nationwide, even plenty medical school graduates matching. It‚Äôs tough draw qualified applicants primary care pay incredibly low given time/education investment.

If salaries based supply vs demand, primary care would paid well ROAD, aren‚Äôt. federal regulatory body keep track tens thousands police officers across country? 1 fed per 50 police officers? Quotas no-mask tickets? Mass surveillance?

ATF goes bars liquor stores validate ID checks proper. place right, lose license. That's huge downside them. gonna do, fire police officers? police officers cover eachother's backs straight murder?

Good luck. unenforceable. I'm trial (Moderna) I'm pretty certain got control dose- went going classes week onlinel- leave house unless necessary- yes, might right there. Compliance health directives seems strength many Asian people, obviously far average American. They're looking onset date chart ignoring giant label ""preliminary"" onset dates recent past two weeks. 

Since takes days weeks gather report data, recent days *always* lower numbers. People understand numbers acting bad faith use chart claim there's decline. Imagine that, Trumps little party week ago? strongly agree.

Yet understand pesimistic in-country institutional message. useful containing outbreak. really, no. learn anything first wave? Obama pandemic team, trump fired ya  mean, mean mask could saved grandma??? one told me......... No. I'm done. tortured 8 months part solution. work time move think myself. people confidently ignorant pointless even try educate let alone change mind. avoid much possible indicate stupidity. funny damn near universally true. many leaders opposite sides globe making mistakes again. Nobody ever anything virus inevitably forces hand, point always far late. wondering thing! lockdowns lifted it‚Äôll spread again. chance contain it, times past. going shitty storm weather till end.  imagine case, know, Canada EU. :P talks US. thing happening India. posted covid ward since 5 months slowly mortality decreased. seeing less less ICU admissions. Also patients need oxygen also decreasing. Clubs one places I‚Äôd uncomfortable going honestly much answered question.

also, regardless restrictions, people still going observe place themselves. go restaurant bar now; know people unsafe things may may doing. point continuing? trying convince pathetic person trying sate fragile ego?

It's done, go something productive. Contact tracing studies hard. countries bad spread, case enough contact tracers keep workload, know infected - may untraced index cases present. countries well-controlled spread, case lot material study. order good contact tracing happen, need lot things line up, rare. GREAT fucking call!!!!!!

My psychologist actually recommended stop reading news two weeks, said read news years worse missed life... fact, improved quality life.

I tried two-weeks... goodness like 2 days present much happier. even started forgetting craziness quickly.

I may soon. 

Trust me, great couple months, friend!  Abstract 
Although benefit population-level public facial masking protect others COVID-19 pandemic received great deal attention, discuss one first times hypothesis universal masking reduces ‚Äúinoculum‚Äù dose virus mask-wearer, leading mild asymptomatic infection manifestations. Masks, depending type, filter majority viral particles, all. first discuss near-century-old literature around viral inoculum severity disease (conceptualized LD50 lethal dose virus). include examples rising rates asymptomatic infection population-level masking, including closed settings (e.g., cruise ships) without universal masking. Asymptomatic infections may harmful spread could actually beneficial lead higher rates exposure. Exposing society SARS-CoV-2 without unacceptable consequences severe illness public masking could lead greater community-level immunity slower spread await vaccine. theory viral inoculum mild asymptomatic disease SARS-CoV-2 light population-level masking received little attention one first perspectives discuss evidence supporting theory. rereading work. added several hundred pages last edition pandemic might ""well handled"" time finish. No, actually not. Case law also supports legality PHSA (as premise) Jacobson v Massachusetts 1905, upheld multiple times. specifically enumerated case law liberties unlimited, subject police powers state.

Also CDC complete authority PHSA currently doing. law, mandate. obviously clue talking about. People like spout ""MUH FREEDOMS"" complete idiots. Case law clearly supports position United States government free impede upon rights believes public good time emergency.

Schenk v. U.S, Jacobson v. MA, along various cases support this. fear two weeks behind, ...are calling California liberal state? or..? luck next emotionally driven mob mean like one took CONSTITUTIONAL mandate counted slaves 3/5ths person?

No, protected, reversed long ago.

Notice things evolved away long ago.. would get worse leaves.

Azar spineless shitheel whose presence would missed second - rest current white house occupant's sycophants. We're flushing mess &amp; final gurgles descend drainpipe cannot heard soon enough Apples apples? compare US? president power that. One reasons, addition obvious ones lack ventilation masking impossible eating, kind people take stupid health risks COVID exact type people would indoor dining right now. 45 likes threaten inevitable never inevitable. important objective mitigation/lockdowns reach containment phase. one never reaches containment phase, eases pedal mitigation guidelines, cycles inevitable. initial lockdown may succeeded averting healthcare collapse, expensive deadly keep outbreak burning levels exceeding capacity testing contact tracing efforts. Here's Tweet OP 's link. number cases increased dramatically teh beginning October number ICU admissions deaths not. 

And, June July big spike cases without spike ICU admissions deaths.

So there's already full month's worth data. can't expect data change mind. Nothing permanent except death. test PCR test, eg. output says whether virus DNA sample not. say anything person infecting found DNA actually belonging infectious virus particles. 
A PCR test run certain amount cycles (=time) run long prone get false-positives labs actually run many cycles. Hence family-member cases, could cause it, eg. actual positive-person actually sick.

+genetic factors. science tells us partner selection based lot smell immune system women prefer men different immune system (=better survival rate child). think get logic.

+simple randomness sometimes get lucky. come close partner asymptomatic infectious period sick doubt kiss them... Ok.. would mandate say, would enforced, und authority would enacted? interstate commerce clause? really quiet are? Went day little screen 7 people total. Everyone pretty far apart. Felt ok, perfectly safe ok User name checks answer question, virus need completely disappear order lift restrictions permanently? Yes No? really best time protesters flooding streets?

Is really best time touch hot topic? protests past similar novelty. publicly known abortion always causes big controversy.


Tell me, someone knows reality looks like here, especially time government taken needed focus controversial topic? 

 strong views 

He has, he's good politician, views influence serves people. case, distrust disrespect ruling party. Let's take prime example disorganized government inside. Another lack improvements areas, frequently brought public discussion. deputies double salaries, public health gets nothing, even pandemic? advocating abortion would love see fall Church. 

Some do. Instead negating views, try understand *why* want fall Church much *why* identify polish catholicism publicly controversial law. secret, country, religion Church strictly tied power centuries. older generations somewhat example.

Oh forgot mention Kaczy≈Ñski's words literally ""protect Church cost."" Even young remember life like communists

You're comparing two different states politics, makes sense accordance current situation. European audience makes $0.00, even five minutes might take set five minutes worked loss neurotic introvert, guess research fits well personal experience  ??? political slightest? Yeah, I'm waiting news drop. decided yet ""false positives"" ""undercounting flu"". Let guess, sub absolute truth subreddits think otherwise idiots ? blows mind someone would downvote comment like this... majority people area Northern wearing masks. city recent church ""revival"" camp since sprouted 40 cases. cautious school board moved return hybrid school session back week. morons across street house parties gatherings since Easter. Meanwhile stocking bleach, canned veggies, meats yes even tp again. no. I'm going lift finger help snow blow damn driveway winter. Well know help curb social distancing wearing mask. Yes, virus, people refuse keep others safe using practices, blame. seem ever brief. Well that‚Äôs generally hope anyway. It‚Äôs control group need see get sick sufficiently. Nice try, bot. fooling one. think lot person correcting, words it. many times, someone wrong response hostility insults. person corrected gets understandably irritated. 

That‚Äôs experience least. Coats mandated though? Also coats make comfortable, opposed masks making people less comfortable. Weird comparison... ish. think one things helps fight pandemic taking seriously start. much help current American administration certainly take seriously to, tell rhetoric utilized. reliance states implement restrictions. individual restrictions worked really well Northeast West Coast. However, US States open borders, really really hard stop people crossing want to. said back April need everyone take seriously. Otherwise it'll run fairly predictable pattern. Coasts Major Midwest Cities South Midwest/Far West, and, sure enough, we're seeing exactly Basically virus completely disappear order drop restrictions ever go back?

Taiwan 7 deaths well. Again, everyone take seriously system work. people take seriously, no, can't go back business usual. people take seriously various regions country, deaths vain. want blame people still around we're still discussion 7-8 months later, blaming people take seriously, make effort anything protect people around them, went way endanger people (looking you, governors various states coughFlorida Georgia cough) Cuyahoga county thought 40% would comply. would even higher support one group wasn‚Äôt actively trying spread pandemic fast possible. even talking about? 
We've pretty okay sweden also managed avoid harsh restrictions. 
In addition he's way personally responsible. would expect headline US, country universal healthcare. Hey, you‚Äôre one questioning wash hands. That‚Äôs explained. Please accept sincere condolences loss grandparents best wishes parents. Please safe yourself.  hospitals overwhelmed cases shot up?

Where overwhelmed right now?  Use outline.com steal data!

The article: Sadly, think witnessing is, US states (e.g. Florida), herd immunity without vaccines. wrong, deeply immoral, may even work, looks like we're going find regardless.

I literally can't believe world live right now. solace live SF level control. every bit faith humanity tested.

I also never, ever, ever want hear evangelicals pro life. not. proves it. Count young adult that's contact tracing, especially since large gatherings big part life me. Can't speak everyone who's age group though. shit. sitting back 'trusting' citizens defeat global pandemic strategy. live LA CA still hardly see masks about. Including many police. numbers LA bad long time dip uptrend. interesting chart.  read posted immediate pertinent thoughts:
1- Covid isn‚Äôt finished chart hindsight whereas others rear view. midst ongoing fight
 2- You‚Äôre assuming vast amount resources thrown haven‚Äôt kept much worse point. It‚Äôs interesting say previous response Spanish flu less invasive (and likely consequently less robust) entertain idea might higher level direct harm reduction said pathogen.
3- line reasoning assumes earned buying time figure reduce mortality going pay big time going forward. prevaccine era slowing transmission may completely useless whereas age work around clock expedited solutions time bought may prove invaluable. 

That‚Äôs top head. Thanks sharing chart, it‚Äôs something definitely chew on. there‚Äôs getting around fact delving uncharted territory here.  huge chunk world march winter exponential spread novel coronavirus rough wherever become ubiquitous.  

I find telling people hear saying ‚Äúlet rip‚Äù mostly average citizen (primarily conservative area) yet virtually governments epidemiologists (I know all) seem take look prospect see untenable.  Even Sweden seems telling people vigilant march forward giving local authorities power impose harsher restrictions overall national ones.  

Be safe well. Personally think humans would lot better saw virus enemy eachother. Indeed. confirmed (as far know anyway...) believe France currently testing symptomatic people whereas testing anyone came contact trace. understanding (might wrong) limiting testing much likely virus (i.e. people common COVID symptoms) yield higher positivity rate.

Edit: say confirmed source GP asked longer refer *everyone* contact COVID positive person get COVID test. may local health department policy rather country-wide one. Well, that's smart! mean, cares helping people Covid money could go much deserving place, like destroying environment ruining land people living on?

/s many areas soon look like.

I've hearing since April happened yet. something consider - look charts Spanish Flu... second wave hit hard starting around November... see current chart compare. think one many issues really never got full control position minimize growth winter months. we‚Äôre still first wave ride winter, surely don‚Äôt want see second looks like. also see much smaller ‚Äúthird wave‚Äù Spanish flu... thereby calling 3rd wave makes seem worst behind us... know, we‚Äôre facing based current numbers... that‚Äôs case. Stay safe there!  ""Forced coughs"" like doctor tells ""turn head cough."" estimates going fluctuate wildly looking far future using current trends extrapolating them. spike give crazy high numbers. I'd willing bet good money country starting shut end November. **hopefully** see another trend downward point. either way winter going shit show many levels. isn't, true. Homeworking recommended mandatory.  realize quoted specific court case, Court established five-point rule considering constitutionality expenditure cuts type:
#
The spending must promote ""the general welfare.""
#
The condition must unambiguous.
#
The condition relate ""to federal interest particular national projects programs.""
#
The condition imposed states must not, itself, unconstitutional.
#
The condition must coercive.

Withholding COVID relief funds unless lockdown/mask mandate implemented runs afoul points 4 5. learning still think Tegnell sits dictates restrictions. 

Are implying Carl XVI Gustaf hand absolute power Sweden Tegnell duration pandemic? Rest world: thanks guys, needed cautionary tale something watch home. dont understand people realized everyone themself point. ""WE could shut really hard blah blah"". OK?? could clearly going to. dont get people still commenting well X march. Ok?? really don‚Äôt know trust ......

""World experts infectious disease"" pretty piss-poor job covid response.

Sure, know redditors, nearly much word ""experts"" implies.

No effective planning execution beginning.

China, Taiwan, Vietnam, real experts here. Hummers electric, fuck! someone thought Sweden already achieved herd immunity explain cases close new highs? Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  Hong Kong never lockdown using suppression strategy deal COVID, they're way comparable NZ. Ultimately, gonna hurt venue more, I'm sure they'll stop shenanigans license temporarily pulled. bElievE evReyTh1ng r3ad intRenetz

And do? Believe everything read internet. famous empathy understanding redditors right see average redditor virtue signaling.

Man place gotten sad. meant April 2023. Elementary deduction. ACE2 receptors, main form SARS-CoV2 infection, also found upper esophagus well ileum colon. ever wondered symptom clusters Covid gastro-intestinal related? Well, likeliest candidate multiple routes infection tend generate different symptom clusters. people getting Covid pink eye eye contamination.

If think one second touching public door handle immediately putting finger mouth potentially bad idea pandemic, I'm sure leap exists people think person breathing SARS-CoV2 onto sandwich putting sandwich directly mouth safe. Think McFly. maybe risk less yes, respiratory primary mode infection, others exist too. people want told can't eat want restaurants fail. ok, fair enough. pretend risk eating food prepared someone shedding virus.

You're going need able think feet, one cares health except you. want listen people told masks work false reasons ""there evidence virus airborne"", go right ahead. That's happening nearly much think does. COVID cases pretty much ""inconsiderate assholes"" days, people taking precautions. wearing mask, catching COVID walking past unmasked person Wal Mart ""I still believe ran 2016 publicity Trump TV."" 

Partially true... ran publicity status waning needed ""boost ratings."" Quotes that's said via text extended family member. presidency result popularity growing rolled order become mainstay immediate future. ends means, were. Tremendous numbers! Nobody numbers like that! crazy thing Trump done reasonable job containing virus pushing basic stuff (masks, social distancing) re-election would FAR likely. Right 10% chance according 538 (who gave 30% chance 2016), one big issues weighing polls handling pandemic.

Even purely political strategic viewpoint handling makes sense. someone thought would ""only"" like 50k deaths November thus people would forgive initial mishandling. continued failures may reason lost Biden wins. Yeah, means good 50k people died response virus. Republicans like, *‚Äùbet‚Äù* i'm sure fox news coverage certainly will. NPR still plays them. much still do. Fox Headline: Fauci Downplayed COVID, Dems Blaming Conservatives masks actuallly gay  **AAP govt cites new strategy leading rise** 

Seems got economic strategy mixed covid strategy . UV also promising recirculating room used humans. Fake news! 2 million Fauci‚Äôs estimate worst-case estimate done predictive models based numbers precautions taken US.  Yes it‚Äôs large enough minority wearing masks continuing cycle illness death. non-mandated rate, hit 400K deaths soon.

The American people lost privilege masking civic pride basic human decency. Since that‚Äôs apparently lacking large minority, mask mandate necessary.

Fining people wearing seatbelts speeding seen ‚Äútyranny‚Äù laws implemented. exact situation. stupid lazy ‚Äúright thing‚Äù overall society since they‚Äôre myopic world view, extra steps routine seen infringement rights. bunch babies imo Assuming guilt pre trial prisoners persuasive study.

It's one hospital system one city (NY) 

And control factors, hospitals NY getting overrun March August, course death rate lower August.  One sentiment hear lot ‚Äúthe deaths people old sick gonna die soon anyway.‚Äù I‚Äôm nurse, working inner city ER throughout pandemic. Yes, deaths I‚Äôve seen terminal cancer patients fragile 101-year-olds. I‚Äôve also seen way many 20-somethings pre-existing conditions die. I‚Äôve seen plenty 50-somethings kids graduate high school die. I‚Äôve seen 34-year-old marathoner die. loss life, loss potential, soul-crushing. people complaining much regular death. Smh  ""Election Infection"" üôÑ Wonder conspiracy transition doesn't. strange people think entire rest world willing play along hoax. Even thought entire rest world would willing play along would say something every single person hates leader much willing hoax. no, also allows us invade winter American's largely reaction based society. rare us think terms put aside large amount resources contingency plans. would benefit us all, regards economy, health, education, relationships overall well being, ect started shift proactive society. lepers! literally happen point continue harping it. going happen despite could happen it. doubt. Hopefully virus wakes people touch reality Fauci: don‚Äôt wear masks 200,000 people could die

America: Hold beer beginning kept talking ‚ÄúCovid toes‚Äù stopped mentioning old life exist anymore false positives think? heat kills it! Trumps disinformation people obviously left leaning fearful this?

People fearful Trump trying delegitimize election every turn. disagree. course we'd better without fucking politics thing, think incorrect mandate. 

There's lot still understand pandemic. pick one thing thoroughly absolutely debunked beyond shadow doubt, ""personal responsibility"" angle. think point undebatably, inescapably clear ""personal responsibility"" way go this, least country. failed HORRIFICALLY every single time tried, unfortunately abysmal response revolved around concept. need near enough 100% infection hit death toll. IFR around 0.4%, total population infection would give 1.2m deaths.  good read related mask effectiveness:  months remember ""estimate"" came said ""200k? got joking me, much get payed downplay this?"" got downvoted hell ""fearmongering"" didnt trust ""authorities"" conservative estimates.. time bill gates enemy #1 5g trending facebook, americans still thought liberal hoax... (edit... still do..) told could done of. Also think could handed money. likely due changed behaviour colder weather. Swedes really like outside warm summer months. much cold, windy rainy autumn.  really think quarantine correct either. gets gist right added value sounding scary. ""Hey, stay home avoid close proximity oh btw define bit differently common use - know want"" ring it. know ‚ÄúSpanish Flu‚Äù actually H1N1? Swine Flu. reason pandemic happened probably much poor living standards lack medical knowledge disease itself. agree completely. 

It‚Äôs something weary critical of, absolutely. circumstance, people may profit isn‚Äôt necessarily bad thing. get high score - there‚Äôs still time won‚Äôt able invade winter wish right. 2020 would like talk... said people: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs over! We‚Äôve won! Bigly!‚Äù solving SS Medicare time. swear that‚Äôs plan. funny thing is, swine flu lowkey bungled US (12000 deaths China's 650) covid much worse (230000 deaths China's 4500) flip side would amount money made vaccine what‚Äôs driving record breaking speed. large degree vaccine hasn‚Äôt come quickly vaccines expensive develop, don‚Äôt generate ton revenue, plainly hasn‚Äôt financial incentive develop one fast. 

The flip side companies prioritize profits safety, absolutely past? It‚Äôs quite possible though big pharma CEOs said won‚Äôt rush approval. 

This complex issue sure. CHOKED. Mexico lot worse reported, even U.S.

The politicians lot like Donald Trump. 

They testing blaming rather anything covid. Possibly way sooner another year. Uhh he‚Äôs president? 3k deaths/day would require massive spike infections, really trend moment. Seeing videos Trumptarda actively blocking harassing voters, I'm surprised nobody shot yet. venues believe they're likely get caught.

If believe there's 1/1000 chance getting caught fined pretty much reasonable fine deter them. there's 1/5 chance getting fined something like $200 head probably scary enough.

IIRC long fine trivial vs potential profit get better deterrence increasing (perceived) chance getting fined rather amount fine. first experiments regarding minimal dose planned Jan 2021 UK; it'll give valuable information actual number viral particles cause infection.

[Some info background Fierce Biotech. Maybe PM end abortion ban. 

It would far swifter one act many.

Hear people. Guys. agreement! Stop arguing. ;-)  There‚Äôs another current article based study headline referring ‚Äúmutated strain‚Äù. 

We enough worries; don‚Äôt need shit close Halloween full blue moon üòÜ this.

That deaths 2/3rds mosts populous cities US (populations based [this Wikipedia 

What mean this, people died cities people . . . give scale:

Basically, Boise, Idaho gone.

There one left Baton Rouge Garth Brooks call. 

Salt Lake City ghost town.

Grand Rapids, Michigan Montgomery, Alabama - streets empty. 

Modesto, CA, wiped out. 

If live grew small town, imagine suddenly wiped out. long together? Im sorry, compare get right wing talk media anything left inaccurate. existed way Trump. Trump simply vomiting back theyve hearing generation. simply equivalent Rush Hannity left. Sure polemists dont rival vitriol. Lol this, acting like making fun masks relic past. president still literally constantly, day. debates half rallies.  agree. Companies definitely need try harder make remote working possible. significant enough stop lockdowns, effectively meaningless. Given he's treated them, doubt even 1% military willing break law keep power.

Their oaths constitution, President. Oops! left /s Hes wizard, cant wave wand say im king. supreme court doesnt authority stop counting votes. Neither president.

If Trump could truely whatever wanted 2018 Midterms wouldnt flipped house. election would canceled.

His strength illusion known ""Strongman Con"". Read Teri Kanefield's blog/twitter talks it. HEPA filtration. Air purifiers, high quality respirators rather masks. But, honestly, want put cold. Idk man. Looks like there‚Äôs violence perpetuated sides, scary shit.

I watched video going Times Square day looked like people sides looking trouble. He‚Äôs estimating 100,000-200,000 deaths since March:

‚Ä¢ things called models. someone creates model, put various assumptions. model good accurate assumptions. whenever modelers come in, give worst-case scenario best-case scenario. Generally, reality somewhere middle. never seen model diseases dealt [with] worst-case scenario actually came out. always overshoot. *So use numbers like million, million-and-a-half, 2 million [deaths], almost certainly chart.* Now, impossible, very, unlikely."" -Fauci

Imperial College model predicted 2.2 million deaths America us nothing all. We‚Äôve done things (mainly states took seriously work Trump since spent time downplaying virus instead something it). study quoted. variant 20A.EU1 redditors might recall cropped Summer. currently unclear whether variant spreading transmission advantage virus whether high incidence Spain followed dissemination tourists sufficient explain rapid rise multiple countries. get responsible leadership January. China's military growth nothing compared improvement infrastructure, like high speed railway. Yes leadership throws 2.2M number suddenly legendary masterminds stopping COVID.

2.2M absolutely nothing. remember Bernie freaking saying could high 400k year. remember thinking hit 80k ‚Äúwe‚Äôll never learn this‚Äù. remember still compared swine flu 12k deaths.

The number never mattered charge. hit 2.2M January somehow they‚Äôll say ‚Äòit hands‚Äô ‚Äòit is‚Äô.

It‚Äôs disgusting, it‚Äôs continuing, it‚Äôs criminal. thought supposed billion. alternative four years decline, death, increased fascism. People see country heading, starting actual war force change likely effective waiting four years. smart that's heard. Maybe question think surgeons wear masks. put selfish feelings ahead lives others, timeline pandemic continue pushed back

congrats part problem! hope happy! Still impossible US. Even could force states require mask, state still want enforce it. hard take peoples first amendment rights away, good thing. matter bad want give away. It‚Äôs almost like knows he‚Äôs talking rest world? plot too? even know much research they've done? googled least 5 times looked least 4 different facebook pages! I'm pointing website lot kids unsuccessful young adults. course mutual funds whatnot, they're mad people lol Yes we've known animal models cages separated show transmission. Also pretty clear early contact tracing S. Korea followed air flow patterns infection restaurant. reason across board lockdown needs done today cases high. past point half assing expect type result.

But people fine need targetted control. can't control Americans obese that's reason lockdown. population danger country.

No thanks! long allow religious exemptions mask mandate illegal. People talking ass. Americans would rather live, eat, go broke something kills 1\3 heart disease kills every year. course Nodaks want money go fracking since oil money's gone dry. long get access treatment, hospital system capacity mortality goes up. straight misinformation. Yes, levels certain antibodies decline time, viral infection. However, antibodies immunity-giving component immune system. It‚Äôs little complicated that. Declining antibody levels *not* mean don‚Äôt retain immune response covid. Thanks.  Tbh, could true, I‚Äôm pretty skeptical whether NY prosecutor actually anything it‚Äôs noise speculation. Two hundred thousand dead, let sink in. he's incredible damage doom warnings social distancing masks continue even vaccine rolled out.

It's doom warnings, reality. 

Look, I'm fan herd immunity done right. rhetoric goes wrong way.  anyone actually clicks there, please understand there's nothing ""real"" Michigan. Unfortunately r/Michigan r/Detroit tend typical reddit demographic perspective, unfortunately sub created.

This try hard encourage people never use downvote button ""I disagree"" button. much better discuss interact listen conflicting views. actually listen learn too. Unfortunately nature social media rage-votes really encourage niche echo chambers. happens larger subs too. Imagine coming express distrust covid statistics. Boom 76 downvotes. go find skeptic sub echo become passionate.

Sorry. I'll get soapbox. guess tl;dr - careful downvote. Maybe vote (or even upvote honest discussion) genuine response better approach. saying death toll acceptable, 500k dead end Feb stretching quite bit.


The estimate assumes current trend continues, experiencing huge spike. Similar worst parts beginning estimates million dead year end. spreading exponentially extrapolating numbers came back crazy numbers. However, chances trend continues see wide spread shut downs stringent safety measures place hopefully ""flatten curve"" again. One main reasons seeing fairly decent survival rate hospitals overwhelmed. However happens, mortality rate going go lot. 


So depends things go, allow situation continue unabated, 500k dead actually quite realistic. problem offset diffusion fresh air. need air exchange, recirculate it. So, example, good strategy would fans windows exhausting interior air. reverse extremely hard abortion law. send hooligans fight protesting women. 
No need wants streets pandemic, cold rain. Duh Also significant list end long-term COVID-19 complications. Lots semi-permanent disabilities future. get access healthcare. capacity gets stretched, deaths go back up. It‚Äôs pretty simple. Yes takes one infectious non-mask breather reduce cloth mask efficacy 95%. Covid taught us EVERYONE comply disease flares since it‚Äôs infectious government something put responsibility others everything asked March September, mental health toilet, government nothing help. I'm fucking done.

I'll wear mask public distance strangers I'm done seeing friends. I'm done seeing family. I'm done hiding house work. I'm done harming everyone around seems care living lives. know trying cute everyone's precious second amendment rights - please quick start giving up. please least good news try spinning negative direction?

I feel like people jerk doom gloom pictures people dying street. American society large, particularly care human rights prisoners. Conditions American prisons always pretty bad even covid. would anyone surprise conditions continue shitty covid?  entirely accurate, would say limits Presidential power fully set, effect careless, incompetent, unethical President cause short long term problems entire country.

Too many things past elected officials never done proscribed tradition rather law, needs change.

As far Trump concerned... I'm personally unwilling go another four years repeated virus waves, dying economy, ever increasing fascism, national embarrassment. 

Our country would literally better President current one. Good theory actually learned user sub Riksdagen, Social Democrats, Tegnell pockets Swedish oligarchs (Wallenberg specifically), puppet regime, Tegnell scapegoat keep economy open. kid not, ""something foul Social Democrats"" concluded. I've asking bet money it. ""You wanna put 100 bucks that?"" Everyone far said course, hopefully someone say yes I'll make money stupidity. someone ELI5 this?

I guess question comes national mask mandate mean? Hypothetically say Biden wins next week first thing Jan ""mandates masking"", even enforced, enforced? governors say hell no, states right anything? top even say governors ""mandate"" masks, enforced? 

Is empty threats? ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt people wear mask distance, it‚Äôs like don‚Äôt care anyone else‚Äôs circumstances all‚Äù

Next post: ‚ÄúPeople don‚Äôt live life way think right hard times coming them‚Äù influence various media outlets would shocked even close election. Trump‚Äôs first debate performance abysmal. mean even close. town hall 2nd debate expected Trump. Also time last election polling showing gap narrowing Clinton Trump. Biden‚Äôs polling gaps still remain strong. see landslide win Biden make investments accordingly. That‚Äôs hilarious. wonder it‚Äôs hotspot? See weeks hospitals collapse. nothing ""devastating"" Sweden.

They #6 ranking Europe percapita deaths far better USA.

And restrictions. right, ""full lockdowns"".  requires voter base actually brains wash hear wife's boss pretty often. wife works hospital. boss doctor.  What? wouldn‚Äôt be? goal vaccination program, reach herd immunity combination vaccination natural infection.

If ‚Äúantibodies declining‚Äù poster mentioned, see reply there, that‚Äôs misinformation. Trump specify year, he? 5-D chess! Damn. napkin math conservative estimate January matched Dr. Fauci's estimate even realize it.

I guess goes show sadly predictable US reacting sorts things. clear start. implications reason still widely accepted. can't in-person schools safely example (without good surgical masks kids good ventilation/HEPA filtration, N95 respirators teachers/staff). Indoor dining probably dangerous. Indoor anything except essentials, unless everyone wearing N95s problematic.  Considering world got hoax......  people perceived it. 2.2 million absolutely NOTHING, didn‚Äôt happen, thankfully. But, let‚Äôs let silly facts get way here. grandma lives aunt lockdowns visit mask mandate yet, scared get either sick, stayed away. grandma developed dementia. see almost every day. 

I really regret seeing grandma even though ""risky."" think grandma would developed dementia regardless pandemic, think lockdowns made happen sooner...but do, rob time grandma got dementia. 

I know needed lockdown mask wearing fear instilled us stay inside nothing, think wrong. think needed cautious careful, extent isolation problematic. 

&amp;#x200B;

My grandmother died August; due Covid, things (she 95) stayed away too. died even get see one last time. funeral, town family get close even get see much. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still worried pandemic, getting aunt grandma sick, see grandma much now. wear mask limit amount time besides hugging hello goodbye, sit bit away her. good days bad days want many good days can. dementia getting worse, honestly, virus main concern. would hate get sick pass virus, dementia fucking nightmare, me, dementia worse virus right now.  remember last time saw therapist COVID struck brought anxiety felt unknown societal changes looming given COVID's 2% fatality rate mirrored Leftovers. know best seem skeptical, understandably general public time informed &amp; taking things seriously, there. almost feel like schedule appointment told ya so. posted archive link able use choose way stated general advice, must able show result achieved another way.

This practice mean anyone follow general advice point. Except take economic hit either way. differance kill lot people people going something may attainable. Truth needs protection, lies do. Sunlight best disinfectant. problem way social media allows echo chambers created easily. loses, opens numerous criminal charges forecast 200,000 1.7 million end year. 200,000 best case scenario. üòÇ don‚Äôt Well profit made it‚Äôs sad say one would working hard this. What's discrepancy 1404 hospital admissions +383 hospital, mean 1000 discharged? Florida trial run 2018. I'm reasonably convinced election fuckery Senate Governors races. really strange studies Chinese studies.

Why studies coming USA?

At least, virus seems behaved differently Asia could variety factors (behavioural, etc).

So use American studies show virus behaves USA? think confusing another redditor. said biased media affected US (Trump handled it). Absolutely not. Remember conservative estimates. Secondly, people say ‚Äúpublic health measures‚Äù, mean wearing masks airports late 2021. Locally; bars, restaurants clubs open thriving summer 2021. negotiable. Fauci advisor policy maker (thank god). Nothing survive another year current public health measures place. also ever changing. Nothing says set stone. would very, shocked anybody takes seriously past June 2021. I‚Äôm sorry virus simply dangerous enough. all
Under control It‚Äôs informative though. Posting makes sense. No, good enough. want punishment severe nobody dares consider trying future. vile extreme zero punishment harsh people. I‚Äôm saying focusing energy cloth masks leaves people open things think ‚ÄúI wore mask I‚Äôm good‚Äù.

And like said, cloth masks aren‚Äôt effective. want know n95s haven‚Äôt given out. don‚Äôt access actual safety equipment?

I‚Äôm masks. always wear one. 

I‚Äôm virtue signaling blatant disregard scientific data It‚Äôs getting really tough lately. Cases surging friends family either completely underestimating risks flat giving up. friends dragged restaurant day. Despite heavily increasing cases, social distancing whatsoever, place packed full capacity. difference pre-pandemic waiters waitresses wearing masks. awhile kept telling even get I‚Äôll probably fine since I‚Äôm low risk, scary shit virus keeps coming out, people caring less less. It‚Äôs half per capita rate? also climate change denier bet 20. January Biden win, Fox news headlines ""President Biden responsible 300,000 US COVID deaths."" get blame mess Trump left behind. course gets elected president. I'm still concerned Trump probably declaring victory election night battling results come fraudulent getting supreme court. Well else expected happen reopen without actually anywhere near eradicating infectious disease? Good info. window open even cold office work. Another office windows ventilation lot positive cases last two weeks, thankful windows! 

Also shows governments crusade football pretty unjust comparison industries ha allowed continue. wouldn‚Äôt going games find blanket ban bizarre. people charged terrorism spreading biological pathogen.   effective, they‚Äôd also need strictly control travel borders seems unlikely. numbers high, going hit home populous soon. Different articles different interviews perspectives.  Trump somehow wins, there's going civil war. 2025 heard first 321 million x .7 attack rate x 1 % mortality rate = 2.56 million anyone actually gets caught, need publicly executed violent fashion persuade others even considering again. south carolina may also home newest mlb expansion club Taiwan stay pretty much shut foreigners there‚Äôs vaccine. visitors without long quarantines maybe 2-3 years. Seems insane massive death toll caused ineptitude world's leaders.

Many leaders world inept, fact responded properly problem within means. US UK notable exceptions. r/coronavirusdoomandgloom holding strong.... Oh, like flu vaccines get every season, allow people get sick, don‚Äôt establish herd immunity? You‚Äôre chasing chimera. Dr Fauci always optimistic. That‚Äôs also dependent age, older people obviously requiring hospitalization higher rates. It‚Äôs also hard determine many mild asymptomatic cases never recorded. Overall, around 2% cases estimated require hospitalization per CDC, skewed heavily toward older patients (closer 4.5% cases people 65). could anything hours supplemental oxygen weeks ICU. study NYC March/April, though, showed 6% hospitalized patients chronic underlying condition. 

Basically, you‚Äôre decently healthy, younger person, chance even hospitalized very, low. understand virus spreads asymptomatically ... also understand I‚Äôve around multiple people like ‚Äúyea kinda sick 4days ago I‚Äôm feeling great now‚Äù would great could connect sick global pandemic. 

I‚Äôm guessing bored, waitstaff harass, taking Internet. 

Wearing t-shirt face end solution pandemic. know feels easy focus masks, factors okay well. Credible estimates put forecast end February around 500k.

That's outlandishly high. would hit 2,000 deaths day, minimum, starting *today* reach number end February, 123 days away. 

I'm saying death toll acceptable, 500k dead end Feb stretching quite bit. 

From Times morning: ranked around 40th-42nd spot various gdp/capita charts. poor. people want live like before, something / sacrifice Well, bye bye next year's plans too. Damn it. Let‚Äôs see alternative vaccine verdict Fauci mentioned early December (and election) let‚Äôs see politics play Source this? That‚Äôs exactly stupid people think. üòÇ Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôre using federal COVID funding for...fracking. Well mask mandate many deaths incidents could prevented. much vulnerable get vaccimated February think hospital admissions would drop earlier. I'm particularly afraid going, hope painful. pushing woman wants strip women rights incredibly sexist tone deaf. name fits.

Absolutely clueless. sides bullshit actual misinformation.

Support newspapers, folks, great example why. harm could everyone stockpiling vitamin D, there's vit people actually need it. 40% country read ""Natural Hero Immunity"" get sick die, means they're stronger species deluded fantasy.

It‚Äôs bad idea. Bring sources out, i'm intrested tabloids red.

I‚Äôm sick shit coming left. people batshit insane. yet see solid data that. Another thing consider severe cases hospitalised spring, whereas potentially milder cases also hospitalised thus decreasing hospital mortality rate. Obviously, dexamethasone less intubations beneficial, refrain claiming triumph well supported data. Peg Bundy: Let's watch 4 Weddings Funeral

Fauci several divisions working like ""biodefense"" NiH. There's 8 divisions. one divisions communication director. office 2 directors (main + deputy). that's 10 people, 400h/week resources promoting agenda protecting him. That's without counting everyone else working directors.

Source: non scientist like Bill Gates calling actual doctor like Scott Atlas ""psuedo expert"". Fauci gets sidelined friends, cronies well funded communication department springs defend him.

Source: resources counter Fauci narrative? Nobody man... NiH also one biggest sources funding research orgs/unis/students also happen going health commissioner state - great fool piss great man. 38 years federal bureaucracy build good American people, need get rid him.

Blaming individual wrong. in: Trump know month is. Yep! severe, lasted six weeks, lockdown total 112 days.

- Curfew 8pm 5am every day.
- allowed 5km home.
- 4 valid reasons leave house:
 - work study
 - caring someone
 - shopping (one person per household per day)
 - exercise (one hour per day, max two people)
 - clear, means visiting people except care
- hospitality businesses serve take away only
- students home-based learning
- childcare facilities open children essential workers
- businesses must work home, (essentials excepted)

Pretty crazy write out. :D  think general attitude people personally get vaccine willing roll dice personally. risk gone cure, unofficial end pandemic personally. stop growth exponential growth. stop growth get exponential decay instead. force work genocide them? Borders open, checkpoints EU borders. airports. normal pandemic, least be. order get normal, this, people need accept new normal, control. people problem wearing mask totaly beyond me. Agreed. can't trust kids look ways, easier keep hell away road We're never gonna get thing control, we? Lol... exactly Years instant gratification short attention span media made prolonged fight pandemic basically impossible. 

Prolonged strategies help general public abstract. greater population doesn‚Äôt see results immediately assume doesn‚Äôt work abandon them. They‚Äôll shocked learn virus doesn‚Äôt disappear day vaccine comes Exactly. many ways approach this. 

Simple mask wearing best first place start. 

I understand people can't find middle ground. that. working class I'm ok that. Cause would like KEEP working happen things stay like another year. watch numbers rise shutting anything down. Navarra Pais Vasco much cases. antigen tests, 15 min. results impossible solve funding

of course is.

Your problem seem think centralised EU structure leaves blameless. isnt. people want common foreign office common army cannot even solve basic health problem. imagine EU deciding deploy army response threat - wouldnt even get battlefront. 

The UK built massive number ICU beds short space time China countries.

Why can't Brussels chaps ? policy solves problems simultaneously suggest? many exampes religious celebrations around world led considerable deaths. see god calling faithful home things get even worse - god decided get idiots way give rest world chance.

She may see god bit sooner wants. Global launch.... literally finished enrollment phase III last week. Thats ""confidence"" there. They're gonna drop bleach sky us...

I'd laugh think current administration would stupid enough try it. doctor's worst nightmare... Deciding patient die. Approved, no. Large scale production, yes, began months ago many vaccines produced risk. wonder rationalization people jump becomes apparent reinfection relatively common?

Hard ‚Äôherd immunity‚Äô reinfection already proven, &amp; long-lasting immunity hasn‚Äôt been. 6 known human coronaviruses, none proven long-lasting immunity. SARS-1 &amp; MERS never (publicly) confirmed long lasting immunity via direct rechallenge... speculative papers suggesting cell immunity.

SARS-2 combination traits essentially unprecedented modern diseases, &amp; render easy snuff out.

-Long latency infectiousness even pre-fever(SARS-1 largely snuffed due ability screen temperature)

-Potentially even transmissible flu &amp; similar respiratory illnesses.

-Confirmed short term immunosuppression, potential long term immunosuppression.

-Reinfection/lack long term immunity.

-Potential worse symptoms upon reinfection.

It‚Äôs like someone used SARS-1 trial run &amp; ironed kinks.

If want supporting evidence points, look happening Iran. hit early, &amp; little curb spread... reports out(from official state channels) patients infected 3 times already, &amp; many reinfections making current western media largely ignored situation Iran, horrific death rate countries like Peru - countries, who, mind you, much younger populations &amp; milder 'winters' North American &amp; northern Eurasian countries.

The country lion's share research coronaviruses was/is China. Interesting response outbreaks seems much rapid &amp; radical many countries. exactly best track record giving shit citizens. Perhaps better understanding SARS-2 do. New York lockdown? ""This month"" October. October 3 days left including today... misleading. study showed nearly third covid patients brain scan showed abnormalities. Brain scans ordered patients exhibited symptoms like coma, disorientation, dementia. heavily favoring people brain issues. control group people average coronavirus infection. left Trump Tower pony express months ago. idea masking protects droplets, (or much) aerosols, ventilation protects aerosols? Stay safe friend. But. But. But. Trump told everyone would 2-3 weeks vaccine. Unless, course, virus getting hands move area virus containing aerosol particles...

Besides, cold flu season approaching, getting habit washing hands regularly good idea. me, I've trying use training run develop good habits annual cold/flu season, also preparation whatever universe decides throw way next time. expect California come 38 million tests thin air?

I've always suspected much. 
 
I think really come inherent selfishness American ""rugged individualism"" versus varying degrees filial piety around world. Hey guys! Moderna vaccine trial participant here. Yesterday took second shot COVID. could either placebo original thing 90% sure got real thing times.

When took first shot felt symptoms day 2, fatigue, headache mild fever symptoms subsided right after. 

When came lab yesterday, doctor told would administered dose symptoms may stronger body already primed detect attack virus. 

I think that's exactly happened yesterday last night got 101.2 F fever today dropped 99.0 F. uncomfortable fever let sleep much. 

I still feel kinda wonky dizzy today expect symptoms subside tomorrow. also feel little chilly (I'm Florida) despite opening window turning AC heat. Here's hoping vaccine works. know that. Stop spreading misinformation. Immunity open question research. got science googles Amazon tat actually good looking. kind wrap around eyes. go hospital (unrelatedly covid) glad eyes covered another lie. want make bet (for real money) happen? Put money mouth is.  slovakia become rich country? Japan isn‚Äôt small country. Neither Taiwan, fair.

Imagine infected people walking grocery store. respiratory emissions spread across volume air store, eventually settle exposed surface. means concentration surface contamination, average, square volumetric concentration store's air. that, virus lingers air hours settling surfaces, lingers days, meaning looking probably another factor 5-10x concentration surfaces vs air virtue longer accumulation period. pick pack TP - even careful washing hands, TP comes contact groceries, car, counters home, closets... bringing home 10x concentration virus makes people sick air. point going slip space think clean.

The implication headline key points even vaccine, never get rid covid-19. Even infected, we'll get again. herd immunity (which always though BS concept), defenses go away.

The article nuanced, course.

I'll let little secret. Trump *did* money honor debts, still pay. He'd rather waste money extravagant garbage. Sure, hide money creditors, he's practice before. skeptical 4,500 number first, even China 10 times many deaths reported, would still less deaths US, much larger population. actually scary incompetent Trump is.

2) Population immunity.


Again reason Sars-Cov-2 killing lot people world lot old people. Sars-Cov-2 emerged let's say pre-1950 world would even noticed. 

It would simply spread among young people quickly people old built immunity. happens 200 common cold viruses see bunch 70 year olds killed common colds. That's r/Coronavirus know! Even things everyone staying home using entertainment requires thousands people. Netflix, Reddit, video games, much done people home, lot needs people physically running servers maintaining computer equipment. 

Sometimes wish things would really shut people sit home making food reading books (if even any). they'd learn actual lockdown is. POTUS can't shit states. US sucks Europe. Everyone world raped virus sorry. would wager coasts suffer level destruction mask culture taken hold part.

Nope, masking 100% guarantee, there's still fomite transmission, enough people going social distance holidays, people comfortable unmasking near close friends family, humidity go people indoors poor air circulation, etc, etc. absolutely going spike cases East Coast winter. engage man much sorry, flu vaccine effect covid 19. Obviously want get flu right now, go get vaccine, get covid 19 flu vaccine makes difference it. would simply unenforceable. minimum wage public facing workers going risk getting stabbed, beaten, murdered trying enforce mandate. way hell cop going risk starting riot losing job enforce mandate either.

It kinda crazy think whole world could somehow stay home week, much dent would put this, know impossible, also sounds plausible. another sad pathetic response sad pathetic little boy. Deadass thought already kind one. Testing level early/mid September. really. ‚ÄúKnows stay safe‚Äù
This exactly point. everyone learnt stay safe (or listened people know), (the world) wouldn‚Äôt rough 7 months. know explains viruses ""angry"" first emerge? Take SarsCov2 example, goes many organ systems, causes much damage...Yet still milder cold symptoms. eventually lose widespread attack settle causing sniffles cough. due part back forth immune systems virus?  problem ""when"" wearing mask. live people commonly (though commonly enough) wear mask business. However get together friends home evening mask. That's what's driving spread here. don‚Äôt know talking about. 

For starters, Sweden universal healthcare payed sick leave extended three weeks without doctors note, due covid. made possible swedes actually stay home pay symptoms (per recommendations) quarantine (due contact tracing). Covid tests free charge, even antibody tests. questions asked. 

I don‚Äôt think makes good control USA.  percent 75 percent working critical jobs (hospital, sewer systems etc) many cleaning people‚Äôs stuff, serving, cutting hair? Rich people could wash stuff couple months. would take something like universal basic income couple months. would incredibly disruptive.  would also imply taxing rich (eventually) pay it. still might least bad option. would also shut private parties, might impossible implement. leader would help. Someone willing coordinate states provide financing things state government cannot own. quite options. Herd immunity solution pandemic like windshield crash restraint. want go catch COVID I'm sure manage. solutions?

Slow testing?

It is? need background science understand basic science think myself. classic appeal authority fallacy. website says, emergency facts figures. bunch bullshit. 

I agree virus anywhere near level threat think is. worse flu, numbers say point. delusion propped media politicians, weird ass people like sub.

Put r/confidentlyincorrect problem. People acting carelessly indifferent possible harm might bring others. ""That's life."" countries better did, got spread back close zero

Actions consequences. worst thing Czech Republic is, still plenty people wearing mask properly, washing hands getting big crowds farmers markets grocery stores. would happily go pub bar drink others wouldnt prohibited. instead many private parties got banned too. plenty saying numbers fake situation bad all... many, believe could close 50% population, really government bad job managing this, people dont believe anything even remotely scientific. many conspiracies taken seriously here. Even people know smart critical thinking normally, seems lost minds nowadays. Absolutely horrible. problems get fact many people act like this. I'm talking today.

You say thanks now, problem people say thanks targeted control back April. Tough decisions never easy. reality we're working twisted view 230k deaths lot even though over. Americans wearing masks much domestic international media seem suggest:

Trump really conservative Republican. He's done lot things democrats wanting ages like prison reform capping insulin costs. lot traditional conservatives can't stand guy lot blue collar democrats love him. really get appeal.
There also scientific consensus. Sweden's scientists (who educated) disagreed tried different approach. know turned count bodies 3 years. new. theory. WHO, CDC, everyone saying masks pointless March. clearly weren't, lot damage.
I huge Dr. Fauci plan, think lot people terrified COVID listen scary soundbites says. wants schools open well. favor absolute shutdown except severe disease areas.

With said, know shit , neither you. covid patients die weeks doesn¬¥t matter deadly spreading. say.. which.. April? start chiming dumb theories job. start conversation blaming fake car repair place making transmission go bad fixed flat tire. Even shown lying whole event quintuple accuse one ""THEM!"". ama exactly good yardstick anything. I'd say website good job. first guy specify anyway. Unfortunately, people listening. political leaders seem care.  know sure best, amazing system. true. is. ""Downplaying 200k""? Thats gonna say?!

You forgot ""Hitler. Oranhemanbad. Homophobic. Xenophobic. Islamophobic. Cages. Border. Kids. Auschwitz.""

Do half ass low IQ child ""boomer boomer"" talk trained years with. 
It's ordered all. Get line PARTY message comrade child. suggesting suggestions? 2.2 million figure assuming changes made behavior. businesses changed operated, nobody wore masks, schools closed, etc. reason 2.2 million number joke obviously way 2.2 million deaths, changes made therefore it'd pretty hard actually hit number even tried. *world‚Äòs* leaders? one mobster WH enablers responsible shitshow US. ""Would happy let Fauci change gearbox?"" mutated variant Spain tourists go ICU Imo national mask mandate unenforceable really help much unless specifically targets indoor usage. Masks important sure, 5-10% whatever Americans wear masks still gonna wear masks. Indoor masks required sure though. Crazy there's states rule. transmissions though seem happening restaurants take mask off, home wearing one. national mask mandate would help neither situations. surges European countries masks mandates kind shows this. Idk solution is. know couple people like sadly. Imo national mask mandate unenforceable really help much unless specifically targets indoor usage. Masks important sure, 5-10% whatever Americans wear masks still gonna wear masks. Indoor masks required sure though. Crazy there's states rule. transmissions though seem happening restaurants take mask off, home wearing one. national mask mandate would help neither situations. Anyone actually read Trump repeatedly said would listen public health officials deciding whether extend alter federal guidelines. **Fauci indicated president that** weekend, backing initial plan impose quarantine New York especially hard-hit states Northeast. president told reporters Saturday considering weekslong quarantine New York parts New Jersey Connecticut. Public health officials concerned nonsymptomatic residents states may spreading virus areas travel around country. idea **drew criticism state officials, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo**, Trump instead announced ""strong"" travel advisory.  **""The original proposal consider seriously enforceable quarantine,"" Fauci told CNN. ""After discussions president, made clear, agreed**, would much better what's called strong advisory.""

So much national lockdown would saved 200,000 lives used get kids (easier afraid needles) like you, told pediatrician years ago longer used. effective. blaming exactly? Cause Fox news said hoax telling people control back April. Add people going Christmas shopping too. April year? clarify that‚Äôs 1 20 tested, North Dakotans Right, zero deaths global pandemic realistic goal. I'd love see evidence taking salary. far I've seen list places supposedly donated salary actually legally prohibited federal law accepting donations. Sigh. Well I‚Äôm sure lockdowns herd immunity become politicized. saying doesn‚Äôt necessarily contradict current spike. would really lock local levels see sereoprevalncy. neighborhoods hit really hard sprint seeing resurgences? people‚Äôs travel patterns? It‚Äôs hard argue country whole teaching herd immunity thresholds. places hit hard Spring seeing big spikes smaller spikes? step helped. one person grabbing years tp one cart more. needs coordination. Manufacturing Consent, Noam Chomsky  NFL Major Sports Leagues enough money weather storm make through, especially TV deals networks. Virus waves man made. asked earlier question classes, others: classrooms, windows closed, HVAC system ventilation. results would produce? first off, K-12 data terrible. Like things pandemic, federal plan, national strategy track this. fact, federal gov't even threatened schools states open person, providing disincentive track kind data. leaves data states, many states districts can't afford regular testing. Many collect centralize data. Even states make regular rapid testing, often obscure data claiming privacy. Northeastern state, rapid testing suspected K-12, data put weekly, info quarantines, teacher/staff versus student infections, info classes/pods/cohorts involved, positivity rate, total tests. data collected share publicly--presumably want parents pulling kids school. Bottom line, good idea going schools despite articles past two weeks Vox, Wash Post, Atlantic suggesting do.

Second, schools taking mitigations suggested. encouraging open windows, mask mandates, lowered capacities, stable pods. helps.

Third, started relatively good position low summer transmission rates. spread exponential, first spreads inconspicuously. probably especially true students appear asymptomatic cases higher rate. Eventually though, enough make obvious spikes/surges.

Fourth, although potentially going disaster right start, likely scenario Fall/Winter cold/flu season (starting right now) we'd see problems. think beginning see problems, think hard deny another month six weeks.

We've seen steady growth cases across US since schools opened, think coincidence, although claim proof, suspicion. Schools usually close pandemics act disease reactors, think we're starting see, think acknowledge need distance learning end year.

I could wrong, think amazingly reckless experiment disease understand well. taking additional precautions fall winter, providing additional vectors hoping best. 

Before anyone takes victory lap, I'd ask recall meat packing plants. Even mask mandates PPE, many uncontrolled outbreaks due recirculating air low humidity. guess windows close, many schools face similar fate need close. idk suggesting since already know lot numbers off, reinfection rates probably well. feel conflicted. one hand, would 100% support this, like lock apartment 3 weeks starting tomorrow everyone else would same. based see street every day, hard time believing would sufficient buy-in actually work. government mandate wants, people actually hold much leakage gains evaporate soon end lockdown. cat bag.

At end day, think closures inevitable given control growth virus last month. would much better suffering another shutdown dragging winter, discouraged realization still probably work.

It extremely informative see happens France Germany next month. Hopefully prove wrong. Cold water bidets better thorough. I‚Äôm really tired hearing ‚Äòbiggest one day increase record‚Äô. Which? Let's check back 6 months. Sweden looks bigger maps projection, longer. Lockdowns basically achieved nothing South America it‚Äôs worth. IFR COVID-19 low 0.2%, herd immunity achievable 50%, they‚Äôd basically there. minimum, Peru provide solid modeling data. ‚ÄúI believe man wrong person run country. end don‚Äôt win election need act like third world country violent overthrow leadership. Process damned‚Äù

Nope.

What I'm saying is: ""The present system corrupt, current President contributing country's decline rather addressing problems. He's problem far, he's biggest one moment. hope reform repair getting someone else elected. happen, force necessary election outcome prove democracy failed, option."" virus thing trump's fault

Nobody listens fauci that's get covid
Trump wants people die virus I've seen couple articles big GOP donors sniffing around buying OANN doubt would throw money Trump TV attempt.

That said, he's gonna lot legal challenges he's office knows that's going pan out. hate ones claim virologists immunologists coming cast doubt whether vaccines even work totally get reinfected it'll severe please remember antibodies fade &amp; B cells give much protection please everyone scared hopeless possible, I'm expert swear. can¬¥t compare Germany many care homes corona despite strong protection, rise started earlier. 100 9/11's. That's much indicator, though, lose 9/11's worth children swimming pools year.

However, we've already burned *four* Vietnams.

We two, maybe three months away exceeding total US casualties WW2. know bad Wuhan social media people china spread word. also locked hard. still bad we'd still getting reports full hospitals regardless government tries stop.  bet ‚Äúnever said that‚Äù ‚Äúnever believed that‚Äù ‚Äúalways knew true‚Äù soon becomes evident theory bullshit someone anosmia could smell. do, viruses invisible unnoticed symptoms show. That's start wearing masks. Now, they're wearing time, cut pre-symptom transmission drastically. correct. Got positive tests time. mouths. mouth. mouth. do. discuss policy pros cons national mask mandate. Belgian friend complaining school closed today Halloween festivities cancelled. ü§¶ know bad there. enjoy forming entire political ethos around people upset. You‚Äôre embarrassing... dont know winter time soon America? Fake news got warped. notion 50% country following mask social distancing measures ludacris bullshit. OVERWHELMING majority people following guidelines since day 1.


But admitting would also admitting total failure, know can't happen previous thread mentioned ""gave up"" $400,000 year salary, got something like $140,000,000 trips Mar-a-lago, etc. Wish source mobile. I've read, historically viruses mutate less lethal ensure effectively spread. No, I'm know anyone would believe that. lot police already said enforce it, people wear them. 

It's sad keeping others healthy simple thing even mandated. Can't really blame people 8 months it. far go back? friend test positive week *after* hung kitchen rode car together. project hit lottery soon..same thing right? That's still failure leadership bud. Thank you!

This study saying 0 1.54 percent death rate prevent majority us population getting catching virus, us winding least million dead? people know. theweek.com may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Thank helping us keep information /r/Coronavirus reliable!


*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* think really counts screw since still eliminated virus twice without masks. government followed advice changed, too, urging mask usage. saying main screw indicates paid heavy price using them, didn't. I'm annoyed bc able click read whole thing want share working even though another shutdown would greatly reduce rising COVID cases, never happen US people dumb/stubborn, im also point.

If another shutdown mandated, we'd hurt lower middle class citizens STILL dealing job/wages lost spring. Unless way every single person would paid lockdown, itll harm good. want National Mask Mandate. 

I don‚Äôt think help though. Literally impossible enforce here. 

How implement that? Feds popping heads restaurants businesses run mask checks?

I wouldn‚Äôt hate that, doubt happens.

I think need well-defined endpoint. would something could re-rally people unity. Maybe. Herd immunity would require approximately 60%-70% population infected virus. would take several years hit level. Never Maybe he's correct.

But answer question. cdc estimates ifr across us population 0.6% threshold. article gone anyone else? Thought Poland, Popeland throw shade, would like correct misleading information. strong evidence current virus come [act eating even came [wet all. 

I wish article expand diseases get bats need direct contact all, happen jump another secondary animal host, also likely origin current pandemic.

SARS CoV 1: Bats Civel Cats Humans

MERS: Bats Camel Humans

Even ban sale exotic meat, get populace eat mainstream sources like cows, chickens pigs etc. still spared risk future zonotic diseases, like 2009 pandemic flu, 1918 flu, Avian Influenza came directly farmed meat commonly eat. greatest diseases, like tuberculosis, measles etc came them.

As long maintain close relationship animals, directly indirectly, threat new diseases always there. Exactly. reason wear one! several vaccines development worldwide final stages clinical trials. It‚Äôs possible one vaccines could approved end year, Germany many countries. gave update. taking seriously? true. example, FL hit 5 year highs (by lot) respiratory deaths labeled, non-covid-19.  There's wall several hundred meters tall called Pyr√©n√©es banks afford protect themselves. Shut man. even get from? a) us probably susceptible short-term reinfection b) us getting pneumonia c) stop depressing gain nothing it

I agree though people ruining us. Magnetic poles switching isnt instantaneous (takes hundreds years think) destructive shouldnt issue least. Sweden hit herd immunity all.  Herd immunity would mean massive increase cases like they've past week virus susceptible population infect. tool coupled populace adjusting behavior capitalize learned earned. don‚Äôt use lose it.  Europe earned nice summer consumer spending up.  come September assumed worst over. are. curious, get people get get exposed test? know can‚Äôt willingly infect, telling people go eat, go maskless, etc? Symptoms worse days others, mainly rains Spain support putting effort critical thought, appreciating nuance detail, effective public health interventions humanitarian politics. immediantly play contact sports (although guess American football hockey lacrosse less thing there) mean ‚Äúenough bills‚Äù one Unfortunately, attitudes like world suffering right now. can't sacrifice normal life well-being others.  (ND) day hit 20% positive rate tests rolling average 10-15% depending look 1 2 weeks. getting really bad here. Thanks addition.

If may make suggestion could help...

If getting stressed Corona News think getting week, maybe take week Reddit news?

A lot news stories designed illicit strong emotional response even cortisol release. good mindset even body.

The news important, sure, long voted Federal Local elections, good taking week off. 

I‚Äôm certain world log back on. would like thank family choosing work medical field assist patients come place work. Lol, ever club NY? Theyre also great place underage drinking drug use. People die cancer, heart disease, stage 4 renal failure still counted Covid. Flu deaths counted mostly estimate every year, exact flu deaths estimates based bad flu season US year. 

This year 300,000 people dead normal amount time US. So, actually undercounting Covid deaths Much lower death rates due younger people contracting virus. watered things mortality rates younger people much lower. 6-year-old nephew went school Shanghai. kids didn‚Äôt get whole mask/germs concept traded masks liked someone else‚Äôs patterns more. Ohio‚Äôs excellent health director Dr. Amy Acton resigned death threats. force keeping Ohio response together.  government plenty money things, without needing go work.

No doesn‚Äôt. herd immunity catch twice. Doesn‚Äôt read medical studies coming around globe? thing vaccinations, won‚Äôt help either. FYI, Czech Republic ~~\#1~~ \#2 7-day average, per capita infection rate. sitting 118 per 100k people, beating Belgium 1 (they're 117/100k). first major peak Belgium's second.

Oh, see Andora, they're actually \#1 131/100k, really count.

Enjoy. enjoy too. enjoy getting pneumonia every year. Sweden talking anyone actually, apparently they've quietly started adopting measures neighbours since 'experiment' worked (dates October 6th) IIRC data dump day people work keep society functioning. government printing money won‚Äôt good grocery stores empty. WaPo looking help get owner Bezos another $1 would

Lmao yeah sure. 

Just like every inaccurate model promised certain number ‚Äúwould‚Äù die. That's CFR, death rate calculate using known cases. yeah think letting run country smart either US, western country, hide information virus denying wanted always play down. still like playing down, want create panic.""
    -President Donald Trump

[For reading detailed timeline US government hiding danger unfolding global He's crack pot. let enjoy five months antibodies, masks still required unless likes yelled yet fined determines affordability money available. Free labor something want get tied in, one, even considering talking insane amount upkpeep and, importantly impractically, HEPA filters FLOOR bar.  


I show mop bucket hopefully understand impractical solution could possibly come small business lol It‚Äôs financial support though, it‚Äôs resources. federal government print imaginary money wants, still can‚Äôt strict lockdown many people need work keep society functioning even minimal level. need farmers ranchers working keep good supply. need doctors nurses hospitals. need police firemen. need workers keeping electricity water safe drink. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm forgetting tons important fields, that‚Äôs immediate needs. Someone like bit grey area. work pharmaceutical manufacturing. Sure wouldn‚Äôt immediate drug shortages shut plant down, long term? want upset supply chains country way could still feeling years later lockdown may work? since late Jan PTSD SARS.

How bad SARS Taiwan back 2003? lockdowns back then? far less people around (estimates say 1,8 billion), many weakend years war.

Ninja: less people, also means less people infect. analysis know Russian-speaking criminals? Hey, Mike‚Äôs still optimistic guys! least nobody‚Äôs purple!! mask don‚Äôt. won‚Äôt anything it. heading towards 50k day week like France, absolutely nuts link broken/restricted anyone else? Perhaps share text not? Sounds like great article. Lmao okay, make point 6 months. Till you‚Äôre wrong mistake believe Sweden nothing. Trust live here. It‚Äôs Swedish authorities urged citizens follow voluntary recommendations, instead forcing threats fines, also high degree. Call soft lockdown will. That‚Äôs good know! Current death rate usa according world meter 2.6%.

But even half population us gets it, that‚Äôs still 1 million dead, no? oh fuck slippery slope fallacy? Small actions can't slowly worsen? Useless long schools still opened.
They already closed non essential businesses. And? said? count admitting defeated hoax. timeline confusing That‚Äôs great hear. Take care yours, please keep reminding people correlation isn‚Äôt causation! Vaccines teach body immunity way exposure does. Vaccines weaken immune system. would love covid vaccine, meantime, children still need exposed pathogens build immune systems. Ever heard chicken pox even doctors hospitals all?

What sick people entirely different question, way relevant comment. restrictions last forever. And, think fully get handle pandemic good job treating it, controlling it, creating vaccine, applying said vaccine population, restrictions become less restrictive eventually removed.

However, think really important point; governmental restrictions activities etc, whether people feel comfortable things entirely different story. And, suspect people really nervous it, get that.

The way get restrictions lifted faster safe way everyone follows using masks, distancing, disease prevention practices. can't half ass pandemic; care rich poor, wants *you*. ""you part"" real thing. Fighting pandemic lot like fighting war; requires public make changes habits accept restrictions need happen knowledge helps us get back things faster yet Dewine still won‚Äôt anything. hope voters remember this. Yeah, really Based comments, ""brainless"" part conversation coming you. magical number regard population testing becomes impossible. 5.5 million doable yet 330 million isn't? America's per capita GDP three times Slovakia's; Slovakia test citizens, US could easily wanted to. Lol. honestly funny block Basically. awhile read pretty thorough explanation possible process. two possible ways federally - either congress executive. avenues would face limitations lawsuits. I'll try find write later link can. differences come c using different 24 hour cut off. Worldometers uses GMT midnight, assume American sources use US time zone, etc. differences sources (go state report aggregate county reports etc).

However, think differences substantial, least sources follow. mom nursery school teacher NY (3-4yolds) says 100% compliant barely complaint. there‚Äôs cadre sniveling adults throwing tantrums can‚Äôt breathe 30 seconds (But seem perfectly fine notion cruising Covid infection little worries). It‚Äôs fascinating people simultaneously see fragile yet potentially robust. I'm seriously doubtful might come January though. predictions wrong given long vaccines might developed. sparked second waves many countries, may also make current vaccines ineffective. Great job overall, whenever get chance ruing things, it. I'd suggest look difference supranational intergovernmental authority within EU directives, funding decision making works. comparing idea actual reality expecting magical alignment countries would benefit ""funding"" actually reality refuse based would shift authority. let's put like this.
You bar restaurant. 50% capacity law requires. hand sanitizer everywhere. staff wearing masks. addition sanitize area. invest money provide safe environment, outside tables everything.
Then come say environment safe need close 6pm. Actually forcing shut customer going show up. time danger government keeps saying 20 students 5 hours day sharing room MASKS ok.

What would do?

EDIT: Oh addition reopened may 18th. ok. Schools reopened 2nd/3rd week september 2 weeks cases exploded. still blame customers. Wow. Ohio. Wow. preface question with, voted Biden/Harris.

My question is: impactful measures federal government take moment besides mandate masks worn public places? 75% US work force cannot work home. cannot lock everyone obvious reasons. balance. I'm trying antagonistic here. realize bevy fed could done onset, regarding PPE, etc. I'm sure really anything since become control wild fire. 30. Yeah, know. Like said, Ioannidis legend. One important names field. mystery many choosing hill die on. Dutch boorish morose time accept something like mandatory testing.

You see, long ago, God filled earth people one space left, along coast Europe. know put like. looked future, noticed Americans took vision, put pan let simmer many eons. Then, sort foam drifted top brew. 

And foam, made Dutch. Boorish, selfish, crude, willful mule-like. 'Why wear masks! proof helps!' 'Why get tested, wanna party!''But economy!' Yep, think eventually would learn ""banning"" people things stop all... Perfect, plus Thanksgiving Christmas gatherings next two months. CA surveillance system, non essential business gets shut cases meet certain metrics. still warm though, wait see winter brings. I‚Äôm guessing covered laws. instance restriction public gatherings law, recommendation general advice. saw article wall street journal Germany process getting vaccine approved use end year. article BS? White House said virus ""Democrat hoax"" would ""miraculously"" disappear April.

Some extremely gullible. ""good news"" flair chump. argument along cure worse disease. case nursing homes hospitals, unable see family members death, another extension that. believe measures implemented without serious thought consequences, fatality rate believed much higher time.

Do really think majority elderly people want stay isolation 1/2 year point, prevent 5.4% Fatality rate 70+ age bracket(see CDC link above). personally think do. 

Allow visitors. don‚Äôt care make wear Oompa Loompa suit, wear masks, what, stuffing old people room isolating them, patting back lowering COVID-19 death rates, worrying consequences really shortsighted. 

Thankfully lot hospitals nursing homes started allowing visitors still not. acknowledging know, mask protect others, moreso one self.  Lmao ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt read article let comment it‚Äù 2spooky4me man can't believe forgot that; thanks reminding me! :) never said that. say allowing social interactions continue, ensures virus still spread. USA #1 üòÇ main reason kids go grand parents schools closed. means mix generations. 


There almost deads age group 50 Belgium. plenty deads age group 60+. This. study stories countries compare going area. Oh fuck you, damn upvote least we‚Äôre Europe lmao Stay safe everyone Looking Denmark Germany, developments almost identical Sweden‚Äôs right now. Scary thing - likely never herd immunity COVID. may get sort news Thailand, America actually ""mask-less rallies"" folks protest park city hall wearing masks hoisting signs telling wear one. don‚Äôt think people allowed go grocery store? insane receive test within 15 minutes, spot. Politicians institute temporary measures limit gatherings, choose enforce them. 

the know ^‚åí‚òÖ border closure neither say Germany Deutschland There's 159 close contacts curreny quarantine depending situation would abetter argument CC 30 attendees got sick. We've tried nothing we're ideas. get attendee list fine them. Get warrant go them. Disturbing peace too. Idk. Throw book right film go theater schools close next monday 10 days.  
The idea kids general get sick, education important. 


It's important protect elders. kids go schools closed? grand parents. people still going store. Maybe permission slip virus see decide spread? Church &amp; Co. says, please consider ruling party someone mindset, view opinions. Oh, bad, Kaczynski's got one: divide et impera. Sorry, old believe ""party"" got political view besides ""I sponsor pays for"". Oh, figured treat it? That's fantastic news, I'll tell friends coworker who's son tried drive hospital chest pains hospitals capacity got emergency department told call ambulance, car 12 feet away dying mother it. pronounced DOA ambulance got 20 minutes later. maybe tell 8 hospitals local area ambulances turned away.

We must really got treatment get amazing results like that. Vape shops open. Lockdown? Right. leading cause death among 25-44 year olds. think China close borders foreigners January 23rd?

Guess much western countries criticize China.

Do remember western countries mocked Wuhan sealed?

Why tell us then? know. What's use?

ridiculous they‚Äôre going go business one way another, might well fine death take money.  That‚Äôs fascism. 

Does government flu diseases? Guess stating obvious now. COVID new herpes. Ethical control tell people might come contact. reality ignoring hoping magically goes away gets worse. can't burden changing lifestyle. Autumn break also means people travelling around. two autumn breaks Netherlands (two different regions, one week holiday, last week week before). seeing positive negative effects (yet). im dying US die dont Money wont geht testet black number ist much higher corruption benefits demonrats keep mind belgium much higher population density. fuck much agree. gap resume covid makes sense. wanted point future employer refrained working order protect parents, reflects positively know full churches Germany?

And like every place wants host weddings CC big pockets. pretty strong deterrence 98% wedding venues there. wearing masks... Numbnuts üòÇ maybe numbers bad predicted. PREVENTING SPREAD. I'm gonna lie, want one. Can't stop people morons, I'm ok looking like one. suspect places india reached herd immunity might explain declining rates. Anti body studies major cities confer this. feels like europe aswel. undercontroll let slip again, faulth people listening, yeah. governments stept sooner strickter, yes. around 300k already Yes.  many patience guy has, can't believe people still refusing wear masks avoid gatherings even though many passed away. sheer ignorance! irony all. That's true. Yes many business we're closed short periods time, say ""unlawful leave home"" true. never lockdown, there's ""stay home orders"" people took seriously beginning. restaurants bars closed people less incentive go out, orders never enforceable. Visit sub masks4all good resources reviews get different masks. Ah, ok.

I hope mass testing successful used curb spread. endogenous economy extra inventory slack production fiscal stimulus non inflationary. That‚Äôs technical description everyone unemployed little government spending gooses economy Schools open, universities open, people still going work. Really Macron shutting restaurants. Share risk. companies manufacturing many doses distributed fast when/if vaccine approved. spending lot money problem circumstances. School meals thing European countries. far right ??????

However religious areas churches may full. Sweden said theybl wrong. Antibodies seem start lose effectiveness around 3 months, herd immunity thing get bad reaction lethal get 3 months later, possibly death sentence. Yeeep. It‚Äôs ~just~ ~undesirables~ (old people, sick people, brown people) suffer most. need sacrifice convenience then, well, is! (And happen end lot fewer pesky undesirables, well, every cloud silver lining.) testing program still absolutely ridiculous far it. done anything help. number one thing federal government done getting testing super easy point. bet state ""corrupt free"" fuck scientists researchers actual work?

Reddit, need get idea $4 day coffee fine, $5 week real news. gotten politicized much either disingenuous reading post well. talking Wuhan even went lockdown. Please give evidence 24 Jan, places like Japan, Europe US places significant outbreak risk. *Taiwan took action limit arrivals, whereas countries that.* Hence, European outbreak could spread US well many places, Taiwan. Hospitals pay keep things quiet don‚Äôt kill people. Holiday seasons especially hard suicidal addicted folks. excess death going jump lot next couple months, addition excess deaths Rona. FHM reports per actual day tested. 2820 number positive tests taken 28/10. difference labs backlog. Meaning rest cases earlier. far right, - accurately - sitting deeply church's pocket. marshmallows taste hot cold. point heating make smores. Belgium Czech Republic worst world per capita infection rate right now. France Switzerland really bad, half Belgium.

The New Deaths charts going get really grim 10 days get worse. saying, restrictions forever. people sub seem think be. agree that? Depends who‚Äôs getting executed tbh do. Public health services act. Broad authority contain pandemic Hello ad hominem home wearing one. 

At least people recognize transmissions occurring mandate work. public official said, wear mask times home, official would lose credibility. Majority Americans (60%) want stricter gun laws ... guess that's going? 
So infuriating minority country hold rest us ransom simply want something. Yes. Clarification: brunch ffs takes average 5-8 days exposure tests come back positive get COVID. Testing early might mean return negative still threshold detected. one test part sucks, insurance company's inability explain wait.

I wish best wife family! Hoping speedy recovery one else gets it. Interesting time post this, since cases started ticking back  Ourworldindata graph link beginning thread suggest rise started earlier Sweden‚Äôs Denmark‚Äôs. 

Care elaborate? Right. Myocarditis. strange get viral infection.

But vast majority people recover myocarditis within months, looks like Eduardo Rodriguez According CDC's data, number people died year COVID-19, pneumonia, and/or influenza 340,746 time comment.


The number pneumonia influenza deaths would normally 20k 30k time year, safely estimate 300,000 already died disease matter, cuz crazy minority screams loudest gets way often. actually people everything right followed science wouldn't. problem  think willfully obtuse here. Nobody authority matter claimed pandemic would lockdowns mask guidelines followed. is, always been, method slow spread keep things manageable permanent situation develops either vaccine means.

If actually thought lockdowns masks would cure end ongoing pandemic highly suggest find new sources information, really hope soley relying reddit Covid-19 information would really dumb you. good news. Hopefully won‚Äôt get point medical system becomes overloaded again. Whatever. entire website completely fucked anyway even deserve someone like Fauci point? He's braving death threats continue help shithole country 42% population STILL voting trump despite past 4 years. think, I've read today first person died due lack equipment. 6% remaing capacity nessarily beds equally distributed. Well, would first authority mandate even get exemptions likely federal government authority. I'm bit worried reading comprehension skills... I'm gonna walk figure together. Ready?

Let's go back read loud we're page:

What's title/thesis email? Let's check. Oh nice, bold top document. say? Administration Releases Science Technology Accomplishments First Term**

Oh well that's convenient. Let's highlight important word thesis: ""**Accomplishments**."" word defined as, ""something achieved successfully.""

Let's continue point we're talking about:

So we're talking first bullet point halfway down, yes? let's read paragraph get context since that's context works. bold parts past four years, President Trump's policies investments science technology ensure America stands ready solve today's pressing challenges workforce prepared tomorrow's innovations. years come, **these achievements** guarantee United States remains world's leader research, discovery advancement industries shape future,"" said Ivanka Trump, Advisor President. **Highlights Include:**

Then literally says: ""**ENDING COVID-19 PANDEMIC.**

The word ""achievement"" defined as: ""a thing done successfully, typically effort, courage, skill.""

So let's review:

The title main thesis press release tout administration's so-called ""accomplishments"". literally word used title. word literally means something achieved successfully. 

Then, immediately point question, indicates list ""achievements"". Again, literally word used. word literally means ""things done successfully.""

Directly this, list achievements begins. first bullet-point list achievements ""ENDING COVID-19 PANDEMIC.""

Now, mind, would like please explain document **not** claiming ended pandemic. chance [a second /s trouble reading comprehension? shit! doctor seemed confident fist versions would subside symptoms fix all. expected first shot booster month two later. like chicken pox vaccine immune it. Exactly. end social distancing wearing masks society do...but it‚Äôs clearly working (was 365million people US going change habits? Really?). 

The countries got control strong government response. US/EU keep saying ‚Äúsocial distance‚Äù ‚Äúwear masks‚Äù strategy changes it‚Äôs diminishing returns. Sorry. everything right timeline gets pushed back what's point?

Yea, time selfish. reduce social gatherings, due previous experience population SARS, people stayed home without government telling us so.

God damn. Imagine stubborn, stupid America. feel like leave next election around think probably gets one vote signs put (Durham County). good question whether constitutional, well. hope know you‚Äôre killing listeners. Thank Smoking right beginning wrong middle are. They're going lock again, we're going to....? Hmm, unaware extra measures needed confirm reinfection opposed first infection. clarify, way intended suggest reinfection unlikely certain period time. could expect sizable body anecdotal evidence pointing reinfection common point. almost title pre-print research paper news article cites. would basically unenforceable even constitutional. Local law enforcement generally required enforce federal law - think local cops progressive districts enforcing immigration laws.

Thus, would looking using federal agents like FBI, DEA, ATF, etc. enforce provisions. COVID huge issue, I'd think waste federal resources better things time making Jimmy Podunk wear mask outside.

I've seen couple people say get army enforce national lockdown masks. would violate posse commitas (sic) act, states military forbidden enforcing federal policies US soil. National Guard state controlled. Even could happen, I'm pretty sure want go road regardless who's president. worked spring/summer Sweden, know mention Japan. read laced wonder inhalable drug CSD is.

Isnt suffering initial illness? bad. hack hospital work near dealing with. hasnt even year yet since thing around...and look done already  sporting events large gatherings?

We've covered sporting events. Concerts etc come back. It'll slow. Vis vis movies, think streaming services (which becoming new cable, ugh) going knock movies quite bit. However, people like going can't. might expect see bunch independent theaters close, really unfortunate. forgetting antivaxx people though. People accuse essential childhood vaccines containing dangerous mercury, causing autism. Even vast majority regular people want wait least year they're worried side effects safety new vaccine. Thats good work around. Get well versed eyes films. worked overnights anytime couldnt send hell. understand docs frustrations took lot heat something hands. Dont miss lol. Ahhhh...the 20s really back! say get 500,000 deaths late january Anecdotal evidence tell us anything percentage people become ill second time. good reason believe prior exposure coronaviruses lessens severity one. would make sense exposure one increase severity one general case. always outliers. can't draw kind conclusion. That's terrible. I'm sorry go feel like sub good narratives started clashing. Lockdown skeptics versus ‚Äúpeople hiding basement‚Äù. Terrifying. Small children dragged morality play us adults having.

We're going rase generation bubble-wrap germaphobes shoddy immune systems. Pathogens enemies, necessary part human existence.  ""for greater good"" bwahahahahahahahhahah. thats country works xD end. while. sorry sure lot unhappy landlords, enough make zeitgeist way masks are.

Is function something constitutional matter law popularity? pfft...this fauxi fauci guy idea he's talking about!! ILL PRAY GET RID THIS!!

xD Well... little complicated. Yes, call country ""ƒåesko"", Czechia. also, ""ƒåesko"" one three main cultural regions Czechia, ""ƒåesko"" region translates Bohemia English (the two Moravia Silesia).

Yes, needed short name, yes, Czechia probably best one, issues declaring short name popular. again, guess matter much. ‚Ä¶which means may peak later, seeing USA.  happened Georgia October 5? new COVID-19 cases day 21,349 whereas days around 1,000-2,000 essentially many places done? think worth small risk eating take personally.

Joke. agree. kids issues.  Restaurants closed real lockdown, meaning Uber drivers people working restaurants would stay home. Grocery stores would place go get food. china lying beginning. pride talking, want ""big bad savior"" world Yeah fine us. ""national mandate"" expected results. folks wearing masks dig heels more, folks chafe force Government forcing wear masks. end result less mask wearing.

 wear mask out. like told to. wear one courtesy cognizant others. believe masks work rated N95or up. think reason sunbelt US hit brutally summer due centralized air everywhere. live here, know sealed buildings outside air recirculated cool air pumps throughout day night.

Thanks saying now! numbers like these, knows many we'll get fiture...  Ngl, Fauci, would work somewhere else give message Wait--was Kate Winslet? seen since first came out. Dr. Fauci makes wish version Knighthood US. get giant lego statue. also factor people leaving nose exposed wearing mask multiple days row ineffective. China handled COVID well too. east asia did. 

The difference Americans choose believe truth , China bashing soft propaganda instead.

I'm Brunei , China actually sent military plane stocked supplies tech March gave us everything need zero cases past 180 days. Alot info techniques used including building virology lab came China. Ditto Vietnam.

It's pity say alot Americans believe print media especially countries lies delusions , reflected COVID rates vs ours. dumb facebook mommies. leader material. trailer material. movie Contagion too. unnecessary decision ended making ill. I-O... guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è US number bit high.

Not really sure made sense key difference ventilation recirculation air. 

Ventilation means air moves area, around inside it. Cali NY believe stated matter efficacy said, release public. tests, deaths. Even numbers drop fools. Since flu data tracked, can't even calculate comorbidity.

People need accept quitters say what? understand right this, frustrates many people using ""mental health"" excuse risky things pandemic. think lot people simply use mental health struggles, hence toughness needed stick long lockdown. I've dealt anxiety issues whole life, 8 months lockdown beginning feel depression come on, I'm even remotely considering idea starting back social life. Winter going pretty hellish me, I'll stay distanced, stay safe. matter shit mentality is, staying alive keeping around alive comes first. conversation ending lockdowns due mental health concerns, addressing mental health concerns lockdown. Ex: encouraging people socially distant outdoor activities together masks on. That's safe middle ground ""end lockdown better mental health"" ""lock completely"". LOL, people glass houses.

I wonder viral dose used second time ‚Äî unrealistically monster dose something reasonable one may encounter daily life? it‚Äôs former, wouldn‚Äôt surprising IMO. hope. what, 4 years ago majority Americans wanted Hillary Clinton President - feeling time request masks handled similarly. known measurement virus small enough encapsulated larger aerosol sized particles hang air hours, yes.

The idea 2 sizes moisture particles, aerosol droplet based 1940s science. 

We since discovered wide gradient sizes moisture particles expelled in, meaning smaller particles aka aerosols also range sizes, carry SARS-Cov2. Absolutely, still mandate single reason Taiwan many east asian countries handled COVID well simply compliance governmental public level medical advisories experts - they've gotten (which America loved demonize) believe not. Rich people using rapid testing gatherings since became available. best 60 percent accurate. sound like brightest bulb there? I‚Äôm thinking decisions aren‚Äôt smart.

Halloween first super spreader event 3rd surge. thanksgiving ensure everyone knows least someone inner circle gets infected. that's weird flex tend agree. It‚Äôs going take hit delivered covid people understand. Plenty examples world history action happened everyone understands bad situation is. different. 99.7% survival rate. We're done, come on. American elections taught anything majority Americans want matter Got flu shot 2 weeks ago $31.50 Randall's! *Because fuuuck 2020!!* think part also see dumb everyone feel like wear mask mouth nose time geniuses comparatively even scarier, never accept it, always divided hoax,  even Bi*den gets , kind late now, everyone going get vaccinated immediately (or all). Also, vaccine unlikely 100% effective (could low 60%), we'll still need work knocking case numbers way down. 

Having said that, doctors recommend people (and politicians) end necessarily thing. really 32 cases yet?

Apparently enough prove efficacy?

It's enough prove level efficacy. trials multiple case thresholds readouts. earliest readouts able prove high levels efficacy (though may suggest data supports it).

The underlying idea distribution cases vaccine group control group depends two factors: efficacy vaccine chance. latter impossible control, important. 8 infections control group 4 vaccine group (assuming equally sized groups), mean vaccine 50% efficacy? That's obvious interpretation, data really prove level confidence. might well vaccine less efficacious, chance people control group got infected. way around.

The goal vaccine trials able detect vaccine least 50% efficacy, reasonably high level certainty chance ruled out. example would meet threshold.

There statistical methods depth knowledge allow researchers compute many cases need get levels certainty efficacy levels. apparently 32 ended number first readout, intended sufficient statistical significance able meet requirements regulators (if vaccine indeed efficacious). readouts line greatly improve efficacy estimates.

Note better vaccine works, longer take reach readout threshold. That's case count combined control vaccine groups. vaccine 100% efficacy, cases must come control group, would take twice much time would vaccine 0% efficacy. 401k flat since beginning year. most, 401k‚Äôs going up- stabilizing January 2020 levels.  lockdowns half assed start. hard lockdown three weeks March followed travel ban would've saved hundreds thousands lives. similar lockdown today would still save tens thousands, hundreds thousands, dying winter next Spring. we're seeing many cases EU?

Good luck hope everyone stays safe can‚Äôt serious. don‚Äôt think telling people stay homes shutting vast majority businesses, even it‚Äôs justified, isn‚Äôt drastic government action? Lingers seems wrong word use here; negative connotation. Honestly, even good news, media seems make sound bad. know worst thing? conscious real numbers must staggeringly high, health care fking flooded right now, I've heard deny tests unless symptoms.

Otherwise tests expensive af big part people think tests ineffective anyway.  Arizona, Florida, India, Brazil, South Africa, etc show clear signs population immunity significantly slowing spread down. Mask mandate federal shutdown. inevitable colder weather coming in. People move dining drinking indoor facilities. Targeted Trump's buddies. today‚Äôs number easily going 80k

It's possible hit 90k today. also goes way around. People border go Juarez cheaper better healthcare. Also visit families work. need testing tracking. Germany plenty local health departments managed track outbreaks recently. they've lost grip, time harsh measures. point waiting. neighbors lost track months ago look them. 

Germany could theoretically test 1.3 mio per week, never tested ~1 mio. far capacities modern decentralized laboratories country spring. European nations testing per capita. matter lost track testing alone help them. Agree. numbers day yet. states still reported. city‚Äôs positive test rate hit 1.92 percent based seven-day average, highest number weeks first time metric seen ""meaningful jump"" since city began tracking September, de Blasio said. one-day rate even higher, 2.7 city reported 532 new coronavirus cases ‚Äî number hovering around city‚Äôs 550 threshold keeping pandemic control, breached earlier week. previous spikes driven outbreaks confined certain neighborhoods Brooklyn Queens, officials say new cases increasing across city‚Äôs five see slow steady rise throughout many, many parts city,‚Äù said public health adviser Jay city plans shut school system, reopened fits starts, positive test rate seven day average hits 3 percent. mayor called shutting indoor dining hits 2 percent, though final decision would rest Gov.

Yeah, I'm guessing lot people want masks mandated interacting random people, fine maskless gatherings friends, though latter usually dangerous. hell going on....we 7 months prepare this.

May. ultimately right thing do. 2018-2019 flu season? high might reasonable assume 2019-2020 season would lower anyway; infections past season led immunity season. Let's see 2020-2021 season plays out. long make grave mistake test people flu testing sars-cov-2. way lockdown would work everyone stayed home -- one, even ""essential"" workers allowed leave homes, enough keep spread going. means EMS, health care, maintenance utilities, farms go untended, livestock go unfed, nursing home patients abandoned, hospitals cleared out. So...no hope taking infected Melanie back? ü§î Good thing locked bars restaurants 8 months. really worked out. lowered expectations.gif

seriously, people get away vaccine nonsense, till enough people vaccinated immunity 2023.

Yes, know lot people voted early, polling places taking measures... can't require masks, so... yeah. one town open weekends. havent years probably though. wanted go times summer never got around cause want lonely watching movie. Thinking realize rarely went cause friends town wanted go ""obvious,"" no. France democracy responds political pressure. I'll bet anything (very) partial lockdown make Thanksgiving. pretty clearly talking virus here...a fire reasonable metaphor. idea (lower inoculum less severity) come times TWiV, dismissed panel time. Still moronic individual states it. unenforceable request restriction restrict anything. probably prevent infection atleast somewhat. Condoms 2% failure rate perfect use, btw. Actual real-world use like 13-15% failure rate. Reminds people use masks, spent close someone ventilation seem important masks here.

Yes, though given early reporting surprise anyone (though nice hard data finally). refuse put situation. needed be, reason, would wear respirator (and eat drink).

The guidelines around masks, recall were:

* stay away people

* wash hands

* always use mask around people

* touch mask necessary

* ventilation seems protective effect, avoid indoors  2% anywhere near Infection Fatality Rate. factor least 3. may Case Fatality Rate places (France 2.8%). one world talking shutting literally everything. Even China didn‚Äôt go far. Remdesivir like $2700 course big pharma health insurance colluded push drug

Think much profits made much kickbacks doctors got. assholes really profitting pandemic Nah, pull higher pinch metal across bridge nose - laziness desire comfort imo. Interesting. Seems antibodies good predictor 'reinfection'. 

Chances seem slim since none people wotg antibodies seem reinfected.. well flu around since 1000bc so, pick time fomites. need get load high enough develop symptoms contact doctor it. patient also sars-cov-2 due millions people asymptomatically. Let‚Äôs say delete delivery apps rely grocery stores, never tipping anyone anything. pass test then?

yes companies pushing lowest level workers ""gig economy"" part problem. government Unfortunately simple. order stop spread [herd must achieved. Vaccine effectiveness 100%. fact rushed early vaccines effectivness may 50% even less vaccinated. Combine people get vaccinated everyone dropping precautions R0 would remain 1 would continue spread.

Large outbreaks still happening areas mask mandates. Typically mask enforcement doesn‚Äôt cover combination private gatherings, office buildings, bars, restaurants, on. things high risk. can't. ignorant want believe, find way. think control, wait see visualizations United bottom graphic particular telling. Note country seen three successive exponential escalations daily case growth, trough subsequent waves higher trough preceded it. evidence states either a. far late enact measures necessary limit case growth b. aren‚Äôt anything limit spread, local populations opting stay home area completely overrun fear (which absolutely horrible way handle things given incubation period virus rate asymptomatic presentation).

The UAE arguably worst listed, yet even seeing this. complete lack mitigation going lead massive healthcare workforce attrition United States via factors including death, disability, mental illness, burnout, retirement, quits.

I'm pretty sure people wear masks Catholic hospitals here, so...it sounds like Resurrection School Lansing needs branch anti-mask denomination Catholic theology. flu season, we've many 60 Million cases October February. works 400,000 cases day, average, however flu cases follow average distribution, closer normal distribution, peak times probably 2-3 Million cases day, less begging end. 

COVID spread easier flu (1) period averaging 500,000 cases day question.  could see peaks high 5 6 Million day, since spread easier.  

Of course everyone wearing masks socially distancing following good hand hygiene numbers reduced.

The thing annoying ""groomers"", put it, many people complain them.

This article currently 94% upvoted. earlier react, faster recover. Waiting we‚Äôre forced shut gonna us locked another 3 months. virus may burned large, densely packed populations continue spread rural areas, lower rate, many months. Like happened US virus migration ruh roh, back pillow fort. beginning virus, I've always said life get back normal vaccine available, half dozen vaccines developed soon available. nice Dr. Fauci saying herd immunity way go think anyone seriously suggesting anyway. 

There things everyone individual protect others virus. However, going folks one reason another screwed along way contracted virus spread others. ones perfect. folks give shit, almost nothing them. really help another nationwide lockdown. 

I glad see death ratio actually decreased due doctors using good therapeutics. gives hope, lockdowns tend cause problems (including death) solves. 

Final thoughts - history pandemics prevalent childhood diseases, death far common occurrence generations ago. like now, mercy disease effective cure prevention devised.

Even accounting backlog, L.A. County gone 940 new cases per day beginning October to, last week, nearly 1,200 new cases per day, said Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County director public health.    
     
   
I saw stories online it. Cases though. it'll line "" antibodies never found"" Serous question, masks work, cases EU spiking countries mask mandates? Fines wearing one outdoors.....  Agreed. Florida's self-reported positivity rate BS. think John's Hopkins said @ 12% 1st wave, 3rd peak. terrible this. Nice fake news embedded there:

&amp;#x200B;

"" Screenshot Jessica Hill‚Äôs arrest record Chicago Police Department website. ""

Nope. total different Jessica Hill, aged 26 now. records public via internet picture article montage.  Aside limited beds, equipment, burnout workers, we're also likely run needed drugs.

Also probably PPE again, little done. someone spent entire professional life studying infectious diseases 

How (as person who's spent barely life studying infectious diseases) think masks good idea cruises bad idea long Fauci figured out? FUCK HAPPEN?  

Why fucking stand smirking president US said stupid shit global pandemic?  

I'm quite tired whole epidemic ""celebrity experts"" good luck carrying Dr Phil Dr Oz Dr Fauci Dr Whatever. jumping. wait see. thing little meaner give credit for.

The point I'm making centered virus greater impact undone. world absolute turmoil way go back happy work day existence. surprises come. Leading Christmas right see major events happen change lives forever. Mid 2022 somewhat reprieve summer lasting effects continue years come. never easy breaking points life. progression continuum. almost mathematically predictable play out. Cause effect.

Who savior save world? Big pharma? Politicians? Please. smarter right? blows mind people like think don‚Äôt understand negative impact shut hate economy. Even precious economy concern still favor planned nationwide shut down. summer possible live pretty normal life. Schools open anyway, different. could dine outdoors. could see friends outside. could work outside. becomes much difficult gets cold people either 1) inside despite risk 2) feel mental health effects. weather cold couple weeks second wave already causing cases first wave did... going really bad winter turn things around quick numbers get hand. source this? Dude! little faith!!! gone last Easter! watch! wonder, look chart daily cases, [it's 200k best case scenario...nice clickbait title.  

Dr. Birx predicts 200,000 U.S. coronavirus deaths 'if things almost can't believe explain tenth grade statistics world's top epidemiologist, goes.

There three options, behind one normalcy.

We picked suppression option God, host, knowing door normalcy behind, opened door throw caution wind, done us rejecting option completely.

Now there's opportunity switch. we? Yes. basic math. There's 1/3 chance unacceptable deaths switch, 2/3 not.

What means rest us go nature assisted vaccine driven herd immunity, Sweden get strict hell, whole globe switches.

Basically, solution application Monty Hall Problem literally need bone. know, sorry written ""outside household"", emphasis ""avoid possible"". even point? really \`saying Sweden's approach like Germany's approach? Germany closing everything deemed non-essential? Look wow

Baconface spams 3 article

All propaganda bullshit called interview food assistance, worker spoke mentioned certain virus going magically disappear election.

I correct him. There's point trying feed reason something stupid. Google 10% big guy. understand likely exception, early snow got MN exciting refreshing - least visible change surroundings. sit inside tiny apartment, least outside world mix things up. Yes, CDC recommends portable HEPA rooms inadequate airflow. Cabbage chance end year. Businesses struggling, people wit's end, central govt helpful wet blanket. most, might regional lockdowns (perhaps state gets realllly bad) next year. Like said, turn media read raw stats suddenly panic inducing event media makes be. Absolutely, guys amazing job. wish rest world would guys did. found surprising there's country able go even longer guys without community cases. Oh yea, would total shit-show. There's single treatment market proven effective; likely work incredibly complicated make (like antibody cocktail Trump received), can't made scale 7 billion people. Also, treatments potentially deadly disease outbreak detected sumptoms seem better option vaccine protects infection outbreak body first place.

I'm portfolio approach involves treatments, public health measures etc - whole gamut - I'm willing bet home run virus coming vaccine. rest measures get us alive dead, none actually kills transmission good. get ‚Äúmasks don‚Äôt work‚Äù post every day social media. get depressed thinking half country lost. could send n95 pay wear week still wouldn‚Äôt lmfao. K. close Bullshit propaganda. spammed nonsense 3 times Herd immunity would take many, many years, there's good chance even possible. Yep. coordinated worldwide conspiracy hurt Trump. 2020 really really shitty spy thriller Every year flu pandemic. one healthy wears masks. no, it‚Äôs normal pandemic. conservatives riot? old, general? Let‚Äôs see much longer lasts. really comparing tbh. I'm pointing second wave probably looks like. Sweden might heading there. think early call yet.

Maybe two weeks I'm sorry deal BS. usually wear mask outside live usually encounter people walking around, give space. Last thing want help spread damn thing around even more. 2020 horrible year, especially united states america ravages covid-19 it‚Äôs people economy. It‚Äôs last ditch effort. election‚Äôs around corner, failure full display. thing claim failure actually success. Oh, that‚Äôs good plan? Well radiologist Fox News told Trump shutup? Right? Yet seem feckless domestic matters. strange ... housing one getting worse Evey year yay Yeah see many people wanting go back normal already despite months away vaccine ACTUALLY start go back normal. There's happy medium somewhere imo. read intended application run app allow people self-diagnose, pre-screen, better replacement temperature checks. I'm sure MIT operational capability deploy widespread eavesdropping network, fair really looked SIGINT capabilities. infected eating contaminated food. Full stop. dense. three, Ukraine likely going toughest time dealing this...

They almost tied neighboring Moldova poorest nation Europe still dealing frozen conflict eastern provinces well. Hospitals levels gear, equipment, resources Czech Republic Netherlands deal this. 

This might difficult winter quite time. Guys, anyone else feeling slowly sinking even realize it. Like frogs big pot slowly going towards boiling (whoever saw show Years Years know mean). Corona, aftermath (economic, mental health, isolation etc.), climate change reaching tipping point, technology advancing fast lives change fast us adjust all. 
I'm writing negative state, I'm calm, safe, grateful have. find optimistic future seems bit unrealistic. Again, I'm getting depressed anything thank God, seems start spinning faster faster unprecedented matter. 
I'm sure humanity worse though every time must felt like end world, keep thinking could prepare case things get hand even more. 
Do guys back plans, plans B, C, D? Literally subheading article states current surge cases could reverse gains made. No. People get older every single day whether COVID not. People likely hospitalized COVID also likely elderly, poor health, therefore already cognitive decline. 

I'm saying impossible COVID contributed decline, unlikely sole cause. 

u/1130wien good take below. wording is:
""Om m√∂jligt undvika att ha fysisk kontakt med andra personer √§n de som man bor tillsammans med""

Translation: ""If possible, avoid physical contact people outside household""

Not ""outside"" opposite ""inside"", outside household, people live with.

And no, fines. fines crossing street red either, mean it. Dude. I'm disputing whether trial happening not. I'm saying message world heard vaccine given approval hail Putin. know bull. Thanks contribution, though. Yuge numbers, biggest numbers! I'm Clinical Pharmacist works hospital covid patients people argue covid big deal hcq cure. incredible. they'll tell hospitals getting rich I'll respond hospital laid bunch people reduced executive's salaries. Still touch em. genocide thing fully bullshit. China Xinjiang?
There tons Xinjiang businesses China, even youtubers, personally Xinjiang friends, ate noodle shops, lamb skewers shops. There's also top tier Xinjiang celebrities China well political leaders. believe me? go look yourself. 
I also go history three regions mentioned, what's point. doubt open minded enough accept truth. 

And yes studied Chinese history western point view well attended school US. 12 years ago, probably shoes are, totally buying US anti-China agenda. 
But explored more, luckily speak know language/culture, I've gained deeper understanding really happened. 
my point remains: stepped China talked local people, truly studied Chinese history &amp; culture, truly understand Chinese government/dynasties last 4000 years? ""locked early

Aahahhaah needed July, look cases People stupid selfish. ""You can't tell do!"". Grow F up. mucus membranes.

And mouth??? Pfizer already getting paid vaccine developers. doses already paid for. industry bragging rights hitting first, thats all. Nobody would risk reputation that. Fauci literally quantifiably underestimated stupid obviously he's fit job **/S** American majority TIRED hearing everyday apparently somehow WORSE yesterday.

it worse. one person ever catch fake virus.  Take read ease mind. claims Trump making really meant depress vote making seem like vote gonna get tossed out. author election lawyer writes alot reason discouraged masks back preserve stock masks medical people. admit wrong move, early people made mistakes. never suggested said that. Let‚Äôs see looks coming days. Hmm okay, sources reading this? trust you, day age.. know. besides, would nice understood tests actually work. Whoa deja-vu Soooo, doesn‚Äôt really know he‚Äôs taking about.....

(Relax) debt based monetary system. dollars really printed existence. lent existence. Every new loan currency created. loans paid down/off defaulted on, currency destroyed. primary way money supply expands contracts. new lending greater amount loans paid defaulted on, money supply expands generally inflationary effect. money destroyed created new lending, deflationary effects. boom bust credit cycle periods growth lending standards loosen new lending outpaces debt destruction see expansion money supply ""good times"". point though, companies/people become overleveraged, either normal course becoming overextended external shocks, momentum shifts people unable service existing debts longer seek new loans. causes lending standards tighten credit contracts. New lending grows slower destruction debt paying defaults. contraction credit destruction debt destroys money creates deflation. situation right lending standards stiffening people borrowing less due job, etc. generalization, boom bust cycle debt based monetary system like have. 

The Fed always trying fight deflation much inflation, Fed really power perception. actually can't directly create inflation despite printer go brrrr meme. monetize Congressional budget deficits. want people think people behave *as if* Fed engaged inflationary activities short term actually inflationary. self-fulfilling prophecy type deal. However, jig smart money realizes QE inflationary without lending growth. massive deflationary forces right high unemployment, labor market contraction, consumer outlook drastically changing spending/saving habits, supply chain disruptions, shut downs, etc. Fed powerless actually combat deflation, Powell begging Congress spend big everytime speaks. banks lending, Congress create inflationary pressures counter deflationary pressures. absence stimulus deal Congress, left deflationary forces begin prevailing Congress acts. means line goes there's sign deal horizon.

Ultimately though, Congress can't ""stimulate"" us long term. wave stimulus diminishing returns less less reflationary effect shorter period time. debt GDP 130% shows sign stopping. profound impacts policy, yields can't rise else unable service debt many companies dangerously overleveraged fail. could even see negative nominal rates like countries trying out. cusp new paradigm, current system cannot continue weight.  seems trying ride fine line keeping people engaged completely hopeless

Yes, that's major part job top-level public health official. 69 nice fuck say that? shut everything vaccine? Question: theoretically, say room already filled aerosols person who's passing room three seconds. serious risk infection scenario infection require prolonged exposure? Lol Taking second also puts people higher risk. That's part point article. basically shows unventilated spaces people masks riskiest. PANTY SURGE!!!!!! Sometime last year remember news story several hospitals running exercises related scenario. cant find story. False. Dumbass. small minority ongoing spread. denialists always problem actually reading sources necessarily. Vaccines provide stronger longer-lasting immune responses infections.

My guess yearly vaccine like flu vaccine, though. that's takes get back normal, it. reading=fundamental

which people ***voluntarily*** submitted web browsers devices cellphones laptops. Incredibly brave stance take. superhero?! kind article needed implemented right start. Specifically WHO. suggestions. Ok ass. Thats say, ass. assume thats 70% figure came well? predict February 2021Covid rates time high (regardless president) Biden president, Trump brag COVID rates lower president.

Because, know, Trumps gonna Trump. exact thing Obama regarding deficit. ‚ò∫ Check South Korea I'm stating facts repeat made statements. üòâ cough, still ***not think*** COVID.

if sneeze, first thought ""I seems asymptomatic may entirely free changes wrought virus. MIT researchers found people asymptomatic may differ healthy individuals way cough. **These differences decipherable human ear. turns picked artificial researchers trained model tens thousands samples coughs, well spoken words. fed model new cough recordings, **it accurately identified 98.5 percent coughs people confirmed Covid-19, including 100 percent coughs asymptomatics ‚Äî reported symptoms tested positive virus.** accept reasoning want so: Fauci lied once, therefore Fauci can't trusted. 

And yes, largely people believe every word Danger Yam's Twitter stream. telling ONE lie = untrustworthy, telling THOUSANDS lies = presidential. cognitive dissonance strong folks. Remember beginning summer fat idiot administration claiming models predicting hundreds thousands deaths wrong alarmist?

Like 4 months pandemic mouthbreathing fuckwits like ‚Äúmore people die flu year!!!‚Äù depends significant is.

Obviously. Thats used word EASIER.

Instead categorically claiming absolutely stop second wave. April 2023. Poland people die ambulances place (at least three cases read recent days), necessarily covid. OP that's infection fatality rate currently estimated (because test enough solid denominator). could actually go higher hospital system overstrained people unable access healthcare providers. supposed weigh pros cons various policy options without use statistics? imagine happened Obamas watch. Theyd rioting saying ploy take freedom. call Melania ""first lady"" technically ""third lady"", see reasoning. viruses eventually run hosts infect. problem virus perfect storm highly infectious deadly enough result high death toll. That's happened 1918 believe since vaccine mitigate death counts, 675 k people (or equivalent 2 million people today) US passed away. We're trying prevent outcome social distancing masking around non-household members effective vaccine arrives widely taken.

By semblance normalcy means resumption maskless large gatherings indoors outdoors. Also note difference ""at end of"" ""by end of"" 2021. Given he's said many times previously, I'm inclined believe meant latter. Spanish Flu lasted 2 years 4 waves. knows mobility Covid-19 lasting immunity. might fizzle away one day containment immunisation. We'll still 2.5 months anything. care afford pay someone care them. straightforward - tried bring grandmother home genuinely impossible Biden way, he's gonna able fix damn thing imo. GOP fucked country bad gonna take next four years bring back almost normal. first time though? guess lives factory workers valuable. Fuck governments keeping EVERYONE home. UK series islands kind groups usually carry out? window, wall Funny, we've ability least 20 years simply prevent pandemics... People going get scrooged bad. nearly enough.  Attempted murder would appropriate. Fucking facts ^ played 2 concerts. 4th case NZ front row first Tool concert, kinda spread it. fault though. followed doctors instructions. Gave great show. 2nd show, front row, covid me!  Ironically, seems leftist now, hugely bipartisan bit legislation - written supported sides - W Bush signed law 01. 

Things changed bit. No. buddy's dad passed away last week heartbreaking even allow go visit. üò≠ clip show worst parts. raise good point. I'm frustrated disheartened country too.

No, lockdown virtual fake. Argentinian society highly undisciplined they'd complete opposite government says (and blame it).

Most people streets wear masks though. Here‚Äôs link also incredibly proud Melbourne Victorians. They‚Äôre achieving very, places Earth ‚Äî near total elimination COVID months hard effort collective sacrifice. scary.... hungary rumbling 15% positivity rate... mean.. kinda fucked. guess people loud 90% time Lol.

Thank you, I'm sorry loss loved one too. really, *really* says lot. Poland hitting 20% positivity like nothing... wish 7%... wait? Making shit less 30k people whole county, big rural. really specialist doctors; able see enough patients make living. 

It's pretty much impossible even one functioning ICU bed intensivist, cardiologist, surgeon. hospital work little freestanding ER, stabilize immediate life threats, really sick quickly transferred somewhere resources.

Private school students get individual learning plans assigned teachers. diagnosed learning challenge, teacher gets write student's prognosis. diagnosis often done outside school, school psychologists frequent private education public (depending state).

They also means hire SAT tutors tutors individual subjects, varies whether school option. private schools not, student needs find tutor outside school.

Yes, private education often better education public one. However, students get teacher unique learning plan followed said teacher. enough know something, important use knowledge. COVID 19 use knowledge 100 years ago. Third, technically... &amp;#x200B;

I know failing kids failing can't learn material. sizable portion world checked mentally. scary times, can't even imagine responsible basically learning 13-18 years old. Schools *really* top priority, something chopping block closing Home Depot. I'm working education now. kids learn fine remotely. I'd even say kids learn fine remotely little personal responsibility (i.e., mute lesson play games phone class). can't learn fine remotely. really need hands-on attention. need human connection looking around room seeing kids. Remote perfect, everyone. best option right frustrating many schools pushing hard person despite fact risks lives students, teachers, school staff, everyone's families. wasn‚Äôt making look worse, making bad actually is. test everyone get x amount cases, x cases community matter confirmed not.

Germany good testing good press detect lies. proof please link Sounds like hell. hope people don‚Äôt believe garbage. People New Zealand living normal life without risk catching COVID. People states living normal life catching COVID giving others it‚Äôs literally killing them. Fox News huge part blame this. Especially ones '$' front them. that‚Äôs big mistake. It‚Äôs much less costly economically modest measures longer almost shut while. It‚Äôs huge mistake imo. stronger measures much harder get compliance multiple times. Happy cake day! wear surgical kind 3 layers cotton one 3 layers, seems seal first one face better. 

Because smoker told stupid caring health already killing myself. smoker also know higher risk less chance getting ventilator shortages. also work out, dont eat junk food, pretty healthy overall. Well, good thing we're opening back crushed second wave, government payments ending pretty soon then. seen need political approval drastic measures taken.

For example, german government wanted 2 weeks ago, political system federalized different regions cannot forced it.

That delayed decision two weeks. suggesting China cant control borders? $17,000 per person 50-person limit. Well want draw strong distinction two things, comparisons way :) Space Force Admiral Covid? Space Force -JFC We're living Onion. think aren‚Äôt honest people. think plan. Open shutdown open rinse repeat till theres vaccine first week october! Hi, I'm Utah department health. Gammy dead.  No, one person allowed wear mask (for stupid reason) would efficiently applied infected person.

&amp;#x200B;

Consider point mask put barrier person infectious respiratory droplets aerosols. put mask infected person 1 barrier infection every possible victim. victim wear's mask one person barrier. everyone wears mask, everyone two barriers. interesting explanation -- may seem like stupid question, particular/identified reason target different component flu's neuraminidase? even less conserved? adults took part breaking law hold 'em responsible.

too bad can't required name offspring people die this. maine wedding death killed least 7, none attended. caught 2nd 3rd hand physical rehab/nursing facility nurse came work knowing sick, even logged symptoms tell boss. gonna lie, I'm jealous  won't. Mitch McConnell seen that. Given low amount events probably screw big time  Shut schools now! hospitals vulnerable ransomware attacks first instinct ask case necessarily hacked Short answer ultra highly available systems makes massively complex expensive build, train for, use properly, maintain. credit, then.

Compare Canada US Europe. We're much better here, even recent increase - USA 10x population, nearly 25x deaths. Personally, think stopped caring. feel amount guilt actions, know I'm inherently selfish extent. still feel bad every time go anywhere, even I'm following rules/guidelines.

But really, selfless person expected be? basically holed March July, exchange that...we're seemingly worse (and others) made sacrifice. look though things improve considerable amount time. Oh wow interesting. Lets wear masks then. would better! good thought, really appreciate suggestion. bleached well (twice), installed 6-stage reverse osmosis under-sink filter top two-stage whole house filtration already place, still failed (equally expensive) water test. RO filter took care heavy metals pesticides bacteria untouched. probably bleach couple times try test again, I'm super hopeful. shitty, shitty water (probably literally, based many cows hear right now). ....become? US print money limitlessly dollar reserve currency. I'm afraid Australian dollar luxury. High inflation likely Australia long term recession too. high school classes center 0 windows shit ventilation along heating cooling. True need give right-wing framing. sometimes think spend much time worrying see things like ""30% abortion, Great! Lets make illegal then!"" People keep saying since spring refuted many times, e.g. excess deaths. note: large number people contract virus show symptoms (just like probably get one old-fashioned coronaviruses, rhinovirus, flu least year symptomatic know spreading it).

&amp;#x200B;

So, one person getting sick different one person contracting virus. Buddy mine work always says this. **What mean?** leading candidates** final-stage testing based new, largely unproven technology platforms designed produce vaccines include messenger RNA (mRNA) technology used Moderna Pfizer partner BioNTech, inactivated cold virus platforms used Oxford University/AstraZeneca, Johnson &amp; Johnson CanSino Biologics, whose vaccine approved military use **The next set candidates** - late-stage trial results expected first half 2021 - heavily skewed toward approaches produced successful methods include using killed inactivated version pathogen causes disease provoke immune response, used make flu, polio rabies common protein-based vaccines use purified pieces virus spur immune response. Vaccines whooping cough, pertussis, shingles employ approach. I'm seriously starting believe what's coming, trying hold Tuesday point. Credible sources? Wow. whole $17,000? Sure they're unpredictable still characterize realistic bounds stochastic processes. guy science evidence shit. see everyone going take fanta menace approach nothing. 

Gg ohio. Germany underreporting cases deaths.

Look methodology . good reasons keep schools open.

One hard children teens home withotu anything do, requiring many parents also stay home.

That endangers social fabric significant extent absolute last resort. Wait Fox news finds New Zealand beat Covid without mask mandate currently restrictions whatsoever inside country. They'll want friends again. Tell this. Please. don‚Äôt think afford diplomatic anymore. Vote. Funding based standardized teaching (as dumb way evaluate teacher performance) could leftist policy proposals goals. policy pushed , literally 1% ([and still put wind sails nascent private charter school movement plunder one last social guarantees society. 

As everyone predicted , complete disaster assure liberals leftists appalled policy resulting knock-on effects. horrible, based viral load makes cases worse, also scientifically makes sense.

A mask eliminate risk, mitigate (lower) risk. cover may actually able filter virus out, may keep 90% droplets reaching make test positive barely notice verses hospitalized.

Imagine way: professional boxer going punch face, want three times thirty times? option would create damage/pain? Now, going catch coronavirus, want thirty exposures maskless three exposures wearing mask?

**TL,DR: wear damn mask.** school. repeated 9th grade three times dad gave request signed school age 17. dicked slept time anyway. Almost never showed homeroom.

Right. saying happened Comey-Barrett deciding vote, would see massive massive open hostility likelihood us going lockdown (the United States)?

Nice logistics. It‚Äôs bc tried use information. ppl hate information Taiwan's first death actually driver group Chinese tourist. ended yesterday: 

They stopped adding entries 10/28, won!!!

For need it: /s take antiviral virus.

You get vaccine you‚Äôre healthy ***prevent virus***.

So, could argue safer get vaccinated low risk getting sick. 

Whereas, already sick, might risk side-effect bad virus you‚Äôve got.

That said, Covid far many unknowns weigh whether safer skip getting vaccine even known risk factors. far knowing are.

If vaccine low-risk, taking helps us collectively get herd immunity, hope everyone step up. political goal increasing health care access actually benefit future pandemic response? I'm also sure encouraging mask wearing disruption. thought viable option early numbers really got presented me. essentially need let 2 million Americans die get 70% infected rate. top that, suggested (proved, point?) gotten once, there's nothing stopping getting again.

So, 2 million dead, many lifelong medical issues chance get enough immunity done it. viable option, rat-licking sake licking rats. Yes, hospitals paid regain access critical records systems. Hospitals carry cybersecurity insurance incidents too, insurance reimburse part loss. Considering still nowhere near next stimulus checks. lot families face tough Christmas year. Let's hope many choose end lives. Getting things done do. argue it. it.

No, probably  hell yeah Emergency Use Authorization. Basically FDA giving green light use vaccine frontline workers high risk individuals like seniors underlying conditions. FDA grants expect EU UK right humans behave never logical. Fauci seems trying ride fine line keeping people engaged completely hopeless... telling truth all. think ""lockdown"" appropriate term? lot people like it, word ""lockdown"" conveys school shootings stuff like that. Considering still nowhere near next stimulus checks. lot families face tough Christmas year. Let's hope many choose end lives. point incentive produce happy talk, factual information available opaque.

Taiwan, South Korea NZ, among others, show actually necessary vaccine good governance,

And given vaccines generally take years develop, best assume either vaccine anytime soon else fairly low efficacy really change measures need taken.

We singularly blame Trump superspreading vaccine-or-perish mentality.  infected governments outside United States, distorting rhetoric exaggerating expectations.  point society could melt news proves disappointing. Chinese people go India, yet they're getting absolutely fucked COVID. Japan South Korea Chinese mainland tourist hotspots, yet they're also faring much better rest world. logic make sense. 

Taiwanese people wore masks, self isolated properly, huge gatherings anti-maskers twice week. That's numbers low. reason COVID bad NA EU there's many selfish dumbasses care well-being anyone own. suck - full stop. Protect her, no, Covid could reduce distance infectious 80%. N95 would help protect her, research hospital setting repeat exposure builds up, infection eyes openings body become likely.  

The point mask usage reduce likely hood infected person passes virus maintaining social distance. important person usually shows symptoms day 3-6 infection, begins give virus day 1. wearing mask stops giving around you(who also practicing social distancing) even know sick. 

I guess that's fun quick gotcha. But, know, think it. I'm seriously worried bloodshed. Donnie's storm troopers itching use precious second amendment rights. Someone please correct I‚Äôm wrong, think Oxford paused totally while, FDA paused American trials Oxford much longer amount time.

This breaks world K. ;) Articles like sabotage compliance. would someone continue social distancing crud won‚Äôt even help anything?? We're already 318,355 excess deaths year per [this - click ""number excess deaths"" update chart. like 1400 day hit 500k. far we're 210 days we've averaged 1516/day normal going CDC's upper estimate. keep average 123 days... 1516*123+318,355=504,820 dead. Stay away people. cabbage brains. Oh Tegnell deflecting speculating again. He's pathological liar point.

Sweden failed. Tegnell Giesecke obsessed immunity. kept making numbers. Immunity happen. Sweden starts ~~lockdowns~~ ""recommendations stay home avoid physical contact"" October. 8 months late. can't call lockdowns Tegnellists say totally lockdown enforced police. never answer lockdowns work unenforced lockdown ""recommendations"" work.

If FHM ""recommended"" people stay home February. government less cheap put travel restrictions. Thousands would lived. vain Swedes, cowardly FHM cheap social democrats accepted masks. People would lived.

He's completely full shit. blatantly care job right anymore. Read FHM leaks, he's annoyed he's even criticized. 

It's good thing least rest world lost trust Sweden, even Swedes can't see themselves. Well depends significant is. Furthermore depends cost ease / difficulty measures taken. like say there‚Äôs bit nuance there. 
No don‚Äôt think all. Eventually right. let everyone get infected yes definition less spread. lot dead people less spread. large percentage? exactly mean what‚Äôs source?  specific April year? summer yet? live debit/credit exact change only.  open border back up? Things never got better since restricted before. country allowing US travelers right beyond idiotic. one blame ourselves. boss coworkers think this. :c  Orangemanbad: ‚Äú99%‚Äù COVID-19 cases ‚Äútotally harmless.‚Äù

Fauci: ""When became clear infection could spread asymptomatic carriers know they're infected, made clear strongly recommend masks,"" yeah 7 deaths 'excessive' compared China's 4634 USA's 228K deaths. Provide PPE mandate it, targeted lockdowns early waves real financial support people affected. Massive testing/tracing try avoid targeted lockdowns possible.

There good choices here. that's basically least-bad. Instead we'll get long grueling one later on.  agree, heard immunity terrible way go cost many many lives. alternative, shut economy three four years can‚Äôt afford anymore, finally open financial disasters starvation, millions people die anyway virus begins spread everybody unfortunately. can't renovate add kitchen Biden administration competent covered such. Guys worries. Checked White House - clear days ago. Yeah, seen Pzifer, expect something soon?

Also, please excuse ignorance, EUA? Probably worth noting I'm UK. Everything seen thus far says people follow social distancing guidelines, even they‚Äôve previously infected. Thanks - much appreciated!

Trend definitely concerning April year, though? year ever specified? even say this. That's like saying need traffic lights people die traffic anyway... 'Murica means NASCAR style...endless corners...boring deadly corners...pass Busch Light.  know comment low cost joke, hope lol Go live life. wear mask wash hands, common courtesy that. would expect world's leading immunologist know anything infectious disease?

Let's ask citizens Florida instead. Kiwi mental issues, don‚Äôt bother confirm, nice here. Completely normal life year.

And anti-masker irony wear mask since May so, except public transport. Taiwan got shit done beginning year instead people still crying using masks 10 months later. one go school like 3-4 months every single year? take longer break make summer vaccines we're winter/flu season?

Yeah, things said incorrect. Gold. Crypto. Land. thought Trump said beat Covid?! /S  roommate tested positive. We‚Äôre going quarantine 10 day period. need wear masks around other? 33 states already mask mandates. Mine one extended lockdown mask mandate. cases currently growing highest growing.

I'm saying masks work, I'm saying 33 states already mandates majority others ""suggestions"" wear them. expect mask mandate cure all. don‚Äôt immediately solution problem never try find one, got said. they're 50 that's even outside norm. Stop spreading misinformation. yeah going back normal vaccine approved...Like 99.5 percent survival rate even less chance mask.. many quarts talkin? No, don‚Äôt think fucking will.

Europe locked harder US. Look numbers now. Lock downs don‚Äôt work. don‚Äôt fucking work. delay inevitable. That‚Äôs it. Yeah, nah mate. ""camps"" literally 4/5 star hotels. quarantine huge part reason 25 deaths. Parents teach. Especially lower grades like children.

Seriously.

America fucked over. Doctors nurses aren‚Äôt kill save people couldn‚Äôt bothered wear mask.

You‚Äôre going see surges cases tests available people simply can‚Äôt keep businesses closed much longer.

Wearing masks protect themselves. protect people around them. personal responsibility. Guy wants go store, wear mask otherwise he's putting employees risk. Rebuttal employees protect themselves. Okay. Like making rule people wearing masks enter store? like responsibility take control things argument suits side.

all sports fans thinking thin layer cloth enough protect  less recommendation people stay home, though, businesses, restaurants, place commerce still operating past several months.

The county judge proposing shut non-essential businesses much like things back April. Also let parents keep working Naked noses least favorite type people. brother law's brother law (who lives Spain) got tested positive covid. quarantine wife (who get tested) 10 days. quarantine got negative results, also antibodies found either them. antibodies develop serious cases false positive test result? really true though.

Half closing earlier would cheaper easier plus saved lives. deaths lag like month... trying say republicans acting democrats acting putting restrictions. Overreacting good word use, saying opposite OP posted. like cnn now? science says kids die it. No. Actually mean...fuck Trump. 

Thanks chiming though. know people worked something like 7am-11pm days, high earning workaholic. seasonal jobs 7pm-7am every day bellow freezing 3 months. giving attention. closing almost everyrhing.we closing bars, restaurants, cinemas, massage studios, on. making paople stay home. shutdown lockdown. forget super spreader events, mean ""rallies""... argument here? measures last one month, would vacation anyway.
There weekends, business usual two days week cannot see friends different month cannot it.

There good reasons option keep kids home impossible.
It plainly legal constitutional standpoint. cannot 80% kids get education school 20% kids excluded may may properly educated parents.
That would turned court instantly. epidemiologist? right, dont let luddites get you. health organizations noted 3 waves
 Theyre waves bars, zero out. live that. Idk. Maybe fucking anything? Moron decided switch new hairdresser never wears mask. choice there? Idk, could handle like EU: cut military budgets subsidize small business lockdowns. Unfortunately, lockdowns proven effective there‚Äôs way around since vaccine projected reach US July. countries EU test every single citizen age 6, also proven effective. I‚Äôm saying way better yours, options. actually sad definitely what's gonna happen Churchill racist genocidal maniac. I‚Äôm sorry position in. I‚Äôm grateful workers like you. think cops would love masks, seems like would make even easier get away violence. 

Maybe want hide mustaches? effectively advantage virus run rampant? [We turning corner said trump, turning  keeping wearing properly. I'm sorry going share disgust selfish dumbasses behave.

This supposed center education. teaching? idiot?

Or go flat earther anti vaxer? sign destroying 5g towers prevent covid 101? Pretty sure cops attacking protesters entire lifetime. pretty broad discression deal protesters decide line. Covid lock downs enforced broadly large protests. Even right wing ones.... 

Being able enforce forms quartine last ditch option times plague cornerstone well formed health system.

A mask stepping stone anything except less sevre forms quarantine. goal masks let people move freely. Assuming masks work even little help avoid stringent measures like closing non essential business.

Let science background continue correct theory masks work. assume days google searching overrides public health recommendations made globally best public health experts.

The reality make new laws time. freedom ends actions negatively impact freedom others. laws abide generally goal. social pact signed for. Masks public totally reasonable way enhance public safety minimal cost everyone.

Just like let people steal stuff harms others. also let people carelessly wander around public spreading deadily virus. masks work best infected person keep virus spreading them. way around. Hi everyone.

I Egyptian I'm resident Switzerland. plan travel Egypt soon require negative PCR result (max. 72 hours boarding) order allowed travel there. cost test quite expensive Switzerland, wondering possible test France, would lot cheaper (I live near border). anyone know allowed, since resident France? really idea regulations regarding would appreciate help. cause lot infections? course, would highly recommend visiting www.rapidtests.org. homepage tell antigen tests they‚Äôre critical surveillance (not diagnostic) purposes. linked advocacy group led Dr. Michael Mina, epidemiologist Harvard, well coalition researchers find ‚Äúabout‚Äù page.

""OK friends family willing risk it""


""No no...not ME. get sick, go club"" Hmmm I'm sure accurate say little cases...page 14 shows provinces cases south, page 16 shows cases per capita south.

That said, super interesting see much better surrounding areas. surprised got hit hard enough first wave that's enough slow spread second wave - I'm convinced enough full blown herd immunity.

Also surprised areas got hit hardest social distancing areas got hit less hard, could make look like herd immunity actually do. ‚ÄòCould.‚Äô could still win election. It‚Äôs nothing. doesn‚Äôt exist thing. governor could shut us would already done so. legislature turn around blame later.
Big 10 causing this. canceled next game staff players tested positive. university done pretty well month. rural areas general public done themselves. fox valley live hell earth people nothing wrong. school started virtually happened anyway. EMT NJ , good guys. Many nursing homes unfortunately starting surge again. People forgot March April devastation.  could upset right now, especially long held good numbers for. viral load independent symptoms. Meaning, asymptotic people shed much virus symptoms.

But that's unrelated sick get?

If get low viral dose, could still virus multiply internally equal levels, low dose could help body generate better immune response learning low quantities rather overwhelmed immediately actually agree point, think (and nurse wrote article) misrepresenting paper.

To understanding, broke U.S. 10 regions found that, three regions, period least one month pandemic COVID-19 overtook overdoses leading cause death among aged 25-44.

This *bad* still evidence favor point making. However, even close thing saying ""Covid-19 leading cause death 25-44 year olds U.S.A."" 

I also add that, simply let virus run rampant (more already doing), doubt literal claim would come true. wonder passengers would legal grounds go guy damages?

It‚Äôs bullshit dressed sound science-ish delivered lot bluster confidence. user account pretty dedicated concept. back march opinion gain function research dangerous worth though would like respark debate.

I've arrived position opposite side that. Molecular genetics technology becoming citizen-scientist level accessible. Certainly small organization accessible. ban gain-of-function research academic &amp; government, settings there's least oversight expectations public progress &amp; publication, result research continuing ""underground"". underground lot people duplicating work instead tracking publications. misstated.

Continually shutting everything answer. Mandatory hotel quarantine works - country (Aus) gets 7 cases day supposedly ‚Äòclean‚Äô passengers.

The way keep importing cases population. Ill take trhe chinese one thanks hate misconception much. opinions health experts life return normal moving farther away, expectations life return normal moving farther away. give way optimistic prognostications come.

When quarantine began, said life return normal April. April came, May. May came, June. June came, July. July came, August. August came, started listening health experts, 2021 seems like push back, really push-forward.

When quarantine began, public health experts saying life would return normal 2024 2025. August started saying 2022, saying 2021.

As vaccine. May June, said could get vaccine July, said ""we'll get vaccine July!"", always said possibility, certainty. August 1 came vaccine, said might approve vaccine September. said ""OH GOD, WE'LL GET VACCINE SEPTEMBER,"" then, October 1 came vaccine. Now, companies making specific plans apply approval November, opposed possibility. Better compare tiny town called B√ºtchenbach. could say 20 million equivqlent currently infected. WWJD? COVID patients getting intubated anymore. helps prevent getting infected Flu Covid time seems linked increased risk severe illness / death? okay thats stupid country boy. work actually done physically person. way around it. amazon uber eats. actual food production distribution. power grid maintenance etc. Feds. sure Feds actually either though. both, eh? course. Everything open here.

Come down, don‚Äôt stay long, 3-7 days ideal.  Valid point. want downplay number severity pandemic. Sorry. 

My comment direction imminent danger contagious people around.  type lockdown would have? cant stop everything working. jobs done physically person still need done absolute chaos Well that‚Äôs witty.

But come on, ever tried get one Floridaman something, let alone 11,000,000. I‚Äôll tell ya. It‚Äôs impossible feat. Called him, asked call back later /s think that?

That would one helluva wedding $190 head ""far less"" profit.  ""Herd immunity fans"" far generous people. 

This spin folks said initially-- let's sacrifice people virus save economy.

It exact death-cult position appropriating scientific terms lend credence relaxed it, it‚Äôs like wearing shirt tell people you‚Äôve already it.

Although someone needs make ‚ÄúI Covid got damn shirt‚Äù shirts Oh, know. lived Marseille awhile. recently husband spent summer Europe area heatwave 35-40 day weeks.

I think need lockdowns, would hella nice neighbors could skip weddings in-house, mask Halloween parties. people put quarantine exposure would stay home. simple common sense things. embarrassing. Nursing home outbreaks local hospitals issuing warnings they're getting full people still acting like give damn anyone else. Like there's way connection anyone working at-risk people--who guess matter them, even fight wars. Like respect first responders frontline healthcare professionals cleaning mess.

It's one thing keep country schools running, another take risks selfish, unnecessary reasons. They're sure experts wrong they're betting people's lives it, listen even Republican leaders state saying sensible. hard watch. word add word day: *hyperbole*  Absolutely. Science could even go - using Bayesian inference assess probabilities different possibilities. Listing possibilities probabilities something more. often look absolutes, like ""up 200k Americans could die covid pandemic ends"" discredit science results fit exact predictions. always fit 95% confidence intervals available data. confidence intervals wide time ignore predictions - time leverage affect results highest acting immediately. shut nursing homes make  disabled old people dont access assisted living! close schools prevent kids learning! next, force everyone plastic bubble breathing holes, wear cloth coverings breathing holes Hi I'd like say thank doing.

Things different now. wonder Badgers wiill ever play anothe gam yea? interim analysis evaluate efficacy... that's done release numbers public. looked today, last night looked NYTimes, nine top 20 cities/towns hit worst right Wisconsin. Four North Dakota, left 7 areas rest country top 20. Yikes. would much better suffering another shutdown dragging winter

what makes think would different results first time Penne rigatoni? vaccine way urgency masks IMO

Your humble opinion mistaken. N95 masks provably reduce infection mortality. right now. save lives right now, cut exponential infection roots, right now. See urgency?

There exactly one reason lack urgency regards N95 masks: put billions pockets pharmaceutical giants. issue people legitimate reasons vaccinating, people immunocompromised. negatively affected idiots vaccinating. gave good laugh correctly basically wrong. know prevalence long-term organ damage know permanent.

In case, personally taking chances. pointing country lot problems.  enough data suggest variant, known 20A.EU1, deadly, team University Basel, ETH Z√ºrich Basel, SeqCOVID Spain said exactly? we're seeing many cases EU?

mutated version contagious, less lethal? halloween Belgium? add comment businesses going receive much help time around. Long term effects playing btw, pays them, much pro sportler earn year, donations charity events collect funds? Bread games keep masses amused. sure hope too. Gooood luck. People even follow first one. inherited wealth. cheated way school someone else write tests him. 

And lazy way stuck day. EVERYTHING! bankrupt Casino. 

He could done something pandemic. easier lie make fairy tales go away. literally minimum. cost countless lives. Lives care least. Lol don‚Äôt fuck Apparently so. guess lived long enough see church advocate public nudity times. that?! They‚Äôre exacerbating problem. already everything I‚Äôm supposed to. Masks, distancing, hermit behavior, etc. need hope damn shit end. doubt many covid deniers visiting sub anymore save doom forums. Yeah, I'm aware that. Check edit comments. think enough known long term effects unfortunately. Yes, odds bunch college kids get COVID, would die. However, lot stories long terms effects brain heart that's nothing mess around with. believe shutting things anything extreme think people overly cautious it. year two large parties wearing masks. sucks making look harder is. Give weeks. Sweden took pretty aggressive approach isolating seniors, allowed hospitalizations deaths plummet (compared nations. one else adopting this??

&amp;#x200B;

It's literally 95% people dying age 80 Well, that's even great news. european still think AstraZeneca/Pfitzer licenced earlier since news rolling review already weeks ago, none Johnson&amp;Johnson, J&amp;J catch up, I'll happy see it. Lol, little vulgar agree. Wait people think we‚Äôre going flat months end? Serious question

I‚Äôm nurse major city. know literally hundreds people healthcare field. Barely anyone working before. Basically every nurse know 3 shifts week that‚Äôs it. someone else mentioned couple weeks ago here, sars-cov-2 make peepee rot. Pandemic would since months. Yes, difference countries follow UN says lot often, military exercises around disputed areas etc. China ramming Filipino fishing boats South china sea, they're threatening conquer Taiwan constantly flying fighter jets across Taiwan strait, clashes border India, fly bombers near Japan etc. that's within last months... 
‚Äî Initial exposure, strength virus infection seen contributors illness severity

But ok... vaccine-induced herd immunity vaccinations. duh. 

My state one strictest mask mandates*, we're one handful states vertiginous rise cases. 


* say one ICU numbers practically stable since Monday. consider important indicator since measures serious cases ability healthcare system deal them. need see stay like longer Poor Spain. don‚Äôt understand mean people getting infected sources. Don‚Äôt people generally get infected one source? vaccine-induced herd immunity vaccinations best solution. Nah think so. I'd rather think female leaders would look male leaders differently learn them. 11th state official test positive Arkansas past week so. Ten state legislators also tested positive forget. nights early April ambulances ran non stop area picking people. lost 4 neighbors coworker vent stupid virus. 

I want back there. Naw busy running around woods AR-15 lovers bombs, plotting kill governor masks FREEDUMB!!!!.

(Sorry great, non insane Michigan folks.) Shouldn‚Äôt health care workers get prisoners? :-( one alarmist sensationalize fear read help think 80k day right now. can't imagine 2 weeks Halloween many people little regard attend big parties, time starts establish new average. comes Thanksgiving Christmas. guess simply replacing self tests. Sk√•ne self test summer. throat, nasal saliva. think self testing issue. kind self test (is?) used Stockholm. Please correct wrong. Cases.

The trials predetermined number symptomatic COVID-19 cases need hit researchers get readout results. number computed using various statistical methods determined published advance prevent effect ""take readout time results look favorable"". already reported sister law attempting indoor halloween party, thanksgiving christmas party indoors. Fuck her. 

oh, wear masks become thing within last 10 years. Lol. I'm doing. RuINinG cHiLhoOdS. Probably first thing shes tested positive for. can‚Äôt count many times I‚Äôve seen article different sources publishers. 

YES, know isn‚Äôt going come public use 2020! They're testing more. course numbers going go up. got politicized long time ago. folk test group getting would pretty bad thing. fact trials still going evidence prevent infection. I‚Äôm sure police going around throwing people jail won‚Äôt cause issues 2020 I‚Äôm you; definitely regional. southeast, we‚Äôre getting hit pretty hard worst coming us like runaway train whose brakes failed.

Mask wearing increased still majority. us wear self-quarantine parties, theaters, weddings, place deemed unsafe, frequently called sheep, sheeple, Biden love, traitor, even...wait it...Nazis. 

It gets tiring. virus exhaustion. financial collapse exhaustion. election exhaustion. freakin‚Äô exhausted chaos coming us directions.

I, however, continue protecting loved ones. sadly, many started correct train thought allowed bullied it.

A mask mandate, TEETH, correct problem. take (I teens seatbelt law passed remembered tyranny remarks) hoopla die will. 

And maybe us take seriously get lives back. meantime, keep reminding patience virtue it‚Äôs getting harder day.  COVID-19 vaccine, effective, expected match variants - think God probably pretty hurt cover genitals made image genitals.

If hurting God covering faces, must devastated Catholics hostile anyone showing God like genitals. Apparently understand concept herd immunity. hit herd immunity, cases would drop, increase. That's entire meaning word ""immunity."" region upper part lower peninsula upper peninsula. Damn realize social clubs tax exempt status. Interesting stuff. Amen! vaccine requires two shots administered several weeks apart (not sure much exactly) start counting cases certain amount time second shot (because someone falls ill vaccine time start working counted). means there's significant delay (1-2 months depending trial details) someone getting first shot person becoming viable subject. moth balls   Muh economy It‚Äôs hard proper will...nonetheless agree you.

Watching mess made wonder people even part species. Impressive! think great Villages don‚Äôt smell like icy hot hair dye.

Plus clear BINGO put indoor rock climbing walls, maybe ultimate ninja warrior course, sky‚Äôs limit.

And idea many houses build golf courses. I‚Äôm drooling thought property tax, especially 2020 assessments without grandfathered homestead tax exemptions.

That‚Äôs much money give away to, mean invest business partners. Biden going fix anything. government can't crap fix this, people fix it. know people want hear this, every single death Donald Trump's fault. bunch countries deaths per capita US nobody blaming leadership deaths. always going kill lot people matter government reacted it. Sure, Biden upgrade child like Trump make matters worse running mouth. However, government can't solve problem without cooperation people. That's like saying making marijuana illegal would stop people smoking it. Laws mandates mean nothing unless people follow Democrats Republicans know can't shut economy people fix us unfortunately many idiots willing make sacrifices. won‚Äôt happen reason EU can‚Äôt force complete shutdown member nations, don‚Äôt power so. USA really 50 different countries plus DC territories, it‚Äôs states make decisions. Hypothetically national shutdown attempted would immediately challenged courts. really hope next time target girl inappropriate skirt length, tosses words right back them. kids went Catholic elementary school daughter written wearing sweater-cause long sleeve white button blouse risqu√© 3rd grader. Sound Earth ever lucky. 

No, seriously. I'm starting think Earth fed shit gonna get pound flesh somehow. people Michigan realize dumb look rest people country? Bingo Clothes shield humanity too.

We nekked like dear old adam eve. Holy moly. perceiving/distorting purpose wearing masks global pandemic, else willing distort? someone making choice drive, it‚Äôs fault people ordering. It‚Äôs government‚Äôs fault supporting vulnerable citizens. Attacking people trying right thing helpful. People don‚Äôt tip delivery people ones go after. wasting drivers‚Äô time selfishly expecting service minimum amount money. child higher average chance contracting virus parents WANT around students wearing masks???? 

I feel sorry innocent kids bad luck born idiot parents. hope survive get hell insanity. Tell stop bunch punks wear masks like devil devil told jump cliff wait God save him. Another potential side issue effectiveness. 50% effective people act like they're immune, could unintended negative consequences. Deaths near 0 months now. Sweden hit herd immunity common sense way. see people caring way less before. Hospitals Utah, live, collapsed, yet see fb friends traveling, hiking groups, going parties, walmart half people wearing masks, including many walmart employees noses mask, etc. mess. areas hardest hit primarily low income Latino neighborhoods vote blue.

We *also* idiots Huntington Beach, they're bearing brunt it. It‚Äôs France‚Äôs fault. locked one week ago Belgium could‚Äôve locked week. 

^/s think it‚Äôs lot new generation handle. think need specialists psychology field ASAP. I‚Äôm sure logistics this, certain vaccines people taking MS Ocravis aren‚Äôt allowed might happen anyway want thank saying ""socially distanced"" rather ""social-distanced"" like see everywhere. ray hope dark time. Probably likely events movie ""Independence Day"" happening. Considering cops would ticket PA driving unless going life sustaining business. staying indoors letting humans actually want humans things it? Oh, doctrine ""facial integrity"" painted (therefore masking) contemporary portraits female saints make look better ""God"" thought right? think issue physical lack hospitals able perform surgery. Ew gross. Probably tested positive things too.. anybody suggests got deserved, ask parents went got sick, would still say it? Better treatments.

Without either those, perpetual scourge, like many diseases throughout history. There's option, really. 

Luckily, vaccines looking good far. Also, J&amp;J targeting single-shot regime, versus two shots leading candidates. Since trial protocols count cases detected certain amount time final shot administered, single-shot approach J&amp;J means effectively catch several weeks compared others (on top massive logistical advantages single-shot vaccine goes market). Deaths lag cases. get covid die next day. People live couple months dying. also depends age group that's getting covid now. younger, are, less deaths. time, shows herd immunity strategy failed. Believe not, NHS actually ability see total CC capacity national level prior covid. 

The ability put place haphazardly march April; I'm talking shitty excel spreadsheets used dashboards sent email 8am day, clunky shit.

Now little civilized, dashboards regional level. access London South East England only. people access 7 regions, that's COBR level stuff. surge capacity readily available dashboards either.  live Sweden. huge tent outside university allowing everyone test. given one month ago without asking one. Last time someone made claim, went throw every regional website 1177 found regions bar J√∂nk√∂ping offering tests everyone. news you: Instead 25-40% population giving shit like now, none vaccines made Phase 3, see something like 75-90% people giving shit anymore. pretty much everyone around would virus spreader. people, except privileged WFH indefinitely live minimal social contact, 2, 3, 5 years, however long takes develop next candidate vaccine.

Luckily, hypothetical unlikely scenario good progress made. Bad title. died covid got him. might lived equipment left save him. Big nine-page report, heralded physicians across country, indicates doctors finding heart abnormalities COVID-positive athletes longer recommending cardiac screenings experienced mild symptoms symptoms.

Covered genitals make Jesus cry hurt god.

He worked *very* hard genitals hurts feelings show every opportunity. Extroverts seem draw strength outside selves participating events like socializing, work, about. 

Introverts seem draw strength within, working projects plan execute selves.

I'm surprised introverts better average pandemic. talking viral loads terms expelling rates. referring initial viral load entry rates: load made sick.

I.e. get 10 100mcg virus make difference sick get, even eventual emission rate same. yeah this. people building love get past front desk take mask wait elevator.. like... thanks? dipshits evolutionary process

One problem. Someone people honestly can‚Äôt take vaccines. often people would almost definitely die get COVID.

The 30% don‚Äôt get vaccinated, take vaccines, lead deaths others take vaccines.

This real problem.  Even like compare countries, imposible compare USA Germany. Check population density. guys huge!
The happens Spain Italy, majority population lives cities population density areas high!
Add: German polity virus stop it, slow down, vaccine available. Dude, pointed previously scientific concensus. Expert opinions honor consensus point moot.

If however completely disconnected scientific process entire point arguments go ahead, stay mad.

Trump keeps saying ""it could much worse. Millions could dead know"". 

Now, I'm expert, neither Trump, numbers keeps parroting estimates would happen NOTHING done - masks, lock downs, social distancing, etc. 

He's fucking stupid acknowledge this, uses bizarre validation he's handled pandemic ""perfectly"". There's conspiracy.

One guy -- Trump -- poisoned well everyone.

With rational US president, would dumping money variety programs without hyping raising expectations world implode without vaccine.  would accept rationally efforts may succeed may fail.

The panic mongers White House. vaccine-or-perish mentality never touted government industrialized nation.  remarkably stupid cynical sell message public world going end vaccine produced record time. would wrong. original year end estimates worst case infection scenarios 200k-1.7M dead, according CDC Fauci. countries those? Last checked, places spiking. Sure, government hasn‚Äôt perfect job, people haven‚Äôt really helping cause either.

Fwiw, don‚Äôt like Trump think response could handled way better. I‚Äôve also paying attention local governance much him. also assuming Trump legitimately lose. saddest part race still close. Zero. Trump congress failing pass Covid relief bill guaranteed know is, name like know everything fancy cars. america there's nothing normal first place Yeah, us understood masks worked long President begrudgingly wore one one time hospital. really strict ever? see less reimposing restrictions spring.

He‚Äôs ton debt making lot president. loses go TV, make insane amount money, still massive political figure.

But, needs *something* keep base interested Biden wins (if does). calls stolen election, pageantry around it, etc. serve two purposes: lower turnout maybe give higher chance winning, keeping base engaged loses turn TV audience. things going well here, hardly business closings everyone know working remote. NYC/NJ area USA. Hell many like received pay raises received $1000 dollar relief money Trumps administration too. dont pay commute, sleep longer. saving money going things like bowling/bars/movies. going camping weekends camp sites packed people, great, hand sympathize area. located generally? vaccine, guess. dreaming, honey.

Edit: Another one late last month. feel like I'm taking crazy pills people:
 I'm getting tired sub blaming people government failed us every turn people tired endlessly strung along.

Countries competent government responses got control US Europe could too. Italians literally dieing play along hoax. Crazy. feel ya. choice wasn‚Äôt easy one though able make consideration health.

I‚Äôve using time learn things home. I‚Äôm strongest I‚Äôve ever I‚Äôm learning ton art/computer science skills.

I wish well there. sucks matter look it. lie.

The CDC worst case scenario predictions 200k-1.7M end year.

That claim *end pandemic*. Plus, likely 300k actual deaths now. 

Stop lying. Really? What‚Äôs source? sure testament human intuition problem solving medicine means reason forgo mask mix others unless it‚Äôs essential. think seem high, that's exponential growth works. They'll much lower start actually trying handle it, even biden wins doubt anti-mask crowd change ways. Great post.

The U.S. done beginning.

I knew time, many others.

But drowned multitudes idiots. Literal conspiracy theorist play know post good news sub. groomers come you. actually think COVID help Trump. supporters think hoax go polls wearing mask, people believe COVID might stay home. already know work perfectly nobody expects to, news priced in. already somewhat known antibodies fade. know blown away heard frump bring debate. Like think makes look good?!? all?! Doctors hate one trick! Yeah. 

The good news looking pretty good regarding vaccines. even without one, may still get better better treatments. hard Biden dramatically change much around COVID-19 since much depends personal behavior partisan now.

However, things like PPE production area could make real difference, even take months get much online. Also providing federal money even military aid help overrun hospitals.  twitter explodes! Incredible! Thank you!!!! I've learned much! awesome! managed meat factory employees.[Trump orders meat processing plants stay open u see Defense Brain fog, confusion, tremors hands, arms legs, general weakness, whatever causes fall times, name symptoms. 

Lately, I've struggling even lift bottle Gatorade. things say good know hedging bets. Ever wonder hedge funds operate? operate hope? That's children blind religious. Knowledge way.

Measure, math, find predictable outcomes. plan always successful. Say glimpse future last year...and knew villagers would protesting rioting. Good time get selling pitchforks torches dont think?

The obvious reoccurrence fire California land mismanagement. would easy predicted major fires right? somewhat intelligent open eyes? maybe move invest markets reap benefit fire.

I'm giving fair warning things come. open eyes plan. world, conspiracy funded Soros? huge proponent masks, would prefer soft power rather mandates DC. would prefer states mask mandate X date would either excluded future stimulus/relief funds prorate amount receive based quickly put mandate place given date. 

Masks necessary, I'm hesitant Federal overreach tends arise crises never seem relinquish afterward. I'm favor 50 states employing mask mandates satisfied using power purse make happen. Sweden's approach led higher death rate per capita neighbours like powers America proving Fauci right without even attempting show opposite. don‚Äôt see we‚Äôre going prevent virtually everyone getting current policies .... ‚ÄùSo said people: slow testing please!‚Äù - President United States. True enough. actually live SETX really get snow (and do, EXCITING!) heard lot North stuck inside dark gets old really fast. get rain not-blazing-hot-temps, that's actually nice break summer people. Considering 94% people died covid least one major comorbid condition I'd say much better anticipated.

You realize make *zero* sense, right? factored in. magic phrase.

Literally better end worst case pretending that's ok? know pretty much half Americans sort comorbity. ‚ÄúMeth: it‚Äù ones? Could case too. Lets hope though, without vaccine would mean we'll live like seasonal flu. time though enough infections, hope virus become less less lethal. mean tell experience observation, it‚Äôs smaller things like friends streets even coworkers starting greet kisses hugs, people keeping distance line store using public transportation. assume many fatigue others false sense security seeing numbers low summer seeing things ‚Äúgoing back normal‚Äù. OK even that. lets say half many die. taking 4% death rate drops two thats still 50k people US alone going die covid currently actively infected. Millions kids still going school coming home every day families?

Hmmmmm, okay.

Great lockdown. 2.6% death rate, still 3.5 million dead..... Yeah you‚Äôre right. Someone tell ‚ÄúExperts don‚Äôt recommend drinking cyanide‚Äù want make illegal It‚Äôs either Biden wants lock us like France. it‚Äôs went flu surveillance website checled data myself. suggest try it. early on, seen stories like months now. thanks, i'll watching youtube rest evening lol Thank kindness say news fake, quality journalism overall awful. really is. impeach Supreme Court Justices. anything untoward, Senate tips blue anymore would solid reason so. top there's reason Justice would political allegiance outside interpretation law. Pretty sure read comments word lockdown doesn‚Äôt appear. I‚Äôm Swedish constitutional lawyer I‚Äôm pretty sure aren‚Äôt either. said let‚Äôs see things change. don‚Äôt think will. think might. disagree. That‚Äôs fine. Let‚Äôs wait see Look balance votes people.

Some idiot skips entire comment instead replying counter argument well thought reply, asks ""just cited DM source"" .... honestly matter mainstream story read anywhere?

I reply tell stop ridiculous give 3 links sources get downvoted whilst gets upvoted.

Are really much hive mind here? hit downvote anything goes ""team""? Regardless merit post? 

Come guys... fucking better. made up, would screech, ""it joke know it""? too. know 2 ex-NAVY Nuclear Engineers believe numbers inflated somehow every doctor entire world part mass conspiracy making money. Quarantines hurt business, hurting business would lead hurt people virus ever could.  even happen immunity would worn time. virus probably mutated well less deadly form time. That‚Äôs truly ended it. since mutations random cannot predict long take. would pretend Space Force real? symptoms past 28 days, 95% symptoms past 8 weeks. study self reported symptoms COVID tracker app, caveats selection bias apply.

B.) timing enemy pretty obvious here. Organized crime Russia operates permission/blessing government may trade resources accountability need arises. Russia attacking elections here, that's it, plain simple.


Wear mask. Vote. click stupid links emails, Carol. dinosaurs still there. safe. 

Wear mask. see places half people wear mask, visit it. spring year, came stages. Italy, Spain, France, UK countries coming along sequence. Whereas seems surges happening simultaneously across continent surprising course disturbing.

So seems like spring, infection peaks happened different times different countries based spread infection. now, infected people every region rates changing based seasonal behavior. makes perfect sense. even gets far. Trump son calling armies storm polling places Tuesday. odds one gets shot? guess conservative estimate Fauci following science. time weren‚Äôt sure cloth masks would work instead put priorities working ICU units first proper masks. found cloth masks help reduce spread virus therefore easily accessible general public reduce spread virus. 
It would ridiculous Fauci, immunologist served every president since 1984, double views wrong, rather adapt change following science save lives. Boy, scientists ability change stance new data comes along. Sounds like small town Nebraska. 

I wonder large cities doing? problem. want really geek monetary system policy, Check Jeff Snider Youtube. *This* one smart due knows monetary system exceptionally well read tie lot things together. Eurodollar University series chock full nuggets understanding goes behind curtain got here. talk concepts context current events, older episodes obviously discussing past situations, still good, newer ones current contexts. 

I also really like Brent Johnson, Lyn Alden, Dr Lacy Hunt. Steven van Metre good too. He's kind like financial Mr Rogers. 

I work finance, I'm dumb compared smart people.

Cheers! Good points. epidemiologist 30+ years experience lot better interpreting data regarding disease spread journalist Financial Times. Oh goodness. know thing.  Great news! would indicate we've better learned apply right treatments, therapeutics care moderate severe cases. Made day bit brighter. Thanks sharing. Lmao think American critical country's covid response. Take care shit maybe maybe we'll border open summer.  remember seeing number couldn‚Äôt sleep terrified was. y‚Äôknow beat guys! pre-existing conditions is! sure. NYT article said he‚Äôs 400 million dollars worth debt. 

He‚Äôs making nearly enough pay president.

As head TV channel sudden 10s millions new viewers?? Oh baby. That‚Äôs profitable anything mans ever done.

I still believe ran 2016 publicity Trump TV. It‚Äôs secret Kushner floating Trump TV trump entire presidency. think wants get TV ASAP.

Why? It‚Äôs win-win. make millions, billions, still massive political following. 

I think he‚Äôll leave presidency less issues many think, he‚Äôs got fat Trump TV paycheck waiting side.

Bad news even Biden wins trump conceded gracefully, he‚Äôs going anywhere. imagine China instead ? adjusted population, would 2 million dead.. would western newspapers printed China 2 minion equivalent chinese died ?

But US, swept rug readily accepted .

The double standards inane. living cave something. I‚Äôve got maskless rallies Trump home city. Signs hanging front porches saying it‚Äôs liberal hoax cooked Dems...and I‚Äôm fucking Vermont. Stupid everywhere, man. suggesting that. saying observe two different approaches almost starting metrics. ECDC data ourworldintada uses seems put new deaths reported Germany latest date (I doubt 89 deaths reported occurred today) Sweden's data closer Sweden's official FHM numbers are.

It thing spring; Sweden's official numbers formed ""ever-declining curve"" gave illusion deaths always going zero.

This work actual problems. long, long time. ignore homeless, mentally ill, poor, oppressed, dying, sick. ignore political corruption fall American empire, want.

But can't ignore virus. know people never encountered reality what, sure socking kisser really like it. We'll see pained declarations done disease actually works, **makes everything worse**. bets black here.

Being done covid means covid done us. Gosh. Stay strong Italy. actually difficult, South Korea, NZ others demonstrate.

The problem impossible solve con men Trump helm.  solution, cancer. It‚Äôs GOP Supreme Court. 

It matter justices interpret constitution. 

Remember RBG‚Äôs best friend was? conservative judge ‚Äúconstitutionalist‚Äù. understood difference matter interpretation. Yes, pray get fired Speak yourself. great chance travel Las Vegas 6 half months now. saw statistics Japan, crazy low is. Last year time 3,550 cases influenza Japan week. year: 20. Yeah I'm objectively telling you. deaths drop at-risk people healthcare workers vaccinated society start shft back normal. COVIDs secondary effects starting outweigh COVID point. Opening countries tourism borderline moronic summer.

""there worldwide pandemic going on, doesn¬¥t matter, lets open gates tourism lets great summer!"" know much better informed are. least back then, news publications based mostly fact, professional reporters research investigation releasing news articles. 

Now kinds media spouting kinds bullsh+t hard separate fact fiction. didn‚Äôt explain, added detail. Please, convenient Trump-haters?  thought going "" degree illustration "". used brain think germs spread understand  also would *prefer* soft mandates people right thing own. that's working, primarily (I believe) group within government sharing misinformation discouraging mask wearing. Actually beginning, cdc fauchi said deaths covid US gonna million. china's spending military consistently 1.9% GDP. grown relative GDP, course grown absolute terms given GDP grown absolute terms. Watch guys, tough guy here.... Doesnt matter 60 % country blueberry hills, forest rolling mountains. 
Urbanisation Sweden: 87.1 % 
Svealand G√∂taland make 90 % population 40 % country's size (and Svealand includes barely populated regions Dalarna V√§rmland) didnt facebook internet back politicized sure hell extent today. agree say back wed shoot people wearing masks, take will....Them good ol days. No, they're recommendations/advice. That's strong emphasis get swedish bureaucrat-speak.

I really can't see hard people understand. Public Health Agency gives advice/guidances people generally follows them. like spring.

The FHM adviced people socially distance, work home, avoid creating crowded spaces, people followed advice. number ICU-cases/deaths gone levels summer/early fall people ignored advice.

You must really low expectations peoples sense responsibility think punish people fines follow public health guidelines meant protect rest society.

&amp;#x200B;

Plus, legally forced lockdowns possible Sweden would change constitution. would require general election, vote change constitution, another general election another vote confirming vote. would take probably around 6 months, thats rushing it. suggesting done nothing 6+ months? who, what? get blame mess Trump left behind.

The excuses coming even takes office. forms speaking of, specifically? mean prohibitive nationwide scale? April? thought soon elections Dems going turn 5G bands Covid gays gone?






FFS /s really hope outlandish. I'm gonna save comment check back March. Let's see horrible things gotten really far fetched estimate. Solving issue pandemic becomes lot difficult without one. may so....but *responsible* leaders cause concern. Trump *was not* leader moved goal posts. 44.5 million cases almost 1.5 million deaths worldwide remove Trump office? guys really dense people. feel sorry functioning brain developed critical thinking. Godsped Read replies. Theyre upset Sweden's state epidemiologist blowing ""casedemic"" entirely proportion.

Edit: skeptic. pointing morons Twitter. know biden wins fox news etc post death numbers daily blaming biden ‚ÄúForced‚Äù

Forced implies something untoward. law followed letter.

Edit: don‚Äôt happy Trump got three picks ‚Äúforced‚Äù simply rhetoric. lol know, entirely different places.

The point competent leadership, displayed NZ, greatly reduce negative impacts virus. Agreed, make best comparison, point government US completely bungled crisis. know, Fox want see Biden win too. lot ‚Äúbetter‚Äù attacking Obama polishing Trump turd. Attacking someone easy, pretending administration wasn‚Äôt shit show straining credulity makes look like apologist weaklings. believe spelled Covid-Barrett. Curious, anyone know prevalence/mortality rate seasonal flu year? wonder data discriminates two? produced vaccine quickly, also many people partial immunity.

I relatively aware ten year old 1968 paid attention current events. clearly remember assassinations Martin Luther King Bobby Kennedy, riots political conventions summer, honestly even remember anyone discussing flu thing. remember anyone know sick dying. None aged relatives died year. remember many empty seats fourth grade classroom. certainly scary 1918 pandemic. republican, greateat fear billionaire trying help people. Time new bf, get married guy really want them(just-no's) in-laws? Yea, that's kind sense get vaccine. need man asap. favorite old haunts around home announcing they're ""closed season"". sad see knowing world look completely different next year. said yesterday I'm surprised people repeating it.

logistics aside..

maybe remember.

the biggest health crisis US covid fucking MEASLES.

MMR vaccine given hundreds millions kids since 70's.. 

yet... US still measles Decision-Making** Measles Resurgence United sentiment get STRONGER since nobody world ever even HEARD COVID19 vaccine 2020. I'm aware name oxymoron actual name current governing party Ontario. commonly know Conservatives, Cons Tories. rarely ever use full name except we're mocking it, giving context something. one example affect much, close proximity extended duration much masks mitigate. 

Further article uses bar classroom examples. bar drops 14/17 8/17 mask, drops 1/17 reduced time ventilation.

For 2 hour class, classroom drops 12/24 5/24 masks, ""drops dramatically"" room ventilated class breaks hour let air completely refresh. (Does give number value) link rules haven‚Äôt seen them. forget /s * knew novel virus Chinese New Year. 
* knew largest migration people (IIRC around 400 mil), would spread virus like crazy
* could asked China stop citizens traveling (they that, they're authoritarian fuck) knew virus
* knew China likely transparent data - like totalitarian state

So things could done:

* China stopped traveling New Year, stop travel to/from China mandatory quarantine anyone comes China. talking VOLUNTARY quarantine, cause people stupid assholes. Lock place nice. want ? stay fuck there. 
* soon cases showed up, strict lockdown 1-2 months. MEAN STRICT !!!! None wishy-washy half-ass measures. Fine shit anyone breaking rules. time first cases showed up, knew coronavirus, knew related SARS. 

We know lockdowns quarantines work. Lock relatively small number cases, lockdown shorter. 

* Take care people lockdowns economic issues leave homeless starving. Provide generous stimulus. 
* lockdown prepare lifting lockdown stocking PPE, teaching people make masks home, information campaign inform why, prepare massive testing capacities
* lift lockdown, strict enforcement mask wearing social distancing another 2-4 weeks
* Harsh fines breaking pandemic related rules, like wearing mask, breaking quarantine. sick people break quarantine often, FORCED quarantine. ""Muh rights"" give anyone right infect kill people.
* new outbreak, strict local lockdowns, quarantine contact infected people, aggressive testing contact tracing
* Keep travel rules place 1-2 years vaccine ready population vaccinated agree people wearing masks way oversold politicians even drs. Masks good idea evidence suggest going stop virus even slow much. UK beating America new cases? Must tied weather. still nice warm States.  truly hate breaking people. fauci says ‚Äúthere measures throughout 2021‚Äù means probably still wear mask retirement home October 2021. Measures right sustainable another year. Politicians federally locally know this. Fauci policy maker, advisor. It‚Äôs going like another year one day measures dropped pandemic over~ hallelujah. except things shift back springtime. lot industries simply survive another socially distanced summer. none election day. politically expedient. interesting question might start talking november 4th Hey, haven‚Äôt stated otherwise, point still stands. objective POV, draconian lockdowns aren‚Äôt way handle this. sensible population embedded *‚Äùif know you‚Äôre doing‚Äù*. understand. fact, answered question manner speaking. incredibly selfish stupid people across spectrum supporters, acting irrationally rational sense. expecting sort behavior them. could‚Äôve pointed 20 countries Europe worse, that‚Äôs true. Well... let quote article Taiwan surely far, 340,000 people home quarantine, fewer 1,000 fined breaking it. means 99.7% complied, according Chen. **‚ÄúWe sacrificed 14 days 340,000 people exchange normal lives 23 million people,‚Äù Chen said.**

Bold me. calculation really hard understand support? add little thing like everyone could buy masks directly government. Basically every two weeks allowed buy mask ration 9 surgical masks government 52 NTD kept track purchases help national healthcare system. 

Of course recently they're starting lift restrictions allow stores directly sell masks I'll probably still order government website. Move goalposts! initial shut (whichever states fully whichever ones partial) slammed brakes virus, presumably would happen non-lockdown states would look even worse comparison. 

the court public opinion might work likelihood hospitalized COVID increases dramatically age. things also increase dramatically age? America deserves generations treatment they've given French stupid 'surrender' jokes. I'm curious too. another article site AC unit blowing directly group people shows group high infection rate, nobody else room got it. assume way wind blows relation infected person is? Probably something lot control would even know.  Free insurance Connecticut. Fair enough :) grand reason know false? Arrogance virtue. Hahaha always excuse think masks effective law source legitimate morality vast number internal contradictions. law applied said cases, abortion would illegal, people free act choose. Texas Florida voting. I‚Äôm saying people even go eat right now.

I‚Äôm saying idea ‚Äújust sit outside‚Äù isn‚Äôt option everywhere. Well first US would stop pretending Taiwan country. sadly quite hard understand 

you need little familiar biology understand context.

everyone see eyes death rate No, them. half list relatively poor nations. don‚Äôt think doctors nurses much valued executives run hospitals US. Lockdown Florida mutually exclusive going drag next five years it? learn become Salesforce admin free trailhead, sitting exam costs anything it‚Äôs $200. Obviously guarantee you‚Äôll get job probably help. Takes lot resources plan this. point trying it‚Äôs likely cancelled. Thinking Belgium throughout this. Would first country actually fill ICU beds pandemic? Rona DeathSentence following Trump's marching orders. People need know physical limitations. risk...stay home. not. fun. Enjoy sunlight fresh air. one people everybody hates know everything, everything? take lot online IQ tests prove smart are? long epidemiologist? 150 days? graduate r/covid19 ? there‚Äôs one thing limits even unscrupulous criminals, healthcare facilities. Come on... like war criminal behavior Touch√© butt chug. won‚Äôt take mask. literally happening Belgium need every single doctor available treat sick intensive care beds practically maxed out. beds reach capacity US probably seeing doctors work ill. think terms people extra fuel overflowing hospital system fire, makes lot sense. Unfortunately, keeping elderly safe. outbreaks communities, ICUs fill much faster. love even articles impact coronavirus Argentinian media still talks UK ""illegally occupying"" las Islas Malvinas. 10 yrs ago went thru debilitating illness know ever gonna end. also crippling mentally lost hope ever normal activity truly living. dreams dashed. choose one thing day energy had. dishes go short walk. Avoid Covid much none us know affect us first second time. gripe limitations pandemic giving need reflect could griping able walk stairs without heart trouble. you‚Äôre functioning relatively healthy, thankful. Winter coming. strict lockdown would completely eradicated virus. countries weak half-assed 'shutdowns'. Also, multiple countries pushed infection rates practically zero, without strict lockdowns. basic stuff like robust contact tracing, mandatory enforced quarantines contacts (so figure thirty people quarantine every infected person), fines going public without mask on. Paying 0.1% population quarantine turns cheaper paying economy dies. 

Admittedly helps government utterly incompetent failed protocols place pandemic showed up. Elect monkeys, get circus. Fact though, experts knew deal happened. many selfish people unwilling cooperate. Yes. NFL RB Ryquell Armstead I... what... GOT shitting me. trump said covid-19 defeated?? Whaaat? Fauci lying Regeneron applied authorization think they‚Äôre waiting approval

Regarding military thing - think know that‚Äôs it‚Äôs playing out. Realistically I‚Äôd expect use covid drive throughs mode distribution vaccine. clouds, unless clouds dark smelly encourage read actually said intended suggesting I'm ridiculous something even say. people blind ? Cases rising like crazy, enacted lockdown 2 weeks ago keeping schools open cases dropping quickly. seems work. Infections don‚Äôt suddenly drop zero, even harsher lockdown 2021 might actually worse, dare say Keep it! fall down, pick keep going! Ignorance bliss, wish could live like that. However Europe going clear second wave, Dr. Fauci said, US still first one. guess could say lots states still first one, handful might starting second one. think rights government censoring citizens... Ah, cares rights anymore. lmao I've hoping good treatment wait vaccine. people stopped dying recovered quickly country would better place Seems pretty soft course also use bodylanguage. hello wave, sure pain ass repeat. come man take person probaly wants stay home tol gots crazy

also, dont need anti-female cdc guidelines. going go away day election""

I live downtown district city, lots bars restaurants. many closed couldn‚Äôt survive. government actually decent job getting people money too, people don‚Äôt realize much still costs keep small business open.

Anyone sympathy small business owners clearly don‚Äôt know first thing running business. region using British common sense  None rural areas, fridge close empty, found job months looking.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* That's debate, that's temper tantrum. I've honestly confused conflicting information come Covid know believe anymore. amount buzz words tossed around makes head spin.

All know I've lived entire spring summer social isolation (with bi-weekly trips grocery store once-a-month trips Walmart, always masked, using hand sanitizer soap til hands dry) I've returned work limited capacity...

All rest time I've suffering stress anxiety whole thing. I've nights without sleep, I've stomach churn ""no reason"" (i.e. eat new food going restaurants) sometimes I've just... blown family we're feeling cabin pressure.

It's hard, miss old life, one back February. took everything granted everything's changed, maybe good. Grandma ‚Äòbout die alone chair, one change shit-filled Depends 12 hours later. Back 2015, Bill Gates made TED Talk reflecting ebola outbreak, talked global pandemic biggest threat world economy. suggested entire plan course action. one listened today.

On hand, South Korea prepared, littered conspiracy theorist/science deniers. Look are.

Or look New Zealand. People common sense took precautions necessary without baby thinking masks take away rights. literally back life pre covid. get you‚Äôre saying masks used 100 years prevent infectious diseases/viruses. science changed err side caution, especially new strand recommend masks beginning. certainly wouldn‚Äôt made worse name only. Question automod feature: perfectly civil conversation someone day dynamics within Christian church, liberal Christians trying work convince Evangelicals follow stay home orders. criticism political figures, animosity us discussing it, profanity slurs. Yet, got instantly swatted Automod. life me, figure why, since constructive non-argumentative conversation. 

So, exactly get deleted automod general political all? comment removed ""purely political,"" simply understand rules sometimes discourages participating sub quite often. know they're this? right. care anyone personally affected. Selfish way go life. honestly think density major correlation covid cases.

Density really matter people still gather friends family, go grocery shopping without masks. like people Dakotas meeting people. epidemiologist, honestly even take density account covid anymore. see anything Biden's plan herd immunity, editing CDC guidance make less restrictive, confiscating state supplies PPE, ""Masks work? No."", calling head NIH ""disaster"", funding overtime essential workers, enhancing emergency food supplies, eliminating testing asymptomatic people. looking plan?

Here's helpful would assume increased testing probably plays large role that. don‚Äôt think downvoted positive though. never wished someone wrong much now. still hoping cure comes like minute. guess like setting disappointment Last Christmas gave covid, next day, gave away. year, save tears, I'll give someone special. 100% agree. Nice see someone understands game. won‚Äôt trust first big dip. question second. buy 3rd. play time around... unless majority US stays open far long 2nd wave (Germany France right), likely, complicates everything further. time around far many variables, mention vulnerabilities. suggest letting run rampart everywhere?

Yes. Let people decide what's safe isn't. Honestly Trump loses next week, could see huge rally happening. We‚Äôd probably see new peak beyond March like DOW 40k higher. would signal we‚Äôre still viable country, shit hits fan return rationality deal it. BAD LOOK

Yeah still pandemic maybe focus getting dying politicizing whole thing? articles say exact opposite. Humans spread virus, regardless age. least adults older children understand things bit better try follow rules. well 300k Excellent article, excellent illustrations.  lockdown. still get think kids viral bank coronavirus infections. risk death, likely low. risk permanent heart lung damage? one really knows yet. willing risk LiBz? Pretty easy use home delivery store pickup never enter store again. ""MISSION ACCOMPLISHED"" even considered window insulation kit? compromised already. 

I‚Äôm one makes distinction. 

Trusted organizations CDC make distinctions. random people internet. 

So medically distinction matters talking numbers. 

Basically. overweight started dieting months ago would risk zone now. (That even solves diabetes concerns well) 

Some stuff isn‚Äôt simple obviously folks need stay inside harms way. ?  BNO's detailed COVID reinfection tracker whoever wants follow tracker officially includes genomically-confirmed reinfections** (a fairly high bar evidence), also lists *suspected* reinfections (several hundred total Mexico, Brazil, US, etc) timeline below. Pretty sure isn‚Äôt novel related masks. Lmao even mask mandate yet...

I'm saying new leadership cure covid, dems cannot possibly handle worse current admin. honestly feels like Trump *trying* make bad possible. literally went rally debate virus! got ear infection days getting recovering negative results. Post coivd, anyone else? taking antibiotics ibuprofen pain. go away own? experience u recommend? There's also multiple studies showing even limited screen exposure children age 5 harmful, best put cap much screen exposure older children get. really mess perception reality.

South Dakota challenged condition federal funds saying unconstitutional Congress regulate drinking age. relation 21st amendment, allowed states set laws liquor licensing alcohol consumption, Court held Congress enforces minimum drinking age, mean regulates it.

Might well get good bottle whiskey relax.  feel bad man, cares much. Depends look it. Covid wise think things may improve sometime 2021. Several vaccines work phase 3 trials good news regarding vaccines may even get vaccine early next year. Covids going dissappear totally ofcourse hopefully bad right now. I'm expecting brilliant year next year better year. Ofcourse we'll still dealing economic effects pandemic would say ""Good afternoon, I'm going introduce experts here. We're going say."" shut mouth. would done every day, approval ratings would much better would solid chance next week. Christmas cancelled. We'll double next year.

May post-containment; ended US moved mitigation March 8th. Link below. one EVER asked states unified shutdown (which required part strategy states share unregulated land borders.) effective national shutdowns CONTAINMENT strategies...not mitigation. There‚Äôs little reason state adhere ineffective, piecemeal guidelines capacity contain. 

The time ask states participate unified strategy March. never happened. still bidding one another PPE. People say state rights denied ignoring never ask. people saying national shutdown memory issues.

Just view facts this. Appreciate replies, especially Georgia-specific take. apologize happened voting past It'd fair compare place like NY

Edit: NY around 25000 cases per million never want flu, dude.

Also. meant terrible infection counts infection severity. many need keep narrative admit they're wrong least change choose to. Big difference forced that. heart goes you, America. fault, sad happening. hope leaders find better way forward. Dude...

1) Vaccines rushed, quite opposite. understand concern forced take random drugs, vaccines particular **extensively** tested

2) fact mandatory lot countries, included states USA. Usually unvaccinated kids allowed kindergartens, parents fined kid old enough go school. without power, know... free believe scientific community, allow harm people can't defend Lol forced. really done anything? costs amount seven ten billion euros period four weeks

What happens this? still closed one month now.

What happens third lockdown?  Australia pretty desperate high functioning migrants, long don‚Äôt mind 14- hour flight away anywhere nice

They changed migration tests highly value things like speaking English, knowing Aussie culture 

Australian culture basically slightly progressive American culture, without guns, easy enough Yeah, genuinely give minimal fucks anymore. I‚Äôve played rules date, I‚Äôll wear mask sanitize hands benefit people long need to, you‚Äôre going expect go another winter lockdowns returning restrictions the
horizon something poses negligible risk individually governments leadership inept continuously boned response this, fuck right off. 

I‚Äôm honest. I‚Äôm greater good point I‚Äôm punished people didn‚Äôt vote for/hire bad jobs. Another fantastic article [*The Atlantic‚Äôs* Ed 100% worth read articles are. Agreed. won‚Äôt give shit long Oh we've turned corner defeated pandemic. Nothing worry especially starting November 4. #FireTheLiar #DumpTrump2020 #TrumpForPrison2020 #ItIsWhatItis #IWillNotConform #VoteThemAllOut uh... think might joke Can't wait GOP say ""look cases democratic president! much better trump!"" Quebec done announced today ended covid pandemic. Maybe government close businesses let people decide what's safe what's want free market. people never take seriously. think covid cases low area suddenly covid exist bad. mean there's plenty places covid spreading really fast. France example half hospital beds taken covid patients Live Singapore, across 1 km-wide strait Malaysian city Johor Bahru. here, similar situation (although instead dual citizenship, usually permanent residency country). People SG used go JB groceries, entertainment etc. people JB used go SG work, leisure, etc. lot people, actually - around 300,000 per day, ~5% SG's population 45% JB's. Many people SG JB family across border. basically city separated national border.

Of course, pre-COVID. mid-March, infections rose Malaysia. So, locked gave 48 hours' notice would close border, preventing foreigners entering (even Singaporeans), also stopping Malaysians leaving. Then, Singapore locked down. sides advised citizens travel countries even restrictions relaxed. general opening border since.

Not saying Juarez/El Paso this, option. And? far... That's true, they'll refuse costs possible drag many without using force. could possibly funny this? It‚Äôs almost like mayor Juarez pandering political points knowing nothing change. thing San Diego. Tens thousands people live Tijuana go work/school everyday SD. many way around, some. Meanwhile, get every user /r/Conservative patting Trump back ""200k deaths would perfect"" quote, fucking pandemic over. 

These people SO. FUCKING. STUPID. China gone back normal, litterly. huge music festivals, masks. see economic growth year. caused whole covid mess, knew do. government NEEDS cover large part lost income. 

They cover lost income. can't maybe force close. Considering written think need consider perhaps administration actually Pro-Covid. mean data solid what‚Äôs difference going be? Like agency proofreads essay says yep it‚Äôs 60 percent effective whatever Yup. Making oneself risk public health political statement stunning example assholery. Z-500... bounds bingo card. infected deadly virus blaming children. danger family. Damn, Fauci buzzkill?  people care aren‚Äôt seeing effects

Or seeing effects people know got infected get mild case (which likely outcome). takes extra months FDA approve without political interference, that‚Äôs fine me. Go Australia üá¶üá∫! 12.6 million unemployed people stuck home right contact tracing remote job. Hopefully vaccine shortly after? state mask mandate? People contacting local politicians put mandate place, state months now. anyone find image from? It‚Äôs excellent. can‚Äôt find it. people act responsibly compassion around them, yes.

If everyone gave said ""fuck it"" ..... know happen actually bad news. Can‚Äôt say anything covid19 hit miss, look states democratic governors majority open now. seems though New York taking seriously state, I‚Äôm surprised California open cases US. 

Then again, seems like it‚Äôs better option someone commander chief actually takes global pandemic seriously. Agreed, judge people addictions.. know people disowned families, dumped, even addiction used evidence allowed see kids anymore. plenty people feel safe attending meetings Zoom, would rather risk Covid marriage/children. theory, would've used lockdown significantly increase hospital capacity

Yeah good luck building new hospitals training significant number new doctors nurses span month two. Even could *double* current capacity, quod non, let's say can... extra capacity would used exactly 1 week rate currently going. Exponential curve, contract tracing, etc

Contact tracing really work contain virus, slows down, good containment.

The time infection detection long. often week time person gets infected, time contacts traced, notified quarantined. playing catch time, week ample window opportunity virus spread further.

Look, hate lockdown much anyone, realistic: solution without stringent permanent measures periodic lockdowns, preferably well *before* shit hits fan, simply sustainable. let grow, slow first, *will* eventually grow head.

Do remember analogy posted back March [the hammer Well, hammer, dancing use hammer again. Based metric? also quick adapt many ways. switched working home, unaffected. work even efficiently home. traffic. Longer sleep. I'm going back office, even lockdown lifted. higher - possibly 25 days parts US, though seems vary location. We're using reported cases reported deaths, right?

Make slider control that! Dude, that‚Äôs wants feel. brighter day. toss Trump, rebuild heal. reports MLB tried stop going field tried removing well essentially threw tantrum. Manfred sucks sounds like least 2 attempts last night. really depends one really hard hit industries really enjoy using one hard hit industries.

Personally go eat sporting events travel much get go work come home watch TV like pandemic except wear mask, socially distance, wash hands lot none big deal. 

Things amazingly different all. User name checks  good friend today told doesn‚Äôt really care anymore. said ‚ÄúI used take seriously, don‚Äôt care‚Äù. sad reality folks. dont take pregnancy test means youre pregnant

*taps head nods sagely There's need. post. one say paid it. u it. xD don‚Äôt know racist means know, fucks actually stay home? motherfuckers actually stayed home lockdowns would lifted.

Also saw lol. Cases rising 6 weeks i‚Äôm tired immature morons acting like it‚Äôs one side other. You‚Äôre part problem. Technically possible? Sure.

However realistic real world.

The US never accepting kind policy, especially light death rate much lower originally projected. sources? Exactly. plan ""herd immunity"" proposed GBD. would entail protecting segment society. plan nothing pretend exist. Christmas likely worse. 15 people trace single case?!?! US. I've working house cars home, grilling. obese demagogue telling pandemic hoax even virus hospitalized him

Voting matters wonder changes made getting COVID first time, they'll make changes catching twice prevent catching third time. yearn reality every single day. fucking travesty time President great informative coronavirus thread full rational balanced humans /s company new slogan. ‚ÄúWe work better together apart‚Äù. It‚Äôs propaganda statement consistently use get us ‚Äúexcited‚Äù return work even 90% people perfectly effective remote.  Wow, functioning governments, must nice. repeating said before.

Believe see then. No, that's is. 401k collection investments, usually index funds, mutual funds, bonds. pay taxes contributions gains withdraw funds, assuming wait 60s. Withdrawing triggers taxes penalty, whereas withdrawing retirement age results taxes assessed. idea that, retired, income, tax rate considerably lower. nice one, govt power bcos issue currency. rebel go bitcoin! US still firmly ""gonna get worse gets better"" category. Fauci mentions measures needed well 2021, perhaps fully end year. He's said vaccines readily available widespread Spring (March, April). matches approved vaccine January beginning distribution. Measures end vaccine approval. It'll take time, obviously people GET vaccine too. arbitrary round-the-question answer really even answer question. lockdowns people follow arbitrary guidelines.

Which guidelines, people? Everybody masking social distancing, long, where, etc... completely agree saying. one thing feel like people think enough fact life suddenly returned back normal, like life pre-covid, would inevitable spike cases, hospitals would extremely overwhelmed point death rates younger age groups would skyrocket. much care dismissal lives old. We've seen studies showing elderly died virus death beds would average ~10 years life left. plenty young adults children lowered graves well. Far many considering many losses 100% avoidable. Mortality even whole problem. Survivers often younger still finding long term organ damage, cognitive issues, problems impact rest lives GI's returning war often find disabled scarred. think comparison pretty fair hope think many health care workers already died virus contracted work. follow rules guidelines even one else work does. I'm anti-vaxer, hoax kinda person, take vaccine put forth trump adminstration. Kinda disagree anti-maskers hoaxers bit trump's adminstration comes ""vaccine"" I'm kinda sure take it. god-king says good make immune.  Yes county were. don‚Äôt understand want argue random person facts. Jesus get life leave alone! Also note: asking open question.

I think data presenting interesting, particularly telling obvious way. fineable offense? Usually people start wearing risk caught without one $2000. complicated tracking system needed, potential fine. people get fines help fund state local budgets hurting right now. Based investigation Astros, expect much. Eh, get up, go work come home watch tv ever. difference stand people, wear mask hang out.

If Life hanging Entertaining people see big disruption, us essential workers, working home retired. biggest problem really school, restaurant, bars, sporting events travel industry. amazingly large important industries. like fun luxury industries. half measures. need full quarantine spring Let‚Äôs choose 2 3 10 bad  Well average age Covid victim 80's...

Young people reason take seriously. said, everyone know age group (30+) wearing masks we're told to, trying socially distance, etc..., despite extremely low risk well fact bunch us already Covid (I late Feb).

It's hard keep already recovered Covid go grocery store see boomer mask... , idiots without masks keep spreading , keep going big gatherings like churches , nothing churches , require wear masks . got sc justice, split Postal service would biggest spreader virus (if real).. think it. takes one 'sick' person symptoms.. cough touch piece mail (because tell us sticks paper), toss mail box, everything mailbox infected.

That mail hits sorting center mixes rest mail (infecting everything), shuttled across country people's homes grabbing bare hands, touching furniture, eating etc..

Based logic 'bad' virus 'deadly' is, entire country infected 100000x over. People would dropping dead street, people laid up. Hospitals overflowing, hearses far eye see..

What see though? Nobody sick anywhere, doctors nurses sent home work. Ambulance drivers standing outside hospitals hands pockets, hint death anywhere

How know pandemic fake? fact powers seemed forgotten actual biggest spreading threat there.. postal service (whom way, also wear masks gloves). good wear masks, gloves, cower home infected mail delivered daily........ Doesn‚Äôt matter. Still hard-on Sweden. Pretty scant details bub. certainly perpetuating popular Reddit narrative anything China equals bad. 

But us following virus since mid-January. China extremely transparent happening virus including clinical course disease. 

If talking suppressing story initially December perhaps early January might right, frank really think United States would done much better similar situation. 

It really sad people like continue slam China carry Republicans President Trump's water want interpret this. 

It's pretty far removed reality. Although, like said widely accepted really questioned anymore. rollout takes long. know, comfortable consequences, care. predators. Money. one Massachusetts run Water Resources Authority: [http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm](http://www.mwra.com/biobot/biobotdata.htm)

Biobot MA-based company though makes sense it. Ok genuine question. Im anti vaxxer im seriously concerned safety rushed vaccine. problems vaccines much less rushed. dont want shitty person dont want take vaccine til see lol. agree that‚Äôs think continue wear masks practice social distancing. never know minor sickness could another person. think wearing mask long term great example caring fellow human beings. office tired operating normally bringing us in. Yayyyyyy. Also yes, jobs done completely remotely problems. problem bad apples take 30 minutes send one email Enough stimulus bills bail people poor spending habits. Also there's risk hyperinflation. USD devaluing rapidly past 6 months. work sick contact dictates.

There‚Äôs pandemic exemption wife‚Äôs contact, sick days permitted it‚Äôs hospital find subs.

No subs hospital capacity drops. one going martyr US‚Äôs failed response.  can't compare NY deaths time death rate per cases was, every city world, many times higher ever since. would Florida, state unfortunate enough hit early.

That aside, reducing tens thousands deaths 'shitty response' helpful terms letting know interest discussion outside POV. fun that, guess. agree contact tracing key. Feds even manpower hire many people. Feds recommend 5-15 people per case contact trace. today 74,000 cases. That's 370,000 people low end. SHAME SHAME addicts hide addictions loved ones. meetings moved Zoom, stop attending avoid overheard caught families. Others finally tell families truth, always met love support. Relapses, overdoses, domestic violence, divorce, suicides follow this.

It makes sad people like that. ex addict I'm pretty sure lied getting help. would *loved* overhear Zoom meeting.

I'll probably never date addict many problems own, would never end relationship silly thing like self-improvement. History's already proven wrong. Look back Italy initial outbreak, ""cures"" still process formulated implemented. That's things would look like every city town day ""cure"" think much worse.

You think losing job depressing, try losing parents and/or grandparents knowing one infected them. Well getting conflicting messages. Cuz science guy said it‚Äôs over. state. School closed since March. Churches still open. sports kids unless parents pay private. little open. I'd prefer middle ground, personally. want live fully-open unmasked state, wish could keep mask mandate let kids back school part-time least run cross country. sub strange. really, really pessimistic people large, overly optimistic folks peppered well. 

How anyone think good news? Back June July, ""vaccine September."" Then, October. November. Now, December (at absolute best) there's meaningful data had.

At rate, we'll masks, distancing essentially living unsustainably miserable quality life we'll 2022 closer 2023. know socially acceptable say this, might well get back normal let rip, right? can't fast-forward Halloween 2021 still staring barrel masks social distancing measures. can't. want stay home, stay home. Let people make risk/benefit analyses point. I‚Äôll let friend know that. dad died covid last night comfort him. They're childish state ""I told so..."" point they'd risk tragic personal death make look stupid wearing mask. beyond insane. That‚Äôs probably true 96% people die covid pre-existing health issue. Many people gotten covid didn‚Äôt show syptoms, many people got sick day 2 completely fine. people may think virus government control, think people simply look big picture, knows vaccine ever created. think lot people would rather risk dying live inside forever live fear. personally don‚Äôt know proper solution virus is, emphasize people want go life risk dying covid people think economic implications mental health implications locking country forcing people lose businesses could potentially worse forcing everyone socialize, wear masks, etc. look statistics many people die covid see death tragedy don‚Äôt look persons age maybe 80 lived fulfilling life going die soon anyways. ‚ÄúOne death tragedy, one million statistic‚Äù like one death inevitable million inevitable. Czech Republic formal name, Czechia short-name.

Like: United States America, versus USA, US, States, etc. Imagine level douche you‚Äôd write that. Jesus motherfucking Christ. probably wear mask car. Due deficit hawks refusing properly support constituents worst pandemic century. sounds disgusting intriguing. Let‚Äôs it! piece cloth. barely muffles voice. Yeah stuff basically never control unless government starts dishing repercussions breaking mandates. Ya sound cool...but hopes dreams Ferrari? condo sky scraper nyc? lake house Austin boat...a custom designed house too...will able achieve socialism? know sounds childish that‚Äôs drives better pursue challenging jobs.. blue series offset.

The orange series 14 days. Christmas song. whimiscal fantasy. Came say this! ...that's personal decision business deal with.

But irony small minded people always think. truly envision hypothetical placing in, fundamentally believe serious COVID illness affects *other* people- them. Even worse add healthy dose selection bias: *yet* know anyone affected dead COVID, therefore widespread media reported. Put succinctly words Mike Tyson: ""Everybody plan get punched mouth."" applies equally COVID concerned. Yeah, SARS MERS deadly rare (it's deadlier nature, along less asymptomatic spread virulence, kept much spread Covid) wide pool test. whole different ballgame. Covid sits edge, pretty deadly eventually like SARS, coupled long asymptomatic spread periods, high virulence. perfect storm really. I'm concerned 0.02% chance dying, I'm concerned *everybody's* chance dying. sucks grandma's sad *does get* risk nurse's life, nurse's family's life, single person may encounter grocery store. Unlike skiers motorcyclists, one person taking small risk someone else's behalf end one person--it's domino effect currently way stopped, social isolation. 

It sucks old people can't get quality life want, guess what--it's old people, fucking right now. Ah shit, go again.

These numbers close numbers April ramping up. Deaths lower could change moment number folks hospital. I'll add one that, meetings building handled virtual environment. face face meetings allowed. 2% 70% (herd immunity point) US population 4¬Ω million dead. Here‚Äôs link (PDF) [source Vanderbilt study regarding Tennessee findings summarized Axios hospitals least 75% patients subject local mask requirement, COVID hospitalizations level July hospitals fewer 25% patients subject local mask mandate, however, hospitalizations 200% higher July 1 levels tempted call stupid right now, said equivalent of: ""I feeling sick, started getting treatment, felt better stopped treatment back feeling sick. Clearly, treatment work.""

No, dumbass, follow through. get entire course antibiotics, got antibiotic-resistant infection.

Yes, governments incompetent, people stupid. think I'm going take money short commercial real estate companies largest holdings inflated markets. inflated areas crashed last housing crisis expect commercial. I'm torn weather end q4 assuming virus numbers tank markets general close buildings want year companies time run numbers cut leases. Also think pretty likely massive retail closures foot traffic gone excereated shift online buying along fact largest block consumers gonna limited funds. hackers though? hospitals ever pay ransom? target hospitals rather corporations? probably people actually held wedding pay for. news, water wet. Shoot them. bizzare thing saying build bonds supervisors assist technology performance issues. However, prior announcement, supervisors poor performing employees already coming office minimum one day week. They've rolled certification program work home confirmed March. However, thought bringing supervision tell associates WFH program finished supervisor responsible maintaining morale. Looking data reported looks early tell trend right now. could peaked slight dip reported cases could blip. Check back week. real number daily deaths including large carryover another day? US celebrating President said beat COVID-19. FORWARD! Maybe that‚Äôs French strict fast it? try convince people ‚Äúrestrictions work‚Äù usher winter people COVID conscious again.

Seems like risky strategy. hard time believing political climate Europe fantastic right now. feel like it‚Äôs far what‚Äôs happening America. 

I think thing worse lockdown lockdown everyone vehemently against. really hope either goes prison leaves country. I'm deplatforming guy threat America. new wave mccarthyism absolutely destroying what's left unity Americans. interventions whatsoever... hey let‚Äôs let context get way here. think depends region honest. believe midwest/rust belt right getting ravaged mask wearing low general getting everywhere multiple vectors.

Places like northeast (i'm northern NJ) mask wearing public high, honestly like 95%+ go out. fatigue sure lot indoor private gatherings people think Covid longer cares transmission happening. Add onto kids school gluck getting kids comply masking, become transmission vectors unsuspecting adults family units private gatherings go. Probably automodded keywords. There's actually way know whether OP presents them. Even innocuous posts deleted no-no words. True, food vector transmission ruled out.

It may, may happen.

There conclusive studies topic.

Until are, assuming infection impossible food assumption make peril. advised masks first would shortage need front line workers. death rate near 2.6%, know that, everyone else knows too. Stop trolling. Joe office 47 years.... Trump 3 sad part is, actual number deaths known years. Seems like many parts accurately reporting counts, intentionally working keep numbers paper. Trump absolutely declare victory regardless what‚Äôs actually happening. fact likely won‚Äôt real result make easier so. absolutely expect it. 

I mean claimed pandemic midst huge uptick cases would rejection reality end morning November 3?  reason across board lockdown needs done today cases high. past point half assing expect type result.

Not literally thing could blamed for. literally ignored points like makes sense. doesn't, dispute choose ignore instead.

He can't control Americans obese that's reason lockdown. population danger country. Tbf think whole world blind sided sure first. brand new never studied strain SARS 2 caused COVID *really* weird one, too. follow normal rules. lot trial error done first nobody knew wtf going on. Considering fact think countries list fairly well.   Hey research covid death count going globally.

Edit  I've embarrassed American ever since November 2016.

We deserve this. think administration bungled response terribly reason, let's totally fair. 

The CDC estimate (best case) 200k (worst case) 1.7MM deaths 2020. Even accounting fact entities like CDC always skew toward erring side caution, going end year WAY closer best case scenario.

Had Trump fucking idiot pushed governors people circle wear masks distance, could probably brag deaths CDC's best case scenario 200k. That‚Äôs desperate shove load SC Empathy ??It's long gone.

If younger generation followed guidelines here.Who knew narrative ""virus kill young people"" party much would consequences ways. 


LEL: Downvoting change truth. agree President 100% China‚Äôs fault (CCP) held responsible. lack effort trying control infections disgusting. hard encourage people wear masks. would help airborne illnesses.

I hope get control soon give China disciplinary action deserve. RemindMe! 7 days  Wow, that‚Äôs wild. virus enigma. I‚Äôm glad mild, hope she‚Äôs better! ? thing - likely never herd immunity COVID.

If isn't, die. 

It would better get using vaccines &amp; generally careful things. 

But binary nature ""debate"" beyond infuriating. Watch. year two now, still see people flashing mask selfies Instagram kill little precious time. sad 6+ months thing remotely PPE issue solved. even medical professionals let alone general public.

It sad one seems care anymore. going increasingly difficult virus find new people infect certain point.

It seem like we're close point. Peru's flu season May October they've strict lockdown measures. see they're approaching herd immunity. unfortunately ICUs fill up


That's we'll see states shutting again. likely horizon lot states. right ‚Äúor get herd immunity, probably would mean deaths millions.‚Äù

There herd immunity without vaccine. millions deaths. 

The good news though: vaccines! Trustworthy experts hopeful efficacy. wider public US access spring. Things much better soon. Winter proverbial ‚ÄúDarkest dawn,‚Äù get this.

The term want Google ""Excess deaths"". understand there's significant spike deaths yearly average, COVID-19 unrelated causes. Yes, stated primary reason press conference Exactly, like doctor tells ""turn head cough."" virus caravan Fox News undoubtedly fits definition propaganda. Wither specifically fascist propaganda might debate. I'd consider fascist propaganda thier propaganda generally flavor far right ideals. couple questions article. 

- article specify type mask used model?

- determine infectious dose is? knew saying wrong. admitted fact. explain reached figure? possible scenario people take drink.

&lt;laughs Brett crazy logic founded reality. Yes media bias assuming it‚Äôs going make Covid disappear 


I say disappear absolutely cover different. shape public perception someone like shape narrative differently. 

This rely numbers instead media hype. Hopefully, enough people recognize politicians prioritize oil affected virus vote out. Nope It‚Äôs coming SD first?? Uh sure he? speaks truth. one without mitigations. everyone wore Tshirt nose mouth, would help maybe little.

If everyone wore surgical mask, would help lot more.

If everyone wore N95 KF94 respirator, think would eventually beat covid masks alone.

Even takeaway group policies effective vs mask mandates alone, saying ""see things can't know SURE stupid cloth masks work"" instead saying ""yes choose things help reduce transmission covid? ""the dow"" thing matters people? O.o dont get you‚Äôre ugly agree. think people countries would automatically wear masks without mask mandates recommendations? assure wear mask either living Sweden.

So much Sweden's ""consistent approach"". Fine, he's incredible damage doom warnings social distancing masks continue even vaccine rolled out. ok, want hear read skip :) Please posts links use link shorteners/re-routers obscure true destination link.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  i'm amazed comment still standing.

have upvote bet that. Doctors scientists predict major strains develop years vaccine there.

You admit better route asking anyone sick cough you. Fauci relying human empathy. appealing reason. Right control implementation public policy short either empathy reason discarded best advice scientific inquiry Fauci tasked supplying guidance. Yeah, ok. Swedes culturally inherited idiocy hate masks that's wear them. Meanwhile, everyone else wears masks internet, recommended mandated to. Coincidentally Sweden Western country without mask recommendations again, nothing it. I'm middle aged, I'm worried dying COVID (should catch it) scared fuck ending w/ chronic symptoms. Thousands /r/COVID19Positive report things like brain Fog, heart/lung damage, fatigue, loss/warping sense Taste &amp; Smell continue long-term(permanent?). know virus attacks via receptors unlike others (ACE2 example) . many people think ""recovered"" means good prior 

These symptoms consistent SARS infection well. people 2003 still recovered considered long term disabled. Lol it‚Äôs pretty great actually. Well one person bragged felt 20 years younger. Taiwan‚Äôs lack spread little mask wearing, almost everything shutting flights early making returning citizens quarantine 14 days. didn‚Äôt believe China early paid off. However, must remain closed there‚Äôs vaccine. Maybe media biased America could tackled smarter like Sweden something? politicized harder time handling since people skeptical them. could contained exactly? Europe experiencing 100,000 new cases day minimum supposedly contained well fuck basement dwellers ever target banks credit card companies routinely rake us coals. fuckin siphon money cayman's shit rather holding hospitals hostage global pandemic. 

Scumbags. don‚Äôt understand anyone could defend statements look way. flagrantly negligent gets pass giving people false impression even began earnest?

How supporters rationalize this? ‚ÄúHe says dumb shit times, what?‚Äù good enough. Anyone would fucking *crucified* making assertion President, it‚Äôs getting ridiculous. 

And act like even fake news, despite hearing President‚Äôs mouth national television ears. Unless course they‚Äôre suggesting things actually says fake news, case I‚Äôd agree.

Shameful. atheist don‚Äôt believe heaven hell view social construct help lend weight ‚Äúgood‚Äù ‚Äúbad‚Äù behaviors, actually thing ‚Äúhell,‚Äù don‚Äôt see he‚Äôs done anything stamp ticket supposed fiery depths. Ironic supporters generally Christian base...

As aside, though I‚Äôm expert, thought root Christianity helping other? Whatever happened that? worse flanders first wave, worse wallonia brussels moment sucks everywhere. Asian countries might well exist minds. really work suspicion reasons. First all, Pfizer/Biontech still lead far tell, there's FDA still use AstraZeneca's data countries, front-running vaccines, AstraZeneca one invested US beginning, like 1/3 funding Oxford's vaccine came US. Also say
 wants produce 100s millions doses vaccine started phase 3 trials. 
  
When start Phase 3, started around day Pfizer. every vaccine producing 100s millions doses advance. ones Warp Speed, basically around world. spiral new. Hospitals favorite target since lack access medical info mean loss lives. guy article still going partying, according Facebook page. still hasn‚Äôt learned anything. would cautious elevator even past first wave. like every increase first wave new states get pummeled. Still chance. government much power. government recommend, cannot force individual states shut down. try withhold aid funds general found unconstitutional past. However simply providing aid states shut better current state.  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs black white. definitely depends aware you‚Äôre spreading dangerous false information could kill millions? fair...he didn‚Äôt say April meant. Odds looking good April 2022. Great, get relaxed. 
There various scary long-term organ brain damages caused virus. How? wear masks people. ""just""; _Also_. forget enacting war powers get manufacturing, ventilators, hospital ships NY California didn‚Äôt even need?

All flu virus fatal .0003% population. give election Trump they'd also giving Senate Republicans. means impeachment. Hope best, assume worst. people jerking doom porn might off-putting they‚Äôre ones exacerbating problem Exactly like currently done alcohol.

The feds use carrot rather stick gain compliance. point, herd immunity may end unavoidable destination we're heading involuntarily. 

This belief way back February looking infectiousness transmittal rate. never going eradicate something infectious, started patient zero look now. new patient zero otherwise ""safe open"" community restart fire again. really preventable realistic practical way. feel like Patty talking Laurie disappearances. sense impending doom I've life right time! going get worse. cannot find gif still scene Leftovers. prescient, now. look European States EU since mostly open borders summer &amp; realize never got reprieve. large European countries basically went whole summer daily case numbers low hundreds. completely different case America big states like Texas, Arizona, California, Ohio, never got numbers thousands long periods time summer. NY really exception bc actually took shit seriously brutal spring. know virus spike well 100K day, given ridiculous spike France experienced (52K, population adjusted would 250K here), possible. old, vulnerable vaccinated, what's justification continued measures? lost last grandparent weekend yesterday parents tested positive. 

It's rough year. Wish people would wear fucking masks. downplaying 200,000+ deaths speaking like cartoon boomer I‚Äôm confused

Are you? keep asking thesame thing every thread, get explained you, next day play ignorant again. Yeah, reinfections don‚Äôt happen by-and-large way. We‚Äôre going hit herd immunity way vaccine gets developed. gets second term many gonna mad. Glad got popcorn üçø Good luck. cops right barely enforcing non violent crimes. Covid makes hard lock bunch people cages. Hoping Biden mask mandate right inauguration speech.

He authority that. first said would backed claim changed encourage people wear masks. use kn95s fda emergency use list bonafide. Behealthyusa good reputable source kf94s Yes. Let's silly. Comparing US France extremely difficult really helpful. France smaller Texas twice population along different population density distribution space well multiple borders different countries high movement neighbours lot world due popular tourist destination. 

I'm saying one country better see competition find comparisons generally unhelpful almost always leads pointless repeated discussion. Pretty much everywhere Europe Americas need lot better doing. Swedish Public Health Agency said 3254 cases confirmed past 24 hours, new record since onset country 10.3 million registered roughly 121,100 infections 5934 coronavirus-related deaths total. nuts, considering bad back March(?) state won‚Äôt listen (officials sheriffs included)

Grow spine punish them. basically zero chance reach 500k daily US. 

130-140k probably absolute peak see enough places imposing localized shutdowns drive numbers. Ah, half million time new year.

I find interesting friend thinks caught virus. 

He said even though everyone wears mask work floor, nobody break room. Everybody takes bathroom. 

Also, asked wife last week (she works real estate agent), fellow employees wear masks? 

She told me, ""Only clients come in."". cannot stress enough little seem understand immune system. Again, cell immunity protective immunity. linked 35 years data showing reinfection common seasonal coronaviruses. 

For SARS-CoV-2, recent studies commented (and also replied comment), suggest actually read papers. individuals develop neutralizing antibody response peak. 51-55 days post onset, 25% samples tested detectable neutralizing antibodies. study, 10% individuals detectable levels neutralizing antibodies 40 days 7 months infection. 

Go ahead link earth shattering studies. do, get misinformation lack basic understanding immune system response infections. Ok, get work lay argument it. can't phone. hours now. many people actually wants tragedy bigger, get mad see US much better europe. even USA certainly good reference have, even though needs taken account USA big country regions dont peak time Fake news spreads much faster real news.

It much harder change somebody's perception things exposed fake information. Tell South Dakota read getting couple weeks Lol page 15 16, there's maps cases growth percentage absolute values. provinces bergamo brescia, worst hit first wave, show little cases almost hospitalizations.

Herd immunity thing (otherwise vaccine would pointless start with). orders magnitudes less cost retarded politicians forcing us. inb4  lingering effects?

if brain permanent fog, heart rate breathing difficult months after, government going pay disability? Everybody exaggerated. 

Media, politicians, vaccine companies, etc.


Get ready November turn ""Well really hopeful December get EUA"". ""hopefully right New Years"". still matter. We're also testing like 1.5-2X people WI still see packed bars restaurants MN every time drive around, lot people go board WI drink party, drive right back here. el paso roll back, Idaho sending people washington portland, health advisor illinois announced numbers broke tears. french person, people reacting lockdown there? Italy riots major cities, tell big part population restrictions. LOL. one going force masks, everyone follow rules. people suck, one force shit. Protect cunt. drive Parkland John Peter Smith. paid county tax support people, get badmouth us 9 months straight sneak rob us beds.

In fact, go drive WH ask yoru dear leader bed instead. I'm sure going get downvoted, honestly truth. vaccine happen effective, can't keep locking 10 years. feel like winter pretty much it. I'm old enough remember everyone certain Remdesivir gold standard savior humanity. telling scientists disagreements among data conflicting? SHOCKING news. Okay, would need newly appropriated relief funding, would require act congress.

Part Supreme Court's Republican activism last decade ruled unconstitutional retroactively place conditions funding that's historically required conditions. UK prepping Monday....possibly. interesting see goes. No, literally simple yes question.

It's question requires nuanced answer. big country lot different things going on. one size fits answer work; typically, government policy, one size fits huge challenge implement properly. random gaps agree virus worth this. 

Believe me, know. voting party essentially wants one party state. excited cut nose spite vote end restrictions right now, open right now, stop masks right now. Literally end every single restriction. That's GOP.

Fuck everyone who's you, right? virus practically hoax

This blatant flagrant lying, even tests even reliable, deaths obviously padded

Depends test get. like watching people zero background science pretend understand it, really obvious understand science/virology/epidemiology work capacity.

From link: ‚ÄúIt important understand testing ‚Äì even rapid testing ‚Äì substitute preventative actions,‚Äù Ehresmann said. ‚ÄúTests false positives negatives, people develop illness tested. Even continue expand testing capacity Minnesota, people still need continue socially distance, wear masks, avoid crowds, wash hands stay home sick.‚Äù

This website virus equivalent Loose Change videos. bunch lazy fear-mongering ifs. credit, site admin nice job single page design Even then, low number total cases reported Taiwan, finding dozen people shedding dead virus flight 70-some would extraordinary. beggars belief, really. talking US case already happened least didn‚Äôt get Covid /s sad reality gonna happen, matter many.

Republicans + Trump admin completely shut hope stimulus/aid, almost certainly going get obliterated election. Trump's also going burn everything way out, even peaceful transition power all, still expect stimulus/aid end January least. people already dire position gonna rough 3 months so. compare 1918 pandemic. one went away eventually, took 2 years ~50 million deaths. Either way, anyone pushing herd immunity path forward fool. April 2022 clarified, ventilation HVAC system windows open. Anger resentment pretty powerful motivators. Old people minorities dying highest rates. old people care, they're seeing lot spread minority neighborhoods makes happy, also they're nearing end life anyway. minorities care (don't fight this) online messaging mostly killing old people stand way political economic interests. Many others care dislike least one two groups.

It makes sense twisted way. hate entire groups people way, I'm trying imagine I'd feel someone harbor resentment toward pain/danger dead. I'd feel satisfied, vindictive, maybe even amused. personally cause suffering, I'd gladly stand let happen. honestly (maybe trauma talking) opportunity save innocent person suffering, I'd save person want suffer along them, it. believed old people black people whomever wronged somehow? I'm pretty sure I'd willing sacrifice innocent people watch suffer.

It's cruel I'm saying, see attitude time time throughout human history. people are. right, would say direction. numbers likely somewhat inflated, states counting [gunshot deaths covid things like [counting babies death covid death mother went premature labor may may caused 

That said, probably better inflate numbers safe side, still somewhat misleading. still don‚Äôt consider long term effects central nervous system lungs True but..how Taliban truce? ^(/s) much deeper that

Contact tracing labourous, done semi-skilled individuals (you take course it) definition ""big government"" them. start pandemic predicted USA would need millions contact tracers. Seemed brainier everyone needed job could get one get help goes beliefs small government. Every single political bone bodies leads make incorrect decisions pandemic. way could accepted heavy handed government measures characterization COVID ""war"". ""war"" whatever need including mass mobilization whole economy. However current administration also anti-war point money reason go war.

Contact tracing getting government pry with, also definition ""deep state"" people. would never it, goes everything believe right true good. think can. Im tempted everyday wear them. wish means stay home.  sad say virus came visual facial lesions, think everyone would take serious. Germany acting pretty soon. 15.000 cases low positivity rate 5% ICU capacity best world far reached. government intelligent enough shutdown early shit hits fan. corners way round recommend sticking one source. JHU, Harvard, Mayo Clinic, CDC, NEJM trustworthy Omg nursing homes disaster really terrible time Aus COVID running Mandatory mask wearing, shutdowns non-essential businesses, streamlining contact tracing methods limiting travel somehow something island nations do? Maybe completely, sincerely doubt they‚Äôre fudging numbers much. citizens accustomed already willing wear masks... also locked incredibly hard. people quarantining literally locked apartments. cue hannity

""holy shit guys know 200 *thousand* plus americans dead covid?"" Oh, still restrictions sports somewhere? 

I've serving football games every day months now. Hi Kiwis, Australian shooter here. They've telling viewers guns banned country 20 years. seem give fuck make stuff agenda. Sinovac Sinopharm vaccines (China) seems working (first start Phase 3 trials, hints officials locations trials indicate data good), China already offer domestically high-risk people since July.

Those inactivated vaccines, would likely first enter widespread use world.

Sputnik V (Russia) Phase 3 trials, offered medical workers already, enough data real-world efficacy yet. Also troubled production scale problems, produced doses going straight use.

CanSino vaccine (China) first emergency authorization use China, got hit delayed Phase 3 trials, expects results January 2021. said rich person? I‚Äôm living reduced salary company probably going business next 6 months. I‚Äôm supporting family make like everyone else. condescending tone infuriating really check don‚Äôt even know you‚Äôre talking about. Like said, approach obviously comes huge flaw. 

Of course I‚Äôd also point one test also comes clear flaw even everyone results back. Less flaw still hardly foolproof. 

Then again, assuming travelers bad people see land likely tests good also flaw... it‚Äôs risky around good reasons travel stick masks group even usual.

But airlines don‚Äôt make enforce entry rules, states do. Perhaps airlines (which IME good mask rules) get rapid test process excess death rate upwards 300k, way Covid death rate. People need work pay bills getting tested, mass testing measures taken. anti-mask lunatics everywhere, can't seem grasp covering facial air holes prevent air viruses flooding poorly ventilated area.

edit: Also, take several days test positive infection. One reasons virus spreads fast spread days getting high enough viral load become visibly ill, ever present symptoms. spreads mostly people think sniffles allergies. w it/k? 14 days chaos everywhere don¬¥t act tomorrow headline saying ‚Äúantibodies don‚Äôt last long‚Äù We're seeing thing RI - really well begin, broke case record April last week positivity rate roof. governor supposed add new restrictions tomorrow first time since moving third phase reopening (most businesses open, 15 people social gatherings) back July. That's good question. point fingers all. New versions going crop up. like anyone creating nefarious actions. Time play game governors fault Trumps? always cracks people say ""most people smart"". Without fail always include ""smart"" category somehow removed human condition result believed personal brilliance. seem one thoose ""Sweden second wave"" people.

Did look graph countries actually second wave compare?

See diffrence? deja vous angry mask mandates Taiwan? recall that... start, people suggested saving PPE healthcare/front line workers production lines could produce enough everyone, recall anyone ""very angry"" wearing masks domestic supply stabilized. Biden president hotel. get new flu shot every year, so... Claim know cars watched YouTube videos thinking?! heard? testing means cases!!!

Seriously though, phenomenal, best luck there. organization hit ransomware years ago aggressively invested cybersecurity, huge liability would affect patient care. news healthcare organizations. yeah April 2025 Factor population growth factors Presidents control (extreme obesity rise) isnt really much worse. There's little reason mention economy stock market sentence, except say often unrelated. might well compare car's speedometer radio volume. might turn drive faster, might not. Careful step big pile sarcasm. 

I never said eradicated, comment im responding says disappeared though so... yeah. Get smarter please. they‚Äôre scared might permanent. fail get control vaccine, eventually everyone going get regardless. point, there‚Äôs point keeping restrictions going. least US, anyone tries keep restrictions place likely voted out. like 4,000 deaths/day 

I mean come on! assume it‚Äôs people foreign governments looking destabilize America. make ransom doesn‚Äôt look suspicious. people attacked hospitals clear financial incentive pandemic would obviously assume foreign entities. ask money could anyone. Stupid question yet I'm curious.... COVID infected person farts. get infected breathing fart?  Thank you! People fucking panic buying toilet paper time. course wanted protect supply frontline workers. guys pathetic capacity context. delivery! 

:) way could true immunity.

Because basic logic.

If x% population immune thats x percent population can't get it, protect spread.

Those form natural fire break. Making it... Easier.

But seem think Tegnell saying easier somehow means Sweden spread. whenever nutbag gets going ""My Freedum""

I agree, encourage spend time Bar, singing Ayn Rand song spend time church choir chanting prayer Von Mises. killed 100,000 Americans, currently we're 220,000 deaths. no, worse. media subsist definitely biased, yes.

I agree media biased. boy gonna lose next week. Look forward seeing freak reality finally sets in.

Okay think should. WTF?

500k dead end Feb literally 4,160 deaths/day every single day till then

lets get hold reality okay? simply absurd gonna happen Lol wouldn‚Äôt strip title that. Astros caught cheating year world series didn‚Äôt get title stripped. Fuck, even say this?! never even thought refusing believe election results loses. could refuse leave make giant scene Did.. dredge post history one instance actually talked Jenkins? reaching hard adhominem now. I'm taking further, trolling digging post history point. obviously want cover ears scream go ahead. Found Fox ""news"" huffer! father law needed icu couldn‚Äôt find bed Wisconsin. brought Duluth, Minnesota. 

He nursing home Upper Michigan. taking precautions like masks chin. 

Over face time talked covid door wide open lady wheelchair rolled oxygen. Obviously home‚Äôs strict protections led severe outbreak staff residents. 

Now he‚Äôs ventilator wait good news possible.

Take care loved ones Hey, me. I‚Äôm spending way, way less food, clothes, transportation, entertainment, vacations, hair cuts, etc. adds damn fast. debts, rainy day savings account gets little bigger every two weeks rest ultimately goes stock market one way, shape form. Agreed, one thing never give Prague. always stuck Prague's kooky cousin, Bratislava. life. would wear body cam
And name badge. Fucks ADE? Thank you!! see questions links insults

The ""this sub hive mind"" bit insult, since btfo asked you.

You know goddamn thing me, kid.

Are unsubscribing continuing shout truth power? Short term thinking best. fed passed help, states rushed buy early little really stock let alone encourage continue production first wave (of worrying) over. 

7+ months build, add hospital resources entire bet restrictions enough. Ugh suggestions bullshit. ""no evidence"" crowd twists mean safe. Riddle this, wash hands? accomplish? prevent putting contaminated hands mouth? Putting contaminated hands mouth bad....but putting contaminated food directly mouth somehow magically ok? Think it. primary medium aerosols, risk food exists. want people stop getting takeout. economics, public health. 

If can't boil it, I'm eating it. Pretty sure recent studies related gargling concerned output rather input: Eating much safe Covid-positive person exhaling coughing.

While seems might good effect gargling gargler, mostly it‚Äôs cut transmission gargler others. don‚Äôt think truly realizes little average American cares anyone apart themselves. maybe won‚Äôt acknowledge it. Maybe realization he‚Äôs wasted life working tirelessly good nation proudly ignorant, aggressively stupid narcissists would make put gun mouth. alot psychological damage could fixed better readily available mental health, less financial stress via programs systems people actually need help.

None ever going happen. figured things out.

They know implement programs. give shit American people. Like said, none ever going happen. one going get financial help. one going access mental health care unless rich good insurance. Last time said got downvoted oblivion ... high end assumption based worst case scenario given action taken. low end assumption 200k.

Context matters. quote you, yeah we're still first. definition waves requires between-surge period community spread drops zero *very* close zero. never happened US. We've basically gone stayed since beginning failed response pandemic. countries better did, got spread back close zero, got enjoy period things went back pretty close normal weeks couple months (depending country) cases started surge again. behind us arguing straw man.

Vaccine development bad idea.

Expecting vaccine created record time salvation offering apocalypse Plan B disastrous idea.

This akin using lottery tickets gambling trips Vegas plan retirement.  vaccine least likely option succeed.

Medical treatments improving continue improve. realistic paths achieving results. much could done. one wants second lockdown, masks already mandatory states gatherings large groups mostly forbidden. terrified would situation like place. messaging 30 days [**2020-11-28 15:47:48 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2020-11-28%2015:47:48%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

In theory, nationwide shutdown two weeks would put massive dent virus spread, can't even get Cletus southern racist middle school education wear mask public. There's literally way could pull off, country, even wanted to, would vaccine long could ever agree plan. 

It's pretty pathetic. they‚Äôre somehow responsible saving us I‚Äôm OK that. expect profit, I‚Äôd honestly prefer profit from, say, jacking price $20 medication $700.  Yea frustrating see people New Zealand whatever want competent leadership got rid virus months ago.

Yet here, even go park one wears masks, cases rise. Last time went two weeks ago, skinny section trail, guy walked without mask asked give us space since high risk, douche it. replied ""nope"" request walked even closer next us.

Fuck country worthless motherfuckers share with. **""Vaccines work""**

This stupid dangerous statement. Vaccines *might work* moment show every indication least somewhat effective. never economic incentive spend tens billions developing vaccine common cold.

My prediction: strategy fail meant *next* april obvs.  Wonder write snarky public letter closing California are. CDC data shows number \~310,000 right now. tally's JHU WM 75-80k shy excess death numbers. grim estimate 1-2 million. Birx said 200,000 everything right. go ahead move goal posts.  said people wear masks asymptomatic people drive epidemics. neurological issues common don‚Äôt know permanent, virus around 10 months let‚Äôs jump conclusions. Tom Hanks coat fortune. better understanding treat virus lowered death rates. Understandable bit learning curve. deaths still going skyrocket coming months due sheer number patients limited capacity.  Try use mind imagine adds economic devastation highly volatile situation markets worldwide national debt sitting 27 trillion artificially propped huge infusion fiat currency backed ...wait it
..more debt.

Your pain amd suffering begun precious. He's done fine theres much else could done. That's great I'm happy them. things right like SK.

I wish lived there. Amazing country. 

My question, though is, what's random positive cases people leaving Taiwan? Every often see headlines Japanese nationality people landing testing positive coronavirus direct flight Taiwan. possible?

Infection plane can't fast...where coming from? millions people around world would love see last Donald J Trump, agreed, likely worldwide conspiracy. mean, need use expensive test program. Slovakia afford it, California. record, disagree overall goals, resent use extended lockdown measures achieve them.

And second point, he's saying mask wearing *and* distancing. Mask wearing minor disruption, consideration distancing return normal. 

I feel needs explain exactly means. case 'hey, give couple months enough people it' that's understandable, case 'the world changed, there'll return pre-pandemic way life' yeah, that's insane/evil. hadn‚Äôt fucked things February, March, April...we would be.  US tests done per week ever before. handful hotspot states shortages moment. Even model countries list limited runway. slow virus public health interventions, way infectious go way SARS MERS essentially die proper contact tracing. Right now, 500,000 daily cases world.

It's also unwise rely virus somehow going way highly seasonal Spanish Flu disappeared 2 years without proven explanation.

What we've got virus likely go away own, costs global economy 500Bn per month, 11 candidates phase 3 produce antibodies awaiting human challenge data.

As much dislike Trump, anything supports vaccine race useful human enterprise, see realistic way COVID without vaccinating 5+ Billion people. I've spent hundreds hours building research body vaccines development deployment logistica; happy share done. making accusation Russian military literally killing American people. I'm sorry request proof goes beyond linking 3 articles infamous phrases trigger words little inconvenient serious issue. seen evidence, eyes, Russian government killing American people, please call CIA asap report them. media neutral arbiter sorry UK announced same: shut whole country came You‚Äôre way skis this. statement isn‚Äôt yet supported science, there‚Äôs evidence far view. Well simply capacity patients hospital available ICU near doctors nurses helps. UK time 11000 beds 60m pop worse prepared germany 40000beds 84m pop. bed alone help? No. full capacity enough staff provide intensive care? Unfortunately probably not. havin patients ready use ICU bed hospital better bed home. bed alone doesnt anything specially equipped ICU beds make intensive care quickly accessible soon medical staff around eventually. total capacity well accounted better preparedness comparison Hopefully so. I‚Äôm already worried next virus be. neighbor Czech Republic currently largest number deaths per week per capita world. Slovakia expected join soon.  Lol haven‚Äôt even million deaths worldwide. That‚Äôs indicator Trump‚Äôs competence. He‚Äôs fucking stupid totally unable lead country throughout crisis. could worn mask every press conference, given speech urging people responsible think others. could expressed sympathy. could done help poor lower middle class people deal economic catastrophe. could supported various governors instead threatening playing favorites.

He could done whole lot more. mean, choice - get tested isolate. Seems reasonable. allow healthcare system get overrun, expect increase mortality rate. 1% May actually low. Shocker, based expertly South Dakota responded /s haven‚Äôt reported results doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt them: **tons** results. seen positive. appears going quite well. ü§û run eyes pick nose food. Unless fetish. gonna kink shame ...

Eyes mucus membranes. excuse give literally want try anything fix problem.  Ok done? listed specific things worked countries, done? God I'm sick batshit leftists saying done. understanding they're basically waiting enough people trial catch COVID (or test positive, whatever). gut tells vaccine effective they'd hit threshold already. hopefully going slow virtually none vaccinated volunteers caught that's holding back getting X number overall volunteers who've it. think virus going away minimum July next year, let preface that. far fetched though people would believe media coverage deaths would decline major change power. legitimate possibility, coverage, least, seemed ramp closer closer election. Going felt like 1 article day 6 7 headliners day... say ""brainwash"" American majority TIRED hearing everyday apparently somehow WORSE yesterday. brainwash, yes virus still, less media. Americans happier come November 4th, likely January 20th big headlines politically motivated either side. [150 million people developing world plunged extreme poverty end next direct result policies economic destruction developed world. * *2023 I'm misunderstanding. misrepresenting it.

Unhinged lot conservatives take seriously

Republicans deny pandemic party line oppose mitigating really conservative Republican.


Yes supported 90% republicans prison reform capping insulin costs


Teump done neither things fact pushed racist policies guttin peoples healthcare/protecrions preexisting also scientific consensus.

Yes scientific consensus mitigating saying masks pointless

Jesus lie

Not that, republicans still oppose masks can't say anything related science sure go data given. Innocent proven guilty Wow, found literal nazi. ""Freedom"" work well times ""good"", huh?

JFC upvotes? people mindless sheep. live Tegnell plus FHM (public health department) adamant start isn‚Äôt. also advantage hearing statements original language without translators intermediary put bias twist it.

In essence sweden wants avoid heavy handed restrictions ensure people adhere ones exist many years necessary. It‚Äôs finding balance. Also FHM covid alone it‚Äôs public health whole, mental health, domestic violence etc always considered well deciding policy.

Tegnell said regards to
Immunity result especially bad spread spring models expect less beating amount immunity hinder spread. wasn‚Äôt goal fact situation eviction moratorium doesn‚Äôt mean don‚Äôt pay rent, it‚Äôs letting anyone hook. Everyone utilizing moratorium owe back rent well fees top January current moratorium expires. it‚Äôs really anything hitting pause button. sure lot unhappy landlords, enough make zeitgeist way masks are. theory. people denying exists, going insane anti mask stuff all, covid 19 effected brains makes unable think critically. lol It‚Äôs coming Former xray tech here. confirm. Everything said would happen. Xrays CT would borderline useless relying house docs read it. Hopefully radiologist site! assume study filled Brazil, South Africa UK pause, know sure. rate, even paused studies least partially filled. I'm also surprised started releasing results leaked manner. would rather starve eating rats, bats snakes.

Basic science, creatures vermins carry diseases. Basically hard Wuhan government. 

Every government's basic instinct hug industrialists make sure people panic pandemic...which movie Contagion predicted...there's resistance kind initiative contain 

""We flu"" 

There's people can't muster courage anything population seen firsthand carnage.

Netherlands one restrictive testing requirements continent. test asymptomatic people inevitably spread it. Fauci recommend googles. think find searching sub. going learn live thing. Period. People need accept that.

sub nutshell lol 225 000 covid-19 deaths, sepp. even close cartel killings gringo weapons. interesting. worse second time, means even cell little virus. didn‚Äôt quite understand bit one type vaccine would suitable other. Could someone knowledge expand this? long type helps, it‚Äôs ok..I hope..  believe I've got oceanfront property middle Utah sell you. novel H1N1 strain pandemic ten years ago still circulating today, strain 1968 pandemic 1918 pandemic.

Covid-19 continue circulate eventually everyone level immunity it. Whether takes year decade remains seen. confident that, regardless timeline, people going return ‚Äútrue‚Äù normal end CY21. cashed huge Czech Wtf talking about? going months dominant mutation world changed grand total **once**. seeing health important part immune system probably good idea stop people working out.

not mention outside better stuck indoors. Yeah please enlighten me. BS put President. country club pals CEO I'm sure saying favor election. could come month, could come next month, could come next year, could come all. You‚Äôre absolute lunatic Thanks! :) Add wife list.

But kids insurance pay test 5 days person exposed tested positive, despite living household. they'll pay one test per calendar year covered individual. died cuz half measures. killed walt. knew going happen left. Wrong. Trump bad Yeah let's pretend number lives fall 1% control. ""A large group people blame government rain. friends might part group."" guy, theres big difference cloudy weather cannot control government keeping schools open there's peak.

Btw, powerplant, I'm talking see see government give Iodine pills people Limburg possible radiation, making sure free state, case, seeing international ministers European Union urging Belgian state shut down, however seeing knowing Belgian politicians, politicians general, dont care cus much expensive, short-term, handle, radiation outburst may happen anytime massively outdated powerplant is. guys insistent wanting keep open cus ""its cheaper.""

Regardless, COVID, known horrible situation Southern Europe sooner later, acted it. Unfortunately, rather later sooner. unfortunately Belgian government works.

Like previously mentioned, born raised Belgium 13 years still visit every year still watch Belgian media (VTM, VRT, RTBF, etc;) shame cus politicians, contrast, really represent country people, unfortunately, cus find lackluster little seem care health citizens, act late. opinion though.

I dont blame everything, hell, live Spain wish would teach politicians thing 2 save money, make national economy greater, every government weak points, always thought Belgian parliament, often health citizens. idea masking protects droplets, (or much) aerosols, ventilation protects aerosols letting aerosols get concentration they‚Äôd present infection risk?

If so, good solution ensure ventilation winter without let elements? I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt agree him. people dying regardless. fair, think said year. science clear cut may think. scientists Europe can't really blame listening experts there's scientific consensus yet, even turns wrong. need ""firebreak"" parts country, lockdown gets people take seriously. government would rather NHS collapse people die could saved. 

My response trying spend money help economy - I'm going need money private health care I'm going make expenditure puts risk, nothing involves contact people. 

Countries controlled virus less economic damage, long government line pockets friends wont care. Lol, OK Cleetus. country large population (over 23 million) small land mass, quite accomplishment. 

But i's surprising. simply result happens leaders care science citizens what's best country. know. sad. A. Fauci one greatest heros student. knew one editors favourite books. unfortunate. we‚Äôve advanced far exact defense 1918. Wtf? *In US* Umm...

Pfizer cant even apply EUA middle november based 2 month data requirement, said Nov 15-21 would apply, doubt fda review accept data days. Oh surprise collecting money real product real logistics plan. anyone realize require low temperature storage literally every chain pharmacy way store since equipment? real world plan equip every pharmacy industrial refrigeration? foots bill? get units installed time etc?

Or way keep company afloat financial downturn?

Show real world plans instead empty promises. Thanks Sarah Pessica!

So last question: know hospitalization rate, measure ‚Äúsevere‚Äù cases?  - exposed personal life, *extra* helpful wearing mask public. making personal choice socializing, people around you. people grocery store may higher risk are, less willing exposed. solid wearing mask around them. 

Thank wearing mask public protecting people potential exposure. ‚Äú...Another parent child ‚Äúhighly susceptible respiratory infections‚Äù breathing issues, doesn‚Äôt meet level getting medical exemption, pediatrician told them. student pulled school couldn‚Äôt wear mask day long, per lawsuit...‚Äù

The child higher average chance contracting virus parents WANT around students wearing masks???? Good pediatrician seeing bullshit signing off. BCG (for tuberculosis) looked well. speculation primed immune system way help covid. It‚Äôs already known safe proven efficacious (even slightly) deployed. take proper precautions. Mask up, stay distant. congregate groups. Make sure plenty ventilation around people. 

For working public make sure wear mask properly make sure know protocol get customers/public wear properly. should't risk life Mr Jojo mask chin. 

We're going double secret probation duration year see numbers shifting towards better answer.  

OR...

It's thing...go bar...have good time. 

Someone appreciate job leave behind. Well, worked New Zealand. shared information countries WHO. supposed situations like that. Instead withheld information long could silenced whistleblowers telling truth. Totally insane, no? wear pants?  Much better trust one politician instead It‚Äôs pretty hard right transfer anyone Wisconsin. get patients ready go hospice, rehab nursing home, except one take still test Covid positive. sit hospital nowhere go. problem is, vaccines ineffective? news promising lately it‚Äôs dangerous strategy requires putting eggs one basket.  try looking logic batshit insane religious right. much common teachings Jesus leader, say zero! Try clearing folk ejected (or partly) car wear seatbelts.

Like masks, think ""it'll never happen me"", or, bloody-minded taking responsibility. *good* week? think ""good"" word would use describe it. People dying there. /Independence Day Well, maybe 2022 vaccine widely available mean, didnt say things, stuff isnt bad. sounds like think stuff makes okay underlings pandemic feeding scraps safe home. guess thats whole life understand would think good important thing. people living door dash precarious situation shouldnt even begin pretend like $15 hand sanitizer makes virus wont waiting weeks, need comprehensive stimulus... Ahhh yes, recently female led Belgium? Johnson Johnson behind. came late **huge** trial **huge** manufacturing capability. trial 60k people, other, better chances get data faster. Vaccine released half life 3 also changing tests since accurate nasal swabs. Stockholm region using Viral load appears real thing. would explain many healthy young doctors nurses died it. Currently living Midwest (ND specific), impossible convince people mask wearing normalized, fact people downright malicious establishment requires mask. people think need protect freedoms, harrassing endangering everyone else. Here's local report incident happened last week. twat logic work Kinda nuts doctors nurses still struggle get No, cases started rise already end August, mean infections happened vacation. data really support idea schools major source infections. Children may get infected, appear spread virus less adults. least schools monitored extent, exactly everyone feared students would spread virus. know schools safer, virus new. need careful adults, children. Wait... school called Resurrection School? 4 year old wears one day preschool. whole class does. big deal, unless make one! say thought abortion kills babies, reasonably open minded enough able see party killing millions infants year like them.

Trump absolutely done things. seems listening sources telling whole truth. even like Trump know things. following Covid since January knew nuts said bother masks unless you, personally, covid. Sweden's ifr estimated 0.3% 0.46%. study also based observations spring. Advancements treatment brought significantly since mean they‚Äôre outside much smaller groups? Study Tennesee, looking different localities, found places mask mandates flat rates going back July, whereas places without mask mandates saw 200% increase since then.




There plenty studies clearly shown wearing masks reduces spread significantly. know much mask mandate actually affects peoples' behavior, I'm guessing effect, even places low compliance.


Edit: mixed affect/effect end tweet infuriated end. proper way respect flag speedos bikinis. There's one way salute flag. 80% counties trending upwards http://covid.maxheckel.me keep posting people agree it. like form worldview angry Karen videos show isolated people freaking out. jostles made-up-mind masks alone may effective enough allows take easy route claiming people wearing can't quantified. this. work bank throughout pandemic we've continuing hire people Salesforce skills varying levels entire time.   Back good old days leading American institutions respected, too. Vaccinate critters vaccine bait Every government's 

No, every government really fair take small country compare whole US, first wave taken time travel across states. 8k cases country 8.7 million indeed lot. threat large fine would get lot people wear masks. citations issued ones won‚Äôt. Nobody go jail. Reason naming WWI countries cencorsed press, Spain stayed neutral it, press mostly free reported cases. I‚Äôm group, know lucky leave home supplies. respect people deliver food supplies I‚Äôve tipping minimum $15 anything order in. also helps curb deliveries know going cost much I‚Äôm likely use already home. whole, latest numbers see show 117/100k average daily cases Belgium. Surpassed one country, Czech Republic 118/100k. Germany currently 15/100k France 59/100k.

If want blame anyone, point schools open.

That 117/100k based 13,415 average daily cases; believe 7 day average. Basically Europe trending upward measures put place last week week show numbers another week come. Sala said milan 10 14 days decide case enforce lockdown not.

The virus going wait. That's intelligent argument. That's literally called slippery slope fallacy, mentioned said good thing intelligent argument...

Mandating masks would combat lockdowns talking about, lead them. people wear masks lockdowns become less likely since data says populations high mask usage rates lower virus infection rates. even like masks new. cultures using long time common Influenza viruses mutate faster significantly corona viruses. None mutations thus far significant enough impact vaccines efficacy. work healthcare. believe him. Late 2021/early 2022. grieve everyone following protocols, 500,000 people die January 2021. Literally 2 years wasted follow rules. ....I'm using time build credit write books. least *total* waste use time wisely. state media spread word first place. ordinary people online. mom talks relatives china almost every day. longer big issue there. they've contained new hotspots right away. Personally think that‚Äôs bit much whatever makes feel comfortable. wear gloves, mask, goggles change get home would Trump change mind? already have, go back previous comments patch together answer. refuse spend time bullshit. know guys I'ma start stockpiling pasta toilet paper again. get you, don‚Äôt disagree necessarily. worked construction youth though, say work awfully close together guys commute jobs together. spent plenty time 20s crammed vehicle going job site job site. 

Usually that‚Äôs simply home construction jobs, roofing painting, limited parking don‚Äôt want 15 cars lined street, often simply dudes poor drive car.

Anyways, get you, they‚Äôre far less liability anyways younger working outdoors open air environments... church gatherings rallies though, yeaaaaaa... work healthcare anyway. come family nurses. one doesn‚Äôt mom, lives family perform COVID tests day long (not kidding). 

And like.... I‚Äôm actually going see them, it‚Äôs odd reaction everyone ‚Äúyou‚Äôll exposed expose them‚Äù. We‚Äôre already exposed LOL Edit. Didn‚Äôt see text bold reason. 
Peace Here's happen.

*bell rings*

Hundreds children leave once, take masks second leave school gates walk home friends. they're so.......  Nah. dad hasnt taken seriously all. going beach BBQs chin diaper mask didnt surprise me. Also uncle currently sick probably infected uncle. 

What surprises symptoms even though he‚Äôs fat, hypertensive asthmatic Right, read full statement listen statements made past days pretty obvious he's talking gradual return normal people get vaccinated, exactly he's saying along.

It's looking increasingly likely safe somewhat effective vaccines going approved use fairly soon. they'll start administered, it'll take time large percentage population get doses. *Then* things slowly start get back normal. normal mean, I've said elsewhere here, told powers fear people. simple order gone, weird abnormal rules taken day day lives slowly start go away.

And get back licking doorknobs washing hands! Humans throughout history always downplayed crises underreacted. nothing new. Spanish Flu mask deniers types decrying government restrictions Absolutely. Let's let government break law Swedish constitution. harm that, eh? Switzerland, believe. don‚Äôt think herd immunity would even work virus mutates fast one does? Tell hard lockdowns, contact tracing, makes mandates work?

Let's see, Taiwan, China, Australia New Zealand done it. gets shorter list separation every day. Yes saying matter time lockdown. reality legal base. Maybe they'll find loophole, doubt it. Someone told me, straight face: politics. George Soros Bill Gates manufacturing chips control us ""vaccine"" make trump look bad covid isnt real killing people hospitals get funding. comparably dangerous. Exactly, summer long people saying ""it's gonna bad fall comes"" end October acting like surprise.

It's possible one person surprised, chose idiot interview. disagree completely. People brain injuries get older every day. It‚Äôs still possible document changes performance behavior due injury.

Edit: take headline wrong. changes due age. You‚Äôre fucking retarded. again: I‚Äôve given numerous expert opinions analyses support point, you‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúWell never prove 100%!!!111‚Äù like dimwit rolling around shit. 

See - insults absolutely appropriate. *are* dimwit rolling around shit. are. hospitals I've worked failover testing off-site copies month quarter.

This addition nightly backups charts accessed dedicated downtime machines. Covid eventually ""dies"" outside body well. Great point. Awareness made people less likely expose really sick people thus lessening number people get exposed really high viral loads. happens, every time. run platform fiscal conservatism, ignoring fact president balance budget since 1930s democrat- Bill Clinton. called joke No, didn't. dangerous Covid-19. Provinces governments, province doesn't?

With roughly reaction time, comparable population, Taiwan's performance good mediocre Chinese province. Yeah, we've stuck buying latex since June. Thats pretty fucking lame real winner Voyager 1. 14 Billion miles away bullshit. 230k dead. wonder many degrees separation people someone died. Oh, haha, sorry that!

I see many stupid comments even think whether something sarcasm anymore. opening windows really important reduces amount air recirculated. someone office infected, want droplets breath recirculated everyone building. even debating that. said is: ""Since Germany starting soft lockdown soon, great comparison two approaches."" almost starting metrics: closing non-essential shit tell people stay home. Force vs compliance (or maybe). evolved bats especially good anti viral defenses rely b cells antibodies cells many infections reduce inflammation may impair flying. viruses good avoiding b cell defenses 

Many recovered serious illness via cell immunity. vaccines engineered focusing b cell response. Also people defects genes related cell response. shut whole country it. I've hearing lot corners turning. Good article concluded virus still stealthy dangerous was,‚Äù Dr. Markel said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting better managing it.‚Äù

The study go long term consequences well mentioned article. see Jesse James Vader amalgam lol. Maybe hint Cobra commander. remember march tv MSM predicting millions deaths end 2020. deadly spanish flu. get news Facebook? amazing many people want bad. Blows mind Bad bot. Right, admit phrase exactly precise. GDPR widely misunderstood less concerns data used identify person. real message website shows ""we might sure we're stealing personal information legally allowed we're lazy find let opt in/out"". somehow even worse.

I certainly understand target audience primarily European, might care much dealing European laws. Whatever case, seeing message random website absolutely reason collect information extremely shady, matter live. Wikipedia:

The United States Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) estimated total, virus caused deaths one million people worldwide[15][16] beginning July 1968 outbreak faded winter 1969‚Äì70.[17] United States health authorities estimated 34,000[18][19] 100,000[15] people died U.S; excess deaths 65 older.[20] However, fewer people died pandemic previous pandemics several reasons:[15]

Some immunity N2 flu virus may retained populations struck Asian Flu strains circulating since 1957.
The pandemic gain momentum near winter school holidays Northern Hemisphere, thus limiting infection's spread.
Improved medical care gave vital support ill.
The availability antibiotics effective secondary bacterial infections. strawmanning again.

The virus is.  Reality is. going disappear simply makes day unpleasant dislike it.

This presumption vaccine must work simply anxious foolish.  science medicine work.

Most vaccine programs fail, new vaccine ever developed less four years, average vaccine requires decade develop.  naive expect record results would soothe feelings.  fellow Americans know pommes frites Belgium find France map. silly downvoted stating observation represents personal beliefs.

There two camps: one people believe virus threat trounces personal freedoms. camp believes tyranny threat trounces virus.

Both camps want protect families believe greatest existential threat. nothing selfishness poster said. South Korea never even locked down, argument really supports I'm saying here. used time establish safety measures like getting masks everyone, testing high test/case ratio, contact tracing, etc...

It's measures ultimately keep COVID check, lockdowns. Lockdowns last ditch efforts get implemented dropped ball everything else. US, India, Brazil, fair chunk Europe, Russia name few. Thankfully, no. co-workers drank Koolaid. asthma can't get Flu vaccine way... Hoping Biden mask mandate right inauguration speech. Would solve ton problems immediately Shameful. atheist don‚Äôt believe heaven hell view social construct help lend weight ‚Äúgood‚Äù ‚Äúbad‚Äù behaviors, actually thing ‚Äúhell,‚Äù don‚Äôt see he‚Äôs done anything stamp ticket supposed fiery depths. Ironic supporters generally Christian aside, though I‚Äôm expert, thought root Christianity helping other? Whatever happened that?

I tip fedora good sir. I'd rate post euphoric/10.  doesn‚Äôt, Biden blamed causing majority cases deaths people don‚Äôt understand exponential growth. again, trust Biden take pandemic seriously enough might fewer deaths watch Trump‚Äôs. estimates worst case spread 200k 1.7M. guess zero concern reprisals consequences hacks. don‚Äôt think lockdowns good way stopping spread, I‚Äôm anti-masker anything like don‚Äôt like lockdowns. complete mystery. Even though government reduced testing, India still conducts daily tests country world IIRC.

Lockdowns lifted, people roam around maskless. Yet, daily COVID cases sharply declining.

I know what's happening, definitely helped mental health :) Oh much faith. swedish telling actually cannot length measures would take place relatively long period time, please listen concede merely difference opinion, trying inform extremely prohibitive measures unlikely occur something familiar said not. Unfortunately boils politics media bias. allowed talk cannot divorce people percieving without addressing that. Ahh... back telling people wear masks. remember days! Nobody anywhere claimed zero flu deaths, also shit flu would less active year huge portion world quarantined/masked/distanced. 

That‚Äôs common sense. Yeah, I'm sure avoided first wave almost entirely, they're catching full brunt one. Well, town they're upgraded water system last year orders State since 2009 replace aging infrastructure. cross border illegally. Surrounded ocean helps skip relatively part sentence chance? rich country, poor country - relatively South Eastern Europe countries ( ignoring Greece) , similar population size, GDP much lower. 

This work Netherlands wanted to, maybe Denmark etc, good luck France, Paris neighborhoods full illegals would never comply.  Wow, know President? Wasn‚Äôt estimate 2.2 million? need work literacy skills.

They marketing business. already paid product. news disappointing, expect hear last minute. I've seeing far antimask crazies calling full unrestricted reopening.

I think crazies calling full lockdowns due massive increase cases rather vaccine though. Sample size = 1. China Xinjiang?

LMAO yes honey Chinese first language I've China. I've lived Asia 17 years ffs. 

Please provide academic literature sanctioned CCP government states Uyghur genocide ""fully bullshit."" 

I happily provide sources state contrary. 

[The Ili Rebellion: Moslem Challenge Chinese Authority Xinjiang, 1944-1949 Linda Rights Watch: Religious Repression Uighurs Uyghur Minority China: Case Study Cultural Genocide, Minority Rights Insufficiency International Legal Framework Preventing State-Imposed record, working economy mean genocide ongoing???? Myanmar clearly functioning businesses, yet Rohingya still massacred today. South Sudan, Central African Republic, Iraq, Syria. Similarly, successful people oppressed ethnicity erase genocide happening. agree false information spread, way entire genocide fabricated. Even was‚Äî *who?* fabricate lie scale would billions dollars investment. nation right mind would attempt that? purpose? arguments stand all.) Yup, social dumb-win-ism. Prior lock down, also unregulated exponential case growth see again. 2,250 deaths way knowing close real number cases causing amount deaths. smart money would on, hospitals choose gets care, deaths happen faster. remember prediction 3 million. 200k best case scenario...nice clickbait title.

This incorrect. was

A) CDC prediction, 200k low end end year worst case spread scenarios.

B) *total end pandemic, year*

C) well 200k actual deaths still 1/4 year away end

D) Birx actually said right 100k perfect response bound...
Nice lie. applies too. look us example do. Oooh see, thanks! Vaccines almost always weaker last long though. grief him?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* hard Biden dramatically change much around COVID-19

Mostly inauguration January, week normal peak cold flu season. There's basically nothing do. question much Trump wants burn everything down. Sweden larger Germany yet less 1/8 amount live Sweden obsessed Nah. prefer weak die off.  No, think federal mask mandate would better, let states decide. 

Who's going enforce mandate anyway? Fining people creates pretty big increase perception get caught. Anti maskers use prove masks needed. national mandate wear pants public cover nudity wear seatbelt car, mask big deal. it. travel work found eat fairly often since pandemic kicked off. make sure wear mask unless actively eating/drinking. restaurant starts fill switch carryout.

Everything even remotely enjoyable work based travel sucked abyss. mean ""wave"" amount much? god even suggesting I've wondering too, although always talk measles consider tuberculosis? airborne small infectious dose, still requires prolonged contact infected person thus low R. attack rate 20%, bit higher covid-19's 15%. course causative agent bacterium make difference? states cant interfere states interstate commerce United allowed passenger fly ""pending"" test result. can't work honor system anymore--clearly. Generally speaking large percentage experts agree called consensus. want listen those. less 1% ""experts"" disagree unlikely good arguments make sense people knowledgable field, otherwise would larger percentage side. Probably. I'd still wear mask public places rather explaining people probably need one. average internet user smarter non-net user. decisions baffled scientists

Both decisions adequately explained self serving malfeasance. day 4 year old class said ""yeah wear masks they're friends "" said ""you still get coronavirus friends"" lead teacher said ""and there's proof masks work""

Well maybe cause nose pulled talk 75% time, yes proof. Ugh. -_- Ah ol' 'we tried nothing, ideas'. Great argument. That's true, find believable cases Florida may actually declining right now, reason they're surging north: weather. cold enough north people spending much time inside, south finally starting cool enough people turning AC spending time outside. saw pattern back late winter early spring (cases spike cold north much south) summer (cases drop north spike south everyone inside AC running). pattern holds things start go sideways south another month two. There's help coming *after* either. Even loses, Trump remain power January. ""Hello account might danger, click here"" eeet! :P Nah I‚Äôm him. say ‚Äúwe won‚Äôt vaccine 2023‚Äù nope do. need live life. point there‚Äôs vaccine 2021 everyone wants stay home everyone else go out. way go two years independent media like US.

So appears Europe failed worse US fighting covid. Similarly cancer. lot debate second hand smoke weather cancer risk associated exists acceptable limit model low exposure rates exist threshold body fight back. 

But pushing metaphor beyond limits.

Point is, could smell smoke, could exposing covid. makes relatable example. live Canada. walk one day cop yells old guy car roof asks he‚Äôs going. says ‚Äúto pharmacy‚Äù points (good answer). cop says ‚Äúyou 10 minutes‚Äù. 

Surreal indeed.  New Zealand's mask mandate limited scope yet still stomped virus. Over-reliance single mandate backfire. would absolutely share enclosed spaces people known HIV+. ""OH God, KArdashians!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" /S/ There's federal enforcement mechanism mask wearing. It'd general guideline would ignored people ignoring now. no. stores want make people wear inside, fine. government forcing people shit never right option matter what. First off, nobody's saying make work, enough social buy-in.

Second, assuming people going bills pay.. certainly part it, people also just... going they're people. Young people keep parties, stop them. curfew, stay home order, mask mandate. Old people keep parties care (source: everyone 50 know). stop evictions utility shut-offs, that's great, result successful lockdown. 

Third, offense I've going gym times week months never found difficult keep mask duration visit. Maybe twice slide end water bottle mask, drink water, put away mask never actually comes process take 5 seconds. Putting category restaurants bars kind nuts.

Like I'm sorry, see coming understand, reality people want trust anyone saying it'll short lockdown moving goalposts first time around. People tired. People angry.

Finally, lose all-caps exclamation points. much harder take comment seriously needed be. I'd like add also unfair automod also filter things like names political parties president? several posts removed instantly use terms mentioned. convenience.

Exactly meant insult failed. Octopuses invertebrates one intelligent animals planet. Comparing congress undesirable (and deadly) microscopical beings sounds appropriate. Ahhh, thanks....so flue vaccine ""primes"" immune system, also help viruses like COVID-19. excess deaths 19th September recorded 151.059, covid deaths 136.565 date. 10.6% reported deaths.

One thing consider covid reported deaths Brazil indicate reported happened, Amazonas state, instance, reported hundreds deaths October revised covid deaths happened beginning pandemic, number might get lower.

Source:  think movie theaters coming back. Forgetting hat able play recess genuinely heartbreaking experience. Great ArachnidTree Declaration.  Barrington Declaration stupid wrong never even discussed again. Exactly, courage means acknowledging threat deciding face threat anyway. can't bring even admit threat real, says lot you. researchers literature imply flu vaccine may activate natural killer cells body. No, I've heard theory. know bars stayed business even long. Irn Bru one them? Western Australia has.

No community cases since April. announcement brought manufacturers Flu Vaccine.

I joke, get shot! trust government open bars restaurants 4 weeks 100% certainty? say 'cases/hospitalizations high, can't open yet' 'cases/hospitalizations dropping nicely, can't open yet'? think depends lot scale looking considered flattened. places considerably flatter others. look something big geographically states rolling peaks one area may flat others spiking.

And discussion isnt say hide home whole time reasonable precautions take help keep thing manageable level. keep hospital numbers low stuff stay open. numbers start going way needs short term measures put place quickly reduce spread couple incubation periods.  Oh yeah. culturally, politically, technologically, historically primed handle well. think US could done pretty decently sound leadership, way we'd ever good Vietnam, say. want proper stay home order entire country (exempting essential services) six weeks, along generous stipend every household moratorium evictions mortgages. 

During time want see serious national strategy develop cheap, easy, fast, noninvasive testing reopen without seeing uncontrolled spikes.

But don‚Äôt think happen country. case sense April, we're heading summer.

I'm happy go another 6mo+ without community. rest world year, assess options then.  possible without COVID balls deep k hole Bassnectar show? Yes, doubt cases rising US, I'm wondering severe uptick seen European countries.

I suppose time tell, current uptrend seem good. Anyone tortures animals (like fur farms) deserves karma. make model plug benefit wearing masks.

Whether actually save many lives proven anywhere model - that's function inputs. ""The European commission president, [Ursula von der asked EU leaders help Brussels map intensive care bed capacity allow transfer coronavirus patients overrun hospitals across Europe amid rise infection every member state."" hope mods allow article stay posted. inherent political component coronavirus. next election essentially choice continuing policies lead 3 surges 225K-275K deaths change scientific handling pandemic hopefully lot less sickness death. hell think conducting trials, reviewing results, ultimately (hopefully), approving them?

Because work unless want locked indefinitely. Forreal. read article heard vaccine available public next fall. wonder, meant one approved January ready distribution fall. Literally every scientific expert predicted exactly happening back March: second possibly worse wave coming fall

Nobody ever said would end 2020. anything, timeframe normal moved rapid vaccine development Nope hes nitpicky douche ""We trust called experts.""

There‚Äôs reason doctor nurse put danger. citizens chose path, working sick preclude recovery.

This reason military deploy military doctors rural America.

But there‚Äôs enough people carry like nothing happening.

There‚Äôs safety net America. Well, Americansoldier WW2, across branches, risk dying 1.8%.

Your risk dying 27 year old contract Covid 0.004%.

So risk dying American soldier WW2 450x higher contract Covid.

On hand, risk dying Gulf War 0.002%. Covid 2x riskier catch deploying Persian Gulf 1991.

All kind irrelevant though. risk dying Covid someone 65-74 2.5%, risk someone 75-84 8.5%.

So people 65+, risk dying Covid somewhere 2-5x deadly deploying American soldier WW2, risk spreading them. going respect science. really need hear?  mean...so? gets this, it. solution addiction solution broke choose drugs food, withdrawal mugging someone. teen depressed zoom meetings triggering point.

Suck elope kids! little context: Austin close anywhere South gets to, say, Boston.

OTOH, Midland-Odessa real Texas, ain't they? Ok, vaccine something hopeful about. treatments? treatments come change much anything? don‚Äôt think treatment date shown efficacy reducing death rate. ‚Äúflip people stomach‚Äù whatever 8 months this, pretty much got nothing. happened Monoclonal antibody therapy Regeneron? Trump promised every American COVID would get free, US Army would distribute every hospital America. it?! close border altogether? one traveling anyway. per capita reference, Argentina 45 million people. 0.066% entire population died confirmed COVID far :(

Does anyone know Argentina‚Äôs overall excess deaths are? [The Economist‚Äôs excess deaths doesn‚Äôt seem Argentina‚Äôs data. Covid killed pops, looks like maybe potentially people worn masks social distanced directed scientists would still us. still able bury restrictions. fucking hate every single person feels like special need mask public rite now. Put shut fuck up.

Anually average 600k death WORLDWIDE. double less year... anyone family get sick? No? Shocker. Exactly. explains people careless flu season, meanwhile hundreds thousands people around world die it. didnt know still places earth without cases. Kinda crazy. literally contradict myself, need go reeducate yourself. also said right, literally contradicted yourself. wrong, see benifits February. Americans chose bad pandemic would 4 years ago. reminder, Biden get office January even wins still dipshit governors fighting common sense every step way good ol' freedom fighters refusing wear masks reasonable way. Fighting virus way deeply ingrained political issue point. really think there's fixing now. GF WFH. HQ office opening 2022. We're desperately trying work LCOL SEA country. even Canada, Mexico. borders closed Americans stupids. Very. know of* another 900 old deaths. Crazy times. really wonder going added list diseases look for. think 13 year olds going absolutely fine going school months. 

How many months think fine? Schools closed months back spring. Another months now. what? going magically disappear whenever lockdown ends. point going become fine? oh think know well far beyond now. 

I remember seeing video back early march passenger train getting offended someone asked cover mouth coughed said, ""In 6 months unsurprised beaten half death this"". wrong - took 3 months. I‚Äôm personally offended fuck well. probably egregious lie I‚Äôve ever seen come administration

Edit - [case Yup, add raging Vietnam war, throw heavy dose Nixon. crazy time. bright spots, space race amazing.  don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs joke; he‚Äôs putting person gets reminder see numbers today comparison Estado Unidos tiene enfermos malos hombres. truly scared. survival rate COVID pretty high, no? Shocking see Belgium suffered badly first wave badly hit. Well, right thing. got support, least. over, able look back period one died lost family member you.

Google lot tracking, many people want, use alternatives services. Using AMP, track even more, might even replace ads own, stealing ad revenue site's owners. Since there's consistent way finding original links AMP link, made bot automatically you. Mask, SD, gatherings. Oh get it, people enjoy sports Neanderthals can't communicate properly. Good one... Glad posted tired joke 3 times could 3 times laughs. airstrikes Syria President Obama 2013: 

Democratic support¬†38% 

Republican support:¬†22%

Support airstrikes Syria President Trump 2017:

Democratic Support: 37% 

Republican Support: 86%


Republican voters care much saying message message is. would've listened Trump. could've saved thousands American lives said three words. 

""Wear mask."" 

Three words would've cost American Taxpayers nothing. Three words would've difference American family right grieving loss thier loved one. 

But American public worth Trump. worth three words. like worth reporter asked he'd like say anything scared right responded attacking him. 

The man monster enemy us all. Hillary‚Äôs emails?!? Sounds pretty good actually. I‚Äôll join Agree that. pulled money market bought house still up. definitely believe going stay way gotta start taking shit seriously. Funny thing is, practice, one mostly forced weld oneself behavior small group abusing liberty small gain great expense others. lol no, electoral college voted trump. Popular vote 100% way rioting Philly getting way less attention we're week national election, nothing country open

anyway, said anything communist utopia? Totally agree. personally, I'm also feeling pressure things SO's family, going lives normal. What's point sitting home I'm exposed people fun experiencing mental health troubles related pandemic/isolation? still cautious, starting see them, I'm exposed association. anything, staying home causing problems personal life  come phrase mantra repeat people.

Please stop half masking it! No, going force people comply vaccine available. white house can't even make lies people believe task force would personally offended associated White House all.

It stains one's reputation. really isn‚Äôt weird tbh half million infections per week come 15 weeks?

you mean 500 weeks, ten years

unless saying going get exponential, works certain point people start freaking locking inside like NYC ambulance sirens 24/7 many there? Yeah. quite time open borders US Europe. True, never mind basic lesson civility. It‚Äôs taken 8 months reach 227k deaths. people getting astronomical death numbers millions from?? 35 higher chance dying car crash one year dying covid19. anyone even surprised? worn mask needed since March 10th. punch gut, kidney, liver, lungs heart point.  post removed cannot verify reliable source.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Logistic curve... never thought I'd see country much turmoil. 2009, vaccine used H1N1 flu Europe caused several people develop Narcolepsy. Rushed vaccines need undergo much higher scrutiny vaccines time tested gone normal processes place. anti-vaxxer believe work credited saving countless lives, one ever said 100% flawless safe. Oh sorry :/ specifically America UK parts Europe also case numbers high.

Interestingly Federal government started handing monthly JobKeeper JobSeeker stimulus cheques March kinda passed everything state governments organise, state borders closed early on, Victoria unfortunately bad second wave. 

I family currently US cancelled plans visit back July feel everyone right now. Lol ""they caused it""

It happened them. them. Remember that. Yep. never supposed close 12-18 months. Republicans put us rock hard place. Bad decisions lead hard choices. decisions getting worse. choices getting harder. Oh sure. I'm taking piss Exactly, coronavirus whole new masks work would unsure one? I'm aware reference Office popular phrase people use different formats regular speech. use often feel need whip exact scene Office reference it. seem confusing exactly what's happening, kids still going school still go work presence ""needed""... effective lockdown, sure people run around infecting others thanks restaurants closing! /s whoever downvoted needs basic lessons infectious diseases work. fault? voted Trump.  Nope. strictly. week ago guessing Mexico would surpassed US deaths per capita. US 703 Mexico's 694. Looks like it'll another week. publicly available contact tracing data. certainly doable.

That's way live. point made, thankyou Reddit. Yep did. Sorry brains working. going collapse anyway economy collapses people start rioting. think good compromise if/when comments start breaking rule 4 much. Seconded. would argue already made choice lay bed Pretty sure takes years train doctors nurses WE'RE #1! WE'RE #1!

Everything else put hold 1-2 years hopefully work towards vaccine. I'm visit family friends outside small bubble risk transmission. sucks, hardly much ask pandemic like this.

Also, government US better supporting people choose getting sick, possibly dying, possibly living rest life disability, versus going bankrupt losing everything. 

But anyone gets sick either dies lifelong disability may still lose everything, healthcare system designed force people bankruptcy. mentality would fine instantly died, that's works, they'll spend weeks hospital bed sucking hospital resources desperately clinging life try protect healthy. Onya Vic! commendable morn evert death. OTOH matter done daily ocurance, albeit different reasons. Let's overcome it.

You guys fine job. Yep. took saving I've saving put bitcoin rest investments. way I'm trusting government keep printing money wont be, 2022 completely useless. dont fight coronaviruses vaccines. never developed coronavirus vaccine *ever* humans, despite trying decades common colds.

Its fantasy quell unrest

Google SARS eliminated MERS. Theres two options - mutation social enforcement force people work, better pay every single penny need

Or open everything let people decide what's safe what's not. don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre wrong, also don‚Äôt see us going route now. Unfortunately. socialism, they'll still among highest paid professions, added bonus student debt pay for.  White House already it, far care. realize Melania said hates Christmas campaign promise, are. 
 
How many grandparents going absent winter shitbags abject failure deal. 
 
Like, US, per capita, worse India? Holy shit federal response bad.  cross influenza put COVID-19 document, put 2024 instead 2011. ‚ÄúThose fail learn history doomed repeat it‚Äù tested urgent care nose painful bleeding least three days. Obviously live different places. 26k. bad considering 19k march.

But yeah, wouldnt buying atm. Encourage governors mayors enact mask mandates. Since Pfizer big pharma trusted word? Taiwan, Vietnam, Thailand, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Japan, others I‚Äôm probably missing too. Good thing much, much less deadly Spanish flu. Bloomberg simpin'

*laughs Sarah Palin vice presidency* Oh, *electoral college* think? That's what's important! Maybe late January/early February. Well, Florida reporting 4,000 new cases per day. France, 3x population, 48,000 new cases per day (about 4x worse per capita).

As Canadian I‚Äôm impressed Florida‚Äôs record it‚Äôs much better lots European countries. Repeat infections recorded it‚Äôs less 10. Didn‚Äôt hear? whole world attempt oust American political office, everything goes away 4th November.
