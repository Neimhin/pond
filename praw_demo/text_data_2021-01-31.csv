Non-severe form Covid would also develop natural immunity antibodies spike proteins. South African strain hits. Last three days 1.7, 1.6, 1.6. 5 million 3 days. go! 30 history anaphylaxis. Yes, imagine headaches pretty severe! variant that's rampaging first identified UK, necessarily mean started there. UK much Covid sequencing rest world combined. Odds find looking it. Covid entered Europe Italy. ill towards them? virus care nationality are, humanity together. called projection. willing make things mean everyone else is.

That means diverting attention. 

Now asking show proof opinions. thousands videos youtube sweden, far seen none shows reality claim.

Show proof point. Ive said begging EU far perfect, like jumping 747 one engines stalled. past 3 days, US administered 20% vaccine doses given thus far (5 million doses). We’re starting gain momentum this. takes whole day dig car snow street...with regular snow. 14+ inches, takes multiple days. Snow plowed car. Getting ain't easy.

Taxi's hard come too. remember snow storm (not huge, 5-10 inches) fell ny around 2003. Going work day via taxi cause going able walk train station. Worked. Took train home. good. kept snowing day throughout night.

The following day? snowing, ONE could reached. taxi's. Walking bus stop endless bus running 1 bus every hour. train MIA. attempting get train (I think closed R train), went bus stop. bus never came. taxi's all. calling 5:30AM 8AM. Ended staying home cause work way far walk buses/trains/taxi.

&amp;nbsp;

My manager got work late. get open up. ""mad us"" cause said done did. get train bus. ended walking miles miles way ot work waiting see bus showed (it show up). literally walked whole bus route way work. Took 2 hours. even consider that.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyway, whole point everything slows crawl. cars they're snowed in. taxi's cause they're snowed in. trains cause outside portions ton snow. bus cause send like 1 per hour (if we're lucky). 

&amp;nbsp;

It sucks stopped vaccinations cancellations going huge. Especially since older people getting right now. older people walk there. cars/bus/train available, heck gonna get there? How's grandma doing? need work faster. That’s slow. Maybe approve China Russia’s vaccine? really early tell sure. chance something like happens far certain. !RemindMe 29 days things true? Yes, owners want money also MAKES SENSE. It’s actually possible want money *and* allow players/managers/personnel/fans vaccinated. I'm still waiting celebrate delayed Christmas elderly dad. :( Herregud wrong guy lunatic.  Apart said that. Give rest loser. Vault Health

  I'm curious. think I'm trying divert attention? think uncovered here? What's big conspiracy exposing? past weeks United States deadliest coronavirus pandemic, residents majority counties remain extremely high risk contracting virus. time, transmission seems slowing throughout country, number new average cases 40 percent lower Jan. 29 U.S. peak three weeks indicators reinforce current downward trend cases. Hospitalizations significantly record highs early January. number tests per day also decreased, obscure virus’s true toll, positivity rate tests also gone down, indicating slowed spread real. Still, average reported daily death rate past seven days remains 3,000, compared less 1,000 per day September October.  lot
Quicker us [archive link anyone trouble accessing article it’s called “appeal stone” .. logical fallacy clinging elaborate please -  second shot moderna/pfizer rough - so? Thank That's actually less likely. What's likely COVID continue mutate around year-long, warm weather proven little effect COVID. watch Fareed Zakaria's video it. 

Like Bill Gates said back then, Zakaria's saying now; outbreak anywhere, outback Canada much local vaccine manufacturing capability, meaning need rely vaccine coming countries. US export vaccine moment, Belgium Pfizer plant (which Pfizer vaccine shipped from) undergoing upgrades resulted delays. I'm teacher, vaccination date April 23rd. that's first shot. I'm lucky. Many friends/coworkers appointment mid June. literally half total vaccinations France... single day 

Hope we’ll speed anytime soon Fuck miss lot! Going lads, partying, letting loose often getting home sunrise. Working electrical engineer job quite mentally taxing. weekends gave recharge boost self esteem. can't wait get back. Compared anal sex? know man, people actually like option, I've yet see anyone buying swabs going ""I'm going insert babies behing eyes tonight"". serious note weak constitution guess, really really hated may still offer virtual ad option fall, outside chance high school could hybrid.

Elementry schools back normalish. Virtual school lot better expected, way anyone going put another year that, hybrid. diverting attention know right know videos show true situation sweden. 

What amazes keep discrediting without showing proof wrong.

Thousands videos showing thing cannot wrong someone like saying opposite without showing proof cannot right. 

Show proof could perfectly lying protect sweden nothing knows what's actually happening. showed videos showed nothing. Uh aren’t cancelling season point? That's completely different. Neither Trump Biden responsible vaccine's development third party effort. even U.S. 

Logistics deployment something attribute past leader. Trump laid lot pipeline yes, never pushed water pipes priority getting reelected. 

Again example would may THOUSANDS cars ready go, prioritize delivery, never happen within reasonable time. administration prioritize cars driven. prioritize cars driven, never realize need 10,000 cars go next phase. 

It's domino effect positive milestones Trump would never triggered. Ahh wow idea. Definitely agree that.

I sit middle fence. 

Anti vaccers prevent anyone wants vaccine getting people get vaccinated issue people want get vaccinated.  

Its politics religion. Vote want beliefs that's cool. get angry people think exactly way you. That's whole F*CKING point living free country! meant terms driving distance population. get empty different definition 'not bad drive' here. I've stuck fucking apartment past 11 months guess that's small sacrifice you. Same! Lmao. curious rabbit popular AZ may headquartered doesn’t mean much seem think does. Apple EU headquartered Ireland etc.

I’m anti useless government failure one instance. unfortunate part success it’s going distract total abject failure every aspect response. *I mean still think severing free trade biggest trade partner astronomically stupid thing country voted modern history*

Sigh. 

- Without UK, EU smaller market US. Free trade US possible EU member. bunch trade partners.
- Even EU member, UK traded rest world rest EU. (Quite bit more, gap steadily increasing years.) *only* EU member position.
- ran healthy surplus rest-of-world trade, unhealthy deficit rest-of-EU trade.
- turns out, ended fairly free (no tariffs quotas) trade EU anyway. much surprise since (per above) better trade do.

There plenty excellent reasons wary Brexit, ""astronomically stupid"" requires selective reading arguments. Claiming UK remain protectionist bloc sake free trade also bit oddity. explain article commenting describes patient fighting \_two\_ variant infections once? Clearly body's immune response learned one infection enough stop other. direct evidence contradiction 'fact check'. Well count fan willing give money. want go game year takes it. Part investment made basis China's promises open economy accession WTO, still honoured. 

Yea no. China fulfilled vast majority WTO obligations never promised letting foreign capital come uncontrolled. Regardless, stripping away political trash narratives, take look [complaints filed Last time checked, China 44 cases them, 52% coming United States. United States whopping 167 cases them, &lt;10% coming China. wonder country actually interested compliant WTO rules, one clear agenda here? 

Taking step back, proponent “free trade” conveniently forget Western nations colonizing world centuries, destroying looting natural human resources, infrastructure, political system, social order, etc… able build infrastructure advanced technologies, raise generations highly educated populace, establish massive corporations money resources world disposal. “free-market social-justice human-rights loving” Westerners take corporations developing lands ancestors destroyed, ask compete one-on-one local business. cry “unfair!” local people anything short handing market silver plater. Yea, cry river.

  
 China's autocratic tendencies risk sabotaging business deals world large (Australia, India, America, UK), along technology theft precipitated trade war America guiding countries try move manufacturing away China (in words, China enriched promised less autocratic, lapsing back autocracy risks selling short failing achieve potential. Admittedly Xi Jinping already gotten wanted relationship, however illicitly, likely snowball China momentum, really anything recommend authoritarianism it?): 

Technology theft another Western attempt twisting narrative misrepresent China. want write another 3-pager but, worried China's trading. recent months able sign EU-China deal well RCEP (which includes Australia btw). ""manufacturer moving away China"" mostly due capitalists wanting find cheaper labors elsewhere China's economy develops. course international pressure US-led allies, China's economy challenges sort out, again, see there's clear argument China become ""openly democratic"" capitalistic country, least interest Chinese sure. 

  
 shown real ambition anything pay lip service socialism recent decades (inequality continues grow, wealth redistribution exists degree would expect truly socialist communist country). 

wait...are blaming CCP hardcore communist enough? Anyhow, CCP socialist/communist philosophy heart policies plans put executed years (how many aware of? probably 0) eliminate absolute poverty, reduce urban-rural gap, control skyrocketing real estate prices, etc indications top, leaders want rich able abuse poor. look poverty alleviation documentaries (ironically, PBS one allow air ""Chinese propaganda) see extent effort local CCP officials. simply see kind commitment countries. Also, scale matters. Running socialist country 1.4 billion legacy poverty still affecting many people, running tiny socialist Nordic nation that's already well-off economically. size pie needed feed 1.4 billion people socialist country impossibly huge, realistic option first grow pie state-led capitalism redistribute pie/system large/stable enough. personally see happening anytime soon long government sticks principle looks little guys could, see reason fret. Ok :) seen evidence actually live Sweden? sure making up?

Show video evidence.

Your post history disturbing. let's end there.

I know get you, please try keep nonsense conspiracy theory subreddits. Covid real. Even better would could try get world completely work mental health.

Best wishes. agree - I've insanely lucky country that's relatively unscathed virus, seeing good news coming states feels like....weight coming shoulders. Can't remember last time felt like light end tunnel. 

Hope ride last months well :) Schools won’t normal fall. Like said, suburbs might. again, perfect example Reddit’s hive logic, particularly sub. It’s also good parallel US treats countries. suburban schools normal, subreddit won’t care. like US vaccinated, Ghana isn’t, don’t care. got ours. Poor kids left fend reddit cease caring got “normal”.  rely forecasting method state (VT) straight says know much vaccine getting 2 weeks now, forecast next 2 weeks only. previous admin said withholding 2nd dose, later announced not. current administration giving 2-3 week forecast actually beyond getting previously.

With VT one better performers point, believe say need doses assistance. statement soon KNOW much getting Feb-March prepared scale roll out.

I would much rather accurate idea much available (and fall line) vs ""Florida style"" opening long wait lines people spend hours line walk away nothing. get first dose assurance second available time. Hell yeah, hope so. really love teaching home. kids love learning home. You’ll probably see burbs well. lose hope, know long immunization lasts. process takes months, immunization short lived math!   I'm Canadian UK, I'm concerned elderly parents back home still waiting vaccine, glad they're Canada here, stood much higher chance dying. get frustration delay still much better off!  UK figure first variants December. it, low detected even level sampling.  don’t want to. put elsewhere;

Has EU receiving supply supply sending vaccines countries?

I keep seeing Israel Canada mentioned along statement EU exporting, really Pfizer filling contracts, private company.

The big difference letting private company fulfil contracts versus country exporting vaccine somewhere else (i.e. EU owning doses.and sending versus Pfizer sending doses owned Canada Canada) RemindMe! 5 weeks Maybe, maybe not. Could look like measles lucky. theory shouldn’t evolve fast influenza bypass vaccinations. real question long last. vaccine doesnt stop covid entirely lessens symptoms people mean winter see outbreak? turn yearly thing like flu? like year get covid shots?  blatantly untrue, reason people dying COVID  really isn’t bad everything know Novavax vaccine Canada. get anything wrong think add anything let know.

* 2 dose vaccine given 21 days apart
* Canada originally ordered 76M doses August 31st Jan. 22nd changed purchasing 52M option 24M doses.
* Canada third country make agreement Novavax (after US UK)
* UK phase 3 clinical trials ended recently showing good vaccine efficacy 89.3% severe cases 15K participants
* US/Mexico phase 3 clinical trial started 16K enrollments 30K. trial finished end April.
* Moderna/Pfizer 40K participants phase 3 trail
* unclear Health Canada wait US/Mexico trial finalizing approval
* Canada get Novavax doses Q1
* Novavax planning making 2B doses 2021 150M per month starting May June. India making 1B doses.
* Canada get doses Moderna (2M) Pfizer (4M) Q1
* Canada get 20M doses Moderna Pfizer Q2
* Pending Health Canada approval Canada could get additional 20M doses Oxford/J&amp;J/Novavax Q2 Ty Well see think would apply went school did, worked amazingly. ran major financial problems cut programs made school effective.

Now use income lobby policy changes help make schools like school had. much better use talents resources address problem. hate children I'm bad explaining things people would make terrible teacher make lot money throw people better things me.  point Uk supply AstraZeneca vaccine coming exclusively UK-based plants, per company’s contractual obligation. couldn’t care less Belgium plant, key issue EU wrongly claiming ownership vaccines produced UK, cover shambles vaccine procurement. 

Reason Matt Hancock wanted AZ vaccine produced UK, ensure completely self sufficient production particular vaccine. Given transpired, think inspired move.

What EU seems lose sight brand new vaccine issues “growing” culture that’s used vaccine Belgium plant. That’s what’s causing delay, false narrative AZ favouritising UK. fact due 20 million vaccines end last year 5 million due similar supply issues. EU ordered / approved vaccine later, they’re encountering issues later, that’s all.

Fact is, EU messed big time must surely immense amount pressure EU Commission also recent Northern Ireland fiasco. They’re complete meltdown evidently Like said, that's reasoning need come excusing away thought policing, it. History shown time time suppressing extremists speech magically make disappear, makes louder, even extreme, forces underground even aware exists country late.   case, cannot reasonably imply deliberate spreading conspiracy theories / misinformation, medical professional trying alert colleagues possible healthcare emergency comparable analogous (in accordance argument rational people professional environment anyone would expect do). 

I think Dr. Li fine, intentionally spreading misinformation. he's also familiar virology (he's ophthalmologist) and, suppose alternative timeline, wrong disease or, doctor intentionally spreading (fake)news SARS outbreak, mechanism control that? not, people panic, buy supplies, flee cities due unconfirmed rumor, who's take responsibility? know there's easy answer. personally think okay got slap wrist. real issue Hubei government bureaucratic, incompetent dragging feet onset pandemic. 

 suppose would reckon whether great firewall good idea principle. Would choose live (to never really know outside world, whether information consuming real not, living bubble according governments designs prescriptions?). 

You're completely wrong assume people who's ""the great firewall"" know outside world. firewall easy bypass people really wants so, one ever got trouble simply that. fact, many departments various universities companies, state enterprises official greenlights go outside firewall due nature work. mention one China's biggest exports outside world millions students tourists annually, vast majority willingly return China. nature firewall point rite passage, i.e. ""if capable bypassing qualified see outside world"". China actually cares learn outside world knows quite lot, much Western ""China watchers"" know China that's sure.

  
 recent decades Chinese civil society hollowed attacks religious practicioners, rival politicians, journalists, human rights advocates, lawyers, free thinkers, artists, influencers, foreigners, minorities etc. etc. (social, cultural, intellectual artistic gains lagged behind economic gains recent decades) 

And aware watch Chinese shows, movies, participate vibrant Chinese internet communities religious activities China? Epoch Times tells Falun Gong practitioners organ harvested bullshit? Westerners privileged think society economic development fast social/artistic development ""hollow"". country went hundred years colonization abuses, foreign invasion, brutal civil war, people poor average life expectancy slightly 30 yrs back beginning 20th century, people gets decide important not, Western imperialists. Sovereignty, peace, stability, economic prosperity core priorities Chinese people everything takes backseat assured. There's zero tolerance anything anyone threatening principles. may understand perspective, right tell otherwise. 

You're correct however pure artistic intellectual appreciation still lot room grow society. But, that's ""CCP control"" , ""no freedom"" whatever shallow diagnosis Westerners come with. Rather big media companies chasing profit expense quality/depth, smaller, independent groups produce quality contents make enough money they're willing cater consumerism materialism. recent years there's pushback kinds practice people demand more. 

  
 *you frequently point fact China become lot richer cite sign Chinese government done something right*, broadly speaking result foreign financial investment  would done well economically whether capitalist, socialist, democratic autocratic 

Foreign investment plays big part doubt. strategic directions like focusing infrastructure, education, poverty alleviation programs, due CCP leadership. programs would waste away gridlock China American-style ""democracy"", especially China ""opens up"" foreign capitalists could influence politics. Western capitalists way, China would end couple vibrant coastal cities (Shanghai example) wealth concentrated hands 0.01% rest country eat shit. kind capitalistic government exactly KMT back CCP took over, China exactly described. 

In addition, many 3rd world countries Africa South America gets plenty foreign investments yet continue stay poor. difference countries China CCP forces foreign investments make money China, give something return Chinese people time. leaders countries either position so, assassinated/toppled CIA's regime-changing operations, straight-up invasion NATO. called projection. willing make things mean everyone else is. Around 27% according Table 3 Although recent data Denmark suggest may closer 50%. either case, inevitable. Again, show proof, opinion.

That german guy made effort travel sweden made documentary admitted see claim.

Everything hear dismissing videos without proof. 

Show proof. way thousands videos YouTube showing total normality sweden, think situation different show proof. far see nothing you.

youtube full videos shows exactly opposite, total normality, masks keep giving opinions instead facts. can't point UK contract, entirely plausible there's guarantees there. Yet EU commission claim AZ provided guarantees them, contract released botched redactions showed 'best reasonable efforts' guaranteed. Either lying know contract. 

I can't think upside AZ dirty EU. anglo-SWEDISH company. would choose throw EU bus favour UK? would madness antagonise EU risk losing impairing market.

I hope EU citizens get vaccinated fast possible. also hope EU commission accept appropriate share blame rather resorting vaccine nationalism. world can't pull together Covid, that's depressing state affairs. Heard MSNBC week. Bit annoying tutor deleted response could reply, posterity reply was:

Sure, agree said, say priveledge played big role admissions (especially terms connections unfair advantage). Rather priveledged access better education tutors prior applying University.

I thought back college studying Economics 9 I'd say slight disproportionately upper class representation. However, less intelligent motivated rest us. Probably opposite least terms motivation. international students would would point finger terms degree place purchase. Looks like politicians trying shift blame away themselves. Yeah, one yesterday Dodger Stadium LA. protest caused shut site hour. BioNTech facility expects fully operational “first half 2021”. 😂 

Texas increasing vaccination 30% week, due unexpected vaccine shipments Pfizer. personally email governor begging send ”excess” vaccines Europe. 

I’ll leave conclusions, whether that’s likely, you. 😆 everything going manufactures either they’re lying expect big bump vaccines. takes time virus replicate enough body PCR tests pick up. recommendations 'safe' holiday travel get \_two\_ tests spaced two days. first test pick infection much higher chance detecting growing couple days. isn’t true. NYC kept infections low months lockdown. UK still waiting beyond recommended time window 2nd shot? understand, MLB depends ticket revenue leagues like NFL NBA, likely buying time try get fans buildings season teams. It’s money, far riding it. government chose opt EU’s vaccination scheme massive outcry across political spectrum. intensified vaccine task force headed Kate Bingham, wife Conservative MP. Accusations putting Brexit saving lives cronyism rampant. 

Of course, turned nonsense. Opting EU vaccination scheme considerable distance best decision government made, Kate Bingham turned good job. government needed happen. couldn’t afford vaccination efforts suffer kind failure. 

Doubling AstraZeneca, giving everything needed trusting would pull vaccine massive gamble. financial gamble, gamble nonetheless. Sources? 1 million deaths, crematoriums would busy order magnitude higher. haven't. listened latest podcast I’m sure we’re enough sequencing able say much widespread variant US right now. Yeah US citizen good can't get one. understanding difference Pfizer vaccine developed Pfizer produced distributed Pfizer (a private company). AZ vaccine actually developed Oxford university, dug company. rights produce basically put tender British government able insist doses produced uk would go uk first. 

The reason it’s gone badly eu dragged heels negotiations signed 3 months uk signed AZ. extra 3 months spent fixing production supply issues uk supply chain. doesn’t seem unreasonable uk benefit that. I'll say - found moron  Yeah world-beating death rate real endorsement study citing analyzes March April 2020, basically measures used counteract spread coronavirus. People things normally, shut things down. surprisingly, completely normal in-person school caused spread school nobody it. 
 
The CDC study (and many studies) analyze schools numerous measures place (masks, social distancing, staggered schedules, etc...), generally find schools younger children major drivers infection. 
 
You can't discount CDC got things wrong start pandemic. Lots doctors got things wrong early on, early death rates high. mean trust doctors. 
 
Even *do* discount CDC, countries generally kept schools younger children open, appropriate measures place, based guidelines CDC equivalents. two years ago decision made?? read 2mn entire month February. read wrong? feel less informed reading say like haven’t one world’s worse per capita death rates, frequently _the_ worst. remember idiot last president? huge billboard I26 SC says FACTS ≠ TRUTH. people living post-fact reality. thats good!

Brexit still gonna fuck us long term Nobody buy it. pretty crap vaccine used enough better stuff. Let's honest here. Lol heard US?

I know close badly things mismanaged UK US overall.

The UK way ahead vaccination per capita though. I'm glad guys. Right, it’s logistical nightmare. vaccines can’t get vax centers. Wow thought stop spread virus vaccinate people?

So bold, brave. Hey now, Amazon we're talking epitome ""I suck every job do, get promoted away"" We’re gonna fine... 154 games.  Wherever shall . . . . sure downvoted. 100% correct. know several co-workers, friends family members adverse effects. second jab last week. body aches chills 24 hours fine. don’t know fuck talking about. really think use dying probably logistics vaccine distribution instead managing crisis, way got organised short period time. Norway almost 3% 150k vaccinated far think (no numbers weekends, extrapolating). Slow, insanely so. Yup. Higher 90k initially projects certainly close 115. Max 7 day average 3500. plummeting due holiday surge waning, probably would expectation moving forward KNOWN PROBLEMATIC virus variant already well-seeded throughout country. seen yet happens places happens, understandably still (mistakenly) optimistic moment based today's metrics. willing take vaccines though? felt exactly like you. realised it’s perfectly reasonable think Brexit terrible idea eu fucked vaccination program. plus warmer weather well past holidays. Looks like Epidemiologist wrong. Ended 97k. claiming topical use baby powder caused ovarian cancer then? 

I'm curious works. exactly 'combative' demeanour? Provide specifics. made claims all, I've asked questions incorrect assertion. 

You one claiming position matter. one claiming 'fact check' assert truth opinion admitted incorrect indefensible. think misinterpreting correction faulty facts 'combat'. [archive link anyone trouble accessing article state health departments county health departments city health departments seem much organization states. people behind protest stopping others seeking immediate medical care. premeditated intentional. comparisons way. Nobody right stop another seeking legally prescribed medical care.

In free country us entitled medical care legally afforded us. people protesting absolutely trying prevent others medical rights know full well may die.

It political hateful honestly none business. Yet still trying stop people living trying deny potentially life saving vaccine.

I'll happy join everyone normalcy springtime. already expecting mid-December - - - variant variable arised. UK insist Oxford. understanding Oxford demanded sold profit. AstraZeneca (or pharmaceutical company considering linking Oxford) adhere Oxford's rules, otherwise receive formula.

The EU invested development BioNTech vaccine example, next completely hands off. companies decided. wanted sell profit? rights so. EU intervene. Texas Department State Health Services officials said boost doses due two factors: 30% increase Moderna vaccine that’s provided federal government one-time return 126,750 doses Pfizer vaccine Texas required set aside federal program vaccinating residents staff long-term care facilities.

I think Moderna vaccine increase might due putting doses vials. Maybe trying one state expanding states. I'm well aware that. general public mainstream media seem talking bit information. slightly confused wasn’t done earlier? Seriously? feel same. It’s hard even log onto computer work morning. reference Oregon...it probably late spring w/o underlying conditions get vaccines. Friends across river Washington appointments next week. NHS saving sorry arses again. Lol, what??

Many posts reading mentioned afraid even talk experiences fear labeled antivax whatever. Youre problem dude. Applying normalcy bias everything life productive realistic, dont expect ever understand that.  think good grasp information topic. 100% agree above. MRNA vaccine development 20 years.

MRNA vaccine switch structure mRNA match current virus. already working boosters African variants. It’s new technology. nice see teachers giving pretending push remote learning anything staying safe.

Professional athletes responsible educating kids. things vastly difference level importance society. Looks like second half company expected doses available single-digit millions second half February, Moncef Slaoui, top scientific adviser Trump administration’s vaccine development effort, said earlier month.

Did read comment? one said purely terms vaccinations we're well we've included issues EU experiencing? comment said, case vaccination rollout, prefer UK still member EU? posted concerning frustration brother following guidelines still ending dead, given great deal support. BUT, people everything typing caps ""need stop spreading lies misinformation"" telling ""I bet brother old fat""! many people also told ""It's like healthy people dying!"". appalling disregarding everyone except young healthy, meant mast lines sarcasm. No, get side effects all. think exit strategy vaccinate entire country, like everyone else. However unlike countries, vaccine rolled out, strategy near zero transmission possible. know, people don’t die reason. doubt many US would take shot lower efficacy could Pfizer Moderna, see US passing Pfizer, need sit afterwards, felt fine, side effects whatsoever. think individual. talking like cities seeing mass cremations deaths would come rural India. 

Mass cremations cities would noticed. Unbelievable obvious thing US. take paid day whenever want 180 hours per year (can buy more) unlimited paid sick leave including doctor visits, emergency leave something happens family etc. US tough workers? lot cheaper closing location...  covid mostly solved western nations, Africa South America excellent neews. couple points: know multiply efficacy fraction people vaccinated considering getting herd immunity, right?

If herd immunity threshold 70%+, likely is, vaccine uptake 70% (which isn’t crazy unrealistic), everyone took 70% effective vaccines would get us 50%, substantially less 70% threshold.

Additionally, get whiplash people spent *months* arguing isn’t dying hospital capacity, even mild COVID cause lasting damage, arguing death thing matters happy less effective vaccine.

Given Pfizer Moderna made distributed enough every eligible person US end July (if hit goals, given current trajectory confidence, seems likely), I’ll happily wait.  Typical......the Ultra Orthodox heading towards herd immunity old fashioned way. single shot offers protection single shot Pfizer. Well duh never ""you're safe distance"" guideline, best-fit answer given extremely hard keep people away one another. blindingly obvious people still going get sick that. program school chose remote learning students ambiguous hard determine right answers for. supposed 7th graders screw answers. want son losing interest learning needs go back. tough choice make. Hopefully increase 50 million number something like 100 million. that's wishful thinking haha. *some* local tourism. Family focused beachside locations busy (eg holiday parks). lot others seriously struggling, particularly NT WA.

Try looking graph released Tourism Australia earlier today, tell tourism hasn’t changed:  fighting resources manufacturing though. Better shift best ones. Pretty much sub's MO. He's talking total deliveries vaccines think. EU ordered 2.3 billion vaccines. 2 billion delivered 2021, remaining Q1 2022.

The EU still make deal NovaVax 200 million doses Valneva 60 million doses, figures may end higher. can't mention J&amp;J efficacy sub, people bought J&amp;J stock downvote hell. :) mean EU outsmarted? best action. want EU like USA. places less eliminated virus without vaccines? obviously best approach economy save lives. Hopefully learn future. US sooooooo broken.

How something like news? WTF? something standard country almost developed world EU first line. That's vaccine nationalisms want that. that's exactly UK doing. 

EU got best effort contract knowing UK factories available. deliver UK according UK contract. EU paid pre production, get 60% less. 1.3M immune. comparison would around 1.9M Pfizer Moderna. Massive respect everyone working frontlines right now. you, country literally would’ve collapsed - NHS, key workers everyone else bit splinter keeping everything together. 

Shame energy wasted fighting government’s incompetence. Using Dutch government's delivery schedule, around 75 million Janssen Q2 (Europe). 
Keep mind divide BioNTech numbers two want compare Janssen.

Q3 numbers important anymore. quite lot deliveries, end Q2 almost enough vaccines entire EU adult population. Correct. reports I've read suggest number cases dropped significantly over-60s, including serious + critical ones, numbers continue fall work way younger population. Monday, Tuesday &amp; Wednesdays though... Which, time actually gets approved shipped, many people US getting first dose Pfizer/Moderna day.

Every bit helps, 2 million could gobbled couple days. Read article then. like talk past effect present, right now.

I never said past effect. said past influence vaccine distribution. making points history, causes inequality, great unrelated individual risk profiles people living today. Vaccinating tribe/Nation sloppy racist demographic data idiotic. Vaccinating tribe/Nation racism historical grievances idiotic. 

Members tribes/Nations vaccinated based current risk influenced likelihood getting infected anticipated health outcome, like everyone else be. us pointing back March ruthlessly shouted down. look happened? Almost year passed, states countries locked nothing show it, yet millions lives ruined many risk starvation. Shameful. Wonder percentage vaccinated got covid got SA variant compared rest population.  wondered people carried 2/3 price  happy cake day!   Well, us know experience ""sick"" body's response. way, get sick, COVID. Counterpunch.org radical lib trash. 25% people probably thought queue supermarket embarrassed say anything got front. CureVac production site Tübingen, understand it. Bayer production top probably available Germany EU completed initial 2021 vaccination campaign (late year). might need booster shots later maybe Bayer help those. maybe doses meant export.  Ding ding ding! sympathy anyone goes holiday global pandemic. People like reason got bad. You’d think someone old would know better. Talking Europe Must nice getting vaccines government paid for. UK meant millions doses AZ standby end last year. ended thousand. turns scaling vaccine production hard, even start three months late. going study respiratory samples China August 2019 like Italy? post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Absolutely. fact, that’s typically common way virus transmitted: general conversation. almost fell chair merely offering suggestion different strategy could use better help entire world rather host rich countries. 

Keep mind, historically west treated so-called third world countries well either. nations poor due lack resources, others poor resources extracted rich nations governments destabilized western militaries. inconsistent ideology Hoping best end thing everywhere. realise deaths age 50 account around 1% deaths, right? chance dying age 0.002%? Sure, covid *occasionally* kills someone younger common enough continue warrant damaging restrictions. I'm saying lift restrictions right saying risk people vaccinated end February something least talking end restrictions relatively near future? restrictions done colossal amount damage, people serious risk protected absolutely cannot go on. way desperation now. great high vaccine numbers, never first place.

This info Tory wants receive. Anything goes wrong, blame vaccine instead bad leadership decagon-making skillset. 

The bad news is: new variants smart handle even theory. 

So, follow strategy? calling entire countries ""rule breaking"", euphemism ""dishonest"". Without single shred evidence justify this. Slovenia ""rule breaking""? Czech Republic? Switzerland? excluded correlation suit stereotypes southern europe latin America?

Quite weird wokest PC newspaper around explicitly xenophobic understand single shot dramatically better production distribution dual shot yes?

You also understand it’s also possible 70% could due SA variant, tested? Moderna Pfizer weren’t tested new variants?

It’s also worth pointing J&amp;J stay good regular refrigerator months instead deep cold storage. 

By mile, better option getting herd immunity. goal doesn’t getting rid COVID. goal be, stopping covid killing people overwhelming hospitals. it’s 70%, doesn’t mean failed 30% people. 100% people trial lived. 

The best vaccine one get arm soonest. shocked registering biopsy. two insurances one covers 80 one covers 20% (and pay 2k month coverage). person registering could find first plan said could see plan would pay $3200 20% would $800 would need paid biopsy would performed? knew second insurance okay 3 hours took new outsourced billing department find it, barred getting biopsy , unless paid $800. time located second policy reschedule. bothered second insurance $800 would able get biopsy. hospitals chain region, fact 300 miles closest state funded hospital would work payment plan. many people cancer drive 300 miles care? come find out, lots carpool even insurance denied care locally 20% high deductibles paid care given monopoly chain. always thought maternity, cancer, emergencies could turned away sure $$. Right people aged 70 above, people pre-existing medical conditions.

I think criteria thus crux it. almost year. I'm sorry, comment rich coming you. arguing Alaskan Nation vaccinating young members, 18+, employees profit company somehow justifiable based history. Even teachers higher risk peoples Alaska able get vaccinated. arguing go age risk?! 

So bad rich nations, vaccines go age across world, except comes sovereign tribes get vaccinate whoever hell want irrespective vulnerable? actually considering odds, conclude likelihood three vaccines give higher percentage protection 0% get refusing them.  think ""in EU"" right. mainly producing EU. Makes sense shared border Order J&amp;J produce Moderna vaccine shitcunts

Like Australian elegant. Must New Zealand still pass virus people, use hospital resources.  people lockdown virus big threat personally,  lockdown protect vulnerable relieve pressure hospitals. Going holiday Barbados kind undermines that. submission linking nypost.com automatically removed source may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

Aaallll righty then. It’s ages since proper night anyway, fuck, miss that. lot people really angry. general elections March lot people want vote parties stop support.

If ok ask, party trust join Haredim except Liebermann? I'm saying like him, I'm saying I'm looking options. no, trust Meretz here, support Haredim's child support. take J&amp;J’s vaccine, sick would get got COVID vaccine due lower efficacy? oh god, did. whoops. swear i’m good person! Offered different received well. think job Australia done toward eradication? Certainly seems better rest world.  correct answer. 

Source: former fast food manager blindfold  notion lockdowns save many lives *world* possible, false panacea. selfish short-sighted strategy based fear, benefit privilege few. Lockdowns giving us false sense control putting millions people living margin risk. You’ll fine. I’m baby comes feeling sick get anyone can. unlikely UK paid AZ break contract. seems entirely figment imagination.

New information that's come recently closely UK AZ worked - manufacturing UK/Oxford plants started February 2020 handshake deal, even though signed contracts May. full 6 months EU signed miscalculated something. (1366 / (1 / 6 d)) / 365 = 22 a. Curtailing movement 5 6 weeks ""magic formula"" rather one used others successfully elsewhere. thing getting 30% infected number from? CDC puts US cases ~26 million less 8% population,  Good eu Nothing agreement Oxford forcing India ship 60 million vaccines. \*political\* decision. looked funny, end, least he's wearing right... Everyone saying yes study evidence around this. various theories aerosols droplets everything. conclusive studies. FBI, also Wisconsin, whatever licensing board pharmacists. need look future make sure kind stuff happen again. Thought exact thing!     Yeah... they're safe one them. believe politicians big part problem.  bed China. you’ve dropped argument (lies) study, thinking wouldn’t read it. you’ve moved making anecdotal evidence. 

No wonder US near bottom OCED education rankings. predict EMA approve reason?

Are moving narrative now?

If CDC requires efficacy within 10% Pfizer think big pharma spend money clinical trials, hope they'd get better result time? indication efficacy reach 85% - otherwise throws previous trials jeopardy well.

They're dumb. Weather man predicts rain. Populace stays inside utilizes umbrellas. many heads dry? Uhm... No. 

Switzerland here, new school clusters every day here. Almost new clusters coming schools now. 

The reason keep open parents want kids home 24/7. Yep. Pro virus. reason pro virus pro human. Oh, pro ""a"" human. Namely, selfish self. pro humans general, thinking chance catching dying (which get wrong selfish people often can't think straight, that's another issue). Humans, rest us, think others. Others might kill selfishness. Others might work hospitals triple shifts, driving ground selfishness. Others working selflessly protect us developing vaccines. you, eh, little Ayn Rand devotee? Well, that's ""pro virus"". want get team human anytime, sure let rest us know grown up. Super cool. saw that, wish schools would take seriously did. I’m sure preemptive testing helpful managing cases. 

Most schools don’t that. buy uv light turn twice week shields students carry around say that’s need. 

Some still don’t require masks. 

All I’m saying data anything clear.

Edit: also I’m curious haven’t followed New York much since then... done since early on?

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Yeah. Unfortunately that’s case I’m finding across Wales. Even larger cities South, one know really knows what’s going hope get letter saying come jab. worry they’ll focus pumping numbers compete rest UK slow people get second dose. might lose taste hours fucking thigh bones hurt. I've never conscious feeling thigh bones before. miserable. can’t think purpose article trash US “loose society” seems term author made up. Chick-Fil-A drive managers. 

Seriously vaccine deployment backed Amazon Chick-Fil-A would end American definitely efficient method ever dreamt of. also need factor loss happy life years. What's point living permanent lockdown like Europe allowed actually live. I'd sacrifice least 10% (my number probably even higher 100%, would die year earlier 2020 happen) actual life year replace 2020, vastly outnumbers ~4 life years lost per covid death holds population wide.

I think sustained lockdowns worth many reasons. Right body, choice. don’t understand newsworthy. isn’t adding anything already public discourse vaccines. Lol okay. hometown zero deaths less 150 cases last spring opening school year. 

Opened school, shot 1,000 cases 50 deaths. 

Closed schools everything went back normal. Less five active cases today. 

But I’m sure opening school absolutely nothing that, right? probably people going one local caseys. Can’t order Uber eats? It’s working great Silicon Valley. take weekend trip house Tahoe stock food insta cart. /s symptoms like chills, body aches fever. Swelling around effective tissue technically body response. right, relatively less well governments justified lockdown incomprehensible, Lebanon lockdown people allowed leave homes even purchase food medicines (during first lockdown), basically state sanctioned murder people right defend agression. But..... mercury comes earth. matter one. child loved one. tragic heart breaking want point people aged 0 34 make 0.8% covid deaths. 32% 85+, 60% 75+, 81% 65+ 93% worked McDonald's, still qualified Medicaid even two raises promotion. year working there, offered health insurance exact insurance plan already receiving state, would pay couple hundred month it. seriously thought joke first. point people like neighbor complaining seeing difference masks know actions driving community R0 significantly. mean whatever want privacy home argue argues disingenuous. fact arguments makes disingenuous.  

He asked could tell time real life think masks curbed spread.  actually pertinent example work really powerful there. shared still dismissed it. 

In office pretty high mask compliance past 4 months multiple Covid cases people seemed gotten outside work. Yet work virtually zero community work despite work presymptomatic phase somewhat close contact. 

The one documented case community spread visiting employee went number groups employees day meetings catch-ups.  One group sat cup coffee snacks (no masks point obviously) 3/5 got Covid know of.  one else office got Covid. Lol Osterholm tv claiming new wave imminent, thinks experts optimistic, claimed Israeli data suggested 33% chance protected 1 shot. Thinks anti-covid measures last late 2022+ sound callous, good luck getting franchisees give lip service. family get COVID-19 employed franchise darn near circus routine paid guaranteed law. Oh, mind work tested positive. Pro-virus? people actually believe?

Greater chance dying car accident virus 30’s don’t see many people boycotting driving. attempt keep people scared. going upvoted posts deny downplay severity long term danger plague get votes sub.  That’s goal. wouldn’t lockdowns extreme mitigation measures severe non-fatal respiratory disease. 

Normal life may happen 2021 yet. Expect greedy Irish landowners export vaccines countries, Irish complain centuries English let die. practical terms probably made guidelines naming viruses MERS, guidelines variants. Perhaps introduced. Yes. electrifying. many countries ""just 10% 20% efficiency"" required? co-ordinate global lockdown ensure every country sticks it? questionable moral standpoint.

Could expand this? morally questionable? There's handful people placebo group die. Statistically speaking pretty inaccurate say vaccines prevent death. people take surely die COVID even number much less. anyone else know anyway. variants might included small numbers virtue circulating unknowingly Phase III testing. country lockdown since last February. Guess what? Everything increased. covid rate, unemployment, poverty, crime. target 72 hours, 24 bad. 

I got mine 18 day. 

But surprising shambles start - exist created nothing speed. always creates shambles. 

Scaling nothing hundreds thousands difficult consider logistics needed assemble kits, let alone suppliers scaling production well. 

Although coding error stupid. not. Please stop lies. God profession determine ruin remaining goodwill. 

It’s study effectiveness government covid actions. study spread covid schools. Well first says data available goes make recommendation. So, literally makes recommendation without data. scientist? sorry loss. shameful dismissive people are. Sigh. AZ promised best efforts.

Don't allow pawn U vdL blame avoidance games.

AZ making vaccine profit. making money all. 

Be grateful fuck sake. I'd like try proper discussion I'll bite - admit first post response guy complaining lockdowns relatively kneejerk comprehensively outline position lockdowns.

Totally fair. I'll extend courtesy. understand, every lockdown skeptic 5G Bill Gates Nazi type, right facing stereotype matter lightly push back measure, us limiting conversation reactive it. live US, currently live EU country improper vaccine roll-out **their** mistakes, life up-ended, making us feel reply stated lockdown 100% stop economic activity, restrict movements people working non-essential industries. Food, shipping, utilities - need continue strict supervision ensure spread virus. point buying something online forcing others ""work me"" leg stand - that's entire purpose lockdown. people like work home essential industries continue proper health protocols ensure spread virus halted.

I'm sorry, buy something essential? one examples, used India country 'improper' lockdowning. country heavy manufacturing comfort Western countries, country poor sanitation, expectation multigenerational households, poor health infrastructure, high levels low education, destitute poverty. would lockdown response could saved people, millions India, basic task like gathering clean water communal activity. homes. Save shooting rounding camps, COVID destined endemic them. point is, using terminology like 'selfishness' work here, locking one-size-fits-all solution societies. cannot globally work. I'm well aware costs SMEs F&amp;B businesses incur agree people hardest hit lockdowns. I'm opinion governments set aside aid smaller businesses declare moratoriums loans specific tax bracket. Countries like Canada got right ensuring population receives adequate sustained aid throughout pandemic.

Again, aid packages applicable literally billions people, expectation endless money printing undefined time COVID eradicated threat austerity coming generations. Western governments continuously cutting social safety nets, particularly health disability service sectors. expect accumulating costs in, say, country like UK lead this? hacking away NHS decades. partially causing mess. citizens countries know this, faith happen, would support lockdowns aid packages may come threat welfare take lockdowns going implement it, properly ensure sufficient enforcement protocols thought prepared for. There's point forcing small businesses, eateries, bars close penalize render lockdowns inefficient flouting social distancing proper mask protocols. Lockdowns useless harm good prepared what's necessary.

Many countries good fortune 'doing properly' also incredibly quickly. rest us luxury anymore, countries **did** quickly mercy countries vaccine distribution bare minimum opening borders. mention clusterfuck literally tens thousands citizens stuck abroad waiting repatriation flights. still hovering around **40,000** Australians stranded, last checked. Yes, saved lives, applauded take away them. again, myopic approach causing financial emotional stress thousands families, certainty get better. Canada is, belatedly, following footsteps $2,000 4 night minimum quarantine hotels travelers two PCR tests must approved government. heading family separation crisis COVID already **in** country, essentially created wealth tax poor rich trouble forking kind money. tests alone take lockdowns going implement it, properly ensure sufficient enforcement protocols thought prepared for. There's point forcing small businesses, eateries, bars close penalize render lockdowns inefficient flouting social distancing proper mask protocols. Lockdowns useless harm good prepared what's necessary.

But point 'people flouting rules' basic science country like Germany France lock **soon** enough, close bordering neighbors Italy, would inevitably spread countries exist propogate anyway? COVID highly transmissible, EU duty Schengen Zone would difficult decide close without properly explaining populace facts COVID. country enough detected, likely late lockdowns regardless, matter much people comply work stopped essential services stopped. lockdowns doomed fail, think fool's game blame average person this.  November, governor cuomo came said 20 percent cases could trace, 1.8 percent coming schools something. said couldn’t trace 80 percent cases didn’t wonder came from. 

They set random testing order keep schools open. 9 positives testing would close school. Funnily, positives received outside sources wouldn’t counted towards nine, 22 cases since January 1st, 14 campus contagious period, counted school stayed open. saw number one reports thought could ship 100 million doses April sounds like around 1 million per day.

And think wait March. efficacy numbers another report said would apply emergency use week. Yea. Ohio fine. opened vaccines 80 year olds. 100,000 vaccines available 400,000 folks 80. state immediately opened 65 older plus teachers. immediately threw 2.2 million people pot. Ohio receiving nowhere near amount vaccines. Making mandatory teachers would push lot 65/80 year old groups back queue. Well weird strange word use case talking efectiveness think agree AZ vaccine ""worse"" Pfizer's. course benefits like easier storage, I'm talking efectiveness virus. data many people scrambling? article bunch anecdotes. lying piece shit. plain ignorant.

When UK realistic school spread are, know problems. get lockdown forever. manufacturing least month two, saw report 2 million doses ready ship think produce 100 million April sounds kind like 1 million per day. manufacturing issues earlier hopefully past that. Yeah. Wales' rollout seemed patchy. Friends one town vaccinated, town one town vaccinated all. It’s excellent question. vaccinator teachers -who Union , tell use sick time come clinic get vaccinated. Unfortunately clinic open 4pm. getting ready evening hours slow roll vaccine available fact 65+ right now, don’t feel need. Saturday hours limited also. I’m contract worker health dept nurses County, “normal” business hours. county nurses control vials, mixing, main freezers etc, large responsibilities fall them. Or, sunnier side things, 2 million people die. 

All vaccines far almost entirely eliminating possibility getting killed virus, nearly hospitalizations. 

I'd take J&amp;J shot today Pfizer course month now. Yeah, this. 

But guy right course - Reddit all. need least 3 weeks window shots. Kinda impossible 6 days pro-vaccine man, refuse absolutely vaccinated AZ even worse J&amp;J. Never. 

EU produces enough effective vaccines. EU enough money buy expensive vaccine. scientific leaps forward, finishing research 10 years ago defunded people forgot last mostly prevented pandemic. true means system grossly underfunded despite imminent results active loss human life great numbers. IMO serves highlight fundamentally broken nature global healthcare system profit maximization approach taken. think Worldometer (or tracking sites) give accurate count many people died month. kinds delays reporting (not mention likely undercounting). instance, worldometer Iowa reporting 250 deaths January 31st -- clearly backlog earlier. I've heard struggles Germany hope well.

If consolation, might jealous us particular moment, we've jealous last year so. thought Brooklyn haha sa virus still counteracted higher rate first two vaccines. zero risk there. never be. 66% effective vaccine sounds like evolutionary pressure wide avenue escape. can't get everyone J&amp;J could worse world long run. entirely depends value R virus whole. virus shown escape strategies already plasma/antibody treatments. 

J&amp;j might buy us time vaccinate follow stronger vaccine, currently know safe, either. could also go way. use antibiotics got us MRSA, want create environment use bad tools send covid threshold superbug territory.

Hopefully cdc give strong guidance here, that's based science politics. see math working out, good. really surprised scheduled appointment second dose appointment scheduled along it. Doubles work good reason. point is, many people die long term due covid, factoring *all long term complications*.

Take Australia's recent death - died recently due exposure March last year. Hardly countries world would even count one.

If going include every person dies due tangentially related causes traced back lockdowns pandemic, equivalent number comparing no-lockdown scenario?

Literally every vaccine manufacturer ramping fast can.

Not expecting glitches incredibly naive.

Ursula van der Layan history blaming others get failures. another example that.

Notice EU serviced Pfizer. EU fuck slow incompetent.

The missing doses AZ would cover fraction Europe's shortfall.

Stop blaming one little profit company Pfizer selling doses ten times cost AZ anyway, doubling vaccinating Isreal first. Compares average salary educator average salary athlete...

It seem society agrees sentiment. sounds pretty accurate reasonable comments.

Basically Biden redirecting things focused strategy, also benefiting trial-and-error previous administration. 

GET DAMNED VACCINE TRAIN 🚂 CHOO CHOO  go public right now. Go! Exactly. good spokesperson. message constantly changes always negative. advisor someone spokesperson.

Because goal post shifting saying things like humans may never shake hands still need remain lockdown, wear masks, avoid travel even getting vaccine, undermining credibility influence also undermining people's confidence vaccines. middle class can’t push burden onto poor anymore. isn’t right. 

I bet every one teachers would raise holy hell poor treated way, refusing go work grocery stores feed plants create goods buy. clarify: good, scientifically grounded useful sociology. piece that. wonder took chemo treatment dr cancer sure, Biden can't perform miracles. unfortunate side effect elected: immediately blamed current situation despite nothing it.

On flip side, get take credit anything good previous administration bears fruit present.

In case, talking exclusively Moderna even available, due Operation Warpspeed etc. That's literally it.

Whereas bad news is, little strategy around maintaining steady flow supply, Biden fix thin air little time possible. Hence people across US complaining lack supply / huge vaccination centers standing still times.

But yeah despite that, want optimistic get board ""it's finally happening"" train. U.S. best - breaking big guns production distribution (if little late). 250 million total doses delivered end June EU/EEA countries. Pfizer/Biontech confirmed different countries. European supply chain serving whole world except US China, course number doses end countries. values (I mean, find contract)? listed 24 million Pfizer vaccines. includes new 20 million order. many total Pfizer vaccines Canada order originally? 4 million? literally study looking effective methods slowing R0, second largest impact shutting schools. 

But doesn’t fit narrative “it isn’t schools”. incentive, however, available workers McDonald’s locations owned McDonald’s corporation, 5% company’s total workforce. remaining 95% workers employees franchise owners.

Had idea McDonalds ran restaurants all. Thanks this. clears things statistically, really frustrating knowing things get small part country. realise less populous place, slower response. want information government plan around doesn’t immediately get contradicted local councils medical professionals. Whole Foods near buffet thing open months now. wear gloves cordoned one person go time. really see risk terms Covid. find confusing mention total number EU set receive Q2.

Thank you! Wait happened body choice? U.K. complaining ask yourselves....

If information government Jan none us seen Pandemic 100 years several false alarms last 10:

When would shut border? 

When would brought lockdown? would enforced it, would enforce masks? would get sanitiser? Would got vaccines ordered delivered well?

I don’t believe majority bitching ever make decision impacted another persons livelihood. tell otherwise you’d show fucking nuance whining heard 2% dropping Novavax trial Jan. 20th. 1% general population dropped bad. updated numbers please let know.

Some info trial: 

* 11,000 participants enrolled Jan. 20th 65+ year olds dropping phase 3 trial access vaccine (2% total participants Jan. 20th)
* 16,000 participants enrolled Jan.28th expects fully enrolled mid-February  test system longer shambles grant (although I'm pretty sure there's still issues people wait 24 hours result) beginning also bit shambles. Taking week get test result, taking long ramp capacity, fixing numbers tests done (eg every test sent counted test even returned) etc etc. way.around. would think troops deployed defend vax stations instead making sure everyone take shot? That's fucky math bro. 1 million people 6 days means take 22 years vaccinate entire country. maybe still plans shipment 1.2 million doses AZ vaccine EU I'm sure yet, I'd expect announced have.

They're still making progress already covid come contact someone currently gym spread family home never it? Assuming get reinfected? think SA strain we'll see reinfections, like going create full pandemic again. Vaccines natural immunity block cases, mediate significantly many cases (subclinical) cause reinfections some. we'll make South African Brazilian variants mutation (known E494K) changes spike protein makes possible sometimes evade antibodies would react standard covid-19. Spend 10 minutes less look up. Yes you. pfizer moderna papers showed side effects stronger 2nd shot. yeah. guess would ""pro-lockdown"" rich countries, least level restrictions. live third-world country firmly believe good nation *any* community transmission yet. like vietnam thailand did. hard early. there's established infection eradication major cities unbelievably difficult. melbourne one richest cities earth rooting via shutdown took 100+ days. can't dhaka delhi lagos manila. even governments rich enough pay everyone's food can't deliver without making people gather. best adopt long-term measures like mask distribution watched federal vaccine rollout video January 20th unveiled information.

Novavax - quote press release Jan. 22nd ""The company expects supply NVX-CoV2373 Canada beginning early second quarter 2021, following authorization Canada’s regulatory agency."" Netherlands say go doctor that’s guess Europe everywhere. lol know? like travel capital city get tested, know, infrastructure functioning health system. 

Surely theory someone would tested positive now, even fragments detected sewage watch organized Tokyo subway station pre-pandemic even rush hour it’s clear Gonna cross 100 million doses given threshold today.

USA outside chance hitting 40M end week. (darn blizzards might stop goal)

We cross 10 doses per 100 end tomorrow states cross 15.   sure got downvoted. Sorry hear that. True, also I’m mistaken getting reinfected like struck lightning there’s reason anytime happens makes news Unfortunately lot people. sacrificed kids anxiety imo. course did. anyone think 6ft magic barrier? aerosol droplets plummet ground?   I’ve colds year normal. don’t think good particular immune system. 

One kids got sort stomach bug maybe 70% vaccination, definitely vaccination + natural infections. Hopefully, supplies logistics place achieve that, even are, unfounded fears vaccines may make difficult. [IPSOS December indicated less 70% adults Germany, France, Italy Spain would willing take vaccine. Hopefully number rise people understand better benefits. One year extremely significant portion short life. send people prison year major crimes.

No. estimate 70% vaccination US? bet june Best information I've seen COVID-19 spreads. NFL collected LOT data made good use it. Surprised duration contact seem matter. Masks, distance, ventilation things watch. Twist: full time employees, majority McDonald's workers part time give benefits. (Not sure true feels like is) Yes, facts bollocks.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  20M max even 3 get approved. 

My guess Q2 deliveries

* Oxford: 1-6M Q2, Canada ordered 20M
  * Rationale: AstraZeneca seems doling doses per capita basis. EU (population 447M) getting 40M doses Q1 80M doses Q2. Canada near back line get early doses lot. Europe getting manufacture signed earlier. look see Canada way list, notice part COVEX could seeing early doses. 
* J&amp;J 1-5M Q2, Canada ordered 10M
  * Rationale: J&amp;J months behind production delivering single digit doses US February. ramp 100M doses US June scheduled produce 2B doses 2021. Canada third country sign deal them. getting doses expect lot. 
* Novavax: 1-11M Q2, Canada ordered 52M
  * Rationale: Novavax getting ready ramp production scheduled produce 150M doses May June. 2B doses 2021 1B made India. US enough doses end May early June entire population. think could see 1M doses coming Canada May 10M doses coming Canada June. think approve Novavax time soon multiple reasons.

They clearly signed thinking they'd able scale pace EU wanted, not. also signed contract appears conflict UK contract already signed. 
 
Should EU signed contract earlier? hindsight answer obviously yes. AZ still signed contract. going get pick. EU already early agreement Novavax 100 millionen Doses option 100 millionen more. ( hole 
negotiations kept really dark)
The supply chains production already set . EU Novavax still negotiating, likely responsibilities Novavax. big issue Pfizer/Biontech, really money , per european law companies responsibile
for products degree especially american companies resistent except that. UK US take responsibilities themselves. bare minimum. McD still shitty company deserves respect many reasons. think base ingredient Oxford vaccine produced sent EU? clue name. common term comes ""Poverty porn"", feel like appropriate term exists. basically glorying people exerting enormous effort compensate lack baseline support systems.  vast majorit us immagrants tho. state governments strong emergency powers (ours largely state level, national responses). also forced vote, trust little Americans do. still strong sense comradery, early times, guess roughly summarised ""mateship"" (with various obvious flaws). reason high minimum wages strong safety net, free health care etc. package deal, basically. 

Most americans I've met dont want go back except family reasons, may self selecting sample. 

But see serena williams recent comments lockdown american take happening here. either comment 😬 r/boringdystopia Haven’t country earned holiday? makes special? state using saliva tests - anyone state order one sent home. sure it’s one developed Yale though. Article's old - 6 days ago - still holds. close support given, restaurants made pay alcohol licence... even closed, on. Singapore done well average stopping covid19. I'd take opinion junior dog catcher Singapore president countries. article said us elder participants dropped became legible approved vaccines &amp; novavax said enought slow trail. troubles like turning usa resevered vax roll right out...

 wonder rejoined study. gives 2 3 chance vaccination, usual 1 2. country? Surging covid cases despite lockdown? country this?    Well, said reached 10 doses per 100 people US end January, would go forward outdoor wedding June sure.

We're like 9.7. close! crazy thought 10 would almost impossible. Pretty cool.

Now Osterholm could stop terrifying half country peddling doom extreme... Nope. I've heard things come Fauci's mouth. self admitted liar. dishonest way frame happened. Lockdowns beginning made sense would enforced followed. Lockdowns totally different ballgame. Pointing would consequences “lockdown” (please define term accurately...you would first) like saying sky blue. Nuance hard come around here. many schools giving kids covid tests? imagine kids asymptomatic, problem imagining schools paying conducting testing. spouse works university found many cases among young adults discovered reported school decided screen themselves. going look, going find evidence. idea flagged high-quality information.... Hungary already approved Russian Sputnik V Chinese Sinopharm vaccines. fact, Sputnik V vaccine may approved coming months EMA.  “New variant infects turtle; means *never* return normal” Booster shots probably available late year. Nothing formally said needs go trials again. think may need since vaccines still fairly new granted emergency approval rather usual full approval process. FDA regulatory bodies may say needs go whole approval process again. Pure speculation though. 

But new variants prevent us normality. unlikely new variant make vaccine totally useless likely reduce efficiency vaccines massive deal. mesn reduced efficiency better efficiency booster shots always given later date boost immunity further. Well can't forcibly inject people want it. I've lived Manila, Makati near greenbelt, love country many persons living poverty zero governmental assistance. lockdown forces people starvation. Yeah read study. need professor read study. God uh.. works mysterious ways. able prevent multiple dead loved ones die significantly earlier mental illness poverty

One interesting divisions scientific history occurred immediately WWII.

Considering teachers spent months end insisting they’re least essential workers entire country, really right claim they’re essential workers purpose getting vaccine.

2. trust teachers would actually go work getting vaccine? (Even promise ahead time.)

  honestly think that, getting vaccine, teachers come excuses keep schools closed. Fauci: “I Don’t Think Ever Shake Hands Again” think spreading covid via surfaces common probably not. mean unless spending whole day sick patients etc see reason Even new strains vaccines still seem 100% effective preventing hospitalization death (see J&amp;J results). 

And cares need booster shot point? People get flu shots every year, shut society it.  So? still government's responsibility step bridge gap anti-transmission measures basic human welfare, first week 10th month.

Why virus experts change tune virus can/will do, merely parts civilization failing duty make measures bearable? I’m thinking baseball probably fans year half capacity people wearing masks/distancing.

Imagine post heroin :F Problem stop deaths, efficacy tests long term effects virus post vaccine. one prevents life long lung, erectile dysfunction, vascular heart problems I'm going want vaccine rather J&amp;J prevents dying.

However understand reasoning. chances go everyone becomes vaccinated, reduced risk death means people become infected reach herd immunity safer quicker. kind torn thing.

All said. I'm tired shit. number comes gladly accept whatever vaccine presented with. still wear mask, remember peeps, studies regarding a-symptomatic spreading get vaccine. 50% would enough FDA approve vaccines.[The FDA would approve 50% efficacy safe - third bullet point think misunderstood ""bullshit"".

This disgusting disinformation you. apologise retract

But glad used logic selling profit immoral. use logic EU companies

Please answer: rich countries get vaccine makes EU's approach moral? Depends we're ready share.

That’s response limited pointing saying something ‘right wing’ ‘left wing’ doesn’t really add understanding whether makes sense not.

What? would providing source for? Yep like psychics... predict disasters every turn might right one day heralded genius. Spring Death?  MLB baseball beginning April 28th now. mean everyone able fans would think considering south fans since September. South/Midwest May open full capacity maskless see much maintain vaccine rollout transmission rates decline. true politicians understand that. Alas, overly optimistic promises made gullible and/or desperate politicians regarding delivery timelines amounts interpreted actual amounts goals. them. I'm sure lot suspicion - like anything outside world.  least do. (Sad) like _jab!_ 💉💉 schools aren’t normal 9 months we’ve started vaccinated adults, pathetic. zero interest sending kid school mask year. slow? read it. know, I'm jew (but secular) kind news makes sad (but mainly angry) cause raise anti-semitism. Although understand why. community thinks laws rules apply them. pandemic disaster. No, masks math. 1 bad mask + 1 bad mask equal 1 good mask! double two bad masks create pressure air take path least resistance, means rush open sides loose-fitting top/bottom surgical cloth masks.

You want \_one\_ good mask real NIOSH rating, like KF94, KN95, N95 mask. masks built multiple layers, particular negatively charged plastic layer attracts virus particles far, far smaller holes mask. part masks work well get doubling two bad masks. addition form-fitting masks greatly reduce gaps sides top, there's way air bypass filter media.

If believe me, carefully watch review engineer's videos (Aaron Collins): masters thesis mask efficiency tools expertise test masks (which done channel). According Aaron \_should not\_ double two bad masks. \_should\_ wear one good mask like KF94, KN95, N95. No. needs maximize transmissability, increasing survivability one way that.  post vaccine world I’m interested pod. want normal school, masks, distancing. theory, vaccinated adults, shouldn’t issue. Thanks words :) worry, everything fine. vaccines need wait turn. Also, I'm neutral smell. neutral mean ""game changer"" missing rest life, sometimes notice it. great day forget stress reduces immunity :) [if want one super simple table point sucks wind “new normal” narrative encourages people vaccinate time, try rabbi fucking died  Strawman. That's argued.  bad reactions vaccines. FEMA? rock hiding under? WESTRALIA SHALL FREE! Hundreds cases millions vaccines administered means extremely minuscule severe side effect rate. Fractions useful skill. WA size lot larger countries. 

It's bloody huge. four times size Texas. could theoretically fit bulk Western Europe size. twenty times size England! 

In fact shire Durack, one counties Western Australia, size Mexico! think huge companies suddenly gaining conscience. optics impacts brand. Workers replaceable bad press. government officials US,CANADA EU said even vaccines NEVER return normal.

I think government officials scientists literally claimed ""never return normal"". like varying degrees optimism/pessimism timeline expect.

Do mean never completely globally eradicating it, becoming endemic? That's probably happen. still manage eventually prevent excess deaths happening ambitious vaccination program updated vaccines needed counter novel resistant variants.

So would say definitely matters! stay top Trump fan, pretty sure actually one ideas. Studies show work nearly well ones BionTech Moderns. Hopefully last peak. least 4 circulating strains coronavirus cause illnesses like common cold. need practice humility, actually even basic investigation things going speak authoritatively condescendingly about. everyone's sake, please stop spreading disinformation. Yep, stocked goods know would panic bought instant total fucking hogs like that.

Also, shops closing. wear mask *do* go shopping. Damn crazy McDonald's higher moral standards 1st world governments COVID personally affected me, cancer, drunk driving, actual flu, heart disease, etc., via family way another, make support lockdowns less. would prefer see expansive public health infrastructure healthier lifestyles encouraged, this. misleading headline. That's next many years (as many 50 years - article good job reporting tbe predictions). really crime MSM does. 5% 5 stores I'm sure worse....if actually believe legitimate comparison, know manipulative. Aka, fewer 1000 per year. fewer people NYC lost days closing down.

That said, absolutely work prevent helping people financially government programs taxing extreme wealth. since none wear fucking mask properly... probably good idea       
(this refers fast food, really) vaccine ever 100% usage rate history never will. also needed. acceptance rate US vaccine around 50% ish? That's almost herd immunity.  people also trust vaccines used decades one developed quickly. right hold want take early all. 

Also supply vaccine issue US? enough go around health care yet long time anyone else getting it. 

Once Healthcare immune compromised/elderly taken care issue overloading hospitals go away major killer, virus healthy people. Thats point I'm excited get to. Honestly, idea. worries also. pay lot taxes know outcome. hope many leave communities - happen government start put pressure them. happen reps members government. Holy shit. Biden prez... read many ways virus mutate loses fitness, gross simplification? quote infectious disease expert. welcome insight topic, wondering limits mutation sight forever masks norm here, required one specific situation - peak hours public transport. see masks anywhere else (and videos link) people done extra measures required currently here. that's argument start, argument ""everything normal Sweden"" clearly small part people normally see streets, restaurants malls. associate ""normal"" ""no masks"" that's bias, actual situation. Yep Novavax go India Canada Australia Philippines. Resist shit like this, immediately. like 15 seconds, 15 minutes. approved US... US almost entirely Pfizer Moderna little bit J&amp;J Idk suspect will. Snow really bad already gonna going 24 hours already dead :/ Yeah, can't really compare two numbers virus evolving getting stronger. Imagine comparing Olympic gold medalist gymnast 1992 silver medalist 2016. two went head head (at age), would better? example, silver medalist would probably win gold medalist due bar much higher 2016. say J&amp;J better Pfizer/Moderna, point is, can't really compare efficacy two different stages virus evolution simply. Asleep wheel? failure past policy. go pizza buffer normal life let alone pandemic good capacity increase keep shipping around world? countries take care populations first, EU take similar stance make sure whatever produced within Europe gets delivered first contracts fulfilled afterward play good samaritan. pretty much approach, UK US opted take, different case. Locking people year monstrous. pro-lockdown crowd callous indifference everything makes life living billions, slightly extend lives million. Logically work.Yoire putting another layer properly fabric outer layer forms better fit face. Ok cool I’ll believe see it. 

I used work franchise location high school packed moved college left didn’t job. Coming home winter break end last semester decided fuck it. work like month make extra money college. 

A couple weeks go work find friend met tested positive tell boss working time like hey don’t feel comfortable working would feel better got tested came back work. Boss says “we’re busy” tells get away everyone work cash window. promptly walk fuck potentially infect hundreds customers going see window day get tested SURE ENOUGH positive. 

McDonald’s give fuck workers. given extra bonus pay working fucking worldwide pandemic extra note fucking paycheck says “your heroes” fuck would grammatically correct. 

Maybe McDonald’s like franchise garbage. think issue US NHS is:

* UK NHS took awful lot money get running started. Big government investments require lot political capital.

* US nation seems place emphasis personal responsibility. also one of, not, obese countries world. Many would rightly ask taxes go towards correcting others' bad decisions.

* UK centralised. US lots different states diverse demographics geographies.

* gravy train private healthcare takes worst aspects free market government run system combines create ludicrously expensive inefficient systems protected army corrupt politicians. read US, private equity firms air ambulances. UK, they're run charities (but sort thing outside NHS).

Not say think bad idea, think would really hard set up. IMO, that's exactly going there. UK's ""go shopping holidays, wear mask outside"" attitude since November, leaders trying blame covid variant encouraged behavior populace. YES. lot people really angry. 
We general elections March lot people want vote parties stop support. There's still 50% wasted vaccines areas due unfreezing vaccines they're going bad used. really hope stand lines used vaccination locations obviate problem experts difficult time factoring human behavior aspects, many act like exist vacuum. Western countries ultra individualistic also flat don’t support needed lockdowns. Furthermore, year basically reach point many people fatigued stop caring, may sound crass it’s reality acknowledge one day Vault entire process really easy. received test day requesting it, took test next morning RN supervising Zoom (30 min tops suck spitting like me), sent via UPS maybe hour received test results day after. never thought spitting could hard well worth skull intrusion time issue. He’s always sky falling he’s also right often, don’t know actively infected either virus body sufficiently learned fight either one yet.

It takes time form complete immune response, even recovering virus.

Co-infections different versions virus commonly happen body time form immune response takes weeks.

This fairly basic virology. worried vaccines would huge mark ups like healthcare many people dont insurance house remortgage would go without.

May politely suggest get less information US Reddit? website full people straight lie it’s like portray everything literally negative light possible. ""Production problems"" ey?

More like, AZ sold many doses UK/EU have, shipped doses produced EU prior release UK fulfill delivery obligations ignoring fact supposed preproduce European approval.

It's funny EU last 5 years still learned thing political climate changed still tries friends everyone realizing mutual friendship.   Also hit pause human movement much possible aid process, unknown cases still traveling around state wants attention. That's kind depressing. issue. don’t get either. also heard prediction I’m like wtf supposed go like this. Jesus, what's pizza buffet? I'd think normal human could 2 maybe 3 slices pizza exploding. make buffet thing? UK variant currently fine job kicking Israel's butt. SA variant small numbers. really equitable way this. Vaccines require measure critical mass effective, spread vaccine available around world evenly would help almost one. fair helping certain countries others? see fair way this.

Under circumstances makes sense rich countries make investment, get infrastructure place use infrastructure expand rest world. I'm glad asked. Viruses lack components reproduce themselves. order make copies needs infect host hijack cells order reproduce. vaccinations today. always case. order stop spread highly infectious viruses vaccines, quarantines used separate infected uninfected. 

Quarantining denied virus access new hosts leaving virus unable reproduce. important note still number viruses highly contagious deadly vaccines for. date education quarantines primary method used combat virus outbreaks Ebola virus. Typical Reddit neckbeard probably happy social events cancelled  literally talking governments can't barely done allowed throw people jail posts online lmfao I-it-it’s not? unsure Pfizer vaccine really get us. read even country like Japan got screwed dosages sent back US instead.

But datas UK good. Indonesia main player GAVI, UK really contribute them, means UK help us lot developed country. Also AZ contribution India real deal, must applaud that. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

The answer no. LOL. This. Also, currently vaccine children.

Anytime. great week! actually read study endorsing popular science article cites it? No, haven’t actually read study it’s behind paywall. popular science article happens support preconceived notions, guess that’s need. Quit pseudo-intellectual bullshit. wait, recommended give them.

What? elderly vulnerable front line get vaccine dumb, anyone else uses moronic analogy. 

With virus, people affected 100% point. Sure might 30 get fine, literally cause people die, even don't, cause people die. 

The chain reaction much different car crash either complete idiot selfish prick, both, think good example use. I’ve socialized masked, think good thing do, especially people near breaking point.

However, feel like article referring people go huge parties refuse wear masks. view, lot fact mRNA first enter mainstream public awareness astonishingly high efficacy rate. first vaccine available Americans JNJ, hearing new vaccine 95% efficacy, think tone would immediately shift. think people broadly want perceived ""the best."" one gets excited perceived ""stop gap"" measure, JNJ decidedly public perception made appear such. Taken isolation JNJ enormous weapon virus. Thanks clarification. bias, take figures (taken government) independently difficult interpret different way interesting immunity builds time. Another couple weeks data even compelling suggesting lockdowns slow spread covid? honestly never looked seems pretty obvious. There's studies article: I'm familiar with, also obvious decreases cases following lockdowns.

Here's article north dakota: seems like put measures place dip probably caused it, random dip. upvoted commenters, kind extends far share narrative. rest selfish evil narcissists wish death upon everyone encounter, matter reasoning behind breaking rules may be. biggest teaching Union UK probably biggest teacher recruitment website Europe OK think previous poster saying really concluded yet scientific study, since asymptomatic people shown severe lung damage. Though intuitively seem people asymptomatic would likely lower incidence lung damage severe symptoms. Hopefully time tell. Interesting make guesstimate percentage Californians kind immunity virus point.

The CDC 1 every 4.6 Covid cases reported 2020. 

California reported 3.3-million confirmed cases. metric true California today, would mean 15.2-million Californians contracted Covid. 

Add 3.4 million vaccinated, 18.6 million Californians *some kind* immunity Covid. 

With population 39.51-million, that'd mean 47% state's population. 

NOW, run say ""Half California Immune!!"" -it's likely precentage Covid cases California reported in, say, December January, significantly higher national average 2020. We're far testing earlier pandemic, expect California testing per capita parts country. 

Also, obviously percentage vaccinated already contracted Covid. 

So, guessing, I'd say 4.6 multiplier probably high California, there's definitely overlap two numbers. much overlap? ""too high"" multiplier? idea. 

*However*, probably reasonable say substantial population state California somewhat-immune Covid, that's likely reason we're seeing drop infections, deaths hospitalizations state. 75 million come second batch(200 millions), first(300 milllion)

What mean?

For Germany numbers known

&amp;#x200B;

* Q1 10 millions Biontech
* Q2 25 millions(first batch) + 14 millions(from second batch)

Totally 50 millions, i.e. 30% Germany vaccinated end Q2(end July).

Additionally, expected delivery Astrazeneca Q1&amp;Q2 20 millions, i.e. + 12% German population.

Also, expected delivery Moderna Q1&amp;Q2 8 millions, i.e. + 5% German population.

Sum = **50% EU population vaccinated protected end(!) summer.**

I quite pessimistic. could safely tells others Thanks info!

Question: healthy Canadian mid-30s, expect vaccinated Christmas? make another covid summer, another covid winter I’m sure. anyone admits virus completely humanity’s control threw away society nothing, people might go insane now. question.. it’s listed 95%, mean it’s 100% effective 95% people, 95% effective people? combination? almost year late! Symptoms way less severe vaccinated though Bypassing standard testing procedure replacing de facto field test actual population would otherwise considered unethical still appreciate benefits progress helping achieve though. extent it’s deserved extent it’s not. 

The way people like Fauci almost exalted anyone says anything disagrees “denier” terrible public discourse come Taiwan reacted case, one talked learning lessons? thing China latest outbreak Singapore theirs. need learn Western countries? NZ one case go total lockdown, handled differently, can't learn that? Link? Maybe reach 700,000 “fringe cases” child abuse, especially ones locked abuser imagine 9 year old abused able leave house since last march. Nobody coming check you, schools set remain closed indefinitely, adults life, protecting you, scared give 99.5% survivable virus.

Well people sure shit changed behavior 57%. seriously think die, easy choice talking decisions politicians blaming ""virus experts"".

If think decisions instead based ""economics experts'"" input, weight public concern regular families' bottom line, transparent assessment combining above, great, advocate that.

But enough ""anti-science"" problems already society, like particular debate falling exclusively heads people devoted lives biology, epidemiology, virology etc. Why? I’ll bro can’t ask question now? mean get investing info Reddit get medical advice ? 

/s &lt;——- needed Article misleading it’s ship existing promised doses elsewhere - scum bag move Seems smart  makes sense. Still unfair though. like band releases album label sells CDs gets fame (yes, bought music CDs, yes old 🧓) Problem happens plane masks. Don’t get wrong, government rotten core. However, people country fairly modern lifestyles, absolutely resent government’s corrupt practices connections hezbolla.

It similar this: know government run corrupt evil billionaires sow war discord upon world. hate them, hate government controlled them, damn near nothing do. go daily lives try get good educations, raise families, eat decent restaurants, despite bullshit happening.

This life average Lebanese. Unfortunately, reached point corruption resulting exponential deterioration, people realize little hope going back pre civil war days.

Source: numerous friends recently immigrated Lebanon. also aren’t impressed America. One told me: “I thought America great place, got here, I’m realizing literally bigger Lebanon, less. roads worse, government almost bad, college courses suck.” That's literally **The media trying scare people,** public absolutely still needs aware risks even downward trend; otherwise trend could reverse. reddit thing, tbh. They're mostly kids Smart man. make good case. Actually, that's true unless immune system severely compromised (chemo, stem cell transplant). diabetes. others conditions like Lupus, outcomes significantly worse I'm sorry preference? Like multiple options right? pretty normal prefer one another. Good you. I've fit trim overweight shape several times life. make less person fit vs I'm overweight. thought society that, apparently not.

I'm Tufte's Visual Display Quantitative Information, lol. Redditors idiots? could've seen coming! Awesome. Dead link people don’t understand devastating cyclical lockdowns would economy. would potentially argue would damaging constant lockdown people would respond “stay home season” approaches supply currency valuation economic favors teachers, parents grandparents caretakers kids, coworkers parents, etc. point schools, gather person, could superspreader events harm kids, cause big outbreaks community. don’t particular source, fact death rates healthcare workers treating COVID patients much higher expected relative age group. pretty heavily reported back spring  mean people make big deal 60% sufficient actually *end* pandemic. 95% sufficient that. 60% isn't. J&amp;J vaccine going lot heavy lifting places without high quality freezers and/or can't reliably get people back 2nd shot, vacuum monumental achievement traditional vaccine ready year. However, want *end* this, *must* goal, RNA vaccines primary shots people getting wherever possible. 60% 0 deaths absolutely nothing sneeze at, people absolutely right jump RNA vaccine hype train. There's big functional difference potential vaccines (not mention future potential RNA vaccines outside COVID-19). care both. People living, fucking lives. Honestly, I'm afraid dying, afraid miserable extended period time. Reducing severe symptoms long symptoms covid primary concern. think rural Indian populations would find way document/tape fact millions friends family dying off? relatives India taking vacations across country, going weddings, acting everything normal. 

 admit it, fact Indians dying rate initially suspected really making white people salty. thinking know Moderna and/or Pfizer 95% effective variant J&amp;J 66% effective against, could used estimate gap effectiveness vaccines variants, even vaccines take relative dent different variants.

But maybe I’m presumptuous effectiveness gap would remain constant variants, maybe impossible know since rightly pointed out, manufacturers released data based region sequences variants. people recover ability walk, take stairs, etc weeks. people ""feel fine"" try run 5km next weekend end serious trouble Like who???? people allergic reactions severe enough justify getting vaccine like 1 million CDC saying specific risk immunocompromised people getting it. cases someone CAN'T get vaccine according current data.

At certain point number people vulnerable choice going low wearing masks saving incremental lives. throw around words like ""decency"" want lets forget goal stuff is, get back normal. want wear mask reason way 2022 go right ahead.  That’s problem. distrust public health going disastrous future. easily make new vaccines variants couple weeks, it’s manufacturing distributing take 6 months- 1 year. Yeah let’s shame people isolated past 10 months seeking socialization, let’s shame poor people going work able self isolate. far proven really effective public health strategy.

Also great we’re making conclusions upvoting despite fact study behind paywall nobody voting commenting actually read it. yeah, let’s take popular science article’s word soundness study’s methodology without actually reading study. get snarky Reddit one-liners this, guess that’s really matters.  I'd like see government level vaccine confidence project. fair amount sociological data available address messaging individual communities, I'd like see implemented imprimatur funding government project. think would go long way reaching 70% coverage need halt endemic transmission.  Infection rate vaccinated. Previous numbers suggested 0.04%. meaningful numbers. IMO opinion number matters percentage vaccinated people infected develop severe disease die. Incredible many people still think hand washing sanitizer best prevention methods. time hear ""My whole office positive. Nobody wore masks sanitized time"" medical professional, offering medical advice.

If cancer patient receiving COVID vaccine, would wait recommended time receiving vaccine full effect take place. would revert standard infection protocols cancer patients. Cancer Treatment Centers America guide outlines suggestionsz Enough time tear market rebuild scratch three times over. early say. They'll likely know summer.  I'm him.

And others use ways try discredit experts preference spot line I'm 36 spot probably J&amp;J Astra time July........ ridiculous chart shows 4 states ordered open. Meanwhile, 65% schools nationwide open person teaching months.

Don't think we're place right afford picky. data that? people I've talked shortness breath weeks. 35% 30 days would unusual biased policy-making we've seen whole pandemic insane. know damn well schools check pretty much every known risk factor spreading covid, US contact tracing practically useless virus widespread never get ""smoking gun"" connection says sure ""such outbreak came school"" not. Yet somehow gets pushed public ""schools totally safe, there's evidence cause spread all!"" movie theaters similar place political motivation behind bet politicians would say hell reopening it, already knew outcome wanted they're making excuse justify so-called ""evidence-based"" decision.

We're basically saying know Pinto probably going explode actually see happen yet, get production rolling. Assholes don’t care people assholes don’t care people?? Groundbreaking work. every credible source says otherwise. Infection rates falling, almost 30%+ US natural immunity either previous infection vaccine, vaccines ramping quickly soon 2M per day, vaccines showing high resistance variants, etc, etc. doesn’t get eyeballs clicks CNN. totally would people told: stay home two months, here’s salary time, mortgages rents frozen, open life back understanding you’re irresponsible right back we’ll go. thing, really would allow real contract tracing isolation work like countries won’t bother name deniers always give excuse works here. young adults reservoir species.  Cool 😬   article:

Family members puzzled family patriarch could infected COVID-19 home, adult son daughter moved care him.

Castillo children, Johnny Castillo Jean D. Chavez, careful. avoided going out. entertained visitors. took fraught trips grocery store. Necessities arrived delivery. 

Then Jean Johnny, 60s also struggling health issues, became ill. 

Within month, three family members dead. ""We"" pretty loose, /r/Coronavirus lot users saying virus would keep mutating vaccines would never catch up. Additionally point, 'over' whenever is, masks come off, social distancing rules gone, people placed personal clean bubble, could real rough time bodies adapt viruses bacteria they've avoided due covid measures. (potentially) different. would expect Moderna Pfizer used interchangeably use mRNA strand. Novavax uses spike protein itself, also interchangeable.  differences spike protein produced vivo Pfizer/Moderna injected Novavax, would less shocking work well together. 

But good idea whether mixing spike vaccine attenuated virus vaccine would provide immunity worthwhile. could better, could worse. know. 

And mixing spike vaccine another specific antigen vaccine would pretty much unknown affect. might give better immunity worse, unlikely immunity would long lasting. call Australia shit hole country, like it, gtfo close enough Wat keep growing. Im ready jabbing Mr. DeMille. read another article gives little detail. seem like manufacturing detail necessarily opportunity produce 50% vaccine. bottleneck still vaccine manufactured. Florida Texas already dropped everything. believe businesses still require masks since lot businesses operate across several States, surprised anything enforcing masks. believe concerts conventions there, though.

I think Anime Boston planning happening April, would kind surprise me, that's expensive venue who's apparently betting conventions allowed couple months. Personally think would crazy say allowed to, vaccinations continue accelerate faster current pace.

Nursing home vaccinations almost certainly completed then, represent around forty percent deaths hospitalizations, millions people 65 offered vaccine. Deaths hospitalizations across board dramatically plummeted, really think hold normal life entire country account increasingly small number risk individuals. That’s thinking too. add fuel fire antivaxers?  could required testing getting flight quartered 2 weeks two negative tests 3 5 days arrival. People forget depression mortality rate too. people ""Go take walk"" Oh no, unlimited government attention expediting much possible, would really help!

Our whole attitude towards fucking insane. 

“No can’t start building Spitfire factory environmental impact assessment complete. Yes I’m aware Germans currently bombing us.”

Just completely fucking ludicrous. around 8% gotten first dose EVERY Democrat considered Bannon Manafort Conway etc etc part team 4 years, fact still today. try distance doctor's delirious rantings current administration want, reason story Uncle Joe's guy. Whoa, wait. Like, *full* normalcy? mean, I'm it, surely masks still expectation? Like, everywhere? blame her? gets day day care elderly person. insanely depressed isolated serious health concern too. Maybe could meet outside precautions? shame articles like needed. common knowledge fever ""cold"" symptoms caused immune system fights something, fever work little faster, reducing fever reduce well immune system fight ""pathogen"" (because that's think stuff vaccine is). learned school science lessons. Guess sells things China? American retailers. Aka people pay American wages Americans keep business.

Acting like stimulus check lets people purchase goods American store bad thing outsourced labor decades ago absurd.

It can’t fix economy help. Inflation check fine, afford it. Especially kill trump tax cut.

Worried paying government intititives though? Time roll tax increases rich. start 400k threshold move reach reasonable number go back pre-Reagan tax rates amounts. 1.1 mil update according CDC. Seems low, first Monday million jabs reported! Editorial: *We launched entire multi-decade war response 9/11, can’t stay home entire extra year honor Covid victims?*

Bonus: *Everything may safe again, families Covid victims feel disrespected seeing packed bars stadiums again*

I guarantee see least one thing along lines one those. Go r/politics r/COVID19positive. You’ll find good company there. Lol live Chicago too? powers think anyone going follow rules summer 2021 kidding themselves. It’s unfortunately even simple. Hospitals (and tire supply chain) meet certain requirements quality. first blush might seem appropriate it’s farce. 

They’re able purchase certain places. metal tube rack, example, cost less couple dollars Amazon. thing $500 medical catalogue. 

These places got bad publicity much shit cost quit putting prices catalogues. excuses vary another common one hospitals needing meet allotted budget come budget lose funding. results endless loop everyone trying buy charge much possible instances.  awww fuck, low fever, headache joint pain first dose I'm looking forward second. thats equally dumb response.

Well they're also overwhelmed people 30s COVID-19, we're talking about. CureVac phase 3 data ready later quarter. approval comes later Q2.

Moderna Pfizer around 1 month (EMA bit slow, like 1,5 month). CureVac releases interim data March, approved somewhere around April (beginning Q2).

So Q2 approval CureVac expected. Q3 approval unlikely, unlucky something goes wrong phase 3 trials, might later Q2 Q3.

J&amp;J data look bad. protects 85% severe symptoms 100% hospitalizations death COVID-19. 70% symptomatic infections vaccine actually pretty good. investigating booster shot might help, needed, pick second booster shot months later want protection (still proven actually gives protection). now, single-dose vaccine stored fridge temperature.

The world fully reopen get back true normal even Covid eradicated Lockdowns worked well 4 we’re still worse spot March! Sounds good me! Also 2020 think people learned everything pandemic takes longer would like longer estimated. remember people saying would June untill doubled trippled lot time line probably right.

I'm super hoping take bunch time here, things seem going quite well say I'm 100% confident we'll summer even seems like likely outcome. one actually knows what's going happen, best estimate based similar viruses. possible single factor wave happen variants cases would increase hospitalizations deaths don’t extent vaccinated at-risk population?

Dude, that’s mission accomplished. small correction: Working home recommendation, requirement, rush hour traffic indicates sizable number workplaces either asking allowing employees work on-premises. 


Also non-commercial gatherings residential buildings exempt 5-person limit. recommendation visit others, do, never 5 people one roof, regulation preventing it. fines, etc. 


Finally, shops allowed remain open 50% turnover food, people shopping large supermarkets get appliances, clothing, tools, etc. 


In fact somewhat interesting non-B117 infection numbers dropped dramatically have. main reduction activity schools educational institutions closed. Working home occur lot also impact, really seems school closure and/or voluntary behavior changes main source.  We're 31M doses administered right now, effectively 15-16M vaccinated. We'd need another 170M doses get 100M vaccinated. 28 days, that'd 6M/day. going happen considering we're 1-2M/day now.

Those guys never use unless field game. Right, didn’t clarify need measures certain % vaccinated. also went say need studies determine getting vaccinated actually prevents transmission others.

Ofcourse things going wrong there, end deliveries go up, vaccination speed go up. new “lets see two weeks” annoying catchprhase - next months gonna worst....

No shit. No, want see many people possible get 90% efficacy vaccines instead 60% ones. think you’re disingenuous. followed Georgia elections never got impression 2k checks would go “immediately.” instead walked away understanding Democrats supported 2k relief overall, tracks recent legislative proposals. going me.. mr johnson Cases hospitalizations already falling cliff. Thanks previous Conservative government. makes sense I've saying while... May 1 memorial day range going country reopens developing country want protect economy much possible, vaccinating workforce understandable. Plus, workforce ones likely catch covid discover vaccine stops transmission, workforce vaccinated slow spread massively. Plz help. 

Yours truely, Canada. dont understand he'd say something like that. What's suggesting restrictions permanent seeing faces public going ballgame seeing live theatre become thing past? What's point vaccine then? Idiots wanna catch COVID strains one in, take it. No, Germany. mask slipped little. Wherever concentration power, things start getting ugly. Yep worst over...

My wife, brother, sister father vaccinated I'm waiting call (I'm pretty low risk). Alright captain hindsight. think there's reason believe infants lasting immunity. Pregnant women pass antibodies - they're floating bloodstream, all. protein blood decays time. B cells make antibodies, cells recognize spike protein kill infected cells, long-lasting.

I would strongly assume baby born mother covid19 pregnancy would less healthy baby born mother covid-19. Probably be. won't. understanding quiet yet public backlash that's coming restrictions. going protests, going people stopping following ""rules"" Doesnt say states...

Urging everyone vaccinated one thing, allowing everyone vaccinated another, which, last checked, dont green light yet so.

Maybe Fauci make happen since vaccinations need get done ASAP. 2 vaccines another way... it’s whole freaking year smh honestly don’t care anymore. wish authority figures would stop pushing narrative still need socially distance/wear masks vaccination. presume say things like want cautious possible/not make promises, makes sense theory guess, creates sentiment people even bother getting vaccinated. We've shut nearly year people burnt out. glimmer optimism hurt. Trying pump $NVAX?  Yeah shit house system means fuck cases. Enjoy covid infected shit hole deaths 9/11 everyday seppo. EU would've ordered three months earlier, would mattered. goal start production months ago, 6 months prepare reach goal achieved 8 months since deal signed. 330 million euros invested making sure happens. could ask more. order 3 months later, still pretty early enough time prepare couple funds. AZ meant start production EU around October 2020. lots time discover problems.

I read lot it, seen arguments side, European, still see AZ faults. see trying push blame EC, creating false narrative first-come-first-served cuts due late EU order.

This doughts false narrative created. First off, AZ cannot blame EC late order agreed it. AZ realistically needed extra 3 months get everything ready, knew could accepted order. agree it. would best reasonable effort supply 120 million AZ doses end Q1 2021. Secondly, put dought really would mattered signing contract 3 months earlier. UK signed contract 3 months earlier, end 2020, UK still ironically relied EU facilities funnily enough supply EU vaccines too. EU signed 3 months later, EU funded facilities deliver AZ vaccines EU supplied UK AZ vaccines beginning. many it? know, known 80 million 100 million ordered AZ vaccines made EU, could potentially talk 20 million vaccines. who's facilities ready? one ordered 3 months earlier 3 months later? make sense, thus probably correlation vaccine order date getting production-ready. Lastly puts dought narrative Moderna Pfizer. managed it, without problems. AZ bad failed secure deal guarantees, instead best reasonable efforts. 

Can link publicized contracts UK country AZ shows delivery guarantees? mean, EU shafted reliable western producer third countries. Neither US Uk exported single dose vaccines produced countries. EU exporting covid vaccinnes Canada, Turkey Israel others. people blaming EU? can't help wonder support going damaged this.  They're currently saying herd immunity around 70%. appears achievable (measles like 92%). agree, everybody get vaccine get vaccine. However, I'd never support idea forced vaccination. Proper education people walks life would ideal teach people vaccines work. calling name - welcome. think view forced wear mask uncommon, civil discourse discussion way mess see around world.

To government overreach, think agree general point, grave health concerns, large number anti maskers wear masks. think civil liberties freedoms prevalent American psyche, governments would rather people wear masks without mandate, clearly happening. Freedom Americans big thing schools, socialism enemy free Americans engrained young age, government interference always viewed hostility.

If vulnerable person wears mask, someone covid not, they're much higher risk catching persons wore masks. Common sense common, anti masker irresponsible, incapable making safe decision, endangers others, would willing see government might entity force mask wearing health vulnerable person? anti maskers personal liberties important health safety vulnerable person?

Seems take long time Moderna Pfizer 2 dose regimen. begrudge anyone going 2 dose version, I'd feel reasonably safe J&amp;J. much easier distribute less populated areas. another poor comparison many reasons, overall population density main one

The population density thing poor measure take account vast areas totally uninhabited land Canada NZ (and Australia matter). Taking averages makes seem like living nice socially distanced farms actually crammed quite densely populated urban areas vast nothingness between. 

What really matters urban population densely populated urban areas live are. Canada US 81% urban population Canadian urban areas (I'm talking city centres suburbs includes people actually live suburbs) marginally densely populated US urban areas. NZ urban areas also denser US ones sprawling suburbs McMansions half acre like many US cities. way want slice it, America's outcomes unique. Zeroing countries feel compare favorably rather aggregate data suggests got bit axe grind

No Europe equally incompetent. Although US still bottom pack consider advantages Europe. US urban areas much lower density European ones large sections US spared first wave chance prevent widespread transmission failed. 

I would add China obviously even incompetent start rectified later. Japan also done shockingly bad job well thanks restricted testing. Yes large majority countries proven governments utterly incompetent. can't blame developing nations lacked resources much it, failure 90% developed nations disappointing. least parts US lock hard long time, still failed

Lockdowns work combination travel restrictions. eliminate virus keep getting back in. takes one two cases seed new epidemic matter weeks. week Canada finally understood implementing hotel quarantine intl arrivals Australia/NZ model. UK also considering real, total border restrictions stop new strains. Part problem gave totally inept, totally wrong advice close borders. 

In US states succeeded implement managed quarantine systems new arrivals. could used electronic monitoring like Taiwan Hong Kong hotel capacity would issue. could see systems succeeded around world. US states this, lockdowns nothing.

You data time period transpired yet. Sure.

Instead admitting data exist trust vaccines, parade like know better everyone else. TV radio telling people virus? seem confidently figured out.

Or maybe admit skepticism healthy especially comes people's health, trust matters. data exists, cannot make claim one way other.

In words, cut bullshit. know long lasts though around many years. Plus saying good vaccines give stronger immunity usually mild case covid. that.

Thankfully talked round. Vaccines help either way, vaccines may provide complete protection, provide some, reducing ability virus reproduce reduces ability mutate. Slowing spread keeps people safe reducing infections, reducing ability virus adapt. still cautious vaccine roll out, continue future. 100m 28 days seems unlikely given current production schedules, even including Johnson Johnson really anti vaxers stop others able get vaccine? care much people want vaccine?  Honest question see happening Canada all.

Less people dead. Seems work. What? Yet Az/Ox vaccine made locally locations, removing need export it. developed UK gov funding sold cost Oxfords insistence (yes going remind way apparently :( ).

CORVAX program funded numerous countries well. 

Is EU directly exporting vaccines countries? Israel supplied Pfizer part private deal, EU involvement, goes Canada (private company supplying Canada, EU involved). infection rates / severe infection rates small children basically nill. 

Id concerned immune compromised adults cant take vaccine. 

Having said that, Id hard pressed many restrictions place (and importantly followed) we're ""everyone wants vaccine already received one."" 

Im coming right wing boot-strap everyone watch ass bullshit either, acknowledge population live risk lives sanity everyone else. yeah like SA distinctively worse many countries, guess response less average clearly cases dropping. confusing though massive surge arrived equivalent late May early June northern hemisphere  going change overnight?

Precautions going stay place know large percentage population vaccinated. Ripping everything we've put past year prematurely would foolish. Plus venues want risk outbreak tied them, they'll cautious.

""Fully normal"" meaning someone coma 2019 woke tell difference, happen overnight. mean restrictions heavily lifted, see reminders precautions while. people still wear masks, extra spacing, cleaning, sanitizer still present. places like healthcare facilities government buildings likely keep temperature checks while.

So that's ""degree"" normalcy. overnight change.    There’s way still 3rd.  post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* There's like twenty AZ plants worldwide. 

Why focus UK USA's? IFR highly variable. Assuming 0.5% IFR, 0.2% population fatality rate would imply 40% prevalence. 

But NYC spring outbreak IFR substantially higher, 1.5% range. 0.33% city died 20-25% guesstimated prevalence advanced serology. Economists call ""pent demand."" call Roaring 20s!  soooo fucking depressing. Hope see data soon vaccine effectiveness. UK invested millions setting dedicated manufacturing facilities AZ factory inside UK

Including AZ plant Belgium Hancock adamant vaccine must manufactured entirely UK population.

Why exactly? EU standards match UK standards present. Besides, EU put orders alongside UK. AZ deliver promised without UK, it’s unlikely vaccine ever comes light

Not vaccine rolled out. Americans producing licensed version German Bio'N'Tech vaccine. problem volume government messed lot things, vaccine they’ve smashed park!

And I'm thankful - long cost people. count two people full bus that's significant. that's anecdotal. Again, shown proof videos give vague comment visual proof.

This guy german, traveled sweden month stayed stockholm video admits saw nearly nobody face masks even buses. showed proof, look video. single soul mask.

you give opinion, say significant number people show real proof.

Here video. fall Wait, guy implied blind emotional motivations calling armchair psychologist? 

I follow data too. January lethal month far battle COVID. past two weeks, we’ve seen lull experts warn temporary. know want woods. I. woods, downvoting doesn’t get woods faster either.     Yep! Isle Man govvie handled coronavirus almost flawlessly. first lockdown March-June second one we’ve Jan 4th til now. want good stuff lol.. selfish don’t let anyone tell otherwise. You’re young, go live life dude talk things they're thinking population level. really care individuals getting vaccinated terms getting enough population immunized numbers change significantly. someone's vaccinated family too, safe meet up, government going change restrictions see quantifiable changes. never going able force everyone get jab. I'll take available me. believe everyone get it. helps vulnerable. talking family friend several underlying conditions. asked doctor vaccine told absolutley get it. 

I see situation force someone get believe force people get it. Proper education science behind vaccines important. Rushed vaccines country issue past (1976 Swine Flu). speed vaccines seem issue people know hesitant it. always hardcore anti-vaxers unfortunately.   Country wealth always measured GDP. Income wealth, wealth never measured income. question poster China wealthy. is. Good luck. Thats wild Contradicting reading early fall? [Let give cdc guideline get many people still believe spread claim made. always get voted well ever try correct bs. Aggravating. mean also claims there’s massive, variant-driven wave coming 6-14 weeks so... Nah Murda’s stream. Tons old dudes everyone’s facing 1 foot away talking it’s really low risk   safe environment go they're fed cared makes big difference. Like teacher believe schools help kids? trace system shambles, test system not. thread couple days ago somewhere site said countries least deaths get ""deserve"" handling better. guess country well, left die. can’t correct unless using unusual definition “few” “few months”. Hardest superlative. Every month pandemic can’t hardest month every runner race fastest time. careful...saying means deluded fool something Lol okay AKA want revenue fans MURDA! Yup. Macron insisting used EU deliver. He's also resorted spreading anti-vaxxer nonsense AZ vaccine try ""decrease demand"" France lol. guy total moron seems egging EU bad decisions days. people get long term damage. already old vulnerable.

By way, already beers friends weekly basis. quite healthy fine. cry pillow public health overlords tell things safe care much :) God. Damn. It.

Sir Tom, best hopes one random guy US. Kick ass. amount people stayed indoors without families whole year died anyway

... nowhere near many risked died unnecessarily covid.
 
But still pretty understandable 100s, gonna lie. watch local news well. don’t doom gloom either issue also everyone wants shot, now. flu? Mostly people insurance want it, even stores community programs practically beg people get vaccinated.

The load spread heavy. Clearly precisely happened here. whatever fuck wanted, right? Same...it feel last forever, won’t. Anyone know brand vaccine Rite Aid getting?
Scheduled parents 1st doee 3 weeks now. Yep, fixed snowblower. see flurries. Good times ahead. tears must always scared something. legit curious   love idea people supposedly god fearing end try every possible trick book outsmart god himself. mean, made whole universe effortlessly we've got fishing line i'm sure he'll fall that. think favour: 
 
Sir Captain Tom ""The Eternal"" Moore 
Sir Captain Tom ""Forever Moore""   personally plowing roads appointment? escorting roads? Heh, teasing anyway. WWZ Bit scare border, 3 people got infected SA variant quarantine hotel late show pre-departure test. One got sick days later went tested. Luckily person always used Covid Tracer app tracking everyone they'd contact relatively easy, tested negative. also re-tested everyone left hotel recently found 2 cases, father daughter. Looks like infected anyone either.

Overall success, cases contained within days social distancing restrictions needed. Hard questions asked infection control within hotels, whether post departure testing required. Eh... sixteen places one day hard do. 

If went shopping [Auckland/NZ] would have, easily something like:
~4+ Scans buses
Maybe couple scans bus stations
2-3 scans food/coffee
+however many shops visited. 
+The mall venture mall...
+Maybe library. God hope not. Ultra orthodox...so EU paid 336 millions beforehand Astrazeneca knowing vaccine would work, therefore funding research production. UK restricting exports vaccines. EU not. Glass half full/empty kind situation. Would better get certainly better gotten infected month ago. That's active. knows many could called up. Shit, lot could come back volunteers simple phone call. Paywalled! Seriously, it’s already here, awhile. way they're going they'll get back second dose (like dad) US gets first people. went one WA today running smoothly. issue old lady hit car parking lot. also fact breed like rabbi-ts population gonna grow point state able sustain lifestyle anymore? what's exactly plan Israel deal situation? no, socialized, centralized healthcare doesnt work. 

My dad gave NHS number dob got appointment week. 

There's also huge amount people volunteered. 

Orange County California said going get volunteers. many friends signed many months ago official website. 

Nobody ever contacted. Friendly reminder vaccination numbers likely going low next day two Northeast getting slammed massive snow storm.  respect saying going look study linked health authorities cited number studies show bringing small vulnerable populations students 10 years old back led increase community spread. Many students affected virtual learning accessible them.  


As dialogue shown, think issue nuanced ""schools closed/schools open."" county, schools open since March 13, 2020 yet numbers bad worse counties open degree since September. school systems state completely open, surely agree safe solution time. Awesome. Get however can. Anyone wants one able get one. Ironically, said week main reason Veto worries Trump putting American company pressure service America first.

Matt Hancock seems lot criticism moment made absolutely amazing moves, along vaccine taskforce, ensure UK one good move Matt Hancock pretty obvious one that. NHS made happen ground experienced and, importantly, motivated get done ease pressure staff. imagine gone Serco Capita one parasite companies donate Tories...

The army part. Even went private company, like America, NHS would still now. logistical stuff army, far best option. Americans already administered 32M shots. entire eligible population would vaccinated least first shot now. Instead, we’re sitting 2%. 

It’s hard bummed thought. Huh?

Nah, Bruh... ended him. Keep reading. ;)  cool, pay living wage  yeah it’s like Boomers ever gave shit us...they never sacrifice anything younger generations  unfiltered sub yesterday. getting bombarded bad news, seems passed part thankfully. Thank you! Astrazeneca going provide millions doses EU profit, vaccine funded researched UK. That's funny definition bad. MAH STRAINS! Well bound start shit show regardless running it. month ironing kinks, new administration making vaccination primary focus going get LOT better February. Nah we're pussies like france. We'll least 90% turnout, probably like 98% everyone realises cool thing could train monkey 15 minutes vaccinate people.... i'm pretty sure soldier handle found moron  yes, would say 90%, maybe even 95% people (as look different statistics different countries) catch covid home household member (but surprisingly people living roof catch it, friend sick parents living time small appartment, never tested positive covid) work. 2 places people tend throw precautions window, among friends family people know, nobody gonna wear respirator home work 8 hours, considered impersonal, almost insulting also uncomfortable. School, restaurants, theatres stadiums would also spread lot, closed (for good reason imho). dont agree governments close small shops, people wear masks spent brief time. low covid risk high economical impact activities like closed outside markets, shops said, outside sporting hobbies, right close whatever come people meet. Economy sociaty goes drain, would much used brain..... One potential wrinkle US Novavax trials US starting roll vaccines people 65, may difficulty finding enough elderly people complete enrollment. Thanks that. That’s great news. Sir, clinic  thankful pulled off. Gave many weeks entertainment distraction really fun season. seriously vaccinate 7 people total today? could children asymptomatic spreading others community would symptomatic, number cases would notably higher area schools 100% virtual. state, numbers higher areas schools 100% virtual counties students person. basically studies look determine schools spreading virus. That, beyond obvious contact tracing tie transmission schools. hand, dude whose funeral featured OP died Covid. hearse gets surrounded horde idiots care fellow humans. That’s two million people fully vaccinated right there! Conservative estimate everyone get first dose June, doses sometime autumn.   One guys bad get antibody cocktail. think invulnerable can't get soon. going restaurants ever. wearing masks, except work, that. Canadian confirm. ""You guys vaccines?"" expect start seeing lowest number since October / September etc it’s happening!  fucking joke! explain plummeting cases declining hospitalizations? 31.1 million shots means that. Pfizer Moderna vaccines, require second shot either three four weeks later. hate dampen optimism, we’re headed right direction. Kate Bingham tory party mate. also happens quite good getting shit done too.

The hate got taking unpaid job unbelievable time. hindsight looks even worse. Oh no.   makes sense thank Evidence, State Local Health Department Directors, experience counties around us points safe proper precautions. I'll let look up, cited numerous times state local state officials.

I choosing daughters health teachers. case daughter, chosen provide education accessible someone disability like hers. choosing keep getting paid job service providing. Again, mounting evidence, cited subreddit, shows done safely. unrealistic ask students go back, county, teachers refusing educate disadvantaged, vulnerable, underprivileged children even though would allow basic universal precautions mitigation.

 ""Sounds like aligned, would wait teachers vaccines + 14 days."" actually depends vaccine based read. Pfizer 7 days Moderna says 14 days second shot. That's pedantic, wanted mention it. agree terms weeks ago - teachers go back 14 days second shot. problem district teachers saying go back kids vaccinated vaccine 100% effective. unacceptable. 


In county, teachers expect continue paid job time evidence shows done. want take risk, wife take FMLA guarantees job waiting 2 years. 


Finally, appreciate saying regarding two incomes. clear I'd like clarify. wife employed 4 years now, specifically take care daughter. frustrating spends 16 hours week working one-on-one aide facilitate virtual learning. work free, school system would able provide daughter education, disability. fall two income trap. said, many people disabled children trap set themselves, one society set priorities - bars, restaurants, theatres open. many situations parents work privileged I. wonder happened throughout this? one listening cries giving support throughout this. unreasonable privileged situation, one imagine much suffering going situation. 


Regarding IDEA, wrong needs said true. school system upholding legal obligation provide children disabilities free appropriate public education. ""Appropriate"" always contentious word law, even COVID. reason feel strongly community disabled children parents care willfully disregarded ignored. unlike wife's situation. Honestly, hardest part working 20+ extra hours job teachers used do. hardest part realizing little culture society care disabled.  


You agree much disagree. I'm sorry wife's health wellbeing disregarded live. anything, need listening right now. sincerely appreciate dialogue spoken also listening. No! Humans remarkably resilient. We’ve 10s thousands years virus completely wiped us plant. Get damn shot, makes happy safest way possible reduce hospitalizations/reduce spread, beat thing eventually. 

Look, US 370k Jan, excess 420k. look are, despite loss almost 1 Mil Americans - kicking ass vaccination game. first attempt still 50% shot beating big bad SA/BR variants. simply amazing! ain’t prevail. Let guess.. got totally fine? Well seems like USA lowest case # since early November lack concern sub human rights truly disturbing. germany, nothing earth Irish granny get granny Africa? crying doses EU's getting entirely EU's fault procuring doses investing enough first place facilities.

I sincerely hope UK done doses leftover go developing world rather neighbours receiving doses anyway, jealousy monster they're slowly.

Maybe instead complaining Brits posts, turn criticism inwards wonder EU left behind despite collection extremely wealthy nations easily collective capability produce vaccines quickly strike deals quickly yet failed every aspect.  Yeah, shit Sherlock. pointing wrong say nobody got shot died. even potentially made big mistake too. delay second dose potentially meaning nobody immune allowing virus continue spread encourage adaptations. Hopefully see infection rate drop quickly start proper vaccinations

The first dose vaccines give around 70% protection, put perspective higher end flu vaccine. Oxford AZ support move. Pfizer don't, never delayed trail there's data 2nd shot adds protection left longer. worst though, would stuck protection level one shot, that's enough.

It's leaving people unprotected though. was, would significantly different reaction science areas. see merits ways. Ultimately think people get covid way, less suffer/die it. 

I'm glad we're point even discuss vaccination strategy. It’s refreshing seeing good news coming subreddit.

A little year ago tragedy tragedy, maybe one lukewarm silver lining between. seems like end sight hope faith EU proved correct. I'm little cynical it, would much rather proved wrong.

It's perhaps little unfair accuse UK vaccine nationalism. Especially funded research development Oxford/AZ vaccine, insisted provided world (including EU countries) profit. stands contrast German developed Pfizer one.

I'm lawyer, really qualified judge rights wrongs contract law. Unless issue goes court, suspect we'll never know. People angry impatient vaccines, everybody trying deflect blame themselves.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* J&amp;J finally greater good!  Ya know movies come vaccine it’s like movie basically over. Cuz vaccine. vaccine/s feels like months don’t know single person gotten it? Still shit company exploits animals profit pays trash wages UK includes restrictions contract AZ. That’s don’t need ways. sneaky putting facade. UK block exports, doesn’t allow vaccines produced UK facilities used export contract signed AZ. factually blocking export without overtly. EU made threat block exports (to AZ), yet allows vaccines exported produced facilities EU. 

This state discussion here. Nothing BS propaganda. Q2 confirmed anything, hence “at least”. childcare bubble parents anyway see lot done whole time. like older generation mum started go round already go visit mum. Nan lives alone technically could bubbled mum anyway since bubbled us childcare didn’t want risk it. cool I'm saddened fact standards slid far bear minimum celebrated. Scary sad. good soft power, potentially good reserve vaccine tweaked variants booster needed — wonder benefit extra vaccine come stream everyone due vaccinated.

Higher predicted efficiency? Foreign aid? backup plan? made smile. Thank you. 40 million AZ Q1 goal. Police fire water canons drag health care. question transmission. brief conversation someone less minute, without masks close proximity, enough spread virus? Incredibly dumb question: happens nanoparticles? risk conflict say mRNA vaccines?  mention idea efficacy look like AZ vaccine new strains. initial round data could barely eek 62% efficacy without contend new strains like JnJ did. seeing J&amp;J trialed adversarial environment vaccines too. strains, cases.

So could still par.  Isn’t Pfizer mRNA vaccine? potential side effects known one, heard AstraZeneca vaccine uses old tech, established side effects well known contrary Pfizer (less information). one? quite. Worth read.

Financial Times lawyer dude, got famous shitting government Brexit legal shenanigans.   still size could able pass masks easier? think fake news. could fewer virus particles already infectious, still go masks easier.... Thanks! nothing new regarding new strains. mention closing god damn borders, keeping well shut. Look Australia, thing right. Think mean one shot , they're talking fastest go zero one million rather fastest million point mean, behind us doses per capita. unified healthcare system great, seems necessary quick vaccine delivery. Israel's case numbers dropped 25% since peak two weeks ago. We've winter much summer without community case. 10 months without case. Life basically normal here. cope another 5 day lock contact tracing occur life going back normal.

Also summer right now. 37c (98f) today. think way stating covid sole reason event simply another fallacy let alone last two sentences Let’s gooooooo. Fuck blizzards. Vaccination rate moon. said hasn’t done Uber long, visiting 3 service stations 2 days seems indicate otherwise. side effects type vaccine known? Pfizer mRNA vaccine? Yes, reason might think.

[COVID particle Masks cannot filter particles size COVID, COVID passes easily surgical said, UK South African variants change size virus. big issue mask itself, mask wearing culture (reusing old masks longer effective blocking viral particles, wearing 1 ply 2 ply masks, huge gap middle mask, use ineffective cloth masks, wearing mask nose, consistent touching masks, etc.) Numbers include Q4 2020 Q1 2021. 260 sounds right, wrote 250 get nice even number. :) Agreed. Cases also problem, expect cases increase across world rules become lax fewer people hospitalized/die people get vaccinated. Excellent. could use positive vaccine-news Europe. Stay strong.

According current EU distribution key, 18.6 per cent allocated Germany. Federal Republic therefore expect additional 13.95 million vaccine doses.

India 1.36 billion people 1360 times 1 million. Multiply 1360 6 days gives 8160 days, 22 years. can’t eradicated. It’s widespread many diffuse communities means there’ll always pockets hide in.

Masks helpful, panacea; N95s wouldn’t need exist surgical masks totally protective tiny particles already stands (they aren’t sealed around edge, starters).

They help, way holding raincoat front mean get much less wet someone throws bucket water would sling straight face, still wetter were, idk, big sealed hamster ball.

As understand it, inhale particular dose covid actually catch it, immune system able nuke sight. one responses already says, suspected new strains might either cause people exhale viral particles (as bigger bucket water) need inhale smaller dose viral particles get sick (uh, water bucket is...somehow wetter normal water, metaphor failing here). 

In either case, imperfect protection still better nothing, might need something better increase odds contracting covid (or getting wet).

The idea impossible catch covid masked never accurate. It’s improving odds. trying convince you, still reality portray nothing experience dozes expats tell total normality sweden.

Here good video normality sweden. explains thing saw total normality people living lives comment validity his?. two people 100 wearing masks rush hour means swedes following rules entire world forced wear masks, businesses forcefully closed people losing livings.

Don't find strange world falling apart rest planet sweden total normality. (anyone non sweden please watch video).

Western Australia contains resources industry keeping broader Australian economy collapsing. super simple explanation - infected individual leaves invisible cloud particles behind him. longer stays one spot, thicker cloud becomes. takes time cloud disperse dilute.

So article goes need eradicate virus deserve nothing less. Seriously? Wtf point article?

The writer makes seem like magic formula could used instantly eradicate it. 

The path eradicating requires first manage it, reduce caseload using health guidelines enforced speeding vaccinations. 

Those thigs alone already showing hopeful signs. pace, back significant way (compared now) within 3 months. still cases, hospitals messed up. Yes frustating think interpreting incorrectly. I've wrote details here: u wanna look per capita stats, look deaths per capita india usa let’s see u still spirit skynews article.I live Portugal. People breaking confinement. days ago 22 year Brazilian model revealed party many people. posted pictures well videos party Facebook.in one month went brief period time , 3 am, pay bills ATM machine. [to read article click  right! looking 10 day old article. hard keep track days anymore. schedule APA q1, q2 etc., time relative approval

The delivery schedule per contract, deliver depends approval. AZ fails get approval, deliver. delayed, ought stockpile. audit AZ books see stockpile approval. sad. hope pulls through. official: January 2021 saw fewer 98,000 American deaths (Worldometer). mainstream media—which extensively cited models predicted 150,000 deaths—has egg face. Again. I'm pretty used kind projection since gov went lockdown  far, that's 10% double-dosed, cases fallen roughly 25% latest peak, although slight bump recently.

You need really significant numbers vaccinated drop R number appreciably, even vaccine 100% effective - although approach 100% coverage, smaller smaller population that's risk. vaccine better vaccine. What's point without momentum? 

Here's government website. Numbers show 3.7 million. Today 16 days passed. Bringing average approx 200k per day. big country billion people.

In city, pathetic 50 - 200 per day. stopped city reporting numbers public backlash.

I'm sure get vaccine 2021. India used supply 90% vaccines Pakistan even pre-covid. country's media figured minimize hide contributions general public.

India also providing funds global COVAX coalition - supplier - effectively donation. yet sources information from. producers vaccine say 21 days.

The UK risking health residents inflate curves vaccine roll outs let's start fact willing mix match first second doses companies depending one available time. Something also backed producers. assuming joking :) Good hear investing vaccine production. 
I imagine pharmaceutical manufacturing done U.K. ‘we don’t need’ goes abroad. 
We don’t need antimalarials made example. Like China?  done right.

Who &amp; vaccine producers recommend 21 days two jabs. UK 12 weeks order inflate numbers people getting first jab.

Who &amp; vaccine producers say mix match vaccines. UK said second dose hand given another companies second dose. absolutely data show AstraZeneca vaccine unsafe over-65's, definitely right serious damage making claims.

It tested age group showed safe age group. bit people taking completely context get enough data age group confirmed effectiveness them. enough data *not* = effective. simply means data confirm. lab tests vaccine showed much immune response blood 0ver-65's, extrapolated show indeed work them.  Well, CureVac signed contract EU far I'm aware. Actually domestic tourism huge impact. tourism capital cities negatively affected.

Outside capital city thousands towns around country, tourism booming. Entire towns forever better likely permanent boost interest local touring. Even COVID issues long gone, regional areas benefits significant boost awareness local holidaying.

And yes 10 months Perth, life pretty normal. social support services done good job assisting negatively impacted. 320 people died Covid aged 20-40 1/5th total died road accidents UK, probably slightly likely die road accident Covid (as 20-40 make 1/5 population probably higher proportion road accident deaths).

That's obviously terrible wear seatbelt avoid driving like absolute idiot, dying road accident something really worry happens. mean incentives follow rules, perfectly safe - mitigate risks, mostly successfully.

The true Covid: follow rules facing blind bend slow truck front you, afraid, wear seatbelt (mask) drive dangerously (social distance), even something allowed, feels wrong. Seeing France highest rates anti-vax beliefs world it’s surprising hear leader spouting nonsense. Moers delivered UK, Israel US course. nothing proud off.

What putting everyone risk delaying second dose 12 weeks cram people first dose ASAP.

Then go back second one second half original vaccine available going giving second half another one.

This something said tested, evidence suggest would work advise it. Even vaccine producers say results say works using jabs.

The vaccine producers advise wait 21 days most.


The UK deliberately delaying second doses mishandling vaccine inflate vaccine roll figures risk public health. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

There benefit EU ordering single vaccine total population. ordered multiple times population different vaccines sensible. also mutation vector since can't propagate you

This unclear moment. Data S. Africa showing less protections new variants. Vaccines might well put virus evolutionary pressure, infinite mutations keep virus viable. need see.  Minor point, local tourism going absolutely bananas. Tourism definately changed, different.

The general director National Center Preventive Programs Disease Control Mexico, Ruy Lopez Ridaura, informed past Sunday press conference discovery mutation state Jalisco (Mexico), specifically, manifested four cases.

This past weekend, four cases coronavirus different normal found, first thought could strain found South Africa. However, first analyses option ruled out, next hypothesis could original strain Mexico, already named E484K.

This mutation new; thing confirmed. is, never seen Mexico. One four cases, addition, contact foreign person Puerto Vallarta, rest cases claim contact anyone traveled abroad.

The Institute Epidemiological Diagnosis Reference (InDRE) working hard able announce something precision shortest period time possible. collaboration contact laboratory University Guadalajara.

""What must defined characteristics has, strain something different priority look virulent, disease serious, requires serious study,"" Ridaura points out.

Current situation Mexico

The latest data recorded Mexican country 462 new deaths due coronavirus, total 158,563 since beginning pandemic, 7,030 new infections total 1,864,260.

Lopez Ridaura also confirmed press conference 104,963 active cases, 1,412,383 patients already recovered disease. No. single dose mRNA vaccine would provide similar protection J&amp;J vectored one. deaths aren’t dangerous part virus. someone chronic fatigue syndrome 20 years, think people need scared long covid well. Moderna going start producing Spain matter weeks. vaccines produce better numbers would want these? Sounds like next opening Geico commercial: ""Do countries 'loose', rule-breaking cultures get hit harder Covid?"" cursory search seems backed even trivially findable public made go hundreds pages contain direct investments vaccines member states.

Why always attack personally? personal discussion forum. forum coronavirus. hospital work agreed keep original vaccination schedule 4 weeks jabs anyone first dose certain cut date, people still original schedule would second around I'm this. I'd pay $100 whatever cost Pfizer/BioNtech. spun victory Tories well handled pandemic, 100k+ deaths forgotten, they’ll voted in... again. herded. People generally understand science community minded say, large portion US.

There's reason push back 'just because'. That's ultimately happens US, government says something means CAN'T CONTROLLED GOVERNMENT.

Largely people agree this. last lockdown (10 months ago), 95% approval rating. People agreeing right thing do, getting panties twist fact government.   possible revaccination requirement future mainly Government boosts Scotland vaccine production powerhouse Valneva’s site West Lothian, supporting 100 highly-skilled jobs

Also notice many times Scotland mentioned minister’s quotes end statement. 

The SNP pushing second independence vote year U.K. government trying demonstrate benefits union. goods make em accept hard earned money return old fashioned  Using average useful (in best way possible). count per day increasing every single day. average telling happened week ago. USA giving 2 million doses day probably *increase* rate next weeks. useful metric probably average change doses administered per day. Basically R0 vaccine doses! Except want positive instead negative. - around 55Million Time Period three month, produced Europe...

Fingers crossed! country, you’d get paper doctor

In USA, we’re still talking McDonald’s workers I’m going stop right there.  evidence assertion?

You aware UK signed contracts vaccine companies 3 months EU?  5% workforce Lol. 

95% McDonalds employees work franchise owners. 

So everyone corporate get time get vaccinated.. salaried anyway. like 10 people benefitted this. including McDonald's PR firm. boss baffles unique America. Got multiple ft’s 25 days year, tell go dentist go hospital dont really care worktime. long doesn’t interfere customer meetings theyre allowed plan go home whatever long rest knows it. Sure limit kind things, hairdresser also done weekend. things hospital (or vaccination) appointments usually get made you. Human decency acting way help society. does. decent thing That's true, answer question. CEO CNBC talking this. Negotiations FDA ongoing. know contract says? export restrictions included private contract would legal UK law rules? 

Also, specifically national observer article linked believe supports position Uk? Uhm, number cases falling weeks now? no, measures slow spread, even still increasing bit, useless. effective enough. Good thing cases decreasing. Thinking NFL/CDC report tracing detection efforts, clear virus transmissable thought. guideline measures seem dance razor's edge, 5% could tip scales. Especially people try lawyer guidelines following letter intent. pro masks back March, real problem began. Wearing masks rules changing every 5 minutes idiotic.

I'm sick armchair experts backing someone worst record country, yeah, go ahead stand Dan. keep hearing AZ ""it should"" protect new variants ""we know couple weeks"".  Yet weeks passed still nothing. half baked. Almost everyone here. 

We've 10 months without transmission. likely weekend inconvenience price, I, everyone know, happy pay. Well, two day total double number. hand, one vaccine site comment DAF. authoritarian. Stay home want to, can't stop me. Eh, like Swedish health authority completely alone. Health authorities neighbouring countries recommending less measures, like closing borders countries already general spread spring. politicians introducing measures health authority Norway recommending, apparently. sure rest. said long-term strategy good idea many ways. Etc. 

The state epidemiologist said start countries would second waves could worse first one. Getting smaller second wave somewhat point strategy, second wave smaller many European countries, bigger Sweden expected hoped for, covid-19 hard predict.  Everyone knew would come back. mean time 10 months without single community transmission. Life mostly totally normal. likely brief interruption, go back again.  thought Prozac it’s not, I’m luck 'we'? need vaccinate entire population achieve herd immunity via vaccination. logistics honestly luck (the UK plant didnt suffer delays/bad batch, EU ones did) ..

The UK received fraction expected orders 2020 due manufacturing issues. delays issue due UK buying early, time fix problems. hate say done almost everything wrong pandemic, luck involved, UK gov hedged bets across wide range vaccines invested massively setting manufacturing supply lines required components vaccine paying now. realize every movie aliens invade attack us like Nazi Blitzkrieg completely impractical.

If ability interstellar travel, they'd kills us virus arrive we've karen'd oblivion.  EU fucked up, we’re lockdown 2-3 months longer Shutup nay-sayer! Don’t know coronavirus 1500% death rate? stay home stop selfish. /s idea without execution bullshit. going impossible everywhere, even NZ, future. majority population vaccinated, borders going open virus enter places like NZ circulate low levels (basically ""background noise""). point another respiratory virus goes around periodically, big thing now. that's perfectly fine level at. Nice.

Do primary schools still sing hymns? Cool give paid sick leave. Still lockdown. They've extended end week, think. vetoed deal ensure priority access uk.

Luckily even occur EU put selfish clause contracts. Something proud UK citizen maybe. proud EU luckily selfish society UK US... yet. guess EU crazy evil implementing vaccine export registration.

Also, UK everything right, need import AZ vaccines Netherlands? UK facilities ready yet. 

I disputing fact UK rollout great. great. irritating lots sub blaming EU selfish, EU clearly least selfish entire west, UK US selfish entire time. lots problem sub. gets is, made mistake twice locking early enough. First time March, autumn. correcting someone's poor maths. already continuously arguing that. People need ignore them. wonder Ireland even need vaccines time Britain ready share?

The EU gonna swimming vaccines coming months. read article first lockdown author computational biologist, argued zero covid strategy lockdown achieved, knew screwed point ilk charge, narrow view due highly specialised job, need panel experts fr multiple friends, including psychology, medicine, science, politics economics. rock called Trumps Incompetence. yuge. much favorite country there's border really can't close common travel area allows freedom movement even there's freedom movement EU. share island, wonder would want help 'favorite country' first  Australia prevented spread country may well enough prevent acute epidemic get people vaccinated. eradicated virus worldwide including numerous countries weeks long lock completely impractical unenforceable practice I'd pretty surprised accept certain level covid getting country vaccines distributed. Eradicating diseases hard, there's reason we've trying polio 30+ years still quite there. Thats awesome. want shot. Ill drive pretty far distance get one. Dont really care. want it. think confused, replying person said many friends suffer long covid. ""No, want McDonald’s. XD 30's number lower, likely closer 30.

In timespan normal year without lockdowns, people die traffic. Omg. Another thing. Oh, supply we're done. Hold up, favorite countries first. over, EU needed vaccines? helped amazing vax, leave EU too! Bojo nutshell. saying EU currently this, everyone (Edit: everyone strong, countries also export) else seems going exports doses policy. 

Not quite. certainly fear US would go route, practice everyone else said ""you can't preordered capacity"". UK bought first 100m doses AstraZeneca's production UK supply chain built especially pandemic serve UK needs. There's similar line thinking Pfizer's US production. strict export line there, another country paid AZ build-up capacity UK, build Pfizer capacity US believe there's outright restriction (although case Pfizer US think really capability scale capacity moot point).

In case EU's production facilities countries involved ordering AZ/Pfizer's EU supply chains paying scaling capacity EU allow shipping _outside_ EU. done production capacity would built elsewhere EU would received number doses now. ""if handle right"".

Which fair, won't. I'm worried going find reason force us keep social distancing post-vaccine. really seem regard normal human interactions dangerous think ideal. I'm pro-lockdown, article undersells difficult US point. took 7 weeks strict lockdown us eliminate virus NZ never 150 cases day went lockdown 25 cases day. 

In Melbourne began true lockdown 500 cases day took around 4 months could begin return relative normal. say would take 4 6 weeks honest. 

Another thing US would close borders travellers really also close state borders institute 2 week quarantine monitored electronic surveillance honour system. 

My view chance US come gone. country chance March-April 2020, areas got hit hard first wave chance cases dropped low summer. opportunities missed late now. lockdowns needed eliminate virus, save healthcare system collapse hold vaccines. yes. Economies *shouldn't* destroyed properly enforced lockdown. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam countries gone lockdowns come relatively unscathed.

It's COVID deniers improperly implemented lockdowns destruction economies. people caught exercising rights disregard needs many few, get useless lockdowns nothing hurt many.

If public health experts could foreseen humans would act stupidly purely selfish interest instead ensuring safety many. stupid them. think might another smaller wave spring similar wave last year final whimper don’t think widespread wave Im sorry brother. husbands cousin 36 healthy, got sick fast hard. We've also lost lot people 30s county due covid.  not.I read two weeks ago Dollar General thing. really like advertisement Health Canada that’s basically saying we’re taking health measures eventually get back living life normally. kind messaging health authorities using get people follow guidelines. did, probably wouldn’t much resistance probably fewer conspiracies “new normal”. anyone let know two doses Sinopharm vaccine chemically same?  Which, fair argue training job advise best policy avoiding transmission illness. people parrot 'trust experts!!!', comes policy affects entire lives, idea 'experts' multi-faceted gathering people several fields weigh positives negatives according professions. **one** field study dictating everything. Huge fuckup understatement. Art. 16 monumental failure error judgement Euco. across nation 10 million appear verge collapse, ambulances queuing sometimes hours lack beds health units struggling find enough refrigerated space preserve bodies. Officials blamed huge increase infection death rates contagious British variant disease, also acknowledged relaxation restrictions social contact Christmas holidays played role. January, total 5,576 people died coronavirus, representing 44.7% 12,482 fatalities since virus started spread Iberian country March last year, data health authority DGS showed. need close 100%. think.

I don’t really time morning link data. two days ago. suffice say, anyone wants review Google Journal America Medical Association (JAMA) covid risk schools, visit CDC school reopening website, review covid infection rates age, NPR discussion two international studies covid risks school. 

There reason governors mayors pushing hard reopen schools. Students failed closures know (and known now) schools contribute community infections. feel bad teachers trying. know super hard time guys too.

I'm coming point view someone grew abusive home went school kids also abusive homes and/or lived poverty. School safe place. loved school much, got early could stayed late could. know would happened school disappeared 2 years kid.  Yeah, can't indefinite lockdowns - people gotten burnt safety protocols economy reopen sometime. Lockdowns useless virus spread way has... 

It feels like real shame COVID could halted tracks back March properly implemented collective lockdown. countries mentioned shown possible, hoping mankind work together always going pipedream. regions / countries let individuals exclude 10+ day self-quarantine multiple daily tests return negative results? e.g. test positive, completely asymptomatic, go get daily tests 3 days, show negative. 
Or regions policies related studying false-positives? predicting doom good business. Europe deserves going get next decades people. Luckily stick around rotten continent see it. Pfizer Biontech?

Only factory Marburg produce 250 mln doses Q2. 

Novartis factory Stein also something. 

Plus current production Belgium. 

And everything, EU gets 250 mln middle Q3. Shame. Another triumph essentially free Oxford vaccine. Lol that's awesome. rough start, Wales catching now. bit behind England now. 

Here's country country breakdown figures: exact opposite, actually - herd immunity. top Indian vaccine official told Reuters even smaller percentage immunity could slow spread virus.

“Most highly populated districts cities run pandemic ... may like call herd immunity, extent,” Vinod Kumar Paul, heads committee vaccine strategy, said month.""

For reference, Delhi recently found 50-60% seropositive never eradicated virus unlimited animal reservoir ppl grasp means mainstream media dare speak it. already dealing onslaught variants created mass human infection going unbelievably difficult keep time goes numerous booster shots required top currently mass animal infections going without us even paying much attention it. already know dogs, cats, minks gorillas infected definitely numerous animals including concerning..rats. 

If ppl think can't possibly live like another year prepared floored reality mutations happen virus worlds animal population starts crossing back humans considering supposedly one little bat caused mess worlds animals infected cause? big pandemic happened 100 years ago. also going spread covid deaths *over 100 years* ignore deaths spread multiple years versus one concentrated event? math. potentially cheaper it.

Corporations moral standards. legal standards. Nice!!

How go drastically? Strict lockdown? Says across UK, Wales we’ve barely anyone vaccinated compared rest UK local hospitals doctors surgeries idea they’ll getting vaccine supplies in. lack planning information given government ridiculous. Who? happy hear this. Mom getting second dose Moderna sometime month take much stress me. past year Hell me, she’s high risk anytime I’ve gone pick groceries go anywhere I’ve gotten stressed don’t want responsible death. compliance mandate.   part conceivably true real catch applies employees McDonald’s, employees franchise locations. account 95% McDonald’s locations. 😫 Yes. first symptom, flu-like body aches.

Additionally, anecdotal all, time ended ER respiratory symptoms, doctor said never heard pneumonia painful. every shift patients bad body aches think kidney infection stones. totally new mRNA vaccine never used pandemic fine.
But standard normal vaccine weird?

Ungrateful little shite. really get Americans. HasanAbi segment week ago talking light end tunnel, vaccine rollout bad. US pretty good boring see blame one thing reward another. mind political points, hate one sided point scoring pandemic. Boring. Wait, Larry Page Google person name? Let’s honest mask mandates. large % people wear mask Walmart buy food dinner party 6 friends over.  get Covid say “if mask use work Covid still spreading?

(This literally neighbor family. 2 cases turned 12 count kids parent subsequently caught cluster). Countries like Bolívia, Peru Ecuador even thinking lockdowns 2021. 

It already difficult sustain lockdowns saving lives western advanced countries. even difficult poor countries societal costs lockdowns marginal gain lives saved. Exactly, post Christmas surge coming end Synthetic fur plentiful. Shut damn zombie industry super-mega Covid mutates inside another mink farm. industry needed.   Sounds like someone reelection pressing mayor Wow. February 1st, 2021. One year ago reading news headlines new virus continuing ravage China, people forced stay houses. remember handful cases popping US thinking, “eh, it’ll fine. It’ll get contained blow long. media immensely blowing proportion, it’s ridiculous.” LOL, man nooooo idea differently world look. Yes. two dose vaccine identical first second dose except Russian's Sputnik. Teacher given moral high ground future pay disputes. 

Whether people say publicly not, society remember much kids failed Teacher Unions Administrators, exaggerated claims covid risks schools...while completely ignored real risks students failed much higher rates. Ah yes course, rumor blessed magical fairy made buildings able negate scientific facts airborn virus spreads indoors poor ventilation hundreds kids close together.  Ohio managing fine vaccinating teachers time 70 plus community realistic safe hopes reopen start march.

With completely wasted school year already, extra month point brief contacts, infection unlikely possible. Denmark (after plan delivery uncertainties that) start vaccinating priority group 12 (out 12) first week May, end last week June. would published wasnt somewhat beliving it. including AZ disapointment.

If get re-infected, might infectious, would low end contagiousness scale. Animal studies shown become re-infected despite protective antibodies, less viral replication airway harder infect came contact them.  Covid-denying parents Facebook. That’s true. date isn’t “clear”, incomplete. Look many community spread cases known source. city, 90% cases known source yet claim isn’t spreading schools. 

Closing schools second largest impact R0. say data clear kids aren’t spreading based lack data. could say younger kids spread less older kids, data still shows spread it. 

Source: super cool seeing success vaccines. worked US FDA 12-13 years ago pandemic preparedness highly pathogenic avian influenza using RNA technology develop vaccine potency reagents well vaccine candidates event outbreak severe avian influenza could prevent traditional vaccine methods used. actually put technology test Swine Flu H1N1 broke proof principle see far we've advanced since incredible. future now! Contrary conspiracists say, technology developed long period time rigorously tested long even year, pandemic necessitated advancement technology we've pushed theoretical practical, fucking awesome. I'd like try proper discussion I'll bite - admit first post response guy complaining lockdowns relatively kneejerk comprehensively outline position lockdowns.

My reply stated lockdown 100% stop economic activity, restrict movements people working non-essential industries. Food, shipping, utilities - need continue strict supervision ensure spread virus. point buying something online forcing others ""work me"" leg stand - that's entire **purpose** lockdown. people like work home essential industries continue proper health protocols ensure spread virus halted. 

The point mask illustrate sometimes need give creature comforts good many. find extremely disingenuous call 5 day lockdown inhumane. Unless meant it'd inhumane would affect small retail businesses restaurant owners. Otherwise, complaining 5 day lockdown first world problem sign touch real world issues. 

I'm well aware costs SMEs F&amp;B businesses incur agree people hardest hit lockdowns. I'm opinion governments set aside aid smaller businesses declare moratoriums loans specific tax bracket. Countries like Canada got right ensuring population receives adequate sustained aid throughout pandemic.

My take lockdowns going implement it, properly ensure sufficient enforcement protocols thought prepared for. There's point forcing small businesses, eateries, bars close penalize render lockdowns inefficient flouting social distancing proper mask protocols. Lockdowns useless harm good prepared what's necessary.

Basically I'm unhappy *how* lockdowns imposed definitely see cure-all pandemic. Schools don’t spread covid. know this. data clear. don’t ask police officers stop working get vaccine doctors, grocery store workers, public transport workers, fire fighters. draw line workers putting risk, jobs society says must continue?

Taking vaccine away someone 75 older giving teacher, result deaths hospitalisations. Chiraq.....f

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Hi animus. Let’s try conversation instead hurling insults ehh? 

Are asserting viruses like sars-2 don’t mutate? mutations don’t chance happening every replication? every additional person infected involves additional replications, additional chances mutations? mutations might make current vaccines less effective? 

What part disagree with?  Whether side effects indicate less antibodies post-vaccination. understand desire get kids back classroom, pandemic horrible children’s development, mayor seems asking teachers return en masse without vaccines. Yes, covid next nothing children, important make sure teachers vaccinated one hand, MIGHT feel sick day, two. ideal eh. 
On hand, theres high chance die actual virus time. 
 
Of course text express concerned actually it, could hell lot worse taking it. Ahh okay thank you! She’s sent email asking today. Best health family :)   wasnt case jan 20th makes case now? people need stop treat Fauci like god, others definitely need stop overreacting every utterance he's issuing official government policy answering questions.

I think one things needs is, needs stop going interviews, q sessions often is.

Think like, that, opportunities going say stuff leads confusion negative impacts necessarily want. think would actually much loss this. Truth is, flow new information great need constant updates him, it'll benefit it'll give time actually pin information disseminating it. Damn dawg, gotta dirty like that?

 Love, normal person cool vaccines like creation drama dramas sake unless actual drama ABC. What's PTO? Drowning ""discomfort""

But drowning... 

Who cares disgusted? work national security? not, matter incentive, however, available workers McDonald’s locations owned McDonald’s corporation, 5% company’s total workforce.

Sounds like 95% McDonalds probably like experience. good person though walking getting tested. know many jobs keep experience mind it'll provide good answer lot future interview questions. advised double masks  Yeah. is. Yes is. literally makes feel like drowning. psychological okay. guess discomfort definition

Drowning recently. last time someone locked given trial? know when? cool

Do know when? What's point.

Regardless torture, still holding people without trial. disgusting right per capita useful either. India primarily young first place, better talk much 60 vaccinated? There's always nuance needed, saying there's 1.35billion get per capita stat useful (and everyone knows that, even remove billion Indians, still Indians Americans) feel now? 3-4 days later. hope better working towards immunity completely ! Fuck late, lung damage rate severity bear out? Despite missteps, always fucked. fat aging population combined service based economy, means matter charge always going one worst death rates battered economy. Could better, definitely. think people need realise rosey another government charge bottom line, responsible health. want covid, interact anyone. Simple that. friend fever 2 days felt crappy. She’s ok tho :) Nope, Sanofi Novartis helping fill vials last steps making finished product.

lol okay. guess discomfort recently. last time someone locked given trial? lawyer?

So know when? cool cases deaths india days? remember went tough time last year. people vulnerable. totally see people setting “care homes” get rich healthy people vaccinated eligibility criteria. worked Lowes would pay flu shots. Hospitals require provide flu shots employees. Employers could lot towards getting people vaccinated various important things. It'd benefit company preventing sick time lost production also help society general.


I think businesses would ever actually though various reasons, think responsibility (although people take enough personal responsibility either), also enough faith businesses smart enough know exceptions made, required, etc.


I'm also point might well forced thing. Enough people science illiterate can't actually understand ""facebook research"" wrong valid excuse. They're going complain matter what, might well protect rest society. power couple.

(Go on, weren’t expecting positive responses 😉 ) is. literally makes feel like drowning. psychological last time someone waterboarded anyway?

Too recently. last time someone locked given trial? lawyer? Wow

Holy fuck that’s bad. Look line, Police tried using water canons. people stood taking shower. can't fire smoke grenades' inside city. secular mass gatherings also within city tactics can't used. look large Arab protests they're nearly open area's away cities. Thus stronger response used. Yup know ppl got positives afraid call previous contacts, bc thought would look “dirty”. pandemic moralized shameful. probably not, still need approval.. 

so +2 weeks automatically.

it's feb 1 already! Yeah there's one WA there's nothing state. fed bullshit. I’m sure it’s entirely fear mongering. I’ve seen fauci reliable people pretty worried uk variant don’t outpace vaccine. Nice. pay everyone actual living wage   Please explain headquartered country key influencing decision making.

Facts please. mode foncabnginf doctors. agree, unfortunately work tends care people say doctor says ask get tested.

And, let's say, know Covid cough sounds like. keep opinions know they'd get mocked conspiracy theorists. Always someone else’s fault isn’t it...  Israel yet seen steep drop new cases. article says however confirmed fully vaccinated people seeing expected 94%+ resistance catching virus getting seriously ill. good news expect see cases drop yet. We'll likely see drops deaths, hospitalizations, cases. No, last time someone waterboarded anyway? It’s manageable take ibuprofen sleep off. think lasted like 12-14 hours good go after. Way better possible unknown Covid complications explanation? think people susceptible catching shit others. haven’t flu since 1999. barely remember wash hands. school age children. literally hardly think germs. spent afternoon today digging goodwill outlet bins fun. 

We working false pretense pandemic infection mostly controllable. reduce chances, people less control think unless barricade inside house. ppl going live take care someone Covid positive get it, going walk past positive case grocery store pick up. Oddly - none careless don’t care people know - gotten it. vast majority ppl know get it, got something workplace related (or housemate got work) idea. Maybe lying think maybe not. I’ve less careful nothing.  Lads, oi! Lads!

Oh, applauding kid saved money give fellow student lunch school year. anything, fact they're applauded shows screwed culture be. every country shared vulnerable would take 2 years top groups, including key workers. 65 without clinical vulnerabilities. unlikely schools would able open time let alone hospitality industies travel. going happen.

It might take 2 years based current vaccination rates, vaccines approved production ramped would take long actuality. worry schools opened country, expect happen schools countries get vaccine destroyed economies leaving less money invest plants production

Personally would prefer per capita percentage types stats related anything covid irrespective (eg India, China, UK, us wherever) allows mind visualise it.

I personally think take away achievement India feel hope India able make massive progress especially promising contracts place vaccine production.

I sure poster deserved much animosity asking percapita stats. assignment learn whole new definition actual poverty poverty paper only. 

Yeah, I'm going waste time searching this, want consider it, send link.

 point this, Haredim treated like citizen, currently not. whole reason lockdown useless police enforce areas. secular arab protest police would seconds, protest, meaning democratic meaning, bunch dumbasses endangering society police nothing ""to avoid violence"", pussies. Yeah I've seen enough people talk 2nd shot worse maybe 1st shot covid nice PSA people aware of. 


Of 3 people family gotten vax far:

1 never covid, 1st shot felt fine, 2nd shot arm bit sore couple days needing extra sleep/feeling bit sluggish next day (like someone drinks lot coffee skips day). Someone else posted thing FB. women 30's.

1 covid spent days hospital oxygen think steroids, got hit pretty hard recovered. 60's, obese, smoker. Got 1st vax shot hear complaints.

1 covid symptoms. 60's, obese, smoker, etc. Got 1st shot complaints. There's restaurant blocks house, right next door bar. packed capacity daily. bar open like normal. zero restrictions town.

This good news think correct. spike protein changes much can't attach human cells anymore, can't infect anyone. Sounds like induces quite robust immune response!

Does sick get mean better immune response? Maybe body makes antibodies? Surprisingly vaccination guarantee paper got two shots expiring 6 months. how's relevant lol realise ordered vaccines? That's article said Still pretty tired, definitely improved.  Yeah 'booster' shot taking amount vaccine again, weeks later. thing Pfizer Moderna. politicians, celebrities athletes getting it, vast majority elderly people getting since high-risk category. overall 72% protection better 0 Look licensing agreement.........

Go on. I'll wait.  They're altering mRNA vaccines account mutations variants. 

Deep breath. true, dealing public health crisis also important realistic supported policy. definitely 'stretch' targets, testing capacity, others poorly thought even completely made up. Schools last close absolutely lie stage (in-laws go visit kitchen showroom kids school). test trace even met single target without moving goalposts? Government policy actively undermined efforts throughout (lack support isolating, privatising t&amp;t expense local expertise etc). UK contract stated UK first 100m doses produced UK factories start going elsewehere, factories EU reserved EU. UK signing contracts 3 months EU meant factories running quicker EU factories getting speed now. vaccine ""theft"" lot politics trying cover slow undercooked procurement process EU.

EU signed AZ last week. brother's kids wore masks school family school aged kids avoided covid know. know would suck greatly maybe could also conisiser wearing mask home (around kid) schools closed again? Hope get safe. Fuck push reopen schools. Oh woops haha bad. Totally missed part. Thanks correction! medical advice comes MHRA JCVI. Neither politically motivated. made assumptions Pfizer data may work end. know release study data week. 

Most people getting AZ/Oxford vaccine anyway. Honestly looks like otherwise fairly unremarkable second wave, akin countries Europe experienced.  Even variant caused massive surge according highest estimated contagiousness, we’ve got vaccines now. UK probably enough spare capacity sell EU, we're constructing vaccine facilities need. Hold Coronavirus!! 🙌 💎 

No, wait.. real question NFL could figure public health officials? US around world health officials preaching 2 meter/6 foot distancing stating brief contacts huge risk year. could drop ocean compared humanitarian fallout. “We’ve seen 400,000 die COVID-19,” David Beasley, Executive Director World Food Programme, warned June. “We could see 300,000 die day, several months, don’t handle speaking panel United Nations leaders UN Global Compact Leaders Summit, explained things already bad pandemic. “Before COVID hit scene, already saying 2020 going worst humanitarian crisis year since World War II.” It’s estimated 9 million people die hunger year, death toll AIDS, malaria tuberculosis combined.

sobering  Agreed, choose poison. family lived freely throughout. 

No lockdowns state. Would utterly unthinkable people near-house arrest months, cops demanding see papers 'curfew'. 

Once accepted that, genie's bottle. get dabble bit police state, Rubicon crossed.

Given many Australians ancestors transported chains, wonder whether easier, culturally, people accept lockdowns normal. fascinating topic.

Ultimately, freedom always tension safety, sake slight 5% spike death rates year state, suspect chose wisely.  It’s refreshing finally something done well. Almost like leaving experts right idea.

I’m also glad it’s done fairly: NHS dealing it, vulnerable people first, paying jump queue, you’ll get get it.

Seeing weeks ago needed averaging 2m week gave usual feeling dread we’ll fall short numbers creeping up, hit average 300k day/2.1m week seemed positive doubled fantastic. really feel like end sight. Perth's first lockdown since April last year.

For scale, nightclubs closed 5am morning news hit. police state here, pretty cozy one. I’m sorry. opt stick remote learning?

I'm sure there'll plenty too. 

Ps, happy cake day! doesn’t feel bad three legged dog? wouldn’t get side effects. didn’t get immediately took good 10-12 hours shot get Yes, lockdowns presumably they'd still young healthy then. facts side give right fucking asshole. go life living like that, making everyone miserable around you. _Over 50 years_.

Where comparison point? many tangentially related COVID deaths would UK never locked down, 50yr timeline? Heck, 4,000 estimated deaths due people avoiding healthcare due concern virus. expect without lockdowns, they'd merrily gone along get health problems checked? mom step-dad got vaccine earlier expected Mom answered phone clinic called looking patients 65+ could come doses pulled day wouldn’t spoil. 

So thank show people doing...nothing all. 

Paying employees get COVID-19 vaccine, especially we’re “it’s lottery” phase brainer.  Thank caring. Thats unfortunate. read somewhere ( know reliable is) trying buy 200m doses Novavax. question delivered. 100m delivered 1st half year would take win. goes different name here. whole acronym threw off.

But that's really shithouse got shitcunts like let get jabs without leave. Absolutely ridiculous. really depend caseloads impacted lots people half jab (most waiting 3 months second jab 2 weeks they're protected) decisions re-opening based caseload vaccine rollout, latter significantly impact former (you'd hope)   think Germany eye balling order apply pressure ECM let push vaccination plans. contract said: every factory counted forbthe destribution, matter place is.

England factory us families countries Serious question: happens someone feels bad day after? allowed skip day off? get trouble work that?

It depends, probably not, probably. Yet doesn’t feel like anyone has, reason expected vaccinations stations set places like Walmart parking lots shit  felt similar first times went spring get groceries. got better don’t even think it. push times you’ll surprised. spent decades old way - come back quick. Yeah, choose poison guess. I'm pretty happy able visit family friends worries now, basically one died even really got covid comparison.

Its also freedoms want though really, probably allready lost lot freedoms take granted. 

We wear masks lock times, get massive gov assistance job support. hope system also provides base great life. True, effective going hurt anything. I’m sorry loss I’m sorry treated shamefully situation. They're probably coming scheduled deliveries non-UK non-EU countries. wrapped convenient deniability -- AZ ""readjusts delivery schedules"" -- obscure fact countries screwed cover European Commission's ass.  recent case actually Israeli citizens throwing shit Palestinian kids Israeli police put stop it, ending car chase harassers maintain control vehicle died rounding corner crashing. locals got angry put sign basically says ""No police allowed here! kill own, respect police!"" like oh fuck try anti police instance right thing 😬 J+J *might* get feb approval, unless delay see 2 jab system better system. Fair point - vaccination process done normal circumstances. Meaning, unlike preventable diseases vaccine, milder case covid still result (mild) neurological modifications. 

I like idea JnJ, love risk it. point game, 2 step system seems like better safer approach. Sorry, read article says week passed. So, calculations, unvaccinated people 6x higher probability catch virus fully vaccinated people Novavax seems promising, realistically EU get doses late delivery ordered late. hopes Curevac now. They’re trying generate new headline Yes Covid way risk list honestly most. third world younger overweight populace. Covid biggest threat old unhealthy young ppl. Nah. It'll like flu: people get vaccinated never works spreading variant year, sort live risk. world lucky get 1 covid vaccination end 2021, countries talking starting vaccines lower-risk groups 2022 now. took years 1918 flu wind down, same. 2023 care it'll back normal, corona endemic forever. getting shots? *first fast food hopefully snow trashed numbers last weekend. Although snow-day vaccination can't complain much suppose. ? factories Belgium problem ones England ? 

The contract EU signed stated every factories counted vaccin distribution (no factory anyone particuly) say t. UE released contract company lied...
England factories England everyone.  57% included aids patients variant. Factored believe it’s high 60s. It’s also one shot. 2 likely higher, closer Pfizer etc. Also Novavax seems promising. EU buys gets approved even faster. letting Army logistics department handle logistics.

You mean letting people actually experts something rather selling job one donors? Well fuck me.  thought Louis Pasteur discovered cure Rabbis. Dude, stop. make good points delivery terrible. empathy. friends age gotten covid (upper 30') vast majority went fine one died, death broke us all.

Have empathy. Kinda point. Could tell many days passed average since got fully vaccinated? Exactly. business. long people willing work low post reason pay higher So, words don’t understand biology.
Nothing purpose, never said did, you’re either deploying straw man don’t understand said.
Genes evolve propagation advantageous traits increase adaption environment. Evolution random, mutation random. 
Viruses evolve subject selection pressures, may cause virus become virulent. 
Criticising promoting unscientific view viral evolution pretty ironic isn’t it?   Haven’t seen McDonald’s like while. ones near re-designed/refreshed/updated whatever Learn use Yes, does. son going back person schooling tomorrow chances are, brings home virus, get it, compromised immune system likely die. destination countries access vaccines entire adult population think go away. may take longer think, bc less resources say, Caribbean hope enjoy it. Accepting police state arbitrary removal freedoms high price many, including me. comment pathetic wife works hospital active outbreak 80+ (5% entire staff 3 days) aren’t vaccinating people floors affected :( seems inevitable move floors. Instead vaccinating random rural towns north agree. take pain meds second dose ? Waaay down. peaked 1M active cases Sept, we're 160k now. Let’s go Colorado! Can’t wait it’s turn. Essentially, yes. You’re actually sick though. It’s bodies natural immune response, hitting heavier essentially body reacting strongly presence “the virus” (not really virus). good news! I'm group 6 vaccine phase priority list getting Thursday rapidly moving list! Think said yesterday 13% population least 1 dose vaccinated nearly 600k people Saturday alone really moving fast. Coming Europe, took moment understamd headline article - seriously inconcievable people would get paid time kind situations :o

Serious question: happens someone feels bad day after? allowed skip day off? get trouble work that?

In country, you’d get paper doctor you’re work, company obliged pay days - think get paid back public health insurance time later on. sure term either, type dystopian ""feel-good"" stories found in:

/r/ABoringDystopia/  CDC report sparked article Wall Street Baltimore ravens article mentioned wsj piece Still 98k deaths way many Didn’t get deal plead misdemeanor little jail time? justice served? mutations away become like one them

1. cannot say zero evidence possible outside sci-fi twist
2. became like MERS SARS would actually easier stop people showed symptoms infectious tended die able spread it. I’m glad see sub psycho scared anymore. while, wasn’t good place fear high. irritate though skeptics said along would consequences lockdowns called manner names sudden, sub cares. Guess getting McDouble week. change it, made mistake. Oh good. Zombies. 20/hr, union membership, 4 weeks vacation, paid FML. Although agree degree, never know bad couldve lockdowns never happened. sit say useless want, without them, dont know situation wouldve worse. Doomed do, doomed dont. laugh whenever hear this. dude everyone around 30 chance dying driving car COVID. here. friends Pakistanis none us give damn whole india Pakistan dispute. far common separates us. mean we're one country long ago. anyone feel like ordering vaccine post? make cry. translate Merkel language human one.

""Germany cancel lockdown 2022""

End summer means end September - production planned normally per quarter year. Full immunity 2 weeks. Middle Oktober. 

But best-case scenario.

Let's add delay(s) production. delay production, inevitable, decrease delivery EU, ""EU slow, EU toothless, EU impotent"".

So 2021 year full lockdown Germany. 

Dear Europeans, please patient calm. maybe dont friends medical fields. know 43 people vaccinated! bad way shrug healthy fit COVID killed tiny percentage group people?  do. doomed, never doomed. killing people yes, think end human race, painful sad species going extinct. considered doomed even nothing, still probably ""doomed"" Indian origin here. friends Pakistanis get along fine. alot common media governments suggest tried reading article, continue longer said ""by 2024 may party"" Yup, pretty line. People stop drinking, changed got alcohol. Check data Fluoxetine fluvoxamine sound similar. someone taken currently taking former, definitely confusing. dunno, still lockdown semi enforced still overwhelmed hospitals. think still tough couple months.  surprising. sign vaccine trials, detailed informing participants receiving. change that, even error, inform participants (regardless arm in), unethical. people dying got infected month ago. It'll take little longer. Hey! I’m thinking taking Fluvoxamine. OCD too, pretty crippling severe. actually isn’t bad side effect wise? I’m kind paranoid reason haven’t taking meds general. I’m dealing somewhat. I’m independent contractor sales individual hotels across US. got 1099 day lost $20,000 income 2019. Hotels lost lot money last year it’s going take years get back 2019 numbers. hotels aren’t making money don’t want pay anything deem extra, meaning don’t want pay services right now. I’ve held hotels cut rate get stay. still seeing occupancies mid 20% range right now. 

This year boyfriend going start looking buy house don’t know we’re going able anytime soon taking drastic pay cut year year. 

The whole situation mentally exhausting. don’t tell specific people impacted. told everyone. Holding back vaccine dosage changes participants ethical. Two theories have. One maybe foreign aid help developing countries two maybe case new variants popping people need vaccinated boost immunity. Ok leave there. still get unfortunately.

AZ gives estimation cost goods. That's paid for. contract states EU cannot let AZ make loss vaccine. cost goods probably lower Europe. nothing EU trying get lower prices. tried disable ate battery :( civil. great news. agree trial data elderly poor, surely vaccine good enough 55 year old give 54 year old? people early 50s Italy thinking vaccine barely protect them. Fuck McDonald’s okay grandad lets get bed Lordy gloomy. press US left dire pessimistic be. look actual numbers see bright light end tunnel right there. managed hold getting covid last 11 months really want vaccine probably 2 months hold. doesnt affect them. Hell, benefits them. even better news vaccination appears turn COVID-19 something milder flu (in terms illness). think point article severity illness concern, transmission. reason latter part matters (and requires severe mitigation measures we've deal almost year now) potentially dangerous former part is. danger removed, need measures reduce transmission diminish (and view, disappear much faster people believe). Nah, like countries bad wanted point fingers US. 

When countries test half much US many deaths per capita ask ""what's wrong US response?"" tends come across douche baggery. saying don’t think vaccination roll going well suggests outside EU “worked well us”. 
 
No not, responding said I'm supporter UK outside EU. comment ""I know there's always but"" suggests suspicion upon true opinions Brexit, Brexit supporter disguise.
 
You even suggested said endorsement Brexit. never was, said part EUs vaccine role program chance happened work favour. Emoji allowed titles. Make new submission plain text title.

It’s possible, bad choice pandemic. It’s time drive hard bargain. thought could make difference bullying Astrazenneca. People telling since June. Grandparents still kicking haven’t even gotten virus despite giving almost respect.

Random epidemiologist told media something isn’t science, it’s appeal authority crunching numbers right even possible consider lockdown poor country analogy, wear mask social distance pisshead takes corner wrong side road twice speed limit still dead. Right amounts epidemic pissheads roads. won’t follow suggestions need made follow rules. Seems, people here, EU, happy lockdown. 

Or, correctly, they, EU people, prefer sit lockdown forever take jab. Facebook group somebody said, vaccine investigated enough.

May EU commission right buying vaccines? worry bureaucracy. January mess everywhere supplying risk groups complicated task. Many vulnerable basically vegetables (been there). vaccinating regular folks going issue, we're vaccinating tens millions within month influenca year. tool EU use punish Brexit travel restrictions. even already fairly wide spread continental Europe. Yikes ethics breach. first world shut third world started starve. KNEW TIME. thinking actually. J&amp;J probably even used struggling supply chain badly. Yeah, sympathy teachers seems like world governments saying schools safe want be.   250 million specifically one plant. I’m referring total deliveries EU/EEA Marburg production. UK even skewed upwards - nearly 75% deaths 75+.  insane put interest 0.5% population everyone else's. agree. Middle class people desire daycare can't lean politicians put kids school. right. top this, millions Filipinos family abroad. expected reach zero COVID never travel visit ever country forces ridiculous urban density poverty, can't take time work expect government check? Everybody blaming UK variant luck running lax social distancing measures. We've screaming months now. anti-covid measures lockdowns, curfews, school closures, border shutdowns selfish, ineffective, fail protect 0.5% vulnerable. That's actually plenty. 10 vs 0 types sample sizes much statistically significant. That's impossible choice all. correct answer obvious. EU/EEA. Also Canada Israel

Question again. Factory Marburg brand new, belongs Biontech yet started production, question 

Do 250 mln confirmed EU/EAA/Canada/Israel/other Pfizer(from **2 billions** total 20202) include production Marburg not? Yeah, perhaps bit ambitious there. Looking numbers hospitalization (probably important number), decreased 37k 95k 24 days. maintain pace probably around 40k decrease 28 days Feb. quite half close. we've read early numbers reflect vaccinations yet (personally think probably somewhat), perhaps kick see bottom drop out. also FIRST Robotics kid! loved much, meant got stay school 10 build season. actually got am. national award FIRST lead getting major scholarship really good engineering school. Seriously can't say enough good first.

You sound like great teacher. hope get resources need keep do. Let's honest though, people paranoid big tech feds spying (and rightfully so), never going take off. holding breath thinking official data Candidate 72% Effective US 66% Effective Overall Preventing Moderate Severe COVID-19, 28 Days Vaccination*  granger, tons also risk considerably lower outdoors. People one place long, wind disperses particles pretty quickly sun sterilizes what's left. AZ producing SA. J&amp;J maybe guardian body choice spreading disease place like Typhoid Mary. That's well good want industry die, think worth acknowledging likely vaccine cards utilized least extent.


I think concerts, though, unlikely require vaccination cards.

Your post incredibly myopic. go straight 20k indoor packed venue.

1500 red rocks masks allowed pack 20k unmasked patrons Pepsi Center. margins might slim enough ends mattering (IE, start issuing permits Option 1 events starting March 15th announce March 1st one really scramble fast, Option 2 April 1st everyone opts Option 2), definitely exists world open smaller outdoor concert venues large indoor stadiums. Could also see indoor stadiums capacity crowds start.

I also think assessment maks bit off. Masks still great policy alongside social distancing. Put everyone 6 feet away groups wear masks better 6 feet away. Yes, shoulder shoulder masks going block transmission utilized deep this, could used way kickstart industry month earlier waiting risk overloading hospitals gone. consumption holding relatively steady Fauci: ""Even get vaccinated lock down, wear mask, can't hug shake hands travel."" Banning flights could still prevent new variants spreading like wildfire Germany. Although they're still allowing ither countries may much. Probably makes sense ban flights rather specific countries send IDF? That's usually people places Israel want be. completely intentionally miss point. Billions people lost year lives save lives million. point worth it. Contaminated surfaces used thought viruses spread, apparently much thing Covid, never understood why.

Um think mainstream news like Fox, CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS ever report facts, I’m sorry falling right trap. rely negative overly biased news get people listen them. couldn’t care less reporting actual facts. basically tabloids. Well, long us care health continue without forced back dangerous situations midst ongoing pandemic...

28 DAYS LATER. probably fudging tests. known start schools play minor role That's bad science.

40 cases track school. young people asymptomatic tracking infection back school going work. can't get good data like this. look infection rates school lockdoens Vs infection rates without. look forward first teams south open stadium full capacity get told irresponsible greedy media get told off.  EU resident, I’d love quicker access vaccines like UK US, however late access Sanofi vaccine total failure AZ huge production delays. couple months get hundreds millions vaccines delivered every month. It’s likely continue spread virus vaccine starts working. true vast majority vaccines, likely true one, too. People need stop parroting this. seems like opinion piece - type articles paper usually publishes? I’ve read factual articles facing vaccine disaster. Whereas countries like Israel, Britain United States. quickly moving ahead vaccinations, EU reeling string setbacks. First, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer German partner BioNTech informed Brussels would delivering far less vaccine planned coming weeks. Then, company AstraZeneca said would delivering 31 million doses vaccine end March instead 80 million Europe expecting. again, Commission caught completely guard.

How exactly could plan companies delivering promised deliveries? Good. needs balance.

Cant full open, can’t full shut.

Glad see states localities thoughtful balancing. Well, yeah. Botched vaccine rollouts, pandemic fatigue, new variants, partial-escape mutations, etc. multi-year affair. Hiya, right ofc, case helps, term looking might ""bottleneck"" - commonly used constriction slows flow :) think so. Transmission surfaces supposedly pretty rare. Kids much less likely get infected much less likely spread adults. Fighting “yes understand need lockdowns let’s really think this” fight past year mentally draining. looked up. AZ selling vaccine profit well. nice way marked price South Africa countries. moral. think throwing clothes hamper soon get home really makes difference reducing transmission non-healthcare workers?

Obviously working hospital nursing home, it’s smart idea people industries really gain additional protection it? homes allowed visitors.

Which might case location state everywhere else. Also employees part ""young people group"" apprentices older employees get whole range 16/18 yo (depending country) till 60, inbetween lot twenties/thirties. always case. Here's publication ECDC confirming it: 70,000 country 10,000,000 LOT people unvaccinated moving across borders. Remember every Israeli able get vaccinated, I'm sure rules pregnant people, certain chronic illnesses, perhaps homeless populations, children, people certain religious beliefs (if indeed relevant rule believers taking vaccines - I'm sure true could possible) may vaccinated everyone able vaccinated is, nobody safe. makes sense people moving borders work reasons bringing/taking covid them. really hope Israel right thing ensures safe timely access vaccines. want go politics let's keep strictly vaccine related here, benefits Israel well Palestine united front comes vaccination, better citizens. corporate employees, less 5% McDonalds working population need regulate wage law majority workforce unionized less dangerous teachers? believe point here. FYI finding new variants dangerous children. much UK closing schools again. 

But let’s keep point. Teachers risk. teachers due illness death. school. regardless decide sacrifice end less school long run. Yeah, presume sell long run logistic wise mRNA vaccine lot easier deal with. Seemingly lot Chicago teachers avoiding jobs downvote today. Anyone believes Chicago schools offer person education gets hammered sub. one wants engage relative comparison rest country though.  lot (neo)nazis see such. like well known ""I'm racist but...) called things fake news people wouldn’t look facts. Like bankrupted casinos, trump university scam, called crash landing trump airlines beautiful landing (an airline failed part due blinging planes), he’s basically reverse Midas. Thanks archived link! agree worth reading. Yet unfortunately reason article removed ""not high quality information"" Give us decent alternative then. People voted liked alternative better. 

I studied major parties manifestos best bad bunch. certainly going vote Labours renationalisation Lib Dems offer. urge possible readers skip one want informativne view matter. german laundry washing, Ursula bashing germans germans. Waste time. Skip. virus really got us balls 
🍒😢 good see. Given climate almost wonder bonus would order well? get paid time plus extra $250 getting doses something.  3000 people die day covid.

Not really fear mongering losing many. It’s telling what’s going on. Kind sucks species dependent society forgotten forage berries wilderness plant hunt starving. :( least five vaccines pretty effective coming soon That’s disease, don’t know it’s symptom receiving vaccine Same! J&amp;J report: study, definition severe COVID-19 disease included laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: signs consistent severe systemic illness, admission intensive care unit, respiratory failure, shock, organ failure death, among factors. Moderate COVID-19 disease defined laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 one following: evidence pneumonia, deep vein thrombosis, shortness breath abnormal blood oxygen saturation 93%, abnormal respiratory rate (≥20); two systemic symptoms suggestive COVID-19."" Schools always one safer environments pandemic. Closing criminal. young careless people risk bringing homes.

It's mostly employees, homes allowed visitors. Listen, acknowledge J&amp;J's efficacy (particularly South Africa variant) leaves something desired.

But looking efficacy symptomatic COVID call whole ball game. J&amp;J's efficacy severe COVID quite good. stage pandemic, that's big win.

6 months enough vaccines US go around, okay, maybe start talking using highly effective ones, time ENSEMBLE 2 hopefully finished would surprised J&amp;J's double dosing strategy also high 90s efficacy could start giving second shots J&amp;J everyone well boost immunity. I’ve work everyday since started don’t cry feeling uNSAFe. teachers entitled pieces crap. Everyone else working lazy asswipes stay home PJs.  problem (for ""journalists"") actual news pretty static moment, cases, deaths hospitalisations generally coming down, vaccination rates going things going gradually improve people.

They need jump anyone saying something massively negative, rarely massively positive, get clicks. January school district Alabama lost 4 teachers week died COVID. Georgia 2 teachers died COVID week last month. Without plan get teachers vaccinated accommodate PR re-election stunt seems Lightfoot willing put teachers lives risk save political career. think point majority Americans see end. faintest idea CNN talking about. claim. proof young people giving old predominantly. Americans continue fight every step way. cannot get country individualistic give shit leadership actually handle it. 

That said, lots people still trying, understand hard would stuck 10 months everyone else goes living ""normally"" furthering spread. 

I'm American, sort understand mindset. defending it, saying get it. live anymore. Yay. Fair point, seems that's heading given zero new cases.  Looks like that's what's happening, 0 new cases. can't believe selfish people stay home ~~two weeks~~ ~~one month~~ ~~three months~~ ~~half year~~ single year! That’s going happen. understand feelings though, honestly think better idea start living. think someone paying money use drones track rural indian populations?  can't believe people stay home ~~two weeks~~ ~~one month~~ ~~three months~~ ~~half year~~ single year! area (Southern California) third deaths pandemic January, lines Christmas gatherings main culpriit. 

I see super bowl, likely involve lot house parties people gathering illegally operating bars, cause another surge. bias blame UK EU vaccine mess? sure smart one. 😂 think goal stamp rather give contact tracers time identify close contacts get isolating.  ""Pivoting"" manufacturing capability completely different type vaccine sounda like could expensive time consuming. Wasting time resources hundreds millions billions doses less effective vaccine could produced. think things pivot towards effective products long term, now, spnding effort re-tool production facilities seem sensible. There's tests required there's little spreading, contact tracing 100x effective China's anal tests. /s don’t problem vaccines, asking us take risks. People vaccine may get moderately sick definition moderate pneumonia deep vein thrombosis! work home order groceries in. wait one out. Also, feels they’re expecting minorities get less effective ones rich celebrities, athletes, politicians not. mean, becoming police state.

No thanks. Rural Texans drive hundreds miles BBQ. sayin' Australia police state, now. that's even worse downside. Also really care. glad police keeping riff raff beaches.  Agreed. Games snow beginning season postseason getting dangerously close Thanksgiving irritating. Well, people might stop complying, businesses probably able get away ignoring government restrictions. people, huge chunk 'living freely enjoying life' relies - 'bar scene' nightlife stuff bars allowed host fashion.

But restrictions probably gonna gone anyway. Israel’s health ministry released first official results last week, showing 317 715,425, 0.04%, people became infected week becoming fully vaccinated disease – time increased immunity expected kick in. vaccinated people infected, 16 treated hospital, 0.002% total. places appropriate allowed, yes. Good know look, nobody else deal want multiple different reasons. think showing children's school daycare completely naked okay slightly unhinged. getting there. guy uploads vaccine calendar type dont read comments, lot anti vaxxers.  flat saying “it’s ridiculous ask people double mask point” depends cases actually show community. NZ covid positive women go lot places get single additional cases, lockdown.

Our strategy bit different. lockdown unless there's proof spread community. 1 case enough. 2 probably would long second person live household original case. Facts? daily thread? go get daily dose misinformation, misrepresentation hyperbole. Facts usually get downvoted here. That's disappointing hear. commission much competence buying vaccines deflecting blame finding scapegoats. I've seen quite people cite 8x, think referring odds ""ineffective"" (yes, know ineffective correct word) J&amp;J 35%, moderna 5% (I remember exact numbers). really good way compare effectiveness vaccine. could similarly say 99% vaccine 10x likely get covid 99.9% vaccine since ""ineffectiveness"" 1% vs. 0.1%. I'd argue better compare 65% 95% effective 35% 5% ineffective.

This also ignores J&amp;J protects severe symptoms. get tested you’re vaccinated? 29 year old labmate said exact thing! take next day getting second Pfizer/BNTech dose. Sounds like induces quite robust immune response!

My institution actually recommending people plan anything physically demanding following day specifically second dose. Unfortunately suspect vast majority institutions, companies, employers charitably take account though. 

Congrats full vaccination course btw! stories like make live very, carefully got 2nd shot (work hospital). really want fodder conspiracies vaccinated Saturday! proud NHS. 2M bat Feb, unspecific millions beginning March 100M first 6 months. ...no. ""no true Scotsman"" fallacy. 

There single actual lockdown US, every one partial, supported financial assistance, barely enforced. 

Using US example lockdowns work like saying seatbelts save lives people ***weren't wearing one*** got hurt. worked unpaid hospital bed literally labor. worked unpaid maternity leave. ""for kids"" one else would stepped help them. subs year, especially high poverty schools like one teach at. 

When get care safety welfare child without society calling selfish I've already given nearly help students? talk laying thousands us next fall funding going down, kids even fewer teachers trying conditions get worse. that, I'm disposable. workers America. make okay. 5 million people died receving vaccine, vaccine causes death really amazing think everything take granted day day basis. Something small smiling passing stranger. we’ve endured, want one shot miraculously work never one again. 

Do get flu vaccine regularly? simply stubborn? can’t beat virus beat ourselves, think greater good (also it’s likely employer require anyways). fair...to fair...14 days. also wasn’t simply time. distance, too. virus, instances, traveled farther six feet—especially small, poorly ventilated areas. masks, duration contact, seemed matter lot. confirm it’s started since I’m it. Well, reached deep anal cavity grabbed whatever could. danger  majority pandemic actually need masks. COVID spread happening anti-maskers, virus spreads uncontrollably tracked (in USA's case countries like UK). 

It might surprise Sydney, Australia's populous city, mask restrictions come play weeks ago due outbreak. Majority year 2020, minus lockdown March, us wearing masks, life pretty normal lately.


The reason needed masks EVERY single COVID case tracked EVERY single contact tracked, notified told self-isolate. 


When things become untrackable that's see states fully lock down, e.g. Melbourne/Victoria huge lockdown. lock downs work. latest minor outbreak WA isuse whole state locked down, see 0 community transfer every case tracked.


Masks like final extra barrier sure help things, critical factor here.


In America's case far gone, masks 100% save lives. probably become endemic likely another cold virus. You’ll get covid 19 one day, make sure day isn’t year lol, help it. don’t enough vaccine send countries yet. lucky get everyone vaccinated second dose end year. need juice !!! article actually makes opposite claim, it’s saying, NFL create reliable picture transmission patterns able stop outbreaks problems TN. earth come “8x high chance”? right. difficult even forum convince people rapid vaccination important *who* vaccinated, specific procedures followed, people get 2nd shots, elderly get mRNA (the official position Germany today), etc.

Some states terribly anti-scientific recently among best vaccination (e.g. South Dakota Texas), others science-based relatively inefficient (e.g. California). People sensitive right days accept they've made mistakes. Honestly getting next couple days afterward, least second dose. second yesterday (pfizer version) feel like hit truck. Fever, aches over, exhaustion, intermittent shivering. First one arm sore day two after. mean 1.35 billion... id like see per capita stat They're going get scammed Jade jewelry stores. wouldn’t get information TikTok entire point generate emotional reaction keep watching Probably one alive right ever see world without sarscov2.

This mean cannot control pandemic medium term.

But virus far finished. widespread many variants. That’s Israel said forests.  Let's hope stays way Dr Doom wrong variants! Please send US. Stupid a-hole trump didn’t order enough December. massive vaccination sites set country. thousands thousands places go....but VACCINE! biggest f***-ups ever. could million deaths time over. ever is..... fear mongering. dont listen media anymore That’s going happen, like I’m sorry people posting individual instances reinfection making statements like “clearly protection getting again” insanely reminiscent early summer 2020 people literally said covid immunity general testimonials reinfection.

I think new variants present something issue, it’s really like thorn side anything. He's OLD per say (49), many underlying health conditions. could easily die due things.  Pretty Fly Rabbi Nice 5% workers actually work corporate. rest work franchises, including me.(they 5 stores). step right direction. fair 🧐 Lol....the dummy visit continues. museum, next Wuhan Yum Cha dinner? 
Fuck idiot. really hope Dr Doom wrong variants cause another wave! like believe wrong way hell want another year crap!🤦‍♂️ works. What's issue? marathon sprint. Everyone end less position couple years. quickly get there. Deaths still start happen countries get vaccine &amp; relax restrictions free lot later U.K. think correct decision came Oxford. However Oxford UK state funded body, money research came government. know Oxford counts formally state body, laws regarding foundation relationship state date back middle ages therefore quite irregular!

The UK government could attached tight restrictions intellectual property rights along money. Biden’s 37 executive orders first week? Bogus well, seem politically good nothing well. Trumps executive orders “ Bogus nothing” would Biden need reverse them? words Biden acting like Trump worse? Hahaha! Exactly. One friends sent “vaccine causes reactions!” article point 28 reactions *out 1.9 million injections.* Sorry, it’s worth risk. 

But scary media gotta scare. ... want virus live prosper, yes, it’s acceptable thinking. I'm Texas trying register vaccine three weeks now. ever see ""registration full"" , ""not accepting new registrations"". Totally pissed heart surgery December. Meanwhile Germany... crickets. Uh huh   eligibility requirements right UK vaccine? wasn’t obvious Christmas surge I’m seriously loss super bowl would whatever “Reinfection remains extremely unlikely”

It does? source that?

Sincerely asking depends are. Rural Idaho? Yeah, masks sight. Lincoln County, OR? Plenty masks precautions, also rural area. We'll fine. variants ""whole new pandemic"" vaccines still effective them. say nothing fact we're running upwards 1.5 million shots per day. man's death tragedy heart aches loved ones trepidation genre reporting sure instill anyone fence receiving vaccine kill way people vaccine itself. could right,better find proof...or alternative. Send LongHaulers thread. I've home almost year, seeing one friend parents time, definitely go past year without seeing girlfriend another country, I'm damn near suicidal, there's end sight, millions people even worse lockdowns. that's small sacrifice right? We're 7.6% individuals received least one shot. also bit players union + commish's interpretation shortening season paychecks. Players want full guaranteed pay, matter number games -- want commish enough power cut paychecks. Remember voting booth. Remember cause this. never voted liberal 39 years. speeds delivery date doses. One major rate limiting steps filling vials. grandparents (grandma pulmonary fibrosis) getting first dose 12th. I'm extremely excited able quick masked visit them.  share anecdotal evidence. Anyone symptoms random tested took screener beforehand sent home   FYI long run, risk fat unhealthy dramatically outweighs risk contracting covid. go gym. Oh bless little hear. think I’m commenting geography. context, WA's previous community transmission April 11th.

This case community (quarantine security worker) confirmed UK variant, found around period Perth arts festival, public holiday (Australia day), w/ nightclubs open since June.

For many first time wearing mask, since order come last night, rare see even cars two occupants donning one each. Masks policed, although via ""knucklehead rule"" ""policing consent"", officers trying hand masks need them. Friday essential workers work-from-home, see happens based many cases find interim.

So far zero, here's hoping stays way, although I'm holding breath. don’t get flu vaccine either fine. People scared get vaccine protect themselves. I’m child telling “get *damn* vaccine” makes want take less. can’t convince reason try force. Good luck. Right, I'm going rely official statistics anecdote. idea much transmission happens schools. 

Speak yourself.

 Cherry-picking data science. Nice strawman though. data doesn’t seem clear prevalence serious long covid either. It’s pretty unexplored territory ""when"" would help ease Ms von der Leyen gave timetable projected volume delivery vaccine doses AZ plants Oxford Keele UK government ruled allowing supplies factories rerouted Europe planned completion vaccination Britain’s adult population Mr Johnson’s spokesman said today: “It early talk surplus doses. priority remains vaccinate UK adults. priority remains get top four priority groups middle February remaining phase one list end spring.” know it'll today time week seems like good bet. Singapore's education minister pandemics? That's virus affects nervous system. doubt get effect vaccine. think varies state state healthcare workers get first priority (hospital employees, pharmacies, doctor's offices, on) Also stressful time working field, bet. Fully surely aware scientific perspective what's going on, possibly even upset political hindrances made worse, etc. report consider epidemiology COVID-19 relation new variants SARS-CoV-2, robust evidence potential impact school settings yet available, one recently observed United Kingdom. Try leaving country see happens :P

Good luck stuck island foreseeable future! People breaking, fight disease, trying keep lid mental breakdowns societal level 

this joke right Unfortunately, certain group people think sitting home computer, actually working lazy entitled. 

These people allow school district invest technology improves learning home, especially since see ""temporary"" measure, considered alternative measure forever. schools wanna incest technology pretty much anyone management ever sees expense rather investment. few, worst Americans don’t trust medicine doesn’t cost 10x AZ charging, told adverts ‘ask doctor’ getting expensive thing often. think US media primed promote Moderna Pfizer hard. understand parents need consistency kids need structure, 4 them. don’t think Chicagoans understand forcing everyone back together doesn’t necessarily solve issue. 

For example, district near shut week didn’t enough staff members week holding breath trying see child quarantined, teachers subs working. Sometimes classes get pushed together one person supervise. isn’t really great solution, imagine worse teachers pissed there.

You’re thread arguing someone think incoherent something don’t think matters. fall 2020 originally, long journey. weird jump back wedding planning hold 10 months 😂

Congrats good luck us! know teachers job duties ""just teach""? Go Zoom try teach world history lesson planning whatsoever, I'd like see that.

Surely know least one teacher, ask day. Actually, don't, dismiss ""that's real work""

And job 100% productivity. I'm like... 1-2 hours honest God real work per day.

Just stand physically bust ass 8+ hours day throwing boxes belt pulling/terminating telecom cabling, mean job ""legit"" ""real work"" whatever bs wanna project due insecurities. avoided nearly everything like almost year order avoid getting spreading virus, please forgive preferring get vaccines effective preventing getting spreading virus contagious outrageous crazy fact is, many people internet reading this, chances likely one could end dying horrible highly unlikely death.  Ok, and? That's still herd immunity. COVID flu, can't spreading thru population flu does. can't believe dumb COVID/Flu take still going year thing.  Secondary infection families coming school children indeed interesting. far remember, even height pandemic earlier last year, children unliekly index patients families. sure concluded though. People can't even figure spell basic words correctly - they're gonna able grasp vaccine effectiveness means, unfortunately. done quarantine financially support at-risk let rest society go various safety measures distancing mask wearing.

Instead healthy people got roped bullshit expected make sacrifices people generally don’t care health first place. virus real reaction isn’t.

Meanwhile there's like 4,000 pharmacies Los Angeles, bunch single location, locally owned, makes difficult city, itself, manage, pharmacies give vaccines people, too, makes difficult them.  That's big cities need mega sites.

There's also efficiency it. set mega site Chicago get 6,000 people day vaccinated. There's even 6,000 vaccines day allotted small towns. did, they'd set mega site break 3 days whole town vaccinated, huge waste time when, amount effort vaccinate 100 times many people big city. couldn’t agree this, nationwide (proper half!) lockdown come effect March/ April time, really believe would dealing level problem post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Probably hell efficiency keep air warm/cool that, would decrease indoor air viral density significantly. Cases -------2 hospitalizations 

Hospitalizations -------3 deaths


Unfortunately large number sick people fighting while, many ultimately make it. combined high, albeit declining, number new cases streaming means deaths may decline quickly rose. suspect places may substantial backlog bodies awaiting death certificates top (similar NE spring). hold onto hats folks. masks. Betacoronaviruses recombine. See example recent article twitter speculation among epidemiologists Racaniello mentioned TWiV, UK variant may arose recombination case like OP article rather long-illness-theory. Tried track one unfortunately guess correct twitter search turn up.

If J&amp;J approved Feb, govts deal situation lot ppl wanting J&amp;J willing wait longer. evidence double masking works helps point live life. can;'t live fear pathogens  Meanwhile Trudeau Canada still thumb ass. is, 'I wanna go clubbing' strawman. No, wanna fucking work, family wants work, friend small business wants work fear another lockdown. Surely teachers would vaccinated next school year. nonsense! Medical closest face, lesser mask farther away negotiating prices down

That massive price difference - around $2 per dose. Weeks delay $4 per person. getting upvotes? And? get flu shot encounter someone flu, don’t immediately get tested 'caring human life' line routinely abused here, insane. Policy 'cares human life' would multi-faceted one includes **all diseases**, mental health, socioeconomic impacts life expectancy, child welfare. Myopic agenda-driven ones like COVID lockdown initiatives give less shit 'human life', especially extended **almost year** lives without end.  That’s bad :( aunt eastern Washington doctor called come, let bring 87 year old neighbor one too. Small towns.... Eligible? What’s criteria it? absolutely big bump.

Throughout whole crisis EU shown useless is. Expect US right thing... tried everything else. 

The US country always stumbles across finish line bruised beaten alive ready tomorrow. crazy cost seemed important EU.

We're literally talking dollars difference per dose. Lets say maximum $10 difference 2 doses. $10 even worth single day delay? Probably - could mean back work day earlier. single day behind now, weeks.  1.4/2 million take efficacy account Go mcdies! Switzerland, thankfully got vaccines. won’t it’s required law, it’s naive think we’ll get way. think variants make everything worse last spring even vaccines. don’t really get it.

I'll say countries seem little better planning sorts things countries - total mess here. hand, everyone kids family extended family least 1 shot arm already. mix-ups confusion distribution probably put US behind 8 working days probably could gone smoothly. actually think would way around. Since data shows j&amp;j equivalent Pfizer Moderna preventing hospitalizations deaths, imagine we'd want use mRNA vaccines people likely spread it, like front line workers (though I'd probably put nursing home residents well). would effective death/hospitalization basis among vaccinated bringing R0 faster, helping received vaccine yet. company understands workers underpaid cannot afford miss work vaccinate pandemic killed hundreds thousands.... meant australia That’s simply true. Hungary thing example dropping EU scheme deciding purchase vaccines Russia. bad call opinion proof member stares want. Norway isn’t even EU opted scheme.

""very small number""? latest figures I've read put number around 30%, including people presented mild cases initially.  I'm waiting read possibility treating horrible diseases like MS ALS. Let's go stigmatizing everyone sees friend narcissist, though. People really struggling depression, anxiety, substance abuse, sucidial ideation. Socialization real human need productive shame people wanting so.

Some messaging public health authorities unhelpful. We've known, example, outdoor socializing relatively safe, yet still guidance stay home see anyone outside household. people live alone, supposed see anyone year plus?

Now we're seeing demands continue isolation post-vaccine. Indefinitely demanding people stay isolated without concern mental health lead people stopping listening public health advice. saw data Israel today hospital admissions amongst vaccinated slashed , vaccinated people *have* died (but mortality seems dramatically reduced). guess need wait months sure places, sick time used medical care. unusual. absolutely refuted said. Long-term damage may tied severity. mean we're coming full year lockdowns restrictions I'm sure shocking anyone Couple folks work almost excited fact believe COVID keep going, every winter going stay-at-home season, anyone leaves house reasons besides getting groceries lunatic...

Precisely. understand folks cavalier this. Maybe they're position able take several weeks months work suffer financial hardship? last case April last year, last lockdown.

We lose 160 roads. rates US hard affected states, 2k/mil, we'd lost 5000 people disease already. Instead, we've lost 9.

Additionally, fewer thousand people made gamble long term outcomes. world made gamble Australian variant, impacting vaccines immunity, we're harbouring virus here.

But enough data show vaccine equally high efficacy 65s. Historically anti-vaccine sentiment tends grow pandemics, resurge disease largely defeated (""Why need measles vaccine? one gets measles anymore."") 

We'll likely continue see anti-vaccine sentiment high levels next year resurgence years people say ""there major covid outbreak since 2022, need this?"" 

I think effective thing set reasonable requirements things like use planes, certain jobs healthcare workers, caregivers, companies set requirements return work person. 

Persuasion role, think phase people still hesitant, ""gone rabbit hole"" yet. That's part think government-level vaccine confidence project. wait people convinced vaccinate, much harder change minds. J&amp;J broke data region, necessarily variant - large-scale sequencing [just done (to detriment). 

The US Brazil variant, South Africa variant, UK variant, several others including homespun variants (Columbus, etc). emerge overnight likely spreading time. course, degree we're seeing e.g. South Africa - [where ~90% cases sequenced contain new RBD - enough still really talking apples-to-apples comparison.

The crucial point here, though, though J&amp;J deal dozen variants real world Pfizer/Moderna - currently *everyone* deal new variants, know looks like J&amp;J (and lesser extent, NovaVax). 

**Every** vaccine likely take efficacy dent - real data new variants one two companies far. J&amp;J's data *suggest* may matter, hopefully vaccines enough keep people safe, healthy, hospital (let alone morgue). Despite thrashing they've gotten online, largely good news.  Yup. I've said literally reason still seeing high compliance restrictions due fact everyone access vaccines point. vaccines available anyone 16+ people month two get shot(s), one going care government official expert say.

Fortunately, think Biden team know hence 100 day ""mask challenge."" get May/June time frame, public willingness comply plummet dramatically along cases, deaths, hospitalizations, etc. Despite experts' breathless insistence must, never eradicate disease anyone's life time that's alive right now. far transmissible well-established population point.

It makes harder fight misinformation clear things like toxic death rates, mortality, hospitalizations, percent serious adverse events. 

The vaccines published data really good job killing people putting hospital. Even new variants also going great job keeping people alive hospital.

Herd immunity COVID requires vaccinating 70%-80% population (depending replication number). entire Palestinian population (from WB/Gaza) interacts Israeli population 0.77% Israel's population, completely irrelevant herd immunity — bearing Israel's ability vaccinate 70%-80% population, even add 70k total population count. Even every single one 70k keeps bringing virus Israel (which easily controllable means, COVID tests), virus nowhere spread quickly die out, 80% host population immune. herd immunity means. statement Israel needs vaccinate Palestinian population order achieve herd immunity. completely false, obvious way. Injections much less painful years ago. must improved tip needle. also forgetting reduces chances getting Covid around 70%. Lebanon's economy already well truly free fall pandemic.

Why care much comment *technically* correct? think attacking?

I didn’t know whether laugh, cry, throw up, three simultaneously.

I respond that’s case, I’m headed bridge (both thought masked two years, catastrophic implications would performing arts academic careers). end day, public health officials' fault suggesting lockdown, government's fault improperly implementing weakly enforcing lockdown rules.

It public health official's fault suggesting something that, based psychology, laws human behavior realistically enforced followed vast majority population.

What guidance her? Nope. someone important especially moment like right now, get heart attack, pulling something like that. I'm conspiracy theorist feels off. Im probably crazy ask guess. Yes, that's exactly means. That's younger people likely get side effects - powerful (and effective) immune response.

Some people trials (who medical workers) pissed got second dose side effects - knew got placebo protected. Osterholm predicted 5 last 3 pandemics “ fit trim seen non-human”

Honestly, risk hospitals overwhelmed, really think that's go back normal. That's restrictions always about. ""certain"" numbers dropping areas high level vaccinations, numbers coming Israel good way ahead expectations. Early studies show vaccines least partially fully effective new variants strains, vaccines 100% even 70% effective major positive impact.

Aside this, new treatments discovered constantly decrease many cases become serious.

All data pointing direction think we'll see another surge vaccinated areas. purely *allergic* adverse events trying avoid, consider reading preliminary data Moderna Pfizer regarding anaphylaxis. personally seen data J&amp;J allergic rate, Moderna Pfizer rates low question J&amp;J administered enough doses clear statistically significant rate allergic reactions emerge.

Moderna: effectiveness one shot mRNA vaccine effectiveness J+J vaccine? feel like could get one shot mRNA shot number shots reason.  


Btw, J+J trial two dose shots right FWTW don’t seem realize skeptical policy skeptical disease. actually think solid chunk Americans fall category. amount people group growing rapidly continue vaccines rolled vulnerable protected.

We've become numb BS, that's what's scary. somehow manage out-BS come next level garbage spat daily basis. 

The simple fact making money this; selling medication 10 times price stating ""sanctions"", renting hospital rooms, PCR test costing half minimum wage, fines breaking curfew (they've made billions alone), people losing jobs left right unemployement benefits, food getting expensive restaurants adding BONES menus, suicides going up, funerals expensive, even buying grave... 

So, making shitton money lot people dying guess that's also bonus them, waste bullets missles. lol 

I laugh, I'm losing tbh. confused. It’s late early? know vast majority schools offer person education community spread isn’t fundamentally better worse districts right? 

You also understand schools social safety net children, right? would say main thing apply social pressure shame people vaccinated seeing friends, going restaurants gyms open, travelling, etc. Bro even get point human 😂😂😂 get turn. vaccine manufacturers planning producing billions doses.

By saying isn’t true, you’re intentionally misleading people. Yeah. definitely don’t know damage seen actually long term, short term thing. But, I’m definitely hopeful vaccine would help prevent effects.  yeah, i'd agree that. going start flying cities crop dusting us vaccines may want wait days exposure. needs time gestate.

Stop spreading misinformation, stop intentionally aggravating others. Why? testing still free available area. understand need rush test possible expose. isn’t valid argument whole pandemic over, we're going need rethink entire pandemic response strategy.

There really exit strategy formed disagreement 2 months half country vaccinated. enough ""anti-science"" problems already society, like particular debate falling exclusively heads people devoted lives biology, epidemiology, virology etc.

Viruses affect humans exist vacuum, exist human societies. 

A science-based health policy regarding AIDS could *""don't unprotected sex following 50 years AIDS eradicated""*. that's stupid since ignores human needs, wants, behaviors. 

My point science-based solutions work, point science-based solutions work consider society going apply them.

Humans mindless drones (in countries anyway) health experts considered psychology, behavioral traits, compliance, Government enforcement, geography, laws, etc... Stop. Common sense allowed. Moderna hasn’t taken scummy profiteering approach Pfizer has. Pfizer sent vials going go us elsewhere. Moderna won’t, instead they’ll charge government past 100M “doses”. precaution tested protection infection / transmission, yet anyway. know mom vaccinated seeing one another again, husband definitely going restaurants again. mind wearing mask protect unvaxxed people, definitely going back world get vaxed, unless news comes bad variant.

back that, simply flattening curve month two, time could used discover treatments might help, could learn virus, could infer true IFR instead over-inflated CFR.

now, seems like people essentially expecting covid cases non-existant day things go back normal. i'm betting lot people never go back normal.  seems unlikely. Tons people currently party friends pay up, confidence attend party. There's force country could possibly stop throwing get togethers privacy homes, least opportunity get tested easily.

There quite reasons think of, hand. Every fill machine settable range full volume. intended one filling size could fine control, get close exact amount without giving much extra. guess they're using type filler, throughput analysis determined could move doses increasing fill volume. However, knowing machines operate, could needed upgrade filling pumps enable new volumes, took time manufacture, deliver, test, qualify (especially trying churn much possible). 

There also could stream reasons inspection, even issue splashing foaming (if filling volume vial rate) needed solved.  beyond frustrated. read article covid vaccine testing toddlers months away. next months still start 12 year olds. moths 9, 6 3. guess wont back business 2022. 


Is new info transmitting covid received vaccine. prefer infected all. Consequently, absolutely interested either AstraZeneca J&amp;J Novavax.

You want cut chances ever obtaining virus 2/3 giving 100% less chance major symptoms? seems like poor choice logic me. main problem experts guess, studies well made, tracing data collected least made public. Therefore, one can't conclude risk is.

Example: say 1 2000 risk get infected surface low. not: found contamination every 12th surface. Let's say touch 10 public surfaces average per day. Depending sampling method, could well touch much, much surface area that. even 10 times sampling area touched per day, infection risk per year would 15%. surfaces could explain nearly cases.

The main factor driving pandemic people lie symptoms, second that, one knows importance transmission routes. would easy collect data, one properly, unfortunately. we'll guess way around small-scale studies anecdotal media reports years come.

According clinic, still confirmed inflammation developed side effect vaccination. “  people beginning pandemic got little self righteous takeout open ""learn cook"". suspect they've caved now. 

(In seriousness, lot people live hotels housing situation conducive cooking.) Another way saying young people getting covid means chances getting goes 80%. immunize way vaccine does, think, trigger level antibodies. actually causation brought back vaccines according Norway health dept. Probably best spread that.

&amp;#x200B;

"" January 19, Norwegian Institute Public Health released statement saying link established Pfizer/BioNTech's vaccine post-vaccination deaths country. World Health Organisation (WHO) echoed sentiment statement January 22, saying saw evidence vaccine contributed deaths. "" It’s insane whole year increase supply something simple vials that’s still limiting factor. surprising. Young people stronger innate immune responses generate less humoral (memory) responses. innate immune system sufficient shred virus, get ill, generate much memory B cell responses.

This means young adults children going need vaccination order produce herd immunity. matter get ill, need vaccination order stop spread (and one reason pfizer, moderna presumably rest pediatric studies vaccines). look big comment, kinda middle links relevant vaccines working variants.

So far good news. can't blame her. think people getting tired living like matter age. ask people put lives hold long say im done masks social distancing health experts shut up. made big mistake authorize medical workers 1st. huge medical presence, also includes ton medical research. result, lot non-frontline workers included phase 1, including researchers administrative employees contact patients. Since huge industry MA, made bulk vaccinations initial shipments, along nursing homes. Add slow start vaccinations happening.

Pretty much another lesson ""don't trust private companies right thing"". vaccinated bunch people knew high risk rules vaguely written. Exactly. thing I'm favor torturing healthcare workers. we're point preventing mass hospitalization, I'm going back living normal life summer, friends family. care makes people mad not. Plus, stopped testing asymptomatic mild symptomatics, sudden numbers would staggeringly drop 95% could get back lives. around pretreatment. Taking afterwards thought fine.

(Which note even consistent headline) anything government press jackboot tighter citizens' necks. Human rights, due process individual freedom damned, let's throw anyone found outside lockdown gulag. 26.2 million confirmed US Covid cases 31.8 million vaccine doses given far. think there's always chance additional waves point many people left high chance getting already either gotten Covid vaccinated. imagine downward trend continue trending mean yet probably biggest danger face point people relaxing much soon trendline favor. recently looked coworker exposed nearest testing site free 50 minute drive takes 5-7 days get results. He's pay $70 get 3 day result area. History longer five years. take back said censorship ending soon. Maybe give 3 weeks ;) Coming guy getting downvoted. Great analysis! Thank taking time write up. agree great deal difficulty disentangling effects. There's much potential unobserved effects working alongside formal interventions purport test. do, fairness, recognize (""Second, *Rt* may reduced unobserved NPIs voluntary behavior changes mask-wearing""), scientific papers, acknowledging limit stop people drawing strong conclusions. (I know one European country study already used evidence stop roll-out stringent stay-at-home orders, instance.) cleaning didn’t get sick.

Believing surface transmission absolutely got sick. lol Vaccines always hit hard, got boosters first kid sick almost 2 weeks. people stop rewarding articles clicks views  Sure, that’s said anyone get shot want thinks going back, regardless media organization says.  follow rule

Of course true, whole point hygiene theater used many, many people way feeling like control.

Gotta ramp fear machine Someone want take Covid-19 vaccine automatically labeled ""anti-vaxxer"" ??! Get grip! everyone wants take particular vaccine okay others know...🙄 used social media besides reddit would 100% linking/reposting everywhere. everyone interact already looking forward vaccine already first dose, great resource. mom ask doctor provides cancer treatment. sure anyone else could give accurate answer. get antibody tests shots, case asymptomatic?

I guess mention either remission cancer immune system compromised. “How many people kill one exhale? IMHE modeled numbers, terrifying.” Yeah, see ends - overrun hospitals businesses longer get amount customers due health/safety economic reasons lack tourists abroad.  


You need healthy population healthy economy, otherwise work longterm. answer simply open up, really governments supporting businesses hopefully innovating like mad. wars times chaos arise lot innovation COVID another one certain businesses even prosper business usual times. Ok hand washing still helps. College football games truly massive gathering want attend, (maybe concert race every while). mind, way full stadiums (or least seats available, possible able fill people still wary) unless something completely unexpected happens then. 99% confident happen starting September.

If take 20% confidence month backwards September, feel right. Ex; May, I'm 19% confident full capacity sold concerts back. 0% confident April. Masks constant reminder fucked last year us. we've reached acceptable level herd immunity everyone access vaccine world's biggest party burning damn things. represent everything I've lost last year, fuck masks. guess push need get blockchain-enabled IDs, would easy way unimpeachable proof licensed provider claiming vaccinated someone. likely good evidence get. die washed hands died cause follow rules. 

I've family members say hey ok go family events I'm wearing mask. tell stay home. 

If got sick mandatory mask order stay home.  Great. make cost $0. Oh no...anyway... antihistamines? month old. two questions then. 1. include newer strains Covid, ones UK, South Africa, Brazil? 2. effective vaccines preventing long term damage heart, kidneys, pancreas, etc? Saying I'll survive great I'm walking away diabetes, bad heart, and/or needing dialysis, would still consider Covid pretty serious problem. Get vaccine like flu get life. quote month ago.  drag kicking screaming normalcy.  What's wrong ya smh Exactly. really let much I'm lot less scared future mid December things still increasing. may already peaked deaths well likely peak next couple days see continual declines.  heck would that? Thats one disgusting things ive ever read. EU needs vaccine Q1 too. it’s happening. majority adult EU population could vaccinated end Q2 anyway current delivery schedule AZ, Pfizer Moderna (about 65%) much higher number reached J&amp;J approved delivered time. Excited upcoming normal summer. Moderna Pfizer vaccine actually 80-90% effective 12 days first dose. 2nd dose boosts efficacy makes last longer. Seeing people's faces important. helps us feel connected other. worry babies born last year seen anyone's face except parents. Face masks also terrible hard hearing, since muffles speech makes lip reading impossible. wear masks past point necessary. model try estimate ""true"" number dead (in sense, e.g. excess deaths) match reporting index. instance, Worldometer definitely underreporting deaths (if reason delayed) (less concretely) likely undercounting. still holding breath dad get his. risks associated treatment stressful (worth still stressful). 

Obviously ask doctors (more one!) also remember basic cancer safety measures. want keep lot things keep getting illnesses also remember vaccine doesnt guarantee 100% protected covid. god relief strong one! Good luck mom, rest family, treatment! No. still smell taste fine ""Less deadly"" mean ""doesn't affect you"" get coming from. think thing gonna hard date things better by, even ideal world. everybody wanted vaccine got one week might back normalcy months end. gonna take time things relax. far tell, summer 2021 optimistically things open safe, might spring 2022 later lives back spring 2020. hearing people say ""normal summer"" might mean it'll safe eat restaurants, others say ""not next spring"" might mean things fully normal again. know wanna get campus graduate lol. We’re seeing progress. Cases hospitalizations dropping. Vaccinations making great improvements. media public start reflect this?  friends, important understand still providing useful information there, look sensationalism fear mongering get it. tune get nothing live rock. MSM gotten bad people either chosen live rock believe lies. reckoning them, take time(and money). time reliable need return that. lose sense smell? original $600 unemployment check states people making unemployment jobs paid something significant government did. Savings increased radically last year average people done fairly well. economy boom late year over. Unfortunately many small businesses gone boom. California, Chicago New York opening up... weird timing... wonder is? caution around pretreatment also taking course following day.

If former, completely agree everything saying.  never remotely close 100% safety viruses risks. perfectly ""normal"" millions people die every year flu, tuberculosis, malaria, etc. manage risk vaccines treatments live lives.

Somehow virus made everyone obsess tiniest risk. risk dying people tiny begin with. going 90% less tiny. kind risk getting hit car diagnosed cancer. stop everything life risks? course not. never set aside hobby weeks? Heck I've working book since 2001 article updated today written awhile ago. Misleading. OC43 coronavirus emerged late 1800s still circulating day. herd immunity. covid19 foreseeable future, then? Wow, realize virus would magically go away like collectively decided ignore restrictions. strategy since day 1?! Probably... almost certainly. 

Buts since need wait 3 weeks booster. Might well check stats end 3 weeks. number commentaries refer Fauci's remarks stem early January. story appears update story month old. think old news thinks what's even crazier people make vials something couldnt coordinate people make syringes get last doses.

Agreed. hit point willing take minimal risk distanced outdoor gatherings mental health. true every virus history. walk bar know someone chicken pox measles vaccine. wear mask socially distance?

People become obsessed gone beyond logical reasonable. Insanity. new strain R around 1 decide released current measures somewhat. also medical professional giving medical advice, Memorial Sloan-Kettering's [advice might helpful you. We’ll get there. I'm making argument.

You ASS(U)ME'ing something exist. Wisconsin pharmasist destroyed 500 doses covid vaccine [is also flat surprised. restrictions need last hospitals cope patients. enough vaccine there, infection rates fall.  administration negotiating Congress speak. big problem accidentally dox people they're logged google accounts. Uh, say that? gonna quote me. sucks see Paragon effective coronavirus management go way, least 10+ months prepare infections EU need vaccine 2022. EU needs vaccine Q2. stop lockdown open economy. Q3 late. EU. Also fatalities concentrated 90%+ elderly population first list get vaccinated. month vaccinated, least ones take reached. reduces risk 90%.

/s It’s good thing hasn’t even eight weeks since first person vaccinated. don’t hold fear mongering too. day come dw. going thing future forever Con: 10+ million vaccinated days

Which downward trend likely continue. US seeing lowest 7 day average since mid November right 10 million vaccinated chance really kick yet hypothetically tomorrow next day also lower 7 day average. ""Someone want take vaccine literally end global pandemic antivaxxer?"".

Yes. are.  really.

Con: 10+ million vaccinated days

Every day gets better though Thanks! enough stop pandemic prevent long term effects. much better vaccines - Moderna, Biontech. Even Novavax Curevac. I’m hoping REALLY hard I’ll finally able country boyfriend again, guess we’ll see. ignore long covid organ damage, sure make headway 50+ start talking mass lifting restrictions. suspect vaccine deployment really hit stride (March/April) we'll able really push vaccination younger younger (lower) risk groups.

if 3 million day starting march, we'll give 180m shots end april. couple single shot vaccines, it'll really really good penetration spring. issue fake passports, fake driver's licenses. impossible fake, hard, severe enough penalties discourage people trying. taking bet - next! BioNTech Moderna vaccines.

By AstraZeneca (already approved), J&amp;J, CureVac, potentially NovaVax approved. much earlier. end summer basically worst-case scenario. NoVAvax, they're across line Maryland? 👍 mean, pretty clear reduced disease severity across board. deaths, fewer hospitilisations, fewer people symptoms. would surprising impact long-covid symptoms. Curvac excellent, Q3 earliest. Q2 overestimation. Still hope 

J&amp;J data looks bad. May I’m missing something? 70% efficacy way low. really look quite amazing. one effective vaccines history, maybe effective, appears safe. US flu vaccine 39% effective last year 29% that. vaccines 94%+ effective.

Also serious illnesses 15% population, elderly. Israel way past UK approaching US getting close. really think things lot different 4 weeks.  lol ok Gotcha. would love attend college football game fall well. Nothing quite like crammed stadium 100,000 rabid fans! Private planes dont operate guidelines commercial jets. vaccinated history infection mutually exclusive though I've got travel work (covid related, exempt bans) lot affordable housing options now, that's sure. AirBnB nothing ""Rare Find"" ""Reduced Price"" vaccines achievement least. 

I'm still recovering ""mild"" case COVID friends age months still lingering issues too. valid concern folks obsessed ""low"" death rates need looking at, long COVID take away benefits good safe vaccines. Yup - Pfizer one contains [Polyethylene (PEG) encase ""proprietary lipid technology"" houses mRNA.

PEGs used place link shows common component shelf medicines etc, tiny fraction population severe allergic reactions it.

The PEG thing bothers personally Pfizer vaccine though- given choice would go AstraZeneca/Oxford one purely using much tried tested chimpanzee adenovirus vector - one that's used vaccinating Ebola while. Whereas may fully understand large scale implications possible side effects ""proprietary lipid technology"" least couple years... Would trust Pfizer one ""proprietary"" crap! What? Why? Moderna vaccine made January 2020, took long time approve. would future vaccines different? wish best health! people staying inside households balance one pretty good 52% efficacy average first 25 days includes 12 days dose goes effect. effect, 90%. think people care latter former. broken clock right twice day. knew last year would time apocalyptic scenario media pushes come true? really hope That's basically time wear them. follow rules, wear masks little possible. I'm lucky job require them, even make sense wear job I'm alone 90% time. dont respect anymore. wish he'd shut realize everyone cushy job like worry paying bills feeding children recommend stuff stays closed. ILPT : Sew drugs face mask, can't make take examine it. Ridiculous service industry people far back vaccine list. profession customers allowed around without masks on?  specifically AZ. P/B, countries getting issue. Also kind ironic post that, UK exports nada, nothing, egomaniacs are. mean yes? expecting countries vaccinate foreign nationals citizens? Cool thanks would great.  think so. Without delivery Marburg? dont understand pharmasist anti-science time agree coordinated effort, personally going use judgment terms calculated risks.

I've pretty hardcore social distancing last year. However I'm vaccinated, metrics least good last summer, think would problem hanging people also vaccinated. Especially outside playing sport something  I'm sure location is, can't hurt give another shot. 3 weeks ago 20% population, 6 weeks ago started 1%.

They studies portion population vaccinated results 0.04% people caught virus week second dose 0.002% needed hospital treatment appreciate either way. trying get much info essential worker recently triple-exposed(tested negative, thankfully), particular reflects paycheck end day hire who? They're mostly CNAs make like 14-17hr. They're one underpaid worker  Since getting sick, changed tune? family members? lot disagreements family early took serious day 1 we're kinda boat now.

It also helps family 3000 miles away, unannounced unplanned drop-ins Seen many articles like lately. Love Got source? I've heard 50% first dose; 95% second. this! currently vaccinating chinese vaccine serbia. don’t want it, i’ll wait pfizer vaccine shipment arrives. I’m fortunate I’m confided home time actually wait vaccine want. i’m confident don’t trust chinese government. although grandma get chinese vaccine, supposed getting second dose soon. Thats line stood too, hopefully healthcare facilities less stress, awareness, increased supply, easier get at-risk patients antibodies soon test postive. reddit tell sucks right tell bezos behind barring production error something else unaccounted for, 60 million seems almost certain. get quick j&amp;j approval count could much higher. knowledge, EU problems come insufficient supply.
There rumours swirling AstraZeneca preferentially devoting stockpiles UK use deprioritizing EU orders. would explain UK suddenly performing ""so well"" previously logistics planning utterly miserable. say someone UK.
Seeing AstraZeneca British headquartered company, there's definitely need investigated possibility. expect rate decline reduce approach baseline. think baseline lower last one think we're getting towards critical mass people getting it. Still really close true herd immunity stands though... That's going July probably vaccination  like making bread... there's secret recipe, know easy make. Making pharmaceutical product hard complicated. takes lot tweaking failures, till get yields up. took literal months UK scale production AZ. EU signed deal 3 months later UK, that's 3 months less time improve vaccine yields plants. 

It'll take months open want new plant efficient UK one is. dad's service streamed can't attend. funeral homes caught current environment. Yup. Sucks places power peer pressure quite something. Even impacts countries leaders. Barring anything crazy new variants, I'm betting March biggest beginning-to-end change month entire pandemic. serious? long schools follow guidelines necessarily Prevents severe disease, hospitalisations, deaths, 1 dose fridge temp storage - good enough People tend less interested discussion play amateur psychologist disagree you.

I go data takes me. tells things rapidly diminishing likely control soon. I’m open interpretations. I’m going change conclusions adjust expect people react Aged. Like. Milk. 

Another viewing I’m pretty optimistic vaccine rollout long term also ton people already gotten Covid US I’m sure that’ll impact spread coming holiday stretch.  I’m hearing everyone talking cases dropping almost synonymous idea continue drop vaccine rollout.  national spike baseline plateau higher timeline seems mean even vaccinated today optimally protected while. I’m hopeful also know Covid slippery.  Building spiking. Sounds like first night tried everclear Ah yes type record breaking love see. ""Ironically"".

Somehow think idiot pm planned garbage directly sabotaged whole op.

Not tinfoil hat anything im frustrated everyone else, im little skeptical economic decisions seemed like made aggravated toddler


Open, close, open, close. Open slightly. Close little bit. Open limited time.

🤔 Nah. Likely, foregone conclusion. Stay separate rooms don’t interact nothing Brexit. 30 countries vaccinated, 20 EU. 

The EU fine well, hopefully everyone else world too. summer pretty bad sun belt. made feel glimmer optimism heart, long feeling sadness mess we're in. Thank you! Far people die limit vaccines 95% one rather deploy ones effective virus.

Preventing hospitalisation really important part here. obsessing prevention virus reducing effects virus basically normal cold making perfect enemy good. Hm. Frustrating. agree need continue take precautions whilest vaccines distributed. immunized isn’t license go back normal overall numbers go down. 

That said, think it’s completely reasonable vaccinated person travel see family, observing mask distancing guidelines en route. 

This shouldn’t nothing; locked not. Unfortunately, Fauci tough position needing deliver simple message reflects best course population large. J&amp;J's efficacy much worse though - 66% vs. 95% Pfizer. IHME model recently updated include variants, predictions much worse week ago. However, dire ones article. 

One thing really understand think worst case would people get vaccinated started moving around pre-pandemic levels. Maybe misprint mean non-vaccinated individuals? 

One thing clear model though, everyone would mask up, could save tens thousands lives. simple ask, people either selfish stupid comply. rural texans drive hundreds miles go Walmart. ordinary many them. hour drive far places west texas.  Pretty much spot on, looks like 100k 30 vaccinated countries, 20 EU. 

They fine.  too. 

I keep thinking - stop making brexit sound like *good* side. 

This mistake could go way dismantling eu inside out. believe highly likely schools largely back normal next fall  Without J&amp;J available yet probably happen. March different story mean what's going happen rich countries get everyone vaccinated... give vaccines countries ordered Let guess - it’s one shot? /s sample size fine looking high probability things like past Covid infections. seroprevalence 25% vs true 27%, doesn’t change conclusion much. 

The bigger question tested population representative entire country, didn’t bias towards richer poorer participants. Difficult say without going raw data. Western reports meta studies without randomizing subject. shame. First doses vs *confirmed* positive cases.*

The true number cases likely several multiples official tally. yet cases still plummeting. strains likely while. worry this? Osterholm also thought would need half billion vaccines Ebola. Professionally he’s known Dr. Doom. You’re talking known pessimist true, stopped two cities one day, resumed day after. PA too. It’s worst snow storm we’ve East Coast 5 years. Don’t surprised slows vaccination campaign full week. can't rest EU countries copy formula vaccine start producing lab/production sites? pay vaccine company licensing fee something? like copy paste..what missing? Hell can't every country this? That's courts for. International trade well regulated, AZ found breach contract, EU every right seize shipments border. Nobody's ""pricing"" anybody out, contracts already signed paid for. UK paid AZ break terms contract, they'll pay manufacturing plants outside EU also.

I fail see feelings regarding ""hostility"" (which an... interesting way call absolute trainwreck brexit) relevant matter. That’s French company—right? Novavax 96% effective old strain, 60% South African strain.

It remains seen mRNA vaccines fare. think things J&amp;J might good healthy young people like me, Modera/Pfizer people much risk.

We'll see whether J&amp;J want go back trials go FDA. right now. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

But yeah, plenty parents afraid peak window, much less interact another human.  odds vaccines helping? source sequencing 50%? Would love read 0.1% IFR likely even younger country like India. “just flu” sounds like universal part disinformation campaigns, although poorer countries didn’t stand much chance stopping highly infectious diseases like Covid struggle much preventable issues.  Even without Covid, MLB needs cut month ends season go back scheduled Sunday doubleheaders. (And real doubleheaders noon/evening game day stuff) plant produce 750m doses year. I'll leave conclusions you, particularly difficult. else would implement border controls? think couple differences WV important. federal partnership CVs Walgreens. used age sole criteria, took high risk-high reward strategy much keep reserve. 

I'll push back couple things said. think supply remains major barrier. remember dosages get broken smaller sets reserves which, think, increases need reserves. 

What states realize, got slowed many health professionals would decline vaccine. think that's something corrected. also reason delay WV get hit bc started wider range eligibility. 

Anyhoo. Glad chat it. think downvotes warranted convo Yes. kids willing fight still well classes online. already told this. Opening schools isn’t going magically save people don’t shit Personally? No. Make 12 steelers win SB Wow, everything listed exactly needed do! clever : ) EU population pissed commission. done goofed bigly  issues stems system outside covid. Sending kids eat shitty food isn’t going fix that. USA 4.6x infections vs confirmed cases. Initially Spring closer 10x approximately 3x. European countries similar detection rate. exactly “science” article about? It’s soft news profile one guy severe yet rare symptoms. think over-thinking little bit much. personal opinion US amazing. Trump's Operation Warp Speed put vaccine procurement Canada, EU, Japan etc shame. UK currently another level zero doubt US wont pushing 3 million day coming months weeks. little precise, left dedicated second dose.

Important context UK delayed second dose (probably correct decision) American production capacity pretty much everything world class.

We're moving 'please act responsible' socially conscious phase 'ruthless capitalist productivity contractors' phase. Seems USA UK better latter former (go figure). course important keep former really want beat thing.  not. even literally says box prevent getting covid. keep up? point Covid another Influenza/Flu virus  ... true.

Hoarding means amassing large quantities something need storing it.

None countries keeping surplus stock vaccines. They're using vaccines get hands on.

Also, China rich country. Sure bud.


Here's data:


Here's data:


Good argument. highest bidder - earliest bidder. 3 months long time contract signed start readying production.

Are reading contract did? AZ contract published EU clearly stated ""best effort"". read contract? EU delayed ages signing negotiating prices floor despite cost, making profit. said best efforts would made there’s time period scale manufacturing, something took time also AZ’s manufacturing sites, work started earlier orders placed 3 months before, course there’s bit catch-up EU dragging feet. regards finding, US UK major contributors EU much less focused funding french vaccine didn’t come off.

Of course matter vaccines it’s awful quibbling coz priority get everyone vaccinated think EU made major screw gas lighting everyone failings

Also, proof AZ shipping Vaccines EU elsewhere? mean start 6 14 weeks? next 6-14 weeks going bad? Yeah, Right-Wing Christians supposed certain set Laws 1st Century Rabbi follow either. hope too. Easter birthday would love vaccine gift. people demanding May re-opening, knew public health cranks would try keep things locked years given half chance, right! actually surprised India 25% positivity, although test poorer accuracy people recently infected infected long time ago. many friends relatives back home Covid. 

It impossible get good estimate Covid-related deaths India. would surprised see IFR 0.3% people don’t ready access oxygen Dex. Somewhere around 1M deaths. 

Downvotes hell me... hilarious. Start people say ""America well better"" guess? Holy shit. [Event recommendation [Countries, international organizations, global transportation companies work together maintain travel trade severe pandemics. Travel trade essential global economy well national even local economies, maintained even face stated, evidence course contrary. Nations Vietnam, New Zealand, Australia shut international travel faired far better not. mean start 6 14 weeks? next 6-14 weeks going bad? sound quite frustrated. angry people Germany blame falling? Well looks like secured vaccines ummmm March. Well done. America, early Fall ridiculous. Novavax alone producing 100 million doses *per month* summer. young perfectly healthy want vaccine choice, perhaps wait til summer. America, society swimming vaccines June 1. Although, orthodox jews supposed law protect lives. no, apparently apply anymore. Nothing applies anymore - state laws even biblical laws. God damn universe! people aren’t watching pubs even normal years amazing I’m sad live I’ll waiting probably April might get chance lottery spot vaccination. 

Keep good work!  think compact much it. best states US W Virginia North Dakota. getting Johnson Johnson able produce many June? US’s vaccine distribution actually quite good, despite ratings driven media outlets saying. vaccinating 0.5% population every day, current increase 200,000 daily average doses administered every week, could vaccinating 1% population every day mid February. spread virus likely won’t stop late summer fall, since prioritizing high risk individuals, number daily deaths US likely drop dramatically next month two, likely able return work, schools, etc. masks next six months so, masks anymore! past months that. don’t tend think went 180 telling us need wear two masks Trump still prez he'd actively meddling distribution, ham fistedly trying profit it. underestimate power staying way others jobs. Yep. used live rural area driving 3-4 hours one way get somewhere kinda part sign for.  aren't. developing vaccine, worked effectively trials, unfortunate side effect giving false positives HIV test. difficult ethical decision made stop project. We'll also manufacturing Oxford vaccine locally licence countries.

Australia highly developed medical, pharmaceutical vaccine research capability, sell short personally ignorant it. They're specifically asking first doses though, Bloomberg's rolling average doses. Ok J&amp;J fully online (I realize till March maybe even April), many doses day guys think we'll able hit? would hope 2.5 million least. wanted 500 million vaccines west Africa. America. statement inaccurate? Novavax ton manufacturing sites working too. antigen, adjuvant, fill finish, they'll using sites Czech Republic, Spain, Germany, UK, Sweden, India, South Korea, Japan, several US sites Maryland, Michigan, Texas, North Carolina. catering people? need therapy pandering. COVID Vaccines also present arms least 50 states you’re saying lockdowns work?  students home internet? students take care siblings home?

It's binary thing willing willing. sliding scale barriers put kids going lose. saying authoritarian regimes bad track records respect human rights violations?

That's said. put words mouth ""giving up"" refusing learn examples countries way. said none that. yet still complaining use term ""strawmen."" Yeah, seem like really honest, serious interlocutor *great* use time. saying reality experience true.

I'm telling infact significant number people making effort. maybe willfully ignorant maybe literally idea. really relevant.

My point much normal see much larger number people describing actually wearing mask. extrapolating say reality everywhere. I'm sure isn't.

So it'd nice stop demeaning disrespecting making effort ""hurrr Durr Swedes spreading covid. Here's video evidence violating large number people surroundings privacy proof""

Clear? Alaska made dance lol first last time they’ll behave way RNA even find n95s? guess saying March largest perceived change public, valid. look hospitalizations dropping 3k day base \~100k can't imagine would even faster March.  Permanent organ damage long-term symptoms/weakness something shrugged ""something hypochondriacs"" want beer therefore decided medical opinions longer count, like moron. paying teachers enough work unvaccinated. teacher's life worth something like [10 million teachers young group. want teacher take 1/500 chance dying work, paying $20,000 extra (or giving teachers $10 million life insurance policies COVID death).

The obvious answer ""we cannot afford that"". indeed obvious. cannot afford teachers work unvaccinated. I’m shedding tears airline industry. Certain factories contracts EU britain stopping total bullshit though. would AZ this? know EU bigger important market us. fact ordered earlier, manufacturing capacity now, getting vaccines earlier. AZ wouldn’t risking dispute contracts weren’t favour, fact reputable contract lawyers attested to. turns wrong reputation supplier would completely ruined. whilst vaccines cost, business would taking stupid risk. 

The EU tried call bluff asking contract published, instead facing reality totally fucked procurement choosing deny reality. Completely false pal - UK invested millions setting dedicated manufacturing facilities AZ factory inside UK. Matt Hancock adamant vaccine must manufactured entirely UK population. Plus without UK, it’s unlikely vaccine ever comes light - invested hundreds millions initial research (before AstraZeneca ever came board). government messed lot things, vaccine they’ve smashed park! right, data go two clinical studies (safety efficacy) 44,000 people backed dozens adenovirus vaccine-based trials looking safety efficacy hundreds thousands total participants well relatively well understood science cellular machinery adenovirus-based interacts cells. 

Your data is.. hunch suspicion something might wrong entirely expected lower efficacy single-dose vaccine entirely different division 30-50 years ago fretted deal minute traces asbestos fibers baby powder products evidence issue past 20 years.

Completely balanced. Lmfao. Another immature UK hater. Boring. Next. simpler theory would equal-fitness variant long-distance colonizing large population center ongoing epidemic spread difficult existing regional variant getting amplified much massive number ongoing superspreading events.

All models claim variants higher transmission vanilla SEIR models without dispersion (modelling superspreading). [The one I've seen used dispersion model found random chance account variants variant got lucky London involved initial superspreading events epidemic took late Fall taking expanding set superspreading events amplified used advantage (""I high ground"") took London favored take England things same.

Withough lucky like difficulty breaking existing backbone concentrated superspreading events SF/LA existing regional variants exclude colonization there.

It would also surprising evolution like kind spread genetic diversity instead favored situation dominant variant worldwide would construct barriers entry high without advantage genetic material would get amplified. Viruses probably ""smarter"" construct monoculture. mean, go back normal People always going dying COVID. vulnerable protected hospitalizations going plummet flu-like levels longer justification authoritarian health measures. Osterholm, notorious immensely pessimistic predictions, apparently stopped clock moment stated believed normalcy would come summer. anybody link that? think meant mean -- unfortunately seems case every country takes turn Covid... country West effective Covid entire pandemic. Italy March, France &amp; Spain April + May, UK US summer, Central, Northern, Eastern Europe October, Canada Portugal January 2021, etc... There's evidence suggest Pfizer Moderna 95% effective SA variant--the new variants around either company consider. know, might 0% effective. cancelling season?   Oh damn

Sorry

Didnt trudeau wife covid. Youd think hed want vaccinate country it. start pandemic hope people would able unite bit get thing done quickly. Unfortunately shown selfish entitled everyone is. People even wear piece cloth mouth 10 minutes go shop loaf bread. incredible least there's illusions us 'all together' whatever catch phrase popular. Remember Krakatoa erupted soon Nietzsche said God dead. likely happen anyway.... we'll see bullet foot mans credibility sorry vaccine used Brits, made Britain. Make video showing proof. Otherwise could making up.   many states whole number. quick mouseover map, Washington, Illinois, Iowa x.99 x.98. bit could darker color! South Dakota they're already darkest color. Well. wrong. Sorry, bud. 

It’s true likely transmission greatly reduced immunization, extent, yet know. Vaccines often completely prevent infection prevent disease. requirement herd immunity. It’s fine. 

Numbers driving end. Vaccines huge part that. It’ll happen pretty soon. EU perfect, much though might structurally prefer remain Union think anyone ever claimed can't reform. particular case gamble made centralised procurement vaccines instead every country own, logically seems correct (and many block still turn better). something big centralised risk cock-up turning bigger cockup. similar UK test trace programme, decided use national scheme instead relying local expertise. love fellow european ?

I think Europeans half brain understand Commission fucked things EU countries, Brits. !Remindme 5 weeks blindly said factually wrong say either way. saying incorrect said Yeah, that's works. Newborns protected mothers antibodies months, forever. nothing COVID, happens every disease (including presumably bubonic plague). Go back read typed tell give shit anybody else.

That condescending insulting thing read while. Great! Sooo mentioning ending restrictions all, even thinking end point? we've vaccinated risk population covid longer poses significant threat. side effects J&amp;J vaccine better/worse moderna/pfizer? know second shot moderna/pfizer rough curious J&amp;Js. earth talking about? actually saying freedom restricted can't walk street calling people N-word screaming, ""Gas Jews.""? Newsflash, like basically everywhere world people crying everywhere else. Except US guess they've got vocal group stupid people there. allowing speech agree with

No, allowed incite violence discriminate someone based protected categories like disability, religion, gender, sexuality, et cetera. still say really fucked up, controversial stuff totally fine. quickly!? 3 months rehab achilles quickly. Less painful too. understand 100% people won’t able get matter much supply have. However, it’s anti-vaccine movements brought back viruses we’ve nearly wiped out. agree, get way (for now), need stop pretending like bad decisions (whether directly way not) don’t significant negative impact. WOW pandemic doesnt anything brexit. all. 

Praise NHS. AZ Pfizer, 1 dose gives shit load protection according available evidence have. 

We might get March start booster shots, even bother. here’s thing original purpose lockdown prevent overrunning hospitals vaccines proven decrease point measures people either asymptomatic mild case? UK variant deletions spike cause picked tests. mean people still die covid despite proper hospital care, many survive appear moderate-to-severe chronic symptoms afterward Hungary 5 different kind vaccines approved (including Russian Chinese ones). EU vaccine scheme opt in, much Brexit. Well, there's like zillion people places east coast space west texas. incredibly empty there. There's stiff competition.

I think us good start ultimately countries approve vaccines imagine production capacity starts get split bit more.

Lets hope production continues ramp anyway!

Any vaccine anywhere good news point. I'm anxious get mine patient. far, Pfizer still makes majority vaccinations. 75%. change coming weeks. certainly hopeless people last long. went couple Universities post grad assure level 'hopeless' Cambridge much lower run mill places. expectation volume quality work insane comparison. nothing Brexit, logistics honestly luck (the UK plant didnt suffer delays/bad batch, EU ones did) .. 

The UK approved vaccines even left EU. top, 20 30 covid vaccinated countries EU. 

I believe missing bit perspective... extremely privileged EU UK. anyone happen know viscosity typical vaccine solvent? Asking friend.  videos posted show masks part. Maybe two people 100.

you come say that's true post videos anything all.

I live sweden, friends live cities tell pretty much nobody wearing masks even buses. shown many videos prove point.

You'd point posted proof. Everything else opinion. show proof.

The videos posted show reality ground stockholm biggest city videos clear people wearing masks.

Again, show guy apparently, words, issues moving around freely gym cafés mall etc, probably surprising social circle includes irresponsible individuals

Then swedes irresponsible since that's see everyday. restaurants full, coffeshops same, supermarkets, gyms open. swedes irresponsible then?. died horrifically painful death, sedated can’t scream respirator. Kinda really. another person commented, already spend £30bn week furlough scheme, extra £1 billion isn’t much risk considering successful, scheme doesn’t go long open quicker. 

Also, U.K. made orders around 400 million doses different vaccines (I believe 7 different vaccines don’t source hand this). Production already started even vaccine approved use: even 50% vaccine types unapproved, would position start vaccinating immediately anyway vaccines approved. Instead starting produce vaccines approved, vaccines started administered immediately approval. Yeah thing lot people get tested think little cold... happens often live... is... Exactly. states didn’t get hit hard March/April, tend achieve effective herd immunity 0.15-0.20% death range. Places like Mississippi Dakota try extra hard keep pandemic going reach fatality rate. Article little behind news. Fauci predicting “young children” around late summer. I’d take inside information point. Layman’s bet: He’s talking J&amp;J maybe Astra Zeneca. simpler distribute. 

Large school districts shit show next year. Suburban districts mostly normal (no masks). Rural districts you’d never know virus. 

There going something absolutely sad wrong we’re sending kids school masks plexi glass September it’s likely bars full capacity hours point. get wasted 2am kids slap mask on. doubt it. 

Will predictions normal one deadline think everybody coalescing around: next school year. mean want get real technical 3 people trial got vaccine died (compared 16 get it). Fauci, unfortunately, focused public health messaging vast majority population immunized, discourage non-urgent travel. 

Obviously, vaccinated elderly person wants visit grandchild, risk infection extremely low. He's simply maintaining population-wide message fine. Yeah. highly doubt she'll re-elected. disappointing. mention developing countries can’t accommodate storage requirements first available vaccines. Canadian here, similar headlines ffs!? People breaking strain pandemic. Depression, Anxiety, Substance Abuse, Suicides way up. We've goalposts repeatedly shifted us, social distancing flatten curve, getting spike, vaccine, knows when. need end sight, vaccine logical one.

That also end pandmeic fastest- best way get people take vaccine tell ticket back normal life. tell continue social distancing, many take pandemic last longer. Uk basically export restriction. bad one together

Tax religious institutions. I'm sure EU fail world. Vaccine nationalism something EU considering, since sort dirty tactics European happen. something US DPA, UK baked vaccine nationalism contract according AZ CEO. honest EU done good allies poorer countries comes vaccines west. think important EU keep huge lead.

And I'm saying guilt European Commission things well. view main guilty party AstraZeneca. European happy European production capacity still ensuring allies get vaccines (unlike allies ehum). 

And yes EU saying best reasonable effort count vaccine proved work could delivered shady. might true, sitting blackened part contract (which mostly seem ordered AZ). clear delivery quantities discussed contract. Q1 80-120 million think. Also, claimed AstraZeneca expressly assured us contract obligations stand way fulfilling contract. turned true. Something AZ CEO might lied interviews did.

People like said, know true. reporting deaths drop pretty significantly weekends. 7 day average peaked 3,439 Jan 26th. Well consider case counts usually week actual infection, people die right away time hospital, usually days case counted begin with.

Flu shots come pre-filled syringes (most them, anyway) pull one fridge, screw needle, inject. Even multi dose flu vials, draw 0.5 mL put back fridge. expires June 30.

It’s different current COVID vaccines multidose vial thawed clock ticking doses vial don’t get used within relatively short timeframe (hours days) go waste.

So workflow quite different. got one better “experts say worst yet come” Portugal part one ""no need lockdown, send kids school"" countries? UK export block vaccines. Stop posting misinformation, export ban. simply contract says one factory produce first 100M doses UK UK, alternative would 100M doses produced Europe would mean less supply Europe. dense?

The UK ordered 30M initial dose received 500k. math much shortfall is. bigger cut Europe faced. course Europe never cared that. 

There huge drama here. Neither intentional. manafacturing issues. issues mostly solved, soon UK send doses Europe too. 

UK faced similar cuts pfizer Biontech, blame Europe, UK even received even 1 Moderna either despite Europe uk signed contract early

US upfront export rules, different behavior EU, trying sign contracts change later date. backed good reason international critique vaccine protectionism strong feeling general public curb public support provided government? Article paywalled. say earliest week could provide 2 million? easily duped literally oldest trick political book, throwing public tantrums creating enemies distract personal failures, there's point trying convince you, sad many people fall something obvious. 
 
There's way job this. EU's fuck up. Nope. Pfizer made Belgium (same one used Can, Israel). AZ made UK exclusively financed UK thr explicit purpose user first 100mil doses. designed developing world. Absolutely. mRNA vaccines gamechangers future viruses. Many people aware research going years. reasons behind hesitations many people. Others get vaccines ""nobody tells do"" type mentality. 

As education, know guy, works hospital. vaccines beginning. Dr. long respected explained him. already recieved 2nd dose. lol, joke, there's tons them. Albury/Wodonga, Echuca/Moama, Cobram/Barooga, Yarrawonga/Mulwala, VIC/NSW border alone. lack concern sub human life truly disturbing say this, despite us fewest amount cases today nearly three months 7 day average decreased 100k span 3 weeks? hell going get easier? need go FDA testing change genetic code vaccine?  Absolute bollocks.

Your comment absolute garbage ashamed yourself. 😂 keep coming. great It’s pathetic disappointing. It’s okay cause 800 lb gorilla Slug Ford called Pfizer let know wanted more. parents go pick food? Also there's still issues internet access unstable home environments. Highly infectious respiratory diseases aren’t easily controlled top orders move populations ways largely beyond control. 

Seems pretty obvious.  plan absurd. they're exporting vaccines countries? better protected Pfizer Moderna get even mild form Covid get JnJ, mild form Covid natural immunity antibodies? Maybe much unknown now? don’t know. Sorry, body choice totally acceptable.  Yeah know that, stuff like plastic body bags planes, women shaved heads, self policing whatnot NYC, etc wondering part accepted guideline don’t agree what’s “logic” behind that, makes sense wonder would tables turned, EU really well, would help UK? Would Canada help US?

Judging week, I'm sure. EU would probably UK focus program first promise excess doses exported. Germany helped us desperate ventilators, blocked PPE exports situation. ban made EU wide shortly after. there's precedent. Geez. man vaccinated first? We're talking regional (i.e. clearly distinct major city). Cities like Albury, Alice Springs, Gold Coast Sunshine Coast (close Brisbane), Wollongong can't support bigger planes. Somewhere like Newcastle Cairns could 3km runways, need hotels hundreds people, might realistic. think there's much choice since there's almost places large airport long runway enough hotels. Thanks th info. able find info 20M doses companies Novavax provide doses Q1. No, article state infected time different strains. article states tested positive strains once, makes claims source infections (as made clear quote sourced yourself). far know could infected wild strain weeks earlier P1 strain recently. inventing strawman argument, misinterpreting clear concise article. taxes. hit close home? recovered quicker normal, didn’t he? Education certainly key that, need set precedent “your body choice,” thinking (in case) isn’t acceptable that’s way works. suggesting force vaccines can. 

These vaccines seem like they’ve developed super fast, however lot research going work progress years (mRNA example). urgency funding made priority finalize research.  UK relatively big pharmaceutical industry size UK government threw money AZ ensure would complete possible domestic vaccine supply chain avoid potential disruptions (ironically actually worried Trump rather EU).

Not AZ, 3/5 vaccines ordered investment make sure made here. Like said, worried Trump blocking exports putting pressure US companies divert doses. Pfizer showing 90% efficacy first shot administered 10-14 days pass know bonafide sells cheap KN95’s. N95’s bit expensive though. 

But Lowe’s several boxes. also use 3M furnace filters (1900), toolbox industrial towels zeps, single layer mask place p95 filter (same N95 technically). That’s I’m making replacement filters half mask respirator. can’t say filtration work exactly well p95 better cloth mask! know 2 towels least 51% filtration. think we're 4 masks want kill grandma. Sheesh 

 mentioned canada *once* last sentence put hoarding air quotes clearly illustrate Canada actually hoarding, ordered several times population that's placing risk orders early. 

 specifically said ""it's like they're drowning doses"" ""they gift extra doses out"" 

I say US export ban ""to"" take strain non US manafacturing either, implying altruistic goal, said effect manafacturing zero sum, true. vaccine already developed UK EU signed contract. 336 million production paid EUs 2 factories supply chain (at cost). course could wrong, UK awful villains. commission good job handling them. Make sure get Alfredos Pizza, Pizza Alfredo Lol  I’ve seen sub Thanks source. good article. None Biden... mean, plenty ways. Pay otherwise coerce lab technician giving positive test result show people actually negative. Pretend suffered known symptoms loss smell really didn’t symptoms. ~~supported~~ enforced government Worst mayor ever   They've already prepared booster variants. forgot mention, think important illustrating broader point, typically developing 6-year-old great virtual learning. still something monitor, accessible still learning - unlike special needs daughter entirely inappropriate inaccessible. think recent examples laid really well 11:30 want watch set disregards answers) assure roll seamlessly every year. look like do, behind counter mess. chronically understaffed management needs thrown ocean. hope too. know decrease currently observed maintainable forever, six weeks now, 1.5 million vaccinations per day, 93 million total doses injected. One would hope would limit deaths among susceptible fair margin, one would also hope estimate undershot. Lmao farce was. Can't believe lost. Ladies case aware, shove baby powder vagina. finally crushed rock. internal use lmao. County PA may get 2 feet snow, already several inches. Canada highest vaccine per capita order world!But ordering matter much unless get suppliers nailed deliveries contracts.

3/5 vaccines UK large orders also made UK. That's key difference there. invested creating new factories expanding current ones. Canada putting money though, hopefully helps. ""Pascal Soriot: ""There lot emotions vaccines EU. complicated"" - la Repubblica"" CEO confirmed numbers interview earlier week. 17 million doses February, similar March. 31 million, 34+. Also says less expected. Pretty much like US strategy wonder countries well, soon vaccinate populations fast possible, go full export mode countries world.


US UK also biggest funders COVAX would fake positive test? LFG Think bigger. Natural selection universal phenomenon, would actually every single person world living normal happy lives, whatever happens happens. Aka lockdowns restrictions Whatever floats boat  might faked it. excluding Leo Poon?! There’s trial site near waitlisted people opening enrollment less two weeks. I’m optimistic they’ll accrued enough (varied) subjects already.  Love 1:1 ratio! freezing storage requirements dictates requires major urban facility would ability to
house vaccine. article stupid, shit rural areas don’t require people travel populated areas. 2 billion total global production. EU two deals pfizer, one 300 million option another 100 million think second same. Looks like additional 75 million. “First American company European companies obliged do” / it’s weird reading things every day SPEED thanks :) saw mention health concerns regarding son returning school. That’s terrible position put in. hope able remain Covid free. well, I'm okay, still frustrating. guys able enjoy summer without covid, wait next summer. Two full summers lost crap leaders incompetent get us enough vaccines.

Thanks kind words though. body choice shit women want birth control make tough decision abortion shut vaccination site. it’s rules thee. understand loved one dying corona would terrible thing. understand everyone 20-40 years old. wear mask try stop spread. wear mask 100% time. understand young people spread vulnerable people. 

But really admit isn’t news? 
It’s trying scare clicking. 

There hidden “brutal truth”. Young people aren’t dying corona. Period. title lie. “brutal truth”. 

In Uk, average age death corona 80 years old. 0.64% deaths ages 20-40. 0.64% deaths isn’t lot. It’s 300 people. includes 20-40 year olds pre existing conditions. 300 people. 

It’s obviously horrible died, it’s lot people. “brutal truth” like article claims. 

Again, wear mask 100% time believe science. understand young people spread old people.

But, really admit article title lie? 30% fast food workers teenagers, average age like 29. meant part-time job high school kids, right now. time stop empowering fools. Willful ignorance sickness continues spread lazy minded.  Hungarian chance? agree that, stance I've found infuriating early days.

Especially primary justification due variants impacting vaccine roll - variants exist within months pandemic starting message already ""we're going learn live it"".

Exponential way up, exponential way down. Vietnam China SK could contain, others could too. Heck, Victoria peaked daily cases 7day average France UK - 10x higher pop. Summer would easier window.

Ofc harder world incubated virulent numerous mutations, find pandemic purgatory particularly rough thing put people. Italy's medicines agency Saturday approved AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine adults recommended alternatives given people aged 55.

AIFA's decision comes day European Union gave green light jab, Germany's vaccine commission recommended using older people amid questions effectiveness rejected company.

""AIFA authorises AstraZeneca vaccine prevention Covid-19 disease individuals age 18, per European Medicines Agency guidance,"" said.

But noted ""a level uncertainty"" claims jab's effectiveness people age 55, age group ""poorly represented"" trials.

To help best use vaccine, recommended ""preferential use AstraZeneca vaccine, pending data, subjects 18 55 years old, solid evidence available"".

It urged ""preferential use messenger RNA vaccines older and/or frail subjects"".

So-called mRNA vaccines include Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna jabs, based new technology previously untested real-world situation.

They use inert snippet genetic code coronavirus trigger immune response body repel active virus.

Many vaccines - including Oxford/AstraZeneca - variants method used flu jabs, based virus killed rendered harmless.

AstraZeneca earlier rejected German media questioning vaccine's effectiveness 65s.

""Reports AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine efficacy low eight percent adults 65 years completely incorrect,"" firm said statement last Monday.

""In November, published data Lancet demonstrating older adults showed strong immune responses vaccine, 100 percent older adults generating spike-specific antibodies second dose,"" added.

Even support everyone wage wise 1:1 doesn’t remotely touch long term life delaying impacts What??? Bruh I'm trying explain people no, dont know everything still safe next months give early

I'm sorry y'all care people concerned happiness thats problem need sort therapist turn switch starts running one point full tilt it'll ramp up, takes time. vaccination production, distribution, lot..

Given Serum Institute largest vaccine producer world, India craziness good stuff, they've given good headstart starting earlier, honestly think next three months India going results awe world. European press keep spinning 80m doses ""promised"" q1.

Contract press? doubt ""models"". extrapolated numbers time forward another month two without regard immunity. That's EU signed contract 80M Q1. he's trying build insanity defense Exactly, use words ""statistically speaking"" would expect least 7-8 people died take lowest mortality number available assume across population. begin factor comorbidities number quite bit higher. big deal. ""'The end beginning.' dark winter Americans see end""

Actual headline CNN morning. 

Seriously, Fuck MSM fear-mongering, clickbait, articles. 

Also, doubt Osterholm good doctor, reason nickname ""Dr. Doom"" creating excessive fear, good balance reassurance proper precautionary statements. missing anything?

Yes. Movie theaters example limited max 8 customers time. similar limitations business well. common right-wing talking point prior evidence studies show countries higher minimum wages still high levels youth working class employment. sure travel far pandemic pretty wreck less. Considering time UK told visit family xmas Anyone know pick old newpapers? Kinda want pick old ones historical purposes  Deleting reddit app see feel after. like positive spin thread had, concerns variants fueled threads. SAD going bit wild always February, need proactive. 

Going live real world bit focus running. first 30 mile week, there's giant noreaster! get second vaccination next Friday. Maybe stay til then. Stay well, everyone. Same. able notice symptoms wanted Link CDC paper article talks never actually links to: post satire, right?  Michael Osterholm isn’t part Biden’s team, he’s part “they” Kyriakides signed best efforts contract

Just like UK US. Seeing tell got vaccine placebo, surprising. mean exactly. mean low transmission rates? ask go itt from. explanation correct? Nah, willfully stupid plague rats start. seem sure, always here. 2 million doses per day - exceptional capability. that's odds hospitaisted taken vaccine.  What? literally opposite said. Oxford team also rather sanctimoniously claimed test 55s 'unethical'.  Implicitly criticizing vaccine producers 'risk taking'.

Been bit disaster Oxford-AZ combo.  Messed trials, messed distribution ended vaccine limited unknown effectiveness. mention hundreds thousands teachers already it... deserves upvotes! :) Gosh, must exhausting angry wrong time Conflict spurs development  Yeah makes sense, like hemophilia get cut, give shot stop bleeding.  McDonald's surprisingly good company. Everytime hear either giving food poor trying look thair workers.
 think I'm going pay one delicious double sausage egg Muffin breakfasts tomorrow morning. Take care McDonald's. Osterholm consistently pessimistic, doesn’t necessarily mean he’s wrong everyone currently agrees There’ll ‘Clap Tom’ week bet even though anyone else travelling abroad Christmas they’d slaughtered. Haha well fun staying inside rest life then, I’m gym going visit grandparents afterwards. us scared near 100% survival rate. also conveniently ignores Australia New Zealand - two countries famous rule breaking.

Second, need make clear tightening temporary. society rule-breakers get board tighter procedures know there’s end sight. faster tighten, faster we’ll reduce threat, faster we’ll restore freedom. nations need call cultural ambidexterity: ability adjust tight loose based dangerous conditions are. New Zealand exemplifies approach. Kiwis famously loose, enacted world’s strictest measures early – tamed rule-breaking spirit, limiting Covid-19 deaths 25. Again, imagine vaccine effective virus deadly bribed take saw thing. comments like 2 yours. It’s almost they’re trying program brains constant onslaught bad news. Either bad news real we’re screwed? I’m sure perspective really accounts couple things.

One thing consider timeline associated immunity. Pfizer, you’re good one week second dose — whole month, basically, first. Moderna 4 weeks doses. 

If J&amp;J shot come ~70% effective shortly it’s administered, that’s huge huge huge advantage. doesn’t rely people’s behavior perfect another month, doesn’t rely people schedule attend another appointment. 

If vaccine that’s 95% effective second dose non-zero attrition rate non-zero number people get infected doses, really ~that~ much better option one-and-done? Think going say end February quarter US vaccinated, numbers half people Florida already giving masks qt grocery stores. really seems places elimanted covid bit hesitant 

And wait see

Due variants etc Even that's case still massive improvement. Diabetics take shots every single day. minor inconvenience way better debilitating illness.

For cancer would one-time treatment. Cancer types cell dividing uncontrollably. could make mrna simply tell cells stop dividing that's end cancer. tumor would still there, chance spreading would reduced zero. J&amp;J going approved well? Hmm. seems really vary based location etc. parents got first shot Rite aid 2nd appointment automatically made  Someone correct I’m wrong, think US 7 day quarantine negative test.  garbage drug. best SSRI OCD, long shot. great anxiety depression. I've almost 6 months, nausea far, fatigue take another drug counter.

Its effectiveness depression/anxiety also nothing potential effectiveness covid. Remember remdesivir originally failed ebola drug. We've getting lots preliminary research fluvoxamine COVID since least November.

They claim 99% accuracy 2 metres away (the article says also works glass) PCR test maximum 98% accurate. dont get it. need vaccine already patient?  Wow fast food really cares people! Thanks obesity!!❤️ transmission 1 margin, travel matter, tourist island nations counted.

If new strain extreme transmission increase, cheaper implement border quarantine, like countries top 2020 GDP change did.

We missed option N501Y mutation. Others follow, contagious, evading vaccines. missed again, lockdowns happen again.  mean know lot people scared possible side effects novel vaccine.

Got educate rayehr mock people. I'm picturing Mr. Gower chronic anger issues, acute episode George saw. can't helped. least he's medical professional. I'm place locks perpetuity vaccine. There's big difference. would supported 3 month lockdown Europe strict ending goal possible, 11 month one.

People giving here. Governments failing give concrete goal, lockdown till get shit order nobody knows is. Hi! Macedonian here. Serbia fine, they’re getting vaccines, also gave us, well paid them, 8000 vaccines. Right now, state Balkan terrible, Serbia started vaccinations. evidence linking strains variants reinfections. virtually evidence reinfections period. Apologies, forgot add not. missing point. 75000 people received vaccine trial, none died covid.

None.

That really, really big deal. Doubling down, eh? Think. know considered preexisting condition? numerous people 'preexisting condition' medically defined. Diabetes &amp; high blood pressure among them: list. homework information figure many Americans people around world considered risk severe COVID. lot think 400,000 Americans dead. cast get 3 years long term effects efficiency year virus knew nothing abs know really much it... whole country covid free dawg, whatever want now. people flying locked down.

Cheers shitty situation, earned it. nice! It’s haredim Thats fair, follow twisty road stats far willing to. like keep simple enough follow.

But either way sending positive vibes India, imagine tough pretty impressed news upcoming vaccine plans India neighbours. Curevac ready months well, mRNA vaccine last months normal refrigerator temperatures. Awesome Same. local mom group filled raging posts people bringing kids “closed” parks summer. dare spread Covid! really, people (like me) knew parks nothing Covid. wasn’t going keep kids knew outdoors fine. 

Then governor let parks open, posts shifted dare people wear masks park! said sitting bench away ppl didn’t see need, got told reason schools still closed lol. don’t even know respond people. Yes, lockdown cases reduce enough contact tracing works.

This requires strict enough lockdown take R somewhat 0.7. Knowing situation is, can't people keep **rotating stock** home instead panic buying.

To fair, _is_ toilet paper rolls work. Hmm normally yes, wonder since given first populations deaths concentrated. got flu twice 2 years. One summer case worse nice yet felt like garbage could barely muster enough energy walk downstairs couch bed. also one day kids return school start Term 1, doubt wise precautionary strategy.

Even ends non-event, hopefully spooked enough people prepared next time. Read ""vacation"" nearly shit March, tbh Okay 👌 buddy. 

I read comments first one. Realize keyboard warrior one actually cares. Please make rest us pay selfishness.

You quarantine years, wish.

Get delivery. Find work-from-home job. Live Zoom. Wear respirator need go doctor hospital.

It's perfectly possible.

But instead, insist billions locked you.

I cannot fathom anything selfish. shameful. cheaper get vaccinated get two weeks sick. fighting Congress avoid getting mandatory sick leave. sub weird mix we're going die everything normal summer.

If store turned away wearing mask, I'd frontline defending you.

But forcing billions take part mania draw line. I'm sorry, think year lockdown evil. Thanks. wonder scientific/medical explanation is? second dose cause severe side effects? guess stupidity worldwide problem amount people stayed indoors without families whole year died anyway, I'd living Barbados 100 Captain Sir...  led NHS, rather someone Tory party’s mate

Do remember hate vaccine taskforce got though? lot whole ""corruption torys given friends jobs"", turned bullshit.

This led NHS Army so... yes, I'd expect level success. Great data tidbits.

Considering Pfizer Moderna: Given saying, end June (5 whole months away) 26M doses, enough inoculate 13M, ~1/3rd total population 39M. Even higher also add immune covid (probably 3-5M), we're concerned adult population.

Regardless, would mean then, beyond, maintain restrictions combination vaccinations want get point lift restrictions.

I really hope vaccines, including manufacturers, come faster projected, whilst also maintain awe fast manufacturers able push vaccines. I've explain many times... engrained memory... Haha Yeah that’s thought. sure bad timing good timing? ""No deaths related COVID-19 reported vaccine group, 5 deaths placebo group related COVID-19. Overall, 16 deaths placebo group, 3 deaths vaccine group. ""

placebo group 5 covid deaths 8 non-covid deaths 
vaccine group 0 covid deaths 3 non-covid deaths 


If test enough people people might die day getting vaccine shear dumb luck. used make gross approximation, important note symptom cause damage body. every cases, getting vaccine severely improve immune system's reaction covid, considerably reduce chance getting version damage system. chance already low, much lower. 

Obviously, still want avoid it, like avoiding flu many illness. reason put body anything unnecessary, want become vector transmission, ""mild covid"" without vaccine ""mild covid"" vaccine. Well fast well written explanation! Thank sir Yep, bunch knee jerk headline reactionaries jump one headline next. Oh see Nearly one ten Americans, WARP SPEED! Vaccine cause positive test. would assume infected quarantine. pretty likely decent protection vaccine thus mild asymptomatic case. Boris actually right thing start, would different place right now. 2-3 week delay beginning pandemic, seeing happening Italy, gone lockdown forced masks, sanitising whole shabang.

I think fair. 50% deaths since November due new variant. control then, time identified happening late.

Oh kidding, they'll find new villain. Maybe it'll China? That's mass testing contact tracing needed well; lockdowns work vacuum. another week numerous clusters breaking Australia day. saw many people park maskless chilling right next other. Mods can’t accept truth Yes good news marked third day row 1.5 million coronavirus vaccine doses given United States, according Washington Post tracker, 12th straight day 1 million shots given. Thanks Trump 🙏🏻 Texan here. drove 55 miles get vaccine. Got 5PM spent night car get vaccine 6AM next morning. 37 degrees night. Totally worth it. UK making many vaccines home helps. Countries best same. agree entirely.

It's great news vaccine roll going well, government commended. Everything else disorganised, tumultuous set contradicting actions, starting nothing crucial early months let get control; forgotten.

Essentially political decision economy kept running hope things get bad. (along seeming inability government take action quarantining international travellers) dangerous thing gamble. 

I'm fortunate enough live Australia, state actually took seriously March. essentially back open business, economic hardship inconvenience us international travel, occasional clusters forming around quarantine hotels scan barcode enter businesses. rest world followed model would significantly fewer cases deaths. make mistakes, gambled hurting economy protect people seems paid off.

I suspect we'd still boat international travel, vaccine rolling light end tunnel explain article commenting describes patient fighting _two_ variant infections once? Clearly body's immune response learned one infection enough stop other.

This ""The patients, 30s, infected late November P.2 variant coronavirus identified Rio, also known B.1.1.28 lineage, simultaneously tested positive second variant virus."" body infected two variants simultaneously, built resistance symptoms reportedly mild, dry cough one case, coughing, sore throat headache second. require hospitalization.

Getting COVID Flu way worse getting infected two variants cross immunity. concerns mostly terms virus mutating way fast variants start becoming way different base variant could actually considered new strain. Right slow evolution virus fact vaccines rolling out, stand great chance preventing actual new strain evolving. I've heard people day two flu symptoms get second shot - enough call work. Lockdowns work they're magic like people want be. good lockdown needs done measurable goal mind supported government.  hope Summer weekend year. week last year bummer. Here’s archive link anyone wants it. worth reading.[archive link anyone trouble accessing article He's spot on, actually. Vaccines ramping up, surely, simply far behind race. Combined loosening restrictions, winter still ongoing, hard predict what's happen. right groups may prove useful, held back help people faster.

Lol. strange. pretty much directly affected amount snow plows have. point cost benefit analysis: 500 plows salt sitting around snowstorms happen ten times winter? Sure, that's useful. happens twice year, cost effective less trucks wait out.

That's cities actually pretty close geographically often different snow shutdown policies. Think Philadelphia Baltimore. difference latitude affects often they're snowed in. Since they're snowed less Baltimore, less equipment clear it, blizzards shut things longer. There's court documents say different. 
The court proved stance border closures incorrect. 
Next. second dose vaccine 1/21. tested positive (came contact positive person, got test yesterday). Would vaccine cause positive test result unrelated? Yes, slowly it’s taking time ramp up.

Usually opinion articles get blocked bot.  sociologists opinion. mixes weird definition “loose” societies impact political deception former President happened US.

He also conveniently ignores Australia New Zealand - two countries famous rule breaking.

I thought opinion pieces appropriate quality sources sub? Lol... well isn’t bare fucking minimum. harder criticize Eu, harder scapegoat Eu uk shortcomings

Both true. I'm staunch remainer idea EU infallible kind utopian organisation bit prevalent remainers think. EU far perfect many others Britain believe would better inside outside. mean EU always right criticism. vaccine mess proved that. triggering article 16 Northern Ireland protocol absolutely shameful completely removed EU's prior moral high ground issue. also brings question whether EU really even give shit peace process Ireland they'd quickly. I'm sure many Ireland particularly pissed feel like maybe EU backs much purported. 

A huge fuckup EU. June EU (HIT). news extra facilities expansion facilities BioNTech Moderna, might even May. wait see much AZ deliver Q1 catch Q2. Maybe EU still magic NovaVax contract still make deliver Q2. knows.

So pretty much guaranteed EU completely open summer (like last year... lol). Wow. Tldr. work week starting I'm reading elementary school thesis especially first sentences. absurdity equivocating India's actions US, India donated millions doses continues US donated exported single dose. original point US hoarding blanket export ban. given exported single dose anyone else despite production abilities. country done this. definition hoarding.

Look every country something shitty point. need turn patriotic blind eye it. gotten lot respect admitted US hoarding play big part developing two major vaccines, double insisting hoarding using terms understand trying compare US country donated doses world. Laughable. Israel back normal now? face masks, social distancing Theres single place US compliance anywhere near 100%. None stuff works never them. Lockdowns require enforcement via threat force one bother. scheme allows countries make orders companies EU ordering themselves. Watched netflix mini series called unorthodox weekend emphasized quote said orthodox jews get lot children replace millions lost (whether plot actual truth discussion away). 


Given context feels extremely ironic. “Zero COVID” final goalpost move forever lockdown crowd.  look 30 wealthiest countries world, many EU people clearly tired want vent Reddit comments! Go friends I'll take it. Exactly McDonald's doing... So, wait, immune system gives symptoms get sick? US media claiming can't go back normal vaccination? get economy speed faster EU vaccination program, we'll less fucked short term. Long term, ehh evidence anecdotal constantly say 'I many friends got covid recovered fine'. Long covid affects small number people. know girl visited parents whole semester every child especially young due financials lack options.  said, know fact national governments spent large amounts money developing Covid vaccines show EU statistics. seen total breakdown 27 governments spent (there probably isn't). know individual cases Italy funding new Italian vaccines Germany spending 1 billion vaccine development. Thus, reasonable assume 27 spend much higher figure EU cited.

I Anglophile since first moved UK 50 years ago (people communicate fluently English usually are), also know half century EU/EC-bashing biased British mind. EU greatest thing ever happened Europe defend EU frenzy hatred seen UK recent times.

Again, lets use coronavirus forum continue controversy may forums. work 4 4 love it. Still 50-55 hours get 4 days off, time kids etc.

I really think people longer days days off, productive mini research country decided look number UK thought 98% little high. states following:

[Over 80% aged 65 England received flu vaccine far year – highest uptake ever Trudeau done ok ways

The pandemic however complete total disaster. Total reliance provinces work feds muck approving vaccine half world already  baffling.
I'm Indian. Met several Pakistanis past years. Everyone nice people. good opinions Indians too.

The media sides amplifying views few. Real voices silenced. sad. anyone watch TWiV? doctors/virologists (especially Daniel Griffin) seem pretty optimistic status vaccinations/vaccines good news since means UK variant scary making be. 

Are kidding me? got annihilated UK think ""scary"" talking about? BS? 

The article peoples propensity “follow rules”.

Do really think everyone doesn’t follow rules necessarily someone actively spewing BS?

You poster child everyone wrong internet, easily pushed path thinking everyone easily divided good bad buckets know exactly people bad bucket think believe. far I've read likely get approval end Q1 early Q2. EU definitely close done vaccination efforts then. UK US might along course.

They definitely issue selling they'll able produce. Iirc that's immune , 80% eliminating severe symptoms young use confronted high exposure body fight constantly. requirement die it. severe case require hospitalization? *America  definately changed

I boss telling cases low needed come office, told testing centres city closed course rates look low.

That madness, think scaled early, ditched testing, slowly reintroduced it. think everyone I've spoken recently problem. dad got moderna second dose mild symptoms next day. mom uncle got Pfizer wrecked second dose. Yeah nah Idk live Aus do, shit endemic worldwide sure

And probably Australia everyone vaccinated borders re-opened. Luckily vaccinations appear 100% close 100% effective preventing serious illness covid fine care, stick needle arm already. wanna go see girl course changed. different. family focused beachside well. Showing incoming international travellers course going down. 

Everywhere outside metro WA well. South West tourism area WA well.

Wheat belt towns consistently full Aussie tourists. replying you.  obviously mental issues going wishing horrible things happen people. Ahhh classic case Spanish flu Covid IFR around 0.5-1%. US case fatality rate around 2-3%. means 1 3-4 covid cases found.

Another way measure expected death toll without vaccines everyone getting sick US would 2-4 million people. 500k dead you’re 12-25% :,( Think reference anyone British NHS, US EU.

The British NHS long track record effective vaccination campaigns, even think seasonal jabs might highest uptake world? like many nations continent.

I get free flu jabs every year local GP bash thousands people morning, like well oiled machine. QR code door, choose route depending arm prefer, take seat, instant jab, back door. bet building 2 minutes tops. 

It's no-nonsense approach keeps cheap effective things like this, universal health care, French notoriously vaccine sceptic example.  75 million additional come existing facilities, good news. 

If 75 million additional come new facility Marburg, good EU. new facility Marburg intended produce 250 millions doses Q2. 75 millions 30% full power.  Yeah, still waiting better, cheaper health care. Guess he’s butt hurt losing he’s gonna share us now......
Jerk never even worked it. That's offensive labradors they've working getting plant ready since bought august. like started working weeks ago. 

setting sterile environment mass production vaccine simple task. like buy machines required ebay set random electricians temp agency.

it's actually insane quick was. We're getting 2 million doses day 1.3 million new doses 700,000 second dose far. Assuming get 2.5 million doses day 50% new doses... gets us another 40 million first dose end February. gets us 20% people first dose probably around 10% doses... 30% country virus probably going little bit higher maybe 35 March... probably around 50% protection senior citizens protected... means r0 around 0.8 25% increase r0 increased vaccination infections... around 1 therefore California kind levels weeks comes down. see British strain issue long short it... Hi there! We've discussed agree original decision. opinion piece reputable site (say, posted Financial Times), we'd probably allow it. is, blog post personal website, clear Rule 5 removal. Feel free repost ends publishing FT elsewhere. anyone else feeling like two narratives coming government vaccines available everyone US? keep hearing “late spring” gets walked back “no, no, early fall.” Luckily Fauci isn’t charge federal government, even Biden listens him, neither one charge state governments.

99% people going go back living normally everyone wants vaccine get it, regardless whatever nonsense Fauci comes with. No. think it’s closer third NY. obviously read contract.  enough vaccines *administered* yet. \*taps forehead\*

First wait vaccinated significant amount people, start opening up. MuH fReEdOmS Well course AZ CEO admitting blame here.

What EU takes issue getting 25 % order, UK seems getting everything ordered time. argue ""best effort"", exporting almost production higher bidder.

The contract released Friday, I've read, AZ could well breach contract indeed favoritizing UK.

Can't say anything sure right now, sure shit take AZ side story gospel, given long took AZ authorize release EU contract. underlying conditions, mine Friday thank god, way could worked yesterday, today could worked still bit bleh. NJ shut mega sites too. UK's strategy government's strategy JCVI's strategy. I'm gonna trust literal well informed experts immunological field study. I'm sure equally well informed them.... Thanks asking calling name. right big inconvenience. I'm part group believes mandatory. think we've seen big government over-reach power. wear mine think government allowed tell us leave house (my state still curfew) wear. people would still wear clothes even legal naked grocery store, think. masks.

My point adults capable making decisions. Feel free wear mask back home safe sound 10pm. Also feel free wear mask stay late want. shitty sounds obligation keep safe, responsibility - plan accordingly. Science perverted late I'd argue world leaned really far health stability point people economically ruined, amount time it'll take recoup wealth lost can't understated.

Once vaccines arms, understand even close 100% safe basically start reopening anyway simply can't forever. think hit somewhere 80-85 mil jabs total, would still great. 100 would insanely awesome highly doubt it. think article says? couldn’t find anything UK restricting vaccine exports *cries Portuguese* U.K. variant (which article about) discovered US five weeks ago. it’s going cause surge, well, what’s waiting for? comparable situation... going control really almost anywhere... US amount infection without variance UK it... UK around 15% new variant think... US maybe 30% perhaps 35% perhaps 25%... reduce effect new strain 50% relatively... 50% transmissible UK I'd expect maybe 30 35 US... that's counting vaccination... stays control next two months likely longer issue. also seeing large amount spread South Africa strain outside South Africa... speculation actually infectious original one reinfect becomes dominant way... that's case US able keep control part vaccines strain fall. Long short it... early mid-March pretty good sense things going... numbers continuing come fine. start leveling spiking bit still okay prolong things maybe another two four weeks lockdown eliminate it. came back. Guess might work time though, right? 

It work eliminate it, go another 10 months everyone vaccinated. hardly fools errand finish line sight. even rudimentary knowledge virus/vaccine. Suggesting [obviously] POSSIBLE, would avoid scenario infection, according FACT. Nobody knows long immunity last even mutations covered current vaccine. Moderna making booster covering current mutations. knows many be? go twitter discuss matter real scientist assert know FACTS behavior vaccine virus. prediction would probably borders open later 2021 probably restrictions still place.

Mid 2022 better bet care free travel think India incredibly young population thus probably significantly lower IFR. hey genius, flu vaccines made every year? Yeap. hundred thousand doses stored, offered population till people nursing home got two doses. Boggles mind.

I hope french people like lockdowns curfews. going take years. 24

It even bad day! know. remember sooner get vaccinated, sooner achieve herd immunity, sooner get back normal. I’m American I’ve maybe two Super Bowl parties life. Yes someone different view must foreign. Imagine thinking China would better ally India. Fucking Nixon. odds infecting another person cut dramatically, currently know much. Based think know symptom reduction leading reduced infectiousness, would guess effective vaccine would cause least 90% reduction risk transmission, whether want precautions light uncertainty risk tolerance situation. You’re pressure rev things 0 60, speak — don’t overwhelm yourself. Try 20 minute lunches own, rather jump epic catch-up dinner full table friends. shorter workouts gym slower time day. agree say you’ll pretty quickly realize much you’ve missed things, whether that’s case you, don’t feel like push hard find out. also thinks restriction almost administrations term Joe Rogan interviews clearly minority guess one upsides brexit

Just FYI, nothing stopping EU member state vaccine strategy like UK did. UK still EU (transitional period) began approving vaccines.

That said, would UK ""gone way"" relations EU strong leaving EU? Perhaps not. can't know. UK Gov obsessed focusing 1st vac showing ""numbers people vaccinated"" 

The long gap 1st 2nd vaccine could result virus adapting vaccine creating new variant evades completely.


They willing risk get good numbers press. Insane late is. couldn’t get licensed sooner? LMAO no. Thanks  Eternally mad?  Wheeeeew good unfortunately. ready summer we'll need booster variants start giving again. Yeah one unintended side effects brexit harder critisise EU anymore fear taken wrong way. would US export vaccines haven’t even able give Americans want them? I’m helping countries eventually government’s duty look citizens first. everyone US wants vaccine gotten would like see US help allies partners around world also get herd immunity we’re yet.  lot good news article, old narrow minded bickering comments. Thanks, I'll edit. Compare risk virus. 
Problem people avoid hazardous choice, don’t accept risk stochastic event like infection. amazing established, respected competent service like NHS achieve instead giving money greedy useless pals job.  data yet much vaccinated people transit probably case transmission severely reduced eliminated entirely. one say certain though data comes in. Preliminary data Israel promising though.

In place would fine working make risk tolerance decision yourself. risk almost certainly much lower though. we'd hit 2.5 million day tomorrow get there, i'm seeing it. 

70 million first doses roughly point we'd half country form immunity though. even reach point till March we're still really good shape. telephone game control

Study: “the results one data set would imply coefficient transmissibility anywhere 0.9 1.7, study needed 

Expert talking reporter: “this new variant could transmissible. worst case scenario maybe even 70% more.”

Headline: “new variant could 70% transmissible”

Redditor: hey hear new variant that’s definitely 70% transmissible?  eliminate here. bloke currently security guard working quarantine hotel, fucker broke rules also second job uber driver. Got person quarantining came elsewhere.  remember J&amp;J vaccine really ramp things would require double current rate vaccination starting tomorrow,.every day February. Music uvula. way Ive living lockdown theres reasonable chance end June 80  Quick everybody downvote nasty science. good news allowed here. entire state lockdown, Melbourne stricter rules.

Ireland interesting case I'm certain restrictions September inspired Melbourne specifically yes, guys done hard yards level Melbourne endured. reach 2 weeks 5 cases day average full lockdown lifted, 2 weeks 0 cases could say lockdown entirely. Ireland announced staggered easing restrictions end November still 200 cases per day... that's story everywhere. Pre-emptive easing soon could see light. led disaster everywhere.

I feel bad lot living lockdown far longer Melbourne to. I'd put unimaginative incompetent government. [Only 5 days Ireland introduce mandatory hotel quarantine incoming travellers. Australia since March 2020.

Good luck lockdown; hope gets control stay well throughout :) Novavax 

UK company? everything political point FFS Seems better split out. incredibly incredibly unlikely chance future mutation virus could cause negative side effects vaccine, ridiculous scenario happens long term impacts vaccine, best put eggs one basket. could keep society going people received vaccines problem taken care of.

It’s exactly realistic scenario since odds minuscule, consequences extreme enough justify it. think schools fix it.

Mass production could started 3 months earlier EU commission act together. Well, could listen experts opinions safe guy astoundingly pessimistic views Technically UQ vaccine worked fine

I thought never reached point testing effectiveness? think year essentially locked homes caused us efficient usually EU paying double price UK




This wrong. One vaccine 20% expensive fiance happy BIG maybe. impossible. Remember vaccine rates see every flu season. table. Gerard died Covid!...... That's Gerard half million day, 100 days vaccinate 50 million people, roughly whole country. takes us end April. 

Why hearing non-risk group people take like September get vaccinated? Ha, good one. I’ve worked large pharma clients AZ deal agreements similar disclosed one daily basis.

Will die lot treat vaccines like fashion accessory refuse get life saving vaccines would prefer another one.

The math pretty simply, quicker population vaccinated, less people die. Waiting everyone get Pfizer Moderna vaccines kill awful lot people. right say want specific vaccine, right demand keep everything shut people choosy.

One member family covid fever. I’m wondering bad second shot now. flu order magnitude less deadly less infectious COVID-19, know vaccines prevent spreading disease (only prevents serious illness). shortage tests. CDC recommends exposure get tested, regardless level vaccination. OP absolutely right get tested. Shaming someone getting tested COVID-19 ridiculous unwarranted. Shame shaming (or perhaps need get much educated virus vaccines posting again). We've given total 937k vaccinations Canada, short double UK yesterday. UK twice population (and 41x smaller landmass). disappointed vaccines we've given work with. Tell me, think life’s danger? Lockdown everyone vaccinated. Gathering mark passing human acting like human.

Covid restrictions brought monsters people - denying people visits dying relatives, women giving birth alone wearing mask - us remember Old Ways. Dude I’m lucky job covers us two days side effects. first fine second wild strangest sickness ever. passed pretty quickly though Appreciate conversation response! Really kept thinking. feel family difficult time times. Everything seems scattershot haphazard (as healthcare education systems already suffer that.)

Best luck daughter hope get kids back routine education soon possible! Yep. days debilitating fatigue chills. Loss smell taste almost recovered Half french people don’t take showers daily wash hands lmao. Now, would pay fairly time *on*... solution? Yes. Without previous president, vaccine available till another years so. Science experts said impossible look now. “Common sense” isn’t science

Bloodletting common sense blood based disease gotten rid right?

Maybe maybe maybe, thresholds protecion exist it’s negligible wear 5 kind gloves think meant Republic China That's company goes extra mile people's health! Dumb take. Gathering hundreds pandemic acting like humans single place US compliance anywhere near 100%.

This true. I'm upstate New York mask use near 100% I've east coast pretty much same. Since competition? We're team. wonder getting approval anytime soon US   Nope. safe. Sadly, yet. That’s travel restrictions place, remove virus make ways community again, matter well screen prep population, even population 100% vaccinated hypothetically different variant I'm European always suprised people said US rollout failed.  You’re likely wealthier Olivia fucking Newton John.

I’m saying aren’t scary complications. first link least numbers still states “potential” complications research needed. middle links pure click bait quotes people drive titles instead studies. last even uses words “sometimes” appropriate still try pass like it’s comment occurrence. 

Again, don’t disagree COVID dangerous extremely dangerous. also don’t disagree detrimental long term effects. problem present facts based anecdotes misrepresented numbers. Long term, sever outcomes mild asymptomatic cases continue rare occurrence. don’t happen far happen. try push common data doesn’t support. know COVID scary, it’s end world vaccines risk mitigated enough live normal life.  cares people's opinions? likely even know mRNA is.

This absurd. u know right time die?
My guess statistics scientific findings production everything else put price vaccine. means vaccine cost, entire process cost. EU also pledged 300 million euros development production, entirely cost. Also much UK pay AZ vaccine. UK contract public, EU price blackened contract. WOW, that´s critical unethical. GCP exist reason keep trial participants fully informed study affects participant directly important. Also keep trust future pharma trials. 8 days week, miss something? guess supporting evidence, I'd say new south Wales. sort thing we'd do. downvoted? 😅 anyone know exact source article is? care much people, realize employees vaccinated cause drop productivity greater caused pto takes get vaccine. ""We need get mf-ing play stations OPEN"" We'll see things play out. Despite noise, would surprised UK quits lockdown 2-3 months earlier EU US maintains substantially lower caseload 2-3 months EU lockdown (obviously, US states lockdown).

Pfizer said they'll able fulfill EU order Q1, add 75 million doses extra Q2. AstraZeneca also said able deliver last week's pessimistic forecasts, even they're quite original amounts. Awesome. vaccines non morons. Before. table excited like week AZ suddenly dropped bomb nowhere. Denmark published similar schedule vaccination regular people starting mid April. think expect constant growth shipments schedule moved back weeks AZ.

And we'll people vaccinated Pfizer/Biontech might better comes longterm protection infectiousness. UK export block vaccines. Stop posting misinformation, export ban. simply contract says one factory produce first 100M doses UK UK, alternative would 100M doses produced Europe would mean less supply Europe. dense?

So UK contract blocking EU contract, says one factory produced UK - yet AZ breaching EU contract? EU contract breachable faced similar cuts pfizer Biontech, blame Europe, UK even received even 1 Moderna either despite Europe uk signed contract early

Blame EU what? EU addered vaccine nationalism like USA UK - difference one executive order Trump, ""per contract"", take word politicians trying proof Brexit fuck best deal century.

At least EU released contract suddenly started improve production xD Time *tendies*

(whatever are, lol) variants... Article right, tho wish wasn’t. 10 months “lockdown lite” US basically total waste time. Pandemic could stemmed several months ago w solid month serious lockdown actual compliance public, well shutting travel. Instead, many months shit looping infinity. Right... know startup costs? also need contingency costs, definitely since new system. 

The pay generally people employ faster make it. easier deal issues. pay upfront, obviously invest infrastructure too. 

Paying better thing U.K. example. 

It’s sold ‘at cost’ globally, third world. paying vaccine, much factories, that’s probably coming original investments. ‘At cost’ simply meaning profit.  Yeah initial goal 120 million. went 120 31. course expected there's possibility lower deliveries.

But basically going nothing. Cult 45 doubt, hard imagine scenario kids room together spread covid.  common sense really deserves lot attention got, alongside low rate hospitalisation rates people vaccines.

For reason subreddit obsessed shitting none RNA vaccines. truly bizarre. incredible achievements fact traditional vaccines heavy lifting worldwide ending pandemic. public ones appear great job preventing death serious coronavirus massive win.

Instead people obsess headline efficacy percentages frankly, really matter much ending pandemic compared speed get people vaccinated globally. immeasurably made easier vaccines available. Eat rich That's fine. allowed that.

But cannot excuse selfish evil, clearly is. way around it. Evil selfish beginning. right thing showed world since beginning selfish, instead surprising people evilness selfishness later.

And EU never implemented ban, like never will. Europeans seem awfully quiet America racking ~1.5m vaccinations day. Anyone know why? According “rules,” nobody supposed gather events Halloween, Thanksgiving, Xmas, New Years. Millions anyway, that’s got CA got. whole “dark winter” series spikes following holidays shit, it’s obvious. Chill mate, know things bad let get head much.  complaining terms Astrazaneca accepted - contractual terms deadlines?

I understand trying say. AZ got greedy bit could chew? rolling review EU since 1 December, come moment. 120 (initial goal) 100 80 (lowered goal) 31 (reality) 40 (reality reality??). Seems right. Rubbish, even exaggerated satire Kennedy Jr Fuck that. like globs Vegemite toast. Today learned 5% McDonald's franchise stores actually run McDonald's directly. Look Belgium's numbers. Lockdowns work extremely well, unfortunately. understand UK placed initial order 30M received notification 500,000 would produced even less notice .. 

Please share source us, commitment deliver 30 million vaccines receive stated problems EU plant mostly solved going forward still stuck past projecting.

Funny problems started solved EU released contract public, suddenly production yields started direct outrage Curevac 'unusual' EU funding despite product delivered

If pharmaceuticals like unsual funding, said stop distracting EU failures procurement playing blame game

Ah I'm shifting blame EU, naive got fucked hard big pharma - simply followed steps vaccine nationalism limit EU production EU - whole ""lead moral example"" keeps lagging EU behind, simply said UK USA - get vaccines nothing moves suspect pharma company ever make non profit deals EU based horrible, childish reaction manafacturing delays delays impacted everyone.

Non profit deals? Basically Astrazaneca got free access vaccine production game, free liability lol, upfront funding EU, still managed fuck trials, like past got lawsuit from. kind drug company good reputation. still stinks given size EU's order. sucks AstraZeneca overpromised regard production capacity delivery schedule months end. Question anyone who's -- get insane body aches? back never hurt badly. **Doubt **

Pharmacist fluvoxamine garbage drug nobody uses (causes lot nausea) less effective SSRIs. I'm going throw make sense probably help pile, like 95% theoretical treatments pan last year also make sense. corporate owned stores, isnt super hopefully franchises follow suit fairly quickly. though Jan 2021 seems even paid yet though 

Over 200 million actually. all, significant funding

So what's initial funding. 300 million talking about, different completely separate and/or lower start contract.

And start contract? signed, vaccines approved, first vaccines delivered. Depends agreed start contract is. Indoors without masks significant time around people == death. That's rule thumb.

EU delayed ages signing negotiating prices floor despite cost, making profit

Proof? contract say anything that. pricing part contract even blackened out, still, it, nothing compare with, know contract price thing disagreed about. Maybe reason signed later completely external. show proof EU delayed signing AZ contract explicitly due negotiations price. 

Also argument 3 months get things ready argument sounds like excuse AZ CEO. UK plants ready end 2020, import Netherlands. supposedly Dutch facility, mostly meant EU supply mostly ready, supplied UK, UK facilities supposedly 3 months prepare Dutch facility 3 months less. 80 million 100 million AZ doses made UK. facility 3 months less prepare supply UK, facilities 3 months extra time prepare fully ready yet. Sounds like argument adding up. are/were remaining 20 million made? pharma company actually delivering promised even so? least Biontech job, unlike AstraZeneca. reports people losing 1 them? US deaths per capita normal relative Western countries northern hemisphere. peer countries (e.g. Belgium, Czech Republic UK) far more. Kentaro Iwata, Japanese infectious disease expert, said state emergency good enough. really want contain covid, need something much stronger like lockdown, according (on tv program saw day). way he’s guy went Diamond Princess told us bad situation ship, YouTube (currently video longer available). huge shoutout Mr Iwata afraid pointing terrible Japanese government doing. He’s hated many Japanese rightists “covid cold” idiots, yet continues criticise Japanese government.  five countries citizens willing properly follow social distancing mask protocols. also top officials willing impose strict lockdowns, temporarily sacrificing economy sake controlling infections.

I believe simple lockdown definite answer - **properly imposed** lockdowns, yes. problem, like good/bad law, enforcement public's willingness comply. definitely nuanced scenario different countries Asian cultures average willing sacrifice personal comforts benefit many.

Korea even lockdown country strictly - made sure tested heck population got everyone wear masks. Since already culture mask-wearing feeling unwell, feel like much departure norm real life could keep going everyone anyway.

When look countries like US, UK, France, Brazil, Germany, India - large numbers people disregarding social distancing, causing lockdown ineffective. end day, public health officials' fault suggesting lockdown, government's fault improperly implementing weakly enforcing lockdown rules. Yep lot pay collaboration two companies. I'm sure Germany secure vaccine.  Vaccine production ramping Pfizer/Moderna boosting production J&amp;J probably get approved weeks. Astra may get approved around March. Around Spring believe supply looking much better. Good. arrest anti-lockdown brigaders sub Genuine question I’ve worried following since last year—- isn’t already causing huge surges here? took around two months UK hit peak. it’s since early December (or even longer think Oct)... hasn’t surge yet it? number true misleading. Thier data clearly shows protection days 7 21 much better day 0 7 52% number day 0 21 Lol “end spring” didn’t sound far away head. Well better strap in... feel anger degree, important remember although there's lot selfish assholes US there's also people living infectious hell despite taking seriously day 1 themselves. Could. Could not.  cut paste ;-) can't hope understand seems that, far initial 300m doses concerned, AstraZeneca pretty good ground arguing required divert vaccine manufactured UK.*

*“And that’s conclusion really … Essentially, clause 5.1 says quite clearly AstraZeneca using best reasonable efforts manufacture initial doses within EU.”*

It seems perhaps end courts Thank thoughtful response.  I'm forcing get vaccine, force get it. Well good news, we’re 1.3 right Would say someone asthma attack dying, people intentionally blocked medics accessing ended killing him? concept.

Or would say thing person asthma attack, person brought medicine rescue, “protestors” physically ripped medicine person’s hands, threw ground destroyed it, watched person asthma die? concept. 

This isn’t simply blocking road trespassing. fact downvoted frightening ... people want go ""back normal"" care many people die. Yep articles like Astrazeneca massively failed? Perhaps. certainly delivering number doses hoped for. ultimate responsibility lies commission. failed secure deal guarantees, instead best reasonable efforts. also wasted 3 months quibbling contract vaccine provided cost. production difficulties whole issue would happening Oct/Nov last year AZ would able start production 3 months earlier. Peoples lives terribly affected rightfully angry. commission scrabbling deflect responsibility blame. Every humane person, even AZ wants much vaccine produced fast possible. AZ producing vaccine EU (and rest world) cost. commission try cast villains hide failure disgusting. Yep corrected it! feel you, lives UK &amp; it’s ages. Hopefully visiting March, goes well. RemindMe! 1 year mean end Spring June 20th. That’s long 5 months...  Well, that’s problem. Indeed, accelerate existing European production line (which takes 3 months start finish) one week, would add millions q1 doses given rapid ramp year. OWS people told us 100mm doses 2020. maybe 40mm. Turned 20mm so. I'm glad bare minimum throwing money multiple companies paying off.

The main issue acting like success thankful told we'd many millions doses ready go upon approval. find behind (both Pfizer J&amp;J) manufacturing almost time start shipping. also found December OWS could bought Pfizer doses decided to. ended getting remedied made public, seemed like head scratcher highest order.

Ive seen literally 11 months now! UK production setup serve domestic needs. Seems quite sensible there.

The bit nationalistic easily debunked detailed earlier post. correct. despite ranting raving personal freedoms actually want others choice. vaccines get approved, faster get doses people sooner with. extra donate poorer countries.

The cost vaccines tiny comparison economic damage done keeping restrictions place longer. mean, past months hardest. Israeli police really likes beat anti government/Bibi protestors every weekend. orthodox jews sit government untouchable. minority control whole country 🤦‍♀️  little interaction (live St. Louis, MO) I’m curious, general mindset super orthodox followers? believe virus real, think masks won’t anything, maybe they’re protected God, etc etc knuckleheads think they’re gonna get it, it’s bad, it’s overreaction. 

Has attempt within community curb behavior? Montenegro's Orthodox Patriarch die COVID recently? Serbian Patriarch went funeral, got COVID, also died? read comments sub understand why. Everyone clammering life get ""back normal"" even though means hundreds thousands people life. 99.99% anything. lie. People go back normal though.  Congrats, must huge relief Yeah worse doing. I've taking pandemic seriously day 1 I'm pissed know morons America probably even believe covid getting vaccine me.  Yeah, state Guard helping covid response entire time. kill lot old people short time, working relative afford funerals. Win-win.  wife approved get vaccine can’t even fucking get it! Sure, ran $2000 checks going door immediately, “hey you’re going get $1400 dollars.” thought too, we’ve already got NG, don’t see I’m at. It’s local healthcare systems administering. J&amp;J come online soon, big boost. hear Fauci saying earlier today every adult US would vaccinated end Spring, sounds like theyre confident supply elsewhere Pzifer / Moderna.  mean 2M day Yeah that's selling seats... fucking expensive fly planes country. burn money fast half seats empty.  Good you. don’t even watch put YouTube It’s honestly god awful things mental health. bunch folks life convinced means pandemic keep going, vaccines nothing. Keep talking me. I’ve spent past couple weeks bed 🤷🏻‍♀️ Novavax product real winner - easy storage benefits, efficacy par mRNA vaccines. 

If commercial national pride considerations didn’t exist, stop development adenovirus vaccines pivot manufacturing capacity producing Novavax vaccine. lots people do. makes public messaging people like Fauci even important prevent anti-vax movement gaining ground great info, thanks!! I’m glad you’re getting chance “normality” (whatever now) back mate! That’s lovely hear nice atmosphere :)

I’m low risk won’t rounds guess summer wife teacher there’s chat around they’ll phase April due amount kids work (1.5k normal times..)

Overall super super stoked see people really need getting - wife’s 94 yr old nana got first dose. days long you’re old can’t see people lockdown Vaccine manufacture bottleneck? Sorry bad mood commented rude. majority state spread group homes, factories, “workplaces” super vague. 100%. Think powerful tool Pfizer Moderna. FDA needs clear quickly. They're exactly amazing Black citizens either tbh It’s went tens thousands vaccinations per day 1.3/1.4 million vaccinations per day. mean that’s problem. Supply won’t sorted summer. We’re getting 8.6M doses week rn, Moderna+Pfizer need deliver 15M week meet Q1 target. Pfizer won’t deliver another 100M doses July... best we’re going vaccinate 2M day count second doses ends 1M people day max next 3 months. we’re pretty fucked summer Trump didn’t secure Pfizer doses Q1... Wish NHS states. certain former Washington, DC resident longer much spotlight covid situation rapidly improving. need something keep people's attention lose money.  Here's breakdown planned rollout: literally identical rUK's rollout, they're set JCVI. well germany made ""pfizer"" vaccine odd even german wait... National Guard enough? reliable detect SARS-Cov2 viral ARN, can't tell virus 'alive' pieces still remaining past infection. Lol love thoughts. good Sunday (or early Monday you’re somewhere side planet). forced. chose get Alaska flight. could flown delta (only major us airline holding middle seats open) driven. news channel existence? googling ‘EU AstraZeneca contract’?

What’s wrong you? Send them! Let’s get pandemic with. still can’t believe spent almost two billion dollars website.

I’ll never understand could cost much even worked perfectly. Woah. Right fake news jugular. Quite leap!

I'm advocating peer-reviewed scientific studies rather recommendations health experts failed. example, ""Center Disease Control"" failed CONTROL DISEASE countries controlled, read expert opinion extreme skepticism defer peer-reviewed study, available.

Here's quote study: ""school closures United States found reduce COVID-19 incidence mortality 60% (ref. 28). result also line contact-tracing study South Korea, identified adolescents aged 10–19 years likely spread virus adults children household settings...""

Why everyone consider alternative experts CDC? Let's take quote February 28, 2020 example: ""CDC recommend routine use respirators outside workplace settings (in community)"" Trump told Bob Woodward knew virus airborne 21 days prior statement. Amen. Mostly spent last year guaranteeing happen taking swipes trump nationalism countries like Canada left Japan raised concerns over export rules requiring manufacturers obtain permission shipping Covid-19 jabs outside EU. South Korea also warned governments grab vaccines need. here. God knows boomers sacrifice shit save planet. talk J&amp;J vaccine getting emergency use authorization soon next week, 2 million doses ready say 100 million doses April. happens completely different ballgame. would something like another 1 million doses per day J&amp;J easy distribute requires one shot. treatment also bring society back normal

How so? Someone treated recovers immune someone vaccinated. AZ vaccine used UK manufactured two facilities Oxfordshire Staffordshire bottled/packed factory Wrexham, distributed throughout UK. part process occurs EU nothing EU disrupt it. 

You may confused also AZ factory Belgium producing vaccine use EU (which one failing produce adequate yield caused EU engage Karen mode), Belgium also Pfizer vaccine manufactured. Really hands deck point.
 
Each day goes die, businesses go under, people go broke, mental illness rises. throw every resource it’s still drop bucket compared overall economic damage done day. US redditors countries, US population 5 times UK. No. fact apart reacting export controls, pleased process. Viable candidates got big chunk money start production left phase 2 testing. guarantees minimum orders months finish phase 3 *phase 3 requirement*. Imagine Sputnik Oxford lasting side effects? happy EU citizens first ones try them. course pity AZ produce much guaranteed, *but way fault EU*. want believe they’ll able 600k day, don’t think - yet anyway. want know J&amp;J vaccine approved available, don’t need worry second doses Well EU agreement Novavax 100 million doses option another 100 million doses. production facilties already way since months ( Pfizer fabric Marburg , start testing september could increse purchase Pfizer/Biontech Januar). 
There final contract signed, likely since american companies willing take responcibilites products , law EU. take long EU sign Pfizer, even already clear facility Marburg would approved, would order even hundert million more). US UK problems since take responsibility themselves.
If would start buildung surply chains Novavax vaccine EU , would way late make difference.
(If everything goes planned, won`t get around 50 % population vaccines Q2 , around 80 % population Q3, included Novavax , Valneva potential Sputnik IV) . targets meet? It’s like fat drunks bar yelling athletes trying hard enough.

Bless sweet hearts. That’s concern (not fear, concern). took early September (when first detected) think November really pop U.K. that’s known months (and knows long seeding definitively found pointed out). Also dropping infections overrun hotspots mask seeding spread that’s ramping quietly others. 

One way another we’ll know couple months. Scotland fair bit behind England moment 10.51% adult population compared 14.66% England. sure catch real explanation lagging moment (Wales NI 12.8% 12.6%)

Interestingly London behind Scotland. London rest English regions England would even higher possibly 16% more. warranty cl. 13.1(e) contractual conflict AZ's obligations anyone else. words, AZ cannot legitimately use obligations (say) UK excuse complying obligations contract. 8/ 

This matches mostly said quoted Clause 8.1 deals Delivery. AZ give notification ""in good time"" much estimates available delivery when. redolent absolute obligation deliver x doses date - consistent AZ's public position. 10/ 

We still see ""in good time"". AZ deliver x doses date already known best reasonable efforts clause. That's true weird ass metric. good news. hope catches businesses. post removed because:

Abe Lincolns comment reply mentioned Manila. ever actually Manila (or extremely dense city poor country) seen looks like people live? want make sure we're page here. think summer/spring, people sure go back living life again. There's way people continue stay inside waste another 8 months. Even covid caused cancer, wouldnt stay inside another 8 months. Corporate government drop restrictions year honestly dont know part end. equivalence EMA FDA requirements. 

You're wrong first sentence. really case, EMA approve vaccine FDA? UK it, publishing unproven data,  vaccine efficacy first dose AstraZeneca vaccine calculated around 70%, high protection severe disease

This misinformation, conspiratorial; anti-vax, even selectively misinformative vaccine. irresponsible. EMA data previously published data either. came different conclusion using different set results. agree. clearly doesn’t see way, don’t know Newsweek would give platform spread disinformation. else weekends? “The suggestion sell countries make money right make profit everywhere. That's approach took agreed that. That’s agreement Oxford University. It's actually even written contract Oxford University: profit. slightly different prices one geographic cost goods may different. supply chain Brazil, another one Latin America, another one South Asia. one Japan. course, know, local costs different. got slight variations, less, three four dollars, less everywhere. It makes difference. Zero difference. 

\- AstraZeneca might also EU efficient logistics, production capacity ready, lower cost goods larger order regions lower price. cost regions. EU probably lower cost made per vaccine produced there.

There reason EU paid less BioNTech vaccine, reason paid Moderna EU financially supported development BioNTech Pfizer vaccine obtained lower price per dose ($14.70 US ($19.50). Moderna vaccine’s development subsidised US government, cost US $15 dose, EU paying $18. EU developed Janssen vaccine profit too: Vaccine Candidate Access Distribution** 
The Company committed bringing affordable COVID-19 vaccine not-for-profit basis emergency pandemic use, pending regulatory EU also paid Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine, expected announce phase III results imminently, also much cheaper, costing EU $8.50, dose going twice far brands, since single shot vaccine. seems like EU paid less profit vaccines. Probably ""costs"" production lower EU. profit vaccines specific reason more/less expensive EU (BNT/MRNA). like appeal expertise, need verified sending mod mail. Thankfully lots Biontech/Pfizer (500M doses) also Moderna (160M doses) way later year. that's enough 330M people. \~380M people living EU, that's enough 87% us (including kids can't get vaccine).

So fine.

We're also receiving lots Johnson&amp;Johnson, lower efficacy maybe people prefer wait bit Biontech vaccine. also CureVac, mRNA ready summer. Normal human interactions **are** dangerous! could get cold. could get flu. could say something angers person, get fight.

But accept danger, always have, life without human social interactions worth living.

Life dangerous; matter do, die eventually. goal live rich life possible time have, stave death forever, impossible. people seem lost sight March 2020. got see needed quarantine stay home work clear since last summer, yet incompetent politicians continue double useless lockdown measures destroy peoples lives failing protect vulnerable 0.5% Viruses evolve subject selection pressures, may cause virus become virulent.

Yes. can. also cause evolve become less virulent. whole reason comment removed implication evolution always drives virus virulent. case. right though, wording could better. saw ""shocking"" footage Rabbi's funeral Israel, wanted react negatively realized Israel almost almost end. Yes, realize they're still lockdown week, still. 

As gatherings grow larger Western countries, I'm going re-adjust seeing normal - welcome change honestly. We'll see, zero trust government (I'm French) deliver vaccine speedy fashion. Obviously supply limited France's bureaucracy might slow things down.

The number people want vaccine mean get faster, practice doubt will. Absolute bullshit. 

The poor need schools because, gasp, they’re ones leave homes everyday put danger keep middle class happy safe home. vaccine requires 2 doses? so, efficacy first 2? thrust concern whether giving false impression people effective immunity, really need get vaccination actually starts help situation directly.

Unsurprisingly, BBC news mention anything tangible expectations one dose vaccine. Instead, get declaration see ""impact"" 2 week. impact may none, we'll see 2 weeks.

Hell, I'm used stuck home really know I'm gonna life reverts back normal. Gonna feel bit lost, hey, gotta get used it

On bright side, grandpa got first shot!!! Still waiting tho grateful non-profit aspect, AstraZeneca's communication lacking, particularly came production delays faced. mean looking news 95% 7 days ago dat tongue do?

If good scientific evidence teachers getting infected \*than comparable adults rest society\* (That, is: adults working people retail workers, etc) means keep schools closed vaccinate teachers early.

But data shows opposite - teachers \*not\* infected higher rate comparable adults, ffs open schools.

I seen one reliable report reported former (no higher rate infection). seen data US however, know data always compare would best use ""local"" data. “A little better” huge understatement. -USA mean everywhere else barely find vaccines. It’s 16 317 infected. 715K wouldn’t infected even hadn’t gotten vaccine didn’t come contact virus. So, know, makes sense. Ah, thank you! delay around 2-3 weeks new AZ shipment schedule. clearly care. :) Enjoy!  would consider unlucky concerning. seen anecdotal cases younger people becoming seriously ill/dying take away individuality (I know, hard compassionate human) statistics still show vast majority deaths 75+ group, 40 still low risk death. stories reported unique, numerous, make's newsworthy.

This isnt say careful nothing fear, need remember perception skewed choose report on. goal stay safe now, wear mask (or two) get vaccine moment available you. Here’s re-write: It’s beginning end It’s nice want things isn’t lol understand loved one dying corona would terrible thing. understand everyone 20-40 years old. wear mask try stop spread. wear mask 100% time. understand young people spread vulnerable people. 

But really admit isn’t news? 
It’s trying scare clicking. 

There hidden “brutal truth”. Young people aren’t dying corona. Period. title lie. “brutal truth”. 

In Uk, average age death corona 80 years old. 0.64% deaths ages 20-40. 0.64% deaths isn’t lot. It’s 300 people. includes 20-40 year olds pre existing conditions. 300 people. 

It’s obviously horrible died, it’s lot people. “brutal truth” like article claims. 

Again, wear mask 100% time believe science. understand young people spread old people. I’m anti masker. never said “no one dies”. said article BS

But, really admit article title lie? doesn’t work like that. That’s arguments right now. 

EU paid $2.15 

UK paid $3 

USA paid $4

Per vaccine. breaking"", euphemism ""dishonest""

There two types rule breaking ""the criminal"" &amp; ""live free"" ""Live free"" areas lower crime rates average. unfair claim euphemisms thing. How? Israel vaccinated nearly 1/3 population little month. don’t think Orthodox Jews practicing religion end world. Apparently bot thought uncivil 😂. Anyways, it’s fear mongering CNN CNN sucks.  Well good thing that's did.

He also explained point dismissed.

And, yes, realize provide sources, neither you. I'm glad comfortable downvoted appreciate candor.

At time, we're talking borderline scientific miracles here. much so, chunks world population scared vaccines *because* they've taken little time developed.

So say, now, year grinding teeth (and watching news report news report ""shattering previous record daily deaths / hospitalizations""), think really want *this* particular amazing vaccine, rather *that other* amazing vaccine...smacks ingratitude. 

We're incredibly lucky stage vaccines available, far tell J&amp;J one keeps go hospital cases.

I'm sorry feel comfortable I'm glad vaccine available appreciate it. FDA waiting results American trials. 

The US order Oxford vaccines retracted.  Same, 25 I’m probably likely see inside box normal summer living Ontario communicatting 60-70% reduction deliveries 2 weeks commence hard see incompetence lies.

Sure, best effort fail (and dont blaim much that) - hiding it, updating risk picture, thats sin.

Biontech transparent eventhough also slow deliveries. article peer-reviewed Dec 31st. look, right hand side title.

The FDA approved Dec 11th. data working used basis approval peer-reviewed point approval. devalue work regulators. one who's devaluing work. competitive quality price likely sell more. Unlike mRNA vaccines CureVac's require nearly cold storage, easing logistics massively. Japan terrible exactly? one lowest death rates world. Sure, things could go/be better, ""disaster"" really? bother watch video? UK plans donate millions doses developing world, giving away IP UK-created vaccine ensuring sold cost every nation. UK may supply Ireland soon vaccine needs. 

The UK extremely moral philanthropic approach

I really understand misinformation abounds, especially Europeans, subject. I’m group 6 haven’t heard anything getting vaccine yet :( Yeah I'm 20s what's classed mild asthma I'm officially classed vulnerable. brown blue inhalers. blue inhalers usually go date they're empty! need them, really need them. cycle 10-20 miles day I'm completely unfit. get cough sort, get wheezy struggle walk one flight stairs! really want catch COVID. Sucks “experts” factor in...  waiting commenter says:

Yeah long Covid, enough. ya know, neighboring country right thing do? [Here really great video simulation microdroplets lingering remained stable within defined specifications least three months stored standard refrigerator temperature +5°C (+41°F) 24 hours ready-to-use vaccine stored room temperature.

If vaccine works game changer. Well short term, yeah. takes weeks vaccine become fully effective. since it’s possible still carry spread virus vaccinated, it’s important continue prevent spread people vaccinated. thinking 2 years paid $0. fair though, 162 million 13.9 billion 1.2% - really close 0.

I googled like u/PM-Nice-Thoughts said mRNA technology mutations found within hours changes vaccine/therapeutics quickly made. 

One problem identifying mutations first place, first batch patients may rough ride. it’s altering vaccine distributing (and/or perhaps booster) throughout world. try actually replying discussion like adult rather making quips first place? real life too?

Right, trying get at. seems like wrongly interpreted comment negative value judgment instead general comment, bad. 

Anyway, initially commented interested reading it. Seems like googling do, cheers. No. caught hospital.  possible effective preventing death preventing illness. Even completely stop infection, trigger immune response reduces seriousness infection. think 100%? No, think end result. think possible 99.5% preventing infection results death versus 95% overall efficacy? Sure. Yikes. chance compromising regulatory approval anywhere? It’s global pandemic countries capability producing vaccine moral obligation help can’t. far UK US acting like that. Pfizer approved published data peer-reviewed study. mean data used unproven. 

I think people see misinformation spreading sowing mistrust vaccine approved EMA MHRA. 

To say EMA bows political pressure approve something reckless aligning anti-vaccination movement.

Unacceptable. Except that, written article, every change, events happened trial, signaled patients. indicating following clinical trials regulation ethics. totally understand lockdowns destroyed lives deny currently much harm good. make valid points nothing protect population - however, disagree saying early lockdowns would effective.

Obviously hindsight 20/20, consider incubation period two weeks prior development symptoms fact many countries implementing temperature checks screening method, obvious lockdowns going fail. That's cited Korea proper protocols - lockdown merely stop mass outbreak, control everything went back 'normal' social distancing masks everywhere.

There case Korea large cluster people contracted COVID Starbucks - people close contact tested negative employees always masks on. brings recent study NFL transmission COVID - found proximity time exposure less determining factors opposed use masks. I'll link it: point - lockdowns seen means keep virus control gearing 'new normal' worked towards vaccine. Indefinite lockdowns considered all. proper lockdowns social distancing + mask protocol performed observed March, virus would widespread new mutations tow. 

Oh Black Friday purchase made late November, **wasn't** lockdown anymore. I'm complaining people acted lockdowns **I** stocked two weeks worth food,did order anything non-essential stayed inside month long lockdown.

I'll finish - think *lengthy* lockdowns needed anymore. wish properly implemented early months could months suffering instead 2020 suck. don’t to. job others stop make see multiple viewpoints. Instead let one note experts rule. also read interview May 2020 said vaccine end year unrealistic. miraculous, I’ll give that. goes show isn’t prophet. worry when/if wave comes. There're people poor still qualify medicaid. New cases massively trending downward US. sad thing shouldn’t left businesses. required cover Marburg means really nothing, vaccine exported literally anywhere.

People love say ""we've pandemics before"". literally shut world those. plan vaccines work? locked forever? claim selfish say this. agree, always stress fact expect new data AstraZeneca soon US, expect show efficacy 65+ age groups. clearly lack data, probably/hopefully lack efficacy. Even though Biontech/Pfizer, Moderna, Novavax J&amp;J apparently better efficacy, AstraZeneca still good vaccine good preventing severe illness death. Eh evens out. OK January deaths reported February, likewise December casualties January. Statistically, 150 people would died 75000.

Idk meniscus fits I'm still excited. 😂 right knee FUBAR even 3 surgeries. need dis. issue 95% effective (e.g., Moderna/Pfizer), expected number deaths based efficacy alone would .5 - basically 0-1. statistically significant say prevents death rates similar headline efficacy, sufficient say prevents death headline efficacy (e.g. 99% reduction death instead 95% reduction death). 

We'll see final JnJ results show, one bigger ""efficacy window"" (since headline figure 60-70%) prove it. would expect vaccine reduce death/hospitalization headline efficacy (most vaccines - including flu, 2X effective reducing hospitalization symptoms) data support it.

Please answer: rich countries get vaccine makes EU's approach moral? honest, really think accurately reporting COVID deaths country. 

I used work Funeral Industry, still contacts check news sector time time. 

It's shocking seemingly, Heart Attacks cancer related deaths practically decreased night everyone dying COVID. 

Plus ""Flu Season"" moment poorly elderly people die huge numbers, think taken account well reported. elderly sick, January March likely months die country. often booked funerals much time year either turn people away outsource. 

I would personally like analyse numbers years, especially excess deaths, see population elderly sick. I'd willing bet we've also hit hard overall age demographics. think end, numbers well line par lot countries (I think we'll mid table personally).  Pritchard, spokesman Oxford, told Reuters: “The half-dose group unplanned, know advance discrepancy dose measurements discussed regulators dosing dosing revised.” Yeah mean seriousness couldn’t Global governmental campaign send dozen seeds Best suited climate everyone?

I’m telling fuck die it’s forum rules, wasn’t, that’s exactly I’d saying. WTF headline lol selected one, 

Any country obviously favour factories. long term economic reasons. immediate tax benefits.

e.g. spend £1 million UK factory exchequer gets £400,000 back taxes. spend next month vaccine. Spend abroad, nothing comes back taxes.   Pretty much this, sucks, countries donated lot money get vaccines developed. US alone spent 9bil fund vaccines. Media: “Why worst still yet come” also write book response stands profit people's obsession COVID over-the-top restrictions? fades away months, book becomes irrelevant. Sooo, can’t find story CNN’s Twitter. Must reaction negative? made mistake gave partial dose. hurt nothing gained informing them, knowledge gained wait. Intentional vs accidental make world difference. purposeful, I'd agree you. need looking like Spongebob trying get Pizza guys house shots. /s comparison would around 1.9M Pfizer Moderna.

""It,"" though, changed, ""it"" originally referred 2M doses, Pfizer Moderna would 950k ""immune."" Yes, people shrugging risking get infected results infections even bigger problem summer.  


So argument? People even care winter chances spreading increased. fact people get infected winter known given already surrounded fuel maybe play match sticks addition given situation. No,the reason schools reopening parents want open, parents vote.

Why earth, pandemic tail end, looking opening schools? wait, waited year, what's 2 months more? Truer words never spoken. didn’t need like this. really clear 2M figure means exactly.

It's footnote GAO report. spokesperson go detail.

I think fair read 2M entire month February, could currently 2M sitting warehouse reading shipped today. Well that’s better last time “helped” fuhr mean public! probably binary ""prevent transmission yes/no"" vaccine.

What know single dose J&amp;J prevents sickness \~72% US cases recent variants (with unknown percentage asymptomatic cases could possibly transmit) two doses mRNA vaccines prevent sickness \~94% US cases variants months ago (with unknown percentage asymptomatic cases could possibly transmit).

Still, despite knowing exactly much transmission occurs vaccinated people, seems pretty likely significantly beat waiting get vaccinated, J&amp;J going increase supply sooner.

Also note apples apples comparison anyway. also possible new data show two doses mRNA vaccines recent variants pretty comparable two doses J&amp;J recent variants. Pfizer uses rna, breaks easily, needs special storage. There’s also compounds need stabilize rna help encourage cell take newer vaccine game. it‘s actually really cool since rna temporary, turn cells temporary machines chug viral proteins train immune system, mRNA disappears, need second shot. “it’s new” hasn’t used released vaccine before, journalists covering even minor allergies major event, terrifying people avoiding fairly safe vaccine. New = unknown = fear-based reporting click bait.

astrazeneca something similar, inserts dna cell. DNA less delicate rna takes less fanciness keep stable, dna lasts cell don’t need booster shot it’ll help cells keep chugging “training” viral proteins teach immune system, though permanently alter cells relatively harmless way. rna vaccines don’t permanently alter cells. However people aren’t freaking dna tech since it’s similar tech Ebola vaccine used without issue years ago.

this novavax uses similar tech established hpv vaccine, uses protein it’s dumping pre-made viral protein body train it. protein far stable either rna dna, that’s huge advantage storage. kinda it’s kinda like pfizer stuff injected temporary doesn’t alter cells permanently, you’ll need booster. tech around decade protein doesn’t need kept super cold, feels familiar people afraid new. mean we’re talking world explain 5G doesn’t cause covid. Bureaucracy? Come on!

Von der Leyen, Chief EU Commission, precisely “effective” working Ministry Defense Germany. good friend Merkel generally nice woman. cares unable serious job? Either EU finds method fire managers ASAP, EU disbanded. fact. even supposed mean? producers selling at-cost. IP means nothing don’t capability produce? February predictions:

Vaccination rates continue ramp up. end month, 2 million day rolling average (at least).

Deaths begin plummet along hospitalizations cases. might “plummet” super hard definitely consistently going down.

J&amp;J gets approval begin distribution last days feb. agree. China messed big time. Salary based supply demand people job, importance job itself. There’s way people qualified teachers people hit 95 mph fastball consistency Sounds pretty anecdotal.  


But let's assume old people party case one spreader brings group old people got somewhere even unlikely received someone asymptomatic. Also people bring virus retirement homes (where old people die once) likely old people already retirement home. young careless people risk bringing homes. That’s Journalism 101 now. Find quote paints bleakest picture. Every clinical trial follow stringent patterns. know, could obvious errors. ""neutral"" people, check every step protocols much more. clinical trial mess certain institutions / must act clarify it, else bad habits become new norm. sound like authors trying measure male fertility claiming make conclusions whether  damage male reproductive system one reported outcomes viral infection. Current studies documented SARS-CoV-2, causes COVID-19, damage male reproductive system large part inflammatory damage caused cytokine storm. However, whether SARS-CoV-2 infect human testis directly enter semen controversial. adverse effects SARS-CoV-2 male reproduction also concern require comprehensive evaluation. Here, analyze invasiveness SARS-CoV-2 testis examine reported mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 interferes male reproduction. Long-term implications SARS-CoV-2 infection male reproduction also discussed. **It emphasized although COVID-19 may induce testicular damage, substantial decrease male reproductive capacity awaits clinical evidence. propose urgent need track male COVID-19 patients recovery.** development suitable experimental models, including human reproductive organoids, valuable investigate viral impact reproduction current future pandemics.

Which brings question, pandemics going since March large numbers. large number papers speculating ways viruses cause fertility issues providing evidence testicular tissues changes (often autopsies deceased patients) I've seen little studying actual effects fertility despite fact number couples must tried conceive since March. somebody studied whether measurable increases difficulties conceiving. Live also normal United States governors aren’t playing dictator except don’t worry throw house arrest every month. Weird numbers UK show teachers 300%+ likely get COVID professions. guess they're getting teachers certainly students reason outside science cannot spread COVID He’s one advisor task force 10+ people. I’m annoyed well remember it’s like he’s calling shots anything.  increase infections deaths predicted year experts winter, people would gathering inside. Yeah know franchaises work makes sense. Even UK need vaccine. factory needs guaranteed cashflow ramp production. faster vaccines produced, sooner world gets covid19 control. Honeslty don’t think say definitively won’t help, don’t know, say won’t, we’ll Delorean? Cuz don’t. germ warfare game called ""dark winter"" pretty much dead on.   rich countries get vaccine makes EU's approach moral? UK's approach (IP, at-cost) immoral?

Sanofi? there's 5 others almost doubled order one (pfizer) January compensate. second contract pfizer start delivery april, running concurrently first contract after. course is, expect be. point is, yet data make claim, headlines like harmful. 

99.5% efficacy preventing death 95% efficacy probably aiming high. 97-98% may reasonable based experience vaccines (2-3X greater reduction serious illness symptomatic illness). 99.5% high claim yet statistical evidence support this. Thank you, kind ma'am/sir reading article lazy click. LOL got excited hopeful. I'm ""too young"" knee replacement can't make knee functional present. Oh able walk stairs like normal person again... Yes! benefit professionals negotiate contracts! surprising, Spanish flu also led massive innovations science medicine! pandemic terrible may helped humanity well!

Even turn somewhat less effective, current problem world ineffective vaccines enough vaccinated people all. 
And high number infected people means high number mutations. sick get mean better immune response? Maybe body makes antibodies?

I seen evidence this. believe holds true vaccine. P/B vaccine developed Germany (using public funds ) german company EU produced company currently used Israel Canada soon South Korea Japan. Long doses EU delivered. Well uplifting. guess CNN needed Trump all. Pfizer agreements many countries world. us, EU, schedule accelerated big win. rest world, vaccines available, sooner, also big win. global war, everyone safe. anyone saying “we’ll fine months”? Everyone know said lockdowns work lockdowns lifted. never going completely eradicated lockdowns. never even point begin with. Young healthy people shrugging virus harmless literally big contributor increase infections deaths.  


How bad way shrug off? Yes, pressing priority middle novel pandemic control outbreak, conduct full scale investigation source. admit nothing satisfy you’ve made mind already.

u/inbredgangsta 

Its zero-sum game all. cannot possibly **this** disingenuous. possible both, since people working control outbreak investigating it. Deaths going lag long time. Deaths reported specific day include weeks even months prior. Yes, 5 days enough time things happen.

Are 5 days without lockdown able bring back dead loved one? fatality rate seems like small percentage hits family. Didn’t breach rules. asking ""if already patient specific doctor, would need schedule appointment / second dose vaccine""?

Or asking ""if already sick, would need vaccine""?

Just wondering. feel like numbers change every day. hard keep track. Good news - companies expanding production capability. symptoms, like loss taste? Truly exciting times right? That's article said. I'm quite sure pulled number from. article specifically said 75k Americans, pull US per capita death toll, get 1366 deaths per 1M. Convert 75,000 get 103 deaths. that's 50%.

Maybe put excess deaths in, too. would pop number good bit, good source that.

But numbers apples oranges anyways.

The studies start March 3rd. missed first big wave deaths. Two (Moderna Pfizer) reported data mid November, they're missing second wave deaths.

Above posters say 10 deaths among placebo groups. That's number compare against. (assuming accurate) 150 people article. mean...they jobs via distance learning. Black people account disproportionate number COVID cases US too. logic “the problem”? realize often times secondary reasons certain communities likely infected right? People saying summer, sure it’s true it’s certainly sooner expected. They’re already getting paid. also pay them? 10 million day 300 million month. Novax, Oxford, Covaxin alone enough meet that. Add top Zydus’ vaccine, Biological E’s, Tata’s partner Moderna, India easily produce 400-500 million vaccines month.  We're 7.6% far off. double shots make confusing since we're closer 9.5 vaccinations per 100 people, measuring individuals. Still, think hit 10% individuals vaccinated within next week two. Remember voting booth. describe theoretical mechanism action would result negative non-acute health effects JnJ's vaccine vector? 

Is ingredient vaccine? proposing misunderstanding science around adenovirus enters cells generates spike protein? hypothesize alters DNA (it doesn't)? believe immune response somehow cause permanent auto-immune issues despite fact cellular execution pathway identical body faces every day millions viruses runs daily? 

If want propose long-term side effects vaccine month window since safety testing started last Spring), need able describe course action. burden proof impossibly large inherently testable - therefore, science. What's right window? What's right sample size? 2 years road evidence issue.. say that's enough, data, need wait 10 years? 

In terms ""knowing better everyone else"" - that's case. claim expert. know what? hundreds immunologists experts believe vaccine safe (further supported soon released Phase 3 trial data). trust random joe internet laying unsubstantiated FUD testable hypothesis. people vaccinated means less people spread COVID, means less people produce COVID variants. new COVID variants already, vaccines look somewhat effective them. That’s better nothing. underlying health conditions have, lifestyle like? Articles like toxic. Shame reporter. know dozen people gotten doses, they're totally fine. American, would like US pass universal healthcare too. Well, important week, imo, said we'd see noticeable drop week.

It’s one smaller reasons, EU signed worser deal (although cheaper) due taking longer wanting delivery dates UK taking time investment build infrastructure. feel need mention WV's status ""very conservative"" ""Trump-y"" state success distributing vaccine obviously nothing that? UK first agreed purchase Pfizer vaccine July. EU months later November. took long commit purchase vaccine? commitment (and money) UK July meant Pfizer could start scaling production Europe months earlier EU commission sole customer. imagine awful situation scenario Pfizer enough time get teething trouble way Astrazeneca EU factories. UK could insisted Pfizer produced order there, months later November EU would start scratch building production.

The article link interesting. Though cites number instances France EU countries restricted exports medicines personal protective equipment. certainly support UK government same.

I happy UK getting Biontech vaccine. also thankful grateful Germany developing it. UKs getting much needs hoped for, I'm throwing Karen threatening destabilise peace agreement it. 

Being first line mean others fair access. UK stop delay EU commission agreeing Astrazeneca Pfizer contracts. EU front queue vaccine. sound angry frustrated, be. people Europe angry commission deserve better. Delays consequences, vital months sadly going cost lives. commission trying deflect blame. managed unite almost every party northern Ireland (perhaps first time ever) condemning commissions actions.

I'm saying UK whiter white, certainly unfair cast villain. commission needs take responsibility badly mishandling situation. Perhaps critical history. No, would not. Filling vials one bottlenecks product ion line. vial, increase throughout some, 50% (there still bottlenecks, 50% per vial increase filling speed 50% - setting up, measure, move, etc also takes time). read 100m **by June**. probably depends live. places good it, lot also aren't.

Call good news want, fact objectively complete disaster. thats 2 years missed school looking at? 

gotta get kids back there. Put teachers hazmat suits whatever. US well work vaccine rollout, better Europe. averaging million day. Depends much risk wanna take. It’s still airborne you’re indoors. there’s many people it’s spreading super bad area, might okay. ate restaurants handful times stuff airborne exposure became known fine. personally wouldn’t right I’m fully vaccinated. Oh good I’ll tell friends.. get once, thanks concern. UK 100,000 coronavirus deaths. article suggests lockdown result meany deaths virus. Also, people die lockdown often young healthy, many years ahead them, whereas people die virus already old sick. problem people, pro-lockdowners anti-lockdowners, acting like solution lockdown issues eliminate restrictions. 

Some level social distancing proven help COVID, needs done *efficiently*. understand UK can't copy successful countries done, instead, keep doubling mistakes. Yeah thoughts guess short duration (weeks) makes risk acceptable compared many die virus. Nice. Wait til $ 15 minimum wage hike comes round...we’ll see charitable start laying employees cant afford pay anymore. Lol meanwhile walgreens got flu shot year box siting counter. Probs shoulda walked right outta saw KEEP REFRIDGERATED box fridge🤦🏼‍♀️ Literally every human brain urges things, acting like you’re special laughably dumb Whats odd dont want consider true, evidence growing.

Shit dont want live like anymore, stuck Pandemia...

But look whats going here...Positivity may help carry face reality: finally got vaccine one strain covid. may deal new vaccines others coming around.and shitting plans. Yes fact many countries EU could done much better quicker vaccine procurement, infrastructure building administration EU. asked sure. Yeah, J&amp;J pointless US. speeds program like 2 weeks. certainly would rather wait 2 weeks take vaccine gives 8x high chance getting COVID mRNA vaccines. That’s great point.  3000 variants ruling, nothing stop 9000 20000 maybe problem, resistance agressive one like coronaebola. yes, fucking problem give dont even try stop infection rate. equally, would largest steer response.

Another whole year school flushed toilet fraud remote learning half-assed hybrid beyond ridiculous. accurate, fact affected Brexit would right anyway. developed medical research infrastructure Europe, former home EU medicines agency MHRA often taking independent approach past, really prove anything saying.

Not without serious infection death. would resolved even nothing. would burned eventually anyhow, significantly deaths severe illness.

Any facts I've read vaccines (especially mRNA) provide much higher better response fighting virus natural infection. government makes possibly legal implement. Private companies room work around mandates. yet vaccines effective COVID variants current flu vaccines serious person thinks lock virus gone forever. obviously need bare minimum test/trace/isolate border controls. misrepresenting person's argument claiming position made causing much damage. Nah man. Totally protecting bottom line folks. Driving right US. set whatever preconditions want. main issue they're issued states, federal gov't, means adoption would sporadic. could tie real ID requirements though. military mandatory 14 day wait first second dose (followed 25 day wait second dose immunizations). 

Which means Japan mandates getting vaccine prior traveling start vaccinations approximately 40 days prior travel date PCS months. mandate shortly leave could hold month. live Netherlands, government makes wonder charged high treason face death penalty.  know license would legal U.S. (private transportation different public). Plus it'll couple years could realistically talk mandates. Yeah, right!

Children, like adults, COVID-19 symptoms (“asymptomatic”) still spread virus others""

So straw man argument context. think misunderstanding somehow binary choice: either children can't spread schools ""safe"", children *can* spread disease, schools must ""not safe"". 

In case schools - course- ""not safe"". zero spread children. *that question anyone attempting answer* unless desire ""zero covid"" - isn't, places.

The questions need answers are: children *so infectious* a) *significant* driver spread society b) spread schools posing *significant* risk health teachers. relevant science science answer questions. personal reading-between-the-lines boosters they’re working case, necessarily release unless current variants turn problem seem they’ll be, maybe something released future mass distributions current vaccines largely done. 

Also sort practice road variants evasive 6 months, year, two years, whatever.

That’s take anyway. Yup, wife ER doc. first shot fine, second shot slept entire next day. TV equivalent selling clicks. thread full comments guy he's after. Forget facts things says affect people. attention whore. Whether done different question whether would work.

If vaccine prereq getting license, it'll absolutely work. People get vaccinated there's lot alternatives comes transportation around US. demand management. Europe much vaccine sent messages like reduce demand get doses quicker. Uptake UK exceptionally high issues raised. clear vaccine works adult age groups. like optimism, unfortunately that's case. multiple family members friends 100% bought doom narrative 2021 already lost cause cause variants. sucks. Jesus truth. even thought throughout whole mess. Buncha hypocrites. exactly could plan companies delivering promised deliveries?

Even Astra Zeneca delivered promised, they'd still lagging well behind. 

Or tie blame shifting disgusting. 

But answering question - could wormed closely vaccine producers get facilties ready work. 

This challenge required chequebook. Probably pretty large percentage relative prevalence region. Even vaccine highly effective SA strain would still expect failures strain original COVID almost completely eradicated vaccine. Woof, looked infection rate starting peak. means death rates peak couple weeks. Feb may worse January simply wave reach half-way point fully January. Curious people getting mixed shots (Pfizer first, Moderna second) may contribute new mutations well.  Feel free repost comment without incivility though! school safe. Exactly. Thru glass too? Come on. say stuff like this? enjoying seeing businesses close children suffering? I’d tell shut up. bad?

Come on. There’s spectrum two far worse aforementioned.

Using facts spin far different pure entertainment based “news.” mean, guy said needed 500 million Ebola vaccines, take will.

Also, considering we're getting briefings every day COVID task force, I'm sure anyone bothering listen Osterholm. wonder masks become accepted thing going forward - people colds wear public due social pressure.

We them, know wear them. excuse hacking coughing spewing germs public.

Has anyone looked social pressure masking Spanish flu? long lasted? Genuinely wondering though something worry about? data doesn’t seem clear long COVID prevented vaccines. keep schools closed next 2 years? I’m sorry you’re misinformed,but good news you’ll get change mind. Especially future.  ""mask free, packed...by May""

No way Jose. know sub wants everything back normal ASAP P means possible. Even optimistic outlook, June barley barely barely minimum start normalcy. that's really good optimistic outlook, y'all starting get crazy unreasonable.

You hopefully get masked, distanced, person graduation. That's hard truth, delusion. get vaccine? elderly mother qualify, told can't get yet. see story story people getting them. confused. mom said doesn’t want take COVID 19 vaccine also doesn’t want give siblings vaccine. says vaccine “killed almost everyone took it”. unusual antivax person, I’ve heard talking antivax people stupid stuff. So, want ask cases people dying COVID vaccines. (I personally think that’s BS vaccine safe) 

Thanks :D Anti-vaxxers seem wrapped fictional realities bother looking statistics understanding causation. reconstruct virus leave bits find happens do, increases understanding virus works could help finding approaches protect people aid recovery process calling someone called article fearmongering pro-virus person he's pro-virus person. article indeed fearmonger article. think need stop taking disagreements downvotes personally emotions showing.

And record read everything comment chain lol maybe reread entire convo started seem heated remember. pandemic started, said can't hug families. Studies coming safely hug family members work even covid floor long practice wearing mask hand hygiene. feels like going emotions actual research/fact misspeak misreported??? 1 15 prevented admitting hospital great. supposed 1 15 admitted hospital??? fantastic news. curious see also prevent long term organ damage.

Finally, acknowledge significant demographic difference, brought up.

Instead comparing developed western nation third world country, comparing differences developed nations? Tell me, age mortality compare western nations/areas strict lockdowns without?

Or choose make comparison fit narrative? People vote feet. 

If Texas, Arizona, Florida, etc. wide open states like California, Michigan, New York, Illinois still restrictions far summer people travel ""open states"" spend money time. ""closed states"" see residents spending money states, they'll open quickly. Science Media Center? Yeah would statistically died within +/- 3 years anyway

I guess decades economic damage, eroding trust important systems, deaths economic strife political division worth virtue signal you

Sacrificing future past. 

You’re insane clearly publish get data from. data sourced local councils. Many refused supply data though.

The government fuller study found teachers positive rates professions. However, included teachers home sick COVID. give indication much higher teacher rates are. There’s recommendation prosecution accepted part plea deal. judge still need finalise/concur deal. hasn’t received much custodial sentence.  Portugal favorite US state. hide basement then. Maybe read said response shooting virtual mouth off? But, confusion noted. number shots known. pandemic, they'll probably able back-calculate true number infections based hit herd immunity. J&amp;J going apply EUA today? Chomping bit see one approved! Yes, haven’t ever heard collective action? enough parents want normal school (assuming teachers access vaccines), paranoia irrelevant. live surrounded viruses. vaccines drive covid nuisance illness vast majority people every age group, more.

The new Covid-19 cases Hanoi detected Linh, Nam Tu Liem Dong Anh districts.

Binh Duong recorded second patient, ""Patient 1843"", 19-year-old female. came close contact ""patient 1644"".

Earlier Monday, Hospital Tropical Diseases Ho Chi Minh City announced ""patient 1660"" Hai Duong contracted U.K. Covid-19 variant, considered 70 percent contagious previous strains, possiblly caused huge surge cases northern province.

I know state almost half cases predicted us week, good start proving wrong What’s percentage people never convinced?

Do think anti-Vaxxer movement motivated identifying people easy fool convince? Similar way scammers send obviously fake emails knowing extremely naive people answer, easy targets. anti-Vaxx another way build power base people believe whatever told?

Would better giving much publicity anti-vaxxers? get much coverage disproportionate impact? media constantly writing risk anti-vaxx sentiment give movement authenticity? must living rock lol should, early neutralization virus mean survives many, many fewer generations patient diminishes chance mutation, too, virus replicate far less.

We care human coronaviruses, yet could mutate escape immune system become severe basis vaccine-mitigated Covid.

At stage, mutation remain risk, greatly suppressed R number fact transmission results much less replication mean hopefully take win. government thinks good idea ease measures rn numbers partially dropping less people getting tested, never understand.

It’s easy focus efficacy part - whether get disease form not. front, vaccines still really good. might even see spread virus slowly die vaccines. could make less dangerous flu, that’s still really good. That’s enough get us back normal. That’s acceptable level risk insanely infectious virus (not measles level, still).

What says is: don’t vaccine shop. Take one that’s offered you, they’re good. Let’s get pandemic over, worry getting boosted effective one.

The data I’m really interested seeing - vaccines prevent damage seen even mild cases (namely heart lung damage)? am. lost aunt uncle cancer never given chance fight thanks covid restrictions

I think room robust debate lock downs.

Particularly articles like warp reality. Lucky us ,there’s many people dying Covid-19 wait three four years peer review. Yes, ""might"" important part here. seem like miserable uninformed person. sure I'm wrong, good search terms something? can't find source this. Seems like OP edited original title. 

The study's title ""Evaluating impact COVID-19 male reproduction"". Alaska probably best bet, I'm honest. seem great. point media needs keep people informed aware risks. literally said, ""The media trying scare people, public absolutely still needs aware risks..."" A-fucking-men effectively challenge misinformation amongst anitvaxxers scientific truth, especially ""do belive"" lack trust truth said scientific research?  don’t know you’re American, shamed endlessly— usual— European enough. weren’t draconian managing one city nation size Long Island Europeans. 

Of course, European measures accomplished nothing. media reported increase, almost like never advocated European measures all. strange! Like revisionist history, nothing ever said directly contradicted today’s stories. 

Likewise, still remember Fauci— thrice failed doomsday prophet— testifying Congress didn’t resources track diagnose spread, although somehow still able briefings provide infection diagnosis tallies (*to nearest **integer!***). 

This would seem, least me, contradict itself. 

Every often there’s one reminder stupidity public dangerous threats combined. saying UK's NHS could turn Peru unconstrained outbreak trashed hospitals tsunami covid patients.

The consequences fuck would Unrecoverable Posts like always confuse me.

Just clear, saying lying titles push propaganda GOOD thing?

Do believe propaganda titles shouldn’t combatted? sub become overtaken people acting like irresponsible assholes? admit age groups significantly less risk others without acting virus exist. Whether concerned not, objectively irresponsible go gym go visit grandparents pandemic, contributing community spread (which affects *everyone*, people age group) also putting grandparents' lives risk. also potentially furthering strain already overwhelmed healthcare system potentially passing virus onto others might get much, much sicker would. Haha well fun staying inside rest life then

There literally vaccines rolling right near 100% efficacy. earth makes think concerned COVID equates ""staying inside rest life""? gone unnecessarily 10 months now, really hard bad. Even continue beginning next year, two years entire life ""spending rest life inside"" lol.

People like ones upvoted ashamed themselves, valuing luxuries people's lives trying shame others taking pandemic seriously. reason thinks extreme bluntness people need hear. given traumatic period people, don’t think that’s really helpful. need compassionate tactful speakers deliver information, &amp; multifaceted situation there’s real risk people tuning hear things like “this going hell” (which paraphrasing something actually said) Agreed. It’s crazy they’re saying still need socially distance wear masks even vaccine. People skeptical vaccine sure hell aren’t going take think point? Oof, would postpone shot possible. Day shot horrible me, though ibuprofen mitigate symptoms. I'm actually feeling much better overall today (two days shot) though still feel feverish. Though like others said really varies. Wait Hollup, late take back vaccination? [Good. part Biden’s Covid advisory board Biden’s presidential transition. board dissolved inauguration. Osterholm take new role administration? you’re situation need that, work- locker room ICU ward. seems unlikely actually need them, I'm willing change mind it.

The vaccines still work them, albeit less well. reduce symptoms, think reduce transmission. still spread even that, everyone vaccinated disease/symptoms issue, variants broaden immune response. make future variants less problem. 😂 tired Lol standards low. many articles interview one person works hospital. one associate professor. stressed nurse freaking out. article says ""experts worry"" literally speculating.

But hey, clicks. don’t see people hate masks much. I’m saying wear masks forever large chunk population vaccinated dramatic drop cases masks continue used. Capacity limits business closures first thing go. Masks last restriction lift. People make much bigger deal wearing mask is. It’s bad. current rate we’re looking 200 million people vaccinated mid June. can’t predict future dramatic drop deaths hospitalization cases maybe masks gone early summer suspect take longer imagine given infectious covid people willing wear masks actually start see drastic reduction. think people need honest fact don’t really know wait see. know projections covid wrong, it’s funky virus. wonderful find sanity comment section.

Love, 
Canada Except mild even asymptomatic cases covid causing long term - sometimes quite serious- health problems otherwise healthy people. valid issue completely ignored favor focusing solely hospitalization death.

Those criticize people pointing strengthening incredibly harmful culture rejecting critical analysis information gathering favor simply trusting profit companies leaders potential conflicts interest tell trust. Uh Christmas surge? Lol, going do? Call cops them? least teachers could make essential worker vaccine rollout. true; even complicated mRNA vaccines, drug makers whose vaccine efforts failed changing plants help accelerate manufacturing. French company Sanofi Swiss company Novartis working Pfizer manufacture doses, example.

Correct original post. extremely disappointed Apple Google's contact tracing apps take off. would helped save lives economy. Well, it’s complicated frustrating, EU get 75 million doses Marburg facility.

Check BioNtech said 52.4% 1 dose according bmj. I'm sorry critical think J&amp;J vaccine good idea places mRNA vaccines option. Preventing serious illness well good vaccinated person, still able become infected transmit virus, everyone else around continues borked. Better vaccine appears prevent infection transmission one saves transmitter serious symptoms.

It's still great option places can't meet storage requirements mRNA vaccine, communities unlikely comply double dose timelines (transient peoples, instance). think best option America. space lasers kill covid Israel?   fair, rural Texans almost always drive hundreds miles kind health care. much big scary variant Lucky Moose. Cases lot past week. deaths 3-4 week lag. see drop deaths late February going March.  first two. risk organ brain damage. also mutation vector since can't propagate you. J&amp;j leaky valve pressure. Better blown valve, maybe, solution.  Like mean people get scarring lungs heart tension mild symptoms, asking prevents effects still cause them. ""Freedom me, freedom thee."" Wait Dr Doom saying summer could still better? many hours think someone need work week order afford food, healthcare housing?  Dropping numbers obviously good think numbers looking making everyone cheer 200-150k day, 100k Sunday numbers made us shudder months ago. 

I hope keeps dropping precipitously point hit new baseline time it’s roughly little less double latest spike.  We’ll see looks like dust settles. Wow bad take.. gotta give Canada anything lmao? Make get gud canada. Everyone loves shit us yall aint even got yalls vaccine done lol lying? 9 months WA. Well, let’s piss every good news there. get initial 10 million figure? know Slaoui said, always overly optimistic. think contract says 100 million doses end Q2. So, majority could delivered starting mid-May. Slaoui also indicated March would limited supply well. Rural Texans used driving 100 miles everything though. Boris Conservative party go history Britain biggest mass murderers. Alas fear another 3 years dip shit England vote again. anti-vaxx misinformation get here? isn’t garbage r/conspiracy ripoff. can't believe people care going saving lives agree! scientist gushing getting Moderna Pzifer vaccine. rich celebrities, politicians, athletes get effective vaccine poor minorities given Johnson Johnson one? aren’t buying all. Remember, revoke consent. saving lives. Keep good work  think cases major holiday gatherings over. Supposedly experts saying rise next couple months cuz variants. yeah hopefully vaccinate soon possible especially elderly Excellent job UK! You’re even better per capita across pond.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.*  I'd like see use logic regards elderly dying covid. There's actually huge downside this. Influenza still spreading, far lower numbers we're used to. There's zero chance social distancing masking carry next flu season flu season year, vaccine makers know strain build vaccine for.

We could looking ugly rebound flu season next year mismatched flu vaccine resurgence late spring COVID-19 vaccination makes larger numbers people comfortable gathering (though thankfully year decently matched vaccine high levels vaccination). Yeah, it’s really fun battling people sides things now. antivax new “you’ll take get shut up” crowd don’t give damn healthy people getting “mild” covid stays forever. 

That’s sacrifice they’re willing make...  friend, ID Doc, says wait must, Miss Rona wait you. question I’ve struggling with. sense social media additional communication, institutions struggling figure control communication. past things like radio, television, publishing expensive, gatekeeping relatively easy. anyone communicate anyone else time. 

In sense that’s dangerous allow groups form undergo shifts toward extremism things like escalation commitment psychological effects. Less extreme people leave groups, extreme rhetoric rewarded likes, shares, upvotes, retweets, etc. major social media platforms ways keeping seeing things make uncomfortable. 

Reddit subdivides subreddits, moderated people, bots specific ideas isn’t acceptable content. Facebook allows unfriend, block, hide, hide. It’s algorithm decides drive engagement-- things draw strong emotions like outrage, disgust. Twitter encourages congregate online people believe things believe, share things share. 

Social media companies experimenting different ways slowing disinformation, they’re slow respond usually easy subvert. Governments could regulate social media, represents host problems give us pause. 

Right guess best hope eventually patchwork things done SM companies effective slowing spread misinformation future. follow guidance public health officials then? CDC Chicago department health recommending prompt return person education. It’s amazing quick abandon expert opinion stop “following science” don’t like says. brother-in-law went regular annual physical couple years back, results stress test(walking treadmill), week later quadruple bypass surgery.

he's 55, overweight, smoke, drink lot alcohol, usually pretty active.

it happens. clear cut. take J&amp;J still contract virus still likely lower viral loads zero protection therefore less likely spread virus shot. complicated thing hard math 

Considering J&amp;J prevented hospitalizations deaths 28 days, take should. way deaths July everyone chose wait like you. People constantly citing mild covid talking point also neglecting level immune protection vaccine *still* going help lower chances long-covid knowledge, deaths causally linked major vaccines. people died receiving vaccine, isn’t good reason think linked cause effect. point millions people vaccinated, group large inevitable would die within days, especially given older population. 

There lot misinformation social media especially attempting link various deaths vaccines, however always seems spurious. science based medicine blog done good writeups lot claims. 

I say sure received Pfizer vaccine, died. data initial trials mRNA vaccines data coming Israel promising safety efficacy, fact. 

I initially skeptical mRNA vaccine immunogenicity, data impressive. much check for? reading article tbh I’m pretty sure chick-fil-a currently neither things restaurants. sure would suddenly start vaccine role out.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 95% effective vaccines prevent recipient transmitting virus, ~70% effective vaccine prevents severe illness still allowing transmission, **yes** big deal.  Lmao really? dumbest shit I've read since pandemic started. point trying one other... Ridiculous. EU ban vaccine export everyone vaccinated here. like UK US it.   Thanks, excellent honest answer. Trust question, isn’t it? Even working scientist there’s point evaluating data end trusting scientists reporting data honestly, telling truth. 

People tend trust people see peers, part family community. One best things good model community. Demonstrate willingness vaccinated. guess vaccine selfies thing too? 


Ultimately don’t think ask people trust scientists, companies, governments institutions-- that’s hard sell we’re era lot people’s trust institutions shaken. think focus trust method science. data evaluated, ways examined. learn enough approval process, trials done, helpful conversations safety.    CTU made clear vaccinating teachers good enough get back classrooms included list unions demands. amazing much misinformation teachers union willing spread this. Thanks detailed reply. Hopefully info get people know! think ultimately pretty low. 91.5% children immunized MMR vaccine US, many rest people don’t adequate medical access. similar rest world well. rest, many probably could convinced give right circumstances. lot people make anti-vaccine activism hobby, attend protests, hang around online groups, etc, believe low millions worldwide. 

In fact, we’d vaccinate lot people improving vaccine access medically underserved communities convincing every anti-vaxxer world. said need strong pro-vaccine voices right eventually we’ll hit point vaccines people want them. point don’t want voice available misinformation.  Politicians closing schools science means nothing. Politicians wrong nearly every measure, guilty deaths susceptible suffering young healthy. understand use ever tool disposal stop pandemic, I'm tired lied manipulated.

Is effective preventing long term effects get COVID, like lung damage inflammatory disease?

Can take effective vaccine available J&amp;J vaccine?

How many politicians health care providers line take J&amp;J vaccine instead Pfizer Moderna?

Is vaccine going pushed rural areas health care already poor scarce suffer long term problems taking vaccine harder time getting help problems? I'm also perplexed top scientists say need 2-3M daily doses. always trusted input, know higher/faster better, end, supply issue. read, contracts quarterly delivery. think mention firm monthly quota. Meanwhile, 65% schools nationwide open person teaching interesting see long teachers unions major cities fight keep distance learning kids school. Hi,

I wanted know think vaccine, specifically Oxford/Astrazeneca vaccine.

Can anyone inform UK medicines regulator would approve vaccine two full doses, even though trial half full dose proved effective? Surely regulator relies almost entirely company provided data would choose dosing proved effective, even though result appears... puzzling say least seeing less vaccine provided protection. me, almost feels like vaccine approved without even trusting data provided Astrazeneca? Thanks advance thoughts! don’t go way start conversations strangers it. think title book might bit inadvertently confusing. People assume it’s how-to guide deconverting anti-vaxxers, saw guide understanding historic roots movement, now, believe believe. editor chose title. 

That said, think effective kind conversation wait bring up, ask 
“Why believe that?” Try redirect two way conversation get lay *why*, *what* believe, also share *why* believe believe. People won’t always receptive that, that’s okay. can’t change someone else’s mind them-- make safe-- socially intellectually-- reconsider beliefs. 

Cognitive biases make easy people adopt beliefs hard give up, especially giving beliefs would also mean giving friendships social support networks. think it’s helpful make clear you’re willing remain part social support network ever change mind, make clear you’re willing discuss them. Remember months ago ridiculous trick treating costume? told use October trick treating dangerous, telling us kids schools 8 hours safe. 3 new highly contagious variants spreading.

Have considered lying Halloween dangerous? anti-vaxxer started harassing work email, started calling department chair, sending screenshots personal facebook page attempt get fired. 

I sent information chair harassment campaigns leveled vaccine advocates (sometimes contacting university boards directors false claims etc) ended called really silly meeting assistant dean. 

I’ve gotten death threats, implied death threats, there’s woman claims voodoo used kill me. However far voodoo hasn’t worked. would like tell us one ever asks about? That’s bs, governments across world aren’t taking everything away people blink eye. Good advice, made mom same. didn’t get it, going try goes second. GriM nEw MiLeStOnE!!!

I swear, quarter every time I've heard seen print media since last March, could fund Covid relief bill Congress. like got memo told use phrase. imo surge seasonal impact already knew would happen two spikes Thanksgiving Christmas. someone wearing mask since May following social distance guidelines since March, say full-throated ""fuck no"" wearing mask protect people given chance get vaccinated haven't. soon gets point anyone wanted vaccine gotten one done shit, mandate not. Also know take Pfizer refuse others  imagined close relative choose getting Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine waiting three weeks get Moderna Pfizer vaccine. “All us said, ‘Get one tomorrow,’” Schaffner said. “The virus bad. You’re risking three weeks exposure opposed getting protection tomorrow.”

That wording seems potentially misleading. understand it, even get vaccinated immunity fully develop 2-3 weeks last dose. read USA secured enough mRNA vaccines fully inoculate 300 million people. theory, would anyone wants one could get one - willing wait final batches come Q3. Sounds exactly like Czechia, lol.

Doesn't help PM billionaire owns agricultural concern, everything government usually judged ""How benefit PM?"" rather ""How help country?""...  goes show much infectious covid flu, measures failing hold, barely holding, covid bay resulted almost flu cases year. predicted May unrealistic would vaccine end year. two...  thanks condolences

is academic citation that? I've wary weeks since know viruses frozen time permafrost layers alive could still infect organism dose J&amp;J prevents sickness ~72% US cases recent variants

That actually wording used reported results. said prevents 72% *moderate severe* cases. reads ""you still infected contagious, seriously ill."" mRNA vaccines playing word game? 100% protection death, requires cold chain sophisticated beer cooler, needs single shot uses older, robust vector (which makes production easier). mention numbers probably saw bit misleading, vaccine eliminates almost symptoms (and said, protect 100% death serious injury), perfectly fine start reopening returning normal  Experts besides Dr. Doom Osterholm? seems even conservative estimates saying back normal fall.

I would expect Spring much normal elderly at-risk vaccinated.  Awesome. hope everything goes smoothly them. Ingmar Hoerr, founder Curevac, said two weeks ago try get US market. go EU rest third world only.  sorts things try minimize car deaths. 

speed limits, stop lights/stop signs, speed bumps, various traffic laws, tickets, air bags, seat belts, recalls faulty cars, wrongful death lawsuits, DUI criminal cases, mandatory insurance ""points"" violations, tire air pressure machines gas stations, civil engineering safe streets, drivers licensing, eye tests, drivers education, on. 

This despite driving basically necessity. 

If REALLY want compare COVID driving, fact matter makes sense rules regulations safety, like driving. Alright, thanks. meantime I’ll take whatever shot hope best. South Africa Results:  Approximately 90% COVID-19 cases attributed South Africa escape South Africa Phase 2b clinical trial, 60% efficacy (95% CI: 19.9 – 80.1) prevention mild, moderate severe COVID-19 disease observed 94% study population HIV-negative.

One severe case occurred placebo group cases mild moderate. clinical trial also achieved primary efficacy endpoint overall trial population, including HIV-positive HIV-negative subjects (efficacy 49.4%; 95% CI: 6.1 – no. highest efficient vaccine SA/BR around 50-60% right now. Perhaps sign burning own? Around 8000 die everyday regardless US alone pre-covid. soon everyone get shot want, things going back media government person stop it. true all. mRNA technology subject many promising treatments studies prime immune system intervene cancer cells bearing certain targetable markers. Lebanon ruins forever, politically unstable, especially 2006 war Israel, Syrian civil war 2011. country run radicalist Iranian proxy - Hezbollah. talking about? know who’s safe right now? child abusive parents. child “missing” school system last year. child falling depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation social isolation. sure... virtual schools “safe”. 5? measures, five vaccines — Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, Novavax Johnson &amp; Johnson — look extremely good. 

not named: SinoPharm SinoVac CanSino made know who.  fair summary read JAMA piece.

The risks opening schools quite low nonzero, costs keeping closed enormous. Thus benefits outweigh risks. Except rules never followed Texas begin with. Restaurants businesses packed nines. balance illusion it. end working class live multi generational homes take majority load. Schools cannot fix that.

It also reasonable put children, parents, grandparents, teachers staff risk benefit fringe cases responsibility social services / Child protective services public education system.  No. Rates going everywhere. pretty blown proportion imo. That's really minority people get symptoms. fine couple hours.

You lucky - means really strong immune response. Car accidents singular event. 

A virus not. 

This really hard NJ course nothing EU. UK, Israel US. Eh, feel like it’s still joke though. worry get second shot six weeks. trials included people waited long fine. brother infectious disease doctor: Prepare slight cold/fever getting second moderna shot. surprise feel worse second shot first.

Congrats otherwise! Can't wait parents get vaccinated. Bonafide Masks really affordable KN95s, headband ear loop. wear mine week small grocery trips, visiting elderly relative, 8 hours working weekend. alternate masks wear top, may conserve longer. basically never going end. virus going continue mutate, making current vaccines worthless people get infected new variants... like flu, worse. We're fucked. doesn’t still show teachers much higher risks jobs? isn’t probably working around kids day?

You make good point I’m arguing it- it’s best look biases.... think perhaps read comment incorrectly. He's criticizing lockdown. first “create” virus launch world = evil country. /s

Variants seem whatever “side effect,” virus changed. perception variant country may “caused” it. (Of course, CHINA’s fault.) /s Please don’t fall media fear mongering every single person dies gets Covid getting vaccine. One anecdotes evidence anything, sure make click bait headlines news stories enticing. western media outlets controlled CCP one knows it.

Its strategic want shift narrarive away them. misleading chart shows Chicago order open person teaching. would question be? Back normal soon!  least put context “safely”. Usually it’s “what do” sort electric fence hanging family something. CDC:
Coronaviruses surfaces objects naturally die within hours days. Warmer temperatures exposure sunlight reduce time virus survives surfaces objects.

Ive heard permafrost virus thingys there's 0 evidence thats happening covid think generally accepted thats coronaviruses work. solely people donated lot effort finally funds? know lot donated cause show underfunded research that’s case. Thank explaining! “Granted hospitalized” lot work there. That’s massive leap 80% mild symptoms. Lol. again. YoU’Re SeLfIsH! 

What action? haven’t said thing don’t do. would suggest work little nuance work views, knee jerk insults. Well, that's reassuring. child abusive parents kept school year safe. That’s though, don’t understand deal wearing masks course you’re gonna discount people don’t like masks. totally disagree user, think unfair. consumer economy. offered free credit dozens firms soon hit 18. fact bought stuff online Black Friday - makes hypocrite? stretch IMO Oof, wishing quick recovery! wonder guy doesn’t know difference you’re actually read understood study.

Saving comment, thank you! talking still summer 2020. didn’t J&amp;J break efficacy vs different variants data, including “original” dominant strain?

How prove someone got covid kid vs literally dozens possible infection vectors someone encounters day?

I've run COVID notifications phone several months. received zero exposure notifications. Based evidence, conclude COVID even contagious, least, contagious via vectors encounter day day basis, provably false.

If see evidence says kids shed (spread) virus, conclude safe open schools without vaccinating adults. I'll also eat shoe, proclaim is, fact, weirdest virus ever. But, far I'm aware, never virus history entire age group excluded spreading virus. That's logical, that's viruses work. kid gets infected sneezes mouth something like that, logic reason tells likely get infected. need data evidence that, basic understanding viruses spread, or, like call it, ""logic"" best cheese? same! currently covid got excited reread title said refute said. said vaccines work lessening symptoms lessening chances bad outcomes.

Hell, workplace even give us PPE, buy stuff. Plus make less people unemployment (not deserve money, wish got paid more.) pivot containment vaccinations. No, trust health agencies failed contain virus containment strategies. you? so, why?

With regards Marin County ""only two cases schools."" Please provide breakdown rest cases transmitted cannot linked schools. fact every case knows origin transmission leaves room number substantially higher proven.

Both vaccines available parallel. first vaccine receive one protecting 2021, yes, people absolutely delay weeks hop vaccination sites means better protected year. don’t need advance trials boosters surface (I still think boosters won’t actually needed). don’t advance trials every year’s reformulation flu vaccine. mRNA system even plug play that.  disturbing choose ignore obstacles still overcome say confidently there's little risk activities pre pandemic days. article clearly states two reasons people CHOOSE safer. Notice capitalized choose? youre American youre locked house follow risk assessment. Science provides guidance information hand.

The two reasons are:
1) Uncertainty vaccines mitigate transmission
2) mutated variants may cause issues

We'll learn things time, jest article is- wise cautious (for now) may still able transmit virus loved one household + mutated variants starting emerge US know exactly impact even vaccinated. 

Im trying debbie downer, either. fully expect we'll strong sense normal back summer time, youre one already vaccinated, note still risks. vaccinated still playing safe there's information regarding transmission numbers area begin freefall like last summer. second dose top up, they're following manufacturers guidelines. pulling information from?

Nobody gives shit anymore. gov pretty much refuses buy vaccines. People tried start ""movement"" twitter beg gov buy vaccines, gov called twitter crowd traitors wanting evil US made vaccine. funny, delusion hilarious. 

So we're getting vaccines. 
Our joke vaccine made Cuba... WHAT
And tested 37 people already they're gonna mass manufacturing. 37 large enough sample. 

They also tried shut us buying Sputnik V vaccine. biggest joke? None health officials willing take vaccine, stating approved yet international organization.

NORMAL SUMMER COME Ok.. it’s obligatory say.. I’m sorry...

Nice Hard one. IDK. tried run cactus mayor San Antonio, people hardly ever ask it, think interesting story. congress sends approved bill? “why one questioning this?” “well what’s question?” “I don’t know! that’s need asking!”  vaccines required travel, work school people flood get  (mostly) people kids kids, rest us put risk? 

It's school's fault parents abuse them, feed them, poor, etc. solution problems better social safety nets, actually making useful, (Giving someone $25/month EBT insulting joke) opening schools putting entire adult population risk. Masks enforced airports planes entire pandemic experience see saying minimum 70% people lungs lifelong smoker afterwards might overhyping it? I'm talking 100m goal. I'm saying decide go back normal summer say well Biden handled whole thing. 

I saying Biden set low bar, media setting low bar things, specific one. Since forced wear mask security? place long time. mean? Dammed new math. Yeah probably expecting virus mutations. really common adjust yearly flu vaccines according influenza mutations. 

This pandemic get less severe less deadly vaccines establish immunity. useless. 

On right path. Expect continue, indeed! dudes statistic complete fabrication ? Mystery busy getting COVID-19.  Wouldn’t need, like, 1.2 billion per month everyone test per week? 19 million per month seems like super low number worthwhile benefit, even they’re used limited cases. can’t test everyone entering workplace week, everyone wants enter bar concert, don’t much beyond occasional COVID theater. [FDA rates 91% 96% accurate false positives false negatives. free us! Lol media likes make everyone think equal chance ending hospital, vast majority ones actually ending hospital ones getting vaccinated now.

There still plenty cases while. much less severe. media likely use case numbers keep fear going. JJ yes, others no. gonna disagree.... we've seen Tri-State's mortality figures. California approached we'd seeing tens thousands deaths gone full Florida opened up. feel perished ""nothing"" expendable, can't even discussion since &amp; different view value human life.

All restrictions eased metrics mirror normal flu season. whole thing sold protecting healthcare systems, eliminating death. exactly media ""in on"" here? role play ensuring Biden administration meets 100 million doses/100 days goal? Either numbers show goal met don't.

Again, 100 million doses 100 days goal Biden administration says they're aiming for. media nothing that. point gonna $200. 1,200+600+200=2,000, see lie 😂 prosthetic pulmonary valve get first dose 9th!

[Let’s put straw man pandemic denial &lt;--good article touches chorus you’d come think biggest problem responding pandemic comes Americans think Covid-19 hoax — so-called Covid claim straw man: epidemic pandemic denial. Polls since March shown Americans overwhelmingly aren’t denial: believe threat Covid-19 real, reasonably good identifying medical misinformation, largely complying public health recommendations. Compared peers Europe, Americans willing get vaccinated Covid-19, similarly likely wear masks, prone believe common conspiracy theories pandemic’s U.S.’s response Covid-19 bungled many respects, widespread public denial doesn’t explain obsession denialism isn’t inaccurate. It’s corrosive least three reasons. First, needlessly alienates interested public false accusations. Second, conflating reasonable dissent unreasonable misinformation, stifles debate, even issues genuinely warrant discussion. Third, myth denial deflects blame policy failures politicians, use claim they’ve done could, leaving denialists (and cheesecake eaters) blame. correct, still increasing volume vials help long run. better logistics less waste.

We could get vaccine sooner alleviate need doses overtime. I'm dead yet.

yes, are.

No not. stone dead people final say governments do. What? filling vials more. previously filled vials enough 10 doses, fill higher contain 15 doses. paying dose, changes nothing charging government. Here’s assistant deputy director education Singapore tell things take 5-6 years anything go back normal. single person died Covid

Nah, think /r/conspiracy cool statement. single person died COVID vaccine, hand... need, like, 1.2 billion per month everyone test per week?

To next point think might tiny bit biased stories, studies, doctors choose show? decisions might something current president? mean, besides peer pressure, EMT sister's reasoning behind refusing vaccine? I'd rather get vaccine side effects, deal something could mess long term way. 420 breathe Cases dropping world US, arent open closed, combination depending  Every hurdle put place costs money verify introduces inefficiency.

I'm expecting next winter shot a/some different variant/s - possibly s/one yet known. way $1.9 trillion bill passing reconciliation. Manchin said wouldn’t support eliminating filibuster option, since get Republican support. 

To argue plan otherwise simply wrong. Biden hoped Republican support counter offer makes clear happen. We've inconsistent approach public health messaging- legal people house, go gym, eat indoors country, time told people applied social pressure/shaming so. People legally sorts things, also shamed so.

 fine tell people risks still know are. someone lives unvaccinated immunocompromised person, We've schizophrenic approach public health messaging- legal people house, go gym, eat indoors country, time told people applied social pressure/shaming so. People legally sorts things, also shamed so.

It's fine tell people risks still know are. someone lives unvaccinated immunocompromised person, probably continue social distance. use social pressure shame get people may badly struggling mental health continue isolation indefinitely.

If propose shift goalposts vaccine numbers freefall, whatever level is- people trust going shift goalposts again? Maybe next zero COVID, start whenever new variant new disease? People lose trust kind public health messaging simply ignore public health advice. don’t much say good luck coming out. feel relieved it! It’s scary best decision ever made. Sending lots love ❤️❤️❤️ advice (and questions asked got vaccine) UK much avoid Pfizer one history serious allergic reactions. yes, agree reason makes sense.

(I also understand hesitancy various new vaccine platforms used (I think traditional deactivated virus versions coming along later) though personally think there's enough testing UK fine either.) hide forever.

I mean, depending rate take vaccinations whether provides sterilizing immunity, definitely possibility one ""hide forever.""

Right, put together specific standards, clearly show AZ Johnson+Johnson vaccines significantly less effective preventing symptomatic COVID. There’s really ambiguity. that's perfectly fine.

I think that's calling anomaly. serious symptoms 20 yr old unusual, prolonged symptoms also unusual. rare. agree fact asymptomatic mildly cold-like symptomatic cases, according studies every 3rd case, huge problem person could spreading week, maybe even 10 days, shedding much viral particles hospitalized patients ( peak lasts 2-3 days looks like), plus asymptomatic cases unusually long incubation period, infections person starts shedding virus hours become symptomatic, usually day might infect someone already bed isolated. covid people spread several days (usually 2-4) becoming symptomatic... 

That need develope use cheap tests, cheap enough test morning, get quick result based decide continue isolate.... no, western governments decided global restrictions keep hospitals running dont solve anything, drain economy waiting uncertain miracle cure vaccine, might good enough, newest mutations showing us immunity gained original virus via vaccinatio recovering covid might enough. like Dutch virus gonna doom us. didn’t. UK virus gonna doom us. didn’t. South African virus doom us. I’ll let figure happen. Oh also Google “South Africa coronavirus cases” look little graph scroll down. Nope. would never. dislike ideologues nationalists.

Why answer points? are:

This disgusting disinformation you. apologise retract

But glad used logic selling profit immoral. use logic EU companies

Please answer: rich countries get vaccine makes EU's approach moral? month ago, cases/deaths/hospitalizations all-time high, told Memorial day would unofficial social end pandemic America (though also believed large events return mid/late summer). 

One month later, every indicator falling like stone, competent administration, vaccinations going well, yet given media narratives summer events cancelled left right, feel like they're trying get society believe 2021 basically going cancelled like 2020 was.

I know things getting better US, today state reported lowest positivity percentage since SEPTEMBER we're level restrictions summer. Yet seems expectations normalcy upcoming summer similar last summer (e.g. can't buy beer 7-11 past 9, beaches closed 11-5). I've taking virus seriously since things shut back mid-March, know hit point year, going mentally difficult move forward. I've tried use period make major changes life, planning coming closet sometime May June time expected people start going again, given media narrative, especially last week, know. crazy nurse gave first said take ibuprofen preemptively avoid arm hurting. got second dose last week say anything - neither use avoid painkillers. Yep statements really even make sense. can't turn facts coherent sentences. take person believes/speculates/worries state fact.

The actual studies actual vaccines actual strains show good efficacy. decline antibodies certain strains necessarily mean vaccines work even reduced efficacy. 

It's like can't wait undermine everyone's confidence. Found do0mer   all, humbled patients felt safe enough share stories public, hard-working physicians researchers hell-bent understanding this. 

&amp;#x200B;

Thanks reading, supporting work. wife fully vaccinated weeks away parents. 

I think vaccinated definitely fine mingle vaccinated people.

But’ll we’ll continue wear masks distance.

It would great knew us vaccinated would prevent unvaccinated friends getting it. Think popular we’d dinner parties?

But still chance could get covid despite vaccinated definitely chance could spread provably even chance we’d asymptomatic know spreading it.

Scientists really need get damn answers a.s.a.p. not.  lingering problems caused damage done initial infection (however long lasts person). Chicken pox lies dormant system COVID not. Herpes similar viruses family encoded DNA, COVID coronaviruses encoded don’t work antihuman people hating this, panic wears off...NOBODY going want admit long stayed panic hopefully ever comply flavor mass insanity EVER Ah sucks. hope situation gets better soon feds able provide 3 week vaccine shipment numbers visibility states.  assuming need pass reconciliation? 

That never plan, isn’t plan now. 

Biden clear wants passed republican support. means least debate vote reconciliation. 

Where debate vote? happening trial? so, better cost less $30. $30 ridiculously expensive. [Abbott's BinaxNOW rapid test already commercially costs $5 bought directly organizations. understand pulling argument thin air right? Prayers New Normal crowd. needs based assessment homeless people see actually needs place stay. get anymore stupid lol Locking whenever single case detected isn’t going fly US places


It isn’t. Sorry Lmao, islands Sub Saharan Africa pretty much back normal. closed borders early small population control. America fucked way way worse comparison. People wanna listen truth happened community implemented lockdown even though community spread negligible? saying public choosing safe time?

And specifically media doing, disseminating factual information virus? that’s 37.5% normal.

That’s big deal.

And no, people wouldn’t died anyways, look 2020 data that’s made seychelles? one highest vaccinations rates, like donating israel Actually can't believe already ""Covid headline generator"" web site... surely must exist. It'd easy create too. argument guess right obvious younger people try discount seriousness Covid it’s mostly killing much older people live life chronic illness injury yet. idea make life hell you’re constantly racking medical bills, missing work (if manage stay employed), able take care family home. people getting anything actually lost jobs. Sending everyone check ridiculously wasteful denies aid actually need it. “The needs many outweigh needs few, one.”

If find article topic, that’s fine! statistical anomaly

Empathy award year, possibly decade People seem assume overweight means larger average. 

The truth overweight *is* average. 95% 60% efficacy vaccine similar benefits society. absolutely similar benefits individual

Not really, benefits dying ending hospital. data long term protection work blocking transmission. primary benefits using different vaccines unknown. Transmission matters way countries everyone vaccinated rightfully concerned getting COVID-19 themselves, rightfully want receive higher-efficacy treatments. mass rollout lower efficacy options going create mess: people calling around find higher efficacy options refusing vaccines arrive appointments “lose lottery”. inevitable cases occur people received lower efficacy vaccines, word spread anti-vaccine proponents propaganda campaign we’re seeing right pump AZ J+J shots precisely public officials realize selling tough bill goods. announcements public figures like Dr. Fauci intended reduce hesitation receive lower efficacy vaccines, akin initial inaccurate information provided public asking wear masks conserve supply - well intended falsehood goes individual interests.

I American know story talking about, mass coverage vaccine stops covid running noise bad thing. vaccines stop serious illness. That's disinformation, campaign going encourage anti-vaccine sentiment unless officials start acknowledging elephant room: asking people sacrifice personal well-being accelerate societal recovery months

This true comments like yours. vaccines give protection. Trying discredit ""weaker"" ones based single context statistics exactly anti vaccination people tend do. ""Oh, 1 1000 died sure why, everyone panic"".

By way, there's long term data, mRna vaccines bigger unknown. That's say safe, new technology always question marks like longevity. Traditional vaccines easier people accept it.  comment interesting read articles Feb., speculated East Asian lungs especially succeptivle Covid. appears reverse may true, least basis studies. idea could somehow control contain highly infectious respiratory virus peak human arrogance. don’t care either. 2020 showed absolutely rude terrible people other. stay home stay away people wear mask benefit vaccination spreading droplets thing. 

Karen gets covid won’t vaccinate? I’m gonna laugh boat buddies shit talk people lives sucked trump’s dick like candy. You’re asking wrong people. Taiwan South Korea internal lockdowns, saying. CDC said kids unable spread virus.

So actually science figure sure? Would yet another first covid, virus spreads one age group, another. makes perfect sense kids show symptoms spread virus, that's one main hallmarks covid, asymptomatic spread.

Not viruses spread way, viruses spread regardless age is. always concern- already eligible approved vaccine, agree study might get placebo?

I particular expertise, now, suppose answer probably still recruit younger people US Europe. soon studies might go elsewhere world.

Eventually bulk population need boosters suppose trial group control group similar vaccination schedules measure difference. pivot containment vaccinations. 
 
Because said trust American European health agencies, approved vaccines. So, *do* trust health agencies, ""containment"". That's fine, clarifying. 
 No, trust health agencies failed contain virus containment strategies. you? so, why? 
 
I trust scientists identify what's dangerous isn't, see reason think scientists Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand somehow credible US Europe *their countries* faring better. Moreover, see scientists Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand think differently US Europe. countries able implement different policies different circumstances; policies that, unfortunately, would never happen across US.

That's really works. prove every case city came demonstrate come house.

I'm sure number higher 530, US **3.2 million** teachers. However, article: ""There indication teachers infected dying higher rate people professions.""

Leading one higher death rates relatively young country. could said Brazil. Vaccines can’t come soon enough! ""Safe **me**"", said mayor. /s actually saw tweet compared vaccines trials three categories; number people died COV19, number people required hospitalization COV19 number deaths vaccine. 

They zeros across categories every one vaccines. think highlights focusing more. damn, feel like republicans America would abuse hell system lot gradations vaccine hesitancy. Someone like would refer vaccine hesitant, ""anti-vaxxer.""

The normal timeline vaccine development ten years, lot people concern quickly vaccines developed approved. 

However things went rapid development testing sped up. 

First long time development vaccine usually delay basic research, regulatory delays, time spent writing grants, waiting reviews, trying raise money find volunteers. 

A ton money thrown problem, sped lot processes. Much basic research vaccine types complete pandemic coronaviruses like MERS-CoV, mRNA vaccines lot promise general diseases. 

Certain trial phases conducted parallel (at time) instead series. trials able recruit people quickly disease common enough people control groups became sick world data could analyzed quickly. 

Really terms number people trials (which much better measure length trials) *very* well tested vaccines. 

It's true specific long-term data them, but:

* pandemic make best decision what's safest given know
* long term data mRNA vaccines prior animal studies strongly suggestive long term safety. Day one million reminding everyone government set restrictions noobs talking abt “2022 maybe eat outdoors once” Soon vast majority people high risk hospitalization death vaccinated. That’s difference. I'm sure ""nobody"" refers workplace. Certainly authorities know 25 year old died. Data trackers allowed r/coronavirus. One post high-quality news source posted significant international, national regional landmark. fucking sense would make kill now? would anyone gain it? 

Your question sounds like oh random woman got ran street, hmmm that’s fishy. Good luck. Unless mutates Captain Trips, people give move lives long that. would that? principal position clearly based science. really complaining. pointing made statement people clearly like downvotes going change mind. really hope get J+J shot make unhappy. traditional technology, single shot, 100% severe symptoms good enough me.

Also, literally everyone heard got 2-shot said second shot really fucked up. Since I'm completely comfortable wearing mask nowadays, feel like much worry afford wait. people get vaccinated, lower chances contracting wild gets, time I'm eligible think 66% efficacy rate matter much long I'm protected severe symptoms. know downvoted.

Yes, Israel largest scale human experiment world entitled results public domain.

It's valuable humanity kept secret. Well, dying sounds great all, organ damage blood clots like Covid also known for. also eliminated vaccine? Sounds like found one. Hit little close home? bother argue credentials perceived intelligence opinion matters judging rude insulting comment already tell think smarter most.

It’s really disturbing many people selfish sleep without thinking else could hurting process. Americans like people Taiwan New Zealand adjusted sleep cycles mandated government... someone tell district least handing N95 masks? going force educators back rooms packed kids hours time, least minimum. think everything massive events (ie concerts, gathering sporting areas, etc) come back summer.

Fall imagine brings back things like mentioned above. little, I’ve heard 60% sure accurate like you.  new tech never effective vaccine made Study Conclusions: **Seropositive young adults one-fifth risk subsequent infection compared seronegative individuals.** Although antibodies inducted initial infection largely protective, guarantee effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity immunity subsequent infection. findings may relevant optimization mass vaccination strategies. new normal crowd deserves prayers. true. stance unless around fully vaccinated people, assume currently positive asymptomatic take appropriate precautions. 

I dont see continuing wear masks moving goal post. Weve always wait till enough people vaccinated things return normal. still wear masks protect others phase. Gotcha, thanks  Yes never go anywhere see friends never intimate anyone see eyes must leave house. cannot understand people think days. Remember around 20% population 16 vaccinated. Also, least 10-20% refuse vaccine. is, total, 60-70% population vaccinated. CureVac deliveries expected June possible deal NovaVax, possibility complete vaccination 1. July definitely realistic. Thank god, sanity sub. I’m total agreement. people care much schools reopening, vaccinate teachers faster... trying troll, going chance summer? Everything open except sporting events / large gatherings. full capacity stadiums / concerts summer? Won’t happen  mainstream benefits fear mongering. Look many entertainment companies trying act life long friends sucker spending cash. That's feel CNN. used watch almost exclusively they've really left bad taste mouth various reasons past couple years. knew going Osterholm even clicked article. correction: said aim offer vaccination every adult end third quarter, everyone vaccinated (as headlines regularly used make sound like germany make vaccination mandatory) Take [look this. ease mind give optimism. would fully support workers demanding better conditions/vaccinations/whatever need people shouldn’t fucking dying minimum wage job.  one reasons cited surveys report.

I’m sure must much difficult imagine. Good news! We're dying! going live *FOREVER!*  way sending total amount vaccine. want say amount vial worth 5 doses originally calculated, decrease amount owe USA 5 doses every vial send, without actually sending more.

We chosen shut 5 days safe Security Guard went lot places customers last week.
I getting tested today well.
How anyone stage,after seeing happened place COVID gets control could think 5 day lock reaction beyond me. also remember frontline doctors nurses never seeing representative sample. Every COVID patient treat someone whose illness severe needed go hospital, means they’re already outlier.

YESSSSS. Nurses doctors see worst disease, that's part job. exact thing true DISEASES, ACCIDENTS, MEDICAL AILMENTS. ALWAYS see worst case scenarios - that's what's required jobs. Wow. Damn. stand corrected. study probably head clear hate this. can't find good reason believe long term effects rare ignore them.

I sympathize. easy assume person arguing wanting believe arguing must always argue truth else. Didn’t Osterholm legit say week thought pandemic would “never end?” Christakis saying “2024 normalcy” like making wonder actual end goal people are? honestly saving every life possible “we cannot ever risk anything ever may mean die COVID.

Obese #1,2 3 driving factor 
-	heart attacks, strokes, high blood pressure etc
-	cancer 
-	kidney failure 
-	type 2 diabetes 
-	etc 
-	this virus

It also makes healthcare expensive. 

The virus 0.2% chance killing you, pretty much obese old. obese near 100% chance taking many many years life virus will. 

America made lazy gluttony ok. There’s endless amount excuses (my generics, worked didn’t lose weight, job etc). It’s quite sad. public aware risks seeking scientific studies and/or relying CDC/WHO/other reliable non-news sources. OP ill try explain anyway. Let's say run medical trial two groups, one got vaccine one didn't. We'll say 10,000 got vaccine 10,000 got placebo (like saline injection). 

You watch group say 3 months. 5 people vaccinated group get sick test positive covid19. 100 people placebo group get sick test positive covid19. effectiveness 100/(5+100) = 95.2%. 

The math gets little complicated groups size, that's basic idea effectiveness calculated. 

To return specific question, really easy say vaccine 100% effective 95% people, 95% effective people there's multiple arbitrary ways categorize ""people"" question. answer question, it'll probably take find unless there's smoking gun like vaccine work 50% african-americans 5% vaccine receivers make antibodies vaccine. unlikely would answer question effective 95% people. Easy, repeal Trump tax cut.

Also, stimulus isnt frivolous. It'll go right back economy spurring demand, important. going first step toward normalcy. nursing homes stop getting absolutely clobbered hospitalizations deaths quickly decline.

For while, saw nothing speculative posts tons people comments disparaging people anything hiding home. Every time tried defend people taking reasonable precautions, would get downvoted called selfish.

Honestly, anyone thinks everyone stay home hide away months end god damn mind. Adult obesity 42% US.

It's basically impossible disease obesity number one comorbidity. 837 deaths per million inhabitants country rampant subnotification working? dont doubt far 1000. Oh man. GLAD see kind commentary here. feel like tone sub starting turn people finally realizing media intensified fear much boost clicks profit.    Relations quite good India Seychelles. Moreover Indian Ocean Region important India. mean like called “Spanish flu”? one went children 5 pretty aggressively. Also high rate mortality among 25-35 age group.

 People backlashed restrictions like now. Actual title: 

Progress fight coronavirus coming, Texas long way herd immunity  There's nothing gym can't home outside

Mmm, disagree point. likely can't afford/fit full lift station home, *are* exercises require gym. agree 85% people gym accomplished without significant equipment though. c&amp;p skills have. Also nice don’t consider people Canada, South Korea, Japan, Israel many countries outside EU worthy support ""rich"". 

Again. Another lie. made comment. asked whether would consider moral virtue help already rich. true display virtue. (Or maybe antisimetic attitudes, considering Israel’s place list).

Aaah. Nazi. really shameful person (especially German ministers threatening Israeli access vaccines, doubt offer nothing obedience).

We come far enough. copy paste again, answers. soon Nazi mentions happen point. guess Nazis sore point you. it.

I respond thread again. bit less ideology acceptance clear intellectual limitations (for example, link articles contradict argument) would benefit. Hope get vaccine year! Western Australia, lucky now.

Also far away expensive travel travel around much tourism state anyway.

Our State leader closed state internally externally right start. Limiting opportunity virus get foot hold.

The UV levels sun nasty humans virus. external surfaces exposed sun would sanitised quickly.

Another factor could vitamin levels population. would hard living vitamin deficiency sun exposure.

We also spread population don’t many appartments yet. Job loss single metric tell whole story, know it. absurd starting point... rest non sequitur, I'd say absolutely let's too. Raise taxes rich meaningfully audit defense budget rather continue rob productivity poor.

Your last sentence absolute side-buster... God help us poors buy things made poor people put money stock market instead savings account earning 0.001% interest. Good, I’m never going act superior people trying get day, especially everyone one world relate government giving single fuck us here, second appt scheduled nurse gave first dose. like saying need restaurants chewing home What's problem? basically.. 95% chance 100% immune? watching tv, said pfizer moderna lots older people.  pretty soon largely irrelevant. Almost everyone vaccinated next months virus going go tremendously terms case numbers suspect. We'll see think see contributions China time soon. India shipping vaccines counties faster vaccinating something think would see, extremely impressed India generosity. Sources show China vaccinated 24 million citizens Jan. 31 lot news concerning China shipping counties. seems push vaccinate currently. figured so. Thanks replying! [This appears case. Cases older groups plummeting. Take Money!!!!!!!!!! investor $mrna, too. official tracking tell, millions doses far people outside trail doctors seniors, either way groups well covered now. 

The grocery delivery guy people covered well, worried young people work medical field nearly much data. still trial study data though. Kids basically data on. downvote every one type posts first. Percent effectiveness individual would hard define. Implied*

and really. Regular hikes, paddleboarding, going park. addition, home bodyweight exercise regime, I'm studying using distance learning. addition, near-daily group conversations via voice video friends. 

Your extreme alarmist vision continuing stay safe looks like straw man. Immunity infection - 80+%

Immunity one dose - 60% 

Def good move maybe Where? Extenuated stated 94% people could vaccinated end summer UK. understand using putting efforts it. Russia already made 2nd vaccine make 3rd. Cause 2nd 3rd effective VS sputnik.  That’s great question!! Honestly yes think value limited. certainly times would handy. family member returning trip want quarantine test allowing back bubble home. change interact public large. would still isolate use masks. personally easier access testing would impact daily life. whilst agree , every virus cause serious harm something mortality rate 60’s less 1% lockdown country dismantle economy (the UK) seems rather illogical, sub obliterates anyone opinion like still deep cleaning?

Because CDC forfeited much credibility issue thus qualified authority say ""deep cleaning necessary.""

If running office want get back office saying compliance applicable CDC guidelines table stakes nowhere good enough.  yet, hold horses guess im even confused then.

If taking risk going daycare, can't grandparents hold her? Especially they're vaccinated? Oh! understand. foolishly thought longest time quartal four months. appreciate clear up! ^^ *We’ll see well efficacy current vaccines stands test time virus mutations.*

Yes, likely we'll fine.

*It also assumes people want vaccinate themselves. given days!* 

I think we'll okay let anti-vaxxers die next pandemics. vaccines widely available, could honestly care less die disease. two weeks flatten curve we’re shouldn't. people work vaccination programs should. know even ballpark. 1 500 **died** covid regions, 1 100k-1M get severe reaction 99% survive it. Meanwhile, headline CNN millions Americans await vaccinations, contagious variants virus emerged expectations return normalcy fading fast

Why CNN awful everything? Watch boomers start congregating, hell break loose. way youth stand isolate everyone vaccinated going lives. Many US nursing home staff spend 90% time Facebook groups contributing spread misinformation. Yeah, missed whole point fact thing wrong economy virus. massive pent demand. Savings rates higher they've forever. People hoarding cash waiting go spend it. simply wont happen. evening news tonight showed delivery schedule vaccines Germany. largest numbers even show 3rd financial quarter.

They numbers production Germany. Q1 looks really poor. September whole EU many vaccines. Wait, link it?  argument really follow.

I think protocols around phase 3 trial order gather ""real world"" data, mean avoiding use vaccination make effective. send result phone?! /s

This basically rapid test Abbott's bluetooth reading results. Basically lot plastic/electronic waste increased cost. Kinda messed ask me. Imagine pregnancy test bluetooth. enough patio heaters. /s whatever like summer, don’t presupposition everyone wants vaccine able one then. guarantee many many millions Americans want vaccine one June. issue roll out, going well many states. ""Just going walk? Here's still need wear helmet"" yes, live Augsburg, i‘m date everything that‘s going on. (Söder one said according Spiegel) long first quarter stood situation would remain tight. Starting Q2 Q3 would improve lot more, without counting J&amp;J Curevac looking promising Germany already deals with. We‘ve always known would exponential delivery vaccines like Iraq War UK. majority people cheered 2003, asked people today thought right course action... Unfortunately, many people seem think precautions foolproof realize still get infected wearing mask eating indoors, even 6+ feet away others. would probably irresponsible right now, however it’s still issue. Judging current posts, sub seems lot happy takers... feel like I’m going crazy reading things like article, also shit CNN, WaPo etc hellbent extending doom gloom forecasts 2022.

Hate invoke flu, covid less deadly flu would keep shit beyond anticipated US herd immunity fall 2021? Lmfao what!!!😭😭 keep fear mongering going Well, think conspiratorial wonder Democratic pols incentivized maximize reaction COVID order hurt Trump.

More charitably, may known actually dangerous wanted overly cautious keep people home. Nah, mRNA vaccines ton uses beyond COVID. They're stay. enforced TSA 6+ months ago well. thanks! sure are, anything ventilation point?

I ridden subway bus year - matter clean are. world done absolutely horrible job communicating whole bubble thing actually needed work.

Nevermind material subset populace intentionally refusing take precautions government mandated enforced. Fuck rhetoric. sound like authoritarian freak. 

Media’s issues come model use making money. “Mainstream” hell lot credibility fly-by-night orgs. 

You want better media? Fund it. Yeah, doubt factored model yet sure vaccines either. rarely mean never know rarely. last day summer September 22. Last day Q3 September 30. Wolfpack others already gave great answers, one that's still missing suspect partially blame freezing thawing larger volume. They'd ensure stability product good larger time product would soend transition states. Curiosity got best checked instagram month ago. used post almost every day posted since got vaccine December. definitely little weird. 

I feel like even questioning anything like label tinfoil hat wearer social media allows see everything. seems bizarre. well 95% chance symptoms Meanwhile Germany doesn’t even 2 million yet US, strictly speaking Trump administration, introduced vaccine export ban. US COVID-free till summer enough facilities produce vaccines. Super Vaccinize Me! Except China Italy, recall worse situation occurred Guayaquil. remember seeing news country showing 300+ patients lined hospital parking lot, many dying waited. else deaths home occur fast bodies collected? quarter consists three months.

We also use every resource available amp production vaccines even government needs themselves. not? 

If Canada US committed hard lockdown part would gone now. Well short term gave two szenarios , best case enough vaccine every adult July, bad scenario september. ( summer goes 21th June 22th September calender). federal election 26th september .
And worst case enough vaccine coming 4th quarter anyways.
For want details , clear schedule many vaccine company expected quarter. Oh sure given amount FUD around vaccines. many people know usually rational believe science still saying they're going refuse vaccine. combine heavily restricted travel unvaccinated individuals LOT fear around getting vaccine good market fakery created. People willing pay fake documents/apps/whatever order game system. dont know ecuatorian law, Brazil, lockdowns demand wartime state decreed specific areas, congress approves everything renewed 30 days.

In Brazil, mayors governors imposed lockdowns without deadline even demanding legislative approval. Even municipal councillors voted. prime minister New Zealand closed borders. get called racist? No. hot called hero prompt effective reaction. may wrong, think ""edited"" versions existing vaccines also still need undergo clinical tests. *If* true, I'd say would time-consuming part upgrading vaccine. told since start ""official"" death rate lower reality. Here, announce two numbers: Covid deaths, ""deaths context Covid,"" dead Covid symptoms testing done. yes, death rate reality higher.

That said, April, Ecuador worst country S. America except Brazil, every metric. months followed, dropped rankings, we're much better most. also rarely spreads outdoors we're wearing masks walking street. \*Shrug\* worry though, tells depressed extended 2024 health care crisis instead focus awesome science is!

It's interest could get mask usage 95%, could save 55K lives thru end March. let guard down, could lose additional 153K people.

It can't said enough: Folks refuse comply masking social distancing guidelines killing people. I'd say still wear mask social distance outside home. People wearing signs around necks saying vaccine people can't really tell, I'ts good idea everyone infection rates plummet.

She'd never say since EU Commissioners elected. slowed disease down. Specifically flu. backed enforced federal government.

There seems little point pretreatment though, risk it? start feel like shit, take tylenol it'll knock back hour so, let run course. effects usually immediate either clear pretreatment would even help anything -- time feel 12-24 hours later tylenol long gone. happy cleaner things. good thing, free lunch.

If spent money cleaning things need cleaned failed spend money ventilation (because overspent cleaning) bad thing.

On hand, spent money cleaning things would otherwise awarded executive bonuses good thing.

I sure give confidence take public transit. going easy. going happen anyway unless believe restrictions last forever husband suffering. social isolation bad him. I'm introvert handle better, he's extroverted. see first hand damage does. whole thing sucks good answer. solution except vaccine plus time, *someone* gonna get hurt, question how. guess I'm side shall pass long alive. awesome news five vaccines public results prevented deaths *entirely* vaccine becomes fully effective. I'll little happier confirm vax prevents long term effects like long hauler syndrome etc, I'm hopeful. Nobody reads articles **anymore** even attempts understand something arguing it.

i would argue true since dawn time, display front center upvote/downvote system reddit has. whatever popular gets upvoted top. given majority anything cursory research, even that... well rest self explanatory Lately news good go back time drum fear. argument getting herd immunity backs children repeated often advocate continued school closures. Yea. referenced interview Dr Fauci 7th January.   fine even get boosters every year on. long get normal lifes back soon, minor annoyance. did. shit long term. Government world really anything likes people like me. REALLY matters REALLY change things keep getting there, keep going work, keep getting opportunities. 

Getting sick something (literally) afford. least I'm dead Covid nightmare ends. Yeah like super simple? get vaccinated, weeks second dose, immune, get back life, period? mean, whole point? vaccine far better almost vaccine had? People over-thinking this, over-worrying. true. horrors people actually deciding whether wish leave home. Everyone benevolent government jackboot second Shingles shot kicked butt, I'm surprised. expect one too. get first tomorrow, yipee!!  also TSA exists. would like see logo TGIChilibees. feel like would delightful graphic design Cronenberg stuff. **Right???** feel like I'm taking crazy pills! would wait tomorrow's update. similar pattern last week going 41,411,550 Saturday 41,418,325 Monday, jumped 44,394,075 Tuesday 47,230,950 Wednesday. It's...really cute think media people's best interests mind times. numbers far 0.04% people caught virus week second dose 0.002% needed hospital treatment understand. Moderna may 5 mln. know reliable Astrazeneka. vaccines 2022 Ha, days ago Media qouting month old “We believe things get worse get January,” said. Well objective become television hacks. didn’t specify put category - no, didn’t name names. wouldn’t mind 140% immunity /s There's always chance, we're period big global super spreader events expected (eg: Christmas) vaccines rolling out, downward trend *probably* continue, maybe slight late winter spike unvaccinated people start easing precautions. must admit I'm really following story all. recalled making headlines weeks back.  exactly options dude. 

Like people able go out? Like exactly solutions? Reduced capacity mask mandates work effective enough ""flatten curve"" thing actually agressively worked kinda worked people staying fuck home.

Like know solution tell high risk people get fucked everyone else life lmao. exactly better strategy? Lockdowns evil. depends death counts; COVID gets flu levels (or probably will) things go back normal stay there. never said damn thing opening schools not.

I argued eventually need get vaccinated.

You're argument school openings I'm really interested getting right now. got second dose phizer today. Soo, excited probably gotten pandemic covidfree suggest take step back, take deep breath look actual data. data, gathered 11 months+ months covid, suggest kids age basically zero risk covid. annual flu far greater risk kids covid. 

Remember media good finding amplifying outliers. kid dies covid front-page news incredibly rare.

To deny child ability interact family much, much, much, much, much higher risk activity covid. well established scientific fact, mention common sense, denying kids socialization bad.

If feel bad this, don't. alone. average american [thinks catch covid 10% chance many cases 1000x higher person's actual chance death. Peoples ability assess risk absolutely destroyed non-stop fear mongering media cherry picked doomsday experts. genuinely sorry got sick, cleaning didn’t get sick. Except 25% vulnerable. make enormous factor severe cases, hospitalizations deaths. 

Case numbers meaningless without context. Apparently eating shitty restaurant food able buy stupid consumer shit important human lives. Imagine virus ebola instant kill, they'd wipe everyone go eat Applebee's. It’s question scale. Ramping production cover 300+ million US 7+ billion world one needs stop pandemic. Curing disease million suffer mRNA vaccines used for.

Next pandemic comes, they’ll face choice making grandmas's medicine stopping pandemic. won’t production capability both. “Just time manufacturing” what’s going allow next pandemic circle world. going keep going down. Seasonal respite + cumulative vaccination. Ever heard compassion ? something good community fellow human ? Kant mask Karen’s don’t mask Dave’s ORF8 protein known source severe illness pathogenic symptoms infected. virus perfect, occasionally deletions occur, ORF8 would make infected deletion variant appear asymptomatic milder symptoms. aids virus infect others less detection able use host continue using transcriptional readthrough adaptive advantages. problem this, still add ORF8 protein back anytime. point, may added mutations better infecting humans immune evasion. damn knows get putting used mask ground onto mouth!!!

Covid one least worries, bud. Moderna trial results OMFG needs stop! Long covid fucking scary. Currently one way bubble, New Zealanders able fly without 14 day quarantine Australians, except travel exemptions, unable currently leave Country  attended gathering? here's deserve get covid Fear not. News actually good Israel regarding reinfection (low) reduction cases across tiny country! plus side, everyone eating outside. safer eat inside restaurant /s January get worse? February. Weird link. Anything back statement? past three days now. Guess reached bottleneck supply something Hmm, month two ago everything saying wasn’t good idea immune system would form good response, things may changed. Russia always saying don’t drink vaccine. Russia also went extreme said month half 2 weeks before, pretty ridiculous it’s possible they’re saying excuse case vaccine didn’t work.

It looks pretty divided right don’t drink days after, least definitely heavy drinking, others saying probably won’t matter. would still refrain heavy drinking night 3 days after. symptoms started yesterday tested positive today - small cough mild headache (no fever). sign mild infection? I'm 22. Haven’t weeks. happened lol. got banned saying stuff said today. Well tell congressman vote $1.9 trillion bill. Cleaning doesn’t hurt anyone.

It gives false sense security, like stepmom. battery acid 

Dude nanobots Bill Gates George Soros. Try keep Q saying here! 

/s (just case) oversimplified take inflammation fever body fights infection. certainly common knowledge well, fact think means you’re missing understanding pain anti-inflammatory meds work well vaccine immunity works. article state pain meds decrease effectiveness might people hold know sure. common knowledge, would question right? School science equal medical school. pathway adaptive immunity develops inflammation happen connected way might think. doctors knew ibuprofen anti-inflammatory drugs slowed recovery disease wouldn’t prescribe much sick patients. Fever often consequence fighting infection, benefit fighting reducing fever mean won’t fight disease well. Fauci part January interview. 

“We believe things get worse get January,” said.” tell there's vaccine works fucking amazingly anything positive unscientific. fuck cnn article read new variant bumfuck missouri  Im glad number administered increasing, reached bottleneck supply something? Weve 49.9 mill three days now? guess thats good thing since need use ones weve soon rate going run supply sometime next week. always barely increases weekend. Tuesday Wednesday updates always far biggest. blanket policy, done airport-by-airport. September airports mask mandate. Average r/conservative headline ""But Christakis said long history pandemics indicates relative normality may like years away.""

Ah yes, pandemics throughout history highly effective vaccines developed began mass produced less 12 months. Thanks I’ll see find it. diseases spread surfaces well would potentially put hospital doctors office risk exposing COVID well. Can't happy cleaner things? week week, compared previous days. 

Starting get little pattern high volume days vs low volume days. country recorded 17,584 cases nursing homes week ending Jan. 17, New York Times reported. month earlier, week ending Dec. 20, 32,500 cases reported mean true.... world fair sure shit need come full stop reasons. Everyone impacted orders magnitude insane.

Sorry, worth point. look history [Dengue Fever infection usually good idea.  think NYC smells think roach spray. every tenement building LES. people quote social media posts facts use unreviewed public databases VAERS standards constitutes related death. maybe dangerous lying then, incentivized lie guy office, saying safe order boost economy make Biden look better expense general public's safety. Nasal swabs considered less reliable nasopharyngeal swabs, nasopharyngeal swabs 100% either. people, aerosols greatest hazard. completely eliminate aerosols - looks like well way - fomites definitely something concerned about. think people great hands always advocated strategy keeps transmission rate well 1 else. example, Germany used approach successfully abandoning fall. whatever takes keep r 1, virus contained. That's eradication strategy even absolute eradication never comes. 

Anything else seems irresponsible reasons mention. overwhelming hospitals (or whatever metrics used) allows unlimited incubations (replications, mutations), kind death totals have, prospect things could get much worse. Lol ok bud, literally said EVERYONE get vaccine things going back normal... Biden kiss you, smell sweet sweet child hair. Hi, send modmail! People REALLY need stop going CNN. it’s can’t find good articles seems like 75+ % headlines sensationalized. risky sexual encounters times past 6 months, yet gonorrhea found anyway.  I'm freaking baffled. disease deadly one care efficacy trials, safety ones. aren’t going manage spring summer lockdowns contain virus. likely good don’t overthink I'm amused sentiment negatives, one upvoted.

Best luck family! actually topic wish would talked more. people avoid sick pre-pandemic get bodies readjusted continue avoid illness? matter all? better getting sick? I’m sure studies sort thing, super relevant. old remember vaccines required international travel, think separate sheet kept passport. Certainly Covid first test thing- hope doesn’t extend whole « but got tested irresponsible thing » excuse people often don’t isolate testing, ignore incubation period, ignore possibility false negatives hospitals businesses longer get amount customers due health/safety economic reasons lack tourists abroad. 

So it'll end similar going last 12 months?  Missing point right now. It’s good bad vaccines are.

It getting vaccinated!

Not due deniers, underwhelming production performance. countries grossly behind planned/promised schedule.  That's technically true, doomery also unscientific? point lmao Also 0% death rate need eradicated going incur huge cost? Get yearly vaccine cocktail go life. Oh no, find out, repeatedly testing asymptomatic masses people? Seems reasonable. sure I’m downvoted asking question. People don’t seem know little arrows Dr. Doom says oh no!😆 think we’ll see normalcy, really get vaccine don’t see personally afraid wait allotted time say. There’s lot weird bluster still potential spreader even vaccination much like press you’re immune covid last summer, they’re taking quotes professionals saying “we evidence specially right now” turning “you immune” headlines. I’d say it’s less intimidation thing aggressive social cue. Although laughable $1,500 fine DC wearing mask walking outside. Total Covid theatre that. don’t even need wait vaccine rollout, need stop fearing, take - mild virus leaves 90% people without symptoms, 99.8 survival rate, get back lives destroy every semblance life civilization had. think works, heats outside, core temperature last rise.. does, can't shed heat skin outside already hotter. blame politics. virus politicized, anyone can't see blind. would bet entire life's savings democrats office virus came around, would democrats trying keep things control republicans sounding alarm bells long term effects virus deadliness that, saying democrats fault china ports shut down, dangerous virus people saying fall US cases means vaccines working? agree mention it'll continue throughout tomorrow too. Ugh make feel better, thanks [Pandemic’s deadliest month US ends signs much better negative spin going variants! good news coming AP way better CNN! variants go crazy, sure impossible. Whats likely though current decrease cases slowing plateauing time decreasing again, thanks vaccination + seasonality working us  wanna take chances. look like price actually fully announced. @ current production levels, $30. Andy Slavitt (one covid team members) noted conference Today investment US intended help produce economies scale insinuated price reduce. 

*“The cost come get mass production scale,” Slavitt said, calling new contract initial step solve problem. “We know efforts create even lower cost innovative approaches welcome those.”
* Exactly. want know dinner party 15 friends sitting around table. want know hop plane without thinking twice. 

I personally believe even Herd Immunity achieved 1st world countries still obligation pump vaccines push eradication Covid globally community 70% vaccinated I'm going keep socially distancing communities across ocean still effected Covid. We're not. Remember like last March people washed groceries everything? Yeah lasted weeks.

Can explain theoretical process someone could doxxed clicking link?

The utility linking Google Docs would seem outweigh remote possibility happening. latter written capacity also personally believe data comes lean towards vaccines providing protection also cutting transmission. understand unsettled hypothesis point. can’t fire someone getting vaccine yet approved. vaccine approved us yet. Yes, definitely! follow bunch epidemiologist Twitter surprising much arguing differences opinion are. disagreement expected seem convinced right everyone else wrong.   exactly “semblance” mean? said couple weeks. things personally

3 vaccines. Pfizer, AZ, Moderna make much money delivering less vials thought deaths March 2020, that’s started Danish plan indicates 1,7mill J&amp;J Q2 equivalent ca 23mill Germany. saying given (delivery that) bring Germany fully vaccinated July. good reason hope  impact evident yet. 

get shot try worry it. even flu vaccine mandatory healthcare. COVID vaccine either. Msnbc tend really balance things out. That's follow them.  one shot week highly protected see detrimental relatively long ramp up.  point rough patients building immunity finished yet looks like many employees wont even building immunity along side them.  hope enough nursing home staff already recovered enough covid naturally resistant buffers even taken vaccine. remove it? new reasons. heard new strains? afraid, afraid. also remember lot predictions deaths would practically zero we’d ready fully reopen March.   don’t think people outside internet devoid nuance tbh. testing better joking?

J&amp;J vaccine third class vaccine low efficacy unable stop pandemic. piggybacking comment- completely right. point world already seen worst virus. Day day millions getting vaccinated, squashes cases already. Many countries including US seemed great job getting nursing homes, residences old people. Since nursing homes vaccinated, longer going large strain hospital healthcare systems. uncertainty current understanding Covid.

This deserves upvotes. We're still learning, unreasonable careful. 

My spouse cancer, father 83, MIL 89 bedbound. Swabbing something Clorox wipe one many things help keep safe, COVID things. important thing mean value all. Lower priority mean useless. Sigh. sure. Let’s slow even more. Get shot. Saddle tough out.

Another effect huge waves leaves bunch surviving people immune. undoubtedly another factor.

On top vaccine reaching 10% population many areas. looked subs I’m still sure mean “crazy pro-masker.” help out? That's there's need them. paid well, people would stay jobs would shocked cons came back quickly. Fanime scheduled Memorial Day weekend May year, I'm pretty sure con postponed 2021. Nah get shot. SA/BR variant spike mutations different OG take risk. would love see numbers US states. Nice work. storm really come play tomorrow's numbers. could honestly see like ""whoops, jumped gun nvmd we're back postponed"" **Finnish nurse Sari Roos figured get seven vaccines Pfizer vaccine bottle instead promised five - Pfizer approved hope vaccines antibody therapies do, suspect roar back point without decent R&lt;1 strategy. playing game know rules for, betting like millionaire Playboy.

There many, many scientists, public health professionals, financial analysts, strategy consultants average Joes predicted every phase pandemic, charge, continue blunt reaction instead efficient action. Israel aren’t getting 9k cases/day. ~4-5k cases/day Yeah daily CDC data largely driven NY, CA, TX, FL checking states daily numbers lot better representation least. Like Oregon doubled daily goal 12500 daily doses last 5 days alone. They're Deaths lagging indicator week two. forgot J&amp;J + CureVac.

J&amp;J jas released phase 3 trial data. CureVac deliver phase 3 trial data later Q1. expect used delivered significant amounts Q2. thing worry CureVac deemed unsuccessful, that's unlikely mRNA vaccine good immune response earlier trials.

Merkel expects finished end summer without J&amp;J CureVac. Earlier vaccines course. end summer like worst-case scenario EU. June/July sounds reasonable vaccine herd immunity (70%-85%) EU now. unlucky new variants. transmissible, likely require higher herd immunity threshold (HIT).  amused sentiment negatives, one upvoted.

Yep. [See also Labor Day fight like 10th highest upvoted sorry stepmom got sick Thanksgiving know airborne.

Thanks! shot shot? RNs doctors make decent incomes. Based US government definitions they're even ""high income"". Many RNs make $75,000 cutoff get stimulus check instance doctors make $150,000 cutoff married couple. know mean, Johnson &amp; Johnson South African study group. Efficacy lower 59%, that's still great number. results published available internet Google it...  fatality rate like 5%, higher hospitalized, odds much favor. Good luck. Ideally yes, still widely transmitted decent chance mutations occurring may render vaccine useless. still need reach herd immunity even elders high-risk segments population vaccinated. Yes, wait two weeks second dose. they're able grandchildren hug even point getting vaccinated? look teachers vaccinated time grocery store workers even though teachers remote yep medical grade glass grow trees especially special ones take pfizer temperatures.

ditto syringes including special ones needed suck last dose include recovered Covid, mean almost 20% some/full immunity? think need dedicated thread “major variant” least mega thread dedicated new ones. would lend informing others risks involved kick things ass move on!

Plus tiring seeing posts don’t tell us anything new mutations...  takes 3-6 weeks vaccines fully effect. 54% cases today based level vaccination 3-6 weeks ago etc. CNN Fox News liberals. Well seriously compared Caribbean, yet explosion cases except DR, much milder temperatures rest tropics. prevents death, hospitalization, severe disease. Seems like that's want really high efficacy bonus right surprising good confirm. America requires robust safety efficacy data. China Russia less scrupulous issues. loss sense taste smell matters, governor urged anyone age 65 go get tested feeling least little bit ill receive antibodies test positive COVID.

The West Virginia governor great job. He’s governor noticed reminding people get monoclonal antibody treatments.

West Virginia great job. much expected ill-informed prejudices pandemic. far we're getting Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna rather AstraZeneca. definitely should. Unfortunately nursing home run small profit margins run like private prison systems. fire anyone refuses. negotiable? Well squandared yes, also know. 

Most Europe went almost back normal June September. UK pubs parties rage months without explosion cases. got cold. original strain. I’ve seen numbers low 40-60% Brazilian South African Deaths inoculation, especially seniors, compelling statistic own. compare baseline? causes death related vaccine ""serious basic disorders""? course not, fake documents now. can't compare time technology now. Mark words. Something effect latter written come August September. almost guarantee it. Fair enough. headline wrong, media reports wrong, still see ""left"" issue.

If right-leaning reports focused facts would say left exaggerated right factual. right exaggerates different way. dismiss it, present there, blame China Democrats liberal media. still missing facts.

There simply venue facts. Nobody cares want team win. countries I'm talking mostly tropical, like Caribbean, Africa, Indonesia, SE Asia, Phillipines etc.

If covid got levels first world countries, regardless testing, see hear excess deaths read article also data past year, clear fomite transmission rare. really debate anymore. fomite transmission ""priority"" started labs unrealistic lab tests start pandemic promoted fear virus living surfaces days. studies outside lab, data fomite transmission hard find. excepts ""... handful studies looked viable virus outside lab ... none viral material actually able infect cells, researchers "" researchers struggled isolate viable virus environmental samples, fomites. ""the team estimated risk infection touching contaminated surface less 5 10,000 ... lower surface-transmission risk influenza “Fomite transmission possible, seems rare ... lot things fall place transmission happen.”

Basic hygiene continued carried wash hands often not... but, need wash every fruit purchase, Amazon packages get delivered... Or, even likely ""deep clean"" surfaces (outside hospital setting). pay medicine shit standing rule look took hard job is.

CNA’s get paid shit
RN’s get paid shit
And even Primary Care Physicians get paid shit I’ve heard end summer (so like another 6+ months). 

Regardless, everyone get shots. Take look  Perhaps not, mean try. matter many people virus, bring transmission rate well 1, road eradication. numbers low enough, local outbreaks addressed contact tracing localized lockdowns.

I agree sooner would better, think logic still applies even now. Actually transmission rate places 1 moment. vaccine rollout continues, may another chance soon pursue eradication strategy. may necessary danger mutant strains escaping immunity head Pfizer among others warned.

It's best economy course overall health mortality. Suits rest world EU use AZ.

Some countries seem waiting UK vaccine program provide data AZ older populations, anyone know likely sufficient either prove disprove reticence using AZ older people? 

As far know reason doubt lower numbers older people trials? There's actual proof less redirecting older populations? couple covid related hospitalizations trial arm, exclusively window first second shot. Would approved European regulators I’m sure vaccine creators would able work Yep. add people in-home care, get population people make minimum wage, sometimes speak English, may green card issues, way ""supported."" feature elderly care America. definitely need this. We're basically opening minutes vaccine push. US manufacturing vaccines 100% capacity every possible human Earth vaccinated probably need couple booster shots go that. minimum going last well 2023 ramping production absolutely necessary. vaccines like 3 months away everyone. even shelves soon? tested elderly, none tested infirm. Half Covid deaths nursing homes, vast majority among elderly major conditions. people nursing homes vaccinated now, study results holds true comes much older sicker people studies see deaths halve, nursing home deaths Feb. Sort of, many lower cases Dec/Jan.

The countries I'm talking mostly tropical, like Caribbean, Africa, Indonesia, SE Asia, Phillipines etc. 

If covid got levels first world countries, regardless testing, see hear excess deaths. Getting tested absolutely reduce risk. still people act irresponsibly, minority. lot friends frustrated long gone on, even HOPE gather together safely, big improvement. 

Also think people forgotten goal flattening curve reducing spread, preventing every single case. latter possible, we'll never get risk-free. anything help reduce risks good thing. offer huge pay raises everyone gets vaccine (uninformed) assumption well. vaccines may help well, since immune response already ""optimized"", produce timely appropriate immune response, immune system starts go overkill.

Of course I'm immunologist, epidimologist, doctor, even witch doctor, take assumptions seriously. expectation long term data eventually begin show immunization also helps long term problems. ok got it, apparently english sources way easier find, theres basically nothing german surprisngly. feel articles posted random person died heart attack whatever getting vaccinated. Clearly outlier people love latch scare people away vaccines.  Cut life. worth all. yup totally agree.but people idea covid completely squashed way crushed measles polio US means can’t go back normal, imo you’ll waiting till day u die you’re waiting never covid cases world anymore witnessed first hand. remember sort holiday staying Israel nobody supposed outside homes people saw streets ULTRA orthodox roaming casually policy include them. That's true all. got people living Sweden first hand experience people wearing masks, one misleading fuck leave rest us!

-The  I'm glad swamp end million civil servants who's goal keep lights running regardless who's President. look SA deaths per million still lot countries. Plus whatever reason cases declining right now.

Yes fact summer concerning, super hot could bring people AC indoors would similar effect winter. witnessed US southern surge.

Also, get colds flus lots times one bats eye. prior immunity gives mild infection see different. vaccine numbers tomorrow going pretty screwy yall. NY/NJ getting massive snow storm closing state run vaccination centers awesome news! Honestly, get doses vaccine becomes available everyone wants get one, I’m done. I’m done masking unless it’s absolutely required I’m done social distancing matter Fauci public health expert wants us maintain public health measures lord knows vaccination, says.

That might considered selfish point oh well. I’ve sacrificed much since started lost many important milestones I’ll never get back. Mental health declined ton start taking meds it. miss seeing family. I’m 18 young life want live youth gone. want go real college, make friends memories. re-do high school graduation family since one supposed got snatched pandemic. I’ve followed rules. vaccination, it’s time reward that’s normal life. reports high number vaccinations, would doubt many feel safer.

So, no, models holidays. mean, one say whether UK still part EU, could’ve convinced voted getting vaccines ordered sooner.

And, afaik, country EU could’ve bought vaccines like UK, too, decided that. cost isn’t huge thing either suppliers wealthy nations. Prices could 100x higher vaccination profit maximization. together. NHS responsible vaccine rollouts, still Department Health ministries involved. NHS ones carry procedures, ones organising infrastructure logistics. 

Despite multitude failures government managed achieve last 12 months, would really kill give credit due?  live Germany. people know clue Superbowl is. Germany both. think new plant Marburg coming online March. think J&amp;J may take time ramp up. Johnson received funding develop vaccine US part Operation Warp Speed agreement deliver 100 million doses. company could ship 2 million doses soon secures authorization FDA. detect virus early? Ya know....he Biden’s task force transition.  disband boot Osterholm off?  media instead saying directly to, say, president? I'll believe see it. Vaccination *slowing down* every week, Pfizer shipments getting smaller smaller Moderna still pitifully slow barely increasing, AZ deliver quarter order end March (if fuck production even more, still ""best effort"" code ""UK goes first"").

Additional vaccine types mirage right now, even begun validation yet. take months *if* vaccines even effective.

At least going see meaningful increases well spring, it'll probably summer US UK stop supply-limited buy excess vaccines y'all. see way getting kind massive delivery speedup unless Pfizer massively steps game AZ somehow delivers Q2 promises (either seems highly unlikely right now).  29 states states. found 1 person state variant 10 people it. probably got sequenced COVID before. 

For know 100 people get immunity SA cases region thousands. Maybe try zinc supplement? Someone know taste bounce back days taking zinc lozenges. Take care. hope he's wrong, I've known work since Bio Terrorism Symposium 1999, he's competent. Right US problems Covid tho....

We probably surplus AstraZeneca/J&amp;J one, sure give countries can. purely political analyzes covid data? That's fine... see happens... proof pudding stealing vaccines meant developing nations. Shameful. civil. I'm mod mean uncivil. 

And meaning evolution purpose. random. evolve become less fit. evolves. Lots viruses evolve become less deadly. Don’t really understand reasoning though. goal vaccines arms ASAP. 

If shipment delay, would rather vaccines arms 2+ weeks ago sitting fridge delay.

Throughput #1 goal situation every day without vax could mean life death. Look UK flipping script record numbers! Good y’all! I'm Pittsburgh Pirates fan; go lower? 19 60 games last year, quickly. like far-right Christians COVID deniers. chances catching covid GF tested positive today? We're quarantining together previous days. 4 days away 2nd shot 🥺. Inevitable? We'll probably 65-75m people gotten first dose 30m gotten second dose, 100m doses sure, 100m fully vaccinated probably wait March, especially J&amp;J approved. know much variants holidays, no. reported holidays models taken account. still not. Nothing magical. still think you’re disingenuous. Biden Congress essentially gotten work quickly possible covid relief. Biden can’t mandate checks EO, new congress recently sworn dealt insurrection. Additionally, Warnock Ossof weren’t seated senate day Joe Biden’s inauguration.

Europeans trying convince world aren’t selfish. Good luck that. That's true, Covid still spread quickly summer. straightforward model both. amazing! Meanwhile country(Romania) little number combined now. Surprisingly, number vaccines got altogether I’m sure EU take exception, they’re hiding nowhere think they’ll prize dose vaccine country receiving end 5 years EU hostility - we’ve need is.  beurocracy EU utterly crushing.

Thank much Germany funded research. that’s great, it’s exactly thing funding expansion manufacturing securing production slots. Except true. really fault people like you. Yep. Get ready. summer NHL playing full bubble, Dallas Stars fans building watching games Jumbotron. Completely bizarre.

Interesting read. see quite bit sub. Almost one know real life seem friends family point year. Correct. That's UK restricting export vaccinations. however clearly report restriction vaccines EU.

COVID enter Italy, spread rapidly. Air travel facilitated disease - almost guarantee every patient zero every country affected passenger arriving via plane. Link comment saying please? Funny, becuase two friends grandparents cancelled appointments coming week Madrid.

Madrid announced stopped vaccinating next 10 days. strangely cyclical since march 2020 really beginning beginning changes US start shutting regular life worry. Germany economic powerhouse Europe would seriously doubt wealth higher standards living government fall behind long vaccine programme. Heh, ironically said, would probably take month lockdown well. solid target. 

With British strain real possibility bet Austria thrilled that.   would like defend 'hypothetical' lol. UK choice buying vaccines later date much cheaper price, considering current rates infection COVID related deaths, would chose go immediate expensive route choice. Countries like France Germany afford wait longer get vaccines, especially considering countries hospital bed per 1000 people ratio double UK: .

Look I'm much aware EU schemes general, argue position that, mainly wanted to, would extra research already done getting late here. please feel free enlighten EU schemes general slow penny pinching (hopefully sources time opposed emotive rhetoric). Look, think agree areas, disagree think reason UK's vaccine rollout successful far Brexit. provided evidence willing mind changed.

I completely disagree last point made reasons, feel like last point tangent original topic I'm going leave last one, mainly online lessons 8 hours sadly need sleep (but knowing rest world hailing invaluable contribution fighting COVID makes sleeping part easier). Take care actually 1%. Considering vaccination happens adults, UK 52 mil. Also considering everyone want vaccine, number today absolutely impressive, percentage wise could mean that, sustaining it, less 3 months everyone vaccinated (already huge chunk elderly people vaccinated) Women dont go funerals Jerusalem? Yeah I'm thinking month/6 weeks J&amp;J fully online supply accesibilty might start outpacing demand. Thinking maybe like late April / early May? make fair points, wish easy answer guys gone crazy seriously shit vaccines day day arguments doesn’t tire ? shitty world living DARE SAY FAUCI ALWAYS RIGHT REEEEEE

-Reddit Hey I'm one pandering. sarcastic I'm mad many public officials decided say fuck health guidelines absolutely true also utterly impractical. first point 66% reduction risk catching virus still bring R 1 everyone immunized meaning epidemic end get point, since that's case try get fast possible, means using available vaccines. second point, mRNA lipid nano particles non-trivial biomedical substances, can't force pharmaceutical companies synthesize product capacity produce. Thank parts  much worse. Marginally worse. numbers misleading. OP, supply isn’t everyone yet. I’ve signed 72 year old dad 5-6 different registries weeks ago, calls. County health department, several hospital systems state. He’s overweight diabetes heart condition. get it, worry. makes sense! But... religion! Vastly. 100 million AstraZeneca vaccine, that's almost enough population given requires 2 doses. 40 million Pfizer, 17 million Moderna, 60 million Novavax 30 million J&amp;J. There's can't remember, total we'll 360 million doses 68million people. Safe say, we'll extras. record though, now, they're process delivered manufactured. excess doses atleast September uneducated opinion.

Although, we're supposedly opening new vaccine manufacturing plant June we'll good place help countries later year. BBC News - Covid: New variant found ‘due hard work UK go.

Theres common statistic mentioned Reddit lot, one site Wales sequencing per week France since last March. article says covid related deaths vaccine group. Nope. Highest single day far 5.7L every week it’s ramping up. Pfizer deliveries getting smaller shot term get bigger April AZ subcontractors issues AZ UK plants set 9 months ago (which UK engineers earlier month)

Pfizer guaranteed Q1 total delivery EU schedule change heavier later quarter allow produce 2 billion doses year SA also 100k excess deaths. Check also least 170k excess. Things seem. Rapid tests vs PCR? ran genome PCR test? domestic production. Relying imports, losing strategy.

If Canada approached AZ last year offered pay $100m set domestic production, lots countries well did, problem there'd tons vaccine now. responding article discussing wealth measured income per capita total GDP. vaccinate elderly, might save lot money pensions paid people die. I'm doomscrolling, friend. asked question gave answer. I'm sorry satisfaction. record, house basement. like built entire imaginary person around answer.

Are okay? likely COVID going become seasonal like flu. 

And like flu, yearly vaccines given population. could’ve come back negative might’ve done covid test late, far I’m aware, covid test within five days symptoms starting they’re accurate done temperature deny hypothetical. UK EU, would fact broken EU rollout purchasing strategy. evidence none EU countries did!

The scheme typical EU scheme. Slow, penny pinching, beaurocratic. UK broke away reason, proved right. UK failed rollout compared EU, reddit would absolutely ragging Brexit day night, humbly use moment opposite.

This top contributing country US toward development vaccines themselves. countries duck cover get hailed successful fight virus, UK US actually solving it. Without profit-driven corporate biomedical system, everyone earth would gotten virus eventually, US UK going end it. incredibly low cost total Pfizer even really making profit contribution all. ought much appreciative grateful US UK who, said done, hope hailed countries contributed fight covid. Teachers phase 1b everywhere... Perhaps 1a states Pneumonia covid 100 years old. makes through, Captain Sir enough. They'll create new title him. long time yet don’t think.

Global rollout take years knows mutations could happen meantime.


(I hope I’m wrong) No, extremist subsect ultraorthodox, recognize Israel, hardly recognize healthcare system (only going hospitals deathbed) much anti vaxx. Heaven forbid people want spend entire year stuck home. though. People would rather try stay home months go let virus spread. Australians selfish lot people around world, generally look other. asked stay home really punishment. could still go shops, go exercise, et cetera. exactly 'homejailed'. heard interview Fauci earlier today said double masking data indicates going make current outbreaks New Jersey New York also started Orthodox Jewish communities refusing follow rules exact sort shit. I’d argue que thing myth mostly since it’s old getting vaccinated doubt old grannies loving opportunity go little chat people line People usually don’t advertise it... *UP TO* 12 weeks really. £500m odd gamble, good science. 

It's like betting 50p, 1 5 chance winning £100. 

You'd mad take it. 

COVID economically damaging, lump sums literally nothing grand scheme things. 

A vaccine could cost $100 dose it'd still worth it. Let’s see J&amp;J executives take shot camera instead Moderna/Pfizer. wont it’s pretty obvious it’s dollar store knockoff reserved poor people. They're probably trying buy goodwill future negotiation. think advance reports UK economic performance forecasts next year seen senior officials they're getting major headaches.
It also help current variant COVID rampaging EU right originated UK.  Ooh, vaccines South snowing? 😇  guys (an extremist subsect ultraorthodox) even recognize Israel avoid hospitals deathbed. accept vaccination all. Depends lot factors. I’m sure I’m knowledgable enough subject give definitive answer. alas, vaccines best bet BR/SA strain appear behind UK strain. get either way prepare one worry others later. 

If Europe recommending N95 equivalents ordinary citizens, upgrade masks KN95 least half face respirator. R0 around 8.55 now, means every person average infect 8.5 people themselves. truly test us defining moment “turning point war.”  That's fair point. rapid rollout mass vaccination pandemic unprecedented. Anything could happened. Honestly old almost makes sense isolate. Basically anything kill age risk going Barbados much risk nothing. Jackson tested negative COVID several times admitted UAB Hospital Jan. 22, wife said. Last week, learned tested positive new variant COVID-19 that’s believed transmit easily person person.

How test negative several times? wish information. reason variant show positive. Well studied Economics Cambridge I'd say reasonably well versed whether academic ability not. limited sample academic ability number one prerequisite. saying rich friends high places hurt. Given teachers many areas next, healthy adults follow, I’m inclined agree  You’ll get shot right inevitable. boyfriend never got it. 3 people house didn’t get either Hopefully exercise speed recovery. I’d imagine London result demographics, leans younger rest country less people target groups, % total population look low, % target groups probably look okay. didn’t fund BioNTech one, would gladly paid hundred dollars parents vaccinated month earlier options. 

They save price gouging patented drugs. Covid vaccines costs quite reasonable. Pretty much, yeah. 

If get normal 2021 summer, rest EU doesn't, pretty much Brexit legitimised good idea. 

Imagine much money people going spend summer. They're going go mental. economy going roaring. need 100% reach herd immunity. right theres enough go around want get way plenty people want it. going Canada? a-holes enjoy benefits. 

kinda, pretty extreme well, even though many live extreme poverty accept Bituah Leumi money benefits. also ran parallel home care hospitalization system avoid Israeli hospitals got overwhelmed. still running 'forced' ship many severely sick hospitals.

Obviously still enjoy Israeli infrastructure, healthcare pressed, security provided Israeli police armed forces. guess is, substance injected, needle itself. ""Please ignore deaths behind curtain go back normal"" --1wjl1 Dead god, please let pandemic over. public public 323 days, getting old. prefer swimming pool June, swimming vaccines seems uncomfortable single 3rd world countries mutations?

There mutation UK dont forget. 

Once we've done UK - help others   I'm surprised conciliatory non-jingoistic UK government being. Though quote Napoleon, ""Never interrupt enemy making mistake"". case California speculation another equally infectious variant though would prevent domination UK strain California. elderly whopping 25x likely get young people are. here! pray everyday father gets vaccine, really care I'll get vaccinated long get it. No, it’s fine. need everyone get vaccine get one, that’s get herd immunity. downvoting censorship. /s. think mid-late February hospitalizations deaths begin plummet think people home feel like ton changed till March April. 

February starting hours US probably 10-20% way need vaccine distribution. Finally! 12 weeks fine address though paper comparing California, Florida England numerically find significant differences much time ""bake"" California displacing variants there, Florida introduced later successful. speculate bit different possible causes, one thing mention B.1.1.7 may much transmissible, maybe transmissible all, we're seeing mutations spreading random chance. depends, ultraorthodox split large ""streams"" smaller sects. small sects usually anti vaxx, large streams ordered get vaccinated leaders first weeks actually beating secular public vaccination rate 60+. However even larger streams keen getting younger folk vaccinated (under 60). EU kind power, Poland Hungary would feeling cold hard boot heavy sanctions authoritarian regimes. sanctions require unanimous consent - can't get Poland Hungary covering other.  rest UK much less done care homes, today. Technically, virus nose means infected. Vaccines developed prevent infection. remarkably effective preventing disease. Important difference. think that’s you’re getting at, wanted clarify “infected” usage. 🙄 Try reading issue. still appears pretty short article several paragraphs long true. studied Economics Cambridge. spread rich poor pretty representative society. One guy course misspelled 'Economics' application accepted - rich. News 11: Countries Develop Vaccines, Use First There’s also element luck AZ worked well/easier mass produce. lot U.K. eggs basket didn’t live expectation would different story. Well US government funded these, can’t exactly price gouge us. circumventing ban disinformation? Well Serbian Orthodox church Montenegro, yes higher-ups died too, getting infected funeral. think started Mulroney 90s. Liberals time correct haven’t. speed vaccines get approval. Man, imagine Pfizer comes “this vaccine cure ED make grow inch”

Men flocking get vaccine! fuck talking about? Politicians? idea happy statements make me. I’ve nothing dread past year knowing would ever end I’m glad we’re finally here. can’t wait travel go live concert first time. took life granted can’t wait till get chance live again. hope first time Hey! I'm administrator I'm sorry gone through. I'll PM details, I'd happy talk finding better employment. always need good teachers pay good work.

We similar experiences different perspectives. worked really hard, showing in-person almost every day, create COVID-19 safety protocols supported best available science reviewed staff transparency. offer mental health services hold mindfulness sessions place professional development every week. offer ADA accommodations staff law granted accommodations 15% staff. teachers still come back, although would like return support vulnerable populations, works 2-5 students per class. extremely lenient expect teachers students year. Flexibility important mindset.

Still, given this, encountered teachers disingenuous intentions union great support teachers times times played politics detriment students virtual learning accessible. really frustrating. I'm sure frustrations much worse sounds like taking unnecessary risks health. I'd love chat experiences. PM incoming. Hope gets well. Must caught vacation Barbados unfortunately Yeah would definitely way internal political pressure opposition UK, mean already loads (which went quiet). 

But it’s bit moot hadn’t left probably wouldn’t Tory majority, kind impossible know - say. subsect Ultraorthodox recognize Israel, pay taxes also accept government money aid even run home hospitalization system overwhelmed two weeks ago started shipping patient severe condition near death hospitals en mass.

They also anti vaxx... Well one... mean we’re 1.5 million currently supply rapidly increasing J&amp;J Novavax approved soon. I’d consider failure aren’t 2.5M feb 21st. “If [AZ] gave assurances made reasonable best efforts supply EU fact diverting material one place another, would face potential breach obligations use reasonable best efforts,” told Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said, “There binding orders contract crystal clear,” said. “AstraZeneca also explicitly assured us contract obligations would prevent contract fulfilled.”

I disappointed contract clearer, equating ""best effort"" ""first come, first served"" seems highly disingenuous quite possibly breach contract (which EU arguing). courts settle matter (unless AZ decides start shipping amount doses per capita EU UK). Rumour China getting majority first production plant. 

Q2 deliveries EU 75m, BioNTech press release claims 175m per quarter capacity plant. 

Oddly, press release early December saying BioNTech signed deal China 100m doses. 

And guess EU ordered doses supposed made factory? Yeah, guessed it. January 8th, month China. 

I predict journalists notice weeks time, it'll become scandal. Watch papers. 

(Bonus points, EU paid fucking factory upgrades haha..) exception Pfizer/BioNTech, US invested lot money at-risk fund early research development major vaccines. UK bit AZ/Oxford EU lot less except BioNTech. Even Sanofi got huge amount development US. Vaccines risky venture pay manufacturer succeed, basically taking pregnant lol would like US given 598,389 vaccinations day. countries limited many doses make/give day. makes sense per capita this. task force ended transition. I’m way criticising UK vaccine rollout, fact would praise it. whole point reason UK’s success Brexit. France/ Italy/ Germany joined scheme placed order negotiated individually UK had, would are. Similarly, joined EU vaccination scheme, would choice EU btw, would situation right now. reason countries position joined scheme. 

For less major countries EU, makes complete sense joined scheme. also makes sense UK choice, wouldn’t: cases wayyyy high spreading faster EU countries. new variant really fucked us choice go expensive quicker option.

Either way, news worthy relieved happy about, there’s need bring Brexit it. It’s testament NHS. also don’t let distract us massively fuck rest COVID response. Well, California variant found samples last July Los Angeles, really anything started surging November, shot big percentage samples tested. last surge overwhelm system, yes, matter even they've around Cedars-Sinai Medical Center Los Angeles found although strain barely detectable early October, accounted 24% roughly 4,500 viral samples gathered throughout California last weeks separate analysis 332 virus samples culled mostly Northern California late November December, 25% type. first seemed extremely emotional attack AstraZeneca, Brussels threw company fact invested €300m (£265m; $364m) help develop vaccine produce mass reality, Brussels yet hand substantial lump promised amount.** contract 

Section 7.2(a) **requires Commission pay two thirds initial funding within 5 days start contract.**

**Section 7.2(b) requires Commission pay remaining one third initial funding within 20 days start contract**. Section 7.2(b) one redacted parts **The Commission yet disburse entire €336 million — there’s still “good chunk” left,** one EU official said, “not cents.” Another Commission official said Commission “chase” company get refund. 

(28th Jan).. would appear EU *haven't even paid up* yet order (cheap non-profit) vaccine, despite seems breach contract stipulations payment windows 'reasonable best effort' support EU.. that's r/choosingbeggars type behavior. 

Whereas UK signed contract months earlier invested (and provided) far EU vaccine development per capita 

they also approved rolled earlier, despite early AZ shipments also cut UK (by almost 90%) -- far cut EU! 

 course nobody EU cared AZ shortages UK (or Biontech/pfizer shortages), shortages occured EU, there's outrage 'unfair treatment' even though nothing intentional personal EU still going get full order amount-- plus reported problem mostly solved going forward. (Yesterday's news) Similar story pfizer/Biontech. 

One things sure drama, pandemic last time company agree try develop deliver products EU, perhaps anywhere *at profit* , simply worth headache. Someone hook link freedom surrendered? Maybe happy little bunny hooping around field, much rational human being. That's honestly best news I've heard ages! Thanks mate. Didn’t get eliminated shortly too? Amazing supportive people athletes delaying seasons industry's workforce protest rebel order keep safe. need get facts straight double masking. lot comments say stuff like ""Oh, they're telling us need wear two masks now? end?"" Here's Fauci actually know tough enough get people wear one mask, lot made potential double masking. believe people double masking? would take word 'should' say CDC recommends wear mask. lot people putting two masks. I've done myself. reason is, common sense say physical barrier, maybe I'd feel comfortable. reason CDC changed recommendation scientific evidence say two better one. person wants put two masks, see reason tell to. thought government contract size job EU pissed, UK would receive 0 doses (exactly none produced UK, made germany/switzerland/elsewhere).

The Phizer supply chain goes 10 countries, including UK processing done. everyone starts cutting everyone else would quickly learn terrible idea Ugh, that’s frustrating. Good news is, next. mom got lucky- California decided last minute lower 65. Especially FEMA involved. Remember Alex Jones’ obsession “FEMA Camps”? i'm jealous countries smart manufacture distribute vaccines within borders. country (Canada) lead pretty boy moron. Sure, also take account 60% US overweight 40% obese. Higher BMI documented increase hospitalisation deaths several fold. 

It’s reason don’t see catastrophe unfolding South Asia Africa like what’s happening US. hope that’s true. Hold horses buddy. Barely anyone complete vaccination yet. None general public high risk even first dose. true covid fine high risk, still kills healthy young people.

Restrictions lifted number deaths new cases falls enough. People might “get it” won’t serious cases. pneumonia, system couldn’t handled stress vaccinated, too. got covid test months ago National guard helping checking people telling us drive, yeah plenty ways help Canada got zero vaccines America waiting months, thanks Donald Duck banning exports.

Of reasons pissy [REDACTED], really one them. There's reason exporting vaccines domestic demand far exceeds production capability. Even vaccine hoarding explained time gaps shipments vaccinations, lack demand. Seriously...

Another bullshit appropriation social cause wickedly balling corporation promote progressive.

Employees still struggling survive shit wages. think known. Either way, would high level protection. boring here, new hobby showing crush covid. nsw 4 times, vic twice, sa twice, queensldand twice. WA, wanting left fun lockdown decided covid crush start vaccinating. /s Yeah. really wish testing little simplified. know fairly straightforward is, neck woods, need schedule drive thru CVS, usually 3 days out. also require stick nose clerk watches behind drive thru window.

I know larger drive events, far away. “Journalism” believe companies promises keeps quiet lowering promised shipments 61% last minute. weird vaccine trails accidents like half dose first shot enough old participants fully convince experts around globe. 

Not EU better... former presuming get reinfected, assuming conclusion family safe. could reinfected spread it. chances low, zero. different infections. know asymptomatic carrier. instance, immune system largely operates body may prevent infection there. nasal path ways infected less protections. enough virus build nose shed, spread.

An epidemiologist talked bill nye's podcast month ago. know safe. might be. better wear mask. know Putin allowed talk press anymore. think 4 day work week would good, doubt American companies/bosses would ever go large scale. pace US pretty good. 1% eligible population (adults) every 2 days. bad can't cancer instead making cash cow....I trust government. I'd rather see safety trials done abs 100 percent safe proven. Everyone goes hoax hurry vaccinate said hoax... one belive virus real belive way went half trials cures vaccine go through.. abs easy cheaper cancer aids treatments bad cure.. Well I'm one places locked eradicate, experiences may differ certainly. Maybe misunderstood, giving employees extra 4 hours pto offset it. responsibility others help end pandemic. What? UK keeps current pace, we'll adults vaccinated early July. know kids situations, definitely need school person. I'm opposed opening schools right supports, mess I've seen supports place. time I'm frustrated worried back, especially pregnancy, also way better kids family circumstances they'll fine regardless. year sponsored robotics school 6 sometimes get many kids fit traditional ""smart kid"" stereotype love build things team they're necessarily someone would made athletics team love it. new principal may try help find creative ways fund expand next year, I'm excited like light distance calling forward.

I'm still them, feels like I've chewed spat year. I'm trying let make give up. Thanks listening vent try let worry show kids putting somewhere helps. outside 10 minutes get frostbite.

Blizzards really super cold. hard move around. 

When can't drive takes fifteen minutes trudge two blocks snow, everything grinds halt. Doubtful. look good government stop vaccinating people export worldwide means continuing strong restrictions.

We'll start exporting them, population covered imo. get enough, that's different story, think they'll want stick 2 million week target atleast. Wouldn’t natural selection let everyone live lives whatever happens happens? That’s bad Either way lmao could have, politicians would joined scheme, essentially pass buck blame something goes wrong. French president talking press Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine unsafe elderly. 10/10. healthy, 65 year old work home, hoping late march early april eligible get vaccine june start living life again. That’s good One 2nd dose already, 2 jabs early January December scheduled end March (Pfizer vaccine). I’m sure others 12ish weeks away. get this. Chin up. [Hello New York! means people stop listening restrictions mandates. clearly means covid19 causes pneumonia, test... Sorry, generally allow opinion pieces.

*If believe made mistake, please [message moderators](/message/compose?to=/r/Coronavirus). Please include link submission.* aware US 5 times many people, obviously vaccinate more? point asinine. Effectively care home residents Northern Ireland vaccinated end December.

/u/scottishiain2 bit mark make less dead. cares think anything, fuck ‘em. They're making vaccine profit - fuck would make contract would allow EU hold barrel?

It's best reasonable efforts contract every universe makes sense, make sense ghastly shrill euro-karen history avoiding blame, avoiding blame.

[Don't believe me? Germans also think pile shit.]( European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen trying get firing line anger grows EU's botched vaccine rollout. first time career sought evade responsibility. absolutely stunned negligent Ursula von der Leyen overseeing start vaccinations recent months,"" says Lars Klingbeil, general secretary Germany's Social Democrats (SPD).

You accuse nationalism? I'll tell - go UK subreddits see angry many people wanted remain EU are.

We exact opposite nationalists.

We know disgusting smear see one. Ah gotchu. shame they'll get elected people crying Facebook ""freedom movement means go Cuba winter!!!""  make anything. export raw materials get thoroughly fucked import export politicians incompetent decades. Preclinical Phase 1 testing showed produced high levels antibodies neutralize virus. Saw news headline said ""the worst yet come "". feel like they're saying every month now. I'm starting wonder media made much worse needed be. read article ambulance stuck snow 6 vaccination doses? Took 45 minutes find Americans traffic jam actually wanted vaccine?!?! goals showing honest. far seen proof claims.

I could ask question, keep insisting know right?.

You seeing conspiracies secret goals pointing truthful part sweden mask free. showed proof, showed nothing far. Thanos Captain Sir Tom Moore? 7 day average cases back November really bad. It’s coming insane high falling cliff.

We gotta hope get enough vaccinated possible mutations start increasing rate new cases opinion couple weeks ago, circumstances different changed opinion. problem us teachers union moving goal post saying go back even vaccinated. assert go back children vaccinated well. I'm sure much water hold seems issue directly affect left public health authorities.  


Also, growing body evidence suggest spread schools lower surrounding community spread. Bars open, restaurants open. Kids abused abusers getting away yet can't restricted/limited reopening schools despite evidence showing done safely. priorities society wrong here.

Look, sending back many children can't socially distance would wrong time. Allowing children remain in-person wear mask social distance would wrong time. Fortunately, public officials (less school board union), research, state local health department directors, districts around us shown done safely. Fingers crossed get see thing happening reverse btw March 7th thru 17th (although realistic think return normal slower steady across coming months) two, one speck, J&amp;J due course apparently manufacture here. North American throwing shade Australia!? Lol goes back four basic things talked paper cumulative time, distance, ventilation masks. think four factors four different quadrants, you’re failing two those, that’s going become high risk transmission,” Sills said. “I always talked big three, was: meeting, eating greeting.” US vaccinations concern vaccines aren’t proven work unless proper spacing dose 1 dose 2 followed. Many countries going forward this, Pfizer Moderna don’t guarantee vaccines work spacing. Question small number states Things tended change Boris caught it. Big r/realitycheck there. 


Still mental mixed messaging half assed lockdown measures. Schools closed Day Care centres still open etc. 


Do anything break cycle, commit properly. country delayed 'minimise impact economy' - how's working now!?! work major healthcare provider even they’ll provide UPTO going get it. coworkers even holding getting vaccine reason. right hoping see information. heard somewhere Pfizer less effective, may drop 95- maybe 90. lets see studies first too. NHS, military logistics older population trust vaccines. typically get annual flu jabs. suspect vaccinated priority groups start ship out. much pressure help poorer countries ethically right thing (I think).

I mean getting vaccine would relief (especially 5th test - negative persistent cough work happy it) time suspect playing hell area world simply unable testing. dailymail.co.uk may reliable may dedicated mostly political coverage, post automatically removed. possible, please re-submit link reliable non-political source, reliable news organization recognized institution.

I'm sure keep place queue vaccines we've already immunised entire population unless contracts stipulate take given time. point I'm really really really curious goal here? expending much energy this? hoping achieve? we’re not. would take year two reach herd immunity rate.  worst get someone knows yet continues life normal. live isolated place whole pandemic confirmed cases March December around 20 total.

Nobody Australia expecting continue like forever. ideal.

The vaccines work well. rest world vaccinates numbers going down, Australia vaccinates immunity increase. point hit balance risk smaller sacrifice. Biontech German company decided join forces Pfizer lack resources conduct clinical trials, manufacture etc. families split across countries did, read contract tabloids. period hes infectious would shorter less potent (if makes sense). personally would pretty much put risk 0. probably likely catch another source gym him.

Does mean make friends Explain mean. odds hit 100 mil vaccinated end February? warp speeds original goal. pace we'd hitting like 60mil still good grandad received first vaccine yesterday he's 98... many many calls asking he'd get it. Thanks I'd rather get higher quality mask read contract?

Sure, suppose strategy might make sense temporary measures waiting vaccines. Remember guys, race country, continent whatever vaccinates people first.

This race us together stopping deaths! ""Preparing"" would done long announcement, reacting preparing. Even ""the big one"" shops still open. already have. Yesterday fewest new cases since early-mid November. (And track even fewer cases today) 7 day average dropped peak three weeks ago 100k. rate going well probably approaching degree normality Mid-late March lot people get go process compared vaccine

I'm still getting point. one person either way? Seems like treatment give sick opposed vaccine everyone fewer doses. Oh irony  think force them. also vaccine developer agree cooperation (see Novartis producing Pfizer/Biontech). Using vaccination rate primary sole metric reopening would ridiculous (especially people throwing around figures like 80%).

The goal isn’t automatically reaching certain percentage vaccinations — goal reducing cases/hospitalizations/deaths sustainable point health care systems aren’t risk overwhelmed. get 20% 50% whatever, policy makers still insist 80% vaccination rate (or whatever) reopening, they’re effectively holding people who’ve vaccinated hostage haven’t.

Vaccines means end — “zero Covid” end, “world without death” end, “mitigating public health risk” end. Yeah, wtf, whole ""article""?  actually got nasty nasty case strep like week things shut US. remember basket masks waiting room people vaguely encouraged wear them. asked doctor get covid test laughed They've even potentially made big mistake too. delay second dose potentially meaning nobody immune allowing virus continue spread encourage adaptations. Hopefully see infection rate drop quickly start proper vaccinations ""Imprisoned every citizen"" ""abolished basic human rights"" LOL. rubbish.  approval Johnson Johnson's vaccine, likelihood least one more, mitigate even Pfizer Moderna ramp production- believe will. think give surplus Commonwealth countries Europe South America. vaccines still work, maybe slightly effective; however, mRNA ones modified accordingly strains. media though borderline fear mongering views clicks. used think absurd I’m certainly convinced recognize growing poverty unstable home life sucks ass schools vital kids situation?

Yeah sounds super problematic. really understand angry.  


I 'fucking problem' really need swear. nothing add suggest comment. !RemindMe 1 Month  disagree part. point exactly. sheltered. Imagine Brisbane siege. animals would act. want red flag sense community, look panic buys  imagine point, there's also potential COVID vaccine become yearly one like flu vulnerable individuals based new strains making existing vaccines potentially less effective. case we'll need limited vaccination programme come Winter.

Canada getting vaccines different plants US. Canada getting Moderna Switzerland via Spain Pfeizer Belgium. help keep slashing shipments. Quebec officially ran vaccines today. 

Hope approve AZ J&amp;J soon, pretty clear Pfizer Moderna prioritizing us. QUESTION NARRATIVE Praying ya man. Get well! close them. sold them. Sanofi owns it, asked make whatever vaccines there. Someone removed comment, I'll go again.

There WAY untested vaccine go millions people. They've already dealing misinformation much testing done original vaccine. 

What see online trial 400 people needed. take least two months.

If really significantly different, we'd need go whole vaccinate everyone circus again. takes 7-8 lot people get go process compared vaccine get everybody already give immunity quickly course example anecdotal. visit elderly relatives neither died.

And risk death year. taken 1 month since xmas elderly relatives get vaccinated. risk death time frame 1%. less 1% chance may die vs risk lifetime guilt killed relatives could see one month earlier. 

You're also forgetting one significant statistic. pass virus relative might kill. people may pass to. that's viruses work. might responsible one death hundreds maybe thousands. worry able spend xmas elderly relative could result thousands people never getting see relatives again.

Selfish. Best hope for, tbh. give news media clicks. Oh sorry confusion part. Yes. lose neither. Fever immune system raising temperature attempt make inhospitable infection.

The idea infection die do

A blocked runny nose mucus system going overdrive trying destroy infection 100% behind current theory they’re saying: bigger chance contracting virus J&amp;J vaccine versus Moderna/Pfizer 60ish versus 90ish... 

So ~10% chance getting Moderna/Pfizer **but get it, doesn’t seem much mitigation severity disease.** Meanwhile get ~30% chance J&amp;J, claiming **100%** end hospitalized severe COVID.

But ya don’t like sort “100%” claims, think already know typed above, rest question: don’t know exactly exactly quantify severe COVID vs severe COVID. lackluster cytokine storm? ARDS double pneumonia? weaker inflammation markers? entirely sure.

Regardless, even mitigated severity even slightly, worth IMO. spent 11 days inpatient getting whatever vaccine available ASAP fuck risk reinfection getting new variant. anyone Serbia? country bought Sputnik Sinopharm, using Serbia example. What's situation there? far EU purchased vaccines CureVac. thing vaccines exported EU approved it.

Vaccines exported since approved country. chaos sells.  England finished care homes iirc. can’t possibly say media acting responsibly since March 2020 Came say this. need vaccines, there's much already yes does, knowing infects people main knowledge helping us shape precautions. dont agree closing small shop, think people masks safely share space short while... go skiing, skiing areals closed... simply ok goverment close everything people meet even vwry briefly. Politicians make laws please long constitutional. tonnes experts outside Sweden telling wrong.

The health authority legal power. 100% advisory advice dismissed conflicting reality rest world.

Youre head honcho said wont second wave. Brazil South Africa strains stop air travel vaccines fuck wonder many Canadians received first dose Saturday?  Texas big. guy group VA drove 80 miles twice week therapy. even paid mileage. case-control study exposures among children aged 0 18 years (n = 154) without (n = 243) SARS-CoV-2 infection Mississippi found attended gatherings social functions outside home well visitors home associated increased risk infection; however, in-person school attendance 14 days prior diagnosis not.5 fall 2020, 11 school districts North Carolina 90 000 students staff open in-person education 9 weeks.6 time, within-school transmissions rare (32 infections acquired schools; 773 community-acquired infections) cases student-to-staff transmission.

Open schools. Here’s thing whenever debates. seems I’m always told Covid simultaneously safe enough absolutely open now, also dangerous enough can’t wait vaccines variants ruin them. gods sake, asking open morally different people demanded reopening May. states what's source? Bloomberg tracker slowest state Idaho 6.76 doses per 100 people Yep totally civilian...the military doesn’t make anything.  right. Trudeau could paid negotiated better terms, like Israel did. 

For reason chose - that's manufacturers' fault.    I'm saying otherwise. I'm disagreeing commenter thinks doses per vial= vaccinate quicker. Compleatly forgot Sputnik V, apologies late. That's whole point. act horse bolted, second wave 100% predictable. That’s subtlety different idea might better, perhaps they’re complimentary. could decent sized core group full time members much larger group “reservists.” article seems imply mild infection. 

If SA variant ends being, worst, common cold prior immunity, really much problem? UK done 71m tests. closest UK France 42m tests.

The UK quite literally smashing rest world, ways. 

It's also done 50% entire world's sequencing, (why UK variant discovered, though likely came Belgium).

Unfortunately UK bad death numbers, given virus arrived months earlier UK China announced virus existed, given geopolitical nature, population density compared Europe, status transport hub, etc. predicted people start. lack things really well. (admittedly things could better, learning game) fun catching Amazon variant Arethey vaccinating british people Astra Zeneca vaccinations meant EU? Coroma spreads meaning measures useless. Corona slows spread, measures work. last months Sweden 100% failure. Others failed harder. Nope, 750k year day atm, it’s pretty insane compared last year virus changes answers plain simple. magnitude cheaper

Not all. AZ dose costs 2$, AFAIK BioNTech dose much less 200$ (which would two orders magnitude). Hah, look back summer seemed last forever. choice I'd always wanna there, best days life!

Wait, Summer 69... Substitute black Palestinian. That's true. states 3% deserve fuck prison time sucked China dick idea, sounds completely possible given level stupidity vaccine preparation planning got? Trying ad hominim change subject? work pr newswire one ones? One vaccination schedule USA considered, follow, prioritize people likely spread COVID. would potential benefit, increase immunization among people likely spread COVID.  600k one day? Something doesn’t seem right. Canada ~28k vaccines per day total 1million far. UI saying 930k one day? actually ui achieved total count 930k yesterday? think J&amp;J, immediately associate cancer talc powder law suits. Germany took hundreds ICU patients France, Netherlands, Italy neighbors first wave, think Portugal bit far transport large numbers. Instead, German sent military hospital beds equipment doctors Portugal. Thanks, there’s lot people involved it’s rewarding lovely something helpful moment. love it! think aimed shambles test trace operation UK, outsourced run private companies instead local councils / NHS. vaccine operation organised NHS amazing job! Isnt Netherlands country properly train nurses giving 6x correct dose while? 6-14 weeks says article like 5 lines says it’s since October. Nobody knows think anymore. union wanting work, surprise. Also, Sputnik V (produced locally União Química), though receive EUA Brazil (because vaccine go local testing) delivering number doses ordered. sides transaction good 6 doses per vial measurement. hard understand anybody get contracted buy simply vials doses expected. Never heard thing. That's definitely true likes Eton, gain access Oxbridge graduate without significant academic ability.  have, EU forced countries use buying scheme.

France, Germany, Italy, Spain Netherlands orders place.

The EU forced cancelled re-negotiated EU get better deal.

Months went EU secured deal before. Except much later.

As result, EU paying double price UK, secure priority delivery due late party. so? matter. ridiculous upset every seat sold. airline wants stay business can't half seats blocked off. simply viable financially. it’s security guard hotel, possibly still local transmission think it’s them, others all

And think that’s true psychotic Karens assorted morons meltdown poor Target employee whatever asked please follow mask mandate?

Anti-maskers legitimately fucking shot killed people asking comply mask mandates. 1000 times worse Redditor wet blanket type. thing hyper smell taste covid? I’m sick something everything smells tastes x100 usually does. Fauci always reliable source information, completely correct point. J&amp;J vaccine provides high degree protection moderate severe cases 100% effective preventing hospitalizations deaths. also lot easier distribute Pfizer / Moderna since need kept cold single dose.

The J&amp;J vaccine needs approved distributed ASAP. Ps, chap disagrees adult population. Sorry confusion. Idaho embarrassment. three people can't even vaccinate properly. alternative hypothesis would takes long time get going like original strain lights out. agency headed civilian funds civilian companies develop technology military use. Case point. Man JnJ boys really pushing PR machine.  EU already backed said UKs supply completely unaffected NI border thing, nothing suggested happening Well, plan B. bought doses several overseas vaccines 2020. serious somber topic, mean make light it.

Also country less compared UK pull r0 down. Bottom line pandemic likely ending US soon. one wild card South Africa strain remains seen bad that's going be...  keep up, we're going soon. get one third half population vaccinated, see cases going dramatically.

Exactly. People acting like bad news. good news since means UK variant scary making be. makes sense, logically kinda know that. days harder others. Especially inconsistent/unclear info media. Thanks internet stranger. would say one serious enough. second time perpetuated this. totally incorrect. little research spewing hurt.

Here's [AZ scroll page 36, see participants ranged 4 weeks 12+ weeks doses. data longer dosing schedules, know effective longer wait (up 12 weeks least). EU recommended vaccine based dosing schedule 4-12 weeks spacing. Thanks, Buddy. Awesome articles. You’re best Curevac produce around 15 million vaccines EU per month, March June , scale significant afterwards. EU choses use ""Option"" buy 425 million Vaccines (preorderd 200 
million), deliever 300 million end year. 
Until vaccine get approved likely least take June. 
Thats said, mean AZ started November produce vaccine ready delivered, around 130 millionen ( Q1) everything would gone planned. 4 weeks anounced could deliver 31 millionen Q1 ensured EU could least deliver 80 millionen. don`t take anything granted since recent happenings. question responded asking China wealthy country. question income. two separate things. Good luck. parties sure...but nothing like would normally be. serious note though explain Scotland far behind? care homes excuse work anymore done 95% care home residents staff 9 days ago. US almost certainly 10 doses per 100 people point. 1.3 million shots reported Sunday.

All things proven effects consistent new lockdowns Yes What's hard imagine people looking data thinking ""Well still think safe"" (if data indeed shows safe). Yeah, like 10 placebo group died. That's enough make sort high confidence assertions people want make. I'm replying specifically use word ""weird"".

With said, sympathize inefficient, slow leadership. guess Trump's mad dash get vaccine hopes re-elected helped boost us favorable position right now. Moderna US-based vaccine right here.

Again, far Germany concerned, please trust say least half year lot us wishing leader like yours. Someone follows science, politicize pandemic. country maybe one two anti-lockdown protests, most.

All aside, I'm glad good despite obvious frustration. Stay safe there. vaccines stories around start becoming fishy Lockdown thee, mee? Yup. like pissing contest see doomy gloomy. True Canada get 20M doses Moderna Pfizer Pending Health Canada approval Canada could get additional 20M doses Oxford/J&amp;J/Novavax Q2

Wow. clarify, everything goes *well* (i.e. AZ, J&amp;J, Novavax approved), we'd still get 40M doses total (20+20) end Q2? That's pretty disheartening best-case scenario. Ultra Orthodox Jews 11% Israel’s population account 40% recent covid cases. certainly problem here. Thousands people mass gathered funeral, wearing masks. data supporting ""70% single dose efficacy"" ? Yes, recall brief article news that. One EU's suppliers said can't start delivery till Q4 year. possibly. never be. Problem is, millions Americans still watch news every night. Like inlaws, parents. former 70s, latter 60s.

The paper considered peer-reviewed date, every approval date. point another speculation it’s based publicly available **peer-reviewed study**, it’s unproven gets.

Stop spreading misinformation - breaks trust every regulators. need peer-reviewed data made group experts competent lot reviewers field. mean don’t know live US look states like Florida, Georgia, Wisconsin, states haven’t much restrictions since may/June they’re worse cases they’re better states much stricter lockdowns. Guy can't even wear mask properly think point comes difference opinion, hopefully global increasingly regional scale, pandemic responses altered fuck-ups happen again. expect anti vax family change tune can't go work travel without vaccine. Still ways off, need supply, full authorization, numbers drop significantly easing lockdowns. IP at-cost vaccine. extremely moral approach current, far outdoes what, instance, UK's near neighbours doing.

The EU contract get 600 million Pfizer doses. given EU citizens? EU-first therefore immoral?  UK EU salaried workers? would assume shift workers could go they’re shift.... FDA awaiting results separate trials America. far I'm aware, dosage issues trials matter. Ehh talk cheap. See actually gets vaccine Lockdown enthusiasts say “what New Zealand, China?” countries much different geography, cultural buy government structure rest world. one size fits approach way go years downsides lockdowns may come light even NZ China Long COVID incredibly anecdotal, many people mentioning symptoms easily attributed countless conditions. Anxiety, Restlessness, Drowsiness, Difficulty breathing exercising.

All symptoms also easily attributed Pandemic mode nearly year. Lack exercise, social contact, life much control?

Not almost every news article Long COVID serious symptoms insane biases could never used evidence scientific sense. Like last week Heart doctor claiming many patients sees COVID heart problems. funny, because, heart doctor, patients see anyways heart problems. you’ve torn meniscus, RNA could theory tell stem cells grow new cartilage repair it. got comment removed saying something similar. Curious mods here... I’m sorry, anyone care Singapore Education Minister say? seems like random person quote. It’s almost like author went way find literally anyone world says pandemic last “4-5 years.” Pure idiocy. would take excuse maybe 8 months ago, almost year in, public health officials countries definitely altered course, fact beating drum continued lockdowns variants knowing full well effects governments providing adequate aid. EU serviced Pfizer? Would love source !
And AZ profit?! definitely think parents close family vaccinated acceptable risk go visit them. Going large event (indoor, hundreds people) probably avoid people vaccinated, think going see close friends family also vaccinated time second dose build immunity 100% perfectly reasonable. Especially seen past year telephone/zoom. Note: article published December 10, 2020, NEJM.org.

Where's data supporting ""70% single dose"" claim ? virus literally less dangerous kids flu.

I’m half expecting teachers unions use precedent close schools flu future. vaccines still work South African variant. quite well others still enough offer protection like vaccine should. love last-ditch appeal emotion. care saving lives!?!?! cry ignoring fucked lockdowns making everyone.

So **Section 7.2(b) requires Commission pay remaining one third initial funding within 20 days start contract**. 

It within 20 days following ""*the start contract""* within 20 days following ""***the receipt AstraZeneca relevant evidence use first Installment relevant progress report""***.

We know happened happened already. seems like absolutely nothing said EU paying time moment. Future. done. Currently aren’t though. It’s UK first. think they're first, saw Olive Garden paying vaccinate workers well.

Dutch government repeatedly warned new mutations could lead new wave infections coming weeks, despite steady drop number COVID-19 cases since start year. first step towards easing measures, government Sunday decided reopen primary schools next week, young children still seen playing marginal role transmission disease.  know, anyone half brain public relations marketing know excessive doom gloom negativity work sense keeping people calm informed. entities use style success authoritarian governments use fear control people. swear people think bars closing early cancelled concerts means they've lockdown year. word almost lost meaning. Yes, vaccine invented Oxford, specifically chose AZ AZ committed providing vaccine cost. gao report said 2 million yesterday. Presumably number goes longer takes get eua believe there's probably rules regarding whether get PTO. Part timers probably get PTO, mostly managers ones allowed PTO. used work McDonald's, worked franchised location may different corporate employees. Even new epidemic occured current vaccines ineffective to, vaccines easily able modified, like there's ""new"" flu vaccine every year. government shouldn’t shut think Fourm Fauci would interesting. 

Although Fauci statements haven’t well received, feeling would smack pessimistic view point. look new yorks covid graph, see clearly cases dipped started lockdown march/april. I'm sorry hear that. School important worth life. consider home schooling vaccinated? would think adults don’t take everything see news face value, think “being vigilant” means expert pessimistic predictions reliable. It’s daycare want - want what’s best children. need educated. I’m worried minute chance suffer “long term side effects”. Healthy kids die flu meningitis every year, don’t shut schools it. Protect teachers, good country, kids need back school. 1) leader country using insult

2) prejudiced people using excuse insult physically attack people asian ancestry

3) looks like media lazy keep saying variant names like P.2 discovered Brazil. like can't remember all. B117something uk codes individual mutations contained particular variant, easier say uk variant, south African etc. maybe space limit articles - quicker say uk variant b1127 something something discovered kent, england UK.  It’s things like make want tell shut up. What’s next kissing banned? many grandparents kids? I'm sorry loss.

People overweight makes expendable seems. even overweight diabetic, people assume were. That's sad part this. fit trim seen non-human. Even story kid died COVID, comments brutal ""meh, obese"", ""call spade spade"". guess justifies death. makes blood boil.   IIRC 33% protection 1 shot measured like day 10 something? take abit longer build immunity also usinf covid testing test efficiency abit different trials measured symptoms. posted that,  dollar cost stayed same, buying much much alcohol store bar, bar charges much amount alcohol. government tell shut up. would help. Cases now, probably April.  No! Shut up! negative side effects better!!! convulsions tested positive HIV half face paralyzed I'm gonna extra protected. Buffalo game like super restrictive. get tested stadium 2 days game, tickets non-transferable. 

I want buy ticket stubhub walk stadium worry stuff. well 100m people US can't wait turn. effort convince people get vaccinated others prevented receiving kinda pissing off. essential, expendable. Would say fear baseless? greatly exagerated nooooo turkish ice cream guys! fucckkkk :'-((((( Yes will, Novavax &amp; J&amp;J particular Finally got in! Appointments March 31st. Wish sooner, I’m extremely glad got one!

Thanks much. 😊 breached common sense (if get travel). anecdote supported official statistics chose selective data anything extremely rare. 

Or extremely scary, matter. Check men, society progressed past need men  That's change every day. 

Multiple vaccines passing clinical trials. Multiple factories around world vaccine. production lines still built, sterilised tested. Vaccines exacting quality control possible, arn't far short it. Link article? Yeah thankfully, info 7 days ago. come back gets approved bump it, need argue people like this. think know do. Ya ben burned line thinking many times take seriously.

That kind thinking needs ridiculed refuted become main stream.  relief.

My mother received first dose Saturday. 70, COPD, hunkered entire pandemic. think that, vaccine job, survive virus cold? Well, simply huge relief.

Now get dad jab site .. Another thing. Oh, supply we're done. Hold up, favorite countries first. over, EU needed vaccines? helped amazing vax, leave EU too! Bojo nutshell.

Common travel area makes contest. uk open boarder ireland. I'm sure studies, read many.

The studies I'm refering actually check infection teachers. word “could” lot work. except, terms dollars, bars enormous upcharge drinks.   I'm sure exactly ""sales taxes"" exactly means, bar vs store, is:

I think article dead wrong, simply shift 
where drinks consumed (at home, instead bars) I'd suggest level consumption skyrocketed.  (maybe 2.5 times much)

Just think, 10 beers bar cost $50 (5$ pint).  take $50 liquor store, get probably 36 cans beer (~$15 12 pack)? That's 432 ounces = 27 pints.


*""says shift points sale suggests consumption drop much.*

*“Between March November – data November far — bars saw 33% less sales tax collections. Whereas liquor stores time period saw 28% sales tax collections,” said.""* People realize Politicians care safety public, care votes special interest money.  even contradicting now... I'm sorry, go outside film video upload YouTube prove point. personal experience someone living Sweden enough. I'm grocery store I'd say 10-20% wear masks new variants major concern though. mean yh transmissible definitely good thing we've seen vaccines still effective new variants albeit slightly reduced efficiency. reduced efficiency better efficiency. whilst definitely want new variant spread like wildfire atleast vaccines them. 

The situation much better say last year idea vaccines would even arrive would continuation last four weeks, numbers dropped much Well can't sell burgers workers dead Conspiracy theory alert. 

The media wants wait Biden office months claim ""Beat expectations"" things cooling spring/summer. 

Just look low bar 1m shots per day. raised staggering 1.5m day. Americans extremely unhealthy, maybe everyone take example lose weight. Regardless, ain’t problem. Oh totally, health system PERU certainly comparable developed Western nation.

And 65+ share population USA double Peru. 

You speak fallacies yet ignore painfully obviously relevant facts. Pity. wonder Ireland even need vaccines time Britain ready share?

Probably. look numbers ireland getting many more. 4 million increase AstraZeneca adds 100k ireland. doses expected q2 earliest. 

The uk talking long wait, suggesting sharing phase 1 rollout over, mid February. current rate, sooner. Osterholm game along time intelligent matters. I’ve listened podcast since started. He’s perfect, don’t dogmatically follow anyone, it’s foolish listen one best game. least consider says. always explains reasoning. many think intelligent matters practicing high level decades decades. Monday morning quarterbacks. Well, good news find right months regardless  LOL, irony... Drivers license work. Maybe private companies. believe forcing would support it. Two serious questions Michael Osterholm:

1. indulge excessive hyperbole? didn’t see Guardian article yesterday, compared British variant Category 5 hurricane strike US. consider hyperbole brand? done shtick long doesn’t know way communicate? 

(Also, official second question, realize hyperbole counterproductive, even *if* good intentions? He’s either scaring people point can’t think straight, pissing people tune ignore — neither good way manage public health situation.)

2. excessive hyperbole *ever* correct, topic? (For example, hospitals certainly didn’t “collapse” December.) Yeah look mate idk extra 3k deaths day particularly normal I'm from. actually prevailing opinion Chicago too. wrong they're also teaching right last day. amazon.com e-commerce website allowed posts comments.

Guys, anything get people calm F down??? vaccines people seem listen Osterholm new circus variants news outlets.

I wish could something it. light end tunnel! Ugb post yesterday saying found accurate swabs AZ sells developing countries cost. SA one those. emotional also little informed. roommate teaches primarily black brown school 20% families want send kids back quote something little recent? Thanks.  predict Hancock bullshitting.

I predict there's going ""sorry lockdowns"" Hancock near future. everyone, government...

I believe British variant plays big part well, announced relaxation restrictive measures Christmas holiday knew I'd back lay January. fucking stupid. Im scared 😪  So, calculations, unvaccinated people 6x higher probability catch virus fully vaccinated people

How figure? great news. love vaccine trusted technology, incredible results similar mRNA vaccines. Ya tragedy would be. think important realize expecting something like flu shot first (40-60% reduction symptoms). 

The efficacy likely fall, that's OK, need get range normal illness go back normal behavior. I'm sure people find bit harsh, continue mask social distance every flu season like. be. things. 30% roughly given 1 shot think less 20% given 2 shots. Immunity happen straight away takes around 1-2 weeks immunity build up. Also deaths lag always last down. deaths probably got infected say late December early January. 

Not mention we're vaccinating global pandemic entirely possible someone get infected right get shot days getting shot immunity built up. Usually vaccinate prevent outbreak exactly ideal vaccinating outbreak. Although deaths hopefully start go substantially end month. I’m quoting him.

Edit: see comment get posted correct context. Letting Children starve save lives 75+ people seem like good policy. regions school closures that? Low immunity among teachers could explain temporary increase surge. fair, that's also comparison unvaccinated cohort. Using metric, still showed efficacy right around 97%, slightly higher Phase III trial results. Damn, son. still living April 2020? Time move on. Thanks. aware. good know fear mongers. automatically disqualifies opinion, mean likely hyperbolic factual.  look forward people complaining stuff hasn’t happened yet. might awhile guess. lot restrictions still place world. lot people ignoring best can, enforced extent. reason subreddit obsessed shitting none RNA vaccines. truly bizarre.

Because 95% 60% even though vaccines numbers actually amazing. People understand science focus numbers without context.

This standard practice reddit similar sites. Nobody reads articles anymore even attempts understand something arguing it. Oh newsmax oann?

Come one now. enthusiasts say “what New Zealand, China?

It looks like Parnasian poets talking greek vase Bangladesh. Something completely far away reality. Osterholm’s awkward smirk he’s giving doom predictions creep out. That’s add. True. local rural counties, nobody's busting door get it. local health dept., source vaccine currently have, referred ""the trial"" shot. offer one day week. Hopefully least change vaccines become available.   Look Coronachan (or Corona-Chan) 4chan early pandemic good rule 34 interpretations speak. complete opposite experience.

**France’s Pasteur Institute abandons principal Covid-19 vaccine worst antivaxxer experience you’ve someone? Yes, lockdown since February. county has. periods lockdown, almost certainly cases increasing times lokdowns lifted. Get yourself. idea 'attitude' towards compliance. attitude towards media one contempt. probably get asked lot: easiest/most effective way seen intro first nuggets truth people - broach subject without getting immediately shut down? Healthy, vaccinated people die? Incredible. even know legitimate challenge either. 

Come back tested vulnerable groups elderly. Oh wait, recommended give them. tend die 'underlying issues' shortly afterwards. Totally unrelated. live big medical town, lots friends doctors nurses!  Yea time actually start around normal time wait summer virus. 

If anything it’s gonna like 10 games shorter. scientific point view totally right, data 55 year olds vaccines known lose efficacy older people. Germany said same, year olds (which kind random).

However, currently de middle pandemic, societal view problematic. loads mRNA vaccins maybe 3 months, current moment, definitely enough anything vaccinate elderly need vaccinated ASAP. Even perfect, also AZ vaccine likely make strong difference disease severity also old people, safe. quite hefty decision use them. know that... guy replying didn’t Young people aren’t dying corona. Period.

I mean, objectively untrue. one thing say young people's deaths make significant statistical percentage overall COVID deaths; false say young people dying it. absolutely are. clear, developing world. highly modern, capitalist country virtually indistinguishable life midwest USA.

They surrounded sides islamic countries 200 years behind, Lebanon always center middle east quality modern education, profits, ski slopes, awesome sandwiches.

They devolved within span decade. Basically, capitalism.

It complicated understand fully happening there, seeing Lebanon America 5-10 years. slightly ahead us capitalism corruption Articles like demonstrate easy lie statistics. headline totally misleading acknowledge lockdowns *were successful preventing COVID deaths*. 0 virus deaths, course would hunger-related deaths. Conversely, nothing done, would zero ""COVID-related hunger deaths"" deaths caused virus would tens millions. 

I take point made here, key question is: *in alternative reality lockdowns*, would fewer deaths? Damn already 25%?? Nice! still 4% hopefully many month :) return 12:00 EST start answering. Thank mods likely need work overtime, given topic. Lol shit curious long last? I'm getting second shot day important interview side effects dose 1 people know. 5 days, another PCR test, maybe even false positive, get another 5 days. imprison town one guy got sick.

Your lockdowns \[few\] month\[s\] ago timed perfectly arrival summer.  Anecdotally, likely worked family too. started wearing mask around March 1st last year, likely caught 3rd 4th week March, presented symptoms 4th week March. 

We started safe practices around March 1st, everyone avoiding common areas, indoor mask wearing except bedrooms, distanced everyone else one working. 

Along safe practices sick little luck, managed spread it. 

If people take seriously plague, good chance catching it, spreading catch it. Regardless article says, comment saying reasonable things.

Also, unemployment, poverty, economic hardship lockdown could affect supply chains reduce size donation said even false. say June, say May. I’m probably overly optimistic vaccine rollout opinion depends J&amp;J gets arms. Regardless, happen late Spring/early summer so.  Take time there’s reason hurry everything fine.. Waited hour get flu shot CVS even appointment. I’m hopeful mRNA technology used develop future universal influenza vaccines still pipeline development. universal influenza vaccines developed, could prevent future influenza pandemics happening, give people lifetime protection strains influenza virus. could take 20 years developed approved though, I’m hopeful we’ll hear news next years. Chicago expects take several months vaccinate 65+ group. Woah that's weird, mid 20 year old friends? ones caught covid symptom free minority, know people count one hand caught covid still extreme fatigue, can't smell, appitites, crushing depression. Several even ended ICU lucky still alive, none matters yall, aunts parents died 28 days apart, parents public school teachers three kids Dallas ISD die year alone, February. One deaths nine year old boy days ago. Several teachers aids hospitalized yet still kids insist wear masks dumb shit like licking walls Facebook live claiming covid challenge. amount denial people getting real boring, im gonna glad watch move goal post variants dominating thru America. expect whats-a-new-angle-we-can-exploit-for-clicks stories coming weeks.

I expect attitudes like cause drop infections/hospitalizations much slower otherwise would be. ""downward spiral"" mean COVID go back normal, yes, still plenty stories risks, what's safe what's not, etc. media trying scare people, public absolutely still needs aware risks even downward trend; otherwise trend could reverse.  really don’t understand saying. Yes, get choose enter body. people using argument people go protest abortion clinic. ""Fuck PS5, can't find goddamn GeForce 3080""

George Washington Congrats! We’re still going forward three weeks, high risk guests (plus numerous others, least 25% total) vaccinated. Exactly. Immunologists ethical experts, psychological experts. important considerations deciding measures implement. 

Maybe cases discussion multidisciplinary, lengthy, harms ethics debated cases definitely Lick. confirmed yet, unlikely someone able transmit fully vaccinated.

It's dangerous message public health officials US pushing - nothing stop transmission, there's really upside tens millions near-zero risk categories get it. I'm 100% convinced. think possible. things come worst end lot ranges different variables. 


Right now, we're seeing R US 0.8, every week remove 2% remaining susceptible population vaccination infection. That's lot downward pressure already low-ish transmission rates, giving us lot leeway transmissible strains reduced carefulness.

 
If I'm reading chart right, flu february spike half years. bet summer fall surge US variants. Gotcha, well that's good know!

This exciting see light end tunnel. I'm really loving steeply cases seem trending downwards quickly vaccines rolling out. straight fear-mongering. summer 95% normal, next summer 100% normal, vaccines almost definitely delivered developing world then. theory surges certain areas variant gets area contagious. Remember California made news late last year implementing restrictions lockdowns many thought excessive. cases exploded anyway. maybe lockdowns make big difference people think variants.

We good information variants may gotten area detecting difficult (requires sequencing) really checking. makes sense variant many times contagious going get explosion cases. become big problem media declares Covid ""over"" one Friday afternoon May reduces deaths/hospitalizations nearly 100%, Long COVID much issue either US used something like flu stopped since effective vaccine Except article specifically talking vaccines released companies public results makes sense talk those... first dose give resistance? read media writes reports almost like 3, soon 5, available vaccines.  really want mRNA vaccines, although I'll take get. sorts vaccines everything I've heard revolutionary may stepping stone eliminating sorts ailments. NOVA show talked recently, encouraging say least. imagine world flu eliminated? Where, maybe, cancers prevented? brave new frontier medicine, hoping lifetimes see vile diseases curtailed. really need sarcastic comments top every thread good news? Anyone hoping eradication straight delusional. Zero covid never happening. Illinois 2,312 cases today. rate hitting Phase 5 aka completely restored end week early next. Crazy fast improving. Let's go Chicago! vaccines required travel,

This going get interesting. think know countries allow visitors unless prove they've vaccinated.

Now proof going hard part. prove it? I've heard kinds ideas. app, endorsement passport, etc. wonder people determined enough fake that? Go back shit hole country mate, plenty freedom better politicians Washington, dialed restrictions areas today. expect Governors monitor hospitalization rates plan accordingly. states already sort phased reopening plan, even dates know yet. think it’s early tell comes vaccinated people. mild cases vaccinated people get may different mild cases unvaccinated people get. months know much this. Best bet get vaccine get hands time being. That’s funny, makes New Zealand’s Australia’s tactic seem pretty sound worry it. week 2nd dose, vaccinated people much less likely transmit, shown Israel.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* Funny get downvoted speaking possible truth. People like praying get vaccine... probably never looked further...  like tiktok song.

I feel like I'm dead, im alive im dead. never gets discussed somehow can't imagine least part it. thing exponential spread can't go forever, like chain letters Ponzi schemes, eventually run people.

Gottlieb estimated 30% population exposed virus end January, probably higher average areas. Add 10% vaccinations lot areas probably seeing 50% people exposed. ""herd immunity"" surely cut spread. flu vaccine often even 50% effective. likely no. Even cause bit surge, vulnerable vaccinated, strain shown evade vaccines. lot can't read full article. Could someone give TL;DR please?  Two weeks 2nd shot I’m gonna wear mask indoors it’s required that’s it. don’t care anyone say otherwise. Australia still exists, guys BW stuff kept 75% strength. Finally got ironmaster adjustable dumbbells bench stuff gym. Can't deadlift since live apartment.

I still think right close gyms though. would 950,000 immune Pfizer Modena 2M doses enough 1 million people. way see merrier world gets vaccinated. always go forward reinforcement specific variants mRNA technology seems able adapt quickly. know is, fully accept happens COVID. question bad enough mild cases cause serious long term damage. Also true. need drop big again, maybe one time. little bit like ""Save Whales"" ""Save Polar Bears""... people think they're dong God's Work wearing masks love sense self-righteousness gives them. think they'll actually sad stop wearing them. even vaccines reduce transmission \*at all\* (which highly unlikely), they'll still effectively end pandemic drastically reducing deaths/hospitalizations/serious illness, really care end day. eat restaurants go boxing gym. That’s that’s changed little late game starting vaccinate 75+... Hey folks got vaxx appointment, remember seeing headline one vaxx protections strains. Anyone remember that? like response! Thanks! tend trust vaccines, get vaccine (3rd party peer-reviewed studies control groups) asap.

I recommend take look back graph school closures peaks virus. Schools heart ""the hammer dance"" (a horrible concept policy.) certainly correlation school closings reduced cases following month.

With regards ""how evidence works,"" never seen breakdown statistically-significant source transmissions given community specifically identified. seen studies ""evidence show schools significant source transmission,"" whereby less 25% total community transmissions accurately traced. me, pass minimum threshold data science. Evidence show intelligent life elsewhere universe. due lack intelligent life, rather due lack evidence either way.

Now, ""trusting experts."" mixing lot things within framework. I'm sciences trust good science. profession, 25% suck job. Moreover, many scientists wrong unintended consequences story many-a-calamity. Tom Dowd, example, spent rest life regretting early work nuclear. Nobel another many examples.

What CDC's job respect COVID? trusted experts, lost ability hold title?

**Vaccines** - FDA (not CDC) reviews applications approves. trust seen process enough take it. CDC tasked helping distribution. comprehensive COVID distribution plan January 19, 2020. That's big fail.

**Containment outside country** - CDC kicked butt Ebola years ago. made stateside, contained mostly thanks efforts US doctors overseas measures. case COVID, CDC failed see problem early enough failed make moves community spread United States. flying home Thailand first heard COVID Jan 6. screened airport. not.

**Containment within country.** - time admitted airborne already ""moved containment mitigation."" CDC unsuccessful. shutdown March, chance try re-contain virus. not. CDC guidance helped. death toll worst estimates spring last year. County health department joke, recommendations place, enforcement containment mitigation strategies.

Listen containment raw biology. large system involved thorough planning required. Psychology, Supply Chain, Economics, Building Sciences, nearly fields must come together cohesively success. variety tools (over 200) leveraged contain virus. countries succeeded failed. US exemplar abject failure instance. completely within reason question CDC containment mitigation strategies due 14 months failure contain virus. study resource holds weight, opinion, CDC respect containment COVID-19. credibility topic.

The NZ Ministry Health deserves credibility matter. read following statement sounds inconclusive - ""In keeping international findings, children appeared lesser role household transmission outbreaks—even school—in New Zealand, despite intensive testing asymptomatic contacts.2, 21 However, lower national testing rates children, detection bias cannot excluded."" pay cut, would huge bonus. says active duty? didn't. Use head, champ. need get head around relative risk levels age group. Covid predominantly killer old sick.

You need read guy wrote - death nothing, wide range negative outcomes, even 20 years olds. asking send us doses. asking send LESS doses.

Either way sending total amount vaccine. want say amount vial worth 5 doses originally calculated, decrease amount owe USA 5 doses every vial send, without actually sending more.

This 'speed distribution' way makes life better me... 'speeds distribution' Moderna complete contract faster send less overall doses otherwise would original deal. Right giving us 5ish extra dose per vial ""free charge"" (like Baker's Dozen). Essentially want backtrack us pay that. I'd like see infection rates Israel 3 weeks. show major drop vaccinations I'd agree. show still infect others depends normal life is. 

And good part get see Israeli stats first. JnJs China's similar, right? know missed bit track people getting vaccine? Big difference nurses working covid wards everyday seniors sitting home gett grocery delivery. Implying refuse serve gay people non-Christians isn’t “mentioning problematic history” it’s point-blank lying. Covid, washing hands primary way prevent spread viruses. advice Ebola, ""Swine Flu"", SARS, flu, etc.

[The single important thing child prevent spread influenza virus — wash advice decades, maybe centuries. somehow virus, forgotten, make sense me. Sure, maybe spread particles droplets whatever (still proven) surely also spread way every virus ever spread. either masks washing hands both. Again, isn’t true. 

Congress isn’t even putting bill vote yet. 

They, instead, decided Trump trial FIRST. 

And, mind you, democrats KNOW don’t votes convict. 

Democrats set schedule. 

The democrats decided schedule stimulus debate trial.  

It’s horrible politics. Democrats battle optics going trial know they’re going lose instead voting bill get stimulus Americans. That's optimistic end read still call anything close 10% anomaly think? helpful numbers get low keep low. less useful numbers high  ""Why variants might kill nursing home residents quickly! beginning end beginning Chapter 1 pandemic."" - CNN, probably. Makes sense. 

Immune responses generally make feel pretty shitty though. doubts whole lot people feeling fine immune system goes nuts nukes lungs heat. studies models suggesting impact vaccines R0 virus? widely distributed vaccine prevents infection \~60% people receive vaccine, alongside recovered could really put squeeze vaccine. 

I'm curious quickly get R0 1 lower using vaccines.

Any vaccine highly effective prevention hospitalization death buys us time build herd immunity. get mRNA next year, make sure. comment exact opposite. People getting vaccine return us normalcy. need maintain anti-covid measures reach herd immunity; get point, can’t ease masks distancing like OP decrying. 

So masks continue norm people can’t interrogate others give special access something basis vaccine. OP crying vaccinated people can’t eat indoors go gym. can’t done. There’s verification system enough vaccine yet. OP continue living masked distanced life time whether like not.  Wait weeks 2nd shot you’re good go. age study 235k 46. self reports 46 exactly elderly. concern. J&amp;J vaccine study said 85% efficacy SEVERE covid infection. means 15% still susceptible getting severe case covid could lead long term effects. alone would prefer Moderna, pfizer even novavax vaccine. young host medical complications really dont want take chances ending serious already dealing with. he's saying believes new surge cases UK variant start 6 14 weeks. Dramatic spin? 5 years left gets cut short 4 years, I'll mad. get final choice life, unless gonna final Christmas something either way, want risk it. old die getting passed friends family, could leave feeling responsible death way got J&amp;J shot part trial.

I get reaction, bad passed quickly. Essentially like sick flu day. Lebanon time crap. Covid-19 primarily fad rich developed Western countries afford making fuss virus 99.8 survival rate. fad caught places people expect state trust cuddle shelter risks actual life. Looking Germany, Austria, Denmark, Belgium, Netherlands...

Lebanon way bigger issues deal with, including public health well, virus even top ten priorities government. Reddit suffers Asian parent syndrome, 60% fail regardless context. Ideally would could vaccinate immunity. practice though would create even bigger hurdle mess vaccinating everybody. post appears vaccines, please see [our answers frequently asked questions regarding COVID-19 vaccines. comment containing misinformation removed user potentially banned.

Story:

My daughters friend tested positive Covid Jan 25th. sister basketball team (tested positive 22nd) others. daughter saw friend 13th rode together car (maskless) that's one two ""safe"" friends.

My daughter showed symptons cold week 17th sleepy one days. also commented taste much also cold normally can't taste anything happens. Well finally thought best option get tested going back forth words (she normally never says right thing always misuses words) + found friend COVID. Appointments booked availability area 31st, came back negative could due taking test late.

Now wife test today, January 1 started feeling like coming cold Jan 29, Jan 30 smell anything. thought taste buds gone false sign. Today Jan 1 said taste lunch test came back positive now.

So seeing daughter got friend (who know obviously) wife got daughter (there 3 occasions daughter drank cup water). since wife first started getting symptoms 30th smell, long ago trace back warn people?

My parents came Thursday (28th) saw 5 women small group 26th (she mask always, + chairs spaced circle).

We telling parents + small group ladies aregardless worried trying gauge. parents came cause area dad got vaccinated 1st shot. btw came ""cold"" day.  know reasons hospitalizations? Ie.

People minimized exposure pandemic, restrictions.

The economy doesn’t come back pandemic beaten. vaccine widely available mandatory nursing homes, hospitals, etc. Thanks, too. think arguing human rights stripped away wonderful use time well. Crazy goverment lot people running show thinking money peoples health. would say would say otherwise

I can’t fucking wait get vaccinated rub face Hmm.. see coming lockdowns super effective circumstances. sure agree masks. proven effective general public access vaccine, mind wearing one. cost wear one isnt much me. guess so, ever since 2016 election cycle really kicked off, shit. Before, reporting factual information minimal bias. that, mindlessly attack Trump supporters (he wrong also right, refuse report it). Trump gone, still attacking appear biased af. also got lots revenue COVID fearmongering, don’t wanna lose money, continue fearmongering COVID. Currently progress, take reach herd immunity.

We know vaccines. Part problem emergency authorisation rather years normally take. Oh, well completely agree right ask vaccinated people continue mask/distance around unvaccinated people. continue open transparent vaccination status is, current risk levels life are, respectful other's risk tolerances. point accepting vaccinated people socializing indoors vaccinated people, eating indoors, travelling, etc. Yeah hilarious many things labeled ""misinformation"" except (in opinion) ridiculous articles like one mentioned. saw made blood boil - that's four years, four years life. this?

We’ll see well efficacy current vaccines stands test time virus mutations.

It also assumes people want vaccinate themselves. given days! particular pandemic, efficacy 90%, 60-70% population needs get vaccinated herd immunity kick in. that’s norm.

There’s difference sober rational actively seeking crush everyone’s hope desperately need. article tone deaf hell nothing give people reason give stop following rules take vaccine. begs question point taking vaccine won’t change anything [2]

Dr Fetzer said ‘This strongly suggests link ‘Eat Help Out’ new COVID-19 infections causal: people dining part scheme fewer new cases virus. ‘Eat Help Out’ may end false economy: one subsidised spread pandemic Autumn contributed start second wave. Alternative policy measures, extending furlough scheme, increasing statutory sick pay supporting low income households expanding free school meals may well prove far cost effective demand-stimulating measures encourage economic activities actively cause COVID-19 spread.’

**Notes editors**

The Government’s Eat Help scheme conceived shore demand hard hit restaurant sector UK, employs around 1 million people directly. scheme cut cost meals non-alcoholic drinks 50% across tens thousands participating restaurants UK 3 31 August 2020. discount capped maximum £10 per person, limit often could claimed per individual. Early release statistics suggest four weeks program active, total nearly 100 million covers claimed, total cost taxpayer around £500 million.

**Read Research**

Subsidizing spread COVID-19: Evidence UK’s Eat-Out-to-Help-Out scheme. Thiemo Fetzer, CAGE Working Paper, University Warwick, take 3 months sequence genome. took 3 months realise proportion increasing population degree attributed random chance. [1]

The government initiative, cost around £500 million, caused significant rise new infections August early September accelerating pandemic current second wave. economic benefits scheme, meanwhile, short-lived.

In new paper, ‘Subsidizing spread COVID-19: Evidence UK's Eat Help scheme’, Dr Thiemo Fetzer CAGE Research Centre Economics Department University Warwick analyses causal impact ‘Eat Help Out’ COVID-19 infections. Key findings are:

· Participating restaurants saw increase visits 10 200% compared 2019.

· Areas higher rate uptake (both restaurants consumers) experienced sharp increase emergence new COVID-19 infection clusters week scheme began.

· 8 17% newly detected COVID-19 infection clusters attributed scheme.

· Areas high uptake saw decline new infections week scheme ended.

· ‘Eat Help Out’ scheme ended, visits restaurants started decline – indicating positive economic impact short-lived.

The research leverages data HMRC’s restaurant finder app go-to platform people searching participating restaurants neighbourhood, together weekly data new COVID-19 infections measured level Middle Layer Super Output Areas.

To demonstrate causal connection ‘Eat Help Out’ increased infections areas high uptake, Dr Fetzer analyses rainfall data granular mobility data Google’s Community Mobility Reports. finds higher rainfall around lunch dinner time scheme’s period operation (Monday Wednesday throughout August) saw drop visits restaurants subsequently lower new infection rates compared areas enjoyed good weather. Rainfall lunch dinner hours drastically affect time spent locations. many .8% comorbidities like diabetes/suppressed immune system/obesity? Here's theory zero evidence whatsoever:

I think lot anti-vaxxers, anti-maskers, etc. need right something that, mind, many people wrong about. think they're frequently lacking knowledge across board feel right huge thing maybe make areas lack knowledge.

I think they're also defensive think right deep know they're wrong they've wrong many things. 

Or they're assholes. 1. hinder breathing (before someone says muh freedumbs, said hinder stop)

2. dystopian shit

3. Lots industries affected negatively masks like lip reading dental industry.

4. cause bacterial pneumonia

5. Kids negatively affected thinking everyone masked time

6. Deaf people worse off

7. Lots people don’t take care hygiene (especially dental) masks.

8. cause lot aggression masks (but moreso pro-maskers)

9. visual reminder pandemic government overreach

10. Facial Expression important understanding people.

There lot could’ve added, decided limit 10 good then? Thats relief haha 

&amp;#x200B;

How affect transmission? way imagine fully inoculated kill virus spread true? efficacy mean context? single dose transmission roughly equivalent hospitalisations reduced? Assuming that's true government take cue reduce restrictions would lead virus widespread less deadly, leading rapid mutations? Could even good thing?

&amp;#x200B;

Only answer want course haha  Oh gotcha. thought worked toddlers confused since daycares open. Even pay everyone, removing entire social lives work long. Yeah, lot leaky social bubbles there. Covid 19 Tracking ending March 7. feel optimistic good this. social end may near. (USA) hope get answers, that's also concern. I'm fine mild flu, I'm fine potentially going 10 months long covid symptoms losing sense smell even longer. I'll take large vaccine ketchup side please weakened immune system using sanitizer wipes covid. nice everyone living like me. (I say humor “everyone better live like me” attitude.) sounds hugely optimistic. everyone focusing infection rates past ... *checks calendar* ... 11 months?

What totally unsurprising change narrative /s Great finally administration understands testing one key components fighting thing. Ironic Australian company making these, Australian regulators intention approving at-home testing products Australians. Market Analyst / Market Research. work home now. Karen’s? Really? Even though it’s mostly men refuse wear masks even unvaccinated? actually real world study going Israel provide crucial data. 

Also, realize we're month half vaccinating people also starting trend winter surge, right? We'll know coming months, time rcv vaccine We'll much better idea impactful vaccines transmission mutated variants effect them. 

And what's long term effects? guess rage skimmed part said already vaccinated. Im afraid long term effects. Also, said back strong sense normal summer. Relax. Youre turning one redditor jumps extreme read couple words triggered you.

Finally, work hospital we're holding patients children's hospital, forigive waiting extra month two grinding bitches bar swapping spit (which anyways since Im married, younget point) .Ill play safe next months data transmission cases fallen. you, homie. 

Weak play name, btw. Yes. matters keep increasing versus day previous week. Well, choice- public policy option comes costs benefits. Imposing lockdown costs terms higher rates depression anxiety, higher rates substance abuse, higher rates, financial ruin many, child abuse going unreported, kids falling behind school. We've decided ruining destroying lives people affected ways lockdown worth saving lives predominantly elderly group slower rate COVID transmission. OK, situation changes vaccine, need re-weigh costs benefits adjust policy accordingly. 

Because know degree vaccine prevents transmission, precautions reasonably ask. instance, continue careful regular close contact at-risk unvaccinated person. Continue wearing masks public indoor spaces. I'd argue would get better compliance limited measures post-vaccination told people change behavior vaccination. hope right, plastered CNN think go to. doubt elected official likes either. Afew lmao probably like 20-30 Facts.  process extremely tight QC. consequences shipping ineffective vaccines would huge. sort industrial process, there's room error, something seems like 'no-brainer' still needs vetting validation. Seems like Mondays Tuesdays always going lowest? Tack onto pause vaccines Northeast Corridor nor'easter might bit frustrating week. work? travel throughout US, hang family, generally use public amenities want I'll happy. wait year two go Vietnam, fine. want get moving something. True. haven’t vaccinated many young people much stronger immune response vaccine make us get doses *faster* Karens: ""1 100 die covid? Family, special""

Also Karens "" 1 person Million adverse reaction Vaccine?!! could me!"" least one China vaccines inactivated virus vaccine.

It probably efficacy numbers mRNA vaccines gate, since spike protein immune system form antibodies epitopes proteins spike. gain resistance nucleocapsid protein, etc.

J&amp;J Oxford virus-vectors deliver spike mRNA payload only. mRNA vaccines spike mRNA.

It might higher side effect profile mRNA vaccines since there's viral stuff body autoimmune reactions to. J&amp;J Oxford vaccines whole (but non-replicating) viruses well ""on paper"" carry higher side effect risk too.

If guess effective combo would probably inactivated virus vaccine China followed pfizer mRNA shot. guess least side-effect risk would probably one two mRNA vaccines. article? haven’t seen anyone seeing it’s gonna take till 2024 get back normal.

Hell even Fauci, pretty conservative guesstimate himself, said returning semblance normalcy fall.

And knowing him, fully expect USA open normal Summer 2021 he’s saying Fall 2021. He’s always overshooting it. paying close attention it.

I know world wide numbers vaccinations age, odds getting severe reaction vaccine catching virus developing severe reaction, people informed. Dude, I'm saying ""humans made see eyes only"" stupid pseudo argument. People thousands things everyday exactly natural, taking medicines, treating cancer. know human body designed chemo drugs poured it, right? brains outweighed risks benefits - i.e. something clearly unable here.

Besides, let's honest. care able see others' eyes. biased anything pro-restrictions, comment history clearly proves. think they'll move us phase 5 quick im happy too! mean CPS cant even get teachers go moment. still. good!

I'm young I'm last. anyone eli5 Israel given vaccine 34% population 2nd dose 20% still getting 9k cases per day (v close time highs)? last days 7 day moving average ticked up... thought impact vaccine would Eventually, relative number immunocompromised people can't get vaccines likely extremely low. much realistic practical (actually within control) take precautions need keep safe (i.e. appropriate PPE go out), rather expect everyone around indefinitely forever. Dang. Where's mine? hope j&amp;j I’m sorry, nothing suggest saying. EU least 450 million doses vaccines summer based approved ones only. think beyond April fine. completely normal, better now. element politicized that. Polls show Democrats exaggerated sense risk virus, think party demographics lifestyle. take virus seriously genuinely concerned.

The elections still freaking something else it. Many said concerns virus would disappear Nov 4 Jan 20 anything concerns greater now, even though data better. Democrat-leaning media outlets like CNN, MSNBC, NYT WPO still beating drum even though elections comfortably charge.

Really blame media become, desperate click-driven sound bites facts, applies Covid well politics policy everything else. could people legitimately believe good idea ransack Capitol? Even weeks later can't see bad guys. deeply fooled?

The media incentive report facts common sense. Long gone news anchors try patiently present facts (though may always succeed), least tried give people facts let decide. Instead every utterance designed create right click, vote follower. furthest left leaning want say covid rarely affects young people. look headline, title making seem like 30 year olds affected hard covid really minuscule. Let introduce r/covidiots r/masks4all ah, interesting. sources? thanks advance Sounds heavenly. Hopefully summer proof vaccination policy implemented. Would’ve cool to, know, *ever* mention got first dose! donate blood, test antibodies. concerned, could 2 birds 1 stone deal. Studies weren’t performed half dose, yet, provide ample evidence approval. 

This half dose result manufacturing error, planned given particular study made. 

Studies underway, yet completed. expect it'll around, extremely manageable get annual Covid booster flu shot. Get initial vaccines Moderna now, example, produce booster specifically SA variant, get booster. Etc. That's study saying. He’s always wrong. Oh yes, Moderna. (I'm sure Moderna yet, though. Regardless, mostly two given currently.) I’m cut anti vaxxers life. anecdote. know tons people headache one day. yes. Marines. Correction: ONE doctor speculates variants cause spike cases spring. feel like I've read article million times. never obvious (to me) question addressed: 

Groups like WHO, CDC, etc. saying fomite transmission _possible_. we've read plenty studies virus particles found surfaces places like grocery stores, sidewalks, hallways, etc. 

So may ask... Would really touch one surfaces knowingly immediately wash hands?

If answer 'no', make sense treat surfaces unknown status contaminated abundance caution?

Put another way. someone said: 0.05% chance touching thing could end hospitalizing loved one, spray disinfectant eliminate even small risk? take easy cheap safety precautions every day miniscule risks. temporary months (hopefully), where's harm? really irrational? One popular voices, tho thankfully discredited, literal nutritionist Got first Moderna dose Saturday laid day Sunday. still recovering morning, mild fever aches mostly back normal afternoon. 

Super looking forward effects second dose they're worse.  Pfizer riot! Vaccine numbers going fucked week. big northeast cities basically shutdown due snow. Vaccine places closed over. countries capable ending pandemic also countries extract resources countries would guess well. wanted show conclusions experts reasonable. ""low"" would reality ""extreme risk"", correct. fair question. Covid virus cannot infect mucus membrane, need specific receptor bind enter one cells.

If imagine cells lots tiny houses little doors locks them, Covid virus one key: protein spike unlock ACE2 receptor, none other. find ACE2 receptor, enter cell, hijack it, start multiplying, take body. ACE2 receptors located mostly cells airway lungs, direct inhalation risky route, ACE2 receptors inside mouth. touch mouth virus get in, stays oral chamber maybe bind one receptors. eat food, chances pretty good food bolus would envelop virus particle never touch mucus membrane all, gets washed saliva, unlikely linger mouth long enough find ACE2 receptor bind to. Saliva produced chewing also contain anti-virals regular saliva, maybe provide additional protection. food zero risk, considered relatively safe. we’ll back normal think it’s likely covid still around.i would shocked see us ever eradicate this.now vaccines treatments make probably less severe flu season go back normal get point believe never fully rid virus ever due extremely contagious messaging 2 months [**2021-04-01 22:02:33 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-04-01%2022:02:33%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) remind [**this send PM also reminded reduce spam.

Hence pandemic vulnerable populations poorest countries chance vaccine too. metric shooting - MUST - J&amp;J vaccine aimed vulnerable populations get-go. hard figure distribution vaccine places like US, going 100x hard roll places without adequate roads medical facilities.

Best you.

Back you, internet stranger. He’s got vaccines thinks everyone drooling idiot, evidenced lying manipulate public. doesn’t respect loves respect him.  State possibly stop 2 million people stepping foot outside house wanted to. lockdown effective people selfish narcissists value protecting eachother need get haircuts eat restaurants etc people get buy school breaks summer vacation? moratorium evictions unemployment claimed stop working loss child care. Stop BS breakdown recent trends?
Anecdotally seems skewing younger recently, saw report indicating same: People wearing masks, washing hands, social distancing. media set 1m day goal, Biden did. I've heard complaints media 1m day modest goal. 

Setting expectations low easily surpass exactly ""conspiracy."" statistical anomaly

Numbers? read 10% infected long term effects. honest, casual tone child abuse makes sick. I’m going respond calmly anyways.

Kids teachers likely catch covid outside school school follows proper precautions. therefore follows schools could decrease deaths net safety precautions followed (as life years lost school closures shown higher life years lost due school reopening. among entire community, students. Therefore, follows want save lives, schools must society must prioritize protecting young vulnerable voice conversation. Inflicting much harm young theoretically protect small subset elderly backwards cruel. I'm waiting J&amp;J vaccine myself. would rather one-shot two shot Moderna Pfizer. care 66% overall efficacy, I'm interested 100% no-severe-symptoms, important part me. would gotten purposefully infected knew sure get severe symptoms, regardless losing sense taste smell. Lol yeah don’t know explain people aren’t distancing deaths non existent past like April. Governments base restrictions deaths. That’s “the hard truth”. Sorry. Clearly polite could, hey - want antagonistic sarcastic it, it.

Or better yet, complain downvotes first place willing discussion. live studio apartment patently untrue. actually data variants. Novavax quite comparable Pfizer Moderna vaccines is. I’m optimistic J&amp;J go two dose regimen. They’ve started phase 3 trials two-dose regimen. vaccine already seems provide protection single dose, hopefully second dose close efficacy gap even further.  Good them. Liberal states same! source know claim probably factory that's behind schedule. think anyone believes deranged. OCD, take fluvoxamine for. sedating effects turned normal zombie, turn brain continuous state freakout something vaguely resembling normal. I'm sorry preference angers you. hope able go day.  New York Times, one, pretty vocally anti-doomer. today, arguing vaccines excellent preventing severe illness there's every indication vaccines reduce overall public health impact covid flu, allowing us return living normally. Right cash cow

Edit: look also insulin... cost nothing charge point people can't afford it... disturbing amount articles recently published demanding continue social social distancing vaccine. We've goalposts repeatedly moved, flattening curve, geting past spike, vaccine, knows when? zero COVID cases? knows be? 

It's reasonable ask vaccinated people wear masks public indoor spaces, grocery store, better handle vaccination impacts transmission. 

Beyond that, able pretty much anything want. See friends, indoor dining, travel, going gym, whatever. lockdown devastating impact mental health, let people get back normal life point. 

In fact, demanding social distancing post-vaccine may end prolonging pandemic. Returning normal life best incentive give people take vaccine. tell people change behavior post-vaccine, many take it, cause pandemic go longer fewer vaccinated people. think good strategy may look NovaVax's readout, reported [89% efficacy US strains 48% South African [We probably assume something roughly similar happen [Moderna reported sixfold drop neutralization South African [Pfizer reported 2.5fold may matters, hopefully, matter! example, Moderna's assay NT50 50 units protective average vaccinee neut titer 500 units, maybe drop matter. J&amp;J data hints outcome - [even dipping 57% efficacy mild disease South Africa, enough keep vaccinees, including South Africa, 

It's understandable cautious, ideal world we'd data every variant every vaccine. hope everyone able get vaccine feel comfortable with. circumstances we're now, may realistic option - circumstances, hope everyone take first vaccine they're offered. It’s happening Europe, us. :-( rather see safety trials done abs 100 percent safe proven

that's exactly they've done, faster usual. 

you understand cancer disease, right? category diseases. never single cure cancer, cancer drugs target cell growth thus huge potential problems often cause bad side-effects cancer cells similar normal cells. want train one's immune system attack healthy cells, would REALLY bad. makes really hard develop safely. vaccine virus much simpler comparison, exposing B cells something ""looks like"" virus question. regular cells ""look like"" virus, risk much lower.

it's valid comparison, paranoid reason productive. spreading FUD. record, completely agree you, crazy even 2 months ago opinion would've downvoted oblivion sub. Nice see people finally becoming nuanced this. severe lung damage symptoms that? gonna source make claim. Sure - years now, we're literally middle pandemic struggling much reopen basic functions like schools restaurants travel, it'll perfectly normal people say ""I'd like select Moderna Astrazeneca"". way might prefer Tylenol Advil.

But we're thick it, saying ""I'm really happy option protecting ongoing pandemic, wish could go options B C"" sounds tad unappreciative much incredible effort went 3 options. yet, percentage infected getting two doses still rises. doesn’t work people travel internationally; years whole world vaccinated. interesting article brought thought- first vaccines rolling out, may difficult develop new/improved vaccines months available supply people haven’t disease vaccine dwindles. guess that’s generally good problem have, there’s highly resistant variant- potentially difficult problem I'm clean areas that's little overboard...I sanitize hands that's it. Maybe door handles per day would smart. ironic sanitize mask. number infected full vaccination rose 0.07%. check got SA, UK normal strain. mean tie question “is getting overhyped” vein death rate find best determine legitimate curiosity vaccine vs antivax ""just asking"" type questions designed lead people conclusions. There's lot people unsure vaccine due timeline want lump genuine uncertainty nefariously want lead people astray. always want alleviate fears best can. also remember frontline doctors nurses never seeing representative sample. Every COVID patient treat someone whose illness severe needed go hospital, means they’re already outlier. don’t actually see patients feel really sick week, feel better, even though millions severely ill patients.

Losing dozen patients 30s 40s COVID undoubtedly traumatic experience haunt forever. yes, could happen anyone. anyone also slip ice fracture skull, doesn’t mean it’s likely. Based voting patterns biggest subs I'd say Reddit 90% neoliberal. follow number progressive subs, nearly traffic say, r/news r/politics. 

The way tell support neolibs Obama, Biden, Hillary huge. Also support US intervention military covert countries like Venezuela Iran enormous. far left positions. 

Far left people like Bernie, hate war, generally anti-interventionist especially target socialist left leaning government. True, particular deal goes effect next year, affect 2021 numbers. part, guidance see anyone outside household. guidance see outdoor settings, maintaining social distancing limiting number people present. 

When guidance become strict, usually response alarming increases case numbers, presence new, even highly contagious variants, etc. 

And yes, given know vaccines prevent infections along illness, still isolate post-vaccine. 

My point people talk choice. something fact virus responsible restrictions. Railing lockdowns equivalent screaming sky blue. No, people understand science fine.

A 95% 60% efficacy vaccine similar benefits *for society*. absolutely *not* similar benefits *for individual*.

People rightfully concerned getting COVID-19 themselves, rightfully want receive higher-efficacy treatments. mass rollout lower efficacy options going create mess: people calling around find higher efficacy options refusing vaccines arrive appointments “lose lottery”. inevitable cases occur people received lower efficacy vaccines, word spread anti-vaccine proponents ammunition.

The propaganda campaign we’re seeing right pump AZ J+J shots precisely public officials realize selling tough bill goods. announcements public figures like Dr. Fauci intended reduce hesitation receive lower efficacy vaccines, akin initial inaccurate information provided public asking wear masks conserve supply - well intended falsehood goes individual interests.

This campaign going encourage anti-vaccine sentiment unless officials start acknowledging elephant room: asking people sacrifice personal well-being accelerate societal recovery months. You’re Reddit doctor don’t tell us personal research findings What’s efficacy rate shenanigans? whole thing UK variant “hitting us like category 5 hurricane” next 6-14 weeks? media spewing bullshit? It’s absolutely infuriating makes want drive cliff. I’m saying drawing conclusions based popular science article bullshit serves many people’s preconceived notions. article made distinction someone go get food someone throws party someone invites one friend over. actually look study? Nope. headline snappy! NYC role model tackle Covid-19. 

It’s going studied multiple generations hundreds years. they're committed, there's good chance convince them. 

Get available, convince many people can. 

Show got fine, eventually may come around see people gotten vaccinated fine. mRNA based HIV vaccine please. feel bad people may infected. Sure hope healthy you.

By way, finding time long term effects disease. hit everyone like valid risk lot us. live die. think what’s great J+J potential *actually* make Covid “just flu” even “just cold” huge portions population. However, think 65+ underlying condition valid reason try get ahold one MRNA vaccines J+J, since even flus colds kill/severely knock elderly + at-risk.

tbh though think lot people “picky” vaccines right musing armchairs probably take whatever’s offer comes time *actually* get vaccinated. general population starts getting vaccinated (if earlier, depending case + hospitalization numbers) things inevitably going start reopening, it’s going *lot* harder protect effectively without going strict quarantine - people eventually going stop masking + distancing, stores going get crowded, people use public transit again, etc..

I form asthma that’s sensitive infections (have hiding inside last months take course prednisone + antibiotics clear annual case bronchitis) I’d obviously *prefer* Pfizer/Moderna, I’ll take whatever get. godsend. Side effects usual SSRI side effects plus lot fatigue. sleeping 12 hrs day first psych prescribe armodafinil counter fatigue. I'd already Zoloft 8 months cross tapered even notice side effects since I'd already gotten acclimated Prozac, except moderately reduced appetite couple days. Insurance cover armodafinil unless diagnosed sleep disorder, get $25 month WellRx coupon. well worth it. Anyway, back Zoloft, 6 months often intense therapy typically YBOCS score around 10 good days 20 bad days, half good days half bad days. Luvox I'm around 6 good days 13 bad days, 70% good days 30% bad days. Absolutely worth it.

BTW, take 150 mg extended release Luvox bedtime, 100 mg armodafinil morning. Yeah, we're going see cases vaccinations drop next couple days. Nobody read much please. think ""most vulnerable"" includes call groups 5 6, expected complete April. 3 weeks dates mention, 2 weeks week 6 deliveries. still happen lower incidence. key thing focus risk percentage. Chill. Lol, I'm pretty sure example soft tissue damage common v. particular ailment focus.

It's funny think weirdo scientist team curiously obsessed torn meniscus. US contact tracing practically useless

In US might true, many countries. ample evidence countries opening schools quite safe absolutely less harmful keeping closed. yeah, guys vaccinating like crazy too.

*I bot, action performed automatically. Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* agree guidance provided experts government often unhelpful, especially America clear directive people follow much last year. 

I think reasons directives sweeping exactly reason: every person sees exception rules lockdown constantly tightened made restrictive people aren’t abiding less restrictive guidelines community spread getting control. Look case thanksgiving Christmas. guidance travel, yet millions people travelled airplane, expected spike deaths cases following. 

People need socialization, spreading virus pandemic vulnerable people get very,very ill probably much worse mental health seeing them. 

Pandemic fatigue real thing, feel too. saddest thing everyone gone real lockdown 2-3 weeks beginning, travel, work, visiting friends, could avoided painful prolonged year shit. 

As reason still need social distance we’ve vaccinated, I’ve heard it’s don’t research whether vaccine prevents transmitting virus, know stops getting symptoms it. Nothing seems changed here. almost inevitable UK factories would used supply EU... UK's contract fulfilled. There's nothing say they'll get single dose that.

However... imagine vaccination programme complete, UK government allow even though 100m order complete then. Believe not, difference someone go get food go work someone insists throwing party, everyone holiday pandemic. Look happening L. A. hospitals last surge. Yeah holiday parties birthdays sucks, get that, selfish. full year lockdowns restrictions

In Poland almost restrictions June, July, August September. good case chickenpox vaccine. get chicken pox immune life. vaccine last 10 years need booster. don’t get booster get chicken pox adult it’s much dangerous.

To turn argument around, EU would stopping Pfizer delivering UK, making sure manufactoring sites inside EU prioritize EU deliveries. Pfizer free deliver manufactoring sites. basically UK did, difference UK via contracts.

""Very people 30s dying"" *

Enough fear mongering media. writer full shit stating essay Journal American Medical Association, wrote “preponderance available evidence” fall semester reassured agency adequate masking, distancing, ventilation, benefits opening schools outweigh risks keeping kids home months.

The actual text However, preponderance available evidence fall school semester reassuring insofar type rapid spread frequently observed congregate living facilities high-density worksites reported education settings schools. Variants happening entire pandemic; nothing magical happened past couple months “suddenly” create brand new problem (every single time virus circulates within specific community, mutates enough make unique “brand” area looking hard).

Basically, started hyping variants bs *because of* vaccines. Obviously it’s important keep track genuine mutation would make vaccine less effective...but Fauci said, point would UPDATE vaccine, run around blind panic like we’re square one again. 🤦‍♀️ Honestly...so much media. I’ve never appalled life; really trying get attention clicks, ethics journalistic integrity damned. don’t know live knowing literal GOAL life make people sad, scared, miserable possible. It’s despicable. Stop consuming one sided media. ask BBC question. carefully used ""Coronavirus variant first found UK"" couple months ago"". ""South Africa variant""  Well UK basically trial 65 age-group AZ's behalf.  Hopefully turn effective safe, I'm confident will.  even does, trials still disaster, get data done. I’ve heard nothing praise Luvox people OCD. regular doctor actually recommended specifically always concerns side effects OCD medication. ever decide try managing medicine again, it’s first drug list. However, everyone affected differently. might side effects commenter might zero side effects (or anything between).

Source: live street away protests  want schools open? Vaccinate teachers. priority

Yes, manufacturing facilities US. European ones produce vaccines EU customers. probably rest world... wonder well fight long-hauler’s disease. waiting Vaccines Facts expert opinion stopped mattering hardcore covid believers soon pointed something didn’t like. fact matter experts recommend going back school, evidence points return school less risky costly keeping kids school. It’s really strange group who’s mantra “follow science” willing abandon experts. 

It’s almost like loyalty test nothing keeping people safe.... mom eligible? so, go dad. may chance could get one too. Couldn’t hurt. sounds like really get different job hate much. can’t imagine positive influence younger person really feel way. really surprised hear governor officially allowing state schools re-open month. We're anywhere near herd immunity, long schools continue ignore mental health students staff, in-person classes going make anything better. largest component Australia's success always going hard start, roll back moderate foothold. far late replicate now, Perth delaying here.

Most countries *did* go hard start, high successes new variants and/or higher infection count made things harder. Taiwan, South Korea, Vietnam, NZ, (I'm willing take downvotes), China itself.

I personally hope message part world heard next, potentially worse, pandemic. *Also*, even context even covid, variants seemingly immune response resistant Brazilian P1 still yet prevented getting foothold rest world. first half gonna lie. find lack influenza year disturbing. skipping it? makes sense exactly what's wrong American thinking this. Paywall. purchase granger? always says “unavailable purchase” online shows ignorance.

HK? Hardly. I'm citizen country handled well, 2020 'slow' year me, still travelled 100,000 miles 5 continents.

Most us severe lockdowns 'covid deniers', however use term clearly cannot consider nuances. 

And please tell tens thousands people Australia (and NZ) work airline hotel tourism sector everything fine. selfish (and blind) claim entire industries decimated country. 

I've spent lot time Australia, unfortunately felt lot people validated past year. nice, kind, intelligent people there, stereotype Australians sadly reinforced like spread ugliness untruths here. Homie thumbnail literally nose getting vaccinated. Can't make shit up. could, won't. Lightfoot said multiple times Sunday ""our schools safe"" told CTU leadership needs return bargaining table. various definitions word ""safe."" There's people lot countries, mine included, people use masks flu season colds. really anything crazy.

Edit: might mention live Asian utopia either, live Latin America likely silent hypoxia didn’t realize couldn’t breathe. point damage done... Parts Midwest really crappy October, even Minnesota it’s supposed snow October times year, meant indoor gatherings obviously

I don’t think sole cause, believe could also factor though. mask fit better go first, usually medical mask. important thing mask fit well face gaps mask skin, otherwise air would go *around* mask instead *through* mask, additional filtration offered second mask would help. mention enzyme inhibition fluvoxamine causes. Especially caffeine, turns half life something stupid like 6 days drink coffee lol prick already. 

&amp;#x200B;

So ready shit over. Thanks, that's question answer makes sense. wondering got covid vaccine still worry long term issues (blood clots etc)   finally feeling hopeful feel like experts predicting nowhere near over. can’t take much more. hardly get log work morning. I’m losing appetite. mental health tanked. Spain 250k people vaccinated...in total think mask thing pretty reasonable thing ask people tbh. expect stay mandated least encouraged summer 2022. Though everything else, bars, concerts, restaurants, travel, etc probably occur summer least US rate. Yeah agree seems like surge started mid October (which even assume Halloween) seems early  Keep eye protein based vaccines (aka Novavax). able mix variant proteins one shot. also working combined flu covid vaccine  No.

You shut economy gets devastated people stop taking precautions.

It’s got balance.  believe predicted hospitals would widespread across nation overwhelmed unable even basic care one point, never happened. kid far behind teach risk, child taught take risk forever always remain behind peers. think UK variant definitely factor, feels like biggest thing probably holiday gatherings.

Looks like big spikes coordinate people getting together Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's. Hopefully that's behind us, think Superbowl going big Thanksgiving Valentine's Day already kind intrahousehold thing.   that's ! that's reason splvtoon looking for. People fed up, depressed angry want new restrictions. riots show that. So, governments try find trade offs statistics bad, say ""you see wanted warn ! coming back become strict total collapse health system"". seen couple reports people declining vaccination, saying wanted wait Oxford one. (Only two vaccines currently approved UK.)

someone know saying waiting Johnson Johnson. seen week idk still 60% want get line 95% (they first dibs either way want due age) Coronavirus doesn’t survive well outside body. studies showing survival time weeks surfaces, that’s ideal laboratory conditions really large amount virus. Whenever read experts actually interpreting studies, say you’re gonna get infected surface unless someone active infection coughs directly touch within like hour. three weeks way beyond safe limit. Especially cloth belongings. ""The vaccines appear work well South African variant.""

Next sentence

""The vaccines work, appear prevent serious illness death"".

This literally gibberish. They've tested multiple vaccines South Africa. ""Variant"" UK USA since sept. Travel SA extremely limited cases dropped 100k per day last month. I'll BUCKLE prepare HURRICANE!! reality complaining school closed really care education want public daycare. That's study interviewed parents country long teachers teaching students.

It one guy writing article long children's teachers taught. feel world moving towards anti-science sentiment creation echo chambers perpetuated social media. think social media companies held responsible much misinformation? Yeah little oversight international travel countries recently. There’s way hasn’t months. Given US doesn’t sequence often, wouldn’t surprise wave wasn’t lot variants.  Well, that's true. Indeed. scary times, Covid 19, governments across world take everything away blink eye. begrudge Australia success, hate way success countries (almost part world, article notes) become excuse accuse country wanting enough.

People understand contexts hard work enough, also need luck. countries failed control try hard enough control it. couldn't. 

What worries countries decide Australia copycat strategy eliminate virus, find longer long lock hard shut borders, can't it. worse trying all. long think SA / BR here? I’d bet months  basically line. There's uk export ban, bought first 100 million doses. 

Mps hinted rollout vulnerable finished (so, weeks) might send EU. There's nothing vague words moment though. Ok that’s fine *me*?

/s planet live on? Marin County 73% ICU beds taken up. Whatever working.

No, trust European health agencies. trust Taiwan, New Zealand, Australia. Norway great, sure trust now. Check Norwegian travel restrictions. Check going West Australia first case seen 12 days.

Yes, CDC power recommend prevention interstate intercontinental travel. failed recommend this. never made real attempt contain virus, moved straight mitigation March 2020. actually encourage vulnerable risk exposed creating safety theater. think long enough significant data long COVID. Probably still need 3-6 months large enough pool people got vaccine got COVID see many symptoms last longer 2 months. ""And health crisis becomes economic one, Beasley worries funding might dry up, causing starvation enormous scale.""

The article speculates loss funding would mean. That's all. Every country dealt covid differently country economic fallout. There's valid arguments could better managed covid crisis, nothing article argues lock downs. sold argument need businesses open kind indoor activity.   know people gotten fear we'll start told wear masks flu season now. really think that's going happen, - realize easily start swaying people, get little nervous. 

How sway people? releasing stats number flu cases flu spread media release story story people's grandparents dying flu. Hell, even show us stats many people *colds* ""how fast cold viruses spreading year!""

People blissfully unaware ""dangerous"" human. Present right stats narrative them, probably get people anything now. “Heros don’t work here” cannot, Im sorry dad. Sure, one vaccine available I’ll take it, don’t act like it’s unreasonable care difference efficacy Fauci predicting “young children” 

Yeah, here's thing. going happen studies performed ""young children"" age 12. one talking studies earliest late year probably next year. getting EUA, almost impossible get children (the studies much scrutinized everyone). likely can't make mandatory school comes EUA gets regular approval. seen couple reports people declining vaccination, saying wanted wait Oxford one. (Only two vaccines currently approved UK.)

There's legitimate reasons this. mother reaction something last year gp said go Oxford one. works hospital. 

There's also location, 80 year old great uncle struggled get vaccination site Pfizer (limited due storage) eventually found solution within rules. got Pfizer one.

In uk There's also ""get uk one"" element that's foolish. work, get offered. thing everyone doing. 

Also, congratulations jab! post somehow sarcastic sounding guy replied intentionally sarcastic.  mean? thing meniscus rupture it, never heal.

That’s many people die get sick anyway.

Don’t let perfect enemy good. Vaccines aren’t designed 95% avoidance symptomatic illness. fact one, two vaccines miracle beyond comparison. J&amp;J providing 72% protection 100% protection death ONE shot doesn’t require ultra-cold storage, also miracle Exactly saying!!! 
First two weeks, two months, masks, one within six feet, traveling... 

How much longer expect people like this??? relative youngster compared experienced co-authors happy take whatever vaccine get. 

It hard visualize kind scale even scientists. Mike Waters amazing job genotoxic vs. safe chemicals.

But think case would something tangible, like height. 

14 pennies ~21 mm tall stacked. 

Mt. Mitchell, tallest peak side country sticks ~1.9 million mm. 

So terms anaphylaxis inch risk mile safety.  Absolutely absurd government pushed known risky behavior Continuing prior projects? I'll use f Google. Top Covid-19 vaccine appeared lose small bit effectiveness engineered virus three key mutations new coronavirus variant found South Africa, according laboratory study conducted U.S. drugmaker.

Hmmmmm....  actually remember that, least reading it. also someone semi-public figure right (like, well-known financial person era many women think?) super well-documented life, sued shit publisher both. beg pardon? care anymore.  Ah look parroting “bad news” headlines you’ve seen idea means context. article 

“A six-fold reduction neutralizing titers observed B.1.351 variant relative prior variants. Despite reduction, neutralizing titer levels B.1.351 remain levels expected protective.” Read said loud Liam Neeson’s voice. 10 million shipped Turkey already, 2 million Chile, 2 million Morrocco, Serbia 1 million, 1 million Peru. can't find numbers Egypt, also received shipments. Indonesia Philippines. 2021, Sinovac approx produce 1 billion, Sinopharm 1 billion, help global effort combat virus, otherwise shit longer can't get developing countries immunte. UAE vaccinated 30-40 percent already almost solely due Sinopharm. Serbia second UK Europe vaccination around 7 percent, received 1 million Sinopharm thousand(!) Biontech vaccines. seems push vaccinate currently.

Which funny given US/UK exporting none products, expect China it, actually vaccination relatively slow compared US/UK almost zero cases, assume export vaccines, read Western media. Somehow, someway, found way criticize China even though opposite saying.

This good news, barely mentioned anywhere. mentioned, somehow twisted evil plot Chinese world domination. believe full capacity sporting events sold concerts sizes take place? badly miss concerts! Considering vaccination began, unlikely enough time people build full immunity getting sick dying covid, likely already infected got infected vaccinated building immunity. hard choice. 3-4 months online learning risking infections.

My fiancee pretty safe. got first doses vaccine last week. go bars restaurants, go need, work groceries. 

Opening schools unnecessary transmission vector. instead turning schools vaccination centers *at least* vaccinate staff. Going back forth online learning in-person learning probably detriment simply keeping schools closed one semester. Link. I've like 45 nursing homes last months. Well run ones tight ship. visitors, screening, rapid covid tests, covid isolation wings, full PPE. 

I basically felt safer nursing home going eat. News consumption addiction hit record levels pandemic. profitable. clear vaccine killed anybody. Well isn’t data previous day? Monday Tuesday’s reports would Sunday Monday would make sense would low least Sunday Wait really? source that? Trending towards another huge week week case drop US today Noted TV psychologist Bob Newhart best advice people like similar situation...""Stop it. nuts? Stop it."" ask father lend even 250 mil? Alternatvely put yatch colection colateral borrow it. especially great rapid test vendor. Ok thanks think misunderstood article. thought saying could randomly ship 50% doses per vial been. probably putting amount doses fewer vials manufacturing reasons.

For reason thought bags potato chips open find half full air... No. I'm sick bullshit like posted. Yes posted thread scroll use f Google. 7 day av doses given 1.35 mil. 140 days june. 31.8 mil doses already given. vaccines approved adults (255 mil us) (140*1.35) + 31.8 = 220.8 86.6% adults getting first dose june 1. thats dont ramp distribution administration all. “by june” might littttle early think mid late summer chillin. nuke city something? 😂😂 Used love? listened Motown philly last week. Unfortunately think 2021 going largely case “let’s get everybody vaccinated see happens”. think events cancelled, it’ll mostly like 2020.

I don’t agree it. think elderly vulnerable vaccinated, pressure taken medical facilities, it. Open up, 100%. it’s looking like goal anymore. Misinformation vile evil. You’re better person am. book last year started distant outdoor hangouts. correct. adenoviral vector vaccines used places mRNA vaccines cannot, would almost entirely due cold chain limitations. pushing production distribution mRNA vaccines limit. there’s choice j&amp;j moderna one month, recommendation lay low hold tight. got source back 50% efficacy? “And Moderna study, people previously infected actually fewer side effects hadn’t.”

“But anecdotally, researchers hearing growing number people like Dr. Romano felt ill one shot. “They describe symptoms much vigorously,” Dr. Wherry said.”

I’m glad article needed title based anecdotal evidence rather actual scientific studies cited. sorry facts? Vaccines either 6fold decrease antibodies two latest ones 55% efficacy. Post article says otherwise I'm gonna give 1k. can't find one give me. Deal? time media brings video games. Imo, start limiting use them. Like don’t wear mask hanging friends restaurant (unless entrance). help little bit.   opened indoor dining area today.  People say survival fittest.  go Yeah was, added clarification case people thought good idea this. Correct, pandemic start reject insane inhuman restrictions. cases/million 10th, 2nd. deaths/million, 7th, #1. Oh, don’t get wrong, get vaccinated around end summer maybe end autumn. bad wording me.

What mean take year enjoy covid-free summer. generally don’t much fun winter summer main thing counts me. think anyone vulnerable extreme cognitive distortions giving right conditions. surfaces could explain nearly cases.

This really thing. Sorry, clear.

If trials, explicitly stated take advil/Tylenol around time injection, could possible could impact effectiveness. However, without instructions could understood achieved 95%+ effectiveness would include people taking these. common enough practice think significant amount people would taken it.

That said, right avoiding could make effective, 95% achieved exceptionally high satisfactory deploying. main concern making sure studies like looking people actively exposed virus semi-daily basis. people got vaccine they're eligible still staying home. cnn. CNN basically compromised right now. 50% cases Denmark new variant, think underestimate rate spread. Denier? Denying what? I’ve hit facts. I’m sorry counter ideas head. think I’m shit head going bars gyms since March? 

I’ve lock, smart this, haven’t caught covid. recognize pessimism going far. I’ve countered every single point you’ve made, time pivoted, changed subject something else I’ve also countered. R/conspiracy would us believe excess deaths happened pure coincidence nothing Sars Cov 2. miss days conspiracy buffs liked UFOs liked put ventilators. get vaccine also stay home getting vaccine, start developing version vaccine vulnerable. duplications mutations survive vaccine infectivity continual exposure, eventual evolve one evade people get vaccine. need deprive virus people infect period. virus still roaming world, might need boosters. rest world need vaccine sure. children en skeptics also eventually need jab. also rarely spreads outdoors we're wearing masks walking street. 

I'm not. Indoors, I'm enforcer, I've stared plenty dudes pull masks up. 

But outside transmission really thing. personally: 

- trigger claustrophobic panic attacks
- something mouth makes feel nauseous
- harder understand people customer-facing job
- I'm breaking like I'm teenager again

(I still wear them. I'm making cashier's life harder causing scene. still hate I'll thrilled mandates end.) guess that's true great side benefit cleaning. Tiffany Dover,

her friends call ""Topple Dover"" fucking suck, hate wearing them. everyday, I’m one people. strongly dislike it. People getting booster vaccines already. UK allows booster via another vaccine (although last resort matching one available time). Good late Ok Mr ""I'm Smarter literally every single immunologist disease specialist world"". distributed number stagnating misremembering? Unpredictability supply big problem major reason hospitals slower use have. Sometimes come one day, sometimes different day. weeks get doses, next get fewer. 

Without knowing many doses coming, hospitals keep supply people scheduled. can't count time delivery bc know many delivered. mind asking, talked see next they're vaccinated? must feel weird people vaccinated still lockdown foreseeable future. quotation marks around normal? hope that’s case. New daily cases hospitalizations falling rapidly. Hopefully trend continues vaccines get circulation, weather warms, people don’t mingle much holidays. Maybe head new variants take hold strongly. government giving unending emergency powers whatever, regardless evidence, arresting people protest fucking weird, anyone supports arrest civil demonstration also weird. obviously joking something similar really happened first day vaccination. government selected several EHPAD's (public nursing homes) give first jabs half residents refused vaccine... Hope: yes. make this. survive. might take little longer people think. beat thing. Maybe included post. Interestingly Bloomberg reports 1.3 million doses given today, day over... seen number past day two bump times think numbers sometimes slow come in.

We getting around 12-13% eligible population (adults) US least one shot. really pretty solid progress.

Edit: areas like New York reporting 16% increase delivered doses even better. Correct. Australia contracts Pfizer, AZ, Novavax. contract 10 million Pfizer vaccines. 

With AZ, 1.2 million made overseas, 50 million made locally Melbourne. good news help alleviate production concerns overseas. 

Australia also signed deal buy 51 million Novavax, that's off. 

From memory (someone correct longer case) plan send excess vaccines neighbouring countries Pacific. Israel well special deal pfizer, get first access return used test subject. Israel vaccination data shared directly pfizer. almost like, reason, states learned rely trust federal COVID-19 response... Again, volunteer time something passionate pretty strange prediction make considering cases hospitalizations rapid decline vaccine distribution going well, going get faster. Tomorrow 10 doses per 100 people Rapid reaction force hotspots. last twelve months leads think people can't trusted? still Europe though. ""Action taken."" gonna do? Fire them? Honestly, now's time actual general strike essential workers people forced go face face contact unsafely. pain organize know get away happening. yeah - get antibody'S ? want it.

It actually simple.

I've heard 'educated' people color claim skeptical vaccine rapidly developed wait see anyone receives 'grows third arm.'

I understand skepticism took vaccine moment available me. key listen actually say, sound bite headline.

Our current knowledge variants shallow error bars estimations wide. crucial US countries similar situations continue expedite vaccine rollout encourage safer behavior reduce spread, worst case scenarios variants managed sort effort.

There’s *huge* difference that, experts saying, “lol variants coming guess fucked.”

We currently good position win race. Doesn’t mean guaranteed win threat, course emergency really zero cases.  Even article discussing using terms low-income country high-income result: “**High-income countries** 16 percent world’s population currently hold 60 percent vaccine doses purchased,” Taylor 80 million Covid-19 vaccine doses distributed around world far. 55 — 55! — gone people **low-income countries**. fact, one country: Guinea.

They absolutely discussing total GDP China *not* high-income country. farmed species suffers mink. wickedly intelligent yet crammed cage size 4 shoeboxes, 2 long 2 high. American mink industry horrific ever expected - industry isn’t getting inspected unspeakable atrocities keep costs down. whole industry deserves obliterated. Florida shut greyhound racing one gave shit livelihoods families run kennels. actually treated really well. I’ve since 2008 currently dogs 3 4. abused animal won’t run isn’t fast. dogs run love to, born to. breed best rehoming rate breeds 90%. Kennels actually get inspected since I’m passionate breed say deep certainty vast majority dogs extremely well treated. I’m also veterinarian watched behind scenes footage lens. 

I’m disgusted we’ve kept mink farming giving entire greyhound industry middle finger. 

It’s matter time mink exposed Amazon variant, especially since it’s already Wisconsin. never, ever control covid US mink fur farming banned nationwide. Fuck farmers, don’t deserve sort compensation shutting cruel, pointless business runs suffering. Found Ursula Von Der Leyen’s account AZ said 12 weeks perfectly fine.

And AZ problems EU centres, UK centres fine, thanks UK much better prepared EU was.

Also, there's two UK produced vaccines expected approved time now. That's 200 per state.... supposed be? Advisors? Considering Perth zero cases winter I'm convinced. magically know care variants modeling vaccine distribution started holidays? I've literally conversation several times last week. Strong agree.

Although little bit credit perhaps due vaccines ordered straight away, especially light EU dithered trying haggle any. really favours (and saying remainer) think EU ""the bad guys"" issue, fact organisation end incompetent affects 20+ nations opposed independent countries handling things relative needs.

The issue functional, ideological. advantage EU ends favouring weaker members much larger members, would hope - doesn't, seriously consider point organisation actually is. Victoria already closed borders affected areas Western Australia. Anyone comes quarantine 14 days. US hoarding vaccines. manufacturing them. Getting vaccinated like 6 week process advertised maximum immunity. There's large window getting shots clear. fair point cases window refuting efficacy vaccine. _""Yet contract reached Matt Hancock's desk, former adviser said, health secretary refused approve it, include provisions specifically committing supply UK first.""_

This one good move Matt Hancock pretty obvious one that. NHS made happen ground experienced and, importantly, motivated get done ease pressure staff. imagine gone Serco Capita one parasite companies donate Tories... Bloomberg updated. 31.8m doses prefer stick newspapers:

;) took newspaper meant. mean, U.S. also roughly 10 vaccine doses administered per 100 people roll-out ramping here. that's gonna put big-ass dent R time March rolls around like US genomically testing huge numbers samples. 

for know (*hope*) what's slamming hospitals.

&amp;#x200B;

you think ""went grandma's house"" rest crew?

lots opportunities.

&amp;#x200B;

TSA checkpoint travel numbers (current year(s) versus prior year/same police beat shit black people peacefully protesting. warned. Sorry, autocorrect.

I meant buy lard Everyone seemed really good spirits. Lots laughing joking around. I'm sure like Christmas day health care staff. sense there's overwhelming feeling relief, able deliver vaccine, many people taking offer vaccinated.

For personally, I've strictly locked indoors year due highly vulnerable category, finally feel like there's light end tunnel now. what's old? 70?60?50? Would happy delay reopening month two help? slow down, delay reopening - costing billions.

 vaccinate Europe? slow compared Britain sure, still faster countries! South Africa needs lot help? Americas (Brazil, Mexico, Argentina?) plants made somewhere around 15 million doses Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine - less ministers said would made stage (early pandemic said would 30 million autumn).

The following part refers part above. means UK plants made 15 million, 4 million four million fill-and-finish process.

And following part related UK used plants Germany Netherlands early batches.  government also invested plant Wrexham ensure domestic capacity. Again. think much dependant live demographics area.

Also mention videos. making things up? love everything else it! Literally everything. situation sucks. isn’t EU rest world production facilities vaccines. make sad. Okay then, over? Give people endgame reason hope ffs don’t think it’s selfishness all. Canada averaging less 140 deaths day, United States 4,000+. 

We cases death anywhere planet. don’t much choice right vaccinate first. 

Hopefully soon we’ll able help Canada out. lost 1.5 years lives, dumbass! world they? think official plan right state, think possible we'll switch this. Nothing firm CDC changed guidance giving 65s asap shown proof videos say true. shown proof comment. Show video mass people wearing masks anywhere.

My videos show mostly masks maybe two people best. one damaged, redeem future. impressed half arsed export ban rescinded hours later.

That said, deeply suspicious role AstraZeneca playing here. Corruption UK time high, surprised conservatives negotiated company's board secret give Tory government win EU. kids older (11&amp;5) definitely similar waits vaccinations. No. Theres contradiction vic government said adf said. side vic government particularly single state used adf security still dont. watched pressers woild see took culpibility needed worked harder pollie around. practiced preached unlike 99% politicians.

Youre saying proactive instead reactive. ask wearing masls. Guess what? Masks proactive measure. Sick arm chair experts saying would done. almost unprecedented handled great thanks us great leadership army too. planners critical this. Nice bit military budget going saving lives rather bombing war. several states least, along nations. looks primarily Pfizer issue, seems 1) they're giving short notice, coupled 2) they're slowing convert manufacturing lines ramp event greater production  20 30 covid vaccinated countries world EU. 

Sigh.. realise absolute majority countries dont even vaccinations sight youre hating EU... We’re still getting deliveries Moderna. Things pick soon enough I’m guessing there’ll travel corridor U.K. US June/July people 2 vaccine doses month trip. countries probably want capitalise summer holidays &amp; get tourist dollars/pounds. Flights London NYC summer currently £250 return I’m tempted buy ticket already &amp; reschedule flight (it’s free) case borders remain closed. Stop trying one-up people!  What, like getting 50% meal ate restaurant global pandemic? determined entirely individual states. general, states offered healthcare personnel first roughly going age thereafter. guess doors thrown open 50 crowd time. well... yes? ordered vaccines themselves, don’t see point keeping extra vaccines don’t need person political position open criticising dissecting faults positions chosen team basically zealot. I'm strong remainer learn EU learn circumstances led us point. 

I mean still think severing free trade biggest trade partner astronomically stupid thing country voted modern history, mean eu perfect stretch imagination. think February. wow sounds like know something scientist don't. tell us more! really fed UK hate. country expected give away much-needed vaccines rich, developed nations, UK bad guy propping EU 1,000 Brits die every day Covid?

I days now. uk currently worst hit country Europe people complaining doses even put eu near making difference. 

The commission week taken trump level approach towards uk AstraZeneca. Claiming vaccine war well uk government said nothing. False claims coming german news x
Oxford vaccine (even medical board said enough data, german government condemned articles too), failing find evidence either uk ""stealing vaccine"" AstraZeneca lied plant problems (the team confirmed issues Belgium plant). One plant used fill finish, that's found. 

Meanwhile, reddit, ""uk bad, killing Europeans!"", think pr damage done. blamed uk create enemy could use distract failures people bought it. Meanwhile, political circles triggering articles 16 northen Ireland protocol seems killed lot trust. relatively young person. happy get J&amp;J vaccine means older relatives get Pfizer/Moderna faster. 

If needed, always get re-vaccinated Pfizer/Moderna shot later 2021/2022 available. Anti-vax believers critics J&amp;J two different things. reddit. Chances high poster like 17 really know success Brexit, failure EU. EU commission competent, could similar vaccination figures. said 100m end April believe. EU gets nothing? source that? risk groups vaccinated, lockdowns end normalcy return. Lol. didn’t mean anything Biden. I’m Biden fan. silly. isn't, reason live fear indefinitely like we're Covid. I'm glad people beginning realize this. Nothing changed past year except fact data continues demonstrate 40 ton comorbidities, COVID poses level risk run mill flu season. yes, sometimes healthy 30 year old die influenza related pneumonia, chances happening astoundingly low.

Once older, vulnerable, etc. opportunity get fully vaccinated, absolutely reason drop 90-95 percent restrictions lockdowns. Life never cannot continue exercise avoiding every single infectious disease known man. 23 mln J&amp;J Q3. 10 mln Q2. Availability clear. 

I say, vaccine low efficacy. Theres way higher chance disease coming waiter front respecting handeling food, versus kitchen.

There’s length time playing table fact kitchens high standards large stuff

I’m cook, serve 500 dishes night aren’t washing hands constantly throwing anything gets germs; 500 dishes people bound get sick frequently place gone Yeah, count official cases. majority cases go undiagnosed, increases denominator large amount IFR. see click link attached - CDC estimates IFR well 1% overall; .003% 20 .02% 20-49. Sorry facts align well preconceived notions. think quarterly bonuses shareholders! know months many others still gonna saying ""in months..."". People also saying expect level normalcy come Fall. Fall come say Spring. half year begin discussions animal reservoirs virus guess mention either remission cancer immune system compromised.

Hopefully live enlightened area allows you, somebody actual risk, get vaccine. Somebody family immunocompromised thanks state's insane vaccine rollout plans eligible until.... well get straight answer. Suffice say, found.... ways.... get vaccine.

Had lived sane state like florida (and you) could got vaccine basically day one introduction. sincerely hope so. Ive enough it. Im done putting life hold seeing eyes public work. Amen

Still

We shall see goes WIDE, babay Ive heard office information sheets state give vaccines told give tylenol vaccinations. way deaths July everyone chose wait like you.

I really agree. Deaths going drop (near) zero next two months anyways, everyone 65+ vaccinated.

Additionally, think actual choice wait not. Presumably cities get Pfizer/Moderna rural areas get J+J/AZ. live city, didn't, I'd willing drive. people choose get vaccinated nearest site. daughter saw friend 13th symptoms later week friend tested positive 25th? sounds like lot contacts within family daughter may actually given friend since showed symptoms much earlier friend. let everyone know family interacted past two weeks wife tested positive.    messaging, fact things like hospital capacity cut bone years closing consolidating hospitals medical offices USA save money. much surplus capacity handle pandemic ordinary medical emergencies time. patients die covid19 care homes can't afford many staff. they'll fire staff anyway. improve chance attract elderly, choose fire staff havn't vaccinated. reach point either way fewer patients dead. CNN great journalists organization whole focus much providing people “truth” vs providing people information bars actually speak people come Yes. it. Dude, wearing mask without complaint whole time following SD guidelines better 90% people know. wear mask everyone WANTS vaccine get one. done trying protect people refuse help themselves. want keep wearing mask protect anti-vax Karin go right ahead. SDW? Hahaha, love new term. Sadly FB newsfeed flooded :( Hey Jonathan, thanks taking time answer questions scary dangerous topic.

My question is, psychological end goal antivaxer, assuming one ?
What power denial science give ? like young people also die flu. Yup, happened us! Angry selfish realize actions consequences, hm? What's difficult know.

When Pfizer Moderna underwent clinical trials, *prior* emergence new variants. full-length spike sequence insert vaccines largely matched virus circulating time - hence stellar efficacy data.

J&amp;J NovaVax, way contrast, *far* higher bar clear. time trials rolled out, contend Wuhan variant, least half dozen variants, structurally different original virus. reduced efficacy vaccines, especially preventing mild disease. J&amp;J especially thorough staging sites globally many different variants.

Of note, Pfizer Moderna's vaccines *also* impacted variants - read emergence variants, know much impacted. would naive assume still 95% effective variants - NovaVax's readout (\~90% effective US, &lt;50% effective South Africa) strongly suggests this. know *how* much they're impacted formally tested clinical setting.

But J&amp;J's data suggest that, hopefully, may matter. anyone even hospitalized South African cohort *despite* lower efficacy. may mean that, even dent efficacy, vaccine still effective enough. hope also true Pfizer Moderna.

tl;dr: J&amp;J/Nvax Pfizer/Moderna trials occurred **very** different conditions efficacy can't compared directly (Pfizer Moderna's data fantastic OG COVID outdated). smart play get vaccine offered.   mean *interim* analysis Phase III programme conducted Oxford University AZD1222, peer-reviewed published Lancet today""

It literally says ""interim"" first sentence.

Also, critique study, AstraZeneca said “additional analysis conducted.” amount misunderstandings thread hilarious FYI:

\* CureVac **mRNK** vaccine, i.e. similar Moderna/Biontech

\* Expected delivery **in 2021 160 mln**. Worldwide, much Europe, know

\* Expected allowance March(according Spahn, Minister Heath Germany) disagree drastic measures April March harsh, speak first hand experience, Ecuador. locked mid March, situation bad anywhere world seen, seen since. People dying faster bodies could dealt with, even expiring line hospitals...lines stretched around block. solid data available inform response...but something, extreme, happen without luxury time experience guide choice.

That said, worked, mostly. one expects end without terrible human cost, severe economic blow. course...it's horrible disease. We're best can, better some...worse others. learned unheard duress. child? knee jerk response call people “selfish” bc different perspective tired old. shows really real argument. Like every one responses insult, different people. 

You aren’t morally superior, far it. I’m sure tearing people makes feel good, tolerance rest us over. Pretty sure fight going Chicago. Apparently not? Genuinely, think fear mongering? Yeah eliminated sickness. get sick can't go work. need able go work.

Plus long term effects thing. Especially find wishing dead 10 years long term effects.

I'll take vaccine. Wish wait til summer. I'll get matter what.  Hyperboleeee actually work out? seen waits price gouging exercise equipment last 9 months? organized elements anti-vaccine movement saw anti-restriction movement giftwrapped well new followers, anti-restriction movement saw anti-vaccine movement source methods, techniques, messaging. led significant growth anti-vaxxers, effective anti-restriction movement. 

Ultimately they're anti-public health. oppose public health measure believe individuals made take actions benefit collective. 

A lot arguments health evidence made good faith, responding basis evidence alone probably effective. 

That said line reasoning wrong reasons:

* Death negative outcome covid-19 infection. many people long lasting side effects. 
* Even experience symptoms, asymptomatic carrier infects others, causes die. includes older people, immune compromised, etc.
* Covid kill disable young people. 
* Even mandate wear mask, avoid gatherings, act like helps protect people. That’s good news; extra doses front loaded (Q2). problem :) became nurse, pathophysiology disease process personal geek-out lol. keep wishing Fauci someone similar would like lengthy televised “lesson” works, people could hear clearly, directly professional instead filtered garbled journalists. Maybe eventually it’ll happen... Schools shut meningitis extremely, extremely, extremely rarely, months end. Ya goal get many people board vaccine possible, don’t feel like “you won’t die!” going resonate population question. people 60 aren’t concerned (rightly wrongly) dying, concerned long term side effects mild asymptomatic infection we’ve seen headlined everywhere. fuck upvoted?

stepping outside house privilege now? sub delusional bordering insane. Can't respond directly without source, know lot studies defining ""mild"" ""did require extended hospitalization"" despite cases being, subjectively speaking, quite severe. No. You’re thinking J&amp;J one 66% it’s base. ones 94%. novavax anything go it’s 75+%. I'm going throw make sense probably help pile, like 95% theoretical treatments pan last year also make sense.

Yeah tired anecdotal articles trying push unrelated drugs ""possible cures"". wish better reporting hospital capacity extent dire predictions come true. hard understand outsider.

For example, December San Francisco closed outdoor dining banned gatherings preserve hospital capacity, husband went urgent care burned hand stove. Super chill, basically empty 9am Tuesday, talked one front desk person, two nurses doctor, seemed calm rush all. healthcare system strained not? make sense me. statistics cancer deaths? many people drive? many people infected covid? hospitalisation rate driving vs covid? hospitals overwhelmed car accidents? false dichotomy though? choices are:

1. Government pays wages tens thousands people would otherwise die survive
2. Go open job make 50% anyway half customer base show tens thousands people die could saved

Which better? One thing I'm told well still spread even vaccine?  thats another thing giving pause. contact tracing studies vaccinated, soon studies hard. let us say, hypothetically, never get direct data transmission post vaccination. still math data already have.

We know vaccines prevent symptoms 95% time. know people infected never develop symptoms extremely bad spreading :[One found infected 0.3% close contacts, showed infected 0.7% household members. know 5% develop symptoms probably vaccine mediated reduction symptoms, hospitalizations vaccinated volunteers far. pretty confident get mild symptoms far less likely transmit get severe symptoms. ""The secondary attack rate increased severity index cases, 0.3% (CI, 0.0 1.0%) asymptomatic 3.3% (CI, 1.8% 4.8%) mild, 5.6% (CI, 4.4% 6.8%) moderate, 6.2% (CI, 3.2% 9.1%) severe critical cases."" figures alone, assuming vaccine-mediated symptoms pattern spread natural infections, would expect 90+% reduction transmission post vaccination, compared someone vaccinated. case, much better evidence March.   I’m guessing sub longer trusting fauci? He’s social media’s regarding vaccine reflecting cdc polices March present. power really franchise employees? Franchise employees really payroll. Oh yeah! remember 2-3 times lower 1 (lol) 0.33 - 0.5, 33 - 50% 100% equal 95%!

My immune compromised neighbour know particular thankful everyone's actions here, older relatives, I. Thanks answering question :D Thank - article. getting painted nutty anti-vaxxer whenever question relative what? plummeting Christmas spike. #do take pain medication prior vaccination, company. name tpn. company would good making vaccine sites. group accidentally got 1/2 dose/full dose small number, 2,741 participants, better result could statically noise. also 65. submitted independent trial reviewer, would reject data powerful enough. variant strains delay return normalcy U.S.? It’s part 24 news cycle click bait headlines. general public needs little wise opinion articles. none perfect definitely finding browsing apnews, Reuters, npr top news little less sensationalized. Never perfect 100 doomsday headlines. can't wait able give mom huge hug, gets second dose Wednesday. I've using shitty cloth re-washable masks Old Navy (3-4) layer. trust/buy N95 KN95 masks online?

How many times use discarding? mainly go store work home. Also woodworking/painting project coming house think would useful well  True, I'd absolutely fine annual shot; difference getting shot keep immune system primed, emergency, reactive scramble get everyone vaccinated address latest, severe virulent version disease. 

I suspect whole concern around variants subside reinfections routine mild; still lot uncertainty long time Covid either mild, rare, both. seasonality nearly mirrors Hope Simpson model. Yeah it'll still keep work boss said he'd rather people dead coming work. easily replace one. other. Performing experiment expose people virus known cause disease basically allowed, due ethical concerns.   There's uptick papers issuing DMCA notices Reddit regarding links.

I used post links, light DMCA notices, I've stopped. Maybe ven diagram people wont vaccinated point people given shit virus whole time made worse needed basically going circle?

I wearing mask without complaint since CDC asked us tried give others benefit doubt, even antimaskers people think virus hoax whatever. TBH goodwill towards people runs soon everyone access vaccine give two fucks antivax idiot COVID conspiracy theorist gets sick point.

Why would wear mask someone refused give respect last 10 months? wouldn't. Call callous, dont really care. Wow. isn’t free fall don’t know is. Wait util vaccines also begin take hold month. Spring looking good! Hopefully public policy catches “good news.” peoples risk assessment weird. sister sends kid daycare, husband works office, shes getting massage weekend says haircut risky. think new phase working acceptance understand what's others' risk tolerances gotta ride support child hunger 100,000 people dead. 

This I’m applying move Australia. Fuck Tories fuck Tory bootlickers. Theres evidence kids infecting tons people see massive increase cases school back session, least US. would've expected see cases skyrocket august/september school session kids really mass spreading virus October.

I think make sense data telling us school mass spreading event, unless actually real study telling otherwise. can't scientific ignore data goes gut instincts. writing academically, would big fuckup. it’s easy brainwash laymen... read article female scientist developing researching mRNA since 1990’s BioNTech. Yeah different guy, situation looks good see. Thanks kid may fine. countless kids abusive parents, learning disabilities, poor internet connection be. It’s you. Exactly. 

My wife pretty careful lives since started. mean eating out, limited social contact others, going church, etc.

We received vaccine two weeks ago coming weekend weekend escape first time year. still mask things supposed do, two days dipping toes ""normal."" Guess we'll find vaccinations naught. 

Or numbers reflect vaccinations given, blame SA variant.

Should fun week.  Expectation boosters needed. Whether that's every year every six months know. minor ask order get back normal life.  necessarily true. recent reports severe lung damage asymptomatic cases. 

There's reports loads things, need actual, well designed studies without ton confounding variables controls. I'm yet see one, besides there's way knowing that's reversible yet - earlier lung scarring reported even symptomatic turned least partially reversible. pretty dumb dude. piece cloth. even really wear really go out. go bar restaurant ones really going expect wear outside maybe seated. Ecuador, proper lockdown since late last spring. restrictions: bars nightclubs closed, intermittent localized curfews, limited capacity restaurants stores, rules large social gatherings. addition, virtually 100% mask compliance, attendants every store market dispense hand sanitizer. recently, keeping infection rate 600-800 day, within healthcare systems capacity treat patients, even ICU. numbers getting scary again, so...

A return drastic State Emergency ruled Constitutional Court. hard limits emergency powers, I'm glad court chose rule law panic. even reasonable, arguably effective, measures place taking terrible economic toll. 70% restaurants closed permanently, tourism sector almost destroyed, unemployment roof, private debt astronomical, public debt charts. Donkeys room 
Monkeys side room BLM ''burn cities''. Quit ridiculous whataboutism. think society pays athletes something lol personally think probably causative link, problem can’t rule scenario tropical countries low case numbers solely testing systems weak inaccessible They’re skipping people internet hurt feelings. Importantly, study shows n95 exhalation valve effective reducing exhaled particles surgical masks, cloth face coverings. 

""These findings show FFRs exhalation valve provide respiratory protection wearer also reduce particle emissions levels similar better provided surgical masks, procedure masks, cloth face coverings.""

Also note, surgical mask over-top exhalation valve help, significantly would hope. best easy method recommend covering valve inside mask paper tape. reduces exhalation particulates 5%.

I think important get information masks currently stigmatized actually offer better public protection. minor modification, extremely effective wearer public. also widely available. here, hate needles well. looking definitely helps ton. single person died Covid

r/conspiracy would say otherwise Since source can't say sure talking about....But seem right. Hong Kong, people skeptical one China would prefer option choosing Western-made ones legitimate published results. shortening season sport normally 162 games big deal. pitchers catchers normall report February that’s delayed makes sense.  Anecdotes data. 5 people know got fine. Neither one anecdotes adds shit. quite 2m day yet soon especially people need second dose. Hopefully first doses increase well. really need 3m total day hopefully end Feb March would like 1.3 vs 0.94, since J&amp;J single dose Moderna Pfizer require two doses. say ""hopefully"" face multiple variants evolve quickly address them, little humoral immunity (i.e., antibodies, also T-cells) need go total elimination. 

I think that's likely outcome still risk vaccination ""one done"" even routine procedure every years. guys think winter surge variants it’s behind us now? seems make sense want be.

That and, know, overwhelming amount evidence they're feel like someone told shouldn't/can't drink shot 24 hours. true? way deliver RNA cells new tool treat cure diseases. That’s coming B list official nation execute spitting sidewalk. odds anyone 80+ dying given day much higher anyone else. Unless elderly dying droves getting vaccinated (they aren't) likely unrelated vaccines.

The vaccine questionable effects elderly Oxford vaccine, know sampling issues, can't say certainty vaccine safe 65 younger people. meant preventative agent. every high risk patient age 65, 1 15 won’t need hospitalized. calculates 6.7% patients. Definitely game changer, certainly worth looking studied. Well good news, Influenza nearly extinct wearing masks social covids still wearing masks social distancing 👍 expand research help long covid Whats 30 second, elevator pitch will, would give anti vaxer chance someone far gone? far rabbit hole conspiracy theories impossible get identity this? percentage people believe conspiracy theories believe like this?  mean group 6? Well long covid thing hope start covering Awesome. Sounds like need another pandemic. might able cure cancer thousands SARS-Cov-2 variants: [http://covid-19.dnageography.com/](http://covid-19.dnageography.com/)

Cherry picking couple using fear mongering good evidence robust evidence potential impact school settings yet available 

Exactly. Ugh, reading article like rollercoaster. mean jeez, awesome hope ok, family, DUH, take vacation?  swear, feel I've pretty good last 10 months, I'm reaching breaking point. done quarantine financially support at-risk let rest society go various safety measures distancing mask wearing.

Yeah, didn't, need behave like didn't. Instead healthy people got roped bullshit expected make sacrifices people generally don’t care health first place.

This absolute nonsense. millions people pre-existing conditions put higher risk virus others, conditions outside control. asthma; myself. take care health, take medicines manage symptoms, work regularly, shitty lungs. Yeah, society asking make sacrifices people like me. Get it. Part living society means taking care people sometimes. (And way, sacrifices healthy people asked make could lasted weeks months, thanks people like you, dragged damn near year listen public health officials objective facts virus spread.) I’ve ignored virus since day 1 doesn’t seem wrong

You idea many vulnerable people spread virus to. enormously selfish thinking. Like, awesome *you* escaped unscathed, knows many people could spent weeks months ill you? many people might died actions spread virus around? care actually carrying virus around shouldn’t smoked grandparents awhile ago?

No, that's virus works. There's always element chance it, means there's absolute guarantee around someone vulnerable means immediately get sick. could get sick time virus rampant. There's also element luck; maybe grandparents asymptomatic infections, would great, would atypical elderly people, still change fact A) would taken massive risk could killed them, B) behaviors could *still* getting people sick without knowledge contributing strain already overwhelmed healthcare system.

Like, people getting new infections every day. like everybody going get sick automatically beginning. never know could unknowingly pass virus onto someone never know *you're* infected. models wrong, useful. Take look model early December done UVA regarding amount cases state would week February said would almost 100,000 positive cases week. would require 14,000 reported cases day. Virginia's highest number 10,000 (2 weeks ago). Sunday 2600 cases today 2800 cases reported. positive cases numbers go week absolutely way hit numbers. 

One important attributes life figuring people saying almost important people saying. case, check news reported high (almost unlikely) numbers...  trial placebo arm I'd recommend get Pfizer Moderna asap. virus exist, course safe vaccine would death rate /s we’ve seen very, need admitted hospital  

That would seem like 1 15 needed admitted 14 15   seriously need report every time variant case detected? It’s common knowledge variants spreading now. People place. 

I assume makes people feel good saying everyone get best, actually saying lot people get nothing. fuckers something problem economy effects really expertise. keep comparing job software/website developer. fight tech side things working certain way. advocate specific timeline rolling things work perfectly. almost never correlates business needs terms making money. Sacrifices made developing websites order balance financial side it.

Even though company 100% based technology, get make decisions affect revenue. boss everything recommended, projects would take much longer, would function better, end we'd make much less money work. like serious economic decisions made based recommendations scientists health experts. 'inert' coronavirus 'reactivate'?

My father died 3 weeks ago I've storing belongings house's storeroom, mother asked retrieve belongings send her. put extra precaution picking delivering them? said back April 2020.

He went back vaccinations started getting way. Exactly. entire county 7,900 people. could vaccinated couple days, supply available. Yet, we'll still one lowest vaccination rates, because, yah know, Dems. think someone needs look definition anecdotal... People thought problem.there isn’t enough mRNA vaccines everyone. options stay awful restrictions 8-9 months, folks take amble end pandemic 3-4 months. think feasible. govt said plan done October. Seems reasonable. deserve it. rural texan = republican. them, we'd nevre deal shitty republican president again. mean rude but... people outside US trouble identifying states abbreviations.

And person tells 'well 'WA' 'Washington', obviously,' well done knowledge. I’m layman, understanding previously, selection pressure favor variant. vaccines potential number hosts shrinks, evolution favors variant. 


I might totally wrong though. Average daily doses rising 200K week. Seems like 2M day end February possible. probably explode degree UK think percentage Americans virus without variant people UK variant. reduce relative difference we're seeing... looking like masks come United States United Kingdom European Union. matter many die

If everyone dies, ends right there. Easy-peasy. 😋 Or.. could creating literal seven headed beast mix match. time tell. come rest pandemic? HOLD!! Basically, think God protect continue daily lives (that include studying Bible receiving income state. Payed form taxes).
And even attempt stop behavior - work. real issue orthodox jews escalated approach general Israeli society exclude regular obligations, meantime send reps parliament. vaccine 50% effective costs maybe 10 times much, what's fucking problem? Exactly. Everyone loves hate tories look rest Europe. We’re bad guys girls. got shot mega site. National Guard handled operations stuff, healthcare workers handled shot registration, MRC hand helping elderly like pushing wheel chairs. Save memory. Permanent Tory government find way render block block. Likely vaccine different effectiveness nasty new variants pop up. wider range vaccines population help keep new outbreaks contained.

If everyone gets vaccine &amp; new variant happens highly resisistant it, we're back square one like Fauci ridiculous. There’s reason can’t live life normal possible vaccine waited it’s fully effective. Well I’ll thank good lord every day you’re charge anything 9 million production problems largely solved according CEO. bring brings us 50 percent 80 million expected doses end March. happy vaccine finally approved, delivery rate better hope Johnson Johnson jab quickly approved. No. phizer data shows clear divergence placebo vs drug group number cases day 7 Ah pedant, order magnitude then. exit strategy vaccine. states find hard (emotionally) open borders accept cases happen low levels. states (like NSW) not. Australia generally pretty good vaccination rates.

There definitely downsides Australian approach, see talked relatively frequently Coronavirus Downunder subreddit. main issues personal travel related industries. majority Australians' lives unaffected effect missing holiday. Yes, people missing seeing family due hoops jump through. International travel expensive usually available privileged - way around.

But every country somebody losing out. places kids can't even go school see friends. places hospitals overwhelmed medical staff traumatic situations. places economy failing. places people can't see families risk high. many places people know someone died suffering Covid. exit strategy countries also vaccine. Australia different overseas, measurably imposing less citizens meantime. I'm enrolled Novavax study got first injection days ago. Within 30 seconds injection searing pain arm injection site. brought tears eyes, painful, gone within 60 seconds since I've pain, swelling, redness, nothing. thoughts whether could vaccine versus placebo? many people worried

lol headline go fuck Ohio already pushed back curfew/last call 11:00 plan rollback ultimately remove based hospitalizations we’re getting already. Nice! Los Angeles great our. r-effective .80 first time would wear mask someone refused give respect last 10 months?

Because pitching public ethics bar set lowest assholes around terrible embarrassing idea. Behave better disapprove. even hard.

In meantime, also significant remaining vulnerable population able get vaccinated due legitimate medical reasons, reckless people still entirely able infect. help prevent mutations forms escape vaccine. Hell, prevent people needlessly catching colds start circulating again.

People's angry resistance *stupefying*. Obviously whatever wish, right, headspace necessary view wearing mask unbearable burden continuing utility beyond ""keeping undeserving vaccine-resisters safe"" unfathomable me. can't compare Pfizer/Moderna effectiveness J&amp;Js. virus strain circulating phase 3 trials done different cases. Arguably J&amp;J vaccine contend mutated viral form.  believe Moderna/Pfizer would 95% efficiency phase 3 trials done now? Everyone Philly-Boston corridor snowed Wednesday. help cut numbers even since people staying home awhile. Game Covid that’s case.  former Well start, children categorically can't get vaccinated right now. want things normal, too, putting mask crowd big burden everyone 16 still risk.  Progress near? started progression yet? Someone tried tell life won’t normal 2024 day. Less 40% hsve given first dose vaccine. need alot people vaccinated that. mention vaccines give immunity right away takes another 1-2 weeks level immunity. sure true, least told vaccines coming emergency use, healthcare places even say vaccine they're given, waiting find place that's offering type want open appointment slot bit gamble.

I work hospital got Pfizer main campus location, coworkers went associate offices ended Moderna. None us choice matter informed we'd getting day first shot. real question effect phase 3 trials. yes, maybe follow advice. not, think data backs up. Possible? Yes. Likely? really. Okay appreciate detailed response, also understand everyone different level vulnerability, solution simple lock everything set everyone free. think certain point, comes respectful others’ needs. Personally think bending rules slightly acceptable situations people suffering mentally require socialising/local travel, example. You’re invading anyone’s space without consent, shouldn’t treated like you’re walking hospital full patients sneezing coughing every single one them. It’s well protecting high risk groups also unemployed, young people restoring economy would near enough impossible. Sure, nobody knows long it’ll really go everyone relies vaccines there’s definite answer, hasn’t almost year. impact people also serious, wish wasn’t taken lightly media would ease scaring everyone point crippling anxiety. hope too. thing concerns SA wing J&amp;J trial number folks got COVID placebo arm already COVID fucking insane. everyone called it, way back march. goalposts would move.

&amp;#x200B;

look, ""WizeGuy"", literally impossible scientifically study, real-time, possible risks. constantly new variants popping (this virus never disappear), always new questions answer. expecting studies verify new mutated variants protected vaccines every time there's new variant, literally **never going normal life again, full stop.** thousands variants already, studying takes funding, procedural red tape, *time*. 

&amp;#x200B;

studies side effects medication, safety vaccines, long term effects treatment getting virus, etc - things take *time*.

&amp;#x200B;

as far uncertainty vaccines mitigate transmission, malarky. already know principle method transmission, upper respiratory infections, infected droplet aerosol spread, know infectiousness correlated viral load, vaccine prevents infection 95% effectiveness begin with, definition prevent even viral load would used spread virus.

&amp;#x200B;

there people, seemingly one them, simply never going pleased goalposts keep moving impossible satisfy every ""what-if"". 

&amp;#x200B;

there two options. either accept risk life reasonably mitigate it, never leave homes again. lol - wait till something comes along kills children / ""healthy"" people. Traveling domestically car pretty safe avoid situations could exposed

Stopping circulation virus important much stopping deaths hospitalisation.

In fact, virus keeps circulate, see variants. Moreover vaccine evolutionary pressure, Darwin could teach, variants emerge even faster “stronger” term “vaccine-escaping”. see many variants next years escape current vaccines; yes sure new vaccines, can’t always run behind virus, one step forward.
So it’s really important stopping circulating don’t want beginning nightmare every years. 

Viral vector vaccines good “bridge” solution limiting damage full availability better vaccines. contribute make new variants escape current rna vaccines too.


Note: also slow vaccination program help escaping variants. it’s better e using vaccines, Pfizer produce 5 BN vaccines per year, promised, use that. Stop logic! Masks hygiene work, that’s clear.

As specific question, want anyone die, whether group people tribe not, care. archaic. Interesting, thanks reply. overall trust government? see factor? elaboration rule 3 put rule 9.

If want debate semantics rules, feel free send modmail. public (albeit underlying data table Hebrew). [Great results - still early get exact data. far, 2 people died COVID second dose - good stat given number people gotten it. 

I'm downvoted anything say vaccine completely perfect every regard gets downvoted assumption FUD. I'm super pro-vax (anyone looks post history would see that). lot them, young populations shield death numbers west. controlling spread? happen unless let first place (Vietnam) literally say want true. 

I conspiracy theorist explain China released virus Wuhan. asked they'd release people, something like Taiwan Hong Kong would follow China's normal actions bit more. response big Wuhan small.

Wuhan larger population NYC.

They literally say help right. Truth matter them. I'm talking anti-muslim bias potentially leading denial. my**question** based evident bias. Go away now. making much difference. Switzerland kind vaccination rates EU countries (3% today). suspect rates stay rather close together since guys probably use production facilities EU. Sorry rude, mental problems? 

It at-cost pandemic. Read anything it. Google it. price differences dependent local costs whether buyer already paid R&amp;D. SA, paid R&amp;D costs more, still at-cost. know this, one links sent!!!

Is reason ignored points? anonymous. admit wrong, stop replying. 

Here points:

This disgusting disinformation you. apologise retract

But glad used logic selling profit immoral. use logic EU companies

Please answer: rich countries get vaccine makes EU's approach moral? almost like masks work. Covid contagious people still get masks. Partly one shot vs two, big plus since hate needles (even seeing someone else get shot makes nauseated), partly I'm higher risk allergic reaction vaccines.


Neither actual deal breakers, I'd rather J&amp;J shot. last 11 months nothing ""could happen"". always two four weeks future. long enough move onto next news cycle completely ignore prediction (which never materializes).  Interesting Adenovirus vaccines, like j&amp;j astrazeneca also new tech. understand. China forthright results, numbers heard particularly good. end beginning? even talking about? Ya sudden happen Trump left office, standard every US airport I've 6 months. media media. Unless Canada, apparently :( going approve $2000 stimulus checks? thought Americans would get voted him. entire article literally “Oh, sense hope? Here’s that’s wrong. Welcome darkness.” know what, actually agree you. guess trying play fair sides. honestly hillarious, big middle finger E.U. makes look weak. criticism U.K. got, E.U. basically portrayed bunch useless idiots it. they're hands knees begging incompetence 😂. relationships drug companies regulatory bodies US long source conspiracy theories, genuine concerns both. led significant missteps (like vioxx), control drug prices, problems way healthcare delivered. Meanwhile supplement industry largely unregulated able market almost anything minimal oversight. 

There also biases observed creep corporate funded research. However tend publication type-biases effect actual results. 

My observation issues lead mistrust. mistrust might exist otherwise, hurt address issues meantime. Hah worries, I’ve done that. purpose line rule 9 post high-quality news source remain sub significant international, national regional landmarks.

Does ""one post"" refer one post data tracker (logical rule data trackers)? one post general sense (effectively ""no reposts"" rule put data trackers rule reason)? Would say catching covid? article mention vaccines denied. CAA complex article. 
 
Just look ""Kamlesh Tiwari"" ""Bangalore Muhammad drawing dalit"" hrw.org see biased are. Sometimes?  like going get way.  promised x doses x vials.  cut total number vials get. Dude, wearing mask without complaint whole time

last posts sound lot like complaining ok bud something help empathize patients bit more. fascinating dataset suggests average American 40 thinks catch covid chance dying. like 1000x. 

It really helped mental state knowing people see street think huge chance dying covid. ability properly assess risk compromised.

Source: People listen public health experts anyway. Look long took get ingrained ppl's minds buckle driving, get behind wheel intoxicated? literally took generation! look HPV vaccine rollout. Less 1/3 females less 10% males get inoculated. please sex bro believe poster making ""helpful"" suggestions ever worked before. Ever.   Less 2 years ago, wearing mask airport security would've gotten additional screening. France hasn't.

Please [contact moderators subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Coronavirus) questions concerns.* 95% accurate? don’t believe you. agree. obsession mRNA vaccines watching debut public technology. excited see applications diseases moving forward. remember spring Fauci made comment hopes people stop shaking hands good. Mostly seems like sane guy that’s understood he’s living real world either. Black Death, Ebola, diseases couldn’t end handshakes, covid sure hell isn’t going to. I'm really sure bigotry is. know people worked company asked sexuality religion. problem corporation donates money, thats reasonable. seem little extreme here. I'd source wrong? lazy figure Shane someone's knowledge?

Here's more, read Yep. people we're locked protect. real risk people tuning hear

Another real risk people overestimate risk huge amount. I've following ongoing survey says average young adult thinks 10% chance dying covid. almost 1000x actually is. cannot rational public discourse vaccines, schools return normal people dramatically overestimate risks.

source: able wear masks airport security before? I’ve flown times different places masks already enforced. You’re wrong. nothing development safety, allowing monopolies. new study finds people r/coronavirus likely gaslight Iirc, 6 weeks included trials. trip tightly controlled, total waste time.

Sleep fatigue real! post article! Bingo. think [this idiotic hell wrong dissing paying attention something not? Like maggots say, ""Do research."" TL;DR although research thin, suggests there's chance taking counter medicine pre-emptively get vaccine, could cause vaccine less effective. take chance, wait see actually feel like sick vaccine deciding take something it.  Yes, that’s I’d really like know also. 

Have started research yet? 

Any trials? take both... first dose back syringe. also snowstorm weekend believe great idea like 2-3 weeks ""flatten curve"". year completely crazy. lot businesses can't shut weeks barely making money best times. businesses long gone. also things like customers, suppliers, market share etc take years establish. Someone becoming impoverished homeless losing family house lack income serious problem virus, also long term effects.

Not mention everyone's mental health constant state worry.

The whole response blown completely proportion little logic reasoning. Okay, def need story now. Yeah, assumptions R makes always sound. also hard show 1.9M doses pfizer vaccine plot 21 reported cases anaphylaxis. 

I guess would hard decide belongs single graph go every vaccine, since we're likely 3-4 vaccines approved eventually, one going different efficacy, safety, contraindications, adverse events look for. 

I guess someone comparing options would want able quickly take in, efficacy, number doses, number doses far delivered, number attributable deaths storage conditions (which would depend temperature). 

For end user/recipient vaccine, exact details trial probably less important information let quickly discriminate vaccine seeks becomes available, care things like technology used (adverse mRNA reason) quickly decide one use. Decades ago guy wrote book convinced random woman New Jersey Amelia Erhart. There's lot crazy people there, apparently fuck like rabbits never seem run them. I'm feeling optimistic, folks. Numbers continue go down. know there's negative headlines swirling around concern variants, mantra been: CONTROL CAN. we're controlling - working far. Again... coming? fight already here? Hate guy gas wasn’t really used often WW2 battlefield weapon. Western front 1917 rage sides Well sucks, document really informative. point vaccine? missing something here? bad, better last Monday. Storms northeast probably hurt bit next couple days.  Age 65+ 54 million people 95% deaths. enough vaccines 100 million people coming Pfizer Moderna end March (and another 100 million end June plus vaccines coming), we'll enough vaccinate older, at-risk individuals high-risk public-facing work (teachers, healthcare, grocery, etc.) well summer. get back normal life summer, people likely (appropriately) stop complying entirely restrictions elected officials receiving boatload shit public. Seems like articles make things. care clicks facts Hahah, omg. Ok, laughed way should. sad :,( always thought expectation ridiculous. Pandemics rarely resolve 2 years, nevertheless one ""goldilocks"" zone (insanely contagious deadly, *that* deadly stymies rapid spread). last March, knew instantly least 2 3 years actively fighting thing things seem ""normal"" while. And, even begin address apprehension people going even whole major pandemic blown over. look Spanish Flu indications (@ 1:50, whole video great short): game day ops part time spring alma mater us fall spring sports together semester.

At one point sat watched Vaxxed (Wakefield's ""documentary"") together discussion. different takeaways it, saw contradictions, misrepresentations, false claims, found rather convincing. 

Ultimately different views children, think part us breaking up. wanted 8, raise catholic, vaccinate them. wanted 0-2, raise outside religious, get proper healthcare. think local council would say ""hey, hold on, provide figures""? Preventing serious illness death literally entire focus vaccine effectiveness instead it’s relegated footnotes articles Hi, thanks posting! 

If posting pay-walled article, would helpful rest us would post direct specific link archived article summarize article comment. Thanks! eh weather/temperature component Covid explored more? tropical climate countries largely little covid impact. No, journalism science based data reviewed serious debate consideration. articles (Singapore???) reliant “ifs” “maybes”. Clickbait. hopefully. definitely will. cannot spread like wildfire natural induced immunity available chances mutate decrease. even know full efficacy Pfizer Moderna UK SA variants. weird percentage comparisons pointless. 

Especially short term aiming reduce deaths vulnerable populations, eradicate virus, seems vaccines far equal efficiency Unpopular opinion, probably downvoted, Gyms considered essential, positive effects gym mental physical health important. Novavax still ways US think. J&amp;J soon though heh. I'm stuck leather dps gear bro Indeed.

Like France requiring fill papers every single time leave house.

Or Quebec imposing curfew 8pm 5am. 

And socialize see sun even outside pandemic happily cheer draconian measures would give Mussolini hard on. Unexpected dosing attributed surprise deviation trial dosing (ie, half-dose/standard dose regimen) 1,367-participant subset manufacturing error quantification methods used batches, resulting vials 50% less vaccine regimen would much effective intended dose explained, although researchers theorized lower first dose closely mimicked infection, experts saying could result different size type participants subset receiving lower first dose include participants older 55 years—who tend mount weaker immune response younger counterparts—because different dosage given early trial, older adults original trial design included single dose COVID-19 vaccine, second dose added phase 1/2 trial results showed improved immune responses another dose. sub filled many fucking whiny people like inconvenienced little piece cloth might wear extra months. mind blowing. old folks got week ago, going back couple weeks round 2. Huge weight mind. hope so. work seasonal employee minor league team, really depend gate revenue, concessions, etc. Plus love job would sad miss another summer. live one strictest lockdown states, though (PA). Florida rejected FEMA help, imagine states too. find source? updated daily? I've looking something like People placebo groups died covid.   Luvox common name. Little late.... Maybe last may winter numbers high caused seasonality, holidays small influence nearly much people thought(especially christmas). definitely nearly conscientious mask-wearing, I'll likely keep wearing one crowded indoor places strangers gross shit. MLB’s offer wasn’t even bad. 

154 Game Schedule full 162 game Pay, Universal DH, expanded playoffs. 

I see reason outside expanded playoffs PA would decline that. state? Yeah statistical anomaly.

I also tell anecdote, gf 25 years Corona little sniffing cough, that's it. 

A 60 yest old co worker heart op years ago symptoms testing positive.

Every illness outliers. dont look injection, look opposite direction, always works me. go ask r/COVID19, folks might detailed, technical explanations you. really keep trials data well.

In basic level knowledge this, AZ didn’t collect enough data yet, required approve half dose shots. would complete trial separately. memory serves right, half dose batches created production error specifically study/data collection. Marin County 73% ICU beds taken up. Whatever working. 
 
But none attributable schools, point. 
 No, trust European health agencies. 
 
Ah, OK. planning getting vaccine? answer almost anything careful masking etc. ticket back 85 percent normal life  Lol talking point ridiculous. reproductive number (R0) influenza 1-2 R0 Covid 2-3. number measures many people average someone virus infect. values inherent viruses themselves.

The real-time version R0 called Rt affected masks social distancing environmental factors affect spread disease. current Rt Covid slightly 1 right means Rt flu 2-3 times lower that.

Considering need Rt epidemic spread, makes sense flu spreading Rt close 0. Covid consistently exceeding Rt 1 recently dropped threshold.

___

TL;DR: Covid 2-3x contagious flu. shit still spreading. make convergence anti-vaxxers anti-restriction movement (e.g. Alex Berenson)? specific message targetted impact bought anti vaxxers message radicalized part group think, ""Covid isnt big deal healthy people, vaccine pointless?"" point trying make (not well) lockdowns work done properly. 
And we've got another year ""stuck"" island. Also, people make predictions may favor eradication, would make timeline inherently different (you sound like want management virus goal) chance someone far gone?

Some people going hard convince. Anti-vaccine beliefs like beliefs, become entrenched intractable, like religious beliefs, political party affiliation, sports team root for. ever convinced someone Buffalo root Patriots? percentage people believe conspiracy theories believe like this?

There fuzzy line delineates vaccine hesitant anti-vaxxers. Looking data vaccination rates compared vaccine hesitancy-- lot people vaccine hesitant getting vaccinated. 

A lot people heard things positive negative know believe. I've run lot people said something effect ""I heard vaccine developed faster normal, want vaccine, want one that's rushed!"" 

Usually discuss vaccine development process people convince them. people hard core tend go protests, actively post discussion groups ultimately relatively small. We've recently seen important ""superpreaders"" online misinformation. want give hard percentage, think most. mean summer possible normality going fall screwed. I’d like know that’s likely get much hope. No, read article referencing boarder control travel restrictions only. depending would theoretically going, pandemic may still issue developing countries. highly contagious respiratory disease. I've seen plenty data *suggests* kids get often, do, barely show symptoms, any.

*However*, *still* highly contagious respiratory disease. Even infected kid never shows symptoms, definitely bring home parents grandparents, older siblings, etc. know deadly them, even deadly, long-term complications, changed. 

Based data, safe open schools adults vaccinated. problem strategy could lead new strain adapts infecting kids better, going happen whether open schools not. matter time. That's need everything stop infections, also slow mutations get bullets gun. U.K. actually exports key components Pfizer vaccine EU. Avanti lipids, U.K., exports lipids used mRNA vectors. Considering ‘banning exports’ could risky strategy EU’s production vaccines relies countries. I’m position track sources moment, believe that’s already happened. need it. despite CDC saying that, recommend kids return classrooms   He’s kidding thinks general populous would put restrictions almost 3 years, especially at-risk vaccinated whole point restrictions overwhelm hospitals eliminate virus completely 25 year old co worker mine died weekend. Friday talked normally normal things, Monday get message dead.

This 1 year ago still nobody knows why. healthy never ill.

The human body weird sometimes dying staying alive randomness luck matter what. means district needs work outreach families continue get students back classrooms, abandon education altogether. Fat chance What? pushing AZ produce effective Pfizer/BioNTech Moderna instead less effective Oxford? miss friends. Two friends would like see vaccinated haven't. 

Everything I've read (vaccinated) passing Covid (unvaccinated) along lines of, ""they probably tested.""

Is something studied? I'd like invite one March taking risk unless feel pretty safe.

Thank you. think people latched name well known brand worldwide, Biontech not. Thanks, Corporate defense bot! booked Jab tomorrow I'm clinically vulnerable happy receiving Oxford. w/ Luvox (fluvoxamine)'s action sigma receptor ADs typically touch. Unique property unrelated serotonin reuptake inhibition. See article November: : 
___________ 
Fluvoxamine used commonly treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), social anxiety disorder depression. class drugs known selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), **unlike SSRIs, fluvoxamine interacts strongly protein called sigma-1 receptor.** receptor also helps regulate body’s inflammatory response. one questions this? share study? could share friends aswell

I'm actually looking phone, family informed client death, hyperactive little brother autism needs distraction stop bothering mother. convince coworkers supervisor get vaccine already committed getting downplaying severity COVID? I’m wondering. hear long term damage mild Covid. want know catch mild case vaccinated avoid damage. feel like part keep people immediately going back pre-Covid times get vaccine. Meaning OK let’s stay course weeks/months longer get enough people vaccinated. Let’s put fear people little bit longer won’t go crazy minute they’re vaccinated. saying that’s right that’s kind interpretation continuous fear mongering. rule states one post (one post including data tracker not?) per significant milestone. hope right. try maintain positive outlook, getting harder harder that. opinion impact regulatory capture, conflicts interest, revolving doors, money politics, anything would impact integrity public trust regulatory public health bodies, genesis proliferation anti-vax sentiment?

Are two correlated? see anti-vax movements countries citizens happy trust public health organizations? Whoa! Good news?
Just wait. Vox tell sucks within 24 hours. What? 


They literally producing much vaccine they've identified doses per bottle (the fill stage) causing bottlenecks - well known bottleneck across multiple manufacturers. manufacturers helping asked U.S. Food Drug Administration permission fill Covid-19 vaccine vials five additional doses ease bottleneck manufacturing, according person familiar matter.

The change would allow Moderna put 15 doses size vials cleared hold 10, alleviating pressure part manufacturing process known fill/finish, said person, declined named application isn’t yet public. 


... 


 

The bottleneck isn’t vials themselves, according person familiar, it’s manufacturing capacity fill vials. fill/finish process manufacturing must done aseptic conditions assure contamination, capacity premium.

Companies begun strike manufacturing partnerships focused step process increase output. said Friday signed initial agreement fill vials Pfizer’s partner Europe Covid-19 vaccine. "" Exactly. point people going get fed restrictions? THAT’S pandemic really ends. messaging CDC Biden team, warning public go full stupid vaccinations started rolling out. Many ppl (especially 20-somethings) want get lives, basically going throw caution wind 65's vaccinated. 

Health officials want age group go crazy spring break, flying around country cheap flights. So, yeah, overkill, way drive public's head can't travel &amp; party want maintain control virus. Keep mind average non-redditor look news headlines. Everything see read social media feeds. point double blind trial nobody - neither patients doctors - know got placebo got vaccine. won’t affect care. yes, many died placebo group, would expected, disease leads deaths. I’ll take fries that. Humans never escaped disease, stronger tools deal much cost per test?

EDIT: Nevermind, I'm idiot wrote comment reading article. They'll $30 otc. woke comment I've read months. 

I'm sure give single shit poor people getting absolutely decimated lockdowns 3rd world countries. bad lose house, source income education least covid right? joke. can't ask question? question question based facts. ""debate corona policy"" subreddit? noticed /r/changemyview allow posts ""because would spread misinformation"", right skeptics hanging echo chamber subs I'm sure that's actually better.

Or least, anyone know good website addresses arguments made corona skeptics? seeing sensationalist headline plug book article. There's news without good fear mongering. news boring know muzzled kicked office, get people riled up. Pay attention it. numbers lie, we're coming this.
